[00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:09.731]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:11.332]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.332 --> 00:00:12.913]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:17.095]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.095 --> 00:00:21.157]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.977 --> 00:00:29.301]  It is Monday, the 8th day of March 2010.
[00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:33.628]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:33.628 --> 00:00:36.192]  And believe me, this is a transmission you do not want to miss.
[00:00:40.558 --> 00:00:44.381]  I am really starting to get spooked by what's going on.
[00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:48.985]  I just had the Southern Poverty Law Center call me.
[00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:56.592]  They're doing some cover story on yours truly for their intelligence report that they mail out to millions of people's homes.
[00:00:58.717 --> 00:01:02.058]  My parents, for some reason, get it in their mailbox.
[00:01:02.058 --> 00:01:04.719]  Anybody who's middle class, I guess, gets one.
[00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.620]  And they tell you who's dangerous and who's bad.
[00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.941]  They set the parameters of reality.
[00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:18.044]  If they say the moon is made of cheese, or Iraq has WMDs, it must be true.
[00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:24.586]  And of course, the Southern Poverty Law Center has been saying that the
[00:01:25.683 --> 00:01:40.074]  Tea parties and 9-11 truth are going to do something violent when no one had done anything violent and Chris Matthews and Glenn Beck were parroting what they had to say the last few months and then right on time you have the Pentagon shooting.
[00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:43.637]  You have Joe Stack.
[00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:49.942]  And in the middle of it, yours truly is continually being demonized.
[00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:53.925]  Very, very creepy.
[00:01:53.925 --> 00:01:55.286]  And I gotta tell you, I've had a
[00:01:58.121 --> 00:02:13.146]  Chill, running up and down my spine as of late, not just for myself personally, but for this whole country and this whole planet.
[00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:21.589]  There is no doubt that the establishment is getting ready to really shake the planet up in an attempt to bring in their globalist agenda.
[00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:36.441]  So I want to break down the Pentagon shooting Joe Stack, where this is going.
[00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:53.864]  The ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and the mainstream media don't start demonizing a group and saying they're violent and going to carry out violence until the Pentagon and the Justice Department and private corporate black ops are getting ready to stage terror.
[00:02:55.655 --> 00:03:02.856]  And the Joe Stack situation, the Pentagon, both coincide with preconditioning.
[00:03:02.856 --> 00:03:08.877]  And then there's all the dovetail signs, all the earmarks of a staged event.
[00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:18.519]  And these are only preparatory to get it on people's psychological radar that, oh, these are bad groups, the birthers, the tea parties, the truthers.
[00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.960]  They're going to get you so that these groups can be demonized.
[00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:28.718]  When these are the only groups exposing the banking takeover and what the New World Order is doing.
[00:03:28.718 --> 00:03:32.559]  And these are groups that are exploding in size and popularity.
[00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:36.260]  The demonization is now here.
[00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.202]  And I have been singled out as the chief demon.
[00:03:42.202 --> 00:03:45.943]  I am now the chief devil, according to these people.
[00:03:47.984 --> 00:04:00.267]  And they've got their COINTELPRO at the low level, opening up simultaneously, all revealing themselves as operatives, opening up on this talk show host.
[00:04:00.267 --> 00:04:01.487]  And it has two effects.
[00:04:01.487 --> 00:04:07.109]  It makes this radio show and everything we do that much bigger.
[00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:13.530]  But that is only done in the final process to build us up to then destroy us.
[00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.591]  And I don't know what form that will take, but I have a good idea.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.821]  They've got to be careful though.
[00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:25.787]  They tried to destroy Ron Paul in 2008 and only made him bigger.
[00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:30.332]  He survived it because a lot of us stuck beside him.
[00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:32.514]  And the media ran its disinfo pieces against him.
[00:04:36.508 --> 00:04:42.591]  But this is definitely a time to girt ourselves because things are just now starting to heat up.
[00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:44.452]  And then there's so much other news.
[00:04:44.452 --> 00:04:47.573]  Max Keiser is joining us coming up in two hours.
[00:04:47.573 --> 00:04:49.374]  Very important broadcast today.
[00:04:49.374 --> 00:04:51.275]  You'll definitely want to stay with us.
[00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:53.096]  Please call your friends and family.
[00:04:53.096 --> 00:04:54.376]  Tell them to tune in today.
[00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:57.138]  They don't want to miss this important information.
[00:04:57.138 --> 00:04:57.658]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:04.572]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.572 --> 00:05:05.493]  Number one.
[00:05:05.493 --> 00:05:08.916]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:09.776]  Number two.
[00:05:09.776 --> 00:05:14.680]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.420]  It's true.
[00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.284]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:20.284 --> 00:05:21.125]  Number three.
[00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:24.707]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:28.410]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:29.391]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:32.153]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:32.153 --> 00:05:35.835]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:36.636]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.636 --> 00:05:40.779]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:45.542]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:05:45.822 --> 00:05:49.984]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:51.784]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:54.025]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[00:05:54.025 --> 00:05:56.366]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:06:02.435 --> 00:06:06.437]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:06:06.437 --> 00:06:09.679]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:14.481]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:18.343]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[00:06:18.983 --> 00:06:20.864]  And they really are calling the shots.
[00:06:20.864 --> 00:06:26.066]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[00:06:26.066 --> 00:06:29.328]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[00:06:29.328 --> 00:06:36.170]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.532]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:40.112]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:06:40.112 --> 00:06:42.573]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:06:42.573 --> 00:06:44.694]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[00:06:44.694 --> 00:06:46.235]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[00:06:46.935 --> 00:06:49.838]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:06:49.838 --> 00:07:00.927]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:07:00.927 --> 00:07:05.490]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.834]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:07:09.834 --> 00:07:15.579]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:15.879]  It's true.
[00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:16.299]  True.
[00:07:16.299 --> 00:07:22.003]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:07:22.003 --> 00:07:25.585]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:07:25.585 --> 00:07:30.308]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:07:30.308 --> 00:07:33.069]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:36.391]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:07:37.512 --> 00:07:41.675]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:07:41.675 --> 00:07:46.719]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:50.903]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:52.684]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:07:52.684 --> 00:07:57.288]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:08:00.794 --> 00:08:23.648]  I am calling on every honest and vigilant Muslim in the countries of the Zionist Crusader Alliance in general, and America, Britain, and Israel in particular, to prepare to play his due role in responding to and repelling the aggression of the enemies of Islam.
[00:08:23.948 --> 00:08:28.673]  In a new web video, the American-born spokesman for Al Qaeda calls on Muslims serving in the U.S.
[00:08:28.673 --> 00:08:32.156]  military to emulate the actions of Major Nidal Hassan.
[00:08:32.156 --> 00:08:41.305]  The Mujahid brother, Nidal Hassan, is a pioneer, a trailblazer, and a role model who has opened a door
[00:08:41.946 --> 00:08:48.973]  I believe that defiant Brother Nidal is the ideal role model for every repentant Muslim in the armies of the unbelievers
[00:09:04.309 --> 00:09:06.111]  and apostate regimes.
[00:09:06.111 --> 00:09:06.831]  You shouldn't
[00:09:26.289 --> 00:09:35.515]  Make the mistake of thinking that military bases are the only high-value targets in America and the West.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:52.156]  On the contrary, there are countless other strategic places, institutions, and installations which, by striking, the Muslim can do major damage to the Crusader West.
[00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:57.221]  Bidon also recommended finding ways to shake consumer confidence and stifle spending.
[00:09:57.221 --> 00:09:59.003]  Matt Freak, The Associated Press.
[00:10:01.314 --> 00:10:13.899]  That was the disinfo piece by the Associated Press yesterday that has almost zero credibility on military and terrorism news.
[00:10:13.899 --> 00:10:20.582]  The AP every few weeks runs a headline, Bin Laden puts out new audio tape, or Bin Laden's
[00:10:21.618 --> 00:10:22.558]  He's been dead since 2001.
[00:10:22.558 --> 00:10:22.638]  U.S.
[00:10:22.638 --> 00:10:23.879]  intelligence has even admitted that.
[00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:24.279]  Kidney failure.
[00:10:45.655 --> 00:10:59.447]  And yesterday they announced they had Adam Gadahn, two days after his new video, praising attacks on military bases and other targets.
[00:10:59.447 --> 00:11:02.249]  To coincide, of course, with the Pentagon shooting.
[00:11:02.249 --> 00:11:07.854]  To psychologically create the idea that 9-11 truthers work with Al-Syiedah.
[00:11:09.685 --> 00:11:15.348]  And by last night, they had to admit CBS News, Associated Press, you name it.
[00:11:15.348 --> 00:11:21.452]  Oh, Adam Gadahn wasn't captured.
[00:11:21.452 --> 00:11:30.457]  Just like a few weeks ago, they had the big offensive going on in Afghanistan against Taliban-held Iraq, hitting the streets globally.
[00:11:30.457 --> 00:11:34.459]  Hundreds of billions in LTMAC hitting the streets globally.
[00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:36.080]  Hundreds of billions in LTMAC
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.223]  ...hitting the streets globally.
[00:11:46.223 --> 00:11:52.589]  Hundreds of billions in liquid secret cash for our rulers.
[00:11:52.589 --> 00:11:55.993]  They announced they'd captured number two in Taliban.
[00:11:55.993 --> 00:11:58.095]  Week later it came out it wasn't true.
[00:11:58.095 --> 00:12:02.340]  They just announced, oh we captured number two, oh we captured number three.
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.744]  And of course it's all over the news that Adam Gadahn
[00:12:09.352 --> 00:12:12.793]  Videos and other Al-Qaeda videos have been uploaded by U.S.
[00:12:12.793 --> 00:12:17.274]  government intelligence fronts in the same video layer as the U.S.
[00:12:17.274 --> 00:12:21.155]  intelligence front's video bugs.
[00:12:21.155 --> 00:12:25.916]  The Al-Qaeda video is loaded in by the same CG in the same video layer.
[00:12:25.916 --> 00:12:33.938]  They're so lazy, they don't even make one fake video with Gadahn up there, grandson of ADL founding board member.
[00:12:35.265 --> 00:12:39.887]  Arrested for beating up Muslims outside mosque in California.
[00:12:39.887 --> 00:12:48.091]  Hated Muslims so much and they came to him and said, we got a way for you to really... You want to beat these people, young man?
[00:12:48.091 --> 00:12:51.773]  You go and pose as one of them.
[00:12:51.773 --> 00:12:57.296]  And then later when we're done with you, after a decade of you doing this, we'll stage your death and give you a face job.
[00:12:57.296 --> 00:12:59.697]  And of course, it's been declassified.
[00:12:59.697 --> 00:13:01.478]  Black Ops does that all over the world.
[00:13:04.005 --> 00:13:09.687]  And so, the public's all saying, oh, Adam Gadahn was captured, Alex, guess he isn't a fake.
[00:13:09.687 --> 00:13:11.028]  Oh, really?
[00:13:11.028 --> 00:13:19.491]  And I said yesterday on air, before I learned that simultaneously, by my last hour, it was then announced, okay, we didn't capture him, it wasn't true.
[00:13:19.491 --> 00:13:21.312]  But they even made that a footnote.
[00:13:21.312 --> 00:13:28.575]  They still kept running headlines, Gadahn captured, but not the Gadahn we thought.
[00:13:28.575 --> 00:13:31.196]  They would bury their retraction in other articles.
[00:13:36.257 --> 00:13:39.880]  This is how stupid they think we are.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.202]  This is how stupid they think you are.
[00:13:42.202 --> 00:13:45.384]  They think you will buy anything they put out.
[00:13:45.384 --> 00:13:51.909]  It's like they claim they killed Chemical Ali four separate times.
[00:13:51.909 --> 00:13:55.011]  Then they executed him, what, last year?
[00:13:55.011 --> 00:13:57.133]  They killed him four times.
[00:13:57.133 --> 00:13:59.575]  They killed Saddam's sons three or four times.
[00:13:59.575 --> 00:14:01.997]  They killed different Al-Qaeda leaders, in some cases, 14 times.
[00:14:03.775 --> 00:14:10.381]  And would never retract the last time they killed him, just announced every few months they'd killed him again.
[00:14:10.381 --> 00:14:18.547]  Now, you'd think that they wouldn't be so lazy and would pick other supposed leaders they'd killed and make that up, but they're not lazy.
[00:14:18.547 --> 00:14:31.758]  They're setting the precedent to lie to you in the open at a cartoonish, absurdist level to where the media just psychologically gets accustomed to accepting mass lies and never questioning.
[00:14:31.758 --> 00:14:32.639]  They're setting the precedent.
[00:14:37.034 --> 00:14:40.956]  Now the whole world is hurtling towards total financial collapse.
[00:14:40.956 --> 00:14:45.959]  A new order is being formed on the ashes of the globalist last system.
[00:14:45.959 --> 00:14:54.944]  The head of the IMF today is announcing that all Western nations will pay taxes.
[00:14:56.533 --> 00:15:15.026]  Directly to the IMF and World Bank to quote save the earth and that they don't even need any nations to ratify it that the G20 leaders, the private banking heads that run our governments, have already agreed at their meeting four weeks ago in Australia.
[00:15:15.026 --> 00:15:19.930]  They don't need a Congress, they don't need a Parliament, they do whatever they want, whenever they want.
[00:15:21.926 --> 00:15:24.627]  They have moved most of our industry over to China.
[00:15:24.627 --> 00:15:26.968]  They are now creating a new Cold War between the U.S.
[00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:27.768]  and China.
[00:15:27.768 --> 00:15:29.989]  It is all staged.
[00:15:29.989 --> 00:15:34.151]  They will use the threat of China as a pretext to shut down freedom on the web.
[00:15:34.151 --> 00:15:38.353]  That is being announced today.
[00:15:38.353 --> 00:15:47.517]  And now all the West has got to do, the people that control the West, is shut down any domestic dissent, supposedly for the people, by the people.
[00:15:48.277 --> 00:15:50.479]  We supposedly run our countries.
[00:15:50.479 --> 00:15:52.680]  Our Constitution is supposedly the law of the land.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.681]  But no!
[00:15:53.681 --> 00:16:16.099]  Anyone that talks about the Constitution, Bill of Rights, anyone that questions stage terror, anyone that questions Obama's birth certificate and all of his deception and his records all being sealed, and his real name being Barry Sotero, and anyone that wants a pro-Second Amendment system, you are all internally the number one enemy of the so-called government that sits atop our country, sucking it dry.
[00:16:17.593 --> 00:16:24.837]  All the internal reports, all the internal training is for you, the gun owner, the American.
[00:16:24.837 --> 00:16:28.878]  And now they're preparing the white Al Qaeda story.
[00:16:28.878 --> 00:16:38.423]  They've been putting it out for five years, quietly setting up their story on BBC and Fox and CNN and having Glenn Beck, who we can trust, put it out.
[00:16:38.423 --> 00:16:39.643]  Oh, he's a good guy.
[00:16:39.643 --> 00:16:40.544]  We can trust him.
[00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:43.813]  He says we need new taxes.
[00:16:43.813 --> 00:16:45.615]  He says we need the Patriot Act.
[00:16:45.615 --> 00:16:51.803]  He says he is worried about domestic constitutional terrorists.
[00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:56.689]  And so the talking point is now being put out there at an exponential rate.
[00:16:56.689 --> 00:17:00.113]  ADL reports, Southern Poverty Law Center reports every day.
[00:17:01.078 --> 00:17:02.578]  Mainstream media reports.
[00:17:02.578 --> 00:17:03.698]  The enemy within.
[00:17:03.698 --> 00:17:04.779]  The enemy within.
[00:17:04.779 --> 00:17:05.419]  The enemy within.
[00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:06.999]  The citizens are going to attack.
[00:17:06.999 --> 00:17:08.359]  They're terrorists now.
[00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:12.440]  You bet we're using the Patriot Act against citizens and even non-terror related.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.821]  Oh, we've got to put mobile homeland security, TSA, checkpoints all over America.
[00:17:17.821 --> 00:17:19.321]  That was announced over the weekend.
[00:17:19.321 --> 00:17:23.502]  We're going to randomly put citizens through it and set you down in brain scanners.
[00:17:23.502 --> 00:17:27.043]  I have audio and video of this coming up in the next hour when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:17:28.403 --> 00:17:35.888]  Oh, we're going to have mobile centers that brain scan you and we're going to be asking you questions and there's going to be heavily armed troops everywhere.
[00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:40.371]  First it's D.C., New York, Boston, Dallas, Chicago, L.A.
[00:17:40.371 --> 00:17:49.377]  Now even small towns have paramilitary troops out, regular Army, Marine Corps, National Guard, suddenly all over the news running checkpoints.
[00:17:49.377 --> 00:17:52.339]  All the TV and dramas and sitcoms and movies.
[00:17:54.699 --> 00:18:01.284]  Are set around fictional police state futures where to leave your house, you've got to go through a checkpoint and SWAT teams are everywhere.
[00:18:03.868 --> 00:18:14.257]  Just all mass conditioning for the incredible tyranny being brought in that by design is set up to bankrupt you and your family.
[00:18:14.257 --> 00:18:19.642]  To make you dependent on government for the social engineers to be able to fully take control of your life.
[00:18:19.642 --> 00:18:21.384]  And it's all written down.
[00:18:21.384 --> 00:18:22.785]  It's all admitted.
[00:18:22.785 --> 00:18:27.129]  It is the most nightmare control grid that you can even imagine.
[00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:32.720]  Forced drugging of the population.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.480]  Ritalin, Prozac, vaccines all being pushed.
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:45.603]  The good news is they tried to push forced inoculation nationwide in places like Massachusetts and New York State and they failed.
[00:18:45.603 --> 00:18:51.384]  And so now suddenly there's dramas and sitcoms and movies about people that don't take vaccines being terrorists.
[00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:58.703]  And they're massively increasing the police and staging terror attacks against police.
[00:18:58.703 --> 00:19:03.286]  There's going to be more to make the police and military absolutely hate the American people.
[00:19:03.286 --> 00:19:08.329]  How long have I laid this out for you?
[00:19:08.329 --> 00:19:12.292]  And who are they setting up as the ultimate evil now in the mainstream media?
[00:19:12.292 --> 00:19:13.673]  Alex Jones.
[00:19:13.673 --> 00:19:14.454]  Why?
[00:19:14.454 --> 00:19:16.255]  Because I've got their number.
[00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:19.177]  So I need your prayers and I need your support.
[00:19:21.334 --> 00:19:22.455]  I can handle the stress.
[00:19:22.455 --> 00:19:25.797]  I can handle and control the subconscious fear.
[00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:26.797]  I can continue on.
[00:19:26.797 --> 00:19:33.601]  My team can continue on as we go into very dark waters.
[00:19:33.601 --> 00:19:38.824]  But I do need your prayers and I need your support.
[00:19:38.824 --> 00:19:47.189]  We've got to take the energy they're putting up against us and use it like a judo move to smash the New World Order politically.
[00:19:50.185 --> 00:19:55.868]  Because this is not 1995, when they could stage terror attacks and blame it on the Patriot movement.
[00:19:55.868 --> 00:20:04.813]  This is 2010, and we're gonna give the globalists a run for their money, and we're not gonna stop, we're gonna keep on a-comin'.
[00:20:04.813 --> 00:20:11.237]  Lose one to two pounds a day, the healthy way, and keep it off with the help of the entire Real HCG Diet, with an average weight loss
[00:20:14.142 --> 00:20:14.563]  I'm good.
[00:20:33.522 --> 00:20:34.823]  No prescription required.
[00:20:34.823 --> 00:20:36.144]  No doctor visit required.
[00:20:36.144 --> 00:20:37.405]  No painful injections.
[00:20:37.405 --> 00:20:41.949]  With every purchase, we'll provide you with everything you need, including your supply of HCG.
[00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:49.014]  Unlimited one-on-one phone and email support from one of our amazing health coaches, in addition to a large list of menus, diets, and much more.
[00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:52.557]  Visit www.yourhcg.com or call us at 877-748-2709 to order your HCG today.
[00:20:52.557 --> 00:20:53.018]  Again, that's 877-748-2709.
[00:21:05.827 --> 00:21:09.830]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.092]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:21:13.092 --> 00:21:14.493]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:21:15.211 --> 00:21:17.872]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:21:17.872 --> 00:21:24.273]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:21:24.273 --> 00:21:29.815]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:21:29.815 --> 00:21:39.437]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:21:39.577 --> 00:21:41.919]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:43.500]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.962]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:21:45.962 --> 00:21:48.084]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:21:48.084 --> 00:21:53.228]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:21:53.228 --> 00:22:02.355]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:22:04.275 --> 00:22:06.616]  Hi, this is Peter Krachnobyl with Midas Resources.
[00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:11.398]  As you know, government spending is at an all-time high and inflation will be a direct result of the spending policy.
[00:22:11.398 --> 00:22:18.022]  The multiple federal stimulus packages have been an utter failure, unless you're an executive for AIG, a large banking or investment institution.
[00:22:18.022 --> 00:22:20.523]  What are you doing right now to protect yourself financially?
[00:22:20.523 --> 00:22:23.104]  People like you and I can't go to Washington for a bailout.
[00:22:23.104 --> 00:22:28.266]  Having your hard-earned money in the stock market or any other related paper asset is a lose-lose proposition.
[00:22:28.266 --> 00:22:29.607]  Lose on your capital investment,
[00:22:29.767 --> 00:22:30.068]  I think so.
[00:22:46.588 --> 00:22:46.949]  I think so.
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.200]  Hello!
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:09.963]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[00:23:09.963 --> 00:23:14.786]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[00:23:14.786 --> 00:23:19.850]  Here's a small sample of all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:24.512]  As a homesteader attempting to live sustainably, I was floored by the amount of information in this book.
[00:23:24.512 --> 00:23:28.615]  Dear Linda, I would be hard-pressed to express how much you have impacted my life.
[00:23:28.715 --> 00:23:33.076]  I'm amazed by the wealth of the author's knowledge and the depth of the coverage in this book.
[00:23:33.076 --> 00:23:37.657]  As we see more and more GMO foods on the shelves, this information is good to know.
[00:23:37.657 --> 00:23:39.737]  I am thankful to God for you, Linda.
[00:23:39.737 --> 00:23:41.877]  I can't say enough about this book.
[00:23:41.877 --> 00:23:43.798]  Blessings to you and your family.
[00:23:43.798 --> 00:23:49.499]  The greatest effect this book has had on me and my family is that we truly see Earth's bounty everywhere.
[00:23:49.499 --> 00:23:52.899]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:55.620]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:24:14.966]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[00:24:14.966 --> 00:24:24.609]  The media, the dominant corporate media that's losing its credibility, is in a desperate gamble.
[00:24:25.953 --> 00:24:26.633]  We're good to go.
[00:24:45.492 --> 00:24:53.195]  The people now know the banks have robbed them of $28 trillion and growing, and they've just gotten started.
[00:24:53.195 --> 00:24:58.377]  And they want to use the stolen money to fund the total takeover of their world government.
[00:24:58.377 --> 00:25:01.158]  They're coming out in the open.
[00:25:01.158 --> 00:25:03.679]  Everything the patriots have talked about has come true.
[00:25:03.679 --> 00:25:10.362]  The forced inoculations, the legislation for FEMA camps, the army on the streets, domestic checkpoints.
[00:25:10.362 --> 00:25:14.324]  Coming up next hour, I'm going to break down the physical control grid they're putting in.
[00:25:15.592 --> 00:25:20.797]  The brainwashing of children in school.
[00:25:20.797 --> 00:25:31.806]  The use of the Patriot Act thousands of times per year, per state, by state governments, by county and city governments, against non-terror related individuals.
[00:25:31.806 --> 00:25:36.530]  Domestic violence, marijuana, taxes.
[00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.191]  The homeless.
[00:25:38.905 --> 00:25:42.149]  The Pentagon works for offshore banks.
[00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:50.660]  It's publicly said it runs the RFID, the internet, the entire system, the license plate readers, everything.
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.205]  San Diego, young people having to thumbprint to ride skateboards.
[00:25:55.831 --> 00:25:59.112]  The church is being federalized, the clergy response teams.
[00:25:59.112 --> 00:26:07.754]  You couldn't write a Kurt Vonnegut novel about a future police state and have it more satirically over the top.
[00:26:07.754 --> 00:26:14.576]  This is more scientific than Brave New World, more brutal than 1984.
[00:26:14.576 --> 00:26:22.979]  They've built the control grid in parallel to our republic and now they're dissolving the pillars of the republic and absorbing us.
[00:26:25.114 --> 00:26:28.522]  This isn't a game or a joke, this radio show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:28.522 --> 00:26:31.429]  This is reality.
[00:26:31.429 --> 00:26:35.378]  And all of you, whether you serve the system or not, you're in the crosshairs of this thing.
[00:26:40.325 --> 00:26:41.806]  I don't even know what to do anymore.
[00:26:41.806 --> 00:26:44.688]  It's just so diabolical.
[00:26:44.688 --> 00:26:47.931]  And we've allowed this level of evil to be set up.
[00:26:47.931 --> 00:26:56.518]  That we've allowed the media to tell us torture is good, torture of people's children in front of them, secret arrest and end of habeas corpus.
[00:26:56.518 --> 00:27:03.163]  And now the media is saying, use all of these systems against the American people.
[00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:06.545]  And that's what the Patriot Act says it was designed for in Section 802.
[00:27:08.817 --> 00:27:09.738]  Look at this article.
[00:27:09.738 --> 00:27:14.783]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents inside the U.S.
[00:27:14.783 --> 00:27:17.425]  McCain and Lieberman have introduced a bill to do it.
[00:27:17.425 --> 00:27:22.550]  And that's not just PrisonPlanet.com and Paul Watson that breaks this down.
[00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.452]  Here's the Atlantic.
[00:27:24.452 --> 00:27:25.573]  Atlantic Monthly.
[00:27:25.573 --> 00:27:29.717]  A detention bill you ought to read more carefully.
[00:27:32.876 --> 00:27:33.137]  U.S.
[00:27:33.137 --> 00:27:38.147]  citizens suspected of terror activity without any evidence could be detained by the military on U.S.
[00:27:38.147 --> 00:27:39.049]  soil.
[00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:41.875]  That's the Atlantic Magazine.
[00:27:41.875 --> 00:27:43.638]  Doesn't get more prestigious than that.
[00:27:45.842 --> 00:27:46.562]  Warning you.
[00:27:46.562 --> 00:27:50.224]  I mean, I can't believe this is going this far.
[00:27:50.224 --> 00:27:53.366]  I mean, they're really getting ready to shut down the web.
[00:27:53.366 --> 00:27:56.167]  They're really getting ready to start arresting people.
[00:27:56.167 --> 00:28:01.010]  They're really going to try it, ladies and gentlemen, and they want us to get violent.
[00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:06.252]  Because when anybody fights back, being drug off to the FEMA camp, you're going to be called a terrorist.
[00:28:06.252 --> 00:28:13.076]  Do you have any idea, police and military, what's going to happen to you when 1% of the gun owners resist?
[00:28:14.229 --> 00:28:16.950]  That's a million and a half combatants.
[00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:21.591]  And once this thing goes hot, people aren't going to wait in their houses for you, fools.
[00:28:21.591 --> 00:28:25.191]  And all your cameras and RFID and tracker crap isn't going to help you.
[00:28:25.191 --> 00:28:27.072]  Do you understand that?
[00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:29.292]  And it's not going to help us, the American people, either.
[00:28:29.292 --> 00:28:32.893]  This doesn't have to happen, fools.
[00:28:32.893 --> 00:28:37.814]  There's a reason, in the last 20 years, they only hire police officers with under 100 IQ.
[00:28:37.814 --> 00:28:40.195]  Every time I mention that, I get emails saying it isn't true.
[00:28:40.195 --> 00:28:40.795]  Just Google.
[00:28:41.707 --> 00:28:43.909]  It's mainstream news in every major city.
[00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:49.432]  They don't like hiring cops that are smart, because they know the cops will see through the programming and lies.
[00:28:49.432 --> 00:28:51.954]  And I'm not saying all cops are dumb.
[00:28:51.954 --> 00:28:55.156]  The point is, is that they don't want to hire smart people.
[00:28:55.156 --> 00:28:56.137]  Look at the TSA.
[00:28:56.137 --> 00:29:00.179]  I'm not saying you're all dumb, but a lot of you are as dumb as a box of rocks.
[00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:01.981]  Not all of you, but quite a few.
[00:29:01.981 --> 00:29:09.706]  And they give you this unholy, unconstitutional power, and they teach you that thuggism and abuse is a good thing.
[00:29:12.284 --> 00:29:17.245]  Look, we have a criminal group that's hijacked our country.
[00:29:17.245 --> 00:29:26.068]  And a lot of people are waking up and taking action, so the government's gonna stage a bunch of terror attacks and shootings and bombings and everything else, and blame it on every group criticizing them.
[00:29:26.068 --> 00:29:28.909]  Just get ready for it, it's already started.
[00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:34.750]  It's the only card they can play, as I've said the last few months, and look, it's happening.
[00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:40.332]  But it is really creepy that in every one of these reports, I'm the top enemy of these people.
[00:29:41.345 --> 00:29:43.046]  Let me tell you, it's lonely.
[00:29:43.046 --> 00:29:48.949]  It's so horrible.
[00:29:48.949 --> 00:29:51.290]  And it's painful.
[00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:54.672]  But we've got to stand up against these people.
[00:29:54.672 --> 00:29:56.072]  We're on the march.

[00:31:09.717 --> 00:31:12.958]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:31:12.958 --> 00:31:14.379]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:17.771]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:31:17.771 --> 00:31:24.154]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:31:24.154 --> 00:31:29.697]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:31:29.697 --> 00:31:39.323]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:31:39.443 --> 00:31:41.784]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:31:41.784 --> 00:31:43.364]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:31:43.364 --> 00:31:45.825]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:31:45.825 --> 00:31:47.965]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:31:47.965 --> 00:31:53.107]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:31:53.107 --> 00:32:02.210]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:32:05.106 --> 00:32:08.129]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.

[00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:28.789]  For example, with each pre-production order of three seven-day responders, they'll ship a fourth week of food free.
[00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:30.951]  That's buy three, get one free.
[00:32:30.951 --> 00:32:33.875]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[00:32:33.875 --> 00:32:41.424]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[00:32:41.824 --> 00:32:45.108]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.

[00:32:55.159 --> 00:32:56.200]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex or 800-409-5633.
[00:33:15.214 --> 00:33:19.957]  There's a man going around taking names.
[00:33:19.957 --> 00:33:25.582]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[00:33:25.582 --> 00:33:30.245]  Everybody won't be treated all the same.
[00:33:30.245 --> 00:33:33.827]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[00:33:33.827 --> 00:33:38.191]  When the man... When the man comes around.
[00:33:42.797 --> 00:33:46.240]  The hairs on your arm will stand up.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:52.867]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[00:33:52.867 --> 00:33:54.529]  Will you partake of that last offer?
[00:33:54.529 --> 00:34:00.614]  The enemy belligerent interrogation, detention, interrogation, torture.
[00:34:00.614 --> 00:34:04.879]  The enemy belligerent interrogation, detention,
[00:34:06.454 --> 00:34:35.741]  And Prosecution Act of 2010 introduced by Senator John McCain and Joseph Lieberman on Thursday with little fanfare sets out a comprehensive policy for the detention, interrogation, and trial of suspected enemy belligerents who are believed to have engaged in hostilities against the United States by requiring these individuals to be held in military custody, interrogated for their intelligence value, and not provided with Miranda warning.
[00:34:37.403 --> 00:34:39.565]  The full bill can be read here.
[00:34:39.565 --> 00:34:44.830]  We have a PDF up on PrisonPlanet.com in the article.
[00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:46.552]  The bill does not distinguish between U.S.
[00:34:46.552 --> 00:34:56.302]  citizens and non-citizens and states that suspected belligerents who are considered a high-value detainee shall not be provided with Miranda Warning.
[00:34:56.302 --> 00:35:01.006]  A person considered high-value detainee if they fulfill one of the following criteria.
[00:35:01.718 --> 00:35:03.939]  Then you will be secretly held.
[00:35:03.939 --> 00:35:04.459]  1.
[00:35:04.459 --> 00:35:08.400]  Pose a threat of attack on civilians or civilian facilities in the U.S.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:08.900]  or U.S.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.921]  facilities abroad.
[00:35:11.921 --> 00:35:13.241]  You just pose a threat.
[00:35:13.241 --> 00:35:14.462]  Pose a threat to U.S.
[00:35:14.462 --> 00:35:16.522]  military personnel or U.S.
[00:35:16.522 --> 00:35:18.003]  military facilities.
[00:35:18.003 --> 00:35:19.643]  Potential intelligence value.
[00:35:19.643 --> 00:35:20.143]  That's 3.
[00:35:20.143 --> 00:35:23.825]  Just if you have any potential intelligence value, they can secretly arrest you.
[00:35:23.825 --> 00:35:24.425]  4.
[00:35:24.425 --> 00:35:27.506]  Is a member of Al-Qaeda or a terrorist group affiliated with Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:27.506 --> 00:35:27.606]  Or 5.
[00:35:29.435 --> 00:35:33.298]  Such other matters as the President considers appropriate.
[00:35:33.298 --> 00:35:37.060]  So, unlimited power in the last clause.
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:47.607]  Just like Section 802 of the USA Patriot Act says all activities that endanger human life that are a violation of any federal or state law are applicable under the Patriot Act that strips the entire Bill of Rights.
[00:35:52.671 --> 00:36:07.000]  I'm going to break this down fully in the next hour because it ties in with what the TSA is announcing they're going to do and are starting to do nationwide.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:20.589]  But when I sent Rob Dew, Jason Bermas, and Jason Douglas up to G20, the Pentagon put out a report that they were at a
[00:36:21.832 --> 00:36:26.516]  Air National Guard Base massing thousands of troops.
[00:36:26.516 --> 00:36:33.061]  We called the base and said, and other reporters had been there, and we said we'd like to come over and interview, and they said just come to the gate.
[00:36:33.061 --> 00:36:47.892]  So on video, and this is in the upcoming Police State 4 Rise of FEMA, they pull up, they give them their name, information, and they make them wait 20 minutes, and they say, yeah, pull over there, we're going to come talk to you.
[00:36:47.892 --> 00:36:50.174]  They come over, they talk to them, and they say come back tomorrow.
[00:36:51.141 --> 00:36:54.183]  They then get tailed.
[00:36:54.183 --> 00:36:55.984]  They're in their hotel room eating dinner.
[00:36:55.984 --> 00:36:59.686]  The phone rings and it's, hey, it's Alamo rental car.
[00:36:59.686 --> 00:37:01.927]  We want to give you two free days.
[00:37:01.927 --> 00:37:04.429]  The brakes aren't good on the car you've got.
[00:37:04.429 --> 00:37:06.770]  And our guy said, well, we'll bring it back tomorrow then.
[00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:10.412]  And the guy said, look, I'm such and such with the police department.
[00:37:10.412 --> 00:37:11.273]  And I got his name.
[00:37:11.273 --> 00:37:13.394]  I called him myself later from here in Austin.
[00:37:13.394 --> 00:37:18.557]  And we wrote an article about it at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:37:20.549 --> 00:37:27.374]  He said you were suspected of being terrorists, you were plotting to attack the base, you were sneaking around and you ran.
[00:37:27.374 --> 00:37:30.236]  And he gave them the names of the military officers they talked to.
[00:37:30.236 --> 00:37:32.177]  We have the video, they're totally polite.
[00:37:32.177 --> 00:37:36.761]  See, we're not human to the military and the police now.
[00:37:36.761 --> 00:37:38.962]  We're inhuman scum.
[00:37:38.962 --> 00:37:45.127]  You don't pull up politely and say we'd like to interview your public spokesperson, we're making a film about this.
[00:37:48.168 --> 00:37:49.189]  We're not human.
[00:37:49.189 --> 00:37:50.130]  We don't even exist.
[00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:56.358]  Just out of hand, lie about us, say we were planning to blow the base up.
[00:37:56.358 --> 00:38:02.805]  And then he laughed at Jason Douglas and said, well, you're going to be on the list for the rest of your life.
[00:38:02.805 --> 00:38:07.431]  Because see, Jason Douglas isn't a human because these people are psychopaths.
[00:38:10.945 --> 00:38:12.867]  Lying about us means nothing.
[00:38:12.867 --> 00:38:28.139]  And there's that talking point, ADL, Southern Primary Law Center, mainstream media, going on really for the last year, out of the blue that 9-11 Truth, alternative media, birthers, in the fetters, we got army documents on this, are violent terrorists.
[00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:34.504]  And then magically, somebody goes to the military base, the Pentagon, and supposedly shoots two people.
[00:38:36.744 --> 00:38:46.308]  And magically, somebody who's a Tea Party person, the media claimed, turned out it wasn't true, flies a plane into the IRS building.
[00:38:46.308 --> 00:38:50.010]  And they've got the legislation, which I don't even know why they need this.
[00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:51.291]  I guess they just want it to be public.
[00:38:51.291 --> 00:38:53.812]  I mean, the Patriot Act's already got these provisions.
[00:38:53.812 --> 00:39:02.496]  The Enemy Combatant Act states that they just strip you extra-judicially of your citizenship and can arrest you in these fashions.
[00:39:04.229 --> 00:39:08.590]  This is the complete end of our Republic.
[00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:12.371]  And once these protections are gone, it's going to be used on everyone.
[00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:17.132]  It always is throughout history.
[00:39:17.132 --> 00:39:28.514]  But they think you're such a drug-addled, decadent, dumbed-down, entertainment-obsessed, TV-head culture, that you're just going to accept it.
[00:39:28.514 --> 00:39:29.254]  And they're moving
[00:39:30.188 --> 00:39:49.898]  With scientific tyranny, using your tax money, and they state in these reports, they're going to take your farms and ranches, they're going to take your businesses, they're going to draft your children into domestic spy corps, and domestic environment corps, and it's all being announced, and they're going to take over the Boy Scouts, and they're now doing it and training them to quote, take on gun owners and veterans.
[00:39:49.898 --> 00:39:53.119]  New York Times.
[00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:54.600]  They're just doing it.
[00:39:56.977 --> 00:40:10.140]  And the Republican Party is cheerleading all of it and claiming Obama's a communist and a Muslim and he's not hard enough on terror when he is dwarfing everything Bush did.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:18.401]  Again, giving Obama left cover so the left in this country doesn't realize what's happening.
[00:40:18.401 --> 00:40:21.182]  Do you feel safe having this set up?
[00:40:23.041 --> 00:40:26.425]  Look at what you are allowing to be built.
[00:40:26.425 --> 00:40:29.468]  And a lot of you know tyranny is being set up, so you're scared.
[00:40:29.468 --> 00:40:31.930]  You're going to try to just play it safe.
[00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:35.314]  But playing it safe against tyranny is not playing it safe.
[00:40:35.314 --> 00:40:37.156]  It's ensuring it happens.
[00:40:37.156 --> 00:40:45.524]  And many of you that are laughing now or are scared and don't get involved, if this ends up succeeding, you're going to have yourself to blame for it as much as the New World Order.
[00:40:45.524 --> 00:40:46.085]  You understand that?
[00:40:49.557 --> 00:40:51.399]  You are having your water poisoned.
[00:40:51.399 --> 00:40:53.601]  You are having your food poisoned on record.
[00:40:53.601 --> 00:41:01.228]  The GMO, the hundreds of chemicals they put in the water, the vaccines.
[00:41:01.228 --> 00:41:08.075]  They're coming after me, but they're also coming after all of you.
[00:41:08.075 --> 00:41:10.738]  We know how these systems end.
[00:41:10.738 --> 00:41:14.081]  We know the goal is to be authoritarian and oppressive.
[00:41:16.581 --> 00:41:23.306]  We know they're federalizing all local police, putting in threat fusion spy centers that violate the entire Bill of Rights on its face.
[00:41:23.306 --> 00:41:28.150]  We know the government brings in the majority of the narcotics on record.
[00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:30.572]  We know they're planning to launch new wars.
[00:41:30.572 --> 00:41:34.955]  There is no end to what this ruling class is doing.
[00:41:34.955 --> 00:41:39.679]  They are predators, parasitically feeding on everything good.
[00:41:39.679 --> 00:41:42.221]  Funding radical Muslim terror groups at every front.
[00:41:52.728 --> 00:41:55.450]  So think about it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:55.450 --> 00:41:56.630]  Think about the future.
[00:41:56.630 --> 00:42:04.034]  Think about what you're allowing to happen.
[00:42:04.034 --> 00:42:07.997]  Think about how they sell you on, oh, we're just going to torture foreigners.
[00:42:07.997 --> 00:42:09.898]  We're just going to secretly arrest foreigners.
[00:42:09.898 --> 00:42:17.342]  And then you find out they're using the Patriot Act on gun shows and homeless and veterans.
[00:42:19.096 --> 00:42:24.600]  And supposed family violence and for people supposedly who hadn't paid their income tax.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.222]  Oh, you don't get your due process.
[00:42:26.222 --> 00:42:28.243]  You don't get your equal protection under the law.
[00:42:28.243 --> 00:42:29.624]  You don't get your jury.
[00:42:29.624 --> 00:42:31.826]  But wait, I thought this was for Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:31.826 --> 00:42:36.230]  You are Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.891]  The Army's own report from 2005.
[00:42:37.891 --> 00:42:43.095]  The Togumbo report.
[00:42:43.095 --> 00:42:43.856]  General Togumbo.
[00:42:46.539 --> 00:42:51.405]  Torturing children in front of their parents sexually, raping them.
[00:42:51.405 --> 00:42:54.689]  Well that's what America's gotta do to get tough on Al-Qaeda.
[00:42:59.298 --> 00:43:00.999]  Torturing people to death.
[00:43:00.999 --> 00:43:04.080]  Secret black sites all over the world.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:07.261]  Snatching and grabbing whoever they want, whenever they want.
[00:43:07.261 --> 00:43:11.323]  And now they're saying, we're going to do it in America to citizens.
[00:43:11.323 --> 00:43:17.586]  They have to come out in the open so the FBI and the ATF and the cops and the private contractors think it's okay.
[00:43:17.586 --> 00:43:20.107]  Men, we're getting tough on the terrorists in America.
[00:43:21.223 --> 00:43:27.947]  These truthers and birthers and end-the-fatters have been linked to this event in Austin and the event at the Pentagon, but that's classified.
[00:43:27.947 --> 00:43:30.188]  The public can't be told this.
[00:43:30.188 --> 00:43:32.129]  These are the high-valued targets.
[00:43:32.129 --> 00:43:35.071]  You're going to break into their house and plant stuff on them.
[00:43:35.071 --> 00:43:37.312]  Or you're going to snatch and grab them.
[00:43:37.312 --> 00:43:40.393]  This guy goes home at work at this time.
[00:43:40.393 --> 00:43:45.556]  We've got some local PD working with us.
[00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:49.919]  Member of the CIA operative, Carnaby, in Houston.
[00:43:50.953 --> 00:43:53.775]  What, a year and a half ago?
[00:43:53.775 --> 00:43:54.855]  High-level CIA.
[00:43:54.855 --> 00:44:03.040]  The cops pull him over, get him out of his car, and execute him right there on the street.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.643]  They got CIA squads in every department above 50,000 people.
[00:44:08.643 --> 00:44:11.144]  That's a dead reckoning.
[00:44:11.144 --> 00:44:17.988]  In key drug routes, the CIA runs small police departments.
[00:44:17.988 --> 00:44:20.269]  And hey, if the cops are on the take from the government,
[00:44:21.817 --> 00:44:26.523]  You see these local judges and cops living in million-dollar houses?
[00:44:26.523 --> 00:44:27.704]  Then they start getting more corrupt.
[00:44:27.704 --> 00:44:28.745]  They start raping women.
[00:44:28.745 --> 00:44:32.830]  They start parking outside the topless bars, pulling them over, making them do sexual favors.
[00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.513]  They start beating up their neighbors, killing people.
[00:44:35.513 --> 00:44:37.916]  They start just pulling cars over, robbing people's wallets.
[00:44:37.916 --> 00:44:39.959]  Because, hey, they're allowed to commit crime.
[00:44:42.389 --> 00:44:49.772]  They know stuff about the government, and the government has been recruiting for decades more and more criminals into their midst and kicking the good men and women out.
[00:44:49.772 --> 00:44:58.376]  Until now, they think they've got enough criminals in major police departments and in the state houses and in the federal agencies that they are going for absolute broke.
[00:44:58.376 --> 00:45:07.800]  And the government's put out reports a month ago saying John Yoo and Alberto Gonzalez could write memos ordering the military to torture children and bury people alive.
[00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:18.972]  And that the President is basically a God, and they're telling the Justice Department and the FBI that right now, and they're saying, boys, you do whatever you want as long as we order it.
[00:45:18.972 --> 00:45:21.432]  It's open season on the American people.
[00:45:21.432 --> 00:45:23.733]  Tear them limb from limb.
[00:45:23.733 --> 00:45:26.153]  Drive them into submission.
[00:45:26.153 --> 00:45:28.193]  The banks are going to take good care of us.
[00:45:28.193 --> 00:45:35.655]  We just got to hold these people down while we rob them.
[00:45:35.655 --> 00:45:36.975]  You're all going to get a piece of it.
[00:45:37.878 --> 00:45:43.320]  They're farms, they're ranches, they're businesses, they're women.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:49.182]  And you see all the new cops and FBI people, they got shaved heads, goatees, devil tats.
[00:45:49.182 --> 00:45:56.804]  They look like hardcore ex-con enforcers.
[00:45:56.804 --> 00:45:58.565]  And they do what they want, when they want.
[00:45:58.565 --> 00:46:00.906]  And I want you to know something, folks.
[00:46:00.906 --> 00:46:03.446]  They're not going to give you any quarter.
[00:46:03.446 --> 00:46:04.967]  They're not going to back off one bit.
[00:46:06.004 --> 00:46:07.325]  They decided to go for a broke.
[00:46:07.325 --> 00:46:08.685]  They've committed so many crimes.
[00:46:08.685 --> 00:46:12.247]  They've tortured children with battery acid.
[00:46:12.247 --> 00:46:12.788]  Sexually.
[00:46:12.788 --> 00:46:13.528]  That's all I'm going to say.
[00:46:13.528 --> 00:46:14.468]  It's in the Army Report.
[00:46:14.468 --> 00:46:16.529]  MSNBC, if you want to read it.
[00:46:16.529 --> 00:46:18.490]  And our government has said, that's good.
[00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:19.671]  That's wholesome.
[00:46:19.671 --> 00:46:20.972]  What comes next?
[00:46:20.972 --> 00:46:23.433]  How much further do we sink?
[00:46:23.433 --> 00:46:24.374]  Where do we go from there?
[00:46:24.374 --> 00:46:31.457]  A lot further down.
[00:46:31.457 --> 00:46:32.838]  Hell is being released.
[00:46:36.912 --> 00:46:45.294]  And the movies, and the culture, the video games are all about rape, and torture, and murder, and death, and killing.
[00:46:45.294 --> 00:46:56.017]  You know, the Roman Republic didn't have gladiators when it was first founded, and then it was only convicted murderers that had to fight, and then they started throwing people in for not paying their taxes, or for no reason.
[00:46:57.998 --> 00:47:10.285]  And the Roman historians wrote it was meant to dumb down the people and sear their conscience so they would accept brutality and see it as a form of entertainment so that they wouldn't stand up for each other when they were oppressed.
[00:47:10.285 --> 00:47:20.971]  And scientific torture porn, as the media calls it, showing unbelievable rape and torture in movies, showing it as if it's good.
[00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:24.513]  People go and watch that and are totally desensitized.
[00:47:24.513 --> 00:47:27.135]  It's now manly to be into torture and death and killing.
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.722]  We have been turned into a nation of demons.
[00:47:33.722 --> 00:47:57.721]  And when I say fat, I mean spiritually fat, decadent, slovenly, hateful, spiteful, falsely sardonic, arrogant, exponential envy, like a disease has spread, balkanized, divided against each other, lovers of themselves, lovers of evil.
[00:48:00.511 --> 00:48:05.335]  50 million dead babies.
[00:48:05.335 --> 00:48:13.720]  Black people, led by their wicked leaders, have allowed 52% of their people to be murdered by abortion.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:17.263]  And they love it.
[00:48:17.263 --> 00:48:25.028]  But some college kids, as a joke, throw some cotton balls out by the black dormitory.
[00:48:25.028 --> 00:48:26.589]  And they're being charged with terrorism.
[00:48:29.045 --> 00:48:30.906]  Yeah, see that's what the system does.
[00:48:30.906 --> 00:48:35.590]  It always gives you a false version of justice.
[00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:39.733]  Oh, we're going to kill 52% of the black people.
[00:48:39.733 --> 00:48:44.156]  We're going to shoot you in the back and torture you and ship drugs in your community, but none of that's a problem.
[00:48:44.156 --> 00:48:47.699]  Your black leaders aren't going to get concerned about that.
[00:48:47.699 --> 00:48:56.526]  But don't worry, when some college kids throw a bag of white cotton balls, I guess meaning used to be cotton pickers, we're going to charge them with terrorism.
[00:48:58.257 --> 00:49:00.978]  That's in the news today.
[00:49:00.978 --> 00:49:09.822]  So see, you can feel all good while you go in and get a big glass of fluoride that attacks your testicles and your ovaries and all your organs.
[00:49:09.822 --> 00:49:13.824]  You can shoot yourself up full of your mercury.
[00:49:13.824 --> 00:49:18.086]  You can watch 52% of your people killed.
[00:49:18.086 --> 00:49:20.347]  But nobody told you to be upset about that.
[00:49:20.347 --> 00:49:24.869]  So you're gonna get all sad and cry about the cotton balls all day.
[00:49:24.869 --> 00:49:26.910]  And watch two young stupid pranksters
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.860]  Drug off to prison.
[00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:31.461]  Was it mean?
[00:49:31.461 --> 00:49:33.241]  Was it insensitive?
[00:49:33.241 --> 00:49:35.901]  Yeah.
[00:49:35.901 --> 00:49:38.442]  And black clubs have done similar things to white clubs.
[00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:39.702]  Big deal.
[00:49:39.702 --> 00:49:41.622]  That's just tribal baloney.
[00:49:41.622 --> 00:49:43.323]  And who knows, it may even be a frame-up.
[00:49:43.323 --> 00:49:55.505]  Most of these college campus things where a star gets put on a dorm room, Star of David, or a swastika, or the N-word gets written, most of the time it's been staged.
[00:49:57.349 --> 00:50:02.031]  And that's come out in the news for people looking for attention.
[00:50:02.031 --> 00:50:05.793]  See, we're all worried about men in a cave.
[00:50:05.793 --> 00:50:16.338]  We better give all our rights up to the troops and the checkpoints and the body scanners because it's so scary because the Al-Qaeda boogeyman might get me.
[00:50:16.338 --> 00:50:19.499]  Statistically, you've got a better chance of being struck by lightning twice in one year.
[00:50:19.499 --> 00:50:24.041]  That's an official number.
[00:50:24.041 --> 00:50:25.522]  Than you do of being killed by a terrorist.
[00:50:27.216 --> 00:50:29.077]  Meanwhile, you can see the terrorism.
[00:50:29.077 --> 00:50:30.578]  You can see tyranny.
[00:50:30.578 --> 00:50:42.504]  The body scans, the thumb printing, the tracking, the tracing, the surveillance, the control, the cops everywhere, the gun confiscation, the paramilitary black ski mask, the troops running checkpoints.
[00:50:42.504 --> 00:50:46.166]  I mean, we know what the big bona fide threat is in history.
[00:50:46.166 --> 00:50:50.948]  We know we're in big trouble.
[00:50:50.948 --> 00:50:52.149]  Let's see, it's the perception.
[00:50:53.686 --> 00:50:57.189]  Eh, let's not worry about 16 million murdered black people.
[00:50:57.189 --> 00:50:59.011]  Let's worry about some cotton balls.
[00:50:59.011 --> 00:51:04.716]  And cry and get all scared and say, yeah, put them in prison for a prank.
[00:51:04.716 --> 00:51:06.577]  How would you feel with normal blood pressure?
[00:51:06.577 --> 00:51:09.820]  How would you feel with a normal cholesterol reading without the drugs?
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:11.722]  What if you could avoid bypass surgery?
[00:51:11.722 --> 00:51:14.244]  Would it not be nice to have your heartbeat regularly again?
[00:51:14.244 --> 00:51:15.765]  To have a sex life again?
[00:51:15.765 --> 00:51:20.890]  All these benefits and more can be yours when your body heals itself with the assistance of heart and body extract.

[00:52:05.865 --> 00:52:09.887]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:09.887 --> 00:52:13.129]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:13.129 --> 00:52:14.550]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[00:52:15.462 --> 00:52:18.283]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:18.283 --> 00:52:24.304]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:24.304 --> 00:52:29.686]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:29.686 --> 00:52:39.488]  All of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:39.608 --> 00:52:41.969]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:41.969 --> 00:52:43.550]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:46.011]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:46.011 --> 00:52:48.132]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:48.132 --> 00:52:53.275]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:53.275 --> 00:52:58.297]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[00:53:33.786 --> 00:53:43.112]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:53:43.112 --> 00:53:43.913]  This capitalism?
[00:53:43.913 --> 00:53:50.177]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:53:50.177 --> 00:53:51.058]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:53:51.058 --> 00:53:54.300]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:55.100]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:56.181]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:53:56.501 --> 00:53:56.841]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:54:12.489 --> 00:54:21.613]  Welcome to your life, a government run by foreign banks robbing everything in front of our eyes.
[00:54:21.613 --> 00:54:31.557]  They knew all the torture information was going to come out at Abu Ghraib and other camps, so they released some of the lighter photos, people being bitten by dogs, beaten to death.
[00:54:33.345 --> 00:54:39.349]  Having to do sexually humiliating things because this is what the perverts who run our government like.
[00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:43.932]  And so they sold the world on how great this was.
[00:54:43.932 --> 00:54:46.854]  And of course the world only hated us that much more.
[00:54:46.854 --> 00:54:55.219]  And now our government can't criticize China killing political dissidents because our government's gearing up to do it as well.
[00:54:55.219 --> 00:54:57.901]  And we know how this ends.
[00:54:57.901 --> 00:54:59.622]  We know where this road leads.
[00:55:02.475 --> 00:55:06.398]  To death and destruction and damnation.
[00:55:06.398 --> 00:55:08.500]  We know.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:22.592]  So for all of you soft people out there, who are tuning in for the first time and think this is funny, you haven't studied history and you have no idea what you're in store for.
[00:55:22.592 --> 00:55:30.739]  We're a nation of spoiled brat children, and we better repent
[00:55:32.705 --> 00:55:34.676]  And you're not going to find God in most of these churches.
[00:55:34.676 --> 00:55:36.666]  You're going to find a bunch of worldly glitter bugs.
[00:55:37.807 --> 00:55:46.270]  You're going to find God hitting your knees at midnight in the stillness of the night and asking God for forgiveness for not standing up against this evil and not doing more.
[00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:53.353]  Asking God to forgive you for hardening your heart and not recognizing evil in the culture when it's all around you.
[00:55:53.353 --> 00:55:55.494]  Evil isn't cute or funny.
[00:55:55.494 --> 00:55:58.055]  It's stinking piles of dead bodies.
[00:55:58.055 --> 00:56:00.016]  It's maggot covered corpses.
[00:56:00.016 --> 00:56:03.637]  It's pain and humiliation and it's innocence being tortured.
[00:56:10.711 --> 00:56:25.996]  This disgusting fetish that's pushed of paramilitary police and military everywhere and this religion of weakness and cowardice and a public that's trained to just sit there and wait for help.
[00:56:25.996 --> 00:56:28.777]  Help isn't coming!
[00:56:28.777 --> 00:56:35.839]  I thought about Friday's show with Gerald Cilente talking about how there was a big earthquake when he was in Chile and he got out of the building and nobody else did.
[00:56:35.839 --> 00:56:39.720]  They just sat there calling the front desk and calling the police begging for help.
[00:56:41.943 --> 00:56:47.126]  And how he was in a restaurant, no one would help this choking man.
[00:56:47.126 --> 00:56:52.448]  So he finally helped him, and then they found out there was a doctor in the house who didn't want to get involved.
[00:56:52.448 --> 00:56:55.130]  Just like when I saw that choking woman, no one would help her.
[00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:58.331]  They were all yelling, call 911, call 911.
[00:56:58.331 --> 00:57:00.713]  They had their whole humanity taken.
[00:57:00.713 --> 00:57:04.875]  A bunch of TV-watching spectators who can't and won't do anything.
[00:57:04.875 --> 00:57:09.757]  And the establishment knows that, so they're going to rob you and hurt you.
[00:57:09.757 --> 00:57:11.298]  Do you understand that, fools?
[00:57:15.796 --> 00:57:22.581]  They are going to smash this society into a trillion pieces.
[00:57:22.581 --> 00:57:24.282]  Because that's the nature of evil.
[00:57:24.282 --> 00:57:25.883]  That's the nature of government.
[00:57:25.883 --> 00:57:34.970]  Once evil and corruption gets a hold, it's then a competition of the wicked, of the evil with each other to get it in control.
[00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:43.776]  And within just a few decades, you get pure, psychopathic, sadistic murderers in who just start slaughtering everyone for enjoyment.
[00:57:45.083 --> 00:57:48.664]  And you got CNN saying Mao Zedong's a great guy.
[00:57:48.664 --> 00:57:51.706]  Played that last week twice.
[00:57:51.706 --> 00:57:59.989]  Just bathing, washing our brains in pure evil.
[00:57:59.989 --> 00:58:02.350]  God help us.
[00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:10.753]  And I can really feel in my spirit, in my intellect, in my gut, in my psyche that we are headed towards a major explosion of this tyranny.
[00:58:15.259 --> 00:58:18.861]  I intellectually see it, but I also spiritually see it.
[00:58:18.861 --> 00:58:20.863]  You better get right with God, that's all I can tell you.
[00:58:20.863 --> 00:58:33.250]  You better hit your knees and ask God, not for protection, we don't deserve that, but that we get right with God.
[00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:39.654]  And that God work with all of us to make us be the leaders in our communities to stand against this evil.
[00:58:39.654 --> 00:58:41.916]  That is the only way we're going to be redeemed.
[00:58:46.812 --> 00:58:49.254]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:18.003 --> 00:59:20.165]  That's buy three, get one free.
[00:59:20.165 --> 00:59:23.068]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.

[00:59:57.313 --> 00:59:59.715]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:59.715 --> 01:00:08.941]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:08.941 --> 01:00:10.242]  Big Brother.
[01:00:10.242 --> 01:00:12.024]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:12.024 --> 01:00:13.785]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:13.785 --> 01:00:15.366]  You want answers?
[01:00:15.366 --> 01:00:16.307]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:16.307 --> 01:00:21.090]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:23.452]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:24.352 --> 01:00:37.759]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:40.360]  Society is going crazy.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:49.625]  And it's only going to get worse as this decadent population finds out they've slidden into depression.
[01:00:49.625 --> 01:00:51.566]  70 years ago, during the Great Depression,
[01:00:54.325 --> 01:00:59.108]  90% of the population was agrarian, lived on the land, and was self-sufficient.
[01:00:59.108 --> 01:01:00.889]  10% was urban.
[01:01:00.889 --> 01:01:06.732]  Now, 90% or 89%, if you want to be exact, is urban.
[01:01:06.732 --> 01:01:07.933]  11% is rural.
[01:01:07.933 --> 01:01:11.075]  And roughly half of the rural population is self-sufficient, 5.5%.
[01:01:11.075 --> 01:01:18.240]  And there was an increase in crime and a lot of problems during the Great Depression.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.902]  You have a Great Depression in this demonic, modern system.
[01:01:24.705 --> 01:01:29.147]  It is going to be a nightmare.
[01:01:29.147 --> 01:01:32.168]  Shooting at North Dallas Office Tower.
[01:01:32.168 --> 01:01:41.312]  There's been a shooting at an 18-story office tower in North Dallas Housing, United Texas Bank, among other businesses.
[01:01:41.312 --> 01:01:45.354]  Few details are known to Fox 4 News, but the incident happened at 11 a.m.
[01:01:45.354 --> 01:01:52.657]  at the Four Forest Building at 1222 Merritt Drive off Interstate 635.
[01:01:54.673 --> 01:01:57.976]  Dallas Fire Rescue reported at least three people were transported to area hospitals.
[01:01:57.976 --> 01:02:01.540]  Several police and fire personnel and vehicles have been seen at the station.
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:03.061]  The location.
[01:02:03.061 --> 01:02:06.305]  Officials said the building was on lockdown and that no one was being allowed in or out.
[01:02:06.305 --> 01:02:08.006]  Huh.
[01:02:08.006 --> 01:02:11.410]  Yeah, that lockdown's great so the shooter can kill more people.
[01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:12.951]  Great little system so everybody can call 911.
[01:02:16.345 --> 01:02:18.386]  If somebody's having a heart attack, you just call 9-1-1.
[01:02:18.386 --> 01:02:20.787]  Or if somebody's choking, you call 9-1-1.
[01:02:20.787 --> 01:02:25.129]  Or if a woman's being beaten to death in the street by thugs, you don't even call 9-1-1.
[01:02:25.129 --> 01:02:28.510]  You just go on past because you're so self-centered and decadent.
[01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:34.953]  And if the government's torturing children in black op camps worldwide because they like it, you better not say anything.
[01:02:34.953 --> 01:02:36.994]  After all, you've got to get your nails done this afternoon.
[01:02:36.994 --> 01:02:40.856]  You've got to go watch a basketball game at the bar with your buddies and get drunk.
[01:02:40.856 --> 01:02:42.877]  You've got to act cool.
[01:02:42.877 --> 01:02:45.798]  You've got to get a new tattoo to look tough.
[01:02:50.526 --> 01:02:55.468]  Not saying you're bad if you got tattoos, you know what I mean.
[01:02:55.468 --> 01:02:56.489]  What do you worship?
[01:02:56.489 --> 01:02:57.669]  What are your idols?
[01:02:57.669 --> 01:03:00.610]  You worship God and liberty and freedom and your rights.
[01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.111]  Do you jealously guard your rights?
[01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:10.094]  As Thomas Jefferson said, you better guard the jewel, even if you fight as hard as you can to protect it.
[01:03:10.094 --> 01:03:16.777]  You'll probably still lose it, but if you become a bunch of slack-jogged, lazy punks, you will be taken.
[01:03:16.777 --> 01:03:18.878]  And you will be drug to the center of evil.
[01:03:20.111 --> 01:03:22.472]  Because evil doesn't quit, it always wants more.
[01:03:22.472 --> 01:03:33.537]  I know I'm pretty intense today, ladies and gentlemen, because I can feel the evil rising, because it feels the good rising.
[01:03:33.537 --> 01:03:45.722]  It knows you're waking up, it knows you're getting involved, it knows you're out there waking other people up, and it's ready to launch terror attacks and new wars and financial implosion, and it's planning on it.
[01:03:45.722 --> 01:03:46.423]  Here's what I'm going to do.
[01:03:47.628 --> 01:03:55.712]  I'm going to take calls in the next 30 minutes, and we're going live at the 33 After at PrisonPlanet.tv in the last two and a half hours.
[01:03:55.712 --> 01:04:04.096]  And we're going to have a lot of key news I'm going to be covering, but I'm going to open the phones up now at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:04.096 --> 01:04:12.220]  And we don't screen your calls, but if you just call in to plug something or call in to ask me about chupacabras or something, I'm not doing it.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:15.362]  I've laid out a lot of serious issues here, and I'd hope you'd want to discuss those.
[01:04:16.647 --> 01:04:16.727]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:16.727 --> 01:04:16.787]  800-259-9231.
[01:04:16.787 --> 01:04:18.589]  And we'll get you up and on the air today.
[01:04:18.589 --> 01:04:20.330]  It is Monday, the 8th day of March 2010.
[01:04:20.330 --> 01:04:21.651]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:04:21.651 --> 01:04:26.816]  Coming up, I'm going to break down in great detail the Pentagon shooting, the Joe Stack situation,
[01:04:45.899 --> 01:04:48.580]  The good news out of Iceland.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:51.681]  The bad news out of China and the Middle East.
[01:04:51.681 --> 01:04:53.982]  I haven't even gotten into it all yet, but it's coming up.
[01:04:53.982 --> 01:04:58.763]  And Max Keiser.
[01:04:58.763 --> 01:05:03.545]  Don't forget to financially support us if you think this work's important by buying books and videos at InfoWars.com.
[01:05:04.424 --> 01:05:09.750]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:12.493]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:05:12.493 --> 01:05:17.818]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:05:17.818 --> 01:05:22.303]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from InfoWars.com.
[01:05:22.303 --> 01:05:23.404]  We also have some specials.
[01:05:23.404 --> 01:05:26.828]  You can get some of our other films half price when you order Shadow Government.
[01:05:27.308 --> 01:05:38.334]  A new level in production quality and in information exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[01:05:38.334 --> 01:05:40.315]  This film needs to be seen.
[01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:41.456]  Everybody needs to get it.
[01:05:41.456 --> 01:05:42.637]  So order yours today.
[01:05:42.637 --> 01:05:46.559]  Show it to your friends, your family, your church, your neighbors, your boss, your employees.
[01:05:48.024 --> 01:05:49.626]  Shadow Government, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:49.626 --> 01:05:52.268]  Get your copy at InfoWars.com today.
[01:05:52.268 --> 01:05:53.669]  Shadow Government.
[01:05:53.669 --> 01:05:55.891]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.
[01:05:55.891 --> 01:05:59.155]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:06:04.261 --> 01:06:08.804]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:08.804 --> 01:06:09.725]  Number one.
[01:06:09.725 --> 01:06:13.147]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:13.147 --> 01:06:14.008]  Number two.
[01:06:14.008 --> 01:06:18.891]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:18.891 --> 01:06:19.652]  It's true.
[01:06:19.652 --> 01:06:24.516]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:24.516 --> 01:06:24.976]  Number three.
[01:06:25.316 --> 01:06:28.919]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:28.919 --> 01:06:33.623]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:33.623 --> 01:06:36.385]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:36.385 --> 01:06:39.727]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:40.848 --> 01:06:44.990]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:50.052]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:50.052 --> 01:06:54.234]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:54.234 --> 01:06:56.015]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:56.015 --> 01:07:00.617]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:07:03.999 --> 01:07:08.123]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:07:08.123 --> 01:07:10.985]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:13.087]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:07:13.087 --> 01:07:15.329]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:07:15.329 --> 01:07:16.970]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:21.294]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:37.641]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[01:07:37.641 --> 01:07:40.362]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[01:07:40.362 --> 01:07:47.525]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[01:07:51.807 --> 01:07:53.748]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[01:07:53.748 --> 01:07:54.189]  Big Brother.
[01:07:54.189 --> 01:07:54.749]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:12.706 --> 01:08:14.468]  You are only alive once.
[01:08:14.468 --> 01:08:23.875]  You are living in the middle of one of the most important times in human history, if not the most important.
[01:08:23.875 --> 01:08:27.778]  Massive technological development
[01:08:44.008 --> 01:08:54.537]  A incredibly wicked elite ruling the planet, setting up a draconian planetary regime to carry out mass extermination of the majority of the population.
[01:08:54.537 --> 01:09:02.944]  That is their final public stated goal thousands of times in textbooks and government documents.
[01:09:02.944 --> 01:09:09.109]  You think they're selling you on torture and death and war and surveillance just so they can be rich and powerful?
[01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:10.750]  They've already got all the money.
[01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:11.751]  They already print the money.
[01:09:13.188 --> 01:09:17.473]  These are unbelievably dark people.
[01:09:17.473 --> 01:09:19.876]  And, you know, they think you're a coward.
[01:09:19.876 --> 01:09:23.300]  They think I get up here and talk about all this and in a way they're happy I'm here.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:26.404]  They think it scares you and creates a chilling effect.
[01:09:26.404 --> 01:09:30.409]  I certainly hope that's not the case and I know it scares some and cowards don't matter.
[01:09:33.487 --> 01:09:41.031]  I'm talking to people that are red-blooded and realize that you don't cower down to a threat and have it go away.
[01:09:41.031 --> 01:09:47.454]  I'm speaking to people that recognize what's going on and are going to stand up against it and realize we can beat these people.
[01:09:47.454 --> 01:09:50.376]  Because 90% of this war is a mind game.
[01:09:50.376 --> 01:09:57.960]  This is an illegitimate, degenerate pack of lying criminals who engage in every form of deception and lies you can imagine.
[01:10:00.512 --> 01:10:08.900]  And they've got to sell their minions, their police, their military, their enforcers, their bureaucrats, that torture and secret arrest is good.
[01:10:08.900 --> 01:10:14.184]  That's why they're trying to pass new legislation to arrest citizens secretly and torture them for no reason.
[01:10:14.184 --> 01:10:16.106]  Even Atlantic Monthly's reporting on this.
[01:10:16.106 --> 01:10:18.949]  That's coming up at the bottom of the hour with a big news blitz.
[01:10:24.056 --> 01:10:24.797]  But you know what?
[01:10:24.797 --> 01:10:32.432]  I'm not angry at cowards who rationalize what's going on and psychologically make excuses and laugh this off.
[01:10:32.432 --> 01:10:35.879]  Or who know it's real and just hide under their bed.
[01:10:36.874 --> 01:10:38.315]  Figuratively.
[01:10:38.315 --> 01:10:41.077]  I'm angry at another group of people.
[01:10:41.077 --> 01:10:50.603]  Not just the evil people that have set this system up and profit from it, but from those of you out there that know how evil this system is, and you have made the choice to join it?
[01:10:50.603 --> 01:10:52.905]  You have made the choice to serve it?
[01:10:52.905 --> 01:10:55.307]  You know it's bad?
[01:10:55.307 --> 01:11:00.350]  And you have decided to join with it?
[01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:02.772]  Because you think you're on the winning team.
[01:11:04.758 --> 01:11:18.772]  You know it's bad, you know it's evil, you know it's destructive, and you say, Alex, because I've been at events and been called and talked to people, and they always say it's off record, and I've got, I wear a journalist hat, so it's off record, but you've seen them write books and talk about it.
[01:11:18.772 --> 01:11:20.674]  You've heard them here, some of them on this show.
[01:11:20.674 --> 01:11:22.596]  Oh, Alex, the world's always been a bad place.
[01:11:22.596 --> 01:11:25.619]  You've got to make compromises, and the general public is as evil as the elite.
[01:11:26.059 --> 01:11:42.544]  And they'd tear you apart if they were in control, and you just better try to join the elite to protect yourself, and, you know, we've got to do some bad things to protect the good, and, you know, the truth must be guarded by a bodyguard of lies, and the end justifies the means, and blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:42.544 --> 01:11:47.206]  Yeah, look where that type of thinking has taken us.
[01:11:47.206 --> 01:11:48.406]  All right, I said I'm gonna go to your calls.
[01:11:52.355 --> 01:11:54.156]  It just really hit me this weekend.
[01:11:54.156 --> 01:11:56.878]  It hits me stronger and stronger just how hardcore this is.
[01:11:56.878 --> 01:11:58.419]  Just how real it is.
[01:11:58.419 --> 01:12:03.242]  And the bizarreness of the things that are going on.
[01:12:03.242 --> 01:12:04.943]  The over-the-top.
[01:12:04.943 --> 01:12:15.150]  And the fact that I'm one of the most dominant, prolific voices in the world against this.
[01:12:15.150 --> 01:12:16.451]  That isn't an ego trip.
[01:12:16.451 --> 01:12:17.592]  That freaks me out.
[01:12:19.016 --> 01:12:20.597]  I'm freaked out.
[01:12:20.597 --> 01:12:22.499]  Because I know I'm right.
[01:12:22.499 --> 01:12:25.181]  I know I'm dealing with psychopathic, control freak killers.
[01:12:25.181 --> 01:12:27.723]  I know who they are.
[01:12:27.723 --> 01:12:28.564]  I know they're bad.
[01:12:28.564 --> 01:12:29.284]  We've proven it.
[01:12:29.284 --> 01:12:32.166]  It's ridiculous how much proof there is.
[01:12:32.166 --> 01:12:33.968]  And it's like a bad nightmare.
[01:12:33.968 --> 01:12:35.189]  I just want to wake up from it.
[01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:36.270]  I want it to stop.
[01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:41.494]  I want people in government to say, no, we're not going to be pure evil.
[01:12:41.494 --> 01:12:45.397]  I mean, I wish for a boss hog corruption.
[01:12:45.397 --> 01:12:47.719]  I wish it was just politicians getting bribes and
[01:12:48.755 --> 01:12:50.998]  Kickbacks and, you know, on highways.
[01:12:50.998 --> 01:12:58.566]  I mean, that's not good, but it's not giant CIA torture centers, which really aren't about even torture.
[01:12:58.566 --> 01:13:09.818]  It's about having hundreds of bases where government personnel and private contractors rape and torture people and children to create cadres, armies of literal demon force.
[01:13:09.818 --> 01:13:10.419]  I mean, it's just...
[01:13:10.959 --> 01:13:13.721]  Armies of hell are being bred and fitted out.
[01:13:13.721 --> 01:13:22.866]  I see their huge systems and their war fires and their factories turning out, not just physical implements of war, but the spiritual implements.
[01:13:22.866 --> 01:13:24.547]  And it's unbelievable.
[01:13:24.547 --> 01:13:31.352]  And they're all around us and carrying out every form of viciousness and horribleness against innocents you can imagine.
[01:13:32.102 --> 01:13:44.930]  And I feel the pain, spiritually, intellectually, physically, but I can feel the pain of the planet, of the people on the planet and all the horrible sorrow and everything they're being put through.
[01:13:44.930 --> 01:13:46.611]  And I know why this has happened.
[01:13:46.611 --> 01:13:58.918]  Evil's always been there, but we became beguiled by it, we got sold by it, to just go to sleep and not be involved and it's not our job, and just watch our TVs and suck our thumbs and
[01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:03.671]  We have cancer.
[01:14:03.671 --> 01:14:10.154]  We have spiritual cancer, we have physical cancer, we have economic cancer.
[01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:26.361]  All the curses that are coming upon us, all the disease and infection exploding, all the new diseases and all the... We are just completely screwed.
[01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:27.662]  We are dealing with an elite.
[01:14:30.543 --> 01:14:33.444]  That wouldn't just kill 3,000 people on 9-11.
[01:14:33.444 --> 01:14:36.085]  They would do it in such an obvious way.
[01:14:36.085 --> 01:14:38.266]  Multi-faceted, evil genius.
[01:14:38.266 --> 01:14:40.227]  To threaten those of us that are intelligent.
[01:14:40.227 --> 01:14:41.487]  Yeah, look, we kill people out in the open.
[01:14:41.487 --> 01:14:43.468]  There's nothing you're going to do to stop us.
[01:14:43.468 --> 01:14:49.971]  And then their disdain for the general public, thinking you're so dumb that you would just accept this and buy their lie.
[01:14:49.971 --> 01:14:53.212]  Because they know subconsciously and spiritually, you know it's a lie.
[01:14:53.212 --> 01:14:54.532]  And then you accept the lie.
[01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:56.913]  You buy into the lie.
[01:14:56.913 --> 01:14:58.574]  And then you'll accept all the other lies.
[01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:09.737]  All right, I'm done preaching.
[01:15:09.737 --> 01:15:14.159]  I said I'd take your calls.
[01:15:14.159 --> 01:15:17.941]  And I'm not even depressed.
[01:15:17.941 --> 01:15:19.521]  This is not depression you're hearing here.
[01:15:19.521 --> 01:15:21.922]  This is not even a weight.
[01:15:21.922 --> 01:15:23.843]  I don't even have a weight on me.
[01:15:23.843 --> 01:15:34.647]  It's more like I've got so much depth now of understanding and it's indescribable.
[01:15:37.932 --> 01:15:40.814]  The worst part is I have to be aware of the establishment.
[01:15:40.814 --> 01:15:43.175]  I have to know that they're conscious.
[01:15:43.175 --> 01:15:44.736]  And know the evil they're committing.
[01:15:44.736 --> 01:15:46.277]  And that they enjoy it.
[01:15:46.277 --> 01:15:52.581]  And that for them this is all so much fun.
[01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:55.023]  And that I'm here conscious.
[01:15:55.023 --> 01:15:56.363]  I have their same perspective.
[01:15:56.363 --> 01:16:01.587]  That is, I can look at things through their eyes.
[01:16:01.587 --> 01:16:03.368]  And I can look at things through the public's eyes.
[01:16:03.368 --> 01:16:04.228]  Through different strata.
[01:16:04.228 --> 01:16:05.509]  Different psychological types.
[01:16:05.509 --> 01:16:06.570]  And I just can't believe it.
[01:16:07.685 --> 01:16:13.850]  I can't believe our species is like this.
[01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:16.772]  I don't want to run away and hide out of fear.
[01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:21.116]  I just want to not be part of this.
[01:16:21.116 --> 01:16:22.277]  I just want it to go away.
[01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:23.237]  I want it to stop.
[01:16:23.237 --> 01:16:34.126]  I don't think most of you realize what's going to happen to all of you.
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:41.404]  What's already being done to you through the water and food, through the television.
[01:16:41.404 --> 01:16:45.066]  God Almighty!
[01:16:45.066 --> 01:16:54.191]  It really hit me, the average black person doesn't even know or care that 52% of their people are killed in America.
[01:16:54.191 --> 01:17:04.698]  And that's a great example of how perspective, they can be upset over somebody putting a cross in their yard or cotton balls on their front lawn, but not over half of their people being murdered.
[01:17:07.335 --> 01:17:08.096]  That's the same thing.
[01:17:08.096 --> 01:17:10.677]  We have this big criminal government abusing all of us openly.
[01:17:10.677 --> 01:17:11.318]  We know it's evil.
[01:17:11.318 --> 01:17:25.248]  We know it lies constantly, but we see an awakening taking place, but people aren't awakening fast enough or deep enough.
[01:17:25.248 --> 01:17:35.636]  If I could just show people what I know, if I could just have you look through my mind at all the research I've done, and if people could just have discernment, it would just
[01:17:40.083 --> 01:17:45.568]  The world, though, the truly wicked, though, they can see.
[01:17:45.568 --> 01:17:46.368]  That's the thing about it.
[01:17:46.368 --> 01:17:47.830]  They are not blind.
[01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:50.352]  At the highest levels of evil, they're not deceived.
[01:17:50.352 --> 01:17:53.855]  They know what they're doing.
[01:17:53.855 --> 01:17:56.777]  And what's sick is they can see what I see.
[01:17:56.777 --> 01:18:04.384]  They can see the alternative for humanity.
[01:18:04.384 --> 01:18:04.504]  And
[01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:14.374]  It's just unspeakable.
[01:18:14.374 --> 01:18:17.597]  Unspeakable.
[01:18:17.597 --> 01:18:21.240]  It's unspeakable.
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:26.404]  It's... It's beyond anything I could have ever imagined.
[01:18:29.025 --> 01:18:35.907]  Because more than just committing their acts of evil, they enjoy the discord, the confusion, the mental illness, the sickness.
[01:18:35.907 --> 01:18:38.188]  They love taking God's incredible creation.
[01:18:38.188 --> 01:18:47.990]  They love taking innocent, wonderful children full of light and liberty and a future, and turning them into these hunchback, crone-like demons we see people on the planet.
[01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:52.952]  I don't even mean their physical look, I mean the spirit.
[01:18:52.952 --> 01:18:56.953]  All right, we're going to go to break and go to Bill, Kerry, John, Mark, Ben, and others, and then I'm going to get into all the news.
[01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:02.243]  But I'll say what I said last hour, folks.
[01:19:02.243 --> 01:19:13.086]  You had better hit your knees every night, and you better ask the creator of the universe to open your eyes up.
[01:19:13.086 --> 01:19:29.172]  Because if you open your eyes up, spiritually, to the devil's system, and if you even begin to see one-tenth of what I've seen, you will know why I work so hard.
[01:19:30.151 --> 01:19:34.993]  Why I can't even make myself go home though I hate even being here.
[01:19:34.993 --> 01:19:41.054]  I hate doing this but I can't stop because I've got to fight these people.
[01:19:41.054 --> 01:19:46.956]  Then you wouldn't be so lazy and so weak minded and so willing to be deceived.
[01:19:46.956 --> 01:19:53.398]  If you had any idea what we're facing.
[01:19:53.398 --> 01:19:55.699]  Mal killed 80 million people.
[01:19:57.443 --> 01:19:58.686]  80 million.
[01:19:58.686 --> 01:20:02.075]  And he was nothing but a prototype of what is about to happen.
[01:20:02.075 --> 01:20:03.078]  They're going to kill us.

[01:24:16.043 --> 01:24:19.906]  It wasn't that they were squares and weren't cool.
[01:24:19.906 --> 01:24:24.150]  They had been through history, they'd been through war, they'd seen other civilizations.
[01:24:24.150 --> 01:24:32.697]  They knew that slovenliness, weakness, backstabbing pettiness, worldliness was destructive.
[01:24:32.697 --> 01:24:36.120]  And that once you let evil in, it will bring you down and destroy you.
[01:24:38.237 --> 01:24:52.023]  Because the globalists aren't just going to kill us, they're going to continue to poison us slowly with degenerative diseases, they're going to continue to murder us at will, they're going to continue to carry out all forms of evil against our society.
[01:24:52.023 --> 01:24:56.405]  We need to kick the evil out, and it starts in our own homes, and it starts in our own hearts.
[01:24:56.405 --> 01:25:06.830]  It starts on our mind, our soul, our home, our block, our neighborhood, our city, our county, our state, our country, our world!
[01:25:08.083 --> 01:25:09.904]  We need to repent!
[01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:12.806]  That's what we need to do!
[01:25:12.806 --> 01:25:13.926]  It changes within us.
[01:25:13.926 --> 01:25:14.987]  And look, I'm not perfect.
[01:25:14.987 --> 01:25:17.308]  I'm 36 years old, and I've been worldly.
[01:25:17.308 --> 01:25:22.592]  I've done bad things, but I've always had a good heart and loved God and loved goodness.
[01:25:22.592 --> 01:25:24.012]  And that's where it starts, folks.
[01:25:24.012 --> 01:25:31.457]  If you just ask God to fill you with His Spirit, then if you're truly filled with the Spirit, you will fight evil.
[01:25:32.492 --> 01:25:37.816]  If you're not filled with that in your church, ladies and gentlemen, you're in a wicked New World Order church, and you already knew that.
[01:25:37.816 --> 01:25:40.377]  All right, I said I'm going to your calls.
[01:25:40.377 --> 01:25:44.400]  I've got a bunch of news to get to, and Kaiser's coming up, but Bill in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:45.681]  Thanks for holding.
[01:25:45.681 --> 01:25:47.762]  Yes, hi, Alex.
[01:25:47.762 --> 01:25:54.427]  Never believe that your message isn't getting through, because even in Canada, you have a large following here.
[01:25:55.992 --> 01:25:59.374]  I know, but the message isn't getting through of how bad it really is, Bill!
[01:25:59.374 --> 01:26:01.054]  People think I'm exaggerating!
[01:26:01.054 --> 01:26:05.456]  I can't describe how evil it is!
[01:26:05.456 --> 01:26:08.817]  No, the right ones follow everything that you've said.
[01:26:08.817 --> 01:26:15.760]  And at the right time, and I don't know when that's going to be, they're going to stand up to be counted.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:22.903]  But what I'm calling in about here is there is one family that has been singled out here
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:38.627]  And had their home invaded by 100 camouflage and heavily armed SWAT team members and everything else.
[01:26:38.627 --> 01:26:43.990]  And they were occupied for four and a half days like that.
[01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:51.234]  And when the children wanted to hit the biffy, they had to have a police escort.
[01:26:51.234 --> 01:26:52.394]  What was this?
[01:26:52.394 --> 01:26:53.195]  Has it been in the news?
[01:26:54.534 --> 01:26:58.517]  Yes, it has, but they've put a spin on it.
[01:26:58.517 --> 01:27:01.179]  So what happened?
[01:27:01.179 --> 01:27:02.140]  Tell me the case.
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:03.181]  Where is it?
[01:27:03.181 --> 01:27:09.286]  The case is in northern Alberta, close to the British Columbia border.
[01:27:09.286 --> 01:27:19.694]  And this family set up there about 20 years ago to be self-sufficient, so they wouldn't be depending on the new agers for everything, right?
[01:27:19.694 --> 01:27:21.596]  And let me guess, they said they were abusing the children?
[01:27:21.596 --> 01:27:22.376]  I don't know the case.
[01:27:22.376 --> 01:27:22.777]  What happened?
[01:27:23.263 --> 01:27:31.690]  Well, they haven't got, they tried that, but it wouldn't wash because these people are very clean living people.
[01:27:31.690 --> 01:27:35.333]  And they spin their own wool, they make their own cheese.
[01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:38.696]  So why did the devils come?
[01:27:38.696 --> 01:27:39.677]  What did the devils do?
[01:27:39.677 --> 01:27:41.358]  Tell me the case so I can look it up.
[01:27:41.358 --> 01:27:48.825]  Okay, ten years ago, there was some sabotage in the oil field.
[01:27:49.565 --> 01:28:00.069]  And part of the sabotage was done by the police and they admitted it in court and yet still put this man in jail for 28 months.
[01:28:00.069 --> 01:28:04.730]  Oh sure, that's the case where they're claiming natives are blowing stuff up?
[01:28:04.730 --> 01:28:11.113]  Well, we don't know who they're claiming is blowing what up.
[01:28:11.113 --> 01:28:13.814]  So why were the police there for four days?
[01:28:13.814 --> 01:28:17.095]  Well, they came under the auspices of a search warrant
[01:28:18.112 --> 01:28:23.518]  Which was, uh, it appears to be improperly done.
[01:28:23.518 --> 01:28:28.404]  And even if it was, you still don't have... So they held him captive for four days?
[01:28:28.404 --> 01:28:29.966]  Four and a half.
[01:28:29.966 --> 01:28:30.406]  And, uh...
[01:28:31.582 --> 01:28:38.844]  Anybody that, you know, like a three-year-old wanted to use the biffy... No, no, they do that in public school training.
[01:28:38.844 --> 01:28:43.166]  They make the children defecate and urinate in buckets at most major public schools.
[01:28:43.166 --> 01:28:47.928]  If you don't believe me, listeners, just search Engine It as part of the mass mind control.
[01:28:47.928 --> 01:28:50.068]  It's literally a re-education camp.
[01:28:50.068 --> 01:28:53.709]  Tell me the name of the people so I can pull up an article on it.
[01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:55.810]  Webu Ludwig.
[01:28:55.810 --> 01:28:58.591]  L-U-D-W-I-G.
[01:28:58.591 --> 01:29:00.712]  And give me a basic headline.
[01:29:02.361 --> 01:29:14.788]  Well, there's an oil fire burning out of control now that's just downwind from them, and it's the worst ecological disaster... But see, here's the deal.
[01:29:14.788 --> 01:29:19.030]  You just said the guy's name, and I'm just trying to... I mean, what did the media call the case?
[01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:20.631]  I'm just trying to find out the headline here.
[01:29:21.971 --> 01:29:23.512]  Well, there's... You know what, Bill?
[01:29:23.512 --> 01:29:24.413]  I appreciate your call.
[01:29:24.413 --> 01:29:26.935]  Somebody will send me the information.
[01:29:26.935 --> 01:29:30.537]  Okay, send it to ShowTipsAtInfoWars.com.
[01:29:30.537 --> 01:29:31.358]  You said his name.
[01:29:31.358 --> 01:29:37.642]  I don't know if the guys got that or probably didn't, but... Lubwig or something.
[01:29:37.642 --> 01:29:39.504]  Alright, Kerry, John, Mark, Ben.

[01:33:31.511 --> 01:33:33.872]  A lot happening there.

[01:35:48.047 --> 01:35:50.848]  Okay, I want to get into the news here in a moment.
[01:35:50.848 --> 01:35:53.129]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[01:35:53.129 --> 01:36:03.075]  This is just... We knew it was coming, but it's still... Just disgusting to see them actually doing it.
[01:36:04.022 --> 01:36:07.305]  Let's go to Kerry.
[01:36:07.305 --> 01:36:10.247]  Kerry in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:36:10.247 --> 01:36:18.874]  Hey Alex, whenever you start walking through this grid of evil that's being established, I can't help but think of the Luciferian creed of do as thou wilt.
[01:36:18.874 --> 01:36:28.682]  Because that's what holds us all together, whether it's torturing children or genetically modifying food or lies or abortion, whatever it is, it goes back to that
[01:36:29.707 --> 01:36:36.531]  People don't like to admit that Luciferianism that's integral with the whole elitist thinking, but it's there.
[01:36:36.531 --> 01:36:38.412]  You can't get around it.
[01:36:38.412 --> 01:36:46.636]  And to the last caller, you mentioned how you get frustrated that you can't, that people think you're exaggerating when you say the things that are true.
[01:36:46.636 --> 01:36:58.122]  And I understand some people thought you were exaggerating when you were talking last week about aspartic acid and the bacteria that secrete it that is used to make aspartame.
[01:36:58.914 --> 01:37:04.219]  It's absolutely true, and something that's even more common than aspartame is the citric acid.
[01:37:04.219 --> 01:37:08.282]  Citric acid is produced by aspergillus niger, a fungus.
[01:37:08.282 --> 01:37:11.745]  It's excreted by a fungus that's submerged in molasses.
[01:37:11.745 --> 01:37:18.711]  And it's not only a fungus, it's a fungus that's been radiated with gamma rays to genetically modify it.
[01:37:18.711 --> 01:37:19.812]  It's a mutant.
[01:37:19.812 --> 01:37:22.474]  I mean, it sounds insane when you say that stuff, but anybody could
[01:37:23.466 --> 01:37:30.795]  No, we're eating total frankenfoods and I've read about that as well, but we know that the
[01:37:32.887 --> 01:37:39.550]  The excretion of these genetically engineered bacteria is a toxic, highly addictive poison, aspartame.
[01:37:39.550 --> 01:37:46.352]  And now you can't, at any store I've gone to, can't find any gum that doesn't have it, even if it's not sugar-free.
[01:37:46.352 --> 01:37:48.913]  They know it's brain-damaging people.
[01:37:48.913 --> 01:37:50.114]  It's so diabolical.
[01:37:50.114 --> 01:37:52.135]  I mean, they're just poisoning everything.
[01:37:52.135 --> 01:37:54.676]  And it's genetically engineered bacteria crap.
[01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:58.859]  And every time I mention that, I get emails saying, oh, it's ridiculous.
[01:37:58.859 --> 01:37:59.580]  No, it's not.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:08.507]  I mean, people just can't believe the magnitude of the elite playing God and doing everything they can to destroy creation.
[01:38:08.507 --> 01:38:15.853]  Meanwhile, selling us on a world government to save the environment by taxing carbon dioxide that's good for the environment.
[01:38:15.853 --> 01:38:19.737]  See, they know people are concerned about the Earth, because there are a lot of problems.
[01:38:20.871 --> 01:38:27.356]  And so they create a fake counterfeit of that, which is attacking something good to have total control.
[01:38:27.356 --> 01:38:28.757]  I appreciate your call, Kerry.
[01:38:28.757 --> 01:38:29.618]  Good to hear from you.
[01:38:29.618 --> 01:38:45.351]  It's just... There are thousands of genetically modified organisms that they've already made that we're eating.
[01:38:45.351 --> 01:38:47.272]  And I tell people this and they won't even go look it up.
[01:38:47.272 --> 01:38:48.293]  They'll just think it's not true.
[01:38:52.833 --> 01:38:54.614]  John in Washington, you're on the air.
[01:38:54.614 --> 01:38:58.275]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[01:38:58.275 --> 01:39:10.960]  The reason I was calling, I'm having a good fight here in Spokane, Washington, and getting out 200 DVDs, handing them out for free, thanks to you not copyrighting your DVDs.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:17.782]  But my question today was, how close do you think we are?
[01:39:17.782 --> 01:39:19.563]  You know, the FEMA camps scare me.
[01:39:19.563 --> 01:39:21.604]  I'm not sure about you, but...
[01:39:22.858 --> 01:39:24.522]  They're pretty scary.
[01:39:24.522 --> 01:39:26.326]  John, I appreciate your call.
[01:39:26.326 --> 01:39:28.531]  What scares me is letting evil win.
[01:39:29.349 --> 01:39:31.511]  We already live in a big FEMA camp.
[01:39:31.511 --> 01:39:37.936]  Checkpoints, license plate readers, the children are being trained to thumb scan to get their lunch or library books.
[01:39:37.936 --> 01:39:40.878]  They're being trained to be searched without warrants.
[01:39:40.878 --> 01:39:43.921]  We already have more people in prison than even China.
[01:39:43.921 --> 01:39:48.965]  And they've got the legislation to designate all the old military bases as FEMA camps.
[01:39:48.965 --> 01:39:50.886]  They will continue to destroy the economy.
[01:39:50.886 --> 01:39:54.009]  They will continue to incrementally have people go bankrupt.
[01:39:55.199 --> 01:40:05.625]  And then they'll advertise the government centers, you know, federal and state, federally funded state homeless centers that are little prisons as their FEMA camps.
[01:40:05.625 --> 01:40:10.908]  And they will pass legislation to arrest people for their political views.
[01:40:10.908 --> 01:40:15.370]  That bill is now introduced.
[01:40:15.370 --> 01:40:22.014]  I'm going to cover that after we finish calls here in a moment.
[01:40:22.014 --> 01:40:23.735]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:40:24.926 --> 01:40:27.948]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Maryland.
[01:40:27.948 --> 01:40:29.570]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:40:29.570 --> 01:40:30.710]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:40:30.710 --> 01:40:32.352]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:40:32.352 --> 01:40:33.913]  We've talked a few times.
[01:40:33.913 --> 01:40:45.321]  I'm the guy that helped with that VFW thing about the inventory that they took with the getting back the military firearms.
[01:40:45.321 --> 01:40:49.224]  That's right, all the old firearms from World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam.
[01:40:49.224 --> 01:40:52.487]  The government's registering them all with the VFW, of course, for confiscation.
[01:40:53.311 --> 01:40:54.652]  Alex, you've got to let me focus here.
[01:40:54.652 --> 01:41:04.858]  I'm nowhere near as good as you are, but I have what I believe might be a solution, a proactive, peaceful solution that everybody can take part in, that cares to take part in it.
[01:41:04.858 --> 01:41:06.539]  I'd like to share it with you.
[01:41:06.539 --> 01:41:10.601]  The first thing I'd like to say is there's a little problem with enemy identification we're having.
[01:41:10.601 --> 01:41:14.604]  You do a really great job of exposing all these things.
[01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:17.391]  I mean, what are we exposing now?
[01:41:17.391 --> 01:41:19.453]  I mean, they're doing it in plain sight.
[01:41:19.453 --> 01:41:31.100]  What we're really doing is just clarifying what they're doing and, you know, exposing what Benedict Beck, I mean, that guy, you can't tell me he doesn't have a college education.
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:34.763]  He's so subliminal in his methods and floating those pictures around.
[01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:38.958]  The stock market, it's completely controlled.
[01:41:38.958 --> 01:41:40.920]  Goldman Sachs is all over that.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:48.968]  You know, we've got to tell people who the enemy is because, you know, if you get punched in the face, your first reflex is to punch back.
[01:41:48.968 --> 01:41:58.377]  And whether it's happening for real or it's false flag, flying into the side of an IRS building, that's not the enemy.
[01:41:58.377 --> 01:42:00.139]  The enemy, I believe,
[01:42:00.922 --> 01:42:04.785]  And you can't name individual people because they'll take you off the air.
[01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:08.347]  But, I mean, we got the CFR and things like that.
[01:42:08.347 --> 01:42:12.510]  When you can direct people and tell them it's the bankers, who are the bankers?
[01:42:13.308 --> 01:42:17.391]  Well, there was actually a Bloomberg article, what, two months ago, guys?
[01:42:17.391 --> 01:42:18.572]  Will you pull it?
[01:42:18.572 --> 01:42:29.260]  Bloomberg arming, it's a Bloomberg article, headline, Goldman Sachs arming themselves for people attacking them, and that will just turn them into victims.
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:38.448]  We need to expose these criminals, not do anything violent to them, but the reason, notice it is the IRS, it is the military being attacked, and the reason
[01:42:39.608 --> 01:42:50.171]  We know this is staged for many reasons, but they preparatory, they prepared the public that there would be attacks on these very installations, then it happened so they could demonize their political enemies.
[01:42:50.171 --> 01:43:00.775]  And I've been saying it's the season for that, made the prediction, it's all come true, and triplicate, which just further concerns me because I know where we're going in the next phase and I don't like it.
[01:43:02.017 --> 01:43:04.919]  And, yeah, the UN's not being attacked.
[01:43:04.919 --> 01:43:07.260]  The Federal Reserve's not being attacked.
[01:43:07.260 --> 01:43:09.001]  Goldman Sachs isn't being attacked.
[01:43:09.001 --> 01:43:12.222]  The Council on Foreign Relations isn't being attacked.
[01:43:12.222 --> 01:43:13.523]  These people are not being attacked.
[01:43:13.523 --> 01:43:18.206]  The real system is not attacking themselves in these staged terror attacks.
[01:43:18.206 --> 01:43:24.889]  They're attacking their own police and military and enforcers and parasite suckers at the IRS.
[01:43:27.239 --> 01:43:34.027]  Because they want to get their culture to get in a more war-like mode against us, the people.
[01:43:34.027 --> 01:43:36.009]  And they're internally teaching them that we are the enemy.
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:39.000]  Go ahead and taser that scum if they talk back.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:39.841]  Go ahead and beat them up.
[01:43:39.841 --> 01:43:43.141]  Go ahead and torture them, because they want to kill you.
[01:43:43.141 --> 01:43:51.923]  It's meant to get them in an us-against-them mentality, and to also have people that are angry at the government say, Yay, Joe Stack!
[01:43:51.923 --> 01:43:52.804]  Yay!
[01:43:52.804 --> 01:43:58.585]  You know, the guy at the Pentagon, as some people have done, so that the establishment can get
[01:43:59.989 --> 01:44:06.294]  The opposition to the New World Order going against their minions instead of actually against the elite.
[01:44:06.294 --> 01:44:17.244]  And that it's also meant for just the general public to scare them away from joining a Tea Party or a Birther or a Truth Movement or an In The Fed Movement because, oh my gosh, they're connected to violence.
[01:44:17.244 --> 01:44:25.070]  So, we know the PSYOP, we know why they're doing it, but yes, the fact that you never see real globalist targets
[01:44:25.871 --> 01:44:28.032]  Being hit is another indicator.
[01:44:28.032 --> 01:44:30.554]  It's always their low-level minions.
[01:44:30.554 --> 01:44:33.136]  And so that's the bottom line.
[01:44:33.136 --> 01:44:35.577]  I have a small solution I believe would work.
[01:44:35.577 --> 01:44:36.638]  It's proactive, it's peaceful.
[01:44:36.638 --> 01:44:38.219]  Alright, well go ahead and get to it.
[01:44:38.219 --> 01:44:39.179]  Okay.
[01:44:39.179 --> 01:44:45.243]  What I believe, and every solution has risk, and it's all going to come down to the few in the end anyway.
[01:44:45.243 --> 01:44:48.205]  The few, that's all we've got is the few.
[01:44:48.205 --> 01:44:50.907]  We can wake a few people up, but most people are not going to get involved.
[01:44:50.907 --> 01:44:51.207]  I understand.
[01:44:51.207 --> 01:44:52.007]  What's your solution?
[01:44:52.007 --> 01:44:53.208]  I've got to move quicker.
[01:44:53.208 --> 01:44:54.509]  Well, the solution is...
[01:44:55.666 --> 01:44:57.607]  They want to take down the banks.
[01:44:57.607 --> 01:45:01.711]  People don't understand that it's not going to be a sudden crash.
[01:45:01.711 --> 01:45:04.312]  It's going to be a frog boiling in water.
[01:45:04.312 --> 01:45:05.553]  Just like Solante said.
[01:45:05.553 --> 01:45:08.756]  Now, you and Solante said, you know, that people need to get involved.
[01:45:08.756 --> 01:45:10.797]  Here's how to get involved.
[01:45:10.797 --> 01:45:13.800]  And you can't do it in their face.
[01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:23.127]  You have to do it by telling people that it's against the law to tell anyone to take the banks down.
[01:45:23.127 --> 01:45:25.008]  You can't cause a run on the banks.
[01:45:25.703 --> 01:45:31.266]  Now see, if you take your money out of the bank, you get to keep your money and you can defeat the world order.
[01:45:31.266 --> 01:45:35.749]  Alright, I'm going to have to put you on hold and come back to you.
[01:45:35.749 --> 01:45:39.111]  What's the caller's name?
[01:45:39.111 --> 01:45:43.293]  I'm going to go back to you in a minute, Mark, but I need to hear it cut and dry.
[01:45:43.293 --> 01:45:47.396]  Okay?
[01:45:47.396 --> 01:45:54.720]  I'm not sure what your solution is yet, but if you're saying, identifying or saying the banks are going down is illegal.
[01:45:57.796 --> 01:46:10.346]  The big central banks in October of 2008 said we were going to have a depression to destroy their competition and to terrorize Congress into going against the Bill of Rights Constitution and the will of the people.
[01:46:10.346 --> 01:46:13.948]  That was and is financial terrorism.
[01:46:13.948 --> 01:46:19.112]  That's what Fall of the Republic covers.
[01:46:19.112 --> 01:46:20.834]  And they brought down Iceland.
[01:46:20.834 --> 01:46:23.676]  Iceland said, no, we're not paying you the money it's not owed.
[01:46:24.892 --> 01:46:29.434]  Greece is totally controlled by Goldman Sachs, so they're going along with it.
[01:46:29.434 --> 01:46:32.896]  Total raping.
[01:46:32.896 --> 01:46:35.298]  Now go ahead, Mark, finish up.
[01:46:35.298 --> 01:46:36.738]  Okay, they're raping us.
[01:46:36.738 --> 01:46:42.702]  What I'm saying is, I mean, we can't re-elect any, we can't get honest people in because we're not communicating.
[01:46:42.702 --> 01:46:43.122]  Well, what is it?
[01:46:43.122 --> 01:46:45.163]  Okay, so that's the solution, we can't get honest people in.
[01:46:45.163 --> 01:46:46.544]  What are you saying?
[01:46:46.544 --> 01:46:51.506]  I'm saying that he who takes the bank out first keeps the money.
[01:46:51.506 --> 01:46:54.428]  They're trying to take the banks out, they're taking our money.
[01:46:55.029 --> 01:47:02.735]  If we were to do it, we the people, this would communicate to our lawmakers that we're on top of this, we know.
[01:47:02.735 --> 01:47:08.120]  So what we do is we get together with George Norrie and a few of the others that are willing to take the risk.
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:09.941]  They can't go for everybody.
[01:47:09.941 --> 01:47:16.386]  And we just tell people over and over again that it's against the law to withdraw all your money the week of June 19th.
[01:47:18.189 --> 01:47:29.900]  And if everybody gets the message that it's against the law to tell everybody to take their money out of the bank on June 19th, the week of June 19th, guess what people who are listening are going to do?
[01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:32.522]  And I mean, if you understand what I'm saying.
[01:47:32.522 --> 01:47:33.623]  They're going to go pull their money out.
[01:47:33.623 --> 01:47:37.426]  I appreciate your idea, but I don't agree with it.
[01:47:37.426 --> 01:47:43.292]  I'm not saying your idea is cockamamie, but there aren't silver bullets in this.
[01:47:46.909 --> 01:47:50.471]  The general public has a fraction of the money.
[01:47:50.471 --> 01:47:57.915]  The banks have created thousands of times fiat currency and credit what the entire planet owns and has.
[01:47:57.915 --> 01:48:03.437]  That's why they need to destroy the economy to make you go bankrupt so they get your property and land.
[01:48:03.437 --> 01:48:05.218]  It's all, it's a Ponzi scheme.
[01:48:05.218 --> 01:48:12.082]  But when they pop the Ponzi scheme, they get all the real material like Greece's islands and their infrastructure.
[01:48:12.802 --> 01:48:20.329]  Or Argentina's mines, and their roads, and their lakes, and their fields, and their national parks, and all of our ports.
[01:48:20.329 --> 01:48:23.993]  We're already deep into receivership.
[01:48:23.993 --> 01:48:32.161]  I do think getting your money out of the big Federal Reserve Banks is good.
[01:48:32.161 --> 01:48:37.106]  The Goldman Sachs, the JPMorgan Chase's, the Bank of America's.
[01:48:38.877 --> 01:48:43.383]  It is good to support local banks, credit unions, things like that.
[01:48:43.383 --> 01:48:48.169]  But see, when we talk about crash, they're not going to probably crash things overnight and not let you have your money.
[01:48:48.169 --> 01:48:50.532]  They're just going to devalue the value of your money.
[01:48:50.532 --> 01:48:55.178]  See, the human mind works from a psychological perspective.
[01:48:57.017 --> 01:48:59.579]  In a primitive way, like, how do I kill a Sabre 2 Tiger?
[01:48:59.579 --> 01:49:02.280]  Well, I get up here on a cliff and I throw boulders at it.
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:05.002]  Like, you know, you do one thing and it brings them down.
[01:49:05.002 --> 01:49:18.210]  And that's why the movies, it's all Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone or whoever the hero is.
[01:49:18.210 --> 01:49:23.233]  Going out and beating everything overnight with one big devastating swoop
[01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:29.531]  And that isn't how it works, okay?
[01:49:29.531 --> 01:49:42.054]  You identify that the banks engaged in financial terrorism to take over, that they bait and switched and kept the money and won't say where it went, that they're openly setting up a bank of the world and taking over the planet right now.
[01:49:42.054 --> 01:49:48.795]  See, I had incredible news to get to here, and I wanted to quickly go to calls, but that's why some days I don't take calls.
[01:49:48.795 --> 01:49:55.457]  Not that your calls were bad, it just burns up time and sometimes takes us in interesting directions, sometimes not.
[01:49:59.264 --> 01:50:03.828]  I have news here in front of me.
[01:50:03.828 --> 01:50:07.331]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[01:50:07.331 --> 01:50:09.513]  This is also in Atlantic Magazine.
[01:50:09.513 --> 01:50:13.897]  And again, we're going to give you a document cam shot here.
[01:50:13.897 --> 01:50:15.879]  For PrisonPlanet.TV viewers.
[01:50:15.879 --> 01:50:18.601]  A detention bill you ought to read more carefully.
[01:50:18.601 --> 01:50:19.582]  It's in the Atlantic.
[01:50:19.582 --> 01:50:21.424]  Here's the PrisonPlanet.com article.
[01:50:21.424 --> 01:50:24.987]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[01:50:26.897 --> 01:50:41.725]  And this says in Section 5 you can be secretly arrested, interrogated, tortured under the Enemy Belligerent Interrogation Detention Act, Prosecution Act of 2010 for any such matters as the President considers appropriate for U.S.
[01:50:41.725 --> 01:50:42.165]  citizens.
[01:50:43.092 --> 01:50:53.424]  So we'll talk some about this with Kaiser, but I'm going to have to push off now to the last hour for the big news blitz, where I'm going to break down the big picture here of what they're going to carry out and what they're going to do.
[01:50:53.424 --> 01:50:56.387]  I'll come back and we'll talk to Dustin, Monica, Zach, and Melissa.
[01:50:56.387 --> 01:51:01.213]  Please have your questions and comments ready quickly, because I need to be able to move on, but I still want to hear from you.
[01:51:01.213 --> 01:51:01.833]  It's just it's a Catch-22.
[01:51:05.413 --> 01:51:06.714]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:06.714 --> 01:51:12.320]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:12.320 --> 01:51:17.325]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:17.325 --> 01:51:22.911]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:51:22.911 --> 01:51:27.596]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:35.242]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[01:51:35.242 --> 01:51:36.343]  And here's the best part.
[01:51:36.343 --> 01:51:39.424]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:51:39.424 --> 01:51:43.045]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:51:43.045 --> 01:51:46.226]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.

[01:51:49.567 --> 01:51:49.747]  Remember,
[01:51:58.171 --> 01:52:02.076]  In a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:02.076 --> 01:52:04.459]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:05.225 --> 01:52:07.006]  Great news for pure water lovers!

[01:53:08.357 --> 01:53:19.784]  Crowded public places, global pandemics, and news reports of potential new strains of bacteria and viruses make you wonder, what if there was a germ-killing nasal spray that acted almost like hand sanitizer for your nose?
[01:53:19.784 --> 01:53:20.765]  There is!

[01:54:02.875 --> 01:54:03.415]  It works.
[01:54:11.107 --> 01:54:18.690]  Well, the IMF has publicly announced what we told you in December they were going to do.
[01:54:18.690 --> 01:54:28.733]  They are going to have every Western government pay masses of money to them to openly set up world government and force carbon taxes on everyone.
[01:54:28.733 --> 01:54:32.694]  Completely lawless and criminal.
[01:54:32.694 --> 01:54:36.475]  Continuing with your phone calls, we're going to get into that in the next hour with Max Keiser.
[01:54:36.475 --> 01:54:38.036]  Dustin in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:54:39.505 --> 01:54:42.007]  Hey Alex, I just want to say you're doing a great job.
[01:54:42.007 --> 01:54:46.350]  Your knowledge is just unbelievable.
[01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:49.732]  I refer to you as America's alarm clock.
[01:54:49.732 --> 01:54:52.294]  You're constantly waking people up.
[01:54:52.294 --> 01:54:55.497]  Keep up the good work and keep kicking ass.
[01:54:55.497 --> 01:55:00.600]  I also wanted to know what your thoughts were of the Discovery Channel.
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:05.704]  They're having that The Underworld Bomber premiering this Thursday.
[01:55:06.277 --> 01:55:10.101]  Well, I don't really pay attention, but the underwear bomber was admittedly staged by the government.
[01:55:10.101 --> 01:55:11.602]  They let him on the plane, protected him.
[01:55:11.602 --> 01:55:15.365]  Mainstream news to sell the body scanners in the police state.
[01:55:15.365 --> 01:55:17.067]  Because their target's the American people.
[01:55:17.067 --> 01:55:18.428]  They know we fly.
[01:55:18.428 --> 01:55:22.752]  They beta test their control surveillance grid when people...
[01:55:23.994 --> 01:55:24.974]  Are in the airports.
[01:55:24.974 --> 01:55:29.776]  Now they're going to move it to mobile brain scanning and naked body scanning systems.
[01:55:29.776 --> 01:55:38.238]  We've got video from Homeland Security coming up later in the broadcast and how it ties into dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[01:55:38.238 --> 01:55:39.319]  New bill.
[01:55:39.319 --> 01:55:40.939]  Thank you for the call.
[01:55:40.939 --> 01:55:47.801]  John McCain to completely get rid of any Bill of Rights, any habeas corpus, anything.
[01:55:47.801 --> 01:55:49.742]  And it says you can be interrogated.
[01:55:49.742 --> 01:55:51.962]  Oh, heaven help us.
[01:55:51.962 --> 01:55:53.483]  Monica in New York, you're on the air.
[01:55:54.275 --> 01:56:02.160]  Hello Alex, yes, you are unbelievably watching on the wall.
[01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:12.186]  And I say that not as just to affirm you, but God has equipped you to be able to do this, I'm telling you.
[01:56:12.186 --> 01:56:14.627]  And we see that.
[01:56:14.627 --> 01:56:21.131]  And this morning, I was just unctioned to just, I mean it was like really hard to press through to pray.
[01:56:21.707 --> 01:56:23.689]  And you will be lifted up in prayer.
[01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:30.615]  And not only that, when you first started the program, it was like birthing something.
[01:56:30.615 --> 01:56:38.982]  I think people in the spirit need to realize that they have been created to operate a certain way.
[01:56:38.982 --> 01:56:43.966]  And there is an evil will trying to force us to not resist it.
[01:56:43.966 --> 01:56:44.626]  It's a spirit.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:53.820]  And that's what it is, forcing down upon us to go along with the system, to be evil, to be worldly, to not have courage.
[01:56:57.128 --> 01:57:00.031]  I feel like today I have passed over another line.
[01:57:00.031 --> 01:57:04.595]  This has happened to me before in a progression of discernment and awakening.
[01:57:04.595 --> 01:57:11.621]  And the reason I'm waking up even more, and other people are as well, is because the enemy is rising right now.
[01:57:11.621 --> 01:57:16.866]  And God is trying to lift you up, the listeners, against this enemy.
[01:57:16.866 --> 01:57:18.988]  And I just realized the position I'm in
[01:57:20.643 --> 01:57:22.725]  And I just say, why God?
[01:57:22.725 --> 01:57:24.347]  Why is the world this way?
[01:57:24.347 --> 01:57:29.512]  Why do I understand this and a lot of other people can't if they could just know what I know?
[01:57:29.512 --> 01:57:30.373]  Yeah.
[01:57:30.373 --> 01:57:35.017]  And we don't need to know, like, not all people need to know all specific things.
[01:57:35.017 --> 01:57:36.379]  I really believe in the spiritual.
[01:57:36.379 --> 01:57:40.583]  You're dealing with a dimension where you're operating and you know.
[01:57:40.583 --> 01:57:42.325]  It's an all-knowing, true,
[01:57:43.422 --> 01:57:44.063]  You know what I mean?
[01:57:44.063 --> 01:57:49.551]  It's like God can download it to you and there is no fear in it when God's there.
[01:58:00.686 --> 01:58:05.970]  Pretty much what they're going to do next, I'm going to try to really formulate my thoughts and cover it in the last hour.
[01:58:05.970 --> 01:58:08.492]  It's just, it's like watching a train coming.
[01:58:08.492 --> 01:58:13.336]  You see it coming and you're saying, look, there's the train and people don't see it and it runs them over.
[01:58:13.336 --> 01:58:15.197]  How can they not see it?
[01:58:15.197 --> 01:58:18.239]  It's spiritual psychology is what it is.
[01:58:18.239 --> 01:58:28.207]  You have to understand and see a pattern in it in order for you to operate the way you do in the very thing that God allows you to do it and equips you
[01:58:28.894 --> 01:58:37.118]  You have to see it that way and it's a pattern and it's almost like you could set up a grid and see it and point by point pick out.
[01:58:37.118 --> 01:58:44.962]  Absolutely and that's what the globalists use their computers to do and also their master gives them the same discernment.
[01:58:44.962 --> 01:58:50.684]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:50.684 --> 01:58:53.886]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:55.740 --> 01:58:59.764]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:59.764 --> 01:59:03.008]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:59:03.008 --> 01:59:07.813]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:07.813 --> 01:59:14.200]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:14.200 --> 01:59:16.443]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:16.963 --> 01:59:17.283]  Tim Geithner?
[01:59:17.283 --> 01:59:17.784]  Bernanke?
[01:59:17.784 --> 01:59:18.164]  They're arsonists!
[01:59:18.164 --> 01:59:18.904]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:18.904 --> 01:59:20.585]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:35.874 --> 01:59:37.995]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:37.995 --> 01:59:43.157]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:43.157 --> 01:59:57.683]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at Infowars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:57.683 --> 02:00:00.064]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:00.064 --> 02:00:02.845]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:09.206 --> 02:00:10.888]  It is Monday, March 8, 2010.
[02:00:10.888 --> 02:00:14.751]  For the next 60 minutes, joining us from France is Max Keiser.
[02:00:36.152 --> 02:00:39.634]  I want to get into the state of the world economy with him but I also want to talk about the Joe Stack attack.
[02:00:39.634 --> 02:00:40.554]  A lot of evidence that was staged.
[02:00:40.554 --> 02:00:41.455]  The Pentagon attack.
[02:00:58.991 --> 02:01:04.274]  We saw preconditioning that 9-11 truthers were going to get violent before anyone had ever gotten violent.
[02:01:04.274 --> 02:01:07.676]  And I saw the media putting that out and I said, look, they're about to stage something.
[02:01:07.676 --> 02:01:10.358]  And now it turns out his parents warned.
[02:01:10.358 --> 02:01:15.581]  Turns out he's got government connections with weird government contracts and communications with the Pentagon.
[02:01:15.581 --> 02:01:18.402]  Same thing with Joe Stack.
[02:01:18.402 --> 02:01:22.345]  But regardless, they are really demonizing everybody right now.
[02:01:22.345 --> 02:01:25.687]  The Southern Poverty Law Center is attacking me every day.
[02:01:27.108 --> 02:01:30.650]  They're demonizing the Tea Parties, they're going after everybody.
[02:01:30.650 --> 02:01:36.714]  So we'll talk about that with Max Keiser as well, because the people are really starting to wake up.
[02:01:36.714 --> 02:01:39.155]  The banks control both parties.
[02:01:39.155 --> 02:01:47.480]  The good news is, I want to cover first, Iceland voters reject repayment plan, and how that dovetails with this AP article.
[02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:51.123]  IMF suggests how to raise climate change funds, pay money directly to them.
[02:01:52.190 --> 02:01:59.332]  So, we'll talk about the open expansion of this private banking world government with Max Keiser.
[02:01:59.332 --> 02:02:01.873]  Max Keiser, good to have you here with us.
[02:02:01.873 --> 02:02:05.214]  Hey Alex, good to be back with you.
[02:02:05.214 --> 02:02:07.295]  So much is going on.
[02:02:07.295 --> 02:02:11.936]  Let's talk in general terms first about the world economy.
[02:02:11.936 --> 02:02:18.679]  More and more analysts are saying, look, we've got 22% unemployment, we're really in a depression, things are getting worse, not better.
[02:02:18.679 --> 02:02:19.359]  Where is this going?
[02:02:21.315 --> 02:02:28.503]  Yeah, well, as we've talked about before, it's a global phenomenon, what I call the
[02:02:29.025 --> 02:02:33.748]  The global insurrection against banking occupation.
[02:02:33.748 --> 02:02:38.691]  We're seeing it in Iceland, we're seeing it in Greece, we're seeing it in countries all over the world.
[02:02:38.691 --> 02:02:42.694]  It started in 2007 with the beginning of the credit crunch.
[02:02:42.694 --> 02:02:46.496]  We first started to understand what was happening with the credit crunch.
[02:02:46.496 --> 02:02:53.701]  Remember, over there at Citigroup, the CEO of Citigroup, Chuck Prince, said, as long as the music keeps going, we're going to keep dancing.
[02:02:54.381 --> 02:03:09.736]  What he meant by that was as long as the Fed was going to continue to print money in ways that we could borrow and securitize our way into these phony profits, we're going to continue to do so even though our underlying basic business model is corrupt.
[02:03:09.736 --> 02:03:10.957]  Well, anyway, the music stopped.
[02:03:11.718 --> 02:03:14.440]  And this was the beginning of the global credit crunch.
[02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:16.341]  It was huge in 2008.
[02:03:16.341 --> 02:03:24.166]  There was a bit of a respite in 2009 because of the stimulus package, which was basically nothing more than a bit of a sugar high.
[02:03:24.166 --> 02:03:32.312]  And now in 2010, it's the resumption of this global crunch, this credit crunch, this deflation, this depression.
[02:03:32.312 --> 02:03:36.114]  And the people in various countries around the world are starting to fight back.
[02:03:36.114 --> 02:03:37.695]  They're fighting back in Iceland.
[02:03:37.695 --> 02:03:39.397]  They're fighting back in Greece.
[02:03:39.397 --> 02:03:41.238]  So it's not just in the US.
[02:03:41.858 --> 02:03:49.649]  That people are being disenfranchised by the tyranny that's going on on the level of the investment banks.
[02:03:51.559 --> 02:04:08.023]  And worldwide, I've seen the news, in Iceland, in Spain, in Greece, the media is implying that the anti-banking parties, the anti-looting parties, are terrorists or radical, and so look for events to be staged and blamed on the opposition there.
[02:04:08.023 --> 02:04:18.466]  But I don't think that these staged provocations, or in some cases the establishment allowing nuts to attack the government, is going to make the people love the banks.
[02:04:18.466 --> 02:04:19.686]  I think this isn't going to work, Max.
[02:04:20.973 --> 02:04:21.834]  Well, it's interesting.
[02:04:21.834 --> 02:04:36.444]  In countries like Greece and Iceland, the people understand specifically what the problem is, and they are pushing back directly against the bankers themselves.
[02:04:36.444 --> 02:04:40.887]  In the U.S., the message is very muted, because the mainstream media
[02:04:41.474 --> 02:04:48.298]  is able to get all of the activists to line themselves up into a circular firing line and they all shoot each other.
[02:04:48.298 --> 02:04:48.698]  Ha!
[02:04:48.698 --> 02:04:49.259]  Exactly!
[02:04:49.259 --> 02:04:57.584]  We're busy Republicans bashing Democrats, Democrats bashing Republicans, Republicans and Democrats bashing Alex Jones.
[02:04:57.584 --> 02:04:58.024]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:58.024 --> 02:04:59.525]  Basically shooting at each other.
[02:04:59.525 --> 02:05:00.946]  We'll be right back with Max Keiser.
[02:05:00.946 --> 02:05:01.486]  Stay there, Max.
[02:05:06.564 --> 02:05:10.545]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:10.545 --> 02:05:19.407]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:05:19.407 --> 02:05:24.028]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:05:24.028 --> 02:05:34.850]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:05:35.470 --> 02:05:44.992]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:44.992 --> 02:05:50.414]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:05:50.414 --> 02:05:57.915]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:05:57.915 --> 02:06:00.656]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:06:04.465 --> 02:06:09.028]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:09.028 --> 02:06:09.929]  Number one.
[02:06:09.929 --> 02:06:13.351]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:13.351 --> 02:06:14.212]  Number two.
[02:06:14.212 --> 02:06:19.115]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:19.115 --> 02:06:19.855]  It's true.
[02:06:19.855 --> 02:06:24.719]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:24.719 --> 02:06:25.559]  Number three.
[02:06:25.559 --> 02:06:29.141]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:29.141 --> 02:06:32.844]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:33.044 --> 02:06:33.825]  Number 4.
[02:06:33.825 --> 02:06:36.607]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:36.607 --> 02:06:40.270]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:40.270 --> 02:06:41.071]  Number 5.
[02:06:41.071 --> 02:06:45.215]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:45.215 --> 02:06:49.979]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions From Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:50.259 --> 02:06:54.441]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:01.084 --> 02:07:08.248]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[02:07:08.368 --> 02:07:11.230]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:07:11.230 --> 02:07:12.511]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:07:12.511 --> 02:07:13.331]  It's very real.
[02:07:13.331 --> 02:07:15.573]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:07:15.573 --> 02:07:17.214]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:07:56.865 --> 02:08:06.529]  Or visit Ecolablue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:08:06.529 --> 02:08:13.172]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:13.172 --> 02:08:16.153]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.563 --> 02:08:22.425]  Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com is our guest for the rest of the hour.
[02:08:22.425 --> 02:08:31.688]  We're going to open the phones up for people specifically with questions for Max Keiser at the bottom of the hour.
[02:08:31.688 --> 02:08:33.228]  It's very simple.
[02:08:33.228 --> 02:08:40.791]  Less than 20 big central banks openly are setting up world governments saying we're going to pay our carbon taxes to them.
[02:08:40.791 --> 02:08:46.233]  They go into nations, set up these derivative systems to get people deeply in fraudulent debt.
[02:08:47.318 --> 02:09:12.166]  They want the resources of the nation, they pay off the politicians to buy into the Ponzi schemes, but instead of going to prison like Bernie Madoff or Ken Lay, when they implode the economy they get even more power and they use paramilitary military industrial complex systems and television brainwashing to play the public off against each other and to suppress and demonize anybody else that wakes up.
[02:09:12.166 --> 02:09:12.526]  But Max,
[02:09:14.039 --> 02:09:21.267]  The reason I talk about myself here is that I have Time Magazine, New York Times, Newsweek, Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:09:21.267 --> 02:09:22.269]  They called me today.
[02:09:22.269 --> 02:09:26.493]  They're doing a cover story on their intelligence report demonizing me.
[02:09:28.851 --> 02:09:32.414]  They're misrepresenting who I am, what I stand for, what I'm doing.
[02:09:32.414 --> 02:09:37.498]  They're demonizing anybody that criticizes the banks as racist, which has nothing to do with it.
[02:09:37.498 --> 02:09:41.581]  They're making it about Obama, which is what they do.
[02:09:41.581 --> 02:09:50.067]  The right wing makes it about Obama, the left wing makes it about the Republicans, to where, as you said, we're a circular firing line all shooting at each other.
[02:09:50.067 --> 02:09:55.331]  They've got the people shooting at each other, but then meanwhile it's pretty creepy to now
[02:09:56.508 --> 02:10:10.327]  Have the London Guardian and just New York Daily News, the Austin American Statesman, no exaggeration, three or four big publications a day saying, I'm dangerous, I'm bad, Alex Jones has caused a huge psychosis globally.
[02:10:11.408 --> 02:10:13.229]  I mean, it's creeping my wife and I out.
[02:10:13.229 --> 02:10:18.112]  I mean, I can handle the heat in the kitchen, but I don't think of myself as that big.
[02:10:18.112 --> 02:10:29.178]  You had recognized previously, and I didn't get you on to talk about me, but I want your advice that I was super effective and that I was being mimicked, and you're more of a media expert than I. You've done it longer than I have.
[02:10:29.178 --> 02:10:31.119]  What do you say to what I'm saying here?
[02:10:31.119 --> 02:10:32.340]  Why do you think this is happening?
[02:10:36.894 --> 02:10:38.955]  Max Keiser's line dropped.
[02:10:38.955 --> 02:10:41.476]  I don't want to do Skype anymore, guys.
[02:10:41.476 --> 02:10:47.640]  Maybe a little bit better audio quality, but it just doesn't work to like foreign countries and places.
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:49.681]  And then we don't notice when the line drops.
[02:10:49.681 --> 02:10:55.104]  It's always good to ask a long question, because I mean, I'm here watching this happen.
[02:10:55.104 --> 02:10:56.444]  I'm watching this go on.
[02:10:56.444 --> 02:11:02.728]  I am seeing it, and I'm seeing myself being held up as the devil.
[02:11:03.874 --> 02:11:06.796]  Because I am identifying the banks as the enemy.
[02:11:06.796 --> 02:11:09.197]  I'm telling people, don't fight with Obama.
[02:11:09.197 --> 02:11:11.738]  Don't fight with the Republicans.
[02:11:11.738 --> 02:11:14.500]  The leadership is controlled by the same people.
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:17.821]  We have got to address the real issues.
[02:11:17.821 --> 02:11:19.922]  And we've got to do it now.
[02:11:19.922 --> 02:11:21.423]  And that's what Max Keiser is doing.
[02:11:21.423 --> 02:11:24.465]  Max Keiser, for several years on this show,
[02:11:25.370 --> 02:11:26.511]  That's cause you're so handsome!
[02:11:47.028 --> 02:11:56.677]  No, seriously, because you've been telling me on and off air for the last year or so that I was really having an effect, and I kind of put it off as you analyzing it.
[02:11:56.677 --> 02:12:01.361]  But I'm asking you now, why do you think this is happening?
[02:12:01.361 --> 02:12:11.891]  Well, clearly, as I've been saying, basically, there's this credit crunch.
[02:12:11.891 --> 02:12:12.992]  There's a credit collapse.
[02:12:13.630 --> 02:12:17.392]  And no matter how much money they throw at it, they can't re-inflate the bubble.
[02:12:17.392 --> 02:12:19.693]  They're trying to get the bubble going again.
[02:12:19.693 --> 02:12:20.853]  They can't do it.
[02:12:20.853 --> 02:12:24.555]  So, you know, the people are looking for scapegoats.
[02:12:24.555 --> 02:12:35.300]  You know, the classic propaganda model, going back, you know, to World War II, is first you develop a demagogue, and then you also develop scapegoats.
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:40.582]  So under, in Nazi Germany, for example, Hitler was the godlike figure.
[02:12:41.463 --> 02:12:46.124]  And the minorities that they've chosen, the Jews, were the scapegoats.
[02:12:46.124 --> 02:12:50.965]  Now, here we have Lloyd Blankfein over at Goldman Sachs saying he's doing God's work.
[02:12:50.965 --> 02:12:53.225]  He's clearly setting himself up as a demigod.
[02:12:53.225 --> 02:12:55.026]  He's in touch with God.
[02:12:55.026 --> 02:12:56.286]  He's doing God's work.
[02:12:56.286 --> 02:12:59.926]  And for the propaganda model to work, he's got to have scapegoats.
[02:12:59.926 --> 02:13:05.888]  And they give Al Gore awards, they give Obama awards for starting more wars, peace prizes.
[02:13:05.888 --> 02:13:06.748]  So that's the joke.
[02:13:06.748 --> 02:13:08.048]  They're God, we're bad.
[02:13:08.806 --> 02:13:18.048]  You need a scapegoat for the propaganda model to work, because people need to love, they need to form up with their captor, and they need to hate somebody.
[02:13:18.048 --> 02:13:20.588]  So that's the way the propaganda model works.
[02:13:20.588 --> 02:13:29.890]  So in America right now, if you're the scapegoat, they need somebody to be the scapegoat.
[02:13:29.890 --> 02:13:33.850]  But this is not unpredictable.
[02:13:33.850 --> 02:13:38.051]  This is the model that we're talking about, because since the credit collapse,
[02:13:39.099 --> 02:13:41.841]  ...has eliminated the easy money.
[02:13:41.841 --> 02:13:48.285]  What we have now is this wholesale transference of wealth, what's left, into the pockets of the top 1%.
[02:13:48.285 --> 02:13:53.689]  And they have to do it in a way that everybody kind of thinks is acceptable.
[02:13:53.689 --> 02:14:07.738]  And they do this by scapegoating one portion of the population, by setting themselves up as God, and that they need to continue to transfer wealth to themselves because they need... And that's the model that we've seen before in history, that's the model being used
[02:14:08.283 --> 02:14:08.823]  In the U.S.
[02:14:08.823 --> 02:14:10.584]  today.
[02:14:10.584 --> 02:14:18.689]  Well, Max, I mean, you have always identified that the big power structure, Wall Street and others, are in control of both parties.
[02:14:18.689 --> 02:14:29.154]  And you've been identifying the banks, and you talk about the revolt against the banking global dictatorship gaining steam, but they've been more successful in the U.S.
[02:14:29.154 --> 02:14:33.077]  playing different political groups off against each other, divide and conquer.
[02:14:34.036 --> 02:14:39.578]  Specifically, though, what do you see unfolding in Iceland and in Greece?
[02:14:39.578 --> 02:14:47.321]  I mean, for those that don't know, over the weekend, Iceland voters reject repayment plan because it's a fraud.
[02:14:47.321 --> 02:14:51.562]  Yeah, well, as these currencies... You know, remember the Icelandic krona collapse?
[02:14:51.562 --> 02:14:55.204]  I was in Reykjavik a year before the collapse.
[02:14:55.204 --> 02:14:56.804]  I was in the Hotel 101.
[02:14:56.804 --> 02:15:01.026]  I was sitting with bankers from what was still a viable firm, Lehman Brothers.
[02:15:01.539 --> 02:15:11.705]  And they told me that they were planning to attack the Icelandic Krona using derivatives, another financial product, and that they were going to take the Icelandic economy down.
[02:15:11.705 --> 02:15:13.166]  I made a film at that time.
[02:15:13.166 --> 02:15:14.167]  I spoke to bankers.
[02:15:14.167 --> 02:15:19.430]  I told them, you know, this economy is going to blow up in less than a year because you are in control of the speculators.
[02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:21.932]  You have lost control of your economy.
[02:15:21.932 --> 02:15:24.233]  And they laughed at me and they said, no, that's impossible.
[02:15:24.233 --> 02:15:29.897]  And of course, less than a year later, the Krona collapsed, the Icelandic economy collapsed.
[02:15:30.293 --> 02:15:48.109]  Now we're seeing the same speculators move on to Greece and move on to the Eurozone, where they say to Greece, you know, we're going to collapse your economy unless you give us some of your islands and that you give us some of your tourist attractions, which we can securitize and turn into derivatives and trade with each other for next year's Christmas bonus.
[02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:49.991]  And if you don't do that, we're going to crash your economy.
[02:15:50.379 --> 02:15:51.300]  I don't understand how
[02:16:09.634 --> 02:16:16.660]  He got away with holding the American Congress hostage like this and demanding $700 billion in ransom.
[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:17.961]  They mean, you know, the U.S.
[02:16:17.961 --> 02:16:20.483]  is crying about pirates in Somalia.
[02:16:20.483 --> 02:16:23.445]  What about the pirates on the floor right there in Congress?
[02:16:23.445 --> 02:16:25.167]  I mean, I don't understand the double standard there.
[02:16:26.428 --> 02:16:28.149]  Well, you may have seen this.
[02:16:28.149 --> 02:16:33.174]  It just came out today, Atlantic Monthly, and I'll give folks a document cam shot of this.
[02:16:33.174 --> 02:16:37.677]  It says, a detention bill you ought to read more carefully.
[02:16:37.677 --> 02:16:39.659]  Again, that's Atlantic Monthly.
[02:16:39.659 --> 02:16:45.124]  Here's the PrisonPlanet.com article, dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[02:16:45.124 --> 02:16:47.265]  This is a John McCain-Joseph Lieberman bill.
[02:16:47.265 --> 02:16:51.289]  It says, the Enemy Belligerent Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010.
[02:16:53.070 --> 02:16:57.691]  Allows the holding of citizens inside the United States for any reason.
[02:16:57.691 --> 02:17:09.073]  Section 5, any matters as the President considers appropriate with no evidence of any crime being committed extrajudicially by the military.
[02:17:09.073 --> 02:17:18.975]  And then now Homeland Security's put out a training video of these mobile Homeland Security body scanning vans that will also brain scan you and then they will claim with their quackery
[02:17:19.775 --> 02:17:20.516]  Well, it's because they're broke.
[02:17:20.516 --> 02:17:23.738]  The easiest way to make money in the world is in the prison business.
[02:17:23.738 --> 02:17:26.560]  And we know that the prison business in the U.S.
[02:17:47.828 --> 02:17:48.488]  It's thriving.
[02:17:48.488 --> 02:17:48.868]  The U.S.
[02:17:48.868 --> 02:17:50.889]  has the biggest prison population in the world.
[02:17:50.889 --> 02:17:51.549]  It's growing.
[02:17:51.549 --> 02:17:56.350]  The fastest minority in the United States in terms of growth is the prison population.
[02:17:56.350 --> 02:18:01.631]  We know that the private companies that own the prisons, they own the restaurants and the hotels that are located near the prisons.
[02:18:01.631 --> 02:18:08.173]  So when you go to visit your family in prison and you stay in the hotel and you eat in the restaurant, you're paying the same owner who owns the prison.
[02:18:08.173 --> 02:18:12.494]  We know that the prison owners lobby Washington to get laws passed to make it easier to put people into prison.
[02:18:13.260 --> 02:18:15.161]  And, uh, this is a huge moneymaker.
[02:18:15.161 --> 02:18:16.603]  It's the easy way to make money.
[02:18:16.603 --> 02:18:22.787]  You see, in the United States, unfortunately, they don't have enough self-confidence anymore to compete and do things like...
[02:18:23.567 --> 02:18:23.927]  I don't
[02:18:46.284 --> 02:19:00.531]  You know, the cutting edge of a technological revolution based on the fact that everybody wanted to be an astronaut, everybody wanted to get their science degrees, and America was competitive, and we were going to beat the Russians with Sputnik, and it was a very competitive society.
[02:19:00.531 --> 02:19:03.813]  But now, America's lost its will to compete.
[02:19:03.813 --> 02:19:11.057]  So they basically, all they want to do is build prisons and lock people up for money because they're broke, and they don't know how to pay up too much debt.
[02:19:11.621 --> 02:19:15.922]  You see, America is like the student with too much debt who gives up.
[02:19:15.922 --> 02:19:18.563]  Or the unemployed guy with too much debt who gives up.
[02:19:18.563 --> 02:19:20.004]  The entire country is like this.
[02:19:20.004 --> 02:19:21.044]  They have too much debt.
[02:19:21.044 --> 02:19:27.626]  So instead of trying to compete or to get a job and to compete on the world stage, they've given up.
[02:19:27.626 --> 02:19:28.986]  America has given up on itself.
[02:19:28.986 --> 02:19:32.528]  It doesn't have enough confidence to really want to compete on the world stage anymore.
[02:19:32.528 --> 02:19:33.768]  They're letting China and India...
[02:19:34.642 --> 02:19:37.744]  And these other countries take center stage.
[02:19:37.744 --> 02:19:39.266]  But that was the globalist plan.
[02:19:39.266 --> 02:19:40.927]  I read that from documents in the 70s.
[02:19:40.927 --> 02:19:50.134]  Move everything to China, get us in debt, turn us into a prison colony, implode out our economy, and all we'll provide is propaganda and military hardware.
[02:19:50.134 --> 02:19:55.298]  Max, let's look at the IMF's suggest how to raise climate change funds.
[02:19:55.298 --> 02:19:57.560]  This is really just their global tax.
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:20:00.022]  But how would private bankers sell a global tax?
[02:20:00.022 --> 02:20:02.003]  Oh, to save the penguins!
[02:20:02.003 --> 02:20:04.045]  And then we'll talk about where Max Keiser sees this going.
[02:20:06.414 --> 02:20:09.775]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[02:20:09.775 --> 02:20:17.978]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[02:20:17.978 --> 02:20:23.280]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[02:20:23.280 --> 02:20:26.262]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[02:21:06.343 --> 02:21:10.345]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:10.345 --> 02:21:13.586]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:13.586 --> 02:21:15.007]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:21:15.709 --> 02:21:18.390]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:18.390 --> 02:21:24.771]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:24.771 --> 02:21:30.312]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:30.312 --> 02:21:39.934]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:40.074 --> 02:21:42.415]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:42.415 --> 02:21:43.995]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:43.995 --> 02:21:46.456]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:46.456 --> 02:21:48.596]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:48.596 --> 02:21:53.738]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:53.738 --> 02:22:02.841]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:05.552 --> 02:22:06.573]  Gold isn't for you?
[02:22:06.573 --> 02:22:12.117]  Ted Anderson, President of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[02:22:12.117 --> 02:22:12.657]  I get it.
[02:22:12.657 --> 02:22:22.284]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that Social Security would be there for you.
[02:22:22.284 --> 02:22:23.685]  That's not what's happening.
[02:22:23.685 --> 02:22:28.068]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation.
[02:22:28.268 --> 02:22:30.110]  Or that the dollar wouldn't lose value?
[02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:32.151]  Or that your retirement would be secure?
[02:22:32.151 --> 02:22:35.534]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:22:35.534 --> 02:22:39.818]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[02:22:39.818 --> 02:22:41.419]  Since 2001, the U.S.
[02:22:41.419 --> 02:22:45.382]  dollar index has tanked 30%, while gold has risen 300%.
[02:22:45.382 --> 02:22:49.205]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[02:22:49.205 --> 02:22:50.106]  You should, too.
[02:22:50.106 --> 02:22:51.267]  Find out what they know.
[02:22:51.267 --> 02:22:54.570]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:22:54.770 --> 02:22:55.370]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:55.370 --> 02:22:57.751]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:57.751 --> 02:23:07.595]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:07.595 --> 02:23:13.918]  As the economy continues to decline, patriots across the nation are preparing for the worst.
[02:23:13.918 --> 02:23:15.798]  The world is changing fast.
[02:23:15.798 --> 02:23:17.559]  Are you fully prepared?
[02:23:18.343 --> 02:23:21.545]  Or will you be forced to eat government soup?
[02:23:21.545 --> 02:23:32.273]  At PatriotFood.com, we offer you 135 pounds of dehydrated food and 6 varieties of canned meat for half price.
[02:23:32.273 --> 02:23:42.940]  And at SurvivalistSeeds.com, we now offer 50 non-GMO varieties of vegetables and over 10,000 heirloom seeds.
[02:23:43.621 --> 02:23:48.465]  That's twice as many as our competition for the same price.
[02:23:48.465 --> 02:23:53.088]  Patriotfood.com and survivalistseeds.com.
[02:23:53.088 --> 02:23:56.030]  Food insurance, just in case.
[02:23:56.030 --> 02:24:00.634]  Owned by me, Big John Lipstam, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[02:24:08.917 --> 02:24:14.099]  Associated Press, today IMF suggests how to raise climate change funds.
[02:24:14.099 --> 02:24:30.146]  The head of the International Monetary Fund, Director Dominic Strauss-Kahn, says that nations should have a quota system based on their GDP, paid directly to the IMF and World Bank to save the Earth from climate change.
[02:24:31.451 --> 02:24:34.333]  And then they admit where the money goes and what they do with it will be secret.
[02:24:34.333 --> 02:24:36.115]  It has nothing to do with it.
[02:24:36.115 --> 02:24:39.277]  They couldn't get Congress to pass the bill, so they're just doing it.
[02:24:39.277 --> 02:24:42.220]  This is what they said at the end of Copenhagen.
[02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:45.242]  What's the thinking of these people globally, Max Keiser?
[02:24:45.242 --> 02:24:47.684]  Because the money isn't there.
[02:24:47.684 --> 02:24:49.486]  The people are going bankrupt.
[02:24:49.486 --> 02:24:52.208]  The unemployment's over 20 plus percent.
[02:24:52.208 --> 02:24:56.712]  And all these counties and cities and states are passing laws to tax food.
[02:24:56.712 --> 02:24:58.273]  Europe's passing more taxes.
[02:25:00.255 --> 02:25:05.198]  They're bringing in unlimited amounts of immigrants who then weigh down the welfare system.
[02:25:05.198 --> 02:25:08.640]  I mean, the banks want to bankrupt things.
[02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:15.705]  Well, they're looking for a new bubble, and they were able to turn real estate into a wildly successful bubble.
[02:25:15.705 --> 02:25:25.292]  That was after the Nasdaq bubble, which was after the long-term capital management bubble and the savings and loan crisis bubble.
[02:25:25.871 --> 02:25:28.213]  So they need to create, they need to find a new bubble.
[02:25:28.213 --> 02:25:32.055]  Carbon trading, they hope, will be this new bubble.
[02:25:32.055 --> 02:25:48.006]  If you get laws around the world forcing governments to buy into the carbon trading scheme, then you have a ready buyer, you have demand for the product, then you can collateralize and securitize that demand and create futures contracts and derivatives that you can swap with each other.
[02:25:48.755 --> 02:26:03.479]  And that's because the theory is that if you create a hundred billion and two hundred billion and a multi-trillion dollar derivatives bubble based on this new asset, carbon-based asset, then it'll be a trickle-down economy and it'll be back to the way it was in 2005 and 2006.
[02:26:03.479 --> 02:26:05.820]  All we need is another huge bubble.
[02:26:05.820 --> 02:26:06.760]  But in my opinion,
[02:26:07.287 --> 02:26:21.255]  The next big bubble to come down the pike is something that nobody's talking about right now, and it's going to be what we're seeing over there at Cantor Fitzgerald and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, headed up by Gary Gensler, who's a former Goldman Sachs guy.
[02:26:21.255 --> 02:26:24.017]  He's over there at Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
[02:26:24.017 --> 02:26:29.580]  They're going to authorize, starting next month, trading in box office futures contracts.
[02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:35.264]  And in my opinion, this has the potential to be the next huge bubble and bust.
[02:26:35.672 --> 02:26:36.913]  In the American economy.
[02:26:36.913 --> 02:26:40.475]  And we are unique in that we're going to see the creation of a bubble.
[02:26:40.475 --> 02:26:44.657]  It's like looking through the Hubble telescope and seeing the creation of a far away galaxy.
[02:26:44.657 --> 02:26:52.461]  Here we're going to watch a bubble go from zero to 500 billion dollars and then back to zero again in the course of 24 months.
[02:26:53.345 --> 02:26:58.231]  And this is going to be heralded as an amazing saving grace for the American economy.
[02:26:58.231 --> 02:27:06.441]  They're going to take box office receipts, which are roughly $10 to $15 billion a year, look at it domestically or worldwide,
[02:27:07.182 --> 02:27:17.185]  They're going to securitize that, and they're going to introduce hundreds of billions of dollars of boxed-office collateralized futures contracts, and this is going to be made available to millions of investors all over the world.
[02:27:17.185 --> 02:27:24.847]  And the bankers are going to make money on the way up, and then when it all goes bankrupt, they'll make money on a Hollywood bailout.
[02:27:24.847 --> 02:27:29.329]  Well, this is multidimensional, because first of all, there's three major pieces to this.
[02:27:29.329 --> 02:27:33.250]  First of all, this is an insider trader's paradise.
[02:27:33.789 --> 02:27:42.734]  This is a gangster's paradise being overseen by Gary Gensler, chairman of the CFTC.
[02:27:42.734 --> 02:27:55.642]  I reached out to them to try to warn them about what was going on here, but this is a former Goldman Sachs guy, he's been put in place by the banking cartel, and they're going to oversee with Cantor Fitzgerald this enormous, enormous
[02:27:56.158 --> 02:27:57.278]  A catastrophe.
[02:27:57.278 --> 02:28:02.899]  The insider trading possibilities are really unbelievable, like nothing we've seen before.
[02:28:02.899 --> 02:28:08.360]  Now we'll see films that they short where they'll sabotage the release.
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:09.780]  Well, that's the beginning of it.
[02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:11.961]  So let's say you've got two movies opening in two years.
[02:28:11.961 --> 02:28:15.901]  You know, Indiana Jones, the sequel, Spider-Man, the sequel.
[02:28:15.901 --> 02:28:19.942]  There's going to be... The news, the global news, treats this as real news.
[02:28:19.942 --> 02:28:23.003]  You know, the Hollywood news is covered before world news.
[02:28:23.003 --> 02:28:24.803]  The Hollywood news, it's the global current.
[02:28:25.598 --> 02:28:34.343]  And this is covered, you know, before, you know, earthquakes in foreign countries, before people declare war, they tell you what Angeli, Jolie, and Brad Pitt are doing.
[02:28:34.343 --> 02:28:36.945]  You know, this is the most important thing for most people.
[02:28:36.945 --> 02:28:41.007]  This is the basis of why this is going to be a huge, spectacular bubble.
[02:28:41.007 --> 02:28:42.227]  So they're going to be, of course,
[02:28:43.513 --> 02:28:49.457]  Shorting each other's projects in the market to sabotage each other's projects, that's one aspect to it.
[02:28:49.457 --> 02:28:59.744]  But also, we know that they're going to be colluding with each other, just like Goldman and JP Morgan, and these guys collude now in the derivatives business, they're going to be colluding in these box office futures contracts.
[02:28:59.744 --> 02:29:10.932]  And then when it totally implodes, the banks will fully control an industry they already dominated, and they'll be able to politicize it even more, because now there'll be all these city and county and state money invested.
[02:29:12.972 --> 02:29:23.017]  Well, I don't have... See, the thing about a con game, the way a con works, Alex, is the con has to want to be conned.
[02:29:23.017 --> 02:29:27.479]  You know, we've all seen the scenes of con men working their trade.
[02:29:28.064 --> 02:29:36.508]  When these box office features contracts are released to the public, people are going to be tripping over themselves to get involved in this new business.
[02:29:36.508 --> 02:29:39.429]  Because everybody wants a piece of the celebrity Hollywood book.
[02:29:39.429 --> 02:29:40.009]  Exactly!
[02:29:40.009 --> 02:29:43.351]  They'll say, I'm involved in the new Brad Pitt movie.
[02:29:43.351 --> 02:29:45.332]  Stay there, let's explain how the con works.
[02:29:45.332 --> 02:29:49.794]  Then they'll balloon it up, and then implode it, and it just continues.
[02:29:49.794 --> 02:29:54.216]  We have a Goldman Sachs guy setting up the grease collapse, now running the grease collapse.
[02:29:55.202 --> 02:29:59.145]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:59.145 --> 02:30:04.849]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:04.849 --> 02:30:07.871]  Hi, Alex has been encouraging you to get food.

[02:30:28.529 --> 02:30:30.691]  That's buy three, get one free.
[02:30:30.691 --> 02:30:33.594]  They'll take orders from now until March 22nd.
[02:30:33.594 --> 02:30:41.162]  The following week, they'll produce huge runs of the pre-ordered food, passing the savings to you in this buy three, get one free program.
[02:30:41.562 --> 02:30:44.824]  Folks, this is the best chance to stock up you'll ever see.

[02:31:04.720 --> 02:31:10.027]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:31:10.027 --> 02:31:12.771]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[02:31:12.771 --> 02:31:18.117]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:31:18.117 --> 02:31:20.881]  Friends, I hope that you will order shadow government.
[02:31:21.101 --> 02:31:22.582]  From Infowars.com.

[02:31:27.585 --> 02:31:38.752]  A new level in production quality and in information exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[02:31:38.752 --> 02:31:40.594]  This film needs to be seen.

[02:31:52.539 --> 02:31:53.941]  Shadow Government.
[02:31:53.941 --> 02:31:56.163]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.

[02:32:04.431 --> 02:32:08.994]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:08.994 --> 02:32:09.895]  Number one.
[02:32:09.895 --> 02:32:13.317]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:13.317 --> 02:32:14.178]  Number two.
[02:32:14.178 --> 02:32:19.081]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:19.081 --> 02:32:19.822]  It's true.
[02:32:19.822 --> 02:32:24.365]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:24.685 --> 02:32:25.506]  Number 3.
[02:32:25.506 --> 02:32:29.088]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:29.088 --> 02:32:33.011]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:33.011 --> 02:32:33.811]  Number 4.
[02:32:33.811 --> 02:32:36.573]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:36.573 --> 02:32:40.255]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:40.255 --> 02:32:41.036]  Number 5.
[02:32:41.036 --> 02:32:45.179]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:45.179 --> 02:32:49.942]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:50.242 --> 02:32:54.405]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:54.405 --> 02:32:56.186]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:56.186 --> 02:32:58.448]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:33:00.729 --> 02:33:12.317]  We're gonna take some calls from Max Keiser, get into other subjects that he thinks is important on his radar.
[02:33:19.778 --> 02:33:20.358]  Busted!
[02:33:20.358 --> 02:33:25.802]  Citigroup caught blatantly marketing itself as a casino, exactly what Conjure has been talking about for years.
[02:33:25.802 --> 02:33:27.743]  Here's another PrisonPlanet.com article.
[02:33:27.743 --> 02:33:32.767]  IMF head calls for huge global warming slush fund.
[02:33:32.767 --> 02:33:37.950]  It's like buying indulgences 600 years ago from the Vatican to get your family out of hell.
[02:33:37.950 --> 02:33:39.251]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[02:33:40.333 --> 02:33:44.876]  But they use the money to go in and buy off third world and first world countries and buy up our infrastructure.
[02:33:44.876 --> 02:33:49.280]  You pay them tax money so they can come buy up your roads and put toll roads on it.
[02:33:49.280 --> 02:33:54.344]  And then if you go bankrupt and can't pay to go on it, they put you in jail in one of their private prisons they own.
[02:33:54.344 --> 02:33:55.524]  I mean, the sky's the limit.
[02:33:55.524 --> 02:33:57.746]  We're going back to Max Keiser in just a moment.
[02:33:57.746 --> 02:34:04.992]  I want to remind listeners that when you get Fall of the Republic on DVD, we've got a free t-shirt deal, a t-shirt of your choice.

[02:35:07.727 --> 02:35:11.130]  I want to tell you about one of the sponsors that's made today's show possible as well.
[02:35:11.130 --> 02:35:14.092]  We're going back to Max Keiser of MaxKeiser.com.
[02:35:14.092 --> 02:35:16.454]  E-Foods Direct, ladies and gentlemen, the preeminent
[02:35:16.954 --> 02:35:22.896]  Highest quality, best price, non-GMO, non-hybrid, made right here in America, grown right here in America, Storable Foods.
[02:35:22.896 --> 02:35:24.616]  They got a bunch of different food lines.
[02:35:24.616 --> 02:35:30.158]  Totally prepared, freeze-dried, dehydrated, raw foods, special diets foods.
[02:35:30.158 --> 02:35:32.659]  They're the biggest, they're the best, they have the best prices.
[02:35:32.659 --> 02:35:35.680]  eFoodsDirect.com, this is where I get my Storable Food.
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:39.081]  eFoodsDirect.com, you'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:35:39.081 --> 02:35:40.241]  800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, or eFoodsDirect.com, and they've got
[02:35:45.723 --> 02:35:49.906]  Right, well, for the con to work, the person has to want to be conned, basically.
[02:36:13.604 --> 02:36:21.511]  In this case, you're conning them with the come on with Hollywood, by turning Hollywood into a Ponzi scheme that anybody can lose money on.
[02:36:21.511 --> 02:36:28.236]  But beyond that, there's another piece to this, which is the technology itself, the virtual specialist technology that I invented back in 1996.
[02:36:28.236 --> 02:36:41.427]  This technology, effectively, it was invented when I put it together to eliminate all of the front-running abuse that I saw on the floor of the stock exchange when I was working as a stockbroker.
[02:36:42.062 --> 02:36:58.592]  So it's designed to eliminate what's called the broker-dealer conflict of interest, because anyone who's buying and selling stocks professionally on the floor of the exchange, they act as both a broker, matching buyers themselves, but they also act as a principal in buying and selling for their own account.
[02:36:58.592 --> 02:37:01.414]  My technology eliminates that conflict of interest.
[02:37:01.414 --> 02:37:02.815]  It eliminates front-running.
[02:37:02.815 --> 02:37:05.997]  It eliminates what we call now high-frequency trading.
[02:37:05.997 --> 02:37:08.919]  That technology, that patent, is being warehoused.
[02:37:09.432 --> 02:37:09.933]  I don't know.
[02:37:28.669 --> 02:37:46.706]  So cancer is effectively warehousing a technology that could save Americans hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars that are lost by abuse on the floor of the exchange by these banks engaging in front-line... Instead it's come out that the big banks have special government-developed programs that allow them to actually cheat the market.
[02:37:48.210 --> 02:38:00.660]  These technologies, the high-frequency trading as revealed when they captured one of the defectors from Goldman Sachs a few months ago, they set up shop on the floor of the exchange and they siphon off billions of dollars.
[02:38:00.660 --> 02:38:01.962]  Goldman says they make $100 million a day.
[02:38:04.839 --> 02:38:05.880]  We're good to go.
[02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:23.141]  Max Keiser.
[02:38:39.429 --> 02:38:40.650]  Where does it end?
[02:38:40.650 --> 02:38:44.153]  Because we are seeing people say no in Greece, but it doesn't matter.
[02:38:44.153 --> 02:38:46.034]  Goldman set it up ten years ago.
[02:38:46.034 --> 02:38:52.259]  They're now running, as you know, but listeners may not, the bankruptcy there at the government level.
[02:38:52.259 --> 02:38:54.360]  They've paid off the politicians.
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:39:03.027]  Everywhere you look, it's Goldman Sachs piloting the fraud, and the other big banks nexusing in with them, help fund them and carry it out with them.
[02:39:03.027 --> 02:39:08.511]  But Iceland voters, and we have one of the leaders of the parliament, Jóns Dóttir, joining us tomorrow.
[02:39:10.117 --> 02:39:13.760]  They used anti-terror laws, as you know, but listeners may have missed it.
[02:39:13.760 --> 02:39:20.926]  In fact, there is a headline, UK Anti-Terror Laws Right Move Against Icelandic Banks.
[02:39:20.926 --> 02:39:30.774]  That's out of a British newspaper, where they're even seizing citizens' money, saying, well, your government owes us this money ten times the entire GDP of the nation.
[02:39:30.774 --> 02:39:33.977]  And now that they've said no, the banks are going, guess what?
[02:39:33.977 --> 02:39:36.899]  We actually owned assets in your country already that'll pay this off.
[02:39:37.680 --> 02:39:39.381]  Okay, that's fine.
[02:39:39.381 --> 02:39:41.343]  But they're still going to try some other chicanery.
[02:39:41.343 --> 02:39:47.907]  I mean, explain how Goldman Sachs, allied with the other big brokerage banks, takes down nations.
[02:39:47.907 --> 02:40:00.115]  And now we've got top politicians in the U.S., the leader of the Democrats in the Senate, saying the same thing's going to happen here, but saying we've got to do whatever the banks say in the next financial terrorism or we'll have a depression.
[02:40:00.115 --> 02:40:04.158]  But we know we're getting a depression by letting them continue to rape us.
[02:40:04.158 --> 02:40:06.659]  And we've seen all the headlines of our Bloomberg Financial.
[02:40:06.659 --> 02:40:07.240]  Listen, every day,
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:12.004]  With the bankers bragging, look how we got more power out of our last scam!
[02:40:12.004 --> 02:40:13.104]  Let's go even bigger!
[02:40:13.104 --> 02:40:14.966]  You know, the world is ours!
[02:40:14.966 --> 02:40:17.808]  I mean, it's just, it's so transparent.
[02:40:17.808 --> 02:40:19.970]  Well, Iceland is pushing back.
[02:40:19.970 --> 02:40:22.712]  You know, you saw that story that Iceland is going to introduce.
[02:40:22.712 --> 02:40:29.157]  They're trying to work out a new scheme now to make themselves a free press country.
[02:40:29.157 --> 02:40:36.783]  And Iceland now is going to raise the bar and be a country, the only country in the world, where people can go like WikiLeaks
[02:40:37.233 --> 02:40:39.695]  That's called the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative.
[02:40:58.455 --> 02:41:01.918]  Not only to the banking fraudsters, but to all the media that supports the banking fraudsters.
[02:41:01.918 --> 02:41:05.660]  How do you see the jackals that John Perkins talks about?
[02:41:05.660 --> 02:41:08.482]  What do you think black ops are going to do to try to stop this?
[02:41:08.482 --> 02:41:17.308]  Because one example of people standing up, you know, if one ant stands up, they can all stand up, and those little puny ants outnumber us a thousand to one.
[02:41:17.308 --> 02:41:22.292]  Well, that's why the people of Greece, they do get involved with the people of Iceland.
[02:41:22.292 --> 02:41:26.494]  That's why when you're talking on your show about the different groups in the U.S.
[02:41:26.494 --> 02:41:27.275]  that are struggling
[02:41:27.731 --> 02:41:28.673]  We're good.
[02:41:42.304 --> 02:41:48.547]  So when you add the global dimension, you're not talking about, oh, a few hundred thousand or a few million in the U.S.
[02:41:48.547 --> 02:41:50.668]  who are struggling against their oppressors.
[02:41:50.668 --> 02:41:56.151]  You're talking about millions all over the world who are struggling against basically the same group of bankers.
[02:41:56.151 --> 02:41:59.813]  Goldman Sachs is at the center of everything.
[02:41:59.813 --> 02:42:01.914]  They were in the center of the Greece problem.
[02:42:01.914 --> 02:42:05.556]  The New York Post just talked about it in 2005.
[02:42:05.556 --> 02:42:06.536]  They were behind a deal to
[02:42:07.757 --> 02:42:08.338]  We're good to go.
[02:42:32.336 --> 02:42:34.738]  Of those at the center of the problem.
[02:42:34.738 --> 02:42:43.343]  You're telling me that millions around the world can't figure out a way to decapitalize just one or two of the worst of the worst?
[02:42:43.343 --> 02:42:44.804]  I mean, come on now.
[02:42:44.804 --> 02:42:50.187]  Let me expand on that, but I want to ask you where you... I mean, were you dropped on your head as a kid?
[02:42:50.187 --> 02:42:51.528]  I mean, are you mentally impaired?
[02:42:51.528 --> 02:42:54.950]  I mean, not you, Alex Jones, but I mean, anybody listening to this show... No, I understand.
[02:42:56.198 --> 02:42:58.939]  But Max, that's what I'm trying to ask you.
[02:42:58.939 --> 02:43:05.442]  That's what I'm trying to ask you is I was listening to Bloomberg Financial Saturday night.
[02:43:05.442 --> 02:43:09.364]  I was on with Geraldo and I was driving home for 30 minutes listening to it.
[02:43:09.364 --> 02:43:17.268]  They had a former Goldman Sachs CEO on bragging that well the reason we're do so good is we have our people all over government.
[02:43:17.268 --> 02:43:21.330]  I mean they know they are a lawless mafia pirate group.
[02:43:22.806 --> 02:43:36.477]  You know, I remember in New York City, where I lived for many years, you had a guy named Don Gotti, the dapper Don, who was very blatant, walking around town in his $2,000 suit, you know, bragging about his criminality.
[02:43:36.477 --> 02:43:42.422]  Now you've got Lloyd Blankfein, who goes on TV bragging about his criminality, because they know they can get away with it with impunity!
[02:43:43.812 --> 02:43:46.613]  It doesn't mean they're doing anything less criminal.
[02:43:46.613 --> 02:43:50.554]  It's just that there's no regulations in place right now at the moment.
[02:43:50.554 --> 02:43:54.536]  The only way to get after these guys is you've got to attack it like a racket.
[02:43:54.536 --> 02:43:57.137]  You have to bring in anti-racketeering laws.
[02:43:57.137 --> 02:43:59.057]  But they control NORTHCOM.
[02:43:59.057 --> 02:44:01.158]  They control Homeland Security.
[02:44:01.158 --> 02:44:03.599]  They control the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[02:44:03.599 --> 02:44:07.120]  And they're demonizing anyone that criticizes them.
[02:44:07.120 --> 02:44:08.761]  But I don't see it working this time.
[02:44:08.761 --> 02:44:10.662]  I mean, why are they so arrogant?
[02:44:10.662 --> 02:44:11.762]  I mean, I've never seen
[02:44:12.282 --> 02:44:17.005]  And we've interviewed all these different financial experts, university professors, former federal regulators.
[02:44:17.005 --> 02:44:20.508]  They say there's never been fraud at anywhere near this magnitude.
[02:44:20.508 --> 02:44:22.789]  They cover it with all the republic that you appear in.
[02:44:22.789 --> 02:44:24.770]  I mean, why?
[02:44:24.770 --> 02:44:27.872]  Why do they think they're invincible?
[02:44:27.872 --> 02:44:30.714]  Well, you know, this is the ego.
[02:44:30.714 --> 02:44:36.198]  I worked on Wall Street, and it's very typical to find people who have a God complex.
[02:44:36.198 --> 02:44:37.599]  And especially after 9-11,
[02:44:39.776 --> 02:44:50.320]  There's this notion that they attacked the people on Wall Street, and for them to come back and re-establish their business, they were doing something more than just shuffling lots of paper and stealing money.
[02:44:50.320 --> 02:44:54.621]  They were now fighting some epic clash of civilizations.
[02:44:54.621 --> 02:44:58.863]  So they got into their head that they're doing something cosmically important.
[02:44:58.863 --> 02:45:04.485]  And once you get, you know, you inhale the sniff of this God complex, it's very intoxicating.
[02:45:04.912 --> 02:45:16.557]  So the people, this is why they keep referring to themselves as God, because they really believe that they're doing something extraordinarily important for the benefit of humanity as a whole.
[02:45:16.557 --> 02:45:18.238]  This is part of the propaganda model.
[02:45:18.238 --> 02:45:33.205]  You have to really believe you're God to put your head at the pillow at night and ignore the fact that you're impoverishing millions of people, and in countries around the world, you're causing mass starvation and colonization and massive problems.
[02:45:33.612 --> 02:45:38.468]  So they have this incredible God complex, and it goes right into the White House.
[02:45:38.468 --> 02:45:40.735]  The problem in the White House is, of course, you've got basically
[02:45:41.263 --> 02:45:49.369]  The way, like Barack Obama, for example, the way he attacks healthcare, if he looks at the healthcare stocks, if they're going up, he says he thinks he's doing a good job.
[02:45:49.369 --> 02:45:51.951]  If they're going down, he thinks he's doing a bad job.
[02:45:51.951 --> 02:45:53.091]  He's a day trader.
[02:45:53.091 --> 02:45:54.432]  Barack Obama is a day trader.
[02:45:54.432 --> 02:46:00.597]  He looks at all the America's policies in front of him, and he trades them, like a day trader who's just trading stocks all day.
[02:46:00.597 --> 02:46:03.038]  He has absolutely no idea he's a servant of the people.
[02:46:03.038 --> 02:46:04.419]  He doesn't have any idea what that means.
[02:46:05.760 --> 02:46:12.006]  He's just basically nickel and diming trying to end the day with a few more bucks than he started with.
[02:46:12.006 --> 02:46:15.709]  Max, I want to go to calls, but how do you see this ending?
[02:46:15.709 --> 02:46:19.152]  Not how you wish it would end, but trending outwards.
[02:46:19.152 --> 02:46:21.294]  We do see a lot of resistance forming.
[02:46:21.294 --> 02:46:25.377]  We see the bankers like Marie Antoinette saying, let them eat cake.
[02:46:25.377 --> 02:46:27.860]  How do you see this unfolding?
[02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:31.603]  You and I end up doing wildly popular cooking shows.
[02:46:35.302 --> 02:46:39.304]  We're gonna be on the Food Channel, and it's gonna be Alex and Max cooking chili!
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.242]  You know, and it's going to be, it's all going to be over.
[02:46:42.242 --> 02:46:44.264]  We're going to be, let's make a chili.
[02:46:44.264 --> 02:46:45.965]  It's called the America Chili.
[02:46:45.965 --> 02:46:49.609]  Hey, remember when America existed back in a few years ago?
[02:46:49.609 --> 02:46:52.711]  I'll be like, yeah, it was a great country back then, wasn't it?
[02:46:52.711 --> 02:46:54.853]  Yeah, put a little bit more chili powder in the chili.
[02:46:54.853 --> 02:47:00.779]  Yeah, by the way, after this show, the Chinese will be coming on, the new owners of America, and they'll be making some nice Chinese food.
[02:47:00.779 --> 02:47:04.662]  Stay tuned for the next show, Buy America, Post America, New China Land.
[02:47:04.662 --> 02:47:05.042]  Bye!
[02:47:05.763 --> 02:47:08.385]  Well, that really is it, but that's the bigger David Rockefeller plan.
[02:47:08.385 --> 02:47:10.066]  There's a method to this madness.
[02:47:10.066 --> 02:47:24.854]  They said in the 70s they would bankrupt us and move everything to China, and now China says they're the King Daddy, and the police don't care as long as they can taser somebody, and I guess we just fall into a big pile, is what you're saying?
[02:47:24.854 --> 02:47:32.118]  Well, clearly, on the money front, I mean, China has the ability to dictate policy in America because every time
[02:47:32.905 --> 02:47:33.646]  I think so.
[02:47:40.478 --> 02:47:41.119]  The U.S.
[02:47:41.119 --> 02:47:44.182]  sovereignty, again, it's all about market trading.
[02:47:44.182 --> 02:47:46.504]  And China owns an extraordinary amount of U.S.
[02:47:46.504 --> 02:47:46.764]  dollars.
[02:47:46.764 --> 02:47:50.728]  And I've never seen, Max, such saber-rattling.
[02:47:50.728 --> 02:47:56.293]  There are governments openly saying they're going to start dumping the dollar, that we're now an enemy.
[02:47:56.293 --> 02:48:00.677]  I've got the articles here today that we're no longer on good stead with the U.S.
[02:48:00.677 --> 02:48:02.279]  Why is China saying all this?
[02:48:04.366 --> 02:48:13.352]  Well, because they want to now let the world know that they're in charge and that people should not be doing deals with the U.S.
[02:48:13.352 --> 02:48:15.414]  Russia shouldn't be doing deals with the U.S.
[02:48:15.414 --> 02:48:19.697]  Iran, of course, they're doing deals with Iran even though America's stable rattling with Iran.
[02:48:20.287 --> 02:48:23.029]  They want to let the world know that they're open for business.
[02:48:23.029 --> 02:48:25.490]  All over Africa, they're buying strategic assets.
[02:48:25.490 --> 02:48:27.231]  They're buying oil-related assets.
[02:48:27.231 --> 02:48:33.155]  But China wants to let the world know that, listen, don't believe that malarkey coming out of the U.S., that they're still in control.
[02:48:33.155 --> 02:48:34.115]  We're in control.
[02:48:34.115 --> 02:48:34.936]  We're doing deals.
[02:48:34.936 --> 02:48:36.016]  We've got lots of money.
[02:48:36.016 --> 02:48:37.137]  We're open for business.
[02:48:37.137 --> 02:48:38.778]  They have to get that message out.
[02:48:39.318 --> 02:48:53.701]  And that's why they, every time they get a chance, whether it's to go up against Google or go up against whomever, they want to let the world know that they're open for business and for the world to focus their attention on what's possible now in China.
[02:48:53.701 --> 02:49:01.702]  And they also, on every front, say no to the UN.
[02:49:01.702 --> 02:49:03.703]  They're saying no to the carbon taxes.
[02:49:04.673 --> 02:49:14.178]  They're saying no to all of this and saying, you Americans go ahead and raise carbon taxes and then your banks are going to invest your money with us.
[02:49:14.178 --> 02:49:16.619]  Go ahead, idiots.
[02:49:16.619 --> 02:49:22.642]  China's not spending 50% of any of the, you know, in the U.S.
[02:49:22.642 --> 02:49:24.963]  they spend 50% of tax revenue.
[02:49:24.963 --> 02:49:26.384]  One and a half trillion.
[02:49:27.112 --> 02:49:28.294]  I don't think so.
[02:49:38.140 --> 02:49:41.363]  You know, China doesn't need to send tanks to California.
[02:49:41.363 --> 02:49:42.404]  They're just going to dump U.S.
[02:49:42.404 --> 02:49:43.044]  Treasury bonds.
[02:49:43.044 --> 02:49:48.709]  They're not going to waste money buying, you know, infrastructure, except military infrastructure, unless it makes good TV shows.
[02:49:48.709 --> 02:49:51.811]  No, they're actually building a real infrastructure.
[02:49:51.811 --> 02:50:01.199]  They're actually building a real infrastructure, and instead our infrastructure is body scanners, checkpoints, pot-bellied cops with machine guns.
[02:50:03.024 --> 02:50:03.504]  The U.S.
[02:50:03.504 --> 02:50:07.845]  just put in its first high-speed train in California.
[02:50:07.845 --> 02:50:13.206]  China, I think, already has enough high-speed train track to go from New York to L.A.
[02:50:13.206 --> 02:50:13.666]  or something.
[02:50:13.666 --> 02:50:14.686]  It's something extraordinary.
[02:50:14.686 --> 02:50:17.827]  They're putting in high-speed train tracks.
[02:50:17.827 --> 02:50:21.387]  But they're clearly in control.
[02:50:21.387 --> 02:50:25.808]  And the solutions for the U.S.
[02:50:25.808 --> 02:50:27.408]  are not hard to figure out.
[02:50:27.408 --> 02:50:30.369]  But the problem is you've got this incredible bottleneck because
[02:50:30.856 --> 02:50:36.798]  You've got the banks and the politicians that have fused together to create this enormous hurdle.
[02:50:36.798 --> 02:50:49.562]  Well, the other big problem, Max, we're going to break, come back with some calls, is the Pentagon says, well, we're going to expand worldwide, but even if we implode, we'll make the American people our enemy and continue our domination here.
[02:50:49.562 --> 02:50:58.365]  And they'd like to live like Somalia, where the Pentagon, with bankers above them, just sits on top of big slag heap with all of us walking around in loincloths.
[02:50:59.105 --> 02:51:05.889]  And so the Pentagon's just taking over the roads, the schools, the police, body scanners, license plate readers.
[02:51:05.889 --> 02:51:09.511]  You just might be only a few meals away from anarchy.
[02:51:09.511 --> 02:51:12.753]  Look at the recent world events and even the economic crisis.
[02:51:12.753 --> 02:51:16.335]  The time to prepare yourself and your family is now.
[02:51:16.335 --> 02:51:24.199]  For one week only, Readymade Resources offers all GCN listeners 25% off on all Mountain House case lots.

[02:51:52.947 --> 02:51:53.187]  Hurry!
[02:51:53.187 --> 02:51:53.908]  Sale ends March 15th.
[02:52:06.329 --> 02:52:10.356]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:10.356 --> 02:52:13.602]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:13.602 --> 02:52:15.025]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:15.866 --> 02:52:18.387]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:18.387 --> 02:52:24.789]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:24.789 --> 02:52:29.971]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:29.971 --> 02:52:39.934]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:40.074 --> 02:52:42.416]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:42.416 --> 02:52:44.017]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:44.017 --> 02:52:46.460]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:46.460 --> 02:52:48.601]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:48.601 --> 02:52:53.746]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:52:53.746 --> 02:52:58.750]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.

[02:53:04.864 --> 02:53:08.405]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[02:53:08.405 --> 02:53:10.706]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[02:53:10.706 --> 02:53:11.566]  Don't!
[02:53:11.566 --> 02:53:15.008]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[02:53:15.008 --> 02:53:22.130]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'

[02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:39.880]  Herb K was right.

[02:53:43.063 --> 02:53:44.404]  What have you got to lose?

[02:53:57.052 --> 02:54:01.716]  Max Keiser will be with us five minutes into the next hour.
[02:54:01.716 --> 02:54:03.378]  MaxKeiser.com is his website.
[02:54:03.378 --> 02:54:07.803]  A lot of great information there.
[02:54:07.803 --> 02:54:10.526]  You can also watch his TV show.
[02:54:10.526 --> 02:54:11.467]  He's got it linked up there.
[02:54:20.063 --> 02:54:22.724]  We are taking your phone calls now.
[02:54:22.724 --> 02:54:23.624]  It's simple.
[02:54:23.624 --> 02:54:26.225]  Either the big central banks go or we go.
[02:54:26.225 --> 02:54:30.846]  They openly say they're setting up world government, they're going to run our lives, cut off our resources.
[02:54:30.846 --> 02:54:43.630]  It's a total nightmare and I'm just here covering it and I've got every major newspaper and government operation demonizing the hell out of me right now because we are effective and they know that we know they're criminals.
[02:54:43.630 --> 02:54:48.011]  And coming up next hour I'm going to get into all the news that I haven't even covered yet.
[02:54:48.011 --> 02:54:49.132]  It's just unspeakably insane.
[02:54:51.271 --> 02:54:52.711]  Let's go to Melissa in Mass.
[02:54:52.711 --> 02:54:53.772]  You're on with Max Keiser.
[02:54:53.772 --> 02:54:54.152]  Go ahead.
[02:54:54.152 --> 02:54:55.692]  Hi Alex.
[02:54:55.692 --> 02:54:56.092]  Hi Max.
[02:54:56.092 --> 02:54:58.213]  Thank you so much for taking my call.
[02:54:58.213 --> 02:55:00.353]  I have two really quick things to know.
[02:55:00.353 --> 02:55:01.774]  I used to work at TD Bank.
[02:55:01.774 --> 02:55:04.054]  I worked there for four years.
[02:55:04.054 --> 02:55:13.897]  And one thing is that they utilize a website blocker that's intended to be used for employees so they don't look at sexually vulgar or sexually explicit websites.
[02:55:13.897 --> 02:55:18.758]  They block both InfoWars and Prison Planet and list it for militant behavior.
[02:55:18.758 --> 02:55:19.719]  So I thought that was interesting.
[02:55:19.719 --> 02:55:20.599]  I thought that you should know that.
[02:55:21.181 --> 02:55:28.831]  Second thing, this new overdraft fee revenue law that's going into effect July 1st, is there a bottom line there that we're not seeing?
[02:55:28.831 --> 02:55:30.994]  I know how important overdraft fees are to the big banks.
[02:55:31.547 --> 02:55:34.189]  Yeah, this is a question that I'd throw in for Max.
[02:55:34.189 --> 02:55:39.894]  They're announcing that they may not insure your money markets.
[02:55:39.894 --> 02:55:42.757]  They're announcing they may keep your money for seven days.
[02:55:42.757 --> 02:55:45.960]  They're openly talking about dollar devaluations.
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:50.964]  They're openly saying they may take people's pension funds and the government will then give you part of it back.
[02:55:50.964 --> 02:55:52.886]  Max Keiser.
[02:55:52.886 --> 02:55:57.430]  Yeah, well, this is just every week we get more information that's pointing into
[02:55:58.502 --> 02:55:59.162]  We're good to go.
[02:56:18.035 --> 02:56:22.838]  And they think Northcom, just like they're doing in Greece, will allow them to take everybody's money?
[02:56:45.276 --> 02:56:51.262]  Right, and they're using this propaganda model that we're God, and we need to fight the bad guys, and if you resist, you're a scapegoat.
[02:56:51.262 --> 02:56:52.664]  You know, talk about Citibank.
[02:56:52.664 --> 02:57:00.352]  Citibank last week, it was disclosed that this group, it's a new group called Fabulous, it serves the gay community.
[02:57:00.731 --> 02:57:03.713]  The Citigroup said, we don't like your material, we're going to freeze your account.
[02:57:03.713 --> 02:57:05.715]  So here they're scapegoating the gay community.
[02:57:05.715 --> 02:57:06.956]  When did we see that last?
[02:57:06.956 --> 02:57:09.098]  Oh, the 1930s in Nazi Germany?
[02:57:09.098 --> 02:57:20.947]  And again, they pick a group they think is unpopular with most people to set the precedent, like, oh, we're just going to secretly arrest Americans that are Muslims, and now they've got a bill for everybody!
[02:57:20.947 --> 02:57:25.811]  It's classic scapegoating, you know, 101, scapegoating 101.
[02:57:25.811 --> 02:57:26.631]  Thank you, Melissa.
[02:57:26.631 --> 02:57:28.633]  Pastor in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:57:28.633 --> 02:57:29.954]  Let me just add something to that.
[02:57:30.307 --> 02:57:35.294]  You know, um, do you remember in America we had the Jim Crow laws, which were discriminatory laws?
[02:57:35.294 --> 02:57:35.414]  Yes.
[02:57:35.414 --> 02:57:39.680]  You know, and some people can only use this, you know, it's the colored-only bathroom, right?
[02:57:39.680 --> 02:57:43.805]  Uh, colored-only sections in the restaurant, and at the back of the bus.
[02:57:43.805 --> 02:57:45.748]  Well, the same thing is being applied to interest rates.
[02:57:46.149 --> 02:57:52.136]  If you're a Goldman, you get to borrow money at 1% and get a free rate of return at 17%.
[02:57:52.136 --> 02:57:57.882]  If you're everybody else, you have to borrow money at 17%, and the most you'll ever get on that is 1% on your money.
[02:57:57.882 --> 02:57:59.484]  Well that's like the EU!
[02:57:59.484 --> 02:58:01.486]  It's a Jim Crow law using interest rates.
[02:58:01.486 --> 02:58:04.550]  They're discriminating against anyone who's not a Goldman Sachs employee.
[02:58:04.550 --> 02:58:05.991]  Get in the back of the bus!
[02:58:05.991 --> 02:58:06.512]  And shut up!
[02:58:08.001 --> 02:58:13.746]  Well, in the EU, the bureaucrats have a 17% income tax and everybody else has a 50%.
[02:58:13.746 --> 02:58:16.748]  And it's the same thing expanding on every level.
[02:58:16.748 --> 02:58:19.231]  Now they have these Homeland Security no-fly lists.
[02:58:19.231 --> 02:58:20.672]  It'll be no work list.
[02:58:20.672 --> 02:58:24.055]  And they just magically put whoever they want on it with no evidence.
[02:58:24.055 --> 02:58:30.660]  I mean, it's just a... But don't worry, we'll arrest some college students that threw some cotton balls out on the ground.
[02:58:30.660 --> 02:58:32.242]  That means black people pick cotton.
[02:58:34.241 --> 02:58:40.047]  We'll arrest them for terrorism, but then we'll abort 52% of the black people.
[02:58:40.047 --> 02:58:40.908]  Max Keiser, stay there.
[02:58:40.908 --> 02:58:42.669]  Let's jam in a few calls in the next five minutes.
[02:58:42.669 --> 02:58:46.693]  Back in 70 seconds.

[03:00:00.350 --> 03:00:03.092]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:10.322 --> 03:00:12.403]  All right, we're into the final hour.
[03:00:12.403 --> 03:00:21.008]  I'm not going to take any more calls until the very end of the show if I have time because I've got a lot of news and information that must be covered.
[03:00:21.008 --> 03:00:22.228]  Max Keiser is our guest.
[03:00:22.228 --> 03:00:23.729]  Let's go to Pastor in Ohio.
[03:00:23.729 --> 03:00:25.650]  Quickly, go ahead, you're on the air.
[03:00:25.650 --> 03:00:30.873]  Yeah, Alex, I've talked to you before and I wanted to share something with you and Max.
[03:00:30.873 --> 03:00:37.096]  You know, one thing I noticed every time you guys come on, I mean, it's fantastic.
[03:00:37.096 --> 03:00:39.397]  You guys have the news right up front.
[03:00:40.171 --> 03:00:46.794]  And I want to thank you for that because you allow us to share that with other people.
[03:00:46.794 --> 03:00:49.215]  And I do that with my congregation.
[03:00:49.215 --> 03:00:51.196]  Well, we're all in this together, buddy.
[03:00:51.196 --> 03:00:52.456]  Yes, sir, we are.
[03:00:52.456 --> 03:00:55.598]  And I'll tell you what, you know, one thing I noticed
[03:00:56.849 --> 03:00:59.250]  I noticed the different things that you're saying.
[03:00:59.250 --> 03:01:01.232]  Trust me, Alex, you are not alone.
[03:01:01.232 --> 03:01:12.358]  Even though you may not hear and know the people that are standing with you, you guys that are getting the news out there to us because you guys have the resources and we don't.
[03:01:12.358 --> 03:01:13.739]  Well, Pastor, let me be clear.
[03:01:13.739 --> 03:01:16.760]  I know the world's on fire with people waking up.
[03:01:16.760 --> 03:01:18.161]  Max knows that.
[03:01:18.161 --> 03:01:22.764]  I just can't believe people aren't even waking up faster because it's so outrageous.
[03:01:22.764 --> 03:01:23.884]  But I appreciate your call.
[03:01:25.385 --> 03:01:29.307]  I mean, Max, you see the huge awakening, don't you?
[03:01:29.307 --> 03:01:46.976]  Well, I'm curious to see exactly how the huge awakening will happen, what form it'll take, because, you know, in the 60s, we had a huge awakening, and it took the form of a musical revolution and a social revolution, and then, basically, society went back to sleep.
[03:01:46.976 --> 03:01:48.436]  You know, here's something very interesting.
[03:01:48.436 --> 03:01:53.859]  I see in Berkeley, California, the students now are protesting against these rise in rates
[03:01:54.372 --> 03:01:56.593]  Which, of course, is great that they're protesting that.
[03:01:56.593 --> 03:02:07.921]  But where were the students two years ago when they were all supporting the Iraq War invasion, and they were all tattletailing on their professors who were against the Iraq War invasion?
[03:02:07.921 --> 03:02:14.845]  Remember that, two or three years ago, when professors said, well, all the money that was spent in Iraq, they don't have any money for education.
[03:02:14.845 --> 03:02:17.026]  Now they're protesting because they don't have money for education.
[03:02:17.026 --> 03:02:17.987]  Well, tough luck!
[03:02:17.987 --> 03:02:22.590]  You should have spent, you know, against the Iraq War two or three years ago, and now you have money for education!
[03:02:23.120 --> 03:02:24.702]  Let's talk to Petunia in Texas.
[03:02:24.702 --> 03:02:27.426]  Petunia, you're on the air with Max Keiser.
[03:02:27.426 --> 03:02:28.187]  Hi, thank you.
[03:02:28.187 --> 03:02:29.830]  Thank you for taking the call.
[03:02:29.830 --> 03:02:36.779]  Just very quickly, I think that one of the things that we need to do is to bring a third party, like the Constitution Party of Texas.
[03:02:36.779 --> 03:02:39.203]  We're trying to get ballot access right now.
[03:02:39.913 --> 03:02:41.214]  And it's not easy.
[03:02:41.214 --> 03:02:46.417]  You know, the two big parties, the Republicans and the Democrats, have a little monopoly going on.
[03:02:46.417 --> 03:02:53.140]  Well, the public better get out there and realize that we needed to take our states back against this takeover, and it needs to be done now.
[03:02:53.140 --> 03:02:56.062]  Do you have a question for Max Keiser?
[03:02:56.062 --> 03:02:58.263]  Well, um... You don't?
[03:02:58.263 --> 03:02:59.104]  I appreciate your call.
[03:02:59.104 --> 03:03:00.304]  I gotta let you go, okay?
[03:03:00.304 --> 03:03:02.205]  I told you, these are calls for Max Keiser.
[03:03:02.205 --> 03:03:03.886]  You can call back another time on that.
[03:03:03.886 --> 03:03:05.307]  Mike in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[03:03:05.307 --> 03:03:05.667]  Go ahead.
[03:03:10.583 --> 03:03:26.132]  I, in all the polls, when it comes to 9-11, it seems like there's an overwhelming majority of the public on these polls that want a new investigation or otherwise don't believe the government.
[03:03:26.132 --> 03:03:29.334]  Yeah, and the media says we're terrorists, the majority of America.
[03:03:29.334 --> 03:03:32.016]  Here's my question.
[03:03:32.016 --> 03:03:34.397]  Why don't, why is there a candidate?
[03:03:35.069 --> 03:03:40.953]  That is reading these polls and running on a 9-11 investigation platform.
[03:03:40.953 --> 03:03:42.474]  Right, great question.
[03:03:42.474 --> 03:03:43.955]  Gotta get that to Max Keiser.
[03:03:43.955 --> 03:03:45.376]  Max?
[03:03:45.376 --> 03:03:47.538]  Well, apparently New Hampshire is going for it.
[03:03:47.538 --> 03:03:51.541]  New Hampshire is now going to do a full scale and they're going to put something on the ballot.
[03:03:51.541 --> 03:03:55.483]  They're going to do a non-binding look into this event.
[03:03:55.483 --> 03:03:59.266]  And so there are pockets, you know, states are picking up the ball.
[03:04:00.046 --> 03:04:11.910]  That's right, they've got what, now it's a majority of their towns signing on, because in New Hampshire they have right to revolt, right to revolt laws, where they can force it onto the ballot, and at the statehouse if the towns want it.
[03:04:11.910 --> 03:04:17.132]  Yeah, now why, now let's say if I'm in America, I would say, you know what, I think I'll move to New Hampshire.
[03:04:17.132 --> 03:04:20.373]  Let New Hampshire reap the benefit of wanting to pursue this.
[03:04:20.373 --> 03:04:22.294]  And move to New Hampshire, boost their economy.
[03:04:22.294 --> 03:04:23.394]  Get a job in New Hampshire.
[03:04:23.394 --> 03:04:26.255]  Make New Hampshire, you know, the new California.
[03:04:26.255 --> 03:04:28.596]  Because they're not afraid to look at stuff.
[03:04:28.596 --> 03:04:29.356]  Go to New Hampshire!
[03:04:30.492 --> 03:04:32.132]  Well, in closing, Max, well said.
[03:04:32.132 --> 03:04:35.473]  I'm glad you brought that up, because I mentioned it last week, but it hardly talked about it.
[03:04:35.473 --> 03:04:36.913]  I want to get some people on from New Hampshire.
[03:04:36.913 --> 03:04:38.134]  They're leading this.
[03:04:38.134 --> 03:04:41.995]  That's why the system is demonizing 9-11 Truth 24-7 now.
[03:04:41.995 --> 03:04:43.955]  They're scared of something.
[03:04:43.955 --> 03:04:46.656]  And they know the majority of America's questioning the official story.
[03:04:46.656 --> 03:04:51.617]  Max, thank you for spending so much time with us today.
[03:04:51.617 --> 03:04:52.277]  Anytime, Alex.

[03:07:05.043 --> 03:07:11.645]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[03:07:11.645 --> 03:07:16.787]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.

[03:07:38.614 --> 03:07:42.456]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it.
[03:07:42.456 --> 03:07:43.677]  Others don't.
[03:07:43.677 --> 03:07:45.818]  We turn jeans inside out.

[03:08:05.680 --> 03:08:08.421]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:08.421 --> 03:08:12.923]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:12.923 --> 03:08:19.565]  Depending on the poll, more than half of Americans believe 9-11, the official story, to be a fraud.
[03:08:19.565 --> 03:08:22.306]  The lowest polls that are scientific are 36%.
[03:08:22.306 --> 03:08:31.850]  Some scientific polls, like the Angus and Reed New York Times poll of 2006, show 84% question the official story and believe they're being lied to.
[03:08:33.168 --> 03:08:35.030]  You're not a terrorist if you question.
[03:08:35.030 --> 03:08:38.373]  9-11 Truth had never been engaged in any violence.
[03:08:38.373 --> 03:08:46.021]  In the last two years, I've seen mainstream media talking points that 9-11 Truth is going to attack the government.
[03:08:46.021 --> 03:08:48.543]  That has now happened last Thursday.
[03:08:49.364 --> 03:08:57.972]  And Fox News had me on Saturday night, Geraldo Rivera, to officially come out and say, this has destroyed your movement.
[03:08:57.972 --> 03:09:01.655]  No, physics and reality and science hasn't done that.
[03:09:01.655 --> 03:09:09.262]  We expose your false flag terror, and you're not going to be able to stop the truth from coming out, no matter how much terrorism you stage.
[03:09:10.783 --> 03:09:20.269]  And we're gonna have Webster Tarpley on today in the last 20 minutes to break down the history as a historian of confirmed Patsy's.
[03:09:20.269 --> 03:09:21.449]  We've got him, correct?
[03:09:21.449 --> 03:09:23.811]  I just saw you thumbs up.
[03:09:23.811 --> 03:09:29.294]  Correct, Jaren?
[03:09:29.294 --> 03:09:30.495]  Yeah, he's confirmed.
[03:09:30.495 --> 03:09:31.595]  Great.
[03:09:31.595 --> 03:09:34.097]  Okay, so that is coming up.
[03:09:34.097 --> 03:09:34.957]  Here's an article.
[03:09:34.957 --> 03:09:38.459]  12 New England towns demand 911 investigation.
[03:09:41.368 --> 03:09:42.289]  Reinvestigation.
[03:09:42.289 --> 03:09:45.510]  A new movement to reinstate the 9-11 attacks.
[03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:49.573]  A new movement to reinvestigate the 9-11 attacks is gaining pace in the U.S.
[03:09:49.573 --> 03:09:50.954]  with major public support.
[03:09:50.954 --> 03:09:56.977]  Twelve towns are set to decide whether to ask the federal government for a new independent probe.
[03:09:56.977 --> 03:10:04.842]  Because in New Hampshire, they can have the cities basically order the legislature what to do.
[03:10:06.334 --> 03:10:15.278]  New York is dubbed as the Empire State for its wealth and resources and is rightfully regarded as America's most famous city, a beacon of fashion, finance, and fast-paced action.
[03:10:15.278 --> 03:10:23.102]  New Hampshire is the granite state for so-called self-sufficiency, less flash, and cash, more famous for hosting the first U.S.
[03:10:23.102 --> 03:10:24.123]  presidential primary.
[03:10:25.561 --> 03:10:31.222]  And it continues, they're talking about all the cities that are moving for a new investigation.
[03:10:31.222 --> 03:10:38.204]  This is why the system is so concerned and trying to demonize 9-11 Truth.
[03:10:38.204 --> 03:10:39.164]  It's asinine.
[03:10:39.164 --> 03:10:45.266]  9-11 Truth, exposing government-sponsored terrorism, and then the government tries to say, we are terrorists.
[03:10:45.266 --> 03:10:45.966]  It's not going to work.
[03:10:47.585 --> 03:10:52.466]  But they're also demonizing the Tea Parties, the In-the-Fed-ers, the Birthers, everybody else.
[03:10:52.466 --> 03:11:00.208]  We're being told we're terrorists, we're going to commit terror attacks by the Southern Poverty Law Center and others that are spokesmen for the government.
[03:11:00.208 --> 03:11:06.269]  And just like Hitler would stage terror attacks to demonize his political enemies, the same thing is being set up.
[03:11:06.269 --> 03:11:08.390]  And I've been predicting it intensely.
[03:11:09.210 --> 03:11:16.775]  In the last, really, year, but the last three months, intensely, warning every day, and now you're seeing clear false flags.
[03:11:16.775 --> 03:11:23.080]  So Webster coming on, the last 20 minutes to walk through all of this with us.
[03:11:23.080 --> 03:11:26.723]  And we have a bunch of guests joining us tomorrow.
[03:11:26.723 --> 03:11:29.885]  Believe me, you're not going to want to miss that information.
[03:11:32.918 --> 03:11:48.473]  Now, yesterday I started getting calls saying, Adam Gadon, the grandson of the ADL founding board member, a guy who was arrested for beating up Arabs outside their mosque in California, a guy who was so hateful of Arabs and Islam, he couldn't control himself.
[03:11:48.473 --> 03:11:49.894]  He then went and grew a big beard.
[03:11:50.755 --> 03:12:11.983]  And he sits there in English saying he's a top Al-Qaeda commander and then Wired Magazine reported that videos of him and others that have been uploaded by different government front groups put the Al-Qaeda lower third and logo up in the same video layer as the Intel Center and other groups that upload these.
[03:12:11.983 --> 03:12:15.764]  There have been fake Bin Laden videos, fake Al-Qaeda videos, all confirmed.
[03:12:17.110 --> 03:12:18.971]  They announced they'd arrested him.
[03:12:18.971 --> 03:12:22.453]  Everybody was like, oh, Adam Gadahn must be real.
[03:12:22.453 --> 03:12:23.794]  And I said, folks, watch.
[03:12:23.794 --> 03:12:29.016]  They'll say they didn't arrest him or they arrested him as an intelligence operative and they're protecting him.
[03:12:29.016 --> 03:12:34.399]  I've seen other arrests of high-level Al Qaeda, and you'll hear a year later, two years later in some cases, oh, they were really U.S.
[03:12:34.399 --> 03:12:35.000]  government agents.
[03:12:35.000 --> 03:12:37.661]  This will be in the news, but buried in a footnote.
[03:12:37.661 --> 03:12:43.024]  And they quietly released them under a new name and a witness protection program.
[03:12:43.024 --> 03:12:44.345]  Okay?
[03:12:44.345 --> 03:12:45.005]  That goes on.
[03:12:46.687 --> 03:12:51.773]  When they executed Tim McVeigh, two different mainline news reporters reported he was breathing.
[03:12:53.598 --> 03:12:56.419]  In Terre Haute, Indiana, when he left.
[03:12:56.419 --> 03:13:03.921]  And it came out in federal documents that the Southern Poverty Law Center was running the Elohim City white supremacist compound that McVeigh was at.
[03:13:03.921 --> 03:13:07.202]  And it was sworn in federal documents by Terry Nichols and others.
[03:13:07.202 --> 03:13:13.324]  And then later, the lawyers involved actually got the FBI declassified, but the FBI blacked out part of it.
[03:13:13.324 --> 03:13:18.045]  Then they got another four-year request through federal court where they blacked out other areas.
[03:13:18.045 --> 03:13:20.086]  They could put the two together and have the full report.
[03:13:20.546 --> 03:13:21.547]  FULL.
[03:13:21.547 --> 03:13:22.607]  FEDERAL.
[03:13:22.607 --> 03:13:23.568]  OPERATION.
[03:13:23.568 --> 03:13:28.691]  You had a bunch of states, what was it, 14 at the time, moving to declare Tenth Amendment sovereignty against the feds, the U.N.
[03:13:28.691 --> 03:13:30.792]  takeover of Bill Clinton, the sellout to the Chinese.
[03:13:33.007 --> 03:13:36.469]  A move to get us out of the United Nations and boom, they blew that building up.
[03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:50.357]  It came out on CBS News that the ATF had been told not to be in the building that day, that the FBI was in the town running an operation, and it came out that McVeigh was hired in black ops to infiltrate militia and terror groups.
[03:13:50.357 --> 03:13:52.238]  That is confirmed.
[03:13:53.246 --> 03:14:03.812]  And it's confirmed in the New York Times and CBS News again that the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, totally set up these two mentally retarded dupes in 1993 for the World Trade Center attack.
[03:14:03.812 --> 03:14:10.557]  The Ahmad Salam intelligence agent from Egypt thought they were setting him up, recorded the FBI telling him, you let that bombing go ahead.
[03:14:10.557 --> 03:14:13.698]  And that's the only reason he got away without being arrested.
[03:14:13.698 --> 03:14:15.580]  And he was given a $1,300,000 payoff to keep quiet after that happened.
[03:14:19.482 --> 03:14:24.503]  They declassified in the last year those audiotapes from that trial.
[03:14:24.503 --> 03:14:28.864]  Bermas has clips of it in the upcoming film, Invisible Empire, by the way.
[03:14:28.864 --> 03:14:32.985]  I mean, this is some damning, damning information.
[03:14:32.985 --> 03:14:34.666]  We have Operation Northwoods, the U.S.
[03:14:34.666 --> 03:14:36.366]  government staged terror attack documents.
[03:14:36.366 --> 03:14:39.887]  It was declassified three weeks ago at the State Department.
[03:14:40.747 --> 03:14:44.230]  .gov that Bobby Kennedy wanted to blow up U.S.
[03:14:44.230 --> 03:14:50.014]  embassies in Latin America to invade Honduras and other countries and his brother said no?
[03:14:50.014 --> 03:14:55.819]  I mean, this is just standard operating procedure!
[03:14:55.819 --> 03:15:04.165]  And for the media to say these crazy, nut, lunatics think we should look at the government at least allowing this to happen when you have the hijackers trained at U.S.
[03:15:04.165 --> 03:15:05.466]  military bases.
[03:15:05.466 --> 03:15:10.010]  I mean, these are facts that cannot be ignored any longer.
[03:15:11.877 --> 03:15:16.608]  Now, I want to get into the most important story of the day.
[03:15:16.608 --> 03:15:19.635]  I want to play a video clip coming up when we come out of the next segment.
[03:15:24.724 --> 03:15:32.232]  The federal government under Tom Ridge in 2003 admitted that the airport security you see will be nationwide.
[03:15:32.232 --> 03:15:44.726]  They're now putting out Homeland Security videos showing mobile trucks where they're going to body scan you, brain scan you, the machine supposedly tells if you're lying, to get into football games at highway checkpoints.
[03:15:45.407 --> 03:15:55.672]  No judge, no jury, no nothing, and of course the machine's a quack fraud, just like lie detectors were proven to be a fraud in millions of people that were sent to prison, hundreds of thousands who were innocent.
[03:15:55.672 --> 03:15:57.072]  It's just made up.
[03:15:57.072 --> 03:15:59.153]  Oh, but the machine says you're lying.
[03:15:59.153 --> 03:16:04.996]  We're going to show you some Homeland Security video of that coming up.
[03:16:04.996 --> 03:16:12.820]  But the bigger issue here for everyone to understand, and for everyone to be clear about,
[03:16:13.777 --> 03:16:29.606]  Is that Section 802 of the USA Patriot Act states that all misdemeanors are acts of terrorism and last week we read articles where it's being used against homeless, gun shops, people that supposedly don't pay their income taxes, no due process, they're being arrested under the Patriot Act.
[03:16:30.816 --> 03:16:37.619]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007 states the Feds are here and NORTHCOM are here to take over the states.
[03:16:37.619 --> 03:16:54.387]  The MIAC Homeland Security documents of last year, internal documents law enforcement gave us, mainstream media confirmed they were real, says gun owners, veterans, returning gun owner veterans, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, in the Fedders, tax protesters are what Homeland Security is really for.
[03:16:54.387 --> 03:16:58.129]  It's not for the radical Arabs that the CIA runs 9 times out of 10.
[03:17:02.099 --> 03:17:08.121]  And now they admit with this Adam Gadahn that he wasn't arrested, it was all fake as usual.
[03:17:08.121 --> 03:17:10.062]  Again.
[03:17:10.062 --> 03:17:14.644]  They tell you they arrest him, then they tell you hours later they didn't in a bottom footnote.
[03:17:14.644 --> 03:17:18.525]  That's how stupid they think you are to lend credibility to this Adam Gadahn guy.
[03:17:18.525 --> 03:17:22.767]  And when he's making videos again in a month, the media won't retract that he was never arrested.
[03:17:22.767 --> 03:17:24.768]  This is PSYOP mind control.
[03:17:26.428 --> 03:17:28.870]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[03:17:28.870 --> 03:17:30.691]  This isn't just PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:17:30.691 --> 03:17:37.976]  This is Atlantic Monthly.
[03:17:37.976 --> 03:17:41.218]  Dissenters to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[03:17:41.218 --> 03:17:42.819]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:17:42.819 --> 03:17:55.507]  Since the establishment media is convinced that the Tea Party members, 9-11 Truthers, Libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, and basically anyone with a dissenting political opinion is a likely domestic terrorist, they should be celebrating the fact that a new bill
[03:17:56.388 --> 03:17:56.949]  We're good to go.
[03:18:16.610 --> 03:18:33.953]  Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010 introduced by Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman on Thursday with a little fanfare sets out a comprehensive policy for detention, interrogation, and trial of suspected enemy belligerents who are believed to engage in hostile activities
[03:18:34.694 --> 03:18:47.487]  Against the United States by belligerence who are believed to have engaged and it goes on requiring these individuals to be held in military custody Interrogated for their intelligence value and not provided with Miranda warning writes the Atlantic's mark
[03:18:49.156 --> 03:18:50.417]  Ambinder.
[03:18:50.417 --> 03:18:52.198]  Read the full text of the bill here.
[03:18:52.198 --> 03:18:53.279]  PDF.
[03:18:53.279 --> 03:18:54.860]  The bill does not distinguish between U.S.
[03:18:54.860 --> 03:19:03.366]  citizens and non-citizens and states that suspected belligerents who were considered a high-value detainee shall not be provided with Miranda warning.
[03:19:03.366 --> 03:19:07.689]  A person considered a high-value detainee if they fulfill one of the following criteria.
[03:19:07.689 --> 03:19:08.690]  Here's the key.
[03:19:08.690 --> 03:19:13.713]  One, pose a threat of an attack on civilian or civilian facilities in the U.S.
[03:19:13.713 --> 03:19:14.154]  or U.S.
[03:19:14.154 --> 03:19:15.275]  facilities abroad.
[03:19:15.275 --> 03:19:16.876]  Two, poses a threat to U.S.
[03:19:16.876 --> 03:19:18.036]  military personnel or U.S.
[03:19:18.036 --> 03:19:18.357]  military
[03:19:18.897 --> 03:19:19.397]  Facilities.
[03:19:19.397 --> 03:19:20.078]  Three.
[03:19:20.078 --> 03:19:21.639]  Potential intelligence value.
[03:19:21.639 --> 03:19:23.921]  For any reason, any potential value, they grab you.
[03:19:23.921 --> 03:19:24.602]  Four.
[03:19:24.602 --> 03:19:27.204]  Is a member of Al-Qaeda or a terrorist group affiliated with Al-Qaeda?
[03:19:27.204 --> 03:19:27.804]  And here's the key.
[03:19:27.804 --> 03:19:28.945]  Five.
[03:19:28.945 --> 03:19:33.248]  Such other matters as the President considers appropriate.
[03:19:33.248 --> 03:19:34.609]  The President is the Fuhrer.
[03:19:34.609 --> 03:19:37.552]  He is God.
[03:19:37.552 --> 03:19:41.475]  And they go on to say this will be used against the American people and that's how it's written.
[03:19:43.652 --> 03:19:51.118]  And now they say they already have Viper teams, TSA, Homeland Security, all over the country running checkpoints with regular Army and Marines.
[03:19:51.118 --> 03:19:58.183]  Now they're saying that they're just going to pull you out of your car when you're going to the mall and run you through these machines.
[03:19:58.183 --> 03:19:59.664]  And oh, where'd Alex go?
[03:19:59.664 --> 03:20:02.666]  Well, the machine said he was a terrorist.
[03:20:02.666 --> 03:20:04.067]  Total fraud.
[03:20:04.067 --> 03:20:05.829]  That machine is now your jury.
[03:20:05.829 --> 03:20:10.432]  Is garlic the absolute best defense against the threat of bacterial and viral pandemics?
[03:20:10.432 --> 03:20:10.572]  No.
[03:20:12.691 --> 03:20:13.151]  I think so.
[03:20:35.157 --> 03:20:36.378]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:20:36.378 --> 03:20:40.941]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:20:40.941 --> 03:20:46.765]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold before your retirement.
[03:20:46.765 --> 03:20:50.407]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:20:50.407 --> 03:20:53.129]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:20:53.129 --> 03:20:58.172]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[03:20:58.172 --> 03:20:58.433]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:20:58.433 --> 03:20:59.834]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:21:05.497 --> 03:21:07.258]  We're now in 2010.
[03:21:07.258 --> 03:21:08.658]  Change is the buzzword.
[03:21:08.658 --> 03:21:11.059]  Politics are changing in the negative direction.
[03:21:11.059 --> 03:21:12.720]  How about positive change?
[03:21:12.720 --> 03:21:16.061]  Thousands of customers have experienced positive change.
[03:21:16.061 --> 03:21:17.442]  Yes, thousands.

[03:22:01.526 --> 03:22:06.648]  LifeChangeT is a proud member of the Better Business Bureau.
[03:22:06.648 --> 03:22:10.670]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:10.670 --> 03:22:13.911]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:13.911 --> 03:22:15.332]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:22:16.030 --> 03:22:18.711]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:22:18.711 --> 03:22:25.094]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:25.094 --> 03:22:30.296]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:22:30.296 --> 03:22:40.401]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:40.401 --> 03:22:42.762]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:42.762 --> 03:22:44.342]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:44.342 --> 03:22:45.203]  And the Congress is saying,
[03:22:45.583 --> 03:22:46.784]  Who do we make the check out to?

[03:24:01.977 --> 03:24:03.157]  Freeze Dry Guy.
[03:24:03.157 --> 03:24:08.840]  The best you can buy.
[03:24:08.840 --> 03:24:12.501]  Webster Tarbley coming up in 15 minutes.
[03:24:12.501 --> 03:24:18.443]  To go over a brief history of previous Patsy's where it's confirmed to be government staged.
[03:24:18.443 --> 03:24:19.344]  This is what they do.
[03:24:21.724 --> 03:24:33.799]  So they've introduced a bill that has a good chance of passing that says American citizens for any potential intelligence value can be secretly arrested, tortured, or for such other matters as the President considers appropriate.
[03:24:33.799 --> 03:24:38.985]  Now the Enemy Combatant Act said the same thing, but this is even more expansive.
[03:24:38.985 --> 03:24:39.947]  Simultaneously,
[03:24:41.696 --> 03:24:50.601]  It's finally in Wired Magazine, and even the Wall Street Journal, headline, Cybersecurity, The End of the Free Internet.
[03:24:50.601 --> 03:24:56.423]  Another headline, Cybersecurity Enacts the End of the Open Internet.
[03:24:56.423 --> 03:24:57.884]  I mean, this is really happening.
[03:24:57.884 --> 03:25:00.165]  They're really saying the end of free speech.
[03:25:00.165 --> 03:25:02.126]  They're really saying we'll secretly arrest you.
[03:25:02.126 --> 03:25:06.889]  They really have legislation to publicly open the FEMA camps, the National Emergency Centers Act.
[03:25:07.967 --> 03:25:10.450]  They really have all these executive orders on the books.
[03:25:10.450 --> 03:25:13.172]  The foreign banks are really robbing us.
[03:25:13.172 --> 03:25:17.657]  Our criminal government does nothing but put dictatorships and corrupt regimes in worldwide.
[03:25:17.657 --> 03:25:20.079]  This isn't the American government!
[03:25:20.079 --> 03:25:24.944]  And a lot of people in government are concerned as well, but all of us have to have our voices heard.
[03:25:24.944 --> 03:25:27.487]  And stop just attacking the Republicans or the Democrats.
[03:25:27.487 --> 03:25:28.969]  They're a bunch of puppets.
[03:25:28.969 --> 03:25:30.650]  We have to go after the bankers.
[03:25:30.650 --> 03:25:31.051]  Now listen.
[03:25:32.594 --> 03:25:35.416]  License plate reading cameras are scanning everywhere you go.
[03:25:35.416 --> 03:25:37.158]  Your cell phones are tracking you.
[03:25:37.158 --> 03:25:44.043]  They admit that the federal government and Google, not just public schools, are watching you on the cameras and microphones built into all the new computers.
[03:25:44.043 --> 03:25:45.064]  That's now admitted.
[03:25:45.064 --> 03:25:46.665]  It's now admitted for 37 years.
[03:25:46.665 --> 03:25:48.567]  All babies at birth have their blood taken.
[03:25:48.567 --> 03:25:51.549]  It's given to the Pentagon for bioweapons research illegally.
[03:25:51.549 --> 03:25:53.211]  I told you that 14 years ago.
[03:25:53.211 --> 03:25:54.432]  It's now all over the news!
[03:25:55.768 --> 03:25:57.470]  See, they just do whatever they want.
[03:25:57.470 --> 03:26:01.975]  They put out fake Al-Qaeda videos, they stage terror attacks, they're completely criminal.
[03:26:01.975 --> 03:26:05.218]  They stole $28 trillion and won't tell Congress where it went.
[03:26:05.218 --> 03:26:08.622]  $28 trillion, not $784 billion!
[03:26:11.630 --> 03:26:13.832]  Now, I'm going to go out to break with part of this six-minute clip.
[03:26:13.832 --> 03:26:17.214]  It's in the article Paul Watson wrote to Senators to be detained as enemy belligerents.
[03:26:17.214 --> 03:26:21.738]  There's another Homeland Security thing they're looking at, another video, where they want everybody to wear Taser bracelets.
[03:26:21.738 --> 03:26:23.299]  Everyone that gets on a plane.
[03:26:23.299 --> 03:26:25.721]  Funnily enough, the naked body records you.
[03:26:25.721 --> 03:26:26.522]  There's no end!
[03:26:26.522 --> 03:26:27.683]  This is pure tyranny!
[03:26:29.059 --> 03:26:39.827]  Now here they are in a Homeland Security video talking about these mobile vans they've got, these big mobile 18-wheeler trailers, where they body scan you, brain scan you, to see if you're lying.
[03:26:39.827 --> 03:26:43.530]  And these are now showing up in America.
[03:26:43.530 --> 03:26:50.215]  Think of a science fiction movie where there's mobile brain scanning vans, because there's terrorists, but they leave the borders wide open.
[03:26:50.215 --> 03:26:56.520]  And every time there's a real terrorist, and they're going to stop him, the State Department's ordered by the CIA to let the underwear bomber on the plane.
[03:26:56.520 --> 03:26:58.342]  It's mainstream news and gets no attention!
[03:26:58.942 --> 03:27:02.529]  Let's go ahead and go to this video.
[03:27:02.529 --> 03:27:04.011]  Oh, happy, calm music.
[03:27:04.011 --> 03:27:05.354]  Homeland Security.
[03:27:05.354 --> 03:27:06.997]  Notice how they do it real calm.
[03:27:06.997 --> 03:27:08.219]  Everything's fine, slaves.
[03:27:08.219 --> 03:27:09.321]  Get on the trains.
[03:27:09.321 --> 03:27:10.102]  Get on the wagons.
[03:27:12.443 --> 03:27:27.529]  Under the Future Attribute Screening Technologies, or FAST, program, the Department of Homeland Security is developing innovative physiological and behavioral screening technologies to streamline the screening process at security checkpoints.
[03:27:27.529 --> 03:27:30.390]  In support of this program, Battelle has- Head pause!
[03:27:31.522 --> 03:27:38.286]  See, first you take your shoes off, you get asked questions, you take your belt off, you get searched.
[03:27:38.286 --> 03:27:42.088]  They're admitting like dog training in the airport, then they do it nationwide.
[03:27:42.088 --> 03:27:50.693]  Then it's naked body scans, then they're talking about body x-rays, then it's brain scanners, it's being asked questions, it's being prodded, it's secret police everywhere.
[03:27:50.693 --> 03:27:54.315]  They're already doing this in England three years ago, they have mobile trucks doing it.
[03:27:54.315 --> 03:27:56.716]  Do you understand how evil this government is?
[03:27:58.083 --> 03:28:01.666]  See, they know most of you fly on planes and put up with this, so now they'll be on the streets.
[03:28:01.666 --> 03:28:07.731]  The schools have thumb scanners, body searches, brainwashing, shooting drills to scare the kids.
[03:28:07.731 --> 03:28:09.933]  They're conditioning you to be total slaves.
[03:28:09.933 --> 03:28:10.794]  Continue.
[03:28:10.794 --> 03:28:23.445]  Industry leaders, Farber Specialty Vehicles and Draper Laboratory to design and develop a portable research facility for the development and demonstration of innovative security screening technologies.
[03:28:23.445 --> 03:28:25.127]  The Fast Demonstration Laboratory.
[03:28:26.437 --> 03:28:42.610]  The mobility of the FAST demonstration laboratory allows security officials to quickly and efficiently establish security boundaries at any location, making it useful for everything from large sporting events, border crossings, or airports.
[03:28:42.610 --> 03:28:48.975]  The screening mobile module provides a checkpoint to establish or supplement security facilities at points of entry.
[03:28:50.265 --> 03:28:54.210]  At special events, attendees pass through the screening mobile module.
[03:28:54.210 --> 03:28:55.352]  All right, pause.
[03:28:55.352 --> 03:29:01.379]  See, first they have troops out of the Kentucky Derby, football games, college, NFL, then high school.
[03:29:01.379 --> 03:29:02.641]  We showed you that five years ago.
[03:29:02.641 --> 03:29:06.486]  Little three-year-olds' bags being searched by troops, being conditioned.
[03:29:07.387 --> 03:29:08.869]  You see video from Fallujah.
[03:29:08.869 --> 03:29:12.912]  They have these mobile trucks, face scanning, biometrically brain scanning.
[03:29:12.912 --> 03:29:23.963]  In 2000, I showed you Marine Corps training in California, where they had people playing the parts of American militia from San Francisco being herded through these systems.
[03:29:25.523 --> 03:29:37.679]  They're now getting grants to give these to local police departments, and the Homeland Security officials sit on the boards of these companies, getting money as consultants to then go illegally lobby for these?
[03:29:37.679 --> 03:29:41.243]  I mean, this is a high-tech, futuristic nightmare.
[03:29:42.213 --> 03:29:47.636]  We're going to finish up with this, play the Fox News piece, hit piece with Geraldo, go to Webster Tarpley and a lot more.
[03:29:47.636 --> 03:29:55.620]  But, I mean, to openly introduce bills for FEMA camps and to arrest citizens for no reason and torture us, I mean, my God.
[03:29:55.620 --> 03:29:57.021]  We're on the march.
[03:29:57.021 --> 03:29:59.542]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:59.542 --> 03:30:02.224]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:06.201 --> 03:30:10.225]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:30:10.225 --> 03:30:13.468]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:30:13.468 --> 03:30:18.272]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:30:18.272 --> 03:30:24.658]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:30:24.658 --> 03:30:26.901]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:30:27.441 --> 03:30:27.741]  Tim Geithner?
[03:30:27.741 --> 03:30:28.242]  Bernanke?
[03:30:28.242 --> 03:30:28.922]  They're arsonists!
[03:30:28.922 --> 03:30:30.203]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:30:30.203 --> 03:30:32.444]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:30:46.334 --> 03:30:53.618]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:30:53.618 --> 03:31:02.743]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:31:06.701 --> 03:31:10.662]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:31:10.662 --> 03:31:19.525]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:31:19.525 --> 03:31:24.146]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:31:24.146 --> 03:31:34.969]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:31:35.609 --> 03:31:45.111]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:31:45.111 --> 03:31:50.553]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[03:31:58.034 --> 03:32:00.775]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[03:32:06.098 --> 03:32:12.803]  Why is drinking pure high alkaline pH water the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:32:12.803 --> 03:32:19.207]  Because alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[03:32:19.207 --> 03:32:25.532]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment.
[03:32:25.532 --> 03:32:30.435]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[03:32:30.915 --> 03:32:39.081]  Using AlkaVision pH Drops is the best way to make your water alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[03:32:39.081 --> 03:32:43.685]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to an alkaline level.
[03:32:43.685 --> 03:32:47.407]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:32:48.328 --> 03:32:54.090]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to AlkaVision.com.
[03:32:54.090 --> 03:32:57.111]  That's A-L-K-A Vision dot com.
[03:32:57.111 --> 03:32:57.791]  Or by calling 269-409-1776.
[03:32:57.791 --> 03:32:58.071]  269-409-1776 today.
[03:32:58.071 --> 03:32:58.932]  I hear a voice inside your head.
[03:32:58.932 --> 03:32:59.632]  You refuse to leave.
[03:33:16.379 --> 03:33:19.582]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:33:33.180 --> 03:33:38.265]  So taser bracelets, mobile vans, forced inoculation.
[03:33:38.265 --> 03:33:41.348]  They set you down and ask you if you're a terrorist.
[03:33:41.348 --> 03:33:44.531]  And these people buy $500 football tickets.
[03:33:44.531 --> 03:33:45.432]  They're gonna go through it.
[03:33:45.432 --> 03:33:45.993]  They're gonna do it.
[03:33:45.993 --> 03:33:47.374]  Their kids are gonna do it.
[03:33:47.374 --> 03:33:51.298]  And it's just total conditioning to accept
[03:33:52.605 --> 03:34:02.169]  People getting in your business, being guilty until proven innocent, and it's a machine scanning your facial expressions and your brainwaves.
[03:34:02.169 --> 03:34:04.589]  Already some airports have these.
[03:34:04.589 --> 03:34:08.571]  And now they want blood samples to get a driver's license.
[03:34:08.571 --> 03:34:11.772]  Bill Clinton signed an executive order in 1994 to do that.
[03:34:11.772 --> 03:34:16.074]  My first film, America Destroyed by Design, shows the executive order.
[03:34:16.074 --> 03:34:17.974]  Now they're trying to implement it.
[03:34:17.974 --> 03:34:21.356]  They're training you to accept anything, like a pimp breaks a whore.
[03:34:22.313 --> 03:34:22.834]  Okay?
[03:34:22.834 --> 03:34:25.117]  They're breaking your will!
[03:34:25.117 --> 03:34:31.184]  It's so sick to see my fellow countrymen and others globally being turned into nothing but slaves.
[03:34:31.184 --> 03:34:35.009]  Let's go ahead and finish up with this chilling clip from Homeland Security.
[03:34:41.275 --> 03:34:50.600]  Inside the Screening Mobile Module, a suite of real-time, non-invasive sensors measure behavioral and physiological indications of malintent.
[03:34:50.600 --> 03:34:51.581]  Oh, it's non-invasive!
[03:34:51.581 --> 03:34:53.001]  Back it up!
[03:34:53.001 --> 03:34:53.902]  It's non-invasive!
[03:34:53.902 --> 03:34:55.943]  We don't stick anything up your rear or down your throat!
[03:34:59.150 --> 03:35:09.158]  Brain scanning people, body scanning people, biometrically recording you at malls or on the highway or to go into a sporting event.
[03:35:09.158 --> 03:35:11.780]  And the public schools are already little prisons.
[03:35:11.780 --> 03:35:14.643]  But the illegal aliens in 800 cities are above the law.
[03:35:14.643 --> 03:35:19.226]  Every day they run into somebody and kill them in Central Texas and the media never talks about how they're illegal aliens.
[03:35:19.226 --> 03:35:22.729]  But they throw the book at us, the scumbag, dumb citizens.
[03:35:22.729 --> 03:35:23.510]  That's how we're seen.
[03:35:23.510 --> 03:35:24.731]  And I guess we deserve it.
[03:35:25.191 --> 03:35:25.812]  Back to the clip!
[03:35:45.629 --> 03:35:58.516]  The Screening Mobile Module can be configured to support primary screening, secondary screening, observation areas, or multiple screening lanes for higher subject throughput.
[03:35:58.516 --> 03:36:08.882]  Anchor track on the walls, ceiling, and floors provide a secure and easily reconfigurable means of installing equipment throughout the screening unit.
[03:36:08.882 --> 03:36:13.204]  New screening centers can be easily integrated into the Screening Mobile Module.
[03:36:15.765 --> 03:36:23.372]  The command unit provides local supervision and management of screening operations during a security event.
[03:36:23.372 --> 03:36:37.525]  Multiple screening units can be wirelessly networked to a single command module, minimizing the resources needed to manage large events and providing a cost-effective means of providing on-site security operations at a large event.
[03:36:38.410 --> 03:36:45.953]  Climate-controlled data processing areas in both mobile modules provide ample space for on-site data processing and analysis equipment.
[03:36:45.953 --> 03:36:47.974]  Isn't that sweet?
[03:36:47.974 --> 03:36:53.697]  The mobile modules are secured by a security system... These are mobile... Hit pause.
[03:36:53.697 --> 03:36:57.178]  These are mobile interrogation brainwashing units.
[03:36:57.178 --> 03:37:00.160]  Skip ahead to the very end because we're running out of time.
[03:37:00.160 --> 03:37:04.601]  At the very end they show actual subjects being asked if they're terrorists.
[03:37:04.601 --> 03:37:07.703]  Skip ahead the last minute or two shows that... I mean...
[03:37:10.478 --> 03:37:14.607]  They just engage in outrageous behavior in front of everyone.
[03:37:14.607 --> 03:37:16.691]  Did you find it?
[03:37:16.691 --> 03:37:17.012]  Go ahead.
[03:37:21.513 --> 03:37:22.414]  Now here's some examples.
[03:37:22.414 --> 03:37:25.856]  Step forward and stand on those footprints on that map.
[03:37:25.856 --> 03:37:26.777]  Step forward.
[03:37:26.777 --> 03:37:31.100]  What I'm going to have you do is can you put your purse in your pocket or just to the side there?
[03:37:31.100 --> 03:37:33.822]  I'm going to have you look in my direction.
[03:37:33.822 --> 03:37:39.846]  Just keep your hands kind of to the side and try and refrain from movement.
[03:37:39.846 --> 03:37:40.106]  Okay?
[03:37:40.106 --> 03:37:41.327]  Just try and remain as still as possible.
[03:37:41.327 --> 03:37:42.128]  Hear that, prisoner?
[03:37:42.128 --> 03:37:49.773]  Did you show your ID to the first guard?
[03:37:49.773 --> 03:37:50.434]  To the guard?
[03:37:55.393 --> 03:38:04.239]  Are you attempting to smuggle an explosive device into the expo today?
[03:38:04.239 --> 03:38:11.764]  Are you from the local area?
[03:38:11.764 --> 03:38:16.867]  Are you attempting to smuggle a recording device into the expo today?
[03:38:16.867 --> 03:38:17.568]  Ah, that's enough!
[03:38:18.596 --> 03:38:20.117]  And then notice they widen it.
[03:38:20.117 --> 03:38:23.298]  Oh, you're going to the expo center to see a rock and roll concert.
[03:38:23.298 --> 03:38:25.778]  Are you attempting to smuggle a recording device?
[03:38:25.778 --> 03:38:27.279]  Because that's the same as an explosive.
[03:38:27.279 --> 03:38:30.620]  See, first, are you trying to smuggle an explosive in?
[03:38:30.620 --> 03:38:32.381]  Are you from the local area?
[03:38:32.381 --> 03:38:34.981]  Are you trying to smuggle a recording device in?
[03:38:34.981 --> 03:38:36.722]  See, because they know there's no real terrorist.
[03:38:39.082 --> 03:38:41.104]  And so, and then they go on and on.
[03:38:41.104 --> 03:38:50.272]  And when I watch the Marines playing the part of taking over Oakland, interrogating the mock terrorist, you're in a militia, where are you from?
[03:38:50.272 --> 03:38:51.993]  Where'd you get the helmet?
[03:38:51.993 --> 03:38:53.554]  And they're doing the same thing.
[03:38:54.435 --> 03:39:03.021]  You live in Fallujah now, folks, and if you let these sickos, naked bodies scan you, you already let them take your shoes off and all these acts of submission.
[03:39:03.021 --> 03:39:09.826]  Now in the last hour of flights they say you can't talk, gotta put your hands in your lap, can't have a blanket, because you all might be terrorists.
[03:39:09.826 --> 03:39:20.534]  The only group we can trust that's not terrorists is the government run by big banks stealing tens of trillions of dollars and lying about WMDs and killing over a million Iraqis
[03:39:20.774 --> 03:39:26.422]  And leaving our borders open, and building giant prisons everywhere, and sneaking in narcotics.
[03:39:26.422 --> 03:39:36.396]  That's the only group we can trust, but people trying to get into an expo center, have got to see a rock concert, have got to be asked if they're terrorists, and asked if they have a recording device, and brain scanned.
[03:39:39.960 --> 03:39:41.201]  You know, I'm out of time.
[03:39:41.201 --> 03:39:45.244]  I wanted to play the Fox News piece with Geraldo trying to demonize 9-11 Truth.
[03:39:45.244 --> 03:39:50.167]  At the start of the clip, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[03:39:50.167 --> 03:39:53.610]  It's been the news and feature on the front page of YouTube all day if you want to see it.
[03:39:53.610 --> 03:39:55.511]  It's another easy way on the front page of YouTube.
[03:39:55.511 --> 03:40:02.616]  Geraldo said, oh, this guy's a 9-11 Truth, or does this discredit your movement?
[03:40:02.616 --> 03:40:06.939]  It didn't seem to discredit the tea parties that a tea party guy flew into the building when he was a tea party.
[03:40:10.492 --> 03:40:13.334]  And I pointed out the government has staged terror in the past.
[03:40:13.334 --> 03:40:21.561]  That's the information that gets looked at, not some patsy showing up and doing this out of the blue.
[03:40:21.561 --> 03:40:33.170]  And Geraldo didn't know what to say, and then his co-host basically said that I was making outrageous claims saying Gulf of Tonkin and other events were staged, and Geraldo had to admit, no, no, no, it is staged.
[03:40:33.170 --> 03:40:39.616]  Now, I've been telling you they're going to stage terror attacks and blame it on birthers, on truthers, and on tea parties.
[03:40:40.717 --> 03:40:42.058]  And they're now doing it.
[03:40:42.058 --> 03:40:56.052]  And I told you, because out of the blue, with birthers, truthers, and tea parties engaged in no violence ever, out of the blue, all their talking heads started saying, truthers are going to kill Obama, they're going to attack the military, they're going to attack police.
[03:40:56.052 --> 03:40:56.733]  You watch!
[03:40:58.188 --> 03:41:00.369]  That's them preparing the public.
[03:41:00.369 --> 03:41:01.569]  And then it happens.
[03:41:01.569 --> 03:41:02.670]  And then you look at the case.
[03:41:02.670 --> 03:41:03.530]  Underwear bomber.
[03:41:03.530 --> 03:41:04.650]  Family warned.
[03:41:04.650 --> 03:41:06.431]  State Department ordered him let on the plane.
[03:41:06.431 --> 03:41:07.371]  Had him let on the plane.
[03:41:07.371 --> 03:41:08.052]  Now confirmed.
[03:41:08.052 --> 03:41:09.372]  Kurt Haskell confirmed.
[03:41:09.372 --> 03:41:10.292]  All of it proven.
[03:41:10.292 --> 03:41:11.393]  The eyewitness is correct.
[03:41:11.393 --> 03:41:12.953]  FBI admits they lied.
[03:41:12.953 --> 03:41:16.355]  But no investigation.
[03:41:16.355 --> 03:41:18.816]  The Ford Hood shooter for two years talked about what he was going to do.
[03:41:18.816 --> 03:41:20.656]  Thought he was emailing Al Qaeda.
[03:41:20.656 --> 03:41:25.098]  Turned out it's this top Al Qaeda guy who works for CIA who runs all the major patsies.
[03:41:26.713 --> 03:41:34.175]  In every other case, this guy's family warned him months and then weeks before and nothing was done.
[03:41:34.175 --> 03:41:36.416]  They're not releasing the surveillance footage.
[03:41:36.416 --> 03:41:40.857]  Operation Northwoods talks about grazing or wounding troops at U.S.
[03:41:40.857 --> 03:41:48.080]  military bases in D.C., in Miami, and at Guantanamo Bay with people dressed up like Cubans.
[03:41:48.080 --> 03:41:51.941]  And even, folks, they just repeat the same thing over and over again.
[03:41:53.356 --> 03:41:54.637]  They're at a key juncture.
[03:41:54.637 --> 03:41:57.358]  Why are they so afraid of 9-11 truth?
[03:41:57.358 --> 03:42:02.520]  Why are they hell-bent on demonizing 9-11 truth?
[03:42:02.520 --> 03:42:11.443]  Because they can't stage terror attacks anymore to launch new wars because we have educated the public about false flag terror.
[03:42:11.443 --> 03:42:17.686]  We've taken one of their favorite mechanisms of frame-up, of false flag, and we've exposed it.
[03:42:17.686 --> 03:42:21.588]  And so, Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, Fox, CNN, MSNBC,
[03:42:22.788 --> 03:42:28.210]  Scores of other publications, Time, Newsweek, all particularly naming Alex Jones.
[03:42:28.210 --> 03:42:33.051]  I mean, the London Guardian said that I'm like a black hole of evil and creating mass psychosis.
[03:42:33.051 --> 03:42:43.735]  They are really angry right now, and that's because they want to launch new terror attacks, but they know we're going to be here exposing them, so they think if they discredit us before they stage new terror, no one will listen.
[03:42:44.315 --> 03:42:45.716]  But that's flawed logic.
[03:42:45.716 --> 03:42:48.659]  The idea of looking for the staged terror is now there.
[03:42:48.659 --> 03:43:03.851]  That's why Kurt Haskell, the lawyer and his wife and others, saw them lead the underwear bomber on the plane, saw them protect him without a passport, get him on, saw the man videotaping him, part of a drill, found the other bomb on the plane once they got off, then they lied about that.
[03:43:03.851 --> 03:43:06.273]  All that sense has come out to be true.
[03:43:06.273 --> 03:43:08.194]  But there's no investigation.
[03:43:08.194 --> 03:43:10.376]  Because Haskell and his wife were 9-11 truthers.
[03:43:12.250 --> 03:43:14.073]  We've got people everywhere.
[03:43:14.073 --> 03:43:17.979]  Some polls are in the mid-30s, 36% is the lowest.
[03:43:17.979 --> 03:43:20.863]  Some polls, 84% believe 9-11 is an inside job.
[03:43:20.863 --> 03:43:21.985]  Angus and Reid, New York Times, 2006.
[03:43:24.417 --> 03:43:32.660]  They are panicking because we've got our people everywhere who are going to record and remember what happens and we know what to look for now.
[03:43:32.660 --> 03:43:44.723]  I now go to Webster Griffin Tarpley, a doctorate of history and economics, author of 9-11 Synthetic Terror, Made in the USA, a great book on 9-11 that we sell at Infowars.com.
[03:43:44.723 --> 03:43:50.365]  Webster, I wanted to get you on with some of the past Patsy Ops versus Provocateur or purely staged ops.
[03:43:51.368 --> 03:43:52.089]  Yes, certainly.
[03:43:52.089 --> 03:43:55.672]  There are many indications that this indeed is a staged operation with the Patsy.
[03:43:55.672 --> 03:43:57.513]  And I guess even before we get to the Patsy part,
[03:44:11.949 --> 03:44:14.592]  I guess the starting point is always, is there something fishy?
[03:44:14.592 --> 03:44:16.353]  Is there something suspicious?
[03:44:16.353 --> 03:44:17.595]  Something that doesn't add up?
[03:44:17.595 --> 03:44:29.266]  And I would say in this case, according to ABC News, there's a second individual taken into custody at the shooting, briefly detained and then released after they said that he had nothing to do with the incident.
[03:44:29.266 --> 03:44:31.669]  The two cops are not being allowed to talk.
[03:44:32.139 --> 03:44:34.200]  Yeah, that's an African immigrant.
[03:44:34.200 --> 03:44:34.780]  Yeah, go ahead.
[03:44:34.780 --> 03:44:36.360]  The two people who are slightly wounded.
[03:44:36.360 --> 03:44:38.861]  Well, we think it's the African immigrant, but we don't know.
[03:44:38.861 --> 03:44:42.623]  That could be a cover for some other person that was actually there.
[03:44:42.623 --> 03:44:45.383]  Then we have his family warning in detail.
[03:44:45.383 --> 03:44:50.885]  Right, but just in terms of this now, the guy, I have to be very brutal about him.
[03:44:50.885 --> 03:44:54.607]  It's a tragic case, but this is someone who is mentally ill.
[03:44:54.607 --> 03:44:55.647]  He is a psychotic.
[03:44:55.647 --> 03:44:57.287]  He is criminally insane.
[03:44:57.287 --> 03:45:01.709]  And we have the testimony of his psychiatrist, Dr. J. Michael Nelson.
[03:45:02.355 --> 03:45:12.505]  He says that Bedell has a bad bipolar disorder, which he could have controlled with medication, but instead he refused his medication and instead turned to marijuana.
[03:45:12.505 --> 03:45:18.351]  And I think that this is the key to it, because in order to be a patsy, it helps to have cognitive impairment.
[03:45:18.351 --> 03:45:20.072]  And that's what we find in this case.
[03:45:20.072 --> 03:45:23.335]  He's been institutionalized many times over the years.
[03:45:23.335 --> 03:45:24.957]  His parents essentially begged
[03:45:25.492 --> 03:45:28.914]  To have the police institutionalize him, hospitalize him.
[03:45:28.914 --> 03:45:40.342]  In that sense, there's a direct parallel to Muttala, where the parents also say that the kid is... He'd also been talking to the Pentagon for five years about some of his inventions and had talked about traveling to meet with them there.
[03:45:40.342 --> 03:45:45.065]  So he could have just been a mentally ill person they had, they shoot a few of their people, kill him.
[03:45:45.065 --> 03:45:45.385]  Right.
[03:45:45.385 --> 03:45:53.711]  Now, the question of 9-11 Truth, I think this is complete red herring, because what I see about this is this is a kind of a throwaway line, a chance comment,
[03:45:54.286 --> 03:46:00.168]  Four or five years ago, he's interested in this Sabau case, but he's not really interested in 9-11.
[03:46:00.168 --> 03:46:05.889]  If we look at him in terms of action, rather than rhetoric, action for him means narcotics.
[03:46:05.889 --> 03:46:08.050]  He is devoted to narcotics.
[03:46:08.050 --> 03:46:10.130]  He wants a society based on narcotics.
[03:46:10.130 --> 03:46:13.191]  He wants marijuana to be the basis of the currency.
[03:46:13.191 --> 03:46:16.832]  He wants billions and billions of marijuana plants.
[03:46:16.832 --> 03:46:19.833]  And of course, then it gets into his arrest record.
[03:46:19.833 --> 03:46:22.494]  And I think this is where you also see this question of the Patsy.
[03:46:23.055 --> 03:46:31.200]  The Patsy gets away with murder, or he gets away with things that the average person never could and that would be in jail.
[03:46:31.200 --> 03:46:37.283]  Now in this case, in 2006 he's arrested in California for growing marijuana plants.
[03:46:37.283 --> 03:46:45.048]  Now he may have a medical marijuana card and that may get him off, but he's also in there for resisting arrest in California.
[03:46:45.048 --> 03:46:46.709]  Then we have him picked up in Texas.
[03:46:47.424 --> 03:46:51.286]  Uh, in January for speeding, but also with a marijuana pipe.
[03:46:51.286 --> 03:46:54.748]  And the state police officer called his parents and said he seems like he's out of his mind.
[03:46:54.748 --> 03:46:57.990]  Well, I'm sure we know that he fits the M.O.
[03:46:57.990 --> 03:47:06.796]  The reason I wanted to get you on, though, was to go over some of the history of other type mental deficiencies they've used, where it's turned out it was provocateur actions.
[03:47:06.796 --> 03:47:10.578]  Yeah, well, again, the Reno, Nevada case is also, I think, significant.
[03:47:10.578 --> 03:47:11.478]  He's got pipes.
[03:47:11.478 --> 03:47:14.620]  He's got, he's driving under the influence of marijuana.
[03:47:14.620 --> 03:47:15.921]  He's driving while drugged.
[03:47:16.371 --> 03:47:22.397]  And nevertheless, he's able to go on what is described as a 6-8 week driving spree.
[03:47:22.397 --> 03:47:23.578]  Where did he get the money?
[03:47:23.578 --> 03:47:25.119]  And then he shows up at the Pentagon.
[03:47:25.119 --> 03:47:28.322]  Where was he during this 6-8 week period?
[03:47:28.322 --> 03:47:30.724]  Now, the parallels.
[03:47:30.724 --> 03:47:38.311]  Major Hassan is someone who worked at the Walter Reed Army Hospital here in Washington, D.C.
[03:47:38.311 --> 03:47:41.313]  He was active at the Bethesda Naval Medical Center.
[03:47:41.313 --> 03:47:42.855]  So he's a shrink among shrinks.
[03:47:43.664 --> 03:47:49.709]  And we have these memos from his colleagues saying, this man is a psychotic.
[03:47:49.709 --> 03:47:54.313]  He talks about Islam, but basically his problem is that he's a psychotic.
[03:47:54.313 --> 03:47:55.974]  And nothing happened.
[03:47:55.974 --> 03:48:03.280]  Similarly with Muttalab, the parents, in this case, with Bedell, have begged the police to take him into custody.
[03:48:03.280 --> 03:48:04.061]  Nothing happened.
[03:48:04.061 --> 03:48:07.944]  So we look at Bedell, he's got four or five things going for him.
[03:48:07.944 --> 03:48:11.507]  He's got marijuana convictions, feeding convictions, his parents.
[03:48:12.211 --> 03:48:16.675]  Put in a missing persons report, they say he may be armed, may be dangerous.
[03:48:16.675 --> 03:48:18.196]  Nothing happens.
[03:48:18.196 --> 03:48:19.817]  So it seems to me you've got two sides.
[03:48:19.817 --> 03:48:28.404]  If you want to call anybody to account, let's call in George Soros and ask him about the implications of marijuana and narcotics for this case.
[03:48:28.914 --> 03:48:30.575]  Rather than pin it on 9-11.
[03:48:30.575 --> 03:48:33.477]  I don't think you can really use these cases to pin it on anybody.
[03:48:33.477 --> 03:48:40.802]  But in this case, there is a direct role of marijuana in the guy's psychosis, which prepares him for the role that he's been playing.
[03:48:59.134 --> 03:49:10.103]  I think that the most recent one that we should keep our eyes on is, again, Major Hassan, because he's somebody who behaves in a very erratic and outrageous way.
[03:49:10.103 --> 03:49:18.550]  In the case of Major Hassan, the Fort Hood shooter, this is also somebody who's got a secret level clearance, because by virtue of being a Major in the U.S.
[03:49:18.550 --> 03:49:19.391]  Army, he's got this
[03:49:19.921 --> 03:49:22.462]  Clearance, and that would put him normally under special.
[03:49:22.462 --> 03:49:31.164]  And he's emailing this top Al-Qaeda guy who runs all the other patsies over and over again, and then they declare national security on all his emails.
[03:49:31.164 --> 03:49:31.504]  Right.
[03:49:31.504 --> 03:49:32.404]  So he's sheep-dipped.
[03:49:32.404 --> 03:49:45.127]  So essentially, if we look back again, if we look at the Fort Hood, if we look at the Fort Dix-6, if we look at the Miami Haitians, these other cases that we've had,
[03:49:45.598 --> 03:50:05.709]  We can see that the idea of a troubled subject, a subject with mental illness or cognitive impairment, you can also see it in the alleged attempt to blow up the fuel lines going into Kennedy Airport on the part of a kind of a street vagrant who also had a history of mental disease.
[03:50:05.709 --> 03:50:07.390]  So you see this again and again.
[03:50:07.390 --> 03:50:11.852]  It means that these individuals are susceptible to manipulation.
[03:50:11.852 --> 03:50:13.173]  And again, I would like to know
[03:50:13.923 --> 03:50:26.812]  What was Bidell doing during the time from about January 18th, when he seems to have gone back to his home for a short time, and this past week when he showed up... Okay, Webster, I'm going to skip this break.
[03:50:26.812 --> 03:50:30.034]  This is a network break, so it's ours for the stations out there.
[03:50:30.034 --> 03:50:40.300]  We're going to skip the Genesis break right now, finish up with the Patsy background, but then let's expand on why are they running
[03:50:41.161 --> 03:50:43.883]  I think it's an exercise in neo-McCarthyite hysteria.
[03:50:43.883 --> 03:50:47.305]  It is similar to old demagogue Senator Joe McCarthy and the Red Scare of the 1950s.
[03:50:47.305 --> 03:50:49.687]  This time the names of the targets are different.
[03:51:10.836 --> 03:51:20.831]  The immediate setting, and we should be aware of this, is a worldwide revolt against Wall Street and bankers and the International Monetary Fund and the power of bankers.
[03:51:20.831 --> 03:51:21.773]  Just three examples.
[03:51:23.038 --> 03:51:37.292]  The Goldman Sachs attacks Greece is a way of getting at the Euro, and now the people in Greece are told that their health, education, welfare, social safety net wages are all going to be destroyed because Goldman Sachs and George Soros again are attacking the currency.
[03:51:37.292 --> 03:51:43.017]  So they've had one general strike ten days ago, they're going to have another general strike this week, so they're fighting.
[03:51:43.496 --> 03:51:50.460]  Iceland, on Saturday, the referendum, will Iceland pay $6 billion to the British and the Dutch?
[03:51:50.460 --> 03:51:59.004]  It's the equivalent of $130 per person, per month, for the next six to eight years, depending on the interest.
[03:51:59.004 --> 03:52:01.385]  So they say no.
[03:52:01.385 --> 03:52:06.008]  92% of Iceland says no, we will not pay the banks, we will not be slaves of the banks.
[03:52:06.008 --> 03:52:11.210]  And then, in this country, something that I think is very, very significant, we've had on 100 campuses in 33 states,
[03:52:12.876 --> 03:52:26.564]  An upsurge of student activism saying no to tuition cuts, no to increased payments, especially in cases like California, where part of the money is going to go straight into the hands of Wall Street bankers as a result of the bondage.
[03:52:26.564 --> 03:52:31.547]  And it's hard for the media to demonize them as evil right-wing Tea Party people.
[03:52:31.547 --> 03:52:38.271]  Certainly, and their program is also quite different, and I think their program makes a lot more sense than some of these other programs.
[03:52:38.271 --> 03:52:42.073]  So the students are essentially trying to defend their right to an education.
[03:52:42.861 --> 03:52:53.951]  Well, I don't think they have a right to it, but they've paid for it, and we know that the big universities take most of the money and invest it in derivatives, like the University of Texas, so they do have a right to not be ripped off.
[03:52:53.951 --> 03:52:55.113]  Yeah, the large schools.
[03:52:55.113 --> 03:53:03.140]  I mean, look, Harvard, Yale, MIT, Princeton, all the rest of them have lost between one quarter and one third of their endowment because of derivative speculation.
[03:53:03.140 --> 03:53:07.344]  Some lost more, but yeah, so now they're trying to... Larry Summers, up at Harvard, played a big role.
[03:53:08.024 --> 03:53:12.507]  What you see, I think, is the beginning of a mass strike period, but this time a real one.
[03:53:12.507 --> 03:53:24.353]  In other words, real economic self-defense, as the bankers turn the screws and demand more austerity, take away your Social Security, take away your Medicare, take away your unemployment benefits.
[03:53:24.353 --> 03:53:30.477]  They're going to stage events to demonize all of their political opposition, but I don't see this working, Webster.
[03:53:31.542 --> 03:53:34.905]  I think this depends on all of us.
[03:53:34.905 --> 03:53:37.967]  It seems to me that it's a complete red herring.
[03:53:37.967 --> 03:53:48.594]  This is completely outrageous that they want to take some four-year-old scrap of a quote and characterize this mentally ill, criminally insane, homicidal maniac.
[03:53:48.594 --> 03:53:50.535]  But that's more evidence of it being staged.
[03:53:50.535 --> 03:53:55.639]  They were ready within an hour and five minutes to run with this and go after yours truly.
[03:53:55.639 --> 03:53:57.940]  In that case, let's look at the other side of it now.
[03:53:57.940 --> 03:53:59.361]  Let's look at the Obama White House.
[03:53:59.361 --> 03:54:00.022]  Who do we find?
[03:54:00.430 --> 03:54:02.952]  We find this odd couple, I would say.
[03:54:02.952 --> 03:54:12.538]  Cass Sunstein, who is the regulations czar, and his wife, his new wife of about a year, and that's Samantha Power.
[03:54:12.538 --> 03:54:19.803]  You remember her foul-mouthed interventions during the primary campaign, cursing out Hillary Clinton in a British interview.
[03:54:20.327 --> 03:54:22.268]  Cass Sunstein and Samantha Power.
[03:54:22.268 --> 03:54:27.952]  Samantha Power is now the Director of Multilateral Relations at the National Security Council.
[03:54:27.952 --> 03:54:31.194]  Yeah, Sunstein's calling for provocateur and 9-11 truth.
[03:54:31.194 --> 03:54:37.298]  Right, and therefore we can say Sunstein is obviously a left totalitarian thinker.
[03:54:37.298 --> 03:54:40.760]  Obviously somebody who hates the First Amendment, can't stand normal political process.
[03:54:40.760 --> 03:54:42.721]  He says that, yeah, he says ban freedom.
[03:54:42.721 --> 03:54:45.463]  He says he wants to tax conspiracy theories.
[03:54:45.463 --> 03:54:46.484]  This is unbelievable.
[03:54:47.738 --> 03:54:50.202]  This is an absolute crackpot.
[03:54:50.202 --> 03:54:53.988]  But you see, this is a power couple inside the Obama regime.
[03:54:53.988 --> 03:54:58.094]  Now, when we look at these things that Bidel is alleged to have said,
[03:54:58.678 --> 03:55:04.299]  How do we know that these computer postings on the internet are really from Bedell?
[03:55:04.299 --> 03:55:06.880]  By the way, for those that don't know, you're not just saying this.
[03:55:06.880 --> 03:55:21.443]  Cass Sunstein, a year and a half ago, at Chicago Law School, in conjunction with Harvard, wrote, we will go out on the internet, we will pose as 9-11 truthers and say horrible things, we will infiltrate their groups and try to create violence.
[03:55:21.443 --> 03:55:25.704]  I mean, so you're saying it looks like, well yeah, I mean Cass Sunstein's probably involved in this.
[03:55:26.084 --> 03:55:26.885]  We just don't know.
[03:55:26.885 --> 03:55:35.451]  In other words, it is real folly to take the ravings of a psychotic in any case, but ravings of a psychotic posted on the Internet, which could be anybody.
[03:55:35.451 --> 03:55:37.172]  This could be an intelligence agency.
[03:55:37.172 --> 03:55:37.853]  My gosh.
[03:55:37.853 --> 03:55:40.175]  The National Security Council can certainly do these things.
[03:55:40.175 --> 03:55:46.719]  Well, in closing, separately, Adam Gadon, this ADL guy, they claim they captured him yesterday and then announced, oh, we didn't capture him.
[03:55:46.719 --> 03:55:50.182]  I mean, this is just like three weeks ago when they claimed they captured No.
[03:55:50.182 --> 03:55:52.464]  2 in Taliban, and the next day said they didn't do it.
[03:55:52.464 --> 03:55:54.986]  That's an intelligence op where they throw it out.
[03:55:55.666 --> 03:55:59.287]  And then set the precedent that they can just lie and get away with it.
[03:55:59.287 --> 03:56:01.788]  Well, maybe they want to remind us who this character is.
[03:56:01.788 --> 03:56:10.070]  All I can say with this Adam Gidon is that his story is very fishy, and it seemed to me to be fishy for the last several years.
[03:56:10.070 --> 03:56:12.070]  Maybe they'll get their story together.
[03:56:12.070 --> 03:56:19.172]  But it seems like they want to remind us who he is, so that if they do claim to have captured him, it won't be ho-hum, it will be, oh, the most wanted
[03:56:21.165 --> 03:56:37.709]  I think it's because they want to use this to launch a situation of the neo-McCarthyite demonization of any kind of critical or opposition thinking.
[03:56:37.709 --> 03:56:42.009]  And again, I think it has to do with the fact that we're going into some kind of a mass strike period.
[03:56:42.009 --> 03:56:44.550]  You could see the American labor movement now
[03:56:45.225 --> 03:56:46.466]  Returning to life.
[03:56:46.466 --> 03:56:56.477]  Because if the students can come back to life after decades of the campuses being political graveyards, the labor movement... Obama has just gone through his Petco moment.
[03:56:56.477 --> 03:57:00.982]  Remember when Ronald Reagan broke and destroyed the air traffic controllers union?
[03:57:00.982 --> 03:57:06.288]  Last week we had this school in Rhode Island where a bunch of teachers were fired.
[03:57:06.716 --> 03:57:13.858]  Outrageously fired by the administration, and Obama and his Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, come out and say, that's great!
[03:57:13.858 --> 03:57:14.878]  That's what we should do!
[03:57:14.878 --> 03:57:15.898]  Fire the teachers!
[03:57:15.898 --> 03:57:17.359]  Bust the union!
[03:57:17.359 --> 03:57:19.119]  Reagan did it with Patco.
[03:57:19.119 --> 03:57:21.120]  Obama's now having his Reagan moment.
[03:57:21.120 --> 03:57:22.300]  He's channeling Reagan.
[03:57:22.300 --> 03:57:31.342]  And you said that that would be his specialty as this Bill and Melinda Gates, Ford Foundation funded minion, fake left cover.
[03:57:31.342 --> 03:57:34.843]  His job in Chicago was breaking up the unions.
[03:57:36.417 --> 03:57:38.741]  And again, love the unions, hate them.
[03:57:38.741 --> 03:57:41.525]  They're destroying any way we can politically organize.
[03:57:53.288 --> 03:57:54.989]  Everything must go to the bankers.
[03:57:54.989 --> 03:57:56.050]  Well, I'll say this, Webster.
[03:57:56.050 --> 03:57:59.572]  I believe they're getting ready to stage more terror attacks and blame it on 9-11 Truth.
[03:57:59.572 --> 03:58:01.073]  More to blame the Tea Party.
[03:58:01.073 --> 03:58:02.734]  More to blame the in-the-fetters.
[03:58:02.734 --> 03:58:04.395]  I want to put you on hold here at the end of the show.
[03:58:04.395 --> 03:58:09.058]  I try to schedule you in the next week for a full hour, so we're not as breakneck.
[03:58:09.058 --> 03:58:10.719]  We'll put you on hold right now, Webster.
[03:58:10.719 --> 03:58:11.560]  We're out of time.
[03:58:11.560 --> 03:58:14.002]  Incredibly jam-packed transmission.

[03:58:31.967 --> 03:58:33.247]  Great job of the crew.
[03:58:33.247 --> 03:58:35.208]  Some very informative guests tomorrow.
[03:58:35.208 --> 03:58:38.528]  We'll go to Iceland, the front line of the fight against the bankers.
[03:58:38.528 --> 03:58:41.009]  They just said no to their takeover.
[03:58:41.009 --> 03:58:42.630]  God bless you all, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:58:42.630 --> 03:58:43.710]  We can, we must prevail.
[03:58:46.917 --> 03:58:50.438]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:50.438 --> 03:58:55.119]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:55.119 --> 03:58:59.661]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:59.661 --> 03:59:00.581]  Number one.
[03:59:00.581 --> 03:59:04.002]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:04.002 --> 03:59:04.862]  Number two.
[03:59:04.862 --> 03:59:09.743]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:09.743 --> 03:59:10.504]  It's true.
[03:59:10.504 --> 03:59:15.045]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:15.365 --> 03:59:16.186]  Number 3.
[03:59:16.186 --> 03:59:19.770]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:19.770 --> 03:59:23.695]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:23.695 --> 03:59:24.496]  Number 4.
[03:59:24.496 --> 03:59:27.259]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:59:27.259 --> 03:59:30.943]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:30.943 --> 03:59:31.164]  Number 5.
[03:59:31.704 --> 03:59:35.609]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
