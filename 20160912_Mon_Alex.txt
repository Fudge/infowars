[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  To Monday, the 12th of September, 2000, at 16, the fall of the globalist has begun.
[00:12.000 --> 00:16.000]  If we press the advantage, now is the time to go for the throat.
[00:16.000 --> 00:33.000]  This is the InfoWars.com News Center, deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas broadcasting worldwide. You're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[00:33.000 --> 00:41.000]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000]  You're witnessing 21st century warfare.
[00:46.000 --> 00:59.000]  We have the truth. They have the lies. We take the field. They fall.
[00:59.000 --> 01:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are seeing the stuff of history books. There has never been a US election with this much intrigue.
[01:13.000 --> 01:23.000]  Sure, Bobby Kennedy got gunned down at the Ambassador Hotel in California in front of everybody. JFK got his head blown off in Dallas.
[01:23.000 --> 01:30.000]  There's been some incredible stuff, but those were big events, but isolated. It's ongoing.
[01:30.000 --> 01:40.000]  As the establishment media tries to defend the Clinton crime family, they are burning themselves up. They are immolating themselves in their lives.
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  Everyone sees through it.
[01:43.000 --> 01:56.000]  Scientific studies show between a 6 and 9% trust rate in mainstream media. The AP says 6%. And by the way, they're right there, right there at the bottom of the barrel for mistrust.
[01:56.000 --> 02:25.000]  And the exercise we've seen in the controlled corporate media in trying to poo poo Hillary Clinton, clearly having a seizure, clearly collapsing in New York because of the incredible heat of 80 degrees max, is illustrative of how these people are going for broke and have nothing to lose because they've basically already lost.
[02:25.000 --> 02:37.000]  Now, we've had medical doctors on and there have been massive numbers of medical doctors on record, including what 70 plus percent in a major national medical association who were polled last week.
[02:37.000 --> 02:47.000]  We got to pull that article again that came out and said the National Association of Doctors and Surgeons that clearly she's got serious medical problems.
[02:47.000 --> 03:00.000]  Dr. Drew, who's not some right wing Republican, came out and said she's clearly got serious medical problems and he was fired. And then you see Hillary collapsing.
[03:00.000 --> 03:16.000]  She has these smaller seizures, but sometimes they get more intense. That's why there is a individual, the mystery man, the black man that orders the secret service around, who is there with the EpiPen for convulsions.
[03:16.000 --> 03:31.000]  This is the reality. I have family that has epilepsy. I know what it looks like when you're sitting there at the dinner table with somebody and they start going, and you know, it was a really good day at work today.
[03:31.000 --> 03:39.000]  And they go, boom. I mean, this is what it looks like, ladies and gentlemen. And then they just sit there and go, no, you're conspiracy theorist.
[03:39.000 --> 03:48.000]  I was in the hospital and I was walking down the hall and I saw Hillary the way she looks. I'd say that's a patient right there. She looks like hell.
[03:48.000 --> 03:57.000]  And then you've got the coughing fits going on for years and over a year in the hospital and secretive brain surgeries and not releasing your full medical records.
[03:57.000 --> 04:09.000]  We had our reporters in Ohio last week and there's an ambulance and then Hillary goes in a tent for 45 minutes. They rush in with a big gurney. There's EMTs in body armor.
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  Then she comes out, gives a speech, has to cancel it. She's coughing and hacking so bad.
[04:17.000 --> 04:28.000]  And then she has to go back in the medical care and they're trying to hide the stretcher. The media wouldn't even touch it, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:28.000 --> 04:38.000]  You talk about going down with the ship. Here's the word I've gotten from people high level in government. Hillary Clinton had a brain tumor removed in 2012.
[04:38.000 --> 04:47.000]  She's had a lot of complications and strokes from it and has fallen down in her head many times as you saw from the epileptic seizure.
[04:47.000 --> 04:53.000]  We have Secret Service sources a month ago that told you about the lifts on the vehicles that have now been photographed.
[04:53.000 --> 05:01.000]  We have real sources. How many big national stories have we broken? Hundreds because we got the guts to do it. Full story coming up.
[05:01.000 --> 05:11.000]  The Democratic National Committee set to hold an emergency meeting during which it will consider replacing Hillary Clinton as a presidential candidate after her collapse in New York during the September 11th Memorial.
[05:11.000 --> 05:21.000]  Democratic Party operatives will stage a crisis summit during which they will decide what to do given Hillary's health problems and the apparent effort by her campaign to cover them up according to the Emmy award winning broadcaster David Shuster.
[05:21.000 --> 05:32.000]  A DNC insider told Shuster that the combination of her campaign hiding Hillary's pneumonia for the past three days from the media and the shocking footage in her fall in New York City represented, quote, unchartered political territory.
[05:32.000 --> 05:37.000]  And another insider said powerful donors are now preparing for the worst if Hillary has to drop out of the race.
[05:37.000 --> 05:45.000]  The mainstream media is upset that Hillary hid the pneumonia, but of course that's not the only health issue she's been hiding, as info wars exhaustively documented over the past several months.
[05:45.000 --> 05:54.000]  A Clinton ally even told Politico, quote, the Clintons have this notion that they only need to go as far as they need to in terms of disclosure, but they can't afford to approach this that way.
[05:54.000 --> 06:23.000]  And to find out more, visit infowars.com and the Alex Jones channel on YouTube. This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[06:24.000 --> 06:31.000]  Your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[06:31.000 --> 06:39.000]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves.
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  The general public doesn't. The Alexa pure breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[06:45.000 --> 06:55.000]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean. This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[06:55.000 --> 07:16.000]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today.

[08:23.000 --> 08:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[08:33.000 --> 08:40.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[08:40.000 --> 09:05.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are kicking off a new week.
[09:05.000 --> 09:11.000]  It is Monday, the 12th day of September, 2016.
[09:11.000 --> 09:18.000]  Hillary Clinton was there at a 9-11 Ground Zero Memorial in the morning.
[09:18.000 --> 09:27.000]  And she unexpectedly suddenly had to be whisked away. There's video of her aide getting her by the arm and helping her along.
[09:27.000 --> 09:35.000]  And then there is footage shot as she goes out towards a van and is leaned up against a guardrail.
[09:35.000 --> 09:44.000]  Clearly begins having a seizure. Her legs buckle under her and she is drugged by three people.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  Completely dead weight into the vehicle.
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  Hillary can never give speeches more than 10 minutes. She's never in public more than 30 minutes.
[09:55.000 --> 10:03.000]  She has coughing fits everywhere she goes for over a year. This is not pneumonia.
[10:03.000 --> 10:14.000]  Remember, first she said yesterday that she had been overheated.
[10:14.000 --> 10:24.000]  Then she told us about the diagnosis of pneumonia Friday by her doctor.
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  She said that three years ago when she was trying to refuse to testify to Congress that she had pneumonia.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  We've gone back and looked. We have those articles.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this story has so many parts to it, but we, as you know, have been right on top of it.
[10:39.000 --> 10:44.000]  The only other news organization more on top of it than us has been DrudgeReport.com.
[10:44.000 --> 10:50.000]  In fact, I'm very proud of the fact we've been on this since the very beginning.
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  I'm very proud of the fact that we do our research and tell the truth and have our sources.
[10:54.000 --> 10:59.000]  We have been given the credit for the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson's,
[10:59.000 --> 11:04.000]  has had brain surgery, a brain tumor, has special lifts to get into vehicles.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  It's now been confirmed, by the way, but the truth is Matt Drudge started looking at this the most in 2012
[11:10.000 --> 11:15.000]  because she suddenly looked like hell and was disappearing for six months at a time.
[11:15.000 --> 11:21.000]  We've been on it since then, but it isn't about who gets the credit.
[11:21.000 --> 11:24.000]  It's about who tells the truth around here.
[11:24.000 --> 11:32.000]  And the woman looks like she's on her last legs, literally and figuratively pun intended.
[11:32.000 --> 11:38.000]  Now, the bigger issue here is we have USA Today, US News and World Report,
[11:38.000 --> 11:45.000]  and a bunch of other establishment organs starting two weeks ago.
[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  It just boom out of the blue.
[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  What happens if Hillary Clinton dies or Trump dies?
[11:51.000 --> 11:57.000]  What happens? Oh, it goes to the Electoral College or we suspend the election.
[11:57.000 --> 11:58.000]  In fact, there's the headline.
[11:58.000 --> 12:01.000]  A candidate's death could delay or eliminate the presidential election.
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  Steve Nelson, US News and World Report.
[12:04.000 --> 12:10.000]  Now, they'll have Rachel Maddow and everybody come out and say that I said that.
[12:10.000 --> 12:12.000]  And then misrepresent. No.
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  We've been saying Trump starts going ahead of her in the polls.
[12:16.000 --> 12:18.000]  Will they have an assassination attempt?
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  Will she mysteriously die?
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  Then to make us feel sad for the Democrats to get Joe Biden or Mr. Cain in.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  And by the way, it's now mainstream news today.
[12:31.000 --> 12:39.000]  Newsmax Associated Press, you name it, that they are looking at Joe Biden stepping in.
[12:39.000 --> 12:44.000]  As the main presidential candidate with Cain under him.
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  And of course, you've been saying all along, they've been holding him back in the ready.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  So, so understand these stories are all up on info wars.com.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  They are meeting in DC right now.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  This is official.
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.000]  Where is the press?
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  Oh, obviously not there.
[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  The DNC is meeting right now on forcing Hillary Clinton out and making her stand down.
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.000]  Because she's the kingpin.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  She's got the blackmail info.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  She ran the White House under her husband the first time.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  But she's run out of gas.
[13:11.000 --> 13:15.000]  As she grasps for power, as she tries to remain the emperor, like a scene from the dark crystal,
[13:15.000 --> 13:22.000]  as she collapses into, into dust from which she came, dust you've came, dust you will return.
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  And they're openly, we have the links to the mainstream news articles on info wars.com.
[13:27.000 --> 13:31.000]  And articles written by Paul Watson and Steve Watson, who are so prolific.
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  Paul's written seven articles the last 10 hours.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  Hadn't slept in two days because this is all breaking so fast.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  I was up till three in the morning working.
[13:39.000 --> 13:45.000]  So was Zimmerman and do we understand how important this is.
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  So now we have mainstream news saying Hillary dragged into van after feigning.
[13:49.000 --> 13:53.000]  She didn't faint. She had a convulsion, an epileptic seizure.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  Can Bernie or Biden replace her?
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  Yes, that's what the news is saying.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  So for me, that's the bigger issue.
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  We've won the debate that Hillary is seriously ill.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  I mean, everywhere she goes, even when she's walking with governors at a plant,
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  the men are all around her ready to grab her arms.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  She's got this handler who we've now discovered the identity of.
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.000]  We have a special report on that, the black man with the EpiPen right behind her.
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  When somebody asks her a question, he sees her start getting dizzy and flipping out.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  It's okay. It's okay. Keep going. Keep going.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  And you see Hillary kind of come back in.
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.000]  And I've had family.
[14:30.000 --> 14:34.000]  My uncle was in a big motorcycle accident and he's on the right medications now
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.000]  and actually got a brain implant so he doesn't have as many.
[14:36.000 --> 14:41.000]  But I've seen him many times start having one and you can go, Joe, Joe, come back to me.
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.000]  Just settle down. Everything's going to be all right.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  And he'll come out of the little, he calls them quizlings,
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  but I guess their quizzles is his little nickname for him.
[14:49.000 --> 14:52.000]  I've probably seen him have a quizzle up 200 times.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  I've seen him have big seizures.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  I mean, he's on the ground convulsing and spit coming out of him and everything else.
[14:58.000 --> 15:00.000]  And that's what goes on with Hillary, folks.
[15:00.000 --> 15:02.000]  In fact, you can even see about how they're getting in the truck.
[15:02.000 --> 15:03.000]  She's really starting to go.
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.000]  And look, if she tries to stay on the campaign trail, she's going to have full blown ones.
[15:07.000 --> 15:14.000]  She's having these, these Pakeet malls or these baby mall seizures.
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  Anybody can see that.
[15:15.000 --> 15:16.000]  And the doctors have all seen it.
[15:16.000 --> 15:23.000]  That's the head going in circles and she's trained herself to be able to come out of it.
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  But that's why she can't be on stage more than 10 minutes because folks,
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  she's having these seizures a lot, which means it's progressing.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  Probably the brain tumor is back and they just want to get her to protect the whole dynasty
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  into office to put their people in one more time.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  And they are trying to carry this corpse over the line.
[15:42.000 --> 15:43.000]  This is biblical.
[15:43.000 --> 15:45.000]  This is like a Greek tragedy.
[15:45.000 --> 15:50.000]  This is unprecedented edge of your seat.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  I mean, I can't even sleep at this point.
[15:52.000 --> 15:53.000]  I went to bed at 3am.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  I shot out of bed at 6am.
[15:57.000 --> 15:59.000]  I had half a cup of coffee.
[15:59.000 --> 16:05.000]  Don't even need coffee now because this is just unbelievable.
[16:05.000 --> 16:13.000]  And to see Rachel Maddow and all these people get up there and attack us and lie about us,
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  how stupid they look and how desperate they are and how they misrepresented Rachel Maddow.
[16:17.000 --> 16:18.000]  I'm going to play this clip first.
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  Last week in a hour long disinformation piece, we played like 13 minutes of it.
[16:24.000 --> 16:31.000]  Lied about us, cut clips together, spun things, took satire we've done, took it out of context.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  But at the very first, she said, info wars, she's showing on screen, says that Hillary
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  can't walk and always has a wheelchair.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  We've all just been imagining we saw her walk.
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.000]  We didn't say that.
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.000]  We said the Secret Service contacted us at the RNC and said get ready for information
[16:46.000 --> 16:53.000]  the next two weeks, three weeks later, through our contacts, curried by hand, not over digital media.
[16:53.000 --> 16:57.000]  We were given the intel that they won't tell us what it is.
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.000]  She's falling down all the time.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  It's getting much worse.
[17:00.000 --> 17:03.000]  She can hardly go out in public more than 15, 20 minutes.
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.000]  We've got lifts on the vehicles that cost over $250,000.
[17:07.000 --> 17:11.000]  It's so hard to keep this secret.
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  You're going to see a big announcement soon.
[17:13.000 --> 17:15.000]  We think it's a brain tumor.
[17:15.000 --> 17:17.000]  And then I talked to some high level CIA people.
[17:17.000 --> 17:18.000]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  And they said, well, I can either confirm nor deny that there is a brain tumor,
[17:22.000 --> 17:28.000]  but there was a brain tumor when she spent a year in the hospital in 2012, 2013.
[17:28.000 --> 17:34.000]  So you don't start having seizures so bad, you can't be out in public more than 15, 20 minutes.
[17:34.000 --> 17:36.000]  And notice that's why she looks so drugged.
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  They got to drug her up with the drugs that suppress the neurons, the suppressants,
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  so that you don't have a convulsion.
[17:44.000 --> 17:50.000]  So that's why she looks so high when she gives a speech or is in public.
[17:50.000 --> 17:53.000]  That's why she has to will herself to even have any energy.
[17:53.000 --> 17:54.000]  I really, I'm going to be honest with you.
[17:54.000 --> 17:55.000]  I feel sorry for Hillary Clinton.
[17:55.000 --> 17:58.000]  I'm going to skip this network break because this is so important.
[17:58.000 --> 18:01.000]  Now, if you're a radio listener, obviously you can hear me break all this down.
[18:01.000 --> 18:08.000]  The videos are all on infowars.com, presidentplanet.com, projectport.com has amazing coverage.
[18:08.000 --> 18:16.000]  But everybody should go to infowars.com, forward slash show to see the video, the articles,
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  the documents we're showing here on air that back up everything we're saying.
[18:19.000 --> 18:27.000]  But first, here's Maddow that I played on Friday, opening up her hour long attack piece of disinformation.
[18:27.000 --> 18:31.000]  Trying to discredit us because if the mainstream media ever picks up what we're covering
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.000]  or even the new alt media does, which has already happened, they are done.
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  Because we are on target.
[18:38.000 --> 18:42.000]  Let me tell you, the average news agency wouldn't even talk to the secret service.
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  Do you have any idea how dangerous this is, what we're doing?
[18:45.000 --> 18:48.000]  I'm not up here snake handling for fun, okay?
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  I'm doing this because I have a duty. This is real.
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  That's why it's come out about the lifts on the vehicles. It's happening.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.000]  The secret service cannot believe what they're seeing.
[18:58.000 --> 19:02.000]  In their history, they've never gone public to people.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  But it's that crazy.
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.000]  Quote, worse than you know, Alex, worse than you say.
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.000]  Worse.
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.000]  Fongino hasn't even told me anything. They've been breaking in his house, cars, you name it.
[19:16.000 --> 19:21.000]  You imagine the other people the danger they're in?
[19:21.000 --> 19:25.000]  I mean, this is what journalists are supposed to do, stick their necks out for their country.
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  This is happening.
[19:27.000 --> 19:33.000]  And by the way, within an hour of us putting the video up last night, it was being removed all over.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  This is public interest video.
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  This is a major election.
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  You can't sit there and try to charge media outlets for 10 seconds of footage of a public figure collapsing
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  and try to gouge little mom and pop media organizations.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  AP wouldn't pay the bounty they wanted.
[19:50.000 --> 19:55.000]  I guess in the middle of the night, Paul Watson did, which is fine, but I'm going to get back with these people
[19:55.000 --> 20:00.000]  and probably start a legal case over this because I'm not going to set the precedent of paying tens of thousands of dollars,
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  3,000 already, to be able to show you this information
[20:04.000 --> 20:07.000]  and pay more money every time I show it to you.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  But you know what? This information is going out.
[20:09.000 --> 20:14.000]  They tried to not show this all day yesterday on mainstream media until this morning they started showing it.
[20:14.000 --> 20:19.000]  And it's because of the real media, DrudgeReport.com, Infowars.com, that the public's even able to see this.
[20:19.000 --> 20:22.000]  Or Rachel Maddow, if they could really control the web, which they're trying to do,
[20:22.000 --> 20:26.000]  she could up there and say, there was no video of Hillary collapsing.
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.000]  In fact, they've already done it. They say this is just stumbling.
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  In fact, let's show CNN. CNN.
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  Hillary stumbles in New York.
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  I sent you guys that article.
[20:40.000 --> 20:46.000]  We're going to show that moment, but let's go ahead and play Rachel Maddow last week. Here it is.
[20:46.000 --> 20:50.000]  Do you also know that Hillary Clinton uses a wheelchair?
[20:50.000 --> 20:57.000]  Her personal vehicle has had to be outfitted with a wheelchair lift because she is not a person who can actually walk.
[20:57.000 --> 21:02.000]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times you think you've seen her walking. She hasn't been walking.
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  Did you know that? Did you also know that Hillary Clinton has Parkinson's disease?
[21:07.000 --> 21:13.000]  No, these things are true. I know they are true because I read them in the headlines.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.000]  Here was the shock headline on Hillary Clinton's wheelchair vehicle.
[21:18.000 --> 21:23.000]  Just one column over from that, there was also this seemingly competing news.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  Hillary Clinton, does Hillary Clinton have Parkinson's disease?
[21:27.000 --> 21:33.000]  The subhead there, we can all see she has some very serious health problems.
[21:33.000 --> 21:51.000]  Now, what they don't tell you is on the article she's sewing the headline of right under it are mainstream photos of Hillary getting out of her vehicle with the lift on it with the wheelchair.
[21:51.000 --> 21:59.000]  Now, the Secret Service intelligence she was using a wheelchair, they said there's major lifts on it because she can't get in the vehicles.
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  So, it was worse than we were saying. We apologize.
[22:04.000 --> 22:07.000]  And the Secret Service said, listen, we don't want to give you more info.
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.000]  We're just trying to point you in public information you can already find. Send your reporters to her rallies.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  You're going to see medical personnel. You're going to see the lifts.
[22:17.000 --> 22:23.000]  You're going to see some interesting things because here's the secret. She's falling down every hour reportedly.
[22:23.000 --> 22:35.000]  She was in a medical tent Monday in Ohio with our people 50 yards away held by Secret Service for 45 minutes before she could go give the speech that she had to cancel five minutes in.
[22:35.000 --> 22:41.000]  With medical gurneys and guys in body armor running around like it was the end of the world.
[22:41.000 --> 22:47.000]  We have them, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  And then we've got CNN. Look at this disinformation.
[22:50.000 --> 22:54.000]  Hillary Clinton stumbles. Will her campaign follow?
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  It's not stumbling.
[22:57.000 --> 23:05.000]  It's not stumbling, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  When you completely fall and buckle and they drag you into a vehicle by your knees.
[23:11.000 --> 23:18.000]  How does Rachel Maddow feel now? Well, Rachel Maddow already is a shadow of herself and so is MSNBC.
[23:18.000 --> 23:29.000]  MSNBC just a decade ago had shows with up to five million viewers a night, just as big as Fox.
[23:29.000 --> 23:34.000]  Their biggest shows have a half a million viewers.
[23:34.000 --> 23:44.000]  This show has over a million hour on terrestrial radio and is only in the top 10 of radio shows in the radio portion.
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  Still dwarfing them.
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  Limbaugh has five to six million an hour.
[23:52.000 --> 23:56.000]  Sean Hannity, three or four million an hour. He goes on and on.
[23:56.000 --> 23:59.000]  George Norrie, three or four, five million an hour.
[23:59.000 --> 24:09.000]  They are literal husk, but the newspapers and other globalist media regurgitate what they say to create a facade that they're big and important.
[24:09.000 --> 24:16.000]  So she knows she's discredited. She knows she's a joke. She knows all she has is a big studio.
[24:16.000 --> 24:22.000]  But she gets up there and says that we are saying she can't walk, which we didn't even say.
[24:22.000 --> 24:29.000]  But then three days later, she's falling down on her face.
[24:29.000 --> 24:35.000]  And everybody knows somebody with epileptic problems. It's very sad.
[24:35.000 --> 24:40.000]  It is very serious.
[24:40.000 --> 24:51.000]  My little cousin, Buckley's little brother, had a brain injury when he was a kid, climbed up a roof and fell off of it and died after decades of that complication.
[24:51.000 --> 24:56.000]  And I've experienced this a lot. I know what it looks like. And he did the same thing where he'd be sitting there.
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.000]  And all of a sudden, he just do the head in the circle just like Hillary does.
[25:01.000 --> 25:05.000]  We've all seen it. We all know what a seizure looks like.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  We all know what the start of a seizure looks like.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  We all know Hillary looks like hell.
[25:10.000 --> 25:20.000]  We all know there's a guy walking right beside her with an epipen to stop violent seizures so Hillary doesn't cut her tongue off.
[25:20.000 --> 25:24.000]  You know, I don't mean to make a joke out of this, but let's play this because we got to have some humor.
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  It is weekend at Bernie's.
[25:26.000 --> 25:54.000]  I mean, there's a clip where they're trying to carry his dead body along and got the head dancing like a bobblehead. Let's play that clip.
[25:54.000 --> 26:04.000]  By the way, Rob do is making a larger mix of all this and her falling down and her stumbling and all the rest of it.
[26:04.000 --> 26:13.000]  We need to put the clip of her vomiting up the green balls as well because it's very serious and it's illustrative of how arrogant these people are.
[26:13.000 --> 26:23.000]  Can you imagine this woman in control of the new codes when she's already sold us out all these foreign powers and she's so reckless that she knows she's had all these brain surgeries.
[26:23.000 --> 26:33.000]  She knows she's got all these medical problems and she's got this entire prostitute media ready to lie for her on every single front and prop her up.
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  The problem is the illness is progressing biblically so fast.
[26:38.000 --> 26:46.000]  I mean, this is something out of the Bible. I mean, this is historical. This is crazy. This is legendary. This is the stuff of literature.
[26:46.000 --> 26:57.000]  This is just over the top, redonkulous. And it'd be funny if it wasn't so serious because I want to explain something to everybody.
[26:57.000 --> 27:02.000]  Here are the headlines. A candidate's death could delay or eliminate the presidential election.
[27:02.000 --> 27:09.000]  U.S. News and World Report, August 30th, two weeks ago to the day, two weeks ago.
[27:09.000 --> 27:17.000]  And I said, get ready. She's deteriorating so fast that they're getting it. And I suddenly saw it in a bunch of other publications.
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  You saw it. We all covered it here. Here's our article breaking it down. Could election be suspended if Hillary drops out?
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  I love that we're so conservative that mainstream media said they would suspend it.
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.000]  We just say could they and then we're the conspiracy theorist.
[27:32.000 --> 27:42.000]  Could election be suspended if Hillary drops out? Electoral College could choose the next president. I'm going to break this down when we come back from break because for me, correct me if I'm wrong, I think this is the big story.
[27:42.000 --> 27:53.000]  Also up on infowars.com, DNC to hold emergency meeting to consider replacing Hillary Clinton.
[27:53.000 --> 28:04.000]  They're holding it right now. Paul Watson links to the Politico and the DC source where they're saying this. And I was told by the Secret Service, Joe Biggs was the contact.
[28:04.000 --> 28:12.000]  I said, here, you take this hand grenade. He was happy to take it because he was the original contact and I talked to him there in Cleveland at the RNC.
[28:12.000 --> 28:17.000]  And I said, OK, fine. Biggs, you want to handle it? You go right ahead. Be careful, buddy.
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.000]  But Biggs was like, I think it's a setup. And I said, no, it's not a setup. Look at these guys. They're giving us high fives and stuff.
[28:23.000 --> 28:30.000]  I mean, they just totally know Hillary's evil. But I said, still be really careful. Don't get anything classified, obviously. Just get general info.
[28:30.000 --> 28:37.000]  And again, the Secret Service is just watch your motorcade, watch your vehicles, watch what she does. Just stay on her.
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.000]  Send the media there because the other media won't cover it. And we said, what's happening? And they said, she's falling down all the time.
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.000]  We don't know what's wrong with her, but it's getting bad. There's no way this can go on much longer.
[28:47.000 --> 28:52.000]  I told you all this a month ago on the Sunday show with Biggs for an hour. Go watch the video. We laid it all out.
[28:52.000 --> 29:00.000]  Secret Service doesn't even know what's wrong with her. They just said that she's falling down all the time, having convulsions.
[29:00.000 --> 29:11.000]  They said they heard Parkinson's and then the WikiLeaks comes out two weeks later and says, Hillary, I need Parkinson's medication.
[29:11.000 --> 29:20.000]  I mean, this is pretty much open and shut that she's got serious, serious, serious, serious neurological problems.
[29:20.000 --> 29:30.000]  And most medical doctors and neurologists and brain surgeons I talk to say, it's a tumor, to quote Arnold Schwarzenegger, brain tumor.
[29:30.000 --> 29:36.000]  And I am very sad for Hillary. I pray she repents. I pray she comes to God for her evil before she dies.
[29:36.000 --> 29:43.000]  And I don't wish any harm upon her. This is the time they're going to false flag. This is the time they might kill her, claim some right wing or did it.
[29:43.000 --> 29:51.000]  We need to be heads up right now for serious stuff. We're going to come back, talk about the suspension of the election and stay with us.
[29:51.000 --> 30:10.000]  We're on the March. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:10.000 --> 30:22.000]  In August, Secret Service sources told InfoWars that Hillary's campaign will be forced into making a big announcement soon regarding her medical condition. That announcement came September 11th when her campaign blamed pneumonia for her nasty fall.
[30:22.000 --> 30:30.000]  Although this explanation is already under severe doubt given that the campaign initially lied by claiming Hillary had merely overheated before her collapse in New York.
[30:30.000 --> 30:33.000]  Overheated? The temperature was in the low to mid 70s Fahrenheit.
[30:33.000 --> 30:41.000]  The Secret Service sources also told InfoWars that government vehicles that transport Hillary to campaign events had to be fitted with disabled access to her health.
[30:41.000 --> 30:47.000]  Now we see why in the video shot on September 11th showing Secret Service having to practically carry Hillary into a vehicle.
[30:47.000 --> 30:54.000]  Paul Joseph Watson reported that top DNC strategists are now holding a crisis meeting to discuss whether to replace Hillary with another candidate.
[30:54.000 --> 31:01.000]  So will the establishment attempt to suspend the entire election? To find out more, visit infowars.com. This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[31:25.000 --> 31:29.000]  Orange peel, zeolites and others. Deep cleanse doesn't hold back.

[32:01.000 --> 32:08.000]  We're selling a product, DNA Force, that is the very best nutraceutical that we can produce.
[32:08.000 --> 32:11.000]  Dr. Group, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us.
[32:11.000 --> 32:16.000]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important.
[32:16.000 --> 32:22.000]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[32:22.000 --> 32:25.000]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[32:25.000 --> 32:27.000]  And when it runs out, you start dying.
[32:27.000 --> 32:31.000]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials.
[32:31.000 --> 32:36.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world. It works like an antioxidant.
[32:36.000 --> 32:39.000]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.

[33:18.000 --> 33:23.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:23.000 --> 33:34.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:34.000 --> 33:43.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have the globalist attempting to put a quadruple international spy.
[33:43.000 --> 33:48.000]  Hillary Clinton, who openly works for the Communist Chinese, we have all the WikiLeaks proof,
[33:48.000 --> 33:56.000]  who works directly with the Chinese president and sells favors and contact.
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  I didn't even think of that. It's worse than I can even imagine.
[33:59.000 --> 34:06.000]  Who's just selling us out with the Saudis, selling us out to all these jihadi groups,
[34:06.000 --> 34:10.000]  who is just involved in every crime you could imagine.
[34:10.000 --> 34:17.000]  She wants to shut down the alternative right media openly in email fundraisers that have her signature on it.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  And then people go, oh, well, she didn't write that.
[34:19.000 --> 34:27.000]  And a week later, she goes and gives a speech and says, I have a dark heart and then I'm evil and bad and so is Donald Trump.
[34:27.000 --> 34:32.000]  They're coming for us, people. They're coming for you. They are conquering this country.
[34:32.000 --> 34:40.000]  They want to get the bitter clingers, the gun owners, the Christians, the people they can't control.
[34:40.000 --> 34:48.000]  And they are hyping total racial division, Soros is funding all these full rotten football players to say America's evil on 9-11
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  and America, you know, deserved it because we attack all these innocent countries.
[34:52.000 --> 34:57.000]  No, the globalists attack countries in our name and we shouldn't have gone along with it.
[34:57.000 --> 35:00.000]  And the globalists work with the radical Islamists.
[35:00.000 --> 35:04.000]  But I'm going to break all that down today as well.
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.000]  And Kaepernick, who I've held my tongue on, but now has just gone too far.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  But here's the big news.
[35:11.000 --> 35:18.000]  The mainstream media, we're going to play a compilation of this in a moment, has been trying to sit there with a straight face.
[35:18.000 --> 35:31.000]  I've got one clip here where the MSNBC host, I've also got to see an in-host, gets Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC
[35:31.000 --> 35:35.000]  and goes, Trump is far worse about covering up his health than Hillary.
[35:35.000 --> 35:39.000]  And I am a little concerned that she wasn't honest with us about this pneumonia.
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.000]  She hasn't had pneumonia since 2012 where she keeps falling down in public.
[35:44.000 --> 35:50.000]  She hasn't had pneumonia for two years where she can't give a speech without hacking up a lung.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  And it goes on and on and on.
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  Seeing it in, oh, she stumbled a little.
[35:55.000 --> 36:00.000]  No, she's standing there and starts having a seizure.
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.000]  The handler gets over to hit her with the EpiPen, that's clear, not soon enough.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  And then she goes into a full seizure and collapses.
[36:10.000 --> 36:14.000]  And that's exactly what people do with the seizure, is they'll be standing there and have their balance for a minute
[36:14.000 --> 36:22.000]  and all of a sudden, boom, they'll fall with a ton of bricks, they're heading to the ground, and that usually ends up killing you.
[36:22.000 --> 36:29.000]  Because you get serious brain injuries and Hillary is having more and more and more.
[36:29.000 --> 36:35.000]  This is legendary because the mainstream media completely hits their wagon of this lie.
[36:35.000 --> 36:42.000]  The mainstream media did everything they could to prop this up and now it is going to discredit them even more.
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  It is unbelievable.
[36:45.000 --> 36:53.000]  They can't stand the fact that DrudgeReport.com and Infowars.com lead the narrative and that Trump, who's a smart guy
[36:53.000 --> 36:58.000]  and has top generals advising him, tunes into what we're saying and concurs with the analysis.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  They can't stand that.
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  Of course, Trump knows about election fraud and is challenging it.
[37:04.000 --> 37:07.000]  Hillary stole the nomination. Of course he challenged it.
[37:07.000 --> 37:13.000]  So now you have to run in and quote, take over the election to protect it from election fraud that doesn't exist.
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  What's that do to our credibility?
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  When we set the mark, it goes up.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  What happens to your credibility? It goes down.
[37:21.000 --> 37:25.000]  But I gotta tell you, there's not much further down you can go with a 6% trust rate.
[37:25.000 --> 37:29.000]  You're a joke. I bust my brain.
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  I work 18 hours a day, many days.
[37:31.000 --> 37:34.000]  Really trying to know the truth.
[37:34.000 --> 37:37.000]  I don't just sit here and make stuff up and you know it.
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  You can't stand it.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  You people hate your jobs.
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  I've talked to a lot of these so-called big-wig TV hosts and folks.
[37:44.000 --> 37:46.000]  They can't stand what they're doing.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  Most of them on the side go, we love what you're doing. Please don't be mean to us.
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.000]  Hopefully once it all collapses, we can come work for you.
[37:53.000 --> 37:58.000]  I've sat here with major national anchors who basically,
[37:58.000 --> 38:01.000]  when you finally go out to dinner with them and you're having drinks with them, having a glass of wine,
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  they basically say, God, Alex, where's all this going? What are we going to do?
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  So much what you say is true.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  I think you were a kook, but it's all happening.
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  I'm not the kook.
[38:11.000 --> 38:14.000]  I'm reading globalist white papers that are public that are so nightmarish.
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  I can't believe it either.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  I know this stuff sounds crazy.
[38:19.000 --> 38:23.000]  But it was very fitting when I'm talking about how they're going to drug the food and water supply
[38:23.000 --> 38:29.000]  in their own words to where we become asexual creatures that aren't male or female.
[38:29.000 --> 38:37.000]  And it's Rachel Maddow making fun of me when she is the new future human.
[38:37.000 --> 38:43.000]  She's what I'm saying they're going to do from their own words and she's it.
[38:43.000 --> 38:51.000]  And she doesn't even get it or understand it when she's looking at it with her own eyeballs.
[38:51.000 --> 38:57.000]  All of this is about ending us as humans, putting the AI goggles on our head.
[38:57.000 --> 39:01.000]  I'm going to reset and get into all the news, go through all the headlines, play these clips right now,
[39:01.000 --> 39:05.000]  a bunch of key Trump clips, so many guys coming up today.
[39:05.000 --> 39:11.000]  I want to bring Joe Biggs in here too because he's really been on top of this with the Secret Service information.
[39:11.000 --> 39:17.000]  He brought us spot on and something I gave him the dangerous jobs.
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  He wants them. It's like, I'm going to go up there with the communists, burn the flag and cover you or do you want to do it?
[39:21.000 --> 39:25.000]  I said, no, Biggs, you go get the glory.
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  And the same thing with this. I'm like, yeah, okay, Secret Service.
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  He's like, I want it. I want it. I want it.
[39:30.000 --> 39:34.000]  I said, I said, buddy, I got plenty on my plate. You take it.
[39:34.000 --> 39:38.000]  Now this is real dangerous. You want this hand grenade because I'm still standing right next to him with the hand grenade.
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.000]  But he's got the hand grenade in his hand. Or let's say he was like a, like a kangaroo.
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  He's got it in his little pouch. I'm standing right next to him.
[39:47.000 --> 39:50.000]  But I don't think the audience really, really gets what we're doing here.
[39:50.000 --> 39:56.000]  This is not tiddling winks we're playing. This is the real world, folks, why they hate it so much.
[39:56.000 --> 40:02.000]  We know what we're doing. And the Patriots and the government understand what's going on as well.
[40:02.000 --> 40:06.000]  This is a full gutting of the country.
[40:06.000 --> 40:15.000]  And I want to make it clear to us. There's this talking point out there that Alex is gone from bashing the police to doing everything you can to defend them, no matter what they do.
[40:15.000 --> 40:24.000]  I wanted to stop the globalists from federalizing the police. I wanted to stop the militarization so the globalists couldn't cause this class of civilizations and divide and conquer.
[40:24.000 --> 40:31.000]  We've now gotten to the actual civil war part and the police actually woke up to a great extent.
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  So now we're actually more and more opposing the New World Order, which is what we need to do.
[40:36.000 --> 40:42.000]  And so this is a good thing to celebrate. We've got problems in America and we can fix them together as Americans later.
[40:42.000 --> 40:48.000]  But we're not going to have George Soros and the New World Order come in here and cause a huge civil war.
[40:48.000 --> 40:54.000]  We're going to wake people up. We're going to fight the globalists. We're going to expose them. We're going to discredit them.
[40:54.000 --> 41:03.000]  And they're going to physically move against us, probably. And that's when the carpet is going to get pulled up out from under their tottering asses.
[41:03.000 --> 41:12.000]  Okay? You don't understand what's going on here. This isn't a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:12.000 --> 41:20.000]  We have history. We have will. We have God. We have our ancestors. We have common sense. We have survival instinct on our side.
[41:20.000 --> 41:25.000]  And people that don't choose a side and join the Republic are fools.
[41:25.000 --> 41:31.000]  They want us in fighting racially, religiously, according to region.
[41:31.000 --> 41:40.000]  It's an obvious plan. Soros admits it's a plan. They've given billions, 100 million two weeks ago from the Ford Foundation to BLM alone.
[41:40.000 --> 41:49.000]  It's on, folks. They mean business. This is so simple.
[41:49.000 --> 41:54.000]  All right. Let me continue. Look, I barely plugged last week and we're not bringing in the capital we need.
[41:54.000 --> 42:01.000]  I'll just be honest. I'm hiring new people. I'm expanding in the face of the globalists. It's my duty. I don't want to blow the small reserves we have.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  I need those. Believe me. Look at all this copyright crap.
[42:05.000 --> 42:12.000]  Just trying to show you the video of her collapsing that they thought they could shut down web-wide, but everybody's spreading it.
[42:12.000 --> 42:20.000]  I need folks to go to m4warstore.com and buy Hillary for Prison Shirts at cost for $9.95. That includes shipping.
[42:20.000 --> 42:30.000]  There's a tab there where you can pay $19.95, so we make $10, which we certainly need. This shirt needs to be everywhere.
[42:30.000 --> 42:36.000]  It helps bring people together. It helps expose the globalists. It helps you realize the power of the people and to meet like-minded folks.
[42:36.000 --> 42:45.000]  It's so important you get a Molan Lave shirt or a Hillary for Prison shirt or many of the other hundreds of great t-shirts we've got at m4warstore.com.
[42:45.000 --> 42:52.000]  But separately in this world with all this globalism going on and all this destabilization, you need to be prepared.
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  And we are only running this special until Tuesday or Wednesday. I probably get into Tuesday.
[42:56.000 --> 43:02.000]  We only do this once a year normally. I'm doing it every two, three, four months now because things are so serious.
[43:02.000 --> 43:14.000]  30 to 40% off the super high quality, storable food, powered by my Patriot supply at m4warstore.com or m4warselect.com.
[43:14.000 --> 43:23.000]  The full spectrum of my Patriot food, private labeled by us, exact same food just as fresh, but I can contractually, because of private labeling, go 30 to 40% off.
[43:23.000 --> 43:29.000]  In the contract, it says once a year, but we got them to change it. That's how I've been able to do this.
[43:29.000 --> 43:35.000]  So again, this is a major, major deal. No one can top this.
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  And the free market system is get you prepared, get you what you need.
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  It would be such a good deal that even though we make much less money on each sale, we sell a lot more.
[43:44.000 --> 43:50.000]  m4warstore.com, m4warselect.com.
[43:50.000 --> 43:56.000]  Everybody needs this. And there's a lot of other prepared in the specials that are going to end Tuesday or Wednesday as well.
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  Survival Shield X2, nascent iodine.
[44:00.000 --> 44:11.000]  We also have 20% off the vitamin mineral fusion, which is an absolute, again, liquid, multi-vitamin nutrient system.
[44:11.000 --> 44:15.000]  The amino acids, everything else you need for uptake. Totally essential.
[44:15.000 --> 44:24.000]  The bottom line, you could not be funding a more focused, dedicated, truthful, honorable organization.
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  We are so committed. And that's evident.
[44:28.000 --> 44:40.000]  And history is repeating itself out of your focus, truthful, steadfast, dedicated, humble, but bold at the same time that if you take action against evil over time, you will overcome it.
[44:40.000 --> 44:47.000]  So I need everybody to pray for us, spread the word, spread the links, spread the podcast, spread the stories, the videos, because you are the m4war.
[44:47.000 --> 44:57.000]  And I need you to go to m4warstore.com. And I need you to buy the products. I need you to be prepared, whether it's a shortwave radio or the film, American.
[44:57.000 --> 45:03.000]  Whatever you do, support the broadcast today. And I know you have been supporting us, especially in these hard economic times.
[45:03.000 --> 45:07.000]  I want to thank you. Please support our local affiliates, become a sponsor.
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.000]  Support the sponsors. Let them know why you're supporting. Send the station 20 bucks.
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.000]  Paint the station numbers on the side of your barn or the back of your car.
[45:15.000 --> 45:21.000]  Every little bit helps. We are in an information war. History is happening and we're so close to turn the tide.
[45:21.000 --> 45:31.000]  But I'm here to tell you, you can smell a false flag in the wind, an assassination attempt on Hillary, a successful one, perhaps carried out by the globalist to make her look like a victim and put the next Democrat in.
[45:31.000 --> 45:37.000]  They hope she just slide in there and then, you know, die a few years into office or they'd be able to stabilize her.
[45:37.000 --> 45:45.000]  They're so secretive, we're not sure, but it's clearly deteriorating quickly. So I look for false flags. I would look for anything.
[45:45.000 --> 45:57.000]  They're talking about suspending the election in major newspapers. They're meeting right now in DC and discussing what they're going to do.
[45:57.000 --> 46:03.000]  If it goes to the Electoral College, it will probably be Donald Trump that's put in.
[46:03.000 --> 46:08.000]  But we're not sure at this point because there's so many Republicans that may actually flip flop and go for Hillary.
[46:08.000 --> 46:14.000]  So if you look at it that way, it'd probably be Hillary or whoever else it is.
[46:14.000 --> 46:18.000]  And they're talking about putting Biden in or even Bernie Sanders over Kane.
[46:18.000 --> 46:23.000]  This is a nightmare scenario. This Republic has never been in greater peril.
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  So we can sit here and go, oh, look, we're proving right. Hillary's in big trouble. Hillary's sick.
[46:27.000 --> 46:34.000]  Look, boy, the independent media has been proven right again. They're not going to bring all this in and leave us alone.
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  They're taking the gloves off, folks. That means on your bank accounts.
[46:38.000 --> 46:43.000]  And don't just mean if you fight to do a lawyer. I mean, everybody bail ins, economic depression, total control.
[46:43.000 --> 46:52.000]  They want to bring this country to its knees and start a race war as the overall cover screen for this garbage.
[46:52.000 --> 47:00.000]  We have got to have cooler minds prevail. We've got to stand up like Martin Luther King said and say no to all this racial division.
[47:00.000 --> 47:04.000]  We have to come together against the new world order.
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  And if you're afraid, let me say something. You ought to be afraid of not taking action.
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  Now, let's get into what's currently happening.
[47:10.000 --> 47:13.000]  A candidate's death could delay or eliminate the presidential election.
[47:13.000 --> 47:20.000]  U.S. News & World Report, we covered this back on the 30th day of August, just 13, 14 days ago.
[47:20.000 --> 47:26.000]  The presidential election could be delayed or scrapped altogether if conspiracy theories became predictive.
[47:26.000 --> 47:33.000]  Oh, if conspiracy, having an opinion, which comes true, is now a bad thing.
[47:33.000 --> 47:37.000]  But, oh, but now it's almost seen as oracle level, you see.
[47:37.000 --> 47:42.000]  And when they don't mean some kook out there making up purple aliens in his basement, they mean us, folks.
[47:42.000 --> 47:46.000]  And a candidate dies or drops out before November 8th.
[47:46.000 --> 47:57.000]  The perhaps equally startling alternative is there's enough time, small groups of people handpicked a replacement pursuant to obscure party rules.
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.000]  And now the Republican Party gets its run again and getting rid of Trump.
[48:01.000 --> 48:07.000]  But he'll stand up and fight and have the people on his side. They won't get away with it like they did with Sanders.
[48:07.000 --> 48:14.000]  The scenarios have been seriously considered by a few outside of the legal community and likely are too morbid for polite discussion.
[48:14.000 --> 48:20.000]  You see, too morbid to live in the real world, even though political subterfuge and this garbage is part of world history.
[48:20.000 --> 48:26.000]  And those of us that are informed, we get called conspiracy theorists because we know about the electoral college and party rules.
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  We're bad, though. But even discussing this is too morbid.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  Are too morbid for polite discussion in politically mixed company?
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  Oh, yeah, you're not supposed to talk to each other. See, they've all trained us.
[48:38.000 --> 48:46.000]  But prominent law professors have pondered the effects and possible ways to address a late day vacancy.
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  There's nothing in the Constitution which requires a popular election for the electors serving in the electoral college.
[48:51.000 --> 48:56.000]  Oh, see, they're trying that party rule thing they made up.
[48:56.000 --> 49:04.000]  Said John Nagel, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, meaning the body that officially elects presidents could convene.
[49:04.000 --> 49:09.000]  It's only there in case of emergency of a death. See, now they're saying, oh, just ignore it.
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.000]  And it goes on to say, could convene without the general public voting.
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  Well, maybe permanently then just not have elections like the Communist Politburo or the Central Committee.
[49:19.000 --> 49:23.000]  See, oh, we just don't have voting anymore.
[49:23.000 --> 49:26.000]  We told you about that during the primaries, you understand?
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  That turn your guns in. We're loving.
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.000]  The conspiracy theorists said we were thinking about doing this. Now we admit we are.
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  That's why they're discredited because when you're right, you're discredited.
[49:36.000 --> 49:43.000]  When you predict the 2007 and 2008 housing crash two years before it happens on video with experts.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  It's in the film end game, but the interview was released 2006.
[49:46.000 --> 49:52.000]  You're a cook. See, when you're dead on with the sources and risk your life.
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.000]  When you get arrested in Canada covering it.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  When you're bold, you're bad.
[49:57.000 --> 50:01.000]  When you read off a teleprompter, you're good. You're a hero.
[50:01.000 --> 50:07.000]  It's up to each state legislator to decide how they want to choose the state's electors.
[50:07.000 --> 50:10.000]  Nagel says, and that'll be the Republican establishment.
[50:10.000 --> 50:17.000]  It may be a situation in which the fact that we have an electoral college rather than direct voting for presidential candidates may prove to be helpful.
[50:17.000 --> 50:22.000]  Ah, but major parties do have rules for presidential ticket replacements.
[50:22.000 --> 50:26.000]  However, in Congress has the power to change the election date under article two of the Constitution.
[50:26.000 --> 50:32.000]  Yeah, it's Congress because the founders believe the biggest body of people would have checks on each other.
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  The presidency supposed to be the weakest.
[50:35.000 --> 50:41.000]  Then the courts and then all above that is the Constitution of the Congress.
[50:41.000 --> 50:47.000]  Continuing, which allows federal lawmakers to set dates for the selection of presidential electors and when those electors will vote.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  So we'll read more of this when we come back.
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  Now, this is what I told you about two weeks ago.
[50:51.000 --> 51:00.000]  Now we have it all broken down. The Democrats openly saying they're scheming in DC right now to decide who they're going to appoint as your next president.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  Stay with us.
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  In a crisis, your number one need is food, but not just any food.
[51:05.000 --> 51:12.000]  Experts say everyone needs to have non-perishable, good for 25 years, survival food on hand in case of an emergency.
[51:12.000 --> 51:20.000]  Well, right now, in what is truly an unprecedented move, 72-hour survival food kits are being given away to listeners while supplies last.

[53:01.000 --> 53:05.000]  Dr. Water Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering how cells breathe.
[53:05.000 --> 53:08.000]  He also discovered how normal cells turn into tumor cells.
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  He discovered the one prime cause of cancer was cellular oxygen deficiency.
[53:12.000 --> 53:19.000]  Dr. Joanna Budwig built upon the work of Dr. Warburg and discovered how to feed the cells to overcome this oxygen deficiency.
[53:19.000 --> 53:27.000]  She found that it was a sulfur in the cottage cheese that would mix with fresh pressed flax oil that the flax oil would become emulsified and more readily absorbed.
[53:27.000 --> 53:32.000]  Flax oil delivered in this manner was able to restore oxygen transfer to all cells of the body.
[53:32.000 --> 53:38.000]  Now there's a new method of pressing seed oils that produces the highest quality, zero oxidation, undamaged seed oils.
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  The results on these seed oils alone are amazing.
[53:41.000 --> 53:47.000]  We add our life force enhanced one-world-way protein powder that is much higher in the sulfur amino acids than cottage cheese is,
[53:47.000 --> 53:52.000]  and you have a winning combination to confer health and energy like never before.

[54:23.000 --> 54:41.000]  The fact that she fell down yesterday and did not quote stumble, the fact that it's on record that she's trying to get Parkinson's medication,
[54:41.000 --> 54:47.000]  the fact that she was in the hospital for a year, and that the media is basically covering all of this up.
[54:47.000 --> 54:56.000]  Because if you look at it, it's clear. And now the Associated Press, the Washington Post, they've all turned against her as of just the last few hours.
[54:56.000 --> 55:03.000]  The stories are up on infowars.com. Hillary's Health, no longer conspiracy theory, says Associated Press.
[55:03.000 --> 55:07.000]  Well, maybe they'll announce that Australia was just discovered.
[55:07.000 --> 55:15.000]  It doesn't matter who really discovered Botany Bay. It doesn't matter that it was an English sailor.
[55:15.000 --> 55:20.000]  Let's just say Associated Press just discovered the planet Earth.
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  The AP has an...
[55:30.000 --> 55:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Associated Press that secretly decides the elections,
[55:37.000 --> 55:42.000]  that's now been federalized, that decided that Bernie lost California when he didn't.
[55:42.000 --> 55:47.000]  The AP, of course, because the meeting's been ongoing all this morning in D.C.
[55:47.000 --> 55:52.000]  And the word's going back, okay, we can't cover it up anymore. What are we gonna do?
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  We need to tell Hillary to step down.
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  So now they're spinning. How do we make it look like a victim? How do we make it look like a tax meter be sick?
[55:59.000 --> 56:05.000]  How do we make it? How do we spin this? Who do we put in? Who's best? How do we scam it at the state level?
[56:05.000 --> 56:12.000]  In the Electoral College, what do we do? Just trumps way ahead in all these internal polls and even the mainstream cheating polls.
[56:12.000 --> 56:17.000]  He's now five, ten points ahead. What do we do? What do we do?
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  And we're gonna find out now.
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  But the big signal, the Associated Press has come out.
[56:24.000 --> 56:29.000]  Hillary's Health, no longer conspiracy theory, says Associated Press.
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  You know, you don't exist when you're born until the AP walks into your mommy and your daddy
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.000]  and they say, what do you want to name your boy? Alexander M. Rick Jones.
[56:38.000 --> 56:43.000]  Seven pounds, six ounces. Born in Dallas, Texas. And they said, we're sorry you didn't exist.
[56:43.000 --> 56:48.000]  And then you just turned into smoke because AP is God.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  AP is history's actor like Carl Rowe called the New York Times and Washington Post.
[56:52.000 --> 57:01.000]  He said, I don't care what you report. Of course, there's no WM days. I lie. I control reality. You do whatever I say.
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  In fact, can we come into the next segment with the 2001 Space Odyssey? Thank you.
[57:05.000 --> 57:10.000]  Hillary's Health, no longer conspiracy theory, says the Associated Press.
[57:10.000 --> 57:17.000]  Well, G. Golly whizz bang. Even the pro-Hillary media now questions Hillary's health.
[57:17.000 --> 57:22.000]  But they say, why did she lie to us when she had a pneumonia?
[57:22.000 --> 57:26.000]  I never got to the clips. I'll play them next hour from MSNBC and others where they're just like,
[57:26.000 --> 57:33.000]  she's the healthier than most people in the press team. She's got so much energy. G. Golly, she's like a Clydesdale horse.
[57:33.000 --> 57:38.000]  That lady's amazing. I don't know how she does it. Why, she's going to be the new UFC women's champion.
[57:38.000 --> 57:42.000]  Maybe even the men's champion. Yeah. I mean, she is amazing.
[57:42.000 --> 57:47.000]  And I tell you, Donald Trump is the one he's got. He's covered something up.
[57:47.000 --> 57:52.000]  I have a clip actually where Mitchell actually says that. She says, the other stuff with sarcasm.
[57:52.000 --> 57:58.000]  Trump is covering something up. Okay. Hillary is the pitcher of health.
[57:58.000 --> 58:09.000]  But then meanwhile, behind this innocent looking bookstore, could Clinton be suspended if Hillary drops out?
[58:09.000 --> 58:14.000]  Electoral College could choose the next president.
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.000]  If the top Democrats push the presidential election to be suspended if Hillary Clinton drops out,
[58:18.000 --> 58:23.000]  they're ill health. They're already doing it. As info was reported a month ago, Secret Service sources told us that
[58:23.000 --> 58:30.000]  directly Hillary's campaign will be forced into making a big announcement soon regarding her medical condition.
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.000]  We really ought to get the clips too. When Biggs came on, we broke all this down a month ago.
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.000]  There's so much more. We haven't even scratched the tip of the iceberg.
[58:38.000 --> 58:44.000]  So everybody you know, tune in right now. This is world changing news. This is info war.
[58:44.000 --> 58:49.000]  We've got to get out ahead of this. We have, by the way, we're kicking our ass.
[58:49.000 --> 59:18.000]  And pass the ammunition.
[59:19.000 --> 59:34.000]  We've got to get out ahead of this.
[59:34.000 --> 59:50.000]  Just go to infowarsteam.com today. Complete a short sign up and you're part of the team. That's infowarsteam.com or infowarshealth.com.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:37.000]  From the infowars.com news studios. I'm your host Alex Jones, Joe Biggs, Leanne McAdoo.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  Yes, I've been containing a Cheshire cat grin all day long.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  My dad, we were out at the lake with the kids when this news came in. Leanne was texting me, so was Biggs.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  I went and saw the video and I went, yeah, yeah. I was just like, just literally just an ecstasy.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  And my dad said, that is horrible celebrating over that sick woman, even though I hate her too.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  And I went, no, this is a devastating victory against the enemy and more of the avalanche of them being discredited and the hand of God is upon this.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  And it's only going to get better the more good people take action. That's why evil always fears us and does everything they can to try to contain us throughout history and suppress us because they're scared of us.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  Look at these hunchback demons. They're nothing. Swip them aside once we whip people up. It's not like we're offering some utopia like they do,
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  but we're offering good old common sense prosperity. Can people handle it? Leanne McAdoo, Joe Biggs, Joe's Secret Service.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  We told everybody a month ago exactly what's happening. It's all come out exactly as we said. Leanne, where is this going?
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  Well, I got to say, at first, like you, I was overcome with excitement and joy when I first saw it because, you know, it was almost like she was overcome with all the energy of those spirits of the people there.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  And she works with Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  And she couldn't. Yeah, it was like struck down.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  Yeah, it was karma.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  Send back your, send back the campaign contributions from Saudi Arabia. Now that we have the 28 pages, you know, she was like overcome.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  It was like the spirits were there. So I was really rejoicing, but then I kind of felt sorry for her after I saw her.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  She was really weak and pathetic.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  Well, it shows how pathetic evil is.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  I don't think I ever felt sorry once yesterday. Yesterday brought an entire new meaning to Sunday Funday.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  Yeah.
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  It was Patriots football day.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  I'm going to be honest. It was like one long, you know what?
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  It was 9-11 anniversary. It was anniversary of Benghazi and Hillary Clinton collapsed so fast and there's so many things.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  I didn't think of that. That seems epic. It's biblical.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  It's karma. It is the ultimate thing.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  And the Patriots one, my buddy is with Donald Trump right now in Baltimore and he's actually talking to Tom Brady about stick Hillary right now from what my buddy saw me right now.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  So there's a definitely a conversation going on about it.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Yesterday was the most epic day ever.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  I cannot stop grinning.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  I broke out the beer.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  I got chicken wings. I got a pizza.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  Watch football.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  We're celebrating. I'm getting the crew chicken right now.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  I was on my laptop all day looking into this stuff.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  You know, watching all this.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  You know, that's it. I only got chicken for this crew.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  I want chicken for the whole office. Fried chicken for everybody.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  We don't get the MSG chicken. We get the good, you know, organic.
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  Lucy.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  I don't know if we're getting it.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  I'm just joking.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  Anyways, very, very excited.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  But think about this. That's right. Celery.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  Yesterday was an interesting day. The way the whole story progressed.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  It started off as she had like heat exhaustion.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  It was 76 degrees outside.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  Right.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  So if she becomes president, who's going to be president when it gets hotter than 76 degrees outside?
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  Right.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  She's the ice queen.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  Then the story switched to she's had pneumonia since Friday.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  Now I've had pneumonia before.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  Pneumonia is contagious.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]  She's hugging the little girl.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  Yes, she's hugging this girl. Now this girl's probably going to get sick.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]  Show that.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  That can't fight pneumonia. What if this girl ends up dying?
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  I mean, how staged is it?
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  Oh, the little girl walks out. No one can talk to me.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  The little girl runs over.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  It's like Kim's young un-propaganda in North Korea.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  Yeah. The Secret Service would never have allowed
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000]  just some random little girl to run up.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  It was totally staged.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  And if she does have pneumonia, so this is before they came out.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]  What she does in pneumonia.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]  Why'd she come out and say, oh, I'm perfectly fine.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  I'm feeling great.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  And look at those blue lens glasses. Those are the Zeiss Z1 blue lens.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000]  Those are anti-seizure glasses
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000]  you can buy online to wear to style.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  She's got a guy that walks behind her
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  with a freaking needle.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  I mean, they're like, hey, conspiracy theorists.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000]  Like Rachel Maddow last Thursday.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  Oh, she's falling down. Is she out?
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  Yeah, exactly. Oh, my gosh.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  Well, and it's like, look at her entourage,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  the people she's traveling with.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  Her main guy is also her antler slash doctor.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  We said there was a nurse.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]  We said there was a nurse.
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  It's creepy. Would you let your child get near her?
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  No. It's the same thing with a pope
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  and that little kid got past everybody
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  and got all the way up to him.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  Let's come back, Leigh Ann, get into stuff
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  because we're cutting over here, but we're excited.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  And then I want you to get into Secret Service.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  We're proving right again.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000]  And what's the next shoe to drop?
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  Because they're meeting in D.C.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000]  the Democrats are to decide who to appoint president.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  So, hey, we're not out of the woods yet.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000]  The Democratic National Committee
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  set to hold an emergency meeting during which
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000]  it will consider replacing Hillary Clinton
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  as a presidential candidate after her collapse
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  in New York during the September 11th Memorial.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  Democratic Party operatives will stage a crisis summit
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  to decide what to do given Hillary's health problems
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]  in the apparent effort by her campaign to cover them up,
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  according to the Emmy Award-winning broadcaster David Shuster.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  A DNC insider told Shuster
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  that the combination of her campaign
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  hiding Hillary's pneumonia for the past three days
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]  from the media and the shocking footage
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  of her fall in New York City represented, quote,
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  unchartered political territory.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  And another insider said powerful donors
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]  are now preparing for the worst if Hillary has to drop out of the race.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]  The mainstream media is upset that Hillary hit the pneumonia,
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  but of course that's not the only health issue
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  she's been hiding, as info wars
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  exhaustively documented over the past several months.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000]  A Clinton ally even told Politico, quote,
[01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000]  the Clintons have this notion
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  that they only need to go as far as they need to
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  in terms of disclosure, but they can't afford
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  to approach this that way.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000]  And to find out more, visit infowars.com
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000]  and the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:20.000]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  On the web at infowarsteam.com,
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  that's infowarsteam.com.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  And on the web at infowarsteam.com,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:08:00.000]  that's infowarsteam.com.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  All right, listen.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  I'm not celebrating that Hillary Clinton
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  collapsed and clearly has
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  serious neurological disorders.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  I am celebrating, though,
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  on the anniversary of Benghazi
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]  and her ordering to stand down
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  and four great Americans dying
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  and a lot of other innocent people
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  and their arrogance saying what difference does it make
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  on the 50th anniversary of 9-11
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  when Clinton is on record, even the Washington Post,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  protecting Al Qaeda and bin Laden
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  before 9-11,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  and I'm going to read Colonel Schaefer
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  who said it was Clinton that gave the orders.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  I'm going to let them kill him the first time.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  Now, it was the Pentagon the second time,
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  the CIA, that ordered him not to kill bin Laden
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  as well in early 2001.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  So you look at all the things she's done,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  how she is the founder of modern ISIL.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  That's on record.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  And the fact that this happened to her on 9-11
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  is incredible because we know
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  the Secret Service told us
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  a month and a half ago in Cleveland
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  that the next few weeks
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  we get info, we got the info.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  They had to do it, again, by person, not digital.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  And they didn't really give a secret stuff.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  They said, we don't know what it is.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  She's collapsing more and more.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  She's falling down. It's epileptic.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  We think it's Parkinson's.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  We don't know how she can continue.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  That's why she's not out in public a lot.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  10, 15 minutes. It's getting really, really bad.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  But look at her vehicles, the lifts, all of it.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  Now we have mainstream photos of her
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  with these lifts on the car.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  She's falling down just like they said.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  She has a seizure.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Joe Biggs, Liam McAdoon.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  It was interesting yesterday.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  My phone was blowing up.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  People concerned.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  People pretty excited about the entire thing.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  My buddy, his name's Jordan,
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  he goes, you know, I'm not a religious person.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  He's like, but when you sit back
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  and you look at the fact that this happened
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  on the anniversary of 9-11,
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  Ben Ghazi, she collapses right there.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  Proving everything you guys have been saying
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  for months now, he's like, I believe in God now.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  I mean, when people
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  start having these experiences
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  and when you fight the new employers,
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  they're just happening all the time.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  And then you're like, whoa, this is crazy.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  I don't want to go on the wrong side of this.
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  Well, and it's really interesting how they always kind of stage
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  certain things on auspicious dates
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  and then to have this happen on that auspicious date.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  So I think it's kind of like a message to them.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  Like, you're not above the laws of this universe.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  Well, people are making fun of us
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  for the longest time saying that
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  there's no upgraded vehicles.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  And like this blacked-out ambulance-looking thing
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  that has little stairs on it to help it out.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  Well, the ambulance following her.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  Last week in Ohio.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  They're secret service guys with a stretcher
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  following her in her events.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  I mean, she's clearly sick.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  We've been saying it since day one.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  Well, and you can also tell by just the way
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  that the Secret Service, how they all kind of gathered around,
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  they were all ready. They knew it was going to happen.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  Not like it was some random thing.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  Well, as there's the black guy that's always there with the epi-pin.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  Right. Right before that happened,
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  the guy that was following her, walking her
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  as they were going to that bandage, she had to leave.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  And they were doing like typical neurological tests
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]  where as she was walking, she was having her pulse checked
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  and having her-
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  They're holding her arm. They're holding her arm.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  Squeezed the doctor's hand to try to do that.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  And then you have to look at the glasses she's wearing.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  Like I said, these are Zeiss Z1 blue lens glasses.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  They're anti-seizure glass.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  They admit they are.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  And what we got, the information we got
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  from my Secret Service contact
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  was in fact that she couldn't be around
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  flashes because of that.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  She was going to be out in public.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  This is a 9-11 memorial. There's tons of people out
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  flashing cameras, all that.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  That's why she had to wear those glasses.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  And that's why when she does speak to the press,
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  it's her little press corps that follows her around
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  on the airplane.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  It's little small groups of these hand-picked women.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  Yes, and they know if they challenge anything,
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  if they question Hillary about her health,
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  they will be kicked off and not allowed to follow her.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  And they can't roll oranges at her.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  Leigh Ann, you're the one that first brought up,
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  these kinds of scenes. This is spiritual. This is biblical.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  Right. That was my very first instinct
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  when I saw that. I mean, obviously,
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  we've been talking about Hillary's health,
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  and that was just confirmation of it.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  But the very first thing that was my first tweet
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  was like, you cannot escape the spirit realm.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  You just can't. And it's just
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  auspicious that this happened.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  And that was what I felt like. She was just overcome.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  It's kind of a beautiful thing to see
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  because I feel like it really is a message
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  to these evil people who are
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  think that they are going to get away
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  with this madness and murder forever. You're not.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  Leigh Ann, let me ask you this, and then Joe,
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  we wrote about this when
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  I suddenly saw AP Reuters,
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  US News & World Report, USA Today.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  I mean, it was clearly two weeks ago, a push to go,
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  okay, maybe conspiracy theorists are right.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  What if one of the candidates dies like Hillary?
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  We're just going to have to appoint the president.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  Or, I mean, it's crazy.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  We've written articles about it today.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  Mainstream news admits
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  that Democrats are meeting right now
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  and deciding what type of scam
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  they want to pull with the mainstream media
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  to try to steal this from Trump because now he's ahead
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  even in their skewed polls.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  Well, it's very interesting. People are saying,
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  well, what about Bernie Sanders now?
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  So many people wanted him.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  But, I mean, they picked the wrong candidate.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  And it's like, she's so...
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  How dark must your heart be
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  if you continue on
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  and forge ahead with this presidency
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  knowing that you have some sort of
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  illness that is going to stop
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  you from being able to do your job?
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  Power hunger.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  I honestly think that she's so hungry
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  to become the first female president in America.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  She's willing to die trying.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  That's just how corrupt she is.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  And they're all going to go to jail if they don't.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  The only way for them to get out of it
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  is to become president, they think.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  I think she just wants to get there.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  I think she knows that she can do an entire
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  full four years.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  They're going to try to bring someone in later.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  That's why they've got this walking cane,
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  which is kind of funny because she's so ill
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  that she's going to be able to last the entire time.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  They're going to bring someone else in eventually.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  And that's why this meeting's happened.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  It's definitely unfolding.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  It's finally happening.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  My favorite headline on Drudge right now
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  is Matt Drudge and the alt-right vindicated
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  after Hillary collapsed.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  I believe that was the entire headline.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  We've been out here every day.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  People on the news, alt-right media, people that use Twitter,
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  Periscope, all that.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  Pointing out, watching all of her videos,
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  finding the fact that we found the ear buttoner ear.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  It's very clear.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  It's the public that's the power.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  Info wars and Drudge and others are just
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  linking to it and absolutely.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  She and her entourage left the press pool
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  that was with her.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]  We have the video of that too in photos.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  She's clearly in trouble there with them grabbing her by the arm.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  Right, exactly.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  She left the press behind, didn't tell them where it was.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  Unexpectedly. Hold them, stay there.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  Yes, it was someone there on the street.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  And Chelsea's house, so there wouldn't be any witnesses
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  at a hospital.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  They didn't allow the press to follow her, go with her.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000]  But it was a person on the street
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  who was able to get this footage.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]  So it's like you have nowhere to hide.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  And then I think it's hilarious now that the MSNBC
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  who's Andrew Mitchell coming out and saying,
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  you know, well we've been trying to fact check
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  all these conspiracy theories and you lied.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]  Why don't you just tell us about the pneumonia
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  and now that's the official story.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  Pneumonia.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  They fall back, oh we caught her in a lie, you have pneumonia.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  You don't cough for years with pneumonia.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  You die if you have it for just a few months.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  And the guy that owns the pharma companies,
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  what's his name, Martin Shkreli,
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  he actually approached Hillary yesterday
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  and asked her why she's so sick.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  Well, I started following his Twitter account last night.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  He said there were red laser beams
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000]  coming through and he did a periscope video
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  we got to find it later where he thought
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  that this was going to be his last time.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  He's like, I think I poked a bear
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  and now I'm being played.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Wait a minute, he went home and they were shooting laser beams.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  He said there was a laser, red laser coming through the window.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]  He was standing outside of Chelsea's apartment.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  He was in front of them about it but when he went home
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  he said there was a laser coming through the window
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  so he did a periscope video.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  He's scared, he even started tweeting to Snowden like
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  can you help me please, can you help me?
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000]  I mean, there's, the Clintons are people
[01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000]  you don't screw around with.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]  I mean, I had him one time, four guys call me on the studio line
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]  and they said we're going to kill you
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  for talking about the Clintons.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000]  I'm like, oh yeah, screw you, I go outside, they're there.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000]  They start attacking me going shut up about the Clintons.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  Then two weeks later they call me in, they go
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]  quit talking about the Clintons to my boss in the radio.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  They fired me. Wow.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]  I mean, these people don't play games.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  Yeah, and that's the thing is like the whole establishment
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  has been propping this woman up.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000]  They've got to get her in, even if she's only in there for a year
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]  to go ahead and sign all those executive orders
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]  and get everything done for this globalist agenda.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000]  She's their gal.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  You know, it's not just about her and she's so evil
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]  and she's going to be the first woman president.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  She is the establishment's candidate
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000]  and they've got to get her in.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  I totally agree with you.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000]  I want you guys to ride shotgun with me with Pastor Manning.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  Go ahead and skip this network break, last one of the day
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  that we're going to skip and I want to get Manning on
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000]  but during the skipping of the break,
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  I want to air a video that you guys just mentioned
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]  that's up on infowars.com.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000]  I want to be very clear with viewers and listeners.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000]  This is an information war.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.000]  History, if you study other nations, other empires,
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000]  they go through this upheaval, this type of subterfuge happens.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000]  This is normal.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000]  Those of us that study normal history,
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  that interview intelligence operatives,
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000]  high-level spy chiefs, high-level generals,
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.000]  the former heads of major departments,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000]  I've interviewed them all.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000]  You get an understanding of how things really work
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000]  and the public are like babies that have no idea
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  they're coming out of the cave in Plato's allegory
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  and learning the truth.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000]  They want to sit there all day and say conspiracy theory,
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]  conspiracy theory, conspiracy theory,
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000]  when that's all they've got.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  There are crazy conspiracy theorists that say the world's flat
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  and the Easter Bunny's real
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000]  and Obamacare's free.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  That's the mainstream media lying to you.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000]  We don't say Santa Claus is real.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  We can look at someone who's seriously ill
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000]  and was in the hospital for a year
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000]  and looks like hell when she came out
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.000]  and now has clear problems.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000]  But when you look at the things that Mitchell said on MSNBC,
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000]  she said, quote,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000]  Trump is worse than Hillary.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000]  That's what they're saying.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000]  He's worse about covering up his medical records.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000]  No. He says, I'll release my records when she does.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000]  He says, when she releases all of her
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000]  secret foundation documents
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  that are totally secret in Canada
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000]  and in Europe and places,
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  I'll release my damn tax returns.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  It's not fair where only he has to release stuff
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000]  and she doesn't.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000]  Well, of course, she's going to keep her tax returns.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000]  She's been in the public eye in politics for a long time.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  She knows how to keep her tax returns clean,
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  but it's her foundation
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  that you need to see the tax returns for that
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000]  and they've already admitted they've had to go through it.
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000]  It's all fake. It's totally criminal.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  Look at Glamour magazine and Salon
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000]  coming out and saying it's
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  sexist to question Hillary Clinton's health.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  They're trying to set the tone, the narrative
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  for these young millennials who are going to grow up
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000]  and go, oh my God, you can't ask about this person's health.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000]  That's the sexist.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  And by the way, no, that's not bad.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]  If someone looks sick, you should bring it up.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]  They need to get help.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  Rob Douche should be done with this in the next 10 minutes.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  He's got a compilation of a lot of her health crises,
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  a lot of her health problems.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000]  I think we forgot to put the one in there where she falls.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000]  There are so many of these.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000]  We're going to be playing that coming up
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  in about 15 minutes when Pastor Manning is with us.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000]  He's in New York.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]  I want to get his take.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  What folks are saying on the ground.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  Get his perspective of ride shotgun with me, guys,
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  for the rest of the hour.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000]  Infowars.com is the tip of the spear in the fight.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]  We are running a special
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  until Wednesday,

[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  absolutely key.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  We've got the new Biotruce Selenium M that's such
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]  a game changer.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  We've got Et Coss, Hilary for present shirts,
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000]  with shipping included, 9.95
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  or Payed in 1995, you have that option
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]  to actually make some money to fund this operation.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]  But whatever you do, pray for us, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  we need your support
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:03.120]  Com is the umbrella site in four worse life.com is the supplements were called triple eight two five three three one three nine
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.720]  Joe begs. I had a Owen shroyer
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:10.760]  He was over at my apartment yesterday when we were we had the Sunday feed-up and we were watching and I'm telling you that Mr.
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:13.120]  Maddowell special is is amazing
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.760]  I was like, you know what I'm about to go online right now and buy that to contribute to the cause
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:22.760]  He's like this is well. We need the funding. We need the prayers more than anything. Let me tell you this is dangerous
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:26.200]  Now I'll talk about David versus Goliath. He called for it a few years ago
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:29.680]  And no one thought it would happen to get a sharpened off of MSNBC
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:33.960]  It happened one month after he started it pastor Manning will be joining us after this quick clip
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.460]  I'm gonna play of MSNBC in
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:41.400]  Conniption fits trying to cover up yesterday that Hillary had a seizure and
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:46.160]  Collapsed and we have it from the Secret Service. She has seizures and collapses
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:49.600]  They would be we told you we told you about the lifts. We told you about the gurney
[01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:53.800]  It's all out in the news. I mean, we were there in Cleveland. This is what the Secret Service
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:56.200]  We're gonna give you information like what the hell guys in suits
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:02.080]  They said we'll get it you a couple weeks it came to us and then they said there's gonna be a big big shake-up big announcement
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:05.760]  Mm-hmm because they said they can't go on too much longer, which makes me think it may be planned
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:10.320]  Who are they gonna bring in because you know, we're kind of excited here seeing this evil one fall
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:15.780]  Well, the pastor tell us is this biblical is this providence on the day of 9-11 Benghazi in 9-11
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:22.380]  But this person behind Al Qaeda and ISIS protecting him in the 90s protecting them now working with Saudi Arabia has now been stricken
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:28.460]  I don't celebrate her being hurt individually, but to see evil fall like Herod is is is is it like you said
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:32.740]  Yeah, friends don't believe in God now they do you're seeing it happen the prayers are happening
[01:21:32.740 --> 01:21:38.060]  But before we go there here is a clip of the Conniption fits in the media because now they're back and off admitting
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:42.540]  There were lies. Mm-hmm. It didn't work the sale didn't work because they're getting ready to dump Hillary folks
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.540]  Let's go to this clip and then to pastor Manning
[01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:50.060]  Of course the big story today has been the fact that Secretary Clinton left rather
[01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:57.980]  Unceremoniously having become overheated. We should say the weather has been horrific very hot extremely humid temperatures
[01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:02.260]  She was adorned in a long-sleeved coat a pant suit
[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:07.420]  And so what we will see here now is her getting into the car
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:11.780]  She was a little bit unstable there and she was a little bit wobbly
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:15.860]  That's I think an appropriate word to use you could see right there again. She had become overheated
[01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:20.140]  I couldn't even wear what I'm wearing now to be appropriately addressed to anchor a broadcast
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:24.500]  I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt when I came in early this morning. It was that horrible that weather
[01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:31.780]  She has an unbelievably challenging taxing schedule that would be so physically for anybody right let alone somebody
[01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:36.620]  You know who's who's her age and frankly standing for a long period of time
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:43.100]  There is you know something that a fainting reflex that's called vasovacal syncope which is not uncommon for with that excessive heat
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:47.380]  If she didn't eat enough that morning or well enough that morning. It could happen to anybody
[01:22:47.380 --> 01:22:48.060]  Yeah, it's eating me
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:52.820]  I know there are plenty of days that I will drink coffee and a fair amount of it
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:58.740]  I might have in the early morning so you get going and then if you don't eat properly that can set you off
[01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:02.820]  This right here kids have been spinning up theories that she's not in fact in good health
[01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:06.740]  It is a rare occurrence that you and I discuss fashion when we're talking about
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:13.180]  Politics, but I'm looking at what you were wearing. You've got short sleeves on I can tell it's a light material
[01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:20.940]  That is in direct contrast to what it appears Secretary Clinton was wearing that blouse might even be a long-sleeved blouse
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:26.940]  We put into perspective this weather out there, and if that's what she's wearing. I mean that's just horribly uncomfortable
[01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:35.660]  That's a good point and you know it was the start of the day the Sun beating down so
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:40.980]  In charge other folks who were there at the 9-11 Memorial. They also say that it was pretty hot there as well
[01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:44.180]  She's in a dark suit, you know long-sleeved
[01:23:44.180 --> 01:23:48.380]  It's not the kind of thing that you want to be wearing any inappropriate attire
[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:55.580]  So absolutely appropriate for the event perhaps not so much though to combat the weather and the heat the secretary is wearing a
[01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:59.620]  Not only long-sleeved suit jacket, but it is dark color
[01:23:59.620 --> 01:24:05.460]  Of course, there are many of us who deal with the humidity of New York and up and down the East Coast and throughout the South
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:09.220]  And you know that lighter colors wearing lighter colors helps
[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:14.060]  Breathable cotton that sort of thing that she was wearing a long jacket
[01:24:14.060 --> 01:24:19.820]  We don't know the kind of material it was and I'm certain not wanting to disrupt really the solemnity of the
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:25.780]  I can't hear any more of this it goes on and on and we have a short clip
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:27.780]  We're going to pass her manning of Andrea Mitchell
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:33.820]  Coming out and basically saying Trump is worse about not releasing medical information than Hillary is
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:37.060]  So this is a total deception supposedly has pneumonia for years
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:40.660]  I guess it comes up and hugs this little girl when it's contagious
[01:24:40.660 --> 01:24:44.220]  I mean any way you slice it it's pure bull here is the Andrea Mitchell clip
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:49.660]  After telling us that the coffin Cleveland on Labor Day was just seasonal allergies
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:53.580]  Which is what she thought but after she had an exam on Friday morning
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:56.820]  They had an affirmative
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:03.340]  Obligation to tell us about the diagnosis of pneumonia and then the secrecy yesterday and for an hour and a half the press corps
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:10.300]  The protective press pool the pool of reporters, which is supposed to be with her just for this kind of emergency
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:16.420]  They are kept back at the ceremonies. They don't know that she is they're not told that she's gone to Chelsea's apartment
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:22.500]  Then they're brought there so that we can see her coming out looking very spry, you know hugging the little girl and then
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:25.620]  Eight hours after this first happened
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:32.860]  They finally tell us about the diagnosis of pneumonia that was that occurred on Friday. I'm sorry. There is an obligation
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:40.940]  Not written not in law, but there's an obligation and Donald Trump is even worse than she is in terms of telling us anything about his medical history
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:44.020]  So, you know, we've got a lot of problems
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:48.860]  I don't know. I want to give Pastor man the floor now, but talk about a witch always using children
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:54.820]  The Pope, you know does this too. This is so sick so staged so evil pastor Manning. You're a pastor
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:58.980]  You've talked about this great evil. We're facing this Jezebel spirit. We got a long segment coming up
[01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:00.380]  But the short one
[01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:06.340]  Everybody I talked to is on fire even people that Biggs knows that haven't been Christians from the military and stuff are saying
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:11.820]  I believe in God now that this happened on this anniversary. What is really happening here? You're up there in New York right now?
[01:26:11.820 --> 01:26:18.420]  Well, it's interesting to find out people are getting religion over the witch Hillary Clinton Jezebel
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:26.300]  Alex, let me give you a shout-out for using a referencing the allegory of the cage by Play-Doh
[01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:31.420]  Something I haven't heard anybody reference of myself since leaving college
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:36.740]  But listen, I think that we need to understand something that we are watching a setup
[01:26:36.740 --> 01:26:42.580]  I don't think the power is that be want to see an election take place and
[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:51.860]  We are watching perhaps the beginning stages of it or at least a culmination of the stages that began some time ago in
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:58.220]  Hillary perhaps not being able to meet the election requirements in terms of what will happen in November
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.740]  I think we also need to I believe she's sick
[01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:04.660]  In fact, I know that the woman is sick that she's she's just mentally
[01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:08.260]  Incapable and she's physically incapable as well
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:14.260]  But I think that in fact, I'm confident that the Trump campaign and and also Hillary's
[01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:19.300]  Inner circle and her internal polling is demonstrating
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:25.500]  unequivocally that Trump has won the election were at hell last week and
[01:27:26.220 --> 01:27:32.700]  Her statement about deplorables last week was as I think outrageous as her
[01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:41.460]  A sickness this past was yesterday at the 9-eleven event and what Hillary has realized and come to understand her polling people are telling her
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:46.380]  That Trump has won the election and even though there are some states according to CNN
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:50.860]  ROC Polarize amusing Quinnipiac and perhaps some others are stating that
[01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:55.260]  Trump does not have some of the battleground states to take him to victory
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:00.420]  but I think her polls are telling her that he does and we may see a
[01:28:00.420 --> 01:28:05.700]  A an attempt now with this sickness either to stave off the election
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:11.380]  Or we may see an attempt to try to bring sympathetic votes her way
[01:28:11.540 --> 01:28:17.140]  You'll remember when Obama was whipping her behind up there in New Hampshire back in 2008
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:21.740]  She sat down in that diner or restaurant or whatever it was and we had to weep like a little baby
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:25.100]  And she was able to come back from Obama beating her in Iowa
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:31.140]  So I think the ultimate that we can look at the two things that we can be certain about number one percent of thing
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:34.860]  And we know the Democrats are meeting right now in DC to figure out how to run a scam
[01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:39.780]  Yeah, and and and that the other thing is is will we see an election?
[01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:42.300]  I mean Alex you've written about in your last statement
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:49.140]  You made about the fact this could be a way to pause the election that we don't have a candidate to run
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:52.180]  We have a candidate's comma toll. So we you know
[01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:56.060]  I think you made a statement of several of your people your guests have also referenced that
[01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:01.140]  Ultimately, I think this is what we're looking at. I don't deny that the woman is sick
[01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:04.500]  But I think the sickness can be used by the powers that
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:08.740]  Oh, I agree. They won't let a good crisis go to waste. I mean, they're gonna pivot no matter how things change
[01:29:08.780 --> 01:29:13.780]  They're gonna go back in force when we come back Pastor Manning of OTTLA dot oRG of great church
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:15.780]  They're serving the community in Harlem at
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:22.220]  LAH dot org pastor James David Manning when we come back and we'll talk about those different scenarios with our panel here
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:24.700]  And I want to play the clip since you mentioned the deportables
[01:29:24.820 --> 01:29:31.620]  We'll get Donald Trump's latest response to that and a lot more and we have a compilation video over all of her different health
[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:37.260]  Problems straight ahead, but this is an incredible time to be alive and I agree with Manning
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:42.940]  It's good to see this the truth come out, but at the same time, they're gonna strike back
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:47.860]  They're going to pivot. They're going to make a move stay with us. We'll be right back
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:53.660]  I'm Alex Jones with Lee and Macadam, and of course Joe Bix. We're on the March the Empire's on the run
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:57.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:08.220]  Could top Democrats push for a suspension of the presidential election if Hillary Clinton drops out due to her health would Obama then attempt to stay in office
[01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:15.620]  Despite constitutional limits in August Secret Service sources told info wars that Hillary's campaign will be forced into making a big announcement
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:22.140]  Soon regarding her medical condition that announcement came September 11th when her campaign blamed pneumonia for her nasty fall
[01:30:22.140 --> 01:30:29.700]  Although this explanation is already under severe doubt given that the campaign initially lied by claiming Hillary had merely overheated before her collapse in New York
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:33.100]  Overheated the temperature was in the low to mid 70s Fahrenheit
[01:30:33.100 --> 01:30:39.820]  The Secret Service sources also told info wars that government vehicles that transport Hillary to campaign events had to be fitted with disabled
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:46.900]  Access due to her health now we see why in the video shot on September 11th showing Secret Service having to practically carry Hillary into a vehicle
[01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:53.940]  Paul Joseph Watson reported that top DNC strategists are now holding a crisis meeting to discuss whether replace Hillary with another candidate
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:59.580]  So will the establishment attempt to suspend the entire election to find out more visit info wars comm
[01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:04.300]  This is Kit Daniels reporting. Yeah, first of all, I want to say secret 12

[01:33:11.540 --> 01:33:19.340]  Well, Hillary collapsed in New York City. We're about to play a clip of Donald Trump talking about the deportables how half of
[01:33:19.700 --> 01:33:21.700]  Trump supporters are evil
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:23.860]  bad people bitter clingers
[01:33:24.980 --> 01:33:26.980]  But I agree with Manning. They're gonna try to
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:29.460]  Make a move on this Hillary is really sick
[01:33:29.460 --> 01:33:36.140]  But it is credits the mainstream media like never before that's why overall this is a big big victory
[01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:42.380]  Lee and McAdoo Joe Biggs in studio with us popping any time I'm going back to Manning to finish up his comment here
[01:33:42.380 --> 01:33:48.140]  But first here's Donald Trump on Hillary's statement about the deplorables. That's hurting her so bad in the polls
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:50.860]  Personally when I heard it
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:57.780]  I thought that it was not something that was within the realm of possible that she would have said it and I said to my people
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:03.140]  I don't believe she said it. I think that's a check it because there's no way that she said this and she actually did it
[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:08.860]  She even really doubled up because it was said with such anger and such unbelievable anger
[01:34:08.860 --> 01:34:13.060]  And I think this is the biggest mistake of the political season
[01:34:13.060 --> 01:34:19.020]  Remember this you're gonna be president. You're president of all the people you're not president of 50% or 75%
[01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:22.420]  You're president of all the people you're president of everybody
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:25.260]  Pastor Manning
[01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:28.740]  Overall, I mean you agree. It is a discrediting moment for the mainstream media
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:34.100]  But I agree with Trump completely on this is perhaps the worst statement throughout this campaign season
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:39.140]  And it was not only just an art in artful. It was a it was a deplorable statement
[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:43.740]  It was and I think Alex it was issued in panic
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:51.460]  I think as I stated earlier the internal polling is demonstrating that she has lost and I think the powers that be understand that
[01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:55.340]  And it was a statement made in panic. I think she is a little bit more
[01:34:55.340 --> 01:35:03.340]  Governed in that a little bit more circumspect rather than make as a statement such as that so she threw everything she possibly had
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:08.560]  But the other question Alex is that and you know trying to put it together the pieces
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:11.780]  I think we all have been able to demonstrate that she is sick
[01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:19.960]  And that they're trying to hide it. But the other thing is is that you know, it did what she pulled down
[01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:21.960]  Okay, let's say she made a statement
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:27.120]  realizing that the possibility here is very strong that she has lost the election and
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:34.640]  She makes this deplorable statement, which was awful to call Americans as she did. It's one thing to go out an individual group
[01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:39.040]  And and so the powers that be the new world order the globalist the others
[01:35:39.640 --> 01:35:41.680]  Said let's take her off. Let's take her down
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:49.080]  It's time for her to get off the stage and let's try to get somebody else or try to save all for stall the election
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:56.960]  So we can't be sure whether or not there the fact that she is sick that that sickness was used or whether
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:02.120]  She was just totally complete. I mean this question. I want you guys to chime in with your views
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:09.020]  Everything's getting so crazy. Everything. They do falls apart and we see it with foreign leaders in other countries. It seems like the world
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:13.960]  Is melting down and everything the new world order does is disintegrating
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:18.160]  But still they just have the power and move forward. What would you call that phenomenon?
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.720]  Pastor Manning
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:27.360]  The fact that they they have the powers, but there is a spirit of listen America is praying whether they have whether they're the
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:35.820]  We're saints or not is a matter of question, but spiritually America is looking at you know, I said today on the Manning report
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:41.160]  Alex that what Donald Trump does is that he makes America feel young again now
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:44.280]  I know his slogan is to make America great again. Okay, that's fine
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:48.400]  But really when you listen to him, it makes us feel young again
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:51.560]  It makes us feel like we want to pick up our guns and goes to wow our ways
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:59.240]  In a positive way. We want to start another revolution. I mean, he really makes just feel like let's get our guns and go to town
[01:36:59.240 --> 01:37:06.240]  I made the statement earlier today that America Trump makes America in a positive way feel like we're old by
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:10.080]  Trump told me he said my mission is to raise America's spirit
[01:37:10.080 --> 01:37:16.840]  I don't want to have a field day, but Trump told me that on the phone. He goes as a spirit of what I felt that RNC was incredible
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:20.800]  He goes, well, that's what I want to do is raise America's spirit and give us confidence again
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:22.920]  And he's doing it and he's got the time to do it right now
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:27.440]  Look at this 36 hours after or before Hillary made that deplorable statement
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:32.800]  That's when Obama came back from Asia and he had been bashing America on this entire tour
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:35.300]  It was nothing about another after another
[01:37:35.300 --> 01:37:41.260]  Don't forget Obama was calling SOB in Asia as well. Yeah, no, I mean, they don't forget that the Philippine
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:44.140]  Duterte called him that and they walked it back
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:48.380]  But yeah, I'm sorry if you interrupt me go right ahead. No, no, I mean you I mean you're taking on what's happening here, then
[01:37:48.380 --> 01:37:51.380]  But but that's what I'm saying is the fact that we've got Obama
[01:37:51.500 --> 01:37:55.740]  We've got Hillary attacking the American people Trump is the one positive person
[01:37:55.780 --> 01:38:00.300]  That's really lifting it up the fact that you've got so many people right now that have
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:05.220]  Awaken from this state of like comatose where they right, you know
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:07.980]  patriotism has died it seems like and so many aspects of
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:12.180]  America and this guy's coming in and he's he's igniting that again
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:13.500]  He's getting the people
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:20.460]  Emotional and proud to be an American and proud of all this talk about that right all this quiet diplomacy and you know
[01:38:20.460 --> 01:38:24.300]  The and then the uplifting of Islam me and yeah
[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:31.220]  We as Americans with with tired of being pushed around by by Muslims were tired of being pushed around by Mexicans
[01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:39.780]  We're tired of giving away the company's store to nations like China and India and giving away all kinds of nuclear deals to Iran and
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:45.740]  And saying it's diplomacy. It is the best way forward. We're a vigorous and aggressive people
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:50.740]  That's not in the spirit of America and what Trump is saying. We don't have to do this to how it all that
[01:38:50.740 --> 01:38:55.980]  We are going to stand our ground. If you don't like it, we'll kick your butt. Well, and people say
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:01.980]  That's what I want to do. I want to kick some butt again. I want to be I want to be American
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:08.220]  That's what's happening and there's no way what what Hillary is presenting can overcome that so what are they gonna do?
[01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:11.060]  I you know, how they gonna stop Trump trust me now
[01:39:11.060 --> 01:39:15.060]  I think the other thing needs to be clear and Alex, you know, I've said from the very beginning
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:18.980]  I just don't see Obama leaving office not now
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:23.880]  I mean, I will he gives a possibility. Yeah, they're even talking about a mainstream news
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:27.500]  Put the election off six months a year and I guess Obama does today, right?
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:31.900]  Everybody's always said that I didn't believe it
[01:39:31.980 --> 01:39:34.660]  We're actually have news talking about that now Liam
[01:39:35.180 --> 01:39:39.340]  Uncharted territory with this and and just going back to what Pastor Manning was saying
[01:39:39.340 --> 01:39:45.420]  I mean look at what the president has done to this country and it's not working because he's going to other nations
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:52.620]  And they're totally disrespecting him. They don't respect him for throwing away America selling America out to the highest bidder
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:59.080]  They don't respect him. And so I think it's true. Trump is coming in and they're certainly not gonna respect Hillary Clinton
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:02.600]  That's the right question Pastor Manning. I want to get both your take on this
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:08.980]  Why do you think people are disrespecting Obama so much when he grovels to him because he's groveling that's manning. Yeah
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:15.260]  Yeah, because he's shown I mean he drew a red line in the sand with Bashar Assad in Syria, right?
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:19.540]  And and Bashar crossed it before he could finish the park the mark itself
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:28.480]  He I think people are looking in anybody with half a brain can see that Obama has sold out the American ideal
[01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:33.900]  He has sold out the American people and worst of all, he's trampled on black people
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:37.560]  I mean in the worst possible way so people looking at this and
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:42.140]  Realizing it that what he's done to America is it listen this man is nobody
[01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:45.420]  He and we're so we can say what we want to say about him
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:48.500]  He hates America and no world leaders out there respect them
[01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:50.460]  You went over to the UK
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:54.740]  I should and he's trying to tell him how to vote for Brexit and I bit him right in the butt because no one out
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:57.580]  There has respect for him if you hate your own country
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:02.340]  How could any other country have any kind of respect in what you have to say as far as they're concerned?
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:04.340]  You're weak and they don't want you to be there, right?
[01:41:04.980 --> 01:41:06.340]  Pastor Manning
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:10.180]  Yeah, I mean I tried to counter it up, but I know you met with Trump over a year ago
[01:41:10.180 --> 01:41:14.900]  I know just in New York he met with a whole bunch of different black churches and black
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:21.180]  Preacher grips and I saw him at prayer practices and all me just he seemed like 20 30 times ABC News said
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:25.740]  Few weeks ago. Well, it's the first time he's been to a black church in Detroit
[01:41:26.020 --> 01:41:29.820]  Because you know, he's uncomfortable and all this stuff and I went and looked it up
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:32.500]  And it seemed like he'd been there 10 times more than Hillary
[01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:38.900]  What do you say to that their attempt to say he hasn't reached out to the black community when Obama doesn't say a word about that
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:41.340]  And it seems like Trump's really been reaching out. What's the truth?
[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:50.180]  I think that Trump's a state statement during the shortly after the convention. I get my timelines mixed up here
[01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:57.300]  What do you have to lose? You got 58% unemployment of your youth. You've got failing schools
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:02.020]  You've got poverty. What do you have to lose was an accurate statement by frankly?
[01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:06.220]  I was praying that he would not walk it back the media jumped all over him
[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:10.820]  Anything you say about African-American people. I mean, they jump all over you
[01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:14.660]  But he was absolutely right and he should go back to that statement
[01:42:14.660 --> 01:42:21.660]  What do you have to lose and that statement confronts the fact that the every city and every
[01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:29.460]  Parcel of American government and lifestyle that is run by the Democrats and primarily where black people are in charge is failing
[01:42:29.540 --> 01:42:33.900]  Alex I live in Harlem. I got to tell you it is horrible
[01:42:33.900 --> 01:42:38.580]  It's worse now than before dr. King in the civil rights movement more men in prison
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:45.300]  Few fathers 90% of the homes in the black community. Alex don't have fathers in them. This is this is a
[01:42:46.020 --> 01:42:51.380]  How do you make of Kaepernick and George Soros and then these football teams taking an eatery 9-11 regardless?
[01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:52.980]  We think about 9-11
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:57.820]  The firefighters and police and those that died don't deserve to be pissed on. I mean, what what is all that?
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:03.740]  Well, you know, somebody should kick a Kaepernick's butt. I don't what's it when he's sitting there. I think they should
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:07.100]  They should have got a good place kicker that knows how to put a real good kick
[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:11.820]  When he says down kick him right in the split. That's what I think what happened to him now
[01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:16.780]  Come arrest me for that. Somebody come arrest me for saying that. That's why you asked me what I think I'll tell you what I think
[01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:21.640]  What do you want me to do? Think about all the enemies we have right now that are looking at America watching the news
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:26.960]  Seeing America that the patriotism kind of collapsing the fact that you have all these people who are
[01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:29.160]  Taking a knee you're sitting down
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:34.960]  We've had we have schools that are banning the Pledge of Allegiance praying the fact that you can get you know
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:40.080]  Arrested for having an American flag on your property the fact that you can be told that you're being
[01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:47.760]  Anti-immigration because at a high school football game, you're waving American flag and that could be
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:54.200]  It's perfect. It's that the globalists are blaming us what they've done. Go ahead Alex listen
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:44:02.120]  Today, yes, there was 9-eleven right everybody down it to you know, World Trade Center and a great ceremony and they were and everything and of course
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:08.720]  9-eleven's another story, but guess what's happening in New York City today of the day after 9-eleven all
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:15.000]  Public schools in New York City are closed a 3.4 million children that go to school in New York
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:20.960]  Can I go to school because it's a Muslim holiday the mayor of the city of New York City Council state of government?
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:25.240]  They have orchestrated the day after 9-eleven. You probably think I'm making this up
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:32.600]  I'm swears the absolute truth the day after 9-eleven 9-12 is now a holiday called the L. Odd Haddad
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:39.360]  Spiritual holiday for Muslims banks of clothes businesses are closed parents can't take their children to school to food lunch
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:41.680]  Per school lunch programs are closed down
[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:48.080]  Businesses are losing money because we've now established a Muslim holiday 15 days 15 years after
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:55.040]  What is the plan making the West and they don't want your views will get past your mannings on making us adopt the most radical forms of Islam
[01:44:55.880 --> 01:44:57.880]  What's the plan to make us do it? I
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:00.880]  the thing of it is is that the
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:06.680]  Saudi Arabia has a lot of influence over our nation
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:11.560]  They have a lot of influence over the well, New World Order to have a lot of influence presently over
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.440]  Obama and they want to spread Islam as far as they possibly can and
[01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:23.040]  If they can then be if they can co-op this nation they can break the spirit of this nation
[01:45:23.040 --> 01:45:29.600]  They can take over financially as well. So it's simply a matter of ruling the kingdom of planet earth
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:35.200]  That's what it is. They want to rule planet earth and America is a major obstacle and I got to tell you
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:39.120]  That what Trump has done in stirring up the people who want to
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:46.480]  You know make make America young again is a threat and we could see some really very serious
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:48.480]  activities now happening
[01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:54.240]  They want America despite all its problems the threat to the globalist to go to sleep and never wake up, right?
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:57.320]  Yeah, and that's why I thought it was really interesting that they were trying to
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:03.920]  Bill Clinton was coming out saying that the make America great against Logan is racist and and really going to the black community saying
[01:46:03.920 --> 01:46:05.760]  Oh, well, he wants to take it back 50 years
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:10.680]  And then you you kind of go back and look at where the black community was. I mean their families were together
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:17.560]  They were on the rise in their class back. Yeah, I'm sorry. Go ahead. I'm going to pressure man. No
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:21.840]  I want to go back 50 years. The families were together's with strong schools
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:28.600]  There were fewer than a hundred thousand men in jail with that in prison where there's now more than 1.2 million
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.120]  The communities were flourishing with jobs and with decency
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:39.720]  With honor to Alex, you know, you got it. You got to live in Harlem a South Central awesome
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:43.560]  Listen, listen, he said does anybody need anything better than Chicago?
[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:50.200]  You've got nearly 5,000 people that have been killed in Chicago black men killing each other since Obama's presidency
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:54.480]  I mean, you think about how horrific that is that that's going on
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:47:00.960]  Nobody wants to live like that, but that's what so we could go back to a time where we were at that that crazy
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:05.320]  Well, here's the bottom line. I want to ask you all each because I want to have this roundtable today
[01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:07.880]  Starting with bigs and then laying in the past remaining
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:11.280]  What do you think they're cooking up of these secret DNC meetings?
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:16.000]  They admit politico are going on right now to decide of whether Hillary should step down. I
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:20.040]  Don't know like I said, I know that she's determined to do what she can
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:23.760]  She's going to fight through this illness to try to get that reach that historic moment
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:28.200]  And I in my opinion, I know she knows she can't last four years
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:33.920]  The question is is who are they going to usher in after that to take over and that's why my concern has been since day one
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:39.040]  Who is this cane guy? And what is it? Do they want with him? And then if they don't go with them?
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:42.520]  What other kind of people are they going to choose to bring in? Mm-hmm?
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:49.360]  Well, and I just want to point out too how the dehydration and overheating was the same excuse that was given in
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:53.720]  2012 when Hillary Clinton first fainted and got her concussion
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:56.760]  They said she fainted because she was dehydrated and overheated
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:48:01.800]  So obviously this is an ongoing medical condition that she is epilepsy
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:06.960]  Yeah, I mean it's not just this pneumonia that all of a sudden her staff has been having for several months
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:11.920]  Which the the the political the press pool has never heard of prior to this
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:16.520]  Well, you catch a pneumonia when you already have a weakened immune system exactly like when I had the flu
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:20.960]  I got pneumonia when I had the flu. You don't just go out and get it. I'm telling you that they're making a new
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:24.720]  She's got a number of things wrong with her. Do I believe that she could have pneumonia?
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:25.600]  Yeah, it's a possibility
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:31.280]  But that's cause that's that's due to the fact that she has been sick for a long period of time her immune system
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:33.280]  She's clearly having
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:36.320]  Seizures that you can see her have them and then fall out
[01:48:38.960 --> 01:48:42.920]  If if Hillary has white watch bleached bit
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:50.360]  15,000 emails and God only knows how many others that we will never know the content of or how they were served
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:57.480]  We have to ultimately began to ask the question how much information has been bleached bit
[01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:01.000]  about that Muslim Barak Hussein Obama and
[01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:03.680]  Whoever goes into the presidency
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:08.800]  will have the power either to preserve and protect the
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:15.960]  Integrity of the criminality of Obama's illegal election or will have the ability to open it up and
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:21.160]  Make it plain so everybody can see that our nation for eight years was under siege
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:25.760]  And so I whether or not Hillary it will be allowed to do that
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:30.760]  And if she's not allowed to do that if she's not given the privilege to be able to do that
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:33.640]  We were possibly when I have an election
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:40.900]  I think all of us know that it's a it's a horrific thing that Hillary what the emails what Hillary has done with emails in her private
[01:49:40.900 --> 01:49:41.680]  server
[01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:47.800]  But what the media has not discussed and is definitely afraid to discuss but is this obvious
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:53.720]  It's the elephant in the room is what has been covered up about Obama. I agree. So let me ask you this questions
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:57.120]  We got a break and then I'm gonna keep you guys a little bit in the next hour
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:01.200]  And then I've got a bunch of the news I'm the cover you have this compilation of our all our different illnesses video and audio

[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:06.360]  You'll see the Alex Schoen show as we go to break I asked a question earlier
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:09.280]  But I got caught you know in all the cost talk here of myself and others
[01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:13.680]  Why do you think all hell's breaking loose worldwide right now? Oh, yeah, that is a question
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:19.280]  if you're if you're focusing it on me again, it's because of the
[01:50:19.280 --> 01:50:25.760]  The spirituality of our nation because if our nation can finally be conquered
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:31.800]  If the spirit of our nation can be broken then there is no longer any further opposition China
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:32.320]  That's right
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.880]  The globalists get the world once America falls and as bad as we are though. There's still something about it
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:41.200]  They've got to take down. That's right. No, you're right. That's it. That's the answer for me. That's the answer
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:46.120]  I think that's the answer. All right. Well, I'm gonna come back and talk to pastor Manning. You guys are

[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:19.160]  Turns out the old guys in this unit have been part of a special test group for a doctor formulated fountain a youth drink called
[01:53:19.160 --> 01:53:23.840]  Patriot Power Greens Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:28.320]  That it's made their achy joints stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:32.540]  Previously this drink was only available to elite military units
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:38.840]  But for a limited time the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free sample packs
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:46.160]  Specifically for our conservative friends, but you must act fast do the high demand for members of the Coast Guard our supplies

[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:12.400]  I've got a bunch of clips a bunch of angles. I haven't covered of this
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:19.040]  And we will continue on and also open the phones up and take your phone calls into the fourth hour today that David Knight is hosting
[01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:23.040]  Quite frankly, this has gotten even above my pay grade
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:28.800]  I feel like I'm in way over my head, but so is everybody else these globalists that think they're invincible to think they're unstoppable
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:34.640]  They're being humbled right now and history shows that happens again and again. They're very smart. They're very deceptive
[01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:40.320]  They have the media on their side, but more and more that media is discredited. So I just have a feeling deep down
[01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:43.480]  Baster Manning of Otla
[01:54:43.480 --> 01:54:50.640]  Worldwide church based there in New York City in Harlem that overall their power is waning even as they build their world government
[01:54:50.640 --> 01:54:56.760]  But that they're gonna strike back in some really nasty ways other key points you'd like to add sir
[01:54:57.480 --> 01:54:59.480]  Couple things one Alex is that
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:03.720]  Since I've been coming on your your broadcast and thank you so very much. I mean you're quite generous
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:07.640]  I can never thank you enough. We have been getting members of people coming to our church
[01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:12.640]  I'll worship services and pretty large numbers. I heard you on Alex Jones. I come to see what's up
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:19.840]  So thank you so very much for that. But the other thing is is and we're talking about some really substantial people Alex
[01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:24.800]  I mean, yeah, I gotta have them on my broadcast and they were they come around in New York City
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:29.400]  But my I only have one tech here today. His wife has an appointment
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:36.640]  Sonogram. She's pregnant. He has to leave it to a clock. Lord knows I hate have to say this
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:39.360]  But I would have I don't have anybody to take me after he goes
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:43.040]  So I don't know if I'm gonna be able to stay past two o'clock
[01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:47.360]  Gotta leave the next five minutes. I've got my crew coming in but just just in closing
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:49.360]  What are other key points you'd like to make?
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:58.080]  Uh that the America will this God this this nation was established and founded on the word of God whether people want to
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:01.040]  Talk about the founding fathers being DS or whatever it is
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:04.240]  we know that God has blessed this nation and
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:07.560]  It will not go down in
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:13.680]  In ashes with the new world order who wants to take this this nation
[01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:19.600]  Away from God and away from the away from the people. So the bad. This is the battleground. It's not in Europe
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:25.200]  It's not in Asia the battleground of good and evil is here in America
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:33.040]  And while we may look like we are outnumbered by the globalist and by the financial wherewithal and power
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:40.160]  We are not and and and and that's why we see all of what's going on in terms of
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:42.160]  our
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:44.160]  Economy our political
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:50.480]  The if you will presentation globally, but America will stand. It's going to be a terrible battle
[01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:56.960]  We have to get ready also for a very very difficult time in october and in november
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:02.240]  If hillary is not going to be able to stand and be able to be the debate trump
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:05.600]  Or to be able to close the election and and be able to say she can run
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:09.040]  There's no way she can stand up for an hour or two and debate him. What's she gonna do?
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:14.720]  Well, it's so we what so what's the globalist? What are what are the democrats doing now? You said they're planning
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:18.480]  You're right. What are they planning on? What are the globalist planning on doing?
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:23.120]  And what are the people planning on doing? We need a strategy
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:26.480]  To combat what they're going to come back with it
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:34.000]  I I think basically what they want to do is is try to use martial law or e the states of emergencies in various states
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.560]  We know there's a gear up for it. We've likes of which we've never seen before
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:43.520]  Pastor Manning. Thank you so much looking forward to speaking to you in a few weeks again. Thank you, sir
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:47.760]  Alex, thank you for having me. Thank you for all these people that's coming down church now result might be on your broadcast

[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:00.240]  And I think you misunderstood. I think he thought I wanted him on the next hour of the cruise coming back in
[01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:02.240]  But he's got to go. I know he had to go now
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:03.840]  Um
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:07.600]  There's so much to cover here so much. I haven't hit I've got to really be careful here
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:11.840]  There's only got one more hour. I'm hosting and then David night's coming in and we've got this epic
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:16.720]  I use that word too much. This is epic times. I have this really important compelling
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:21.040]  Informative amazing six minute video that rob do put together
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:25.360]  It's powerful on radio even more powerful and video this being uploaded to youtube right now
[01:58:25.760 --> 01:58:28.080]  It'll be on info wars.com the next 15 20 minutes

[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:32.160]  Coming up
[01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:34.480]  Uh in the next hour in fact in about 10 minutes
[01:58:35.520 --> 01:58:37.280]  It just proves
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:43.040]  Hillary clinton is on her last leg. This has got to go viral stay with us for right now. They're meeting in dc

[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:57.040]  Brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it rob do joins us you worked
[01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:01.360]  I guess like 20 plus hours. Tell us what brain force get I've been working all day
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:05.600]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30
[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:08.960]  I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:10.960]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:15.200]  I got my bottle of brain force right there and pop two of them and about 20 minutes later
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:18.080]  It's like being everything just kind of clears up
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:23.040]  It's got four and a half stars people really love it read about it find out why third party

[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:34.720]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force
[01:59:34.800 --> 01:59:36.800]  I went home about 6 45 this morning
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:44.400]  I took three hours of sleep got up took two more brain force and came in you will find brain force and other game changing products

[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:56.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000]  For you can be great
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:18.480]  You must be young and free young apart before America can be great again. She must be free again
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:21.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.640]  You know pastor Manning says a lot of really interesting things that people make jokes out of on the internet
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:32.400]  I like to do about me. They take it out of context, but I always want to have him on
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.880]  Because he always two or three times says something really profound
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.080]  That I haven't or anybody else say
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:46.320]  And that's it. I have that liner that says you know before we can be great again. We must be free again
[02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:49.920]  But it's true Trump is young of heart
[02:00:51.360 --> 02:00:53.920]  And he's he's not perfect none of us are but he doesn't want to
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:56.720]  He's not out to get people
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:01:00.080]  He didn't want to make you poor so he can rule over he wants to make you wealthy
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.960]  He's into prosperity and trump
[02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:09.760]  Trump wants to raise America's confidence in our spirit. We've been beaten. We've been divided. We've been attacked. It's it's been
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:14.720]  The globalists are out to get this country and we've been used for great evil. We've done bad things
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:17.360]  But you can pair it to other countries
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:20.320]  America has changed the world for
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:22.880]  A lot of people in a lot of good ways
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:30.720]  The good parts of America. There's a spirit. There's something there the renaissance the enlightenment to the true expression of the best of christianity
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:33.760]  And the system wants to shut it down
[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:41.360]  You go back 200 years ago, you know the british empire and others said we can't allow this american system to flourish
[02:01:42.240 --> 02:01:44.400]  Because it's free market. It's independent
[02:01:45.120 --> 02:01:50.960]  It'll end our monopolies and the british were more free market than the rest of europe. That's why they were beating europe
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:53.840]  But they couldn't compete with something even better
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:01:56.400]  didn't mean we were perfect but the idea
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:01.280]  Of creating more wealth humans getting smarter humans living longer
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:05.680]  Prosperity the average person having the answers the average person
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:12.960]  Like admiral nimitz from just an average family in fredericksburg, texas the landlock becoming the head of the us specific fleet
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:17.360]  I mean back then folks they were not looking for people that were from the big family
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:24.640]  Like that was really looked down upon it was looking for who was the best who did do the best in combat in the test and who took the most action
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:30.480]  In europe other places, it's not like that in japan, and they're really smart folks when i put them down
[02:02:30.720 --> 02:02:32.720]  It is about what family you're born into
[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:36.400]  You go back and say well, that's because a thousand years ago. They were the best whatever
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:43.520]  It causes this corruption and there is a real attack on prosperity a real attack on small business
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:46.160]  That's what dr. C pacenek always talks about. I know I said
[02:02:46.720 --> 02:02:49.120]  Get the other crew back in here and they'll come back in at the bottom of the hour
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:50.640]  I hadn't looked at the schedule that was up
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:55.600]  And I was trying to get pacenek on the day. We were able to turn him to pop in for one segment
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:59.680]  He was on a month ago and said clearly she has neurological problems
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:06.320]  Clearly she was in the hospital for a year. She's an independent panel to come in and look at her and now even bernstein of the
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:08.800]  washington post
[02:03:09.680 --> 02:03:12.000]  Has of bob edwards and of course bernstein
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:16.880]  Fame have come out and said she needs to do an hour talk in front of everybody with her doctor
[02:03:16.880 --> 02:03:20.400]  We need to see this woman more than 10 minutes. What in the hell is going on?
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:27.200]  This is an obvious cover-up and I just cannot believe this system bet everything on this
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.400]  Like she was invincible
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:35.440]  The bottom of the hour I'll air this amazing six minute report that rob does put together
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:39.520]  I don't know what you call this. I mean total proof that hillary's health is gone
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:45.040]  Uh, or the history of hill hillary's health problems, uh, a special report
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:47.040]  or the
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:49.440]  hillary's, you know
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:51.680]  hillary's public health records released
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:58.000]  I mean because these are public health records not hillary's health records released hillary's public health records released
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:04.080]  You probably just described that in the description, but I mean her public health record is there to see
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:09.760]  Since whatever happened in 2012 the word is brain surgery the word is brain tumor
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:15.360]  The word is bleeding and they're sinus into her brain. Most people don't survive a stroke like that
[02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:18.800]  They admit that went on
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:24.320]  And she's all these weird drugs and it doesn't make sense. So we'll have a focus interview with dr. Steve Pacenek who is a
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:26.960]  uh board certifying
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:29.120]  psychiatrist
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:31.120]  and of course overseeing whole medical facilities and
[02:04:31.680 --> 02:04:38.320]  Has a degree in understanding the neurology and the physicality of brain problems and mental illness because listen
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:40.320]  I'm not a jet pilot
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:46.480]  And I didn't go to the moon, but I can look at hillary clinton tell you that lady's got one foot in the grave
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:53.360]  She's dragging the other one into the grave with her right now. So what does that signify for cog as well?
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:05:00.240]  What does that signify for the future of this republic with these emergency meetings being held? This is incredible
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:06.560]  The democratic national committee is set to hold an emergency meeting during which it will consider replacing hillary clinton as a
[02:05:06.560 --> 02:05:10.480]  Presidential candidate after her collapse in new york during the september 11th memorial
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:15.920]  The democratic party operatives will stage a crisis summit during which they will decide what to do given hillary's health problems
[02:05:16.080 --> 02:05:20.880]  And the apparent effort by her campaign to cover them up according to emmy award-winning broadcaster david schuster
[02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:26.720]  A dnc insider told schuster that the combination of her campaign hiding hillary's pneumonia for the past three days from the media
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:31.600]  And the shocking footage of her fall in new york city represented quote unchartered political territory
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:36.320]  And another insider said powerful donors are now preparing for the worst if hillary has to drop out of the race
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:38.880]  The mainstream media is upset that hillary hid the pneumonia
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:42.560]  But of course that's not the only health issue she's been hiding as info wars
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:49.680]  Exhaustively documented over the past several months a clinton ally even told politico quote the clintons have this notion that they only need
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:51.920]  To go as far as they need to in terms of disclosure
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:59.200]  But they can't afford to approach this that way and to find out more visit info wars.com and the alex jones channel on youtube

[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:46.960]  Now he's just with us for a segment or two because he's a busy guy and
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:53.200]  Uh, the woods are lovely dark and deep, but we got a lot of news to cover before we sleep some special breaking reports
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:59.440]  You name it, but here's the two areas. I want to cover with pacenic and he can add whatever quadrant he wants into this
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:06.560]  Hey, am I wrong at a gut level that this is a big victory that mainstream media has been discredited obviously hillary is very sick
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:11.760]  No matter how many medical doctors they fire what they do major medical associations even say she looks really ill
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  What in the hell is she doing taking these medications?
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.040]  What pacenic said over a month ago is what drew said a week later
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:23.520]  Um, that what is she doing taking armored thyroid and cumulative? This is insane. My dad's an oral surgeon
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:28.400]  He knows that's crazy and showing me, you know, just the drug interactions. It's how you kill somebody
[02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:33.120]  So drusas i'm worried about you hillary and they firing what's really going on with their health
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:36.240]  What does this signify for the media that's blowing up their face?
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:40.240]  And then the big enchilada their meeting this political even admits in dc
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:44.240]  The democrats or whether they're going to go to the electoral college the states
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:48.800]  And try to basically put the election off that is in mainstream news
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:51.680]  We have it boiled down in articles at info wars dot com
[02:09:52.400 --> 02:09:54.560]  So yeah, it's good at his credit the system
[02:09:55.120 --> 02:09:58.720]  But what in the world is going on obviously pacenic has a lot of context
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:05.280]  In the military and other areas that have been trying to block all this so we'll get his approximation of what's happening dr pacenic
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:12.800]  Thanks for coming on. It's my pleasure. Alex as usual. Uh, we were right a month ago. I said she was severely ill
[02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:14.960]  I said she had a physical mental illness
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:21.760]  I explained it in detail. I didn't wish her harm, but I would we turned out to be correct. Uh, dr
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:29.840]  Her doctor was wrong. Uh, she's not in excellent health. Lisa bardak who was trained her doctor was trained at cornell where I trained
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:36.400]  She should have done a lot better. Uh, work up. This is she cannot run for the president of the united states
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:41.360]  It's as categorical as I said a month ago. I said it yesterday to my people
[02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:44.880]  I said, here's the following number one. The media is discredited
[02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:50.640]  It turns out that a lot of our twitters now have been retweeted by people on the mainstream media
[02:10:51.200 --> 02:10:54.160]  But despite all that we have a major problem right now
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:11:00.400]  The democratic national committee has to meet but so does the president united states and biden the issue now
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:06.960]  is one of the maintaining the uh, integrity of the republic and the transition of power
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:12.880]  This is not the first time I've encountered this problem. I encountered when I was a medical student with john fk
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:16.960]  john f kennedy who was psychotic had a sense of disease
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:22.240]  We encountered it with nixon who had been in the hospital under stress. We encountered with reagan
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:25.840]  Who also had problems and so on and so forth. So
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:31.920]  The republic has to now go back to its intelligence and its national security
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:34.000]  elements
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:36.880]  Including the generals chairman of joint chiefs of staff
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:40.320]  Including the president of the united states and the vice president
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:43.520]  This is a a political issue which has to deal with
[02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:49.440]  The transition of power and the election of a person who has to be viable
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:55.440]  So the democratic national committee can pick biden. I have no problem with that or they can pick sanders
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:58.000]  I have no problem with that but in both cases
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:04.000]  They have to reveal the medical records of either biden who's already had an aneurysm who's had multiple
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:06.560]  problems although he's been effective
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:09.040]  These are the his own
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:14.800]  Legislation and the fact that he can recuperate sanders isn't pretty good physical health
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:21.440]  That's not up to me. What's up to me is the fact that we must open up the medical records of trump
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.480]  Which he will do and now the in fact reportedly he's at the doctor today. I've got that from the folks
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:30.880]  That's correct. But the key element now alex and what you have been part of and again
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:37.680]  I'm not throwing whose hosanna is at you is that you opened up and allowed us to open up the truth
[02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:44.320]  Once again, and ironically the truth came on a double truth with 9 11 and her passing out
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:48.800]  Was that not biblical? Was that not archetypal biblical that is greek tragedy?
[02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:52.640]  That is an amazing statement if one believes in a god, which I do
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:58.560]  It's his statement or her statement saying you will be punished for what you have done
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:01.760]  And so will the republic chainy bush
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:05.600]  Zellick and a whole bunch of the neocons that she was working with
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:12.960]  Now we have to concern ourselves about the republic and that's one of the issues that I've suggested to my people
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:17.120]  That they think very carefully that they have doctors from all four
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:19.760]  Services the navy air force
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:25.360]  Army that they have the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the director of national intelligence clapper
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:29.680]  Along with president obama who I believe will do the best he can
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:36.400]  For the republic in terms of transition of power as well as biden others and because they're not going to get away
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:43.040]  We're trying to pull some some scam. I mean, it's gonna blow up. I I honestly don't believe that in a time of of
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:47.920]  Crisis, which this is quite frankly where we predicted this correctly
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:53.520]  This is not an issue of whether we were right which we were and the media was I haven't used that term
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:56.960]  But probably I've said this looks like a super historical crisis we're in
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:02.480]  It is and and honestly alex you and and the people have been part of this
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:07.040]  I mean, this is the war. It's the people. It's drudge and she was all of us together because the mainstream media is
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:12.160]  Make it clear because we've taken so much punishment. No, you're right. You're right
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:18.480]  Not only remember just a month ago. She even said we were part of a conspiracy theory of medicine
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:23.520]  And we she came out said I had a dark heart and was the enemy and that our media should be shut down
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:24.720]  That's correct
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:29.680]  But be it as it may right now we have another issue which you should address with other people
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:36.000]  About the transition of power in the republic not usurption of power. Obama understands this
[02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:41.280]  I have full faith he will not usurp power. I have full faith that biden will not usurp power
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:46.960]  I know some of the people in the democratic party. They knew very well when I said a month ago
[02:14:47.360 --> 02:14:53.360]  These people know me and they know my capability to be a physician. I wasn't kidding that she was
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:15:00.800]  Impaired I don't wish her that the part that really shocks me alex and I got to say this to the audience as well as
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:05.360]  You know neither chelsea bill clinton or anybody in her family
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:11.200]  Made a major effort to stop her from destroying herself physically and mentally
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:18.480]  That's what shocked me and I happen to have met chelsea and I happen to know her and she's a very caring individual
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:22.560]  Why no one in her family stopped this nonsense?
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:25.600]  I can't explain that's my biggest point
[02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:31.360]  Is what is hillary thinking when she's obviously been so sick for years and is deteriorating quickly
[02:15:31.680 --> 02:15:34.560]  That she could get away with this. It really shows delusion
[02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:41.680]  Correct that is total self delusion you and I have been talking about it for years on and it's pathological
[02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:47.600]  But now finally the body the body said no more no more delusion
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:54.240]  No more stress. I can't handle it. She let me ask you this question as a medical doctor is an expert on the brain looking at this
[02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:56.640]  Yes, let me clearly she's
[02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:03.120]  Deteriorating quickly. She's wearing the glasses or people that have seizures. She's currently having a seizure when she falls over
[02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:05.520]  How are they going to spin this and
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:10.320]  Am I correct? It looks like she's deteriorating quickly. What could be the real cause?
[02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:15.920]  Well, the real cause is that she has a tumor on the brain and also a tumor in the lung
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:22.480]  We don't know where any any element metastasized what I do know is a continuous fainting and sycophage
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:24.480]  syncope which we call
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:28.320]  Fainting as well as the seizures and the fact that she's had people
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:32.320]  Who've tried to cover up the the answer is not a good answer
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:36.160]  I don't wish this but the inevitable outcome will be some form
[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:38.960]  Of disability and I hope not death
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:43.040]  But this is not a course that has an upward slope to it
[02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:46.160]  And that's why I'm saying to the democratic national committee
[02:16:46.480 --> 02:16:52.000]  Listen carefully. You have physicians there who work for me. Jim McDermott is a board certified
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:56.240]  Psychiatrist and adult and child you have ran paul
[02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:00.640]  You have been well Ben Carson and republican, but you have 19 physicians
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:07.280]  In congress any one of them or all of them should examine her and make the final determination
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:12.400]  What's interesting alex is historically we physicians have been very much a part
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:14.880]  Of the republic. I'm not an aberration
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:17.440]  11 percent of the
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:20.480]  Declaration of independence was written by physicians
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:24.560]  And nine percent of the constitution were written by physicians
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:30.400]  So you have carried on along with me and others a very noble tradition of allowing physicians
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:35.040]  To maintain the integrity of the republic she cannot run
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:40.880]  That is absolutely what so what do you expect them to do? I mean there's different things that they're openly in the news talking about
[02:17:40.880 --> 02:17:45.600]  Uh, you having to go to the electoral college of the states. I mean this is crazy
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:51.280]  It will not go to the electoral college because the electoral college does not represent the will of the people
[02:17:51.760 --> 02:17:53.760]  What it has to do is have a temporary
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:56.560]  Abance while trump
[02:17:56.640 --> 02:18:03.760]  You know continues his nomination or is a campaign either they put biden in or bernie sanders
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:08.000]  But the reality is we don't want to push the the the end of the election back, right?
[02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:12.320]  They might and I don't have a problem with that and the reason for that is that
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:16.640]  We have a crisis. It should have been predictable what happened
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:19.280]  But the truth of the matter is once again
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:26.000]  This is what happens when you have nefarious deeds within the hillary. No, I agree in this arrogance this this delusion
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:28.800]  so not only arrogance, but it's the nature of
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:34.880]  Willfully harming the republic. I you know the issue of arrogance is one
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:41.120]  But the fact that they were willing to harm the republic to put somebody in who was not capable
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:44.080]  Of running the republic that's inexcusable
[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:50.000]  That is uh, that is treason and for me that's many other issues, but let's address this issue
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:56.080]  The elections will have to be delayed the democratic national committee can sponsor whomever they want
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:58.400]  They have to be very careful about it
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:04.720]  The president of the united states will not usurp power because the the the military and the intelligence community
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:10.640]  Will be on alert for that he understands that and he understands that we're willing to work with him
[02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:15.680]  On a mutually assured basis of construction not destruction
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:20.960]  So this is one of the times in america and in the world where the world is watching us
[02:19:21.360 --> 02:19:24.080]  And what happens now will show the best
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:28.800]  Elements of our country. Hillary will have to resign. We'll have to pull back
[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:32.320]  Well, I think it'll overall even if they delayed it two or three months at you in the next year
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:36.880]  I think it overall will put trump way ahead discrediting the democrats and the mainstream media
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:42.560]  I think this is a demarcation point where you can really mark the true death of the mainstream media
[02:19:42.560 --> 02:19:47.040]  We're going to come back with one more segment. See if you agree with me. Dr. Pachennik stevepachennik.com twitter.com

[02:24:16.500 --> 02:24:24.100]  Dr. C. Buchanick is our guest. I have a clip here. I want to play let's go ahead and go to that clip
[02:24:27.540 --> 02:24:30.260]  Like you I just I see what I see the coughing fit
[02:24:30.980 --> 02:24:34.180]  Was a week ago. So I assume that was pneumonia also
[02:24:34.740 --> 02:24:40.580]  I would think it would have been so something's going on, but I just hope she gets well and gets back on the trail
[02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:43.860]  And we'll we'll be seeing her at the debate
[02:24:43.860 --> 02:24:48.660]  We'll even once she came out an hour and a half later and hugged that child and that
[02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:55.220]  Stage propaganda like out of some third world, you know dictatorship. She really looks worse by the day
[02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:59.300]  Uh, dr. Buchanick, but but but going back before the break. I was asking the question
[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:03.220]  I mean overall doesn't all of this just advance the
[02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:05.940]  Populism the new americanism
[02:25:06.580 --> 02:25:12.420]  The patriotism we see and I think overall this is a big win for the new media trump and the awakening
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:16.020]  Yeah, I would agree with you because it's taken five years
[02:25:16.580 --> 02:25:21.540]  For the new patriotism and the new america to arise after the 9 11
[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:26.980]  Nonsense and story lines that have continued and they're just not working
[02:25:27.140 --> 02:25:33.140]  But beyond that what it really tells us is how do we handle a more media crisis?
[02:25:33.460 --> 02:25:34.660]  Ironically today
[02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:41.540]  There's been a ceasefire in syria and now it's up to the president to decide what he wants to do domestically
[02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:49.140]  So we are being judged more importantly than hillary hillary is really not as significant as everybody thinks at this moment
[02:25:49.460 --> 02:25:53.540]  What's far more important is how the republic reacts to a crisis like this
[02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:58.100]  If they decide to delay the election or they decide that she runs in the election
[02:25:58.580 --> 02:26:01.540]  And they decide that trump may or may not win an election
[02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:06.740]  That is what the world will be looking at and that is what the stock markets will be reflecting
[02:26:06.740 --> 02:26:11.460]  So it's an important time for us and actually the new america
[02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:14.580]  That you're part of i'm part of and others
[02:26:14.980 --> 02:26:19.780]  It's a populism that broke through the lies distortions and corruptions
[02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:24.740]  But at the same time now we have to show that we have understanding compassion
[02:26:25.220 --> 02:26:31.620]  And absolutely now is where we have to continue not getting into race wars and stuff that sorus wants
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:35.460]  We have to really have some very very serious smarts here
[02:26:35.460 --> 02:26:39.460]  Correct and what has to happen now is we have to be judicious
[02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:44.020]  We have to be as we've always been serious and we have to understand
[02:26:44.420 --> 02:26:52.660]  What is the next evolution in the republic and maintaining the stability of the republic with our great warriors our great intelligence service
[02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:58.580]  And now we have to be able to maintain that capability financially and politically
[02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:03.460]  So that the world says my god only in america could they get through this
[02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:07.380]  Absolutely. Well, I know for a fact trump was approached by great patriots. Some of which you know
[02:27:07.940 --> 02:27:10.900]  And he already the country was in trouble and they actually drafted him in
[02:27:11.460 --> 02:27:16.420]  Uh, and the fact that he's done all this is just amazing. This is so historic
[02:27:16.980 --> 02:27:20.980]  I'm just really worried about the fact that they're so arrogant. It's it's clear to you and others
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:25.620]  She needs to step down immediately. They're so arrogant. They might just run her even though she might even be able to walk
[02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:32.980]  I mean, uh, well, you may be right alex, but the irony of self-destruction is that it really does become
[02:27:33.540 --> 02:27:36.100]  Self-destruction and she will not make it
[02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:42.500]  I can guarantee you as a physician. She will not make it if even she gets elected to the white house
[02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:45.140]  Well, give us your brief prognosis looking at her. I mean, she's a good
[02:27:45.460 --> 02:27:50.820]  I mean the fact that she coughed a week and a half ago. I timed her coughing in long island
[02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:56.260]  It was two and a half minutes without stopping subsequently. I watched how she fell down
[02:27:56.340 --> 02:28:00.580]  That's not the first time the second or the third time her doctor knows very well
[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:06.980]  That the full scans and the CAT scans and MRI and all the rest that was done at physician insurgents
[02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:13.300]  What I've said for over a month will reveal that she has tumors. She has thrombosis. She is not well
[02:28:13.700 --> 02:28:16.660]  She's not capable of running for the president of the united
[02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:21.460]  What are they thinking about that is credits to the whole power structure behind her that they're crazy to run a corpse
[02:28:21.780 --> 02:28:27.460]  Well, the point is it's wishful thinking and what she will argue and what the bill clinton will argue is look
[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:31.780]  We have the chance to get in there or be it then we'll pass it on to tim kane
[02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:36.020]  The truth is tim kane is not qualified to be president of the united states
[02:28:36.020 --> 02:28:40.740]  By the way, it's even in the hill you talked about this two weeks ago that he is basically these marxist connections
[02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:48.100]  Oh, I mean, he's pathetic. He's just a political operative who grow. You know, it was a jesuit who worked with the cia
[02:28:48.420 --> 02:28:53.540]  Denied it had the new york times have to write back to me to say. Oh, he's not cia
[02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:55.380]  Really, I could care less
[02:28:55.380 --> 02:28:59.940]  But the truth of the matter is everything he said about on doors was an absolute lie
[02:29:00.500 --> 02:29:04.900]  And he wasn't very much involved in closing. You made a lot of predictions. You don't like to make them
[02:29:04.900 --> 02:29:06.500]  But we have 60 seconds
[02:29:06.500 --> 02:29:10.900]  Do you think I mean what's going to come out of these meetings the next few days that they admit are ongoing a political
[02:29:10.900 --> 02:29:14.180]  I think the dnc will ask for postponement of an election
[02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:16.100]  Good lord
[02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:18.980]  Well, no, it's it's good america because
[02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:27.540]  The american public has to decide and at this point the new american republic, which we represent so-called conspiracy people
[02:29:27.780 --> 02:29:28.820]  Which is ironic
[02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:34.020]  We're the only ones who are speaking the truth of 15 years and the real conspiracy is broken down
[02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:39.620]  All the way from 9 11 to hillary. That's right. Their conspiracy screwed. Trump keeps the nomination
[02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:44.020]  They have to get a new nominee. This is pretty amazing. We'll talk to you soon. Dr. Pachennik. Thank you. Either way, he'll win

[02:29:54.580 --> 02:29:57.460]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:57.460 --> 02:30:06.100]  Could top democrats push for a suspension of the presidential election if hillary clinton drops out due to her health
[02:30:06.180 --> 02:30:13.780]  Would obama then attempt to stay in office to spike constitutional limits in august secret service sources told info wars that hillary's campaign
[02:30:13.860 --> 02:30:19.620]  Will be forced into making a big announcement soon regarding her medical condition that announcement came september 11th
[02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:24.580]  When her campaign blamed pneumonia for her nasty fall although this explanation is already under severe doubt
[02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:30.340]  Given that the campaign initially lied by claiming hillary had merely overheated before her collapse in new york overheated
[02:30:30.500 --> 02:30:37.140]  The temperature was in the low to mid 70s fahrenheit the secret service sources also told info wars that government vehicles that transport
[02:30:37.220 --> 02:30:41.220]  hillary to campaign events had to be fitted with disabled access to her health
[02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:46.980]  Now we see why in the video shot on september 11th showing secret service having to practically carry hillary into a vehicle
[02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:53.780]  Paul joseph watson reported that top dnc strategists are now holding a crisis meeting to discuss whether to replace hillary with another candidate

[02:35:48.420 --> 02:35:52.340]  And they just hope we just sit there and by their lives don't we're countering them with facts
[02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:57.860]  You are just as important as joe bigs leon macadoo myself matt drudge years ago
[02:35:58.660 --> 02:36:02.580]  You know would tweak this out and tell reporters this and told paul watch on this at dinner
[02:36:02.900 --> 02:36:06.100]  You know years and years ago and told told me this you know at dinner
[02:36:06.340 --> 02:36:10.820]  You're just as important as the new york times, and you know what i take it further they've been discredited
[02:36:10.820 --> 02:36:12.820]  We're more important, but what he's saying is
[02:36:13.620 --> 02:36:17.300]  We're here. We're covering something. We're pointing something out just like that citizen that
[02:36:17.780 --> 02:36:21.940]  videotaped hillary collapsing with the seizure i've seen two members of my family
[02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:26.260]  You know that have epilepsy from head injuries. You know you're sitting there talking to them. They're just fine. I'll something go
[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:30.340]  Boom that's what's going on
[02:36:30.980 --> 02:36:35.940]  Uh, and it's clear and it's happening. I want to play this clip. We've got a bunch of these clips
[02:36:35.940 --> 02:36:37.380]  I want to boom boom boom
[02:36:37.380 --> 02:36:40.660]  But leon you've been chomping at the bit and then joe bigs take a few minutes
[02:36:40.660 --> 02:36:44.820]  You've got the floor on just your overall view of where this is going how crazy this is
[02:36:45.060 --> 02:36:50.340]  Well, I think it's so incredible how them the media immediately when she was coughing because of the allergies
[02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:52.260]  They immediately went out and said yes
[02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:58.820]  It the pollen was really high that day and just it's like just do your job and report in a way that you're not biased
[02:36:58.900 --> 02:37:00.900]  You don't have to be her
[02:37:01.540 --> 02:37:05.300]  Cheerleaders, you know just do your job and be an independent non-biased journalist
[02:37:05.300 --> 02:37:10.420]  And then of course you played the clip earlier of the two women making excuses saying how
[02:37:11.300 --> 02:37:15.380]  You know how heavily she was dressed and well if I would have been out there in that same outfit
[02:37:15.460 --> 02:37:17.460]  I would have also passed out. Oh my goodness
[02:37:17.620 --> 02:37:21.300]  So on the one hand they're trying to say don't call hillary clinton week
[02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:23.380]  It's sexist to talk about her health
[02:37:23.380 --> 02:37:28.100]  But then you have these women saying how hard it is to be dressed in a jacket
[02:37:28.100 --> 02:37:31.060]  I mean think about all the men in three-piece suits out there that by the way
[02:37:31.060 --> 02:37:36.900]  We looked it up just like joe said at the time. She was out there at 10 or 11. It was like 75 76. The high was 82
[02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:40.900]  This is total bs hillary. It's just so weak her clothing. It's so hard
[02:37:40.900 --> 02:37:45.380]  Well, she wasn't wearing that thick mouth suit like she normally is right. She was wearing an actual
[02:37:46.340 --> 02:37:51.620]  Pant suit like an actual business attire that you would normally see a woman in that position wear
[02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:57.380]  And she looks skinnier and more frail because deep down. That's what she is skinny frail. She's weak
[02:37:57.380 --> 02:38:04.180]  She's sick. But when she puts this huge mouth coat on she looks a lot bigger and more, you know, just bloated out or whatever
[02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:08.420]  But yeah, she was probably the lightest she was dressed. What about how she also has to go to like
[02:38:09.700 --> 02:38:14.740]  Uh labor day events and stuff where there's other crowds. No one even wants to see her we go with camera people
[02:38:14.740 --> 02:38:19.940]  There's like 50 people 20 people. This is a total facade. What were the elite thinking?
[02:38:20.660 --> 02:38:22.820]  They had to close off the room that they gave her
[02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:27.140]  Uh, when she went to go speak with um the church groups because no one showed up
[02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:33.540]  So they had to make the room smaller to give the appearance that they brought those girls in and what you think of a chenic saying brain tumor lung
[02:38:34.020 --> 02:38:35.620]  tumor that guy's like
[02:38:35.620 --> 02:38:36.660]  You know inside
[02:38:36.660 --> 02:38:42.820]  I mean, it's like as they keep reporting on her stories. They're like, well, she had that over uh dehydration and overheating due to this
[02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:45.460]  Fainting spell and then it was some kind of
[02:38:46.020 --> 02:38:50.180]  Gastro and she's just like so many people that have cancer which god bless them. They go. I'm gonna beat it
[02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:54.820]  I'm gonna beat it and then they die, you know, and it's sad, but I'm telling you it's like I'm beating it
[02:38:54.820 --> 02:38:59.780]  He's just had like a consecutive rolling out of illnesses year after year after year
[02:39:00.340 --> 02:39:04.180]  It's just you know to have single pay like that where you're just constantly fainting
[02:39:04.740 --> 02:39:06.740]  and giving yourself concussion and
[02:39:06.980 --> 02:39:12.340]  Bleeding tumors in your brain and I mean come on, but I've got to be honestly in and Joe Biggs
[02:39:12.980 --> 02:39:15.460]  Have you tuned in Alex Jones here speaking with info wars.com?
[02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:19.300]  I knew this was all coming and things are getting so surreal
[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:26.340]  But now they're openly in mainstream news talking about suspending the election and Hillary's collapsing and we're the leaders exposing it
[02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:30.660]  And it's just like what's coming next? I mean, what is it like for you guys to work here?
[02:39:31.300 --> 02:39:36.980]  Well for me just realizing how we really are shaping the narrative and kind of you you sit back and kind of go
[02:39:37.060 --> 02:39:40.820]  Whoa, we said that and now it's happening. It makes me just want to start speaking
[02:39:40.820 --> 02:39:46.340]  Like really powerfully into existence of how we really want things to be rather than just exposing it
[02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:48.340]  But just being like, you know what Trump's gonna win
[02:39:48.980 --> 02:39:50.980]  America's gonna be great again
[02:39:50.980 --> 02:39:53.380]  Patriotism is on the rise because that's the right thing
[02:39:53.380 --> 02:39:56.900]  It's got the history behind it and some of these people just go with whatever the media says
[02:39:57.300 --> 02:40:01.060]  You say listen stop believing him. Yeah, that's the interesting part of being here
[02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:07.540]  Is actually doing the research looking at the facts watching all the videos watching their speeches going to them being a part of it
[02:40:07.540 --> 02:40:11.540]  And then watching the mainstream media come out and spin it completely
[02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:16.980]  And a whole another way I was expecting today to to turn on the TV and hear them go well
[02:40:17.220 --> 02:40:21.380]  You know, she was just completely overwhelmed by all the memories that happened during 9 11
[02:40:21.700 --> 02:40:26.660]  And that is what caused her to just fall. She was so overwhelmed. You just said something really important job
[02:40:27.460 --> 02:40:32.420]  We are able because this is our job to full time do this the general public will be just as good as we were
[02:40:32.420 --> 02:40:37.220]  They're just too busy trying to make a living exactly their kids and deal all the taxes and regulations
[02:40:37.620 --> 02:40:39.940]  We do this full time. That's really a luxury
[02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:44.980]  My job is a luxury to be able to really fight this tyranny
[02:40:45.620 --> 02:40:49.540]  Exactly and one of the questions you asked earlier is, you know, what is this going to lead to?
[02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:54.340]  Where is this all going? You know, her health is failing extremely fast and you know, yesterday
[02:40:54.340 --> 02:40:58.100]  We saw her collapse. We saw the videos and there's a new article out at the hill right now
[02:40:58.100 --> 02:41:05.780]  It says Tim Kaine's radical roots. It says according to the media, Tim Kaine took a life transforming mission trip to latin america in
[02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:13.620]  1980 conveniently left out of these stories are the radical reality of the cold war in latin america and tim kaine's
[02:41:13.940 --> 02:41:15.940]  soviet sympathizing mentors
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:18.020]  This is a very interesting article
[02:41:18.020 --> 02:41:23.460]  It says connected dots with a little history and an alarming picture emerges of kaine's adventures with radicals and
[02:41:23.460 --> 02:41:28.100]  Revolutionaries in 1980 the truth is it was even worse. He was setting them up
[02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:33.140]  They said it talked about he's even worse. He's not even a real commie. He goes and sets them up
[02:41:33.780 --> 02:41:39.220]  They said that he doesn't leave them though any sanders. Yeah, they said that he embraced the interpretation of the gospel known as
[02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:42.020]  Liberation theology. Yeah
[02:41:42.020 --> 02:41:45.300]  That's the whole reconquista fourth foundation. Yeah, he's like a
[02:41:45.860 --> 02:41:47.700]  Marxist Jesuit
[02:41:47.700 --> 02:41:50.820]  Same as the pope hope says everybody in but not my palace
[02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:54.980]  Mm-hmm. Oh, these guys are incredible. I want to play a few clips here. We've got a ton of them
[02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:59.540]  Let's go ahead and what was the first clip you guys were telling me during the break it was important to play
[02:42:00.180 --> 02:42:02.180]  You were right, but I forget which one it was matt
[02:42:05.300 --> 02:42:09.060]  Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah, hillary clinton basket of deplorables. We have trumps
[02:42:10.180 --> 02:42:12.580]  Attack had responding to it. Let's play some of those clips
[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:15.700]  You know to just be grossly
[02:42:16.260 --> 02:42:18.260]  generalistic
[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:23.380]  You can put half of trumps supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables
[02:42:27.140 --> 02:42:29.140]  Right
[02:42:30.740 --> 02:42:34.820]  The racist sexes homophobic xenophobic
[02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:38.260]  Islamophobic you name it
[02:42:38.820 --> 02:42:40.820]  And unfortunately there are
[02:42:42.100 --> 02:42:44.100]  people like that
[02:42:44.100 --> 02:42:50.180]  Now here's stephanie cutter a dnc operative that's worked for obama going even further saying they're all deplorable. So
[02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:54.020]  This is true demonization. Yeah, and here's the deal
[02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:59.460]  I know so many liberals so many people that support trump because they actually remember stuff trump did
[02:43:00.020 --> 02:43:04.180]  Conservatives ought to be the ones that actually if you want to get down to brass tacks like mainline
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:08.900]  Super christian conservatives who are great people but sometimes ought to you know get the beam out of their own eye
[02:43:08.900 --> 02:43:13.700]  Because trump is not, you know, you know anti, you know gay where he hates these people, you know
[02:43:14.100 --> 02:43:19.700]  And trump really is liberal on a lot of things the difference is he wants prosperity. He's americana. That's why they hate him
[02:43:19.700 --> 02:43:21.700]  He's not a globalist. I mean the fact is he just
[02:43:22.820 --> 02:43:28.020]  The problem is he talks off the top of his heart like I do they can take it out of context, but here's the next clip
[02:43:29.620 --> 02:43:31.620]  My nexonian lurking in there
[02:43:32.420 --> 02:43:34.420]  Stephanie it's tough to defend
[02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:39.620]  Uh, the remark is it or no, do you think it's tough to defend the remark deplorables to do that?
[02:43:40.420 --> 02:43:46.660]  Absolutely not. I think that her only mistake is that she said half of his supporters were deplorable
[02:43:47.220 --> 02:43:52.820]  Does anybody around this table have they not seen trump's rallies? Have they not seen trump's own remarks?
[02:43:53.460 --> 02:43:56.660]  He he is attracting a certain type of voter
[02:43:56.980 --> 02:44:03.140]  She gave a whole speech on describing and they're called the alt right and they they tweet racist things
[02:44:03.140 --> 02:44:05.140]  He retweets them
[02:44:06.260 --> 02:44:08.260]  From research in this election, we know
[02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:12.260]  Donald Trump uses his own plane
[02:44:12.260 --> 02:44:15.220]  To land because he had a medical staff on there to help someone out last week
[02:44:15.220 --> 02:44:19.620]  I believe it was then he also used this plane to go get people that needed to be rescued
[02:44:19.780 --> 02:44:23.940]  This guy's not deplorable. He goes out and goes above and beyond the but he's not a lazy ass
[02:44:24.260 --> 02:44:31.220]  He went to mexico. He went to Louisiana. It's so obvious that the elite are so arrogant. They would run a doddering collapsing
[02:44:31.220 --> 02:44:33.220]  brain damaged
[02:44:34.340 --> 02:44:35.780]  Person
[02:44:35.780 --> 02:44:37.460]  And then and then think we're so dumb
[02:44:37.460 --> 02:44:40.420]  We can't see how sick she is when three speeches on monday
[02:44:40.420 --> 02:44:45.540]  She had to cancel and hacking fits and then she's gone all week and pops back up and falls on her butt
[02:44:45.780 --> 02:44:52.500]  And then comes out of her house in a stage wag with dog little girl. Oh little girl. I mean, this is ridiculous
[02:44:52.660 --> 02:44:55.380]  Yes, she's canceled her trips to california. She's supposed to go to today
[02:44:56.020 --> 02:44:58.020]  I want to play this clip and and and
[02:44:58.020 --> 02:45:05.380]  Uh, because it's for radio audiences. We can also narrate over at some the full video is going up on info wars.com and prismplanet.com
[02:45:05.540 --> 02:45:07.940]  It may already be up but do spend a lot of time on this
[02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:13.380]  A compilation of a lot of her different health problems and things that happen. So we're going to air, uh,
[02:45:13.780 --> 02:45:18.580]  That right now and then basically narrate rob do's six minute clip that our news director
[02:45:19.060 --> 02:45:23.300]  Put together. We're going to post this all over info wars. We're going to tweet it. We're going to facebook it at real
[02:45:23.300 --> 02:45:26.740]  Alex Jones, please get this video out. Let's go ahead and start it right now
[02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:32.340]  We we are in an information war and we are losing that war. Bet you are
[02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:36.340]  Um, do you also know that hillary clinton uses a wheelchair?
[02:45:37.300 --> 02:45:43.460]  Her personal vehicle has had to be outfitted with a wheelchair lift because she is not a person who can actually walk
[02:45:44.180 --> 02:45:48.180]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times. You think you've seen her walking? She hasn't been walking
[02:45:48.260 --> 02:45:50.660]  Hey, let's hit pause and back this up. I'm gonna skip this break. It's so important
[02:45:51.860 --> 02:45:54.100]  Think about this. It's so ridiculous. She's saying last week
[02:45:54.100 --> 02:45:58.180]  She lied so that I said she couldn't walk when the Secret Service said she has these
[02:45:58.740 --> 02:46:03.380]  Access vehicles and then we actually get photos. There's a wheelchair too. It's worse than what the Secret Service told us
[02:46:03.460 --> 02:46:06.660]  Quarter million dollars. They said a quit that we're not going to tell you just go
[02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:11.060]  They said please come to the rallies. They said put your cruise on the rallies. You'll see to be fair
[02:46:11.140 --> 02:46:14.100]  They didn't even give us any info. They just said if you come you will see
[02:46:15.060 --> 02:46:17.220]  And we did there's a damn wheelchair coming out the back
[02:46:17.220 --> 02:46:24.340]  Yeah, Millie sees the gurney wheeling the gurney over. Oh my god. And then she says we're lying and three days later
[02:46:24.340 --> 02:46:28.420]  It comes out. She needs to apologize. The lie she said about us is we didn't say that comes true
[02:46:28.660 --> 02:46:32.180]  Did you send mr. Maddow a box of super super male vitality?
[02:46:32.820 --> 02:46:36.260]  Well, she's got the super female, right? Oh, I don't I think that's chris haze
[02:46:37.380 --> 02:46:39.380]  I can't ever tell which one's which
[02:46:39.460 --> 02:46:42.580]  I told everybody I'm not always gay. But when I am it's for maddow or trump
[02:46:43.220 --> 02:46:45.220]  Look the dream trip
[02:46:45.220 --> 02:46:50.820]  All right, I'm gonna stop right now. I'm sorry. I already bought fried chicken for the whole office in celebration
[02:46:51.380 --> 02:46:56.660]  I'm serious. That's why we celebrate my family. Let's uh, let's go back to the uh, the video here it is
[02:46:57.220 --> 02:47:01.060]  With a wheelchair lift because she is not a person who can actually walk
[02:47:01.780 --> 02:47:06.660]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times you think you've seen her walking. She hasn't been walking. Did you know that?
[02:47:07.700 --> 02:47:09.700]  Did you also know that hillary clinton has
[02:47:09.700 --> 02:47:14.100]  Her favorite place to eat is land. You could not make up
[02:47:15.460 --> 02:47:19.540]  That's her saying that she has to be she can't walk. Sorry. You know what her favorite place to eat at is?
[02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:22.980]  Little seizures pizza little seizures pizza
[02:47:24.580 --> 02:47:27.780]  I want to be fair people have love except it's very serious. It's hit my family very hard
[02:47:27.780 --> 02:47:30.660]  But them lying about it. She's a public figure. It's fair game. Yeah, exactly
[02:47:30.660 --> 02:47:34.980]  I mean in this person is all the veterans. She's gotten killed the christian. She turned all kind of loose on
[02:47:34.980 --> 02:47:41.220]  I say rapist child rapist that she's gotten off. Yep. She's fair game. She's deplorable. Absolutely
[02:47:41.380 --> 02:47:47.220]  Anyone who has an entire book website everything dedicated to the clinton body count should not be by the way
[02:47:47.380 --> 02:47:50.500]  Google's been caught censoring that again. And now they're censoring this
[02:47:51.140 --> 02:47:55.780]  Yeah, okay. Let's go back to the footage. They don't want you to see I've had to pay licensing fees almost crap for this
[02:47:55.860 --> 02:47:56.980]  Here we go
[02:47:56.980 --> 02:48:02.500]  Yeah, these things are true. I know they are true because I read them in the headlines here
[02:48:02.500 --> 02:48:07.620]  I will prove it to you. Here was the shock headline on hillary clinton's wheelchair vehicle
[02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:12.420]  Just one column over from that there was also this
[02:48:16.100 --> 02:48:18.820]  Does hillary clinton have parkinson's disease the subhead there
[02:48:20.740 --> 02:48:22.740]  She has some very serious
[02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:27.940]  And our our private media cannot fill that gap
[02:48:27.940 --> 02:48:35.220]  Uh, the media spinning lies and misinformation to try to get us off of that hot button that we're on so
[02:48:35.700 --> 02:48:41.940]  Well, exactly. We've bought since got an article out today. Just how the clinton campaign is really pushing for the media to
[02:48:42.260 --> 02:48:44.260]  Blatantly cover up lie
[02:48:44.260 --> 02:48:58.260]  By anything they do not want to touch this hillary's health. They think this could have the potential to derail her entire campaign
[02:48:58.820 --> 02:49:00.820]  Everyone's held back a little girl runs up
[02:49:01.300 --> 02:49:06.660]  Oh, look, oh, here's he says she was standing on a curb with a protective detail waiting for her motorcade
[02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:10.260]  Uh, they were surprised to see her because she wasn't supposed to be leaving yet
[02:49:10.340 --> 02:49:12.340]  So they had to wait for the motorcade two or three minutes
[02:49:12.340 --> 02:49:14.340]  There's there's the black guy that's always there with the pen
[02:49:14.580 --> 02:49:19.140]  Yeah, and her doctor and the reason they got a really big guy is she's falling over man. It's hard to pick up that way
[02:49:19.220 --> 02:49:24.580]  Exactly. Uh, her protective detail actually helped her in to that van and then the van took off
[02:49:24.740 --> 02:49:26.340]  Presumably they're used to this
[02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:28.340]  She comes off, they're like, okay
[02:49:28.340 --> 02:49:31.300]  Well, let's see if her chair is tall so she said, listen, she's getting worse
[02:49:31.700 --> 02:49:36.900]  We said, well, she's falling down possibly they won't tell us what it is. They're not doctors, it's epilepsy
[02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:41.860]  Just moments ago because of the only brain tumor medical episode that hillary clinton was suffering
[02:49:41.860 --> 02:49:46.660]  It's extremely humid temperatures. She was adorned in a long sleeved coat
[02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:50.660]  And she was adorned
[02:49:52.580 --> 02:49:55.700]  Into the car she was a little bit unstable there
[02:49:59.300 --> 02:50:01.940]  I love how they're gaslighting us in real time
[02:50:01.940 --> 02:50:06.660]  Hit pause. There's like a race car crash. It's like blowing out. Like it's a little unstable
[02:50:06.660 --> 02:50:14.340]  Oh, I love how they're like rolling the video while the lady's narrating. Is this not the best comedy?
[02:50:14.580 --> 02:50:16.980]  I mean, I'm sorry. She's sick, but these people are funny, man
[02:50:17.220 --> 02:50:21.300]  But did you see how quickly the rest of that crew moved in around her as soon as she collapsed?
[02:50:21.380 --> 02:50:25.860]  She saw a human wall just a secret service said we're not gonna tell you everything
[02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:32.580]  Just come to the come to her events and watch and we get there. It's like ambulances gurney's people running around everywhere
[02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:34.580]  They're
[02:50:35.060 --> 02:50:37.060]  E&T secret service
[02:50:37.140 --> 02:50:39.140]  How much
[02:50:40.340 --> 02:50:42.740]  Cheese with body armor on and it gets worse
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:49.220]  You know the mainstream media has been getting all this. It knows it these guys these guys are I bet mad. I'll change this hillary's diapers
[02:50:50.820 --> 02:50:54.660]  These guys are way more armored than the freaking medical people we had in iraq
[02:50:57.700 --> 02:50:59.700]  Let's go back to the rest of BS here it is
[02:50:59.700 --> 02:51:04.900]  What I'm wearing now to be appropriately addressed to anchor a broadcast. It's not terribly hot today, john
[02:51:05.860 --> 02:51:12.020]  Warm certainly warm and warm at the scene certainly warm again. Hilary clinton my source the real story here
[02:51:12.260 --> 02:51:14.660]  Is she appeared to be having some sort of medical episode?
[02:51:14.900 --> 02:51:20.980]  She has an unbelievably challenging taxing schedule that would be so physically for anybody, right?
[02:51:21.140 --> 02:51:23.140]  Let alone somebody
[02:51:23.140 --> 02:51:29.780]  Yeah, this was so much so let's make this woman who can't deal with the whole issue of tight schedules and
[02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:32.340]  There's only we in the process
[02:51:33.620 --> 02:51:35.620]  All the the conspiracy theories
[02:51:36.020 --> 02:51:40.980]  You know, why is it that an advanced and fairly well educated country like ours is nevertheless?
[02:51:41.700 --> 02:51:49.140]  Getting to be as susceptible to political conspiracy theories as broadly uneducated countries in faraway lands
[02:51:49.140 --> 02:51:52.660]  Because the media is dumbing everyone down
[02:51:53.780 --> 02:51:55.780]  There he is like helping
[02:51:58.900 --> 02:52:00.900]  Okay, here we are
[02:52:00.900 --> 02:52:04.260]  There's nothing wrong with her. I'm out on the campaign with her aside from that cough
[02:52:04.660 --> 02:52:10.020]  She has more energy than I do or have the press corps, which is a lot younger than her the rest of the press corps
[02:52:10.420 --> 02:52:13.540]  But the fact is that they have only made things worse
[02:52:13.540 --> 02:52:24.020]  Now they're allowed to come report when she has a real estate and that's when I got spit on that time
[02:52:24.420 --> 02:52:30.020]  And if she has pneumonia right here, she should be she's spreading all that contagion by coughing with I'm glad
[02:52:30.020 --> 02:52:34.260]  I wore that a bullet. Oh, of course. It's all made up. I mean she doesn't have an alien
[02:52:34.420 --> 02:52:39.540]  I know why is it that we get more and more susceptible conspiracy theories as
[02:52:39.540 --> 02:52:42.980]  It's a sustainable concern conspiracy theories as time goes on
[02:52:43.060 --> 02:52:47.060]  We don't seem like the kind of country where they would have as much traction as they do now
[02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:49.620]  Especially with all the efforts by the media
[02:52:50.340 --> 02:52:54.580]  Part of the reason why we're so susceptible to conspiracy theories right now is that
[02:52:55.140 --> 02:52:57.220]  Guys like alex jones make a ton of money
[02:52:57.540 --> 02:53:01.140]  Circulating though as widely as they possibly can they use multiple platforms
[02:53:01.220 --> 02:53:05.220]  They use talk radio and the internet and they live stream their kind of fake TV shows
[02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:13.540]  How dare you do exactly what? I always announce he has sponsors and sell stuff. Let's go to break
[02:53:14.180 --> 02:53:20.740]  I mean, it's like they got they're selling prozac. I'm selling vitamin c, you know, no, I'm so evil. I'm selling t-shirts. I'm so bad
[02:53:21.540 --> 02:53:24.500]  He's on the radio and tv and the internet
[02:53:25.620 --> 02:53:30.660]  How dare he I don't think she was able to stand up long enough because she didn't have that earpiece in her air anymore
[02:53:30.660 --> 02:53:36.100]  Remember we called her out on that and that's gone. So her handler wasn't able to tell her and we didn't do this last week in front
[02:53:36.100 --> 02:53:39.700]  Of the other one, but we blew that up. They had digitized. They were so lazy
[02:53:40.020 --> 02:53:44.260]  They had digitized it in those photos out the msnbc executive came out and said no
[02:53:44.260 --> 02:53:48.980]  That's a ball of wax with light reflecting off of it that looks like an earpiece
[02:53:49.300 --> 02:53:54.340]  They blurred it the damn pixels are there. I mean these people are crazy dude because they got to be telling her
[02:53:54.340 --> 02:53:56.900]  Okay, okay people say well, she's really smart. She doesn't need help
[02:53:56.900 --> 02:54:00.660]  Yeah, until five years ago with her brain tumor the guys on the ear. She's flipping out. They got to go
[02:54:00.740 --> 02:54:05.700]  It's okay. It's okay. The guy the guys that is running the earpiece is like, all right. You're losing the code right now bark like a dog
[02:54:07.380 --> 02:54:10.260]  All right now make an extremely crazy looking face right now
[02:54:11.780 --> 02:54:14.740]  I know what the hell's all right, let's finish up the video here it is
[02:54:15.780 --> 02:54:21.220]  Because of it for a long time and usually this kind of stuff has no major effect on the united states of america
[02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:27.380]  Other than lowering our media and IQ a couple of points and making us seem slightly more embarrassing on an international stage
[02:54:27.540 --> 02:54:30.420]  Right for every additional year. They circulate their insane
[02:54:31.460 --> 02:54:37.300]  People theories of everything we get a little bit of a dumber and that's the major effect it has on the united states of america
[02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:41.060]  But this year you didn't even hear the clang this metal bolt falls out. It was clean
[02:54:41.700 --> 02:54:47.300]  That's probably the injection thing that was probably one of the needles where the cartridges is a guy comes up and just jab really quick
[02:54:47.300 --> 02:54:52.340]  Yeah, because you see when she came out even with the uh forum. She was like her eyes were like
[02:54:52.900 --> 02:54:57.380]  You know, she was pumped up on some some kind of just you look drug to not have seizures
[02:54:57.380 --> 02:55:01.940]  But also then they give you a pediment on top of it or right? I mean she looked whacked out of her noggin
[02:55:02.180 --> 02:55:04.180]  Right, let's give the launch codes to her immediately
[02:55:04.820 --> 02:55:06.820]  Please continue
[02:55:07.140 --> 02:55:10.340]  And then the secrecy yesterday and for an hour and a half the press corps
[02:55:10.980 --> 02:55:14.020]  The protective press look they just drag her in reporters
[02:55:14.020 --> 02:55:19.620]  Which is supposed to be with her just for this kind of emergency. They are kept back at the ceremonies
[02:55:19.620 --> 02:55:23.540]  They don't know that she's not told that you see like she was just a hunk of meat
[02:55:23.620 --> 02:55:27.140]  Then they're brought there so that we can see her coming out looking very spry
[02:55:29.700 --> 02:55:31.700]  Wow
[02:55:34.980 --> 02:55:41.060]  These went laid down to some like hyperbaric chamber they hear that they hadn't told everyone she had pneumonia after this first happened
[02:55:41.060 --> 02:55:43.060]  They finally tell
[02:55:47.060 --> 02:55:48.260]  Look
[02:55:48.260 --> 02:55:54.420]  Folks they think you're an idiot. They think we're idiots. We're not this whole thing is unraveling. This is spectacular
[02:55:54.500 --> 02:55:57.860]  The big question is what are they going to pull next? What are they going to pull next?
[02:55:57.940 --> 02:56:01.220]  Well, they're going to try and say it's pneumonia pneumonia the health history
[02:56:01.780 --> 02:56:06.900]  The health mystery is solved. It was pneumonia. Okay. We can all you know get back to work
[02:56:06.900 --> 02:56:11.540]  And maybe she'll take the next two weeks off so she can be there and and do the debates
[02:56:11.540 --> 02:56:15.220]  But what does she need for the next two weeks off for the exactly for the pneumonia?
[02:56:16.020 --> 02:56:18.020]  Collapses during the debates
[02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:22.820]  I had a dream about a month ago. I told people around the offices that were she's had a debate with trump
[02:56:22.820 --> 02:56:27.060]  It like falls over it's like going like this and I just go we're liberal. We have to give it to her now
[02:56:27.060 --> 02:56:30.100]  She fell over. Yeah, they might make her president just because she has no brain
[02:56:30.340 --> 02:56:33.860]  So my my I have a vision that it's just going to be trump on stage
[02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:38.660]  And then there's going to be like a computer monitor with a screen with her face giving answers or whatever
[02:56:38.660 --> 02:56:43.220]  Oh, yeah, drudge with the with the brain on the jar. Yeah drudge shut it brain the jar last year
[02:56:43.220 --> 02:56:47.540]  Right, it's it's hey, by the way, I know drudge only does interviews every three four years
[02:56:47.540 --> 02:56:49.540]  And if it is us, it's got to be somebody man
[02:56:49.940 --> 02:56:54.980]  I mean, please show back up come be interviewed by teleportation or by hologram
[02:56:55.300 --> 02:57:01.060]  It's time in this compressed time module one year is like five years now drudge drudge must appear
[02:57:01.060 --> 02:57:03.700]  Yes, it's not in a ritual. Uh, uh
[02:57:05.060 --> 02:57:06.500]  Speaking into existence
[02:57:06.500 --> 02:57:08.980]  Exactly. No, but I mean, I'm telling you stuff's getting crazy
[02:57:09.220 --> 02:57:13.860]  I got a few other clips on the play five minutes into overdrive them. I have the baton to david night, but other points
[02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:15.220]  Go ahead leon
[02:57:15.220 --> 02:57:18.580]  Well, I just think it'll be very interesting to see, you know over the next two weeks
[02:57:18.740 --> 02:57:23.300]  I appreciate how donald trump isn't allowing this health thing to derail him
[02:57:23.620 --> 02:57:28.500]  Because you know, they wanted to move they wanted to move on from that basket of deplorables comment quickly
[02:57:28.500 --> 02:57:32.660]  But you know, they were like the fainting that wasn't how we wanted, but do you think this is staged?
[02:57:32.980 --> 02:57:37.940]  I don't think it is. Oh, no way. Heck. No, there's kind of like jumping from one horrible landmine to the next exactly
[02:57:38.100 --> 02:57:40.900]  Let's change the subject. No way. No, not to that
[02:57:41.380 --> 02:57:45.060]  Yeah, no that this was definitely not staged. She was trying to get out of there as quickly as possible
[02:57:45.060 --> 02:57:47.540]  Does this portend to trump victory or do they assassinate trump?
[02:57:50.420 --> 02:57:55.860]  I don't know. I think he's got the high ground right now after her deplorable remarks the fact that if you go on twitter
[02:57:55.860 --> 02:58:02.260]  I'd say 90% of my followers have now changed her name to like deplorable chris or, you know, katelyn the deplorable like
[02:58:02.260 --> 02:58:04.260]  Can we get deplorable jones?
[02:58:06.260 --> 02:58:14.660]  Her entire deplorable campaign backfired so horribly and the internet the the millenials the the alt right
[02:58:14.740 --> 02:58:21.140]  Everyone's kind of waking up. Everyone wants to be deplorable. I'm deplorable. I'm happy to deplorable isn't deplorable than I want to be deplorable
[02:58:21.140 --> 02:58:27.460]  I'm happy to put a new serum bad person triple X the deplorable. Are you deplorable?
[02:58:28.340 --> 02:58:32.340]  No, actually, they're such evil people that we're deplorable to them not that we're on some high horse
[02:58:32.340 --> 02:58:36.660]  But we're not out to get anybody. We just want the truth. That's all we're looking for. We're not to screw anybody over
[02:58:36.820 --> 02:58:40.740]  We don't think they're the smartest guy in the world like hillary's, you know, men. You know, whatever his name is
[02:58:40.980 --> 02:58:46.100]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with the fourth hour. I'm alex jones in four wars dot com

[02:59:08.980 --> 02:59:10.820]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview
[02:59:10.820 --> 02:59:16.900]  I got my bottle of brain force right there and pop two of them and about 20 minutes later. It's like being everything just kind of
[02:59:17.300 --> 02:59:18.020]  clears up

[03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:28.100]  All right, my friends
[03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:31.940]  I want to just put in caps on this the hand of the thought of the great
[03:00:32.420 --> 03:00:33.620]  David night
[03:00:33.620 --> 03:00:35.620]  very historic time to be alive, but
[03:00:36.260 --> 03:00:40.660]  It's good to see their lives imploding. It's also really scary to have talking about spending elections
[03:00:40.660 --> 03:00:42.660]  I just say go ahead with it
[03:00:42.660 --> 03:00:46.980]  You know let them put in whatever little commie they want or whatever just let's get let's just get trump in there
[03:00:46.980 --> 03:00:49.700]  But if they're this corrupt, you know, we'll try to steal the election
[03:00:52.740 --> 03:00:54.740]  Recents hillary's alt-right speech
[03:00:55.300 --> 03:00:58.180]  It's been going down, but I mean it's taken a huge
[03:00:58.340 --> 03:01:00.340]  When she spoke the name you dare not speak
[03:01:00.820 --> 03:01:02.820]  We shall not
[03:01:03.220 --> 03:01:05.220]  The dark heart evil one
[03:01:05.460 --> 03:01:07.220]  Jones, uh
[03:01:07.220 --> 03:01:09.220]  Obama's the texas creature
[03:01:09.220 --> 03:01:11.220]  Oh
[03:01:11.940 --> 03:01:17.780]  It's turned twitter into this new battleground of the alt-right really just ripping into her all day every day
[03:01:18.500 --> 03:01:24.180]  You can't even go through the trending hashtags without seeing something that's anti hillary, you know hillary's health
[03:01:24.180 --> 03:01:27.620]  Where's hillary crooked hillary locker up hillary for prison?
[03:01:27.860 --> 03:01:30.820]  I mean everyone's seeing this and it's starting to open up people's eyes
[03:01:31.060 --> 03:01:36.740]  And people who might not be informed on as well as we are are seeing these hashtags clicking on it and watching these people
[03:01:36.740 --> 03:01:42.820]  Who are on there like paul joseph watson and stuff and really kind of learning and watching these videos and reading these articles
[03:01:42.820 --> 03:01:44.580]  I'm finding out how bad she is
[03:01:44.580 --> 03:01:50.980]  Right and that's that those are the hashtags that twitter allows to start trending because it's it's so interesting that even with
[03:01:51.380 --> 03:01:57.700]  All of the censorship on twitter google facebook all of the there are even that's really the key instagram page
[03:01:57.780 --> 03:02:01.380]  We're beating the ai suppression go ahead leon even with all the news
[03:02:01.380 --> 03:02:08.420]  Establishment outlets all the newspapers the internet at television everything even with all of that. They're still losing
[03:02:08.980 --> 03:02:13.140]  That's power. That's awesome. Well, you look at the mainstream reporters. They look like
[03:02:14.340 --> 03:02:18.020]  They've had their ass kicked. I mean they look freaked out. Yeah, because they know more than we do
[03:02:18.020 --> 03:02:20.740]  They're right next to hillary. She's probably falling over every 10 minutes
[03:02:21.220 --> 03:02:27.380]  I mean you see like we go cover like she's in a tent medical tent. They're all freaking out with ambulances and she comes out all coughing
[03:02:27.380 --> 03:02:33.140]  I mean imagine they know the truth this lady might be on the edge of death. What kind of it takes a special person
[03:02:34.260 --> 03:02:35.460]  to know
[03:02:35.460 --> 03:02:40.340]  That this kind of corruption is going on that this woman's health is really as bad as we've said it's been
[03:02:40.500 --> 03:02:43.940]  And they can sit there and bite their tongue and not say anything like how do you sleep at night?
[03:02:44.180 --> 03:02:48.500]  Yeah, because they they they have to elect her and that's where the whole never trump movement
[03:02:48.820 --> 03:02:53.700]  You know, they'll they would rather have someone like hillary clinton come in and destroy the country even further
[03:02:53.700 --> 03:02:57.780]  Um, because they're on some high horse. He wants coming in and take over the internet
[03:02:57.940 --> 03:03:01.860]  We have dhs and wants to run the election. I mean, this is completely and totally just
[03:03:02.420 --> 03:03:06.020]  After saying it's insane. The feds aren't involved in the election. I'm I'm insane. Yeah
[03:03:06.500 --> 03:03:10.820]  Yeah, it's another conspiracy but it shows how weak they are. I mean, we've got a big audience and
[03:03:11.300 --> 03:03:16.500]  Everything but they just respond to everything now. They're totally freaked out. Yeah, it's because they they're not getting real news
[03:03:16.580 --> 03:03:18.260]  I mean they get it from us
[03:03:18.260 --> 03:03:24.340]  Well, and I think too go going back to the whole kind of spiritual aspect of it. We are definitely moving out of the time
[03:03:24.420 --> 03:03:30.020]  Where darkness and fear and everything is so powerful and moving into a time of enlightenment where people are awakened
[03:03:30.260 --> 03:03:33.700]  Humanity is rising and so that's why we've seen them put their
[03:03:34.100 --> 03:03:40.420]  Plans and overdrive because they know there's just this limited window of time where they can and then their champion is the brain damage
[03:03:41.140 --> 03:03:42.980]  War criminal, right?
[03:03:42.980 --> 03:03:48.340]  But if I was like evil, I put my best people in you know, well, she didn't she didn't read the fine print on the contract

[03:05:20.820 --> 03:05:26.660]  The dmc insider told shuster that the combination of her campaign hiding hillary's pneumonia for the past three days from the media
[03:05:26.740 --> 03:05:33.540]  And the shocking footage of her fall in new york city represented quote unchartered political territory and another insider said powerful donors
[03:05:33.540 --> 03:05:38.820]  Now preparing for the worst if hillary has to drop out of the race the mainstream media is upset that hillary hit the pneumonia
[03:05:38.820 --> 03:05:40.660]  But of course that's not the only health issue

[03:05:47.620 --> 03:05:51.860]  The clints have this notion that they'd only need to go as far as they need to in terms of disclosure

[03:08:21.380 --> 03:08:23.380]  Who needs Hollywood?
[03:08:24.100 --> 03:08:26.100]  I want the real world, baby
[03:08:27.220 --> 03:08:30.020]  Hollywood's like a joke to me. I piss on it

[03:08:51.620 --> 03:08:53.620]  Let's go over some headlines and I'm gonna say
[03:08:55.220 --> 03:08:57.220]  Greetings to David Knight
[03:08:57.620 --> 03:08:59.620]  And punch out of here
[03:08:59.700 --> 03:09:01.700]  And move on to my other work today
[03:09:01.700 --> 03:09:08.180]  Antibiotic resistant bacteria seem to the first time that's up on info wars.com. The incredible film shows the evolution of bacteria
[03:09:08.500 --> 03:09:11.380]  As it changes to fight different strengths of antibiotics in the lab
[03:09:13.380 --> 03:09:18.180]  Farmer British PM David Cameron resigns as MP with immediate effect
[03:09:18.900 --> 03:09:24.260]  His legacy was ruined overnight when his gamble to keep Britain in the EU failed spectacularly
[03:09:24.580 --> 03:09:27.380]  Another globalist operation gets blown wide open
[03:09:28.500 --> 03:09:30.020]  continuing
[03:09:30.020 --> 03:09:33.620]  James Woolsey CIA director and Bill Clinton joins Trump campaign
[03:09:34.260 --> 03:09:38.500]  He claims he wants to fight the jihadis and stuff. I tell you this guy's pretty serious. That's one of the big problems
[03:09:38.500 --> 03:09:41.860]  I'll see what the trump operation, but the globalist against trump. This is a
[03:09:42.500 --> 03:09:47.540]  Move it's more seen as hawkish, but we'll see what unfolds with that. Woolsey is a piece of work
[03:09:48.100 --> 03:09:50.100]  And also is trying to start on the new
[03:09:51.140 --> 03:09:56.340]  Nosferatu film. I mean, let me tell you talk about central casting, but you should attack folks for how they look
[03:09:56.340 --> 03:09:58.340]  He's an interesting fellow though
[03:09:58.340 --> 03:10:01.380]  A lot better than the CIA folks. Obama's got him, but they didn't say much
[03:10:02.100 --> 03:10:05.460]  Facial recognition technology used in Chinese classroom
[03:10:05.940 --> 03:10:10.260]  To check boredom levels before you say that's a big police state of the London telegraph
[03:10:11.220 --> 03:10:16.660]  Six years ago in San Antonio, but the same stuff in the lunchrooms and schools with the pentagon running
[03:10:17.220 --> 03:10:21.780]  And again, I'm not against the pentagon in general or military, but I'm against this type of mad scientist stuff
[03:10:22.180 --> 03:10:24.180]  That is the true genie out of the bottle
[03:10:24.180 --> 03:10:31.540]  And pence says I like this. I'm pro-life, and I don't apologize for it. Let me be clear people who know me know well
[03:10:31.540 --> 03:10:34.340]  I'm pro-life, and I don't apologize for it. That's a positive
[03:10:34.980 --> 03:10:40.420]  On that front and everything Dr. Steve Petretta talked about a few weeks ago comes out tim kane hanging out with the marxist
[03:10:41.140 --> 03:10:42.340]  you name it
[03:10:42.340 --> 03:10:47.780]  Truly truly sickening meanwhile another kid Daniels report on info wards.com very newsworthy
[03:10:47.780 --> 03:10:53.540]  Report hillary wearing anti-sheesh your sunglasses. We've talked a lot about this, but it shows the actual brand
[03:10:54.020 --> 03:10:59.380]  Epileptics wearing them people having seizures wearing them. This is important man. You look at that pathetic photo of her
[03:11:00.340 --> 03:11:04.660]  At the 9-11 event she is I hate her and I don't like her. She's an evil person
[03:11:05.220 --> 03:11:08.500]  Who stood down at Benghazi and fast and furious and counts the crimes
[03:11:08.500 --> 03:11:13.860]  But it is really pathetic to see the wages of sin not that just being old or sick as bad
[03:11:13.860 --> 03:11:18.020]  We've that's all happened to families could happen to us is the great equalizer
[03:11:18.100 --> 03:11:20.100]  But then she's so arrogant
[03:11:20.100 --> 03:11:21.940]  And think she's invincible
[03:11:21.940 --> 03:11:28.500]  But reality is starting to come home to her and what does the mainstream media do now that they bet everything on saying
[03:11:28.820 --> 03:11:30.820]  She was incredibly healthy
[03:11:31.940 --> 03:11:36.420]  And now it's clear it's a cover-up. I think this is a real demarcation line when
[03:11:37.620 --> 03:11:43.620]  You can finally say the dinosaur media has fallen the last brachiosaurus has fallen into the dust to keep of history
[03:11:43.620 --> 03:11:49.060]  The the dust that covered the planet. I guess that they say kill the dinosaurs is finally have their effect on them
[03:11:49.060 --> 03:11:51.300]  I don't know day to night
[03:11:51.300 --> 03:11:54.420]  Can't can't wait to hear what you have to say about all this today
[03:11:55.220 --> 03:11:59.460]  But overall, uh, you know, I know you've probably been watching a lot of the last three hours listening to it
[03:11:59.620 --> 03:12:02.180]  They have a lot coming up but before you to what's coming up
[03:12:02.820 --> 03:12:08.260]  Do you disagree with me agree? How do you augment it? I mean is this getting too surreal even for you because
[03:12:08.660 --> 03:12:10.900]  I'm scratching my head or I'm poking myself with a pin
[03:12:10.900 --> 03:12:16.020]  Is this real because not only are they all stabbing themselves and shooting their own feet off
[03:12:16.740 --> 03:12:21.620]  We're right at the heart of exposing them. This is like twilight zone day of the night. Yeah, you know, alex
[03:12:22.580 --> 03:12:26.020]  I what you were saying just a few minutes ago, of course, we all get sick. We all get old
[03:12:26.580 --> 03:12:30.740]  There's various issues. We've had fdr who is in a wheelchair. We got greg abbott who's in a wheelchair
[03:12:31.140 --> 03:12:32.580]  I was worried that this might backfire
[03:12:32.580 --> 03:12:37.540]  But you know what really was the problem was that hillary clinton cannot help herself from lying
[03:12:37.540 --> 03:12:42.500]  And neither can the mainstream media. That is the most important thing to come out of here
[03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:47.140]  I think that's far more important than even her health condition. Of course her health condition is an issue
[03:12:47.220 --> 03:12:52.340]  I agree one who made an issue abbott more that he was in a wheelchair was honest and persevered
[03:12:52.420 --> 03:12:53.940]  That's right made us admire him
[03:12:53.940 --> 03:12:57.940]  It's the lying and telling us it's not happening. We're sick of that's right
[03:12:58.260 --> 03:13:03.940]  And even when she's got a more compelling narrative to tell she has compelled to tell us a lie
[03:13:03.940 --> 03:13:09.860]  Just like what happened in Benghazi remember in Benghazi? She continued with this absurd narrative
[03:13:09.940 --> 03:13:16.580]  Even after it was exposed and laughed at that the whole thing was a reaction to some obscure movie that nobody had seen on youtube
[03:13:16.740 --> 03:13:19.860]  That was laughable. Nobody would be offended by that. It was a joke
[03:13:20.340 --> 03:13:24.180]  And yet that was supposedly what had happened. She continues to lie
[03:13:24.580 --> 03:13:30.820]  Where she could tell the truth because that's the key thing about hillary clinton. She's a pathological liar. Yes, exactly
[03:13:30.820 --> 03:13:37.300]  She loves to deceive people even you know, we look at it as like is she really stupid or is she just
[03:13:38.020 --> 03:13:40.020]  Evil
[03:13:40.660 --> 03:13:45.700]  I'm not some perfect guy, but I love people learning the secrets. I love showing people how to do stuff
[03:13:45.940 --> 03:13:51.220]  I love them showing me. I but criminals they get off on conning people. She loves it
[03:13:51.540 --> 03:13:55.780]  Yeah, and when you look at what the media has done, okay, if we had not had
[03:13:55.780 --> 03:14:00.900]  Uh people on the sidewalks and of course, it's one of the key things we see as reporters and we go to things like the
[03:14:00.900 --> 03:14:05.940]  Bundy ranch standoff and we see what happens and we do a report and then we see how it's completely
[03:14:06.740 --> 03:14:13.380]  Changed by people who aren't there people who have an agenda and people can see what happened with hillary clinton at that event
[03:14:13.700 --> 03:14:20.820]  At trying to get into that car has she completely collapses and yet look at the way it was covered up by mainstream media by msnbc
[03:14:20.820 --> 03:14:26.980]  Showing little snippets there lying about the temperature. You can look at the temperature. I've got I snap shot at it that morning
[03:14:27.060 --> 03:14:27.940]  I thought
[03:14:27.940 --> 03:14:34.980]  Overheated give me a break in new york. I said yesterday. Alex, you know, uh, 78 degrees 40 humidity
[03:14:35.540 --> 03:14:39.540]  12 mile per hour winds. I said, that's what we call winter here in austin
[03:14:41.060 --> 03:14:47.940]  She better not come to texas walk in the park 78 79 degrees. That's awesome. Exactly. And if you look at it, okay
[03:14:47.940 --> 03:14:52.580]  There's nobody else that is passing out. There's nobody else that's wearing those glasses
[03:14:52.900 --> 03:14:59.700]  Those unique glasses those Zeiss z1 blue lenses. I cut a report earlier about that as well
[03:14:59.700 --> 03:15:04.340]  We put that up. Mike sernovich showed that and if you remember we had that picture
[03:15:04.660 --> 03:15:08.020]  Just a few days earlier on september the 8th. It was that picture of
[03:15:08.420 --> 03:15:13.780]  Hillary clinton setting in the plane and you could just see her and huma look like they're the only ones on the plane
[03:15:13.780 --> 03:15:17.460]  You could see them in the windows and she was again wearing those heavy
[03:15:18.500 --> 03:15:21.140]  Rembed glasses the fresnel lens glasses
[03:15:21.140 --> 03:15:29.220]  We've seen her now wearing two types of glasses that are prescribed for people who have brain injuries and are triggered into seizures by
[03:15:29.780 --> 03:15:34.580]  light by flashing light by stress by noise that type of thing but the the
[03:15:35.220 --> 03:15:40.900]  Those glasses are prescribed for people who are triggered by that if you look at everybody around her people in the audience
[03:15:40.900 --> 03:15:44.340]  All the politicians nobody else is wearing any sunglasses
[03:15:44.420 --> 03:15:50.020]  It's not that bright in new york in september that you have to wear sunglasses is not like texas again
[03:15:50.500 --> 03:15:54.580]  And so all of this is indicating that she really has a condition
[03:15:54.580 --> 03:16:00.260]  But what is really amazing is the way they spun this narrative lying about it throughout the day just as they did with
[03:16:00.340 --> 03:16:01.380]  Benghazi
[03:16:01.380 --> 03:16:07.620]  Saying that she was overheated then saying she's fine now then staging as you point out earlier staging the fact she would come out
[03:16:07.700 --> 03:16:10.260]  Talk to people. Hey, i'm doing fine having the little girl
[03:16:10.260 --> 03:16:15.300]  Uh sent through the crowd just as the pope did in washington dc when he had stage
[03:16:15.460 --> 03:16:18.100]  Yeah, just as a pope staged that event with a little kid
[03:16:18.580 --> 03:16:22.340]  Who had an immigration agenda and they made a big deal out of that
[03:16:22.500 --> 03:16:27.940]  You don't get through the cordons of secret service even the little kids don't it's totally staged and then we're
[03:16:28.340 --> 03:16:31.780]  Conspiracy theorists and we set it stage. I'm gonna hand the baton to you my friend great job
[03:16:31.780 --> 03:16:35.140]  Can't wait to sit here and watch this a lot more than on the news info wars.com

[03:17:12.500 --> 03:17:16.820]  Thank you for your support now back to day the night and the info wars news center in Austin, texas
[03:17:17.060 --> 03:17:20.820]  Thank you, alex and as I was saying I think the most important thing coming out of this
[03:17:21.380 --> 03:17:25.780]  Is to show that the mainstream media has been lying to us the clinton campaign has been lying to us
[03:17:25.780 --> 03:17:31.540]  And even when their call caught red-handed they continue to lie to us. That's the key thing
[03:17:31.940 --> 03:17:36.020]  We now have the advantage that we have reporters everywhere because everybody's got a cell phone
[03:17:36.260 --> 03:17:40.260]  Everybody's got social media. They can post this stuff. We can see what really happens
[03:17:40.340 --> 03:17:44.820]  They cannot control the meet the narrative and so what they're going to have to do is try to control the internet
[03:17:44.900 --> 03:17:47.860]  They're making moves towards that. We need to be very concerned about that
[03:17:47.860 --> 03:17:53.300]  I'm going to talk about this article that was up on the dredger board how the cops are using artificial intelligence
[03:17:53.300 --> 03:18:00.980]  To stop crimes before they happen. That's another aspect of this the pre-crime aspect that ties back into what we saw with jade helm
[03:18:01.380 --> 03:18:04.420]  Mastering the human domain. We're going to talk about what's behind that
[03:18:04.900 --> 03:18:07.380]  And I want to talk about trump's reaction to all of this
[03:18:08.020 --> 03:18:11.220]  Because so many times when things have happened in this campaign
[03:18:11.620 --> 03:18:14.020]  I believe trump has taken the wrong tack for example
[03:18:14.740 --> 03:18:21.860]  When he had the sharia con uh lawyer get on before hillary clinton the guy who has promoted sharia law, which is
[03:18:21.860 --> 03:18:28.100]  Fundamentally against the principles of this country against the constitution against what our military say they fight for
[03:18:28.580 --> 03:18:30.340]  You have this guy get on
[03:18:30.340 --> 03:18:32.340]  And promote a theocracy
[03:18:32.740 --> 03:18:38.900]  And the most intolerant and I would say deplorable theocracy this world has ever seen sharia law
[03:18:39.060 --> 03:18:40.500]  She chooses him
[03:18:40.500 --> 03:18:41.700]  on stage
[03:18:41.700 --> 03:18:43.060]  and yet
[03:18:43.060 --> 03:18:48.100]  When donald trump pushes back against that he does it in a way that doesn't call him out for being a sharia supporter
[03:18:48.100 --> 03:18:55.380]  When he pushes back against the lawyer of the judge who is I believe acting in an unreasonable way should be recusing himself
[03:18:56.020 --> 03:19:04.820]  From presiding over donald trump's case because this guy is part of a kuklux klan hispanic kuklux klan group la raza the race
[03:19:05.620 --> 03:19:10.500]  Everything for the race for those outside of the race. Nothing. That's their low. That's their slogan. Okay
[03:19:10.900 --> 03:19:12.580]  If that's your slogan
[03:19:12.580 --> 03:19:19.300]  You can't get any more racist than that and i'm sorry, but you don't get a pass on being a racist because you're hispanic
[03:19:19.300 --> 03:19:20.580]  Or because you're black
[03:19:20.580 --> 03:19:26.180]  We should be as much against races who are hispanic and black as we are against races who are white
[03:19:26.900 --> 03:19:32.340]  And that's the problem. That's one of the reasons why hillary clinton had to come up with this new term the basket of deplorables
[03:19:32.820 --> 03:19:37.300]  Because you know racist just isn't doing it anymore for her. That's the only thing she's got
[03:19:37.300 --> 03:19:42.900]  She's cried wolf so many times that unfortunately she has taken that away
[03:19:43.220 --> 03:19:50.980]  But on this particular case donald trump has focused on her deplorables comment and ignored commenting on her health
[03:19:51.300 --> 03:19:55.300]  That's a very wise thing to do. We're gonna unpack that. We're gonna see what her campaign is saying right now
[03:19:55.460 --> 03:20:00.420]  And we're gonna look at who might replace her. Who is the clean slate candidate they would bring up
[03:20:00.420 --> 03:20:11.140]  I'm nick sobolesky a select quote agent with a true story of how select quote goes to bat for you by in term life insurance
[03:20:11.940 --> 03:20:14.820]  A while back a man called me who had had prostate cancer
[03:20:15.540 --> 03:20:19.380]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him
[03:20:19.860 --> 03:20:21.940]  I said let me see well
[03:20:21.940 --> 03:20:27.460]  I took his pertinent information then shopped the highly rated price competitive companies we represent
[03:20:27.460 --> 03:20:32.340]  And found one who pre approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted

[03:22:01.060 --> 03:22:04.820]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego
[03:22:05.220 --> 03:22:11.140]  The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young books in head-to-head fitness tests

[03:24:13.460 --> 03:24:18.020]  Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight your host on this monday september 12th
[03:24:18.980 --> 03:24:20.980]  amazing weekend
[03:24:20.980 --> 03:24:24.260]  Very Clinton is heading down. It'll be interesting to see what the polls
[03:24:24.980 --> 03:24:27.220]  Show of course that we know they will manipulate the polls
[03:24:27.940 --> 03:24:29.940]  extensively, but nevertheless
[03:24:30.180 --> 03:24:34.340]  It'll be interesting to see what they're saying at this point. It has been very interesting
[03:24:34.980 --> 03:24:39.380]  To watch the media try to spin this stuff after everybody
[03:24:40.100 --> 03:24:42.820]  In america has essentially been eyewitnesses to the event
[03:24:43.300 --> 03:24:49.300]  They think they can lie to the people who saw it happen. We've seen her collapse from multiple angles
[03:24:49.300 --> 03:24:51.300]  We've seen the strange
[03:24:51.780 --> 03:24:53.780]  Look the strange sunglasses and oh by the way
[03:24:54.340 --> 03:24:55.780]  Interesting story
[03:24:55.780 --> 03:25:00.340]  There was a story up on drudge about factory in china that is replacing workers
[03:25:00.820 --> 03:25:06.180]  The workers demanded higher wages. They're being replaced by robots. We've talked about this for the longest time
[03:25:06.180 --> 03:25:08.180]  So this is what's going to happen
[03:25:08.340 --> 03:25:10.340]  To those workers who are
[03:25:10.660 --> 03:25:15.300]  Trying to get rich by raising the minimum wage that simply isn't going to happen
[03:25:15.300 --> 03:25:21.300]  And it isn't simply the people at the bottom of the economic scale or it's not just one industry
[03:25:21.300 --> 03:25:25.540]  This is going to be something that is going to be horizontal and vertical within our society
[03:25:25.780 --> 03:25:27.300]  It's going to affect all industries
[03:25:27.300 --> 03:25:31.300]  It's going to affect people at the lowest level to the highest level and we need to think about what we're going to do
[03:25:31.300 --> 03:25:33.060]  to get a handle on this
[03:25:33.060 --> 03:25:36.740]  The thing that's being offered to us is a universal income
[03:25:37.220 --> 03:25:43.060]  Which is essentially to put us all on the dole to pacify us to make us dependent on the government's one of the things
[03:25:43.060 --> 03:25:49.700]  I never liked about the flat tax the idea that we were all going to get a check every year from the government a rebate
[03:25:50.260 --> 03:25:54.420]  For sales taxes that we paid. I thought that is a very very bad idea
[03:25:54.420 --> 03:25:59.460]  You were training people to live off of the government to take their independence and so forth
[03:25:59.460 --> 03:26:01.460]  But let's take a look at this
[03:26:01.460 --> 03:26:04.340]  The story here because it's interesting beyond the fact
[03:26:04.900 --> 03:26:10.340]  That they're bringing in robots to replace the human workers to cut their wages a couple of things that are interesting about it
[03:26:10.340 --> 03:26:14.500]  The first one is we've been talking about Hillary Clinton's blue sunglasses
[03:26:15.140 --> 03:26:16.660]  Which look like
[03:26:16.660 --> 03:26:23.220]  Zeiss z1 blue lenses that are used to control reactions to bright light to sunlight for people who have brain damage
[03:26:23.460 --> 03:26:25.300]  And get seizures from that
[03:26:25.300 --> 03:26:30.900]  And the company that is doing this is the same company that makes those lenses Carl Zeiss vision technologies
[03:26:30.980 --> 03:26:39.380]  Now this is in guangzhou in china and they say that in 2012 is ice group informed us that labor in china was twice as expensive
[03:26:39.380 --> 03:26:41.380]  As it was in mexico
[03:26:41.540 --> 03:26:44.900]  Four times what it was in india. Isn't that interesting metric?
[03:26:46.020 --> 03:26:51.060]  That explains why we're having so many people come into this country from india and mexico
[03:26:51.620 --> 03:26:57.780]  Right because china china think about that you think about china getting slave wages and their wages are nothing
[03:26:58.340 --> 03:27:01.220]  To brag about they're far lower than our wages and yet
[03:27:01.220 --> 03:27:08.980]  The mexicans in general get half of what the chinese do the indians get half of what the mexicans do
[03:27:09.780 --> 03:27:16.340]  Isn't that amazing? That's why we're seeing so many visas being given to people coming from india. That's why you have disneyland
[03:27:17.220 --> 03:27:19.220]  having the american workers
[03:27:19.540 --> 03:27:22.340]  Of every kind you know white black hispanic
[03:27:23.060 --> 03:27:27.540]  American workers training indian workers coming in here on visas who are going to take their job
[03:27:27.540 --> 03:27:32.980]  So I think that's a very interesting metric. It's one of the things that we have to pay attention to
[03:27:33.780 --> 03:27:36.580]  And I think it's one of the reasons why if we are not going to see
[03:27:37.060 --> 03:27:38.900]  America and the west
[03:27:38.900 --> 03:27:44.420]  Be brought down to third world levels, which is what the multinational corporations want to do
[03:27:44.980 --> 03:27:47.860]  If we're going to keep that from happening, we have to get control of our borders
[03:27:48.420 --> 03:27:51.540]  And we have to change the way our countries are structured
[03:27:52.340 --> 03:27:54.340]  Understand that when we went to an income tax
[03:27:54.340 --> 03:28:00.740]  At the same time that we got the federal reserve what they did was they took off the taxes on goods that were coming into this country
[03:28:00.740 --> 03:28:02.260]  prior prior to that
[03:28:02.260 --> 03:28:07.140]  Our government was funded mostly with import taxes and it's one of the things that
[03:28:07.780 --> 03:28:11.060]  Thomas jefferson was very proud of he eliminated all internal taxing
[03:28:11.380 --> 03:28:17.220]  And he had a constitutional government that was completely funded by taxes on goods and services coming into the country
[03:28:17.540 --> 03:28:22.340]  We had a free trade zone a real free trade zone within america
[03:28:22.340 --> 03:28:29.220]  And we don't even have that today. You can't have insurance companies competing with each other over state lines
[03:28:29.220 --> 03:28:32.100]  How about that can't even compete with insurance companies?
[03:28:32.420 --> 03:28:39.300]  So we don't have free trade within the united states, but we have to open our borders to the cheapest goods the cheapest labor that is coming in
[03:28:40.100 --> 03:28:44.980]  I understand the arguments for free trade. I understand the arguments that government should not be manipulating our economy
[03:28:44.980 --> 03:28:49.300]  But you understand that what is happening is the alternative that we've been presented with
[03:28:49.300 --> 03:28:54.500]  Is that a small number of multinational corporations will be manipulating our economy?
[03:28:54.980 --> 03:29:01.780]  Okay, that's the reality. We can talk about the abstracts of free trade and so forth as the libertarians like to talk about it
[03:29:02.500 --> 03:29:06.580]  We can say that we're going to have free trade and and the government shouldn't be setting
[03:29:07.380 --> 03:29:12.020]  policy as to which industries or whatever going to be rewarded but understand that if they don't do it
[03:29:13.060 --> 03:29:17.700]  The alternative that is being offered to us by the multinationals is that an unelected
[03:29:17.700 --> 03:29:19.700]  Committee
[03:29:19.700 --> 03:29:27.140]  That is going to be created with these partnership agreements to trans specific the transatlantic partnership agreements those committees will decide
[03:29:27.540 --> 03:29:34.500]  Which industries which countries will be allowed to prosper and which ones will not will you be allowed to catch fish in your own ocean?
[03:29:34.500 --> 03:29:49.460]  Oh, it won't be your ocean. It will belong to the multinational corporations. Stay with us. We'll be right back
[03:29:50.580 --> 03:29:53.620]  We're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:54.500 --> 03:29:57.300]  Alex Jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:57.300 --> 03:30:06.020]  Could top democrats push for a suspension of the presidential election if hillary clinton drops out due to her health
[03:30:06.100 --> 03:30:13.700]  Would obama then attempt to stay in office to spike constitutional limits in august secret service sources told info wars that hillary's campaign
[03:30:13.700 --> 03:30:19.540]  Will be forced into making a big announcement soon regarding her medical condition that announcement came september 11th
[03:30:19.540 --> 03:30:26.660]  When her campaign blamed pneumonia for her nasty fall although this explanation is already under severe doubt given that the campaign initially lied by claiming
[03:30:26.660 --> 03:30:32.820]  Hillary had merely overheated before her collapse in new york overheated the temperature was in the low to mid 70s fahrenheit
[03:30:32.900 --> 03:30:39.300]  The secret service sources also told info wars that government vehicles that transport hillary to campaign events had to be fitted with
[03:30:39.380 --> 03:30:41.300]  Disabled access to her health now
[03:30:41.300 --> 03:30:46.900]  We see why in the video shot on september 11th showing secret service having to practically carry hillary into a vehicle
[03:30:46.980 --> 03:30:53.700]  Paul joseph watson reported that top dnc strategists are now holding a crisis meeting to discuss whether replace hillary with another candidate
[03:30:53.700 --> 03:30:59.460]  So will the establishment attempt to suspend the entire election to find out more visit info wars dot com

[03:33:22.260 --> 03:33:24.020]  Welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night
[03:33:24.020 --> 03:33:28.180]  We've got a lot of news to cover here. Trump says he wants to debate clinton without a moderator
[03:33:28.180 --> 03:33:35.060]  We've got politico making the case against james comey. They say comparing him to j. Edgar Hoover
[03:33:35.300 --> 03:33:40.260]  That's not a good thing especially the way they they write it. We're going to talk about those articles as well as pre-crime
[03:33:40.260 --> 03:33:44.820]  We're going to talk about who might be the clean slate candidate
[03:33:44.980 --> 03:33:50.580]  Do you really know who tim kane is? Do you really know who joe biden is we're going to talk about that in just a moment
[03:33:50.900 --> 03:33:56.340]  But before we do, you know when rachel madow came out and attacked us at info wars.com
[03:33:56.340 --> 03:33:58.340]  And she started
[03:33:58.900 --> 03:34:05.460]  She held up our products. We decided we would do the mr. Rachel madow special. Okay, and let me tell you one of the things
[03:34:05.460 --> 03:34:07.460]  I remember from phyllis schlafly
[03:34:08.020 --> 03:34:09.300]  was
[03:34:09.300 --> 03:34:10.820]  back in north carolina
[03:34:10.820 --> 03:34:12.820]  jesse helms was running for senate
[03:34:13.700 --> 03:34:18.660]  And some people on the left created some toilet paper with jesse helms's picture on it
[03:34:18.820 --> 03:34:23.620]  Okay, so that you could literally wipe your butt with jesse helms. I thought that was really funny and that was great
[03:34:23.620 --> 03:34:29.220]  So they were selling rolls of toilet paper with jesse helms's face on each individual sheet
[03:34:30.500 --> 03:34:32.500]  What phyllis schlafly did when she saw that
[03:34:33.220 --> 03:34:37.380]  Where she bought several she bought out all their rolls. Okay, and then she
[03:34:38.260 --> 03:34:42.740]  Went to another spot and started selling it a sheet at a time
[03:34:43.620 --> 03:34:45.620]  And she wound up selling
[03:34:46.020 --> 03:34:49.860]  A huge as donald trump would say a huge profit margin
[03:34:49.860 --> 03:34:56.020]  Over what she had bought this from from the people. Okay, so that's what we're doing with the mr. Rachel madow special
[03:34:56.020 --> 03:34:59.140]  Thank you, rachel for promoting our products. Thank you for being
[03:34:59.780 --> 03:35:03.620]  So transparently a liar about what was happening with hillary clinton's
[03:35:04.340 --> 03:35:05.380]  health care
[03:35:05.380 --> 03:35:09.300]  And her health condition. Thank you so much for doing that. Thank you so much mainstream media
[03:35:09.780 --> 03:35:15.940]  For doubling down on the lying narrative even after it's been exposed even after we've all seen the video you continue to line our face
[03:35:15.940 --> 03:35:20.260]  We've got andrew mitchell who is the wife of fed chairman allen greenspan
[03:35:20.740 --> 03:35:24.900]  Covering for the for the clinton's at every opportunity covering for the bushes as well
[03:35:25.220 --> 03:35:28.340]  And so in all of their honor in the spirit of phyllis schlafly
[03:35:28.900 --> 03:35:31.860]  selling the jesse helms t shirt
[03:35:32.580 --> 03:35:33.860]  sheets

[03:35:47.060 --> 03:35:50.420]  Okay, but it does have some very good positive effects
[03:35:50.420 --> 03:35:54.900]  You can read the reviews of real people who have actually used that but it won't do
[03:35:54.980 --> 03:36:00.980]  I think what rachel wants it to do for her 15 off super male vitality 15 off deep cleanse

[03:36:34.500 --> 03:36:36.500]  let's take a look at
[03:36:36.500 --> 03:36:38.500]  the deplorable comments
[03:36:39.540 --> 03:36:45.220]  You know one of the things I think that trump is doing very wisely now as I said earlier is he's chosen to focus on
[03:36:45.700 --> 03:36:47.700]  hillary's deplorable comments
[03:36:47.860 --> 03:36:53.220]  You know she called us deplorable, but what it really does is it shows hillary clinton as being deplorable?
[03:36:53.220 --> 03:36:56.420]  Here's what he said today. They say according to us a today
[03:36:56.420 --> 03:37:01.620]  He's been focusing more on hillary clinton's basket of deplorable remark than on her health care situation
[03:37:01.940 --> 03:37:04.820]  Trump said she divides people into baskets
[03:37:04.820 --> 03:37:08.100]  As though they were objects and not human beings
[03:37:09.060 --> 03:37:11.060]  That is spot on
[03:37:11.060 --> 03:37:12.420]  That is spot on
[03:37:12.420 --> 03:37:18.260]  He said hillary clinton spoke with hatred with derision for the people who make this country run
[03:37:19.220 --> 03:37:27.380]  He said clinton is an insider supported by powerful insiders attacking americans who have absolutely no political power
[03:37:28.100 --> 03:37:31.060]  That is a very important very powerful quote
[03:37:31.060 --> 03:37:35.380]  He really really nailed it and then he goes on and says she insulted all americans
[03:37:35.780 --> 03:37:41.540]  When she said that half of his supporters could be put in a basket of deplorables that includes those who are racist sexist
[03:37:42.100 --> 03:37:49.380]  Homophobic xenophobic islamophobic. You name it. Okay. She has to come up with a new term because they have cried wolf
[03:37:49.860 --> 03:37:52.340]  So many times because that's all they have folks
[03:37:52.980 --> 03:37:55.300]  She can't run on her accomplishments
[03:37:56.020 --> 03:37:57.780]  She can't run on her integrity
[03:37:57.780 --> 03:38:01.540]  Can you imagine trying to make a case that hillary has integrity?
[03:38:02.660 --> 03:38:06.660]  I mean you couldn't sell that. Okay, and you can't sell her accomplishments either
[03:38:07.540 --> 03:38:11.380]  And so what does she have but to attack viciously people
[03:38:11.700 --> 03:38:16.100]  But I want you to think about what she's doing here and there's a great article
[03:38:16.580 --> 03:38:20.900]  From the foundation for economic education. They took this on directly. You know, donald trump said
[03:38:20.900 --> 03:38:29.540]  Uh, you're treating these people as if they're objects not human beings. Okay, you're treating them with hatred with derision with bigotry
[03:38:30.420 --> 03:38:34.980]  And this is what the foundation for economic education. They said they said no one is deplorable
[03:38:35.620 --> 03:38:39.460]  No one is irredeemable. That was the other thing that she had to say
[03:38:40.420 --> 03:38:46.980]  And uh, they say seeing someone or some group of people as deplorable or irredeemable is a starting point for coercing them
[03:38:46.980 --> 03:38:53.300]  And that can lead to initiating violence against them. That's what we're concerned about when we see her hillary clinton doing this
[03:38:53.300 --> 03:38:57.940]  You know you assassinate people's character or a group of people's character and then you go after them
[03:38:58.500 --> 03:39:06.100]  Okay, that's what obama did isn't it with his bitter clingers comment those gun owners those bitter clingers are their guns and their bibles
[03:39:07.060 --> 03:39:09.060]  He hates this country. You know as a matter of fact
[03:39:10.020 --> 03:39:11.780]  it was obama
[03:39:11.780 --> 03:39:18.820]  Who on his recent trip to asia trashed america 18 times you've probably seen the articles about that
[03:39:19.620 --> 03:39:24.260]  I mean he hates all america. Okay, not just the people who are his political opponents
[03:39:24.420 --> 03:39:28.180]  He trashes all of america and think about you know the fortune cookie game
[03:39:28.180 --> 03:39:32.500]  We used to play remember when they used to when the fortune cookies used to really be fortune cookies instead of lectures
[03:39:33.220 --> 03:39:35.860]  Uh, that's all I get anymore when I get the fortune cookies
[03:39:35.860 --> 03:39:41.860]  We used to say such and such is going to happen to you and you would you know put a little phrase after it like you know in bed or something like that
[03:39:41.860 --> 03:39:43.860]  Is a joke. Okay. Well, let's think about
[03:39:44.900 --> 03:39:48.500]  What obama said about us as he was trashing america yet again
[03:39:49.140 --> 03:39:50.180]  in asia
[03:39:50.180 --> 03:39:55.700]  18 times so just read a couple of these i'm going to add after it each one of these after eight years of obama
[03:39:56.020 --> 03:40:00.340]  Okay, first thing he said there are still too many poor children in the united states
[03:40:00.980 --> 03:40:02.980]  after eight years of obama
[03:40:02.980 --> 03:40:05.620]  Too many children in america are not getting enough to eat
[03:40:06.260 --> 03:40:08.260]  after eight years of obama
[03:40:08.500 --> 03:40:14.980]  Despite america's wealth. We're not providing sufficient educational resources in poor communities after eight years of obama
[03:40:15.620 --> 03:40:20.980]  americans lack the potential political will to help poor inner cities that have suffered discrimination
[03:40:21.460 --> 03:40:23.460]  after eight years of obama
[03:40:23.940 --> 03:40:30.900]  america still has situations where women are not treated equally after eight years of obama see he thinks all of the us
[03:40:30.900 --> 03:40:36.100]  Is deplorable and lazy. That was one of his favorite phrase. I didn't read that any of those
[03:40:36.100 --> 03:40:40.500]  But let's go back to hillary clinton and this whole idea that people are deplorable
[03:40:41.140 --> 03:40:44.180]  as they said in the foundation for economic education article
[03:40:45.300 --> 03:40:48.420]  Think about for example how they have demonized all drug users
[03:40:49.140 --> 03:40:54.900]  And think that they should be incarcerated for nonviolent possession of narcotics whenever you see a fellow human as being
[03:40:55.460 --> 03:41:00.340]  Rather a thing or an it which is precisely what donald trump trump said he said you're treating them as
[03:41:00.340 --> 03:41:02.900]  Treating people as objects and not human beings. So
[03:41:03.540 --> 03:41:09.860]  What fee foundation for economic education saying, you know when you see a fellow human being as a thing or as an it
[03:41:10.260 --> 03:41:12.260]  It makes all the difference
[03:41:12.260 --> 03:41:14.900]  peter bregan in his book beyond conflict
[03:41:15.460 --> 03:41:21.940]  Said to say that people are beings is to invest them with sacred meaning with special and viable
[03:41:22.340 --> 03:41:23.460]  importance
[03:41:23.460 --> 03:41:30.020]  And he goes on to say to love humans to experience them as beings means recognizing their intrinsic worth
[03:41:30.580 --> 03:41:36.980]  Love as i'm defining it is therefore unconditional not contingent on anything particular about the individual who is loved
[03:41:37.060 --> 03:41:43.780]  But rather love reaches to the essence of the individual the beingness and sees their inherent value
[03:41:44.500 --> 03:41:51.140]  The value in each human is unearned because it is inherent. We all have inherent worth. No one is irredeemable
[03:41:51.140 --> 03:41:56.580]  Hillary Hillary and yet what did she do? She doubled down on the comments
[03:41:56.820 --> 03:42:01.860]  Okay, she came out and gave a non apology when she said express some regret on saturday
[03:42:02.500 --> 03:42:06.100]  For these comments that she made and you know where she made them interestingly enough, you know
[03:42:06.820 --> 03:42:13.940]  At the same time she's she's calling trump's supporters deplorable and irredeemable at an lgbt fundraiser
[03:42:14.740 --> 03:42:19.380]  Donald trump coincidentally didn't have it planned. It wasn't a reaction. He's talking about
[03:42:19.380 --> 03:42:24.580]  Freedom of religion freedom of choice. He's talking about how christians are being demonized
[03:42:24.660 --> 03:42:30.900]  He's talking to christians about how they're you're being demonized while she is doing it proving his point
[03:42:30.900 --> 03:42:33.540]  How's that for timing? Is that a god thing or what?
[03:42:34.420 --> 03:42:38.020]  I mean, we look at the situation of syris whether donald trump is a christ or not
[03:42:38.900 --> 03:42:40.900]  god can use non christians
[03:42:41.220 --> 03:42:44.660]  you go back to the old testament at one point god comes to a
[03:42:45.220 --> 03:42:47.220]  a a
[03:42:47.220 --> 03:42:49.220]  King syris who's not
[03:42:49.780 --> 03:42:54.820]  He's not part of israel, but he says i'm going to take you by the hand. I'm going to do something for israel, okay
[03:42:55.380 --> 03:42:59.220]  And maybe that's what's happening with trump. I don't know, but I tell you what when you look at the timing of this
[03:42:59.220 --> 03:43:01.780]  When you look at what happened this week at 9 11
[03:43:02.660 --> 03:43:09.780]  She has a 9 1 1 event and the whole the whole world is watching and sees what happens and sees the lies and the hypocrisy
[03:43:10.180 --> 03:43:13.460]  Of the mainstream media as she is demonizing people
[03:43:13.460 --> 03:43:17.620]  In a way that we know we know what obama did, you know, he called us bitter clingers
[03:43:17.620 --> 03:43:20.260]  He says i'm going to bankrupt coal. He did he bankrupted coal
[03:43:20.420 --> 03:43:24.740]  He says i don't like these people with uh their their guns and their bibles, okay
[03:43:25.380 --> 03:43:30.500]  And he comes after the conservatives using the irs doing it openly doing it with impunity
[03:43:30.980 --> 03:43:33.700]  That kind of corruption and you know that hillary clinton
[03:43:34.180 --> 03:43:39.300]  As bigoted as hateful as macchiavellian as she is when she talks about this
[03:43:39.300 --> 03:43:44.020]  You know that she's going to come after people and I would say the other democrats as well because it's not just her
[03:43:44.100 --> 03:43:46.660]  She came back and she said, you know, I was wrong. I shouldn't have said half
[03:43:47.940 --> 03:43:51.220]  And her supporters picked up on that. I think
[03:43:51.940 --> 03:43:53.780]  She really met all
[03:43:53.780 --> 03:43:55.780]  When she came back, I think that was a non-apology
[03:43:56.580 --> 03:43:57.940]  And her supporters
[03:43:57.940 --> 03:44:03.140]  James kerchick in the daily news says how many of donald trump supporters belong in a basket of deplorables?
[03:44:03.220 --> 03:44:05.140]  Well, almost all of them
[03:44:05.140 --> 03:44:10.980]  She was right to do so. He said it's not 50 percent of trump supporters are bigots. It's closer to 100 percent
[03:44:11.540 --> 03:44:17.700]  Then we see the same thing from slate to half of trump's supporters really belong in a basket of deplorables
[03:44:18.020 --> 03:44:24.980]  Yes, says jamil buoy. He's the political correspondent for slate and of course who played the clip earlier
[03:44:25.540 --> 03:44:30.580]  Of the other woman who said the same thing. There's all of the liberal media who is lying for hillary now
[03:44:30.580 --> 03:44:37.860]  About the health issues lied for her before covered for her before never wanted to ask her questions never criticized her for going
[03:44:37.860 --> 03:44:43.140]  What is it now 282 days since she's had a real press conference this stuff that you know
[03:44:43.140 --> 03:44:48.500]  Rolling oranges to her on the plane or having a some timid sick offense on the plane in the back
[03:44:48.740 --> 03:44:53.140]  That doesn't count as a press conference. Sorry. She hasn't had a press conference this entire
[03:44:53.140 --> 03:44:59.940]  Presidential campaign and as she's not even able physically to have her fundraising events. They're saying and this is a string of
[03:45:00.980 --> 03:45:08.340]  Tweets that were put out from the media from the hillary clinton campaign by Reuters. You got andria mitchell covering for her again
[03:45:08.340 --> 03:45:11.700]  We will be releasing additional medical information about hillary over the next few days
[03:45:11.700 --> 03:45:18.740]  I bet they will or maybe they won't hillary clinton cancelling planned fundraising events. This is says
[03:45:18.740 --> 03:45:25.300]  Uh, and they also come out andria mitchell who is I guess she is now the hillary clinton campaign spokesperson
[03:45:25.300 --> 03:45:31.620]  She's so tight so close to these people inside. She says they say there's no other undisclosed conditions
[03:45:31.620 --> 03:45:35.620]  Pneumonia is the extent of it. Uh-huh. Yeah, you know the daily news
[03:45:36.260 --> 03:45:42.020]  So that clinton's cover story for her pneumonia diagnosis further proves that her first instinct is to lie
[03:45:42.580 --> 03:45:45.620]  And as I said earlier, it's the same pattern we saw with Benghazi
[03:45:45.620 --> 03:45:48.740]  The fact that they would change the story multiple times
[03:45:49.460 --> 03:45:54.740]  And and do it shamelessly. Okay first. Uh, she's overheated now. She's fine now
[03:45:54.740 --> 03:45:56.740]  She's coming out and now she's got pneumonia
[03:45:56.900 --> 03:46:01.620]  But oh and now she can't do anything for the rest of week after she came out and said she was fine
[03:46:02.020 --> 03:46:02.980]  okay
[03:46:02.980 --> 03:46:07.060]  If she's got pneumonia folks and of course they're now saying that her campaign
[03:46:07.860 --> 03:46:12.340]  Manager robbie mook has pneumonia as well because I guess he won't be able to talk to anybody
[03:46:12.340 --> 03:46:18.020]  Yes, conveniently came down with pneumonia. Did you hear any congestion when she spoke?
[03:46:18.500 --> 03:46:23.060]  No, no dirt. She's sound horse or anything. Did she show any outward signs of that? No, no
[03:46:23.860 --> 03:46:25.860]  Uh, and then they double down they say
[03:46:27.220 --> 03:46:34.740]  That uh, well, we think we could have handled the medical episode a little bit better. All right, let's talk about who might replace her
[03:46:34.740 --> 03:46:41.380]  We've got cokey roberts saying this morning on mpr morning edition. People are angry at the lack of transparency
[03:46:43.220 --> 03:46:45.860]  There's never been any transparency with hillary clinton
[03:46:46.500 --> 03:46:50.820]  The only thing transparent about her was her glass when you saw her spit those wads in it the other day
[03:46:50.820 --> 03:46:55.380]  And of course that's going to end now. We're not going to have any more transparent even glasses around hillard clinton
[03:46:55.380 --> 03:46:57.300]  I guess it'll be a condition just like you know
[03:46:57.300 --> 03:47:01.460]  You got to have multiple pillows stacked up around her and all the other uh things that you have to have to
[03:47:01.460 --> 03:47:04.820]  Prop her up in the chairs and as you're going to have to have opaque cups and glasses
[03:47:05.060 --> 03:47:07.700]  But cokey robert said people are angry at the lack of transparency
[03:47:07.700 --> 03:47:10.420]  It was hours before the pneumonia diagnosis was revealed
[03:47:10.820 --> 03:47:18.020]  After seeing this incredibly damaging video of her being helped and stumbling into a van and now they are lying about the consequences of that
[03:47:18.100 --> 03:47:21.940]  In addition, okay, they're still saying it didn't happen. Didn't happen didn't happen
[03:47:22.100 --> 03:47:28.420]  Okay, but who would who would replace her? Well, of course the obvious replacement is senator tem cane
[03:47:28.420 --> 03:47:31.700]  And the hill talked about his radical roots
[03:47:32.340 --> 03:47:35.860]  Joe big's touched on it earlier when he talked about liberation theology
[03:47:35.860 --> 03:47:38.900]  This is something that the Jesuits and central and south america
[03:47:39.540 --> 03:47:43.300]  Pushed quite a bit especially back in the 1980s. We had the previous pope
[03:47:44.100 --> 03:47:47.860]  Pushed back against liberation theology said it is that odds with the church
[03:47:48.500 --> 03:47:54.340]  Uh, we don't want anything to do with it and yet this particular pope that we have now comes out of those roots
[03:47:54.980 --> 03:47:56.980]  this pope that we have now
[03:47:56.980 --> 03:48:04.500]  Is friendly to liberation theology to the environmentalism and the socialism and the globalism that it pushes
[03:48:04.820 --> 03:48:07.860]  He is also a Jesuit. He is also like tem cane
[03:48:08.580 --> 03:48:15.780]  And this article from the hill by ken blackwell says tem cane took a life transforming mission trip to latin america 1980
[03:48:15.780 --> 03:48:20.340]  Remember he talked about that. He said hey, that's how where I learned to speak spanish, you know, I was a missionary
[03:48:20.740 --> 03:48:24.740]  Okay, what did he do as a missionary? Was he really there trying to
[03:48:24.740 --> 03:48:27.860]  Tell people about jesus. No, he was pushing
[03:48:28.580 --> 03:48:32.580]  Marxism as ken blackwell points out. He says whatever canes intention
[03:48:32.980 --> 03:48:38.260]  He more likely met carl marx than jesus christ while he was in latin america
[03:48:38.580 --> 03:48:44.660]  He embraced liberation theology. It was a radical marxist based ideology at odds with the church the pope at the time
[03:48:45.140 --> 03:48:46.340]  and the us
[03:48:46.340 --> 03:48:49.060]  But it was supportive of and supported by
[03:48:49.860 --> 03:48:51.860]  The soviet union. Oh
[03:48:51.860 --> 03:48:56.740]  Oh when they see russians everywhere, right? And yet they're the socialists
[03:48:57.460 --> 03:49:03.700]  Okay, understand how that works. It's like the you know blue and red colors that they put everybody on okay
[03:49:03.700 --> 03:49:05.700]  That's uh, they always do just the opposite
[03:49:06.100 --> 03:49:09.060]  He goes on to say journalistic and academic research has now shown
[03:49:09.540 --> 03:49:15.940]  That liberation theology itself was quite possibly a product of a kremlin disinformation campaign designed to undermine the church
[03:49:15.940 --> 03:49:23.460]  And to bring catholic countries into the soviet sphere the top-ranking soviet block defector the cold war general
[03:49:23.700 --> 03:49:29.860]  And i'm not sure if i'm pronouncing this correctly ian. Pasepa admits that he was personally involved in the operation
[03:49:30.740 --> 03:49:32.740]  Okay, in 2005
[03:49:33.300 --> 03:49:36.340]  Hope frances discussed liberation theology
[03:49:36.900 --> 03:49:44.260]  He said after the collapse of real socialism these currents of thoughts were plunged into confusion and capable of either radical reformulation or new
[03:49:44.260 --> 03:49:51.460]  Creativity they survived by inertia. Okay now what happened with tim kane specifically that i think is very interesting
[03:49:52.420 --> 03:49:54.420]  he went to nicaragua
[03:49:55.140 --> 03:49:56.020]  and
[03:49:56.020 --> 03:49:57.620]  Things were getting so bad
[03:49:57.620 --> 03:50:02.740]  In honduras that they expelled the jesuits and this fellow asked in the article
[03:50:02.740 --> 03:50:05.140]  He says just how hardcore were the jesuit teachers?
[03:50:05.700 --> 03:50:11.540]  That tim kane was under he says well around the time kane was there jesuits were arrested for gun running gun running
[03:50:11.540 --> 03:50:17.380]  Oh remember this because i'm going to come back to gun running tim kane the next year the honduran government banned
[03:50:17.460 --> 03:50:20.900]  Anymore american jesuits from coming to that country because of their left-wing activism
[03:50:21.140 --> 03:50:26.660]  They also expelled one particular american born jesuit a priest named father jim carney
[03:50:27.220 --> 03:50:28.500]  From new york
[03:50:28.500 --> 03:50:33.380]  Okay, i'm sorry. He was from the new york times tells us that kane sought him out across the border
[03:50:33.860 --> 03:50:38.500]  To nicaragua that was supported by the soviet union in 1983
[03:50:38.500 --> 03:50:45.140]  This former priest jim carney was part of a 96 man unit that invaded honduras to bring the nicaraguan
[03:50:45.540 --> 03:50:50.100]  communist revolution there too after a fire fight. He was killed. This was the man
[03:50:50.900 --> 03:50:55.620]  That kane was looking for this violent marxist revolutionary
[03:50:56.580 --> 03:51:02.420]  Jesuit libertarian theology guy who what is the key thing about kane?
[03:51:02.420 --> 03:51:08.500]  Are you or someone you know suffer from chest pain blood pressure cholesterol or irregular heartbeat?

[03:54:21.300 --> 03:54:22.660]  Hillary Clinton

[03:54:26.580 --> 03:54:31.220]  It was very elderly. He needs to be looked at very carefully before I go back to him though

[03:55:17.700 --> 03:55:21.220]  Okay, here's a guy who was I was talking about
[03:55:21.940 --> 03:55:24.740]  At the time he was there. You had these radical
[03:55:25.620 --> 03:55:27.940]  communists Catholic Jesuit priests
[03:55:28.820 --> 03:55:32.260]  Who are pushing something that had absolutely no nothing to do with?
[03:55:32.980 --> 03:55:36.820]  With Catholicism it was something that was being pushed as a former
[03:55:37.540 --> 03:55:38.820]  Soviet
[03:55:38.820 --> 03:55:46.820]  defectors said this is a way of turning South America to the Soviet Union at the time they were fomenting revolution in Nicaragua
[03:55:46.820 --> 03:55:50.660]  A guy Jim Carney who was a former priest left became an armed revolutionary
[03:55:51.220 --> 03:55:54.420]  96 man unit goes into Honduras invades it
[03:55:54.820 --> 03:55:58.260]  He is killed as part of that firefight and yet this is the guy
[03:55:58.740 --> 03:56:05.300]  This is the guy that Jim Kaine was looking for said he went to look for now. What did he do after he became?
[03:56:06.100 --> 03:56:08.100]  governor, what is he known for?
[03:56:08.900 --> 03:56:13.700]  Surprisingly gun control gun control this guy is new american reports
[03:56:13.700 --> 03:56:16.900]  So Hilary's running mate Kaine is a staunch anti-gunner
[03:56:17.380 --> 03:56:20.660]  And why would that be surprising these people who want to confiscate our guns?
[03:56:20.660 --> 03:56:24.660]  Why do they do they create fast and furious in order to demonize the second amendment?
[03:56:25.540 --> 03:56:30.580]  They create a massive arms bizarre in Benghazi for ISIS they arm ISIS
[03:56:31.220 --> 03:56:35.140]  And they want to take your weapons away from you, right? What did he do in virginia?
[03:56:35.700 --> 03:56:42.180]  New american reports new virginia's junior senator senator tim kaine first earned public notoriety for his anti-gun ideology
[03:56:42.180 --> 03:56:44.660]  in 2000 when as mayor of richman
[03:56:45.140 --> 03:56:52.660]  He spent $7,000 of city funds to ship eight bus loads of anti-gun supporters to washington dc to support the so-called
[03:56:53.060 --> 03:56:59.060]  Million mom march. Yeah, he's one of the primary original backers of the million mom march
[03:56:59.780 --> 03:57:04.260]  The outcry in richman where he was mayor at the time was so vociferous
[03:57:04.740 --> 03:57:08.260]  That he was forced to ask for private donations to repay the theft
[03:57:08.260 --> 03:57:14.420]  Okay, this is the hypocrisy of these people. Okay, as her running mate just this last june
[03:57:14.660 --> 03:57:18.980]  They say kaine was at it again. He announced his support in the senate for efforts to allow the federal
[03:57:19.620 --> 03:57:24.500]  CDC senator for disease control to use taxpayer funds to advocate for gun control
[03:57:25.380 --> 03:57:30.420]  So he's using the CDC to advocate for gun control now in june 2016
[03:57:31.220 --> 03:57:35.300]  This guy wants to take your guns. He is a marxist
[03:57:35.300 --> 03:57:37.300]  He's a marxist
[03:57:38.660 --> 03:57:44.260]  Who else though? Okay, it might also be joe biden. They want to have somebody with a clean slate understand that hillary clinton
[03:57:44.820 --> 03:57:49.940]  Has been hammered. She has a long long history. She had a lot of mud and dirt on her from what she had done
[03:57:50.340 --> 03:57:52.340]  People knew that that's been resurrected
[03:57:52.340 --> 03:57:56.660]  But donald trump in a very short time with a very crowded field has had the same thing happen to him
[03:57:56.660 --> 03:57:58.900]  They want to get her out
[03:57:59.620 --> 03:58:04.660]  And it'll be very difficult I think for donald trump to run against a joe biden or against a
[03:58:04.660 --> 03:58:08.260]  Tim kaine that people don't know anything about let me tell you real quickly about at a time
[03:58:08.900 --> 03:58:15.380]  My recollection of joe biden first time I heard him was for attacking clarence thomas and the confirmation hearings for having
[03:58:15.460 --> 03:58:20.260]  The audacity to believe in the concept of natural rights that we as human beings
[03:58:20.820 --> 03:58:24.340]  Possess these rights. They're not granted by government. That's the essence of america
[03:58:24.500 --> 03:58:29.140]  The essence of the declaration of independence joe biden hates that idea
[03:58:29.140 --> 03:58:35.140]  Join us tonight for the info wars nightly news 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern
