[02:01.560 --> 02:05.280]  find that old TV ad from 20-something years ago but does John had he has
[02:05.280 --> 02:14.040]  slammed John Gruber's boner he shouldn't be the speaker John boner Gruber

[08:48.440 --> 08:53.240]  aired with no disclosure that they were produced by the government
[08:53.240 --> 08:57.560]  what difference at this point doesn't make when a competent observer looks for

[11:34.880 --> 11:38.560]  album and a new tour that's starting coming up in the third hour
[11:38.560 --> 11:44.720]  professor Daryl Hamamoto who of course is exposed the Democrats admitted plan

[11:58.960 --> 12:04.640]  unfolding as well that's what we have lined up on this live Friday Worldwide
[12:04.640 --> 12:12.360]  Edition that said wow there is so much to get to first off some really positive
[12:12.360 --> 12:19.120]  news this is a bellwether right here Fox News has been basically defending
[12:19.120 --> 12:23.320]  John Boehner and Mitch McConnell every time I tune into it I monitor it here we
[12:23.320 --> 12:27.480]  have it on in the coffee room we have it on in the studio we have CNN on in the
[12:27.480 --> 12:33.440]  coffee room MSNBCs back in the newsroom and then we've monitored drudge and a
[12:33.440 --> 12:37.440]  bunch of other alternative media and new media real media but wide-spectrum
[12:37.440 --> 12:42.240]  media is really the unfiltered media wide-open media Wild Wild West media
[12:42.240 --> 12:45.680]  whatever you want to call it we've got TV screens up everywhere just monitoring
[12:45.680 --> 12:50.520]  things but I am not just seeing Sean Hannity we have a clip of this will
[12:50.520 --> 12:56.720]  play a moment I'm seeing basically most of the Fox News crew turning on the
[12:56.720 --> 12:59.320]  Republican blue blood establishment because they know which way the wind
[12:59.320 --> 13:04.840]  blows after propping it up for a decade plus and saying you need to be removed
[13:04.840 --> 13:08.640]  from office you need to be removed from a speakership if you don't repeal
[13:08.640 --> 13:14.400]  Obamacare whole hog and if you don't block Obama on executive act shown open
[13:14.400 --> 13:18.440]  borders because there will not be a country anymore the presidency will be a
[13:18.440 --> 13:23.240]  dictatorship and I said this three weeks ago when crowd hammer not once but
[13:23.240 --> 13:28.000]  twice said Obama's becoming a dictator he's got to be impeached crowd hammer
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.400]  is really smart and is a conservative intellectual he doesn't just throw out
[13:32.400 --> 13:37.000]  buzzwords all day like a Hannity does I don't agree with some of the stuff
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.920]  crowd hammer pushes sometimes but he's light years better than a Sean Hannity
[13:41.920 --> 13:48.600]  or you know these these mainline Rhino Republican talk show host that just
[13:48.600 --> 13:54.560]  support the police state the drug war the giant prisons no matter what police
[13:54.560 --> 13:59.280]  brutality no matter what we try to look at both sides and actually be fair not
[13:59.280 --> 14:03.040]  just party line you know big government's good as long as it's
[14:03.040 --> 14:08.360]  conservative run no it's not we're constitutional republic not a Republican
[14:08.360 --> 14:12.560]  Republican again the term Republicans come from people that supported the
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.840]  Republic so a lot of Republicans like my show because they're actually do
[14:16.840 --> 14:22.760]  support the Republic but there's not much Republican in the big our Republican
[14:22.760 --> 14:28.160]  party anymore because they're really the little are not the big real are that is
[14:28.160 --> 14:33.400]  this country that's a tongue twister but it's prima facie evidence of reality
[14:33.400 --> 14:39.160]  now if you pull back from all this and you look at Sean Hannity and all these
[14:39.160 --> 14:43.960]  others coming out and saying he shouldn't be the speaker close quote this is a
[14:43.960 --> 14:48.760]  real telegraph message to the establishment Rockefeller style
[14:48.760 --> 14:53.760]  Republicans that basically are the same as the Democratic Party they just give
[14:53.760 --> 14:58.800]  better lip service to pacify the libertarian constitutional conservative
[14:58.800 --> 15:02.920]  base that is really the majority in this country if you want to take the
[15:02.920 --> 15:06.200]  country over you've got to have loyal opposition that always drops the ball
[15:06.200 --> 15:13.600]  always goes along with it always discredits any real opposition but now
[15:13.600 --> 15:17.400]  you have a political realignment depending on which historian you listen
[15:17.400 --> 15:24.680]  to this could be the biggest sweep against the Democrats since the 1820s or
[15:24.680 --> 15:31.240]  respectively the 1920s you notice it goes in cycles cycles are well documented
[15:31.240 --> 15:35.920]  well here we are coming up and because things are accelerated it isn't the
[15:35.920 --> 15:42.680]  20s this time it's 2014 because things are accelerating in cycles now it's a
[15:42.680 --> 15:46.680]  few years early and you're going to start seeing what would happen in 100
[15:46.680 --> 15:52.160]  years happen in 10 years and what would happen in 10 years happen in one year
[15:52.160 --> 15:56.160]  and what happened in one year happened in a month and then a day and then an
[15:56.160 --> 16:03.640]  hour and boy the world is going to be wild wild west then and there's nothing
[16:03.640 --> 16:07.120]  centralized systems can do to stop it in fact everything they're doing is
[16:07.120 --> 16:12.960]  exacerbating the chaos once all this stuff comes into fruition because
[16:12.960 --> 16:17.440]  they're trying to use chaos to manage humanity when all they're actually doing
[16:17.440 --> 16:22.200]  is not creating a group collective discussion about where humanity wants
[16:22.200 --> 16:25.960]  to go by trying to keep people in the dark they're ensuring the general
[16:25.960 --> 16:30.720]  population isn't ready to deal with the singularity and the major changes that
[16:30.720 --> 16:36.240]  are coming and what's been shown as every sociological research long-term
[16:36.240 --> 16:42.320]  study out there is elites cannot isolate themselves no matter how much they
[16:42.320 --> 16:57.160]  try from what's going on in the general population culturally spiritually economically you
[16:57.160 --> 17:02.920]  cannot cut off what's going on in the mass and expect to be insulated from
[17:02.920 --> 17:08.000]  that but this establishment has decided it can be insulated and believes that
[17:08.000 --> 17:13.240]  technology deployed will be able to suppress the population in the world
[17:13.240 --> 17:17.920]  when instead it's going to have the opposite effect but also cause major
[17:17.920 --> 17:24.080]  level collapses within the system historical research and evidence shows
[17:24.080 --> 17:30.480]  that potentially could destroy life on this planet so that's what we're going
[17:30.480 --> 17:34.840]  with that information today also we've got another report up on info wars calm
[17:34.840 --> 17:38.640]  the media is focusing on the wrong Senate torture report we're gonna talk
[17:38.640 --> 17:43.280]  about that drudge report calm is linked to Paul Watson's article I've been
[17:43.280 --> 17:47.080]  trying to get a hold of Watson all morning he's missing in action he's over
[17:47.080 --> 17:50.120]  in London sure he's doing something important I'd like to get him to pop in
[17:50.120 --> 17:54.240]  and talk about his report he's having dinner with his folks they're visiting
[17:54.240 --> 17:57.160]  okay well that's all he's allowed to do that I guess it is Christmas time
[17:57.160 --> 18:02.520]  Congress I'm kind of like Scrooge with Watson Cratchit stay in the office
[18:02.520 --> 18:09.960]  Congress passes Bill which grants unlimited access to communications of
[18:09.960 --> 18:16.280]  every American and by the way that's not his quote that's from Congressman
[18:16.280 --> 18:21.240]  Justin Amash and others we're gonna look at the Intelligence Authorization Act
[18:21.240 --> 18:26.160]  official year 2015 that has now passed the House so they're just legalizing
[18:26.160 --> 18:32.440]  beyond East Germany beyond 1984 beyond Cuba beyond North Korea beyond anything
[18:32.440 --> 18:37.680]  anyone's ever imagined their answer is to certify it see that's the bad
[18:37.680 --> 18:42.480]  Republican Party right there not the one that Ron Paul or Rand Paul or Justin

[24:27.640 --> 24:33.680]  spending I like it
[24:33.680 --> 24:38.640]  simply amazing they passed the big spending bill they are ramming through a
[24:38.640 --> 24:45.440]  bunch of other legislation right now I laugh but only because it makes me fear
[24:45.440 --> 24:49.160]  for the future of this country so badly as the establishment attempts to fully
[24:49.160 --> 24:53.600]  bankrupt us and complete our journey into financial serfdom to these frauds
[24:53.600 --> 25:03.960]  and on top of that the Congress has passed the bill in the house that puts
[25:03.960 --> 25:11.080]  the American people on the hook for all of the derivatives in the future bigger
[25:11.080 --> 25:16.400]  than the banker bailout of 2008 house passes government funding bill with
[25:16.400 --> 25:20.720]  bankster derivatives bailout provision preparation for the next bankster bailout
[25:20.720 --> 25:25.160]  this time they'll already have the law in place and they think the bill will pass
[25:25.160 --> 25:29.200]  the Senate so you have a major political realignment the country totally upset
[25:29.200 --> 25:32.640]  Democrats waking up to the Democrats being scamsters and that Obamacare is a
[25:32.640 --> 25:36.720]  fraud and the Republican leadership won't repeal it won't stop Obama on
[25:36.720 --> 25:45.440]  executive amnesty and just pass this biggest spending bill ever and even the
[25:45.440 --> 25:52.400]  first lady's lunch program was funded of course that's all UNESCO that's all UN
[25:52.400 --> 25:55.800]  treaties that we haven't even signed on to but that our government says we're
[25:55.800 --> 26:00.720]  under GOP rep house leaders made false promises to get my crucial vote
[26:00.720 --> 26:06.720]  representative Marlon Stutzemann if I pronounce that right of Indiana accused
[26:06.720 --> 26:11.760]  House Republican leadership of reneging on a deal made with him to get his
[26:11.760 --> 26:17.200]  support on the crucial procedural vote that almost killed the 1.1 trillion
[26:17.200 --> 26:25.540]  cromnibus funding bill cromnibus who comes up with this stuff they put
[26:25.540 --> 26:30.840]  crampus and omnibus together crampus and omnibus yeah this is out of control
[26:30.840 --> 26:36.600]  let's go to Sean Hannity talking about Joe Boehner who needs to step down as
[26:36.600 --> 26:45.360]  the speaker and again when you have first crowd hammer saying that and well
[26:45.360 --> 26:48.840]  saying Obama needed to be impeached and things I knew that would force the rest
[26:48.840 --> 26:55.720]  of them to start telling the truth because the constituents the viewers the
[26:55.720 --> 27:00.360]  sponsors everyone is hopping mad and folks keep the pressure going we're not
[27:00.360 --> 27:03.520]  going to sit around for six months a year two years before we wake up at this
[27:03.520 --> 27:08.720]  round of people screwing us over or that Republican leaders are writing heard
[27:08.720 --> 27:12.640]  over the new folks that have come in the junior house and Senate members we're
[27:12.640 --> 27:16.640]  going to put their feet to the fire day one and we are and this is good news
[27:16.640 --> 27:22.880]  it's bad news that meet the new boss same as the old boss as the who says but
[27:22.880 --> 27:26.320]  it's good news people aren't getting fooled they are hopping mad let's go to
[27:26.320 --> 27:31.960]  Sean Hannity John Gruber Boehner two days after the midterm election talking
[27:31.960 --> 27:35.640]  tough on the issue of amnesty but unfortunately that's all it was because
[27:35.640 --> 27:38.680]  today it's conservatives who feel like they've been burned as the speaker
[27:38.680 --> 27:42.560]  aligned himself with the president with Harry Reid Steny Hoyer and Joe Biden to
[27:42.560 --> 27:46.520]  pass a spending bill just a short time ago here with reaction national views
[27:46.520 --> 27:52.720]  Rich Lowry from the Tea Party News Network Scotty Hughes John Boehner
[27:52.720 --> 27:58.000]  Grubered conservatives tonight and by that I mean the conservative base in
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.400]  particular and Michelle Bachman hit the nail on the head he never would have
[28:02.400 --> 28:07.560]  done this before the election he has no inspiring vision and to me he is
[28:07.560 --> 28:11.280]  everything that's wrong with Washington he's a Democratic Party light he
[28:11.280 --> 28:14.920]  doesn't have those bold color differences that Reagan talked about and he
[28:14.920 --> 28:20.000]  should in my view he should not be the speaker he should be replaced that's
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.640]  right let's back that up in play again he should of course he shouldn't be he
[28:24.640 --> 28:30.400]  helped pass Obamacare he's protecting it now he wanted to pass total amnesty he's
[28:30.400 --> 28:33.360]  protecting Obama now
[28:35.240 --> 28:39.680]  he'll put out some red meat rhetoric occasionally to pacify people John
[28:39.680 --> 28:47.640]  Boehner is worse than Obama because we we've defeated Obama a libertarian movement
[28:47.640 --> 28:52.640]  in the Republican Party won the House and the Senate and could reform this
[28:52.640 --> 28:59.920]  country but no no the the Chamber of Commerce nationally all the big
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.040]  Republican money is giving money to kill the Tea Party because these big
[29:04.040 --> 29:07.600]  mega corporations own both parties and they want to keep looting this country
[29:07.600 --> 29:14.360]  till they're done with it well I don't want to be looted by the way
[29:14.360 --> 29:18.880]  guess what they're also doing in Congress they're not just passing banker

[34:42.400 --> 34:45.920]  really removing the power of Congress they're really getting rid of our
[34:45.920 --> 34:49.000]  borders they're really training kids their parents aren't their parents
[34:49.000 --> 34:56.240]  they're really putting cancer viruses and vaccines they really are letting the

[36:08.160 --> 36:12.960]  on conservative Republicans to join them in opposing a massive 1.1 trillion
[36:12.960 --> 36:15.920]  dollar spending bill to keep the government running because it eases
[36:15.920 --> 36:21.920]  Wall Street reforms I'm here today to ask my Republican colleagues who don't
[36:21.920 --> 36:28.080]  want to see another Wall Street bailout to join in our efforts to strip this
[36:28.080 --> 36:34.560]  Wall Street giveaway from the bill this is not about partisanship this is about
[36:34.560 --> 36:40.520]  fairness how do you respond to lawmakers like Elizabeth Warren who say that in
[36:40.520 --> 36:45.120]  this bill you have a giveaway to Wall Street that will ultimately hurt
[36:45.120 --> 36:50.080]  consumers I don't believe that to be the case at all and Democrats have
[36:50.080 --> 36:56.520]  supported this provision in the past it was agreed to in this bill on a
[36:56.520 --> 37:03.200]  bipartisan bicameral agreement it is true that the 1,603 page spending bill
[37:03.200 --> 37:07.680]  was the product of intense negotiating and horse trading between Republicans
[37:07.680 --> 37:13.080]  and Democrats like appropriations chair Barbara Mikulski we debated we fought
[37:13.080 --> 37:18.720]  you know sometimes you give a little you take a little but it was too much
[37:18.720 --> 37:23.480]  giving and taking for wings of both parties conservatives unhappy it did
[37:23.480 --> 37:27.320]  not stop the president's executive action on immigration looks like there's
[37:27.320 --> 37:31.040]  nothing better walk-in retreat Democrats upset about rolling back
[37:31.040 --> 37:36.160]  regulations on banks potentially putting taxpayer dollars at risk back to the
[37:36.160 --> 37:44.560]  same old Republican formula privatize the gain nationalize the risk all right
[37:44.560 --> 37:48.160]  let's stop right there you succeed number one I'm not defending the
[37:48.160 --> 37:52.160]  Republicans but it was the Democrats that overturned all the banking
[37:52.160 --> 37:55.760]  regulations in the 90s and created that big bubble that Clinton claimed was so
[37:55.760 --> 38:04.600]  great I mean they're the ones Larry Summers Ruben Clinton and the Republicans
[38:04.600 --> 38:08.600]  a lot of them went along with it some Democrats spoke out against it but it's
[38:08.600 --> 38:12.760]  bipartisan they keep pointing fingers at each other this is what the special
[38:12.760 --> 38:17.920]  interest want now let me break this down they claim they're protecting pension
[38:17.920 --> 38:21.840]  funds and it's going to be private not just public they've done this in every
[38:21.840 --> 38:26.360]  other country it's coming here now this is what the big banks openly talk about
[38:26.360 --> 38:30.320]  doing they say that pensions are untenable because the national debt's
[38:30.320 --> 38:34.440]  too high well in a way that's true but then they sign us on to derivatives that
[38:34.440 --> 38:39.480]  are private that dwarf all the public stuff so they use the fact that they've
[38:39.480 --> 38:44.320]  set up a public system that's untenable as a way to cut the public system while
[38:44.320 --> 38:48.880]  massively increasing what goes to the foreign banks in banker bailouts and in
[38:48.880 --> 38:52.480]  corporate welfare so that's really what's happening and of course how I've
[38:52.480 --> 38:56.160]  told you a thousand times they're going to say we got to pass this or you'll
[38:56.160 --> 39:02.400]  lose all the public pensions and then it allows them to start cutting them and
[39:02.400 --> 39:06.720]  then oh we're taking 20% of years later another 20 but hey we'd lose it all and
[39:06.720 --> 39:11.080]  then pretty soon the formula is you end up with about 30% of what your original
[39:11.080 --> 39:18.200]  pension was and it's simply done so that the investments that were made in these
[39:18.200 --> 39:22.360]  big banks and in these big brokerage houses and in the stock market can be
[39:22.360 --> 39:27.040]  swindled from you they don't want you to have money they created a two
[39:27.040 --> 39:33.080]  quadrillion global derivatives bubble in the last 30 years to what's actually
[39:33.080 --> 39:38.360]  since about the early 90s so time is flying I guess it's only to get 20
[39:38.360 --> 39:43.480]  something years they were doing some up before but it's really 20 years in the
[39:43.480 --> 39:46.920]  last 20 years they've created a two quadrillion bubble our national debt's
[39:46.920 --> 39:54.040]  19 trillion rounding up so so they they confuse the public you owe 19 trillion so
[39:54.040 --> 40:01.560]  we signed you on to 1000 of the global 2000 quadrillion and this is all of the
[40:01.560 --> 40:04.480]  IMF World Bank documents we've had the former head of the World Bank on many
[40:04.480 --> 40:08.120]  times head of the other head economist ticklets I've had the former head of
[40:08.120 --> 40:11.840]  policy the Treasury on father ergonomics I mean this is well known you're not
[40:11.840 --> 40:19.400]  hearing my opinion this is a fact but even read the Wall Street Journal it
[40:19.400 --> 40:24.320]  doesn't have that much real meat in it the Financial Times of London has a lot
[40:24.320 --> 40:28.200]  of real meat in it but it's always from the perspective of the New World Order
[40:28.200 --> 40:32.920]  but tells the truth yes there's a planetary government yes we're taking
[40:32.920 --> 40:35.400]  your rights away because you don't know any better and yeah we're gonna reduce
[40:35.400 --> 40:39.320]  your population and it is a conspiracy by private six banks and they're
[40:39.320 --> 40:42.920]  obviously smart because they run things that's what their foreign editors said
[40:42.920 --> 40:48.080]  four years ago the headline was and now for world government and he even in
[40:48.080 --> 40:54.040]  another article attacked me because see I'm small-minded I don't get the grand
[40:54.040 --> 40:59.040]  plan no I get the grand plan in fact most the people including the editor the
[40:59.040 --> 41:05.040]  foreign editor of the Financial Times I bet he hasn't really read Aldous Huxley
[41:05.040 --> 41:12.920]  and Julian Huxley and Bertrand Russell and Francis Galton and Charles Darwin
[41:12.920 --> 41:17.200]  and the Kaiser Velhom Institute documents and the Cold Spring Harbor
[41:17.200 --> 41:21.400]  documents and IBM in the Holocaust book and Shearer's Rise and Fall the Third
[41:21.400 --> 41:31.160]  Reich and 300 400 other books I have I know the plan Jack and it ain't nice and
[41:31.160 --> 41:48.160]  all of you people the plan makes Hitler look like a tame person I mean quite
[41:48.160 --> 41:56.840]  frankly Hitler would be the special little mindless wind-up toy that they
[41:56.840 --> 42:03.880]  had as a beta test and I'm not trying to scare people just to scare you I'm
[42:03.880 --> 42:08.400]  telling you what's going on a lot of people hear me talk about this stuff
[42:08.400 --> 42:13.560]  and they get really upset because deep down they know it's true and it's as if
[42:13.560 --> 42:20.840]  I am sabotaging their happy little delusional green pastures world it
[42:20.840 --> 42:27.520]  doesn't go on like that forever so new federal law targets retirement benefit
[42:27.520 --> 42:32.200]  cuts we thought our pensions were secure the 101 trillion spending bill
[42:32.200 --> 42:37.600]  includes some new provisions that may come as a shock and it's all build to
[42:37.600 --> 42:43.280]  save your pension but it's really the end of it more government regulation over
[42:43.280 --> 42:47.560]  private retirement accounts and even the establishment of government-sponsored
[42:47.560 --> 42:52.640]  annuities that would take the place of 401ks see it's the government taking
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.200]  your privatized system that was truly private in to prop up their government
[42:57.200 --> 43:01.720]  systems but it's Wall Street managing it such reforms close quote would
[43:01.720 --> 43:08.560]  effectively in private retirement accounts in America the government could
[43:08.560 --> 43:12.000]  then take these trillions of dollars and redistributed through the new national
[43:12.000 --> 43:18.000]  retirement system that's what Obamacare does but it redistributes and lowers the
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.640]  quality of the care for social engineering purposes they will take our
[43:23.640 --> 43:28.440]  retirement accounts they will take our 401ks they will say you all have been
[43:28.440 --> 43:32.480]  having such hard times earning money so that we're going to do this is we're
[43:32.480 --> 43:36.720]  going to save you we're going to give you government bonds which are guaranteed
[43:36.720 --> 43:40.360]  30-year government bonds and you'll get 3% and you'll give us your retirement
[43:40.360 --> 43:49.240]  assets by the way I am quoting this out of mainstream news this article is
[43:49.240 --> 43:57.120]  links to mainstream news and the congressional record these are quotes
[43:57.920 --> 44:03.320]  amazing and then on top of it again house passes government funding bill
[44:03.320 --> 44:08.480]  with Bankster derivatives bailout provision we're going to go to break
[44:08.480 --> 44:13.080]  here in a little while and come back and get in to the media is focusing on the
[44:13.080 --> 44:16.840]  wrong side of the torture report University bans Christmas on campus to
[44:16.840 --> 44:21.160]  respect diversity but students aren't buying it a great example of how that
[44:21.160 --> 44:25.600]  the tyranny of political correctness can backfire so you can use their attack to
[44:25.600 --> 44:29.800]  make liberty stronger we're also going to look at some other breaking really
[44:29.800 --> 44:34.560]  important news as well on some other subjects but first I wanted to play this

[45:48.960 --> 45:52.120]  said this morning and what oxy powder did for you I'll go into a little more
[45:52.120 --> 45:58.720]  detail back in September I started I decided I was gonna take it and I was
[45:58.720 --> 46:03.280]  I've been hovering between 220 and 215 couldn't get any lower than that you're
[46:03.280 --> 46:08.240]  a big guy what about 63 63 yeah and you know in college I was about 185 190 and
[46:08.240 --> 46:11.920]  I was playing basketball and doing all that stuff so I was and I was really in
[46:11.920 --> 46:16.640]  shape over the years having kids you slow down a little bit so I was up to 220 I
[46:16.640 --> 46:21.200]  think the most I got to was 230 at one point I started to develop you know like
[46:21.200 --> 46:24.360]  a double chin I hadn't really realized that I looked in the mirror I'm like oh
[46:24.360 --> 46:28.640]  my god so I've been trying to watch what I eat by taking different things and you
[46:28.640 --> 46:33.240]  know but I was still like at 215 and when we started selling oxy powder I'm
[46:33.240 --> 46:36.560]  like you know what I'm gonna give it a try and I started off I did five pills
[46:36.560 --> 46:40.320]  the first night and nothing happened and they says on there you got to find your
[46:40.320 --> 46:45.840]  dose so the next night I did seven I woke up the next morning and basically
[46:45.840 --> 46:48.400]  you're gonna be visiting the bathroom what I think it does is it goes in there
[46:48.400 --> 46:51.800]  and like liquefies the stuff that's inside your intestines and then it just
[46:51.800 --> 46:55.800]  flows out pretty much not to get too graphic but I did that for six days once
[46:55.800 --> 46:58.720]  I found that stuff's rotting in there and that's what gives you cancer exactly
[46:58.720 --> 47:02.560]  that is diverticula and it gets rid of it hurts your immune system it does all
[47:02.560 --> 47:05.880]  kind of stuff it just it keeps your digestive system from working properly
[47:05.880 --> 47:09.080]  all that stuff in there took it that first day and I took it for six more
[47:09.080 --> 47:14.240]  days after that and after that I was down to 202 and I know how fast did you
[47:14.240 --> 47:19.040]  lose 12 pounds it was in six seven days literally six seven days you had 12
[47:19.040 --> 47:24.440]  pounds of filth gone went to the beach in early October and I look my wife is
[47:24.440 --> 47:27.440]  like wow you look really good and I'm like I know I don't I guess it's this
[47:27.440 --> 47:30.480]  oxy powder I've been trying to get her to take it she's like well I don't know
[47:30.480 --> 47:34.200]  I said no you're gonna take it so you did all this stuff and it got some of the
[47:34.200 --> 47:38.200]  weight down but not the rest away well I mean for me it's all a synergy but I
[47:38.200 --> 47:41.080]  wish I'd have taken it years ago when they were henpecked at me to take it
[47:41.080 --> 47:45.400]  yeah I mean like really 12 pounds melted off it less in about a week I'd say a
[47:45.400 --> 47:50.120]  week seven days and I've been able to keep it off to I'm I'm I measure myself
[47:50.120 --> 47:53.840]  last night actually I'm like let's see what I'm at 202 how often do you take
[47:53.840 --> 47:57.520]  ox powder no I haven't taken it since that one week time but I'm gonna take it
[47:57.520 --> 48:01.480]  probably after Thanksgiving I think that's so I think every three months I'm
[48:01.480 --> 48:05.720]  just gonna do how many pills made you lose 12 pounds it well so so you did
[48:05.720 --> 48:11.880]  seven for six days and five and then five the first day so seven times five
[48:11.880 --> 48:16.360]  35 plus five about 40 pills so it's not even not even a quarter of the bottle
[48:16.360 --> 48:21.200]  really how many pills are 120 yeah so literally like one bottle if you know I
[48:21.200 --> 48:24.880]  don't I don't take it every day I did it for that I did it intensely you and
[48:24.880 --> 48:27.720]  you really have to stick to it and by the third or fourth day you're like I
[48:27.720 --> 48:30.760]  don't know if I want to keep doing this if you just get through it it's not
[48:30.760 --> 48:33.800]  really that it's not bad at all considering the weight I lost I mean I
[48:33.800 --> 48:38.440]  could never lose the weight doing any other way you know that quickly well
[48:38.440 --> 48:42.320]  this is the final thing people Hollywood stars do to lose that final amount of
[48:42.320 --> 48:45.920]  weight yeah if you're going to if you got a wedding or something coming up I'd
[48:45.920 --> 48:49.160]  say and groups in here in the office like months ago going look see this star
[48:49.160 --> 48:54.040]  she did it and look at this Alex just telling us the best thing I got you need
[48:54.040 --> 49:00.040]  to sell it it definitely works and you know I'm also doing the x2 and a little
[49:00.040 --> 49:05.240]  DNA force but I mean the main thing that I saw the biggest fastest improvement
[49:05.240 --> 49:09.160]  was oxy powder and I'm I'm totally amazed with it now after Thanksgiving I'm
[49:09.160 --> 49:13.240]  going to do another round and the great part is we can go out research bring
[49:13.240 --> 49:16.800]  people the most cutting-edge products and then fund the operation with it it's a
[49:16.800 --> 49:20.400]  win-win-win-win and then all we get is rave reviews we never get negative reviews

[54:19.600 --> 54:22.520]  about his new album it was his take on the world always an informative and
[54:22.520 --> 54:24.880]  popular interview hadn't been homeless in about a year
[54:24.880 --> 54:30.760]  professor Daryl Hamamoto be joining us talk about divide and conquer war they're
[54:30.760 --> 54:33.840]  trying to start he was on with this first time I think five six months ago you
[54:33.840 --> 54:38.840]  now see how much of his predictions have unfortunately come true that's all
[54:38.840 --> 54:46.080]  coming up look at this report by washington's blog upon info wars.com
[54:46.080 --> 54:53.360]  the media is focusing on the wrong Senate torture report the big story torture
[54:53.360 --> 54:59.760]  everyone is missing and I agree with his report it gets into the armed services
[54:59.760 --> 55:04.920]  committee of 2009 that details the systematic widespread torture across
[55:04.920 --> 55:10.960]  the board but that's not even as bad as the torture report from 2000 I think
[55:10.960 --> 55:17.640]  it's 2007 or 8 general to goombu report type in general to goombu torture
[55:17.640 --> 55:21.480]  report he's the Filipino-American general three-star general that did that
[55:21.480 --> 55:26.040]  investigation and that was the real one where they admitted the raping children
[55:26.040 --> 55:31.800]  with large objects dripping with acid in front of their parents in Iraq in
[55:31.800 --> 55:37.200]  places killing people non-terror related just just just demons being hired now
[55:37.200 --> 55:41.640]  the military was ordered to hire former federal prison guards who had records on
[55:41.640 --> 55:50.760]  purpose rape you name it so that's what I mean the the the final reports a
[55:50.760 --> 55:54.960]  whitewash that the report reads all the torture report released by the Senate
[55:54.960 --> 55:58.920]  Intelligence Committee is very important it doesn't address the big scoop
[55:58.920 --> 56:03.240]  regarding torture instead it is the Senate Armed Services Committee report
[56:03.240 --> 56:06.600]  that dropped the big bombshell regarding US torture program senator
[56:06.600 --> 56:11.280]  Levin commenting on the Armed Services Committee report on torture in 2009
[56:11.280 --> 56:15.840]  explained I like the Washington blog he just takes all these quotes his articles
[56:15.840 --> 56:20.160]  are mainly just quotes and documents the techniques are based on tactics used by
[56:20.160 --> 56:23.160]  Chinese communists against American soldiers during the Korean War for the
[56:23.160 --> 56:28.720]  purpose of eliciting false confessions for propaganda purposes text neaks used
[56:28.720 --> 56:32.800]  in seer training see they torture you to learn how to withstand torture well
[56:32.800 --> 56:37.040]  now they just use that as torture and it goes over what's already known I mean
[56:37.040 --> 56:40.400]  folks almost everybody I know that was in the army and the Marines and was the
[56:40.400 --> 56:43.800]  officer on commissioned I mean there's just torture everywhere it's just
[56:43.800 --> 56:48.720]  torture buffet bags was in here yesterday talking about it former senior
[56:48.720 --> 56:52.240]  US intelligence official familiar with the interrogation issued by Cheney and
[56:52.240 --> 56:56.360]  former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld demanded that the interrogators
[56:56.360 --> 57:01.160]  find evidence of al-Qaeda in Iraq to back up that false claim the flashy news
[57:01.160 --> 57:06.400]  reported so yeah this article is a flashback to 2009 to a much more detailed
[57:06.400 --> 57:11.280]  report that was honest and see that's the thing people say there's nobody good
[57:11.280 --> 57:14.640]  in government a lot of good reports come out it's usually government blowing the
[57:14.640 --> 57:18.560]  whistle and then it's the public that doesn't hold the feet to the fire of
[57:18.560 --> 57:24.360]  the perpetrators and I'm gonna say it again this week I've had some
[57:24.360 --> 57:28.200]  publications and a bunch of big radio hosts attack me going Alex Jones is a
[57:28.200 --> 57:32.600]  traitor he don't want to torture the people that blew up our world trade
[57:32.600 --> 57:36.440]  center oh shut up
[57:36.920 --> 57:41.120]  raping a five-year-old in front of their parents in Iraq who's been picked up at
[57:41.120 --> 57:46.240]  a checkpoint because they had a gun in the car with battery acid does not keep
[57:46.240 --> 57:51.280]  America safe it turns us into Jeffrey Dahmer and it removes God's heads of
[57:51.280 --> 57:56.760]  protection from us when we endorse it publicly just like people endorsing
[57:56.760 --> 58:01.080]  abortion I don't judge somebody that's had one I didn't think it was a child but
[58:01.080 --> 58:04.480]  once you know it's a child and once you know it's an anti-human agenda people
[58:04.480 --> 58:09.880]  say oh there are too many kids so you people are sick and then you've got
[58:09.880 --> 58:14.040]  nerve to sit her and tell me cuz why didn't any of our founders torture why
[58:14.040 --> 58:17.320]  has it always been known to be with something the good guys don't do you
[58:17.320 --> 58:22.680]  just turn your back on all that and then have the nerve to sit around it's
[58:22.680 --> 58:26.880]  such an easy cheap shot he don't want to torture the people that killed us on
[58:26.880 --> 58:33.400]  9 11 I mean what a crock all right second hour

[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:20.000]  he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.640]  alex jones merry christmas from everybody here at info wars
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:31.120]  and a great new year coming up by the way i want to give you some of the
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:33.840]  history of torture here before our guest comes up
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.120]  just kind of a just staltz of it
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:46.880]  if in a tribe a little troop a little village of say 120 individuals
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:50.400]  whether it was in ancient africa or ancient europe ancient what's
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:56.480]  asia today china central asia pakistan wherever
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:01.120]  if the people in the tribe caught
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:07.520]  somebody say strangling of five or ten-year-old child for no reason and
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.120]  there were two or three witnesses that saw it
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:16.320]  and those witnesses weren't related because you wouldn't trust that
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:21.200]  that they would call in the town elders maybe five six people
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.080]  and then they would ask everybody what they thought and they'd say yeah it's
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.240]  clear you did it grabbing and then they tie you down and beat
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.440]  your brains out or throw you off a cliff or throw you in a fire whatever the
[01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:36.320]  case may be that is a natural response and i'm for the death penalty
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:41.680]  when you catch somebody red-handed the problem is you can't trust
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.400]  a big corrupt evil government when it turns out in many cases up to a third
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.600]  of people on death row were totally innocent
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:53.440]  now the argument is well they got caught seven times robin banks or
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:56.560]  you know they got caught kidnapping two other times so we thought they were
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.440]  guilty so so what if we execute them it doesn't matter
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.480]  it's better that 15 men as has been said in a maxim
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:06.960]  forget who said it let's look up the quote it's better that you know 10 i
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.680]  think the actual quote is it's better that 10 guilty men go free
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.360]  than one innocent man be imprisoned or killed
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.560]  i think it's a supreme court justice from 100 years ago but
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:20.640]  what i'm getting at here is as i digress
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:26.000]  if i
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:30.960]  i mean i've been in the parking lot before and seen some guy haul off and
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.240]  punch a woman in the face and i've gone over and said you better stop
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.960]  that right now what the hell's your problem they've got in my face and i've
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.760]  said listen about that time people were calling the cops i was like 20 years
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:43.200]  ago and it was as i'm a hero i don't like seeing some big guy
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.320]  punch a woman in the eye and give her a black eye and an instinctive level
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.760]  that's just not right the one thing if she hit him or something
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:53.520]  you know then it would be a thing of passion but guys beating up women an
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.800]  instinctive level i don't like that so think of my mother i think of my
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:00.080]  daughters but before i had daughters i instinctively
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.800]  don't like women being messed with i have that instinctive thing to protect
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:07.440]  women and children that's what men are for that's what we do you're not a man
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:10.320]  if you don't want to do that
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:15.120]  but i mean i guarantee you if i there's been a lot of cases that you read about
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.080]  the news where dad opens the door and some 40 year old guys raping his 10 year
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.520]  old son the dad kills him and they don't even indict him
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:26.240]  much less having grand jury non-bellum everybody gets that
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:29.520]  it was a case just north austin that happened a few last this year i think
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:34.240]  and the dad beat the guy to death there's been cases where a drunk driver runs
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.160]  over somebody's kid right in front of their house
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:39.360]  the dad sees their dead son all those other texas case those gets his gun
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:43.440]  kills him grand jury doesn't indict that's not torture that's not when you
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.000]  beat somebody to death and want them to hurt
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.240]  you're hurt so torture is natural
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.520]  in the moment in the passion where you've caught the person
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:56.960]  you know they've done it and you're going to bash their brains out
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:01.280]  and in the moment you have that killer instinct you're not enjoying it
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.520]  but it's like stepping on a cockroach you have the energy and the will just
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.680]  sit there and throw their head up against the wall or
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.680]  smash it with killer force most people have a governor they just they decide to
[01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:14.640]  not kill they decide to not slam that head
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.440]  down hard enough where it breaks open you can do it
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:22.000]  you just decide you die you can kill them that's how the real world works
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.320]  so there's this tough guy instinct that gets misapplied by you know they hit us
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.400]  on 11 go ahead and torture him you can't have a big nasty government do
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.960]  that because it'll do it for fake confessions
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.080]  and it'll do it to you that's why you don't do it
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.720]  not because we're wins and well why do the russians and the chinese do it well
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:45.840]  because they're barbarous countries that never got reformed
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.120]  you got freedom in russia no we're losing ours here now and they're
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:52.640]  promoting torture and spying and everything else
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:58.720]  and russia's trying to reform itself but western pressure isn't letting it do it
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:03.360]  the average person's life is filled with unexpected challenges

[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:16.880]  millie corrigan of smashing pumpkins has been demonized by cia operative
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.600]  anderson cooper and others as of late
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.760]  you're going to be joining us if his plane gets in on time if not he'll be on
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:26.560]  with us sunday. millie corrigan coming up
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.120]  professor daryl homo moto has been on a couple times with us popular guest
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:33.360]  he's taught at the university of california davis for most of his
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:36.080]  academic career he holds undergraduate and graduate degrees of political
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:38.880]  science popular culture studies in comparative culture
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:42.080]  homo moto is a senior ranking professor in the department of asian american
[01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.680]  studies he is a recognized authority in u.s media popular culture and

[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:52.080]  homo is a recipient of the rockefeller foundation research fellowship
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:55.680]  ucla so he thinks it's funny that he's exposing him with their own money that's
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:59.360]  interesting and is a um fulbright scholar japan
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.640]  his current project is a volume that outlines the principles
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:06.240]  of the new world order theory and is directed to the current generation
[01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:10.080]  college and university undergraduates in search of alternatives to the dominant
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.920]  foundation guided corporatist curriculum
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.520]  and he joins us i i meant to play this clip a few days ago and i had guests on
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.240]  about it but didn't get to it angry black lady
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.040]  is going through her line she says i need free water here because
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:26.400]  it's a form of reparations you know free bottled water
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.280]  and it just goes to the mindset of of of this new super underclass
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.400]  that the system is trying to grow with open borders
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:37.760]  to where you just got completely dependent individuals and the foundations
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:40.480]  the fort foundation and others are on record
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:44.880]  saying this is their plan 50 years ago well professor omoto teaches classes on
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.360]  and exposing it and has gotten a lot of heat for it
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.080]  the good news is a lot of other universities now
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:53.520]  are have classes on new world order theory and conspiracy theory
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.880]  there's a couple i know at ut that are positive
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:59.280]  uh you know views of it i mean i don't know how you couldn't have your
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.240]  objective there's obviously conspiracies there's obviously foundation
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.160]  funded corporatist operations they had the church committee showing that and
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:10.720]  the sudden uh in congress is showing that i mean
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.080]  that's really what's quarterbacking the whole deal
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:18.800]  i was four years ago at bill bergen virginia an individual showed up
[01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:23.120]  out of the national archives and gave me secret documents we published
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.400]  from a famous u.s senator's private papers
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.560]  getting orders from bill bergen group on how to take over the country
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.360]  uh so as as funny as as some of these racists are
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:41.040]  you can laugh at toothless clan people you know we are supreme people and then
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:45.280]  they're on welfare or equally ignorant and mindless
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:49.200]  in my view racist ladies saying white people deserve to pay me everything
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.880]  the point is this the system is trying to make this the dominant culture
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:58.320]  a bunch of infighting a tower of babble so the centralized system can dominate
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:02.560]  us it's classic divide and conquer i know we hammer that but
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:06.640]  the point is people are starting to figure this out so let's play the clip of
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.560]  the uh crazy black lady that wants the free water this video
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:14.160]  came out last week uh on one of the big uh hip-hop
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.160]  websites here it is
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:21.680]  i don't care about that my grandmother was a hundred and four
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:27.840]  she was here right here she just died this year
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.200]  she was a slave okay you right here stone mountain
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.560]  you can go who says that all ancestors want slaves
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.760]  i'm talking about in this country that built this country and we don't get no
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.040]  reparations but y'all come over here hold on
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.880]  mcdonald's okay which is a very huge company i know there was a small
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.480]  company but they don't charge you for no water
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.320]  you come over here you get all kinds of tax breaks but then you charge us for the
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.280]  water are you serious we don't want to build the
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.320]  pipes under this building baby wait wait if we
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:01.680]  trade for it this is private i don't care i don't care
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.200]  i don't care i don't care i don't care doesn't make you right i'm here
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.440]  and no it's not about being right it's a fact what's happened what's the truth
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:13.360]  what's interesting is she actually makes a good point but she projects onto
[01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:17.040]  foreigners who aren't even white that they're involved in slavery or
[01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.400]  somehow they owe her free water
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.400]  and then at the same time she points out that foreigners
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.680]  do get like a 10-year tax break when they start businesses
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.200]  which i think is discriminatory i'm not against new citizens but yeah
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:36.080]  why is that because they want to drive down wages they want to create the
[01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:40.560]  balkanization that they've now created that's the reason for it
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:43.600]  this tower of babel let's go back to the fighting
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.240]  hey what you're not a slave you're not a slave
[01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:48.880]  you're not a slave i come from slavery no you
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:52.240]  we do too i'm from african so we know you don't know where the
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:55.840]  where from just by the way she's calling them foreigners they're obviously
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:59.600]  black americans as well this is on world star hip hop
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:04.080]  i mean this is just crazy man now the black people are racist too
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:09.760]  here here i have to give her free water here let's go back to it
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:13.680]  my parents were born africa but good job african americans thank you very much if
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.720]  you want to know how our parents were born in africa
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:20.720]  okay in africa not african america
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.440]  by the way there's a big difference between african emirants and african
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.640]  americans in the statistics you know some of the african americans do think
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.200]  everything should be free and have this chip on the shoulder
[01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.720]  for some legitimate reasons but the chip just ends up hurting them
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:37.520]  and then they're they're telling i guess one lady is from the us
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:40.400]  and and but then the guy running the store whether is
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:45.280]  an african from africa and you run into the africans that start
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:47.840]  businesses they just don't have that big chip on the shoulder they just want to
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:51.200]  make money and be successful but i guess they're bad too because they own a
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:55.680]  nice convenience store let's go back to the club
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:14:00.640]  american means that your ancestors were bought over here through the slave ship
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:04.320]  yes it does yes it does no we know what it does that's what it means
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:08.400]  your africans sold you my dad my dad is a nigerian
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.400]  okay for real my dad's from your god but my grandmother
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.480]  my ancestry comes from slavery my grandmother was here was slavery what's
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.680]  this gonna do with anything because i come over here
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.520]  who's your ancestry where are we from
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:28.800]  you're not from here where is that you're not from here
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:33.840]  so where are you from your mother your mother's mother wasn't raised here

[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:41.680]  screaming did you know where my mother was
[01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.520]  so you think that you think that the only thing i'm saying is i'll come over
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:51.680]  here and i'm saying y'all because the majority we can go in my
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:55.360]  community i've been back left on you when i the full clip is up on info wars
[01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:59.280]  dot com was up there a few days ago but let's repost the full clip if we can
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.120]  because this is what entitlements all about and it's not to even empower the
[01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:05.440]  lady how about we're entitled to not be spied on
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:08.160]  how about we're entitled to be able to own guns to defend ourselves how about
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:12.160]  we're entitled to not have scyops and government propaganda with our taxpayer
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.200]  money foisted on us how about we're entitled to have the government follow
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.960]  the law and not torture people how about we're entitled to not have a government
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:21.120]  involved in social engineering to divide us
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:24.960]  professor darryl homamodo joins us thank you so much i wanted to air that
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.720]  just to break down what you're talking about i'm going from memory but i think
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.200]  the first time you visited with us was maybe six months ago
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.480]  and you were you were predicting that we're trying to start a massive new
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:38.720]  racial division along every line as their social engineering program
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:43.200]  goes into high gear that is indeed happened professor as you predicted it
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:46.720]  one of the top experts on this type of social engineering
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.760]  break down what you currently think's going on
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:54.240]  well first let me address that that clip that you just aired
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.560]  for me the way i look at it this is a living example of
[01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:02.720]  the woman who's the product most likely of multi-generational
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:07.760]  state-managed welfareism which upper middle class and middle class and
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.400]  professional blacks in the professions and the service industry
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:17.040]  manage as a comparator class this is what you see on
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:24.080]  fox news and cnn and individuals going on talking about how
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:28.000]  your children belong to the state versus a recent immigrant
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:32.640]  from africa south of the sahara whose family does not have a history
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:37.920]  of welfareism who are entrepreneurs and are interested in only earning a
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:43.280]  livelihood for their families but perhaps a better representation of
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:46.560]  sentiment amongst the black underclass is a very poignant
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.960]  encounter between jill gilbert the director
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.760]  in his dvd his documentary gets called a place called utopia
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:02.720]  where he goes into a detroit neighborhood and interviews
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.400]  welfare recipients so-called welfare because it's not really welfare
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:10.720]  it's a modern um neo plantations slavery
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.840]  and uh he polls him he's canvassing and he's getting
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:18.480]  he's trying to get their their sentiments their ideas about what it's like
[01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:22.720]  and it's quite impressive the the sense of um
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.880]  not just struggle but resistance to this this system that's kicking them down
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.240]  they're they're dimly aware of it and they don't like it
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:33.520]  they want off of it they want to contribute they want to work they want
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:37.920]  to be productive and that's that's innate to all humanity we
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.280]  want to produce we want to reproduce we want to extend
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:45.840]  ourselves as a species into the future and work
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.760]  is a linchpin of that very idea of civilization
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:53.280]  and that's been stripped of us here in america
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.320]  systematically over the years and it's accelerating
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:18:01.920]  and the bad news it's now the middle class including middle class professionals
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:07.920]  are the next uh group to fall and that's the jenna 21 globalist plan
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:11.440]  on record i want you to break down why the ruling system
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:15.040]  has decided to go to this they've got the robots coming out to replace us
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.240]  even the military to be replaced men aren't even going to be able to fight
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.680]  anymore even though there's obvious cultural problems with war
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.600]  that is still an instinct that has a proper place that's to be removed
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.280]  women can't be feminine anymore they really want to homogenize
[01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:33.360]  they claim they want sexual liberation and freedom but really the end game
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.640]  in my view is to actually end our sexual natures
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:41.440]  and actually end our diversity uh it's an anti-human movement
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.560]  it's going to be a monoculture mono government
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:49.440]  monosexuality mono everything it's going to be synthesized into
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:53.760]  uh the type of utopian equality that uh
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.360]  your uh healthly type people have been envisioning for
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:02.480]  close to 100 years now but uh in thinking about some of your
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:07.040]  earlier comments in today's program including pension bustouts and all that
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:13.200]  i more and more understand uh that places like the university of california
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.360]  are really uh the microcosm of this this this
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.360]  plan it's a microcosm of the new world order if you will
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:25.840]  that will be imposing this regime and it's in an advanced stage of imposing
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:30.800]  this regime of GMOs which are affecting our
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:36.000]  our intellect our reproductive capacity uh bringing in the borderless economy
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  so-called synthron theorists right the intonation hood the
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.520]  international sovereignty um the genderless society and then
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.800]  very importantly uh ethnic balkanization so the
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:53.840]  the question is uh these ideas these uh pieces of social
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.840]  political economic and cultural engineering don't come out of nowhere
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.400]  they have a uh a genesis they have a point of origin
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:06.720]  and one of the main points of origin is the university of california
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.640]  most of these agenda items that are being implemented by
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:15.600]  the quote unquote new world order uh are funded by the foundations i have been
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:20.960]  a recipient of these foundation grants and this is what they uh the people who
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:24.720]  print the money including prior family foundations
[01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.920]  they go in there and they they set an agenda
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.560]  by doling up money in specific areas in specific areas
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:36.240]  only uh you notice that the soros foundation
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:39.600]  or the bill and melinda gates foundation uh they do not
[01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:43.920]  fund initiatives that deal with neighborhood entrepreneurialism
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:47.280]  immigrant business entrepreneurialism or anything that has to do with the
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:51.680]  free market or any other aspects of a free and healthy society anything
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.360]  decentralized they are against it and when you look at the
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:58.720]  plan they all say it's liberal classical american
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.720]  liberalism but it's the opposite of liberalism it is a
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:09.040]  borg hive post human system it's post human it's trans
[01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:12.960]  human and it's uh i guess the best uh image is that
[01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:16.000]  it's uh it's a molester that's handing you the candy
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:19.600]  you know it's quite seductive someone like gruber
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:23.280]  of course uh is motivated by status he was the
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:26.800]  the kid in junior high school who had his gem trunks pulled down
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:29.840]  and he spent the rest of his life trying to pay back
[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:34.640]  uh all these bullies and that's really endemic to academia what you're
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:39.600]  saying is guru guru very small i call it and it's all these very very
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.160]  little people who happen to be uh somewhat smart and they have credentials
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:48.400]  and uh they're uh well i don't know if i can say i can analyze but they're paying
[01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:51.680]  back to society but they're also getting the rewards
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.840]  and their recognition and the accolades by these
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.720]  illusory well sure i watched a bunch of those
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:03.120]  videos in full not just the clips we played and he would be there teaching
[01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:07.120]  professors and phd students how to lie and
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:10.400]  how the world really works so i guess you get a phd now
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:14.720]  according to him to learn the inside baseball of pure bs and whereas that
[01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.680]  always went on from when i've seen in some special phd's
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.240]  the last hundred years in this country in england and germany
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.320]  it wasn't like they'd get on c-span and brag about it
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:29.280]  so it does show really the arrogance the arrogance of how stupid they think we
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:32.480]  are it's arrogance and i was listening to one of
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.880]  your earlier interviews this week i forgot who the guest was but he uh
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:41.120]  referred to it as the narcissism a lot of these high-ranking military that's
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:44.800]  dr steve pacenic yeah dr steve pacenic great great
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:48.880]  mind great intelligence and great analyst and i i really enjoy listening
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:54.560]  down uh his fiction is not so great but i like him as a
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:58.000]  political analyst i you know i read everything i check
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:03.280]  check into all all your guests but yes it's endemic to all the institutions
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.680]  this is the maybe the up uh growth of the me generation the narcissistic
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:13.680]  generation of the 1960s which was also a sci-off which was also a product of
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:16.400]  culture engineering we're seeing this we have to
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:22.720]  and going into the next uh year 2015 uh learn a bit of humility
[01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:26.960]  and reject hubris because uh universally
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.960]  and uh through time uh the poets the writers
[01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:34.800]  have warned us in so many different ways that this this is what happens to
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:37.920]  individuals like ruber and he's he's just emblematic
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.680]  of a large number and growing numbers of people even people of the underclass
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:46.320]  who were in time who feel that they're entitled to have a free bottle of water
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:53.040]  um so we have to uh i think to uh look very deeply in our into our souls over
[01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:57.920]  the holidays and um see what we can do to help
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:24:03.040]  inspire young people um for example i'm an educator and i'm
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.440]  trying to teach these values fortunately a lot of my students are the
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:12.240]  children of immigrants of refugees they understand the work ethic
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:16.560]  they understand the sacrifices that their parents are making for them
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:20.400]  and they understand through their parents the value of enterprise family and
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:24.080]  all really basic core america so they understand how the social
[01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:30.240]  engineers are trying to co-op them exactly and i warned them not to fall
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:33.760]  into the clutches of the university curricular
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:39.360]  establishment and student services which has taken that energy
[01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:43.440]  taken that vitality that use that idealism warping it
[01:24:43.440 --> 01:24:46.880]  twisting it and misdirecting it and smashing it
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:50.880]  with the end game of destroying the spirit and their soul so they
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:55.920]  too will enter this new larger uh controlled welfare system this is what's
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:58.960]  going on uh i think nationally talking to different
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.840]  colleagues that's right um young people are
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:07.840]  really really being assaulted including their finances student debt uh it's
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:12.240]  pretty common now in even corporate media that the amount of student debt is
[01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:16.320]  much much worse and higher and much more will be more devastating and they're
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.800]  going to bankrupt education when they're done with the bubble and then
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:22.080]  nationalize it fully just like they're going to bankrupt the pensions the
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:25.440]  nationalize it but it's not even nationalize it's private interest
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:29.360]  we're being conquered and the minute people realize that
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.480]  it's game over now obviously the republican party's full a bunch of croaks
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:36.160]  at the top but but this major political realignment
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:40.400]  now baner is ignoring all of it uh they're going to go with the open border
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.960]  they're going to go with the banker bailouts they're going to sign on to
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.200]  derivative bailouts just just more more more
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.480]  but politically they did send a bunch of new people there
[01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:54.640]  uh who are trying to fight against that some of them but i think the message
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:58.480]  even though imperfect shows there is an awakening happening
[01:25:58.480 --> 01:26:02.400]  there's a mass awakening even large numbers and
[01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.720]  growing numbers of self-satisfied professors who live in college towns and
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:12.640]  think they're immune from the currents of economic decline and think that
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:16.880]  they really believe that race ethnicity and gender are the is the end all in
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.280]  view all of understanding and it only explains a really really small
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:25.040]  part of the problems that we're facing so what i have
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:29.440]  done in order to get them into the tent so to speak
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:33.680]  is to bring to their attention that their security
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.240]  is an illusion their retirement their pension the uc
[01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:43.200]  investment fund has been eyed hungrily by the wolves of
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:46.880]  wall street for many years now they're just waiting for an opportune time
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.400]  to go in there for the kill they're kind of circling the prey right now
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:55.360]  they're taking uh their pulse but once i make my colleagues aware that this is
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.400]  their strategy and they have janet depolitano in place there and they
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.360]  have the m-raps and the militarized camps is there in
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:04.640]  cases any sort of dissent and they have the students bought off in their
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:08.720]  little ethnic identity politics uh going on they've got them nicely
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.280]  balsamized and segregated like the old city of rome precisely we have all the
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:16.480]  different factions and perpetual tension
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:22.000]  and they bring in presidents or chancers such as linda kate who's a greek
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.720]  national i don't know if she's even a u.s citizen
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:28.800]  who according to my research and this is this is how you attack them you do your
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:32.560]  homework you find the biography it's very easy it's open
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:40.080]  source and she comes from um a a network an international network to
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.920]  nationalize and socialize and globalize institutions of higher education
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.920]  course of course absolutely and she's one of the she was at one of the
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:52.800]  leading consultants for the destruction of the higher education system in
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:56.960]  greece yep and that is uh coterminus with with the
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.200]  destruction of the larger greek economy they go hand in hand
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:04.400]  well notice how they use mainstream media this is a formulae
[01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:07.760]  to to attack and dump people down but then that discredits it
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.120]  then they just get rid of it entirely and have nothing but direct government
[01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:14.640]  pronouncements this is the plan the people that
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:18.080]  sell out to it within 20 30 years end up being
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:22.640]  betrayed and now it's compressing where it's happening quicker and quicker
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:27.120]  that's right individuals like uh linda kate he and her underlings and ship jen and
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:31.520]  apolitano and even professor gruber they think that they can
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.400]  outrun the history training but they won't be able to
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:40.080]  they'll be uh pulled out beneath it uh just like the rest of us perhaps a
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:44.000]  little bit later down the line it really is crazy i mean i mean
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.920]  congress thought they could turn the nsa loose to
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:49.200]  spy on everybody and that they wouldn't be spied on and blackmailed by it and now
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:53.200]  we know what's going on i mean we have information and
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.920]  and uh data and uh robert murdoch with uh in britain is involved in the
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:00.960]  hacking scandal even the royals have all most of their personal
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.280]  information in the database for blackmail and control
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:08.880]  exactly and we see all these pedophile scandals coming out now
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:14.080]  to force the england to go into the e you uh this is really a diabolical plan
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:18.080]  i don't know how the couple thousand people uh even the christian group says
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:22.240]  it's less than six thousand people that manage it uh only a few dozen families
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:25.920]  that run it they have created a monster to dominate us
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:28.640]  that will be the monster that undoubtedly destroys them
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:31.680]  professor stay with us we'll be right back on the other side
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:34.880]  i want to take some phone calls for you but also give you the floor to cover
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.440]  all the hot topics that i know you're covering and what you're telling
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:41.040]  your students professor darryl homamodo from uc
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:45.840]  california uh is joining us we'll give the number out when we come back stay
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:51.600]  with us we're on the march the empire's on the run
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:58.800]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:04.160]  2015 is almost here and with it comes those new year's resolutions to finally
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:08.720]  transform your body the way you want it there's a reason over 88 percent of
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:12.560]  new year's resolutions fail make this year different by equipping
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:15.600]  yourself with oxy powder the next level in cleansing the
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:19.360]  body naturally using super oxygenation oxy powder
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:22.800]  available through info wars life calm gently cleanses the body
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:27.280]  while you sleep with easy capsules tens of thousands of individuals have used
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:31.040]  oxy powder to cleanse their bodies and aid in their transformations
[01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:35.440]  even info wars nightly news director rob do has been using oxy powder with

[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:20.960]  contributions of your fine caster your reportage team
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:25.600]  has directly influenced and informed not just my lectures
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:29.680]  which of course has reached any number of students by now but also my
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.840]  scholarship there's a book a new book of mine that's in the mail to you that
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:37.280]  explicitly acknowledges your contribution to my own
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:40.800]  intellectual development well thank you i'm honored i can't wait to
[01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:43.920]  maybe carry the book and obviously have you on about it once i read it
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:47.680]  absolutely and also just a sort of a experiment
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.760]  10 you 10 minutes prior to having this conversation with you
[01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:57.840]  i took some secret 12 it's it's basically a liquid b12 vitamins put it
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.720]  sublingually and i take this right before the lectures
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:04.720]  because my goal is to be as fluid and slick as
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:09.920]  Joel Osteen one of our favorite glitter bug preachers
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.560]  for the international audience well you're a sweetheart for plugging in we
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.160]  really are proud of secret 12 thank you so much brother it's great
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:21.680]  thank you well thank you it does work it's it does something to the synapses
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:24.880]  well thank you i mean i mean i've asked so many questions here but front and
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:27.120]  center what are you most focused on right now well you
[01:40:27.120 --> 01:40:31.680]  you alluded earlier to some of the the trials and tripulations that i've
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:35.680]  experienced been experiencing at the university of california
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:39.520]  it's been almost uh not complete but almost a complete reversal of
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:44.080]  fortune since that time and the reason for that
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:47.680]  again it goes back to the power of information and analysis and the power
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:52.720]  of the pen because my book came out and everything that i've been
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:56.960]  talking about and teaching and at the classroom level is now
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:01.920]  codified three-dimensionally in a book also a colleague of mine has been
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:07.120]  harassed continuously and just to show you the viciousness of the
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:12.240]  university system she was declared clinically dead due to a
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:15.440]  massive health crisis which i won't go into detail
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:19.520]  and she published a path breaking uh law school
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:23.600]  journal article which by the way if any of your listeners or viewers
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:27.360]  internationally or in the u.s would like a copy of that journal article have
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:30.960]  them email me and i'll send them a pdf of it's a great article
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:35.600]  because it combines her own tribulations as a woman as a female
[01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:40.160]  as a scholar who's trying to forge new
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:43.840]  paths in academic and social cultural analysis
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:49.040]  who was relentlessly persecuted by her own department who by the way are also
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:52.800]  asian-american so this idea of uniform white
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:58.400]  oppression is really really really it's a cliche it's becoming cliche and it's
[01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:01.600]  not really completely accurate anymore we have to
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:05.040]  get beyond that yeah gangs of humans oppress other humans period
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:09.040]  absolutely and in yesterday's concluding lecture uh
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:12.640]  i got a box of chocolates from and a card from an appreciative student
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:17.200]  but at yesterday's lecture i pointed out that Mao Zedong
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:20.960]  who was of course as you know a Yale a Yale in china and he was
[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:24.800]  cultivated by the os s you've spoken to that many many times in this show
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:30.240]  and that information is available in mainstream publications histories
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:35.120]  i cited the fact that he's on chinese and he was responsible for the death of
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:38.640]  the upwards of 80 million fellow on chinese
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:43.200]  so where does the race and ethnicity critique uh fit into that model it
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:46.880]  doesn't really explain it the race ethnicity gender critique
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:52.080]  does not explain the economic meltdown that we're experiencing currently
[01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:55.200]  and i think and i'm working on this this is speculative
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:00.080]  but i think that the diversion of energy intellectual scholarly
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:05.280]  and student energy from the real important monumental issues of our time
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:08.960]  has itself been engineered it seems like the foundations
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:12.800]  are pouring tons and tons of money on race ethnicity
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.320]  and gender studies to the exclusion of other
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:20.400]  modes of analysis and that comes out of the elite institutions
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:25.120]  so that people like professor gruber can do his dirty work in the dark
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:28.480]  this is what's going on here it's the same with the humanities
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:32.720]  again speculative but the reason why students are dropping out of humanities
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:36.400]  and droves is because there's something called the theory scare
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:40.560]  that took hold in academia in 1970s and i i think i alluded to this in an
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:43.680]  earlier conversation with you instead of reading the great
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:47.120]  classics dostoevsky which i'm reading again now as an adult it has
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:51.040]  as much more impact on me as a as a grown-up person
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:53.920]  instead of reading these classics they were just engaging
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:59.600]  in uh literally fraudulent uh high theoretical philosophical
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:03.680]  screeds by people like paul de man they were people that were imported
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.120]  primarily from france and i think that was a psyops
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:12.400]  i if if any uh enterprising phd student wants to do a forensic analysis of it
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:16.320]  it was sort of like the 1960s when all the lsd and the peace and love and the
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:20.480]  fake counterculture was brought in by people like stewart brand and
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:24.480]  timothy leary uh once that uh glow started to wear
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:28.560]  off uh the humanities which traditionally has been
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:34.880]  the source of dissent and incisive uh speculative thinkers with artistic
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:39.600]  skills that can help humanity progress forward they brought all these uh
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:42.800]  foreign intellectuals like a jocke-getty-da and all these people
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:46.560]  they're still studying in the english departments now
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:50.320]  if they started studying the humanities the renaissance
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:54.640]  classical greek roman societies sumerian babelonian
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:58.880]  from a new world order perspective looking at some of the occultic elements
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.560]  that underlie these different cultures i think they would have students
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:06.880]  hanging off the rafters in humanities courses their board
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:10.400]  students are not buying it anymore they're sick of it the the race
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:15.440]  ethnicity gender model has been in place for 40 years it's been funded by the
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:20.560]  ford foundation and by the way there are academic books coming out right now
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:25.280]  currently that are tracing institutionally how
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:28.880]  how entities like the ford foundation have hijacked
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:33.840]  academic discourse scholarly production uh at the university well sure and
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.960]  eisenhower and his federal address warned of that not just a military
[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:39.680]  industrial complex he talked about an academic
[01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:45.600]  um elite in intellectual circles creating with federal funding a
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:49.760]  unified system because they are worried about classical
[01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:54.000]  liberalism thomas jefferson liberalism they're scared to death of it
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.200]  so they create mainly like a new cult of it
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:01.680]  where a either men only sit around and talk about sports which is its own
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:06.640]  mindless diversion or let's talk about race and let's talk about
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:11.040]  sexual stuff and let's talk about you know how women of instead of just living
[01:46:11.040 --> 01:46:15.120]  and actually being liberal and free and open and being tolerant
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:18.480]  instead it's you must adopt the one thing we're pushing
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:22.160]  and then we learn it wasn't about tolerance at all it was about
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:27.280]  getting in the mode of following orders and that it's actually a great
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:32.640]  tyranny that we're facing it's a form of uh control political economic control
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:38.880]  through cultural indoctrination and unfortunately the university
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:42.480]  has been transformed into this height of this this indoctrination
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:45.840]  well i know why your students are sick of it because when i hear it
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:48.560]  when i walk in and people are watching espn and they start wanting me to talk
[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:51.760]  about it i just i don't even get mad at them i just leave
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:55.120]  or whenever people sit around at a table i go to dinner with somebody and they
[01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:59.040]  start bringing up race and uh i mean from a liberal
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:03.120]  or at other side of it i'm like hey i'm done i'm not discussing it
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:06.640]  and i'm not saying i'm some great goody tissue but as you said
[01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:10.640]  these issues they took real evils magnified them set up a whole system
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:14.480]  around that uh with guilt when it has nothing to do with it
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:18.160]  and now they've replaced it with all these new despotisms all these new
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:20.720]  oppressions and they're just using it as this
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:24.880]  hot button issue where i don't care what color you are
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:30.960]  people are paralyzed by it and then actually don't mingle with people that
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:35.040]  look or act different because they're also scared and then as you said they
[01:47:35.040 --> 01:47:39.600]  can all then be controlled by their little local racial
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.360]  capo who then interfaces with the foundations of the government
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:47.760]  and if any of those capos or chiefs ever get off the reservation
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:51.200]  their money's cut off they're targeted but i think what you got at
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:55.200]  you were attacked at first but then when you fought back and didn't back off
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:58.720]  then you got more support and the system backed off and that's what i've
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:03.040]  experienced when we have the facts when we have the truth
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:07.120]  when people are hungry for it now when real revolution is in the air
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:13.040]  a revolution of ideas we're selling ideas that no army can stop
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:16.480]  i mean as victor hugo said no army can stop an idea whose time has come
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:20.720]  and that time has come and i don't think the establishment
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:23.680]  can put this thing back together again professor
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:31.040]  they cannot the truth writing research info wars this will win the day
[01:48:31.040 --> 01:48:36.080]  for us but in addition to that it doesn't hurt if you lawyer up as well
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.560]  and i i engage the service is one of the best he's mr dan stegel he's a civil
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:43.680]  rights attorney in oakland california
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:48.800]  he has whipped the uc any number of times and in my situation
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:53.440]  he's going to hand them their butt so it also takes the threat of a nice butt
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.120]  kicking too well good job like good job i'm glad you're able to
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.800]  continue in your free speech because when you study real globalist
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:06.000]  publications it's all conspiracy i mean it's not even really absolutely i mean
[01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.360]  mainline history books it's in there it's just that the students aren't given
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:13.280]  any of this they're not uh there's uh just sort of
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:16.640]  an inculcated linkage blindness as i would call it
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:19.680]  there a lot of it has to do with the fact that
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:23.840]  most professors stop growing after they receive tenure they think that they're
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:27.360]  that they're over the hump there but they're going to start waking up
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:31.680]  really quickly when they learn through my efforts and other peoples
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:36.160]  that our pension funds and our retirement and our investment funds are
[01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:40.000]  are going to be systematically looted and by the way the university california
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.720]  this is a warning to other institutions public
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:46.720]  institutions or not it seems like they're going for the so-called
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:50.880]  sustainability economy so they've hitched their investment wagon to the
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:54.960]  gore and blood team blood and core investment team
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:49:59.600]  sustainability weather change agenda 21 is your
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:03.360]  as you alluded to earlier because most people at universities are sort of
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.960]  hippie to pee they want to drive a prius and wear Birkenstocks and have a phone
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.600]  detail and that economy bankrupted spain so they've
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:13.680]  got to know their hitch to a loser but it's meant to lose it's meant they
[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:17.600]  don't want a real sustainable economy they want the sexy
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:21.600]  austerity i go to Whole Foods and half the magazine are it's great to be poor
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:24.880]  now it's so cool but then meanwhile obama's
[01:50:24.880 --> 01:50:27.840]  flying around air force one telling africans they can't have cars or air
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:30.640]  conditioners i mean why not say you can have clean
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:34.240]  cars and clean air conditioners i mean it's just they're teaching us
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:38.800]  it's not good to progress as a new dark age to stop the renaissance that

[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:52.160]  oh hey it's an honor to speak with you gentlemen um
[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:56.480]  yet um dr. yama moda do you do you foresee any
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:00.960]  top elitist like having a change of heart and
[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:04.320]  and like becoming whistleblowers or are they too entranced in their divide and
[01:55:04.320 --> 01:55:11.280]  cough the mindset i don't think anybody
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:15.280]  is is free of the possibility of conversion
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:19.760]  or coming to their senses the uh the story of solip tarsus is
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:23.200]  quite instructive right as alex mentioned earlier he was
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:28.160]  basically a thug a brute an enforcer for the Pharisees
[01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.480]  and uh he had a a radical change of heart
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:36.400]  and spirit in mind so yes it's possible and
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:41.040]  i'll go a little bit further than that i foresee uh larger and larger numbers of
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:44.160]  defections from people as they feel of their own
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:49.840]  self-interest being threatened you're absolutely right and and look it's easy
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:53.840]  to cheat it's easy to divide people that's why so many cultures do it
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:56.960]  there's always going to be some element of manipulation nobody's perfect but
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:00.880]  we're we're into a decadent cycle right now where it's so intense
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:04.400]  and they're using high-tech media systems to do it and it's so toxic to
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.960]  everybody we have to have a cultural awakening to
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:11.040]  these tactics and then reject them just like we reject a gmo

[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:51.120]  day lined up at soup kitchens that would really expose what the
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:55.440]  economy's been converted to professor absolutely and those numbers are
[01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:58.800]  rising uh they're beginning to affect the middle
[01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:04.640]  class and uh with the lowering of uh of immigration
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:07.840]  barriers you're going to see a lot of professionals in the it business and
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:11.600]  computer science and engineering uh affected by
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:14.720]  foreign workers that people like mark zuckerberg
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:19.520]  and bill gates want to have and uh bring in to take their jobs away
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:23.040]  and then that gets rid of one of the only first world countries

[02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.520]  frank in north carolina you're on the air with professor
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:50.560]  homo moto go ahead frank yes uh professor i just wanted to lay out a
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:54.560]  quick tenure observation and then i will really value your opinion i'd like to
[02:00:54.560 --> 02:00:57.360]  ask you a question i'm sure you'll have a good
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:01.040]  interesting response but i figure you're probably more intelligent more informed
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:04.960]  than 99 percent of the people i come into contact with in any given year
[02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:08.400]  here in my area the country now i keep seeing these headlines of the cia
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:12.400]  justifying torture based on the 9-11 attacks and i hear all these people
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:16.720]  calling into all these talk shows in my area mostly saying that they agree with
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:20.080]  a policy of torture because of 9-11 and all that now
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:26.240]  i know uh that 9-11 was uh i guess just for the purposes of brevity here uh an
[02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:29.840]  inside job uh and i hear from people insiders like
[02:01:29.840 --> 02:01:34.880]  dr steve pacinic that over that say that overwhelmingly the american people do
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:38.480]  not believe the official story of the 9-11 attacks and i just keep wondering
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:42.320]  uh i've been awake for 10 years where are all these people you're listening
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:47.120]  to niche fake right wing radio where people just regurgitate
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:51.440]  talking points the same cult as democrats do
[02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:56.080]  and so that's why you have pockets of this in many areas of the country as you
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:01.760]  have pockets that are really awake i'd say 30 percent are really wise to what's
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:06.080]  going on another 20 percent knows something and
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:09.920]  about half the public just doesn't care but still that type of percentage is
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:14.240]  huge uh let's get the professor's take on that
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:18.960]  i'm skeptical of the numbers that are being produced there but uh
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:23.120]  supposedly the majority of american people being in favor of torture
[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:29.520]  um i was perhaps trying to attribute this this hype to these trolls that uh
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:33.360]  that call into these programs you notice uh these individuals who are
[02:02:33.360 --> 02:02:37.040]  pro-torture do not call into the alex show and show
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:41.760]  i don't hear them calling into a savage nation
[02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:45.360]  there are these small really local television
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:51.360]  and radio programs that that court the this very small constituency and it's
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:56.720]  still very difficult for me to to wrap my mind around any notion that most
[02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:00.320]  americans who are good and moral individuals by
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:03.600]  and large would accept the abuse the humiliation the
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:08.320]  torture of human beings i think most of them are are like
[02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:15.280]  joe biggs who quite um pointedly talked about the screams
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:19.200]  and then the weeping and then the silence that followed
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:24.240]  in that progression uh that's deeply affecting to most human beings but
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:27.360]  perhaps i'm underestimating well sure and plus intellectually
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:31.760]  it destroys the judicial system you can't believe any confessions anymore
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:35.360]  if torture is going on i mean absolutely completely and
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:38.720]  perhaps that's what why the torture regime has been put in place
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:43.280]  is to produce a rot from the inside out and from the top down
[02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:47.840]  well sure plus there's the schizophrenic hypocrisy where anybody else that ever
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:53.760]  tortures bad north korea is bad or nazi germany's bad or
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:58.080]  you know blah blah blah but oh my gosh when we do it it's good
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:01.840]  now let's let's uh stick to the moral high ground you can't go wrong
[02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:05.760]  by by just doing what's right and what's moral and what's just
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.360]  you're right though it is an attempt to infect us with corruption
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:12.560]  absolutely this is part of the destruction of the culture this is
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:16.640]  psyops this is uh programming of the highest sort
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:20.560]  appealing to the basis native basis aspect of human nature

[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:31.600]  his name right billy corgan and he's not in a hotel room he's flown in and
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:36.480]  landed he is in the airport right now and so i can't
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:39.680]  wait to have him back in studio next time he's in austin
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:42.480]  he's a regular listener and he's just a great guy i'm
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:46.960]  learning he was listening through a man cow a fellow friend and he's a really
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:49.600]  smart guy one of the smartest people i've talked to
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:54.320]  not just in music or entertainment but period and billy corgan has actually
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:57.440]  taught me quite a bit about perspectives and
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:00.640]  how to see the world and has helped me mature
[02:10:00.640 --> 02:10:04.800]  some and i think that's why out of the blue
[02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:09.120]  for the last decade or so you see just random hit pieces even though there's
[02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:13.440]  no scandals no dirt nothing that's why you see
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:16.160]  anderson cooper admittedly of the cia attacking him
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:20.000]  now that's why you see ms nbc saying snippy things rolling stones saying
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.120]  snippy things it's because he's outside of the system
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:27.040]  he didn't play ball with him he spoke out about the dumbing down to music
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:30.880]  with mtv and more and they don't like smart people
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:34.000]  who have the power of reaching tens of millions who've sold
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.920]  40 million albums just like david mustain their views may differ a little
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:41.120]  bit but they agree on fighting terry there's a global government
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:44.160]  their social engineering look at the demonization of him
[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:48.480]  because if you let one aunt stand up they might all stand up
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:53.040]  to quote up is it a bug's life this is what we're talking about here so he's
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:56.640]  joining us from the airport i'll keep him to about 40 after 45
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:00.160]  after or so so he can get on his next plane or get on down the road
[02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:03.120]  he was going to be on with this yesterday but i had a family emergency
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:08.080]  had to take care of uh billy corgan thank you so much for coming on with us
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:11.920]  thank you alex always a pleasure to talk to you you heard my intro there there's
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:15.040]  so much to get into let's talk about anderson cooper
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:19.360]  first not that he even matters has almost no viewers dinosaur media
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:23.680]  uh but at the same time it's so clear that every time you've got an album
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:28.720]  about to come out the hit pieces begin because they want to slap you down
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:32.320]  yeah well it's pretty strange uh i don't know if your listeners know the context
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:36.160]  of this but i did a a cover for a charity
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:39.840]  called paul chicago it's a no kill shelter model very proud of
[02:11:39.840 --> 02:11:43.200]  i've helped raise along with my partner in the band jeff
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:46.720]  quarter million dollars for the charity one of my proudest things i've ever
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:50.400]  done uh is being involved in animal rights issues
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:53.680]  and uh it was about six months ago you know the image went viral it's me and my
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:57.920]  rescue cats on the cover of the magazine never in a million years did i think i
[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:01.120]  started getting attacked and out of nowhere four or five months later
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:05.600]  there i am being made fun of no context for the fact that it's charity magazine
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:09.760]  basically presented as if i've fallen so far off the celebrity radar that i'm
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:14.320]  reduced to doing a cat magazine then uh then ties it into uh
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:17.600]  kind of a what where has he gone what you know what you know whatever happened
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:20.640]  to him kind of thing turned to kind of make mocking my participation in
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:24.880]  professional wrestling no mention of my new album no mention of my successes
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:28.880]  uh nothing is as if i was some you know sort of uh i just disappeared off you
[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:32.720]  know the celebrity map very strange and i think he's probably been a bit shocked
[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:36.640]  by the reaction because a i fought back which you're not supposed to do you're
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:39.680]  supposed to take your licks and just to put your tail between your legs because
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:44.160]  the mighty cnn has spoken i'm on top of that now a lot of animal rights people
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:48.400]  raised up and started poking in the eye because uh you know it's it's it's uh
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:51.440]  it's something that you know uh that's a that's a demarcation line that should
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:55.920]  be left alone people doing charity work um it really is emblematic of the
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:59.040]  sickness of our culture and by the way you don't brag about that a lot but i've
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.560]  seen it you you help a lot of charities out there and you were helping save and
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:06.480]  rescue cats raising and other you know tons of money
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:09.600]  and you know really working in the community like i know you quietly do in
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:14.000]  around chicago uh and then you're a bad guy no it's because you are a good guy
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.760]  and are quietly out there working while doing other big things in media
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:21.680]  that they're scared of you it's because they know they don't control you
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:27.120]  and you know what's going on yeah i think it is very interesting to see
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:31.200]  these kind of uh assassins come out of the woodwork um this is probably the
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:34.080]  most well received album i've had in about 20 years
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:37.280]  um and i've been through a lot you know uh in my own
[02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:40.240]  way and now you know i've shot myself in the foot like any good artist would
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:44.480]  but i i've seen the kind of dialed it back in uh the music business is coming
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:47.920]  up back around me and it's amazing because all of a sudden then you're uh
[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:51.200]  you know that you're at a target because you know you have power you have
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:54.000]  mass power again um it's the kind of power that's very
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.120]  threatening to those systems they do not want outliers they love
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:14:00.560]  muppets they love people who tell the party line
[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:05.440]  um you know and and i think it's uh you know your audience doesn't need an
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:08.880]  education on this they're they're more aware than any audience in the world
[02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:12.240]  uh how these things work so uh we don't have to go on about it but i mean i
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:16.320]  think it's very obvious that uh you know here they come you know i i i can
[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:20.560]  you know i the agenda starts to poke out um i just an interview uh about a week
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:24.480]  ago guy was asking me about edward snowden
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:27.200]  here's here's here's the line of questioning out of nowhere in the middle
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:31.520]  of an interview about my my new album uh do you believe edward snowden was a
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:34.960]  hero yes why because he did the right thing
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:39.440]  next question uh would you do the same okay i told the guy to go you know what
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:43.680]  himself i said am i running for president i mean what kind of what kind of
[02:14:43.680 --> 02:14:46.960]  line of questioning is that i'm promoting an album
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:50.720]  well and the reason we raise it i know my audience is very informed it's that
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:54.240]  obviously you can speak here uncensored they won't
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:58.560]  be able to filter it as much and so you can speak directly to it because
[02:14:58.560 --> 02:15:03.200]  this is what happens to myself to ron paul uh to countless others that that
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:05.920]  really try to shift the paradigm into really
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:10.000]  waking up to the larger control system is they put articles out constantly
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.040]  alex jones you know it has no audience alex
[02:15:13.040 --> 02:15:16.640]  jones wishes he wasn't discredited alex jones is a racist
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:20.800]  with no proof but we know they're doing it
[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:26.000]  because they want to assassinate the messenger but the good news is
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:29.360]  they've already assassinated their own credibility so they're shooting blanks
[02:15:29.360 --> 02:15:33.360]  and i don't think in their arrogance they figured that out yet
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:37.360]  billy no i agree with you but just to give you a little bit of kind of
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:41.280]  the context on the other side of it right after the anderson cooper thing
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:44.320]  kind of went viral i know you put a story on your
[02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:48.480]  site and i gave a quote for that when that sort of kind of ticked back up into
[02:15:48.480 --> 02:15:52.080]  the mainstream consciousness i probably did about 10 interviews in the next
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:55.360]  couple days and in seven of the 10 interviews i was
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:58.960]  asked about the anderson cooper flap and five of the seven people
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:01.840]  interviewed me had no idea it was for a charity
[02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:05.280]  so that shows you that there is still a little effectiveness counting on that
[02:16:05.280 --> 02:16:09.120]  low information crowd that will be on headline that's it they are
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:13.920]  targeting a low information crowd but again that crowd of zombies
[02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:16.960]  really don't even matter anymore i mean i'm sad to say that's like they're almost
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:20.960]  not even people they've decided to just mindlessly buy into this
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:25.120]  and this narcissistic thin mindless gruel
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:28.880]  that's being spewed out but speaking speaking of anderson cooper and we're
[02:16:28.880 --> 02:16:31.040]  going to get into your album that i do think is one of your best
[02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:34.800]  in a long time speaking of anderson cooper he really
[02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:38.880]  is a cia guy he really was in the cia not just an intern
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:44.560]  he really is the grandson of one of the biggest dynasties in the country
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:48.240]  wasn't the asters so he's a little rich kid
[02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:52.720]  given everything he's got he's failed he has some of the worst ratings on cnn
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:57.280]  so i would feel good billy to just to have this this this joke this failure
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:00.320]  that was given everything i mean you came from nowhere i came from nowhere
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:05.200]  he was given everything he's the opposite of americana
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:09.680]  you know i think what's interesting um to me uh you know uh i tried to stay out
[02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:12.800]  of the personal side of it um although i didn't say the other day i wasn't born
[02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:17.680]  with a silver spoon on my arse like like he was um i think it's very
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:21.600]  interesting that um there is a level of arrogance here they
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:24.720]  that crowd whatever that crowd is and i've hung with them you know i've been
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:28.000]  in those rooms and so have you i've been to those parties and so have you
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.920]  that crowd really thinks they can sort of flick us off the shoulder anytime they
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:35.280]  want and what they don't realize is that people like you and me are we're just
[02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:40.080]  symbols of a much greater conversation they don't understand that a vast
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:44.480]  part of our country is waking up uh is breaking this hypnosis this grip of
[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:48.480]  hypnosis and they can't see it they literally can't see it they do not
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:51.440]  think they literally think they can just double down triple down on these
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:54.800]  narratives and these false paradigms and the public's just going to keep
[02:17:54.800 --> 02:18:00.160]  lapping them up uh and i think uh as we see from recent events people are
[02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:03.680]  starting to sort of question that the narratives and and and you see the media
[02:18:03.680 --> 02:18:08.080]  those old world media doubling triple quadrupling down on false
[02:18:08.080 --> 02:18:12.800]  uh storylines because they literally don't have a beat plan
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:16.320]  i agree with you and just the beginning of the questioning is the beginning of
[02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:20.320]  the end because as soon as you question you're no longer only in that narrow
[02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:24.320]  low information uh media system you now discover the
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:27.840]  wider world you come out of play does cave and it's game over
[02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:31.520]  that is such an incredibly exciting thing uh you know i think one of your
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:35.760]  songs the last album or the album before it was about the world on fire uh and
[02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:38.880]  the lyrics really spoke to this i remember we were talking like six years
[02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:41.440]  ago and you were saying if you can clearly see
[02:18:41.440 --> 02:18:45.440]  crisis after crisis coming which is now here but that out of that
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:49.200]  we really could see a new renaissance
[02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:52.640]  i think um i i i get the sense from talking to
[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:56.400]  my friends and family and i'm sure you know many of your listeners
[02:18:56.400 --> 02:19:00.080]  of course which i'm one of uh those conversations that we had around the
[02:19:00.080 --> 02:19:03.120]  dinner table seven years ago which were really difficult
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:06.160]  conversations to have and people would throw their hands up and say you're crazy
[02:19:06.160 --> 02:19:09.600]  now people are listening and just the fact that you're even able to sit at that
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:13.040]  table and have those conversations and be able to back it up
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:17.360]  with uh statistics and uh people uh you know the failure of this uh
[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:21.120]  a particular administration um the lying that goes on
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:24.640]  and and and the fact that there's this greater divide between the public that's
[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:28.080]  awake and the public that's asleep i mean those that are asleep really
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:32.000]  really do much must want to be asleep because i mean how could you not be
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.320]  eyes open at this point that's right how could you not be eyes open at this
[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:39.680]  point and his mother was a Vanderbilt the heir of the entire Vanderbilt
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:44.000]  fortune not not a not a um aster but doesn't matter
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.120]  they're interrelated and again nothing wrong with being
[02:19:47.120 --> 02:19:50.960]  the last male heir of one of the biggest robber baron
[02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:54.640]  horrible dynasties it's just give us a break anderson cooper because i don't
[02:19:54.640 --> 02:19:57.680]  even get into fighting with these personalities but at the same time i
[02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:00.720]  think it's important to not just respond and say hey i'm helping a cat
[02:20:00.720 --> 02:20:03.920]  charity leave me alone don't try to make me you know look like it has been when
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:07.040]  i'm not everybody knows that you've been popular all along
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:11.120]  and you've had big re-insurgences uh i mean it's just a joke i mean you've
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:15.200]  sold 40 million albums anderson cooper is on a failed network
[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:18.560]  that's converting to cooking shows so i'm not being nasty
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:21.760]  it's just they are dancing on their own graves
[02:20:21.760 --> 02:20:26.000]  when you are just having the courage to express what's already there and as you
[02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:29.920]  said we're like little tips of iceberg sticking up or little focal points as
[02:20:29.920 --> 02:20:34.480]  ron paul always says well i mean we're nothing we are just like everybody else
[02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:39.040]  that is trying to find out what the hell is really going on
[02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:42.960]  i can't disagree with you and i think there's a democratization there
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:46.480]  in the way that we're all communicating and uh you know thank god for people
[02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:50.720]  like you for building these new systems by which we're sharing information
[02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:54.000]  and uh you know we're building up our own networks of communication i mean
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:58.000]  i mean basically uh i would argue we're past the tipping point and now it's just
[02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:01.280]  how is this all going to play out and as you've been predicting for
[02:21:01.280 --> 02:21:04.720]  i don't know how many years now we're seeing the rolling out of this
[02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:10.080]  this next wave of control and propaganda um but the fact of the matter is that
[02:21:10.080 --> 02:21:14.160]  everyone's so prepared and has been sort of mentally prepared for what's
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:16.800]  coming um i just want to point out one small thing
[02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:19.600]  because i think it's important in the in the context of the conversation we're
[02:21:19.600 --> 02:21:22.160]  having you know when uh when uh president obama was
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:26.480]  elected uh that night i went on stage and i and i and i knew i was already
[02:21:26.480 --> 02:21:30.480]  listening to you i was kind of like a half awake let's put it and i went on
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:33.440]  stage and i said let's hopefully let's hope let's hope this is the sign that
[02:21:33.440 --> 02:21:35.840]  things are going to go in the right direction and you actually ran a piece
[02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:38.960]  so we didn't know each other then you use a piece kind of mocking me or being
[02:21:38.960 --> 02:21:43.360]  another celebrity sort of buying drinking the kool-aid and um and i was
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:46.080]  thinking back to that time i wasn't offended by the by the piece i thought it
[02:21:46.080 --> 02:21:49.680]  was kind of funny but um i'm never thinking back at the time where i was
[02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:54.000]  in my own kind of awakening and um you know we have to remember those of us
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.120]  that are awake there are so many people that are they're in that horrible
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:22:00.880]  moment of like wow if this stuff is true what do i do
[02:22:00.880 --> 02:22:04.480]  and uh we see that more and more now you see people waking up and it's it's
[02:22:04.480 --> 02:22:08.640]  really shocking to them that they've been given a lie sort of all along
[02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:12.400]  and uh as you sit in bars and you know around coffee houses and talk to people
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:16.080]  about what's really going on you can see that it's it's not so much that they
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:18.800]  don't know that something's happening they just don't know what to do about it
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:21.280]  so we have to continue to prepare the way
[02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:25.440]  and uh and uh you know this is not some begging appeal you know to be supported
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:28.960]  as an artist but what i would say to everybody is is the artist in many ways
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:31.760]  are some of the most dangerous people in the world because we have that we have
[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:34.640]  that street credibility to go out and sing some gospel
[02:22:34.640 --> 02:22:38.080]  and uh and that's what makes me dangerous is once i get what's my career
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:41.760]  starts rolling in the right direction again well here i come because well how
[02:22:41.760 --> 02:22:45.040]  is it possible i mean they've tried to kill me how many times
[02:22:45.040 --> 02:22:48.160]  uh and you know the Anderson Cooper is just a small example get kicked in the
[02:22:48.160 --> 02:22:52.080]  shin um and so it really helps and i'm not begging for
[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:56.240]  my own self but but please support artists to support free voices to support
[02:22:56.240 --> 02:23:00.640]  people like alex to keep speaking out to and and it does require
[02:23:00.640 --> 02:23:03.680]  material support like i'm a supporter of what you're doing with info uh
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:06.800]  went for his life right is that what's called absolutely yeah
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:10.160]  Billy i want to shift gears and talk about this more deeply because
[02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:14.000]  and i use this analogy too much i apologize this but but it's so accurate i
[02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.480]  use it 20 years ago you couldn't find organic food
[02:23:16.480 --> 02:23:19.680]  anywhere it was very expensive if you could because there was no market
[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:22.960]  as people began to demand it it grew the market prices went down
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:26.720]  it's now displacing all the garbage it's displacing the high fructose corn
[02:23:26.720 --> 02:23:31.360]  syrup they're taking it out of Hershey's we're taking it out of Heinz
[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:34.560]  now now look there's still some fake organic there's still problems
[02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:38.320]  the point is we demanded quality the market changed
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:42.480]  and exactly if people go out and support independent artists that are
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:45.040]  speaking out against tyranny that's great music as well
[02:23:45.040 --> 02:23:48.960]  and buy your album at smashing pumpkins nexus dot com
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:52.560]  and then play it for friends and then ask that it be played on the radio
[02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:56.320]  or share it with their friends that's how you bring
[02:23:56.320 --> 02:24:01.280]  the system down you've got to go further and decide you want to promote
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:03.840]  cultures of liberty i can't tell you historically
[02:24:03.840 --> 02:24:08.080]  how many kings how many corrupt dynasties were brought down
[02:24:08.080 --> 02:24:12.160]  by a gesture telling jokes that became viral
[02:24:12.160 --> 02:24:19.760]  in ancient times or by the local band or even one guy with his
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:22.800]  uh they didn't have guitars back then you know one guy with his little
[02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:26.640]  mandolin or whatever singing songs about the corrupt nobility
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:30.000]  that would change it so so a song or an idea
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:33.440]  that isn't in the hands of the system could bring them down
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:36.560]  and that's why they target people like you
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:40.240]  yeah you look there's there was a reason the cia uh was you know spying on
[02:24:40.240 --> 02:24:44.320]  john lennon you know um you know at that point time he was probably the most
[02:24:44.320 --> 02:24:48.800]  dangerous artist in the world um all they killed him too
[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:52.240]  well you know i can't speak to that but i i'll say this much
[02:24:52.240 --> 02:24:55.920]  um if you look at the power that rock and roll had
[02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:59.280]  in the 70s vis-a-vis the power that rock and roll has now
[02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:03.840]  i think there's been a concerted effort to to uh drain that those systems of their
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:06.880]  power um because it's just too radical it's just too
[02:25:06.880 --> 02:25:10.720]  dangerous and and and there's you know when you when you have the power of uh
[02:25:10.720 --> 02:25:13.920]  of a john lennon or bar marley and they can literally have one song that will
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:16.880]  change the consciousness of the world and get people to look at something
[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:20.640]  different and i would point and i and i'm saying this from a very specific
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:25.200]  point of view look at the lack of political music in the
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:28.880]  world right now and compare that to the 1960s it is
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:34.080]  unbelievable the lack of political and social discourse in music right now you
[02:25:34.080 --> 02:25:37.360]  think that's a basic that's a no an accidental omission
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:40.640]  they came in and they took it over on record billy corgan of smashing
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:44.480]  pumpkin's fame is our guest smashing pumpkins nexus dot com
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:48.000]  we're going to send out a tweet uh of the website right now we're going to post
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.400]  this video later today on facebook and twitter
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:53.920]  it needs to go viral because he has a lot of courage saying what he's saying
[02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:56.240]  because they really come after people i gotta be
[02:25:56.240 --> 02:26:00.320]  very careful here what i'm gonna say about john lennon but they made a film
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:03.760]  six seven years ago that won a bunch of awards that had the declassified
[02:26:03.760 --> 02:26:06.320]  documents were strong firm in the senator and others said
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:09.760]  we want him taken out we know the suspicious way it was killed
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:13.200]  i'm i'm just going to stop right there but
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:17.520]  i i i've talked to the highest level people
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:20.640]  and been told stuff about what really went on and then what happened to them
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:23.200]  afterwards and everything and i can tell you
[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:27.360]  the fbi and the cia killed john lennon and then they went on a campaign to cover
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:30.960]  up what they did with their patsy and so that's why when we talk about this
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:34.880]  folks it's very dangerous i mean so so we're not saying hey we're heroes here
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:38.160]  we're just saying realize this isn't just your regular
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:43.520]  you know shuck and jive on cnn i mean we're really laying it out here
[02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:46.640]  i think um i think what's kind of funny about the modern life is i don't think
[02:26:46.640 --> 02:26:50.240]  they have to kill you anymore i think they just digitally kill you that's right
[02:26:50.240 --> 02:26:53.520]  i mean if anything you're almost you're almost better as a sort of sort of
[02:26:53.520 --> 02:26:57.600]  living effigy which is why i think some of these people come out of the woodwork
[02:26:57.600 --> 02:27:01.360]  to try to like split my throat i mean criticize me as an artist that's fine
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:04.640]  that there's there's plenty to criticize but if you look at a lot of the subtext
[02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:06.960]  of the of the things that have written about an artist like me
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:10.400]  it has a lot of a lot of time it gets a lot of sort of false narratives
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:13.520]  uh moral equivalencies that have nothing to do
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:17.760]  with music or art or love or people's lives
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:22.000]  you just said it you just said it they create straw men that aren't alex jones
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:26.000]  or billy corgan and then they attribute things we didn't say
[02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:29.120]  they have they have these campaigns they send out fake emails that aren't for me
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:32.960]  insulting people they call people up and say it's me and insult them famous
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:36.960]  people uh they uh spoof faxes and i know it's the
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:40.640]  government corporation so believe me well what billy's talking about
[02:27:40.640 --> 02:27:44.320]  it goes on here all the time in in an attempt
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:48.800]  to to derail us but it's not gonna work because billy corgan and alex jones
[02:27:48.800 --> 02:27:53.600]  are just little bitty expressions like like a compound eye of a dragonfly
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:58.720]  we're just one little tiny part of it you can't chop off all the heads
[02:27:58.720 --> 02:28:01.520]  totally agree with you and and one thing i would add to that because i know
[02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:04.000]  sometimes when i talk like this to people they think well
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:07.600]  are you saying that everyone who works at the local paper has done it no
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:11.760]  if these systems are put in place and then they go out and they find
[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:15.200]  people who are not free thinkers to basically implement
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:19.200]  the program um they regurgitate the national story
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:22.640]  they're already the little sycophantic type that'll go with whatever the
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:27.280]  mindless pop culture narrative is absolutely and i and i've even had
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:30.800]  off-record conversations like i know you have where people have admitted to me
[02:28:30.800 --> 02:28:34.800]  where they've had stories squashed oh yeah um you know somebody makes a juice
[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:38.720]  call and make sure a story is squashed or a particular agenda is promoted
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:42.480]  so when you're looking at uh you know your local media and you see and you
[02:28:42.480 --> 02:28:45.600]  and you go well this smells like propaganda know that more than likely
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:50.640]  that person is not conscious they are in a they put in been put in that position
[02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:53.600]  because they they're a proven boo liquor
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:57.360]  almost all local news is written in new york or
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:29:00.640]  la rdc this is on record and packaged and sent
[02:29:00.640 --> 02:29:04.240]  you tell them a local story and then they send down what you say
[02:29:04.240 --> 02:29:07.920]  or it's read off a teleprompter if it's a national story
[02:29:07.920 --> 02:29:11.680]  right so so if there's a if you know there's a man in a high castle somewhere
[02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:15.360]  uh you know there's not a lot of them but they're they're able to through their
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:18.640]  um their control and their and their media control sort of manipulate the
[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:21.600]  storyline we look your listeners know uh you know and i'm a
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:24.960]  listener uh you know we know it these things are i mean we
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:27.920]  sit back look when when when when when ferguson
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:31.680]  started to boil over and you you know you had uh jacari and uh
[02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:34.800]  big jill big down there you know i was watching some of the coverage
[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:37.440]  and it's really interesting you know because and it's so important that you

[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:09.040]  issues they don't like what they call loose cannons
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:12.800]  they want people that will submit and go along with their whole agenda

[02:34:24.880 --> 02:34:27.840]  for
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:31.200]  yeah it's great i found that in uh somewhere outside of san francisco
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:34.880]  and it was like it was like sitting on a shelf and i thought oh my god i
[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:39.040]  can get this for alex that is awesome billy i i want to get back in what you
[02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:41.600]  said about fergusson and more on the album before you have to leave us in
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:43.760]  that airport you're sitting in right now
[02:34:43.760 --> 02:34:48.160]  but tommy lee i had heard from folks that he was awake
[02:34:48.160 --> 02:34:50.880]  i had heard from somebody that worked with him on a tv show behind the scenes
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:53.680]  that he was all aware of the new world order i don't i know you don't want to
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:34:56.320]  speak for him personally but can you repeat what you told me during the
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:00.240]  break no tommy's you know tommy's eyes are wide open
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:03.440]  you know and you you talked a lot of artists off record and you know you and
[02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:07.840]  i've talked about that i mean i think uh the general public would be shocked
[02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:10.960]  how much of the entertainment world um is awake
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:13.440]  and it's because they're behind the wizards curtain
[02:35:13.440 --> 02:35:16.480]  joe perry's fully awake joe perry's fully awake i
[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:20.720]  i need to call him today but uh a lot of folks are go ahead
[02:35:20.720 --> 02:35:24.320]  yeah i think i think the difficulty is these paradigms have been set up where
[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:26.240]  it's like you know you have to stare down the
[02:35:26.240 --> 02:35:29.200]  barrel of a particular gun in this case your career
[02:35:29.200 --> 02:35:32.400]  um like i said i mean what's the new what's the new paradigm you're gonna
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:34.640]  get digitally assassinated you know what i mean
[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:37.920]  um i know there would be some people particularly in a rock and roll world
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:40.160]  that'll roll their eyes at these kind of assertions
[02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:43.360]  but there's a reason that that the that the great artists
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:47.120]  uh get marginalized they get sucked into things that have nothing to do with
[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:50.880]  their music and you know they're i'm literally everything i say now is
[02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:53.840]  trolled for quotes you know and i'm not saying it's all
[02:35:53.840 --> 02:35:57.200]  political some of it's just dumb stuff but the but the fact that
[02:35:57.200 --> 02:36:00.320]  there is this whole uh business is risen up around
[02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:04.560]  entertainment it's big business but it ultimately is about the disenfranchising
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:07.520]  of the artist a vote in the culture in that sense
[02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:10.720]  the constant messages artist voices don't matter
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:15.280]  um well exactly when you look at like what a jimmy hinders represented as
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:18.560]  opposed to your normal average politician okay you tell me who's the more
[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:22.800]  honorable person well it's obviously jimmy hinders following
[02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:27.760]  his soul his heart trailblazing uh creating a heavy rock heavy metal
[02:36:27.760 --> 02:36:32.160]  i'm a true pioneer right and so that's what i'm trying to say is
[02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:36.400]  is uh from cradle to grave you know there are systems in place
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:40.640]  you know you pick them uh you know now it's common core uh you know uh
[02:36:40.640 --> 02:36:44.080]  you know uh the the scholarship programs all this
[02:36:44.080 --> 02:36:47.840]  they're meant to take anybody who's uh too bright too smart and make sure
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:50.400]  they're corralled into a system from the get go
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:53.760]  and uh god forbid you exist outside that system
[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:57.760]  and and and prosper uh as you and i have and bless the lord for the
[02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:01.280]  the gifts he's given us and i think both of us and i know we've talked about
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:05.040]  this we feel a great responsibility to turn those gifts around to serve others
[02:37:05.040 --> 02:37:08.720]  and and uh if it kills us it kills us but at the end of the day
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:11.600]  uh we've got to trust the you know the band upstairs
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:15.520]  uh that you know there's a greater purpose here at play and
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:20.080]  and and if if what if we want you to put what we watch on the old uh you know
[02:37:20.080 --> 02:37:23.840]  the old systems the old uh the mainstream media system if that if that's
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:27.040]  true i don't want to live in that world anyway
[02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:30.400]  that's beautifully said i don't want to live in that world anyway because it is
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:34.480]  a fraud it is a lie i feel so empowered
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:37.040]  not that i have all the answers i make a lot of mistakes i say stupid stuff
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:40.000]  sometimes i mean i hear my show rebroadcast and go oh my god that
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.720]  sounds horrible i don't mean that but but at the same time
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:47.120]  my heart's true i'm trying to tell the truth and and more of what i say turns
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:50.080]  out to be accurate than what dinosaur media says and it
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:53.440]  resonates with people and then i just don't want to let them down it's
[02:37:53.440 --> 02:37:57.280]  humbling to know there's so many good people that are awake now and and
[02:37:57.280 --> 02:37:59.920]  looking for me for leadership or whoever i don't think that's where the
[02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:01.920]  leadership is it's in our hearts it's in our
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:04.880]  souls it's in following our gut it's in doing the
[02:38:04.880 --> 02:38:08.560]  right thing and it's in doing the opposite of what mainstream
[02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:11.680]  dinosaur media says i i want to ask you about this
[02:38:11.680 --> 02:38:15.360]  where do you and your gut billy as you say the world's on fire a previous
[02:38:15.360 --> 02:38:18.880]  album where do you and your gut think civilization's
[02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:22.640]  really going are we going to survive will we make it to the next renaissance
[02:38:22.640 --> 02:38:25.040]  and beyond and and what do you think that fight's
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:31.040]  going to look like you know i i um i hold my breath on that one
[02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:35.600]  uh you know there's a big fight coming uh you know it's one thing to listen you
[02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:39.600]  talk about FEMA documents and uh you know executive
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:43.040]  orders that we don't know about and uh yesterday i think you had on your site
[02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:46.160]  about the this idea that it's now legal to spy on everyone
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:49.680]  everywhere for the end time and all this kind of stuff
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:52.720]  um you know these systems are going to double and triple down
[02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:58.400]  um because because they have no uh alternate plan you understand uh they've
[02:38:58.400 --> 02:39:02.240]  been in power for a very long time and whoever's pulling those levers
[02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:06.400]  uh is is not they're not uh they're not they're you know look when a baseball
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:09.760]  team loses they go i will come back next year we'll rebuild now these guys are in
[02:39:09.760 --> 02:39:13.840]  it to win um and uh and you know sometimes when
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:17.360]  i'm sitting around a table and uh and your name comes up i say some things
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:20.720]  that i've learned through you and through other people um they get into like
[02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:24.400]  kind of games about accuracy like well how can you know that that's true
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:27.680]  and all i gotta say again and again is like look come on something something's
[02:39:27.680 --> 02:39:30.720]  off here something's wrong and people like you people like me
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:35.360]  we don't have to be accurate that's not our job our job is not to be perfect we
[02:39:35.360 --> 02:39:38.720]  don't hold ourselves to be up to be perfect we don't hold ourselves up to be
[02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:42.160]  uh you know uh keepers or tooth tellers or something like that
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:44.560]  we're just pointing it as you often say you know you're just pointing and
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:48.400]  saying uh do you see that big thing just coming down the road i do
[02:39:48.400 --> 02:39:52.640]  exactly and i say well what exactly is it how do we know your eyes are authorized
[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:56.480]  to say that's a juggernaut with fire shooting out of it out of road warrior
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:39:59.200]  and i'm like uh well i came by another village they said
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:03.680]  something that looked like that blew it up uh so that thing looks scary what are
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:08.560]  we gonna do about it and yeah and again i would i would recommend
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:12.800]  anybody the same thing we don't we i'm so i could you know the collective world
[02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:16.000]  that's awake you know it's extended even beyond your audience
[02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:20.880]  we don't have to be right we don't have to be accurate we know what wrong is
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:24.480]  we know what wrong is and we know a lot of what's going on is wrong
[02:40:24.480 --> 02:40:28.240]  you know well sure they have the fake moral authority where where accuracy in
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:31.200]  media or where uh media matters room of the
[02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:34.720]  white house or where uh you know they have that
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:38.240]  truth detector site or snopes you know run by
[02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:42.000]  you know a couple in an apartment they sit on the mountain and they say
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:45.600]  what reality is and i mean anybody that starts
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:48.960]  telling you they have a corner on reality well that's who you really gotta
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:53.520]  watch hey if if we reach a point as a as a race
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:56.800]  well we do not grieve the loss of every child
[02:40:56.800 --> 02:40:59.920]  i don't care what color i don't care where they're from
[02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:02.400]  you know what i mean if we don't grieve the loss of our child that's that's
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:06.800]  that's an indictment of us you know and we've got to be protesting for every
[02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:10.160]  child every situation uh you know we need to have
[02:41:10.160 --> 02:41:13.840]  moral outrage where there's injustice everywhere
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:17.520]  um and then when we see agendas at play we have to step back and say why is this
[02:41:17.520 --> 02:41:22.400]  more important than everything else um we have to grieve for all of these
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:25.440]  things we have to grieve for the gmo's we have to grieve for the chem
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:29.440]  trails we have to grieve for all this crap that we have to face down
[02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:32.960]  um and we have to pull together that's what i mean we don't have to be right
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:36.080]  we don't have to be right we just have to know as long as we know that's the
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:40.800]  power um and and i'm blessed to be one voice in
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:45.280]  in the wilderness at least a free thinker um there are times where it's very
[02:41:45.280 --> 02:41:47.600]  difficult in a musical life to struggle
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:50.560]  where you know the numbers don't add up and you don't get the advantage that you
[02:41:50.560 --> 02:41:54.000]  think you should get all these things and and it and those are those hard days
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.720]  where you got to stare in the mirror and say would i rather be on my knees
[02:41:56.720 --> 02:42:00.000]  subjugated to some system that would ask me to be a
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:03.680]  robot muppet something or would i rather be a free thinker
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:06.640]  and that's what i would say i'm proud to be a free thinker and if that means
[02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:10.640]  what it means uh uh you know a half full hall somewhere that's what it means
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:14.160]  because i'm i can't go down any other way well you know my favorite quote by
[02:42:14.160 --> 02:42:18.240]  mark twain he had a lot of great ones in the beginning of patriotism scarce man
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:21.840]  hated feared and scorned but in time when his cause succeeds the timet
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:24.800]  joined him then it cost nothing to be a patriot
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:28.880]  i was on over a hundred radio stations that was just unheard of
[02:42:28.880 --> 02:42:35.040]  when i was like you know 26 27 years old uh and 9 11 happened and it was just
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:39.200]  unheard of and i was on a hundred stations small mom and pop some of them
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:42.880]  but high ratings and i was growing and then the
[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:46.080]  towers got blown up and i said no the government's clearly involved and those
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:49.280]  stations all called most of them they said we're going to turn you off next
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:53.440]  week or we're turning off next month on the contracts up using monthly contracts
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:58.640]  if you don't stop it right now and you know what i didn't feel bad at all
[02:42:58.640 --> 02:43:01.360]  when ted aanderson came in and he said all these stations are turning you off
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:05.920]  he just lost 10 today uh they're warning you you got to stop now
[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:09.440]  and i said ted i just can't stop and it's the truth and he said i really
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:12.720]  respect that uh alex he goes fine you you know you have a place here on the
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:16.960]  network uh you know we're going to lose at the network at that time
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:20.560]  millions of dollars uh over the you know years and back then i was making
[02:43:20.560 --> 02:43:24.000]  hardly any money and i and he said you know you would get
[02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:27.200]  you know that but he goes i respect that and he goes so i'll lose millions
[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:30.480]  you're going to lose millions because i just hit the site guys i'd just gone
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:33.520]  from like 20 stations to over a hundred it was boom spreading all over the
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:36.640]  country because it was hardcore libertarian the right wingers liked it
[02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:40.240]  but i came out and spoke bad about their god george bush
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:43.760]  and and and i didn't even say he did it all i just said look the government's
[02:43:43.760 --> 02:43:46.080]  running al-qaeda they let him attack experiment on them
[02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:49.520]  and and i'm proud of that and it's just like i'm proud of what you've done
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:53.280]  but then i only got bigger down the road but then it only gets scarier
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:56.960]  because then it's not even about being on the air or being famous it is all
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:44:00.640]  about the struggle for reality and trying to find that truth i think
[02:44:00.640 --> 02:44:04.080]  that's what you're saying it's not that we're perfect or always right we want
[02:44:04.080 --> 02:44:07.200]  the truth and we have goodwill towards others i think we're talking about the
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:11.760]  philosophy the philosophy of those of us that want to be free
[02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:14.480]  well i think it was back to your question of what what do i think is
[02:44:14.480 --> 02:44:17.600]  going to happen and this is this is where it gets into a very tricky
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:21.040]  juncture we have to see what's happening but
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:24.720]  at the same time we have to be able to kind of step back and look at the larger
[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:28.640]  narrative at play if there are nefarious forces in the
[02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:31.920]  world they're they are willing to use our humanity against this they are
[02:44:31.920 --> 02:44:35.920]  basically sociopathic they don't care that babies die
[02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:39.840]  somewhere in the middle of some desert they don't care
[02:44:39.840 --> 02:44:44.160]  you know that kids are taking vaccines with the horrible things in them
[02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:47.360]  they don't care about the rise in autism rate they're willing to do whatever
[02:44:47.360 --> 02:44:50.720]  however i mean they've proven that again and again and again
[02:44:50.720 --> 02:44:53.920]  so this is where we cannot get sucked into these
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:57.440]  false moral arguments those arguments are important
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:01.040]  you know like in talking recently about some of the things that have gone on
[02:45:01.040 --> 02:45:04.880]  the protests that are happening post uh uh is it mr garner with the man's
[02:45:04.880 --> 02:45:08.080]  name yes choke terrible uh and then the horrible
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:10.640]  situation and then what obviously what happened in berguson
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:13.520]  and you know you can these discussions like i said around the dinner table
[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:17.440]  and people think that you're uh unsentimental or unfeeling and no it's
[02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:20.560]  no these are horrible of course there's injustice
[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:24.560]  uh in the inner cities of course uh you know does that mean every cops the bad
[02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:28.160]  guy you stay at all the time i know lots of great cops i know lots of great cops
[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:31.040]  for family people that would never do these things does that mean every cops
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:33.600]  good or bad no we have to judge every person on their
[02:45:33.600 --> 02:45:37.120]  moral character uh i'm you know somewhat friendly with the
[02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:41.040]  police chief of the chicago police department gary mccarthy incredible
[02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:44.960]  man incredible man i watch where he greaves uh over
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:49.120]  every situation uh because he's a he's a man he's a
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:52.640]  father he cares does that doesn't mean just because he puts on the uniform
[02:45:52.640 --> 02:45:56.560]  does he mean he's a bad guy i mean what about our soldiers are all our
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:45:59.280]  soldiers bad absolutely not this narrative that's spun out all and all
[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:02.240]  of a sudden we got to be afraid of the soldiers i'll take a soldier over
[02:46:02.240 --> 02:46:06.400]  anybody any day exactly they've tried to dumb it down
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:10.320]  to the opposite of what martin loser king said judge people on their deeds
[02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:14.640]  and what they stand for what you just said and then if you don't support all
[02:46:14.640 --> 02:46:17.680]  the rioting or whatever you support the first amendment but not rioting
[02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:21.360]  then you're bad if you don't say kill the cops randomly
[02:46:21.360 --> 02:46:24.880]  well i don't want to be killed randomly i don't want to be i don't want to see
[02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:27.840]  the blacks killed just because they're black or whites killed i mean it just
[02:46:27.840 --> 02:46:31.680]  comes down to civilization and basic common sense now billy
[02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:35.280]  let's talk about your album we just downloaded it
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:38.240]  the other day from your site smashing pumpkins nexus
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:41.840]  dot com i can't wait to listen to the whole thing i i'm not just saying this i
[02:46:41.840 --> 02:46:44.400]  love all your albums and i really love your old stuff
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:48.320]  this has a lot of the old sound but even better lyrics i think this is almost
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:52.800]  like classic smashing pumpkins 2.0 everybody should go there
[02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:57.760]  how do people get the record uh you know it's on all the typical uh
[02:46:57.760 --> 02:47:02.000]  illuminati systems it's easy to find that's not the
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:05.920]  issue uh but thank you so much for that sure i mean it's in the stores it's on
[02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:09.040]  cd it's downloaded at itunes folks can go find
[02:47:09.040 --> 02:47:12.640]  those links to smashing pumpkins nexus dot com how do people support you i
[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:16.080]  guess they come to the big shows uh they spread the word
[02:47:16.080 --> 02:47:21.920]  i mean how do they do that you know um that's a difficult one because uh
[02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:26.320]  there is um there is the commerce which uh is important but honestly it's more
[02:47:26.320 --> 02:47:30.560]  the street caching um uh and that's what i'm saying is uh
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:34.880]  if not me please find artists that you support uh retweet them
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:39.280]  share them with your friends the artists are the bulwark
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:43.040]  uh there's a reason most totalitarian regimes kill the artists second
[02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:46.960]  of course they kill the weakest first and then they go after the strongest which
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:49.840]  are the artists because they they are the x-factor
[02:47:49.840 --> 02:47:53.440]  they're the voice in the wilderness that can point out the obvious
[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:58.400]  like hey look at that over there you know and they can do it in a very clever way
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:01.440]  you know if jesus spoke in parable so can we
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:05.440]  um and and it's very powerful music as you know penetrates like
[02:48:05.440 --> 02:48:08.800]  you know typical stuff which is why i'm able to go to countries where people
[02:48:08.800 --> 02:48:11.280]  don't even speak english and play music and communicate
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:15.440]  if music at the heart um and i'm blessed to you know 25
[02:48:15.440 --> 02:48:19.040]  plus years here and going still strong stronger than ever
[02:48:19.040 --> 02:48:23.760]  billy corgan's our guest smashing pumpkins nexus dot com retweet that put it on facebook
[02:48:23.760 --> 02:48:27.920]  folks the establishment scared of him and anybody the system scared of
[02:48:27.920 --> 02:48:32.080]  you better know we need to get behind because they promote terrorist groups
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:35.920]  they fund al-qaeda they they fund all these radical groups they get caught
[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:38.800]  funding the clan they get caught funding radical racist
[02:48:38.800 --> 02:48:41.600]  black groups they want us all killing each other
[02:48:41.600 --> 02:48:45.600]  just like uh one of the singers uh that you know he just mentioned
[02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:50.080]  from jamaica said uh they want to see us go on killing one another
[02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:53.760]  top ranking and that's of course bob marley
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:56.480]  we're almost out of time i'm gonna let you go so you can get that plane or get
[02:48:56.480 --> 02:48:59.200]  on down the road billy i hope you'll come down to austin soon
[02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:02.640]  and come in studio maybe i'll come up see in chicago uh but i really know your
[02:49:02.640 --> 02:49:08.080]  interviews here resonate with everybody uh again uh one more time the new album
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:13.600]  tell us what the name of the album means monuments to an elegy what's that mean
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:16.960]  oh i don't know alex if these things come out of my brain sideways
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:21.280]  um i don't know well sounds cool i just wanted to have some inside baseball to
[02:49:21.280 --> 02:49:24.560]  that uh you know i to me it's a bit of a kind of
[02:49:24.560 --> 02:49:28.080]  a way to buy to what people thought the band was and uh
[02:49:28.080 --> 02:49:31.600]  and uh you know just trying to move on into the future and uh
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:35.120]  you know thankfully with people like you new media like you creating these new
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:38.480]  systems i'm able to speak freely and speak to an
[02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:41.920]  audience and and just look you know try to find like-minded souls we have to
[02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:46.800]  build these new systems you are uh and uh and i'm trying to do the same you know
[02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:50.320]  we have to build basically systems that are stronger than these systems of
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:54.400]  propaganda control and we will we will we will survive and we will be
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:58.400]  well it's happening and you know as you said we need to support
[02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:02.560]  artists what whether it was in nazi germany or whether it was in any other
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:07.120]  cell train regime polpot kemer Rouge they would kill 95 percent of the artist
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:10.240]  even ones that served them they didn't like having them around they were scared
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:12.960]  of them because that beauty that touching people
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:16.960]  through music through art through images that communication of art types
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:20.240]  that that artist have innately don't even know what you're doing you just do it
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:24.320]  and it reaches people they are scared of that and that's what the tyrants are
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:28.560]  is little men behind the curtain who want to run the whole show and and really
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:32.000]  i guess don't feel loved or liked they feel rejected so they want to dominate
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:36.720]  billy i'll say bye to you during the break 20 second final comment
