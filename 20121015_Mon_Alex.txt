[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:38.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.120 --> 00:44.840]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Monday edition the
[00:44.840 --> 00:51.920]  15th day of October 2012 we are less than three weeks out from the 2012
[00:51.920 --> 00:56.800]  presidential election and yes it's a dog and pony show in every sense of the way
[00:56.800 --> 01:03.000]  it's a donkey an elephant show in every sense of the way both men I've never
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.440]  seen presidents that are more closely aligned presidential candidates than
[01:07.440 --> 01:13.840]  Barack Obama aka Barry Cetero and Mittens Romney Mitt Romney but there is
[01:13.840 --> 01:19.280]  certainly a fight by the different groups that feed off of the two political
[01:19.280 --> 01:23.040]  party system there is a real fight between those two groups over who gets
[01:23.040 --> 01:30.080]  control and we posted an article at info wars.com over the weekend that got
[01:30.080 --> 01:37.920]  linked up at drudgerport.com saying will there be riots an economic collapse
[01:37.920 --> 01:44.840]  blog story will there be riots if Obama doesn't win and then linking to a bunch
[01:44.840 --> 01:49.000]  of Twitter and Facebook posts with people saying they plan to riot and then I
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.760]  found Thomas Sowell a few days before the journalist was saying that that was
[01:53.760 --> 01:59.680]  the intel he had in a print article but also on the radio he said that on KABC
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.680]  and then we found a Chicago papers talking about it and we found the
[02:04.680 --> 02:09.720]  examiner from like five six days ago reporting on it well I started doing
[02:09.720 --> 02:16.040]  some research Saturday and Sunday and found so many websites news sites
[02:16.040 --> 02:21.800]  Twitter Facebook and these aren't dummy accounts these aren't these aren't people
[02:21.800 --> 02:25.200]  that are you know out there spoofing and making fun of people and then some of
[02:25.200 --> 02:28.320]  that undoubtedly goes on these are Facebook and Twitter accounts with
[02:28.320 --> 02:33.960]  thousands of tweets so 8,000 20,000 you know 5,000 tweets Facebooks with tens of
[02:33.960 --> 02:40.680]  thousands of followers with real people saying they're going to engage in
[02:40.680 --> 02:43.600]  racial attacks that they're going to kill people they're gonna burn things
[02:43.600 --> 02:47.760]  Obama doesn't win and and this is so horrible because then you've got not
[02:47.760 --> 02:51.200]  just black racist over there some of them doing that you've got white race
[02:51.200 --> 02:56.240]  just going yeah bring it on let's get a war going let's put black people in
[02:56.240 --> 03:01.680]  FEMA camps that's the type of stuff that's in the article up at info wars.com
[03:01.680 --> 03:06.320]  with the election results cause massive riots to erupt all over America there's
[03:06.320 --> 03:12.880]  almost 3,000 comments in there and there's trolls probably blacks posing as
[03:12.880 --> 03:17.000]  white racist probably whites posing as black racist trolling is just so
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.840]  disgusting in there trying to get something stirred up the point is we've
[03:21.840 --> 03:27.240]  seen riots in other parts of the world and here via politics and election
[03:27.240 --> 03:32.680]  results and this is a dead heat between Obama and Romney right now and so if
[03:32.680 --> 03:37.040]  they have another contested election like happened in 2000 with Al Gore and
[03:37.040 --> 03:41.520]  George W. Bush I do predict that if it's contested you're gonna see massive
[03:41.520 --> 03:47.880]  civil unrest and if the police stand down when looters or groups use this as
[03:47.880 --> 03:52.320]  an excuse to go out and engage in mayhem like criminals do and when their
[03:52.320 --> 03:55.840]  sports team loses or wins they go out and riot you've seen that all over the
[03:55.840 --> 04:02.920]  country you've seen that just all over the nation groups going out multi racial
[04:02.920 --> 04:07.720]  groups black white Hispanic Asian you name it after sports teams win or lose
[04:07.720 --> 04:12.440]  now you saw the Red Sox win a few years ago was it five years ago already time
[04:12.440 --> 04:15.920]  flies and there was a huge group of black white Hispanic you name it out
[04:15.920 --> 04:19.440]  there you know going wild and the cops come out and rubber bullet and you know
[04:19.440 --> 04:25.240]  kill some innocent woman it's a mess and we don't want this but this is what
[04:25.240 --> 04:29.200]  Thomas soul away it was like five six days ago he said this like last Wednesday
[04:29.200 --> 04:34.040]  so try to get him on he's black and he's following these sites and he's saying
[04:34.040 --> 04:40.600]  no I predict this will happen of Obama loses shampoos like Rasmussen have have
[04:40.600 --> 04:46.360]  Mitt Romney pulling ahead so whereas it's all a big show doesn't matter you know
[04:46.360 --> 04:50.080]  there are riots at rock and roll concerts you know you can get this out
[04:50.080 --> 04:54.040]  of this political show this for this political reality show we're gonna be

[07:10.040 --> 07:13.680]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[07:13.680 --> 07:17.600]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not
[07:17.600 --> 07:20.720]  sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[07:20.720 --> 07:23.600]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for
[07:23.600 --> 07:26.800]  fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[07:26.800 --> 07:31.440]  culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented porges Koreans
[07:31.440 --> 07:35.520]  eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's

[08:39.760 --> 08:44.680]  calls themselves the globalists from the New World Order who are absolutely
[08:44.680 --> 08:49.200]  dedicated to planetary corporate above the law government where they put
[08:49.200 --> 08:54.720]  giant laws and regulations on us violate our basic liberties enslave us and they
[08:54.720 --> 09:00.320]  themselves are exempt from their own system and that is what we are facing
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.520]  thank you for joining us on this Monday October 15th 2012 edition it is going to
[09:05.520 --> 09:11.760]  be an extremely important broadcast today there's just so much crazy news out
[09:11.760 --> 09:18.720]  there like this child suspended from school for kombucha in lunchbox it was
[09:18.720 --> 09:28.560]  less than what what point two percent alcohol there are so many fermented foods
[09:28.560 --> 09:33.120]  that have a tiny amounts of alcohol in it they call the police on them and the
[09:33.120 --> 09:41.320]  police are looking at possibly arresting a child now you also have in New York
[09:41.320 --> 09:46.360]  lawsuits being filed over the government saying it's going to track a 16 ounce
[09:46.360 --> 09:51.920]  drinks of all types next they're set to ban milk products and popcorn again it's
[09:51.920 --> 09:56.480]  all about government telling you how to live your life already nationwide under
[09:56.480 --> 10:00.760]  the new federal initiative it started three years ago in Chicago they're
[10:00.760 --> 10:06.360]  telling school children what they can eat and parents are being told don't pack
[10:06.360 --> 10:12.840]  a lunch you're not trusted and that now it's not just Rhode Island that did this
[10:12.840 --> 10:21.840]  last week now Colorado is announcing that it's the law that all hospital
[10:21.840 --> 10:25.920]  employees including police and first responders that come to the hospital
[10:25.920 --> 10:30.960]  janitors you name it you must all take whatever vaccines they say of course
[10:30.960 --> 10:36.600]  there's no it's not a law it's a mandate but they're running the giant hoax as
[10:36.600 --> 10:41.280]  usual Colorado health care workers to be fired they refuse mandatory flu shots
[10:41.280 --> 10:45.720]  but it's anyone that comes to the hospital in an official capacity they
[10:45.720 --> 10:51.640]  tried this again ten years ago with the new freedom initiative type program the
[10:51.640 --> 10:56.040]  Model States Health Emergency Powers Act to forcibly inoculate 14 million
[10:56.040 --> 11:00.760]  first responders and they said no and first they announced it's the law and
[11:00.760 --> 11:04.320]  the police and firefighters and others went and looked so there is no law and
[11:04.320 --> 11:10.000]  so it backfired only 4% the LA Times reported of the 14 million took the
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.120]  shots well plus they try to give them smallpox shots and it killed so many
[11:14.120 --> 11:16.800]  people that was really the big wake-up call it's like you shouldn't have rolled
[11:16.800 --> 11:20.360]  out the most deadly first on them oh but you know I covered this yesterday I'm
[11:20.360 --> 11:23.880]  covered again before I even get to the news this is such a big deal there are
[11:23.880 --> 11:26.960]  hundreds of articles that I have personally been coming across that
[11:26.960 --> 11:31.560]  they're just littering everywhere parade magazine long view news journal you
[11:31.560 --> 11:36.800]  name it saying there are quote no shot effects from any vaccines including flu
[11:36.800 --> 11:42.120]  here is the long view journal take your medicine getting a flu shot as part of
[11:42.120 --> 11:45.080]  being good neighbor and it goes on absolutely no harm from getting a
[11:45.080 --> 11:48.800]  vaccination don't let yourself be fooled by Walt rumors that's right there so I
[11:48.800 --> 11:52.880]  thought I'd read this again this is CDC vaccines immunizations basics and
[11:52.880 --> 11:57.600]  common questions possible side effects from vaccines CDC.gov forward slash
[11:57.600 --> 12:05.000]  print dot do question mark URL dash HTTP and it just goes on from there or just
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.920]  type in CDC vaccine side effects that'll be the first thing comes up and it says
[12:09.920 --> 12:18.080]  comas death permanent narcolepsy epilepsy I mean it's just 20 pages and then
[12:18.080 --> 12:22.960]  links fever redness swelling shortness of breath soreness or tinnitus and
[12:22.960 --> 12:28.400]  fussiness red you know I mean it's got tiredness or poor appetite vomiting
[12:28.400 --> 12:34.840]  seizures non-stop crying high fever I mean I it just goes on and on here it
[12:34.840 --> 12:43.560]  says coma death but I thought they mean they said there's no there's no side
[12:43.560 --> 12:46.920]  effects absolutely none it's a wild rumor I could just go on for an hour
[12:46.920 --> 12:51.000]  reading that and by the way that's just the boil down page there's hyperlinks to
[12:51.000 --> 12:57.160]  hundreds of pages about the autoimmune diseases blood pouring out of every
[12:57.160 --> 13:02.240]  orifice miscarriages says don't give women pregnant women vaccines but here on
[13:02.240 --> 13:05.400]  the news it's important for you to get them you see how are they doing this
[13:05.400 --> 13:09.520]  they're testing to see what they can get away with I have an article here today
[13:09.520 --> 13:15.320]  that less than 25% of Americans ever read newspapers and then those that read
[13:15.320 --> 13:20.040]  newspapers they go out in public I've observed this professor types and people
[13:20.040 --> 13:25.160]  and they'll open a newspaper or magazine or they'll get their iPad out and and
[13:25.160 --> 13:31.800]  and show people they're reading they they read in public that oh look I'm so
[13:31.800 --> 13:37.640]  smart I I read the newspaper see if you're the 24% that read newspapers on a
[13:37.640 --> 13:41.920]  regular basis well then you're reading you know just absolute the family's bad
[13:41.920 --> 13:45.360]  world government's good but well government doesn't exist and there are no
[13:45.360 --> 13:50.680]  side effects from vaccines yeah there it is what is that associated press I put
[13:50.680 --> 13:54.200]  that back up good job of finding that guys so that CBS Houston also reporting
[13:54.200 --> 14:03.200]  on it study less than a quart of Americans read newspapers good good only
[14:03.200 --> 14:08.600]  29% of Americans say now say they read a newspaper with just 23% reading print
[14:08.600 --> 14:16.000]  newspaper so technically 29 or less than a third dude you read something oh my
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.480]  goodness so you wonder how they get away with this but can you imagine people
[14:20.480 --> 14:24.080]  reading parade magazine in the newspaper reading all these articles I mean I
[14:24.080 --> 14:29.840]  hear it on the radio all the time the CDC says that there are no side effects
[14:29.840 --> 14:33.920]  take your shot I'm like what about my neighbor who's two-year-old died after
[14:33.920 --> 14:37.400]  the shot oh well the doctors said it was probably the shot but they're not gonna
[14:37.400 --> 14:41.480]  put that in the chart because of liability but if you want to sue there's a
[14:41.480 --> 14:44.880]  federal law that there's no liability for the doctors or big pharma and if you
[14:44.880 --> 14:48.800]  jump through about 500 hoops you might get paid out of the multi-billion dollar
[14:48.800 --> 14:52.640]  vaccine damage flush fund they set up in the 80s but but even though the
[14:52.640 --> 14:57.360]  billions have been paid out there is no problem okay I'm ranting because let me
[14:57.360 --> 15:01.600]  tell you what really gets to me knowing kids are lining up I see it every few
[15:01.600 --> 15:06.440]  months on on YouTube from different TV stations around the country where it'll
[15:06.440 --> 15:10.080]  show hundreds of kids at clinics sometimes thousands with police standing
[15:10.080 --> 15:13.520]  they're going it's the law take your shot and the kids are crying getting their
[15:13.520 --> 15:19.960]  vaccines and it's a hoax but they put cops on TV I've even had cops on you
[15:19.960 --> 15:25.200]  know bragging about it from Maryland in places I mean out there with the police
[15:25.200 --> 15:29.400]  dogs you name it keeping back the conspiracy theorists that were there
[15:29.400 --> 15:39.240]  trying to hand out to the people the inserts that come with the vaccines
[15:39.240 --> 15:44.200]  this is the type of information we deal with and it's so frustrating to know
[15:44.200 --> 15:48.760]  you've got the majority of people that literally don't know the three branches
[15:48.760 --> 15:53.280]  of government don't know their state capital don't know who most Americans in
[15:53.280 --> 15:55.720]  major studies that are out there pull them up don't even know who the first
[15:55.720 --> 16:00.000]  president was they don't know what the first amendment is they don't know what
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.360]  the fourth amendment is they don't know what the 10th amendment is and by the
[16:03.360 --> 16:07.080]  way this doesn't make me feel superior that I know all this it freaks me out
[16:07.080 --> 16:13.840]  because I'm not that smart and I happen to know they put cancer viruses in the
[16:13.840 --> 16:17.080]  vaccines let me let me talk to new listeners who don't read and stuff a
[16:17.080 --> 16:22.280]  little let me explain something did you know that cancers up many thousands of
[16:22.280 --> 16:27.720]  percentage points did you know pediatric cancer you can look this up some of
[16:27.720 --> 16:34.000]  them are over 10,000 percent that we're dying they're killing us and it's not
[16:34.000 --> 16:40.640]  fun when the troops use DU it's a death sentence for them and they've got our
[16:40.640 --> 16:43.880]  troops using it 20 years ago they weren't even allowed to use it 22 years
[16:43.880 --> 16:48.200]  ago 22 years ago they changed it said okay use it in emergencies and use it
[16:48.200 --> 16:51.920]  with special decontamination and now they just say hey go out and use it at
[16:51.920 --> 16:55.680]  the local military shooting range not even proving ground and don't even wash

[17:07.640 --> 17:10.840]  tell you let me tell it everybody's been doing the last week the top story has
[17:10.840 --> 17:21.840]  been Hulk Hogan sex tape Hulk Hogan sex tape Hulk Hogan with his friend Bubba the
[17:21.840 --> 17:27.760]  love pimp or whatever I've been on a show before Bubba the love sponge and
[17:27.760 --> 17:31.840]  they're asking who released it gee who had a camera in the bedroom while you
[17:31.840 --> 17:36.880]  had sex and Bubba brings you in there and most these sex tapes are fake I can
[17:36.880 --> 17:39.040]  tell Hulk Hogan didn't know this was going on
[17:39.040 --> 17:42.400]  I know some of the behind-the-scenes stuff and then everybody's asking who's
[17:42.400 --> 17:47.200]  at fault let me tell you the people that put a camera in there and said oh Hulk
[17:47.200 --> 17:54.760]  Hogan it's okay we know we secretly videotaped you in there with my wife
[17:54.760 --> 17:58.880]  here's Bubba saying here have her and she's begging him and thanking him and
[17:58.880 --> 18:01.760]  all this I went and watched it because I wanted to see if it was even real or a
[18:01.760 --> 18:08.120]  stunt and it's ridiculous that's not and shouldn't be the top story when
[18:08.120 --> 18:12.120]  they're now announcing a UN buffer zone and US troops massing in and around
[18:12.120 --> 18:17.360]  Syria in proxy wars with Russians and you've got the world economy melting down
[18:17.360 --> 18:23.360]  by design and we've got new threats to riot if Obama loses the election and
[18:23.360 --> 18:31.720]  we've got total police state unfolding all over the place all over the place I

[18:36.760 --> 18:41.280]  ready getting prepared preparing for the worst hoping for the best here but I
[18:41.280 --> 18:45.080]  just look at the general public who is so domesticated and so dumb down they
[18:45.080 --> 18:51.760]  have no idea the time this world is getting ready to go into and how we're
[18:51.760 --> 18:55.840]  gonna look back on these days right now this deep recession depression in some
[18:55.840 --> 18:59.000]  regions of the country in the world and we're gonna look back on this is the
[18:59.000 --> 19:07.000]  good times let the good times roll well the good times are coming to an end here
[19:07.000 --> 19:11.640]  because the globalists run things they're engineering the collapse they've
[19:11.640 --> 19:14.880]  created this meme that things are gonna collapse and things won't be the way
[19:14.880 --> 19:19.040]  they always were because they're cutting off the resources their globalism it's
[19:19.040 --> 19:23.520]  their stated goal it's not my opinion that agenda 21 is a post-industrial
[19:23.520 --> 19:28.120]  shutdown to re-engineer the entire world when communists come into a country
[19:28.120 --> 19:31.720]  they cut off the resources to shut things down starve people to death
[19:31.720 --> 19:38.000]  re-educate they hoard the resources and then make everybody reorganize under
[19:38.000 --> 19:42.280]  their model and who runs the communist same people that funded them in 1917 to
[19:42.280 --> 19:46.840]  take over Russia on record same people that put Mao Zedong in 1949 now

[24:40.200 --> 24:46.640]  Felix Baumgartner stood alone at the edge of space poison the open doorway of
[24:46.640 --> 24:50.840]  a capsule suspended above Earth and wondering if he would make it back
[24:50.840 --> 24:59.840]  alive 24 miles below him millions of people were right there with him watching
[24:59.840 --> 25:08.760]  on the internet and marveling at the wonder of the moment unbelievable
[25:08.760 --> 25:13.440]  footage that I saw but the drudgerport.com this morning up in the upper
[25:13.440 --> 25:16.560]  left-hand corner it's since been taken down but I'm gonna have it reposted in
[25:16.560 --> 25:22.400]  full wars.com we've seen his helmet cam but this is the footage of this amazing
[25:22.400 --> 25:31.120]  human jumping from a from a bird's eye or fly on the wall view that you see I'm
[25:31.120 --> 25:35.800]  not into gossip I'm not into Hulk Hogan sex tape I'm not into watching great
[25:35.800 --> 25:39.920]  people fall or famous people fall it doesn't make me feel good even when my
[25:39.920 --> 25:46.480]  enemies fall I'm sad that they fell and we're bad people Hulk Hogan is not a
[25:46.480 --> 25:52.000]  bad person overall and it's very sad to watch his friends betray him you know
[25:52.000 --> 25:57.960]  they betrayed him when they shot the footage to begin with six years ago I
[25:57.960 --> 26:04.720]  don't care who I don't care who really released it why am I talking about
[26:04.720 --> 26:09.520]  something tabloid like that because here we see a human at 24 miles who broke
[26:09.520 --> 26:16.560]  the sound barrier and whose space suit heated up on the outside over 250
[26:16.560 --> 26:23.320]  degrees this is somebody who's skydived from 24 miles in the edge of space
[26:23.320 --> 26:32.600]  taking humanity to the very edge of exploration and to the next level it is
[26:32.600 --> 26:36.600]  that type of spirit that will lead us to the stars and have our species survive
[26:36.600 --> 26:42.880]  making people like Felix Baumgartner a hero and a household name that would
[26:42.880 --> 26:47.680]  empower our civilization kids everywhere should have posters of this guy
[26:47.680 --> 26:53.520]  hanging on their walls not gangbangers not professional wrestlers not corrupt
[26:53.520 --> 27:03.000]  Hollywood stars but I mean I'm telling you I lie awake at night thinking of
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.720]  what I've got to do to not betray my friends my family my wife my children
[27:09.720 --> 27:13.400]  sometimes I come across footage of famous people I've interviewed that so
[27:13.400 --> 27:17.360]  puts them on a little bit of a bad light and I edit it I never edit myself in
[27:17.360 --> 27:20.200]  what I stand for but if somebody says something politically that I know will
[27:20.200 --> 27:23.680]  be a big national news story I don't put it out even though it's important
[27:23.680 --> 27:27.800]  Dave Mustaine a month before his faux pas saying Obama may have been behind the
[27:27.800 --> 27:32.640]  mass shootings which wasn't a faux pas shed it to me in a taped interview and I
[27:32.640 --> 27:36.120]  cut it out he later asked me hey I saw the interview you cut that out and I
[27:36.120 --> 27:40.680]  said man listen let me say that you don't need to say that at this time and
[27:40.680 --> 27:50.800]  that's the difference is that is that is that I literally and I don't get it a
[27:50.800 --> 27:56.400]  hundred years ago most people were like me I would never betray my friends I
[27:56.400 --> 28:00.560]  would never stab people in the back and if I did it to any degree even by
[28:00.560 --> 28:08.080]  accident I would feel incredibly horribly guilty about it but nowadays so
[28:08.080 --> 28:11.920]  many people just you know what oh here let's just film Hulk Hogan having sex
[28:11.920 --> 28:15.720]  with my wife and then oh it's an accident it got out we don't know who did
[28:15.720 --> 28:21.200]  it give me a break that is so incredibly creepy but people even go
[28:21.200 --> 28:25.600]  further if they can't get you to do something wrong they will just say you've
[28:25.600 --> 28:31.680]  done it and it's it's what you see societally historically right before
[28:31.680 --> 28:35.400]  society's fully implode I studied Rome I studied the Aztecs I studied the
[28:35.400 --> 28:41.720]  Babylonians I've studied the Roaring Twenties it's cycles and decadence and
[28:41.720 --> 28:46.960]  the cycle we're entering right now you always see people betraying each other
[28:46.960 --> 28:54.840]  and and selling themselves out in fact I meant to talk about this the last week
[28:54.840 --> 28:58.520]  but it's so horrible I don't even know what to say there's a new trend the last
[28:58.520 --> 29:02.880]  few years in comedy and talk radio to make fun of mentally retarded children
[29:02.880 --> 29:09.560]  and to make fun of handicapped people and to I heard one radio show last week
[29:09.560 --> 29:14.160]  I tuned into for ten minutes and they were talking bad about Pat Tillman's
[29:14.160 --> 29:17.400]  family saying the government didn't kill him when it's admitted they did the
[29:17.400 --> 29:21.360]  army's own corner and then then they I walked in a store walk back out they
[29:21.360 --> 29:24.960]  were making fun of a woman who died who'd been an iron lung since she was
[29:24.960 --> 29:28.560]  three years old and the poetry she wrote the children's books she wrote and how
[29:28.560 --> 29:31.440]  sad the family was and they made fun of this woman for like 20 minutes
[29:31.440 --> 29:36.760]  reveling in her and how a reveling in her death and denigrating her and it's
[29:36.760 --> 29:41.040]  meant to destroy our life force it's meant to make us think we're trash so
[29:41.040 --> 29:44.760]  we stand down roll over and die and I'm not gonna sit here and watch this
[29:44.760 --> 29:48.520]  happen anymore we're gonna come back and get into plans the stage riots after

[35:11.160 --> 35:18.080]  micron of THC in any of their products most varieties of hemp do not have the
[35:18.080 --> 35:26.000]  THC in it it makes better clothes than cotton it makes incredible oils it is a
[35:26.000 --> 35:31.840]  miracle drug as well just the non-thc type I mean I mean the major scientific
[35:31.840 --> 35:39.320]  studies on heart disease you name it and I asked my uncle after he'd handed out a
[35:39.320 --> 35:43.920]  few hundred or a few hundred got out down at the truck stop what the feedback
[35:43.920 --> 35:49.000]  was on the economic collapse bankers plot to destroy US economy the locals
[35:49.000 --> 35:54.360]  said yeah we like Alex we actually listed him on a local affiliate but you
[35:54.360 --> 35:59.760]  know we don't like the fact that he's pushing marijuana and see that's the
[35:59.760 --> 36:03.360]  reason this country's failing that's the reason this country's falling apart
[36:03.360 --> 36:10.960]  number one George Washington smoked marijuana hemp of the variety that
[36:10.960 --> 36:15.360]  they called toothache hemp or stomachache hemp is what the apothecaries
[36:15.360 --> 36:18.880]  the local drugstore's called it as you take if you had a stomachache you had
[36:18.880 --> 36:24.400]  the flu you had a toothache they said smoke or eat this George Washington
[36:24.400 --> 36:29.720]  grew the rope hemp the sale hemp types but he also grew the stuff that they put
[36:29.720 --> 36:34.760]  in jail for he's evil I understand George Washington's bad the point is I
[36:34.760 --> 36:38.640]  don't smoke marijuana I've smoked it before here and there don't particularly
[36:38.640 --> 36:44.560]  like it unfortunately I like things that are far worse for you like alcohol and
[36:44.560 --> 36:51.600]  caffeine and nicotine and things the issue here is that just shows that the
[36:51.600 --> 36:54.880]  people Paris for lack of knowledge he's gonna be in there talking about that and
[36:54.880 --> 37:00.080]  other things and Sheriff Frank did smoke pot himself former sheriff run running
[37:00.080 --> 37:04.880]  again the point is it's ridiculous that do pot Dow chemical on record in the
[37:04.880 --> 37:10.160]  early 30s wanted polyester to come out hemp was incredibly popular you can
[37:10.160 --> 37:15.520]  grow it anywhere it made better stuff than even cotton and it was also used to
[37:15.520 --> 37:19.080]  produce a little different types of oil machine oil hundreds of products they
[37:19.080 --> 37:22.280]  just had it banned we're the only country in the world you cannot grow
[37:22.280 --> 37:30.280]  industrial hemp you cannot grow hemp a weed in the United States it's a joke
[37:30.280 --> 37:35.480]  and they used the incredible ignorance to get that done showing some TV news
[37:35.480 --> 37:40.560]  reels wouldn't have TV yet film reels of literally they have one group of
[37:40.560 --> 37:46.520]  midgets are killing people it's everybody's heard of reefer madness
[37:46.520 --> 37:52.440]  where it shows people going crazy when they smoke marijuana so they had all
[37:52.440 --> 37:57.840]  these other news reels saying you know the evil Hispanics Mexican smoke it and
[37:57.840 --> 38:03.800]  her in the devil so they used racism and fear of the unknown they had a fifth
[38:03.800 --> 38:10.240]  name of it a weird production guys type in anti marijuana film Western anti
[38:10.240 --> 38:13.920]  marijuana Western it'll be the ones where the midgets attacked the town and
[38:13.920 --> 38:20.160]  killed everybody the point is is that it's not true but it just shows that
[38:20.160 --> 38:26.320]  we've got a sponsor where it is hemp oil for your heart and for digestion and
[38:26.320 --> 38:30.800]  all this stuff sold in health food stores everywhere incredible health
[38:30.800 --> 38:34.760]  benefits being patented in drug companies are coming out with it the last
[38:34.760 --> 38:39.280]  15 years I mean it's a fact this is the most wondrous plant in the world it's
[38:39.280 --> 38:47.280]  got so many uses it'll make your headspin and people are going come on
[38:47.280 --> 38:53.120]  guys my uncle goes down to the truck stop we locked that magazine but it's
[38:53.120 --> 38:59.520]  pushing marijuana in it well hey sorry I gave him a couple hundred I'll make
[38:59.520 --> 39:06.920]  sure that doesn't happen again how's that sound okay I'm just absolutely sick
[39:06.920 --> 39:15.720]  of just willful mindlessness absolutely disgraceful that things like this are
[39:15.720 --> 39:26.320]  going on and again I'm not on some high horse it pains me it pains me that our
[39:26.320 --> 39:31.880]  ancestors smoked marijuana out of a pipe every culture's done it for two
[39:31.880 --> 39:37.960]  days and stomach aches it's been proven to reduce nausea unlike any nausea
[39:37.960 --> 39:44.360]  medication out there it's been proven to help people on chemotherapy and you've
[39:44.360 --> 39:50.080]  got people so ignorant that they see something that says hemp and they don't
[39:50.080 --> 39:55.000]  even know it's a different variety that has no THC none does nothing to your
[39:55.000 --> 40:01.920]  brain all right you see I've got all this news to cover and I'm ranting about
[40:01.920 --> 40:06.120]  ignorance the news is saying I ready a newspaper saying no side effects from the
[40:06.120 --> 40:11.840]  flu shot and I can read you from the CDC saying eomba rays narcolepsy seizures
[40:11.840 --> 40:18.640]  permanent epilepsy coma death bleeding autoimmune disorder I'm informed I'm not
[40:18.640 --> 40:24.640]  bad I'm not a terrorist because I spend my time being informed I'm not bad
[40:24.640 --> 40:28.560]  because I found the wonder of learning and the wonder of the universe I'm not
[40:28.560 --> 40:36.240]  bad because I want freedom I'm not bad or weird or sick because I'm informed like
[40:36.240 --> 40:40.320]  that movie idiocracy one of my favorites I might judge by the way I talked to my
[40:40.320 --> 40:43.360]  few days ago he promises when he gets back from LA he's gonna come on I'm
[40:43.360 --> 40:47.520]  excited about that I'm a fan he says he's a fan I look forward to we have
[40:47.520 --> 40:50.280]  mutual friends are always telling me I mean he's just such a genius when it
[40:50.280 --> 40:53.880]  comes to exposing the ignorance anybody that doesn't understand where we're
[40:53.880 --> 41:04.680]  going watch idiocracy but my point in all of this is that I don't enjoy seeing
[41:04.680 --> 41:08.800]  people dumb down and mindless see the more you learn about logic and history
[41:08.800 --> 41:12.240]  and the way humans operate the more the rest of the pieces fall in place like a
[41:12.240 --> 41:17.520]  jigsaw puzzle and pretty soon you're leaping with understanding I learn more
[41:17.520 --> 41:23.320]  now in a week than I previously learned in a year it's unbelievable it makes me
[41:23.320 --> 41:28.320]  a little eccentric makes me a little obnoxious because I am constantly in a
[41:28.320 --> 41:33.200]  state of total frustration because I cannot even write large on the world
[41:33.200 --> 41:37.600]  what I know and try to turn around what's happening the only hope we've got
[41:37.600 --> 41:40.800]  is to rest people out of this medical trance the general public is in a
[41:40.800 --> 41:44.640]  suspended disbelief daydreaming medical trance we've probably had five
[41:44.640 --> 41:48.800]  articles the last week written by Paul Watson Steve Watson and myself on this
[41:48.800 --> 41:52.920]  issue I'm gonna write a big master article that we're gonna put in the new
[41:52.920 --> 42:00.040]  issue of the magazine coming up in the November issue but my point is is that
[42:00.040 --> 42:05.000]  you are in a medical trance you're not supposed to feel like you're in a haze
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.200]  you're not supposed to feel depressed you're not supposed to feel aimless
[42:09.200 --> 42:13.880]  you're supposed to be seething with power seething with electricity seething
[42:13.880 --> 42:22.600]  with art seething with passion I want a renaissance I want fires in the minds of
[42:22.600 --> 42:28.360]  women and women I want you to win I want you to succeed and the globalist they
[42:28.360 --> 42:35.640]  don't they want you scared and small and stupid and with shutters on inside a box
[42:35.640 --> 42:41.440]  with blinders never really becoming conscious that's what's amazing most
[42:41.440 --> 42:44.560]  people are not conscious and the globalists tell you you're an animal
[42:44.560 --> 42:48.640]  you're dumb it's canary and you don't have a choice you're a computer in their
[42:48.640 --> 42:52.000]  own writings they say they don't believe that they know that's not true they have
[42:52.000 --> 42:58.240]  to keep you down to keep you in that state so that you don't become a human
[42:58.240 --> 43:02.800]  and truly develop into what you're supposed to develop into they want to
[43:02.800 --> 43:07.440]  arrest your development when you turn on the television everything is about
[43:07.440 --> 43:11.880]  arresting your development
[43:13.200 --> 43:19.200]  everything is about shutting you down
[43:19.200 --> 43:23.840]  one of the globalist are there that type of person that wants money and power
[43:23.840 --> 43:27.120]  because they're insecure who wants to dominate those around them because
[43:27.120 --> 43:33.480]  they're insecure and crave power and they're the types who hate artists and
[43:33.480 --> 43:37.840]  researchers and and trailblazers because it intimidates them they're the
[43:37.840 --> 43:45.280]  people that hate a handsome man or a good-looking woman and really hate a
[43:45.280 --> 43:51.280]  good-looking couple I'm not very good-looking today but you know 15 20
[43:51.280 --> 43:56.800]  years ago I was extremely good-looking and I noticed that I never knew why so
[43:56.800 --> 44:00.640]  many people would act upset towards me but now I've learned psychology and
[44:00.640 --> 44:05.680]  anthropology and sociology and it's a whole phenomenon of especially gorgeous
[44:05.680 --> 44:11.840]  women people treating them badly and handsome men being treated badly by a
[44:11.840 --> 44:15.480]  lot of people they're obviously treated good by others there's all different
[44:15.480 --> 44:19.640]  types in the world but you take that and you expand upon it to the globalist
[44:19.640 --> 44:24.640]  sneaking poison in the food and water dumbing us down deploying these systems
[44:24.640 --> 44:29.840]  that's what evil is it feels like it's not invited to the party like sleeping
[44:29.840 --> 44:37.320]  beauty and the witch so she poisons the well those fairy tales folks are all
[44:37.320 --> 44:43.240]  archetypes of things that really go on throughout history and she's like you
[44:43.240 --> 44:47.160]  didn't invite me to the wedding how about everybody's gonna fall asleep in
[44:47.160 --> 44:54.680]  the kingdom and the weeds are gonna grow up the post-industrial world you know if
[44:54.680 --> 44:57.520]  you just study the Jacobites and the people that ran the French Revolution
[44:57.520 --> 45:01.880]  this is mainline history books you can't put it down if you read there the
[45:01.880 --> 45:07.400]  history of it giant hordes of hundreds of thousands of Illuminati devil
[45:07.400 --> 45:12.520]  worshipers who said we're ending the family we're going to a nine-day work
[45:12.520 --> 45:18.560]  week no vacations we're gonna murder and kill and drink blood and slaughter I
[45:18.560 --> 45:24.360]  mean I mean these people were unbelievable they took a country over and
[45:24.360 --> 45:30.320]  ran wild chopping heads off until Napoleon came along until the society
[45:30.320 --> 45:37.200]  collapsed and they wanted to go back to a post-industrial mad max
[45:38.240 --> 45:44.240]  road warrior system that's agenda 21 that's the UN that's the communist they're
[45:44.240 --> 45:51.600]  all Illuminati the Illuminati is real these people like to murder people they
[45:51.600 --> 45:55.360]  like to grab your kid off the sidewalk and grab him and torture him and scare
[45:55.360 --> 45:59.040]  the daylights out of him pull their teeth out with pliers okay and they're
[45:59.040 --> 46:03.480]  building a world look at the death look at the destruction look at the evil look
[46:03.480 --> 46:08.280]  what the system pushes look at what they stand for look at look at their
[46:08.280 --> 46:13.720]  fruits and they sell you death and destruction and ugliness constantly so
[46:13.720 --> 46:17.720]  you don't get threatened by it so you begin to see it as entertaining so that
[46:17.720 --> 46:20.600]  you don't differentiate when your neighbors being drug off when they're
[46:20.600 --> 46:25.560]  getting thrown into the Coliseum to the Lions that's where all this is headed
[46:25.560 --> 46:32.160]  and in hunger games and the running man all of that becoming reality and it's
[46:32.160 --> 46:36.120]  entertainment watch people get beat by police or tasered or die and it's like
[46:36.120 --> 46:39.080]  oh there's too many people anyways just having an attitude to go ahead and take
[46:39.080 --> 46:42.200]  my neighbor go ahead and kill somebody go ahead and euthanize that old person

[49:22.600 --> 49:27.120]  our great work but because of industrialization and mechanization we'll
[49:27.120 --> 49:30.960]  be able to scientifically set it up where it won't collapse and our great
[49:30.960 --> 49:35.240]  work will just continue and continue and continue until the breast of the earth
[49:35.240 --> 49:43.320]  is saved from the evil human and we've killed almost 90% or more I mean they

[54:21.560 --> 54:28.840]  black American best-selling author journalist you name it wrote articles
[54:28.840 --> 54:33.960]  for syndicated column and also did a radio interview that we have linked up
[54:33.960 --> 54:38.680]  at info wars comm and Paul Watson's article last week he said people are
[54:38.680 --> 54:43.280]  saying they're gonna riot and attack white people if Obama doesn't get
[54:43.280 --> 54:48.960]  elected and MSNBC gets up there I've seen them and says if you don't support
[54:48.960 --> 54:54.480]  everything Obama does you're a racist now again there are black races there are
[54:54.480 --> 54:57.480]  white racists the white racists are having a field day with us to sing oh
[54:57.480 --> 55:00.240]  great please burn down your own neighborhoods again I mean this is
[55:00.240 --> 55:05.960]  making me sick but we posted an article on Saturday that got picked up by the
[55:05.960 --> 55:10.080]  drudge report and I saw some of the comments saying oh this is just one
[55:10.080 --> 55:15.560]  place well the guy sourced like 15 different places the writer did where
[55:15.560 --> 55:22.560]  people were singing I went and found others I found the examiner reporting
[55:22.560 --> 55:28.280]  on it Chicago now not just Thomas soul a bunch of people so I started looking and
[55:28.280 --> 55:32.160]  even in our own YouTube these were people with longtime you know three four
[55:32.160 --> 55:36.720]  year old channels hundreds of thousands of views with their faces up there saying
[55:36.720 --> 55:41.200]  they're gonna attack white people and they're gonna burn stuff if Obama doesn't
[55:41.200 --> 55:45.360]  win so that these aren't like dummy channels because I found some that are
[55:45.360 --> 55:48.480]  white racist up there trying to make black folks look bad I did find some
[55:48.480 --> 55:53.080]  fake ones we didn't include those there were thousands of tweets and things too
[55:53.080 --> 55:56.920]  many to even follow and we would spot check like 1520 of them over the weekend
[55:56.920 --> 56:01.880]  I would Paul would and it was all real people we found a few fake ones on YouTube
[56:01.880 --> 56:08.080]  I mean saying I'm gonna kill Romney I'm gonna kill this guy I'm gonna kill that
[56:08.080 --> 56:11.160]  guy that's what they're saying in these tweets I want the New York Times cutting
[56:11.160 --> 56:14.080]  that out of context saying I said that I did not say that I'm quoting what they
[56:14.080 --> 56:18.400]  said and do you see the Secret Service doing anything about this we have in
[56:18.400 --> 56:22.080]  Paul Watson's article effect that's another one he should do top of all the
[56:22.080 --> 56:27.800]  work he's doing or maybe Curtin M.O. or Adam or a Don Salazar somebody should
[56:27.800 --> 56:32.160]  point out where's the Secret Service because people have said mild things
[56:32.160 --> 56:36.080]  about the Federal Reserve being private and they've been arrested and taken to
[56:36.080 --> 56:41.520]  a mental institution I mean the Atari militia said we got to get guns in case
[56:41.520 --> 56:45.160]  society collapses we may have to fight the New World Order and they went and
[56:45.160 --> 56:47.800]  put them in jail for two years they finally got out of jail because we
[56:47.800 --> 56:51.200]  still have some courts left I mean you know you say we may have to buy guns to
[56:51.200 --> 56:56.600]  protect ourselves someday you go to jail and are a terrorist on the news but
[56:56.600 --> 57:03.280]  you say KILL you know KI double hockey stick meant Romney I mean I got the
[57:03.280 --> 57:08.200]  quotes with links to the Facebook's and Twitter's and screenshots of it and
[57:08.200 --> 57:12.520]  folks you could just go to Twitter and type in you know things like that like
[57:12.520 --> 57:17.560]  I'm gonna ride of Obama loses or you know you know get rid of Romney you know
[57:17.560 --> 57:22.360]  KILL Romney and it's I mean hundreds of links every time you search I mean it's

[57:27.640 --> 57:32.400]  I listen people riot over sports teams people riot over whatever and we had
[57:32.400 --> 57:36.600]  major riots in this country before and see a lot of that was over legitimate
[57:36.600 --> 57:39.600]  problems in the 60s and things and people not being allowed to vote and
[57:39.600 --> 57:43.560]  stuff but see there's that attitude now well let's do it again but it's totally
[57:43.560 --> 57:48.680]  illegitimate it's totally illegitimate and it only hurts those communities and
[57:48.680 --> 57:54.000]  creates more division and I'm totally against it yeah now there's another
[57:54.000 --> 57:59.360]  article about it out print me that I mean there's so many of these what's that

[59:52.000 --> 01:00:00.800]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:12.560]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:21.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:30.840]  Jones you know some people could accuse us of being sensational but what I found
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:35.880]  is reality is so sensational I can't come up with words that are that are wild
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:42.200]  enough to describe it truth is stranger than fiction but you know my quote on it
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:49.080]  is that reality is so sensational I don't have words to describe it it's
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:56.040]  beyond sensational reality is absolutely gripping it's beautiful it's ugly it's
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:01.320]  it smells like roses it smells like rotten meat it's the highest peaks of
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.760]  exaltation and enlightenment and the greatest depths of barbarism and pain
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:11.640]  and humiliation and real civilization lies in realizing the dichotomy of
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:17.360]  humankind and reaching for the stars reaching for that that's pure honorable
[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:23.120]  and good that's where I want to be because the closer I get to that the
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:29.480]  more fulfilled I am and I just even looking back at evil and corruption
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.360]  seeing it and others makes me feel pathetic and weak and my own evil and
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:38.080]  weakness that I fall into occasionally almost instinctively not almost
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:43.600]  instinctively is something I'm ashamed of but I seek and I think you should
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:51.880]  seek for greater information greater freedom and also greater challenges and
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:56.520]  we should build up people that stand up for good when we come back in the next
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.320]  segment I'm going to give the number out about any of the news items I've raised
[01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:02.720]  but I mean I would hope callers when I give the number out first-time callers
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.840]  in this next hour give them a chance to get involved with that a few days a
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:11.440]  week I was just sitting here reading tweets this morning and Facebook stuff
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.920]  that I'd sent Watson to put in his article and I was realizing he didn't
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:19.600]  even put the stuff about killing Romney in here because we all we have an
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.560]  instinct to like tone down stuff in fact most of the time I've told my
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.280]  writers hey that's more sensational than what you wrote that's worse it's worse
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.680]  than what you said in the headline and they're like yeah but that's that's
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.560]  pretty sensational yeah it is sensational
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:42.360]  because that's the real issue why are these Twitter people allowed to call
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:48.840]  for violence because you know Watson links to dozens of these threats and I
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.960]  said look I want you to link to more he said there's just not enough time there's
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.960]  there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds that we see
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:59.480]  thousands of them only this weekend almost a thousand skateboarders rioted
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:02.120]  because they were unable to attend a movie from here in Hollywood because
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:08.960]  their theater only holds 600 people yeah I was at the San Antonio Riverwalk
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.920]  really nice down there I love San Antonio that's my second favorite Texas
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.360]  city after my beloved Austin I was down there you know with family visiting
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.320]  museums and stuff last week not this weekend but what we can before last and
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.680]  I thought told the story I saw semi riots twice the people screaming little
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.160]  Wayne little Wayne one time and some other rapper name I didn't know but
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:32.320]  looked up that it was a rapper and just in just teenagers running around screaming
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:38.160]  and and an older young people you know 20s with them and then screaming and
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:41.880]  threats and police running by I don't really know what happened because it you
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:47.440]  know the the police and sirens were you know 200 yards down by that and I was
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.600]  sitting there with my family and didn't go stick my nose in it probably should
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.560]  have but in a certain point you know it's nine o'clock at night you're eating
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.400]  dinner and I mean a certain point you just Rob do's sister was out on the
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.640]  Hagan bike trail and a police drone came over her she found the cops
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.960]  controlling it and playing clothes they wouldn't even talked to her but I guess
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.800]  that's what they do they got to fly the thing the point is they were like sir
[01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:15.680]  surveilling people I thought just like I ran into that highway department drone
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:20.640]  I mean it's just we are not in Kansas anymore is the point I'm getting to okay
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:24.880]  I'm going to come back get into the quotes the threats the rest of it I'm
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:29.080]  gonna have Watson had to this some of the Romney threats I was rereading over
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:37.760]  this and I mean I see threats on Romney here but I found I found worse ones
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:41.240]  because I mean you know what let's not hold back we're gonna be accused of
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:46.240]  being sensational anyways so let's just give them all of it people don't want to
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:50.440]  handle the truth folks it's sensational the tens of thousands of children after

[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.240]  cash in a close US presidential election could lead to riots in the
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:48.560]  streets he's saying that very respected we've got Thomas soul a syndicated
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:54.040]  columnist author researcher he's coming out last week and saying look at these
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:58.200]  quotes online and from groups calling for riots racially motivated if
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:02.920]  something happens he told KBC television he's predicting racially
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:10.480]  motivated riots if Obama loses or God forbid as a contested election it goes
[01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:15.760]  into a media frenzy I mean it's just incredible here's Chicago now riots to
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:21.560]  follow the election here's an examiner story Twitter explodes with threats of
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:26.080]  riots that's from five days ago and here's the story that's kicked this into
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:30.840]  high gear we posted this Saturday morning drudge report calm picked it up from
[01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:34.800]  info wars.com it's the economic collapse blog calm and the great
[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.720]  reportage over there at pointing out a bunch of
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:45.480]  Twitter's and Facebook's and things shang that there will be violence they'll be
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:51.720]  riots they'll be attacks if Romney gets the White House you might as well kill
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:56.360]  me now because it's gonna be a bleeping riot if Romney becomes president and
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:00.680]  took away welfare downtown Cincinnati would become a riot if Romney takes away
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:08.920]  food stamps to chisel in his bit I'm start a riot I don't know what all that
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.440]  stuff means if Romney wins which I highly doubt there will be a riot and it
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.760]  just goes on and on and on I've seen threats to Romney to I'm gonna get Paul
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:24.600]  to add to his new article out today and it just goes on and on and on and listen
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:29.120]  folks I know a big deal when I see one here's the Thomas soul video Thomas soul
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.680]  race rise of Obama loses three minutes 43 seconds we played that yes they will
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.400]  play that again coming up at the bottom of the hour the reason I'm covering this
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:44.640]  is I saw that article Saturday on drudge and I thought yeah those are real
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.800]  quotes let me go see if these are dummy accounts of people stirring up trouble
[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:52.640]  because some of that goes on trolls poses people people poses me online saying
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:56.160]  horrible racist stuff and things show there or they had at the show together
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.960]  they're very creatively would just audio to put it out make it sound like I've
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:03.360]  said terrible things so I'm gonna check on the accounts and the accounts weren't
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.480]  dummies they've been their years in some cases with you know thousands of tweets
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:13.000]  8,000 tweets 5,000 tweets 20,000 tweets thousands of followers Facebook's with
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.600]  tens of thousands of people liking it and so I'm like man this looks bad I
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.240]  started finding tons of it so I called Watson up and I said hey you want to run
[01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:25.920]  an article this weekend he said he said how about Monday he goes you know I'm
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:28.520]  supposed to go take care of some stuff and I said yeah I guess I could I'll do a
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.640]  video but I said yeah just do it Monday and go see what you find I call him
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.880]  about 5 30 a.m. this morning because he's up six hours earlier than I and I get up
[01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:40.040]  real early earlier and earlier is the problem getting up so early like 5 a.m.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:43.240]  now I'm loving it too by the way I love getting up when it's dark seeing the
[01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:51.520]  Sun's sunrise every day but side issue I started talking to him this morning he
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.160]  goes Alex he goes there's thousands of them I mean there's hundreds and hundreds
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:00.080]  that I've read myself threats of violence death threats and I and I go are
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:04.120]  you checking him he goes yeah these are real accounts these are real people you
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.760]  can tell a real account they've got their videos their family with their music
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:11.880]  what they're into years of it you can tell a dummy account you know always set
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.160]  up in the last month it's doing nothing but trolling see a site's 98% not
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:19.760]  trolling and their people are with their families now they're saying they want to
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:25.360]  go after Romney and burn stuff down this is a big deal folks you see the
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:29.960]  globalists said that that that Obama was to bring all this racial harmony
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:33.680]  together but the Democratic Party has never been about that just like
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:37.320]  Professor Griff says the Obama deception if you know what it was about has
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:45.160]  been about is about and it's going to be about then you understand I mean it's
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.560]  the party of the Ku Klux Klan it's the party of Senator Byrd I'm not saying
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:52.480]  the Republicans are good either but the Democrats are low-down folks and they
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:57.680]  figured out pay people off so you can control them so you can break down their
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:01.480]  family so you can run eugenics against them it's all the Margaret Singer plan
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:06.520]  I've had the black genocide org head on black pastor his research at all there's
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:10.360]  a Pulitzer prize winning books out there on it what what's his name something
[01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:14.760]  black who wrote the articles for the New York Times also covered all that I had
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:17.920]  him on before I forget his name you want to pull surprise yeah the point he
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.640]  wrote about IBM the Nazis and all that the holler with machines all of it the
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:28.360]  point is I've done all the research okay I know what the game plan is and I mean
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:32.480]  look at Al Sharpton who's got an MSNBC show made his name stirring up riots in
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:38.160]  division so this is all going on and folks I want these communities to do
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:42.720]  well I want everybody to live in harmony I want freedom the globalists want
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.040]  divide and conquer and I've never seen such a buzz for this and remember what
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:54.000]  we cover in the Obama deception actually Rob Jacobson's here I think it's
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:00.680]  towards the end of Obama deception where he talks about Odinga the quickest way
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:03.640]  to find it is used to go through the YouTube of Obama deception one with 12
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:08.720]  million views is a higher res on YouTube there's so many versions but the one
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:13.080]  with about 12 million views is good and if you just scan through it when you see
[01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.880]  Odinga it'll say Odinga and it'll show a map of Kenya that that's where we say
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:21.120]  it I want to play this from three and a half years ago if we can find it where
[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:29.040]  Webster Tarpley says that you know Obama he's all about racial division or
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.960]  religious division his cousin Odinga he told him to stage riots in Kenya when
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.960]  the Muslims didn't win the election against the Christians Odingo's Muslim
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:42.200]  he said we'll start cause riots on on Senate letterhead Obama told him and
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:47.360]  demand a place in the government and they did they created the prime
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:54.120]  ministership over there to to make the Muslims stop rioting I'm not saying this
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:58.360]  is gonna happen but if the globalist wanted they'll have provocateurs go out
[01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:02.520]  and start it then opportunistic people black white Hispanic you name it just
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.880]  like the LA riots you could see it was a bunch of criminals in their robbing
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:12.400]  scores that will start and of the police stand down you know it staged like
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:17.760]  Daryl Gates did in LA if they stand down and again I'm not defending the
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:20.640]  police rubber bulleting people either they rubber bullet you when you
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:24.520]  peacefully protest and that's wrong they rubber bullet people now under federal
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.600]  control to shut down the First Amendment I think it's criminal and horrible and
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:32.560]  my office helped with the lawyers and we and Rob do sued the police and had a
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:40.040]  settlement had a settlement with Pittsburgh but we weren't happy about
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:43.440]  that but we had to have the case law they ended up being taxpayer money
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:46.600]  anyways but I mean we know what we're talking about we fall lawsuits and went
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:53.440]  them and it's wrong but I mean what are the police gonna do if people start I
[01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:57.080]  mean you see every time a big sports team wins a bunch of turning cars over
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:02.400]  beating people and that's the culture now across the board this this gangster
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.400]  culture that's that that that's across racial lines that MTV has made the
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.760]  default culture for young people now and it's meant to destroy culture folks it's
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:19.440]  meant to hurt people it's so disgusting we found the Odinga Club here it is from
[01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:25.000]  YouTube I believe and then we'll play a couple of things one is again this idea
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.000]  kick the Chinese out of Africa kick them out of Sudan where they get oil kick
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:33.280]  them out of Zimbabwe where they get raw materials start a civil war in Congo
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:38.560]  another big source of raw materials Al Qaeda an arm of the US intelligence
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.720]  community is now active in Algeria Tunisia Morocco you've got a destabilization
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:49.720]  going on in Kenya around Odinga that's Obama's cousin this is a guy who has two
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:56.080]  children they're Obama's niece and well nephew in a broad sense and one of them
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:18:00.160]  is named Raul and the other one is named Winnie after Winnie Mandela who did the
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:05.920]  necklacing and political assassinations in South Africa so this Odinga is
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:11.800]  essentially a CIA destabilizing operation in Kenya and he's got a Odinga
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:16.920]  Islamic Alliance to crush the Christians in in Kenya but this also reaches
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:22.640]  into Ethiopia it reaches into Uganda Congo Tanzania and a whole bunch of
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:27.560]  other countries in that region so all of Africa is a battlefield in flames
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:31.480]  between the US and the Chinese with Obama leading the charge to kick the
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:35.920]  Chinese out for geopolitical right yeah that that's that's the right clip but
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:39.280]  not the one I thought I think it's in the film I know we did interviews I've
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.040]  seen the letterhead of Obama saying cause civil unrest though you know they'll
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:46.960]  make you part of the government so my point is we'll dig that up guys type in
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:52.280]  Obama's letter senator Obama's letter to Odinga it's it's been written about it's
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.160]  been in the news I want to show people that because you know the point is this
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.960]  could be the October surprise because I haven't even gotten the biggest point
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:08.320]  here and I'll give the number out and go to your calls 800-259-9231-800-259-9231
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.480]  well Paul Watson gets into this in his article I've had him add it to it and the
[01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:16.800]  one up at infowars.com new threats to right of Obama loses election what's the
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:21.320]  1.6 billion bullets for what's the army admittedly gearing up for civil unrest at
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:24.680]  a level that they've never done before what's that for what's what's all they
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:28.680]  want an excuse to cover up the collapsing economy the wars they want to
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.320]  launch all of it they want civil unrest the entire military's been trained for
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:38.000]  this now never before has that happened and this could be the trigger and then
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:47.320]  America'll say okay take my rights I mean just amazing that all of this is
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:51.960]  going on so you could see all the preparations and exposing it may back
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:58.120]  this off ladies and gentlemen this is very important 800-259-9231 your calls
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:03.280]  and a lot more coming up Aaron full in here as the food police shut down food
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:07.520]  co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans are losing access not just a
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:10.760]  raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:14.400]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:18.280]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:21.360]  sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.240]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.400]  fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:32.000]  culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented porches Koreans
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.080]  eat kimchi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's

[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:27.720]  every day I see so many videos that I don't even have time to click on them
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:33.560]  all or the police beat up totally innocent men women and children and you
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:38.000]  can always tell the look on the cops it's always wimpy looking cops with these
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:44.240]  power trip faces on them beating up some drunk person asleep on a park bench or
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:48.760]  something oh man I'd feel really manly if I beat up a homeless person on a park
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:52.920]  bench that's that's what I do to feel really good about myself I mean it is
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:55.920]  it is and I don't even want to get into bashing the police because it just feeds
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:01.400]  into the whole thing our whole society is falling apart that that's why the
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.760]  police are getting so bad because they're pulling from the worst dregs of
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:08.920]  society now and I didn't even mean to come back and get into that I was just
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:13.200]  watching the video during the break of them some drunk guy fell asleep so they
[01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:15.880]  just the guy just gets up he doesn't know this they just keep beating him and
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:20.240]  beating him I mean here in Austin they call an ambulance so the cops come and
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:24.400]  the guys having a seizure and they tell them that and the cops order the guy to
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:29.400]  stop like they're God and a guy having a seizure who's blacked out is gonna stop
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:33.920]  I hear about it all the time where cops see somebody driving erratic or run off
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.840]  the road and they come up and the guys have in a diabetic seizure and they
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:42.840]  start stop and get out and the person's obviously having a seizure you know and
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:46.840]  they taser until they have heart attacks and die sometimes this guy in Austin had
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.360]  a heart attack and the news is like well maybe he should have stopped having a
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:55.520]  seizure you can't stop having this it's just the public is so stupid now they've
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:00.000]  got cops that don't know when someone's having a seizure on the ground you ever
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  see somebody have a seizure I mean it's violent
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:14.040]  oh stop I ordered you to stop taser and they kept tasering the guy I said stop
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:18.880]  are you ready here let's jump on him now until they like almost killed the guy
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:25.480]  I don't even know what to say at this point I mean it you things have gotten
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:32.480]  so mindless that I mentioned it last hour we have a hemp sponsor all the
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:36.720]  medical things no THC in it different plant people are like how dare you
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:44.920]  promote marijuana it's it's insane ladies and gentlemen the level it's almost
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:48.920]  like we're a high-tech society but we're in the Stone Age with a bunch of
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:53.480]  idiots running around with all this high-tech gadgetry well it's not like
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:26:59.120]  that that's what's happening and at least people in ancient times I had what
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:02.280]  you'd call street smarts because you die you know if you didn't get yourself
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:08.480]  together I said I'd go to your calls Nicholas Frank fad Brian John but we'll
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:11.120]  do that when we go to the next segment it's 18 minutes long this is a short
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:16.440]  six-minute segment here I still haven't called Paul Watson he's probably
[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.480]  listening but I'm gonna have him add to the story some of the death threats I
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:23.720]  know I saw on Twitter and Facebook to Romney and again folks Romney's a puppet
[01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:27.560]  globalist I've said no matter who gets in the globalist agenda is going to
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:31.760]  continue and I've had people are saying how dare you say they'll be riots you're
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:41.720]  for Romney I'm reporting on massive buzz massive buzz with people saying
[01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:45.040]  they're gonna get violent on real Facebook and Twitter accounts and you
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:49.360]  know if I'd said that I would get in trouble
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:55.680]  why aren't they getting in trouble I mean I'll say this when I saw cops in
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:59.600]  Pennsylvania under G20 control they put him under the private G20 globalist
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:02.800]  control they do it in every country they beat a guy to death delivering
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:06.920]  newspapers in London at the G20 a few years ago and and lied about it till the
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:09.360]  video got released and he turned around and said I'm delivering newspapers
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.440]  politely they started beating him and they all got in it and beating with
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:16.240]  clubs to look family man like 50-something years old died and he was
[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.440]  just there in the city of London delivering newspapers pulled up in his
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:23.960]  truck livery truck had newspapers cops come over and they kill him then they
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.800]  lied about the autopsy the fair and the footage came out I mean that you you
[01:28:27.800 --> 01:28:30.480]  killed a family man you beat him to death because you wanted to show off you
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:36.480]  were tough and your Darth Vader outfits and I watched the cops at G20 and in
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.400]  Pittsburgh beating up women on bicycles at the college no one was resisting them
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:44.200]  so they went to the college the night the G20 already ended and found college
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:48.280]  kids outside you know eating sandwiches and studying in the park and
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:51.280]  quarantined them and attacked them and we got footage and they arrested my
[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.560]  reporter who was on a hilltop videotaping and they put him out in the rain all
[01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:00.960]  night with bags over their heads the torture him at a military base and did
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:05.560]  other things to people I won't mention on air
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:11.920]  and this is what we've turned into as a country so yeah I mean under the
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:14.880]  Constitution Bill of Rights you have a right when cops are out of their
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:18.960]  jurisdiction wrongfully chasing a woman on a bicycle and beating her with a
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:22.840]  billy club you have a right to resist that I will tell you that it's all been
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:28.080]  ruled on it's a fact Indiana just had to repass a law pointing that out so I'm
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:31.480]  not here saying people should put up without a control cops but people
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.160]  premeditatedly saying if I don't like how an election ends I'm gonna kill
[01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:39.600]  people and burn things that's criminal and that's organized crime and that's
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:44.400]  racketeering and that's conspiracy to commit violent crimes and they're
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:49.360]  letting them do it why it's a false flag in the making we've got to stop it

[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.040]  much every hour on the hour right now because there's such a giant propaganda

[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:47.720]  calls it's not heroic to know that vaccines are a chemical bio weapon meant
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:51.680]  to genetically re-engineer and attack our society when all the proof's there
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:58.120]  and the globalist brag about it at nauseam what how science are you name it

[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:08.960]  hours Bill Gates has said the vaccines that reduce population that's quote I
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:13.520]  play the video again if you want to hear the audio I mean that's the problem
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.880]  this is so out in the open it's like them saying there are no side effects from
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.720]  vaccines in newspapers everywhere and then I've got the CDC saying they can
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:28.160]  kill you give you comas you know neurological disorder it's frustrating
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:35.920]  it is not heroic when you know they're killing and maiming innocent people to
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:43.160]  get upset about it as a mammal when I see babies of my species being attacked
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:47.760]  because my ancestors were this way it's instinctive I get upset and get in a
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:51.800]  violent posture and because they've designed it where you can't physically
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:56.040]  beat these people at this time I'm using information to absolutely assault and
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.240]  this is an assault I am assaulting the globalist here with the truth I want to
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:03.200]  hurt them I want to expose them and I want to bring them to justice and I am
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.360]  assaulting them with everything I've got that's why I sound so angry because let
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:10.240]  me tell you I am angry
[01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:15.280]  Jerry Sandusky only got 30 years in prison he should have got the death
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:20.160]  penalty people said oh Alex you shouldn't talk like that if I walked in a
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.440]  field house and somebody was raping a little kid believe me it wouldn't be
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:30.280]  premeditated but I'd probably kill him and that didn't talk I'm not gonna get
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:34.120]  into it but I know how to beat somebody's brains out real fast in fact I'd do
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:37.840]  it and don't even try in seconds most people hold back when they get in the
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:42.480]  fight I don't you get in a fight with me I try to kill you I don't mean to start
[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:46.840]  running I start thinking about Sandusky and start excuse me folks don't try this
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:50.280]  at home let me just stop right there like that's all talk I'm just that that's
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:37:00.440]  that's you know the point is here ladies and gentlemen is that is that people
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:06.120]  it's not special to stand up against evil okay it's normally to get your
[01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:11.920]  head screwed on you'd be hopping mad and focused and angry it's instinctive to
[01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:15.520]  stand up against scum because you'll they'll run all over you if you don't
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:20.160]  when I see other people's kids getting hurt I think about my kids I've psycho
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:24.040]  analyze why I get so upset because what comes around goes around you let it
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:29.400]  happen to the least of them it's gonna happen to you the greatest thing is
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:33.520]  being willing to lay your life down for somebody else because if you willing to
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:37.400]  lay it down you won't end up having to lay it down when you're afraid to lay it
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:42.880]  down you're gonna be a slave that's the big trick when you're afraid to lay down
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.960]  your life folks you're gonna end up getting your life taken when you're
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:52.480]  ready to stand up for yourself that the criminals run and sometimes you got to
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:56.200]  stand up to him so what sometimes you're not gonna make it home that's okay
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:00.360]  because that's where all the liberty comes from is the willingness to stand
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:04.440]  up against evil and to admit there's good and evil I said I'd go to your calls
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:08.880]  just it you know it was hitting me this morning at about 5 30 a.m. when I was
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:15.160]  walking around outside listen to the coyotes howl that you know it's not it's
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:17.720]  that dichotomy of people that think you're a hero because you stand up to
[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:21.680]  evil versus people that say what are you gonna do about it just just get ahead
[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:25.560]  for yourself it's all going down anyways look at that attitude when you have that
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:29.680]  attitude ass oh what I just get into it or I you know just let you know try to
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:33.000]  take care of yourself when you have that attitude and think you're getting ahead
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:40.040]  everybody starts having it and society's implode very quickly very quickly very
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:45.120]  quickly and then you've got the third group but the general public see there
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:48.240]  oh it's good to stand up against evil or they get misdirected against evil that
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:51.400]  isn't really evil by the globalist or they're saying oh what are you gonna do
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:58.160]  about it no respect for yourself just add you can't change the world bull I've
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:01.760]  been on air 17 years let me tell you I've changed a lot of things because I've
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:04.880]  worked with our listeners we that love liberty together have done amazing
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:14.280]  things and I sincerely don't want people to have racial conflict I sincerely
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:18.600]  don't want MSNBC to hype up a bunch of election results which you know they're
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:23.880]  gonna try to do and to try to get a bunch of riots going on when it'll be used
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:28.280]  to take all of our freedoms and the systems geared up for it and it'll
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:32.160]  allow a lot of people that are racist against black folks to demonize black
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:36.320]  people in general and others because you know all the inner city poor people
[01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:40.400]  are going to join in on this and it's such a bad thing new threats to riot of
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:45.480]  Obama loses election buzz explodes across the web and these people don't
[01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:48.840]  even know it's been covered in the news they're saying this that we cannot find
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:53.040]  tweets or Facebook's where the predominantly black folks saying they're
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:40:01.280]  going to riot even know this is now a news issue because again only 25% of
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:08.040]  the American people in a new major study even read the news
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:14.400]  29% could name the vice president 73% couldn't correctly say why we fought the
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:20.040]  Civil War 44% were unable to define a bill of rights and 6% couldn't even
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:28.280]  circle independence day on a calendar and 25% don't read newspapers that's a
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:31.600]  new big national pullout
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:39.800]  let me tell you with a bunch of scientific globalist running things that
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:43.480]  is not a recipe for a good culture we're gonna go to your calls briefly don't
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:47.560]  forget I'm gonna have a 48 hour continued transmission with guest host
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:53.200]  myself David I George Norrie the list just goes on and on the full list is
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.360]  it info wars money bomb dot com we'd like to raise a half million dollars
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:00.520]  quite frankly as bad as things are in this world we have millions of listeners
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:04.720]  if all of you you know gave a dollar we'd have you know in a single day three
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:08.760]  million dollars the most we've ever raised is 500,000 sounds like a lot one
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.640]  piece of satellite uplink equipment we need about 120,000 it'll be about 60 70,000
[01:41:13.640 --> 01:41:17.720]  for the year to have it other file-sharing equipment a couple hundred thousand dollars
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:22.000]  now most stuff isn't on satellites they get it off these big fiber optic systems
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.760]  and archive the point is we need it I mean I can get the equipment and then not
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:30.880]  be able you know to operate of things implode or not be able to fight off any
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:35.080]  fake slapsuits or you know any type of garbage we need to raise half a million
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:38.360]  dollars we raise the million it'd be great and we're not funded by taxpayer
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:42.560]  money like MSNBC and others we are funded by you buying the books the

[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.400]  certainly gets the word out it's the 21st century version of pamphleteering
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.800]  our founders did people really pay attention and now the magazine the
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.560]  first two issues were in the newsprint now they're coming out glossy that we
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:17.280]  have the glossies available in bulk just absolutely gorgeous and we're gonna
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:23.600]  make the magazine even thicker it's 48 pages now we're gonna make it even
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:32.600]  thicker coming up in the next issue I mean it is it is powerful all the stuff

[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:56.480]  everybody and we'll also maybe we should put on on Justin TV and what was that
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:02.880]  other system we were using at Build-A-Bird Ustream we had like yeah but
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:06.920]  they'll turn the ads off for us is my next point yeah we need to talk to the
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:09.600]  head guy that's a listener and we'll probably listen right now and get that
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:14.280]  done and then there's also what else was I going to say we had 3.5 million
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:18.000]  viewers for Build-A-Bird here and a half ago the last Build-A-Bird only had
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000]  about a million viewers but that's still great while we're there covering it
[01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.880]  very very exciting to be able to circumvent mainstream media I have an
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:27.440]  audience better than Anderson Cooper each day you know via Ustream and
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:31.320]  Justin TV go to our Justin TV channel we've only fired up like four or five
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:36.120]  times over the years and it had 3.5 million in a three-day period one time
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:43.040]  okay that's enough for me again I got a bunch of economic news and former
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:46.440]  Travis County Sheriff coming in here in the last 30 minutes or so today Raymond
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:51.720]  Frank great guy but right now let's go to your calls and again it's Thomas
[01:44:51.720 --> 01:44:56.680]  soul his business insider at Chicago now it's examiner it's not just info wars
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:02.160]  calm pointing out all this rioting stuff it's very very serious and it's so big
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:05.760]  I can't even cover every angle of it we see all the massive preparations let's
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:10.720]  go to your phone calls here Nicholas in Pennsylvania what's your take on all
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:17.920]  this I think it's a pretty hairy situation we're all facing right now I'd
[01:45:17.920 --> 01:45:21.680]  like to know why you don't comment more on the battles that have been going on
[01:45:21.680 --> 01:45:27.080]  YouTube comment section with the fake Jews that are taken over the Internet
[01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:35.520]  the fake what the fake Jewish is what I would call them did you notice that the
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:41.560]  Internet's you know like your comment section seems to be monitored on YouTube
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.960]  I don't understand what you're talking about I might have 20 minutes a day to
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:51.560]  scan comments and see what people are saying we don't really have a lot of
[01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:55.640]  moderation except for calls for violence and that's on info wars in
[01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:59.120]  prison planet so we have somebody at night's later in the day that just looks
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.560]  for stuff like that because you know we've been subpoenaed before and at the
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:10.400]  FBI here before over and it's not fun as for the obsession with trolls and bots
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:16.320]  who inject racism into everything I talked about that earlier how I have
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:20.520]  found accounts that I guarantee you are not black folks saying horrible things
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:26.560]  racist things and it's its trolls who are racist trying to stir stuff up I
[01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:32.280]  have seen that but there's a but again there's a lot of people who really are
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:37.840]  planning violence if Obama doesn't get elected so a lot of that is just meant
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:41.720]  to flood the Internet you know they've caught some of the liberal groups posing
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:45.800]  as white supremacists before try to pass hate crimes laws and kind of their own
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:50.200]  false flag but I just don't spend all day on gossip and stuff and you know
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:54.800]  every day there's someone new announcing my career is over and I've been exposed
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:59.280]  and that's the end of me a rumors of my demise been greatly exaggerated every
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:04.400]  day I get shit emails or see comments where I've died every Saturday it's a
[01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:08.760]  new hoax that I'm dead and people like respond to the fact you're dead not
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:14.720]  just I you know one reason I've been successful is that I don't spend all my
[01:47:14.720 --> 01:47:20.960]  time sitting there in fighting and things like I don't spend any of my time
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:24.720]  let's go ahead and talk to Frank in Ohio Frank you're on the air do you have
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.560]  any comments here about just what I'd say tens of thousands I can't even track
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:33.960]  them all to a tweets and and Facebook's with people with real accounts saying
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:41.640]  they planned a riot of Mitt Romney isn't elected I mean it's ridiculous if you
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:46.600]  ask me the way the media and everything out the way the YouTube I mean my wife
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.880]  or a big family my wife says hello also we will be listening to YouTube videos
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.840]  every night we're a big fan but I think it's ridiculous I live over here in
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:57.800]  our streets for Ohio and you won't believe the stuff that's going on out
[01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:02.080]  here the people the way people are talking I go to Cleveland all the time
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.800]  the things that people are saying in Cleveland on YouTube like you said
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:11.000]  Facebook Twitter I mean why would people cause rise why would people I mean if
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.320]  you think about it that the lashes that you're putting out to us is this can
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:18.920]  possibly put us in martial law everybody out here that's gonna cause
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:23.360]  riots cause problems is gonna give the government gonna give the people the
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.680]  permission and the reality to put us into the martial law absolutely in fact I
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:31.440]  told Watson about videos that people calling for rioting he didn't even put
[01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:34.560]  those in the article because he's so overworked but people should send all
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:40.400]  your examples to show tips at info wars.com and I mean not just tweets
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:45.680]  there's videos what are you hearing there in Ohio I'm just the same thing
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:49.320]  it's going on all over Facebook and Twitter that it's racist if he doesn't
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:54.720]  if Obama doesn't get in it's racist if they they end up getting around me and
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:59.720]  well especially I don't trust either of them but I'd rather have Rodney back in
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:02.920]  but then again you know the both of them. Well here's the deal a record number of
[01:49:02.920 --> 01:49:06.920]  white people voted for Obama and I think they voted for him because they are
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:11.200]  racist they voted for him because they're racist and they're guilty about it
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:15.920]  and that's what I found your liberals are usually your real racist they'll
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:20.040]  act like they're not me I mean I grew up in Dallas Texas I'm 38 years old I'm
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:23.920]  way above this but that doesn't mean that I'm gonna bow down and say I'm bad
[01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:28.600]  and bow down it's just I'm sick of it all and the point is the Democrats use
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:34.160]  race-based politics Republicans do to a certain extent as well but yeah that's
[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:40.380]  what I hear on talk radio that's what I hear on on MSNBC every time I turn on
[01:49:40.380 --> 01:49:43.400]  MSNBC which I monitor I turn on a few times a day they got it on the back
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:47.680]  different channels we vary all the channels we've got like three TVs on
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:51.400]  one in there one in here and one in the coffee room one back in the reporters
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:55.160]  area one in this control room one back in that coffee area but the point is is
[01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:59.560]  that it's just constant it's racist if you don't support Obamacare it's racist
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:03.240]  if you aren't for more welfare it's racist if you don't want affirmative
[01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:09.400]  action it's racist this racist that riot this riot that anything else sir I
[01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:13.920]  mean I had one word not to jump off topic or anything but remember a couple
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:19.360]  months ago when you were on you were doing the YouTube video about the
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:24.720]  blackhawks that were out doing the training around those the city the
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:29.400]  downtown cities everywhere yeah urban warfare yes me and my wife stepped out
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:32.720]  of our house today the ground was literally shaking I don't get around we
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:36.400]  live off the turnpike and a trailer we came out of house we thought nothing
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:39.800]  other would start again worse really our cars started shaking there was six
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:44.600]  blackhawks fully loaded four people on each two people on each side with their
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:50.160]  gun drawn flying right prior to 50 to 60 feet over our telephone yeah I know it's
[01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:55.080]  total acclimation and for 20 years if you see them with guns aimed at you you
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:50:58.360]  didn't see that helicopter even if you videotape it you're a crazy black
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:02.120]  helicopter person even as troops run checkpoints the worst drought in 50
[01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:06.120]  years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on
[01:51:06.120 --> 01:51:11.060]  record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but
[01:51:11.060 --> 01:51:15.840]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:19.440]  to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:23.360]  your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food
[01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:27.560]  cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eat foods direct
[01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:31.200]  now as the price of raw ingredients increases eat foods will have to raise
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:35.160]  prices too now is the time to get your supply I recently increased my supply
[01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:38.280]  from eat foods direct because we've all known this was coming you know about

[02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:37.320]  guest joining us I appreciate folks calling in I've got to remember to
[02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:41.600]  plug where listeners are calling from we just had a caller listening on XM now
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:47.480]  we've got a listener watching on PrisonPlanet.tv Lonnie Thads also
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:52.320]  watching on PrisonPlanet.tv from Illinois sad you're there in Illinois one
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:56.600]  of the cities slated to go up and flame statistically what you calling about are
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:01:02.400]  you concerned about the threats to riot if Obama doesn't win again oh yeah
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:06.480]  definitely Alex I remember them right they had one they had the Rodney King
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:14.600]  beating deal that brought that up but I was calling in for two points today yes
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:19.160]  I want to give you well I start sitting there waking up drink my coffee and on
[02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:24.720]  the view but they said the Coca-Cola or the vice president or steel on the
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:28.840]  company's sent out letters to their employees saying that if Romney wasn't
[02:01:28.840 --> 02:01:34.440]  voted in and Obama got in again if they were gonna lose their job and by the way
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:39.720]  he was pointing out that that if they have to buy the health care as well my
[02:01:39.720 --> 02:01:43.000]  crew I've asked almost none of them won health care as we never got I just pay
[02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:46.800]  them more people don't get they take they take your money and get you the
[02:01:46.800 --> 02:01:51.360]  health care and health care prices are going up and so it'll be hard for me to
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:55.280]  keep our 50 crew and well the contractors don't everybody let me go to
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:01:58.280]  contractors and I'll have to hire a hundred people and have them all be part
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:03.280]  time I mean it'll be hard for me we really need this money bomb to pay for
[02:02:03.280 --> 02:02:06.920]  Obamacare but hey don't think it'll go away when Mitt Romney gets in I'm sorry
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:11.560]  I'm cutting you off go ahead and the other point you you and Lindsay talked a
[02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:15.440]  while back about the Bible and how there's the fake Bible and the real
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:19.240]  there's you know I was wanting to get one of those I think we're headed for deep
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:25.080]  you know what I remember you guys were talking about the they rewritten a Bible
[02:02:25.080 --> 02:02:28.400]  and I was wondering what I couldn't remember what you guys said I could not
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.840]  King James version from all the scholars I've researched and my own research is
[02:02:32.840 --> 02:02:38.000]  about as good as it's gonna get the King James is a masterpiece okay well
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:41.000]  thanks Alex I appreciate anything you guys doing all right thank you so much
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.140]  yeah they they continue to find Dead Sea Scrolls and other scrolls and they
[02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:50.640]  fought releasing it for a while because a bunch of humanists and atheists were
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:54.840]  involved in it but more as it gets released it's exact translation I mean
[02:02:54.840 --> 02:02:59.960]  it that's a miracle in and of itself but the real miracle is is the Jewish
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:05.240]  scribes and Jewish priests just keep those scrolls and pass them down and are
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:12.280]  true to the text and so they were trained by those folks the Christian people
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:17.560]  that I mean most of them that wrote you know the Bible inspired but copied down
[02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:21.160]  what happened at the time were Jewish so they were trained as priests a lot of
[02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:29.360]  them in it and how to absolutely you know fill it out the way it was in the
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:32.400]  Hebrew and in the Greek I'm not gonna get into a whole argument about that but
[02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:35.840]  I've studied it to some extent I'm still an obvious yeah and they're saying the
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:43.160]  King James 1611 as well does that answer your question sir he's gone let's
[02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:47.960]  Shannon one more maybe hold him over Brian in New Jersey Android app welcome
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:53.520]  well how you doing this afternoon good brother very good I'm pretty good to
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:58.560]  comment that you're present or actually planet info word.com I started group up
[02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:01.560]  actually met with one of the guys over the weekend actually taught me a lot
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:06.200]  about survivalism preparedness that's what it's for camping survival dating
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:11.360]  you name it yeah absolutely really informative actually brought me a can
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:15.640]  of beans that would actually last me 200 years and some butter I was actually
[02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:19.720]  really surprised and just when we knew where I was standing compared to you
[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:24.560]  know other people who are listeners out there have been you know preparing for
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:30.240]  longer than I have now also my second point I'm not sure if you're aware but
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:37.160]  I live in Southern Jersey was near a nice little town of Handen New Jersey well
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:42.240]  what they've done in Handen is they have taken out probably about 75% of the
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:45.400]  police force and they have now put in stay there come back and recap that I'm
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:47.800]  gonna come right back to you out of the break I want to hear about this yeah
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:51.440]  they're cutting police all over and only allowing the cops that stayed to do
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:55.880]  revenue generation so the cops will purely be there to collect money to give
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:05:02.000]  to the banks and the average cop doesn't even know that the worst drought in 50
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:06.040]  years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on
[02:05:06.040 --> 02:05:10.960]  record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but
[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:15.720]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost
[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:19.360]  to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up
[02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:23.280]  your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food
[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:27.440]  cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:31.080]  now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise
[02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:35.040]  prices too now is the time to get your supply I recently increased my supply
[02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:38.200]  from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming you know about

[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:05.760]  the food police shut down food co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans are
[02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:09.400]  losing access not just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but the healthy
[02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:13.280]  homecrafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it
[02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:16.560]  seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:20.160]  bacteria but frankly I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these
[02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:22.920]  remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history with
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:26.080]  archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:30.400]  the globe in almost every culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:34.880]  fermented porges Koreans eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:38.240]  healthy living but here's some good news self-reliant Americans can now

[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:25.240]  through your phone calls right now in this segment ahead of a bunch of other
[02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:30.560]  economic news I haven't gotten to yet and we're talking about riots in this
[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:36.400]  country it's in business insider it's in creator syndicate it's in Chicago now
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:42.000]  info wars.com the economic collapse blog.com it is all over the place and
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.560]  Paul Watson has a new article out new threats for riot if Obama loses election
[02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:51.560]  flooding Twitter Facebook by the thousands and that's what we've been
[02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:55.880]  talking about what will happen if there's riots after the elections will they
[02:08:55.880 --> 02:08:59.560]  use it to declare civil emergency is that why the army admits they're gearing
[02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:05.320]  up for record civil emergency why is MSNBC hyping that it's racist if you
[02:09:05.320 --> 02:09:09.560]  don't vote for Obama this is the divide and conquer that the globalists are
[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:15.480]  using against the American people and it's truly truly disgusting let's go
[02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:21.080]  back to your calls right now let's talk to Brian in New Jersey okay Brian what's
[02:09:21.080 --> 02:09:32.040]  going on there in New Jersey well I'm a white male about 23 and let's put this
[02:09:32.040 --> 02:09:36.160]  with I were to go in there I would probably be stopped by the cops and then
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:41.200]  taking a jail probably had to spend the night for some drug charge one thing or
[02:09:41.200 --> 02:09:48.120]  another and now with that what I said before is they are now dropping about
[02:09:48.120 --> 02:09:51.080]  75 percent of the police force now they're putting the state troopers in there
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:55.400]  and what I feel that's kind of a buffer toward what I would consider a martial
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:59.240]  wall if he's a mental it now you'll see you know with the drone flying over the
[02:09:59.240 --> 02:10:04.720]  fair it's a really bad area a lot of gun violence and now no in New Jersey we
[02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:08.680]  have a zero carry wall you can't even have a shotgun in your truck there no
[02:10:08.680 --> 02:10:12.240]  that's right they disarm the people and that's always where the crime zones are
[02:10:12.240 --> 02:10:17.640]  and we see all over the country it not just in the east or the west
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:23.160]  you know on the major coastlines there's the headline gritty New Jersey City of
[02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:27.760]  Camman to scrap police department amid budget woes again and the more taxes you
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:32.360]  pay the more tickets they write the less revenue there is because it collapses the
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:38.160]  society that's the planet spreading not just Detroit not just LA not just areas
[02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:43.080]  of New Jersey all over the country it's rotting I remember three years ago two
[02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:47.760]  and a half years ago they announced 35 crimes that Oakland California won't
[02:10:47.760 --> 02:10:52.920]  respond to including breaking and entering I mean it is just a license to
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:56.920]  kill and steal and then all over the country they're announcing daytime
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:11:01.160]  curfews I saw this in Arkansas last year where we're just gonna stop you at
[02:11:01.160 --> 02:11:05.640]  checkpoints and search during the day in this town or nighttime curfews for
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:12.280]  adults as well in places in Kentucky and yes our country is being eased into
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:15.640]  martial law the police have been militarized they have urban warfare
[02:11:15.640 --> 02:11:20.880]  drills now real army checkpoints it goes from drills to real checkpoints the
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:24.160]  army times announces troops are gonna be on the streets they're suddenly your
[02:11:24.160 --> 02:11:28.600]  local prom the TSA is there but the border is wide open and the government
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:34.240]  ships guns into Mexico yes this is the artificial takedown of America by the
[02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:38.560]  ultra-rich live-off shore and their armored compounds and this is how they
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:43.480]  do it this is a military takeover of America what else is happening in your
[02:11:43.480 --> 02:11:50.000]  area well other than that other than a very very happy police force and you
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.600]  know I don't really like to bash the police force I have a lot of firemen
[02:11:52.600 --> 02:11:57.720]  friends but the thing is it just seems like this pair of military is going on
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:03.000]  where they need to walk around with their chest out and say what are you
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.320]  doing why are you doing that you need to stop right now and then they're gonna
[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:11.840]  say okay well you know you windows down let me open up your car and let me
[02:12:11.840 --> 02:12:15.120]  search through everything that you know you live in martial law you are a
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:19.880]  suspect until proven slave it's the end of America it's beyond third-world
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:25.120]  countries I've been to and this is it I mean in Mexico they shake you down for
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:29.280]  security in Mexico they search your car for security in North Korea they do that
[02:12:29.280 --> 02:12:35.560]  this is this is I really appreciate your call we talk about the police so much
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:38.800]  here because that's where the rubber meets the road
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:43.800]  tyranny will be enforced by police in any country we know North Korea is bad we
[02:12:43.800 --> 02:12:48.560]  know Nigeria is bad we know Indonesia is bad with their police we know Mexico is
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:54.640]  bad Guatemala Mala Nicaragua El Salvador we know that hundreds of
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:58.920]  third-world countries the police absolutely enslaved the people for the
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:03.280]  ultra-rich and the people are scared and the cops swagger around I've been in
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:08.600]  third-world countries and cops swaggering around it's embarrassing for them how
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:12.400]  they have criminal eyes how they're trying to scare people how they enjoy
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:16.480]  the fear they hire people that like that and that's the death of our country
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.880]  and they hire people now in many big departments to be like that and it's the
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:25.000]  death of America and hey cops all your prosperity goes up the window to with
[02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:30.360]  that you're being destroyed as well and it's it's just disgusting to watch it
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:33.840]  happen and even when they're professional and violate your rights
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:36.960]  they're doing it because things are falling apart and they've got to do
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:43.960]  something the globalists are the ones making it fall apart and it's not like
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:49.080]  that's my opinion the globalist brag about all this stuff let's go to Phil
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:54.160]  Ian Boston Phil you're on the air welcome hey buddy how are you pretty good my
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:14:00.840]  friend well you know I live in Waltham Massachusetts Massachusetts BVB maybe the
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:04.960]  least awake state in the country you feel sometimes I feel very lonely up
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:10.040]  there but you know what you know if there are riots boy Waltham is prepared
[02:14:10.040 --> 02:14:14.960]  because they just got one of those special response tanks one of those
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:20.680]  armored it looks like an armored truck with turret holes out the side that's
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:25.280]  what it seems you know to stick guns up at these this thing is literally like
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:30.200]  shaking the ground that the drives around town and no one seems to care now
[02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:34.720]  every major police department even small ones aren't getting old army surplus
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:39.800]  armored vehicles they're getting big modern homeland security war wagons I
[02:14:39.800 --> 02:14:43.840]  see federal police all over the streets now I see federal police armored
[02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:49.040]  vehicles big trucks surveillance grids because it's all planned how many years
[02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:54.520]  have I told people all this is planned and people are going to beg for martial
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:58.600]  law during this economic collapse I don't know if it's gonna be riots wars
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:05.040]  what their major trigger are but it's all planned and then you got a public
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:11.000]  less than 25% read newspapers who are going to sit there and literally beg for
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:15.440]  it and then it'll be people criticizing the government or not letting things get
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:19.640]  better I'm glad they arrested that talk show host you're like that's the first
[02:15:19.640 --> 02:15:25.160]  amendment oh you're one of them I've had clean-cut reporters like Linda West out
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:29.920]  on the street in downtown Austin on a sidewalk interviewing people and
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:33.760]  somebody comes over in a suit and tie we got video of him and calls the police
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:38.000]  on them saying that that asking if people think the government's out of
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.000]  control was terrorism and the guy runs off calls the police and they can the
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:49.480]  police came I mean this is America folks I mean these people would love to put us
[02:15:49.480 --> 02:15:54.280]  in death camps right now and again the Army's own training manuals public for
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:59.880]  four months says re-education camp they think we're so stupid that they even use
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:04.440]  the Soviet term I'm not calling what they have in their re-education camp it
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:14.280]  says re-education camp re-education camp that's like saying we have a pitch to
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:18.900]  shoot people in I mean my love's no big deal I'm sorry sir go ahead well is
[02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:22.600]  there any chance you can call Homeland Security like you do I love when you call
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:26.440]  them up directly and warn them about these threats and you know see some
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:30.720]  things say something or whatever see what they say see if they just totally blow
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:34.360]  you off well there's probably a bunch of their people out there revocaturing it
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:39.360]  I mean how many times have we caught the feds revocaturing riots how many times
[02:16:39.360 --> 02:16:44.560]  you get even if it's nothing you know the word is the LA riots were actually
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:47.680]  triggered by some operatives and started robbing some stores first and telling
[02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:51.080]  people to do it and then some idiots you know attack the first truck they saw
[02:16:51.080 --> 02:16:54.680]  a regional dining and then it went from there I mean I'm telling you folks
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:59.000]  they're playing at something big and the cops have said get ready for late
[02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.080]  October early November and I asked the cops well what are they saying it's for
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:08.040]  well they won't say it's the election or maybe it's an Iran strike but by getting
[02:17:08.040 --> 02:17:13.680]  the word out we may back it off well they also like to pull things off in the
[02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:17.600]  winter because people are less likely to go out and protest and that's something
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:21.160]  everybody should think about that that happens quite a lot well there's riots
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:25.000]  people aren't going to be watching a bank holiday or an Iran war I mean it's
[02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.360]  everything's gearing up towards a coming to a head I appreciate your great
[02:17:29.360 --> 02:17:36.240]  points Lonnie in Arkansas watching on prison planet dot TV Lonnie welcome how
[02:17:36.240 --> 02:17:40.280]  you doing this afternoon I'm just I'm seeing all the warning signs and I'm
[02:17:40.280 --> 02:17:47.000]  hoping I'm wrong I am to you look I'm I'm a service-connected disabled army
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:55.760]  veteran 13 plus years and spent 10 years as narrow scout on Kyle was yesterday I
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:04.560]  had two UH one wise flake gray no markings of any kind no tail numbers
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:12.040]  nothing about 50 feet over the house and they were probably doing about 110 120
[02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:21.280]  knots and what I'm looking for is a false flag going off right around election
[02:18:21.280 --> 02:18:30.480]  time all I know is there are more than 20 confirmed news articles the last month
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:35.560]  of real army checkpoints on highways all the sudden and it makes me get chills
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:39.000]  they're now not just doing drills it's happening we're going under martial law
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.080]  and people are like where's the martial law because they think TSA at highway
[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:48.200]  checkpoints in the army isn't martial law what do you think about this massive
[02:18:48.200 --> 02:18:52.080]  acceleration what do you think is happening I don't recognize my country
[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:58.640]  no more you know it's not the country that I went and served when Vietnam was
[02:18:58.640 --> 02:19:07.280]  going on you know I mean everything is turned upside down it's a police state
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:13.200]  DHS comes out again at the fall tunnel and and it's sitting there saying that
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:18.960]  the the veterans are enemy that were domestic terrorists well they know
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:23.040]  you're the ones that are trained and won't go along with the takeover this is
[02:19:23.040 --> 02:19:27.440]  a real I hope the police and young military understand they're gonna start
[02:19:27.440 --> 02:19:31.920]  a civil war they think they're gonna order you to go grab this guy Lonnie out
[02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:34.920]  of his house which I don't think it's gonna be very a healthy thing to do
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:45.400]  Lonnie I hear you Lonnie I know I hear you we've been taking over we're in the
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:51.240]  process of it anything else you wanted to add no no that's just pretty much it
[02:19:51.240 --> 02:19:57.520]  you know just stuff that I've been noticing you know and you really think
[02:19:57.520 --> 02:20:03.080]  a false flag's coming all right Aaron full in here as the food police shut
[02:20:03.080 --> 02:20:07.440]  down food co-ops the Amish and small farmers Americans are losing access not
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:11.040]  just a raw milk and homemade cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for
[02:20:11.040 --> 02:20:14.680]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:18.560]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not
[02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:21.680]  sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:24.520]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for
[02:20:24.520 --> 02:20:27.680]  fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every

[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:20.040]  we're waiting on a sheriff Raymond Frank he's I don't think he's ever been to
[02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:23.520]  this studio before I've interviewed him out on the road I'm trying to find it
[02:24:23.520 --> 02:24:25.960]  we'll see if he gets here to be in studio if not it'll come in tomorrow or
[02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:32.280]  something just a great guy we're gonna continue with your calls and also get
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:36.760]  into more of the news here but I was just thinking during the break I mean
[02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:43.560]  there are news articles from California to South Carolina from Texas to Illinois
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:49.880]  or regular Army not just National Guard like Empire Shield in New York but
[02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:57.960]  regular Army regular Marines with loaded sidearms are running checkpoints and I
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:25:01.320]  mean it's in the news oh the oh you drive up there's Marines with Beretta
[02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:05.120]  nine millimeters on their sides and hum these and we're just gonna search your
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:10.440]  car today man I mean folks it's one thing you pull up to cops and they're
[02:25:10.440 --> 02:25:14.600]  violating the Fourth Amendment and the Tenth Amendment but but I mean now the
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:19.160]  military and I now see articles every week started in Colorado earlier this
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:22.640]  year now they'll have a bank robbery in an hour later they'll just shut down a
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:30.960]  whole highway with guns and it showed it on the news cops walking up with M16s
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:35.920]  pointing them at families in their cars I mean you know that's kind of getting
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:40.720]  to the point where you just want to point M16s at us well I mean again folks
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:48.680]  once this stuff starts patriots conservatives libertarians
[02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:56.720]  we don't go out and riot folks I mean if the government starts a war with the
[02:25:56.720 --> 02:26:03.800]  American people it's gonna be 1776 style I mean of course Homeland Security says
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:09.520]  veterans are the number one terrorist threat they say that's who they believe
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:14.360]  gonna attack because they're gonna start a civil war with you and listen the
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:20.560]  average military and police folks today that I talked to are waking up to this
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:30.560]  but you've got to go past that because now they've got dramas on ABC NBC CBS you
[02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:33.720]  see the shows I mean I've seen the trailers and the promos and the
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:37.640]  breakdowns and in every episode and every show they're evil right-wing gun
[02:26:37.640 --> 02:26:41.680]  owner veterans who won't turn their guns in who also are immoral and hurt
[02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:47.920]  children and murder people and are bad and are racist I love me the Second
[02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:51.360]  Amendment I hate me some black people let's go blow up a building and kill
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:56.320]  some kids that's how the shows are so that cops and everybody watching this
[02:26:56.320 --> 02:27:06.880]  suspend disbelief and psychologically now think of the American people who are
[02:27:06.880 --> 02:27:10.800]  for the Second Amendment and anti-New World Order that that we're terrorist I
[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:14.880]  mean they have shows where you know a guy's gonna nerve gas New York and he
[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:18.600]  believes in chemtrails or they have shows where you're a Ron Paul supporter
[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:22.200]  and you're a drug dealing murderer or that I mean and then it's admitted in the
[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:27.920]  news that it's government paid for to have these messages and people 25% or
[02:27:27.920 --> 02:27:31.520]  less read newspapers people sick there and they watch that that's why now
[02:27:31.520 --> 02:27:35.040]  they're seeing a phenomenon where stars of these shows that play the part of
[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:39.440]  American terrorists are getting confronted and assaulted and stuff
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:43.600]  because people walk up and go you're that terrorist and they're like no I'm an
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:52.400]  I'm an actor no you're not your terror they don't even know folks that's how
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:58.480]  dumb they are I mean listen I've talked to some police most of them are awake
[02:27:58.480 --> 02:28:01.240]  now that I've talked to but that's not in some of these big corrupt mafia run
[02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:06.360]  cities that haven't been fully federalized yet you know there's some of
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:10.000]  the local police departments so the other departments aren't pure evil yet at
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:14.280]  least not at the lower ranks but a lot of them are and they actually believe
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:17.720]  yeah that we're gonna have a war with the veterans we're gonna have a war with
[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:20.440]  people that believe in a world government you're like hey let me show
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:24.960]  you some news articles where they admit that your world government's being set
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:30.120]  up and I mean I tried to give some cops the other day they had part of downtown
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:35.920]  shut down for ACL Fest speaking of that the idiot guitar player from again
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:39.320]  doesn't mean I'm for Romney it's that you've got this idiot guitar player on

[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:19.960]  the I think the first sheriff in the country before there were even laws to
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:23.720]  say stop throwing people in jail for marijuana your friends of course with
[02:34:23.720 --> 02:34:28.520]  Willie Nelson and other such evil people because you think the jails ought
[02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:34.120]  to have violent offenders in them but I wish you'd be our sheriff again that
[02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:37.720]  would be awesome and Ray it's good to have you here with us thank you thank
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:40.760]  you Alex really an honor to be here oh it's an honor to have you what do you

[02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:51.280]  figure out what's going on and but I'll say this if I'm the sheriff my loyalty
[02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:56.640]  will be to the citizens of Travis County 100% in other words I won't sign up with
[02:34:56.640 --> 02:35:01.160]  a federal government on some stupid program that would be adverse to our
[02:35:01.160 --> 02:35:07.600]  citizens in Travis County well I tell you so much is going on let's just look
[02:35:07.600 --> 02:35:10.400]  at the marijuana issue I know you don't smoke it I don't smoke it but George
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:13.720]  Washington grew it and did smoke it I have that magazine there that's in front
[02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:16.040]  of you the new info wars magazine I'm gonna give you a few copies here when
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:20.680]  you go yeah and in there's an ad for hemp oil that doesn't even have THC it's
[02:35:20.680 --> 02:35:24.280]  another you know variant of the plant and I've had people say how dare you even
[02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:28.160]  have hemp oil that's legally imported not allowed to grow it in the US that's
[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:31.360]  the you know that's been proven for good for the stomach anti-cancer you name it
[02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:34.720]  and they and I've been basically been accused by quite a few people of being
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:39.600]  evil so they think even hemp you know even if it's a shirt of hemp is evil
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:43.920]  because you know the chemical companies say so how do you battle ignorance of
[02:35:43.920 --> 02:35:47.600]  that level and go back and tell folks what you did with a marijuana enforcement
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:51.880]  Travis County well I stuck my head out when I I was elected in my first year in
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:56.800]  office of 73 and I volunteered to appear before the senator sprudence
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:02.080]  committee in our state Senate and and my advocated that it should be lowered from
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:07.040]  10 years in the slammer 10 years in the state penitentiary to a misdemeanor and
[02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:12.200]  I took a lot of heat from that but I'm glad I did that and and now I think it's
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:17.840]  time to move on and and have no penitentiary up or jail time involved
[02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:22.000]  and if somebody is arrested for I just don't think she should be arrested it
[02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:27.080]  should be illegalized I said I said 14 states last week I was corrected it's
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:31.800]  like 18 states have said decriminalized that doesn't mean legalized taxed all
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:35.960]  that and the feds just won't stop including Obama he promised to let the
[02:36:35.960 --> 02:36:42.200]  states do what they want but he's a liar yeah yeah that's that's too bad I don't
[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:46.360]  know whether if I'm elected I don't whether this next legislature we can
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:51.040]  do anything because we have nothing written on the books yet but what do
[02:36:51.040 --> 02:36:54.440]  you think about people that think in my magazine when I advertise quality hemp
[02:36:54.440 --> 02:36:58.520]  products that have no THC in it different variant of the plan people think
[02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:02.720]  I'm dealing marijuana well what do you say to the people that really think
[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:08.600]  that religion that to antagonize you and and so forth no see you 20 only 25
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:11.160]  percent of people read newspapers now they don't they actually think it's
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:17.320]  marijuana earlier yeah that's a new big study out today well there's a lot of
[02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:24.280]  uninformed people and but we don't need to be arresting these young kids and
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:27.760]  put them in jail when you are a lieutenant I have a son a grandson that
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:33.360]  is put in jail because of a soil bottom small amount of marijuana amazing well
[02:37:33.360 --> 02:37:38.280]  well they need you know fresh meat for the private prisons I don't know about
[02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:42.200]  private prisons well you know a lot of these prisons actually are yeah yeah
[02:37:42.200 --> 02:37:46.600]  they're privatized yeah I don't want to do that I think the I think the county
[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:51.080]  should run the jail what would you do it as sheriff have elected coming up in
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:55.680]  three weeks and how can people get behind you to do that to do what to I
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:00.560]  do get elected sheriff well I have a lot going for me now
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:05.920]  unfortunately for the incumbent he has a lot of dirty laundry and baggage that's
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:09.720]  following them and I just don't think he has a snowball chance of hell of being
[02:38:09.720 --> 02:38:13.880]  elected sheriff because people you know he's getting a lot of money from strip
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:20.640]  joints not only here in Travis County but in Las Vegas and Houston and people
[02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:25.840]  aren't gonna put up with that he's getting well thirty nine thousand five
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:30.480]  hundred dollars since two thousand two thousand five to two thousand twelve he's
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:38.040]  gotten eleven thousand dollars from beer wine and alcohol people citizens of
[02:38:38.040 --> 02:38:43.400]  Travis County don't want that and what would you do in elected sheriff what
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:47.840]  would be the first three or four things you do well the first thing I want to do
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:54.200]  is he has what I call a ticket writing frenzy he has dozens and dozens and
[02:38:54.200 --> 02:39:01.440]  dozens of patrolmen that do nothing but give tickets and he does that on on
[02:39:01.440 --> 02:39:05.840]  roads that's being controlled by the city of Austin and other suburban cities
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:10.680]  in our county we're gonna put a stop to that I want these people to get out in
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:14.480]  the neighborhoods and protect my home I never I live in the unincorporated area
[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:18.000]  Travis County I never see a patrolman on my street now they're always all right
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.920]  and tickets that's right they're down at the bottom of the hill I live on
[02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:24.680]  Camino Alto you know where I live yeah they're down there I haven't seen them
[02:39:24.680 --> 02:39:27.920]  in about a month so I think they're slowing up because you've been talking
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:33.160]  about it on because of you know because of the election coming up but we're
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:38.240]  gonna do away with that and and what bothers me is what's gonna what are I
[02:39:38.240 --> 02:39:42.400]  gonna do with all the personnel they have that he has a hundred and twenty one
[02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:47.760]  no a hundred and twenty one patrolmen and officers that take vehicles home at
[02:39:47.760 --> 02:39:53.280]  night back and forth and the county pays for that they pay for the gasoline
[02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:57.800]  and everything and I'm not gonna be given tickets like that so I'm gonna
[02:39:57.800 --> 02:40:02.800]  have a lot of surplus people really what do you think about massive layoffs of
[02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:06.160]  police and sheriff's departments nationwide and they say we're not gonna
[02:40:06.160 --> 02:40:10.040]  respond to calls as much anymore we're just gonna raise money well then who
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:14.240]  even needs the police or the sheriff's departments if they don't even respond to
[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:18.760]  major crimes that's absolutely terrible hi you know that's that's not right I
[02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:24.680]  don't want my patrolmen to be revenuers no that's not their job to do that and
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:28.640]  well plus the big secret is that money ends up most of it getting taken away
[02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:32.880]  anyways and ferreted off to banks and bonds and investments yeah they tell the
[02:40:32.880 --> 02:40:35.880]  police go out and write tickets will go bankrupt but notice they're writing more
[02:40:35.880 --> 02:40:38.560]  tickets than ever and they're shutting them down everywhere I know there's not
[02:40:38.560 --> 02:40:42.240]  enough money to ever pay off the new world order it's designed to implode us
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:48.160]  yeah I agree with you I agree I can't tell you what's gonna happen it's it's
[02:40:48.160 --> 02:40:53.280]  horrible what do you think of our days of data and the you know the federal
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:56.760]  funding to go out and have these rubber stamp warrants and suck blood on the
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:02.320]  highways I think it's horrible I'm against it first of all I don't think
[02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:05.840]  we should be taking that federal money I don't want federal money well it's our
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:09.760]  money they already took yeah it's incredible but I may have to take something
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:13.240]  something was already been signed up for but I don't believe in that that's what
[02:41:13.240 --> 02:41:16.880]  Ron Paul people say he's a hypocrite he doesn't do earmarks but once it comes
[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:20.480]  anyways he takes it yeah I mean it's already coming what do you do you know
[02:41:20.480 --> 02:41:24.480]  yeah well but I'm not gonna sign up for any new programs that will make it come
[02:41:24.480 --> 02:41:28.360]  you know now you were loved as Sheriff I've you know I've looked into it
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:36.280]  Willie Nelson loves you and you were in for eight years so from what 73 to 88 yeah yeah yeah eight
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:42.840]  years yeah well I tried to be a good sheriff I was you know I I believed in
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:45.960]  the people and they believed in me and I want to help people I want to be a
[02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:50.120]  peace officer I don't want to be a law enforcement officer period I want to be a
[02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:55.240]  peace officer my people and you got to understand that everything one of my
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:41:59.160]  deputies does it just like me doing it if they're driving a car that's like me
[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:05.680]  driving it so I'm gonna really be careful of of what they're doing I notice
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:09.400]  you've been getting some traction you have a chance to win Raymond Frank comm
[02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:12.040]  people want to read your amazing history you know back when you were a
[02:42:12.040 --> 02:42:14.960]  Lieutenant Colonel the Air Force after being a pilot doing criminal
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:18.960]  investigations could you ever imagined and I know dealing with the Soviets and
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:22.600]  stuff in Germany could you have ever imagined that America would become like
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:27.800]  the Soviet Union I know I don't know I was a special agent I was actually a
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:31.800]  spook and I worked in Berlin Berlin was a capital of the spook capital of the
[02:42:31.800 --> 02:42:36.920]  world they have all these nations had spooks there and Bob Chapman the rest
[02:42:36.920 --> 02:42:41.120]  is a good rest in P.C. what he was doing so he did that yeah he was in the Army
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:47.080]  and I never imagined I never thought that this would happen to our country but
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:52.040]  it sure is back when you were working as a spook in the Air Force in Berlin if
[02:42:52.040 --> 02:42:56.320]  they would have told you hey in 2012 there'll be Army checkpoints the
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:43:00.080]  governmental ship guns in a Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and the TSA
[02:43:00.080 --> 02:43:06.160]  will take women who don't want to be taken into rooms and strip them yeah the
[02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:09.480]  NSA will be listing everybody without warrants would you have thought they
[02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:14.640]  were crazy absolutely unbelievable you just couldn't believe it
[02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:20.280]  what would people have done back then if they would have seen that well if you
[02:43:20.280 --> 02:43:23.960]  would advocate that they'd think you were crazy you know for one thing you
[02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:31.240]  know how that is I people wouldn't stand for but nowadays people are seen to be
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:35.800]  programmed to just go along to get along or something I don't know it's it's
[02:43:35.800 --> 02:43:41.800]  strange you know it's amazing because I studied the Soviets and everything we're
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:45.320]  going under is like right out of a Soviet playbook I mean it is it is but we
[02:43:45.320 --> 02:43:48.320]  still got free speech and things but they're trying to curtail that now you've
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:51.680]  been standing up mildly for the First Amendment in many ways on and off the
[02:43:51.680 --> 02:43:56.760]  air what else do you want listeners and voters to know I mean generally we're
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:00.160]  we're being heard all over the world right now not just Travis County what
[02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:03.600]  do you think of Sheriff Richard Mack who I know has been supporting you and his
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:08.240]  move for people to rediscover the sheriff and the true role of the sheriff
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:11.640]  because you know they're trying to get rid of the sheriff nationwide yeah I know
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:17.160]  they're so bad to get they advocate that but it's a constitutional office and we
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:20.720]  get our commission from the from the governor from the governor of the state
[02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:24.880]  of Texas state legislature you you are elected by the people yeah I know but we
[02:44:24.880 --> 02:44:28.240]  could work we're commissioned by the governor of Texas yes he gives us a car
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:34.520]  to carry out ID card I'll have still have line from the previous governors but
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:40.000]  it's not we're gonna we're not gonna give it up but it was tried though several
[02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.840]  years ago when they were rewriting the Constitution when they're rewriting
[02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:46.560]  Ronnie Earl was the yeah they hate police that are actually elected that's a
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:50.040]  horrible idea they were they were setting up that makes perfect sense of
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:53.640]  course you should elect the sheriff and I mean that's that's but no brainer but
[02:44:53.640 --> 02:44:58.000]  Ronnie Earl and that in the and our big judge for it was with the Texas
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:03.120]  government they were advocating that the sheriff be provided by the House of
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:07.800]  Representatives in other words if one was needed oh yeah I tell you boy Ronnie
[02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:12.480]  Earl he's a pretty scary guy and I you know I got the word out as the best I
[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:17.240]  could do other sheriffs throughout Texas what they were doing you know and we
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:22.880]  can't allow that and if I'm elected I'm gonna try to get on be the
[02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:27.440]  representative that's all right heard on what's going on explain the office of
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:30.000]  the sheriff and why it's so important I mean it's one of the oldest elected
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:35.960]  offices since the Magna Carta I mean it's well yeah it's the beginning of the
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:40.160]  republic system in Texas we had sheriffs when we weren't even a state we
[02:45:40.160 --> 02:45:44.400]  were just a republic we had sheriffs we were serving civil papers now our
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:48.080]  sheriff's department does not serve civil papers at all they've slept that off
[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:54.480]  onto the constables we're going to get back into serving papers and the Texas
[02:45:54.480 --> 02:45:57.880]  law is that we're we're the representative it's in writing that the
[02:45:57.880 --> 02:46:03.240]  sheriff will represent this the House of Representatives and the Senate on
[02:46:03.240 --> 02:46:08.200]  getting out subpoenas and others and other papers like that and it's a shame
[02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:11.400]  that we're not in it but but yeah that duties the real power will notice they
[02:46:11.400 --> 02:46:14.200]  just want to take it away and because God forbid the people ever elected a
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:18.640]  sheriff secretrations that should be our job you never want to get a
[02:46:18.640 --> 02:46:24.360]  secretration because that's when we come after your property you know so I'm
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:28.520]  gonna set the example and I'm going to and the people are gonna hear from me
[02:46:28.520 --> 02:46:34.080]  just like they when I was sheriff before if I want to I want the people to know
[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:38.160]  what's going on there now you don't know I know about accidents that have
[02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:43.120]  happened serious ones the sheriffs had a deputies the people don't even know
[02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:48.320]  about it and that used to be covered remember a long time ago 30 years ago
[02:46:48.320 --> 02:46:52.640]  now you just do whatever the government now media takes a press release from
[02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:56.360]  every department and just repeats it as if it's true government could say that
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:47:01.800]  you know Lucky Charms elves are gonna land in in Zilker Park tomorrow and the
[02:47:01.800 --> 02:47:05.400]  media would be out there waiting for Lucky Charms elves to land I mean they
[02:47:05.400 --> 02:47:09.720]  just repeat whatever they're told yeah well I've been sending press releases in
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:13.800]  but then the other day I got this truth-o-meter thing they wrote an article
[02:47:13.800 --> 02:47:18.640]  about me and it came out mostly true so that was good I don't know whether you
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:22.440]  saw it or not but the statesman yeah I missed it but I mean how could they lie
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:24.640]  about you buddy I know you've got a perfect record well they were
[02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:30.240]  questioning the the amount of money that's been donated by a perfect tan and
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:35.880]  sugars and they were saying well that's that's not right it's it's a lower figure
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:42.320]  and I said sorry it isn't it's it's $3,700 it's $37,000 and now there's a
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:47.800]  brand new donation of 2,500 so that takes it up to 3,95 and and why are you
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:52.160]  saying it's bad for the topless bars be donating to him well the sheriff they
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:55.160]  shouldn't be donated the sheriff shouldn't be taking money from them I
[02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:59.640]  don't care who they donate to but don't donate it to law enforcement people you
[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:05.280]  know sure because we all know some of the things that you know the you know
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:10.080]  there's there's criminal acts every day in those places where they're lewd or
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:16.640]  indecent exposure different things perfect 10 is the ranks in the top 10 of
[02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:20.840]  liquor sales in the state of in the state of Texas and the city of Austin I
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:24.240]  mean Triton County well I mean I mean my whole issue is I understand you're just
[02:48:24.240 --> 02:48:26.840]  saying your candidate takes from I don't know anything about those groups so
[02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:30.480]  that's a separate issue you know here on the air but but I understand your
[02:48:30.480 --> 02:48:35.440]  point in the paper I missed that sheriff expanding on this what would you do with
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:38.920]  the federal government because I know in the old days of the Constitution just
[02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:43.480]  30 years ago 20 years ago the FBI and others got permission to come in and now
[02:48:43.480 --> 02:48:47.480]  there's a move for sheriffs again to exert their authority and say you know
[02:48:47.480 --> 02:48:51.200]  you've got to have everything lined up properly to come into this jurisdiction
[02:48:51.200 --> 02:48:56.840]  instead of just total federalization yeah well I don't I've heard that many
[02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:02.680]  times and it would be nice if we could kick them out and and and they'd have to
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:06.640]  get permission to come in but I don't think it's ever gonna happen there's so
[02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:10.520]  many federal people in Travis County of different agencies you know Secret
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:13.240]  Service and now I know but I'm saying look we've gone from the point of where
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:17.680]  they had to do that to just a takeover now yeah it's well there you know a lot
[02:49:17.680 --> 02:49:23.320]  of police actually carry a secondary federal card now yeah we're gonna be
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:26.760]  we're gonna be the chief law enforcement agency for Travis County I can
[02:49:26.760 --> 02:49:32.880]  assure you that and even if I have to wear five stars up here instead of the
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:38.000]  four stars that the chief of police wears or you wear eight you know we'll
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:42.280]  know they were sick I'm being sarcastic I feel like a third world general I know
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:45.360]  more police chiefs look like third world generals yeah the sheriff at Los
[02:49:45.360 --> 02:49:49.760]  Angeles wears five stars here which is one star above the four which are
[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:54.240]  traditionally worn by chiefs of police yeah because I guess if a governor was
[02:49:54.240 --> 02:49:58.200]  kind of dictatorial he might wear five stars it's kind of ridiculous about that
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:02.240]  well yeah because that means you know like the LF a worse five yeah yeah like
[02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:08.160]  the chairman of the Joint Chiefs wears five that's right yeah no no four or
[02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:13.760]  yeah four stars yeah why not eight stars Dempsey Dempsey worse four he's the
[02:50:13.760 --> 02:50:17.760]  chairman of Joint Chiefs staff yeah he wears four now during the World War two
[02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:21.520]  Eisenhower had five and MacArthur I think had five but with they were round
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:25.880]  in a round set five stars oh because that symbolize it was a joint command just
[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:31.820]  about 90 stars hey how about how about said it's just given Obama and the
[02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:37.520]  warmongering EU a peace prize they could give Genghis Khan a peace price it's
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:42.760]  already such a joke the peace price yeah why don't we give Mars the god of war a
[02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:47.280]  peace price never think about that you know what you know we're fighting in
[02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:50.680]  Afghanistan there's only been one guy that's ever captured Afghanistan you
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:54.920]  knew that was Genghis Khan yeah he did that by killing everybody exactly we'll
[02:50:54.920 --> 02:50:58.760]  give him a peace prize we'll be right back with a sheriff Ray Frank here

[02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:23.520]  great sheriff of course we need to get back on the show hey maybe for the 48
[02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:28.240]  hour broadcast only a few slots left perhaps we should get sheriff here on
[02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:33.960]  the air of course and everybody knows who I'm talking about Richard Mack
[02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:38.760]  Raymond Frank calm people want to donate or get behind you have you had a
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:43.200]  chance to debate the people you're running against yet no I I haven't had a
[02:54:43.200 --> 02:54:48.000]  chance I haven't been asked to I don't think that my opponent wants to debate
[02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:55.040]  probably because of the adverse stuff that's come up and I had one out of the
[02:54:55.040 --> 02:54:59.320]  paper I haven't had that's going to be in Sunday's paper the 21st the 28th and
[02:54:59.320 --> 02:55:04.080]  the 4th of November and it's it's negative advertising I realize that
[02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:09.720]  and but the reason I'm doing that is people they need to know the background
[02:55:09.720 --> 02:55:15.520]  of our public officials and that's the only way I know to get it out like he
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:26.200]  went bankrupt in 1997 he beat his creditors out of $146,000 he was
[02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:32.800]  certified as a biological father of a 13-year-old child can you imagine that
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:37.280]  13 years went by before the mother of that child got him before the attorney
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:45.200]  general the state of Texas and had him certified biological father and and the
[02:55:45.200 --> 02:55:48.440]  birth records of that child was changed hey look at that photo who are you with

[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:07.000]  ranch in Colorado he was ready to go up there and he died kind of early yeah
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:11.640]  hey I need to get that's a briar cliff yeah used to be an old thing there and
