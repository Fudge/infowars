[00:00.000 --> 00:20.240]  It's Thursday, May 7th, 2020, 179 days out from the election.
[00:20.240 --> 00:21.240]  And I knew this was coming.
[00:21.240 --> 00:27.840]  In fact, they'd already admitted it, but now a consortium of 200 billionaires in Hollywood
[00:27.840 --> 00:32.100]  trash has come out and said, hey, we never want to go back to normal.
[00:32.100 --> 00:34.400]  This was about depopulating the earth.
[00:34.400 --> 00:36.720]  It's about ending consumerism.
[00:36.720 --> 00:38.680]  It's about ending a middle class.
[00:38.680 --> 00:42.860]  But of course, the very people pushing it are billionaires and have private jets and
[00:42.860 --> 00:45.640]  huge estates all over the planet.
[00:45.640 --> 00:48.080]  Stories on infowars.com.
[00:48.080 --> 00:51.760]  Celebrities call for world to not return to normal.
[00:51.760 --> 00:54.360]  Radical transformation of economies.
[00:54.360 --> 00:58.880]  This is not just idiot celebrities coming out, 200 of them, and signing this petition.
[00:58.880 --> 01:04.560]  This is their plan of selfishness and true evil.
[01:04.560 --> 01:05.560]  And it's all coming up.
[01:05.560 --> 01:11.080]  First, here's the beginning of a report that's at man.video where Bill Gates becomes what
[01:11.080 --> 01:12.920]  appears to be sexually excited.
[01:12.920 --> 01:20.200]  I mean, just pure joy and ecstasy on his face, and his eyes gleam like he's a red-eyed demon
[01:20.200 --> 01:26.040]  when they talk about the global collapse that they now admit is going to kill more people
[01:26.040 --> 01:28.040]  this year than World War II did.
[01:28.040 --> 01:30.880]  World War II killed over 50 million people, by the way.
[01:30.880 --> 01:33.120]  Here is part of that report.
[01:33.120 --> 01:35.280]  Economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[01:35.280 --> 01:37.640]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[01:37.640 --> 01:41.680]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful
[01:41.680 --> 01:42.680]  this is.
[01:42.680 --> 01:51.200]  Let's watch that video one more time, where Bill Gates becomes visibly joyful, excited,
[01:51.200 --> 01:56.320]  almost having an orgasm when Fareed Zarkaria, the other fellow globalist, the Bilderberg
[01:56.320 --> 02:01.680]  group, on CNN talks about how horrible the economy is and how we better get used to
[02:01.680 --> 02:02.680]  it.
[02:02.680 --> 02:05.240]  Boy, is this going to take a long time to recover?
[02:05.240 --> 02:10.520]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful
[02:10.520 --> 02:11.680]  this is.
[02:11.680 --> 02:16.800]  In the video, Gates gets more excited than Beto O'Rourke did when he learned about the
[02:16.800 --> 02:19.520]  mass shooting at the El Paso Walmart.
[02:19.520 --> 02:21.320]  Why are these guys so happy?
[02:21.320 --> 02:24.400]  Because they know it's moving their agenda forward.
[02:24.400 --> 02:27.160]  With Beto O'Rourke, it's disarming the population.
[02:27.160 --> 02:32.880]  With Bill Gates, he's on record wanting to starve the third world, wanting to depopulate
[02:32.880 --> 02:35.560]  Africa, Latin America, and Asia.
[02:35.560 --> 02:41.360]  But now we're supposed to forget all that and say, oh, he's the new dictator of the world,
[02:41.360 --> 02:47.400]  the unelected leader that controls all the major health institutes of the planet and
[02:47.400 --> 02:50.040]  the UN's World Health Organization.
[02:50.040 --> 02:51.960]  But it's not just that clip.
[02:51.960 --> 02:57.000]  In every interview he does, we have hundreds of these from the last few months.
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.600]  When he talks about forced inoculation, when he talks about we're never going to unlock
[03:00.600 --> 03:06.280]  the planet again, when he talks about depression, he gets very, very excited and very, very
[03:06.280 --> 03:07.280]  happy.
[03:07.280 --> 03:12.120]  When he's talking about President Trump or America or the free market or its success,
[03:12.120 --> 03:14.760]  he looks very, very upset.
[03:14.760 --> 03:19.800]  It's only when he talks about planetary collapse that he gets excited, because he believes
[03:19.800 --> 03:26.560]  he's saving the Earth by artificially using this panic to shut down the world economy.
[03:26.560 --> 03:31.000]  Here are a few more clips of Bill Gates the last few days with Trevor Noah, the supposed
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.720]  entertainment show, and the Financial Times of London also getting visually excited when
[03:36.720 --> 03:41.080]  he talks about financial collapse, when he talks about world government, when he talks
[03:41.080 --> 03:47.840]  about forced inoculation, and all seven billion people having to be forcibly injected before
[03:47.840 --> 03:51.020]  the world can ever, quote, go back to normal.
[03:51.020 --> 03:53.160]  It's called holding us hostage.
[03:53.160 --> 03:58.680]  The ultimate solution, the only thing that really lets us go back completely to normal
[03:58.680 --> 04:04.800]  and feel good about sitting in a stadium with lots of other people, is to create a vaccine
[04:04.800 --> 04:12.520]  and not just take care of our country, but take that vaccine out to the global population
[04:12.520 --> 04:19.680]  and so that we have vast immunity and this thing, no matter what, isn't going to spread
[04:19.680 --> 04:21.600]  in large numbers.
[04:21.600 --> 04:25.440]  What do you think the right balance is between the trade-off of protecting people's lives
[04:25.440 --> 04:26.440]  and-
[04:26.440 --> 04:30.800]  And then he goes on to say that China is the perfect model, and he goes on to say that
[04:30.800 --> 04:31.800]  you have no choice.
[04:31.800 --> 04:32.800]  You will take the forced inoculation.
[04:32.800 --> 04:36.400]  Oh, and it's coming sooner than they thought now, this year.
[04:36.400 --> 04:39.760]  Oh, how interesting we, of course, didn't predict that.
[04:39.760 --> 04:41.360]  We knew they were doing that.
[04:41.360 --> 04:44.800]  This whole thing is a psychological warfare operation.
[04:44.800 --> 04:49.320]  Publicly designed to depopulate the planet and collapse the Western world, and now 200
[04:49.320 --> 04:52.400]  celebrities have signed a petition saying just that.
[04:52.400 --> 04:56.160]  We need to depopulate people and make folks poor, but of course they're not going to give
[04:56.160 --> 04:58.840]  up their riches.
[04:58.840 --> 05:03.880]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai comms
[05:03.880 --> 05:07.600]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[05:07.600 --> 05:11.840]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third
[05:11.840 --> 05:12.840]  world.
[05:12.840 --> 05:18.000]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going
[05:18.000 --> 05:19.000]  to be.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.120]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex
[05:24.120 --> 05:25.120]  economy.
[05:25.120 --> 05:26.120]  That's what we've always said.
[05:26.120 --> 05:30.320]  It's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want
[05:30.320 --> 05:33.800]  to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[05:33.800 --> 05:36.240]  They've admitted all of this.
[05:36.240 --> 05:41.840]  So remember, how does M-Full Wars continue years and decades, in many cases, to be able
[05:41.840 --> 05:44.280]  to predict things before they happen?
[05:44.280 --> 05:49.120]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan, and yes, it's dystopic
[05:49.120 --> 05:50.560]  and yes, it's scary.
[05:50.560 --> 05:54.720]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[05:54.720 --> 06:01.720]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[06:01.720 --> 06:15.320]  179, 179 days out from the most historic election in world history.
[06:15.320 --> 06:24.480]  A referendum on open free societies and Americana, or globalist tyranny, and the long dark night.
[06:24.480 --> 06:28.240]  A planetary collapse.
[06:28.240 --> 06:31.360]  This is an incredibly historic time to be alive.
[06:31.360 --> 06:37.360]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we are launching this live, May 7th, 2020, Thursday, transmission.
[06:37.360 --> 06:46.160]  Okay, let's get right into it now.
[06:46.160 --> 06:48.120]  Let's lay it out right now.
[06:48.120 --> 06:52.880]  The stakes cannot be higher.
[06:52.880 --> 06:56.600]  If individuals know about history and know about governments and know about geopolitics,
[06:56.600 --> 07:00.120]  what's happening is crystal clear, like a clear blue sky.
[07:00.120 --> 07:04.160]  You're up on a mountain top, you can see for 100 miles.
[07:04.160 --> 07:11.960]  But if you're unaware of how the world works, it's like having your head under water in
[07:11.960 --> 07:13.720]  black ink.
[07:13.720 --> 07:17.600]  You can't see a millimeter in front of you.
[07:17.600 --> 07:24.160]  The very United Nations WHO that ran with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and
[07:24.160 --> 07:30.200]  the NIH, University of Texas, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, the weaponized
[07:30.200 --> 07:36.680]  Chimera program that was a huge scandal here five years ago in the U.S., was then illegally
[07:36.680 --> 07:47.320]  moved to China by Obama and Dr. Fauci, are now the ones telling us the lockdown could
[07:47.320 --> 07:48.320]  never end.
[07:48.320 --> 07:54.040]  Remember, 15 days to bend the curve, and then when it wasn't even one-tenth of what they
[07:54.040 --> 07:58.320]  said it would be, they went, oh, sorry, it's so devastating because it's not even one-tenth
[07:58.320 --> 08:02.000]  of what we said, we never reopen.
[08:02.000 --> 08:07.720]  They just wanted to get you to accept it up front, like a kidnapper does, puts the gun
[08:07.720 --> 08:11.400]  on you, so we put the handcuffs on you, we put the gag on you, and then everything will
[08:11.400 --> 08:12.400]  be all right.
[08:12.400 --> 08:14.760]  Just put the handcuffs on, put the ball gag in.
[08:14.760 --> 08:19.560]  Look, you're getting taken to a basement to get tortured and raped, you're gonna die.
[08:19.560 --> 08:25.760]  You don't put the ball gag in and the handcuffs, but you did it, you like it.
[08:25.760 --> 08:30.640]  You think compliance is love, compliance with tyranny is death, but here's the deal, the
[08:30.640 --> 08:36.960]  ball gag isn't completely in and the handcuffs are on, but you could, with your elbow, hit
[08:36.960 --> 08:41.520]  the latch and jump out of the car when he slows down at that little 20-mile-an-hour turn
[08:41.520 --> 08:45.400]  by that farmhouse and then you could run towards that farmhouse, even though your hands are
[08:45.400 --> 08:50.600]  tied, even if your legs are tied, you could, help me, help me, but you're not going to.
[08:50.600 --> 08:55.240]  You wanna go to the farmhouse a mile down the road and get taken to that basement.
[08:55.240 --> 09:00.760]  You want, you wanna get raped, you want Ted Bunny to bite big chunks out of you, you need
[09:00.760 --> 09:05.960]  it and don't worry, you gonna get it.
[09:05.960 --> 09:11.920]  Your compliance is death.
[09:11.920 --> 09:22.040]  And so the spokesperson's for the Rothschild Rockefeller Gates, IBM, Eugenics, Combine,
[09:22.040 --> 09:32.680]  200 filthy celebrities, Madonna, Jane Fonda, Robert DeNiro, have slithered out from under
[09:32.680 --> 09:39.160]  their rocks to say, we're never going back to normal, this is about cutting carbon.
[09:39.160 --> 09:44.640]  Well, they've had the globalist on TV saying, oh, the good part is this is stopping global
[09:44.640 --> 09:45.640]  warming.
[09:45.640 --> 09:51.400]  COVID-19 is stopping human activity, oh, it's a good thing and you're gonna learn what's
[09:51.400 --> 09:52.400]  essential.
[09:52.400 --> 09:55.520]  We're gonna tell you, we're gonna own three or four jets apiece and have five or six
[09:55.520 --> 10:01.320]  big palatial houses and estates and we're gonna have four or five kids apiece.
[10:01.320 --> 10:07.120]  We're gonna have yachts, we're gonna have helicopters, we're gonna have surrogates having
[10:07.120 --> 10:15.760]  our kids, we're gonna get organs from Chinese dissidents, but you that own a little salon
[10:15.760 --> 10:20.440]  that employs a dozen people, you're gonna go bankrupt and there's no bailout for you
[10:20.440 --> 10:24.640]  because you are a dirty consumer.
[10:24.640 --> 10:28.200]  You've got a nice dress, you've got a nice little house you work to get with a little
[10:28.200 --> 10:34.880]  pool in the back that you saved a decade to have, you go on a couple vacations a year
[10:34.880 --> 10:40.400]  and so now you're gonna go to jail and even when the Supreme Court orders her released
[10:40.400 --> 10:53.960]  in Dallas, Shelly Luther, the judge, Democrat says, I'm ignoring the Texas Supreme Court
[10:53.960 --> 10:57.680]  and I'm ignoring the governor and the attorney general, even though that's the law, they
[10:57.680 --> 11:07.360]  have to let her out, he's grandstanding and wearing his mask and saying she's a bad person.
[11:07.360 --> 11:11.480]  So let's walk through this and let's understand what this is.
[11:11.480 --> 11:17.360]  The UN's Robert Barron Rockefeller created globalist depopulation planetary government
[11:17.360 --> 11:22.960]  always designed to carry out eugenics through a global health department depopulation program.
[11:22.960 --> 11:28.080]  The health departments were started in England and the United States in 1900 by the Rockefeller
[11:28.080 --> 11:34.600]  Foundation run by Margaret Sanger to carry out racial hygiene.
[11:34.600 --> 11:38.520]  That means getting rid of the poor black people, white people, everybody.
[11:38.520 --> 11:41.680]  That's what set up health departments in the health service.
[11:41.680 --> 11:48.400]  It's not western medicine, it's a globalist program of total control.
[11:48.400 --> 11:51.960]  They got embarrassed by Hitler so they had to go underground but now they're rolling
[11:51.960 --> 11:56.760]  out their operation today.
[11:56.760 --> 12:01.240]  And Paul Watson wrote the article, pointless celebrities call for world not to return to
[12:01.240 --> 12:05.440]  normal, radical transformation of economies and he goes into how they're pathetic and
[12:05.440 --> 12:06.440]  no one listens to them.
[12:06.440 --> 12:13.040]  Well, the point is they're the spokespersons for the new world order.
[12:13.040 --> 12:17.880]  They're the spokespersons for what they're going to do and you've seen them again on
[12:17.880 --> 12:23.920]  CNN, you name it, the scientists going, oh, COVID-19 lockdown has cut the global carbon
[12:23.920 --> 12:25.520]  is helping global warming.
[12:25.520 --> 12:27.480]  Type it into a search engine.
[12:27.480 --> 12:30.880]  Lock global lockdown is helping the animals.
[12:30.880 --> 12:34.440]  Global lockdown is slowing global warming.
[12:34.440 --> 12:39.680]  Oh, the reason the ice caps didn't melt by 2017 like they said and are bigger than ever
[12:39.680 --> 12:41.920]  is because of the two month lockdown.
[12:41.920 --> 12:49.120]  They're 54 in the US but it's longer in places like Spain and here's the United Nations.
[12:49.120 --> 12:53.640]  UN calls for billions in coronavirus aid for fragile countries.
[12:53.640 --> 12:59.120]  Oh, but it's not even food they want, it's billions to pharmaceutical companies to go
[12:59.120 --> 13:03.560]  shoot them up right now and give them, quote, drugs.
[13:03.560 --> 13:10.240]  Watered down drugs that Bill Clinton and others have been caught making profits off of.
[13:10.240 --> 13:14.160]  The aid money goes to them to make money not to help the Africans.
[13:14.160 --> 13:17.040]  And this is how it's done over and over and over again.
[13:17.040 --> 13:22.080]  But here's the head of the UN food program again saying 135 million could die this year,
[13:22.080 --> 13:27.280]  30 plus million are starving to death right now, 300 plus thousand every day.
[13:27.280 --> 13:30.720]  Those are real numbers, that's happening.
[13:30.720 --> 13:34.120]  But according to Madonna, this is good.
[13:34.120 --> 13:36.240]  According to Robert De Niro, it's good.
[13:36.240 --> 13:39.840]  According to Jane Fonda, but again, these are just puppets.
[13:39.840 --> 13:42.800]  They just say what they're supposed to say.
[13:42.800 --> 13:46.680]  And 200 of them have signed this letter saying it never needs to go back.
[13:46.680 --> 13:48.960]  They love it seeing everything locked down.
[13:48.960 --> 13:50.520]  You don't get to go to the bowling alley.
[13:50.520 --> 13:52.000]  You don't get to go have that wedding.
[13:52.000 --> 13:53.920]  You don't get to go on a trip once a year.
[13:53.920 --> 13:58.240]  You don't get to go eat a steak once a month or something in a nice restaurant.
[13:58.240 --> 14:02.120]  You will die.
[14:02.120 --> 14:06.720]  Society will break down, you will starve to death and they, the rich, beautiful elitists,
[14:06.720 --> 14:10.320]  they will inherit the planet.
[14:10.320 --> 14:11.440]  This isn't science fiction.
[14:11.440 --> 14:16.360]  This is happening and they're showing footage of the collapse right now in areas of Africa
[14:16.360 --> 14:18.240]  and mass starvation.
[14:18.240 --> 14:23.360]  Let's go ahead and go to the clip of the head of the UN food program.
[14:23.360 --> 14:29.960]  There are a further 135 million people facing crisis levels of hunger or worse.
[14:29.960 --> 14:36.880]  That means 135 million people on earth are marching toward the brink of starvation.
[14:36.880 --> 14:43.080]  An additional 130 million people could be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end
[14:43.080 --> 14:44.080]  of 2020.
[14:44.080 --> 14:49.080]  That's a total of 265 million people.
[14:49.080 --> 14:55.080]  Our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three
[14:55.080 --> 14:56.920]  month period.
[14:56.920 --> 15:00.880]  But that's okay because Jane Fonda says it helps the earth.
[15:00.880 --> 15:05.120]  See, Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate using vaccines.
[15:05.120 --> 15:10.560]  Then he has a vaccine for you and his family runs these eugenics groups on record and then
[15:10.560 --> 15:13.800]  media matters comes out and says, Jones is a liar.
[15:13.800 --> 15:17.200]  Bill Gates is connected to none of that and Alex Jones wants Bill Gates dead.
[15:17.200 --> 15:19.600]  I never said that.
[15:19.600 --> 15:27.200]  I said that Chinese communist agents inside the United States need to be dealt with as
[15:27.200 --> 15:32.280]  far as spies and that needs to be done by the president and by the Pentagon.
[15:32.280 --> 15:34.040]  We're at war with China.
[15:34.040 --> 15:35.320]  I don't want anything to happen to Bill Gates.
[15:35.320 --> 15:37.160]  That would turn him into a martyr.
[15:37.160 --> 15:40.960]  I want Bill Gates publicly exposed as his agenda stopped.
[15:40.960 --> 15:41.960]  And you know what?
[15:41.960 --> 15:42.960]  It is happening.
[15:42.960 --> 15:43.960]  Praise God.
[15:43.960 --> 15:44.960]  And thank all of you for spreading the word.
[15:44.960 --> 15:48.640]  We're going to come back and get into Bill Gates and the next shoe to drop.
[15:48.640 --> 15:53.040]  And how bad is this global collapse going to get that the Democrats and the Hollywood
[15:53.040 --> 15:55.920]  trash are now celebrating?
[15:55.920 --> 16:00.440]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think even if it ends up
[16:00.440 --> 16:04.680]  hurting me short term, I believe in God and I believe in the long run, it'll end up being
[16:04.680 --> 16:07.720]  better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[16:07.720 --> 16:12.200]  I understand what comes around, goes around, you report you so and I live that and I fundamentally
[16:12.200 --> 16:14.400]  to cellular level understand it.
[16:14.400 --> 16:18.640]  Now if I would have hyped up the virus was going to kill 3, 4, 5 million people like
[16:18.640 --> 16:21.640]  the UN did, I would have sold five times more supplements.
[16:21.640 --> 16:22.640]  But you know what?
[16:22.640 --> 16:23.640]  I didn't do that.
[16:23.640 --> 16:29.120]  But I said on a routine basis, regardless, people are vitamin D deficient.
[16:29.120 --> 16:31.560]  People are deficient and iodine and so many other issues.
[16:31.560 --> 16:33.560]  You need those products regardless.
[16:33.560 --> 16:37.600]  So we started selling out of vitamin, mineral, fusion, all the other products.
[16:37.600 --> 16:44.320]  I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off because I knew it was the right thing to do that
[16:44.320 --> 16:49.040]  in a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their body's defenses.
[16:49.040 --> 16:55.560]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on, get your storeable food now.
[16:55.560 --> 17:00.320]  Feudalism in the ancient world from Asia to Europe from Africa to Latin America was the
[17:00.320 --> 17:02.560]  most common form of government.
[17:02.560 --> 17:07.440]  You had a ruling class, the nobility, the king and queen sitting on top of it and the
[17:07.440 --> 17:12.560]  rest of the public were kept at a subsistence starving level for control.
[17:12.560 --> 17:17.520]  In fact, in most cultures, they call the peasants the little people because they were usually
[17:17.520 --> 17:24.080]  a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them again at a starving
[17:24.080 --> 17:25.080]  level.
[17:25.080 --> 17:29.120]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched
[17:29.120 --> 17:30.120]  elite.
[17:30.120 --> 17:34.280]  Well, now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff
[17:34.280 --> 17:35.440]  Bezos is the world.
[17:35.440 --> 17:40.440]  They're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets
[17:40.440 --> 17:46.200]  living the life, laughing at you, shut down, going bankrupt in the third world, starving
[17:46.200 --> 17:47.200]  to death.
[17:47.200 --> 17:52.800]  Their religion is power and control and they are pressing that advantage against us.
[17:52.800 --> 17:58.480]  We must break free from these monsters.
[17:58.480 --> 18:18.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:18.320 --> 18:38.280]  He talks about communist China, he goes, they've done a perfect job and when he's talking to
[18:38.280 --> 18:41.000]  a reporter and they go, you know, this lockdown is never going to end.
[18:41.000 --> 18:46.560]  It's going to get global depressions inevitable and Gates is going, yeah, I can't even look
[18:46.560 --> 18:47.560]  as happy as he does.
[18:47.560 --> 18:57.720]  Like, I don't think I've ever made a face so just, yeah, it's so inappropriate.
[18:57.720 --> 19:00.880]  It's way beyond Beto O'Rourke.
[19:00.880 --> 19:04.800]  When he would talk about dead kids, he'd like, yeah, a whole bunch of people got killed and
[19:04.800 --> 19:06.520]  start smiling.
[19:06.520 --> 19:12.720]  It's just truly disgusting and he does it in video after video after video.
[19:12.720 --> 19:15.160]  But member Bill Maher said famously, I love abortion.
[19:15.160 --> 19:16.160]  I love death.
[19:16.160 --> 19:18.920]  I say more suicide, I say euthanize everyone.
[19:18.920 --> 19:23.200]  He said, I want the highways cleared.
[19:23.200 --> 19:26.160]  I want to be able to drive down the highway and not see anyone.
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.480]  In fact, that's in the Swimlet Green intro.
[19:29.480 --> 19:35.280]  Let's try to excise that out too for the next segment that we can.
[19:35.280 --> 19:36.280]  And now you're seeing it.
[19:36.280 --> 19:40.480]  And now it's not just me telling you they would come with a deadly virus and cause a
[19:40.480 --> 19:47.800]  supposed lockdown to kill the supply chain that will actually kill billions of people
[19:47.800 --> 19:48.960]  in the next decade.
[19:48.960 --> 19:53.920]  The UN now says 130-something million this year for sure, perhaps even 200-plus million
[19:53.920 --> 19:57.680]  will die, 300,000 a day right now dying.
[19:57.680 --> 20:01.920]  I know Africa and Latin America and Asia and the Middle East are like another planet, but
[20:01.920 --> 20:04.080]  they're over there.
[20:04.080 --> 20:07.560]  And their collapse is because we're collapsing.
[20:07.560 --> 20:13.920]  And then you get Madonna and you get people like, I can't even say her name, Jane Fonda
[20:13.920 --> 20:17.680]  and Robert De Niro.
[20:17.680 --> 20:24.520]  And they're having orgasms over this and how great this is, and how you're not essential.
[20:24.520 --> 20:29.160]  Marie Antoinette in the French Revolution when they stormed the Bastille didn't really
[20:29.160 --> 20:30.840]  say let them be kicked.
[20:30.840 --> 20:35.120]  They used that to enrage the starving mass.
[20:35.120 --> 20:37.480]  The Jacobins came out and they said, what does she say?
[20:37.480 --> 20:41.880]  We've petitioned her to open up the grain stores and they said, the queen says let them
[20:41.880 --> 20:44.640]  eat cake.
[20:44.640 --> 20:50.480]  The truth is the queen just didn't care and was out playing sports, badminton, whatever
[20:50.480 --> 20:51.480]  in the back, literally.
[20:51.480 --> 20:54.800]  You've got hundreds of thousands of people from all the countries that started it up.
[20:54.800 --> 21:01.520]  They come to town a giant raging horde wanting food and you're just hopping around at Versailles
[21:01.520 --> 21:02.520]  playing badminton.
[21:02.520 --> 21:12.800]  Oh, I don't need to hear about them and it's the same thing, Jane Fonda, Robert De Niro,
[21:12.800 --> 21:13.800]  Madonna.
[21:13.800 --> 21:19.840]  And I'm going to read you what they had to say about how glad they are you're starving,
[21:19.840 --> 21:21.480]  how you're not essential.
[21:21.480 --> 21:26.560]  You know, I did the Jonathan Swift satire a week and a half ago of a national news last
[21:26.560 --> 21:31.280]  week where I said, if things collapse, I'll eat my neighbors if I have to because things
[21:31.280 --> 21:34.240]  are going to get that bad down the road if we let this continue.
[21:34.240 --> 21:38.520]  And I went on to say, this is satire for the lawyers, everybody, put the media cut that
[21:38.520 --> 21:39.520]  out.
[21:39.520 --> 21:44.040]  It's in the same segment and said, oh, Jones is serious, but these people are really saying
[21:44.040 --> 21:49.480]  they want to collapse and kill all these people and feed off of them economically.
[21:49.480 --> 21:54.760]  And I said all that hoping it would get picked up to point this out.
[21:54.760 --> 21:58.360]  And it has now triggered a debate and people are finding out what I really meant by it.
[21:58.360 --> 22:03.240]  And so good job listeners getting the word out, but that's what satires for to illustrate
[22:03.240 --> 22:05.240]  things so absurd.
[22:05.240 --> 22:08.520]  People won't get upset about the real thing, but they'll get upset about somebody talking
[22:08.520 --> 22:09.520]  about it.
[22:09.520 --> 22:16.800]  So here's Bill Maher talking about how he hopes to implode the economy a year ago and
[22:16.800 --> 22:19.840]  well, they've done it.
[22:19.840 --> 22:21.360]  Economy is going pretty well.
[22:21.360 --> 22:22.360]  We have to, what?
[22:22.360 --> 22:23.360]  Why is that funny?
[22:23.360 --> 22:25.960]  It is going well for now.
[22:25.960 --> 22:30.160]  Right, that's my question.
[22:30.160 --> 22:32.920]  I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point.
[22:32.920 --> 22:36.960]  And by the way, I'm hoping for it because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a
[22:36.960 --> 22:38.280]  crashing economy.
[22:38.280 --> 22:40.240]  So please bring on the recession.
[22:40.240 --> 22:45.800]  Sorry if that hurts people, but it's either root for a recession or you lose your democracy.
[22:45.800 --> 22:47.480]  And they had this martial law plan.
[22:47.480 --> 22:50.480]  Oh, and you didn't get your republic, your democracy.
[22:50.480 --> 22:55.920]  No, no, notice now you get martial law, but he promised you freedom, right?
[22:55.920 --> 23:00.520]  Here's a short clip of him from a larger intro we have where he's talking about more death.
[23:00.520 --> 23:01.520]  Clear out the highway.
[23:01.520 --> 23:02.520]  Here it is.
[23:02.520 --> 23:04.000]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[23:04.000 --> 23:05.920]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[23:05.920 --> 23:07.200]  I'm for regular suicide.
[23:07.200 --> 23:09.040]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[23:09.040 --> 23:13.800]  Well, let me tell you who'll get the freeway moving for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:13.800 --> 23:14.800]  And his name is Bill Gates.
[23:14.800 --> 23:19.280]  Here he is three weeks ago saying he needs to be indemnified for all his front companies
[23:19.280 --> 23:23.800]  putting out seven vaccines because let me tell you, not everybody gets the same vaccine.
[23:23.800 --> 23:28.400]  It's a little too obvious they give it here and like third of us die and the rest gets
[23:28.400 --> 23:29.400]  sterile.
[23:29.400 --> 23:32.320]  We just get a little bit lighter one, but then the next three or four sterilize us and
[23:32.320 --> 23:33.320]  kill us in Africa.
[23:33.320 --> 23:37.360]  They get something really special on record.
[23:37.360 --> 23:40.520]  He's being sued in Africa, Latin America, Asia for doing it.
[23:40.520 --> 23:45.640]  Here he is saying 700,000 you will get sick and some will die, but it's for a greater
[23:45.640 --> 23:46.640]  good.
[23:46.640 --> 23:49.800]  So he's coming with something to force you to take something he admits can hurt you
[23:49.800 --> 23:50.800]  or kill you.
[23:50.800 --> 23:53.880]  But oh, media matter says I want to hurt him.
[23:53.880 --> 23:58.000]  Oh, no, no, I want Bill Gates to be exposed and I want to stop him.
[23:58.000 --> 23:59.240]  Here it is.
[23:59.240 --> 24:04.120]  The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge.
[24:04.120 --> 24:08.880]  You know, it turns out the flu vaccine, uh, isn't that effective and elderly people.
[24:08.880 --> 24:15.480]  We clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're most at risk
[24:15.480 --> 24:16.480]  of that.
[24:16.480 --> 24:21.880]  And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet you don't have
[24:21.880 --> 24:29.480]  side effects, you know, if we have, you know, one in 10,000 side effects, that's, you know,
[24:29.480 --> 24:35.840]  way more 700,000, uh, you know, people who will suffer from that and that actual decision
[24:35.840 --> 24:41.040]  of, okay, let's go and give this vaccine to the entire world.
[24:41.040 --> 24:45.920]  Governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification
[24:45.920 --> 24:46.920]  needed.
[24:46.920 --> 24:50.960]  The new priesthood is doctors and a lot of them are good people, but a lot of them are
[24:50.960 --> 24:51.960]  psychotics.
[24:51.960 --> 24:56.040]  And that's why you see the art type of the crazy doctor, the mad scientist.
[24:56.040 --> 24:59.680]  And if you're a radio listener, you don't see Gates's face when he talks about side
[24:59.680 --> 25:02.080]  effects of 700,000 being hurt or killed.
[25:02.080 --> 25:05.560]  He begins to get very, very excited during that.
[25:05.560 --> 25:07.360]  It's very, very sick.
[25:07.360 --> 25:11.440]  But here he is just this last weekend with Builderburg Group, Fareed Zakaria member.
[25:11.440 --> 25:12.440]  They're both members.
[25:12.440 --> 25:13.440]  They've actually attended together.
[25:13.440 --> 25:15.040]  They're best buddies.
[25:15.040 --> 25:17.080]  And Fareed's like, Hey, this, this is a big depression.
[25:17.080 --> 25:20.000]  This isn't going to get better for a long time.
[25:20.000 --> 25:25.240]  And Gates is looking like he is the most happy man on earth.
[25:25.240 --> 25:27.040]  Here it is.
[25:27.040 --> 25:33.240]  When Fareed Zakaria, the other fellow globalist, the Builderburg Group, when Fareed Zakaria,
[25:33.240 --> 25:38.600]  the other fellow globalist, the Builderburg Group, when Fareed Zakaria, the other fellow
[25:38.600 --> 25:42.160]  globalist, the Builderburg Group, and I just wanted you to get a chance to see his face
[25:42.160 --> 25:43.160]  right there.
[25:43.160 --> 25:46.680]  And there's another part we're going to play when we come back with the actual audio of
[25:46.680 --> 25:51.280]  it looped so you can hear, they're talking about things aren't going to get better.
[25:51.280 --> 25:52.400]  Things are going to get worse.
[25:52.400 --> 25:56.480]  And then you get to see him getting so incredibly excited.
[25:56.480 --> 25:59.440]  So that is, that is all coming up the next segment.
[25:59.440 --> 26:04.480]  I intend to open the phones up for the entire transmission today.
[26:04.480 --> 26:08.800]  And I'm also going to get into the Hollywood celebrities call for world to not return to
[26:08.800 --> 26:14.120]  normal ever radical transformation of economies for the earth, austerity, and that you are
[26:14.120 --> 26:15.120]  non-essential.
[26:15.120 --> 26:21.240]  Wait until you hear their declaration of total war on you, their new green deal, and
[26:21.240 --> 26:22.640]  you ain't in it.
[26:22.640 --> 26:30.900]  This is Zardaz, this is Moonraker, this is Logan's Run, this is absolute global depopulation.
[26:30.900 --> 26:32.280]  This is exterminism.
[26:32.280 --> 26:33.280]  This is mass murder.
[26:33.280 --> 26:34.280]  And you go, why?
[26:34.280 --> 26:39.360]  Well, every culture when it becomes corrupt tries to exterminate its neighbors and or
[26:39.360 --> 26:40.560]  it's poor.
[26:40.560 --> 26:44.280]  And now they're like, oh, no, we're just going to get rid of everybody's wealth, except
[26:44.280 --> 26:45.280]  for ours.
[26:45.280 --> 26:46.760]  Of course, they're useful idiots.
[26:46.760 --> 26:52.200]  You don't think in the final equation Madonna and De Niro and Fonda will get any part of
[26:52.200 --> 26:53.200]  this, do you?
[26:53.200 --> 26:56.080]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[26:56.080 --> 27:02.720]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended and
[27:02.720 --> 27:09.440]  a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in full
[27:09.440 --> 27:10.940]  control.
[27:10.940 --> 27:16.640]  Many will submit through fear, others will be bought off, but in the end, the globalists
[27:16.640 --> 27:20.080]  admit they're building a post-human world.
[27:20.080 --> 27:27.160]  And now that we're inside the cage, it's going to move very, very quickly into its end game.
[27:27.160 --> 27:33.000]  Coming to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own
[27:33.000 --> 27:39.320]  generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing
[27:39.320 --> 27:40.320]  this.
[27:40.320 --> 27:45.000]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being poured inside out.
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.360]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfless
[27:50.360 --> 27:58.960]  disgusting power trip, allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[27:58.960 --> 28:03.160]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[28:03.160 --> 28:07.600]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.

[28:13.000 --> 28:16.000]  the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[28:52.240 --> 28:54.800]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[28:54.800 --> 28:55.800]  They're amazing.
[28:55.800 --> 28:56.800]  They're cutting edge.
[28:56.800 --> 28:57.800]  You love them.
[28:57.800 --> 28:58.800]  I love them.
[28:58.800 --> 29:00.840]  And they find the InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[29:00.840 --> 29:07.440]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[29:07.440 --> 29:15.200]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[29:15.200 --> 29:19.480]  And there's another innovation, it's the spray cap.
[29:19.480 --> 29:25.720]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes
[29:25.720 --> 29:27.040]  it in a really great way.
[29:27.040 --> 29:30.280]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[29:30.280 --> 29:35.160]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes, but I just love it personally
[29:35.160 --> 29:37.400]  as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[29:37.400 --> 29:38.400]  This is a show.
[29:38.400 --> 29:39.400]  This is a real innovation.
[29:39.400 --> 29:43.320]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has
[29:43.320 --> 29:47.200]  essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[29:47.200 --> 29:49.080]  It's so refreshing.
[29:49.080 --> 29:56.080]  This is a big winner.
[29:56.080 --> 30:14.080]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:14.080 --> 30:19.040]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[30:19.040 --> 30:20.760]  You want to stop tyranny?
[30:20.760 --> 30:22.280]  Well so does he.
[30:22.280 --> 30:30.040]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[30:30.040 --> 30:34.360]  I know why the general public thinks I'm crazy.
[30:34.360 --> 30:40.000]  It's because I actually study the ruling class and they're crazy.
[30:40.000 --> 30:47.640]  And if somebody was firing a laser beam at you and you had a mirror and you held up the
[30:47.640 --> 30:50.600]  mirror, it would hit that and it would bounce.
[30:50.600 --> 30:54.800]  But someone looking off at a distance wouldn't see the laser beam coming at the mirror.
[30:54.800 --> 30:58.040]  They would see the laser beam hitting the mirror and going at them and they would think
[30:58.040 --> 31:02.960]  the mirror was firing the laser beam at them and not the laser projector.
[31:02.960 --> 31:04.240]  That's the analogy.
[31:04.240 --> 31:09.440]  I'm here telling you these are homicidal, psychotic, decadent, evil people that have
[31:09.440 --> 31:14.960]  organized themselves into power and who are setting up an authoritarian system to dominate
[31:14.960 --> 31:16.600]  and control your family.
[31:16.600 --> 31:21.080]  And if you've grown up in America with relative freedom or Europe or a few other areas like
[31:21.080 --> 31:27.640]  modern Japan, you don't think that's possible because you've seen checks and balances.
[31:27.640 --> 31:29.200]  Well you're like a dodo bird.
[31:29.200 --> 31:32.280]  Everybody knows the story of the dodo birds on Galapagos Island.
[31:32.280 --> 31:33.480]  They were only around a few years.
[31:33.480 --> 31:40.640]  There were big, giant, juicy birds, tons of meat on them.
[31:40.640 --> 31:49.360]  And they would simply pull up in the ships and they would run up and beat them over the
[31:49.360 --> 31:55.320]  head with oars and eat them for dinner because the dodo birds had never seen a human and
[31:55.320 --> 31:58.920]  had no predators.
[31:58.920 --> 32:06.320]  So they had no instinct to learn to run.
[32:06.320 --> 32:11.960]  See because you don't just learn an instinct, when your ancestors had an experience it imprints
[32:11.960 --> 32:15.400]  on the cells, epigenetics, that's not been proven.
[32:15.400 --> 32:18.480]  And the globalists are obsessed with trying to brainwash us and program us, but it doesn't
[32:18.480 --> 32:24.880]  work because the epigenetics, we know what's bad.
[32:24.880 --> 32:29.880]  But still, in America and other countries that have been quasi-free, we don't recognize
[32:29.880 --> 32:37.240]  classical hardcore tyranny when it hits us.
[32:37.240 --> 32:41.400]  And that's what's going on right now.
[32:41.400 --> 32:45.560]  But if you look at every other culture and every other system, they always end up getting
[32:45.560 --> 32:47.360]  taken over by authoritarians.
[32:47.360 --> 32:55.160]  They always end up getting taken over by corrupt psychopaths who then get replaced by more
[32:55.160 --> 33:00.080]  out-of-control psychopaths and more oppressive people like you've seen in North Korea.
[33:00.080 --> 33:07.200]  The dictators don't get nicer, they get worse.
[33:07.200 --> 33:11.200]  And so yes, it sounds extremely insane.
[33:11.200 --> 33:16.960]  It sounds extremely scary to sit up here and say all of this was coming.
[33:16.960 --> 33:18.680]  So I know why people couldn't believe it.
[33:18.680 --> 33:23.400]  Well, now that it's here, folks are really upset and you should be upset.
[33:23.400 --> 33:27.760]  I'm very, very, very upset.
[33:27.760 --> 33:36.720]  And I'm trying to govern myself and be measured in what I say and I do because the establishment
[33:36.720 --> 33:40.840]  is trying to elicit a violent backlash.
[33:40.840 --> 33:49.880]  Instead we need a focused, loud, but also very aggressive and very determined legal,
[33:49.880 --> 33:56.080]  procedural, economic, spiritual assault against them and just expose them politically and
[33:56.080 --> 34:03.520]  culturally and get in their faces everywhere and just denounce this hoax on every front.
[34:03.520 --> 34:15.640]  So here's a couple of clips repeated of Bill Gates on CNN getting very, very excited when
[34:15.640 --> 34:20.680]  Fried Zakaria says this shutdown basically is never going to end and then we got a Bill
[34:20.680 --> 34:21.680]  Maher again.
[34:21.680 --> 34:22.680]  Here it is.
[34:22.680 --> 34:25.400]  The economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[34:25.400 --> 34:27.680]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[34:27.680 --> 34:31.720]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful
[34:31.720 --> 34:32.720]  this is.
[34:32.720 --> 34:35.320]  Let's watch that video one more time.
[34:35.320 --> 34:39.440]  Where it's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and
[34:39.440 --> 34:41.640]  how fitful this is.
[34:41.640 --> 34:46.800]  Where it's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how
[34:46.800 --> 34:47.800]  fitful this is.
[34:47.800 --> 34:53.040]  Where it's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how
[34:53.040 --> 34:54.600]  fitful this is.
[34:54.600 --> 34:56.640]  This economy is going pretty well.
[34:56.640 --> 34:57.640]  We have to, what?
[34:57.640 --> 34:58.640]  Why is that funny?
[34:58.640 --> 35:01.200]  It is going well for now.
[35:01.200 --> 35:02.200]  For now, right.
[35:02.200 --> 35:03.200]  That's my question.
[35:03.200 --> 35:04.200]  Thank you.
[35:04.200 --> 35:05.200]  That's my question.
[35:05.200 --> 35:09.360]  I feel like the bottom has to fall out at some point and by the way, I'm hoping for
[35:09.360 --> 35:14.240]  it because I think one way you get rid of Trump is a crashing economy, so please bring
[35:14.240 --> 35:15.240]  on the recession.
[35:15.240 --> 35:20.440]  Sorry if that hurts people, but it's either root for a recession or you lose your democracy.
[35:20.440 --> 35:22.360]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[35:22.360 --> 35:23.680]  I'm for regular suicide.
[35:23.680 --> 35:27.840]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[35:27.840 --> 35:35.480]  So everyone has to come to grips with, we're up against a group of people who've currently
[35:35.480 --> 35:41.440]  engaged in a global economic shutdown that will collapse the first world, put everybody
[35:41.440 --> 35:46.720]  into massive debt with the globalist, transfer trillions and bailout money to themselves,
[35:46.720 --> 35:52.520]  arrest people that have restaurants, bars, and salons because you're not essential, and
[35:52.520 --> 35:57.840]  starve the third world to death at numbers currently the UN says, and I believe those
[35:57.840 --> 36:02.920]  numbers I've seen the actual numbers that are public, at about double what died in
[36:02.920 --> 36:07.600]  World War II.
[36:07.600 --> 36:12.400]  And then you see the virtue signaling left us wearing their mask, getting into the quarantines,
[36:12.400 --> 36:15.920]  getting into the lockdowns.
[36:15.920 --> 36:17.560]  They have no idea what they're even part of.
[36:17.560 --> 36:19.000]  We've got to educate them.
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.800]  Here's a article from Mises Economic Institute.
[36:24.800 --> 36:29.280]  When governments switch their story from flatten the curve, it was just a couple of weeks to
[36:29.280 --> 36:33.760]  make sure the hospitals had room to lock down until vaccine.
[36:33.760 --> 36:40.440]  And the article that tells it, again, just put the handcuffs on, put the gag on, submit
[36:40.440 --> 36:41.440]  and I won't hurt you.
[36:41.440 --> 36:42.440]  Just get in the van.
[36:42.440 --> 36:45.400]  That was women all the time in the parking lot.
[36:45.400 --> 36:48.480]  God walks over, puts the gun on their side, just get in the car.
[36:48.480 --> 36:49.480]  Just get in the van.
[36:49.480 --> 36:54.200]  Anyway, listen, I'm going to blow you away if you don't do what I say.
[36:54.200 --> 36:57.960]  And a lot of times women go and run and don't care, and the guys hardly ever shoot them
[36:57.960 --> 36:59.640]  because they want to get another target.
[36:59.640 --> 37:04.320]  The women that go and hit them and run, they're OK 99% of the time.
[37:04.320 --> 37:07.840]  But criminology shows about a third of the women or more.
[37:07.840 --> 37:08.840]  OK, OK.
[37:08.840 --> 37:09.840]  He goes, good.
[37:09.840 --> 37:10.840]  Just get in the car.
[37:10.840 --> 37:11.840]  Just put this on.
[37:11.840 --> 37:12.840]  Just put this on.
[37:12.840 --> 37:13.840]  They handcuffs.
[37:13.840 --> 37:14.840]  OK.
[37:14.840 --> 37:17.040]  Let me tell you like, I'm going to kill you bitch now.
[37:17.040 --> 37:18.040]  You're a dead bitch.
[37:18.040 --> 37:19.040]  You're a dead bitch.
[37:19.040 --> 37:20.040]  I'm going to talk.
[37:20.040 --> 37:23.120]  And he drives you to the torture dungeon.
[37:23.120 --> 37:27.920]  And right now, Fauci and Gates, they've got us getting in the van.
[37:27.920 --> 37:35.320]  And you can see the wild-looking Gates' eye and Fauci, they're like, because they are
[37:35.320 --> 37:38.840]  already getting to wipe out 100 million people.
[37:38.840 --> 37:41.160]  And that gets them hard.
[37:41.160 --> 37:52.000]  Seriously, and Bill Gates is creaming himself right now, so they know what they're doing.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.200]  You want to get hurt?
[37:53.200 --> 37:58.200]  You're going to get hurt real bad.
[37:58.200 --> 38:00.200]  It's all here.
[38:00.200 --> 38:03.800]  Everything you've ever wanted, all of you that love abortion, all of you that love
[38:03.800 --> 38:08.400]  death, all the weird trendies that are into killing their babies and pissing in their
[38:08.400 --> 38:09.400]  pants.
[38:09.400 --> 38:10.400]  That's a big trendy thing right now.
[38:10.400 --> 38:14.000]  And all this stuff, don't worry, it's all gone.
[38:14.000 --> 38:15.160]  It's all going to be over.
[38:15.160 --> 38:19.200]  Your welfare, your free goodies, all of it.
[38:19.200 --> 38:21.400]  But not before you're first sterilized.
[38:21.400 --> 38:24.480]  They're going to make you to get your welfare and everything, get your vaccines, get your
[38:24.480 --> 38:27.240]  sterilization, and then it's all gone.
[38:27.240 --> 38:29.400]  It's all over, all of its ending.
[38:29.400 --> 38:33.720]  So all of you that bet on the system, all of you that have gone along with this, I'm
[38:33.720 --> 38:38.720]  talking to everybody in the system, from corporate people to government people to private citizens.
[38:38.720 --> 38:40.400]  They're telling you that you're obsolete.
[38:40.400 --> 38:49.240]  They're telling you that you are non-essential, and you're accepting it at your own total destruction.
[38:49.240 --> 38:53.480]  And Trump is trying to say, turn it back on, Trump is trying to say, we're tough, we can
[38:53.480 --> 39:00.560]  do it, and it's probably already too late unless the whole hoax is exposed and the people
[39:00.560 --> 39:03.240]  perpetrating it are arrested.
[39:03.240 --> 39:08.400]  But instead, if you're a radio listener and you missed it, Bill Gates, there's a whole
[39:08.400 --> 39:09.400]  bunch of these videos.
[39:09.400 --> 39:13.960]  We're getting a compilation together of when they talk about something horrible, mass
[39:13.960 --> 39:21.840]  death, collapse, force inoculations, side effects, he is gleeful and gets really predatory
[39:21.840 --> 39:27.000]  looks on his face, like smiling, but while he's like kind of murderous looking his eye.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.760]  And I told you, that's the real look of these people.
[39:28.760 --> 39:33.960]  I've told you for years behind the scenes, that's nothing, that's Gates turning on 10%
[39:33.960 --> 39:34.960]  of the demon.
[39:34.960 --> 39:39.640]  Man, boy, I know the making model of that one.
[39:39.640 --> 39:42.600]  That's a really nasty, nasty one right there.
[39:42.600 --> 39:46.200]  He would want to actually see what he looks like, that guy can look like Fright Night
[39:46.200 --> 39:47.200]  when he smiles.
[39:47.200 --> 39:52.880]  That guy can pop it on and boy, he's got the yellow eyes, the whole nine yards.
[39:52.880 --> 39:58.800]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[39:58.800 --> 40:04.400]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality
[40:04.400 --> 40:08.360]  Info Wars store, Patriot Blend coffee.

[40:23.000 --> 40:24.000]  mild acidity.
[40:24.000 --> 40:30.600]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars, so if you love coffee

[40:51.840 --> 40:56.560]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying our economy slowing down and shutting
[40:56.560 --> 41:01.560]  down is like shooting a deer and it runs 100 yards before it knows it's been shot and then
[41:01.560 --> 41:02.560]  it finally dies.
[41:02.560 --> 41:07.160]  She said, well, yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in
[41:07.160 --> 41:11.760]  the street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the
[41:11.760 --> 41:16.840]  head had blood pouring out, a huge hole and he was holding it and he walked around gibbering
[41:16.840 --> 41:20.760]  talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead.
[41:20.760 --> 41:23.760]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[41:23.760 --> 41:29.400]  It is in cardiac arrest, this has been done by design and the UN, the Chi Coms, the mainstream
[41:29.400 --> 41:34.000]  media orchestrated it, hyped it and tried to keep the economy closed.
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.600]  So remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the
[41:38.600 --> 41:44.800]  UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[41:44.800 --> 41:45.800]  We tried to stop it.
[41:45.800 --> 41:46.800]  We tried to fight it.
[41:46.800 --> 41:54.080]  But you guys said you wanted to wreck America and the world and now you've done it, congratulations.
[41:54.080 --> 42:03.600]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[42:03.600 --> 42:11.360]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, super male vitality, specifically
[42:11.360 --> 42:18.400]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[42:18.400 --> 42:19.400]  in males.
[42:19.400 --> 42:25.400]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains
[42:25.400 --> 42:30.160]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[42:30.160 --> 42:31.160]  Yes.
[42:31.160 --> 42:37.640]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[42:37.640 --> 42:42.640]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[42:42.640 --> 42:44.200]  So what are you waiting for?
[42:44.200 --> 42:46.240]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[42:46.240 --> 42:49.120]  Never been a better time than right now.
[42:49.120 --> 42:57.640]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world
[42:57.640 --> 43:00.240]  economy to where it is.
[43:00.240 --> 43:06.000]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months,
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.720]  it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible nightmarish collapse
[43:10.720 --> 43:15.000]  for the first world and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the
[43:15.000 --> 43:19.320]  mega banks that are not going to have medical ID cards or synoculations.
[43:19.320 --> 43:26.160]  We are now in a giant dystopia, but a lot of people are waking up and there is a major
[43:26.160 --> 43:32.600]  backlash taking place against this tyranny and we must all rediscover our bill of rights,
[43:32.600 --> 43:37.440]  rediscover our constitution and our backbone and start saying no to people who take this
[43:37.440 --> 43:42.200]  moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it will save lives.
[43:42.200 --> 43:47.320]  It's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more, so the cowards
[43:47.320 --> 43:50.840]  who went along with this with your virtues signaling you have destroyed your lives and
[43:50.840 --> 43:51.840]  our lives.
[43:51.840 --> 43:52.840]  Congratulations.
[43:52.840 --> 44:20.480]  You walk into this room at your own risk because it leads to the future, not a future
[44:20.480 --> 44:23.520]  that will be but one that might be.
[44:23.520 --> 44:30.600]  This is not a new world, it is simply an extension of what began in the old one, it has patterned
[44:30.600 --> 44:35.360]  itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages
[44:35.360 --> 44:41.600]  of history since the beginning of time, it has refinements, technological advances and
[44:41.600 --> 44:47.540]  a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom, but like every one of the
[44:47.540 --> 44:54.000]  super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule, logic is an enemy and truth is
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.680]  of menace.
[44:59.680 --> 45:05.840]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth, in his last 48 hours on earth, he's a citizen of the
[45:05.840 --> 45:11.760]  state but will soon have to be eliminated because he's built out of flesh and because
[45:11.760 --> 45:17.760]  he has a mind.
[45:17.760 --> 45:21.760]  You've been under investigation Mr. Wordsworth for the mandatory period of one year and 11
[45:21.760 --> 45:25.360]  months, you're found to be obsolete, the purpose of this hearing is to make a finding in a
[45:25.360 --> 45:31.360]  matter and make a sentence accordingly, do you understand that Mr. Wordsworth?
[45:31.360 --> 45:55.760]  How could they have an episode back in 1961 called The Obsolete Man written by Rod Serling
[45:55.760 --> 46:00.200]  and then you look at it today and they're actually setting it up, they're gonna kill
[46:00.200 --> 46:08.880]  over 100 million people this year, they admit 300,000 a day, it's already begun, we've got
[46:08.880 --> 46:13.160]  all the news reports, the videos, just a little footnote and we've got Hollywood folks telling
[46:13.160 --> 46:18.600]  us it's good, we need to depopulate, it's good for the earth.
[46:18.600 --> 46:23.720]  Rod Serling was in the airborne in World War II and he was there in the occupation of Germany
[46:23.720 --> 46:31.400]  and he was there for the Nuremberg trials and that'll get your head screwed on straight,
[46:31.400 --> 46:32.480]  won't it?
[46:32.480 --> 46:39.000]  So when he came back and became a screenwriter, he put it into the Twilight Zone episodes
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.920]  and so if you look at something based on what the Nazis were doing and based on what the
[46:42.920 --> 46:46.600]  Soviets were doing and you look at it today and you go, how did he envision that?
[46:46.600 --> 46:57.120]  He didn't envision that, he saw that.
[46:57.120 --> 47:08.920]  It's not a world that is, but it's a world that could be and that's where we are now
[47:08.920 --> 47:12.360]  ladies and gentlemen and you better recognize it because Hebel doesn't look like Stalin
[47:12.360 --> 47:23.760]  or Hitler today, it looks like Bill Gates and another Nazi collaborator, George Soros
[47:23.760 --> 47:31.120]  in his media matters, coming out and saying I need to be arrested because I came out and
[47:31.120 --> 47:36.760]  said Bill Gates is a eugenicist and a depopulationist and I could sit there and play you all those
[47:36.760 --> 47:37.760]  clips.
[47:37.760 --> 47:41.320]  In fact, I decided last night to make a short say 20 minute documentary, I'm not going to
[47:41.320 --> 47:47.000]  wait, I'm going to shoot it the next couple of days, edit it this weekend and we'll put
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  it out say next Wednesday.
[47:49.000 --> 47:56.960]  I haven't figured out the name yet and it's just going to be Bill Gates and his own words.
[47:56.960 --> 48:02.280]  How there's too many people, how he wants to depopulate the third world, who his mom
[48:02.280 --> 48:06.240]  is, who his dad was, the IBM funding, I'm just going to show it to you.
[48:06.240 --> 48:12.160]  We've shown it all here in pieces and pieces there but I don't just get up here and say
[48:12.160 --> 48:22.320]  all this, I do a lot of research.
[48:22.320 --> 48:32.280]  So here we are and they told us two weeks, 15 days to flatten the curve, Fauci just said
[48:32.280 --> 48:36.480]  just that, that's all we need but they had a whole plan already been rolled out in Europe
[48:36.480 --> 48:40.920]  and other areas, we knew it was never going to end until you have forced inoculations
[48:40.920 --> 48:46.000]  and ID badges that show you've been inoculated and they're going to have the corporations
[48:46.000 --> 48:52.480]  in force it along with the blue states and blue cities and they don't care how many bad
[48:52.480 --> 48:56.000]  reactions there are, they don't care if it doesn't protect you, they don't care, they're
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.080]  moving forward.
[48:59.080 --> 49:04.120]  Just like this judge in Dallas doesn't care if the governor said release the woman on
[49:04.120 --> 49:06.600]  the salon, doesn't matter if the attorney general says, doesn't matter if the Supreme
[49:06.600 --> 49:15.600]  Court told him, he's an activist judge and he's in rebellion against the Constitution
[49:15.600 --> 49:21.560]  and against the Bill of Rights because he's a virtue signaler.
[49:21.560 --> 49:27.160]  Doesn't matter if COVID-19 isn't even as powerful as the flu, it doesn't matter if they add
[49:27.160 --> 49:31.560]  all these other deaths on the list, it doesn't matter because the media told this judge,
[49:31.560 --> 49:41.240]  he's special if he acts like a Nazi thug, he's a follower, you got a bunch of followers
[49:41.240 --> 49:47.920]  following the Pied Piper of the New World Order and this New World Order created the
[49:47.920 --> 50:00.160]  Communist, it created the Nazis. You know Cold Springs Harbor, the Bill Gates' father's
[50:00.160 --> 50:11.880]  family worked in and around, still operating today in New York, created all this. It's
[50:11.880 --> 50:20.360]  not America, it's a criminal network that's international. Look at that headline right
[50:20.360 --> 50:22.960]  there.
[50:22.960 --> 50:28.720]  Governor Abbott yesterday afternoon said release her, he could release a murder. He banned
[50:28.720 --> 50:36.040]  jailing citizens for lock down violations. They're not stopping and the judge told the
[50:36.040 --> 50:48.960]  governor piss up a rope because this is the globalist revolution and it's on and they're
[50:48.960 --> 50:54.320]  not following laws or anything, they're coming to stuff out industry and to tell a woman
[50:54.320 --> 51:03.440]  your salon's not essential. But Walmart is and once you accept that you're done, I want
[51:03.440 --> 51:08.560]  to take your calls, there's also a banned documentary and I like to air things that
[51:08.560 --> 51:16.680]  are banned and it's very powerful. Doctors in black, Owen played part of it yesterday,
[51:16.680 --> 51:23.240]  I want to play part of it today, we're going to post it by banned.video as well, a woman
[51:23.240 --> 51:29.040]  that worked very closely, it was award winning with Fauci and she's exposing his criminal
[51:29.040 --> 51:34.360]  activities and for that, they tried to destroy her and put her in prison, that's who these
[51:34.360 --> 51:40.600]  people are, they're the top of the food chain. But we have to stand up against them because
[51:40.600 --> 51:46.800]  there's no future if we don't rally together. There's only destruction, impoverishment,
[51:46.800 --> 51:53.520]  enslavement, humiliation, unless we finally find our courage and say no, I'm going to
[51:53.520 --> 51:59.280]  go to break and start the next hour and get into so much news, we haven't even hit yet
[51:59.280 --> 52:04.400]  and read the sickening quotes by the 200 Hollywood globalist trash about how wonderful this
[52:04.400 --> 52:08.680]  is to save the earth and shut down the economy and how it's for the environment. Now the
[52:08.680 --> 52:13.360]  shutdown will never end, just get in this jail cell, get in this cage for two weeks
[52:13.360 --> 52:16.880]  and I'll let you out and then now they're like, you're like, hey, the thing was much
[52:16.880 --> 52:26.880]  less than what you even said it was, you're not getting out, see this key? And they're
[52:26.880 --> 52:31.600]  not just people that want to be the bosses, they're globalists, they want to impoverish
[52:31.600 --> 52:37.040]  you and make you a slave and then give you injections so you slowly get sick and waddle
[52:37.040 --> 52:43.840]  off and die. And then whatever money you got left as you're dying, they suck, suck, suck,
[52:43.840 --> 52:48.760]  suck out of you. We're going to go to break, only reason we're still on air is because
[52:48.760 --> 52:53.480]  of your massive support and it's been massive and I salute you, but we've got the things
[52:53.480 --> 52:59.320]  you need, ladies and gentlemen. We've got the products, we've got X2 that's so incredible,
[52:59.320 --> 53:05.320]  the building block of everything. X2 is so powerful, infowarstore.com, it is essential,
[53:05.320 --> 53:10.200]  good clean iodine in the body, it's back in stock 50% off, real red pill, red pill plus
[53:10.200 --> 53:14.200]  with all the vitamins, minerals, pregnant, zinc, you name it, it's very close to selling
[53:14.200 --> 53:20.600]  out, we're keeping that 50% off. We have other amazing products like bodies, ultimate turmeric
[53:20.600 --> 53:28.280]  formula, it's about to sell out, it's still discounted. We also have the krill oil that's
[53:28.280 --> 53:32.680]  been sold out for months and months. I did a double order of that because it's so popular.
[53:32.680 --> 53:39.200]  You talk about vitamin D3, ladies and gentlemen, where is my krill oil? Where is my krill oil?
[53:39.200 --> 53:45.440]  Here it is. These little babies right here are the real deal. This is the very best krill
[53:45.440 --> 53:51.520]  we can find anywhere and this is just so good for your skin, so good for your brain, so
[53:51.520 --> 53:59.720]  good for your heart, so good for your body and the globalist can kiss my ass because
[53:59.720 --> 54:07.640]  I'm energized and I'm not in some new world order fog. But let me tell you something about
[54:07.640 --> 54:13.360]  these. Even when you put them in your mouth, they taste super fishy because the ones that
[54:13.360 --> 54:18.320]  don't taste fishy have been boiled or are just the parts of krill and you don't get
[54:18.320 --> 54:22.880]  one one hundredth of the benefit. This is super high grade because it's nothing but
[54:22.880 --> 54:30.480]  the concentrated unpasteurized, unheated juice of these little babies and it is fuel
[54:30.480 --> 54:35.920]  to the stars in my view. Get your krill oil at m4store.com today and experience it and
[54:35.920 --> 54:42.160]  fund the pro-human revolution.
[54:42.160 --> 54:48.680]  Infowars has become a symbol, an emblem of not just American freedom, but worldwide Maverick
[54:48.680 --> 54:54.600]  spirit. It's not just myself or the host at Infowars or the researchers or the journalists.
[54:54.600 --> 54:59.480]  It's you, the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines in the arena and
[54:59.480 --> 55:05.040]  it's the amazing guests and individuals that we interviewed that make Infowars so special
[55:05.040 --> 55:10.040]  because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds. We're having an open discussion
[55:10.040 --> 55:14.040]  about the real state of the world, not the establishment and talking points that are
[55:14.040 --> 55:18.360]  put out by the Council on Fine Relations, the Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group and
[55:18.360 --> 55:24.640]  other clubs. We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond
[55:24.640 --> 55:31.040]  based on humans, for humans, by humans. Not a world where the establishment hate themselves,
[55:31.040 --> 55:35.240]  project their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post-human world. I'm really
[55:35.240 --> 55:40.360]  excited to know that Infowars has your support and I want to thank you all for being pro-human
[55:40.360 --> 55:44.680]  and pro-god.

[56:46.640 --> 57:12.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:12.640 --> 57:21.040]  What does Jim Morrison say in that song, Riders on the Storm? He says, if you give this man
[57:21.040 --> 57:33.840]  a ride, we're all going to die. And boy, have we given him a ride, but he hadn't got us
[57:33.840 --> 57:43.320]  right quite where he wants us yet. And if you're in denial, and if you don't fight back
[57:43.320 --> 57:53.760]  now, they're going to get us on. But you know, maybe we belong getting our brains sucked
[57:53.760 --> 58:02.320]  out like those little babies that Governor Northam keeps comfortable. So maybe that's
[58:02.320 --> 58:07.880]  what we deserve, huh? You know, I used to always be growing up and hear about the New
[58:07.880 --> 58:11.440]  World Order and the Mark of the Beast and the One World Government. And then as I studied
[58:11.440 --> 58:15.480]  politics, I saw more and more of that actually going on. I was always like, I will stand
[58:15.480 --> 58:19.280]  against Satan. I'll be willing to have my head cut off and I'll take the Mark of the
[58:19.280 --> 58:26.320]  Beast. And then you grow up and you get married, you have children, you don't really think
[58:26.320 --> 58:31.080]  about it for a while. Then all of a sudden one day you're like, I'm willing to do whatever
[58:31.080 --> 58:38.520]  it takes, not back down. And you go, oh my gosh, I've got children. What are they going
[58:38.520 --> 58:44.880]  to do to them? And now, you know, while no one in the EU has children, the EU leadership
[58:44.880 --> 58:49.120]  and why the globalists don't have children, because they're willing to do it for themselves.
[58:49.120 --> 58:53.640]  But even the most evil of these people are super selfish and don't want to take care
[58:53.640 --> 59:03.840]  of children, but really it's because they're scared. But what will I do to fight this system
[59:03.840 --> 59:09.400]  so my children aren't destroyed by it? Or there comes a point where they're going to
[59:09.400 --> 59:18.280]  be devoured by the system, but they do the right thing and keep their soul. That's my
[59:18.280 --> 59:24.160]  greatest wish is to be with my children and eternity, that our spirits, our energy might
[59:24.160 --> 59:27.760]  mirror each other and so that we resonate together because that's really what this is
[59:27.760 --> 59:37.000]  and that we go to the higher plane with God. I like the flesh and I like being alive, but
[59:37.000 --> 59:45.840]  I tell you, I'm certainly not going to cry when my mission is complete. And there is
[59:45.840 --> 59:53.280]  a God, there is a spirit world, it's all real. You can take heart in that because if you
[59:53.280 --> 59:58.360]  resonate with the truth and if you want justice and if you want freedom, then you care about
[59:58.360 --> 1:00:03.960]  other people and it upsets you to see what's happening. But if you don't resonate with
[1:00:03.960 --> 1:00:12.360]  God, you slowly degenerate like Gollum from Lord of the Rings until you are unrecognizable
[1:00:12.360 --> 1:00:24.560]  from what you previously were. And I don't want to be one of those people. I've experienced
[1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:32.360]  evil energy. I understand why these people get into it, but it's like a drug. You need
[1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:41.080]  more of it each time and it makes you weaker, not stronger overall. When you watch Bill
[1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:45.720]  Gates, he looks like he's in hell. When we're talking about prosperity and a prominent
[1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:49.480]  future, but boy, when he's talking about collapse, when he's talking about mass death, when he's
[1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:55.160]  talking about how it never is going to get better, he looks like he is happier than a
[1:00:55.160 --> 1:01:03.040]  possum eaten pumpkin pie. We can make jokes about him in the dark crystal and stuff, but
[1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:09.800]  who he really is is so fantastically devoid of God and so removed from the life force
[1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:15.960]  and energy that we should all just get on our knees before our Creator and thank the
[1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:23.680]  Creator every millisecond that we, however in the God's plan, did not end up being part
[1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:35.520]  of these people. But believe me, we don't need to think about violence against them or do
[1:01:35.520 --> 1:01:39.880]  anything like that because God, God's going to do that. God's going to do something really
[1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:46.560]  special to these people, really, really special. It is in store for them, so let God take
[1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:51.160]  care of that.
[1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:57.640]  BioPQQ. Research that. Look into it for yourself. Big brother and the globalist don't want
[1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:03.960]  you to. CoQ10. Oh, you probably want to spend some time researching CoQ10. And then research
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:10.800]  DNA Force Plus and the types that we have in here. The very best forms of the BQQ and
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:18.440]  CoQ10. And then a whole bunch of other natural ingredients from Mother Nature that are known
[1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:25.440]  to supercharge it all. This is our best selling overall formula. And I've told listeners at
[1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:30.640]  the end of last year that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough
[1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:35.640]  markup in them to fund our operations. But because of what's happening and going on in
[1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:42.320]  the world right now, I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits
[1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:48.400]  of DNA Force Plus to have DNA Force Plus for yourself and your family. DNA Force Plus now
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:03:09.640]  50% off.
[1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:17.960]  The globalists strike back May 7th, 2020. We are live broadcasting worldwide. I like
[1:03:17.960 --> 1:03:28.120]  to break things down. I like to expose these people. But this 30 minute documentary film
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:35.880]  is so important that I really think we should play a lot of it right now. It's posted at
[1:03:35.880 --> 1:03:40.880]  band.video. It's been banned on YouTube. It's been banned all over the place. YouTube
[1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:45.920]  censored doctors in black forward slash plan Demik. I'm going to get this lady on. She
[1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:52.480]  is who she says she is. And this platform, more than just being about the listeners or
[1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:59.440]  myself, the other great guest, is also about people that have been massively persecuted
[1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:03.480]  for telling the truth. So I'm going to play some of this, this segment next. And then
[1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:07.880]  I'm going to get into something that I woke up early this morning at like 6am and read
[1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:12.040]  this Paul Joseph Watson article and it like punched me in the stomach because I already
[1:04:12.040 --> 1:04:17.720]  knew all this, but to read them doing it publicly. Oh, the COVID, it's wonderful. It's going
[1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:23.800]  to save the earth lower the carbon footprint. The average person lives too nice a lifestyle.
[1:04:23.800 --> 1:04:30.920]  You're not essential and it's all these filthy stuffed taxidermy things like Robert De Niro
[1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:39.080]  and Jane Fonda and Madonna telling you you need to be poor and die while they're filthy
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:43.080]  rich. And of course, they're doing this the best the global. So now, oh, it's been the
[1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:46.920]  curb for two weeks, stay homes, the hospitals don't get overwhelmed. Then nothing really
[1:04:46.920 --> 1:04:53.120]  happens. CBS got caught staging the lines at a very hospital we exposed. Listers went
[1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:57.160]  and said there's no one there. And then look, no one would be there for two days. People
[1:04:57.160 --> 1:05:04.200]  stake these things out in New Jersey, Alabama, New York, you name it, California, Colorado.
[1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:09.800]  Hello, our own power Nixon went out and showed it. And they're on the news going, look at
[1:05:09.800 --> 1:05:13.840]  this line body bags. And you get there. And it's like all these dudes in hazmat suits
[1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:24.440]  standing around for cameras. No one ever goes in because they were actors. And they now
[1:05:24.440 --> 1:05:33.400]  admit it. CBS has been caught. Let's see now the panic hysteria is here. We need governors
[1:05:33.400 --> 1:05:38.720]  to wake up. We need judges to wake up. We need city councils to wake up. We need county
[1:05:38.720 --> 1:05:43.000]  commissioners to wake up. We need Congress to wake up. We need President Trump that knows
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:49.480]  all this. And it's coming out yesterday and saying, I think the virus will be gone soon.
[1:05:49.480 --> 1:06:00.720]  It's just got to be exposed, ladies and gentlemen. So it's all going down, folks. And Veritas
[1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:05.080]  even caught undercover than admitting their actors. Doesn't mean they're want some real
[1:06:05.080 --> 1:06:10.320]  cases. Doesn't mean there isn't a real virus, but they're hyping it and creating the fear
[1:06:10.320 --> 1:06:14.640]  at the hospitals because they were ordered to do so to get the money.
[1:06:14.640 --> 1:06:23.480]  The video is up. I'm going to make the featured video on banned on video. Doctors in black
[1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:29.280]  planned to Demick. Only way this gets out. Only way these people that have been suppressed
[1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:35.520]  get out these heroes is you. And let me tell you, it's not heroic for you or I to share
[1:06:35.520 --> 1:06:39.240]  this video by word of mouth, by email, by text message that's still available, getting
[1:06:39.240 --> 1:06:51.040]  sent everywhere else. It's survival. If I was in a car wreck, there's a car hit me and
[1:06:51.040 --> 1:06:54.880]  I ran off a bridge and went into water and then I hit my head and the car is starting
[1:06:54.880 --> 1:06:59.520]  to go under water and waters coming in. I'm not a hero open in the door up. And if one
[1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:02.840]  of my kids is in the car, getting them out and trying to swim to the surface, it's called
[1:07:02.840 --> 1:07:09.400]  default position. And these predators that are part of this think they're they're low
[1:07:09.400 --> 1:07:11.920]  level minions think they're going to be part of this. I want them to know you're going
[1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:17.280]  to get screwed by your bosses. You're crazy. And there's still time to turn back and not
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:21.240]  be part of this. But let's not worry about those working for evil. Let's worry about
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:25.360]  those of us that know what's going on. What are you doing to expose this? Here's part
[1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:36.960]  of the video.
[1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:42.040]  Dr. Judy Mykovitz has been called one of the most accomplished scientists of her generation.
[1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:47.520]  Her 1991 doctoral thesis revolutionized the treatment of HIV AIDS. At the height of her
[1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:53.480]  career, Dr. Mykovitz published a blockbuster article in the journal Science. The controversial
[1:07:53.480 --> 1:07:57.640]  article sent shockwaves to the scientific community as it revealed that the common use
[1:07:57.640 --> 1:08:03.000]  of animal and human fetal tissues were unleashing devastating plagues of chronic diseases for
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:08.320]  exposing their deadly secrets. The millions of big pharma waged war on Dr. Mykovitz, destroying
[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:15.640]  her good name, career and personal life. Now, as the fate of nations hang in the balance,
[1:08:15.640 --> 1:08:20.360]  Dr. Mykovitz is naming names of those behind the plague of corruption that places all human
[1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:22.960]  life in danger.
[1:08:22.960 --> 1:08:28.600]  So you made a discovery that conflicted with the agreed upon narrative. Correct. And for
[1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:34.360]  that, they did everything in their powers to destroy your life. Correct. You were arrested.
[1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:40.560]  Correct. And then you were put under a gag order. For five years, if I went on social
[1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:48.800]  media, if I said anything at all, they would find new evidence and put me back in jail.
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:54.320]  And it was one of the few times I cried. And it was because I knew there was no evidence
[1:08:54.320 --> 1:09:01.120]  the first time. And when you can unleash that kind of force to force someone into bankruptcy
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:08.520]  with a perfect credit score. And so that I couldn't bring my 97 witnesses, which included
[1:09:08.520 --> 1:09:15.360]  the heads Tony Fauci, you know, Ian Lipkin, the heads of the public health in HHS who
[1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:19.880]  would have had to testify that we did absolutely nothing wrong.
[1:09:19.880 --> 1:09:25.320]  And so what did they charge you with? Nothing. But you were in jail? I was held in jail with
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:36.520]  no charges. I was called a fugitive from justice. No warrant literally drug me on the house.
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:40.800]  Our neighbors are looking at what's going on here. You know, they searched my house without
[1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:47.360]  a warrant. You literally terrorized my husband for five days. They said, if you don't find
[1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:53.000]  the notebooks, if you don't find the material, which was not in my possession, but planted
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:58.440]  in my house, as if you took intellectual property from the laboratory. Is that correct? It was
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:04.680]  intended to appear as if I took confidential material names and intellectual property
[1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:10.960]  from the laboratory. And I could prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that I didn't. Heads
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:18.520]  of our entire HHS colluded and destroy my reputation. And the Department of Justice
[1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:24.520]  and the FBI sat on it and kept that case under seal, which means you can't say there's a
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:29.840]  case or your lawyers are held in contempt of court. So you can't even get a lawyer to
[1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:37.440]  defend you. So every single due process right was taken away from me. And to this day remains
[1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:43.040]  the same. I have no constitutional freedoms or rights yet. You sit here. I think a lot
[1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:49.160]  of people would probably have just taken the retirement out early, laid low, but you have
[1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:56.120]  decided to come forth when your gag order has been released to write a book called Plague
[1:10:56.120 --> 1:11:03.320]  of Corruption, Restoring Faith in the Promise of Science. And you are naming names. Absolutely.
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:09.600]  Apparently their attempt to silence you has failed. And I have to ask, how do you sit
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:15.880]  here with confidence to call out these great forces and not fear for your life as you leave
[1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:21.920]  this building? Because if we don't stop this now, we can not only forget our republic and
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:27.800]  our freedom, but we can forget humanity because we'll be killed by this agenda.
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:31.720]  Stop right there. And this woman is who she says, one of the top scientists, probably
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:36.520]  the top female virologist in the world. And she's in there and they're like, you're putting
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:41.160]  cancer viruses, you're putting whole genomes in people. And she was seeing it kill people.
[1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:45.440]  Why do they were getting so unhealthy? And they're like, whoa, lady, you're not supposed
[1:11:45.440 --> 1:11:53.720]  to tell people this, but you heard her. It's the end of humanity. Now, I can tell you,
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:58.080]  the very same forces that put her in prison have told me that if I don't shut up about
[1:11:58.080 --> 1:12:01.560]  Bill Gates and the rest of the things that happened to me, everybody knows who you are
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:05.800]  with General Flynn. Everybody's seen what you've done to this lady. People are done
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:12.400]  with it. And they know about Waco and all the rest of it. So if you think you can take
[1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:15.920]  on the American people and then you're going to let Bill Gates come in here and shoot up
[1:12:15.920 --> 1:12:20.960]  330 million Americans with a deadly vaccine, he admits is going to hurt a bunch of people.
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:26.040]  Well, you're on the wrong side of history. And you're in a death cult and you're crazy.
[1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:29.360]  But it doesn't matter. They select the people, these government positions because they're
[1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:36.960]  yes men and they follow orders. It's incredible. This is biblical, ladies and gentlemen, we're
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:41.800]  going to come back with more of this powerful, powerful information. Tell folks to tune in

[1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:57.000]  quality, horrible food, not because of the virus, but because of the crises in the economic
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:01.840]  shutdown, it would cause, because the globalists were planning to hold America hostage and
[1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:06.780]  run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states. Now that prediction has come
[1:14:06.780 --> 1:14:12.880]  true because the globalists are running an operation. It's not predictions. We have
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:17.560]  their battle plans. So going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storeable food
[1:14:17.560 --> 1:14:22.520]  companies were sold out, except my patriots supply because they're the biggest or pre-position.
[1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:26.480]  But it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:30.480]  to fulfill them in a timely manner. They stopped taking orders till they got caught back up.
[1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:34.480]  Well, now they're caught back up. They've got high quality, horrible food in stock,
[1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:39.520]  ready to be packaged and shipped to you. Get your orders in now at infowarstore.com to

[1:14:48.440 --> 1:14:53.480]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporates media and the chai comms
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:59.560]  is going to now trigger a worldwide depression. In fact, we're already into the worldwide
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:04.080]  depression and the death sentence for the third world. But it's critical to understand
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:10.200]  that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be. A month of shutdown
[1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:14.400]  will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy. That's what
[1:15:14.400 --> 1:15:18.760]  we've always said. It's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient
[1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:24.040]  because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[1:15:24.040 --> 1:15:29.920]  They've admitted all of this. So remember, how does info wars continue years and decades
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:34.920]  in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen? Because we're following
[1:15:34.920 --> 1:15:40.200]  the globalist blueprint and their battle plan. And yes, it's dystopic and yes, it's scary.
[1:15:40.200 --> 1:15:44.640]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary. It's time
[1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:51.640]  to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:21.560]  I'm very sad to have to report these things to you here on air. But you can't choose
[1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:29.240]  your reality. You can change your reality with hard work, with determination. But the
[1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:34.440]  fact that we've been so disconnected watching movies, watching science fiction horror movies
[1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:43.240]  and dystopias, while the real one was unfolding around us has allowed this evil to grow. But
[1:16:43.240 --> 1:16:49.080]  here's this woman, well known. I was told about this film a couple days ago. I'd already
[1:16:49.080 --> 1:16:57.280]  heard about her book. I was already talking about trying to get her on. And then I watched
[1:16:57.280 --> 1:17:04.240]  the film last night. And as I sat here, all these people were sending me text messages
[1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:11.320]  of it in different video backup services and I realized it was on Band-Aid video for free
[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:18.280]  right now. And I just hope you don't let her courage fall onto unfertilized soil because
[1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:22.880]  people ask me, well, why do you do this? Why do you stand up against these people? Well,
[1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:28.960]  what choice do I have? I mean, if Bill Gates hadn't run around and all those interviews
[1:17:28.960 --> 1:17:34.640]  on PBS 25 years ago saying he wants to depopulate the planet, and if he didn't have awards
[1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:40.520]  at Vassar for depopulating the planet, and if they weren't admitting that was his planet,
[1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:47.600]  if I didn't know all about it, his family and about the IBM trust he runs, then I wouldn't
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:57.440]  be exposing him. And again, it's not a macho man thing. At a subconscious level, I'm very
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:03.720]  mad at myself doing this because I like to live. I like to not be in prison. But you
[1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:11.280]  know, my spirit stronger than my flesh, and it's in full command. And my spirit says you're
[1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:19.960]  not doing enough, son. Are you with the enemy? And it's not even that I fear God, that's
[1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:28.440]  what people call it. It's more like I can see God. And it's no debate about joining
[1:18:28.440 --> 1:18:32.920]  these Satanists when you know God's there. You're just like, you feel God's hate of them,
[1:18:32.920 --> 1:18:39.040]  and that's what you call God. You're like, whoa, these people are screwed, man. Wow.
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:45.000]  They think they got power in their short life. Whoa, you pissed off the universe, Jack. You
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:49.360]  can see it in this woman's eyes, this famous scientist. She's empowered by all the persecution.
[1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:53.120]  She's not scared. And she's telling the truth. I don't just believe her numbers about the
[1:18:53.120 --> 1:18:57.960]  fetal tissue and the cancer viruses and the side effects and the sterilization and the
[1:18:57.960 --> 1:19:06.720]  Gardasil did this and that. It's true. All right, go back to her. Here we go. And I have
[1:19:06.720 --> 1:19:13.560]  to ask, how do you sit here with confidence to call out these great forces and not fear
[1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:18.600]  for your life as you leave this building? Because if we don't stop this now, we can
[1:19:18.600 --> 1:19:24.320]  not only forget our republic and our freedom, but we can forget humanity because we'll be
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:30.520]  killed by this agenda. So Anthony Fauci. My name is Dr. Tony Fauci. I'm the director
[1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:36.480]  of the man who is heading the pandemic task force was involved in a cover up. He directed
[1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:44.000]  the cover up. And in fact, everybody else was paid off and paid off big time. Millions
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:19:50.440]  of dollars in funding from Tony Fauci, Tony Fauci's organization, National Institute
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:56.320]  of Allergy Infectious Disease. These investigators that committed the fraud continue to this day
[1:19:56.320 --> 1:20:02.600]  to be paid big time by the NIAID. And the whole world is listening to his advice for
[1:20:02.600 --> 1:20:06.720]  how to handle this current pandemic. How do we know that what he's saying is what we
[1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:13.960]  need to be learning? What he's saying is absolute propaganda and the same kind of propaganda
[1:20:13.960 --> 1:20:21.240]  that he's perpetrated to kill millions since 1984. We know from this study quite clearly
[1:20:21.240 --> 1:20:26.160]  that there will be a delay in progression significantly greater than for individuals
[1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:31.400]  who do not take the drug. It started really when I was 25 years old. I was part of the
[1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:40.920]  team that isolated HIV from the saliva and blood of the patients from France where Luc
[1:20:40.920 --> 1:20:52.560]  Manjigné had originally isolated the virus. This was a confirmatory study, but Tony Fauci
[1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:58.960]  and Robert Gallo were working together then to spin the story in a different way. At that
[1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:05.760]  time, Dr. Rossetti was out of town and Tony Fauci says, you know, we understand that you
[1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:11.960]  have a paper in press and we want a copy of it. And I said, yes, there's a paper in
[1:21:11.960 --> 1:21:19.360]  press and it's confidential and no, I will not give you a copy of it. He started screaming
[1:21:19.360 --> 1:21:25.440]  at me then he said, give us the paper right now or you'll be fired for insubordination.
[1:21:25.440 --> 1:21:30.560]  And I just said, I'm sure when Dr. Rossetti gets back, you can have the conversation.
[1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:36.000]  And so Frank comes back, you know, several weeks later and is really bullied into giving
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:42.680]  Fauci the paper. Fauci holds up the publication of the paper for several months while Robert
[1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:48.480]  Gallo writes his own paper and takes all the credit. And of course patents are involved.
[1:21:48.480 --> 1:21:55.600]  This delay of the confirmation, you know, literally led to spreading the virus around,
[1:21:55.600 --> 1:22:01.760]  you know, killing millions. Perhaps no one expressed the anguish of AIDS better than
[1:22:01.760 --> 1:22:10.480]  New York writer Larry Kramer. But he was even more angry at the federal government and the
[1:22:10.480 --> 1:22:18.720]  pharmaceutical industry. One person who felt Kramer's fury was NIH Dr. Anthony Fauci. He
[1:22:18.720 --> 1:22:25.560]  called Tony Fauci the Bernie Madoff of science. It's still been crushing to me to think
[1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:34.840]  that I didn't know my work in 1999 was something that had been avoided. From 83 and 82 when
[1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:40.960]  the virus was isolated, the virus didn't have to wait until 84 to be confirmed. Think of
[1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:47.920]  how many people the entire continent of Africa, you know, lost a generation. Because they
[1:22:47.920 --> 1:22:53.760]  were spreading it. The virus was spread through because of the arrogance of a group of people
[1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:57.640]  and it includes Robert Redfield, who's now the head of CDC.
[1:22:57.640 --> 1:23:04.920]  I'll hit pause. Back that up. You see the billboards in Africa. Thank you, Mr. Gates.
[1:23:04.920 --> 1:23:09.640]  Back that up. Radio listeners can hear this TV viewers office here saying it. And again,
[1:23:09.640 --> 1:23:14.960]  ladies and gentlemen, this makes me physically ill. But we have to sit here and we have
[1:23:14.960 --> 1:23:21.920]  to expose this. Okay. And I'm not being dramatic when I tell you that they have basically told
[1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:26.560]  me this is shot across the bow that we're going to do to you. We've done to this lady.
[1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:32.320]  If you don't shut up, how do I shut up and join killing everybody? I mean, it's it's
[1:23:32.320 --> 1:23:35.600]  like, I get people say, Jones, how do you have all this courage? I'm trying to explain
[1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:41.600]  listeners. This is not courage.
[1:23:41.600 --> 1:23:48.880]  This is sanity. It's too able to fail is what they predict. It's what they hope. What did
[1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:52.440]  Joseph Goebbels say? He said the big it's always for me, the Hitler, it's not Hitler,
[1:23:52.440 --> 1:23:57.200]  Joseph Goebbels, his propaganda minister who said, if you're going to tell a lie, tell
[1:23:57.200 --> 1:24:03.480]  a gigantic super ultra massive big one. He said, you tell a huge one because people will
[1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:09.760]  believe it's so fantastical and so big that it must be true. It's got to be over the top
[1:24:09.760 --> 1:24:20.880]  like saying there aren't two sexes. The full documentary is hit man dot video while we're
[1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:23.960]  still able to get it out to you. We've had server problems because of massive traffic
[1:24:23.960 --> 1:24:27.840]  again on the live streams, but we have the audio streams. We have the radio stations,
[1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:31.440]  TV stations, and we have the archives that are still up and running. But there's a lot
[1:24:31.440 --> 1:24:36.360]  of stuff going on. So this is the quickening that everybody's witnessing right now. Their
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:42.240]  house of cards must go down. Just like Bernie Madoff, Fauci must fall or the planet falls.
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:48.200]  Hundreds of millions will die if he is not stopped. I'm sorry. It has to happen. The
[1:24:48.200 --> 1:24:51.800]  America that we've known and loved, the America that was the land of the free home of the
[1:24:51.800 --> 1:24:58.320]  brave is dying right now. And everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us,
[1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:03.440]  shutting us down and making us dependent on them. The food shortages have begun. The depression
[1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:07.320]  is going to be long and very, very serious. In fact, it's probably too late now to even
[1:25:07.320 --> 1:25:11.240]  turn back. Trump tried to stop it. But the mainstream media working with the tricombs
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:17.440]  blocked it. That's why you and myself, everybody else has to get prepared now. Do not wait.
[1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:21.320]  It's not about the virus. It's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the
[1:25:21.320 --> 1:25:25.880]  next six months to a year. Get your high quality, storeable foods. And in FullWareShore.com,
[1:25:25.880 --> 1:25:30.440]  they're available again before a limited time. The food supply is running out. There are
[1:25:30.440 --> 1:25:36.960]  major shortages. This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism.
[1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:40.920]  But we, the people, the patriots have to be prepared. We've already been proven right
[1:25:40.920 --> 1:25:44.200]  about prepping so far. We'll get ready to be really proven right. Get your storeable
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:47.520]  foods now at infowarstore.com.
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:54.240]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship. The lockdown is designed to have the public accept
[1:25:54.240 --> 1:26:01.760]  their basic rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Biddle
[1:26:01.760 --> 1:26:07.920]  Mill and the Gates Foundation in full control. Many will submit through fear. Others will
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:14.680]  be bought off. But in the end, the globalists admit they're building a post-human world.
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:21.760]  And now that we're inside the cage, it's going to move very, very quickly into its end game.
[1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:27.360]  Moving into this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our
[1:26:27.360 --> 1:26:33.840]  own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing
[1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:40.400]  this. This is your dignity, your soul, your future being poured inside out. This is a
[1:26:40.400 --> 1:26:45.600]  scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfish, disgusting
[1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:47.000]  power trip.
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:50.840]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:55.000]  to a song and telling you all these horrible things. But you notice almost everything we've
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:27:01.440]  talked about, horrible, has come true. We were warning everybody to try to stop it. It's
[1:27:01.440 --> 1:27:05.080]  like telling somebody if you've got a pool, put a fence around it, if you have little
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:09.000]  kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown. People
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:12.800]  don't listen, they go out and their kids dead in the pool. Well, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:16.920]  this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the first world. And this is 21st
[1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:22.560]  century warfare carried out by the globalist and they admit they've orchestrated it. They
[1:27:22.560 --> 1:27:27.440]  admit it's good to save the earth and they're teaching us to be more frugal and they want
[1:27:27.440 --> 1:27:32.920]  to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy. I know all
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:37.920]  this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public because
[1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:42.600]  it's their operations manual. I wish this wasn't the case, but they're really our evil
[1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:49.600]  psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them.
[1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:25.120]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones. That documentary, Doctors in Black, is up
[1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:30.280]  at Band-Aid video for free. I hope you spread it to everybody you know. Then she gets into
[1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:35.200]  the fetal tissue, the cancer viruses in the vaccines. I'll just go off what that lady
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:40.200]  says, even though she was an award-winning prestigious neurologist. We live this, we
[1:28:40.200 --> 1:28:46.400]  study this, it's all confirmed now. But she was going to expose how they knew it and did
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:52.600]  it on purpose so they had 100 FBI agents in paramilitary gear and armored vehicles raid
[1:28:52.600 --> 1:28:57.680]  her little house so the public watched TV and went, well, she must be bad. Man, that
[1:28:57.680 --> 1:29:05.760]  woman and her husband with no criminal records, she must add a nuclear bomb. Just like they
[1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:15.520]  did Roger Stone's house. Same story over and over and over and over again. Now, I want
[1:29:15.520 --> 1:29:19.560]  to talk, there's so many powerful reports, I need to go to them. This is a report up
[1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:29.240]  on infowars.com. Roll up your sleeve, America. The swine flu fraud of 76 has arrived. Why
[1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:33.400]  will Americans learn from history? It's a daring green piece and it ties into a 60
[1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:38.240]  minutes report from back at the time. So they tell you, no bad reactions from vaccines.
[1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:42.320]  They're wonderful, even though they've been covering up what's really in them, cancer
[1:29:42.320 --> 1:29:48.200]  viruses, human genomes, just all sorts of horrible allergies. Where do you think all
[1:29:48.200 --> 1:29:54.520]  the allergies exploding came from? Our immune systems are being turned off by the vaccines.
[1:29:54.520 --> 1:30:00.480]  Every study says on vaccines that they lower immunity. They might teach your body about
[1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:06.640]  some other pathogen, but other than that, everything else is lowered. They're making
[1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:13.240]  it where we can't live in the normal environment, just like most babies are born cesarean now.
[1:30:13.240 --> 1:30:17.880]  They have a formula. They're carrying it out. They tell women, don't breastfeed your babies
[1:30:17.880 --> 1:30:22.280]  because they don't mix the brain smaller, makes you stupid. They know what they're doing.
[1:30:22.280 --> 1:30:28.160]  It's a formula of control. Here's this report. It's powerful. Again, only you can carry the
[1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:34.400]  ball. Please spread it. Here it is. Remember the swine flu scare of 1976? That was the
[1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:38.760]  year the US government told us all that swine flu could turn out to be a killer that could
[1:30:38.760 --> 1:30:44.000]  spread across the nation. And Washington decided that every man, woman, and child in the nation
[1:30:44.000 --> 1:30:48.760]  should get a shot to prevent a nationwide outbreak, a pandemic. I don't need another
[1:30:48.760 --> 1:30:55.320]  flu shot. I had a flu shot last year. A swine flu epidemic may be coming. Swine flu, man,
[1:30:55.320 --> 1:31:00.680]  I'm too fast to let it catch me. You'll want to be protected, especially if you're elderly
[1:31:00.680 --> 1:31:07.080]  or chronically ill. Get a shot of protection. A swine flu shot. Well, 46 million of us
[1:31:07.080 --> 1:31:13.160]  obediently took the shot. And now 4,000 Americans are claiming damages from Uncle Sam amounting
[1:31:13.160 --> 1:31:18.280]  to three and a half billion dollars because of what happened when they took that shot.
[1:31:18.280 --> 1:31:22.960]  By far the greatest number of the claims, two thirds of them, are for neurological damage
[1:31:22.960 --> 1:31:30.440]  or even death. This virus was the cause of a pandemic in 1918 and 1919 that resulted
[1:31:30.440 --> 1:31:36.360]  in over half a million deaths in the United States, as well as 20 million deaths around
[1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:41.920]  the world. See how easy it is. Thus the US government's publicity machine was cranked
[1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:47.400]  into action to urge all America to protect itself against the swine flu menace. Influenza
[1:31:47.400 --> 1:31:53.160]  is serious business. During major flu epidemics, millions of people are sick and thousands
[1:31:53.160 --> 1:31:59.120]  die. Well, this year you can get protection. The vaccines are safe, easy to take, and they
[1:31:59.120 --> 1:32:05.840]  can protect you against flu. So roll up your sleeve. Protect yourself. One of those who
[1:32:05.840 --> 1:32:10.800]  did roll up her sleeve was Judy Roberts. She was perfectly healthy and active woman when
[1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:16.600]  in November of 1976, she took her shot. Two weeks later, she said she began to feel a
[1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:24.440]  numbness starting up her legs. By the following week, I was totally paralyzed. So completely
[1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:29.120]  paralyzed in fact that they had to operate on her to enable her to breathe. And for six
[1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:35.040]  months, Judy Roberts was a quadriplegic. The diagnosis? A neurological disorder called
[1:32:35.040 --> 1:32:40.880]  Guillain-Barre syndrome. This disease can even kill. Indeed, there are 300 claims now pending
[1:32:40.880 --> 1:32:46.840]  from the families of GBS victims who died, allegedly as a result of the swine flu shot.
[1:32:46.840 --> 1:32:51.560]  Judy, why did you take the flu shot? I'd never taken any other flu shots, but I felt
[1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:58.400]  like this was going to be a major epidemic. And the only way to prevent a major epidemic
[1:32:58.400 --> 1:33:04.560]  of a really deadly variety of flu was for everybody to be immunized. As part of informing
[1:33:04.560 --> 1:33:10.040]  Americans about the swine flu threat, Dr. Sensor's CDC also helped create the advertising
[1:33:10.040 --> 1:33:14.360]  to get the public to take the shot. There's only one thing I can think of that hits harder
[1:33:14.360 --> 1:33:18.960]  than us. What can that be? The swine flu. It can knock you flat. So what's the defense
[1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:23.280]  for it, huh? Like our philosophy. You got to hit it before it hits you. You mean the
[1:33:23.280 --> 1:33:29.000]  shot? Yeah. You got yours? You better believe it. The swine flu wants to challenge me. I'm
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:34.360]  ready. Oh, me too, brother. Me too. Get the swine flu shot. Time is running out. We read
[1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:40.000]  to you from one of your own agency's memos, planning the campaign to urge Americans to
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:46.760]  take the shot. The swine flu vaccine has been taken by many important persons. For example,
[1:33:46.760 --> 1:33:53.040]  President Ford, Henry Kissinger, Elton John, Muhammad Ali, Mary Palamore, Rudolph Nureyev,
[1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:58.960]  Walter Fungite, Ralph Nader, Edward Kennedy, etc. etc. Did you talk to these people beforehand
[1:33:58.960 --> 1:34:02.880]  to find out if they planned to take the shot? I did not know. Did anybody? I do not know.
[1:34:02.880 --> 1:34:07.280]  Did you get permission to use their names in your campaign? I do not know. Mary, did
[1:34:07.280 --> 1:34:12.200]  you take a swine flu shot? No, I did not. Did you give them permission to use your
[1:34:12.200 --> 1:34:17.440]  name saying that you had or were going to? Absolutely not. Never did. Did you ask your
[1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:21.240]  own doctor about taking the swine flu shot? Yes, and at the time he thought it might be
[1:34:21.240 --> 1:34:26.960]  a good idea. But I resisted it because I was leery of having the symptoms that sometimes
[1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:32.880]  go with that kind of inoculation. A man with my government, because they knew the fact,
[1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:37.640]  that they did not release those facts because if they had released them, the people would
[1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:42.360]  not have taken it. And they can come out tomorrow and tell me there is going to be an epidemic
[1:34:42.360 --> 1:34:46.920]  and they can drop off like flies next to me. I will not take another shot that my government
[1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:50.840]  tells me to take. Meantime, Judy Roberts and some 4,000 others
[1:34:50.840 --> 1:35:09.080]  like her are still waiting for their day in court. Guys, back that up 20 seconds to show
[1:35:09.080 --> 1:35:15.400]  that poor lady who has leg braces on the walk because there is another sweet lady who died
[1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:22.840]  a couple of years ago named Benny Grace Hammett. Her maiden name was Pope and she was my mother's
[1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:30.720]  mother. She was my grandmother. And in the mid 1950s when my uncle was 8 and my mom was
[1:35:30.720 --> 1:35:39.480]  4, they said come on down and get your shot for the polio and they called a month later
[1:35:39.480 --> 1:35:46.560]  and said come back down and get your second shot. And they gave it to her and it ate most
[1:35:46.560 --> 1:35:51.880]  of the nerves in her body and almost killed her. They had her set up with her iron lung
[1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:57.240]  for a while. And the doctor told her, Benny, it was the
[1:35:57.240 --> 1:36:03.800]  live polio vaccine we gave you. We are sorry this had not perfected yet. And she was on
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:10.040]  crutches for the rest of her life in an excruciating pain. But I'm supposed to see Bill Gates
[1:36:10.040 --> 1:36:17.040]  up there telling me that it's all safe and effective. But yes, 700,000 of you are going
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:22.240]  to get sick or die and he smiles about it. And then I'm not supposed to get mad at him.
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:27.200]  I'm supposed to say yes, sir, Mr. Gates. I'm going to do what you say, Mr. Gates. You're
[1:36:27.200 --> 1:36:32.720]  my boss, Mr. Gates. Because now they say it's safe and effective everywhere. They say there's
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:40.040]  no problems with vaccines. But see, that backfired because doctors know there are. And so that's
[1:36:40.040 --> 1:36:44.280]  why they're panicking now. That's why they know they've got a big problem.
[1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:48.680]  You see, but it's not just a side effect, ladies and gentlemen, none of these vaccines
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:55.280]  protect you from anything. It's about corrupt scientific dictatorships being able to put
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:37:01.960]  in your body what they want when they want. And that's the reality. Just like they lied
[1:37:01.960 --> 1:37:05.520]  to you about the numbers and COVID-19. It's like they lied about you where it came from.
[1:37:05.520 --> 1:37:12.920]  Just like they lied to you about everything and put on those charts in every blue city
[1:37:12.920 --> 1:37:17.280]  in Blue County, some red areas, but you notice it's all the blue areas that admit, yeah,
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:22.680]  we're counting everything as COVID, even if we didn't test you. We want the money. The
[1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:27.760]  money is just the incentive to get all the corrupt local officials to go along. This
[1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:34.440]  isn't about money. This is about sterilizing your acid and planting you with time-release
[1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:39.880]  cancer viruses. If you look it up, that's exactly what they do. Oh, yeah, that polio
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:46.640]  shot my grandma and got the second one. It had SV 40 in it, too, a very aggressive cancer.
[1:37:46.640 --> 1:37:50.800]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:57.400]  economy to wear this. Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been
[1:37:57.400 --> 1:38:02.120]  shut down for two months, it is going to be a death sentence to the third world and a horrible
[1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:06.560]  nightmarish collapse for the first world, and that the general public is going to go
[1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:11.520]  into deep, deep debt to the megabanks. They're not going to have medical ID cards, forced
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:18.640]  inoculations. We are now in a giant dystopia, but a lot of people are waking up and there
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:24.560]  is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny, and we must all rediscover our bill
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:30.040]  of rights, rediscover our constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people
[1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:34.080]  who take this moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down,
[1:38:34.080 --> 1:38:39.000]  it will save lives. No, it's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:43.320]  more. So the cowards who went along with us with your virtues signaling, you have destroyed
[1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:50.360]  your lives and our lives. Congratulations. Make a friend with death. It's the same soul
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:56.560]  that no one knows who first said it. Every culture has their own way of memorializing
[1:38:56.560 --> 1:39:02.240]  that simple statement, but you don't want to make a friend of the death of civilization
[1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:08.520]  and the death of the human species. The moment of truth is now here. We are facing the post-human
[1:39:08.520 --> 1:39:13.800]  era, and I've been warning you for many years that they would use a global viral crisis
[1:39:13.800 --> 1:39:20.200]  to click, put us in the cage, and then roll out the robot takeover. This is just the
[1:39:20.200 --> 1:39:27.280]  beta test. China is moving out of beta and into operational control. In just a few years,
[1:39:27.280 --> 1:39:32.960]  we will be under full globalist control, forced inoculations, total surveillance. We're all
[1:39:32.960 --> 1:39:39.280]  being taught that we are obsolete. The term they use is non-essential. This is not some
[1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:48.800]  dystopian novel. This is reality. This is the new world order. This is Satanism. Globalism
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:56.040]  is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[1:39:56.040 --> 1:40:01.440]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family
[1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:06.840]  farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large
[1:40:06.840 --> 1:40:13.700]  corporate conglomerate. That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is
[1:40:13.700 --> 1:40:19.440]  phased out, they can simply look at us and say, because, again, you are non-essential.
[1:40:19.440 --> 1:40:24.160]  That's what the robots and all of this is about. It's about setting it up where we're
[1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:29.480]  no longer in charge of our lives. We can be told to stay on our houses, and after all,
[1:40:29.480 --> 1:40:34.320]  shut up. This world doesn't belong to people anyways. It belongs to the new AI gods, the
[1:40:34.320 --> 1:40:39.200]  rich elitists that emerge with machines. Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:45.120]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing. These people are completely psychotic and
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:41:14.880]  make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[1:41:14.880 --> 1:41:21.040]  Does it just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes
[1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:25.640]  it in a really great way. I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[1:41:25.640 --> 1:41:30.280]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes. But I just love it. Personally,
[1:41:30.280 --> 1:41:34.840]  it has something that's a moisturizer as well. So, this is a real innovation. I don't know
[1:41:34.840 --> 1:41:39.080]  why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential
[1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:50.720]  oil in it so it doesn't dry you out and smells great. It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:42:03.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. I'd like to call to order this secret conclave
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  of America's media empires. We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:11.760]  to put Americans back where they belong and dark rooms glued to their televisions too
[1:42:11.760 --> 1:42:16.680]  terrified to skip the commercials. Well, I think NBC, you are here to listen and not
[1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:23.280]  speak. I think we should go with a good old fashioned public health care. A new disease.
[1:42:23.280 --> 1:42:27.560]  No one's immune. It's like the summer of the shark except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic
[1:42:27.560 --> 1:42:33.000]  and instead of summer, it's all the time. Now, I hate to be the guy who derails what
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:38.840]  everybody else loves. Loves being that guy. But Janice, we do have standards. This can't
[1:42:38.840 --> 1:42:44.320]  be a made up disease. The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general
[1:42:44.320 --> 1:42:49.000]  public. We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested. Get over
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:43:01.040]  here, NBC. We certainly believe in testing, but. Wow. Wow. Oh, yeah. Oh, we've got our
[1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:06.880]  deadly disease. No, we just have to blame it on something that's in every household,
[1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:12.040]  something that people are a little bit afraid of already. House cat flu is coming, people.
[1:43:12.040 --> 1:43:15.520]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the house
[1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:22.520]  cat flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern. So better be aware that
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:33.800]  warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender vitals. Springfielders
[1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:38.120]  are advised to stay tuned for more information if they experience any of the following symptoms.
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:44.560]  Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night. Now you could take that minute and
[1:43:44.560 --> 1:43:52.640]  a half piece and you could teach a college degree on it. Every one second would be a
[1:43:52.640 --> 1:44:03.880]  semester. There's a PhD level. Let's just take one facet of this million faceted gym.
[1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:12.320]  Why in 1993 would the Simpsons put out a piece like that? Well, it's one of the highest
[1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:19.640]  paid shows for writers and they want to show the establishment and the writers that write
[1:44:19.640 --> 1:44:25.400]  the news propaganda and that write the big hoaxes, the new wars, the new diseases that
[1:44:25.400 --> 1:44:31.240]  they're even better because the writers at the Simpsons and that level know that they're
[1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:37.200]  supposedly the highest paid writers, but they talk to colleagues that leave and they know
[1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:44.080]  there's a level above it at the CIA and at the foundation level that write the scripts
[1:44:44.080 --> 1:44:48.920]  for say COVID-19 and the rollout and see previous scripts have been written on how to roll something
[1:44:48.920 --> 1:44:55.040]  out. Let's say it's a rat. Let's say it's bugs. Let's say it's your cat. Let's say it's people
[1:44:55.040 --> 1:45:02.520]  you can't trust. And then they put out fake models to create more fear and it's everything
[1:45:02.520 --> 1:45:11.240]  is in there and you're like, how is this exactly the same parallel? Because it's a plan. Well,
[1:45:11.240 --> 1:45:18.000]  how do they cook up a plan like this on the phones and at board meetings with each other
[1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:22.480]  and not get busted by the government? Because let me tell you, you got a bunch of yes, been
[1:45:22.480 --> 1:45:27.280]  in different agencies, you got problems, but the average person, let's say at the FBI,
[1:45:27.280 --> 1:45:32.080]  is not a megalomaniac mastermind criminal. They're just doing their little cases and
[1:45:32.080 --> 1:45:38.800]  beavering away on what they're doing. Same thing with the CIA or federal marshals or
[1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:44.200]  you know, doing protective details. It's all compartmentalized. But if you study these
[1:45:44.200 --> 1:45:51.440]  big events, the UN has a drill. John Hopkins has a drill. The British government has a
[1:45:51.440 --> 1:45:55.240]  drill. All these other groups have drills and then they look at all the drills they've
[1:45:55.240 --> 1:46:02.240]  had and they debate the scenarios and they go, oh, let's create a new drill that say
[1:46:02.240 --> 1:46:09.000]  in 2020, 65 million people die from a coronavirus that escapes the lab. That's in 2018. They
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:17.160]  had those drills. And then right as it starts in November, October, November, Bill and Melinda
[1:46:17.160 --> 1:46:21.960]  Gates Foundation with John Hopkins, who created the main global models with the Rockefeller
[1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:26.520]  Foundation that created the original lockstep document 10 years before. And then they had
[1:46:26.520 --> 1:46:31.200]  the disease X UN drill two years before. And then right as they launch it, they call it
[1:46:31.200 --> 1:46:40.640]  event 201. A dancing Kissinger's plan of event 200. It's in memorandum 200. Look it up memorandum
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:46.480]  200. It's in department round 200. U.S. Code Title 50 chapters. Fast, remember. U.S. Code
[1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:54.320]  chapter break is working some more. U.S. Code title 50 chapter 32 subjects 1528 paragraph
[1:46:54.320 --> 1:47:01.600]  B. And that all legalizes lethal biological chemical and radiological testing on you if
[1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:07.920]  it is for research or law enforcement purposes. U.S. Code title 50 chapter 32 subjects 1528
[1:47:07.920 --> 1:47:12.480]  paragraph B. And then later they got so much attention, they changed paragraph B to another
[1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:22.240]  subsection they still operate under. But that's the reality of all of this. And so think about
[1:47:22.240 --> 1:47:27.640]  it. You're going to launch an operation. You've got your operatives over the key hospitals,
[1:47:27.640 --> 1:47:35.560]  the key national laboratories, the CDC, the NIH, the National Health Service, the WHO.
[1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:38.680]  Most of their underlings don't know what's going on as departmentalized. And then you're
[1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:45.360]  sitting there taking part to drill in October, launching the operation, and your very people
[1:47:45.360 --> 1:47:49.120]  are there right next to you in the command center, not knowing in the video conferencing
[1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:55.880]  that you're actually implementing the plan. And they show you how they do this in movies
[1:47:55.880 --> 1:48:00.480]  like Ender's Game. I never read Ender's Game. I didn't see it when he came out. And Paris
[1:48:00.480 --> 1:48:05.880]  and Ford's so obnoxious I could barely watch it. But notice the super genius kid thinks
[1:48:05.880 --> 1:48:10.480]  he's doing a drill to go to the top of the class, and really he's defeating the aliens.
[1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:14.680]  And he thinks it's a drill he's running. And that's kind of a metaphor of the joke of how
[1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:19.600]  this is not a drill, this is not a game, this is not a simulation. So that's how they run
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:27.720]  it. And as soon as we grow up and admit all of this, we wake up. And of course anybody
[1:48:27.720 --> 1:48:32.440]  who watches that movie knows how it's going to end. They blow up the alien planet, which
[1:48:32.440 --> 1:48:36.680]  is supposedly the genius master move that no one had thought of when it's the elementary
[1:48:36.680 --> 1:48:41.160]  move of these psychotics to engage in genocide and total extermination, which is the purest
[1:48:41.160 --> 1:48:52.520]  form of war. Oh, there's such geniuses. They blow up the ant planet. Oh, but he's good
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:56.880]  and sneaks off with the baby queen to make a new one, which is them playing God. We destroy
[1:48:56.880 --> 1:49:01.960]  you. We rebuild you. We destroy you. We rebuild you. More of this Illuminati crap. No, thank
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:13.800]  you, Ender, AKA jerk off, AKA demon spawn Bill Gates. So if you want to know how it
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:17.480]  really runs, that's how the cow ate the cabbage. Okay, I said I'd go to calls today, but I've
[1:49:17.480 --> 1:49:21.360]  got a guest joining us the bottom of the hour and I meant to take your calls, but I've got
[1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:24.360]  a ton of news and things I haven't even hit yet. Now they're trying to trigger a race
[1:49:24.360 --> 1:49:28.960]  war again. We're going to break all that down next segment. And then I will take a few calls.
[1:49:28.960 --> 1:49:32.280]  Let's take five, six calls. I just want to have 20 people on hold, make you hold. Let's
[1:49:32.280 --> 1:49:37.560]  take seven calls ahead of the guest, the bottom of the hour on what do you think about Hollywood
[1:49:37.560 --> 1:49:41.200]  scum coming out and admitting that this is all about the population and cutting the economy
[1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:44.760]  off to teach you to be poor to quote, save the earth. I'm going to cover that next segment
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:56.640]  as well. What do you think about that? 8777892539877789 Alex 8777892539. And yes, if you'd like

[1:52:47.400 --> 1:52:53.760]  top of it and the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence starving level for control
[1:52:53.760 --> 1:52:58.680]  in fact in most cultures they call the peasants the little people because they were usually
[1:52:58.680 --> 1:53:05.400]  a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them again at a starving
[1:53:05.400 --> 1:53:10.320]  level they were so busy trying to survive they would never try to challenge the entrenched

[1:55:05.280 --> 1:55:10.920]  of the hour right now i wanted to hit this in texas the governor can order someone's
[1:55:10.920 --> 1:55:16.840]  sentence commuted if they're a murder if it turns out the governor thinks they're innocent
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:20.040]  and the lieutenant governor has offered to pay the ladies fine all the rest of this the
[1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:25.000]  supreme courtiers they ordered her released this judge needs to be sanctioned in dallas
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:31.480]  calling her selfish because she didn't shut her business down when all the other establishment
[1:55:31.480 --> 1:55:36.480]  business can stay open which is by designed to destroy the people's economy so after all
[1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:41.880]  this is over folks only shop with mom and pops or only shop with you know say chick filet

[1:56:05.920 --> 1:56:13.800]  dallas and then here's the lady responding shelly luther who's still in jail right now
[1:56:13.800 --> 1:56:21.200]  that you now see the error of your ways and understand that the society cannot function
[1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:26.760]  where one's own belief in a concept of liberty permits you to flaunt your disdain for the
[1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:33.920]  rulings of duly elected officials that you owe an apology to the elected officials whom
[1:56:33.920 --> 1:56:41.440]  you disrespected disrespected but flagrantly ignoring and in one case the filing their
[1:56:41.440 --> 1:56:48.960]  orders which you now know obviously applies to you what it is called as you understand
[1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:54.160]  that the proper way in which an order in an order of society to engage concerns which
[1:56:54.160 --> 1:57:01.240]  you may have had is to hire a lawyer and advocate for change an exception or an amendment to
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:09.000]  laws that you find offensive that you publicly state that this is the way that citizens in
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:16.760]  the state should behave and that you represent to this court that you will today cease operation
[1:57:16.760 --> 1:57:23.640]  of your salon and not reopen until after further we pay our bills buddy no you all permit you
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:31.400]  to do so let us tire this court will consider the payment of a fine in lieu of the incarceration
[1:57:31.400 --> 1:57:35.480]  which you've demonstrated that you have so clearly earned is there anything you would
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:45.760]  like to see judge I would like to say that I have much respect for this court and laws
[1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:54.120]  that I've never been in this position before and it's not someplace that I want to be but
[1:57:54.120 --> 1:58:00.080]  I have to disagree with you sir when I when you say that I'm selfish sir because feeding
[1:58:00.080 --> 1:58:07.400]  my kids is not selfish I have hair stylists that are going hungry because they'd rather
[1:58:07.400 --> 1:58:14.520]  feed their kids so sir if you think the law is more important than kids getting fed and
[1:58:14.520 --> 1:58:19.920]  please go ahead with your decision but I am not going to shut the salon and notice he
[1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:26.400]  doesn't treat her with any respect total arrogance he needs to move to North Korea you have 100
[1:58:26.400 --> 1:58:30.600]  and plus million people starting to starve to death 300,000 a day dying that's confirmed
[1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:35.560]  it's like oh that's 300,000 dive in 300,000 dead worldwide with made up COVID numbers
[1:58:35.560 --> 1:58:41.120]  but they don't care it's about wearing the coat mask which is a gag a burka where you
[1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:50.560]  can't even hear what people have to say then to give them special microphones this is all
[1:58:50.560 --> 1:58:58.160]  a sick cult joke we become domesticated this is all a test of power and control now there's
[1:58:58.160 --> 1:59:05.520]  the Obama judge right there so that's what we've turned into folks and the freedoms gone
[1:59:05.520 --> 1:59:10.480]  and they're collapsing everything and to cover up for the millions of Africans that are starving
[1:59:10.480 --> 1:59:16.040]  to death the media has turned on the race war drums again to distract from that so we'll
[1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:22.960]  cover that coming up on the other side of this quick break and then your phone calls

[2:00:04.640 --> 2:00:10.920]  forms of media they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance so now is the time
[2:00:10.920 --> 2:00:14.680]  to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate everything

[2:00:25.720 --> 2:00:32.720]  us to not let them silence any of us we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity

[2:00:59.800 --> 2:01:03.360]  front lines of the info war.
[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:09.080]  We were told it was only 15 days to bend the curve it was all fake numbers put up a bullum
[2:01:09.080 --> 2:01:13.640]  on the Gates Foundation 30, 40, 50 times what they claimed they would be depending on the
[2:01:13.640 --> 2:01:19.560]  graph then they went oh sorry it's a month it's two months it's two years it's never
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:23.960]  ending and Bill Gates laughed and said no it's a global depression and Hollywood has
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:33.600]  now put out a report where they 200 quote stars the usual suspects Madonna Robert De Niro
[2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:41.720]  the disgraced Hanoi Jane Fonda saying it's good for the earth it's good depopulate they're
[2:01:41.720 --> 2:01:48.440]  actually admitting what it's all about right now and they admit it's about killing the
[2:01:48.440 --> 2:01:52.800]  economy and punishing Trump and stopping consumerism well I tell you give up your private jets
[2:01:52.800 --> 2:02:00.600]  lady well the Texas governor came out yesterday and said you need to release that woman to
[2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:11.360]  the judge the Obama judge in Dallas and he didn't do it so now the governor has issued
[2:02:11.360 --> 2:02:17.640]  an executive order it's red linked on drugs it's up on info wars.com as well Texas governor
[2:02:17.640 --> 2:02:23.040]  Abbott issues executive order freeing salon owners Shelly Luther from jail and that means
[2:02:23.040 --> 2:02:28.400]  everybody else now folks we're not being buffaloed by this Texas governor Greg Abbott issued
[2:02:28.400 --> 2:02:33.040]  executive order today retroactively eliminating jail time for citizens who violate the state
[2:02:33.040 --> 2:02:37.160]  state at home rules freeing salon owners Shelly Luther who was jailed for seven days seven
[2:02:37.160 --> 2:02:42.800]  thousand dine for reporting her businesses against court orders reopening Abbott specifically
[2:02:42.800 --> 2:02:48.640]  named Luther in the announcement and again the shutdown is already killing three hundred
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:54.520]  thousand a day the UN says but oh they want money for COVID-19 treatments for people around
[2:02:54.520 --> 2:02:59.400]  the world throwing Texas in jail who have their businesses shut down through no fault
[2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:05.080]  of their own is non essential and I will not allow it to happen this is why I'm modifying
[2:03:05.080 --> 2:03:09.120]  my executive order to ensure that confinement is not punishable for violating the order
[2:03:09.120 --> 2:03:14.720]  this order is retroactive April 2nd supersedes local orders and directly applied should free
[2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:19.280]  Shelly Luther and some county judges advocate for releasing hardened criminals from jail
[2:03:19.280 --> 2:03:23.400]  prevent the spread of COVID-19 is absurd to have these business owners take their place
[2:03:23.400 --> 2:03:28.360]  and you can't say one business is essential and another isn't it's people the people
[2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:35.920]  and the businesses and then it turns out it's a hoax with fake models and now they say we're
[2:03:35.920 --> 2:03:42.080]  never reopening and the world's going into a depression first world collapses we turn
[2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:51.000]  into third world third world dies Owen shroyer is back in the Austin ATX today but Savannah
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:54.720]  Hernandez and Harrison Smith are up there reporting when the lady comes out today we've
[2:03:54.720 --> 2:03:58.000]  already been talking to her family we're gonna get her on the war rooms coming up today at
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:01.720]  3 p.m. Central but Owen was there last night got back early this morning he went to the
[2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:08.480]  judge's house here's that report Owen shroyer here from info wars dot com and I am on my
[2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:17.440]  way to Dallas Texas where there is a rally planned for tonight for Shelly Luther who
[2:04:17.440 --> 2:04:24.440]  has been illegally arrested detained and fined for opening her business and not adhering
[2:04:24.440 --> 2:04:30.440]  to illegal mandates that you have to close your business and stay at home sadly this
[2:04:30.440 --> 2:04:38.280]  is the answer to the tyranny and that's having to be a hero and a legend like Shelly Luther
[2:04:38.280 --> 2:04:44.160]  for daring to stand against this tyranny she's a hero and I'm on my way to show my support
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:49.760]  for her and then all of the info warriors out there support her and we support Americans
[2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:55.480]  right to be essential ladies and gentlemen Owen shroyer here from info wars dot com and
[2:04:55.480 --> 2:05:04.560]  I am outside of the jail where they are illegally holding Shelly Luther illegally the governor
[2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:11.720]  and the attorney general have both demanded the immediate release of Shelly Luther why
[2:05:11.720 --> 2:05:16.800]  are they still holding her have you ever seen this before a governor and an attorney general
[2:05:16.800 --> 2:05:21.440]  both demand immediate release of a woman being illegally held yet she's still behind bars
[2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:25.760]  in the building behind us well the problem is is the judge was enforcing the governor's
[2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:29.720]  order the governor's plan both sides of political pens they should be here themselves right
[2:05:29.720 --> 2:05:35.280]  now going and saying I demand the release of a semi-order free her now Shelly is a no
[2:05:35.280 --> 2:05:43.440]  nonsense person and she is not going to take clay Jenkins like doing some communist crap
[2:05:43.440 --> 2:05:48.400]  she needs to make a living and she that's what she's about she's about helping anybody
[2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:53.440]  that needs help and so I I did this because whenever she got put in jail last night I
[2:05:53.440 --> 2:05:59.320]  said I said I'm not going home we will sit here every single day and annoy the crap out
[2:05:59.320 --> 2:06:04.040]  of the city of Dallas because if she's in jail we're going to be here is everybody ready
[2:06:04.040 --> 2:06:25.680]  to go demand that shelly luther be freed the governor and the attorney general have
[2:06:25.680 --> 2:06:42.800]  both demanded the governor and the attorney general have both demanded the immediate
[2:06:42.800 --> 2:06:51.840]  release of Shelly Luther so so so where do we have to go to get Shelly freed because the
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:56.360]  governor demanded it so what are y'all doing here yeah what why are you guys stopping us
[2:06:56.360 --> 2:07:01.560]  are we a threat we can at least get a statement tonight I will disperse this crowd but can
[2:07:01.560 --> 2:07:14.680]  we at least get a statement as to why she is still in jail so what is that exactly basically
[2:07:14.680 --> 2:07:30.680]  the judge is now responsible for her being illegally held so we're going to leave these
[2:07:30.680 --> 2:07:35.960]  offices alone and we're going to go ask the judge to do his damn job and release Shelly
[2:07:35.960 --> 2:07:39.360]  Johnson so thank you to the officers here tonight all right ladies and gentlemen we're
[2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:49.360]  now going to go pick it the judge's house right now so we are now walking up to the
[2:07:49.360 --> 2:08:12.000]  personal residence about the judge I don't want this to happen I want you to do the
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:21.080]  right thing and release Shelly and apologize for what you've done and these protests are

[2:10:51.640 --> 2:10:56.600]  yards before it knows it's been shot and then it finally dies she said well yeah when I
[2:10:56.600 --> 2:11:00.720]  grew up in Omaha Nebraska one time there was an argument in the street and another man
[2:11:00.720 --> 2:11:05.360]  shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the head had blood pouring out
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:11.200]  a huge hole he was holding it he walked around gibbering coffee nonsense for about 60 seconds
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:16.640]  and then just fell over dead well that's what's gonna happen with our economy it is in cardiac
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:22.760]  arrest this has been done by design and the UN the chai comms the mainstream media orchestrated

[2:13:30.360 --> 2:13:38.200]  your up first what do you think about the situation how are you sir first time caller
[2:13:38.200 --> 2:13:42.240]  and i'm pretty freaked out actually i mean this is a chain reaction i'm i'm just i don't
[2:13:42.240 --> 2:13:46.680]  think the public realizes how hard this is going to hit us well i couldn't agree with
[2:13:46.680 --> 2:13:51.920]  you there sir um the reason i'm calling today i've been listening to you for about six years
[2:13:51.920 --> 2:13:57.360]  now and i appreciate the things you say and you're one of the reasons why i'm so awake
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:03.040]  so thank you for that well thank you what's what's on your mind today well i'm calling
[2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:09.560]  because it's i'm a little concerned about the uh things i'm seeing on the news things
[2:14:09.560 --> 2:14:16.280]  i'm reading uh in regards to law enforcement and some of these law enforcement videos i'm
[2:14:16.280 --> 2:14:23.400]  watching on tv um does not represent most of the law enforcement by most of law enforcement
[2:14:23.400 --> 2:14:28.320]  well yeah there's 340 million people in the country and there's millions of police and
[2:14:28.320 --> 2:14:32.600]  so yeah the media is definitely trying to take the bad examples to try to condition
[2:14:32.600 --> 2:14:39.800]  us that the police state is normal correct and it's not most most of us go to work every
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:45.080]  day just like everybody else most of us go to work you know there is no no you're being
[2:14:45.080 --> 2:14:49.360]  you're a lot of jurisdictions are being given illegal orders right now look at this dallas
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:53.600]  judge he's ordering police to arrest people they don't support that it's the judge it's
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:58.760]  the politicians well and that's correct and what i was getting to is you know if any of
[2:14:58.760 --> 2:15:03.360]  us would get to work and they would give us an illegal order most of us would take the
[2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:08.080]  right upper the firing before we take away somebody's right it just won't happen well
[2:15:08.080 --> 2:15:12.000]  what do you make of the judge the governor tells him to let her loose and he won't do
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:20.600]  it well i can't tell you that's just like judges ignoring trump saying they're above
[2:15:20.600 --> 2:15:25.960]  him it's that's not how it works in my jurisdiction we have good judges and bad judges by that
[2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:30.160]  i mean you know their law abiding but they they let their own opinions get away the
[2:15:30.160 --> 2:15:36.520]  law and by that i mean you know we go out and enforce these laws and when we go to court
[2:15:36.520 --> 2:15:43.000]  the judge will let their own personal opinion affect the outcome of the the trial and you
[2:15:43.000 --> 2:15:46.000]  know sometimes the law enforcement allows we stand in front of the judge and we just
[2:15:46.000 --> 2:15:50.840]  shake our heads like you know what else do you want us to do no where do you think this
[2:15:50.840 --> 2:15:55.720]  is all where do you think this is all going i mean if we don't end the lockdown it's going
[2:15:55.720 --> 2:16:01.880]  to be total collapse of civilization it already is correct i i i think that's where it's going
[2:16:01.880 --> 2:16:06.880]  i think the best thing we can do now is keep doing what we're doing open up more and more
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:11.960]  people's eyes i've been listening to you for six years i've never called today i called
[2:16:11.960 --> 2:16:17.100]  and i called because of the things i'm seeing on the news i don't want people to start looking
[2:16:17.100 --> 2:16:20.560]  negatively on law enforcement as if we're going to take every order we're given it's
[2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:25.400]  just not going to happen that's where we're coming down to because but the deep state's
[2:16:25.400 --> 2:16:29.920]  doing is illegal and they're trying to say it's through law it's not and i think they
[2:16:29.920 --> 2:16:33.080]  bitten off more than they could chew i think alan keys ambassador keys was right a few
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:35.920]  days ago and he said just because the globalists have attacked doesn't mean they're going to
[2:16:35.920 --> 2:16:40.560]  win we're going to counter strike politically god bless you michael be safe let's talk to
[2:16:40.560 --> 2:16:44.760]  the police are the ones that got to really worry when stuff collapses i don't want your
[2:16:44.760 --> 2:16:50.480]  job i tell you uh john and maryland you're on the air what do you think of hollywood
[2:16:50.480 --> 2:16:57.200]  openly coming out and celebrating the collapse i think that hollywood obviously they have
[2:16:57.200 --> 2:17:04.880]  a lot of communist tendencies but if you if you study my generation 30 and younger the
[2:17:04.880 --> 2:17:11.960]  the rappers that used to be in the late 80s they weren't like muslims and stuff like that
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:17.040]  but if you listen to rap music nowadays there's like chronic lyrics in it very anti-woman
[2:17:17.040 --> 2:17:21.760]  you listen to some of the music it's very anti-semitic why hollywood would put up with
[2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:24.920]  that they wouldn't put up with that from a white christian guy so why are they best
[2:17:24.920 --> 2:17:31.560]  friends all of a sudden well you know it's it's it's hard to say but like you uh have
[2:17:31.560 --> 2:17:39.280]  mentioned the um a few times from like the 60s and 70s the science fiction and the um
[2:17:39.280 --> 2:17:45.640]  the other cultural pop icons from back in those days that that created um the short
[2:17:45.640 --> 2:17:51.160]  stories like um electric sheet counting electric do electric sheet count or whatever i can't
[2:17:51.160 --> 2:17:56.600]  know pkd um yeah that's where they got the name for like google chrome like burning chrome
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:18:01.840]  and other short stories it's a classic science fiction novel from back in the day it's got
[2:18:01.840 --> 2:18:07.080]  johnny new monarch in it which later went on to become um like a merchant in the matrix
[2:18:07.080 --> 2:18:11.480]  and and stuff like that i think believe burning chrome is actually like the prequel to the
[2:18:11.480 --> 2:18:17.480]  matrix before the matrix even came out anyway hollywood like kids these days are listening
[2:18:17.480 --> 2:18:22.800]  to marvel movies and stuff hollywood came out with all this stuff that like the technocratic
[2:18:22.800 --> 2:18:28.160]  elites are going to run the world and that's these guys when they were 10 20 years old
[2:18:28.160 --> 2:18:33.040]  and they started reading comic books and all this stuff they became conditioned to this
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:40.800]  and um they really believe it just the same as like someone cosplays as captain america
[2:18:40.800 --> 2:18:45.320]  they really have the same they're same fun about it but it's deeper than that my friend
[2:18:45.320 --> 2:18:51.360]  the the the science fiction societies were actually a luminous they were pre-programming
[2:18:51.360 --> 2:18:54.920]  that the next generations to actually carry this out because they know humans are master
[2:18:54.920 --> 2:19:00.200]  builders so we build what we envision so they programmed us with the dystopia to then build
[2:19:00.200 --> 2:19:04.160]  it that's why it mirrors it so it's not just that oh they happen to read this stuff and
[2:19:04.160 --> 2:19:07.920]  then happen to want to build it they were told and given the blueprints to build it
[2:19:07.920 --> 2:19:15.920]  hey that makes perfectly sense perfect sense believe me brother i know about it oh it seems
[2:19:15.920 --> 2:19:20.240]  some of the connection in fact i'm going to segue into this so you know why does hollywood
[2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:23.800]  and the politicians and all these corporate elites and the school systems all sound the
[2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:31.160]  same well taking the general flin um case i can connect hollywood to general flin in
[2:19:31.160 --> 2:19:36.880]  like 10 seconds or less the law firm he worked for is a law firm that i work or the law firm
[2:19:36.880 --> 2:19:42.200]  that he had representing him yeah he thought because he was a democrat previously and because
[2:19:42.200 --> 2:19:45.920]  he was nice they would get him out of it even though he didn't do anything and his own law
[2:19:45.920 --> 2:19:54.000]  firm burned him well i i used to work for that law firm there's um katar airways is
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:59.400]  in the same building the nfl is in the same building uh the american health care associate
[2:19:59.400 --> 2:20:02.360]  is in the same building look there are a bunch of globalists have chips on their shoulders
[2:20:02.360 --> 2:20:07.600]  against america and their religion is hating america because our ethos was christian and
[2:20:07.600 --> 2:20:14.440]  it's a satanic system god bless you now we've got a special guest joining us for two segments
[2:20:14.440 --> 2:20:18.720]  brian rose had one of the biggest streams ever over a million plus people on his own

[2:22:39.240 --> 2:22:47.840]  store.com I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and
[2:22:47.840 --> 2:22:52.680]  when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards even if you hit them right in the heart they'll
[2:22:52.680 --> 2:23:00.960]  still run 50 60 70 maybe 100 yards they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries
[2:23:00.960 --> 2:23:05.440]  and through their veins but all of a sudden they slow down they realize what's happened
[2:23:05.440 --> 2:23:11.400]  they fall over and they die then you go bag them and haul them back in well that's what's
[2:23:11.400 --> 2:23:17.520]  going to happen to the entire world now and that's what the economic numbers show is that
[2:23:17.520 --> 2:23:22.440]  we've been shot right in the heart and for the first world it's going to mean a long
[2:23:22.440 --> 2:23:27.040]  horrible depression and a lot of death well for the third world it's going to mean probably
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:30.520]  over a hundred million debt according to you and I believe their numbers because it's the
[2:23:30.520 --> 2:23:35.920]  very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world so that all the leftists that
[2:23:35.920 --> 2:23:39.200]  thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump you're a bunch of suckers and you've
[2:23:39.200 --> 2:23:44.240]  bought into something better than what Hitler did ladies and gentlemen info wars can now
[2:23:44.240 --> 2:23:50.880]  offer high quality storeable food again other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago
[2:23:50.880 --> 2:23:56.480]  and they told people they had food most folks never would deliver their food well when our
[2:23:56.480 --> 2:24:02.640]  sponsors food began to run short they just spent sales till they opened more factories
[2:24:02.640 --> 2:24:07.960]  and secured more food so if you get orders in right now they can take new orders and
[2:24:07.960 --> 2:24:13.680]  get it to you quickly they'll probably have to suspend orders very very soon again because
[2:24:13.680 --> 2:24:18.600]  the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution farming you name it and now it's
[2:24:18.600 --> 2:24:24.120]  mainstream news the food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen if Trump can
[2:24:24.120 --> 2:24:29.400]  turn the economy back on and rest control of our system away from the globalist things
[2:24:29.400 --> 2:24:34.120]  may be okay but it looks like it's going to get very very rough so again ladies and gentlemen
[2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:38.080]  now is the time to secure the number one thing you need high quality storeable food ready
[2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:45.680]  to get to you and your family now if you get your orders in then four store dot com you're
[2:24:45.680 --> 2:25:11.300]  listening to the alex jones show from the front lines of the information war it's alex
[2:25:11.300 --> 2:25:16.800]  jones you know there are more resources per capita in mexico than there are in the united
[2:25:16.800 --> 2:25:21.920]  states the more resources in venezuela in many ways that are on the United States plus
[2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:28.440]  the united states is barren wastelands why then such a small area geographically compared
[2:25:28.440 --> 2:25:32.480]  other parts of the world such a small population compare their parts of the world how did we
[2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:39.880]  have half world's wealth by 1950 4% of the world's population 96% more people in the
[2:25:39.880 --> 2:25:44.880]  rest of the world 4% had over half the wealth it was because we had freedom compared to
[2:25:44.880 --> 2:25:50.880]  other nations we had freedom of speech freedom to contract freedom to own things our taxes
[2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:57.280]  were much lower in other areas of the world or feudalism under crony capitalism under
[2:25:57.280 --> 2:26:02.400]  communism and socialism you have an elite that keep everybody else down they don't
[2:26:02.400 --> 2:26:07.160]  want innovation they don't want competition and they they reward their sons their daughters
[2:26:07.160 --> 2:26:13.000]  with the positions of power and those societies become stagnant and full we have a new royalty
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:20.840]  big tech and you have page and you have brend coming out of one out of the soviet union
[2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:26.600]  one out of the united states and setting up a tyranny of google and you have zuckerberg
[2:26:26.600 --> 2:26:33.680]  and all these other people and the individual that heads up twitter jack dorsi all creating
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:38.160]  horrible authoritarian censorship systems were now even medical doctors that have five
[2:26:38.160 --> 2:26:43.360]  million views and are putting out real statistics are deleted because they say the death toll
[2:26:43.360 --> 2:26:48.840]  from shutting down society will be much greater than covid-19 but now the south african government
[2:26:48.840 --> 2:26:53.840]  and major insurance companies came out and said the death toll is 29 times in south africa
[2:26:53.840 --> 2:26:58.980]  from the lockdown what covid-19 is but still we're told as bill gates smiles we can never
[2:26:58.980 --> 2:27:08.320]  open again and hollywood puts out a letter 200 quote stars saying it's good to save
[2:27:08.320 --> 2:27:12.800]  the earth to cut the carbon well how do you counter this well it's called courage two
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:16.480]  years ago when i got banned off almost every platform people said how are you taking it
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:22.040]  you know i said well you watch i'm lucky i'm banned up front by the time they ban you no
[2:27:22.040 --> 2:27:25.440]  one was even going to care because we're going to be conditioned to accept it well when it
[2:27:25.440 --> 2:27:29.520]  came to david ike being banned on facebook and twitter and youtube and everywhere else
[2:27:29.520 --> 2:27:34.000]  it was because he had two mega successful interviews with brian rose was already very
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:38.240]  successful been doing a podcast tv show for eight years got out of banking but the reason
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:41.520]  we've got him on for two short segments today is because it's not about us crawling about
[2:27:41.520 --> 2:27:46.840]  successes it's about crawling about victories as a blueprint for others that when they were
[2:27:46.840 --> 2:27:50.880]  starting to censor and ban him on platforms because he was having david ike and myself
[2:27:50.880 --> 2:27:56.720]  and others on he doubled down set up his own platform quickly and it exploded because you
[2:27:56.720 --> 2:28:01.200]  got interested and excited so it's about that dynamism and that connection between we the
[2:28:01.200 --> 2:28:06.000]  people and our desire for freedom and innovation that's the answer to these tyrants because
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:12.360]  america may be overrun and globalist now but freedom in 1776 lives in our own hearts and
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:16.480]  he does london real from london a great international city but as he said one time on the show it
[2:28:16.480 --> 2:28:20.400]  took an america to do it so to talk about that success in this segment and then about the
[2:28:20.400 --> 2:28:25.520]  big picture in the next london real dot tv brian rose joins us to look at this blueprint
[2:28:25.520 --> 2:28:29.240]  of victory you wanted to hit a million you hit one million three hundred and thirty six
[2:28:29.240 --> 2:28:33.200]  thousand one hundred and thirty eight people every one of them super important and your
[2:28:33.200 --> 2:28:39.840]  success is my success my success is your success our success is all together and i'm so excited
[2:28:39.840 --> 2:28:46.440]  for you and all of us that made this a success brian alex you know the people have spoken
[2:28:46.440 --> 2:28:51.040]  and they have said loud and clear that they want their freedom back we had an epic day
[2:28:51.040 --> 2:28:56.960]  on sunday it was the largest live stream of a conversation in human history and look i
[2:28:56.960 --> 2:29:00.920]  stood at the plate just like babe ruth and i pointed my finger into the stands and i
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:06.160]  said we're gonna have a million people streaming not on a trillion dollar technology platform
[2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:11.080]  but on our own site that we created in ten days with the help of twenty five thousand
[2:29:11.080 --> 2:29:16.120]  people called the london real army we raised a million dollars alex in this economy to put
[2:29:16.120 --> 2:29:21.080]  this stream on and we delivered one million three hundred and sixty six thousand unique
[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:25.500]  users we are submitting this to the guiness book of world records and here's the other
[2:29:25.500 --> 2:29:30.360]  headline alex two-thirds of those people was from peer to peer sharing just think about
[2:29:30.360 --> 2:29:35.280]  it people telling their friends not getting it from any major platform and it was three
[2:29:35.280 --> 2:29:39.560]  hours long i think you watch it alex it was it was just truly epic and you know i was
[2:29:39.560 --> 2:29:44.640]  just honored to be a part of it again even bigger than the content which was over the
[2:29:44.640 --> 2:29:50.800]  top good it shows the desire of the people how they word of mouth took action even though
[2:29:50.800 --> 2:29:55.000]  all the big platforms were trying to block the spread of this people did it person to
[2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:58.840]  person and i walked in that afternoon after i watched at the office i was working late
[2:29:58.840 --> 2:30:02.880]  that day and my wife again had it on while she was cooking dinner watching the restream
[2:30:02.880 --> 2:30:09.920]  of it that is so beautiful and again that's what these globalists fear yeah i mean they've
[2:30:09.920 --> 2:30:14.400]  really tried everything to stop it you know alex but we made it happen it was not easy
[2:30:14.400 --> 2:30:18.200]  to do but we had the funding we actually got the same guys that live streamed the super
[2:30:18.200 --> 2:30:23.840]  bowl last year and we crank this thing up to the max and it just delivered and really
[2:30:23.840 --> 2:30:28.600]  the content delivered as well i've got people stopping me in the street from young kids
[2:30:28.600 --> 2:30:32.800]  up to older people and they're saying that this was important information they're not
[2:30:32.800 --> 2:30:37.800]  getting they want it they want to hear these conversations alex they trust in their gut
[2:30:37.800 --> 2:30:41.080]  that they're not getting all the information and they're looking to alternative sources
[2:30:41.080 --> 2:30:45.440]  and of course the mainstream media is still attacking us i'm playing reindeer games with
[2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:49.280]  some of these tech platforms we all know how that's going to end but you know i've seen
[2:30:49.280 --> 2:30:52.840]  the light alex i've seen the light at the end of this tunnel and we're going to do it
[2:30:52.840 --> 2:30:59.600]  ourselves with the people behind us and it's exciting it's really exciting it is exciting
[2:30:59.600 --> 2:31:04.520]  talk about the persecution and what came with this though for people just to get an idea
[2:31:04.520 --> 2:31:08.520]  of what they did to you today but others i know they artificially took half your subscribers
[2:31:08.520 --> 2:31:14.000]  away on youtube as a as a punishment they banned david everywhere and then i see these articles
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:18.640]  other quote journalists rubbing their hands together going oh yes it's so good to silence
[2:31:18.640 --> 2:31:23.520]  these evil people i saw john ronston climbing off from under a rock saying oh yes jones is
[2:31:23.520 --> 2:31:27.520]  nothing now that we we'd be platforming that's total crap these guys are legends in their
[2:31:27.520 --> 2:31:33.320]  own minds yeah i mean some people don't remember i mean about three or four weeks ago we streamed
[2:31:33.320 --> 2:31:38.280]  rosaik 2 which was the second in the trilogy you know on the day it was the second largest
[2:31:38.280 --> 2:31:42.600]  live stream in the world 30 minutes later the video was banned and deleted we thought
[2:31:42.600 --> 2:31:47.240]  that would have gone on to be watched 40 million times the biggest video podcast in history
[2:31:47.240 --> 2:31:52.240]  and it was suppressed and again the next few weeks everything about my channel was suppressed
[2:31:52.240 --> 2:31:57.840]  and then two days before this epic broadcast last sunday david ike was deplatformed and
[2:31:57.840 --> 2:32:04.440]  deleted from facebook 24 hours later deplatformed and deleted from youtube and so we were going
[2:32:04.440 --> 2:32:09.880]  into this with just so many things against us mainstream media pushing back offcom here
[2:32:09.880 --> 2:32:14.840]  in the uk trying to stop it and look you know we had to make a few moves we pretended it
[2:32:14.840 --> 2:32:19.000]  was going to happen somewhere else we brought david through the the basement entrance we
[2:32:19.000 --> 2:32:22.720]  just didn't know the forces that would want to stop this but you know the people wanted
[2:32:22.720 --> 2:32:28.120]  it to happen and it was incredible and this is just the start the digital freedom platform
[2:32:28.120 --> 2:32:33.040]  is now real and we followed it up with subsequent broadcasts and we are basically using it every
[2:32:33.040 --> 2:32:38.520]  single day to produce uncensored content and that alex that the conversations change because
[2:32:38.520 --> 2:32:42.040]  when people know what they're about to say isn't going to be banned or deleted or get
[2:32:42.040 --> 2:32:46.800]  them in trouble we're having conversations i've never had before and this is this is
[2:32:46.800 --> 2:32:51.680]  what freedom really is well one thing you're going to run into next is they even have
[2:32:51.680 --> 2:32:56.920]  operatives inside the big streaming companies so that not even the company officially kicks
[2:32:56.920 --> 2:33:01.320]  you off they have left us inside companies we've learned our streamings been down because
[2:33:01.320 --> 2:33:05.600]  of actual sabotage the last week and and now we've learned that that's going we're
[2:33:05.600 --> 2:33:10.520]  having to migrate services over so this war is getting so intense right now and they are
[2:33:10.520 --> 2:33:14.040]  just doing everything they can to keep us silent because we're telling the truth and
[2:33:14.040 --> 2:33:18.520]  it's powerful and we're winning yeah and let me tell you a quick story with that we had
[2:33:18.520 --> 2:33:24.280]  another silicone valley company i'm just going to say it it was jw player had completely agreed
[2:33:24.280 --> 2:33:28.400]  you know we had basically cut the check for six figures friday night the ceo calls us
[2:33:28.400 --> 2:33:34.080]  and says nope we cannot play ball with you we are going to drop you and we had to completely
[2:33:34.080 --> 2:33:38.600]  find a new platform on saturday now imagine america you've got money you're doing this
[2:33:38.600 --> 2:33:45.440]  it's a famous guy he's not even saying cuss words but then it's it's it's everywhere yeah
[2:33:45.440 --> 2:33:47.920]  and that's what we're going to have to look out for going forward we're going to have
[2:33:47.920 --> 2:33:51.920]  to be careful of every platform just like you alex and now we're trying to push further
[2:33:51.920 --> 2:33:56.800]  now it's all about the digital freedom fund we've raised money now to go after them legally
[2:33:56.800 --> 2:34:01.240]  we've got people here we think we have a precedent of private private companies acting like public
[2:34:01.240 --> 2:34:05.880]  utilities and we're going after them alex we need to bite back here and show them that
[2:34:05.880 --> 2:34:10.560]  i'm just not some youtuber that's waiting for a revenue stream this is the opposite we're
[2:34:10.560 --> 2:34:14.440]  going to fight to get this content replatform that's our next mission that's right let's
[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:18.960]  talk about that when we come back going on the offense because if more content providers
[2:34:18.960 --> 2:34:24.760]  left youtube or set their own thing up it'd be over for them did you see the head of content
[2:34:24.760 --> 2:34:28.680]  for youtube come out and call us basement dwellers and say we're all scum and they don't need
[2:34:28.680 --> 2:34:34.040]  us did you see that i missed that i can't wait to see it you guys pull up watson's article
[2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:37.400]  about it or print me that article from two days ago one of the head youtube guys said
[2:34:37.400 --> 2:34:41.080]  i'll screw them we don't need the public youtube said they don't need you they don't
[2:34:41.080 --> 2:34:45.040]  want you one of our best selling products is living defense and it's been sold out for
[2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:49.160]  over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic we've got
[2:34:49.160 --> 2:34:52.680]  a limited supply right now but it's selling out fast and i want those of you that haven't
[2:34:52.680 --> 2:34:57.080]  experienced living defense to get it for yourself here just part of one testimonial i looked
[2:34:57.080 --> 2:35:01.880]  in january 2016 i went in a hospital i went in the va hospital out here in boyston i was
[2:35:01.880 --> 2:35:06.240]  in there until june and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening
[2:35:06.240 --> 2:35:11.600]  to info wars three hours a day and i kept hearing dr group and all you guys talking about living
[2:35:11.600 --> 2:35:16.320]  defense let me tell you something i had an internal digestive problem and i stumbled
[2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:20.640]  with it for about five or six years and the doctors they tried every time nobody could
[2:35:20.640 --> 2:35:24.280]  figure out what it is and then every day when i kept hearing you and dr group and those
[2:35:24.280 --> 2:35:27.680]  commercials i said you know what i'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:30.880]  now i wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have it but
[2:35:30.880 --> 2:35:35.200]  i ordered it had it shipped to me i got it i hid it from the nurses i started taking
[2:35:35.200 --> 2:35:40.760]  it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life alex jones and info wars saved my
[2:35:40.760 --> 2:35:46.160]  life the panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chai
[2:35:46.160 --> 2:35:53.280]  comms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression in fact we're already into the worldwide
[2:35:53.280 --> 2:35:57.920]  depression in the death sentence for the third world but it's critical to understand that
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:04.000]  the longer the shutdown persists the worse it's going to be a month of shutdown will
[2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:08.880]  destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy that's what we always
[2:36:08.880 --> 2:36:13.440]  said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists
[2:36:13.440 --> 2:36:18.600]  want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control they've admitted all of
[2:36:18.600 --> 2:36:25.200]  this so remember how does info wars continue years and decades in many cases to be able
[2:36:25.200 --> 2:36:30.120]  to predict things before they happen because we're following the globalist blueprint and
[2:36:30.120 --> 2:36:35.080]  their battle plan and yes it's dystopic and yes it's scary but denying it and letting
[2:36:35.080 --> 2:36:40.120]  them carry it out is a thousand times more scary it's time to stop the denial and realize
[2:36:40.120 --> 2:36:47.000]  what's really happening the superpower that i have is that i tell you what i really think
[2:36:47.000 --> 2:36:50.760]  even if it ends up hurting me short term i believe in god and i believe in the long run
[2:36:50.760 --> 2:36:54.760]  it'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together
[2:36:54.760 --> 2:36:59.080]  in i understand what comes around goes around you read what you show and i live that and
[2:36:59.080 --> 2:37:03.960]  i fundamentally the cellular level understand it now if i would have hyped up the virus
[2:37:03.960 --> 2:37:08.360]  was going to kill three four five million people like the un did i would have sold five times
[2:37:08.360 --> 2:37:13.960]  more supplements but you know what i didn't do that but i said on a routine basis regardless
[2:37:13.960 --> 2:37:18.840]  people are vitamin d deficient people are deficient i had i had so many other issues
[2:37:18.840 --> 2:37:24.280]  you need those products regardless so we started selling out of vital mineral fusion all the
[2:37:24.280 --> 2:37:30.680]  products i cut the prices from 30 percent off to 60 percent off because i knew it was the right
[2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:36.680]  thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their body's offenses
[2:37:36.680 --> 2:37:40.680]  but now i'm telling you with the economic crisis going on get your storeable food now
[2:37:42.600 --> 2:37:49.400]  the lockdown is permanent dictatorship the lockdown is designed to have the public accept
[2:37:49.400 --> 2:37:56.520]  their basic rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the w a show
[2:37:56.520 --> 2:38:02.920]  and the bill melinda gates foundation in full control many will submit through fear others
[2:38:02.920 --> 2:38:09.880]  will be bought off but in the end the globalists admit they're building a post human world and
[2:38:09.880 --> 2:38:17.240]  now that we're inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly into its end game submission to
[2:38:17.240 --> 2:38:25.000]  this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living
[2:38:25.000 --> 2:38:31.720]  hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this this is your dignity your soul
[2:38:31.720 --> 2:38:38.280]  your future being poured inside out this is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of
[2:38:38.280 --> 2:38:54.200]  humanity for its own selfless disgusting power trip you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:38:54.200 --> 2:38:56.200]  you
[2:39:06.760 --> 2:39:11.400]  brian rose is here with us i'm alex jones will take a few calls after he leaves us in 10 minutes
[2:39:11.400 --> 2:39:17.240]  and then jason jones is going to come in with a special report and a few guests
[2:39:17.240 --> 2:39:25.720]  i'm your host alex jones brian rose is a smart guy and he's got i've been watching the show
[2:39:25.720 --> 2:39:30.360]  for years but what i really like was the courage that he got excited when they tried to shut him
[2:39:30.360 --> 2:39:35.720]  up and intimidate him and he didn't just fight he fought and win it's like the man in the arena
[2:39:35.720 --> 2:39:39.960]  today roosevelt's speech that the man that knows great triumph you know the great energy
[2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:44.760]  you pour into it and you know at best at least knows that you strive even even if you're defeated
[2:39:44.760 --> 2:39:49.560]  to paraphrase well he's like bay bruce telling him where the home runs going and he just did it
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:53.480]  and that's because of all of you and all of us together but you've got to have the focal point
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:59.160]  who's already built the platform who's in the crucible in the crosshairs and at the right moment
[2:39:59.160 --> 2:40:04.120]  when the stars align then pulls the trigger and you know i like joe rogan we talk quite a bit
[2:40:04.120 --> 2:40:09.000]  he's a friend of mine i respect him no he's really smart but i do get mad at joe because
[2:40:09.000 --> 2:40:14.920]  joe wants to try to quote play it safe but playing it safe in the aggregate is what's
[2:40:14.920 --> 2:40:18.760]  going to bring everything down the globalists aren't playing it safe they're going for total
[2:40:18.760 --> 2:40:23.880]  power and control so we have to say damn the torpedoes and go straight at him somebody like
[2:40:23.880 --> 2:40:29.160]  joe rogan could change the whole face of the internet and defeat these people very quickly
[2:40:29.160 --> 2:40:35.160]  with the right speech he's got the skills the platform the background everything right there
[2:40:35.160 --> 2:40:41.400]  but it's seen as really intelligent to quote play it safe when all of civilization is collapsing
[2:40:41.400 --> 2:40:46.840]  and i'm not even criticizing joe that's his decision but ryan rose what was the decision
[2:40:46.840 --> 2:40:50.680]  making process because i was talking to you off here three weeks ago not even knowing you're
[2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:54.200]  about to do this and i'm like you got to go in for everything you got to go on the attack
[2:40:54.200 --> 2:40:56.520]  that's mine you're like well don't worry that's what i'm already planning and you told me what
[2:40:56.520 --> 2:41:01.080]  you were planning was there a thought process in this or did you just know gut level was the
[2:41:01.080 --> 2:41:06.280]  right thing to do to say go ahead and de-platform me everywhere i'm going to say damn the torpedoes
[2:41:06.280 --> 2:41:12.920]  go straight at him well you know alex when this whole coronavirus madness started i made a conscious
[2:41:12.920 --> 2:41:17.160]  decision that i was going to expand and not contract in this environment i've been through
[2:41:17.160 --> 2:41:22.200]  crises before i was at i was in new york city for 9 11 i've been through the financial crisis
[2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:26.920]  and i know how a lot of people react and i was i was determined to act the opposite so my mindset
[2:41:26.920 --> 2:41:32.200]  was already there and when we were banned on icke as we spoke about before my initial reaction
[2:41:32.200 --> 2:41:39.640]  from my lizard brain was to just fight back say no we're not taking this and luckily i found a
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:43.640]  massive support structure out there that we call the london real army we spoke as well and you
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:48.040]  said brine you've got to ask for help which is something i've never done before i'm a proud man
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:53.560]  i always try to do it myself but i couldn't do this myself and rallied behind by these people
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:59.960]  the funds the sharing and we went in and we just pulled this thing off and i mean honestly alex
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:04.120]  you're a model you know i've seen what you've done without these platforms and you're giving us the
[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:09.240]  courage to follow in your footsteps and just say you know what there are other ways and i think
[2:42:09.240 --> 2:42:13.960]  people are getting hip to the fact that we don't need these platforms as much as they would like
[2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:18.360]  us to think that we need them what we do need is the listeners that are active as standing with
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:23.240]  us someone explain this you've got courage i've got courage david has courage but it's like electricity
[2:42:23.240 --> 2:42:28.440]  being able to have like wire to go down if the public doesn't resonate and support nothing happens
[2:42:28.440 --> 2:42:33.400]  when they do so so i well i mean i'm really proud of this uh because i thought you were already
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:36.920]  basically thinking of that i remember pushing you you've got to raise money you've got to build
[2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:41.400]  infrastructure and you were already doing that but but i'm that's great that you're saying it was
[2:42:41.400 --> 2:42:46.440]  critical my encouragement to actually do this oh very much so i mean like i said i'm not one that
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:51.320]  is ever asked for help i never asked for a single donation in nine nine years but there was no way i
[2:42:51.320 --> 2:42:56.600]  could have done this myself from so many ways not financially but also like i said two thirds of our
[2:42:56.600 --> 2:43:00.920]  audience was peer to peer share so we would have never had one point right i want to be clear though
[2:43:00.920 --> 2:43:06.440]  you didn't ask them for help you're a soldier that shown you have courage they want to provision you
[2:43:06.440 --> 2:43:11.160]  with what you need to carry the fight that they they don't see it as support brother they want to
[2:43:11.160 --> 2:43:16.200]  carry you into war do you see that yeah you're right alex you're right i mean they see action
[2:43:16.200 --> 2:43:20.920]  that resonates with them and they want to follow and that was my gut reaction it still is i still
[2:43:20.920 --> 2:43:26.440]  want to charge into the gunfire right now and you know it's it's still hairy out there these
[2:43:26.440 --> 2:43:31.560]  platforms are still coming after us playing all sorts of reindeer games behind in the background
[2:43:31.560 --> 2:43:36.600]  but again you're the blueprint alex we're trusting the process and this was the final message
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:42.840]  that david icad on sunday he said look act out of unconditional love do the right thing that your
[2:43:42.840 --> 2:43:47.800]  heart tells you to do and move forward you're always going to be proud of that decision and
[2:43:47.800 --> 2:43:53.160]  the right thing will happen even though the fear holds most people back and the pandemic is a great
[2:43:53.160 --> 2:43:57.880]  example of that the fear is making people play small and if we push through that we're going to do
[2:43:57.880 --> 2:44:03.000]  things we're proud of we can tell our children and our grandchildren what we did in 2020 and i'm
[2:44:03.000 --> 2:44:07.560]  trusting that whole process and alex you're all about that as well you trust your instinct you go
[2:44:07.560 --> 2:44:11.480]  forward with your heart and let the chips fall where they may and that's what we're in the process
[2:44:11.480 --> 2:44:15.160]  of doing well i've never seen david get so emotional he can usually hold it together with
[2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:20.040]  the stuff up her love but he started crying there at the end well i mean that's the thing you know
[2:44:20.040 --> 2:44:25.080]  the globalists want him to come out that out of the very end and and tell people to burn 5g towers
[2:44:25.080 --> 2:44:31.400]  or tell people to go to violence and instead he says go into your heart use unconditional love
[2:44:31.400 --> 2:44:36.120]  to extinguish fear and and they don't know what to do with that because they they can't attack it
[2:44:36.120 --> 2:44:41.960]  they can't vilify it and literally i heard people walking around london talking about that love
[2:44:41.960 --> 2:44:45.640]  message that's what's been resonating through the community and then of course the mainstream
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:50.120]  media then goes in and does their attacks but if you watch that thing for three hours there's one
[2:44:50.120 --> 2:44:55.960]  message there and that is an empowering human message that love is the answer go with your heart
[2:44:55.960 --> 2:45:00.520]  do the right thing well there's a union to all of this and i'm on the air four hours a day or more
[2:45:00.520 --> 2:45:04.840]  and i i don't want to say i've made mistakes but i tend to get in the dark place when i'm watching
[2:45:04.840 --> 2:45:12.040]  hundreds of millions set to starve to death and i did my whole modest person modest proposal deal
[2:45:12.040 --> 2:45:16.360]  and they took it out of context to make it sound like i'm this raving hateful mean person and then
[2:45:16.360 --> 2:45:20.360]  i also say things like go after the communist chinese agents and i'm talking about i'm talking
[2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:24.760]  to trump about that because i want our warriors to protect the innocent people but you're right
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:29.240]  love is the answer i don't want any violence and i don't want any of our listeners to be
[2:45:29.240 --> 2:45:35.480]  offensively violent i want them with love to stand up with justice and freedom and explain to people
[2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:40.840]  what this whole covet hoax is what this takedown is and the fact that it's an attack on civilization
[2:45:42.600 --> 2:45:46.120]  yeah very much so we're all about education is the process and that's what the people in the
[2:45:46.120 --> 2:45:50.360]  streets are telling me that they want and look we haven't stopped you know since sunday we've
[2:45:50.360 --> 2:45:55.800]  continued to broadcast and put out you know very controversial messages uh people talking about
[2:45:55.800 --> 2:46:01.160]  the vaccine agenda people talking about uh the chinese governments you know had general spalding
[2:46:01.160 --> 2:46:05.640]  on last night saying that they were complicit in the spread and again all of these things are going
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:10.280]  to be banned on these trillion dollar technology platforms we have to use the talk about general
[2:46:10.280 --> 2:46:15.000]  spalding he's come out and said we're in an asymmetrical 21st century war with china and there's
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:20.680]  a fifth column in the u.s. oh it was incredible listening to him and this is a man who spent
[2:46:20.680 --> 2:46:25.080]  many many years in china fell in love with the people but he can see exactly what that
[2:46:25.080 --> 2:46:29.400]  totalitarian government is doing and he made a great parallel he said technology companies and
[2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:33.720]  totalitarian totalitarian governments are the same they have the same agenda and it was amazing
[2:46:33.720 --> 2:46:38.920]  talking to him and he specifically said that the government knew on january 7th exactly what was
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:44.440]  going on and they allowed the virus to spread and they were doing it so it would hinder other
[2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:49.160]  countries around the world but that whole plan probably backfired on him and he went on to talk
[2:46:49.160 --> 2:46:54.040]  about all the other six front war that they're conducting against us it was eye-opening from a
[2:46:54.040 --> 2:46:58.680]  man who's really been on the inside so we're continuing to put these messages out there
[2:46:58.680 --> 2:47:03.240]  and it's important information and that's what's beautiful as they've made me so radioactive by
[2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:07.560]  design that a lot of folks haven't talked to spalding yet are scared to come on that's fine
[2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:11.560]  because you do a better interview than i do and you've got a huge audience and i just love
[2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:15.800]  watching them try to silence everybody and i wouldn't say you were mainline you're a self-help
[2:47:15.800 --> 2:47:20.600]  guy and had a lot of diverse guests on and cover freedom but now they're tyranny it seems like has
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:25.320]  forced you oh you want me to shut up i'll be even more hardcore and now you're exploding even faster
[2:47:25.320 --> 2:47:30.440]  and it's just a good feeling in this dark time this war to see so many other beautiful souls
[2:47:30.440 --> 2:47:36.680]  stand up and i'm seeing all these other filmmakers now like doctors in black and all these things
[2:47:36.680 --> 2:47:41.720]  exposing the agenda it's like humanity's really standing up and showing its strength because
[2:47:41.720 --> 2:47:46.360]  as the bible says when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord lives up a standard
[2:47:46.360 --> 2:47:51.720]  against it and all of us are that standard of love and justice here's what uh david ike had to say
[2:47:51.720 --> 2:47:56.760]  he spent 30 minutes on love i'm gonna show love but here's a little piece of that limitation i'm
[2:47:56.760 --> 2:48:05.000]  powerless poor me little me the cult gotcha when you open this i'm all that is has been and ever
[2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:12.760]  can be having an experience and i'm not gonna let some little prat in a dark suit dictate my life
[2:48:12.760 --> 2:48:18.760]  thank you very much that ain't having it david i want to live in this world where everyone opens
[2:48:18.760 --> 2:48:22.840]  up their heart i want to be in this place it sounds like an incredible place it is an incredible
[2:48:22.840 --> 2:48:27.720]  place solve all of these immediate problems in a matter of hours if everybody could do that
[2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:39.000]  that is the problem that is the solution absolutely folks you have to open up and god's
[2:48:39.000 --> 2:48:44.600]  there like electricity but you have to open up and then it's there ryan rose londonreal.tv thank
[2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:49.480]  you so much for the time my friend alex i appreciate you again you laid the roadmap you
[2:48:49.480 --> 2:48:52.760]  know you are showing us how to do this stuff and how we don't have to live in fear to these

[2:49:17.480 --> 2:49:22.040]  the opposite of the hollywood folks saying yay the world's starving to death it's good for earth
[2:49:22.040 --> 2:49:27.880]  i'll listen to robert deniro and madonna and all of them when they kill themselves first you go
[2:49:27.880 --> 2:49:36.440]  first there's my love info wars has become a symbol an emblem of not just american freedom
[2:49:36.440 --> 2:49:43.000]  but worldwide maverick spirit it's not just myself or the host of info wars or the researchers
[2:49:43.000 --> 2:49:48.120]  or the journalist it's you the listeners the activists the people on the front lines in the
[2:49:48.120 --> 2:49:54.440]  arena and it's the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make info wars so special
[2:49:54.440 --> 2:49:59.880]  because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds we're having an open discussion about the
[2:49:59.880 --> 2:50:04.600]  real state of the world not the establishment of talking points that are put out by the council
[2:50:04.600 --> 2:50:10.120]  in fine relations the builder burden group the debuts group and other clubs we're pushing for a
[2:50:10.120 --> 2:50:17.080]  pro human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans poor humans by humans
[2:50:17.080 --> 2:50:22.280]  not a world where the establishment hate themselves project their hate onto us and decide
[2:50:22.280 --> 2:50:27.400]  we're gonna have a post human world i'm really excited to know that info wars has your support
[2:50:27.400 --> 2:50:35.160]  i want to thank you all for being pro human and pro god was only four months ago that i
[2:50:35.160 --> 2:50:43.400]  warned president drop in the american people the calvary would never stand for you resisting our
[2:50:43.400 --> 2:50:52.760]  takeover there is no limit to which we will not stoop to make you bow via the fear that is innate
[2:50:52.760 --> 2:51:01.480]  in your hearts it was i the leader of cobra that foresaw your inner corners and how much you
[2:51:01.480 --> 2:51:08.280]  would enjoy watching Netflix and wearing masks in clubs when you went out to feel all important
[2:51:08.280 --> 2:51:16.040]  like you were in a war when the real time of calvary was always the billions of people at the edge
[2:51:16.040 --> 2:51:24.600]  of starvation who were about dying at the tune of over a million people every three weeks calvary
[2:51:24.600 --> 2:51:31.640]  thanks you for what you've done continue the lockdowns while i depopulate the planet hail
[2:51:31.640 --> 2:51:42.040]  calvary you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:51:48.280 --> 2:51:53.880]  thursday live the globalists have publicly admitted big link up on info wars dot com
[2:51:53.880 --> 2:51:58.680]  that the lockdown has meant to destroy the world economy kill capitalism with the average person
[2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:03.720]  and starve the third world they're going to kill more people than hitler ever dreamed of
[2:52:03.720 --> 2:52:09.720]  and they're going to get away with it unless we expose them let's go to jeff and canada jeff thanks
[2:52:09.720 --> 2:52:16.440]  for holding on the year worldwide yeah i'm taking my call i just want to talk about the
[2:52:16.440 --> 2:52:23.960]  clash of two systems the two operating systems in the world and and you see the uh the hollywood
[2:52:23.960 --> 2:52:30.600]  and the elitist and the illuminous they're all lining up on their side and uh you know the bible
[2:52:30.600 --> 2:52:39.160]  says it's an anti christ system it's an anti love anti human anti god paradigm that they're in
[2:52:39.800 --> 2:52:45.400]  it's a predatory destructive system that if it had success satan would finally commit suicide at
[2:52:45.400 --> 2:52:54.120]  the end of it it is total destruction it is you know and many times that uh you know we need to
[2:52:54.120 --> 2:52:58.680]  be all in for this i just want to just spread the good news you know the bible says that uh
[2:52:59.320 --> 2:53:04.520]  that they defeated him which is the devil by the blood of the lamb by the word of their testimony
[2:53:04.520 --> 2:53:09.960]  and loving their life not unto death and that last part they're all equally important but
[2:53:09.960 --> 2:53:16.680]  so that last part of loving your life not unto death it's it's paramount that as christian people as
[2:53:16.680 --> 2:53:22.440]  people of good will stand together we'd be willing to die we'd be willing to die i'd be
[2:53:22.440 --> 2:53:29.160]  willing to go right now if if that was the oh to stop this in wouldn't even think about it there
[2:53:29.160 --> 2:53:36.760]  was a button to stop all this evil i would just be yeah and exactly and and as we do that we are
[2:53:36.760 --> 2:53:43.240]  we are guaranteed by god for eternal life a resurrection body just the same resurrection
[2:53:43.240 --> 2:53:47.720]  body that jesus is in and he but doesn't that make sense to go to the next level god doesn't
[2:53:47.720 --> 2:53:51.320]  want to be with a bunch of creeps of course this is a horrible test it's to see who we are
[2:53:52.280 --> 2:53:58.360]  yeah it is really so obvious so so just in wrapping up i just want to say that list of 200
[2:53:58.360 --> 2:54:04.040]  needs to be people that that we boycott that we stand against that we push back against in an
[2:54:04.040 --> 2:54:11.480]  aggressive way and really stake our claim 200 people like two people that agree together
[2:54:11.480 --> 2:54:15.880]  are greater than that crowd of 200 so i just want to encourage everybody else that's right i mean
[2:54:15.880 --> 2:54:21.240]  you think about what magnets these people are saying never go back you know poor people don't
[2:54:21.240 --> 2:54:28.040]  deserve food and you just look at these people they're so evil and they all are so into themselves
[2:54:28.040 --> 2:54:34.920]  i mean what jokes Madonna's like an old woman with a plastic body she's so disgusting yeah they're
[2:54:34.920 --> 2:54:40.600]  all they're all into the the pedophilia they're all birds of a feather are flocking together
[2:54:40.600 --> 2:54:45.160]  but at the end we win thanks alex god bless you brother

[2:55:06.920 --> 2:55:13.320]  college town but we have a lot of people with power that come here and push us kind of like a
[2:55:13.320 --> 2:55:19.480]  beta site for the green agenda the global clinton initiative or the clinton global initiative
[2:55:19.480 --> 2:55:25.800]  has funded um upgrade Athens county which is a push for solar uh energy and for carbon taxes
[2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:31.720]  in our area and also if you look at uh some of the beta sites they're doing for using us as a
[2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:37.800]  driverless car testing site for rural um rural well exactly it's about removing humans from the
[2:55:37.800 --> 2:55:44.200]  environment we're making us obsolete yeah and we're we're we are a beta site for it um if you
[2:55:44.200 --> 2:55:49.720]  want to check that out a lot of all i'm aware sir yes um they have battle maps over key areas they
[2:55:49.720 --> 2:55:54.760]  want to take over as spokes for their completion austin's their main takeover point in texas
[2:55:55.640 --> 2:56:01.800]  yeah and we're a roadmap for that i mean assistant this former assistant director of the cia under

[2:56:07.960 --> 2:56:14.120]  company for bezos buffett jamie diamond um it's from here a lot of it is tied to um just the
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:19.400]  connection to this area and a lot of it as a blueprint being used right here in southeast from
[2:56:19.400 --> 2:56:25.480]  ohio so you're absolutely right brother god bless you ron and brad straight ahead
[2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:29.560]  and then i'm gonna hit how they're trying to cause a race war again
[2:56:32.760 --> 2:56:36.600]  like tens of millions of africans are about to die and lebron james is running around talking
[2:56:36.600 --> 2:56:42.840]  about two white dudes that shot a black dude i'm always excited about info wars life products
[2:56:42.840 --> 2:56:46.440]  they're amazing they're cutting edge you love them i love them and they fund the info war
[2:56:46.440 --> 2:56:52.200]  in the face of the globalist onslaught but we have come up with a new product over a year in
[2:56:52.200 --> 2:57:00.840]  development that is amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic
[2:57:00.840 --> 2:57:08.280]  essential oils on top of it and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just
[2:57:08.280 --> 2:57:15.320]  pour out a bunch of thick gross goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it in a really great way i
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:20.360]  like to put on my hands rub a little bit on my face it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it
[2:57:20.360 --> 2:57:25.800]  right in your eyes but i just love it personally it's something that's a moisturizer as well so
[2:57:26.360 --> 2:57:29.560]  this is the real innovation i don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand
[2:57:29.560 --> 2:57:35.640]  sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out smells great it's so
[2:57:35.640 --> 2:57:49.320]  refreshing this is a big winner when your country is being turned into a 21st century
[2:57:49.320 --> 2:57:58.200]  banhra republic police state silence isn't golden it's yellow you are listening to alex jones
[2:57:58.200 --> 2:58:11.640]  broadcasting live from the front lines if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:58:11.640 --> 2:58:29.080]  coming to you live
[2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:38.600]  all right let's get into the good news
[2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:45.560]  ap exclusive justice department dropping flin's criminal case
[2:58:47.240 --> 2:58:54.200]  he was totally set up he was railroaded by the miller criminal operation but the criminals are
[2:58:54.200 --> 2:59:02.600]  still in the fbi the democratic party crime ops and they've been given orders to destroy
[2:59:02.600 --> 2:59:08.600]  high-level trump supporters and they're so arrogant they haven't even covered their tracks
[2:59:12.840 --> 2:59:13.800]  i'm gonna leave it at that
[2:59:16.680 --> 2:59:19.880]  i'm gonna leave it at that you know general flin son came to our event
[2:59:19.880 --> 2:59:25.320]  along with folks from the defense intelligence agency and i'll leave it at that we've been talking
[2:59:25.320 --> 2:59:32.120]  to those folks and let's just say the army is awake the marines are awake
[2:59:34.120 --> 2:59:41.880]  and trump is awake and the chai comes better watch out and a lot of chinese agents and i
[2:59:41.880 --> 2:59:47.160]  don't wish any harm upon them and i'm not gonna hurt anybody myself i'm not gonna direct anybody
[2:59:47.160 --> 2:59:52.200]  to hurt anybody but the president in a time of war and we're in an undeclared war with china
[2:59:52.760 --> 2:59:59.240]  has the power and the responsibility and the duty to protect this country and so a lot of
[2:59:59.240 --> 3:00:08.040]  chinese agents have been been disappearing and well i just want the globalists and deep
[3:00:08.040 --> 3:00:15.240]  staters to know that the sands of time are running low and are going through that hourglass
[3:00:15.240 --> 3:00:21.800]  right now faster and faster and faster so you think we're afraid i don't want to make you afraid
[3:00:22.520 --> 3:00:27.160]  i want you to leave america and freedom alone and i want you off my back
[3:00:29.160 --> 3:00:32.200]  but know this we will not deviate in our course
[3:00:33.800 --> 3:00:40.840]  in fact we're ramming the pedal down towards this epic destiny of collision
[3:00:40.840 --> 3:00:47.960]  and so you want to bang heads i can tell you we've heard a lot of talk about indictments
[3:00:48.520 --> 3:00:54.600]  and a lot of talk about the deep state and as of now they launched covet 19 all this because
[3:00:54.600 --> 3:01:00.840]  they know trump is intending to rouse the deep state and defeat them the criminal globalist
[3:01:00.840 --> 3:01:14.120]  deep state and i have said to folks that do not wait for an election surprise in july or august
[3:01:14.760 --> 3:01:21.480]  do not wait they're gonna cost too much mischief and too much crises trying to throw the president
[3:01:21.480 --> 3:01:30.040]  out of office the president must pull the collective trigger now now that now is the time launch
[3:01:30.040 --> 3:01:39.640]  everything now indict them now go after them now destroy them now you can't wait any more my god
[3:01:39.640 --> 3:01:44.600]  they've already released this bio weapon simulant and the deep state has locked down the country and
[3:01:44.600 --> 3:01:49.560]  caused a global depression trying to stop us we can't sit here any longer with these mass murderers
[3:01:49.560 --> 3:02:00.760]  there's no more time to play games there i've said what needs to be said again
[3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:04.600]  all right i want to hit a few of your calls but let's hit this first
[3:02:06.760 --> 3:02:11.240]  the thing about perception is stalling said one man dies it's a tragedy 10 000 dies is
[3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:16.520]  statistic and that's true south african's government with actuary says 29 times people are dying
[3:02:16.520 --> 3:02:23.320]  of starvation and suicide and death and murder now that this covet thing has happened that are dying
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:29.480]  from covet un says 135 million to starve to death this year 30 million are dying right now society's
[3:02:29.480 --> 3:02:35.560]  totally breaking down all over the world five and a half almost six billion people live in third
[3:02:35.560 --> 3:02:42.360]  world conditions lebron james sees this video that is suspicious it doesn't look good to me
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:46.840]  at two white guys in georgia that think of black guys trying to rob something so they get in a fight
[3:02:46.840 --> 3:02:53.720]  and they shoot the guy that's wrong i've been in northern california that's as hillbilly as it gets
[3:02:54.760 --> 3:02:59.640]  pulled off on a side road just to just 50 20 feet down a little dirt road to take a piss
[3:02:59.640 --> 3:03:04.600]  and i had hillbilly shoot at me with a shotgun and they hit in the plants above me the trees above
[3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:10.360]  me like right above me a foot ahead the pellets were hitting leaves right on top of me those were
[3:03:10.360 --> 3:03:15.400]  white dudes shooting at me that's what hillbillies do the point is is that you've got millions starving
[3:03:15.400 --> 3:03:19.800]  to death lebron why don't you talk about how the covet lockdown is killing millions already
[3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:25.480]  a lot of black people know you don't do that because you're a puppet of the globalist that's
[3:03:25.480 --> 3:03:31.880]  people in south africa lining up for food no he just wants to make it about white people because
[3:03:31.880 --> 3:03:36.920]  that's the race-baiting chi-com funded narrative he's given even though china is the most racist
[3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:43.160]  towards black people on the planet but they're also showing all over the news shock video shows
[3:03:43.160 --> 3:03:47.240]  white cop repeatedly beating a black man for no social distancing let's show that video
[3:03:48.760 --> 3:03:54.840]  and it's wrong that a white cop walks up and starts beating a black person for no social
[3:03:54.840 --> 3:03:59.400]  distancing it's wrong a black judge put a white woman in jail for shut for not shutting down her
[3:03:59.400 --> 3:04:10.920]  salon it's wrong and here's the cop with the tackling the guy and that's bad okay but the
[3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:15.800]  black guy doesn't want to get off the street and that's that's how i'd be where's his free speech
[3:04:15.800 --> 3:04:20.920]  where's his right to travel now that's nothing compared to this black cop in new york beating
[3:04:20.920 --> 3:04:26.280]  up a black guy but because it's a black guy on a black guy because this black guy does nothing
[3:04:26.280 --> 3:04:30.920]  you know that the other black guy with the white cops pulling back kind of pushing to him i'm not
[3:04:30.920 --> 3:04:34.200]  saying he deserves to be beat on the head but look at this new york footage turn up the audio
[3:04:35.800 --> 3:04:42.440]  it comes up with a taser and then starts punching the black dude in the face and then jumps on top
[3:04:42.440 --> 3:04:45.800]  of him again i'm narrating for radio listeners and then more cops come and jump on the guy they
[3:04:45.800 --> 3:04:50.360]  brutally assault this guy here comes white cops jumping on top of them as well with the black cop
[3:04:50.920 --> 3:04:55.240]  that's wrong any way you slice it but the media is not making a big deal out of the black cop
[3:04:55.240 --> 3:05:00.520]  assaulting the black guy but they're making a big deal about the white cop assaulting the black guy
[3:05:00.520 --> 3:05:05.720]  when he's been ordered to do it it's all wrong it needs to stop the point is obsessing over a few
[3:05:05.720 --> 3:05:10.440]  cases while ignoring the mass death that's happening it's just like obsessing over a few
[3:05:10.440 --> 3:05:16.440]  covid deaths and and not talking about the shutdown causing mass death that's the reality
[3:05:16.440 --> 3:05:21.240]  that's what the media is pushing race narrative again let's take two quick calls and we'll turn
[3:05:21.240 --> 3:05:26.600]  it over to jason jones ronnie new york thanks for holding go ahead hey y'all it's so good to listen
[3:05:26.600 --> 3:05:35.560]  to um i used to be a democrat but then like my friends i grew a brain and uh i became uh i became
[3:05:35.560 --> 3:05:41.240]  enlightened and educated myself i live in a blue city here in new york and uh it's crazy here it's
[3:05:41.240 --> 3:05:47.960]  not easy i used to be a democrat like i said uh but after 9 11 you know i either became
[3:05:47.960 --> 3:05:54.520]  um suspicious of the government narrative so you know this whole thing with the hollywood you
[3:05:54.520 --> 3:06:01.560]  know i i truly believe they are sincere or at least the co-signers signers the usual madonna
[3:06:01.560 --> 3:06:08.520]  robert denero you know and company i believe that they are sincere in their belief but they want
[3:06:08.520 --> 3:06:13.640]  reduced carbon taxes they they want a more greener earth whatever yes i guess i used to be a democrat
[3:06:13.640 --> 3:06:19.400]  i believe in that myself but i'm more right of center now where i'm at well sure some of the
[3:06:19.400 --> 3:06:27.080]  people mean well but the master plan you cut the carbon people die right right and you talk about
[3:06:27.080 --> 3:06:32.280]  you know you always talk about permitting technology they have you know they have life
[3:06:32.280 --> 3:06:39.960]  extension they have the technology they're not giving it to the public right so i believe if we
[3:06:39.960 --> 3:06:47.160]  if if whoever is responsible the u.s patent office trump to get this technology out to the people
[3:06:48.280 --> 3:06:52.360]  i mean i believe this can solve a lot of these it'll get us out of the debt it'll create new
[3:06:52.360 --> 3:06:57.080]  industries and trump has tried to do that they're trying to block him amazing point ron i'm sorry i
[3:06:57.080 --> 3:07:03.480]  gotta jump i want to give brad at least 40 seconds brad in pennsylvania go ahead hey thanks alex uh i

[3:09:17.480 --> 3:09:22.920]  ruling class the nobility the king and queen sitting on top of it and the rest of the public
[3:09:22.920 --> 3:09:29.880]  were kept at a subsistence starving level for control in fact in most cultures they call the
[3:09:29.880 --> 3:09:35.400]  peasants the little people because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and
[3:09:35.400 --> 3:09:41.880]  ladies because they kept them again at a starving level they were so busy trying to survive they
[3:09:41.880 --> 3:09:46.840]  would never try to challenge the entrenched elite well now all the big google owners and the rock

[3:11:01.240 --> 3:11:07.640]  to alex's incredibly large audience on these issues on human dignity and the call of solidarity
[3:11:07.640 --> 3:11:11.800]  we have a good show for you today at the end of the show we're going to have jerald moody
[3:11:11.800 --> 3:11:18.760]  host of this that and the third the new york style podcaster he's been in the coveted man on the
[3:11:18.760 --> 3:11:24.040]  street checking out the hospitals in new york and we're going to have chaps we're going to have
[3:11:24.040 --> 3:11:29.560]  pastor clingen schmidt on to talk about how we can open up our churches but since i talked to you
[3:11:29.560 --> 3:11:38.680]  last i had an exciting week i was arrested on friday and i was in jail only for a couple of hours
[3:11:38.680 --> 3:11:46.040]  when i got out of jail um i had hundreds of texts and emails and i'm like how does everyone know
[3:11:46.040 --> 3:11:54.280]  so fast what i didn't know it was above top of drudge and so everyone i knew uh knew i was in
[3:11:54.280 --> 3:11:59.800]  jail and they were all reaching out and a member of congress a friend of mine messaged me and he
[3:11:59.800 --> 3:12:09.640]  said jason what in the world are you doing why why are you out there and uh you have a reputation
[3:12:09.640 --> 3:12:16.040]  you have friends you you you just embarrassed yourself and i replied i did not embarrass myself
[3:12:16.840 --> 3:12:22.280]  and i want to tell you why i was at the reopen hawaii event and what led to me getting arrested
[3:12:22.280 --> 3:12:30.920]  uh before we get to our great guests you know i love my country and i love the state of hawaii
[3:12:30.920 --> 3:12:35.960]  and i always say our state is like a family i moved here when i was 17 it's a young high school
[3:12:35.960 --> 3:12:43.720]  dropout a soldier in the army quickly had a young family had two children uh from a local girl
[3:12:43.720 --> 3:12:49.640]  got married when i was uh 18 had two children by the time i was 19 and everything rich and
[3:12:49.640 --> 3:12:55.400]  beautiful in my life comes to me from this beautiful community and so i was there for
[3:12:55.400 --> 3:13:01.080]  three reasons my primary reason wasn't the constitution it wasn't the bill of rights
[3:13:02.200 --> 3:13:09.000]  my number one concern and my number one reason for being there was that if this shutdown continues
[3:13:09.720 --> 3:13:15.560]  in the united states and across the western world we are going to see a global food shortage
[3:13:15.560 --> 3:13:21.080]  which the ambassador to the united nations food program said like we haven't seen since world
[3:13:21.080 --> 3:13:27.000]  war two and the most vulnerable community community and the developed world is the
[3:13:27.000 --> 3:13:32.040]  state of hawaii we are the furthest place in the world from any other place in the world
[3:13:32.840 --> 3:13:40.440]  and any contraction of food production leads to a spike in prices we're near 50
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:46.200]  percent unemployment do you think food's going to make it to ships even if ships are moving to
[3:13:46.200 --> 3:13:52.440]  reach us out here in hawaii if we see this catastrophic famine that people are anticipating
[3:13:52.440 --> 3:13:59.320]  so my number one reason for being there was my concern for my community that we may we may
[3:13:59.320 --> 3:14:04.280]  suffer through starvation and famine and then it was also for the people around the world through
[3:14:04.280 --> 3:14:09.880]  my organization the vulnerable people project i'm working 16 hour days with people in the
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:18.040]  governments across africa in the middle east in india bangladesh they are already seeing the signs
[3:14:18.040 --> 3:14:23.560]  of a spike in hunger and david beasley from the world food program says an anticipated spike
[3:14:23.560 --> 3:14:30.520]  in 135 million deaths we you know alex in the early last segment was talking about
[3:14:31.080 --> 3:14:36.440]  racism and violence in america and black lives matter and they're using race to divide us that
[3:14:36.440 --> 3:14:44.600]  is 100 true in fact they use me as race bait in hawaii is this holy who isn't listening to the
[3:14:44.600 --> 3:14:51.320]  laws is not respecting authority and they were trying to divide our community and i was the bait
[3:14:52.040 --> 3:14:58.920]  easy bait right i was the debate on a race baiting hook but i think black lives matter in new jersey
[3:14:58.920 --> 3:15:07.560]  in winni in nigeria in ethiopia in kibira slums in kenya and this shutdown will lead to starvation
[3:15:07.560 --> 3:15:14.040]  there that was the second reason i was there and that is an urgent read that look it's already too
[3:15:14.040 --> 3:15:19.720]  late they're going to be countless millions of deaths because of famine this is just about making
[3:15:19.720 --> 3:15:26.040]  it not something like we've never seen the third reason i was there is like alex said most people
[3:15:26.040 --> 3:15:32.440]  people governments are founders told us we're instituted among men to protect their rights
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:39.560]  but in most places governments are organized thieves they're pirates they brutalize their
[3:15:39.560 --> 3:15:48.520]  own people in the 20th century the number two killer of people was direct violence by the state
[3:15:48.520 --> 3:15:54.600]  against their own citizens in russia and china and cambodia we've seen it across the world
[3:15:54.600 --> 3:16:00.600]  the number two killer in the 20th century was famine most of those famine deaths were caused
[3:16:01.160 --> 3:16:05.640]  by the state keeping people off of their farms did you know that
[3:16:07.320 --> 3:16:13.960]  in the ukraine and the great famine in china in ethiopia when they destroyed the grain surplus
[3:16:14.680 --> 3:16:21.560]  so really government abusive government was the number one killer they used direct violence
[3:16:21.560 --> 3:16:26.760]  and they used famine that was the 20th century now we are seeing a global shutdown like the
[3:16:26.760 --> 3:16:32.120]  world has never seen so that's why i was there and i have this quote from martin luther king
[3:16:33.160 --> 3:16:39.160]  guys if we can we can put that up that to me just sums it up one who breaks an unjust law
[3:16:39.160 --> 3:16:45.720]  must do so openly lovingly and with the willingness to accept the penalty i submit that an individual
[3:16:45.720 --> 3:16:51.960]  who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of
[3:16:51.960 --> 3:16:58.120]  imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over the injustice is in reality
[3:16:58.120 --> 3:17:03.480]  expressing the highest respect for law and i would say with martin reverend martin luther king
[3:17:04.280 --> 3:17:10.840]  yes i have a respect for the law because law is what creates order prosperity peace it's why
[3:17:10.840 --> 3:17:16.120]  our children can live in safe communities but when you pit the police officers like in hawaii
[3:17:16.120 --> 3:17:22.280]  they came in an organized military cordon and i might have overreacted if you saw the video
[3:17:22.280 --> 3:17:29.320]  i wish i could have lovingly expressed my dissent i was a bit spirited hopefully tomorrow when i'm
[3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:34.760]  going back and they can arrest me again and again and again and they can keep me in jail or prison
[3:17:34.760 --> 3:17:41.560]  for as long as they want i'm going to keep going not only because of my respect for the law but
[3:17:41.560 --> 3:17:48.520]  because of my passionate love for my community for my state for the state of hawaii so again
[3:17:50.520 --> 3:17:57.960]  people without names or identities through social media will use me as unfortunate race bait
[3:17:57.960 --> 3:18:06.520]  to divide our community but my hope is eventually everyone in hawaii will see that this is about
[3:18:06.520 --> 3:18:13.000]  our health this is about our well-being this is about our prosperity and this is about our freedom
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:18.600]  not just our freedom but the freedom for our posterity they keep telling us we are entering
[3:18:18.600 --> 3:18:24.120]  into a new normal where we will always wear masks where we will never get to go to church and community
[3:18:24.120 --> 3:18:31.160]  where police are brutal where police wear masks i saw a meme it's a strange time we live in
[3:18:31.160 --> 3:18:37.160]  where the police wear masks and the criminals show their face that says at all reverend martin
[3:18:37.160 --> 3:18:44.840]  luther king would always quote quote thomas equinus a just law is a man-made law that conforms
[3:18:44.840 --> 3:18:53.080]  to the divine will we have to ask ourselves are these laws is this brutality is this inciting of
[3:18:53.080 --> 3:19:00.280]  race hatred does this conform to god's will no did my overly enthusiastic response to the police
[3:19:00.280 --> 3:19:06.600]  conform to god's will no but maybe i'll be better tomorrow after the break gonna be with chaps let's
[3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:17.320]  open the churches as men age they often experience a slowdown in vitality energy and overall wellness

[3:24:11.480 --> 3:24:19.880]  that whatever i'm older than him first of all and that would be impossible and uh we've never met
[3:24:19.880 --> 3:24:26.440]  such a gentleman that allow me to share this platform you're a hero i first met you in a senate
[3:24:26.440 --> 3:24:34.440]  private meeting 20 years ago or so what year was that you were in the navy yeah 2005 i was a navy
[3:24:34.440 --> 3:24:41.320]  chaplain and the government wrote a bad policy saying chaplains cannot pray in jesus name outside of
[3:24:41.320 --> 3:24:46.520]  church you can pray to god you can say amen but if you say the j word you can be punished at court
[3:24:46.520 --> 3:24:52.360]  marshal so i demanded my own misdemeanor court marshal and i was found guilty of worshiping in
[3:24:52.360 --> 3:24:59.960]  public but the good news is jason that 300 000 americans many of your viewers petition congress
[3:24:59.960 --> 3:25:05.560]  and i was vindicated by congress who changed the law in 2006 the secretary of the navy repented
[3:25:05.560 --> 3:25:10.840]  rescinded the policy and now the other chaplains can pray in jesus name even in uniform even in
[3:25:10.840 --> 3:25:15.720]  public 70s a week that was the beginning of my career in politics but that was the end of my
[3:25:15.720 --> 3:25:21.560]  career in the navy i lost a million dollars pension well but you know what i'll trade your
[3:25:21.560 --> 3:25:26.200]  pension for religious freedom for all of us and you did i don't know if i'd have the courage to
[3:25:26.200 --> 3:25:31.640]  trade my pension but i think god for heroes like you and there are a lot of police right now doing
[3:25:31.640 --> 3:25:36.200]  awful things because they're afraid of losing their pension maybe it just takes one or two
[3:25:36.200 --> 3:25:42.280]  it took you and i'm so grateful for you and it was senator brownback who led the charge for you
[3:25:42.280 --> 3:25:47.480]  and i remember on the hill at the time and now he is our ambassador at large for religious freedom
[3:25:47.480 --> 3:25:52.520]  and he's throwing punches fighting hard for the Uyghur and other suffering religious persecution
[3:25:52.520 --> 3:25:59.640]  just a handful of heroes now here you are all of us now can't even pray you you could at least
[3:25:59.640 --> 3:26:03.720]  they were going to let you pray in the name of jesus in your church they're not even letting us
[3:26:03.720 --> 3:26:10.440]  in our church you know i don't i don't do a lot pastor you know what i do i i go to the boxing gym
[3:26:10.440 --> 3:26:15.640]  i get smoothies at the protein shake place down the street i go to church and i go to a used bookstore
[3:26:15.640 --> 3:26:21.480]  that's it um i bet you the church is going to be the last place they open and how do we
[3:26:21.480 --> 3:26:26.200]  get our churches open how does everyone here even those of you who don't go to church you should
[3:26:26.200 --> 3:26:30.760]  help us kick open the doors of the church how are we going to do this chaps well it's fascinating
[3:26:30.760 --> 3:26:38.600]  because uh uh poll just taken i believe by reuters says that 35 percent of americans want churches
[3:26:38.600 --> 3:26:45.240]  to be open first only 21 percent said bars and restaurants only 14 percent said basketball and
[3:26:45.240 --> 3:26:50.600]  movie theaters so churches are the number one priority for reopening and everyone should call
[3:26:50.600 --> 3:26:55.960]  your governor today no matter what stage you're in no matter whether they're republican or democrat
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:27:02.280]  but google their phone number and call them and say these words place the churches on the list
[3:27:02.280 --> 3:27:08.760]  of essential services follow the example of texas governor gray gabin um ron dysantis of florida
[3:27:08.760 --> 3:27:14.120]  those two states were the first to reopen the churches by declaring them essential services
[3:27:14.120 --> 3:27:19.880]  and it's easy for a governor to do and here's two reasons they should do it churches are spiritual
[3:27:19.880 --> 3:27:27.480]  hospitals and you did you know in tennessee the suicide hotline calls are up 800 percent
[3:27:28.280 --> 3:27:34.040]  this month because of the corona virus people are committing suicide and churches can be spiritual
[3:27:34.040 --> 3:27:41.480]  hospitals to minister to their soul also the food kitchen centers a lot of churches have food
[3:27:41.480 --> 3:27:48.680]  pantries but the line at your local food pantry is a mile long and people do not have food with the
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:27:54.040]  rising unemployment the churches must be open because they are essential food distribution
[3:27:54.040 --> 3:27:59.960]  centers and not only that we have religious freedom a federal judge in kansas blocked the
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:06.840]  democrat governor of kansas from limiting worship services or activities to 10 people or fewer to
[3:28:06.840 --> 3:28:11.720]  check the spread of the corona virus because that violates the first amendment religious freedom
[3:28:11.720 --> 3:28:16.680]  freedom of speech rights and the religious freedom restoration act the law is on our side
[3:28:16.680 --> 3:28:22.200]  and it's morally right to open the churches call your governors today you know chaps and i'll give
[3:28:22.200 --> 3:28:31.640]  you another reason the reason totalitarian regimes despise religion is religion points to a law above
[3:28:31.640 --> 3:28:38.600]  them religion minds reminds them that we have somebody more powerful than them in our corner
[3:28:38.600 --> 3:28:43.800]  the all-knowing all-loving creator of the universe and so they don't want to be reminded
[3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:48.920]  that they are not all powerful they don't want to be reminded that there's a law above their
[3:28:48.920 --> 3:28:56.280]  special orders and so when we open up the churches that's going to remind these totalitarians like
[3:28:56.280 --> 3:29:03.960]  this schmuck we just saw in ventura county who really he's recanted now but he said he wants
[3:29:03.960 --> 3:29:07.240]  to come and take you out of your house he's going to come and take you out of your house
[3:29:07.240 --> 3:29:12.680]  he said i don't know if you saw that so it reminds these petty petty tyrants there's there's a law
[3:29:13.480 --> 3:29:19.080]  above the laws of man there's a law above the special orders of man there's this beautiful movie
[3:29:20.600 --> 3:29:26.440]  a hidden life came out last year from terrence mallick it's on amazon now and it's on and on this
[3:29:26.440 --> 3:29:33.320]  this this farmer who refuses to take the loyalty oath to hitler and this ss officer who liked this
[3:29:33.320 --> 3:29:39.480]  man his catholic says to him do you think you have the right not to say this oath and he says
[3:29:40.040 --> 3:29:46.360]  do you think that we have the right to say it and the state does not have the right to stop me
[3:29:46.360 --> 3:29:53.320]  from going to church and as a catholic the law of the church is i must go to church on sundays
[3:29:53.320 --> 3:29:58.760]  so the government does not have the right to stop me from going to church and i have the duty to go
[3:29:58.760 --> 3:30:05.320]  to church and so we need to open up these churches immediately you know imagine if netflix stopped
[3:30:05.320 --> 3:30:12.760]  streaming people would be out on the streets well christians we if the bread and circus has stopped
[3:30:12.760 --> 3:30:19.000]  and they're gonna and they're gonna that's when hell is gonna break loose we as christians need

[3:30:24.760 --> 3:30:30.360]  this segment but i wrote a book how to liberate the world a step by step guide to take back your
[3:30:30.360 --> 3:30:37.240]  country available on amazon and everywhere books are sold we have sent uh five million petitions
[3:30:37.240 --> 3:30:42.440]  to congress over the years we have helped change bad laws or policies in 13 states we always win
[3:30:42.440 --> 3:30:48.200]  because there are more of us demanding liberty than there are tyrants demanding to oppress us

[3:31:12.760 --> 3:31:16.920]  resonate with what i'm saying if you don't spread the word if you don't buy the products to fund
[3:31:16.920 --> 3:31:21.480]  our operation the dog doesn't hunt but you get that you are patriots you are people that
[3:31:21.480 --> 3:31:26.200]  live and work in the real world of erase color and create and understand what's happening and
[3:31:26.200 --> 3:31:30.200]  that's why when you call in and thank me for what i've done it's really a sick joke thank you
[3:31:30.760 --> 3:31:34.760]  for what you've done we're all of this together we believe in the rights of the unborn we believe
[3:31:34.760 --> 3:31:39.880]  in families we believe in the right to self-defense we believe in capitalism america and jesus christ
[3:31:39.880 --> 3:31:45.800]  number one and we believe in free speech and so the fact that you shop with us and the fact
[3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:51.000]  that you spread the word about what we're doing does everything in the world that's why i salute you
[3:31:51.000 --> 3:31:55.800]  and i thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have this whole planet sewn up by
[3:31:55.800 --> 3:32:00.680]  now they thought they'd be in charge they thought that would have won but they didn't count on you
[3:32:00.680 --> 3:32:09.880]  and i and others coming together so god bless you the lockdown is permanent dictatorship
[3:32:10.440 --> 3:32:17.080]  the lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended
[3:32:17.080 --> 3:32:24.440]  and a global medical tyranny led by the who and the bill melinda gates foundation in full control
[3:32:25.240 --> 3:32:31.480]  many will submit through fear others will be bought off but in the end the globalists admit
[3:32:31.480 --> 3:32:37.400]  they're building a post human world and now that we're inside the cage it's going to move
[3:32:37.400 --> 3:32:45.880]  very very quickly into its end game submission to this is a form of living death and committing
[3:32:45.880 --> 3:32:52.280]  the next generation and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until
[3:32:52.280 --> 3:32:58.600]  you're actually experiencing this this is your dignity your soul your future being poured inside
[3:32:58.600 --> 3:33:04.920]  out this is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfish
[3:33:04.920 --> 3:33:11.320]  disgusting power trip i don't like coming to you every day on the radio and tv stations that you
[3:33:11.320 --> 3:33:15.560]  watch and listen to a song and telling you all these horrible things but you notice almost
[3:33:15.560 --> 3:33:22.280]  everything we've talked about horrible has come true we were warning everybody to try to stop it
[3:33:22.280 --> 3:33:27.000]  it's like telling somebody if you got a pool put a fence around it if you have little kids
[3:33:27.000 --> 3:33:31.000]  because even if they're good swimmers they can hit their head and drown people don't listen they go
[3:33:31.000 --> 3:33:35.320]  out and their kids dead in the pool well ladies and gentlemen this is the death of the third world
[3:33:35.320 --> 3:33:40.920]  and the collapse of the first world and this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalist
[3:33:40.920 --> 3:33:46.280]  and they admit they've orchestrated it they admit it's quote good to save the earth and they're
[3:33:46.280 --> 3:33:51.400]  teaching us to be more frugal and they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender
[3:33:51.400 --> 3:33:56.760]  to this post-human technocracy i know all this sounds insane when i was talking about it 25 years
[3:33:56.760 --> 3:34:02.600]  ago but now it's public because it's their operations manual i wish this wasn't the case
[3:34:02.600 --> 3:34:07.080]  but they're really our evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop
[3:34:07.080 --> 3:34:13.160]  them ten weeks ago i began to tell listeners that they needed to get high quality swarovable food
[3:34:13.160 --> 3:34:18.200]  not because of the virus but because of the crises and the economic shutdown it would
[3:34:18.200 --> 3:34:23.160]  cause because the globalist were planning to hold america hostage and run a blockade through the
[3:34:23.160 --> 3:34:28.680]  blue cities and blue states now that prediction has come true because the globalists are running
[3:34:28.680 --> 3:34:35.960]  an operation it's not predictions we have their battle plans so going back more than eight weeks
[3:34:35.960 --> 3:34:40.440]  ago all major swarovable food companies were sold out except my patreon supply because they're the
[3:34:40.440 --> 3:34:45.960]  biggest or pre-position when it got to the point they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't
[3:34:45.960 --> 3:34:49.880]  be able to fulfill them in a timely manner they stopped taking orders till they got caught back
[3:34:49.880 --> 3:34:54.760]  up well now they're caught back up they got high quality swarovable food in stock ready to be packaged
[3:34:54.760 --> 3:35:00.840]  and shipped to you get your orders in now at infowarstore.com to go right at the head of the queue
[3:35:00.840 --> 3:35:06.600]  to get delivered to you as fast as possible and from the employer here's trouble food now at infowarstore.com
[3:35:11.480 --> 3:35:14.120]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:35:14.120 --> 3:35:31.800]  welcome back to the alex jones show i am your guest host jason jones it's a prison it's a
[3:35:31.800 --> 3:35:38.040]  privilege to join you as as we fight our way out of this prison planet and my next guest is gerald
[3:35:38.040 --> 3:35:42.760]  moody for the reason i wanted to have him on is we're seeing these news stories are rough about
[3:35:42.760 --> 3:35:48.760]  violence violence against black men by white cops and we see that they're trying to divide us we've
[3:35:48.760 --> 3:35:54.760]  seen violence against white people by white cops last week in honolulu when i was arrested i saw
[3:35:54.760 --> 3:36:02.920]  the mainstream media our own newspaper used me as bait to inspire racism they used my family my
[3:36:02.920 --> 3:36:08.040]  kids are only half me and they're only half white my family is my children my nieces and nephews and
[3:36:08.040 --> 3:36:14.200]  children and cousins are hawaiian filipino chinese and to see the media using me as race bait i knew
[3:36:14.200 --> 3:36:22.120]  the game they are trying to divide us so i wanted to get my man jerald moody on the show jim jerald
[3:36:22.120 --> 3:36:29.160]  is the host of one of my favorite podcasts this that and the third and that is a new york style
[3:36:29.160 --> 3:36:34.920]  podcast he has been a coveted reporter the man on the street checking out the hospitals of new york
[3:36:34.920 --> 3:36:41.160]  jerald welcome to the alex jones show yes what's up jay thanks for having me man thanks for having
[3:36:41.160 --> 3:36:45.960]  me really appreciate it well i appreciate you coming on you know and i saw this story break i'm
[3:36:45.960 --> 3:36:50.040]  in hawaii so i find things out a little later because i'm waking up a little later the sun the
[3:36:50.040 --> 3:36:58.120]  way the sun moves at all um right so what's going on we see these these this footage is this racism
[3:36:58.120 --> 3:37:02.680]  by the cops is this the media trying to use race to divide us as we're already being divided
[3:37:02.680 --> 3:37:11.240]  man um here in new york city man uh certain areas are police differently that's just a
[3:37:11.240 --> 3:37:17.240]  fact of life here so downtown lower min hatton by the world trade center the former world trade
[3:37:17.240 --> 3:37:23.240]  center a lot of parks over there and not barricaded if you go down there you could see people
[3:37:24.040 --> 3:37:30.600]  picnicking you know social distancing not being in force and everything's going on because people
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:34.600]  are enjoying the great weather but when you come uptown when you come to Harlem in different
[3:37:34.600 --> 3:37:40.760]  neighborhoods the parks are barricaded you can't get in the park and if you don't have a mask you
[3:37:40.760 --> 3:37:46.840]  may be accosted by the police but if you are downtown you won't be accosted you will be actually
[3:37:46.840 --> 3:37:52.760]  given a mask so it's a different policing and it's always been that way here in new york city
[3:37:52.760 --> 3:37:57.800]  unfortunately i mean this is this is really unbelievable you know something we're seeing
[3:37:57.800 --> 3:38:04.040]  in hawaii is um i asked a friend of mine in california i said what's what's it what's
[3:38:04.040 --> 3:38:11.960]  uniting these people gerald that are resisting what's uniting these people that are we're
[3:38:11.960 --> 3:38:17.160]  getting a little bit of feedback brother i think uh on your mic but um my question is
[3:38:17.720 --> 3:38:22.680]  what is uniting the people that are resisting these orders you know at the event that i was at
[3:38:22.680 --> 3:38:27.480]  it was every ethnicity but the news crews wanted to make it about white people being
[3:38:27.480 --> 3:38:35.080]  uppity and and and not want to go along to get along but the truth is what hawaii was there
[3:38:35.720 --> 3:38:40.360]  and so the media was using race there to divide us the truth is we were all there they weren't
[3:38:40.360 --> 3:38:45.160]  all christians i was pushing the car with a a guy i think owns uh what do they call a gentleman's
[3:38:45.160 --> 3:38:52.200]  club so it was a diversity of our population i asked a friend of mine in california who's
[3:38:52.200 --> 3:38:56.120]  fighting all this in orange county and she said you want to know the truth it's the surfers
[3:38:56.120 --> 3:39:02.680]  and it's the skateboarders and then now we see in new york city guys in harlem's like no i'm not
[3:39:02.680 --> 3:39:09.000]  wearing a mask what is the common thread that's uniting everybody who is calling bs on this tyranny
[3:39:09.880 --> 3:39:16.040]  i think people are skeptical of the mainstream media i think a lot of people are becoming more
[3:39:16.040 --> 3:39:23.960]  aware of the staging events of the media and a lot of social media is is pointing it out
[3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:31.160]  so people are now opening their minds to well you know dbs nbc all that stuff it's not written in
[3:39:31.160 --> 3:39:37.960]  stone it's not concrete these are not credible sources so when they come outside they feel
[3:39:37.960 --> 3:39:44.520]  like yo this is what it is and you can't make me wear the mask and and that's why i think it's
[3:39:44.520 --> 3:39:51.800]  because they don't believe the media like they used to and people are now grabbing that and taking
[3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:57.480]  taking it on like yo we don't we don't believe you basically and that's what's happening and
[3:39:57.480 --> 3:40:02.920]  the cops are going at the kids and going at some of the you know young men and they're fighting back
[3:40:02.920 --> 3:40:10.520]  based on not believing the media that's what's happening man i say even me i mean i i always
[3:40:10.520 --> 3:40:15.640]  knew the msn the mainstream media was bs but i used to pick up my morning paper when it was
[3:40:15.640 --> 3:40:20.920]  outside my doorstep every morning i'll bring it in and i'll read it now i look at them pile up i
[3:40:20.920 --> 3:40:26.360]  don't even want to touch it i see three four five days in my newspaper now like why can't i just grab
[3:40:26.360 --> 3:40:31.400]  the paper and bring it in it's like i don't even want to bring myself to touch it because i know
[3:40:31.400 --> 3:40:39.560]  it's just all lies now yeah right it's like all lies did you see the big one in new york is the
[3:40:39.560 --> 3:40:44.840]  center of it today my wife called me and she goes honey you got to hear this nonsense they're talking
[3:40:44.840 --> 3:40:51.480]  about a kovat related disease attacking children but when you pay attention to the story it's not
[3:40:51.480 --> 3:40:56.680]  even been confirmed there's no evidence of it lots of kids that don't test for kovat are getting it
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:01.480]  have you seen this new narrative they're painting about a kovat related mystery disease in new york
[3:41:02.280 --> 3:41:10.520]  oh no i'm not i'm not up on that one yet they come out so fast quomo right 60 the governor of new york
[3:41:10.520 --> 3:41:18.120]  quomo said 66 of the new cases that they got the kovat have come from people sheltering in place
[3:41:18.120 --> 3:41:23.640]  this is a joke this is what i called it i called it a pandemic this is a complete joke but they
[3:41:23.640 --> 3:41:30.760]  understand that the public is very gullible they will believe anything so thank god for youtube
[3:41:30.760 --> 3:41:36.040]  thank god for guys going out there to these hospitals and seeing that nobody's in the hospital
[3:41:36.040 --> 3:41:44.040]  so it's yeah well you did it you went you did it in new york so you went you went to where they said
[3:41:44.040 --> 3:41:49.720]  is the epicenter of it all yeah and yeah we broke that lie we broke the lie that they didn't have
[3:41:49.720 --> 3:41:53.880]  enough respirators we broke the lie that the hospitals were overwhelmed they have seamlessly
[3:41:53.880 --> 3:41:59.400]  shifted from us flat in the curve to like let's wait for a vaccine now new mysterious diseases
[3:41:59.400 --> 3:42:06.680]  is and um you know what we need to do gerald is i posted on my facebook today uh watch me on
[3:42:06.680 --> 3:42:11.400]  info wars i'll be guest hosting for alex jones the four o'clock hour and then during the break
[3:42:11.400 --> 3:42:16.520]  i looked at my feet and people said you're being censored they have removed me posting people can't
[3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:22.040]  see me posting just saying i'm going to be on the show not even linked to it and we need phone trees
[3:42:22.040 --> 3:42:27.080]  like in the old days you make a tree all your friends you call hey we need email trees we might
[3:42:27.080 --> 3:42:34.280]  need to start sending smoke signals because uh we and we have this network of beautiful people like
[3:42:34.280 --> 3:42:40.760]  your podcast i love it because you don't come to things you don't come to things with this ideology
[3:42:40.760 --> 3:42:46.920]  you don't have um you don't have an axe to grind i think you started out your show really wanted
[3:42:46.920 --> 3:42:52.760]  to be about music and your community and you weren't looking to be social justice warrior
[3:42:52.760 --> 3:42:59.960]  and all of a sudden i saw your show shift it was like that melka max quote my favorite quote in
[3:42:59.960 --> 3:43:03.880]  the world he said i didn't land on plurinth rock it fell on me i feel like you wanted to do a
[3:43:04.600 --> 3:43:11.800]  a podcast on hip hop culture and then this rock of the deep state fell on you and you're like i
[3:43:11.800 --> 3:43:16.520]  guess i gotta fight back but i have the best music in the world on my podcast while i'm fighting back
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:24.520]  was that kind of what happened yes man you know i after you know you just get tired of the narrative
[3:43:24.520 --> 3:43:29.640]  and you know how the media works and then you talk to people and they seem like they're brainwashed
[3:43:29.640 --> 3:43:35.080]  and i said you know a lot of people listen to this podcast why not just expose these guys
[3:43:35.080 --> 3:43:40.360]  for what it is why not just put it out there so they can think for themselves once you think
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:46.360]  for yourself and you really have your own thought and you're free you could detect and read between
[3:43:46.360 --> 3:43:50.920]  the lines with these uh with this media and i just wanted to expose it so people could just
[3:43:50.920 --> 3:43:57.560]  think i wanted to provoke thinking think for yourself these are all liars the question is
[3:43:58.200 --> 3:44:04.680]  what's the point what's the major of motivation what's the objective that they hope to accomplish
[3:44:04.680 --> 3:44:11.320]  you know that that that's the scary thing yeah well you know i don't know what their goal is
[3:44:11.320 --> 3:44:16.520]  but i know what the end result will be regardless of their intention it's going to be famine from
[3:44:16.520 --> 3:44:21.160]  the horn of africa it's going to be civil unrest in the united states it's going to be hunger in the
[3:44:21.160 --> 3:44:26.280]  state of hawaii so we need to unite all of our communities need to resist from brooklyn to the
[3:44:26.280 --> 3:44:32.680]  west side of oahu all this is hairdresser in texas just won a big battle and showed them what's
[3:44:32.680 --> 3:44:39.960]  well when she raised 500 000 um if all of us where we are have the courage you know police
[3:44:39.960 --> 3:44:46.120]  officers national guard officers you say i'm done i'm not coming into work enough i'm not following
[3:44:46.120 --> 3:44:52.440]  these orders celebrities religious leaders if they had your courage and alex jones's courage
[3:44:52.440 --> 3:44:57.240]  and this hairdresser's courage this would be over tomorrow every doctor in my life
[3:44:57.240 --> 3:45:04.520]  in my neighborhood they all say this is a crock but none of them say in private they go this is a
[3:45:04.520 --> 3:45:12.680]  crock we all need to say this out loud yes yes man and youtube and you know they take they scrub the
[3:45:12.680 --> 3:45:19.080]  uh the dissenting opinions that come from doctors you can't if you don't see it immediately on youtube
[3:45:19.080 --> 3:45:25.240]  it'll be gone so man you just got to keep at it because once we lay down it's finished you got to
