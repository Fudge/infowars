[00:00.000 --> 00:16.600]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.600 --> 00:24.800]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones good morning
[00:24.800 --> 00:28.360]  good afternoon depending on where you're listening to us across the planet it is
[00:28.360 --> 00:33.600]  Wednesday April 29th year is 2020 we have 187 days left out until the
[00:33.600 --> 00:39.640]  historic election and I'm just gonna do a bit of psychoanalyzing for myself here
[00:39.640 --> 00:44.080]  on air and I know a lot of you want the same thing and just just be honest with
[00:44.080 --> 00:50.600]  the audience of great people I have always been able to deal with the New
[00:50.600 --> 00:54.560]  World Order because I understand its operations I know we can beat it but I
[00:54.560 --> 00:58.880]  have been shocked by how fast they've been moving and accelerating everything
[00:58.880 --> 01:07.160]  with this giant de-evolutional jump that they've launched and to really come to
[01:07.160 --> 01:13.280]  grips with the fact that they're really going to carry it all out so when you
[01:13.280 --> 01:16.400]  read the UN reports where they say they're gonna reduce the world population
[01:16.400 --> 01:19.200]  to 500 million
[01:19.200 --> 01:24.800]  they really intend on killing almost everybody and they've got a rollout
[01:24.800 --> 01:29.840]  plan on how to do this so this lockdown that I predicted in the film endgame 14
[01:29.840 --> 01:35.880]  years ago is just the training wheels so that when they really hit you with the
[01:35.880 --> 01:42.520]  bio weapon the Dick Cheney talked about legitimizing the use of in the PNAC
[01:42.520 --> 01:49.880]  Rebuilding America's offenses document in April 2000 people will follow orders
[01:49.880 --> 01:55.480]  and go die in their houses so I just want you to know that they're more pissed at
[01:55.480 --> 01:59.520]  me now than they've ever been pissed and they don't want to make me into a
[01:59.520 --> 02:05.640]  martyr but the globalists are really making decisions right now whether
[02:05.640 --> 02:09.160]  they're just gonna wipe us out in the next couple weeks next few months I mean
[02:09.160 --> 02:13.800]  they are they are pissed and they know you're waking up and they know people
[02:13.800 --> 02:20.040]  are flocking to infill wars and that basically the infill warzization is
[02:20.040 --> 02:23.080]  happening it's happening with medical doctors it's happening with law
[02:23.080 --> 02:30.240]  enforcement it's happening with other talk show host and my mission has been
[02:30.240 --> 02:33.680]  greatly carried out because I knew they were gonna launch this and then it's
[02:33.680 --> 02:37.480]  gonna get very dystopian very very quickly then they're gonna start killing
[02:37.480 --> 02:43.440]  folks you know walk up shoot you right in the head the left's getting ready for
[02:43.440 --> 02:46.320]  their revolution they're gonna take your kids they're gonna take your money
[02:46.320 --> 02:51.120]  they're gonna take your health they're gonna take your life then you go read
[02:51.120 --> 02:54.080]  Reddit on one of the Communist Chinese and you see how they talk about how
[02:54.080 --> 02:58.240]  much they hate America and you go hang around the left I mean these are very
[02:58.240 --> 03:03.440]  bad people and the dumbing down has created incredible psychological
[03:03.440 --> 03:11.360]  corruption and so my job always was to popularize these horrible globalist
[03:11.360 --> 03:16.160]  blueprints so that if they ever were able to actually do it which they bit
[03:16.160 --> 03:22.240]  they're on schedule pretty much now a little bit behind that people would go
[03:22.240 --> 03:27.480]  oh my god we've got to fight this because you see everything with their
[03:27.480 --> 03:31.360]  system counts on it incrementally being rolled out and them having different
[03:31.360 --> 03:36.600]  reasons why they do this or do that but it all goes together like a Lego set and
[03:36.600 --> 03:40.520]  is constructed and in the final phase when all the pieces they built
[03:40.520 --> 03:44.640]  separately of other little pieces start locking together and people see the
[03:44.640 --> 03:49.360]  horror of it the globalist think it'll be too late then for you to resist you'll
[03:49.360 --> 03:53.760]  be too poisoned too dumb down you'll have too many combat robots and other
[03:53.760 --> 03:57.320]  surveillance systems humans will be so domesticated we won't even know how to
[03:57.320 --> 04:02.880]  take care of ourselves will be obsolete at the point they kill everybody but
[04:02.880 --> 04:06.560]  everything you've seen so far as it's a prelude but I knew that if we could
[04:06.560 --> 04:12.400]  popularize where it wasn't just academic this understanding that the public it
[04:12.400 --> 04:18.200]  would become part of legend that this was coming and then when it came we would
[04:18.200 --> 04:24.120]  have enough resistance formed to derail their operation and stop it now their
[04:24.120 --> 04:28.640]  argument is it's survival of the fittest social Darwinism and that you
[04:28.640 --> 04:33.440]  deserve to be killed I kind of agree with that I don't deserve to be killed
[04:33.440 --> 04:37.120]  and I'm not gonna join them so I'm telling listeners and viewers if you
[04:37.120 --> 04:42.440]  want to live you better wake up now and realize this is all real okay I'm real
[04:42.440 --> 04:46.600]  God's real the devil's real you're real and you better decide which side you're
[04:46.600 --> 04:51.680]  on right now because they're coming to literally steal your soul yeah this
[04:51.680 --> 04:55.480]  didn't run by humans well they're right back stay with us
[04:58.280 --> 05:04.080]  when one studies history and human nature you learn very quickly that
[05:04.080 --> 05:09.800]  rugged individualism and people to think for themselves build free societies
[05:09.800 --> 05:15.720]  innovate do amazing things but those that love to grovel those that love to be
[05:15.720 --> 05:20.480]  subservient those that love to comply and think that it's a virtue they create
[05:20.480 --> 05:28.000]  stagnation corruption tyranny and then finally collapse and the world is now
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.360]  being tested and we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied
[05:33.360 --> 05:38.400]  submitted their whole lives believing if they just submit down a bigger way
[05:38.400 --> 05:44.800]  somehow they'll create a heavenly future but the technocrats running the
[05:44.800 --> 05:50.600]  global system are oppressive and anti-human and our psychotic and are building
[05:50.600 --> 05:56.160]  an anti-human future submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck
[05:56.160 --> 05:59.280]  and throwing into the ocean
[06:04.280 --> 06:11.760]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[06:11.760 --> 06:18.440]  we now take you live to planet earth with a human population on the space
[06:18.440 --> 06:23.720]  park of seven and a half billion there is a scientific dictatorship in the
[06:23.720 --> 06:31.000]  process of carrying out its depopulation eugenics operation and we
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.160]  have woken up in a new world or decades of technocratic planning are now
[06:36.160 --> 06:41.400]  launching into full gear this is the beginning of the end of humans on this
[06:41.400 --> 06:47.160]  planet this is the beginning of the planetary extermination being carried
[06:47.160 --> 06:54.840]  out by Satan and his service it is an interdimensional alien attack they're
[06:54.840 --> 06:58.600]  working with collaborators ladies and gentlemen who believe that they're
[06:58.600 --> 07:04.440]  gonna merge with the system to become AI guides for their collaboration they
[07:04.440 --> 07:10.800]  are deceived those on the top of the pyramid know that they are to be
[07:10.800 --> 07:16.520]  destroyed but have already since genetically hundreds of years of
[07:16.520 --> 07:23.040]  inbreeding align themselves with Satan alright ladies and gentlemen thought I
[07:23.040 --> 07:25.720]  just take you to the bottom of the rabbit hole there that's what they believe
[07:25.720 --> 07:28.760]  the globalists believe they're communicating with interdimensional
[07:28.760 --> 07:35.880]  entities that have given them advanced technology or advanced ideas the
[07:35.880 --> 07:44.760]  impetus or the system that that that that basically spurs their twisted
[07:44.760 --> 07:49.160]  creativity their inspiration
[07:54.840 --> 08:01.760]  Tucker Carlson has really turned into a thoroughbred of pro-human populist
[08:01.760 --> 08:08.920]  enlightenment and that's a good thing I think that's who he always was but he
[08:08.920 --> 08:13.880]  couldn't believe that things were so bad he thought people like me were wrong he
[08:13.880 --> 08:21.040]  knows that's not the case now and I wouldn't take the credit for it but I
[08:21.040 --> 08:23.120]  think all of us should take the credit for it have been in the pro-human
[08:23.120 --> 08:30.000]  liberty movement the anti-New World Order movement the anti-satan movement the
[08:30.000 --> 08:37.480]  common sense movement the life movement the Genesis movement that's really what
[08:37.480 --> 08:41.440]  we are the planet itself is a Genesis jump point for incredible things we're
[08:41.440 --> 08:47.320]  going to build and grow together and we will make it we will make it the planet
[08:47.320 --> 08:53.000]  will make it we'll go into the future and then we'll look back and realize that
[08:53.000 --> 09:00.560]  this was all like a little postage stamp compared to the wider universe but
[09:00.560 --> 09:05.760]  it's a postage stamp that delivered this letter this this information our
[09:05.760 --> 09:12.680]  genetic code to a very important destination and then this creation won't
[09:12.680 --> 09:20.880]  even matter it'll just be rolled up like a scroll and be nothing but data but we
[09:20.880 --> 09:26.640]  will go on through the metamorphosis to the next level and the next and the
[09:26.640 --> 09:31.640]  next and the next because the eye has not seen and the ear has not heard what
[09:31.640 --> 09:43.080]  God has in store for us until these days begin and for every acceleration of evil
[09:43.080 --> 09:52.160]  on this planet there is an acceleration of good I'm gonna stop right there there
[09:52.160 --> 09:56.680]  is no doubt that the planet's being held hostage there's no doubt they're using
[09:56.680 --> 10:00.800]  COVID-19 to kill the economy to punish nationals there's no doubt they're
[10:00.800 --> 10:04.640]  using it to roll out 5g there's no doubt they're using it to roll out total
[10:04.640 --> 10:09.280]  censorship of everyone and anyone the world was shocked just two weeks ago
[10:09.280 --> 10:15.760]  and Facebook and Twitter and Google were banning people that said I'm gonna go
[10:15.760 --> 10:23.960]  out and exercise my first amendment I'm going bankrupt or I can't go to the
[10:23.960 --> 10:26.600]  hospital and get the surgery I need because it's closed everybody but
[10:26.600 --> 10:35.800]  COVID-19 patients and the hospitals are empty they would ban those people now
[10:35.800 --> 10:41.520]  they banned the video as you know on Sunday that had 5 million views was
[10:41.520 --> 10:46.040]  gonna go on its way straight up to have 20 30 40 50 million views and that one
[10:46.040 --> 10:49.920]  press conference of those two doctors just laying out known admitted facts and
[10:49.920 --> 10:55.800]  numbers was banned for violating YouTube's terms of service their press
[10:55.800 --> 11:02.200]  conference their video their YouTube site or their clinics good doctors and
[11:02.200 --> 11:06.760]  good standing talking to American people like we're five years old explaining to
[11:06.760 --> 11:13.000]  us how things work and it's the impers new clothes the impers butt naked the
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.400]  common tell them that only royalty can see the clothes he can't see the clothes
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.640]  we thinks well I must not be royalty I better not tell folks I can't see it
[11:21.640 --> 11:24.640]  everybody else sees a naked king and underwear walking down the street but if
[11:24.640 --> 11:29.640]  they laugh at him they'll get thrown in the dungeon and so no one will say hey
[11:29.640 --> 11:37.920]  the king is wearing no clothes but that's what this is this whole thing is a
[11:37.920 --> 11:44.960]  giant line USA today confirms what we already know but we have to have it
[11:44.960 --> 11:49.800]  fact-checked that a COVID-19 entry gets you $40,000 out of this federal slush
[11:49.800 --> 11:56.200]  fund and you get $4,000 if it's some other slush fund so they're coding
[11:56.200 --> 12:07.600]  everyone is COVID-19 that right there is a giant complete and total fraud and
[12:07.600 --> 12:11.120]  then if you know why that's going on you understand the whole thing this has all
[12:11.120 --> 12:15.880]  been coded and architected and planned and ironed out for decades they've been
[12:15.880 --> 12:20.560]  getting ready under disease X drills for the response you've now seen and this
[12:20.560 --> 12:27.960]  activated emergency responses of the WHO and the global government and that's all
[12:27.960 --> 12:34.720]  on record that that's all been prepared and ready and you talk to the public and
[12:34.720 --> 12:38.800]  they go oh no that's planned I don't plan stuff when it's like saying the
[12:38.800 --> 12:44.480]  street signs aren't planned or the roads aren't planned or GPS isn't planned or
[12:44.480 --> 12:48.680]  the night sky full of satellites isn't planned that's a plan and you're not in
[12:48.680 --> 12:54.560]  it and when you act like a lazy dumb person when the red indicator lights are
[12:54.560 --> 13:02.520]  all flashing and don't stand up to this you green light the total absolute end
[13:02.520 --> 13:08.480]  of humanity this isn't some revolution where the workers get empowered this is
[13:08.480 --> 13:13.360]  a revolution where there are no more men and women in the next phase and then
[13:13.360 --> 13:21.200]  we're all gone and that's now official NBC news the end of humanity's here great
[13:21.200 --> 13:24.200]  we're gonna merge the machines and then those will phase out to this new
[13:24.200 --> 13:29.200]  silicon god total cult totally dangerous totally insane run by the richest
[13:29.200 --> 13:32.840]  people in the world who want immortality and have been promised by this evil
[13:32.840 --> 13:39.280]  force immortality if they first kill the humans not a science fiction movie the
[13:39.280 --> 13:44.840]  real world and now that's what they're pushing and that's what they're saying
[13:44.840 --> 13:49.600]  and there's a couple articles today about how now the big video game companies
[13:49.600 --> 13:55.320]  there's been leaks that they're being directed stories on enforce.com to not
[13:55.320 --> 13:59.280]  show and I already saw this without getting the documents to not show men as
[13:59.280 --> 14:03.760]  masculine and not show women as feminine but to merge the two well if you read
[14:03.760 --> 14:14.760]  Brave New World published in 1932 almost 90 years ago and then you read Brave New
[14:14.760 --> 14:22.400]  World revisited I keep going back to this ladies and gentlemen he said in the
[14:22.400 --> 14:27.920]  future there will be no sexes because we're gonna put chemicals in the food
[14:27.920 --> 14:34.640]  water in phase one to confuse gender then we'll have movements that unionizes
[14:34.640 --> 14:40.000]  the term he used the new genderless people and then they're just gonna
[14:40.000 --> 14:45.920]  completely break the family and have us raised in hatcheries and the average
[14:45.920 --> 14:51.080]  human that serves the established will be a three foot tall dwarf creature this
[14:51.080 --> 14:55.120]  is the actual plan and and he said but we'll probably just go with computers
[14:55.120 --> 15:02.960]  we're that's just one track one program of the the globalist he said and his
[15:02.960 --> 15:09.280]  brother who ran the World Eugenics Society later found a transhumanism they
[15:09.280 --> 15:18.000]  lay out the whole plan for this and so when you open the news up this is an
[15:18.000 --> 15:23.920]  exact plan it's all a giant rollout and it's being done to you and they know
[15:23.920 --> 15:32.880]  you'll adapt to being genderless you'll adapt to being killed and so then they
[15:32.880 --> 15:38.360]  make that the new big cause celeb and the new market because they're doing to
[15:38.360 --> 15:43.000]  you I mean this is this is the end of humanity folks first they take our
[15:43.000 --> 15:49.160]  humanity away and then they kill us but first they've got to destroy those
[15:49.160 --> 15:53.000]  archetypes first they want to twist us and vandalize us and have their way
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.680]  with us and to face us and have a little fun with us before they finally put our
[15:56.680 --> 16:01.200]  lights out this is a pandemic survival alert and the most time sensitive
[16:01.200 --> 16:05.040]  messages you will hear this year you still have time to plan a one acre

[16:09.480 --> 16:13.160]  running out and it's one deadline you don't want to miss who should plan a
[16:13.160 --> 16:17.760]  crisis garden individuals families churches communities anyone or any group
[16:17.760 --> 16:21.920]  that sees hard times ahead let's face it even the mainline media is talking
[16:21.920 --> 16:25.360]  about food supply disruptions and the growing number of grocery store workers
[16:25.360 --> 16:29.360]  who are becoming sick but there's more meat packing plans are closing mile long
[16:29.360 --> 16:34.000]  lines at food pantries and more farmers now in financial trouble the truth is

[18:09.840 --> 18:14.600]  and making us dependent on them the food shortages have begun the depression is
[18:14.600 --> 18:18.120]  going to be long and very very serious in fact it's probably too late now to
[18:18.120 --> 18:21.760]  even turn back Trump try to stop it but the mainstream media working with the
[18:21.760 --> 18:25.960]  tricombs blocked it that's why you and myself everybody else has to get
[18:25.960 --> 18:30.760]  prepared now do not wait it's not about the virus it's about the economic chaos
[18:30.760 --> 18:34.400]  that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year get your high
[18:34.400 --> 18:37.800]  quality storeable foods and then for short I calm they're available again
[18:37.800 --> 18:42.360]  before a limited time the food supply is running out there are major shortages
[18:42.360 --> 18:48.360]  this is a globalist siege a globalist lockdown globalist terrorism but we the
[18:48.360 --> 18:52.080]  people the Patriots have to be prepared we've already been proven right about

[19:06.600 --> 19:11.600]  at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions already starving
[19:11.600 --> 19:15.920]  because the global lockdown that is hundreds of times worse than all the
[19:15.920 --> 19:19.920]  deaths in the world caused by COVID-19 and the very people that cooked it up
[19:19.920 --> 19:23.680]  and gave it to the tricombs at the World Health Organization with Bill Gates
[19:23.680 --> 19:28.200]  involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society created
[19:28.200 --> 19:31.760]  depression and forcibly inoculate everybody this is insane ladies and
[19:31.760 --> 19:35.880]  gentlemen if they succeed it's over you need to get prepared now you need to get
[19:35.880 --> 19:40.280]  high-quality swarble food now back in stock at info or store dot com and you
[19:40.280 --> 19:44.280]  need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere big
[19:44.280 --> 19:47.760]  tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you
[19:47.760 --> 19:52.480]  can't even challenge verbally social distancing this is beyond 1984 the
[19:52.480 --> 19:55.680]  tyranny of the dual orders here get prepared now and spread the word in the
[19:55.680 --> 19:59.600]  info war you are the Paul Revere's
[19:59.600 --> 20:06.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:19.480 --> 20:27.600]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones if you had a
[20:27.600 --> 20:34.640]  checklist of about 20 things that take you from one to a 10 10 being total
[20:34.640 --> 20:40.640]  tyranny one being freedom of republic if you can keep it the USA land of the
[20:40.640 --> 20:46.440]  free home of the brave every one of the checkboxes for tyranny has now been
[20:46.440 --> 20:58.280]  checked and is warping to its most extreme incarnation the magnitude the
[20:58.280 --> 21:06.520]  magnitude of anyone protesting lock mounds martial law house arrest being
[21:06.520 --> 21:10.000]  banned off social media banned off internet communications banned off
[21:10.000 --> 21:15.080]  private messengers that's where this is all going now here is beyond North
[21:15.080 --> 21:21.240]  Korea and then medical doctors who have good licenses that are successful that
[21:21.240 --> 21:27.400]  are well-spoken say a bunch of stuff that's true and they are taken down not
[21:27.400 --> 21:35.040]  just on YouTube not just on Google they're taking it down everywhere it
[21:35.040 --> 21:41.960]  violates the community guidelines to not create fear so they've weaponized and
[21:41.960 --> 21:49.720]  patented the cold virus it gets rid old people that Bill Gates wants to they
[21:49.720 --> 21:52.880]  won't let you talk about what protects you that threaten to arrest if you talk
[21:52.880 --> 21:59.920]  about zinc or vitamin D3 or any of this that's where we've gone and then
[21:59.920 --> 22:04.040]  doctors get up and say you actually need to be in contact with pathogens to
[22:04.040 --> 22:07.560]  learn your immunity which is totally true people that are kept away from
[22:07.560 --> 22:12.320]  things the ones that are sickly their whole lives and those very doctors don't
[22:12.320 --> 22:15.360]  even have their speech in America on their own YouTube channel because it
[22:15.360 --> 22:19.880]  wasn't theirs it belongs to the globalist and they say oh just go start
[22:19.880 --> 22:23.320]  your own YouTube well we have banned off video and it's under constant attack I
[22:23.320 --> 22:27.360]  mean the level of attack you see is just the surface folks there's reasons I
[22:27.360 --> 22:32.800]  can't get into it but it's bad and it's again escalating at every level the
[22:32.800 --> 22:37.600]  secret police all of it and Trump has to level with the American people about
[22:37.600 --> 22:41.600]  this I know he's good he understands what's happening but it's really a bad
[22:41.600 --> 22:45.040]  situation and if you think I'm getting threatened imagine what's happening to
[22:45.040 --> 22:49.680]  Tucker Carlson there's Mayor de Blasio my message to Jewish community and all
[22:49.680 --> 22:55.960]  communities is this simple the time for warnings is past I've instructed the NY
[22:55.960 --> 23:00.000]  PD to proceed immediately to summons or even arrest those who gather in large
[23:00.000 --> 23:06.360]  groups this is about stopping the disease and saving lives period New York's
[23:06.360 --> 23:09.760]  incredibly corrupt one of the most corrupt cities in the world I'll tell
[23:09.760 --> 23:16.840]  you that it's just a fact on its face Primaphasia why do they have 50 times
[23:16.840 --> 23:24.080]  more COVID-19 deaths than Texas that's a big article up on info wars.com
[23:24.560 --> 23:28.640]  well it's a host of reasons but New York's totally jacked into the globalist
[23:28.640 --> 23:36.040]  stop and they count everyone dying as COVID to get the $40,000. Hospitals in
[23:36.040 --> 23:40.160]  Texas have so many moral people still working at them and there's so much of
[23:40.160 --> 23:44.360]  our probably owned and not globalist control that they're not doing that if
[23:44.360 --> 23:47.800]  you didn't die COVID they're not doing that in many states that's still how
[23:47.800 --> 23:51.760]  Texas in the Midwest and places work we don't just put our shoes on in the
[23:51.760 --> 23:55.800]  morning and you know think about being master villains no matter what you know
[23:55.800 --> 24:00.960]  the FBI people think living up in New York we're not you we built this country
[24:00.960 --> 24:05.720]  you understand that and I mean not white people I mean the idea of being a good
[24:05.720 --> 24:11.200]  hard-working person who doesn't lie cheat and steal 24-7 we're we I would be
[24:11.200 --> 24:18.320]  ashamed if I did anything like that New York is a heart of evil the rotten
[24:18.320 --> 24:27.440]  apple and it's got tentacles shooting out like cancer all over the United
[24:27.440 --> 24:30.640]  States a lot of good people in New York but there's an escape from New York
[24:30.640 --> 24:34.640]  everyone is fleeing it everyone's fleeing Los Angeles everyone's fleeing
[24:34.640 --> 24:38.200]  San Francisco they're fleeing Seattle they're fleeing Portland because you
[24:38.200 --> 24:46.640]  people stink you're evil and when God is not there evil comes in but there are
[24:46.640 --> 24:49.720]  some deaths there in New York because they're crammed together they're inside
[24:49.720 --> 24:56.960]  they're not getting their vitamin D from the Sun and what did mouth is say 250
[24:56.960 --> 25:03.600]  plus years ago look up mouth this is writings I've read them he said this is
[25:03.600 --> 25:08.680]  a British eugenicist exterminist pre-Hitler proto-Hitler Hitler's great
[25:08.680 --> 25:14.600]  granddaddy basically politically said herd all the poor into small compact
[25:14.600 --> 25:20.520]  areas build tall tenement buildings stacking them one on top of another so
[25:20.520 --> 25:29.960]  that disease famine is brought to them by fleas and rats so as to kill off the
[25:29.960 --> 25:34.960]  poor once and for all look it up I paraphrased it but it's almost word for
[25:34.960 --> 25:44.880]  word they want to kill you New York City is an extermination camp a giant
[25:44.880 --> 25:54.320]  reeducation camp a joke I I want to get to this Tucker Carlson news but I'm
[25:54.320 --> 25:57.280]  gonna do this now and then we'll go to break and then I'm gonna come back for
[25:57.280 --> 26:03.000]  the most powerful Tucker Carlson yet but I'm just gonna leave it at this if you
[26:03.000 --> 26:10.440]  don't understand the point we've reached you're insane the globalist are master
[26:10.440 --> 26:17.560]  villain criminals it's who they are it's what they do it's how they operate they
[26:17.560 --> 26:24.000]  don't ever stop they only get worse the most radical of the New World Order
[26:24.000 --> 26:28.800]  people aren't ever radical enough because then even more radicals take over it is a
[26:28.800 --> 26:36.480]  race to hell itself so I will tell you that I used to spend three percent of my
[26:36.480 --> 26:49.040]  time and energy with a emergency plan a evacuation plan now I spend 30% of my
[26:49.040 --> 26:55.500]  time now that's not giving up on the ship I knew this was coming I knew we
[26:55.500 --> 26:59.760]  said 2020 the year they said they'll launch their bio attacks to test the
[26:59.760 --> 27:02.400]  world government then they'll have bigger ones that come by 2030 most of us
[27:02.400 --> 27:05.760]  will be dead if they follow the plan and folks are following a plan here and I'm
[27:05.760 --> 27:09.960]  up here on here talking about this plan and anybody in the government or law
[27:09.960 --> 27:12.320]  enforcement wanted to go look this up they could look it up but then what are
[27:12.320 --> 27:17.080]  you gonna do realizing your bosses are part of a death cult and that Fauci and
[27:17.080 --> 27:21.640]  and all these people are officers in the death cult well you're just gonna tell
[27:21.640 --> 27:26.000]  yourselves it's not true and live in denial and just hope well you're part of
[27:26.000 --> 27:33.880]  the system so you know you're gonna be okay no you're not and God has given
[27:33.880 --> 27:38.440]  everybody a chance to see this coming and to be warned about it you I talk
[27:38.440 --> 27:43.320]  about tomorrow's news today next year's news today what about revelation the
[27:43.320 --> 27:49.800]  news of 2,000 years from now today we got warned about the takeover plan and
[27:49.800 --> 27:54.120]  it's proceeding exactly as they said they would do it and now we're here and
[27:54.120 --> 27:57.440]  they're not gonna let you have dignity they're not gonna let you have your
[27:57.440 --> 28:03.200]  children they're not gonna let you have grandchildren they're taking everything
[28:03.640 --> 28:11.320]  forever and I know why they've launched their operations even though they've
[28:11.320 --> 28:17.640]  been somewhat behind it's because they know we know they know we were choosing
[28:17.640 --> 28:20.560]  because God gives us a chance to choose your own adventure like those books they
[28:20.560 --> 28:23.520]  have different endings it goes to the same place basically but there's
[28:23.520 --> 28:29.560]  different ways to do it and people were breaking out on the new timeline that
[28:29.560 --> 28:35.480]  would bypass 90% of us and the dual orders like that we're not gonna let that
[28:35.480 --> 28:38.800]  happen because they know everybody's fleeing the cities they know you're
[28:38.800 --> 28:41.640]  getting into organics they know you're waking up what they're doing and they
[28:41.640 --> 28:46.380]  could see how they're gonna lose so they're gonna press it and bring in the
[28:46.380 --> 28:50.280]  most draconian systems in the name of saving their system and that will only
[28:50.280 --> 28:54.720]  accelerate the quickening of their fall so the birth pains are gonna start

[32:34.760 --> 32:37.560]  as soon as you put the handcuffs on they said oh it's just an extended spring
[32:37.560 --> 32:42.120]  break two weeks notice now it's 18 months two years five years it never ends
[32:42.120 --> 32:47.480]  no one can ever die from a virus again government will save you it's a takeover

[32:55.320 --> 32:59.640]  they're telling you it's gonna hurt a lot of people
[32:59.640 --> 33:09.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:22.640 --> 33:27.960]  welcome back my friends it's escape from the new world order and the new we
[33:27.960 --> 33:34.360]  have to admit we're against a very formidable enemy the second we actually
[33:34.360 --> 33:41.160]  study their own battle plans they're public their criminal operation is so
[33:41.160 --> 33:48.320]  fantastical it'll never succeed but you have to admit it's going on and you
[33:48.320 --> 33:52.640]  have to get prepared and you've got to become self-sufficient you need to start
[33:52.640 --> 33:55.800]  hiking you need to learn to skin a buck and run a truck line you need to grow a
[33:55.800 --> 33:59.520]  garden you need to just get outside and turn off the television you need to pray
[33:59.520 --> 34:04.120]  to God and get on your knees and ask God for guidance and ask God to lead you
[34:04.120 --> 34:10.960]  and direct you and God will do that you don't have to control it yourself you
[34:10.960 --> 34:14.960]  can't you have to turn it over to God and that's really my most important
[34:14.960 --> 34:19.080]  message and I will tell us there's this it's a symbiotic relationship to keep
[34:19.080 --> 34:22.240]  us here on air like you've done it's been amazing and we've done important
[34:22.240 --> 34:25.720]  work together staying on air to be here at this critical time they fought like
[34:25.720 --> 34:29.680]  the devil to get us off air they tried to buy me off everything else now they're
[34:29.680 --> 34:33.120]  threatened to kill me or put me in prison I don't submit to them but I can't
[34:33.120 --> 34:37.960]  submit because as scary as their threats are where they're taking us if I
[34:37.960 --> 34:43.840]  submit is much worse and so because we're able to see over the horizon and
[34:43.840 --> 34:48.600]  and know what's coming and we warn people and now it's here we have a lot
[34:48.600 --> 34:52.800]  of credibility you have a lot of credibility so you have to be leaders
[34:52.800 --> 34:57.440]  in your community and you have to expose the new order agenda however you see fit
[34:57.440 --> 35:00.840]  however God leads you and you first though got to get self-sufficient and
[35:00.840 --> 35:05.400]  that means success is not eating out of all those fancy restaurants success is
[35:05.400 --> 35:09.680]  not how cool your car is success is not you know strutting around in front of
[35:09.680 --> 35:13.600]  you know guys at the gym and you know you've got a hotter wife than they do
[35:13.600 --> 35:18.720]  success is being informed and involved in pro-human and the mission for our
[35:18.720 --> 35:23.320]  species to not just survive but thrive and then if you jack into that energy
[35:23.320 --> 35:28.160]  well then the whole universe opens up then your ancestors and your instincts
[35:28.160 --> 35:34.440]  open up because let me tell you in my experience people that are evil might
[35:34.440 --> 35:41.640]  be cunning and and and they've been given very twisted satanic direction the
[35:41.640 --> 35:46.080]  mystery of evil but they don't have access to God they don't have access to
[35:46.080 --> 35:49.880]  their real instincts that God gave us and they just have no idea what they're
[35:49.880 --> 35:54.720]  missing it's actually very very sad but if you just simply get on the path
[35:54.720 --> 35:59.640]  towards believing in humanity and not buying into the fake leftist version of
[35:59.640 --> 36:02.960]  their defending humanity they're saving humanity when everything they do is
[36:02.960 --> 36:06.840]  about saying humanity sucks humanity's a cancer we need to get rid of humanity
[36:06.840 --> 36:12.120]  men and women are bad families are bad the people that are happy suck well we
[36:12.120 --> 36:16.040]  all know it's a lie these are people that celebrate and go okay it is a baby
[36:16.040 --> 36:21.360]  inside the womb I love killing it I love taking his life it makes me feel
[36:21.360 --> 36:27.400]  important to snub it out like a cigarette take a crap on my own dead child I
[36:27.400 --> 36:32.640]  get sexual pleasure you know they they say this everywhere this this is imagine
[36:32.640 --> 36:36.120]  a satanic high priest saying we love killing this baby and taking its life
[36:36.120 --> 36:40.600]  and humiliating it and pissing on God and you think oh my god there's no such
[36:40.600 --> 36:45.600]  thing as Satan is doing that now they're publicly saying me and my
[36:45.600 --> 36:50.080]  boyfriend love to get pregnant he gets me pregnant we wait till the baby's
[36:50.080 --> 36:54.600]  kicking and everything else and then then we go and we swatter it and tear it
[36:54.600 --> 37:00.440]  pieces and I love it because I've got power you're just like what the hell you
[37:00.440 --> 37:04.240]  mean to play the clips here that I'm gonna read you the essays and the whole
[37:04.240 --> 37:09.360]  genre of porn that I didn't even know existed till last year when it was in
[37:09.360 --> 37:13.160]  the news I looked it up was like oh my god this isn't real and it was just
[37:13.160 --> 37:18.720]  Twitter is just full of of the pleasure of chopping your sons and daughters to
[37:18.720 --> 37:26.000]  death and writing sick HP Lovecraft get the clown inspired garbage about about
[37:26.000 --> 37:31.560]  how that child would have had hopes and dreams but you cut it in pieces because
[37:31.560 --> 37:38.720]  you have power for those of us that aren't jacked into that Satanism we
[37:38.720 --> 37:43.000]  can't even see that they're doing it because it's so alien it's so twisted
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.760]  but it is it's who they are and the average Democrat is now rapidly
[37:47.760 --> 37:51.760]  converting from a fake deceived bot that really believes they're gonna have
[37:51.760 --> 37:56.240]  succession money and power by being victims of the state and part of it to
[37:56.240 --> 38:01.920]  people that want to dominate and control and tear things down they have been
[38:01.920 --> 38:07.720]  given over under the first time I saw women at an abortion clinic when we were
[38:07.720 --> 38:13.880]  protesting at 25 years ago or so walk by and go I love Satan I love killing
[38:13.880 --> 38:16.480]  babies and back then I thought oh they're just doing that to mess with me
[38:16.480 --> 38:20.920]  because they know I'm a Christian no I've got hundreds of videos you've seen
[38:20.920 --> 38:26.320]  them here where they're just like I love Satan and I feel so good when I bring
[38:26.320 --> 38:31.040]  women here to be killed and I just the Satan gives me warm glowing love but
[38:31.040 --> 38:35.240]  that woman's in there and that child's having its brains vacuumed out and you're
[38:35.240 --> 38:38.400]  looking at a woman sitting there in a church lady outfit saying this you're
[38:38.400 --> 38:43.680]  like what is this this is someone jacked into pure evil who's gone folks
[38:43.680 --> 38:51.360]  they're gone and as their power grows our very existence enrages them so let
[38:51.360 --> 38:57.760]  me just say this right now we'll come back with Tucker Carlson if you're not
[38:57.760 --> 39:01.760]  getting prepared and if you're not getting ready in all the different ways
[39:01.760 --> 39:06.160]  that need to be done you're crazy and when I point that finger at you three
[39:06.160 --> 39:11.760]  of the fingers are pointed back at me I am absolutely understanding that you
[39:11.760 --> 39:15.200]  cannot save the general society you can reach out to some people try to wake
[39:15.200 --> 39:19.280]  them up that's great but you got to move on people ridicule you they attack you
[39:19.280 --> 39:23.920]  they're already too far gone folks just dust the dust off your feet let the
[39:23.920 --> 39:28.240]  dead bury the dead do not waste your time on them build up those that do care
[39:28.240 --> 39:32.880]  build up those that do have a chance build up yourself because I know as a
[39:32.880 --> 39:36.280]  person that loves God and I know you love God as well that you really feel for
[39:36.280 --> 39:41.040]  people you can't wake up broadcast the information everywhere but just move on
[39:41.040 --> 39:46.480]  from that point if they want to stay behind in this system this doom system
[39:46.480 --> 39:52.000]  that's their issue we got to protect ourselves and it's been the season of
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.080]  generally trying to wake folks up before this got here and now if folks aren't
[39:56.080 --> 40:00.960]  awake now you need to just move on and let me tell everybody else this those you
[40:00.960 --> 40:04.240]  that want to be in a bigger house or those of you that want to still be at
[40:04.240 --> 40:09.320]  the country club that's all gonna be gone soon and by the time the general
[40:09.320 --> 40:13.840]  public figures out that that America is gone with the wind and ain't ever coming
[40:13.840 --> 40:18.800]  back folks America broke its contract with God with with Roe v. Wade the
[40:18.800 --> 40:26.120]  judgment's coming and so once the general public figures out that we're in a
[40:26.120 --> 40:33.360]  long prolonged dystopic high-tech depression that just gets worse and
[40:33.360 --> 40:38.520]  worse and worse for many many many years out into the future they're going to
[40:38.520 --> 40:42.120]  freak out and be dangerous as hell you think you're seeing freak out and an
[40:42.120 --> 40:45.880]  increased crime now which has exploded armed robberies murders and all the
[40:45.880 --> 40:51.160]  blue states are up like 35 to 57 percent it's gonna be 500 percent 2,000
[40:51.160 --> 40:57.440]  percent you're gonna see hell on earth in my view and I've been holding back
[40:57.440 --> 41:01.800]  saying this but I just I hope we can back it off turn it back on it's too
[41:01.800 --> 41:06.120]  far gone we are there's gonna be wars you want famines folks you want to be
[41:06.120 --> 41:09.720]  scared they're gonna release real bio weapons so I'm just telling people you
[41:09.720 --> 41:13.240]  better get yourself together you better get together with your family you better
[41:13.240 --> 41:16.800]  do some research and you better get your asses like the pilgrims did out of
[41:16.800 --> 41:21.680]  corrupt Europe to the new world and the new world is the countryside and I'm
[41:21.680 --> 41:25.680]  just telling you you can't fix it these big cities are going down and it is
[41:25.680 --> 41:30.720]  really really sad but America's too satanic it's too far gone you just got
[41:30.720 --> 41:33.880]  to get together with your people and protect yourselves because it's gonna
[41:33.880 --> 41:36.960]  be absolutely hellish and you want to remove yourself from anywhere around
[41:36.960 --> 41:40.640]  leftist and I wouldn't try to wake them up I wouldn't even try to talk to them
[41:40.640 --> 41:46.280]  I've they're gone man they are satanic satanist period a good place to start
[41:46.280 --> 41:50.040]  as high-quality swarable foods we have them they've got a package them and get
[41:50.040 --> 41:54.080]  them out to you almost everybody else we know of it doesn't sound real to say
[41:54.080 --> 41:57.280]  no one else actually has food it is shipping it but no one that we've
[41:57.280 --> 42:02.240]  tested out actually did other than my patriot supply get your orders in now
[42:02.240 --> 42:05.920]  goes right into the queue in fact they even told us hey quite frankly take
[42:05.920 --> 42:11.200]  care your orders first I'm like wow the point is infowarstore.com infowarslife.com
[42:11.200 --> 42:16.280]  get your orders in now they have them and get your supplements and get your
[42:16.280 --> 42:21.640]  other products and boost your body's defenses in the best way you can but I
[42:21.640 --> 42:27.000]  just got to tell you for me it's just absolutely a very sad point to have to
[42:27.000 --> 42:33.040]  come to you and say that I don't think I about an 80% chance it's it's it's it's
[42:33.040 --> 42:38.080]  just it's all it's over and we might be able to turn things around maybe but
[42:38.080 --> 42:41.720]  America doesn't appreciate what Trump's trying to do they don't want to turn back
[42:41.720 --> 42:45.360]  on they want to be hurt really bad and the Democrats and the globalists will
[42:45.360 --> 42:49.920]  hurt your ass really bad so I'm telling you folks you to get prepared for the
[42:49.920 --> 42:53.720]  next great depression because they're gonna use food to control every aspect
[42:53.720 --> 42:58.720]  of your life this is a globalist Marxist takeover I'm always excited about
[42:58.720 --> 43:01.640]  infowarslife products they're amazing they're cutting-edge you love them I
[43:01.640 --> 43:06.000]  love them and they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught but
[43:06.000 --> 43:12.720]  we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing the
[43:12.720 --> 43:19.000]  only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.560]  top of it and there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour
[43:25.560 --> 43:31.120]  out a bunch of thick gross goo but it's high quality it aerosolizes it
[43:31.120 --> 43:35.560]  in a really great way I like to throw my hands rub a little bit on my face it's
[43:35.560 --> 43:39.480]  got organic alcohol in it so spray it right in your eyes but I just love it
[43:39.480 --> 43:43.960]  personally has something that's a moisturizer as well so this is a real
[43:43.960 --> 43:46.560]  innovation I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand
[43:46.560 --> 43:50.680]  sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out
[43:50.680 --> 44:01.960]  smells great it's so refreshing this is a big winner what our champions made of
[44:01.960 --> 44:05.920]  here's a man who can show you
[45:05.920 --> 45:10.660]  million are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the
[45:10.660 --> 45:14.940]  millions already starving because the global lockdown. That is hundreds of
[45:14.940 --> 45:19.180]  times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19 and the very
[45:19.180 --> 45:22.220]  people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health
[45:22.220 --> 45:27.060]  Organization with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to
[45:27.060 --> 45:30.900]  shut down society, create a depression and forcibly inoculate everybody. This is
[45:30.900 --> 45:35.140]  insane. Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over. You need to get
[45:35.140 --> 45:37.700]  prepared now. You need to get high-quality, swarble food now back in
[45:37.700 --> 45:42.100]  stock at infowarstore.com and you need to get politically active and
[45:42.100 --> 45:46.300]  challenge this verbally everywhere. Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right
[45:46.300 --> 45:49.780]  now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social
[45:49.780 --> 45:54.420]  distancing. This is beyond 1984. The tyranny of the dual orders here. Get
[45:54.420 --> 45:58.480]  prepared now and spread the word in the info war. You are the Paul Revere's.
[45:58.480 --> 46:03.920]  Well, Communist China would sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their
[46:03.920 --> 46:08.700]  energy used by half and the United States wouldn't sign on to it. So guess
[46:08.700 --> 46:13.380]  what happened? Along came COVID-19 and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's
[46:13.380 --> 46:17.540]  already cut your carbon footprint by half and that means you're gonna be
[46:17.540 --> 46:22.060]  poor now and under his control and of course with the medical tyranny comes
[46:22.060 --> 46:27.060]  the force inoculations, a eek microchip that comes with the vaccine and so much
[46:27.060 --> 46:32.420]  more and Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[46:32.420 --> 46:36.740]  So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your
[46:36.740 --> 46:40.980]  basic rights. The same left that says to kill babies all day long. Women own their
[46:40.980 --> 46:44.660]  bodies. Now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly
[46:44.660 --> 46:48.140]  inoculate you. If you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home,
[46:48.140 --> 46:52.660]  mark the beach. Oh, and guess what? Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang
[46:52.660 --> 46:56.260]  out together with Bill Gates under a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your
[46:56.260 --> 47:06.020]  face. They hate you and your family. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:09.060 --> 47:19.620]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:19.620 --> 47:24.580]  Alright, I'm gonna open the phones up in the next hour. Maybe another special guest
[47:24.580 --> 47:30.420]  in the studio the third hour. And I really want to do the best job I can and I
[47:30.420 --> 47:34.180]  don't want to be somebody that helps hurt the economy. They've even had big
[47:34.180 --> 47:38.060]  national news stories that are actually accurate that they tracked it and
[47:38.060 --> 47:43.140]  infowars and things like boost the stock market. There's a lot of people out
[47:43.140 --> 47:47.140]  there. Hear what we say. They know we do our research and already catalyzes what
[47:47.140 --> 47:53.020]  they already know to be true. And I don't say that this is gonna kill a lot of
[47:53.020 --> 47:58.340]  people. In fact, cue that up if you can. I don't air that enough where Trump five
[47:58.340 --> 48:03.700]  weeks ago said you want a lot of death. You keep this economy shut off. You're
[48:03.700 --> 48:07.660]  gonna see more death than you've ever imagined. And the UN came out and said
[48:07.660 --> 48:12.220]  130 plus million people are now gonna starve to death in the next year. It was
[48:12.220 --> 48:17.420]  33 million a week ago. And by the way, I don't just believe that you in those
[48:17.420 --> 48:20.860]  are real numbers. 10 million star of death every year. The third world's
[48:20.860 --> 48:25.900]  totally dependent on the first world. And you don't get food there. There's no
[48:25.900 --> 48:28.860]  safety net. You die.
[48:31.580 --> 48:36.740]  And so yeah, if we sit here and let 10s of millions of extra people starve to
[48:36.740 --> 48:41.340]  death because we're all getting into the fear of Fauci and gates and the mask
[48:41.340 --> 48:45.460]  and oh, we're heroes because we're going along with it and this big fake social
[48:45.460 --> 48:50.300]  wave, then you have aided and abetted all that death and you're gonna get a
[48:50.300 --> 48:53.900]  depression and you're gonna get your livelihood destroyed and you're gonna
[48:53.900 --> 48:57.140]  get giant crime rates and you're gonna get millions that die who can't get
[48:57.140 --> 49:03.540]  regular health care. And that's all confirmed now and medical doctors come
[49:03.540 --> 49:05.700]  out and they lay that out.
[49:05.700 --> 49:22.180]  And they get banned on YouTube. Just like Mount Cedar Sinai or the top hospitals
[49:22.180 --> 49:25.700]  in the world goes, yeah, you know, the president's talking about this like
[49:25.700 --> 49:30.500]  therapy. It works incredibly. We snake it down your throat. You're already
[49:30.500 --> 49:36.580]  innovated with fiber optic in the lungs and it kills it. They said, no, you're
[49:36.580 --> 49:40.740]  banned too. So because Bill Gates, who doesn't even have a medical degree,
[49:40.740 --> 49:46.060]  he's because he's bought off the media. This is his emergence. It's his super
[49:46.060 --> 49:49.300]  villain takeover. I told you was getting ready for this for decades. He's been
[49:49.300 --> 49:57.500]  the villain of my films because he is who I say he is. And right now they're
[49:57.500 --> 50:05.140]  like, you leave Bill Gates alone or we're going to indict you. Like put a gun
[50:05.140 --> 50:08.100]  to your head, help screw over the whole planet and kill everybody and bring or
[50:08.100 --> 50:13.220]  we're gonna get you. Okay, fine. I mean, it's not a threat because I know you're
[50:13.220 --> 50:17.780]  in game. I know who you are. I know what you're doing. My God.
[50:17.780 --> 50:29.100]  You think I just get up here and talk about Bill Gates and IBM and just like
[50:29.100 --> 50:33.500]  that. Just saying these things. He actually runs the World Eugenics Society.
[50:34.500 --> 50:39.300]  Seven Robert Barron families from the US alone, the British world, he's funding
[50:39.300 --> 50:46.340]  it to funded Bill Gates's father to combine them into one super group. And
[50:46.340 --> 50:49.700]  they put they go, oh, let's have a kid headed up. Let's have Bill. So he's the
[50:49.700 --> 50:56.100]  trendy, you know, in the 1980s popping up. That's what this is. You don't play
[50:56.100 --> 51:01.380]  games with these people and everyone's so scared of them and no one will call
[51:01.380 --> 51:04.780]  them out. I don't wish any harm against Bill Gates. That could turn him into a
[51:04.780 --> 51:09.060]  martyr. I want what he represents stopped. I want the project of the New
[51:09.060 --> 51:14.820]  World Order killed. I do not want Bill Gates harmed. That's a perfect move for
[51:14.820 --> 51:17.780]  them. I think I predict they'll they'll have an attempt at assassination of
[51:17.780 --> 51:21.780]  Gates or something to make him a hero and a victim. That is not us and I have
[51:21.780 --> 51:26.580]  nothing to do with that. The last thing we want is any harm to Hillary Clinton,
[51:26.580 --> 51:30.460]  Obama, Bill Gates or any of these people. All right, let's go ahead and go to
[51:30.460 --> 51:33.020]  part of Tucker Carlson last night where he knocks it out of the park. He was on
[51:33.020 --> 51:39.940]  fire. We'll start the next hour. First time callers 877-789-2539-877-789
[51:39.940 --> 51:49.940]  Alex 877-789-2539 as the dystopia becomes reality. But we could turn the tide
[51:49.940 --> 51:53.020]  now. Now is the critical time and their whole house of cards, their whole hype
[51:53.020 --> 51:56.940]  is teetering. It's so close to failing. People are seeing through it. All the
[51:56.940 --> 52:00.940]  professionals are coming out and saying this is all a big hoax and they're being
[52:00.940 --> 52:07.020]  silenced. Alex Jones two years ago now medical doctors today. Here it is. Good
[52:07.020 --> 52:10.460]  evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. Last night on this show we
[52:10.460 --> 52:14.220]  played you a clip from a nearly hour long video produced by two physicians in
[52:14.220 --> 52:20.020]  California, doctors Dan Erickson and Arton Masihi. Likely many of you had
[52:20.020 --> 52:24.700]  already seen it. That video has had more than 5 million views on YouTube. In their
[52:24.700 --> 52:28.580]  presentation the two doctors presented a flurry of data pointing to what we are
[52:28.580 --> 52:32.700]  currently learning about this virus and how it spreads. They recited pages of
[52:32.700 --> 52:35.940]  government statistics and then interpreted them in light of their own
[52:35.940 --> 52:40.580]  long clinical experience as doctors. At one point they noted that the newly
[52:40.580 --> 52:43.740]  adjusted death rate in their state of California, which is much lower than
[52:43.740 --> 52:47.940]  anyone expected it to be, and they asked if government officials there should
[52:47.940 --> 52:56.100]  change their policies based on this new science. Watch. We've seen 1,227 deaths in
[52:56.100 --> 53:02.460]  the state of California with a possible incidence or prevalence of 4.7
[53:02.460 --> 53:07.220]  million. That means you have a 0.03 chance of dying from COVID-19 in the
[53:07.220 --> 53:13.620]  state of California. 0.03 chance of dying from COVID in the state of
[53:13.620 --> 53:19.620]  California. Is that, does that necessitate sheltering in place? Does that
[53:19.620 --> 53:24.220]  necessitate shutting down medical systems? Does that necessitate people
[53:24.220 --> 53:30.580]  being out of work? So whatever your view of the mass quarantines and maybe
[53:30.580 --> 53:33.940]  your enthusiastically for them, the questions you just heard are valid
[53:33.940 --> 53:37.460]  questions. In fact, they're critical questions. We should all be asking those
[53:37.460 --> 53:42.700]  questions, including and especially our policymakers. But as Dr. Erickson pointed
[53:42.700 --> 53:46.780]  out later in the video, dissent of any kind is no longer tolerated in this
[53:46.780 --> 53:52.380]  country. Fact-based honesty, which is the soul of science, is under attack even in
[53:52.380 --> 53:56.340]  hospitals. Dr. Erickson described physicians being pressured to classify
[53:56.340 --> 54:00.420]  illnesses and deaths as related to coronavirus. Whether they believe that to
[54:00.420 --> 54:07.180]  be true or not. We aren't pressured to test for flu, but ER doctors now, my
[54:07.180 --> 54:10.780]  friends that I talked to say, you know, it's interesting when I'm when I'm
[54:10.780 --> 54:16.260]  writing up my death report, I'm being pressured to add COVID. Why is that? Why
[54:16.260 --> 54:20.460]  are we being pressured to add COVID to maybe increase the numbers and make it
[54:20.460 --> 54:26.740]  look a little bit worse than it is? I think so. So what you just heard what
[54:26.740 --> 54:33.060]  Dr. Erickson described is called lying and lying has no place in science ever.
[54:33.060 --> 54:36.900]  It's scary to think it takes place on a large scale in hospitals. He says it
[54:36.900 --> 54:41.860]  does. Viewers of Erickson's video were shocked and transfixed by this. They
[54:41.860 --> 54:45.020]  forwarded the video to friends who forwarded on to their friends and
[54:45.020 --> 54:49.420]  suddenly millions of people who spent the last six weeks on a diet of Tiger King
[54:49.420 --> 54:53.580]  and internet memes were watching sober minded medical researchers reading
[54:53.580 --> 54:57.860]  from charts of statistics. It's hard to recall a science video taking off like
[54:57.860 --> 55:01.820]  this one did. Not everyone was impressed by it. Some criticized the doctor's
[55:01.820 --> 55:05.580]  policy conclusions. And of course, that's fair. Decent people have different
[55:05.580 --> 55:09.020]  opinions. We're not entirely certain what the perfect response to this
[55:09.020 --> 55:13.460]  pandemic is. Nobody is certain. There's no objective answer at the moment. At
[55:13.460 --> 55:18.900]  best, we can plot along with open minds and good faith. More informed debate is
[55:18.900 --> 55:23.740]  exactly what we need to make wise decisions going forward. Unfortunately for
[55:23.740 --> 55:27.700]  all of us informed debate is exactly what the authorities don't want. They
[55:27.700 --> 55:31.220]  want unquestioned obedience. When we come back, I'm going to get to the really key
[55:31.220 --> 55:35.180]  part he's starting to get to here. But let me explain. I could do this. You
[55:35.180 --> 55:37.740]  could do this. And that's why you should all when you see something like these
[55:37.740 --> 55:41.940]  doctors, you shoot your own video and then add a clip of them. Anybody can do
[55:41.940 --> 55:44.900]  this with video editors. Now, I don't care if you're an old lady, an old man, a
[55:44.900 --> 55:50.460]  young man, black, white, polka-dotted, you have to get in the info war. And you
[55:50.460 --> 55:56.860]  can go get USA Today, where they admit what we told you with guests a month
[55:56.860 --> 56:04.020]  ago. The federal government gives $100 billion out to hospitals if they say
[56:04.020 --> 56:14.860]  it's COVID-19. You get $40,000 if you say it's COVID-19 without any
[56:14.860 --> 56:18.980]  tests. Forget faulty tests that are false positive. You've had the flu the
[56:18.980 --> 56:22.540]  last two years or a regular cold that's coronavirus. That's what
[56:22.540 --> 56:28.180]  coronavirus is. It's a cold. That's confirmed. USA Today had to say, oh,
[56:28.180 --> 56:33.140]  actually, Snopes is wrong. Oh my God, the God Snopes. Couple of cat people,
[56:33.700 --> 56:37.140]  literal weirdos. I think people have cats. You know what I mean? Like literally
[56:37.140 --> 56:41.100]  people in the apartment with a couple cats. We can say reality are ruling true
[56:41.100 --> 56:45.900]  because it is true. You get five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 times the money
[56:45.900 --> 56:49.780]  and you say it's COVID-19. So of course the damn hospitals are saying that if
[56:49.780 --> 56:53.860]  they're getting $39,000 or more extra from the federal government because you
[56:53.860 --> 56:58.060]  dealt with a COVID-19 patient. Do you think the hospital administrators or
[56:58.060 --> 57:04.500]  owners are going to tell doctors to say COVID-19? You bet you'll ask. They did.
[57:04.540 --> 57:10.460]  No matter what color your butt is, that's what they're doing. And that's
[57:10.460 --> 57:15.940]  how they incentivize this from the beginning as a payoff. And these
[57:15.940 --> 57:22.620]  doctors say that and now they've been banned. So see, we take it to the next
[57:22.620 --> 57:24.740]  level, not just Tucker saying, hey, they have a right to say whether they're
[57:24.740 --> 57:29.140]  right or wrong, but they're right. And that's why they're banned. Because when
[57:29.140 --> 57:33.780]  you tell the truth, that's when they shut you down. But we, the people still
[57:33.780 --> 57:36.700]  have time to beat this. You understand what a mission is? We have that whole
[57:36.700 --> 57:42.100]  band press conference at band.video. Get in there, share it. This isn't just a
[57:42.100 --> 57:46.260]  regular time we're in. You are the answer. You are the resistance.
[57:47.700 --> 57:54.620]  And all of a sudden, the trap snaps inside. Hundreds and hundreds and
[57:54.620 --> 57:59.300]  hundreds of years, going back to Magna Carta in 1215 of hard fought, basic
[57:59.300 --> 58:03.900]  human dignity and liberty and believing that the individual was sovereign and
[58:03.900 --> 58:11.620]  had basic, unenable rights has been absolutely erased. And the Communist
[58:11.620 --> 58:17.740]  Chinese have been our teachers and Big Tech has been our controllers. We're
[58:17.740 --> 58:22.700]  all being introduced now. The digital straight jacket that depends on us
[58:22.700 --> 58:27.980]  complying with it and depends on us all in pecking each other into
[58:27.980 --> 58:31.860]  submission. But for all of you out there that have decided to go along with
[58:31.860 --> 58:35.940]  this, mark your calendars down. And then a few months, a few years, look at the
[58:35.940 --> 58:41.060]  world. Remember, you did this. You were the prisoners, you were the slaves, you
[58:41.060 --> 58:44.820]  were the people that crouched down and licked the hand that fed you. Ask for
[58:44.820 --> 58:47.100]  me, give me liberty or give me death.
[58:48.900 --> 58:54.020]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor. But I still need my morning coffee.
[58:55.100 --> 58:59.940]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stock full of
[58:59.940 --> 59:05.820]  high quality Info Wars store Patriot blend coffee. Grown in the high mountains

[59:45.940 --> 59:49.980]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[59:58.980 --> 1:00:03.780]  I don't want to let him leave it. You've been doing great. Oh, and you're going
[1:00:03.780 --> 1:00:07.140]  to finish up with these calls within Gregory's. And of course, Harrison
[1:00:07.140 --> 1:00:10.940]  Smith, they're going to take another hour calls. Cruz volunteered to do it. So
[1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:12.460]  we're here live covering.
[1:00:12.460 --> 1:00:16.140]  This hoping everything de-escalates. So the live covers continues. Everybody
[1:00:16.140 --> 1:00:19.300]  spread those links. The globals are hacking us. Trying to shut this down.
[1:00:19.300 --> 1:00:23.140]  Don't let him win. No BS. Everything straight shooting here. See, I don't
[1:00:23.140 --> 1:00:27.180]  have some Matthew Valley manipulative view with me. It's all straight forward
[1:00:27.180 --> 1:00:33.580]  attack. That's the real power. Don't act so surprised. Globalist, you didn't
[1:00:33.580 --> 1:00:39.100]  think you could silence the American people. Did you join band off video and
[1:00:39.100 --> 1:00:43.660]  I will complete your training together. We can overthrow the emperor and
[1:00:43.660 --> 1:01:11.780]  together we can overthrow the emperor and restore the republic. All right, folks, your phone calls are coming up next segment. There's definitely, I just keep having trouble breathing. I just sit back and I'm like, my God, it's everything we said it was and worse is exactly what we thought the attack
[1:01:11.780 --> 1:01:17.420]  probably be because they said they do it. Now they've done it. And all these people are
[1:01:17.420 --> 1:01:24.220]  scared and and don't want to face it. A lot of folks are awake and saying, No, let's
[1:01:24.220 --> 1:01:27.180]  finish up a Tucker Carlson getting into the medical doctors. We just trying to
[1:01:27.180 --> 1:01:32.420]  five million views on YouTube way more than that on other platforms and they're
[1:01:32.420 --> 1:01:37.460]  taking it down everywhere. I mean, think about if you heard like, Yeah, North Korea
[1:01:37.460 --> 1:01:40.460]  doctors gave a press conference and said things were better than what the
[1:01:40.460 --> 1:01:43.540]  government was saying. So they took the video down. You're like, I was down North
[1:01:43.540 --> 1:01:49.260]  Koreans. This is America. I mean, Facebook, Twitter, Google, they're all taking down
[1:01:49.260 --> 1:01:55.420]  an admitted staffer who filed complaints decades ago and is a real woman that says
[1:01:55.420 --> 1:02:00.460]  Joe Biden raped her sexually assaulted her. They're just monsters, man, just like
[1:02:00.460 --> 1:02:11.020]  they covered up for Epstein and and and for a Hollywood, you know, director. The
[1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:20.020]  Amphrodite, what's his name? Weinstein. I could buying the names Epstein. Who's the
[1:02:20.020 --> 1:02:23.900]  guy just got convicted in New York or raping women? Harvey Weinstein. Yeah.
[1:02:23.900 --> 1:02:27.260]  You know, I was thinking what the grossest place in the universe says Harvey
[1:02:27.260 --> 1:02:35.900]  Weinstein's vagina. Like they put a bullet to your head and they said they
[1:02:35.900 --> 1:02:41.220]  used to call these women and and he would make a massage him and like worship
[1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:46.540]  him and and and and and and then sponge him and then tell him how beautiful he
[1:02:46.540 --> 1:02:50.140]  was and he didn't want to have sex with these beautiful women. He wanted to
[1:02:50.140 --> 1:02:56.620]  demoralize them and suck energy off like imagine the kind of demon he is. I guess
[1:02:56.620 --> 1:03:01.580]  he was mad that he was born as a Amphrodite and was pretty pissed. I guess
[1:03:01.580 --> 1:03:08.460]  he's imbred. So all these imbred folks are just crazy. So he's a Amphrodite. Then
[1:03:08.460 --> 1:03:14.660]  you've got you know, folks, this is not a joke. Harvey Weinstein has a vagina.
[1:03:14.660 --> 1:03:22.460]  Sounds like the beginning of a new Hunter S. Thompson article, right? But this
[1:03:22.460 --> 1:03:25.980]  isn't this isn't fiction, ladies and gentlemen. I'm not trying to be gross for
[1:03:25.980 --> 1:03:34.300]  a sock job. Epstein, let's not get into his deformities, but they're
[1:03:34.300 --> 1:03:39.540]  disgusting. And again, these people, that's why they want to mess with us
[1:03:39.540 --> 1:03:43.900]  because they go over flyover country. You can be white, black, Hispanic, old,
[1:03:43.900 --> 1:03:48.140]  young. You're not inbred like Prince Charles. Same type of problems. He
[1:03:48.140 --> 1:03:51.420]  doesn't like the fact that you're not inbred and don't have nightmares all
[1:03:51.420 --> 1:03:57.340]  night like he does. And Epstein's pissed, you know, he wants, he wants women to
[1:03:57.340 --> 1:04:04.420]  worship his penis. It looks like Humpty Dumpty. All right, let's just stop right
[1:04:04.420 --> 1:04:10.540]  there. Humpty Dumpty, man sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. All the
[1:04:10.540 --> 1:04:13.900]  King's horses and all the King's men couldn't put the New World Order back
[1:04:13.900 --> 1:04:18.540]  together again. And then the reason I got into all these gross topics is that's
[1:04:18.540 --> 1:04:22.620]  the whole stack I was not going to get to. Hillary has reappeared with Joe Biden
[1:04:22.620 --> 1:04:26.700]  who was falling asleep during the interview. They've got like the camera
[1:04:26.700 --> 1:04:30.340]  all blurred. So she was like, she's five trillion years old. And there she is
[1:04:30.340 --> 1:04:35.860]  enabling another rapist pervert. That was her first job with a law degree was
[1:04:35.860 --> 1:04:41.140]  to ghost protect pedophiles. So they have a young woman as their defense
[1:04:41.140 --> 1:04:44.580]  attorney. That's what she's like a Wrenfield that brings children to
[1:04:44.580 --> 1:04:49.580]  vampires. So burning hell, woman.
[1:04:53.860 --> 1:04:54.700]  You will
[1:04:56.300 --> 1:05:01.140]  authoritarian across the planet want the power to be able to tell you to stay in
[1:05:01.140 --> 1:05:05.460]  your houses and don't leave and only go where they tell you can go. It's called
[1:05:05.620 --> 1:05:09.380]  martial law. It's called living in the authoritarian country. Everybody knows
[1:05:09.380 --> 1:05:13.580]  that. Everybody understands that the Democrats have now shown their hands
[1:05:13.580 --> 1:05:17.500]  with the deep state saying, we're going to listen to Fauci and the World Health
[1:05:17.500 --> 1:05:22.100]  Organization who've done nothing but put out all this faked disinformation so far.
[1:05:22.100 --> 1:05:24.740]  We're not going to listen to the president. We're not going to listen to
[1:05:24.740 --> 1:05:29.180]  Congress. But then all these other corporations are going to work in tandem
[1:05:29.180 --> 1:05:34.500]  with big tech to surveil and control and keep things shut down. This is economic
[1:05:34.500 --> 1:05:38.620]  warfare. And I know everybody understands that public with the president and others
[1:05:38.620 --> 1:05:43.900]  need to develop a plan to understand that this is a global corporate civil war
[1:05:43.900 --> 1:05:49.260]  and that we're being held hostage. And this is a mutiny against our country by
[1:05:49.260 --> 1:05:54.380]  globalist forces. Only understanding the reality and the magnitude of that gives
[1:05:54.380 --> 1:05:55.900]  us any chance of defeating it.
[1:05:55.900 --> 1:06:07.100]  I think you can really be a gangster, huh? You got what it takes, huh? Roll with the big boys.
[1:06:11.100 --> 1:06:18.300]  You know, the left sees me as Godzilla wrapped in Darth Vader. And that's because
[1:06:18.300 --> 1:06:22.940]  they believe their own propaganda. All I'm doing is exposing the horrible assy
[1:06:22.940 --> 1:06:27.340]  things they're involved in. And so the devastation that that exposure causes
[1:06:27.340 --> 1:06:30.300]  them, they then attribute to me when they're the ones that committed these
[1:06:30.300 --> 1:06:35.180]  incredible crimes. And so now they tell me, we're going to kill your ass or put
[1:06:35.180 --> 1:06:38.380]  you in prison. And they're trying right now. And I'm just like, okay, you'll still
[1:06:38.380 --> 1:06:42.780]  be losers led by the Crip Keeper and Nancy Pelosi and Hillary and all these other
[1:06:42.780 --> 1:06:49.820]  insane weirdos and G.G. Payne. And we're in martial law. We're all going to take
[1:06:49.820 --> 1:06:54.140]  force inculations with the evil elf. Bill Gates hopping around giving speeches
[1:06:54.140 --> 1:06:57.820]  about depopulation. And I'm supposed to trust him when they give me a vaccine.
[1:06:57.820 --> 1:07:03.660]  Okay, fine. You can destroy Alex Jones. But all you'll do is water the tree of
[1:07:03.660 --> 1:07:07.980]  liberty. But that is what Thomas Jefferson said. It's got to be water with the blood of
[1:07:09.180 --> 1:07:14.540]  patriots like Colonel William Barrett Travis and Tyrants.
[1:07:14.540 --> 1:07:20.540]  And the thing about water and trees with patriots blood is, it just seems to create
[1:07:20.540 --> 1:07:25.740]  a harvest of blood for Tyrants. And that's why in the final equation, I'm not worried
[1:07:25.740 --> 1:07:31.980]  because I'm right where I'm supposed to be opposing you. So for myself, the rest
[1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:37.020]  are for humanity. To all you globalist, you're losers, you're going to fail.
[1:07:37.020 --> 1:07:47.020]  You're going to fail. Humanities awakening. And you're going to burn it out.
[1:08:00.780 --> 1:08:04.380]  Lights out, America. Your life is over. Don't leave your house.
[1:08:04.380 --> 1:08:10.620]  The virus is going to kill 5 million. 5 million this weekend only.
[1:08:12.140 --> 1:08:15.740]  And then 3 million, 2 million, a million. Okay, all our projections are wrong.
[1:08:15.740 --> 1:08:20.700]  Let's worship those that lie to us and that work at the Wuhan lab, the head of the Facebook
[1:08:20.700 --> 1:08:25.260]  fact checkers. And oh, turns out all these governors and Democrats are making money off
[1:08:25.260 --> 1:08:35.260]  the COVID-19 test. Bill and Melinda Gates have got their fingerprints all over. It's not like
[1:08:35.260 --> 1:08:39.820]  fingerprints. It's like Bill Gates' hands are like glued. You walk up Bill Gates is like right
[1:08:39.820 --> 1:08:44.780]  there. Oh, hi. He's running it right in front of you. All right, I want to go to your phone
[1:08:44.780 --> 1:08:48.460]  calls. I want to get to all the news, but Tucker Cross did a great report, full reports
[1:08:48.460 --> 1:08:55.180]  at infowords.com and newswords.com. And he covered last night that the
[1:08:59.260 --> 1:09:02.380]  two medical doctors that came out and read real statistics and real numbers
[1:09:03.340 --> 1:09:11.980]  were then banned off of YouTube for having a press conference because that's a message
[1:09:11.980 --> 1:09:16.220]  to everybody else. You shut down and you shut up just like China and you do what you're told.
[1:09:16.220 --> 1:09:20.380]  That's what Tucker Carlson says. And that's on the headline that we are now becoming
[1:09:20.380 --> 1:09:26.780]  communist China. Here it is. Unfortunately for all of us, informed debate is exactly what the
[1:09:26.780 --> 1:09:32.060]  authorities don't want. They want unquestioned obedience. So they're cracking down on free
[1:09:32.060 --> 1:09:37.100]  expression. Last night, the doctor's video, the one you just saw was pulled off of YouTube,
[1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:42.540]  the largest video hosting site in the world. It wasn't an accident. YouTube admitted doing it.
[1:09:42.540 --> 1:09:46.940]  The company cited a violation of, quote, community guidelines and they did not apologize.
[1:09:47.900 --> 1:09:52.940]  Looking back when all of this is finally over and it will be, it's likely we'll see this moment
[1:09:52.940 --> 1:09:58.140]  what YouTube just did as a turning point in the way we live in this country, a sharp break
[1:09:58.140 --> 1:10:04.460]  with 250 years of law and custom. The two doctors video was produced by a local television channel
[1:10:04.460 --> 1:10:10.380]  in California. It was in effect a mainstream news story. The video was not pornographic,
[1:10:10.380 --> 1:10:14.700]  didn't violate copyright or incite violence or commit libel. It didn't break any law.
[1:10:15.420 --> 1:10:20.460]  The only justification for taking it down was that the two physicians on screen
[1:10:20.460 --> 1:10:23.500]  had reached different conclusions from the people currently in charge.
[1:10:24.300 --> 1:10:30.460]  It was a form of dissent from orthodoxy. YouTube and its parent company, Google,
[1:10:30.460 --> 1:10:34.620]  have now officially banned dissent. The CEO of YouTube admitted that openly.
[1:10:34.620 --> 1:10:41.500]  But then we also talk about removing information that is problematic. Of course,
[1:10:41.500 --> 1:10:45.980]  anything that is medically unsubstantiated, so people saying like take vitamin C,
[1:10:48.140 --> 1:10:52.380]  take turmeric, like those all will cure you. Those are the examples of things that would
[1:10:52.380 --> 1:10:57.260]  be a violation of our policy. Anything that would go against World Health Organization
[1:10:57.260 --> 1:11:00.300]  recommendations would be a violation of our policy. Back that up.
[1:11:00.300 --> 1:11:11.100]  When you see the headlines, they go, Jones claims that his zinc pill cures you or Jones claims his
[1:11:11.100 --> 1:11:15.740]  turmeric cures you. We never said that. I've been selling turmeric for many years. Everybody
[1:11:15.740 --> 1:11:20.300]  knows turmeric is great. It boosts your immune system on record. But see, that's what they do.
[1:11:20.300 --> 1:11:26.220]  They misrepresent. They go, it's a scam. It's false hope. He says he's got to cure, arrest him.
[1:11:26.220 --> 1:11:33.180]  And so that's how she misrepresents. Oh, you know, if the World Health Organization says it,
[1:11:33.180 --> 1:11:38.540]  that's where we get it. So Cedar Sinai can say, oh, no, we're doing a study with light and lungs.
[1:11:38.540 --> 1:11:44.540]  It really helps. Oh, sorry, you're not the UN, are you? Oh, no, we're just an American company.
[1:11:44.540 --> 1:11:47.900]  By the way, the head of YouTube, her and her sister are heavily invested in big pharma.
[1:11:47.900 --> 1:11:53.020]  Vaccines, all of it. These are monster corporate people. But they put them up there because she
[1:11:53.020 --> 1:11:59.260]  seems to your epigenetics like a woman. This is no woman. Oh, hi. I'm making some sandwiches or,
[1:11:59.260 --> 1:12:02.700]  you know, we're going to go to this key resort or we're going to go for a walk in the park or we're
[1:12:02.700 --> 1:12:07.420]  going to go out and make cupcakes or whatever. She puts on a whole act when she is a monster.
[1:12:08.300 --> 1:12:11.660]  So they trained you to ban Alex Jones and now it's medical doctors.
[1:12:13.740 --> 1:12:18.380]  And she's saying she works for the UN who funds the WHO, Bill and Melinda Gates.
[1:12:18.380 --> 1:12:22.780]  So if you disagree with what Bill and Melinda Gates have said, we'll ban you. And if you try to
[1:12:22.780 --> 1:12:26.700]  protest and say you want your country turned back on, she's not going to let that happen either.
[1:12:26.700 --> 1:12:34.060]  This is outrageous. And so now I say this. And I thought about how to phrase this
[1:12:35.900 --> 1:12:40.780]  because we don't want Trump to be removed. We know Trump overall is a good guy, but is he retarded?
[1:12:40.780 --> 1:12:50.220]  This is organized combines of media, watching and surveilling their users, censoring them in
[1:12:50.220 --> 1:12:55.340]  live time and telling them you can't demonstrate, you can't organize, and you can't have medical
[1:12:55.340 --> 1:12:59.020]  doctors on talking about what they're experiencing when it's on local news.
[1:13:01.180 --> 1:13:07.340]  It'd be like, communist China censors local news. That's what this is. But it's Google and YouTube
[1:13:07.340 --> 1:13:11.020]  and these monsters, these people are incredibly dangerous.
[1:13:14.380 --> 1:13:18.300]  But it's like, oh, we're women. So we're allowed to be tyrannical. It's our time now.
[1:13:18.300 --> 1:13:22.780]  And they're just fronts for corrupt evil men. Here, let's finish up with it.
[1:13:23.420 --> 1:13:26.140]  Examples of things that would be a violation of our policy.
[1:13:27.100 --> 1:13:30.940]  Anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would be a violation
[1:13:30.940 --> 1:13:35.740]  of our policy. And so remove is another really important part of our policy.
[1:13:35.740 --> 1:13:38.780]  So you're not just putting in the truth next to the lie,
[1:13:38.780 --> 1:13:41.180]  you're taking the lie down. That's a pretty aggressive approach.
[1:13:41.180 --> 1:13:44.780]  Should I pause again? Brian Stelter posing, trying to act like an authoritative guy,
[1:13:46.300 --> 1:13:49.260]  up there saying, oh, it's just a lie.
[1:13:53.020 --> 1:13:58.220]  They define you as a lie. These doctors are liars. Brian Stelter just said so.
[1:13:59.900 --> 1:14:02.140]  That's a pretty aggressive approach. Let's continue.
[1:14:02.140 --> 1:14:10.860]  We're removing, quote, anything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations.
[1:14:10.860 --> 1:14:13.420]  It'll now be taken off the internet. Consider that for a minute.
[1:14:13.980 --> 1:14:19.820]  As a matter just of science, it's ludicrous. Like everyone else involved in global pandemic
[1:14:19.820 --> 1:14:24.620]  policy, the WHO has often been wrong in its recommendations. A lot of people have.
[1:14:24.620 --> 1:14:29.740]  In mid January, WHO told us that coronavirus could not spread from person to person.
[1:14:29.740 --> 1:14:34.620]  In March, they told us that face masks didn't work. Those were lies and they were welcome on
[1:14:34.620 --> 1:14:39.020]  Google's platforms. Doctors who were actually treating patients with the virus, meanwhile,
[1:14:39.020 --> 1:14:45.580]  have just been banned. So no, this is not about science. Censorship never is about science.
[1:14:45.580 --> 1:14:51.500]  It's about power. Big technology companies are using this tragedy to increase their power over
[1:14:51.500 --> 1:14:56.220]  the American population. They're working in concert with politicians in order to do it.
[1:14:56.220 --> 1:15:00.540]  Just today, Facebook removed an events page for a political protest in Michigan.
[1:15:00.540 --> 1:15:03.980]  Governor Gresham Whitmer, who runs the state, was no doubt pleased to see it.
[1:15:03.980 --> 1:15:08.460]  Grossly mismanaging an entire state is a lot easier when citizens are not allowed
[1:15:08.460 --> 1:15:12.700]  to complain about it. And now they're not. Last week, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg
[1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:17.900]  explained that protests like these are no longer protected political speech. They're, quote,
[1:15:17.900 --> 1:15:41.500]  misinformation.
[1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:46.700]  Harmful misinformation. That is a phrase familiar to anyone who is watching.
[1:15:46.700 --> 1:15:50.140]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen. I'm worried about your phone calls, but it just gets
[1:15:50.140 --> 1:16:17.420]  worse from there. This is the total takeover.
[1:16:17.420 --> 1:16:21.180]  Let's face it, even the mainline media is talking about food supply disruptions,
[1:16:21.180 --> 1:16:25.340]  and the growing number of grocery store workers who are becoming sick. But there's more. Meat
[1:16:25.340 --> 1:16:30.620]  packing plants are closing, mile long lines at food pantries, and more farmers now in financial
[1:16:30.620 --> 1:16:35.660]  trouble. The truth is, growing nutrient dense vegetables this summer may be the single most
[1:16:35.660 --> 1:16:41.580]  important thing you do. Go to survivalseedbank.com and watch the new video to understand what we're

[1:17:56.380 --> 1:18:01.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, M4s can now offer high quality, storable food again.
[1:18:01.020 --> 1:18:07.580]  Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago and they told people they had food. Most
[1:18:07.580 --> 1:18:13.980]  folks never would deliver their food. Well, when our sponsors' food began to run short,
[1:18:13.980 --> 1:18:19.180]  they just extended sales till they opened more factories and secured more food. So if you eat
[1:18:19.180 --> 1:18:24.700]  your orders in right now, they can take new orders and get it to you quickly. They'll probably have
[1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:30.620]  to suspend orders very, very soon again because the lockdown of the economy is killing food
[1:18:30.620 --> 1:18:35.580]  distribution, farming, you name it, and now it's mainstream news that food shortages and delivery
[1:18:35.580 --> 1:18:41.980]  are already starting to happen. If Trump could turn the economy back on and rest control of our
[1:18:41.980 --> 1:18:46.380]  system away from the globalist, things may be okay, but it looks like it's going to get very,
[1:18:46.380 --> 1:18:50.700]  very rough. So again, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure the number one thing you need.
[1:18:50.700 --> 1:18:54.940]  High quality, storable food ready to get to you and your family now to get your orders in at
[1:18:54.940 --> 1:18:59.900]  forestore.com. I'm always excited about InfoWars live products. They're amazing. They're cutting
[1:18:59.900 --> 1:19:04.060]  edge. You love them. I love them. And they find the info or in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[1:19:04.860 --> 1:19:08.860]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[1:19:09.980 --> 1:19:18.380]  That is amazing. The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top
[1:19:18.380 --> 1:19:26.060]  of it. And there's another innovation. It's the spray cap. It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick,
[1:19:26.060 --> 1:19:31.900]  gross, goo, but it's high quality. It aerosolizes it in a really great way. I like to put it on my
[1:19:31.900 --> 1:19:37.180]  hands, rub a little bit on my face. It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes.
[1:19:37.180 --> 1:19:43.020]  But I just love it personally as something that's a moisturizer as well. So this is a real
[1:19:43.020 --> 1:19:47.420]  innovation. I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually
[1:19:47.420 --> 1:19:54.140]  has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out. It smells great. It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[1:19:59.820 --> 1:20:04.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:04.140 --> 1:20:23.180]  We're not being taken off the air. We just rely. We're being taken off the air because we see.
[1:20:24.780 --> 1:20:29.820]  I don't even tell the truth. I just see. I can't back down.
[1:20:29.820 --> 1:20:40.060]  I can't give in. I can't sell out. It's not in my nature. I can't physically buy.
[1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:49.500]  Because I already sold out. The God of the universe. I already turned my will over.
[1:20:49.500 --> 1:21:00.060]  And once I did it, the gates of perception opened. The levels you Satanists could never even fathom.
[1:21:08.540 --> 1:21:15.500]  Let's take your phone calls. I'm just going to leave this here. We fund ourselves promoting and
[1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:22.380]  selling things we believe are important and are symbiotic, meaning 360 win non-zero sum game.
[1:21:23.100 --> 1:21:29.260]  We were positioned with the largest selection you'd find anywhere of high quality non-GMO
[1:21:29.260 --> 1:21:34.220]  heirloom seeds. Soon as they started trying to ban selling seeds, we sold out in three days.
[1:21:34.220 --> 1:21:40.620]  They're all gone. We're trying to get more. Pre-position because we go with what works,
[1:21:40.620 --> 1:21:45.660]  you know, like a seed. Plant this. A whole apple tree grows up. Plant this. Corn grows up. Plant
[1:21:45.660 --> 1:21:52.220]  this. Tomatoes come up. Plant this. Peppers come up. Plant this. Tobacco comes up. That's cool
[1:21:52.220 --> 1:22:00.300]  to grow your own tobacco. Back when I was a spoker, I liked doing it. But the point I'm getting at is
[1:22:03.580 --> 1:22:08.220]  that's the real magic in our world. And so I just promote things that I know you already need.
[1:22:08.220 --> 1:22:12.940]  So before I go to these calls, I'm just going to say this. We have the best high-quality
[1:22:12.940 --> 1:22:16.940]  storeable food that they actually have in stock, that they're actually packaging fresh,
[1:22:16.940 --> 1:22:20.780]  ready to ship to you. And it freaks me out that the other major distributors don't,
[1:22:20.780 --> 1:22:25.260]  but still take orders and play this rub-a-dub game. So if you want storeable food, which I think
[1:22:25.260 --> 1:22:30.300]  everybody should get, get it at infowarstore.com because that keeps us on the air and it gets you
[1:22:30.300 --> 1:22:38.460]  high-quality storeable food at a very good price. A 360 win. Anything 360 win, that's what I'm for.
[1:22:38.460 --> 1:22:45.420]  360 win. Get your storeable food now at infowarstore.com. And separately, it's selling out,
[1:22:46.060 --> 1:22:50.860]  but more is coming in in a few weeks. We have the great Emirates Essentials hand sanitizer with
[1:22:50.860 --> 1:22:55.820]  essential oils and the great delivery system in eucalyptus, peppermint, and what's the other one,
[1:22:55.820 --> 1:23:01.900]  lavender. Again, my favorite eucalyptus, but they're both excellent. All three are excellent.
[1:23:03.260 --> 1:23:07.820]  Opens up the sinuses and it is great. We had this in development a year ago. I said,
[1:23:07.820 --> 1:23:14.300]  we should get an organic hand sanitizer with essential oil. And right on time, this just came
[1:23:14.300 --> 1:23:18.140]  in while all this craziness was going on right when the establishment was trying to keep us from
[1:23:18.140 --> 1:23:22.620]  selling silver products. So that's how that works. We even got a new toothpaste coming in,
[1:23:22.620 --> 1:23:26.940]  a charcoal toothpaste will be here soon because I was using them and loving them and they were
[1:23:26.940 --> 1:23:32.300]  just amazing. And then I got a top group six months ago to do the deal. It's being manufactured
[1:23:32.300 --> 1:23:36.220]  right now. So it's kind of like God's always one step ahead of them. They try to shut down this.
[1:23:36.220 --> 1:23:41.580]  Well, we already got that going on. And it's just, it's that mystery of how providence and all of
[1:23:41.580 --> 1:23:46.380]  it works. When you just turn it over to God, it just keeps working out. But God makes you get
[1:23:46.380 --> 1:23:50.860]  right to the edge like the widows might before you get delivered again. Just to show you,
[1:23:50.860 --> 1:23:56.460]  this isn't you. This is God in charge, but that's available.
[1:23:58.380 --> 1:24:03.020]  A lot of the great products, X2 is back in stock, despite the fact that it's so popular,
[1:24:03.020 --> 1:24:09.740]  it's still 50% off. And it costs us a lot to get X2. X2, you have to beg the oil and gas companies
[1:24:10.540 --> 1:24:17.100]  when they're going down 10, 15,000 feet to take it out. So you gotta get a DEA license
[1:24:17.100 --> 1:24:21.340]  for the precursor of it. And then you gotta jump through a lot of hoops. But X2 is back.
[1:24:21.980 --> 1:24:24.060]  And that's another example of providence that I'll go to your calls.
[1:24:25.580 --> 1:24:30.460]  About six years ago, we had a really good seaweed iodine, nothing like X2, but it was a really good
[1:24:30.460 --> 1:24:36.460]  one. And they found who it was, the politically that jacked with, and they took it away. So we
[1:24:36.460 --> 1:24:41.820]  did this big search. It was like, oh, there's medical grade iodine. I mean, we've shown you the
[1:24:41.820 --> 1:24:46.780]  videos like putting it out of a petri dish on a table. It'll eat through stuff and like
[1:24:46.780 --> 1:24:53.100]  turns it like a blue gas, purple gas like I dream a genie. That's what pure iodine does. That's the
[1:24:53.100 --> 1:25:01.020]  iodine you get next to. And they took away the company we had to get good ocean based stuff.
[1:25:01.740 --> 1:25:08.620]  And boom, that door opened and we got medical grade. And by that is I mean, it's atomic,
[1:25:08.620 --> 1:25:14.220]  ladies and gentlemen, it is the idea is iodine. And then, however, it works the licensure in
[1:25:14.220 --> 1:25:20.860]  the way it works. And they're able to put it into the organic glycerin oil and all the rest of it.
[1:25:21.740 --> 1:25:24.620]  If you don't know what iodine does, you don't know what pure iodine does. It's
[1:25:25.740 --> 1:25:30.460]  transcendent. It's amazing. And when I forget to take it, I feel it. And that's back in stock.
[1:25:30.460 --> 1:25:37.100]  Okay, I said I go to your calls. I'm going to stop now. Let's go ahead and go to Joshua in
[1:25:37.100 --> 1:25:41.980]  Georgia. So he's active duty army on the food shortages that they now confirm are already
[1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:46.700]  beginning. What's your take on that, Joshua? Thanks for holding. Alex, thank you so much
[1:25:46.700 --> 1:25:50.460]  for taking my call. Been listening for 10 years. I first off want to thank you for your products
[1:25:50.460 --> 1:25:55.500]  and plug really quick that pollen block. I have been taking every other type of antihistamine.
[1:25:55.500 --> 1:25:59.980]  I've taken the claritins and everything and nothing else has worked. I get allergies three
[1:25:59.980 --> 1:26:06.380]  times per year. And they're really bad. And this is the first and the only product that is absolutely
[1:26:06.380 --> 1:26:10.460]  blocked all of the pollen issues, all of the allergies that I've had. So thank you so much.
[1:26:10.460 --> 1:26:16.380]  I'm on auto ship for that. And that stuff is amazing. Secondly, I wanted to also plug one
[1:26:16.380 --> 1:26:20.940]  other thing along with the food shortages I serve in the United States Army right now. The army
[1:26:20.940 --> 1:26:25.580]  is not bringing people into the military. The recruiters are on halt right now. They're only
[1:26:25.580 --> 1:26:31.900]  gathered and China is expanding. Exactly. But not only that, Alex, I've been in the military.
[1:26:31.900 --> 1:26:35.100]  I've been affiliated with the military for actually over 10 years. I've worked with the
[1:26:35.100 --> 1:26:41.980]  military in other areas. And the thing is, we are not doing any training for the first
[1:26:41.980 --> 1:26:47.580]  time in our history of being in the United States Army for every branch of service,
[1:26:47.580 --> 1:26:51.660]  Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard. There is no training going on whatsoever. Everybody is
[1:26:51.660 --> 1:26:59.020]  sitting around sitting at home doing nothing. And under the criminal directive of the WHO,
[1:26:59.020 --> 1:27:05.660]  who they admit controls the media controls big tech control. Our president is Bill Gates and
[1:27:05.660 --> 1:27:11.340]  the vice president is the WHO. Yeah, well, Alex, I was told when I came in the military,
[1:27:11.340 --> 1:27:15.260]  we are called to be athletes. We don't do PT in the morning. We don't do weapons training. We're
[1:27:15.260 --> 1:27:20.060]  not doing anything until they choose the lift. This our gyms are closed and we can't even go
[1:27:20.060 --> 1:27:24.300]  off base to go to a gym that the governor is open to the state of Georgia. They gave us orders
[1:27:24.300 --> 1:27:29.820]  not to do. Oh yeah, you see how they're paralyzing you. Is the military waking up? Do they know what's
[1:27:29.820 --> 1:27:35.820]  going on? There are some factions of them that are and a lot of them are starting to question now
[1:27:35.820 --> 1:27:40.140]  more than ever what is really going on. A lot of them are questioning is this a man may think
[1:27:40.140 --> 1:27:44.940]  what's really going on. However, we are paid to take orders. Our rank prevents us from going too
[1:27:44.940 --> 1:27:50.860]  far without getting in trouble. That's lawful orders, my friend. Well, yeah, but they keep us
[1:27:50.860 --> 1:27:56.860]  under that UCMJ. The thing is, I wanted to also talk about the food shortages as well. There are
[1:27:56.860 --> 1:28:02.140]  many people coming out, independent farmers that are coming out all over social media. The mainstream
[1:28:02.140 --> 1:28:07.500]  media will not talk about this. I think you're the only one in this arena that's really highlighting
[1:28:07.500 --> 1:28:11.660]  this because this is a major crisis. All the farmers are saying they're dumping hundreds of
[1:28:11.660 --> 1:28:16.220]  thousands of gallons of milk. They are. Oh yeah, the big corporations aren't know there's a market.
[1:28:16.220 --> 1:28:21.660]  They're using this as an excuse to not take delivery to cause a supply chain breakdown.
[1:28:21.660 --> 1:28:25.900]  And so the globalists think we have no memory. When everything breaks down and when there's
[1:28:25.900 --> 1:28:31.340]  no food in a few months, folks, remember that the globalists did this. Stay there, Joshua.
[1:28:31.340 --> 1:28:35.420]  And then we're going to promise we'll go to Patrick, Steve, Bill, James, Jason, David,
[1:28:35.420 --> 1:28:39.660]  Seth and others. Folks, I don't get up here and tell you there's going to be a breakdown
[1:28:39.660 --> 1:28:43.580]  for no reason. I want to prop the economy up even if it's got problems and it's fake.
[1:28:43.580 --> 1:28:48.300]  I don't want a depression. And I'm telling you right now, I'm not a person that gets scared easy
[1:28:48.300 --> 1:29:14.300]  and I'm really upset. I'm telling you right now.
[1:29:18.300 --> 1:29:24.860]  10 year shelf life bacon ships free at fully cooked bacon.com fully cooked bacon.com.

[1:29:56.940 --> 1:30:01.980]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think even if it ends up hurting me
[1:30:01.980 --> 1:30:06.140]  short term, I believe in God and I believe in the long run. It'll end up being better for
[1:30:06.140 --> 1:30:10.220]  myself, everybody else in this world we live together in. I understand what comes around
[1:30:10.220 --> 1:30:14.220]  goes around your big book you show and I live that and I fundamentally the cellular level
[1:30:14.220 --> 1:30:18.940]  understand it. Now, if I would have hyped up the virus was going to kill three, four, five
[1:30:18.940 --> 1:30:23.820]  million people like the UN did, I would have sold five times more supplements. But you know what,
[1:30:23.820 --> 1:30:29.980]  I didn't do that. But I said on a routine basis, regardless, people are vitamin D deficient,
[1:30:29.980 --> 1:30:35.420]  people are deficient. I had died and so many other issues you need those products regardless.
[1:30:35.420 --> 1:30:39.820]  So we started selling out of vitamin mineral fusion on the other products. I cut the prices
[1:30:39.820 --> 1:30:46.700]  from 30% off to 60% off because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make
[1:30:46.700 --> 1:30:52.380]  sure people were incentivized to up their bodies defenses. But now I'm telling you with economic
[1:30:52.380 --> 1:31:00.140]  crises going on, get your storeable food now. Globalism is all about making the nation state
[1:31:00.140 --> 1:31:08.060]  and the population itself obsolete, non essential. That's why they position it with economic tariffs,
[1:31:08.060 --> 1:31:13.500]  taxes and controls to our family farms and industry that's based in the United States
[1:31:13.500 --> 1:31:19.980]  has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate. That's part of making us obsolete
[1:31:19.980 --> 1:31:26.540]  so that as the human world is phased out, they can simply look at us and say, because again,
[1:31:26.540 --> 1:31:32.620]  you are non essential. That's what the robots and all of this is about. It's about setting it up
[1:31:32.620 --> 1:31:38.060]  where we're no longer in charge of our lives. We can be told to stay on our houses. After all,
[1:31:38.060 --> 1:31:43.100]  shut up. This world doesn't belong to people anyways. It belongs to the new AI gods, the
[1:31:43.100 --> 1:31:47.100]  rich elitist that emerged with machines. Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[1:31:47.820 --> 1:31:54.140]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing. These people are completely psychotic and make
[1:31:54.140 --> 1:32:00.060]  Hitler look like a choir boy. Getting your protein has never been easier with InfoWars

[1:33:02.060 --> 1:33:23.420]  The answer to the lockdown, the 2020 tyranny is 1776. Under host Alex Jones, I want to go to your calls.
[1:33:24.220 --> 1:33:30.860]  UN chief says pandemic must be used to deindustrialize the West. Transition to green energy.
[1:33:30.860 --> 1:33:38.060]  Translated star billions of death. They're making their move. Who died and made the WHO the head
[1:33:38.060 --> 1:33:45.820]  censor? Who died and gave them the keys to America? That's the question we now ask ourselves. InfoWars
[1:33:45.820 --> 1:33:50.300]  was supposed to be on the air by now. So the new world order could just have its way and we would
[1:33:50.300 --> 1:33:58.620]  forget about the warnings. But the best lead plans of mice and men often go astray and things aren't
[1:33:58.620 --> 1:34:05.020]  going the way they wanted. So Joshua and Georgia active army bringing up points about the food
[1:34:05.020 --> 1:34:12.780]  shortages. There's no food shortage. The big companies are refusing to buy. Cargill, Tyson,
[1:34:12.780 --> 1:34:18.300]  they have two or three cases. They just were shutting down because that's the order. And then
[1:34:18.300 --> 1:34:22.860]  the military shuts down hell. Let the nuclear power plants blow up and kill the whole planet.
[1:34:22.860 --> 1:34:27.260]  It's like if it saves one person, we want a new Chernobyl to kill everybody. Seriously,
[1:34:27.260 --> 1:34:31.180]  that's the equation. Well, if it kills 100 million people in starvation and we save 100,
[1:34:31.180 --> 1:34:35.340]  it's worth it. It's like this. The medical people say if we all stay in our houses forever, no one
[1:34:35.340 --> 1:34:41.420]  will die, except everyone will. This is the psychotic mind game they're pushing and the idea
[1:34:41.420 --> 1:34:46.860]  that some shadowy virus is there. So we have full control of culture. So give us your take on
[1:34:46.860 --> 1:34:54.780]  the breakdown of the food supply chain. Alex, you're looking at so many shortages across the
[1:34:54.780 --> 1:34:59.100]  board. All you got to do is go into a grocery store and you're going to see that half the shelves
[1:34:59.100 --> 1:35:04.620]  everywhere you go in every store is missing something. The prices are starting to go up
[1:35:04.620 --> 1:35:09.900]  everywhere. And my question is, what is that $1,200 everybody got? That's just going to go to
[1:35:09.900 --> 1:35:14.620]  curb a little bit of the inflation. And by the time they get these job markets back up and people
[1:35:14.620 --> 1:35:18.940]  back to work, it's going to take it's going to take even longer than it has been to shut down
[1:35:18.940 --> 1:35:23.740]  to even attempt to recover. Oh, it took years and years and years of companies that barely even
[1:35:23.740 --> 1:35:28.940]  made money but kept everybody employed and kept it going and they built infrastructure and all
[1:35:28.940 --> 1:35:36.140]  that's being knocked out in a matter of months. We're 45 days into the hostage that is now America.
[1:35:36.140 --> 1:35:44.380]  America is held hostage. Well, Alex, if it all it takes is another nation to use a bio weapon
[1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:50.380]  like COVID-19 against us to shut down our military. Exactly. We've shown that exactly, and I'm
[1:35:50.380 --> 1:35:55.180]  going to say this a thousand times, I'm glad you raised it. The policy's been said that if there's
[1:35:55.180 --> 1:36:00.140]  any bio weapon, we curl over, put our tilts on our legs, piss on ourselves and die,
[1:36:01.580 --> 1:36:04.460]  which then invites people to release real stuff.
[1:36:07.020 --> 1:36:11.100]  Exactly. And that's the problem I have. If our military is going to, you know,
[1:36:11.100 --> 1:36:14.620]  pardon my French, pacify themselves and just shut down and weaken themselves,
[1:36:14.620 --> 1:36:18.700]  then right now it would be the perfect time for another nation to come and invade it. Our
[1:36:18.700 --> 1:36:22.300]  defenses are down. No, not totally, but let me explain something. The average person thinks this
[1:36:22.300 --> 1:36:29.260]  is a pusification. This is psychotic craziness joining, this will destroy the economy, destroy
[1:36:29.260 --> 1:36:34.060]  your future and invite future bio attacks. So people that are doing this, if they knew the
[1:36:34.060 --> 1:36:39.980]  facts have incredible psychotic courage, actually. I mean, because you just said it, this green lights,
[1:36:40.620 --> 1:36:46.140]  this, this green lights total capitulation to a medical tyranny, any corporation, any government,
[1:36:46.140 --> 1:36:52.220]  any group can release a virus that kills less than the flu and we go to our knees so fast.
[1:36:54.620 --> 1:36:59.100]  I agree, Alex, but, but Alex, listen, I really appreciate you taking my call and highlighting
[1:36:59.100 --> 1:37:03.180]  these things. One last question I have for you, Alex, is I know where we are right now.
[1:37:03.740 --> 1:37:07.500]  How much longer are we going to stay here and how much longer do you think until
[1:37:07.500 --> 1:37:10.540]  a potential collapse or do you think there will be a turnaround?
[1:37:10.540 --> 1:37:17.500]  Well, we were right eight, nine, 10 weeks ago, and I appreciate your call. Thank you, sir,
[1:37:18.620 --> 1:37:21.820]  to say, okay, this is going to be a huge collapse. The Democrats are going to shut
[1:37:21.820 --> 1:37:25.660]  all the cities off. If Trump says nothing's happening, they'll go, oh, look, he didn't
[1:37:25.660 --> 1:37:29.260]  respond to get rid of him. But in a way, that was kind of Machiavellian to think like that.
[1:37:29.260 --> 1:37:33.660]  Maybe Trump, maybe I was wrong. Maybe Trump should have just said, like, ball of sorrow,
[1:37:33.660 --> 1:37:39.980]  it's a hoax from the beginning and just bet on the people, but it didn't happen. So that's
[1:37:39.980 --> 1:37:45.660]  hindsight is 2020. Now Trump's trying to open stuff, but the corporations, the bureaucracies,
[1:37:45.660 --> 1:37:52.780]  they're refusing. And because America just got so fetishized wearing a mask and sitting in a pool
[1:37:52.780 --> 1:37:57.020]  of piss and going, oh, we're all heroes because we're not going to work while tens of millions
[1:37:57.020 --> 1:38:04.460]  start to death. And so Trump is only as strong as the American people. And so because the American
[1:38:04.460 --> 1:38:09.340]  people bought into this, Trump went, okay, I'll give you what you want so that he wouldn't be
[1:38:09.340 --> 1:38:13.500]  thrown out and the people behind it in full control. So I get the thinking of what Trump did.
[1:38:14.620 --> 1:38:19.340]  But now it's, we, Trump's just got to come out and say, this is killing tens of millions of people,
[1:38:19.340 --> 1:38:23.340]  which he's now doing. This has got to stop. In fact, you guys have that club of him saying mass
[1:38:23.340 --> 1:38:30.300]  death. Here's Trump like four or five weeks ago. Here he is 160, almost 160 million jobs in this
[1:38:30.300 --> 1:38:36.780]  country. Now the most ever by far, by far the most ever, the number of jobs, almost 160 million.
[1:38:36.780 --> 1:38:41.820]  And so we can't turn that off. And I think it's going to be wonderful. There'll be tremendous
[1:38:41.820 --> 1:38:47.420]  repercussions. There will be a tremendous death from that death. You know, you're talking about
[1:38:47.420 --> 1:38:54.060]  death, probably more death from that than anything that we're talking about with respect to the virus.
[1:38:55.580 --> 1:38:56.300]  So there you go.
[1:38:57.820 --> 1:39:02.060]  Trump gets it. All right, I took one call in the last 20 minutes. Let me get to everybody now.
[1:39:02.060 --> 1:39:07.260]  Let's go to Steve in Michigan, where you've got a governor that is just orgasming. I mean,
[1:39:07.260 --> 1:39:11.980]  she is just, oh my God, we're going to lock everything down forever. You never leave your
[1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:15.980]  house again. She's such a hero. When you stay locked up, you save lives. It doesn't matter
[1:39:15.980 --> 1:39:19.820]  what all the numbers show. How are you doing up there in Michigan with that monster?
[1:39:21.180 --> 1:39:25.180]  Trying to hang in there. It's crazy. Like she felt like we were just going to have another month
[1:39:25.180 --> 1:39:30.700]  of lockdown for no reason. So that's good. Yeah. I mean, the Democrats are announcing
[1:39:30.700 --> 1:39:36.220]  they're never reopening. They love this. Yeah, it's appalling. I mean, even if you make the
[1:39:36.220 --> 1:39:41.020]  argument that the people that were protesting in person, not in their cars, caused this to be
[1:39:41.020 --> 1:39:45.500]  longer, what? That's not going to cause a whole month of the whole state to be locked down. Like
[1:39:45.500 --> 1:39:51.020]  that's ridiculous. But the idea that their models were all 50 times, 30 times, 20 times off.
[1:39:51.020 --> 1:39:55.020]  And so now the same people that lied about the modeling, oh, someone will die. They're marking
[1:39:55.020 --> 1:40:01.500]  every death is that to get money. Gates is smart. They incentivized. Look at that psychotic.
[1:40:02.460 --> 1:40:09.580]  Everything is about how they're power grabbing. Everything is about how they pay more to say
[1:40:09.580 --> 1:40:14.460]  it's a COVID case. The fraud is the incentive here. That's how you expose this thing.
[1:40:15.740 --> 1:40:20.700]  Yeah. And I mean, it looks a lot like how these governors are acting, especially California. And
[1:40:20.700 --> 1:40:25.580]  then there's that weird alliance on the East and West Coast where they're acting like they're forming
[1:40:25.580 --> 1:40:30.220]  their own nation and Gavin Newsome, too. Like the way he's portraying himself, too, for a while.
[1:40:30.220 --> 1:40:33.900]  Oh, yeah. No, no, no, it's just pitch your pants nation. We're never opening again.
[1:40:33.900 --> 1:40:38.140]  No one will ever get a virus again. And then if the doctors say it's a hoax, we banned them on
[1:40:38.140 --> 1:40:42.540]  YouTube. I mean, this is real tyranny, folks. It's not going to come now. This is it.
[1:40:42.540 --> 1:40:50.380]  Yeah. I mean, I mean, they're making their move like you're saying.
[1:40:52.060 --> 1:40:56.460]  God, they just put the Michigan governor up there. Every time I see her, she looks like a psychotic
[1:40:56.460 --> 1:41:03.420]  demon. That she does look like Caitlyn Jenner, for sure. Absolutely. God bless you, sir.
[1:41:04.460 --> 1:41:10.780]  Look at those eyes, folks. That woman wants one thing power. And again, because she's not human,
[1:41:10.780 --> 1:41:16.940]  her spirit, she loves the control over humanity and just the power of you stand at home and
[1:41:16.940 --> 1:41:21.180]  she's the savior of the news is praising her. That's all she knows. I imagine I imagine I was
[1:41:21.180 --> 1:41:26.540]  there like, hello, no one leaves your house. He was kind of like, she's like, I can't even look
[1:41:26.540 --> 1:41:35.100]  crazy like her. I can't even do it. Like, what's look at that woman? Would you let her babysit
[1:41:35.100 --> 1:41:41.020]  your children? Just saying. That's like Brian Stelzer's female version right there, man. Like,
[1:41:41.020 --> 1:41:48.620]  Jack Nicholson doesn't look as creepy as her, man. Look at she can't even hide the power grab.
[1:41:49.260 --> 1:41:54.220]  All right, Kathy, you're up next. Other callers are going to go to break. I'm going to say this
[1:41:54.220 --> 1:41:57.900]  again. They want you dependent. They want you broke. They want you dumb. They want to then have
[1:41:57.900 --> 1:42:02.700]  a breakdown and then suck off everybody else to quote, protect you. They want to pimp you. They
[1:42:02.700 --> 1:42:06.460]  want to rule you. Get your storeable food now while you still can. They may have to stop
[1:42:06.460 --> 1:42:10.140]  taking new orders soon. I'm told because the volume is so massive, they had to stop taking
[1:42:10.140 --> 1:42:13.740]  orders for two weeks. They've got ready to take your orders and get it out to you right now
[1:42:13.740 --> 1:42:20.540]  in fullwarstore.com. And the same great company has the Alexa Pure Breeze for $179 right now,
[1:42:20.540 --> 1:42:25.180]  ladies and gentlemen. That is so close to cost. It's insane. We are their loss leader place to
[1:42:25.180 --> 1:42:30.380]  put out these specials and we're doing it right now in fullwarstore.com. They've done some actuary
[1:42:30.380 --> 1:42:33.900]  that when I plug it, it sells it everywhere else for them at the full price, 300 bucks.
[1:42:34.700 --> 1:42:39.420]  It's how computers work. I don't know. But it's worth it to give it to me basically close to cost
[1:42:39.420 --> 1:42:44.700]  and then I make 30, 40 bucks and then everybody else buys it everywhere else. More money. I don't
[1:42:44.700 --> 1:43:00.940]  know how that works. But in fullwarstore.com and we by the way have X2 back in stock at yours now.
[1:43:14.700 --> 1:43:21.260]  The globalists are running an operation. It's not predictions. We have their battle plans. So
[1:43:22.060 --> 1:43:25.820]  going back more than eight weeks to go, all major storeable food companies were sold out
[1:43:25.820 --> 1:43:30.460]  except my Patreon supply because they're the biggest or pre-position. When it got to the point
[1:43:30.460 --> 1:43:34.780]  they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner.
[1:43:34.780 --> 1:43:39.100]  They stopped taking orders till they got caught back up. Well, now they're caught back up. They've

[1:45:26.060 --> 1:45:32.220]  selling overall for me. And I've told listeners at the end of last year that we can't sell products
[1:45:32.220 --> 1:45:38.700]  at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup in them to fund our operations. But because
[1:45:38.700 --> 1:45:44.940]  of what's happening and going on in the world right now, I really want everybody who hasn't used
[1:45:44.940 --> 1:45:50.860]  or tried or enjoyed the benefits of DNA Force Plus to have DNA Force Plus for yourself and your
[1:45:50.860 --> 1:45:58.540]  family. DNA Force Plus now 50% off. There's a process where you take a stallion and you tie
[1:45:58.540 --> 1:46:03.500]  him down and you cut his testicles off and then he becomes gelded. Well, that's what's happening
[1:46:03.500 --> 1:46:08.060]  to the entire world right now. We're going into deep, deep tyranny. It's like North Korea and
[1:46:08.060 --> 1:46:13.180]  China are going into deeper tyranny as well. It's all directed by the UN. It's all a big cooked up
[1:46:13.180 --> 1:46:18.460]  giant plan to absolutely take control of your life, bankrupt the economy, and make you dependent
[1:46:18.460 --> 1:46:24.460]  on the big mega banks. And to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations,
[1:46:24.460 --> 1:46:28.140]  brainwash your kids the way they say and have absolutely no freedom. And it's all happening,
[1:46:28.140 --> 1:46:33.100]  boom, overnight. This is a giant revolution. And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said,
[1:46:33.100 --> 1:46:37.180]  oh, it's just an extended spring break, two weeks. Notice now it's 18 months, two years,
[1:46:37.180 --> 1:46:43.340]  five years. It never ends. No one can ever die from a virus again. Government will save you. It's
[1:46:43.340 --> 1:46:48.140]  a takeover. It's the opposite. They're coming with forced inoculations on record. They'll reduce
[1:46:48.140 --> 1:46:53.420]  your fertility, lower your immunity, and in many cases kill you. And they're telling you it's going
[1:46:53.420 --> 1:47:09.340]  to hurt a lot of people. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:23.420 --> 1:47:31.180]  She's a razor shop. She'll get away. She'll slice you apart.
[1:47:33.580 --> 1:47:40.620]  These psychos are making their move. They can only think one step ahead. We think
[1:47:40.620 --> 1:47:57.820]  infinity. Well, you might not make it back. Well, you might not make it back. She's got the look.
[1:47:57.820 --> 1:48:10.940]  That's part of the song right here. Kill the U.S. economy. She's got looks to kill. She's got
[1:48:10.940 --> 1:48:23.100]  looks to kill. She keeps her motor clean. You better leave me you. She's at number 13.
[1:48:23.100 --> 1:48:28.780]  All right, let's go ahead and get to your phone calls here. But I want to play this clip. I mentioned
[1:48:28.780 --> 1:48:35.340]  at the end of the show yesterday. Never got to it. What an amazing clip. The new secretary general,
[1:48:35.340 --> 1:48:41.740]  the U.N., came out and said, we must deindustrialize the West. That's how you save the economy.
[1:48:41.740 --> 1:48:47.020]  That's what kills the third world. So it's like saying, oh, you help a drowning person by tying
[1:48:47.020 --> 1:48:51.740]  giant bowling balls through ankles. Like, oh, if you have a person that's drowned,
[1:48:51.740 --> 1:48:56.300]  you pull them out and you pump more water in their lungs. Or if somebody's on fire, you fire
[1:48:57.020 --> 1:49:02.860]  gasoline at them. And again, these are the little psychotic globalists that the bankers have put in
[1:49:05.260 --> 1:49:11.340]  so they can act like the world government and interface with the corporations and carry it out.
[1:49:11.340 --> 1:49:15.740]  And then the average American is too dumb to defend the president during this.
[1:49:15.740 --> 1:49:23.100]  Trump bet on America. And I still think we might crawl out of this with part of our
[1:49:23.100 --> 1:49:28.620]  selves intact. But I'm just looking back at the left and how dumb they aren't like you,
[1:49:28.620 --> 1:49:33.820]  you guys are idiots. I mean, those of us that are informed and involved are already prepared and
[1:49:33.820 --> 1:49:39.980]  dug in and ready. You guys are all in the compact cities. You all are in huge debt.
[1:49:39.980 --> 1:49:46.700]  You're the schmucks, but that's the thing about minions. Their ego feels like they're winning
[1:49:46.700 --> 1:49:52.300]  while you're losing. I'm winning, but I see you losing. So I feel like I'm losing.
[1:49:59.420 --> 1:50:03.340]  God help us. We're going to go to your calls. Here's the clip. The head of the UN
[1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:10.380]  Secretary General Antonio Gutierrez, who was set up by Aldous Huxley's brother,
[1:50:10.380 --> 1:50:18.060]  who set the UN up to carry out a world population plan. And now 2020 is here and we're in the trap.
[1:50:19.020 --> 1:50:23.420]  I mean, no one can ignore the fact that exactly what I said is now happening. And again,
[1:50:23.420 --> 1:50:27.900]  I'd love to tell you that I'm like John the revelator and an angel gave me a little sugar cube.
[1:50:27.900 --> 1:50:34.220]  That's in revelator here. Take this. No, that didn't happen. I just read what they said they would do.
[1:50:36.220 --> 1:50:41.420]  And that's what's so frustrating. It's like you find the bank robber manifesto before they rob
[1:50:41.420 --> 1:50:46.700]  the bank and you don't go and do anything. And then sure enough, they show up and rob the bank.
[1:50:46.700 --> 1:50:50.940]  I mean, now I told you they're coming to rob the bank and now they're doing it.
[1:50:50.940 --> 1:50:59.020]  And in fact, they're like unzipping their pants and pissing in our face. And I'm like, why, why?
[1:50:59.020 --> 1:51:07.820]  It's horrible to go with these people. But people are followers. So here is the head of the UN
[1:51:09.740 --> 1:51:12.940]  talking about how the end up because we're not deindustrialized enough.
[1:51:12.940 --> 1:51:17.660]  All the jobs haven't been moved to China, only 90%. So the answer is this right now. Here it is.
[1:51:17.660 --> 1:51:24.540]  The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of all societies and economies to global shocks,
[1:51:24.540 --> 1:51:31.340]  such as disease or climate disruption. As we recover, we must build back better for people
[1:51:31.340 --> 1:51:36.140]  and the planet. We have the guides and tools we need, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and
[1:51:36.140 --> 1:51:42.140]  the Sustainable Development Goals. Governments have pledged to present within a year new nationally
[1:51:42.140 --> 1:51:48.140]  determined contributions and long term strategies to reach net zero greenhouse emissions by 2050.
[1:51:48.940 --> 1:51:54.380]  This commitment must be maintained. And the main economies, the G20 countries,
[1:51:54.380 --> 1:51:59.740]  must lead by example. I have proposed six climate positive actions for building back.
[1:52:00.300 --> 1:52:06.700]  Invest in green jobs, do not bail out polluting industries and fossil fuel subsidies,
[1:52:06.700 --> 1:52:13.020]  take climate risks into account in all financial and policy decisions, work together. And most
[1:52:13.020 --> 1:52:20.300]  important, leave no one behind. Together, we can improve health, reduce inequalities and re-energize
[1:52:20.300 --> 1:52:26.780]  struggling economies. Like the coronavirus, greenhouse gases respect no boundaries. Isolation
[1:52:26.780 --> 1:52:30.060]  is not a solution. No country can succeed alone.
[1:52:30.060 --> 1:52:38.940]  Don't let this man babysit your children or your planet. So did you get what he just said to minute
[1:52:38.940 --> 1:52:46.940]  30? What you exhale that plants breathe is coronavirus. What humans release is a criminal
[1:52:46.940 --> 1:52:54.060]  action. So you're a criminal. And we're going to build things by shutting our economy off
[1:52:54.060 --> 1:52:58.940]  because any equation you look at shows we don't use fossil fuels, we don't go interplanetary,
[1:52:58.940 --> 1:53:04.780]  we don't go interstellar, we don't go interdimensional, we're done. We were given this.
[1:53:05.340 --> 1:53:08.060]  You just think we're putting this planet because the Easter Bunny hops around?
[1:53:10.140 --> 1:53:14.860]  I mean, this is literally an enemy officer telling you, do not use your resources.
[1:53:21.900 --> 1:53:27.180]  Holy mackerel. A little fat demon that you wouldn't let get anywhere near your children.
[1:53:27.180 --> 1:53:35.580]  He's telling you, we build things by cutting it off. We be building. We shut you down. We not
[1:53:35.580 --> 1:53:43.740]  let you have economy. And then we rebuild by you not having anything. We cut your power off. That's
[1:53:43.740 --> 1:53:57.580]  how you do good. But China, you operate however you want. I guess the lady that was holding,
[1:53:57.580 --> 1:53:59.980]  the one woman that was holding, I was going to go to her, but she's gone now.
[1:54:01.820 --> 1:54:11.580]  It's okay. Kim Jong-un loves us. Let's go ahead and talk to Bill in Pennsylvania. Come on down, Bill.
[1:54:11.580 --> 1:54:17.420]  Bill. Hey, Alex, how are you, man? Hey, I want to start off by just saying thanks for doing what
[1:54:17.420 --> 1:54:22.860]  you do. You're risking it all for all of us out here, and I certainly appreciate it.
[1:54:22.860 --> 1:54:27.660]  Well, I appreciate you, brother, but I don't want to sit there like waiting for watching it all
[1:54:27.660 --> 1:54:32.140]  burn down. I'd rather just get it, you know, get done now for myself, you know. Yeah, I'm with
[1:54:32.140 --> 1:54:37.020]  you, man. I'm with you. I've been a fan for, gosh, over 10 years. I think my favorite possession I
[1:54:37.020 --> 1:54:43.260]  have is an Autocrinist, Alex Jones, copy of the magazine. When you first came out with the magazine,
[1:54:43.260 --> 1:54:49.020]  I've got the issue with Obama sitting there. I think the title's like, this man wants to
[1:54:49.020 --> 1:54:53.660]  take your guns or something like that. Absolutely. My son sent it in to you, signed it, and I got
[1:54:53.660 --> 1:54:58.060]  a bag. I appreciate that. Thank you, brother. I also want to recommend the products, man. The
[1:54:58.060 --> 1:55:04.700]  products are great, especially like the apparel. I've got numerous shirts. They feel great, thick,
[1:55:04.700 --> 1:55:09.820]  great sweatshirts. I mean, it's good stuff, very high quality. By the way, this is how Providence
[1:55:09.820 --> 1:55:16.460]  works. I came in and said, I never plug t-shirts. I should plug t-shirts and explain that when people
[1:55:16.460 --> 1:55:21.100]  get excited and get them, we like took over the RNC four years ago, totally freaked the globalist
[1:55:21.100 --> 1:55:25.740]  out, that these t-shirts in the future especially, because I don't want to be dramatic, but we could
[1:55:25.740 --> 1:55:29.340]  be shut down very, very soon. I'll just be honest with listeners. If you want to get a piece of
[1:55:29.340 --> 1:55:35.020]  history and get an M4s t-shirt, I've just got to be honest with you. I don't know how long we're
[1:55:35.020 --> 1:55:39.340]  going to be here. I'm not being dramatic. I've never been like that before. I just kind of now is
[1:55:39.340 --> 1:55:44.620]  the time to kind of just tell people that look at all the stuff that's going on. Well, and I'm okay
[1:55:44.620 --> 1:55:50.460]  with it, okay? It's just that if you want an M4s t-shirt to have something that is bonafide, is real,
[1:55:50.460 --> 1:55:55.580]  that you may not be able to get in the future, I would say now is the time. I'm not saying
[1:55:55.580 --> 1:56:04.140]  far the escape pods yet, but that's the point we're at. Okay. Yeah, the main reason for Colin is
[1:56:04.140 --> 1:56:09.900]  that one of the touch on the YouTube censorship, I think what they did to those doctors taking
[1:56:09.900 --> 1:56:15.740]  that video down is just outrageous. Is that not next level? I'll hold you through the next segment.
[1:56:15.740 --> 1:56:21.580]  Recap for folks what just happened, but I hope they don't know. Oh, the two doctors that came on
[1:56:21.580 --> 1:56:28.220]  and revealed what's going on and what was like an hour long video and it got what over millions of
[1:56:28.220 --> 1:56:32.540]  hits and they took it down. I mean, this is information that people deserve to hear. They
[1:56:32.540 --> 1:56:36.940]  have not a full degrees. They're in good standing. They own a bunch of clinics. They're reading real
[1:56:36.940 --> 1:56:42.540]  numbers and that's not allowed. Wow. We just woke up in North Korea, didn't we? Yeah, well,
[1:56:42.540 --> 1:56:46.860]  there's some more subtle ways. I think they're censoring too if I got time to touch on it.
[1:56:46.860 --> 1:56:54.940]  I did put out a music video actually. A friend and I and myself cut a music video. It's very
[1:56:55.660 --> 1:57:01.740]  patriotic throughout. It's actually called America Will Rise Again. I mean, it's out there on YouTube
[1:57:01.740 --> 1:57:06.540]  right now and it got a ton of hits early on like 500 something. That's how it works. Then they
[1:57:06.540 --> 1:57:10.220]  shadowbed it. Oh yeah, we have internal YouTube and Twitter videos where they go. They go,
[1:57:10.220 --> 1:57:14.220]  what do you censor? Well, Alex Jones, number one, they go, what next? They go, any veterans,
[1:57:14.220 --> 1:57:20.620]  any American flags your band? Like, this is a group bands, American flags. So,
[1:57:21.740 --> 1:57:24.860]  but the weird thing is they're so mentally ill. Like if you have like a hammer and sickle,
[1:57:24.860 --> 1:57:28.620]  they like promote you because the AIC is that and promotes that. And then you're like,
[1:57:28.620 --> 1:57:33.100]  I love communism because it kills everybody and sucks so bad. The AI doesn't get humor.
[1:57:33.100 --> 1:57:35.740]  And that's why they've got big problems. Stay there. I'm gonna come right back to you.
[1:57:35.740 --> 1:57:39.900]  But yeah, no, folks, it's all true. It's all real. We're inside of it now.
[1:57:39.900 --> 1:57:42.940]  Ha, ha, ha. Like Woody Woodpecker, man.
[1:57:45.340 --> 1:57:49.740]  One of our best selling products is living defense. And it's been sold out for over four
[1:57:49.740 --> 1:57:53.900]  months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic. We've got a limited supply
[1:57:53.900 --> 1:57:57.580]  right now, but it's selling out fast. And I want those of you that haven't experienced living
[1:57:57.580 --> 1:58:02.460]  defense to get it for yourself. Here's just part of one testimonial. I looked in January 2016,
[1:58:02.460 --> 1:58:06.540]  I went in a hospital. I went to VA hospital out here in Boyce. And I was in there until
[1:58:06.540 --> 1:58:11.500]  June. And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info wars
[1:58:11.500 --> 1:58:16.140]  three hours a day. And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[1:58:16.140 --> 1:58:21.180]  Let me tell you something, man. I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about
[1:58:21.180 --> 1:58:25.500]  five or six years. And the doctors, they tried every test. Nobody could figure out what it is.
[1:58:25.500 --> 1:58:29.100]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[1:58:29.100 --> 1:58:32.380]  you know what? I'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense. Now, I wasn't supposed
[1:58:32.380 --> 1:58:35.500]  to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have a stuff. But I ordered it,
[1:58:35.500 --> 1:58:40.460]  had it shipped to me. I got it. I hid it from the nurses. I started taking it, man. That stuff
[1:58:40.460 --> 1:58:45.180]  changed my life. It saved my life. Alex Jones and info wars saved my life.
[1:58:46.540 --> 1:58:54.300]  Look, the globalists are Satanists. All right. Lord Rothschild recently posed at a gallery of
[1:58:54.300 --> 1:59:01.020]  art worshiping the devil and praising Lucifer. You cannot make this up. They flaunt it in our face.
[1:59:01.020 --> 1:59:05.180]  That's what environmentalism is. It's about having an anti human future and having people live
[1:59:05.180 --> 1:59:10.700]  in a subsistence, feudal surf state. That's what they want. These people that have stolen the
[1:59:10.700 --> 1:59:16.060]  planet or worth trillions of dollars do not want you having a good life. They know you're having
[1:59:16.060 --> 1:59:20.780]  fun. They know you have a great wife, a great husband, great children. They hate your guts.
[1:59:20.780 --> 1:59:26.780]  They are the most horrible evil people on the planet. They openly fund racism, war,
[1:59:26.780 --> 1:59:32.220]  degeneracy, pedophilia, everything else. Imagine the most horrible thing in the universe and then
[1:59:32.220 --> 1:59:38.140]  imagine it doubled, tripled, quadrupled and being gullible and being domesticated just makes them
[1:59:38.140 --> 1:59:42.540]  rise up and attack you harder. And they're the ones that launched this whole attack on the planet,
[1:59:42.540 --> 2:00:01.340]  and they are the enemy of humanity and need to be stood up against. After testing thousands of
[2:00:01.340 --> 2:00:09.660]  people in their county for COVID-19, doctors Dan Erickson and Arton Massini, owners of accelerated
[2:00:09.660 --> 2:00:15.580]  urgent care in Bakersfield, California, held a press conference to share their data along with
[2:00:15.580 --> 2:00:22.620]  official CDC data. Dr. Erickson reported that hospitals in California have become empty as a
[2:00:22.620 --> 2:00:30.860]  result of allotting all resources to the COVID-19 pandemic. The hospitals, their ICUs are empty
[2:00:30.860 --> 2:00:35.740]  essentially and they're shutting down floors. They're furloughing patients, they're furloughing
[2:00:35.740 --> 2:00:41.100]  doctors because we just don't have the volume. So we're busy with paperwork for COVID and we're
[2:00:41.100 --> 2:00:46.380]  all focusing on COVID. You then went over the COVID-19 numbers for the state of California.
[2:00:46.380 --> 2:00:54.620]  We've seen 1,227 deaths in the state of California. That means you have a 0.03 chance of dying
[2:00:54.620 --> 2:01:01.020]  from COVID-19 in the state of California. And for the state of New York, 19,410 out of 19 million
[2:01:01.020 --> 2:01:07.500]  people, which is a 0.1% chance of dying from COVID in the state of New York. And then compared
[2:01:07.500 --> 2:01:14.620]  these numbers to the seasonal flu in 2017. 45 million total cases in 2017 with about 62,000
[2:01:14.620 --> 2:01:24.860]  deaths or a 0.13 chance of death from flu in the United States. So the lethality of COVID-19 is
[2:01:24.860 --> 2:01:30.300]  much less. He then went on to report what is happening as a result of the shutdown and millions
[2:01:30.300 --> 2:01:36.540]  of hardworking people losing their jobs. Child molestation is increasing at a severe rate.
[2:01:36.540 --> 2:01:43.820]  We could go over multiple cases of children who have been molested due to angry family members
[2:01:43.820 --> 2:01:48.940]  who are intoxicated, who are home, who have no paycheck. These things last a lifetime. This
[2:01:48.940 --> 2:01:54.300]  isn't about a seasonal flu. These are things that will follow these people and affect them in a
[2:01:54.300 --> 2:01:59.660]  negative fashion for their life. And these are for me talking to ERs, talking to my doctors,
[2:01:59.660 --> 2:02:03.900]  and talking to people across the country and finding out what they're seeing. Spousal abuse,
[2:02:03.900 --> 2:02:10.300]  alcoholism, anxiety, depression, suicide. One of the most interesting moments of the press conference
[2:02:10.300 --> 2:02:17.100]  was when Dr. Erickson went on to explain the immune complex and how our immune system regularly
[2:02:17.100 --> 2:02:22.940]  adapts to our environment. The immune system is built by exposure to antigens, viruses, bacteria.
[2:02:22.940 --> 2:02:27.580]  When you're a little child crawling on the ground, putting stuff in your mouth, viruses and bacteria
[2:02:27.580 --> 2:02:33.260]  come in, you form an antigen antelabatic complex, you form IgG, IgM. This is how your immune system
[2:02:33.260 --> 2:02:37.980]  is built. When you take human beings and you say, go into your house, clean all your counters,
[2:02:37.980 --> 2:02:43.580]  light-solum down, you're going to kill 99% of viruses and bacteria. Wear a mask, don't go outside.
[2:02:43.580 --> 2:02:49.340]  What does that do to our immune system? Our immune system is used to touching. We share bacteria,
[2:02:49.340 --> 2:02:55.260]  staph locox, streptococcal bacteria, viruses. We develop an immune response daily to this stuff.
[2:02:55.260 --> 2:03:01.500]  When you take that away from me, my immune system drops. As I shelter in place, my immune system
[2:03:01.500 --> 2:03:06.860]  drops. You keep me there for months, it drops more. Sheltering in place decreases your immune system.
[2:03:06.860 --> 2:03:10.700]  And then as we all come out of shelter in place with a lower immune system and start trading
[2:03:10.700 --> 2:03:15.260]  viruses, bacteria, what do you think is going to happen? Disease is going to spike. And then you've
[2:03:15.260 --> 2:03:20.780]  got disease spike amongst the hospital system with furlough doctors and nurses. I've been working
[2:03:20.780 --> 2:03:27.020]  with some of the leaders and we're all in agreement. But we need to have Governor Newsom in agreement
[2:03:27.020 --> 2:03:33.180]  with us to lift this ban because the data is showing us it's time to lift. So if we don't lift,
[2:03:34.060 --> 2:03:38.780]  what is the reason? They are using this to see how much of their freedom can they take from you
[2:03:40.220 --> 2:03:47.340]  and will you roll over and stay in your house? And it's working. Let's avoid all that. Because
[2:03:47.340 --> 2:03:52.940]  if you stop on our freedoms, that has one ending and it's violence.
[2:04:01.580 --> 2:04:05.980]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's
[2:04:05.980 --> 2:04:10.700]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[2:04:10.700 --> 2:04:18.300]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:04:41.100 --> 2:04:57.660]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off.
[2:04:58.780 --> 2:05:04.380]  The successes Info Wars has had. If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[2:05:04.380 --> 2:05:12.140]  But I'll tell you this. The technocrats are really up in their game and they are trying to
[2:05:12.140 --> 2:05:17.660]  destroy all independent forms of media. They're trying to shudder and silence human resistance.
[2:05:17.660 --> 2:05:23.180]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[2:05:23.180 --> 2:05:25.660]  and everything you warned your friends and family about us around to be true.
[2:05:26.380 --> 2:05:30.620]  So it's now that your credibility is way up. The power structure should have silenced
[2:05:30.620 --> 2:05:37.420]  us, those of us that they can't. But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:05:38.140 --> 2:05:43.340]  We have the power, but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:05:44.140 --> 2:05:48.940]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long, dark night doesn't come.
[2:05:48.940 --> 2:06:02.940]  This will be the power of yours, you are.
[2:06:02.940 --> 2:06:08.940]  I scream it loud enough that you can hear me over your music. Park closed.
[2:06:08.940 --> 2:06:10.940]  You won't get arrested if the cops come.
[2:06:10.940 --> 2:06:12.940]  Wait, can we go over there?
[2:06:12.940 --> 2:06:14.940]  Is that crazy enough for you?
[2:06:14.940 --> 2:06:16.940]  Can we go over there?
[2:06:16.940 --> 2:06:20.940]  No, the whole area.
[2:06:20.940 --> 2:06:22.940]  Get it through your thick head.
[2:06:22.940 --> 2:06:28.940]  You are the reason we are in this situation. You are the problem, not the solution.
[2:06:28.940 --> 2:06:30.940]  Go ahead, keep recorded.
[2:06:30.940 --> 2:06:32.940]  What are you going to show it to?
[2:06:32.940 --> 2:06:34.940]  Don't stay on social media.
[2:06:34.940 --> 2:06:36.940]  You're the idiot doing the wrong thing.
[2:06:36.940 --> 2:06:39.940]  I'm just trying to save your ass and save your life.
[2:06:39.940 --> 2:06:40.940]  But die, okay?
[2:06:40.940 --> 2:06:42.940]  I hope both of you get the coronavirus.
[2:06:42.940 --> 2:06:45.940]  I hope you both die along painful deaths.
[2:06:45.940 --> 2:06:47.940]  Cool.
[2:06:47.940 --> 2:06:49.940]  That's what's about chairs.
[2:06:49.940 --> 2:06:51.940]  That's what's about chairs.
[2:06:51.940 --> 2:06:53.940]  I know.
[2:06:53.940 --> 2:06:55.940]  They're old people.
[2:06:59.940 --> 2:07:01.940]  So basically...
[2:07:01.940 --> 2:07:05.940]  All over the world, police are being asked to do nonsensical, evil things
[2:07:05.940 --> 2:07:09.940]  to see what they'll do, telling old people they can't have chairs at the beach
[2:07:09.940 --> 2:07:11.940]  because they might have COVID-19 on them.
[2:07:11.940 --> 2:07:13.940]  It's all about seeing what you'll do.
[2:07:13.940 --> 2:07:15.940]  And the police are not our enemies.
[2:07:15.940 --> 2:07:17.940]  You know, I used to...
[2:07:17.940 --> 2:07:19.940]  I was not playing chess.
[2:07:19.940 --> 2:07:21.940]  I was playing checkers.
[2:07:21.940 --> 2:07:23.940]  And I would just get mad at police doing things that are wrong.
[2:07:23.940 --> 2:07:25.940]  And that's fine and dandy.
[2:07:25.940 --> 2:07:27.940]  But the globalists are going to have cops go out and do bad things
[2:07:27.940 --> 2:07:31.940]  so they can then demonize the police and take over law enforcement.
[2:07:33.940 --> 2:07:39.940]  But if police are just turned into robots,
[2:07:39.940 --> 2:07:41.940]  we've already lost the fight here.
[2:07:41.940 --> 2:07:43.940]  There was a special guest joining us this morning.
[2:07:43.940 --> 2:07:45.940]  I'll introduce him in the next segment.
[2:07:45.940 --> 2:07:47.940]  I want to continue with your phone calls.
[2:07:47.940 --> 2:07:49.940]  But...
[2:07:49.940 --> 2:07:53.940]  There's now no doubt.
[2:07:53.940 --> 2:07:55.940]  This is an engineered bioweapon.
[2:07:55.940 --> 2:07:59.940]  So Bill and Melinda Gates own it so they can control and make trillions
[2:07:59.940 --> 2:08:01.940]  off the testing and vaccines into the future.
[2:08:01.940 --> 2:08:07.940]  But it's still a very, very weak virus that kills old people.
[2:08:07.940 --> 2:08:09.940]  Who? Bill Gates says he wants to get rid of publicly.
[2:08:09.940 --> 2:08:13.940]  He says death panels kill old people.
[2:08:13.940 --> 2:08:17.940]  And the NIH sent him the weapons, Fauci's involved.
[2:08:17.940 --> 2:08:21.940]  How does Trump come out and say, oh my God, the people that I have here working for me
[2:08:21.940 --> 2:08:23.940]  are the ones behind it?
[2:08:23.940 --> 2:08:25.940]  He knows what's going on.
[2:08:25.940 --> 2:08:27.940]  But how does the public deal with that?
[2:08:27.940 --> 2:08:31.940]  The public can't handle the truth.
[2:08:31.940 --> 2:08:33.940]  Like a few good men.
[2:08:33.940 --> 2:08:37.940]  You can't handle the truth.
[2:08:37.940 --> 2:08:39.940]  And I've learned that about leadership.
[2:08:39.940 --> 2:08:43.940]  You can have all the leadership in the world, but the people aren't ready to deal with it.
[2:08:43.940 --> 2:08:45.940]  You have no power.
[2:08:45.940 --> 2:08:47.940]  So Trump up front tried to say this is a hoax.
[2:08:47.940 --> 2:08:49.940]  And they went, oh sir, horrible numbers.
[2:08:49.940 --> 2:08:51.940]  They're going to blame you for everything.
[2:08:51.940 --> 2:08:53.940]  I said, yeah, Trump, you need to get control of it.
[2:08:53.940 --> 2:08:57.940]  But blame China and blame Wuhan and burn the deep state.
[2:08:57.940 --> 2:08:59.940]  Only doing that up front will defeat them.
[2:08:59.940 --> 2:09:01.940]  Now it's admitted it came out of Wuhan.
[2:09:01.940 --> 2:09:03.940]  And now the Pentagon confirms it's man-made.
[2:09:03.940 --> 2:09:05.940]  That's a back story.
[2:09:05.940 --> 2:09:09.940]  I got information of the president.
[2:09:09.940 --> 2:09:13.940]  I'll say it that way.
[2:09:13.940 --> 2:09:21.940]  And the president literally said, a Nobel Prize winner says it's man-made.
[2:09:21.940 --> 2:09:23.940]  Alex, I haven't heard this.
[2:09:23.940 --> 2:09:25.940]  I know you don't lie to me, but is that true?
[2:09:25.940 --> 2:09:29.940]  And I said, look it up.
[2:09:29.940 --> 2:09:33.940]  And by the time I'd said that, they were blocking it and taking it down everywhere.
[2:09:33.940 --> 2:09:37.940]  And then I learned what happened.
[2:09:37.940 --> 2:09:41.940]  His doctors told him, yes, sir, there's light and everything.
[2:09:41.940 --> 2:09:43.940]  And it's a treatment.
[2:09:43.940 --> 2:09:45.940]  He goes, oh, Cedar Sinai.
[2:09:45.940 --> 2:09:47.940]  That's why he's looking at the press covers going, hey, tell folks about the light treatment.
[2:09:47.940 --> 2:09:49.940]  They all just look at him because they set him up.
[2:09:49.940 --> 2:09:57.940]  And that's why when it turned out he was right, they took it down because, I mean, I'll tell you what's going on with Trump.
[2:09:57.940 --> 2:10:01.940]  He cannot believe he is surrounded by so many wires.
[2:10:01.940 --> 2:10:07.940]  So people ask, why does he keep listening to info wars?
[2:10:07.940 --> 2:10:09.940]  Because everybody else bowed.
[2:10:09.940 --> 2:10:15.940]  And do you think I feel strong that we're one of the few organizations that hasn't bowed?
[2:10:15.940 --> 2:10:17.940]  I feel weak, actually.
[2:10:17.940 --> 2:10:27.940]  I thought there were more men in this country who, like, when somebody tries to tell them, you're dead or you're going to prison, or here's $10 million.
[2:10:27.940 --> 2:10:31.940]  He tells somebody to piss up rope.
[2:10:31.940 --> 2:10:33.940]  And I know this.
[2:10:33.940 --> 2:10:37.940]  Gates and Fauci are never going to get away with this.
[2:10:37.940 --> 2:10:39.940]  They will never get away with this.
[2:10:39.940 --> 2:10:43.940]  They may wreck the U.S. economy and kill 100 million people from starvation.
[2:10:43.940 --> 2:10:51.940]  But at the end of the day, Bill Gates and Fauci and the New World Order, you own it all.
[2:10:51.940 --> 2:10:53.940]  So you think you can censor?
[2:10:53.940 --> 2:10:55.940]  You think you can have control?
[2:10:55.940 --> 2:10:57.940]  You think we don't know?
[2:10:57.940 --> 2:11:05.940]  We know!
[2:11:05.940 --> 2:11:13.940]  And as I get into deeper hot water with these people, my flesh is like, man, I really don't want to go to prison or get killed.
[2:11:13.940 --> 2:11:15.940]  My spirit's like absolutely full speed.
[2:11:15.940 --> 2:11:19.940]  And it's the spirit that runs the show around here.
[2:11:19.940 --> 2:11:21.940]  But what I do know is this.
[2:11:21.940 --> 2:11:24.940]  I don't want to do all this and put all this out and have it for nothing.
[2:11:24.940 --> 2:11:26.940]  Do you understand, folks?
[2:11:26.940 --> 2:11:34.940]  What you're seeing is decades of research and decades of people supporting and decades of work to be at this point right now.
[2:11:34.940 --> 2:11:36.940]  This isn't about me.
[2:11:36.940 --> 2:11:38.940]  This is everything we did.
[2:11:38.940 --> 2:11:40.940]  And again, that isn't about kissing your ass.
[2:11:40.940 --> 2:11:42.940]  You have to understand this is what you did.
[2:11:42.940 --> 2:11:44.940]  And I'm not going to let you down here at the last moment.
[2:11:44.940 --> 2:11:48.940]  In fact, I mean, I'm very pleased actually to do this.
[2:11:48.940 --> 2:11:50.940]  I'm just like, God, can you make it quick?
[2:11:50.940 --> 2:11:52.940]  Can they just kill me?
[2:11:52.940 --> 2:11:54.940]  I'm like, all right, I'm ready for that.
[2:11:54.940 --> 2:11:58.940]  So I always knew this was coming and I always knew it.
[2:11:58.940 --> 2:12:02.940]  I'm going to take it and they rolled me out as a vegetable and they got a chip in my head.
[2:12:02.940 --> 2:12:04.940]  And I'm saying stuff that is they got chips.
[2:12:04.940 --> 2:12:05.940]  Now they can put it in.
[2:12:05.940 --> 2:12:06.940]  They'll make you like literally it's a word chip again.
[2:12:06.940 --> 2:12:08.940]  You can make you say whatever you want.
[2:12:08.940 --> 2:12:09.940]  That's not all it shows.
[2:12:09.940 --> 2:12:10.940]  This is me.
[2:12:10.940 --> 2:12:11.940]  This is who I am.
[2:12:11.940 --> 2:12:12.940]  And this is what I stand for.
[2:12:12.940 --> 2:12:14.940]  Not what they destroy me or use me.
[2:12:14.940 --> 2:12:15.940]  That's my body.
[2:12:15.940 --> 2:12:16.940]  My spirit's going to be gone.
[2:12:16.940 --> 2:12:21.940]  I just like kind of like at the end of this is this could be the end folks just trying to like make accounts with people.
[2:12:21.940 --> 2:12:26.940]  And just try to set things up and just say, Hey, you know, let's get the deck chairs rearranged with Titanic.
[2:12:26.940 --> 2:12:29.940]  Because here's the news you need to know folks.
[2:12:29.940 --> 2:12:32.940]  It's all going down.
[2:12:32.940 --> 2:12:40.940]  The candy land of the partying and the movies and the sporting events and all the BS is over.
[2:12:40.940 --> 2:12:42.940]  And we we were adults.
[2:12:42.940 --> 2:12:47.940]  We got a lot better chance at a baby that's just in there.
[2:12:47.940 --> 2:12:51.940]  Waiting to see the universe just.
[2:12:51.940 --> 2:12:53.940]  And here comes the acid bath.
[2:12:53.940 --> 2:12:54.940]  Here comes the knives.
[2:12:54.940 --> 2:12:55.940]  Here comes the vacuum cleaner.
[2:12:55.940 --> 2:12:57.940]  Shut the back of said.
[2:12:57.940 --> 2:12:59.940]  And so whenever you feel sorry for yourself.
[2:12:59.940 --> 2:13:03.940]  When you strap down on a table and they're pulling your teeth out or whatever it is.
[2:13:03.940 --> 2:13:09.940]  Remember, babies went through this.
[2:13:09.940 --> 2:13:19.940]  You got to take your legs because we summoned this with all the devil worship and the corruption and the abortion and the pedophilia.
[2:13:19.940 --> 2:13:24.940]  We asked for this and God gives you what you want.
[2:13:24.940 --> 2:13:27.940]  We don't want God.
[2:13:27.940 --> 2:13:29.940]  We want the devil.
[2:13:29.940 --> 2:13:36.940]  Well, guess what you're going to get the devil and all of you that serve Satan and think this is funny and think that you're in charge.
[2:13:36.940 --> 2:13:44.940]  You are going to beg God to help you and God's not going to come.
[2:13:44.940 --> 2:13:46.940]  And I don't take any pleasure in that.
[2:13:46.940 --> 2:13:57.940]  Except I know that at least all of these buildings and all this Hollywood stuff and all this petty, it's all going to burn to the ground.
[2:13:57.940 --> 2:14:07.940]  Every stick of it, every level of it, you, all of you, all of you billionaires that you're going to hide in your bunkers.
[2:14:07.940 --> 2:14:12.940]  That's hilarious.
[2:14:12.940 --> 2:14:16.940]  You think you can't trust the soldiers you're with.
[2:14:16.940 --> 2:14:19.940]  You can't trust the robots you're with.
[2:14:19.940 --> 2:14:33.940]  And the minute everything goes dead when you're in that dead zone.
[2:14:33.940 --> 2:14:36.940]  You're not going to get tortured to death.
[2:14:36.940 --> 2:14:44.940]  Like you do somebody you're never going to know when a cold piece of steel gets run right into your vertebra in the back of your neck.
[2:14:44.940 --> 2:14:46.940]  Just like that, like a cockroach.
[2:14:46.940 --> 2:14:51.940]  When you step on a cockroach, you don't take pleasure and you're like, God, cockroach, I killed it.
[2:14:51.940 --> 2:14:53.940]  Hey, sorry, God, but you're really gross.
[2:14:53.940 --> 2:14:54.940]  You're a carrion bug.
[2:14:54.940 --> 2:14:55.940]  You eat dead meat.
[2:14:55.940 --> 2:14:56.940]  You're dangerous.
[2:14:56.940 --> 2:14:58.940]  My instincts say kill you, but I don't take pleasure.
[2:14:58.940 --> 2:15:02.940]  It's going to just like that.
[2:15:02.940 --> 2:15:04.940]  It's like you just crash.
[2:15:04.940 --> 2:15:06.940]  You're like a toilet being flushed.
[2:15:06.940 --> 2:15:10.940]  And I just want you to know that you're going to die.
[2:15:10.940 --> 2:15:14.940]  I'm not the one that's going to kill you.
[2:15:14.940 --> 2:15:16.940]  But you're all dead.
[2:15:16.940 --> 2:15:21.940]  Every one of you that tries to protect your life and tries to dig into your holes because you stole all this money.
[2:15:21.940 --> 2:15:25.940]  You know, you committed all these crimes and you you're like dialing into this big plan.
[2:15:25.940 --> 2:15:29.940]  The only thing you can do now is turn against that big plan.
[2:15:29.940 --> 2:15:32.940]  See now is the time when all the games are over.
[2:15:32.940 --> 2:15:33.940]  All the jokes are over.
[2:15:33.940 --> 2:15:34.940]  All the delusions are over.
[2:15:34.940 --> 2:15:42.940]  Now it's the time of war and see all you guys like all want to be like these big officers and generals in this big war.
[2:15:42.940 --> 2:15:44.940]  You summon well.
[2:15:44.940 --> 2:15:46.940]  It's like the cross of iron.
[2:15:46.940 --> 2:15:47.940]  It's a great movie.
[2:15:47.940 --> 2:15:49.940]  Like the officer thinks he's up at the end.
[2:15:49.940 --> 2:15:50.940]  Like the Russians are taking over.
[2:15:50.940 --> 2:15:51.940]  The guy goes, here's your machine gun.
[2:15:51.940 --> 2:15:53.940]  Show us what a big man you are.
[2:15:53.940 --> 2:15:54.940]  I'm Dan Pilla.
[2:15:54.940 --> 2:15:57.940]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[2:15:57.940 --> 2:15:59.940]  I sued the IRS in one.
[2:15:59.940 --> 2:16:02.940]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[2:16:02.940 --> 2:16:07.940]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[2:16:07.940 --> 2:16:09.940]  I can help you too.
[2:16:09.940 --> 2:16:12.940]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[2:16:12.940 --> 2:16:14.940]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[2:16:14.940 --> 2:16:18.940]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[2:16:18.940 --> 2:16:22.940]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[2:16:22.940 --> 2:16:25.940]  This is a Corona crisis self-reliance alert.
[2:16:25.940 --> 2:16:34.940]  If you're worried about the power grid and the current crisis and want to generate your own supply of off-the-grid electrical power just in case, pay close attention.
[2:16:34.940 --> 2:16:35.940]  Here's why.
[2:16:35.940 --> 2:16:40.940]  A limited supply of solar backup generators will be available again in the next two weeks.
[2:16:40.940 --> 2:16:46.940]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical backup power when you get off the grid.
[2:16:46.940 --> 2:16:55.940]  And unlike gas generators, these solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:16:55.940 --> 2:17:05.940]  Dangerous weather, social unrest or overloaded grids this summer will not be a problem if you go to mysolarbackup.com and get your solar backup generator.
[2:17:05.940 --> 2:17:10.940]  We regret that supplies are limited and only available on a first-come, first-served basis.
[2:17:10.940 --> 2:17:13.940]  Check availability at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:17:13.940 --> 2:17:16.940]  Never suffer painful power outages again.
[2:17:16.940 --> 2:17:18.940]  Go to mysolarbackup.com.
[2:17:18.940 --> 2:17:21.940]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[2:17:53.940 --> 2:17:55.940]  The official numbers are now in.
[2:17:55.940 --> 2:18:00.940]  The United States is in the biggest financial collapse in our history.
[2:18:00.940 --> 2:18:07.940]  This is the worst employment collapse in U.S. history by a very wide margin, writes Michael Snyder at the Economic Collapse Block.
[2:18:07.940 --> 2:18:13.940]  At this point we should no longer speak of economic collapse as something that will happen in the future.
[2:18:13.940 --> 2:18:15.940]  It is now here.
[2:18:15.940 --> 2:18:19.940]  And he does an excellent job in the article on infowars.com of laying it out.
[2:18:19.940 --> 2:18:21.940]  This was done by design.
[2:18:21.940 --> 2:18:34.940]  Trump fought to open the economy, but the hijacked blue cities and states with the tricombs and with Hollywood and the media held America underwater until we sucked it into our lungs.
[2:18:34.940 --> 2:18:37.940]  And now we're lying there like a fish dying.
[2:18:37.940 --> 2:18:39.940]  There's not much time to get the water out of our lungs.
[2:18:39.940 --> 2:18:46.940]  So remember for decades to come when millions starve to death worldwide and you live in slums with no medicine.
[2:18:46.940 --> 2:18:53.940]  The globalist did this. The globalist did this. The globalist did this. The globalist did this.
[2:18:53.940 --> 2:18:57.940]  How do you put a people under house arrest? How do you put them under siege?
[2:18:57.940 --> 2:19:05.940]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist deep state and then had China release.
[2:19:05.940 --> 2:19:11.940]  To then take down the populist president and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[2:19:11.940 --> 2:19:14.940]  Bill Maher even admitted it. Man, I hope we have a depression.
[2:19:14.940 --> 2:19:30.940]  And now they've tailored the whole thing where the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed along with the help of the blue cities and blue states all the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[2:19:30.940 --> 2:19:37.940]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us. But as for me, I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it.
[2:19:37.940 --> 2:19:43.940]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody safe. But that's not what they're doing.
[2:19:43.940 --> 2:20:06.940]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health, our whole world and committing millions of third world people to death.
[2:20:06.940 --> 2:20:16.940]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups. You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[2:20:16.940 --> 2:20:25.940]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:25.940 --> 2:20:32.940]  I'll host a little bit in the next hour. I promise to go to all the callers, Bill and Logan and Patrick and Jason and James and Kathy's there.
[2:20:32.940 --> 2:20:40.940]  We'll get to Kathy and Seth. Kathy's next. But Dell Bigtree put out Vax, reached tens of millions of people, got censored.
[2:20:40.940 --> 2:20:45.940]  That's a whole other story. But what's interesting is, is that Dell's moved awesome. We're glad to have him here.
[2:20:45.940 --> 2:20:50.940]  Well, they did a great job on David Night Show. I'm like, oh, that guy lives here. We need to get him in studio.
[2:20:50.940 --> 2:21:00.940]  What is your journey first up front, exposing the fact that vaccines do have bad reactions, that the inserts say it, but you're not supposed to say it.
[2:21:00.940 --> 2:21:10.940]  And now medical doctors that own major clinics go out and say, hey, this COVID-19 thing is massively overblown, and then they get banned.
[2:21:10.940 --> 2:21:16.940]  It's like suddenly all the denial is over. It's like it's in our face. So what do you want to hit first?
[2:21:16.940 --> 2:21:23.940]  Thanks for being here. How you woke up and what took you on this journey of Vax or the crazy moment we're in right now?
[2:21:23.940 --> 2:21:30.940]  Well, let me look. I think the first thing I'd like to say is, you know, my background as I started as a producer of the daytime CBS Talk Show, the doctors.
[2:21:30.940 --> 2:21:35.940]  I won an Emmy Award celebrating the best that science and doctors and medicine had to offer. So I'm a fan of science.
[2:21:35.940 --> 2:21:41.940]  I come at my perspective on this from a scientific point of view. I was tipped off. There was a whistleblower at the CDC.
[2:21:41.940 --> 2:21:42.940]  You want me to look right in the camera?
[2:21:42.940 --> 2:21:43.940]  You're right there at $4.
[2:21:43.940 --> 2:21:44.940]  All right. So I was tipped off.
[2:21:44.940 --> 2:21:46.940]  Yeah, I could have said you're a big time producer.
[2:21:46.940 --> 2:21:51.940]  All right. Well, you're like Paul or Saul on the road to Damascus.
[2:21:51.940 --> 2:21:55.940]  Right. So I'm used to, you know, having to work for pharmaceutical sponsors.
[2:21:55.940 --> 2:21:58.940]  You know, I was aware that there was certain things you could talk about, couldn't talk about.
[2:21:58.940 --> 2:22:07.940]  So I came upon the story of Dr. William Thompson at the CDC that came forward and said they were committing scientific fraud on the MMR Autism Studies.
[2:22:07.940 --> 2:22:10.940]  That's what got me into Vax. I made a documentary about that.
[2:22:10.940 --> 2:22:12.940]  And that sort of started a conversation.
[2:22:12.940 --> 2:22:15.940]  So you're a news producer investigator. You're following stories.
[2:22:15.940 --> 2:22:17.940]  That's right. I was just following stories. It's just a great story, right?
[2:22:17.940 --> 2:22:22.940]  You got a whistleblower inside the CDC. You got one of our top scientists saying we're committing scientific fraud in here.
[2:22:22.940 --> 2:22:23.940]  That's a get, right?
[2:22:23.940 --> 2:22:28.940]  I mean, as a reporter, you want to grab that story, but CBS and the doctors wouldn't let me tell that story.
[2:22:28.940 --> 2:22:30.940]  So I had to leave my television career.
[2:22:30.940 --> 2:22:40.940]  I knew I was putting it at risk, but the story was too important, you know, to see top scientists, you know, manipulating data, kicking kids off of a study, committing scientific fraud.
[2:22:40.940 --> 2:22:43.940]  But what's that moment? Is you're a big producer, top TV show making a lot of money?
[2:22:43.940 --> 2:22:44.940]  Yeah.
[2:22:44.940 --> 2:22:47.940]  I mean, let me guess, you just could not do it. It was a compulsion.
[2:22:47.940 --> 2:22:52.940]  Is that it? It's just that. I mean, the truth is, you know, I've always wanted to tell the truth.
[2:22:52.940 --> 2:22:55.940]  I've always wanted to share important stories.
[2:22:55.940 --> 2:23:02.940]  And one of the things when I was on the doctors, people would say I was, the lawyer for the doctors would say I was the most controversial doctor and cost more money than anyone.
[2:23:02.940 --> 2:23:09.940]  Because I tend to not trust companies that make billions of dollars that tell us that what they're doing is that they're out there for my health and my safety.
[2:23:09.940 --> 2:23:12.940]  I'm skeptical. And so I've gone after big stories.
[2:23:12.940 --> 2:23:15.940]  And so it's important to me to criticize mainstream media.
[2:23:15.940 --> 2:23:18.940]  But five, 10, 20 years ago, they were doing a better job than I'm doing.
[2:23:18.940 --> 2:23:22.940]  They were like, they were covered. What happened? When did it get where they wouldn't cover anything?
[2:23:22.940 --> 2:23:28.940]  Well, I mean, thinking a lot of things was, you know, when we made it a private, you know, we made news, private industry, right?
[2:23:28.940 --> 2:23:32.940]  Where sponsors and advertisers and making money, you know, became a part of the deal.
[2:23:32.940 --> 2:23:38.940]  It's a freedom, right? But it also made it so that now we've got to present what our, you know, sponsors are telling us.
[2:23:38.940 --> 2:23:46.940]  And what people, you say it all the time, the truth is, is 50% to 70% of the advertising and television is being paid for by the pharmaceutical industry.
[2:23:46.940 --> 2:23:52.940]  That means everyone we're watching, every news anchor, every reporter works for pharma, essentially. That's where they get paid.
[2:23:52.940 --> 2:23:55.940]  And that's what teleprompters have got to have it pre-approved.
[2:23:55.940 --> 2:23:59.940]  Correct. It's pre-approved. I think half the time they don't even know what they're about to say until they're reading it right there.
[2:23:59.940 --> 2:24:07.940]  You're watching Chris Cuomo starting to seem to have some sort of conscience about, now that I've stepped away, I'm tired of what I'm being, you know, not getting to speak my mind.
[2:24:07.940 --> 2:24:12.940]  That's why I left television. That's why I'm here. I'm sure it's why you're here. We get to speak our mind.
[2:24:12.940 --> 2:24:15.940]  Are you happy now being independent and you were there?
[2:24:15.940 --> 2:24:21.940]  I'm as happy as I've ever been because I now know the truth. I'm now able to say anything that I want to say.
[2:24:21.940 --> 2:24:25.940]  Exactly. Why is telling the truth more valuable than the Ferrari or the like, the seven bedroom?
[2:24:25.940 --> 2:24:29.940]  Like, you're happy with the three? It's like telling the truth is the real currency.
[2:24:29.940 --> 2:24:35.940]  Well, I would like to think that that's what draws all people to journalism, right, and into investigation.
[2:24:35.940 --> 2:24:44.940]  Unfortunately, the system set up where you're, I mean, I think there's a lot of reporters like me that are stuck in the system where they're not allowed to say or do what they want to do.
[2:24:44.940 --> 2:24:52.940]  They're working for somebody else. And so I have freed myself from that and I've been involved and luckily people support the work that I do.
[2:24:52.940 --> 2:24:57.940]  And what a saga, though. Because when I have producers online, not a few of your stats are doing what you've done.
[2:24:57.940 --> 2:25:03.940]  It's never about them, but it's like that personal journey. I think everybody else is a way to like navigate what they're doing in their own lives.
[2:25:03.940 --> 2:25:08.940]  Yeah, I mean, I think that I would say that in many ways, there's something much bigger than all of us.
[2:25:08.940 --> 2:25:13.940]  I think we're guided to be, I feel like I'm lucky. I think we all have a destiny and you're lucky if you find it.
[2:25:13.940 --> 2:25:14.940]  I feel really grateful.
[2:25:14.940 --> 2:25:18.940]  And if you start doing what you absolutely feels the right thing, it gets better, doesn't it?
[2:25:18.940 --> 2:25:20.940]  It gets better. It gets more intense.
[2:25:20.940 --> 2:25:24.940]  It gets more intense. It gets easier more and more and more people start handing you information.
[2:25:24.940 --> 2:25:28.940]  And, you know, you start finding, you know, you're in the middle of something really important.
[2:25:28.940 --> 2:25:33.940]  And as you said, we are now, you know, what used to be a conspiracy theory is no longer a theory, right?
[2:25:33.940 --> 2:25:37.940]  We are now being told by Gates and Fauci and Berks and the WHO.
[2:25:37.940 --> 2:25:40.940]  We're going to microchip you. We're going to force inject you.
[2:25:40.940 --> 2:25:42.940]  We're going to have drones flying over you. We're going to track your iPhone.
[2:25:42.940 --> 2:25:46.940]  And so the question is not, this is no longer a theory and I'm no longer a conspiracy theorist.
[2:25:46.940 --> 2:25:47.940]  I warned you about this.
[2:25:47.940 --> 2:25:48.940]  It's a reality.
[2:25:48.940 --> 2:25:51.940]  Now it's a reality. The question is, is this a reality we're willing to accept?
[2:25:51.940 --> 2:25:53.940]  I mean, that's the only question left. It's not if it's going to happen.
[2:25:53.940 --> 2:25:58.940]  And that's why there's an act on men because fundamentally once men see an enemy,
[2:25:58.940 --> 2:25:59.940]  they get motivated to attack it.
[2:25:59.940 --> 2:26:03.940]  That's right. And that's what driving them. I think that's what drives a lot of us is that I really,
[2:26:03.940 --> 2:26:06.940]  people won't say you're altruistic. You're out there. You're trying to save humanity.
[2:26:06.940 --> 2:26:08.940]  No, I'm trying to save my own kid. It's really that.
[2:26:08.940 --> 2:26:09.940]  Exactly.
[2:26:09.940 --> 2:26:10.940]  I have two kids at home.
[2:26:10.940 --> 2:26:11.940]  Bowling down. That's it.
[2:26:11.940 --> 2:26:13.940]  If I was bowling down to something that was better, I could do it.
[2:26:13.940 --> 2:26:15.940]  I'm bowling down to death.
[2:26:15.940 --> 2:26:16.940]  That's right.
[2:26:16.940 --> 2:26:18.940]  How do you like make a deal with that? You don't do that.
[2:26:18.940 --> 2:26:20.940]  You either attack and succeed or you die.
[2:26:20.940 --> 2:26:25.940]  I think that that's it. I mean, I don't want to see what happens if I'm in a world where they're coming through my door
[2:26:25.940 --> 2:26:29.940]  and taking my kid because maybe they're testing positive for COVID-19.
[2:26:29.940 --> 2:26:31.940]  We're coming to take your kid.
[2:26:31.940 --> 2:26:35.940]  They're telling you right there. That's their plan. Are you in agreement with that plan?
[2:26:35.940 --> 2:26:37.940]  Is that the world you want to live in?
[2:26:37.940 --> 2:26:42.940]  We decide that here and now. This is the moment we decide how we vote, what we do, what we stand for.
[2:26:42.940 --> 2:26:44.940]  I'm going to say, whether or not you call this moment then.
[2:26:44.940 --> 2:26:45.940]  The call this moment?
[2:26:45.940 --> 2:26:47.940]  I mean, this moment is the big decision.
[2:26:47.940 --> 2:26:52.940]  This is the moment. This is the moment. How we see this. Are we afraid? Are we going to live in fear?
[2:26:52.940 --> 2:26:57.940]  Do we think this imaginary, you know, the enemy, this virus is really that dangerous?
[2:26:57.940 --> 2:26:59.940]  And how dangerous would it? This is the question.
[2:26:59.940 --> 2:27:04.940]  How dangerous would it have to be for you to give up everything you knew about your life to be imprisoned
[2:27:04.940 --> 2:27:05.940]  but trying to take over the world?
[2:27:05.940 --> 2:27:07.940]  Because by the way, they're back online. They're working.
[2:27:07.940 --> 2:27:10.940]  They have 1.5 billion people going back to work.
[2:27:10.940 --> 2:27:12.940]  Either they're not afraid of it, whether they've lied to us.
[2:27:12.940 --> 2:27:13.940]  I don't care.
[2:27:13.940 --> 2:27:14.940]  The point is...
[2:27:14.940 --> 2:27:15.940]  The point is so obvious.
[2:27:15.940 --> 2:27:22.940]  The point is, is what would you risk in order to hold on and preserve that world that we grew up before our children?
[2:27:22.940 --> 2:27:27.940]  Exactly. If we launched a real bio attack that was killing millions, we'd know we'd work. We'd defeat them.
[2:27:27.940 --> 2:27:32.940]  But instead, it's just like...it turns out the whole thing's basically a hoax. It's way overblown.
[2:27:32.940 --> 2:27:34.940]  And then now medical...how big is that though?
[2:27:34.940 --> 2:27:39.940]  Like you said, medical doctors in good standing can't have a press conference in America.
[2:27:39.940 --> 2:27:40.940]  Can't have a press conference.
[2:27:40.940 --> 2:27:44.940]  That means America's gone. I mean, YouTube...what is Trump doing?
[2:27:44.940 --> 2:27:47.940]  What is the Justice Department doing, letting Big Tech do this?
[2:27:47.940 --> 2:27:55.940]  Well, I mean, as you've stated, I think that Donald Trump is trying to weave his way around a, you know, a snake pit right now.
[2:27:55.940 --> 2:27:58.940]  Who's on his side? I mean, you have to have people working for you.
[2:27:58.940 --> 2:28:02.940]  I'm not sure. When I look at him, who can he trust? Who can he trust to carry something down the road?
[2:28:02.940 --> 2:28:03.940]  He's totally surrounded.
[2:28:03.940 --> 2:28:04.940]  He's totally surrounded.
[2:28:04.940 --> 2:28:10.940]  And so, you know, whether or not he's right on everything or wrong on anything, he's getting terrible information from all sides.
[2:28:10.940 --> 2:28:11.940]  I've never seen a man...
[2:28:11.940 --> 2:28:13.940]  Well, they lied to him. They say, sir, say this.
[2:28:13.940 --> 2:28:14.940]  Right. Yeah.
[2:28:14.940 --> 2:28:17.940]  Yeah, I think that there's a lot to it. So what can he do about YouTube?
[2:28:17.940 --> 2:28:20.940]  If my crew was like that, I could...this crew is awesome. They put up my...
[2:28:20.940 --> 2:28:22.940]  This is an amazing crew. I can barely do the show.
[2:28:22.940 --> 2:28:24.940]  Imagine Trump surrounded by snakes.
[2:28:24.940 --> 2:28:26.940]  It's amazing watching him.
[2:28:26.940 --> 2:28:31.940]  And under those circumstances, I think it's incredible, you know, he said he wants out.
[2:28:31.940 --> 2:28:36.940]  He said, look, he said months ago that this is going to be less than one percent, the death rate, and he got attacked.
[2:28:36.940 --> 2:28:38.940]  It's proving all science is back in the set.
[2:28:38.940 --> 2:28:41.940]  I mean, I don't know how it is to blow up and start just overturning tables.
[2:28:41.940 --> 2:28:43.940]  Well, I mean, that's the case, right? At some point...
[2:28:43.940 --> 2:28:45.940]  Stay there. Stay there. We'll be right back.
[2:28:45.940 --> 2:28:46.940]  All right, cool.
[2:28:46.940 --> 2:29:12.940]  We'll be right back.
[2:29:16.940 --> 2:29:23.940]  We'll be right back.
[2:29:46.940 --> 2:30:08.940]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[2:30:08.940 --> 2:30:19.940]  Super male vitality specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[2:30:19.940 --> 2:30:30.940]  Now, look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses, and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:30:30.940 --> 2:30:36.940]  Yes, we're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology,
[2:30:36.940 --> 2:30:43.940]  working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[2:30:43.940 --> 2:30:46.940]  So what are you waiting for? Go to the InfoWars store.
[2:30:46.940 --> 2:30:49.940]  Never been a better time than right now.
[2:30:49.940 --> 2:30:54.940]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:30:54.940 --> 2:31:02.940]  Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[2:31:02.940 --> 2:31:14.940]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[2:31:14.940 --> 2:31:25.940]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out, they can simply look at us and say, because, again, you are non-essential.
[2:31:25.940 --> 2:31:28.940]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[2:31:28.940 --> 2:31:32.940]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[2:31:32.940 --> 2:31:36.940]  We can be told to stay on our houses, and after all, shut up.
[2:31:36.940 --> 2:31:42.940]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways. It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that emerge with machines.
[2:31:42.940 --> 2:31:45.940]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[2:31:45.940 --> 2:31:48.940]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[2:31:48.940 --> 2:31:53.940]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[2:31:53.940 --> 2:32:00.940]  The America that we've known and loved, the America that was the land of the free home of the brave, is dying right now.
[2:32:00.940 --> 2:32:07.940]  And everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us, shutting us down and making us dependent on them.
[2:32:07.940 --> 2:32:12.940]  The food shortages have begun. The depression is going to be long and very, very serious.
[2:32:12.940 --> 2:32:14.940]  In fact, it's probably too late now to even turn back.
[2:32:14.940 --> 2:32:18.940]  Trump tried to stop it, but the mainstream media working with the tricoms blocked it.
[2:32:18.940 --> 2:32:22.940]  That's why you and myself, everybody else, has to get prepared now.
[2:32:22.940 --> 2:32:26.940]  Do not wait. It's not about the virus. It's about the economic chaos.
[2:32:26.940 --> 2:32:29.940]  It's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year.

[2:32:34.940 --> 2:32:38.940]  The food supply is running out. There are major shortages.
[2:32:38.940 --> 2:32:43.940]  This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism.
[2:32:43.940 --> 2:32:46.940]  But we, the people, the patriots, have to be prepared.
[2:32:46.940 --> 2:32:48.940]  We've already been proven right about prepping so far.
[2:32:48.940 --> 2:32:50.940]  We'll get ready to be really proven right.

[2:32:56.940 --> 2:33:00.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:33:08.940 --> 2:33:12.940]  Dale Bigtree's here with us in studio, TheHighWire.com.
[2:33:12.940 --> 2:33:18.940]  He's the producer of Vaxx, one of the biggest and most censored documentaries of many, many years.
[2:33:18.940 --> 2:33:21.940]  He's on fire. And I remember interviewing you years ago.
[2:33:21.940 --> 2:33:25.940]  I've seen other shows. You've always been powerful, but I can just see now.
[2:33:25.940 --> 2:33:30.940]  You've stepped out there and you're free. There's no filter.
[2:33:30.940 --> 2:33:32.940]  And that's really what the establishment fears.
[2:33:32.940 --> 2:33:34.940]  They want to always put these filters on.
[2:33:34.940 --> 2:33:38.940]  But as the censorship intensifies, I don't see Americans bowing to it.
[2:33:38.940 --> 2:33:41.940]  I see them actually saying no.
[2:33:41.940 --> 2:33:44.940]  I think it's almost like a badge of honor now. It's what you look for, right?
[2:33:44.940 --> 2:33:47.940]  If you see a flag across the video, I think more and more now,
[2:33:47.940 --> 2:33:49.940]  you're saying, I want to look at that. That must be important.
[2:33:49.940 --> 2:33:53.940]  We're realizing so much. For the first time, really, we're waking up to the idea,
[2:33:53.940 --> 2:33:55.940]  oh, my God, the news is lying to me, right?
[2:33:55.940 --> 2:33:59.940]  If you do your own investigation now, you see virologists, mathematicians,
[2:33:59.940 --> 2:34:01.940]  you know, top scientists all around the world.
[2:34:01.940 --> 2:34:04.940]  The discoverer of HIV and Nobel Prize winners says it's man-made.
[2:34:04.940 --> 2:34:06.940]  And they're banning him.
[2:34:06.940 --> 2:34:10.940]  Right. They're banning him. They're banning people, banning doctors, banning MDs,
[2:34:10.940 --> 2:34:12.940]  and saying, we're not going to represent.
[2:34:12.940 --> 2:34:14.940]  We're not going to let anyone talk about anything that is not approved by the WHO.
[2:34:14.940 --> 2:34:18.940]  The WHO is not an American agency.
[2:34:18.940 --> 2:34:21.940]  That is great. That shows fear, doesn't it?
[2:34:21.940 --> 2:34:23.940]  That shows they're desperate.
[2:34:23.940 --> 2:34:24.940]  They are desperate.
[2:34:24.940 --> 2:34:26.940]  Is this man-made out of that lab?
[2:34:26.940 --> 2:34:30.940]  Well, I mean, look, that's where you're at. I'm not sure. I'm still in the fence.
[2:34:30.940 --> 2:34:32.940]  But it doesn't matter. Here's what I say.
[2:34:32.940 --> 2:34:35.940]  If it's man-made, if this is a bio-weapons, one of the weakest bio-weapons we've ever seen.
[2:34:35.940 --> 2:34:37.940]  I mean, that's what we know.
[2:34:37.940 --> 2:34:40.940]  I'm saying it's man-made, so they own it.
[2:34:40.940 --> 2:34:42.940]  Right. They own it. Yeah.
[2:34:42.940 --> 2:34:46.940]  Well, so, I mean, the idea ends up being, why can't we ask any of the important questions, right?
[2:34:46.940 --> 2:34:48.940]  Why are we not allowed to ask questions about what's happening?
[2:34:48.940 --> 2:34:52.940]  Questions about, you know, the authority, about, you know, Fauci and Birx.
[2:34:52.940 --> 2:34:56.940]  I mean, the United States of America is founded on the Fourth Estate,
[2:34:56.940 --> 2:34:59.940]  freedom of speech, and the idea that journalists are supposed to ask the hard-
[2:34:59.940 --> 2:35:02.940]  And I'm not going to give it to Donald Trump or Tucker last now, but he was on fire.
[2:35:02.940 --> 2:35:08.940]  I mean, since when in America can medical doctors not have a press conference?
[2:35:08.940 --> 2:35:10.940]  Trump must act.
[2:35:10.940 --> 2:35:12.940]  I can say he's surrounded in all this.
[2:35:12.940 --> 2:35:14.940]  This is racketeering. This is criminal.
[2:35:14.940 --> 2:35:17.940]  Who the hell says medical doctors can't have a press conference now?
[2:35:17.940 --> 2:35:21.940]  I think it's treason. I mean, I think you can go as far as if you have an American company that's saying
[2:35:21.940 --> 2:35:24.940]  that we're going to side with foreign agents in their opinion, right?
[2:35:24.940 --> 2:35:26.940]  And they say that the head of a YouTube, as you know, tell folks.
[2:35:26.940 --> 2:35:27.940]  Right.
[2:35:27.940 --> 2:35:32.940]  She goes and says, I only do what the UN says, and you don't say what this group says you're banned.
[2:35:32.940 --> 2:35:36.940]  Right. That's incredible. You know, and we all know that Donald Trump is now not aligned with the W.
[2:35:36.940 --> 2:35:37.940]  Joe, he's not funding it.
[2:35:37.940 --> 2:35:40.940]  So he's telling me that the president of the United States, can he be banned?
[2:35:40.940 --> 2:35:42.940]  Is he not going to be able to get on YouTube? And what are we talking about?
[2:35:42.940 --> 2:35:43.940]  It doesn't matter.
[2:35:43.940 --> 2:35:46.940]  They've announced on Twitter now that they're not just burying his tweets.
[2:35:46.940 --> 2:35:49.940]  They're putting stuff over it. They've actually hijacked the president.
[2:35:49.940 --> 2:35:51.940]  It's terrible. It's terrifying.
[2:35:51.940 --> 2:35:56.940]  So what comes next then, Mr. Big Tree, because we've already hit 11, like spinal tap in Miami.
[2:35:56.940 --> 2:35:59.940]  Where does it go? Because I expected this, but I thought it would be gradual.
[2:35:59.940 --> 2:36:01.940]  They thought, like, boom.
[2:36:01.940 --> 2:36:02.940]  I think that's their mistake, right?
[2:36:02.940 --> 2:36:05.940]  I think that for some reason they've jumped the shark here. They've jumped ahead.
[2:36:05.940 --> 2:36:09.940]  You and I have been saying for years, even you, much longer than I, this is coming.
[2:36:09.940 --> 2:36:10.940]  They're going to try.
[2:36:10.940 --> 2:36:13.940]  I've been saying pharmaceutical industry is going to try and take over the world.
[2:36:13.940 --> 2:36:15.940]  They are the biggest lobby all around the world.
[2:36:15.940 --> 2:36:16.940]  They're going to make an attempt.
[2:36:16.940 --> 2:36:19.940]  But clearly they don't have a vaccine ready, which I think they would have.
[2:36:19.940 --> 2:36:21.940]  I think they would have wanted to have a vaccine ready.
[2:36:21.940 --> 2:36:24.940]  If this was really a part of a plan, they've jumped ahead of themselves.
[2:36:24.940 --> 2:36:27.940]  They're ahead of themselves, which puts us in a power position.
[2:36:27.940 --> 2:36:29.940]  That's what both the smart guys think, right?
[2:36:29.940 --> 2:36:31.940]  Something they were cooking up late.
[2:36:31.940 --> 2:36:35.940]  Yeah, something got out, something has made them, now they're off balance.
[2:36:35.940 --> 2:36:37.940]  Now they are like the reason the story every single day.
[2:36:37.940 --> 2:36:38.940]  He looks like he's dying.
[2:36:38.940 --> 2:36:40.940]  Yeah, he looks like he's dying.
[2:36:40.940 --> 2:36:43.940]  Deborah Birx, Fauci, they keep changing the talking points.
[2:36:43.940 --> 2:36:44.940]  They're moving the goalposts.
[2:36:44.940 --> 2:36:47.940]  What they said yesterday, they're going against it today.
[2:36:47.940 --> 2:36:50.940]  And the same thing is like, well, look it, having antibodies doesn't mean you have immunity.
[2:36:50.940 --> 2:36:54.940]  Oh, so then that's how you determine that every vaccine works is by the end of the body.
[2:36:54.940 --> 2:36:55.940]  They're all vaccine standards.
[2:36:55.940 --> 2:36:57.940]  Absolutely. They're destroying their own vaccine program.
[2:36:57.940 --> 2:36:58.940]  Explaining that, people.
[2:36:58.940 --> 2:37:04.940]  See, the only way they've ever been able to determine that a vaccine works because they can't challenge you with the actual virus.
[2:37:04.940 --> 2:37:05.940]  They just say, do you have antibodies?
[2:37:05.940 --> 2:37:13.940]  And now their argument so that we don't develop herd immunity naturally is, well, we're not sure that your antibodies are actually going to protect you with COVID-19.
[2:37:13.940 --> 2:37:17.940]  Well, it would be the first virus in the history of mankind that that would be true for.
[2:37:17.940 --> 2:37:18.940]  It's a complete speculation.
[2:37:18.940 --> 2:37:27.940]  But if we cannot measure antibodies as proof that you have immunity, then you have just erased the entire way that we decide whether a vaccine works or not.
[2:37:27.940 --> 2:37:30.940]  So are you telling me 100 year old methodology?
[2:37:30.940 --> 2:37:35.940]  That's right. And I think I've had questions about it anyway, because you've got them, right?
[2:37:35.940 --> 2:37:37.940]  Because you've got antibodies don't mean you beat them.
[2:37:37.940 --> 2:37:40.940]  Well, and vaccines have never been able to do what natural immunity does.
[2:37:40.940 --> 2:37:44.940]  When you get the illness, you have a full cellular innate immune response, right?
[2:37:44.940 --> 2:37:47.940]  Antibodies is the secondary response is the second part of it.
[2:37:47.940 --> 2:37:49.940]  A vaccine can only create antibodies.
[2:37:49.940 --> 2:37:55.940]  We there's always been a thought that our body as one cellular unit, once we beat something, we own it.
[2:37:55.940 --> 2:37:56.940]  That's right.
[2:37:56.940 --> 2:37:58.940]  I call it the Ferrari of immunity.
[2:37:58.940 --> 2:38:00.940]  They're trying to sell us on the pinto of immunity.
[2:38:00.940 --> 2:38:01.940]  I got to get a one vaccine, two vaccines.
[2:38:01.940 --> 2:38:04.940]  We're talking about potentially five MMR vaccines throughout my life.
[2:38:04.940 --> 2:38:08.940]  The same YouTube that says, will ban you if you say zinc or vitamin D or tumor is good?
[2:38:08.940 --> 2:38:11.940]  Everybody knows that's incredibly badass.
[2:38:11.940 --> 2:38:13.940]  I mean, if you don't have that stuff, you die.
[2:38:13.940 --> 2:38:21.940]  And you have doctors with amazing results saying, look, I cured 800 people by using hydroxychloroquine to open up the cell and then putting zinc in there.
[2:38:21.940 --> 2:38:29.940]  Meanwhile, the guys trying to, not trying, they're SWAT teaming established medical doctors that have vitamin C clinics.
[2:38:29.940 --> 2:38:32.940]  I'm not even a big doctor person, but I've gone and gotten vitamin C things.
[2:38:32.940 --> 2:38:34.940]  Those make you feel great.
[2:38:34.940 --> 2:38:36.940]  They're SWAT teaming people now.
[2:38:36.940 --> 2:38:40.940]  I mean, we also know Colorado said that, you know, chiropractors were non-essential.
[2:38:40.940 --> 2:38:46.940]  They're going after, you know, Whole Foods markets and grocery stores and natural, you know, healing techniques.
[2:38:46.940 --> 2:38:48.940]  What, I mean, it shows you what this is really all about.
[2:38:48.940 --> 2:38:49.940]  They don't want us being protected.
[2:38:49.940 --> 2:38:50.940]  No, they don't.
[2:38:50.940 --> 2:38:51.940]  They don't.
[2:38:51.940 --> 2:38:52.940]  This is about an agenda.
[2:38:52.940 --> 2:38:54.940]  It's been an agenda they've been announcing for a long time.
[2:38:54.940 --> 2:38:59.940]  And it probably has a lot of other trimmings of banking and all sorts of other things that are problems in this world.
[2:38:59.940 --> 2:39:02.940]  But right now, your body, do you own your body?
[2:39:02.940 --> 2:39:07.940]  Do you, you know, do you get to control what's injected into you and injected into your children?
[2:39:07.940 --> 2:39:09.940]  Because this is what it all lies on.
[2:39:09.940 --> 2:39:10.940]  This is what it relies on.
[2:39:10.940 --> 2:39:16.940]  And by the way, we're talking about an illness as a 0.1 to 0.3 percent death rate now.
[2:39:16.940 --> 2:39:22.940]  It's not like those doctors said a lie. It'd be one thing. It turns out the death rates lower than what they said.
[2:39:22.940 --> 2:39:24.940]  Yeah. Yeah, they're being conservative.
[2:39:24.940 --> 2:39:26.940]  I mean, this death rate is almost non-existent.
[2:39:26.940 --> 2:39:32.940]  And think if we had known what this illness was, had Fauci done his job and said, hey, let's diagnose this illness, right?
[2:39:32.940 --> 2:39:33.940]  They're wrong.
[2:39:33.940 --> 2:39:37.940]  Exactly. Why is he the savior when all their models were 30, 20?
[2:39:37.940 --> 2:39:40.940]  Even their best models were 15 times higher than what happened.
[2:39:40.940 --> 2:39:42.940]  Yeah. And they keep backtracking.
[2:39:42.940 --> 2:39:45.940]  Can you imagine running a business where the guy running your numbers keeps going and said, I missed it by 2,000 percent?
[2:39:45.940 --> 2:39:49.940]  They know I'm accurate 95 percent of the time. They forgive me the 5 percent.
[2:39:49.940 --> 2:39:52.940]  If I had a record like these people, no one would listen to me.
[2:39:52.940 --> 2:39:54.940]  No one would listen to you. Everyone would be fired.
[2:39:54.940 --> 2:39:58.940]  You never hold on to someone that's wrong every single time they walk in.
[2:39:58.940 --> 2:40:03.940]  If you've got a restaurant 20 years and 10 people get food poisoning, it's not a problem.
[2:40:03.940 --> 2:40:06.940]  You start getting food poisoning every week. You shut down in a couple months.
[2:40:06.940 --> 2:40:12.940]  That's how information is. So how, if they're giving food poisoning to every person that eats there, how are they still open?
[2:40:12.940 --> 2:40:18.940]  I don't know. And really, it is tragic. When you see the push against, you know, really putting money into treatments now,
[2:40:18.940 --> 2:40:21.940]  all of the funding is going to a vaccine. We might have 18 months from now.
[2:40:21.940 --> 2:40:28.940]  What I call the vaccine unicorn, are we really basing all of our policy on hopes and dreams for something that may appear in the future?
[2:40:28.940 --> 2:40:30.940]  What about the confirmation?
[2:40:30.940 --> 2:40:36.940]  The confirmation, not that we needed this from USA Today, that they get $39,000 instead of $4,000 for every COVID-19 patient.
[2:40:36.940 --> 2:40:42.940]  So they tell the doctors, there's dozens of doctors I've seen online saying they're ordered to say it's COVID-19 when it's not.
[2:40:42.940 --> 2:40:45.940]  And put them on a ventilator, by the way. They're getting extra money to put them on a ventilator.
[2:40:45.940 --> 2:40:46.940]  Which kills people.
[2:40:46.940 --> 2:40:51.940]  Which kills people. 90% death rate if you're put on a ventilator. They're denying people oxygen.
[2:40:51.940 --> 2:40:52.940]  At least they were.
[2:40:52.940 --> 2:40:56.940]  And that's why they wanted more ventilators to kill more people in the computer model.
[2:40:56.940 --> 2:40:58.940]  The guys on top just show that number.
[2:40:58.940 --> 2:41:02.940]  When we look back, this death rate, maybe we know it's going to be higher than it should have been.
[2:41:02.940 --> 2:41:05.940]  It's right in part with the flu, but I think it would be non-existent. Have we treated these people?
[2:41:05.940 --> 2:41:10.940]  Let me ask you this. I mean, I say you're on fire right now.
[2:41:10.940 --> 2:41:16.940]  What are they going to pull next? Because the wheels are off, the hoax is exposed, everyone I know says it's a hoax.
[2:41:16.940 --> 2:41:20.940]  From family that thought I might have been wrong, what are you seeing on the ground?
[2:41:20.940 --> 2:41:24.940]  I think the biggest issue we have is we've got to look at the fall. We've got to look at states opening up.
[2:41:24.940 --> 2:41:28.940]  States opening up may have some infection rates go up. It's not a big deal. We have to deal with that.
[2:41:28.940 --> 2:41:33.940]  The virus is still out there. We didn't do our job. We didn't create herd immunity like Sweden just achieved.
[2:41:33.940 --> 2:41:37.940]  So there's a good chance that it's going to be here when we come out. We're going to have to deal with it.
[2:41:37.940 --> 2:41:41.940]  Or it's coming in the fall. Are we going to lock down again and absolutely obliterate the world we know?
[2:41:41.940 --> 2:41:45.940]  Or are we going to man up and say, you know what? 0.3% of us are going to get really sick.
[2:41:45.940 --> 2:41:48.940]  We now know how to treat it. We know not to put you on ventilators. We have things we can do.
[2:41:48.940 --> 2:41:52.940]  Let's really lock down our elderly, make sure that they're airtight for a couple months.
[2:41:52.940 --> 2:41:56.940]  And let's deal with this. Let's take it on, head on, and then save this nation.
[2:41:56.940 --> 2:42:02.940]  You are not a hero for sitting in your basement, playing Nintendo or watching Netflix right now.
[2:42:02.940 --> 2:42:07.940]  A hero steps up and says, you know what? I'm going to take on what appears to be a common cold for over 90% of us.
[2:42:07.940 --> 2:42:16.940]  And I'm going to create herd immunity so that America marches forth and becomes the powerful institution, economic power that we know we are.
[2:42:16.940 --> 2:42:20.940]  And by the way, the reason we're censored is guests like this. This is what they don't want.
[2:42:20.940 --> 2:42:23.940]  No, no, it's good. I'm saying the reason we're censored is the reality of this.
[2:42:23.940 --> 2:42:24.940]  That's reality.
[2:42:24.940 --> 2:42:27.940]  If they put that on CNN, they go from a million viewers to 10 million overnight.
[2:42:27.940 --> 2:42:29.940]  They know it works. They just don't want the truth.
[2:42:29.940 --> 2:42:32.940]  When we come back with our guests, wow, I'm blown away right now.
[2:42:32.940 --> 2:42:38.940]  Where does this go? I mean, I keep saying, what is the adventure we're going to choose?
[2:42:38.940 --> 2:42:42.940]  Because we're at that crossroads right now, and this hoax is confirmed.
[2:42:42.940 --> 2:42:47.940]  So what are we going to do right now? And what are curveballs the globalist can throw us?
[2:42:47.940 --> 2:43:00.940]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:43:17.940 --> 2:43:22.940]  With Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society,
[2:43:22.940 --> 2:43:25.940]  create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody. This is insane.
[2:43:25.940 --> 2:43:28.940]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[2:43:28.940 --> 2:43:31.940]  You need to get prepared now. You need to get high quality, swarble food.
[2:43:31.940 --> 2:43:38.940]  Now back in stock at infowarstore.com, and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[2:43:38.940 --> 2:43:44.940]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[2:43:44.940 --> 2:43:50.940]  This is beyond 1984. The tyranny of the dual orders here. Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war.
[2:43:50.940 --> 2:44:18.940]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[2:44:18.940 --> 2:44:28.940]  Waking people up to the new world order, Bohemian Grove, the American deep state, the rise of communist China,
[2:44:28.940 --> 2:44:37.940]  the plan for global depopulation, and global elite pedophiles who pray off of our young.
[2:44:37.940 --> 2:44:43.940]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us, but because of your support, our fight continues.
[2:44:43.940 --> 2:44:49.940]  Join us. Support the info war, and together we will slay the dragon.
[2:44:49.940 --> 2:44:54.940]  Keep fighting, Alex. You're the gladiator.
[2:44:54.940 --> 2:45:01.940]  Well, communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy used by half.
[2:45:01.940 --> 2:45:06.940]  And the United States wouldn't sign on to it. So guess what happened? Along came COVID-19,
[2:45:06.940 --> 2:45:11.940]  and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[2:45:11.940 --> 2:45:15.940]  And that means you're going to be poor now and under his control.
[2:45:15.940 --> 2:45:21.940]  And of course, with the medical tyranny comes the force inoculations, a microchip that comes with the vaccine,
[2:45:21.940 --> 2:45:27.940]  and so much more. And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[2:45:27.940 --> 2:45:32.940]  So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[2:45:32.940 --> 2:45:36.940]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long. Women own their bodies.
[2:45:36.940 --> 2:45:41.940]  Now say you don't own your body, and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[2:45:41.940 --> 2:45:44.940]  If you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home, market the beast.
[2:45:44.940 --> 2:45:49.940]  Oh, and guess what? Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates
[2:45:49.940 --> 2:45:54.940]  under a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face. They hate you and your family.
[2:45:54.940 --> 2:46:07.940]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[2:46:24.940 --> 2:46:52.940]  What are champions made of? Here's a man who can show you.
[2:46:55.940 --> 2:47:09.940]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:09.940 --> 2:47:13.940]  You are either with the republics or against it.
[2:47:13.940 --> 2:47:20.940]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:47:20.940 --> 2:47:26.940]  I feel an incredible weight on me to just tell the truth and get it right and rally people.
[2:47:26.940 --> 2:47:31.940]  And I know that Dale Bigtree, a well-known big national TV news producer, left it
[2:47:31.940 --> 2:47:34.940]  because they wouldn't let him expose vaccines. And what was on the inserts,
[2:47:34.940 --> 2:47:36.940]  you know, the inserts, they can hurt you or kill you. And they're like,
[2:47:36.940 --> 2:47:40.940]  no one ever got hurt by this. He's like, well, that says it can kill you right here.
[2:47:40.940 --> 2:47:43.940]  So here he is. He made, of course, vats.
[2:47:43.940 --> 2:47:48.940]  And that became a huge film despite all the censorship and all the crazy things that happened there.
[2:47:48.940 --> 2:47:51.940]  But Dale, we were talking in the break about what Trump needs to do,
[2:47:51.940 --> 2:47:54.940]  what we need to do at this historic crossroads,
[2:47:54.940 --> 2:47:58.940]  and how we counter this medical tyranny martial law takeover.
[2:47:58.940 --> 2:48:02.940]  Well, I mean, first of all, I think Trump's doing the best that he can.
[2:48:02.940 --> 2:48:05.940]  He needs to be surrounded by better people. I would like to see him get a team.
[2:48:05.940 --> 2:48:07.940]  I would like to see Donald Trump find a team.
[2:48:07.940 --> 2:48:10.940]  There's an international body of scientists, perhaps the majority of scientists
[2:48:10.940 --> 2:48:12.940]  around the world, mathematicians, virologists.
[2:48:12.940 --> 2:48:16.940]  They're saying that draconian measures not only didn't work, they were dangerous
[2:48:16.940 --> 2:48:18.940]  and have gotten more people killed.
[2:48:18.940 --> 2:48:23.940]  He needs that type of advice in there to sort of balance out what he's hearing.
[2:48:23.940 --> 2:48:26.940]  Tony Fauci, Berks have been dead wrong the whole time.
[2:48:26.940 --> 2:48:29.940]  Every model has been wrong. He needs to be bringing in people
[2:48:29.940 --> 2:48:32.940]  that have been modeling this correctly from the very beginning.
[2:48:32.940 --> 2:48:34.940]  He has put the funding. Look, he's done his job.
[2:48:34.940 --> 2:48:36.940]  He put the funding in a vaccine, eight billion dollars.
[2:48:36.940 --> 2:48:39.940]  He's looked at hydrochloroquine. He's done, he's locked things down.
[2:48:39.940 --> 2:48:41.940]  He's done what he has to do. But now how do we get out of this?
[2:48:41.940 --> 2:48:44.940]  And how do we move forward? And how do we deal with, look it,
[2:48:44.940 --> 2:48:47.940]  you know the big October surprise is going to be coronavirus again.
[2:48:47.940 --> 2:48:49.940]  Right? Is he planning for this? Is he ready for that?
[2:48:49.940 --> 2:48:52.940]  That's what I'd like to ask him and say, let's build a team around you.
[2:48:52.940 --> 2:48:54.940]  They're going to handle this in a better way.
[2:48:54.940 --> 2:48:56.940]  Exactly. They know he's about to win.
[2:48:56.940 --> 2:48:59.940]  And so they're going to, that's why Biden's saying, oh, Trump wants to cancel the election.
[2:48:59.940 --> 2:49:02.940]  No, they're going to use this to try to cancel the election and go,
[2:49:02.940 --> 2:49:04.940]  you don't really rule as the president.
[2:49:04.940 --> 2:49:06.940]  We need a committee now during the crisis.
[2:49:06.940 --> 2:49:08.940]  Right. Watch that.
[2:49:08.940 --> 2:49:10.940]  Well, and essentially that's what you're seeing around the world, right?
[2:49:10.940 --> 2:49:13.940]  We're seeing for the first time, you know, this is a world run by doctors,
[2:49:13.940 --> 2:49:16.940]  whether you're a dictator or a prime minister,
[2:49:16.940 --> 2:49:18.940]  they're all stepping aside and letting these, you know,
[2:49:18.940 --> 2:49:21.940]  the medical establishment driven really by one really bad model,
[2:49:21.940 --> 2:49:25.940]  Neil Ferguson, the imperial models, what drove this entire thing, you know,
[2:49:25.940 --> 2:49:27.940]  and then let's explain that.
[2:49:27.940 --> 2:49:31.940]  From day one, why are the people that were wrong about everything
[2:49:31.940 --> 2:49:34.940]  and who stand the game from this and who were involved
[2:49:34.940 --> 2:49:36.940]  in all these weapons testing with Wuhan,
[2:49:36.940 --> 2:49:40.940]  why are the very culprits involved in the response?
[2:49:40.940 --> 2:49:43.940]  Because none of it has to do with being correct.
[2:49:43.940 --> 2:49:46.940]  It all has to do with everybody involved right now has one goal in mind.
[2:49:46.940 --> 2:49:49.940]  The WHO stated last year, the WHO said,
[2:49:49.940 --> 2:49:52.940]  vaccine hesitancy is the greatest threat to health,
[2:49:52.940 --> 2:49:54.940]  to their idea of pharmaceutical health.
[2:49:54.940 --> 2:49:57.940]  And so the agenda has been we need a mandated vaccine program
[2:49:57.940 --> 2:49:58.940]  for every human on the earth.
[2:49:58.940 --> 2:50:01.940]  So Fauci, everybody doesn't matter how many mistakes they make,
[2:50:01.940 --> 2:50:03.940]  they keep waking up in the morning and saying,
[2:50:03.940 --> 2:50:05.940]  I don't care how bad we look. I don't care what's going on.
[2:50:05.940 --> 2:50:09.940]  My goal on this planet is to get a forced vaccination program
[2:50:09.940 --> 2:50:11.940]  for everyone alive and I'm sticking with that.
[2:50:11.940 --> 2:50:13.940]  We'll change, we'll change our story.
[2:50:13.940 --> 2:50:15.940]  We'll change our headline. We'll move the goalpost.
[2:50:15.940 --> 2:50:17.940]  It doesn't matter in the end.
[2:50:17.940 --> 2:50:21.940]  You hit the key last segment. They are so desperate
[2:50:21.940 --> 2:50:23.940]  because they know the world's waking up to them
[2:50:23.940 --> 2:50:26.940]  and that December 2nd, December 3rd meeting
[2:50:26.940 --> 2:50:30.940]  at the WHO in Switzerland with the head scientist saying,
[2:50:30.940 --> 2:50:33.940]  our doctors are wobbly. They know it's hurting people.
[2:50:33.940 --> 2:50:35.940]  We don't test vaccines. There's a coverup.
[2:50:35.940 --> 2:50:37.940]  And they're all not knowing what to do.
[2:50:37.940 --> 2:50:40.940]  And boom, this happened that totally covers all that up.
[2:50:40.940 --> 2:50:43.940]  It covers it all up, but it's actually exposed them, right?
[2:50:43.940 --> 2:50:44.940]  It's the greatest mistake they've ever made.
[2:50:44.940 --> 2:50:47.940]  Their entire argument is that we're a scientific consensus.
[2:50:47.940 --> 2:50:49.940]  They no longer have a consensus.
[2:50:49.940 --> 2:50:52.940]  They destroy their own consensus by so overreaching,
[2:50:52.940 --> 2:50:55.940]  so overstepping, making everybody destroy economies
[2:50:55.940 --> 2:50:57.940]  while we wait 18 months for the vaccine.
[2:50:57.940 --> 2:51:01.940]  I already said this 50 times, but Cedar Sinai can't be trusted
[2:51:01.940 --> 2:51:05.940]  and major clinic owners can't be trusted because, oh, they're bad too.
[2:51:05.940 --> 2:51:09.940]  I believe them banning these doctors and banning Cedar Sinai is,
[2:51:09.940 --> 2:51:13.940]  I believe the dominoes, that domino is going to take them down.
[2:51:13.940 --> 2:51:15.940]  And that's where we're going. People are waking up because of oppression.
[2:51:15.940 --> 2:51:18.940]  You oppress people with blood pumping through their brains
[2:51:18.940 --> 2:51:20.940]  that still have a few brain cells working,
[2:51:20.940 --> 2:51:23.940]  then you are going to see a reaction, and that is the reaction we're seeing.
[2:51:23.940 --> 2:51:26.940]  We're seeing gigantic turnouts at these rallies all over the country, right?
[2:51:26.940 --> 2:51:28.940]  No, no, I agree. So what we're seeing is desperation.
[2:51:28.940 --> 2:51:31.940]  Desperation, but also that's where it starts, right?
[2:51:31.940 --> 2:51:34.940]  They're desperate, but we are desperate to wake up.
[2:51:34.940 --> 2:51:36.940]  They've been desperately trying to get people to wake up.
[2:51:36.940 --> 2:51:38.940]  So now they're helping us do our job, aren't they?
[2:51:38.940 --> 2:51:40.940]  Exactly. So on their end, it's a mixture of arrogance and desperation.
[2:51:40.940 --> 2:51:43.940]  I think it's arrogance. It's hubris. It's everything that makes, you know,
[2:51:43.940 --> 2:51:46.940]  my body used to always say pride goes before fall.
[2:51:46.940 --> 2:51:51.940]  The pride and the hubris and the ego in this medical establishment
[2:51:51.940 --> 2:51:52.940]  is going to be their own demise.
[2:51:52.940 --> 2:51:53.940]  No, I totally agree with you, but I'll tell you.
[2:51:53.940 --> 2:51:54.940]  And that's how we bring it down.
[2:51:54.940 --> 2:51:57.940]  I've been tracking Bill Gates for like 30 years.
[2:51:57.940 --> 2:52:00.940]  I've been on there 26, but he's always a key intel guy
[2:52:00.940 --> 2:52:01.940]  involved in globalism.
[2:52:01.940 --> 2:52:03.940]  He's always followed Gates and the foundations behind him.
[2:52:03.940 --> 2:52:05.940]  He normally looks like he's in heaven.
[2:52:05.940 --> 2:52:07.940]  He looks like he's dying during these interviews.
[2:52:07.940 --> 2:52:10.940]  He does not look here because he knows people are waking up.
[2:52:10.940 --> 2:52:13.940]  So I just look off his body language and off of founties.
[2:52:13.940 --> 2:52:14.940]  They don't look very happy.
[2:52:14.940 --> 2:52:18.940]  Well, I mean, look, people hate Bill Gates everywhere he goes.
[2:52:18.940 --> 2:52:20.940]  He's obviously bought himself television spots on Ellen
[2:52:20.940 --> 2:52:22.940]  on every single show there is.
[2:52:22.940 --> 2:52:24.940]  Oh, by the way, I used to look it up.
[2:52:24.940 --> 2:52:26.940]  He funded shows like a good doctor attacking me.
[2:52:26.940 --> 2:52:28.940]  I looked it up. He funded that show.
[2:52:28.940 --> 2:52:30.940]  You're right. Good morning, America.
[2:52:30.940 --> 2:52:33.940]  This week, ABC, you look it up.
[2:52:33.940 --> 2:52:36.940]  He underwrites and pays for the shows where they say he's a hero.
[2:52:36.940 --> 2:52:38.940]  Right. And he's paid to go out there.
[2:52:38.940 --> 2:52:41.940]  He went and spent the last two weeks trying to make himself a hero.
[2:52:41.940 --> 2:52:43.940]  And all he did was get beat up on Facebook.
[2:52:43.940 --> 2:52:46.940]  They had to take the shows down for the first time in history saying,
[2:52:46.940 --> 2:52:47.940]  people hate this guy.
[2:52:47.940 --> 2:52:50.940]  So now he's doing interviews and he's realizing, so I'm hated.
[2:52:50.940 --> 2:52:52.940]  So you're proud of humanity's organic response?
[2:52:52.940 --> 2:52:54.940]  I am. I believe in humanity.
[2:52:54.940 --> 2:52:55.940]  That's why I'm here.
[2:52:55.940 --> 2:52:57.940]  Yeah.
[2:52:57.940 --> 2:53:00.940]  So as bad as it is, as bad as it is for those of us in the spirit,
[2:53:00.940 --> 2:53:03.940]  because you're not a wimp, you're a tough guy.
[2:53:03.940 --> 2:53:05.940]  You've been persecuted for making this movie.
[2:53:05.940 --> 2:53:06.940]  You've given up a lot.
[2:53:06.940 --> 2:53:07.940]  Yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[2:53:07.940 --> 2:53:09.940]  I've been called a baby killer and everything else.
[2:53:09.940 --> 2:53:11.940]  There's no way I could probably ever work in television again
[2:53:11.940 --> 2:53:13.940]  under the current circumstances.
[2:53:13.940 --> 2:53:14.940]  I don't care.
[2:53:14.940 --> 2:53:16.940]  But those are the types of things they do.
[2:53:16.940 --> 2:53:17.940]  They take the words out of contact.
[2:53:17.940 --> 2:53:19.940]  I love science when it works.
[2:53:19.940 --> 2:53:22.940]  If they had some vaccine, maybe I'd take it like pumpkin pie, but it doesn't.
[2:53:22.940 --> 2:53:24.940]  Well, that's all I've been saying from the beginning, right?
[2:53:24.940 --> 2:53:25.940]  Prove to me it's safe.
[2:53:25.940 --> 2:53:28.940]  Use a placebo group. They're already admitting we're going to do like 45 people
[2:53:28.940 --> 2:53:29.940]  in one of these trials.
[2:53:29.940 --> 2:53:30.940]  There's no placebo group.
[2:53:30.940 --> 2:53:31.940]  No one's getting their placebo.
[2:53:31.940 --> 2:53:33.940]  So there's no way to establish safety.
[2:53:33.940 --> 2:53:35.940]  Let's talk about Robert Kennedy Jr.
[2:53:35.940 --> 2:53:38.940]  He came out a few days ago and said the WHO are basically murderers.
[2:53:38.940 --> 2:53:39.940]  The vaccines are deadly.
[2:53:39.940 --> 2:53:40.940]  I loved it.
[2:53:40.940 --> 2:53:41.940]  I want to believe he's real.
[2:53:41.940 --> 2:53:44.940]  I've seen a weird kind of synthetic grassroots campaign against him.
[2:53:44.940 --> 2:53:45.940]  I know you know him.
[2:53:45.940 --> 2:53:46.940]  You've talked to him.
[2:53:46.940 --> 2:53:48.940]  I've been intrigued by the fruits.
[2:53:48.940 --> 2:53:49.940]  I think he's doing a good job.
[2:53:49.940 --> 2:53:52.940]  I would say that I would trust Bobby Kennedy with my life.
[2:53:52.940 --> 2:53:53.940]  There's been moments.
[2:53:53.940 --> 2:53:54.940]  We don't always agree.
[2:53:54.940 --> 2:53:55.940]  There's been moments.
[2:53:55.940 --> 2:53:56.940]  We work with each other a lot.
[2:53:56.940 --> 2:53:58.940]  But I've watched that guy stand on the front lines.
[2:53:58.940 --> 2:53:59.940]  I've watched him roll up his sleeves.
[2:53:59.940 --> 2:54:01.940]  I've watched him stand with the people.
[2:54:01.940 --> 2:54:03.940]  I've watched him carry children in his own arms.
[2:54:03.940 --> 2:54:05.940]  And he's been doing that his entire career.
[2:54:05.940 --> 2:54:06.940]  That guy is legitimate.
[2:54:06.940 --> 2:54:10.940]  But I mean, when he called for the WHO to be arrested, I mean, that's not fake.
[2:54:10.940 --> 2:54:11.940]  No, that's not fake.
[2:54:11.940 --> 2:54:13.940]  And it's not something you would normally expect a Kennedy to do.
[2:54:13.940 --> 2:54:16.940]  You got to remember, this guy is born into one of the greatest, you know,
[2:54:16.940 --> 2:54:18.940]  biggest iconic brand names there is.
[2:54:18.940 --> 2:54:21.940]  Everything you do with that name, his family is screaming and yelling at him.
[2:54:21.940 --> 2:54:24.940]  I'm sophisticated enough to know there are all these weird channels.
[2:54:24.940 --> 2:54:27.940]  Hey, you better go after Bobby Kennedy or you're not a patriot.
[2:54:27.940 --> 2:54:28.940]  Bobby Kennedy is a bad guy.
[2:54:28.940 --> 2:54:30.940]  That's when I finally went, oh, he must be a good guy.
[2:54:30.940 --> 2:54:31.940]  Right, exactly.
[2:54:31.940 --> 2:54:32.940]  And then that's what I do too.
[2:54:32.940 --> 2:54:35.940]  When you look at who's attacking them and for what reasons,
[2:54:35.940 --> 2:54:39.940]  this is a man that's been trying to make sure that we have a healthier environment
[2:54:39.940 --> 2:54:41.940]  that we're not being poisoned by corporations.
[2:54:41.940 --> 2:54:46.940]  When he says the WHO and Bill Gates' vaccines kill more children than die of the disease,
[2:54:46.940 --> 2:54:47.940]  it's true.
[2:54:47.940 --> 2:54:49.940]  That's an incredibly heroic statement.
[2:54:49.940 --> 2:54:51.940]  And that's not fake right there.
[2:54:51.940 --> 2:54:54.940]  And by the way, who working for the other side would never make that statement, right?
[2:54:54.940 --> 2:54:57.940]  Who would go up there and get hundreds of thousands,
[2:54:57.940 --> 2:55:01.940]  not millions of people around the world to agree with a point that vaccines are dangerous?
[2:55:01.940 --> 2:55:02.940]  Well, listen, I go, oh my God.
[2:55:02.940 --> 2:55:03.940]  How is that a bad guy?
[2:55:03.940 --> 2:55:05.940]  So I look at him and when he talks about it, I can see he's real.
[2:55:05.940 --> 2:55:06.940]  I already know he's real.
[2:55:06.940 --> 2:55:07.940]  Yeah.
[2:55:07.940 --> 2:55:08.940]  I'm just saying, but there's a grassroots.
[2:55:08.940 --> 2:55:09.940]  There is.
[2:55:09.940 --> 2:55:12.940]  Astro-Turf attack on him because they're really pissed at him right now.
[2:55:12.940 --> 2:55:15.940]  Every movement in the world throughout time has always had in-fighting
[2:55:15.940 --> 2:55:17.940]  and everyone thinks they have the best way to go forward.
[2:55:17.940 --> 2:55:19.940]  And look, no one's perfect.
[2:55:19.940 --> 2:55:20.940]  We all make mistakes.
[2:55:20.940 --> 2:55:21.940]  We're all doing the best we can.
[2:55:21.940 --> 2:55:22.940]  What I say is stay in lane.
[2:55:22.940 --> 2:55:23.940]  Do what you think you're supposed to do.
[2:55:23.940 --> 2:55:28.940]  All I'm saying about him is coming out and saying vaccines are killing more than they're
[2:55:28.940 --> 2:55:30.940]  helping, but I'm going to show that.
[2:55:30.940 --> 2:55:34.940]  You can't put a statement out like that and have that be for the bad guys.
[2:55:34.940 --> 2:55:35.940]  They would never say that.
[2:55:35.940 --> 2:55:39.940]  He's described the pharmaceutical industry as a cartel that murders people.
[2:55:39.940 --> 2:55:42.940]  He talks about the fact that the three biggest, you know,
[2:55:42.940 --> 2:55:46.940]  vaccine makers have paid out billions and billions of dollars for murdering innocent
[2:55:46.940 --> 2:55:47.940]  people.
[2:55:47.940 --> 2:55:48.940]  There's no doubt.
[2:55:48.940 --> 2:55:49.940]  My gut knew it when I was seeing this.
[2:55:49.940 --> 2:55:50.940]  Yeah, he is a good guy.
[2:55:50.940 --> 2:55:53.940]  We're going to do a few more segments and I really appreciate you being here.
[2:55:53.940 --> 2:55:54.940]  I've been asking the questions.
[2:55:54.940 --> 2:55:56.940]  What do you want to get to next when we come back?
[2:55:56.940 --> 2:55:57.940]  What I want to get to.
[2:55:57.940 --> 2:56:00.940]  I want to get to how we march forward and we bring home the win.
[2:56:00.940 --> 2:56:01.940]  That's what we got to do.
[2:56:01.940 --> 2:56:03.940]  Well, I know the president watches the show.
[2:56:03.940 --> 2:56:05.940]  He gets clips, but he likes like five-minute clips.
[2:56:05.940 --> 2:56:09.940]  So we just kind of did this, but you want to go to break and say,
[2:56:09.940 --> 2:56:10.940]  Mr. President, here's how you win.
[2:56:10.940 --> 2:56:12.940]  You want to, there's a good chance I'll watch it.
[2:56:12.940 --> 2:56:13.940]  Right now?
[2:56:13.940 --> 2:56:15.940]  We're going to break it about a minute and a half.
[2:56:15.940 --> 2:56:16.940]  Okay.
[2:56:16.940 --> 2:56:17.940]  Do you want to come back and send him a message?
[2:56:17.940 --> 2:56:18.940]  I'm down to send him a message.
[2:56:18.940 --> 2:56:20.940]  Trump likes it when it's a message to him.
[2:56:20.940 --> 2:56:21.940]  Okay.
[2:56:21.940 --> 2:56:23.940]  He's not an arrogance thing, but he kind of likes it like being addressed.
[2:56:23.940 --> 2:56:24.940]  Right.
[2:56:24.940 --> 2:56:25.940]  I'm down.
[2:56:25.940 --> 2:56:26.940]  He has an obsession with it.
[2:56:26.940 --> 2:56:30.940]  Well, you know, he sends a secret service out with buckets, like boxes to get all the
[2:56:30.940 --> 2:56:31.940]  stuff people hand them.
[2:56:31.940 --> 2:56:33.940]  And when he's on Air Force One, he reads it all up.
[2:56:33.940 --> 2:56:34.940]  That's incredible.
[2:56:34.940 --> 2:56:35.940]  It's incredible.
[2:56:35.940 --> 2:56:40.440]  And to what, you know, look, his tweet, the fact that he's tweets, the way he interacts,
[2:56:40.440 --> 2:56:43.440]  we've never had a president that is so transparent with the public.
[2:56:43.440 --> 2:56:45.940]  I mean, you got to say, you know what the guy's thinking, right?
[2:56:45.940 --> 2:56:47.940]  Whether you like it, people say, oh, I wish he stopped tweeting.
[2:56:47.940 --> 2:56:51.440]  I think that every president after Donald Trump should have to tweet just as much as
[2:56:51.440 --> 2:56:52.440]  he does.
[2:56:52.440 --> 2:56:53.440]  Oh, they don't like it.
[2:56:53.440 --> 2:56:54.940]  I think he should have to tweet at three o'clock in the morning like he does.
[2:56:54.940 --> 2:56:55.940]  I don't know.
[2:56:55.940 --> 2:56:56.940]  The maker of Vax.
[2:56:56.940 --> 2:56:58.440]  Where do folks find Vax right now?
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:56:59.440]  All right.
[2:56:59.440 --> 2:57:00.440]  Now you got to go to VaxTheMovie.com.
[2:57:00.440 --> 2:57:04.440]  It's been kicked off of Amazon, off of Netflix, everywhere else is being censored.
[2:57:04.440 --> 2:57:07.440]  But if you go to the website, Vax, that's two Xs.
[2:57:07.440 --> 2:57:09.940]  VaxTheMovie.com, you can get it there.
[2:57:09.940 --> 2:57:10.940]  That's the biggest thing.
[2:57:10.940 --> 2:57:13.940]  The most important thing, folks, is you already know all this.
[2:57:13.940 --> 2:57:15.440]  You've got to share it.
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:16.440]  You've got to have block parties.
[2:57:16.440 --> 2:57:20.440]  You've got to celebrate what's censored, which now is the spirit of the time.
[2:57:20.440 --> 2:57:23.440]  And don't forget, we've got X2 back in stock.
[2:57:23.440 --> 2:57:24.940]  Great iodine for your body.
[2:57:24.940 --> 2:57:27.440]  And we've got swarble foods that everybody should have back in stock.
[2:57:27.440 --> 2:57:28.440]  M4store.com.
[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:29.940]  That's how we fund our operation.
[2:57:29.940 --> 2:57:30.940]  Without you, we're not here.
[2:57:30.940 --> 2:57:33.440]  Believe me, have you had any idea?
[2:57:33.440 --> 2:57:37.440]  I'm actually proud of the Attacks Runner, but it is biblical right now.
[2:57:37.440 --> 2:57:41.440]  They are measuring my jail cell right now.
[2:58:08.440 --> 2:58:10.440]  I've been our teachers.
[2:58:10.440 --> 2:58:13.440]  And Big Tech has been our controllers.
[2:58:13.440 --> 2:58:15.440]  We're all being introduced now.
[2:58:15.440 --> 2:58:19.440]  The digital straight jacket that depends on us complying with it,
[2:58:19.440 --> 2:58:24.440]  and depends on us all pinpecking each other into submission.
[2:58:24.440 --> 2:58:27.440]  But for all of you out there that have decided to go along with this,
[2:58:27.440 --> 2:58:29.440]  mark your calendars down.
[2:58:29.440 --> 2:58:32.440]  And then in a few months, a few years, look at the world.
[2:58:32.440 --> 2:58:34.440]  Remember, you did this.
[2:58:34.440 --> 2:58:37.440]  You were the prisoners, you were the slaves, you were the people
[2:58:37.440 --> 2:58:40.440]  that crouched down and licked the hand that fed you.
[2:58:40.440 --> 2:59:05.440]  That's for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[2:59:10.440 --> 2:59:16.440]  Well, and Fauci, who transferred the bio weapons to communist China
[2:59:16.440 --> 2:59:19.440]  so we could now release the weapon.
[2:59:19.440 --> 2:59:24.440]  But without the loving liberal media, scaring you in submission,
[2:59:24.440 --> 2:59:30.440]  and the corporate press, worshiping corporations that shut down all access,
[2:59:30.440 --> 2:59:33.440]  as well as blue city governors and leaders,
[2:59:33.440 --> 2:59:37.440]  we would never have been able to give you the depression
[2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:41.440]  for heaven and starve the third world.
[2:59:41.440 --> 3:00:09.440]  Well done, American Cowards.
[3:00:09.440 --> 3:00:16.440]  But nobody seems to notice.
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:24.440]  But the fool on the hill sees it all.
[3:00:24.440 --> 3:00:26.440]  All right, your message,
[3:00:26.440 --> 3:00:30.440]  Dell Bigtree of thehighwire.com producer of the censored film
[3:00:30.440 --> 3:00:33.440]  of the sensory vax.
[3:00:33.440 --> 3:00:37.440]  What is your message to President Trump in the world about taking action?
[3:00:37.440 --> 3:00:42.440]  Mr. President, first of all, you were handed a bomb deal with this COVID-19.
[3:00:42.440 --> 3:00:45.440]  You're surrounded by people that are getting it wrong
[3:00:45.440 --> 3:00:47.440]  and you're getting a lot of bad information.
[3:00:47.440 --> 3:00:52.440]  Yet through that, you seem to be making the best decisions anyone could expect.
[3:00:52.440 --> 3:00:56.440]  You have supported the medical industry by funding the vaccine.
[3:00:56.440 --> 3:00:57.440]  You've looked at Chloroquine.
[3:00:57.440 --> 3:00:59.440]  There needs to be more trials on treatment.
[3:00:59.440 --> 3:01:02.440]  A treatment can end this long before a vaccine ever does.
[3:01:02.440 --> 3:01:04.440]  But there's one area that I think you really need to look at.
[3:01:04.440 --> 3:01:07.440]  First of all, you have the body of sciences actually on your side.
[3:01:07.440 --> 3:01:11.440]  When you look at the top virologists and epidemiologists
[3:01:11.440 --> 3:01:14.440]  and people around the world like that, they're on your side.
[3:01:14.440 --> 3:01:16.440]  You need to get some more of them on your team.
[3:01:16.440 --> 3:01:18.440]  If you want help with that, I'll point you in the right direction.
[3:01:18.440 --> 3:01:22.440]  Also, we have one section we really haven't looked at,
[3:01:22.440 --> 3:01:25.440]  which is we've got to start looking at natural herd immunity.
[3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:27.440]  It can be achieved in a safe way.
[3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:31.440]  So while we're putting out trillion-dollar packages to try and support people,
[3:01:31.440 --> 3:01:36.440]  can we go to the nursing homes and the places where we need to be able to lock down our elderly
[3:01:36.440 --> 3:01:38.440]  and make them airtight?
[3:01:38.440 --> 3:01:41.440]  We need to fund things so that the doctors and nurses inside those facilities
[3:01:41.440 --> 3:01:46.440]  can stay inside those facilities so we don't go in and out the next time a coronavirus comes along.
[3:01:46.440 --> 3:01:48.440]  Let's be able to lock down those that are at risk.
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:50.440]  We're talking 0.1, 0.3.
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:53.440]  At the very tops, 1% are going to have a severe reaction.
[3:01:53.440 --> 3:01:57.440]  For the 90% of us that are just going to be asymptomatic or have a common cold,
[3:01:57.440 --> 3:02:03.440]  let us soldier up, go out there, get their herd immunity while we protect those that are in harm's way
[3:02:03.440 --> 3:02:08.440]  so that you can go on, have a real election, that people can get back to America,
[3:02:08.440 --> 3:02:14.440]  get back their jobs, and feel good about this nation and our dream.
[3:02:14.440 --> 3:02:20.440]  We cannot let the dream of our founding fathers die, oppression, suppression, surveillance,
[3:02:20.440 --> 3:02:22.440]  testing, forced vaccinations.
[3:02:22.440 --> 3:02:25.440]  That is not America, and that is not human.
[3:02:25.440 --> 3:02:27.440]  I know you know that.
[3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:29.440]  We're here. We support you.
[3:02:29.440 --> 3:02:31.440]  We know you're doing the best you can do.
[3:02:31.440 --> 3:02:35.440]  You've got to surround yourself with some more people that are able to discuss the truth
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:38.440]  and talk science to the people.
[3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:42.440]  The real science, not failed models, real data because it's available.
[3:02:42.440 --> 3:02:46.440]  When Deborah Birx right now, by the way, keeps saying we don't have the data, we don't have the data,
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:48.440]  we've been at this for six months.
[3:02:48.440 --> 3:02:51.440]  There are millions of people around the world that have now gotten involved with the coronavirus.
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:53.440]  We do have the data.
[3:02:53.440 --> 3:02:57.440]  We're not looking at the data, and I'm tired of hearing scientists that don't know how to collect data.
[3:02:57.440 --> 3:02:59.440]  The data is there. The truth is there.
[3:02:59.440 --> 3:03:06.440]  Let's move forward because the truth is this just isn't deadly enough to destroy the greatest economy in the world.
[3:03:06.440 --> 3:03:08.440]  And it's going to starve.
[3:03:08.440 --> 3:03:11.440]  They're now seeing tens of millions of people confirmed already starving to death.
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:13.440]  It was like 33 million last week.
[3:03:13.440 --> 3:03:16.440]  Now the U.N. says 130 million are on the verge of starvation.
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:19.440]  Those are real people, and this is irrevocable.
[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:21.440]  The damage it's already become.
[3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:24.440]  What's Fauci going to do? What's Bill Mullen and the Gates going to do?
[3:03:24.440 --> 3:03:28.440]  When we're in a global depression a month from now, six months from now,
[3:03:28.440 --> 3:03:31.440]  they think we'll just forget that they instituted this.
[3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:34.440]  I'm amazed. I mean, it's like they think there's like a fairy godmother.
[3:03:34.440 --> 3:03:36.440]  A daddy is going to fix this.
[3:03:36.440 --> 3:03:38.440]  So I'm going to come out. I really don't think they get.
[3:03:38.440 --> 3:03:41.440]  Your job is going to be gone. This world is going to be obliterated.
[3:03:41.440 --> 3:03:45.440]  You know what? It's like a car has gone off the bridge and it's sinking to the bottom of the ocean.
[3:03:45.440 --> 3:03:48.440]  And Tony Fauci is saying, we've got oxygen, we've got to stay locked in.
[3:03:48.440 --> 3:03:51.440]  And you're like, no, the deeper we go, the harder it's going to be to get back and survive.
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:53.440]  That's the best analogy.
[3:03:53.440 --> 3:03:57.440]  The car is in the thing, it's in the water, and it's flooding.
[3:03:57.440 --> 3:03:58.440]  It's flooding.
[3:03:58.440 --> 3:04:00.440]  And they're like, oh, stay here. We've got oxygen.
[3:04:00.440 --> 3:04:01.440]  No, we've got to get out.
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:03.440]  We've got to get out. We've got to get out now.
[3:04:03.440 --> 3:04:05.440]  Every single second, we were going to have more people die.
[3:04:05.440 --> 3:04:08.440]  We were in more danger. We've got to get out. We've got to take the risk.
[3:04:08.440 --> 3:04:11.440]  We cannot be afraid of the water coming in. It's upon us.
[3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:13.440]  We've got to get to the surface. We've got to save this economy.
[3:04:13.440 --> 3:04:16.440]  If it was killing 2%, I'd be locked up my house.
[3:04:16.440 --> 3:04:19.440]  It doesn't even kill 1 tenth of 1%.
[3:04:19.440 --> 3:04:20.440]  Right.
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:22.440]  And then there's censoring doctors that expose admitted numbers,
[3:04:22.440 --> 3:04:26.440]  which shows they're behind it. They love it. It's disgusting.
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:30.440]  It really is. It's horrifying because people are being killed.
[3:04:30.440 --> 3:04:33.440]  I believe they're being murdered now by bad medicine, bad science.
[3:04:33.440 --> 3:04:36.440]  I mean, how did a virus end up having a political leaning?
[3:04:36.440 --> 3:04:39.440]  Why do you have Democrats in states, you know, Democratic states,
[3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:42.440]  not using hydroxychloroquine when you've got DDRI in France saying,
[3:04:42.440 --> 3:04:43.440]  oh, you're right.
[3:04:43.440 --> 3:04:46.440]  The red stittings are doing it. They are.
[3:04:46.440 --> 3:04:50.440]  Bull stittings won't do it. They're sacrificing people to up the number.
[3:04:50.440 --> 3:04:51.440]  They've been caught red-handed.
[3:04:51.440 --> 3:05:20.440]  It is.
[3:05:21.440 --> 3:05:49.440]  It is.
[3:05:49.440 --> 3:05:51.440]  It's a big winner.
[3:06:19.440 --> 3:06:23.440]  Public Health Officer of Canada appeared in a documentary to advocate
[3:06:23.440 --> 3:06:27.440]  cracking bracelets for vaccine-refuse nicks.
[3:06:27.440 --> 3:06:29.440]  This is their control system.
[3:06:29.440 --> 3:06:33.440]  The majority of Canadians think coronavirus vaccines should be mandatory.
[3:06:33.440 --> 3:06:34.440]  This is what they're doing.
[3:06:34.440 --> 3:06:36.440]  Gelt big trees here with us.
[3:06:36.440 --> 3:06:41.440]  The producer of Vax and you just laid out where we're at,
[3:06:41.440 --> 3:06:44.440]  but jumping the shark gets overused.
[3:06:44.440 --> 3:06:48.440]  But banning anybody on Facebook, Twitter or YouTube
[3:06:48.440 --> 3:06:51.440]  that says they're going to go out and protest being locked in their house.
[3:06:51.440 --> 3:06:53.440]  That's incredibly over the top.
[3:06:53.440 --> 3:06:58.440]  But now, Cedar Sinai, medical doctors coming out saying Trump's right.
[3:06:58.440 --> 3:07:00.440]  Reading statistics on air being banned.
[3:07:00.440 --> 3:07:01.440]  This is big.
[3:07:01.440 --> 3:07:02.440]  It's really big.
[3:07:02.440 --> 3:07:05.440]  And I think that a lot of people are waking up.
[3:07:05.440 --> 3:07:09.440]  I mean, it's unfortunate it takes a tragedy like this for people to really come together
[3:07:09.440 --> 3:07:11.440]  and recognize we have an issue.
[3:07:11.440 --> 3:07:12.440]  We now stand together.
[3:07:12.440 --> 3:07:14.440]  Many different groups are now collecting, right?
[3:07:14.440 --> 3:07:17.440]  You have constitutionalists joining people that are anti-vax.
[3:07:17.440 --> 3:07:19.440]  Liberals, conservatives.
[3:07:19.440 --> 3:07:20.440]  It's over.
[3:07:20.440 --> 3:07:21.440]  It's over.
[3:07:21.440 --> 3:07:22.440]  It's over.
[3:07:22.440 --> 3:07:23.440]  And how do they hold up?
[3:07:23.440 --> 3:07:24.440]  I'll just say that.
[3:07:24.440 --> 3:07:25.440]  Even my wife sees it all.
[3:07:25.440 --> 3:07:27.440]  She goes, everyone I know says this is BS.
[3:07:27.440 --> 3:07:28.440]  Like almost everyone.
[3:07:28.440 --> 3:07:29.440]  Yeah.
[3:07:29.440 --> 3:07:31.440]  And I think about myself because I mean, I've been in TV.
[3:07:31.440 --> 3:07:37.440]  I think you imagine if I was hired to do PR for Deborah Berks and Tony Fauci and Bill Gates.
[3:07:37.440 --> 3:07:38.440]  Impossible.
[3:07:38.440 --> 3:07:39.440]  It'd be impossible.
[3:07:39.440 --> 3:07:40.440]  That job is impossible.
[3:07:40.440 --> 3:07:42.440]  There's no way to put lipstick on this big.
[3:07:42.440 --> 3:07:43.440]  You cannot do it.
[3:07:43.440 --> 3:07:45.440]  It's a complete and total disaster.
[3:07:45.440 --> 3:07:47.440]  Not a single model has added up.
[3:07:47.440 --> 3:07:50.440]  Every decent scientist around the world is saying we should have never locked down.
[3:07:50.440 --> 3:07:56.440]  And they're also telling us, be careful when they try to tell you it was the lockdown that kept the death rate low.
[3:07:56.440 --> 3:07:59.440]  The death rate is low in Sweden and they now have herd immunity.
[3:07:59.440 --> 3:08:00.440]  We've got to move forward.
[3:08:00.440 --> 3:08:02.440]  I think we have to forgive each other, right?
[3:08:02.440 --> 3:08:04.440]  I think we all have to say, you know what?
[3:08:04.440 --> 3:08:05.440]  We're in this together.
[3:08:05.440 --> 3:08:06.440]  We've got to all come out together.
[3:08:06.440 --> 3:08:09.440]  What happened to the quarantine stays in the quarantine.
[3:08:09.440 --> 3:08:10.440]  I get it.
[3:08:10.440 --> 3:08:11.440]  You took pictures of me out with my dog.
[3:08:11.440 --> 3:08:12.440]  You got me without the mask.
[3:08:12.440 --> 3:08:13.440]  You were freaked out.
[3:08:13.440 --> 3:08:14.440]  The news told you to do it.
[3:08:14.440 --> 3:08:15.440]  I'm going to forgive you.
[3:08:15.440 --> 3:08:19.440]  We need to move forward and say, this is still the United States of America.
[3:08:19.440 --> 3:08:20.440]  We're in this together.
[3:08:20.440 --> 3:08:22.440]  We want this to be the greatest nation once again.
[3:08:22.440 --> 3:08:25.440]  So let's forgive all the accidents and mistakes that happened.
[3:08:25.440 --> 3:08:27.440]  We'll let the blame go to somebody else.
[3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:28.440]  But let's move forward.
[3:08:28.440 --> 3:08:30.440]  Because we're in cardiac arrest.
[3:08:30.440 --> 3:08:31.440]  We are.
[3:08:31.440 --> 3:08:32.440]  We are.
[3:08:32.440 --> 3:08:33.440]  We're suffering.
[3:08:33.440 --> 3:08:35.440]  We're in a tragic, you know, we're in a situation where we're not communicating.
[3:08:35.440 --> 3:08:38.440]  We're not able to speak, you know, clearly in the ramming of ventilator down our throat.
[3:08:38.440 --> 3:08:41.440]  We're going to die if we let that ventilator go down our throat.
[3:08:41.440 --> 3:08:43.440]  We've got to remember, hold on a second.
[3:08:43.440 --> 3:08:45.440]  Let me take a brief, deep breath.
[3:08:45.440 --> 3:08:47.440]  Let me calm down and see what's going.
[3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:49.440]  But you come in, you test positive.
[3:08:49.440 --> 3:08:53.440]  They snake it down your throat when it's an autoimmune response like the Spanish flu.
[3:08:53.440 --> 3:08:54.440]  Right.
[3:08:54.440 --> 3:08:58.440]  And who pre-programmed that we're going to run a ventilator down knowing that kills
[3:08:58.440 --> 3:09:00.440]  you and all you need is a penetrator.
[3:09:00.440 --> 3:09:01.440]  And what's right?
[3:09:01.440 --> 3:09:02.440]  It's like a bee sting.
[3:09:02.440 --> 3:09:03.440]  It really is.
[3:09:03.440 --> 3:09:04.440]  It's crazy.
[3:09:04.440 --> 3:09:05.440]  You know what?
[3:09:05.440 --> 3:09:06.440]  They knew this was SARS.
[3:09:06.440 --> 3:09:07.440]  SARS was the same issue.
[3:09:07.440 --> 3:09:08.440]  SARS was a blood oxygen issue.
[3:09:08.440 --> 3:09:09.440]  They knew that.
[3:09:09.440 --> 3:09:11.440]  They knew that that formed the coronavirus respirators was not.
[3:09:11.440 --> 3:09:12.440]  It wasn't a respiratory issue.
[3:09:12.440 --> 3:09:14.440]  You didn't have blood in your oxygen.
[3:09:14.440 --> 3:09:16.440]  We've got oxygen in your blood.
[3:09:16.440 --> 3:09:17.440]  We need oxygen in the blood.
[3:09:17.440 --> 3:09:18.440]  We've got to figure out how to do that.
[3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:22.440]  So if they knew that, why are they like more ventilators day one because they knew what
[3:09:22.440 --> 3:09:23.440]  they were doing?
[3:09:23.440 --> 3:09:24.440]  Well, those are really good questions.
[3:09:24.440 --> 3:09:26.440]  So those are the types of things that I'm going to investigate.
[3:09:26.440 --> 3:09:29.440]  I haven't really looked into why we got here or who was behind it.
[3:09:29.440 --> 3:09:32.440]  I've just been trying to like, you know, play catch up, look at the data.
[3:09:32.440 --> 3:09:34.440]  We've been showing data from around the world from the databases.
[3:09:34.440 --> 3:09:36.440]  It looks really, really bad.
[3:09:36.440 --> 3:09:37.440]  It looks so sinister.
[3:09:37.440 --> 3:09:41.440]  If you read a science fiction book like this, you'd say no one would try that.
[3:09:41.440 --> 3:09:42.440]  Well, I mean, and that's the question, right?
[3:09:42.440 --> 3:09:46.440]  I asked myself when we say that, you know, you have, you know, a prime minister in Canada
[3:09:46.440 --> 3:09:49.440]  saying, I'm going to make you wear an armband or you have Bill Gates saying, I'm going to
[3:09:49.440 --> 3:09:50.440]  track you.
[3:09:50.440 --> 3:09:51.440]  We're going to give you a microchip.
[3:09:51.440 --> 3:09:56.440]  And I think, did you not rebrave New World or, you know, or 1984 or Fahrenheit 451?
[3:09:56.440 --> 3:09:58.440]  What do these people think about themselves?
[3:09:58.440 --> 3:10:00.440]  They have to have remembered in high school reading that book.
[3:10:00.440 --> 3:10:03.440]  They go, yeah, I always thought that was a, you know, I wanted to be that bad guy.
[3:10:03.440 --> 3:10:04.440]  Or do they think, no, that's not me.
[3:10:04.440 --> 3:10:06.440]  Or do they think that book just didn't get a right?
[3:10:06.440 --> 3:10:08.440]  We really need this type of oppression or to move forward.
[3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:09.440]  I mean, I'm curious.
[3:10:09.440 --> 3:10:14.440]  Like, what do they think of themselves when they're living right into some crazy, awful,
[3:10:14.440 --> 3:10:17.440]  scientific, you know, novel?
[3:10:17.440 --> 3:10:18.440]  So which is it?
[3:10:18.440 --> 3:10:23.440]  The total vaccine dehumanization takeover or they did it so long, they know it's collapsing.
[3:10:23.440 --> 3:10:27.440]  So instead of all going to prison, they just try to like create a global emergency and
[3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:28.440]  force us all onto it.
[3:10:28.440 --> 3:10:32.440]  I think that really at the heart of this is what we've always seen, which is these people
[3:10:32.440 --> 3:10:33.440]  have a God complex.
[3:10:33.440 --> 3:10:35.440]  They think that they can outsmart nature.
[3:10:35.440 --> 3:10:36.440]  They can outsmart God.
[3:10:36.440 --> 3:10:37.440]  They're the ones in charge.
[3:10:37.440 --> 3:10:38.440]  They can do it better.
[3:10:38.440 --> 3:10:41.440]  And that's where we find that level of ego we've been warned about.
[3:10:41.440 --> 3:10:45.440]  And I learned Bill Gates wants to use the vaccine as the proof for the global ID for
[3:10:45.440 --> 3:10:46.440]  digital currency.
[3:10:46.440 --> 3:10:47.440]  Right.
[3:10:47.440 --> 3:10:48.440]  What's about a global currency?
[3:10:48.440 --> 3:10:49.440]  Yeah.
[3:10:49.440 --> 3:10:50.440]  I mean, all of that plays in, right?
[3:10:50.440 --> 3:10:54.440]  He's got his hands in every single technology that revolves around this, whether it's the
[3:10:54.440 --> 3:10:58.440]  testing kits, whether it's the vaccinations, whether, you know, and he's in, he's in all
[3:10:58.440 --> 3:10:59.440]  of the different sizes.
[3:10:59.440 --> 3:11:01.440]  Why would you always obsess on him every time I open up?
[3:11:01.440 --> 3:11:02.440]  It's like him.
[3:11:02.440 --> 3:11:03.440]  It's like you open the door.
[3:11:03.440 --> 3:11:04.440]  Who's the villain on Bill Gates?
[3:11:04.440 --> 3:11:05.440]  Well, check this door.
[3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:06.440]  Oh, it's Bill Gates again.
[3:11:06.440 --> 3:11:07.440]  Right.
[3:11:07.440 --> 3:11:08.440]  Bill Gates has come up with this.
[3:11:08.440 --> 3:11:09.440]  No.
[3:11:09.440 --> 3:11:11.440]  I didn't just predict he's the guy you'd turn on one day with world government.
[3:11:11.440 --> 3:11:13.440]  He just, he's always there.
[3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:14.440]  It's really, really shocking.
[3:11:14.440 --> 3:11:17.440]  And I guess the level of foresight you got to hand it to the guy.
[3:11:17.440 --> 3:11:21.440]  I mean, he invested in every single thing that we are being told around the world.
[3:11:21.440 --> 3:11:22.440]  This is what we need.
[3:11:22.440 --> 3:11:23.440]  We need microchips.
[3:11:23.440 --> 3:11:24.440]  We need vaccines.
[3:11:24.440 --> 3:11:25.440]  We need testing kits.
[3:11:25.440 --> 3:11:26.440]  We need drones.
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:27.440]  We need to be able to track your phone.
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:28.440]  And then you look, holy cow.
[3:11:28.440 --> 3:11:31.440]  Oh, and by the way, while you're stuck in your house, you need to be able to go to school
[3:11:31.440 --> 3:11:32.440]  online.
[3:11:32.440 --> 3:11:34.440]  Oh, we have, you know, we've got everything.
[3:11:34.440 --> 3:11:36.440]  We've got the program that does that.
[3:11:36.440 --> 3:11:41.440]  Every single part of this crazy, sick, twisted little world that he's dreaming about for
[3:11:41.440 --> 3:11:42.440]  our future.
[3:11:42.440 --> 3:11:43.440]  You know why?
[3:11:43.440 --> 3:11:47.840]  IBM funded the Nazis, basically ran it and Thomas Watson had a plan.
[3:11:47.840 --> 3:11:53.560]  He put all his money when he died into it and the woman on the board of it who runs
[3:11:53.560 --> 3:11:58.440]  his world depopulation, it's actually called that, is Bill Gates' mother.
[3:11:58.440 --> 3:12:02.440]  So Bill Gates is just the front for mommy of all this.
[3:12:02.440 --> 3:12:08.440]  He didn't just have to get Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller, all their money.
[3:12:08.440 --> 3:12:10.440]  Is he a new player?
[3:12:10.440 --> 3:12:14.440]  I mean, you obviously, you always hear about Bill Gates.
[3:12:14.440 --> 3:12:16.440]  He's basically the most powerful person on earth.
[3:12:16.440 --> 3:12:17.440]  There's no one above him.
[3:12:17.440 --> 3:12:18.440]  You think he's at the top?
[3:12:18.440 --> 3:12:21.440]  He's the top of the deal because all the money was put into him.
[3:12:21.440 --> 3:12:27.440]  His mother was on the IBM board and IBM had gotten busted up after World War II.
[3:12:27.440 --> 3:12:28.440]  It was in trouble.
[3:12:28.440 --> 3:12:34.440]  It ran like all of it and they had to get around antitrust.
[3:12:34.440 --> 3:12:38.440]  So they gave the operating system to Bill Gates, but that was the only part of it.
[3:12:38.440 --> 3:12:42.440]  His mother was, his dad ran like army secret experiments.
[3:12:42.440 --> 3:12:44.440]  His dad had a planned parenthood.
[3:12:44.440 --> 3:12:46.440]  His dad was at Cold Springs Harbor.
[3:12:46.440 --> 3:12:48.440]  You can save me a lot of time, man.
[3:12:48.440 --> 3:12:50.440]  I'm just going to get some of your resources because this is where I want to look now.
[3:12:50.440 --> 3:12:52.440]  I want to know how we got here.
[3:12:52.440 --> 3:12:59.440]  And so Bill Gates is like the corporate man from childhood pit to run this whole thing.
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:01.440]  He's the man.
[3:13:01.440 --> 3:13:02.440]  Well, he's there.
[3:13:02.440 --> 3:13:03.440]  I mean, a lot of people don't know this.
[3:13:03.440 --> 3:13:05.440]  He's the second biggest funder of the WHO.
[3:13:05.440 --> 3:13:07.440]  Now that Donald Trump's holding back America's money.
[3:13:07.440 --> 3:13:09.440]  He's the number one funder of the WHO.
[3:13:09.440 --> 3:13:12.440]  That is his company over there and he's working with Chinese nationalists,
[3:13:12.440 --> 3:13:13.440]  working foreign nationals.
[3:13:13.440 --> 3:13:16.440]  I think if I was going to say one more thing to Donald Trump,
[3:13:16.440 --> 3:13:17.440]  I think it's time for an investigation.
[3:13:17.440 --> 3:13:21.440]  I think it's a time for investigation and I'm not talking about fraud.
[3:13:21.440 --> 3:13:22.440]  I'm not talking about treason.
[3:13:22.440 --> 3:13:25.440]  If you're working with foreign nationals and you push a hoax,
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:29.440]  you know, and you overstep and say that something is more deadly like a virus
[3:13:29.440 --> 3:13:31.440]  and you destroy our economy.
[3:13:31.440 --> 3:13:34.440]  You destroy the economy of the United States of America based on a lie
[3:13:34.440 --> 3:13:36.440]  and you work with foreign scientists and nationals.
[3:13:36.440 --> 3:13:38.440]  They're saying things from Ireland like the guy,
[3:13:38.440 --> 3:13:39.440]  the Irish guy I think he is saying,
[3:13:39.440 --> 3:13:40.440]  I'm going to come into your house.
[3:13:40.440 --> 3:13:41.440]  I want to take your children.
[3:13:41.440 --> 3:13:44.440]  And we find out that Bill Gates is the one funding all of that.
[3:13:44.440 --> 3:13:45.440]  I don't see how that's not treason.
[3:13:45.440 --> 3:13:48.440]  Am I missing something?
[3:13:48.440 --> 3:13:51.440]  No, I totally agree with you and that's what I'm saying is.
[3:13:51.440 --> 3:13:52.440]  Are you afraid of what I just said?
[3:13:52.440 --> 3:13:53.440]  You're like holy cow.
[3:13:53.440 --> 3:13:54.440]  That's it.
[3:13:54.440 --> 3:13:55.440]  No, I agree.
[3:13:55.440 --> 3:13:56.440]  Bill Gates should be criminally investigated.
[3:13:56.440 --> 3:13:59.440]  No, I was pausing because it's so true, Mr. Big Tree,
[3:13:59.440 --> 3:14:02.440]  is that I never tried to make Bill Gates the villain.
[3:14:02.440 --> 3:14:05.440]  Every time I swing a stick, it's him running.
[3:14:05.440 --> 3:14:07.440]  But then you learn he doesn't run it.
[3:14:07.440 --> 3:14:10.440]  All these big foundations said,
[3:14:10.440 --> 3:14:12.440]  where do we put our money into this?
[3:14:12.440 --> 3:14:17.440]  And they went, oh, IBM and IBM needed somebody to make it look like it wasn't IBM
[3:14:17.440 --> 3:14:19.440]  because they were being broken up because of the trust.
[3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:20.440]  Right.
[3:14:20.440 --> 3:14:21.440]  He's a monopoly.
[3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:24.440]  So Bill Gates is the guy that sits at the Nexus Point with all the big
[3:14:24.440 --> 3:14:27.440]  Robert Barron money running eugenics.
[3:14:27.440 --> 3:14:30.440]  Well, I mean, look, everywhere I look, you're right.
[3:14:30.440 --> 3:14:31.440]  Every door you open, he's there.
[3:14:31.440 --> 3:14:34.440]  He's got his hands assuming they're called nonprofits.
[3:14:34.440 --> 3:14:35.440]  Yet what are they doing?
[3:14:35.440 --> 3:14:38.440]  They're testing products on innocent people in Africa, in India,
[3:14:38.440 --> 3:14:41.440]  that will go on to be sold for billions and trillions of dollars.
[3:14:41.440 --> 3:14:43.440]  I mean, these vaccines we're talking about,
[3:14:43.440 --> 3:14:48.440]  you could make $750 billion on a coronavirus vaccine right now.
[3:14:48.440 --> 3:14:51.440]  It's a hundred bucks a pop and it's given to 7.5 billion people.
[3:14:51.440 --> 3:14:53.440]  I mean, this is a dangerous situation.
[3:14:53.440 --> 3:14:56.440]  And you and I both know someone makes $750 billion.
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:14:58.440]  They're going to cut some corners if they think they're close.
[3:14:58.440 --> 3:14:59.440]  This is the amazing race.
[3:14:59.440 --> 3:15:00.440]  This is like a reality show.
[3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:05.440]  We're watching before our eyes only all of our lives are hanging to balance.
[3:15:05.440 --> 3:15:06.440]  Short testing periods.
[3:15:06.440 --> 3:15:09.440]  And by the way, one of the most dangerous vaccines ever attempted,
[3:15:09.440 --> 3:15:14.440]  do you know that it killed and maimed animals in all the animal trials up until this point?
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:16.440]  And we're skipping the animal trials.
[3:15:16.440 --> 3:15:19.440]  But when you go back and you study what after SARS coronavirus
[3:15:19.440 --> 3:15:23.440]  and they started trying to make a vaccine, multiple drug companies all had the same problem.
[3:15:23.440 --> 3:15:25.440]  So antibody and immune enhancement.
[3:15:25.440 --> 3:15:27.440]  We got general report, general report taken over,
[3:15:27.440 --> 3:15:29.440]  but I want you to be able to finish that statement when we come back
[3:15:29.440 --> 3:15:34.440]  because two more minutes on the side because I do know that, Mr. Big Tree.
[3:15:34.440 --> 3:15:40.440]  And that is exactly what's going on and that's what's so dangerous about all of this.
[3:15:40.440 --> 3:16:05.440]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:16:10.440 --> 3:16:36.440]  We'll be right back.
[3:16:40.440 --> 3:17:06.440]  We'll be right back.
[3:17:06.440 --> 3:17:21.440]  We'll be right back.
[3:17:36.440 --> 3:17:51.440]  We'll be right back.
[3:18:06.440 --> 3:18:33.440]  We'll be right back.
[3:18:33.440 --> 3:18:51.440]  We'll be right back.
[3:19:04.440 --> 3:19:11.440]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
