[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.080]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:36.080 --> 00:40.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. This is going to be a particularly
[00:40.920 --> 00:45.720]  powerful broadcast today. Dr. Jerome Corsi of WorldNetDaily, and of course, of all the
[00:45.720 --> 00:50.240]  New York Times, number one bestsellers, is scheduled to be in studio with us coming up
[00:50.240 --> 00:54.040]  later in the hour.
[00:54.040 --> 00:58.560]  And obviously, I'm gonna be covering a lot of important news in the meantime. The news
[00:58.560 --> 01:05.880]  is all so completely out of control and over the top that I don't even know how to respond
[01:05.880 --> 01:12.720]  at this point. If you go up to Infowars.com, airport terror announcements now being played
[01:12.720 --> 01:13.720]  in hotels.
[01:13.720 --> 01:18.680]  I mean, this is beyond 1984, where Big Brother's only in government buildings saying, watch
[01:18.680 --> 01:23.380]  your neighbors, look out for terrorists. This is now in the hotels. And they spy on the
[01:23.380 --> 01:29.340]  patrons and fill out data sheets on you even while you're eating. This is 5,000 plus major
[01:29.340 --> 01:32.720]  US hotels signed on to do this, all official.
[01:32.720 --> 01:38.840]  TSA is now conducting random warrantless checkpoints on South Lamar, that's about a mile and a
[01:38.840 --> 01:45.360]  half from where I'm sitting, and are searching people's persons and bags. And they announced
[01:45.360 --> 01:48.300]  they're just gonna do whatever they want. And I was told this about three months ago
[01:48.300 --> 01:50.920]  by a senior Austin police officer.
[01:50.920 --> 01:56.520]  He said they'd been told that they can't search someone without a warrant, but that the federal
[01:56.520 --> 02:01.000]  government is basically putting us under a civil emergency quietly. And that they're
[02:01.000 --> 02:06.880]  being told that you can do it when the TSA is there with you. And Austin police bullied
[02:06.880 --> 02:14.600]  people into being groped. And it's on local ABC News, we have the clip up there.
[02:14.600 --> 02:21.960]  This is going on yesterday while I'm on the radio. And reportedly, they're gonna be back.
[02:21.960 --> 02:26.760]  So it's gonna be a semi-permanent deal, just like Dallas and Houston. And I tell people
[02:26.760 --> 02:30.580]  five years ago TSA was showing up in Dallas and people said, that's not true, I haven't
[02:30.580 --> 02:31.580]  seen it on the news.
[02:31.580 --> 02:35.080]  But I talked to family that saw it. And about two years ago, they started having it in the
[02:35.080 --> 02:39.280]  news. There's no way you're gonna have feds searching people on the side of the road.
[02:39.280 --> 02:44.360]  Well, it's going on right now. And I mean, they had the army out at public events searching
[02:44.360 --> 02:48.880]  us in Austin, and they never announced it. It's there to acclimate in condition. All
[02:48.880 --> 02:52.440]  the border is wide open. In fact, I have video, we haven't even aired yet, we've been so overwhelmed
[02:52.440 --> 02:58.560]  and busy of illegal aliens just crossing in droves on the Texas-Mexico border.
[02:58.560 --> 03:05.200]  While the border patrol backs up park rangers harassing a UT alumni group of lawyers sitting
[03:05.200 --> 03:09.080]  around drinking a few courage lights. And they were writing them tickets, everything
[03:09.080 --> 03:16.560]  else. And I'm like, hey, there's illegal aliens right there, and just laughing at me. And
[03:16.560 --> 03:22.080]  then driving 70 miles from up by the border into the US and coming to a checkpoint where
[03:22.080 --> 03:23.400]  they wanted to search the vehicle.
[03:23.400 --> 03:27.360]  But I basically got in their face and told them, no, well, we've got all the footage
[03:27.360 --> 03:34.160]  of this. I mean, it's us, we comply, so we are slaves. And then I have off the chart
[03:34.160 --> 03:44.400]  video in Illinois where the neighbor and the homeowner, the police come and go over their
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.560]  fence without a warrant with the power company to put smart meters on that on record eavesdrop
[03:49.560 --> 03:50.560]  on you.
[03:50.560 --> 03:55.900]  And dial into all your new smart appliances on record and control how hot or cold your
[03:55.900 --> 04:00.060]  house can be and double charge you and all the rest of this garbage. It was developed
[04:00.060 --> 04:07.120]  by Enron 15 years ago as part of their fraud program. And the police, they're standing
[04:07.120 --> 04:10.680]  on the street and the police say, I don't give you authorization to fill me. The woman
[04:10.680 --> 04:15.940]  put it on YouTube and the police came, this is in the Chicago Tribune, and arrested her
[04:15.940 --> 04:18.080]  and are charging her with resisting.
[04:18.080 --> 04:24.320]  They say, in the affidavit, talking to them was resisting. And the woman's like, you don't
[04:24.320 --> 04:27.480]  have a right to be in my backyard. I don't want this smart meter. I've told them I don't
[04:27.480 --> 04:33.520]  want it. And the police say, we'll do whatever we want. And they look like total guns. And
[04:33.520 --> 04:37.000]  then they came and arrested her and they said, you're lucky we're not charging with a felony.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.820]  Actually, the courts have thrown it out over 100 times in Illinois. They're doing it as
[04:40.820 --> 04:46.840]  the misdemeanor so they can trick her in the regular court to not getting her jury trial.
[04:46.840 --> 04:52.880]  I mean, this government is absolutely rapacious and criminal. We're all in grave danger. The
[04:52.880 --> 05:00.400]  founders warned us, keep government on a short leash or it'll put you on a leash.
[05:00.400 --> 05:04.440]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as

[07:47.240 --> 07:54.760]  plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at info wars.com

[08:09.200 --> 08:19.360]  to the Alex Jones show. It is Friday, the 25th day of January 2013. I am your host,
[08:19.360 --> 08:23.720]  Alex Jones, and we're going to be here live for the next three hours. Dr. Jerome Corsi
[08:23.720 --> 08:28.080]  is here. He'll be in studio with us coming up in about 25 minutes, and we have other
[08:28.080 --> 08:31.400]  guests today coming up as well.
[08:31.400 --> 08:37.840]  Okay, where to start? Number one, Dianne Feinstein's gun confiscation bill, because that's basically
[08:37.840 --> 08:46.360]  what it does, and it bans hundreds and hundreds of guns, not 150, exempts police and retired
[08:46.360 --> 08:55.600]  police and other government workers for life from these laws. This is a title of nobility.
[08:55.600 --> 09:01.120]  That's what nobility was. You could be signed up as a sir, was the lowest level, and then
[09:01.120 --> 09:09.200]  ride up to lords and dukes and barons. If you would serve the system, well, you're exempt
[09:09.200 --> 09:10.940]  from all the laws.
[09:10.940 --> 09:17.440]  And that's what one of the Rockefellers told the late, great filmmaker Aaron Russo in Hollywood.
[09:17.440 --> 09:22.320]  He told him, look, we're all gonna have a microchip that says, kiss my butt, using the
[09:22.320 --> 09:27.940]  more pejorative term, kiss my you know what. Where we're just above the law, national security,
[09:27.940 --> 09:32.720]  we go around the checkpoints, around the body scanners, around the control, we're exempt,
[09:32.720 --> 09:33.720]  you're not.
[09:33.720 --> 09:38.320]  You'll all be face scanned and controlled. Well, Rand Corporation, MIT, they've all said
[09:38.320 --> 09:46.960]  that is the plan. And we are going under martial law, incrementally, checkpoints all over the
[09:46.960 --> 09:53.560]  highways, police taking blood without warrants. Now gang gun checkpoints all over the country
[09:53.560 --> 09:57.800]  where they randomly from New York to Texas, pull you over and search your car.
[09:57.800 --> 10:02.680]  Totally illegal, but it's being announced. We got the video coming up with this and the
[10:02.680 --> 10:09.000]  audio for radio listeners, the article's up at infowars.com right now. TSA conducts random
[10:09.000 --> 10:14.960]  checks at Austin train station. Well, actually, they did it out on South Lamar on the road
[10:14.960 --> 10:20.420]  downtown. And we have the video, that is coming up.
[10:20.420 --> 10:26.680]  We have, again, Feinstein gun control bill to exempt government officials. That's anybody
[10:26.680 --> 10:30.640]  in government, federal government, for life and police. See, the police are like, well,
[10:30.640 --> 10:34.680]  I don't wanna give my guns up when I retire. Well, they're saying, don't worry, you're
[10:34.680 --> 10:35.680]  gonna be exempt.
[10:35.680 --> 10:41.360]  They told the Russian military and the Russian federal police the same thing in 1917. And
[10:41.360 --> 10:44.840]  so they went along with the gun confiscation of the general public. And of course, you
[10:44.840 --> 10:49.600]  know what happened to the police and military after that. This is a totally unconstitutional
[10:49.600 --> 10:56.800]  discriminatory, but see, you're taught discrimination is black, white, North, South, man, woman,
[10:56.800 --> 11:00.680]  Hispanic, white, Catholic, Protestant. You're taught all that.
[11:00.680 --> 11:06.080]  No, discrimination is the big mega banks exempt from taxes, lobbying to have your taxes raised
[11:06.080 --> 11:14.120]  to give themselves corporate welfare your money. Discrimination is governments exempt
[11:14.120 --> 11:22.480]  from smart meter corporate taxes, but you are double, triple charged. Smart meters,
[11:22.480 --> 11:28.620]  and all of this are the tools of total control. And we actually have articles here out of
[11:28.620 --> 11:35.140]  the Daily Caller, but also one out of the Huffington Post where they quote the Democrats
[11:35.140 --> 11:39.860]  and Governor Cuomo and others is saying, it doesn't exclude retired police officers.
[11:39.860 --> 11:45.040]  So all of them have to turn in their guns and magazines and stuff like that. He said,
[11:45.040 --> 11:52.200]  what they did is disarm the good guys and make sure the bad guys outlaw them. That was
[11:52.200 --> 11:57.640]  said by a police officer. But so now they're talking about trying to pass a law in New
[11:57.640 --> 12:02.400]  York so the police can keep their guns. Here's another one, Feinstein gun control bill to
[12:02.400 --> 12:08.400]  exempt government officials. Not everyone will have and be able to abide by Senator
[12:08.400 --> 12:10.080]  Dianne Feinstein's gun control bill.
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.020]  If the proposed legislation becomes law, government officials, not servants, they are officials,
[12:15.020 --> 12:23.040]  they are royalty. Red carpets, everything, and others will be exempt. And it goes on
[12:23.040 --> 12:30.440]  to say feds, police, and others that can get a federal waiver. So see, that's out of the
[12:30.440 --> 12:35.040]  weekly standard. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what our forebears revolted against.
[12:35.040 --> 12:42.600]  You could not buy land unless you were nobility in the colonies, large pieces of land. You
[12:42.600 --> 12:46.480]  couldn't get an export license or an import license unless you were, quote, part of the
[12:46.480 --> 12:54.640]  gentry nobility, a sir or above, a lord's son. And so everybody sat there, not able
[12:54.640 --> 12:59.880]  to do business, not able to live, watching lesser men run everything.
[12:59.880 --> 13:06.200]  George Washington couldn't manufacture carriages, he wanted to. He had to buy at five, six times
[13:06.200 --> 13:12.360]  what they cost in England on top of the shipping, his gentleman's carriage. You had to buy
[13:12.360 --> 13:16.440]  the finished clothes from England. There were laws, you couldn't make firearms, you couldn't
[13:16.440 --> 13:20.200]  make hammers, you couldn't make nails, you couldn't have finished goods here.
[13:20.200 --> 13:25.020]  As a globalist tool, mercantile tool, to not let development take place and to make everything
[13:25.020 --> 13:29.480]  be back in the home country where the globalist, where the empire controlled things. Just like
[13:29.480 --> 13:34.480]  today, it can only be made in China because of regulations here that make it impossible
[13:34.480 --> 13:35.480]  to be competitive.
[13:35.480 --> 13:40.080]  Well, back then, they just outright outlawed it. This is why our forebears were willing
[13:40.080 --> 13:46.560]  to lose everything and die because they were sick of literally being spit on by the royals.
[13:46.560 --> 13:51.540]  And now government with the red carpets and the officials and the titles. I mean, I saw
[13:51.540 --> 13:56.780]  Dianne Feinstein and all of her minions up there yesterday with all of the traitor police
[13:56.780 --> 13:59.920]  chiefs or the big city crime syndicates that they brought in.
[13:59.920 --> 14:04.680]  And they had two cordons in front of the guns going, we have to have two cordons in front
[14:04.680 --> 14:08.880]  of this. None of the media could even walk by the assault weapons, the semi-autos, because
[14:08.880 --> 14:12.960]  they're so dangerous. I actually have CNN saying this, we're gonna play the clip later.
[14:12.960 --> 14:16.120]  Just total mind control, talking to us like we're three years old, saying the boogeyman's
[14:16.120 --> 14:21.400]  over there. And Feinstein saying, I got a special waiver to even have these unloaded
[14:21.400 --> 14:22.400]  guns here.
[14:22.400 --> 14:25.640]  Like, they're so deadly. Again, I've always told you they have these sitcoms and dramas
[14:25.640 --> 14:30.540]  based in New York where guns are banned. Where everybody sees the image of guns being illegal
[14:30.540 --> 14:34.720]  and people going to jail for having guns to wear a carpet cleaners in your house, sees
[14:34.720 --> 14:39.000]  a gun case and calls the police in Texas or Arizona.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.820]  This happens all the time. And the future, they're saying Homeland Security will respond
[14:43.820 --> 14:48.820]  to any reports of even legal guns and go ahead and take them to, quote, make sure you're
[14:48.820 --> 14:53.240]  not a criminal and then make you go through psychiatric evaluation if anyone calls on
[14:53.240 --> 14:54.560]  you saying you have guns.
[14:54.560 --> 15:00.560]  This has all been announced, okay, so they know what they're doing. Behind two cordons,
[15:00.560 --> 15:08.940]  we have the guns, they're so deadly. And these police chiefs say, ban them. And they themselves,
[15:08.940 --> 15:13.520]  the New York Police Department, it's in the news right here in my stack, is lobbying to
[15:13.520 --> 15:18.760]  have a new bill passed so they can keep their guns when they retire.
[15:18.760 --> 15:24.840]  Unbelievably wicked criminals, vicious, hateful. And they say in these quotes, we've gotta
[15:24.840 --> 15:30.320]  protect ourselves from criminals once we retire. There's a quote in the Huffington Post, the
[15:30.320 --> 15:35.000]  irony is not lost on anybody saying, well, I mean, once we retire, we gotta have guns
[15:35.000 --> 15:36.000]  to protect ourselves.
[15:36.000 --> 15:43.400]  The criminals are still gonna have guns. Really? The criminals are still gonna have, you're
[15:43.400 --> 15:51.960]  gonna have guns because you're the new royalty. You're the officials. You're the authorities,
[15:51.960 --> 15:58.720]  not the servants, not the peace officers. You are the law enforcement officers and the
[15:58.720 --> 16:03.280]  movies and the culture show nothing but the citizens groveling to the police.
[16:03.280 --> 16:08.240]  Now, I'm gonna get to the TSA checkpoints where I live. See, the army was out a few
[16:08.240 --> 16:13.760]  months ago. And Austinites should just rise up and go to the city council and the state
[16:13.760 --> 16:20.080]  capital. This is all illegal. I want them out. This is illegal. And it's all getting
[16:20.080 --> 16:23.680]  you ready. Why are they getting you ready for trips on the streets and TSA checkpoints?
[16:23.680 --> 16:30.560]  I mean, down the street from me, on the road, searching people. Illegally, violation of
[16:30.560 --> 16:37.920]  the Fourth Amendment, Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment. Why are they doing this?
[16:37.920 --> 16:42.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, because they're criminals. They're collapsing the whole society and they
[16:42.320 --> 16:46.480]  know they're all going to jail if they don't totally take over and arrest their opposition.
[16:46.480 --> 16:50.680]  They've stolen tens of trillions of derivatives. The people running things make Ken Lay look
[16:50.680 --> 16:59.040]  like a choir boy, an angel, literally. They are total ruthless mafia and they know that
[16:59.040 --> 17:00.040]  we're waking up to them.
[17:00.040 --> 17:05.040]  They know there's a 9% approval rating. New evidence has come out on CNN that I'm gonna
[17:05.040 --> 17:08.840]  be airing tonight. That's all I've got to say concerning the Sandy Hook shooting. You
[17:08.840 --> 17:11.840]  know I have questions about it. I always do. They have a history of staging these things.
[17:11.840 --> 17:15.880]  So I believe and know people were killed there from the evidence we have. But there was definitely
[17:15.880 --> 17:17.600]  all the signs this is being managed.
[17:17.600 --> 17:21.480]  In fact, now it's pretty conclusive. I'm gonna air that tonight. I'm shaken to my core right
[17:21.480 --> 17:28.600]  now. I mean, again, every instinct I've got is to flee this country right now. And I know
[17:28.600 --> 17:33.140]  others are bad as well. But I mean, this country is gonna be the center of the nastiest stuff
[17:33.140 --> 17:37.120]  the world has ever seen if these crooks get their way.
[17:37.120 --> 17:41.640]  And all of you that serve the system, you're gonna wish later you'd done something. The
[17:41.640 --> 17:47.440]  prosperity, everything, it's gone. It's gonna be totally gone, like oxygen out of the room.
[17:47.440 --> 17:55.040]  I saw footage this morning when I got up at about 6 AM at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[17:55.040 --> 18:01.480]  that Paul Watson did an article on that really hurt me. Now I've had the people on charge
[18:01.480 --> 18:06.560]  with life in prison for filming cops in public in Illinois.
[18:06.560 --> 18:11.240]  Courts throw it out, state appeals, they wanna put you in jail for life for filming them.
[18:11.240 --> 18:15.600]  This is an upscale neighborhood, the footage up at infowars.com. The neighbors friends
[18:15.600 --> 18:23.000]  with the attractive redheaded housewife. And the police are going over their fence, putting
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.560]  in the smart meter, and she goes, look, wireless makes my son sick.
[18:26.560 --> 18:31.920]  We've discovered this, I've discovered it, it's certainly happening. But regardless,
[18:31.920 --> 18:35.920]  the things spy on you on record and tie into all the new electronics, they admit that,
[18:35.920 --> 18:40.560]  that are designed so they tie into it. They brag about this. And the police look like
[18:40.560 --> 18:51.800]  total scary goons. And they are now charging her with resisting police for talking to her,
[18:51.800 --> 18:53.920]  I've got the affidavit.
[18:53.920 --> 19:00.720]  And they're charging her for eavesdropping, and they arrested her. They came back and
[19:00.720 --> 19:04.880]  said we saw that on YouTube, you didn't have a right to film me in public while they film
[19:04.880 --> 19:09.660]  us and put smart meters on the spy on us. And break the law crossing their property
[19:09.660 --> 19:14.360]  to put this on their house, while she's telling them don't do it.
[19:14.360 --> 19:21.440]  And then the police chief of the town, I have it all listed here, it's also the Chicago
[19:21.440 --> 19:26.600]  Tribune, they're reporting it like it's good, came and arrested the neighbor who was there,
[19:26.600 --> 19:31.760]  her friend called her. The woman's barefooted in the cold, cuz her neighbor called her and
[19:31.760 --> 19:34.560]  she's like, please, you don't have a right to be on my property.
[19:34.560 --> 19:40.840]  The cops just pushed past her, bust open the fence, go in, they're placing it. The woman's
[19:40.840 --> 19:45.760]  standing on the street filming and they imagine the police came and arrested her. Next, they're
[19:45.760 --> 19:51.560]  going to disappear us and they want life in prison for the woman. Life in prison, we have
[19:51.560 --> 19:56.560]  links to them, life in prison for filming them on the sidewalk.
[19:56.560 --> 20:00.760]  Now folks, tell me we're not living in a FEMA camp.
[20:00.760 --> 20:05.600]  Coming back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters
[20:05.600 --> 20:10.160]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on
[20:10.160 --> 20:15.280]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[20:29.560 --> 20:34.320]  to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

[22:00.080 --> 22:04.040]  Do you know how much the dollar has lost in its value against other currencies in the
[22:04.040 --> 22:09.320]  last 90 days? Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your
[22:09.320 --> 22:14.960]  retirement plans? Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic? Put another
[22:14.960 --> 22:20.960]  way. Who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?

[22:59.640 --> 23:05.740]  Is 2013 your year to achieve more? More vitality? More health? More well-being? Hi, this is
[23:05.740 --> 23:10.720]  Pastor Jenny. For 25 years, I spent my life's work teaching others how to achieve more.
[23:10.720 --> 23:16.440]  But in 2010, I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops. I learned that there are millions
[23:16.440 --> 23:21.120]  of gene switches latent in every single cell of my body that are waiting for an activator.
[23:21.120 --> 23:26.220]  I learned by taking RNA drops, I could begin to activate that power in my cells and achieve
[23:26.220 --> 23:30.520]  the more that I desire. I'd like to share what I discovered with you and send you a
[23:30.520 --> 23:36.400]  free 30-day supply of RNA drops valued at $50 for just the cost of shipping and handling.
[23:36.400 --> 23:46.720]  Go to RNAfreesample.com. That's RNAfreesample.com. Or call me toll-free at 888-577-3703. That's
[23:46.720 --> 24:05.440]  888-577-3703. RNAfreesample.com. Discover the more that's waiting for you.
[24:05.440 --> 24:12.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we even have video of it. Alex Jones here back live at 5,500 plus
[24:12.520 --> 24:17.680]  major hotels in the US. We have the press releases up there from the companies. They
[24:17.680 --> 24:21.400]  are now announcing what we first showed you about two years ago with the FEMA training
[24:21.400 --> 24:24.220]  videos for TSA.
[24:24.220 --> 24:29.600]  Where you walk around the hotel and it says, look for terrorists, report suspicious things.
[24:29.600 --> 24:34.200]  Or you go on the Walmarts and there's the telescreens. They're now going in everywhere.
[24:34.200 --> 24:38.600]  And when you go up, not just to get a rent car, but to check in, they ask you, who you
[24:38.600 --> 24:43.840]  coming to see? What's going on? They are entering it into a Homeland Security database. So imagine
[24:43.840 --> 24:47.100]  everything is a police conversation.
[24:47.100 --> 24:54.920]  This makes the East German Stasi look like cavemen when it came to spying. And it's all
[24:54.920 --> 25:00.120]  happening quote for Al-Qaeda, who our government publicly now runs. Do I get an apology from
[25:00.120 --> 25:03.240]  everybody? Britain's and other westerners told to leave Benghazi after imminent terror
[25:03.240 --> 25:05.960]  threat by Al-Qaeda, the same Al-Qaeda they gave Libya.
[25:05.960 --> 25:10.000]  And they think you're so dumb you won't remember that. Now they're saying we've got to have
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.720]  checkpoints on highways as I predicted. In fact, I have that because Al-Qaeda may have
[25:13.720 --> 25:17.680]  gotten heat seeking missiles out of Libya. I don't even have time to toot my horn. How
[25:17.680 --> 25:21.720]  many times I told you in the last year since they got all those heat seekers, 10,000 plus
[25:21.720 --> 25:25.940]  of them, they'd be saying that now they're saying heat seeking missiles.
[25:25.940 --> 25:29.880]  Our government gives them the heat seeking missiles and now is gonna run checkpoints
[25:29.880 --> 25:35.700]  where I live. And I will not put up with it, you terrorist. I know you did it. And again,
[25:35.700 --> 25:38.840]  it's not, quote, even our government. Most of the government's compartmentalized. It's
[25:38.840 --> 25:43.040]  the foreign mega banks. This is how they're gonna take over. They tell you it's for Al-Qaeda,
[25:43.040 --> 25:44.040]  it's for the American people.
[25:44.040 --> 25:48.080]  Now, Illinois is the worst about this. We're on several stations in Illinois, including
[25:48.080 --> 25:53.680]  Chicago. And I see these videos. We've had people on from Illinois who've been charged
[25:53.680 --> 25:58.400]  with life imprisonment, got thrown out by the judge. But the state came and did a brief
[25:58.400 --> 26:04.080]  and said, no, we want this guy in jail. Now this woman calls her neighbor, she comes up
[26:04.080 --> 26:07.600]  with her filming. If you're a radio listener, I'm gonna narrate it for you.
[26:07.600 --> 26:13.920]  They go, a very nice neighborhood. It looks like they're $500,000 houses or more. Nice,
[26:13.920 --> 26:20.440]  and again, my point is nice, attractive, conservative looking women. I mean, no one's safe, folks,
[26:20.440 --> 26:25.120]  okay? And the police look like total goons. They have that arrogant sly look, like we
[26:25.120 --> 26:26.120]  do whatever we want.
[26:26.120 --> 26:30.380]  They have the look of gangsters. I mean, I've been to towns where they got good police.
[26:30.380 --> 26:34.320]  You can instantly see they're good guys. They're baring how they act. They're humble, but
[26:34.320 --> 26:40.720]  they're serious. These are thugs, in my view, just watching them. And then they go across,
[26:40.720 --> 26:46.120]  violate her Fourth Amendment, put it in, the video's up at Infowars.com, it's so incredible.
[26:46.120 --> 26:55.560]  It's gotta go viral. And her neighbor films it for her and their friends talking from
[26:55.560 --> 27:03.560]  the sidewalk. And they're now charging her with, well, I'll read the article in a moment.
[27:03.560 --> 27:07.080]  Here is just some of the audio for radio listeners and video for people watching us right now
[27:07.080 --> 27:10.760]  at Infowarsnews.com, here it is.
[27:10.760 --> 27:14.240]  Here's UPA installers crossing over locked fences.
[27:14.240 --> 27:17.760]  Climbing them over. Against consent.
[27:17.760 --> 27:18.760]  Bolt cutters.
[27:18.760 --> 27:25.520]  They are going onto people's properties with police permission. They are crossing.
[27:25.520 --> 27:27.840]  The permission? Well, the government's gone.
[27:27.840 --> 27:30.240]  Laura, do you give consent to have this-
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.600]  No, absolutely not. This is putting my child in harm's way. My child has a chronic illness
[27:35.600 --> 27:40.560]  and it could affect her illness and make it worse. And I absolutely don't agree.
[27:40.560 --> 27:44.080]  Can I step away from the fence for a minute?
[27:44.080 --> 27:45.080]  Why?
[27:45.080 --> 27:46.080]  So I can get through.
[27:46.080 --> 27:51.280]  Okay, so police are now crossing locked fences without homeowner's consent.
[27:51.280 --> 27:52.440]  Just do whatever they want.
[27:52.440 --> 27:55.640]  And opening. Laura, do you give consent?
[27:55.640 --> 27:57.960]  Those look like million dollar houses, actually.
[27:57.960 --> 27:58.960]  82 million dollar.
[27:58.960 --> 28:02.960]  Protecting the city. It's like a dictatorship.
[28:02.960 --> 28:06.080]  Guarantee these women are listeners. We're gonna get them on.
[28:06.080 --> 28:08.680]  Officer, do you feel comfortable with what you're doing?
[28:08.680 --> 28:09.680]  No, he doesn't.
[28:09.680 --> 28:14.960]  We're already saying they're not gonna be putting smart meters on your house, ladies.
[28:14.960 --> 28:18.240]  So, Laura, you're the homeowner? Those two men that are on your property-
[28:18.240 --> 28:21.480]  They take what they want. They always do in history.
[28:21.480 --> 28:24.540]  Knowing that my daughter is chronically ill and this could affect her illness.
[28:24.540 --> 28:29.600]  That's enough. The whole video's up there. There's a lot more of it. And you can go read
[28:29.600 --> 28:33.600]  the article here. The Chicago Tribune is very excited about wanting to put this woman in
[28:33.600 --> 28:34.600]  jail.
[28:34.600 --> 28:38.880]  Illinois, cuz that'll teach the slaves. Cuz people are part of the ruling class. This
[28:38.880 --> 28:47.200]  is fun to route us. It says, Illinois, citizens still being arrested for filming police despite
[28:47.200 --> 28:51.560]  court ruling which blocked unconstitutional law. So in your own property, you don't film
[28:51.560 --> 28:52.560]  God.
[28:52.560 --> 28:56.500]  Illinois citizens are still being arrested for recording police officers despite a Seventh
[28:56.500 --> 29:01.080]  Circuit Court of Appeals ruling last year that blocked the enforcement of the law on
[29:01.080 --> 29:05.600]  the grounds that it was unconstitutional. They say public filming is eavesdropping.
[29:05.600 --> 29:11.800]  Following yesterday's story concerning residents of Naperville who attempted to resist utility
[29:11.800 --> 29:16.480]  workers by speaking to them, invading their private property to install so-called smart
[29:16.480 --> 29:20.960]  meters which have been linked with health issues. It emerged that one of the Refuseniks,
[29:20.960 --> 29:26.760]  Malia Kim-Vandis, was arrested on attempted eavesdropping charges for recording police
[29:26.760 --> 29:28.000]  officers during the incident.
[29:28.000 --> 29:31.920]  They charge her for other stuff too. The irony of citizens being arrested for supposedly
[29:31.920 --> 29:36.840]  eavesdropping on cops in public where there is no expectation of privacy while simultaneously
[29:36.840 --> 29:41.440]  the government forcibly installs devices on people's property on record that do eavesdrop
[29:41.440 --> 29:45.520]  and spy on everything you're doing in your home is incredible. We'll be right back with
[29:45.520 --> 29:46.960]  a lot more It Gets Worse.

[33:22.160 --> 33:41.200]  All right, we're going to be joined here in just a moment. He's sitting around next to
[33:41.200 --> 33:45.200]  me by Dr. Jerome Corsi, a WorldNetDaily best-selling author, worked with the State Department and
[33:45.200 --> 33:50.640]  other intelligence agencies. He can certainly speak to Benghazi and the whitewash there.
[33:50.640 --> 33:56.480]  Several zones that Communist Chinese are setting up, Inside America, NAFTA and GATT, expanding
[33:56.480 --> 34:00.360]  the North American Union, the gun grabbing that's going on. We're gonna talk about all
[34:00.360 --> 34:01.900]  of it with him in just a moment.
[34:01.900 --> 34:06.960]  But first off, I said I would announce this a few weeks ago, I've just been too busy,
[34:06.960 --> 34:16.360]  but it is the biggest contest we've ever had. And it is for $115,000, our new film contest,
[34:16.360 --> 34:23.240]  $115,000, first place $100,000 cash prize, second place $10,000, third place $5,000.
[34:23.240 --> 34:29.040]  And then you will be in a pool in the running to have Infowars.com and our news operation
[34:29.040 --> 34:33.920]  finance your film to then put it out not just on the Internet for free like I've done with
[34:33.920 --> 34:39.280]  all my others, but what we've seen Dinesh D'Souza and others do, putting them in theaters.
[34:39.280 --> 34:43.020]  Now I've always known how to do this. And it's not that I shrink from work, it's just
[34:43.020 --> 34:48.760]  that I know the model, I have a lot of Hollywood contacts, as people know. And so that is going
[34:48.760 --> 34:54.160]  to be the plan. Now they may shut everything down by then, but regardless, $100,000 sounds
[34:54.160 --> 34:55.380]  like a lot of money and it is.
[34:55.380 --> 34:59.960]  The biggest contest out there is Doritos, it's 100,000. So this is the biggest contest
[34:59.960 --> 35:06.440]  next to Doritos, Twin Peaks up there. And with the other 15,000, it's the biggest. But
[35:06.440 --> 35:12.280]  for the bang for the buck Liberty films that are put on YouTube, whether they're three
[35:12.280 --> 35:15.800]  minutes or two hours, that's the rules between three and two hours long.
[35:15.800 --> 35:20.360]  It can be history, it can be drama, it can be fiction, nonfiction, Gena 21, Second Amendment,
[35:20.360 --> 35:23.400]  you name it. I'm gonna talk about that at the bottom of the next hour when Dr. Courtney
[35:23.400 --> 35:26.580]  leaves us. He's with us for the rest of the hour and then half of the next hour. And I'll
[35:26.580 --> 35:31.160]  play the special video announcement that will be posted in the next 30 minutes or so up
[35:31.160 --> 35:32.800]  at Infowars.com.
[35:32.800 --> 35:41.000]  I'll play that four minute announcement for everybody up at Infowars.com. So that press
[35:41.000 --> 35:49.280]  release and more coming in T-minus about 56 minutes from now. That will go live at prisonplanet.com
[35:49.280 --> 35:55.120]  and infowars.com. And again, for $100,000 or $115,000, they'll probably be 500 films
[35:55.120 --> 35:57.280]  made. A couple hundred of them are gonna be excellent.
[35:57.280 --> 36:00.920]  A few of them will be off the chart and it'll be a win-win. Everybody that enters is gonna
[36:00.920 --> 36:06.680]  be a winner, cuz you get the word out about The Globalist. This is Operation All Revere.
[36:06.680 --> 36:11.040]  And the Bombay doors are open. We're over The Globalist. We drop the bomb, the info
[36:11.040 --> 36:16.520]  weapon, in T-minus 55 minutes and counting. We're gonna turn loose the power of the people.
[36:16.520 --> 36:22.640]  This will be our 22nd contest. We've already paid out over $150,000 over the years of these
[36:22.640 --> 36:26.640]  contests. We're gonna do that basically all in one fail swoop. And then you'll have a
[36:26.640 --> 36:32.080]  chance to be part of the production of three films a year, big films and over a dozen smaller
[36:32.080 --> 36:33.080]  films.
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.680]  We've put everything into this fight. So keep buying the books, the videos, the t-shirts,
[36:37.680 --> 36:42.360]  the propure water filters at infowarstore.com. Keep supporting our sponsors. Keep spreading
[36:42.360 --> 36:46.680]  the word because we're taking those Federal Reserve notes in and turning it right back
[36:46.680 --> 36:48.880]  against the enemy. Wars cost money.
[36:48.880 --> 36:53.480]  And the reason we've been so successful is we have history, we're dogged, we're focused,
[36:53.480 --> 36:59.480]  and we are putting the money back into the fight, not into private jets. Okay, so that's
[36:59.480 --> 37:06.240]  what's happening here, ladies and gentlemen. Now, Dr. Jerome Corsi joins us here in studio.
[37:06.240 --> 37:10.920]  He received a PhD from Harvard University in political science at 72. And he's also
[37:10.920 --> 37:15.000]  currently a senior staff reporter for WorldNetDaily. He's had a whole bunch of number one best
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.960]  sellers like Unfit for Command and others.
[37:18.960 --> 37:23.080]  And again, he's had five number one New York Times best sellers, I guess. He's just amazing.
[37:23.080 --> 37:27.200]  And he also worked in security and other highly classified areas for the State Department
[37:27.200 --> 37:32.760]  and for unnamed intelligence agencies. And he joins us here to break down what's happening.
[37:32.760 --> 37:36.400]  Doc, before we get into Benghazi, before we get into agenda 21, before we get into the
[37:36.400 --> 37:41.040]  total rush that's happening and Feinstein saying titles of nobility to government people
[37:41.040 --> 37:45.600]  to be exempt from gun laws even after they're out of office and police.
[37:45.600 --> 37:51.320]  Before we get into all of that, what do you make of airport terror announcements now in
[37:51.320 --> 37:56.240]  hotels, highway checkpoints here in Austin now looking for terrorists while the borders
[37:56.240 --> 38:00.200]  are wide open? I mean, they are really accelerating things. What's happening?
[38:00.200 --> 38:04.480]  Well, I think it's a whole clamp down, the whole decision by the government to get as
[38:04.480 --> 38:10.080]  much information on the populace as they can get. I mean, you gotta remember, it wasn't
[38:10.080 --> 38:16.280]  just the Nazis confiscated guns. The Nazis were experts in censuses and getting people
[38:16.280 --> 38:19.520]  to tell them what they owned, where it was.
[38:19.520 --> 38:25.360]  When the Nazis came to take the Jews away, they could say, where is that bracelet you
[38:25.360 --> 38:29.800]  described in such and such a census? And you said you used to keep it in this drawer, where
[38:29.800 --> 38:33.680]  is it now? I mean, it got down to that kind of specific information.
[38:33.680 --> 38:35.360]  Everyone just loves submitting.
[38:35.360 --> 38:39.320]  And submitting, people say, we gotta fill out all these forms, we gotta do all these
[38:39.320 --> 38:45.400]  census reports. And by the way, Alex, I never worked as an employee of the government, I
[38:45.400 --> 38:46.400]  worked with these agents.
[38:46.400 --> 38:47.400]  You were a consultant.
[38:47.400 --> 38:50.800]  Consultant, I just wanted to make that clear so people didn't think I was misrepresenting
[38:50.800 --> 38:53.360]  anything I've done. I'm always precise on that.
[38:53.360 --> 38:55.600]  And you've worked in finance for some of the big outfits.
[38:55.600 --> 39:01.280]  25 years in finance for banks around the world and still have all my securities and insurance
[39:01.280 --> 39:02.280]  licenses.
[39:02.280 --> 39:05.760]  Well, we know all the real agents actually aren't in the agencies.
[39:05.760 --> 39:10.940]  It's better not to be in the agencies. But anyway, look, the whole purpose right now
[39:10.940 --> 39:17.680]  is to collect information. My corporations, we just got forms coming from, I believe,
[39:17.680 --> 39:23.040]  the Census Bureau or the Commerce Department, all kinds of detailed information.
[39:23.040 --> 39:26.640]  My point was, you worked high level in the State Department in security. Tell folks,
[39:26.640 --> 39:28.640]  since we never brought that up, what you did do in that area.
[39:28.640 --> 39:35.440]  It was a period of time I was working with some top psychiatrists here, actually in Dallas.
[39:35.440 --> 39:39.620]  And we went into the State Department and trained State Department personnel on hostage
[39:39.620 --> 39:45.400]  survival techniques. This was right after the takeover of the embassy in Tehran.
[39:45.400 --> 39:52.520]  I spent almost two years doing high level work on survival of terrorist incidents and
[39:52.520 --> 39:56.400]  developed protocol for the State Department and the State Department employees around
[39:56.400 --> 39:57.400]  the world.
[39:57.400 --> 40:02.020]  A lot of that information is being used today. I developed a computer model that predicted
[40:02.020 --> 40:06.280]  the outcome of terrorist events, published it in an international journal of conflict
[40:06.280 --> 40:07.640]  resolution at Yale.
[40:07.640 --> 40:11.960]  My point is, you can really speak to Benghazi. That's why I brought all this up. I mean,
[40:11.960 --> 40:14.400]  we've even got General Boykin coming out. Let's get into that now.
[40:14.400 --> 40:19.640]  Well, I mean, first of all, the Benghazi issue is one that we have to, first of all, figure
[40:19.640 --> 40:24.200]  out what they were doing there. And what they were doing, as far as I can figure out, Stevens
[40:24.200 --> 40:29.000]  and the others, is they were, it was another kind of fast and furious operation bringing
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.280]  weapons into Libya.
[40:32.280 --> 40:35.600]  With the ultimate intent, they were gonna end up with Al-Qaeda. And a lot of those weapons
[40:35.600 --> 40:40.600]  today are ending up in Syria. The same weapons, if we could track them, I would believe the
[40:40.600 --> 40:44.360]  weapons that were brought in by the US government through Libya-
[40:44.360 --> 40:47.620]  Well, that's what the former head of Special Forces Boykin, General Boykin's saying.
[40:47.620 --> 40:53.680]  I think some of them were used by the Mali Al-Qaeda terrorists in that attack. But if
[40:53.680 --> 40:56.160]  we could find and track those weapons, you've got-
[40:56.160 --> 41:00.000]  Why would the State Department want, because they had a huge weapons cash at that safe
[41:00.000 --> 41:01.000]  house.
[41:01.000 --> 41:02.000]  Yes.
[41:02.000 --> 41:05.280]  And then why would for eight hours the White House be caught lying? We now know, order
[41:05.280 --> 41:10.040]  a stand down. Were they trying to get rid of people after the transaction? Or was it
[41:10.040 --> 41:13.680]  a double cross by the Al-Qaeda security they hired to run Benghazi?
[41:13.680 --> 41:18.560]  Well, see, first of all, I think there's so many games going on on this. First of all,
[41:18.560 --> 41:25.040]  Stevens, you remember, came into Benghazi when Gaddafi was in power. He came in through
[41:25.040 --> 41:27.760]  a cargo ship or something. He kind of snuck in.
[41:27.760 --> 41:28.760]  Tripoli.
[41:28.760 --> 41:31.480]  Yeah, Tripoli. He came into Tripoli, ended up in Benghazi.
[41:31.480 --> 41:33.060]  Yeah, the Commando invasion.
[41:33.060 --> 41:41.600]  And was funding and providing weapons to eliminate Gaddafi. So these people who ended up killing
[41:41.600 --> 41:48.200]  Stevens were actually funded and gotten weapons to them and to their allies. But then now,
[41:48.200 --> 41:53.200]  see, Stevens is turning on them. We realized we're missing maybe a million weapons. We
[41:53.200 --> 41:57.320]  don't know where they are. And Stevens is trying to find out where those weapons are.
[41:57.320 --> 42:01.720]  Al-Qaeda was taking and shipping those weapons into Syria. We're beginning to find out these
[42:01.720 --> 42:02.720]  weapons are-
[42:02.720 --> 42:05.080]  Well, of course, the West wants that. They're running the whole attack.
[42:05.080 --> 42:10.680]  And in fact, it's the same thing as we did in Fast and Furious. We provided the weapons.
[42:10.680 --> 42:15.680]  The weapons ended up in the hands of the gun cartels. Look, I just did this big expose
[42:15.680 --> 42:24.760]  on HSBC Bank. HSBC Bank doing major money laundering for the Mexican drug cartels. They
[42:24.760 --> 42:30.920]  just paid something like a billion dollars in fines on the information that we helped
[42:30.920 --> 42:31.920]  to develop.
[42:31.920 --> 42:37.880]  It comes to the final realization, look, we are the drug cartels. You don't money launder
[42:37.880 --> 42:43.600]  a billion dollars of money, bring it to the Tijuana branch in $100 bills and having it
[42:43.600 --> 42:46.640]  put into an account without the federal government knowing about it.
[42:46.640 --> 42:52.320]  When I take $1,000 out of the bank, they act suspicious and ask me what I'm doing. I get
[42:52.320 --> 42:56.200]  the big argument with them. It's none of your business. I mean, they won't even let Gerald
[42:56.200 --> 42:57.640]  Salente get 10,000 out.
[42:57.640 --> 43:02.040]  The idea that we're preventing terrorism, and we're running the terrorist operation.
[43:02.040 --> 43:07.580]  They get the law to know everything about your business and collect the data.
[43:07.580 --> 43:12.300]  So just like Fast and Furious was to be blamed on the Second Amendment to take that away,
[43:12.300 --> 43:16.300]  they give Al-Qaeda all these missiles, let them take out the Syrians, then we gotta take
[43:16.300 --> 43:18.880]  your rights cuz there's 10,000 heat-seeking missiles missing.
[43:18.880 --> 43:24.000]  Exactly, and we've gotta make sure that we clamp down on guns in America because look
[43:24.000 --> 43:25.000]  at the violent level.
[43:25.000 --> 43:30.200]  And now they're saying Homeland Security is now for guns, not for Al-Qaeda. It's for the
[43:30.200 --> 43:33.800]  gun owners, it's for the libertarians, it's for the conservatives, it's for the returning
[43:33.800 --> 43:34.800]  veterans.
[43:34.800 --> 43:39.600]  See, we're gonna be defined as anyone who doesn't go along with the agenda, anyone who
[43:39.600 --> 43:44.480]  objects, anyone who raises questions, immediately you're on the suspect list.
[43:44.480 --> 43:48.840]  How do we respond to that? Because again, I mean, you've been there at the highest levels
[43:48.840 --> 43:52.900]  of the system in banking and in consulting and everything. You've written books that
[43:52.900 --> 43:56.640]  brought down your major presidential candidates. You're a big insider. You don't say that,
[43:56.640 --> 44:00.100]  but let's just admit you are, Dr. Corsi, Jerome Corsi.
[44:00.100 --> 44:04.840]  Where are we going? Cuz I see this as a Vichy French sympathizer takeover where the foreign
[44:04.840 --> 44:10.080]  banks are like the Vichy French. The generals stand down, they turn America over to it,
[44:10.080 --> 44:11.920]  and that's what I see. I mean, they admit it.
[44:11.920 --> 44:17.500]  Well, first of all, Alex, you're doing a great job. And we at WND, we work with you, we support
[44:17.500 --> 44:22.760]  you, we think you're doing a great job. We're on the same team. The first job is you're
[44:22.760 --> 44:27.320]  exposing, you're calling the agenda and you're opening people's eyes.
[44:27.320 --> 44:29.600]  So what is the agenda? I mean, do you concur with my analysis?
[44:29.600 --> 44:34.300]  The agenda, absolutely. The agenda is complete domination of the American people. It's totalitarianism.
[44:34.300 --> 44:35.300]  This is the-
[44:35.300 --> 44:37.160]  And there's no doubt now. It's 100% naked.
[44:37.160 --> 44:41.760]  This is the left, it's most bald ever running to the finish line.
[44:41.760 --> 44:45.560]  I mean, yeah, I mean, every instinct I've got is get out of the country.
[44:45.560 --> 44:52.240]  They're saying, next we'll take your property. I mean, the whole agenda here, collectivism.
[44:52.240 --> 44:54.480]  You don't own that. The government-
[44:54.480 --> 44:55.480]  You didn't build that.
[44:55.480 --> 45:01.440]  We didn't build that. We own it. We need this to redistribute it. The whole plan of getting
[45:01.440 --> 45:02.440]  people out of their houses-
[45:02.440 --> 45:07.260]  Okay, well, I've studied the 1917 takeover, as you have. From everything I know, they're
[45:07.260 --> 45:11.080]  using that plan. And I'm not just saying that for theatrics, you've got the floor. I want
[45:11.080 --> 45:14.660]  you to break that down. From everything I'm seeing, they're planning to try to start a
[45:14.660 --> 45:16.880]  civil war and call him Lincoln.
[45:16.880 --> 45:24.400]  It is always the same plan. The plan is disarm the people. The plan is call the people the
[45:24.400 --> 45:30.160]  terrorists. Get information on the people. And then divide, find out which is the group.
[45:30.160 --> 45:34.360]  Is it gonna be the Jews? Who's it gonna be this time? There's a scapegoat group that
[45:34.360 --> 45:38.280]  has to be collected. It's gonna be the white militia.
[45:38.280 --> 45:39.280]  They're now saying that.
[45:39.280 --> 45:44.280]  It's gonna be anyone white who still believes in Jesus Christ and professes religious.
[45:44.280 --> 45:46.520]  Wow, they actually say that.
[45:46.520 --> 45:47.520]  Sure.
[45:47.520 --> 45:48.520]  No, it's in the manuals.
[45:48.520 --> 45:51.720]  This is the plan. These are the people that are gonna march-
[45:51.720 --> 45:56.720]  No, no, no, no. The peer's pressure thing article actually said, let them get ready.
[45:56.720 --> 46:02.360]  We're coming for you. And the communist Chinese are gonna help. That's Newsweek. It says Newsweek
[46:02.360 --> 46:05.280]  on the byline is saying they're that confident.
[46:05.280 --> 46:09.400]  Well, look, the whole plan of the United States being bankrupt. I just wrote a short book
[46:09.400 --> 46:13.800]  on the power pivot theory. That it's a plan to bankrupt the United States.
[46:13.800 --> 46:14.800]  Yeah.
[46:14.800 --> 46:19.320]  And with the Chinese owning as much of our debt as the Federal Reserve owns, they're
[46:19.320 --> 46:25.160]  one and two and competitors. China is saying already, we'll take equity instead of the
[46:25.160 --> 46:31.680]  debt. We'll manage your ports. We'll take land. We'll have occupation zones within the
[46:31.680 --> 46:34.440]  United States that we create as free trade zones.
[46:34.440 --> 46:41.840]  I wrote an article this week in WND where China is buying oil rights in the United States
[46:41.840 --> 46:47.080]  that George W. Bush prevented China from doing with the UNICAL deal saying it was a national
[46:47.080 --> 46:48.920]  security threat.
[46:48.920 --> 46:54.440]  Now today under Obama, China's signing left and right, oil and natural gas deals. Well,
[46:54.440 --> 46:56.960]  we're still dependent on foreign oil.
[46:56.960 --> 47:01.000]  He won't let us develop, does everything he can to block it, while giving huge swaths
[47:01.000 --> 47:02.000]  to the-
[47:02.000 --> 47:03.000]  China.
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.680]  China just bought the biggest oil fields in Texas, hundreds of thousands of different
[47:06.680 --> 47:10.080]  acres. I can drive 20 miles and show you Chinese owned areas.
[47:10.080 --> 47:14.600]  And China just made a big deal, bought one of the major companies in Canada, which owns
[47:14.600 --> 47:23.120]  rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, in US territory. China is going to own and operate those rigs.
[47:23.120 --> 47:30.040]  China is gonna be essentially producing oil out of resources while we're buying oil and
[47:30.040 --> 47:33.680]  natural gas, especially oil, on foreign markets.
[47:33.680 --> 47:38.720]  It makes no sense at all. Why are we buying foreign oil and letting the Chinese? Well,
[47:38.720 --> 47:40.640]  because again, the plan-
[47:40.640 --> 47:44.440]  That's why they gave them the Panama Canal. That's why they give them all the industry.
[47:44.440 --> 47:46.200]  That's why, I mean, this is so diabolical.
[47:46.200 --> 47:50.520]  Take a look at this little ebook I wrote. I wrote two ebooks, I think are very important.
[47:50.520 --> 47:56.440]  One is on Saul Alinsky, the evil genius behind Obama. And the second was on the coward pivot
[47:56.440 --> 48:02.200]  theory, which is the plan, Obama's plan to bankrupt the United States. That's what it's
[48:02.200 --> 48:03.200]  called.
[48:03.200 --> 48:09.200]  These two sociologists came up with the conclusion the only way to transform America into a socialist
[48:09.200 --> 48:15.040]  state was to bring it to its knees economically by overloading the welfare of the welfare
[48:15.040 --> 48:17.440]  state with obligations that could not be met.
[48:17.440 --> 48:22.800]  That's the plan. Look at the Daily Peace article. It says we need the Communist Chinese government
[48:22.800 --> 48:26.760]  to tell us what to do. This is globalism. We've got to get Americans ready to have our
[48:26.760 --> 48:30.000]  TV foreign owned like current TV.
[48:30.000 --> 48:34.800]  Somewhere Alex Jones is readying his flamethrower. Let him. And they go on to say we're gonna
[48:34.800 --> 48:40.920]  use the minorities and basically racial division and we're gonna use women. They're actually
[48:40.920 --> 48:45.880]  admitting what Rush Limbaugh finally said yesterday, they want a race war in this country.
[48:45.880 --> 48:53.640]  Look at how the campaign was run. Obama ran a race war campaign. Saul Alinsky, the rich
[48:53.640 --> 49:00.360]  are not paying their fair share. So you flame the economic resentment, get all the minorities
[49:00.360 --> 49:05.160]  to feel the white majority has stolen your money. They made you-
[49:05.160 --> 49:08.960]  And have Obama raise taxes on poor people, so they're hurting even worse.
[49:08.960 --> 49:11.640]  Well, and again, it's part of the plan to bankrupt everybody.
[49:11.640 --> 49:12.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[49:12.640 --> 49:18.760]  Because under the lie that he wasn't gonna raise taxes, he did raise taxes, 87% of the
[49:18.760 --> 49:19.760]  workers in the country.
[49:19.760 --> 49:22.280]  Yeah, exactly. It's so diabolical. It is so diabolical.
[49:22.280 --> 49:23.720]  Lying, lying, lying all the time.
[49:23.720 --> 49:27.720]  So how do we stop them? Because I mean, this is a real Soviet style takeover.
[49:27.720 --> 49:28.720]  Yes, in fact-
[49:28.720 --> 49:32.480]  John Brown just came out and said Obama only is faithful to the Soviet Constitution.
[49:32.480 --> 49:37.480]  In fact, go back and ask, what has Obama done for the African Americans? Look at the unemployment
[49:37.480 --> 49:39.880]  rate among African Americans. What has he done-
[49:39.880 --> 49:40.880]  They've been hurt the worst.
[49:40.880 --> 49:45.080]  The worst. Look, what has he done for the youth who have voted for him? Highest unemployment
[49:45.080 --> 49:51.040]  rate, the slimmest chances of jobs of any generation that we've ever had in America.
[49:51.040 --> 49:53.880]  These are the Obama zombies that in college-
[49:53.880 --> 49:58.000]  And he re-legalized US funding for basically forced abortions in China, where they give
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.280]  the women money if they get aborted.
[50:01.280 --> 50:06.640]  And kill the babies left and right, force women to have abortions in China. China, look,
[50:06.640 --> 50:11.120]  you go try to bring a Bible and profess the religion of Jesus Christ in China, you'll
[50:11.120 --> 50:12.840]  be in prison. China-
[50:12.840 --> 50:17.680]  But I mean, Doc, even though I know all this stuff we're going to break, I can't believe
[50:17.680 --> 50:18.680]  it's really happening.
[50:18.680 --> 50:23.560]  The Bank of China has had meetings with the United States government. The plan is set
[50:23.560 --> 50:28.840]  for China to transfer its debt into equity, own parts of the United States, manage-
[50:28.840 --> 50:29.840]  That's official.
[50:29.840 --> 50:31.400]  It's official. The meetings have happened.
[50:31.400 --> 50:34.280]  That's why they said in the People's Daily a month ago, you will take the guns.
[50:34.280 --> 50:35.640]  The meetings have happened.
[50:35.640 --> 50:38.120]  So they want the property, they know we're going to fight.
[50:38.120 --> 50:41.280]  And China wants to disarm the United States before this plan is implemented.
[50:41.280 --> 50:43.960]  We are being conquered by the globalists leveraging China.
[50:43.960 --> 50:47.520]  Absolutely. China wants us to have no weapons.
[50:47.520 --> 50:51.020]  I mean, this is so- and I want to talk about the military.
[50:51.020 --> 50:55.520]  It's a plan. The Howard Piven theory, Obama's plan to bankrupt-
[50:55.520 --> 51:00.720]  A Soviet globalist comming plan. We'll be back.
[51:00.720 --> 51:04.460]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer
[51:04.460 --> 51:09.200]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.
[51:09.200 --> 51:15.240]  Here's why. Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators,
[51:15.240 --> 51:20.320]  solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun. So when
[51:20.320 --> 51:23.480]  the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[51:23.480 --> 51:28.800]  Now here's the best part. Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't
[51:28.800 --> 51:34.520]  sell as new. We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily
[51:34.520 --> 51:39.080]  at the end of each year. We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like
[51:39.080 --> 51:44.760]  new. Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[51:44.760 --> 51:51.240]  Don't wait. They go fast. Go to scratchanddentsolar.com. That's scratchanddentsolar.com. For the craziest

[53:00.040 --> 53:04.960]  It's time for a home security quiz. Answer this. What effective home security device
[53:04.960 --> 53:09.280]  is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house
[53:09.280 --> 53:14.280]  while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments,
[53:14.280 --> 53:21.240]  and sells for less than $35? Yes, it's fake TV. This year, about one in every 50 US homes
[53:21.240 --> 53:26.000]  will have a break-in, with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that
[53:26.000 --> 53:31.040]  looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look
[53:31.040 --> 53:36.440]  like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp
[53:36.440 --> 53:42.040]  on a timer, but far more convincing. And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference
[53:42.040 --> 53:47.620]  between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to faketv.com or
[53:47.620 --> 54:00.840]  call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388, or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[54:00.840 --> 54:08.720]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[54:08.720 --> 54:12.240]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[54:12.240 --> 54:16.560]  Folks, the reason I keep talking about since yesterday, this Piers Pressure article that
[54:16.560 --> 54:21.160]  I came out January 21st, I didn't see till the 24th, is that I haven't had time to read
[54:21.160 --> 54:26.520]  it on air yet. And it says, yeah, we're getting rid of America, we're getting rid of sovereignty.
[54:26.520 --> 54:29.880]  We're going under globalization, new world order, and the gun owners are gonna have to
[54:29.880 --> 54:35.000]  turn their guns in. And the communist Chinese, thank God other governments are gonna help.
[54:35.000 --> 54:39.120]  I mean, it's everything I saw in the weatherman trials, going back and seeing the old footage
[54:39.120 --> 54:43.440]  where they plan to bring in the Chinese and all this. And it sounds crazy, here we are
[54:43.440 --> 54:48.000]  30, 40 years later, and they're really gonna try it. I mean, and I believe they're gonna
[54:48.000 --> 54:49.720]  fail, but there's gonna be a civil war.
[54:49.720 --> 54:54.520]  Ron Paul agreed last week with us on air. Countless others, every analyst I've talked
[54:54.520 --> 54:59.740]  to, let me ask you that, Dr. Corsi, best selling author here in studio with us. Hey, how are
[54:59.740 --> 55:04.680]  things going for them? They're teamed up with China, that much is clear. Do you think they're
[55:04.680 --> 55:07.440]  able to actually execute this?
[55:07.440 --> 55:12.680]  How do we defeat them? What is the timeframe? Well, first of all, exposing them is critical.
[55:12.680 --> 55:17.840]  What you're doing every day is critical. The timeframe is now, it's immediate. The plan
[55:17.840 --> 55:23.100]  to bankrupt America is ongoing today. Cloward Piven theory is in-
[55:23.100 --> 55:26.120]  22 billion to ship General Motors overseas.
[55:26.120 --> 55:31.760]  Not to read the Cloward Piven theory, I wrote it out in this little ebook. And it explains
[55:31.760 --> 55:37.120]  you bankrupt the United States by overloading welfare with demands that welfare can never
[55:37.120 --> 55:43.020]  meet, including Obamacare, including, wait, they'll take the student tuitions and forgive
[55:43.020 --> 55:44.020]  all those loans.
[55:44.020 --> 55:45.480]  It's all designed to bankrupt.
[55:45.480 --> 55:51.080]  All designed to bankrupt. China has had meetings, China wants assets. And see, the New World
[55:51.080 --> 55:56.640]  Order people say, well, China's the future. Why? Cuz China's communist, but they combine
[55:56.640 --> 55:59.520]  capitalism under communism and a model-
[55:59.520 --> 56:00.920]  And the elites are exempt.
[56:00.920 --> 56:06.360]  Then the elites are exempt. The elites get to lead a privileged life with weapons, go
[56:06.360 --> 56:11.040]  into any federal building. What do you find? You find armed guards, you go through metal
[56:11.040 --> 56:16.000]  detectors, all your property is searched. The federal government's gonna be well protected
[56:16.000 --> 56:17.960]  and they're gonna have weapons everywhere.
[56:17.960 --> 56:22.840]  And they're gonna take our weapons because China does not wanna take over the United
[56:22.840 --> 56:24.520]  States with an armed citizen.
[56:24.520 --> 56:29.040]  It's unbelievable. And they're planning to just have a slow motion red dawn with all
[56:29.040 --> 56:32.960]  the infra, and give China tax incentives, as they've announced, in these free trade
[56:32.960 --> 56:34.560]  zones where no one can compete.
[56:34.560 --> 56:40.440]  Look, I wrote about, you've even got Governor Perry back with Sintra rebuilding the parts
[56:40.440 --> 56:41.920]  of the trans Texas corridor.
[56:41.920 --> 56:43.000]  That was super highway.
[56:43.000 --> 56:46.960]  Super highways. They're coming back in with toll roads. They're under the radar. They
[56:46.960 --> 56:48.520]  signed something like $20 billion.
[56:48.520 --> 56:51.400]  Everything is bankrupt. How is it going for them?
[56:51.400 --> 56:56.400]  Done incrementally so you can't see that it's happening in little pieces. It's going well.
[56:56.400 --> 57:02.840]  I mean, Obama reelected, they've got a socialist agenda set out. They got the Republicans on
[57:02.840 --> 57:08.240]  the run. What's gonna stop them is the Second Amendment and the American people finally
[57:08.240 --> 57:10.280]  waking up and saying no.
[57:10.280 --> 57:15.680]  And Alex, you're playing a big role in this. Every day getting the information, we at WND,
[57:15.680 --> 57:19.800]  every day getting the information in front of the people, the truth. Look, I just wrote
[57:19.800 --> 57:26.360]  about the fact of oil. We are selling to the Chinese oil rights throughout the United States.
[57:26.360 --> 57:27.360]  For nothing.
[57:27.360 --> 57:32.280]  For nothing. And George W Bush would not, remember, UNICAL was gonna be taken over by
[57:32.280 --> 57:33.280]  I think 2005.
[57:33.280 --> 57:36.120]  And that's what government land is all about, so they can just give it away.
[57:36.120 --> 57:37.120]  They can give it away.
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.320]  I remember 15 years ago reading about the UN World Heritage sites where they admitted
[57:41.320 --> 57:45.300]  the buffer zones, hundreds of thousands of square miles around it, was being pledged
[57:45.300 --> 57:47.680]  to the national debt. And who owns the debt?
[57:47.680 --> 57:49.240]  China wants to manage the ports.
[57:49.240 --> 57:50.240]  China.
[57:50.240 --> 57:54.000]  China wants to manage the ports. They're managing the ports right now.
[57:54.000 --> 57:58.680]  No, that's the deal. We'll use your dollars for slave goods our slaves make with suicide
[57:58.680 --> 58:04.160]  nets around the factories. But you give us the Long Beach and the Panama Canal and the
[58:04.160 --> 58:05.720]  infrastructure and the oil.
[58:05.720 --> 58:08.720]  The Panama Canal, China is. They're managing the zone.
[58:08.720 --> 58:09.720]  Everything, everything.
[58:09.720 --> 58:15.940]  Tanzania. They're ready to manage Los Angeles. And they want free trade zones in the United
[58:15.940 --> 58:18.880]  States where communist Chinese can come in and set up business.
[58:18.880 --> 58:19.880]  This is a takeover.
[58:19.880 --> 58:25.760]  It's a takeover. It's a step-by-step takeover. And it's happening. And our debt is giving
[58:25.760 --> 58:29.240]  China the leverage they need to demand assets.
[58:29.240 --> 58:33.240]  And in the global issues, our military, what's left of it, has the leverage point to keep
[58:33.240 --> 58:34.840]  the commie Chinese in line.
[58:34.840 --> 58:37.360]  We don't have to have a military. China has one.
[58:37.360 --> 58:43.320]  We'll be right back.

[58:55.660 --> 59:00.240]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[59:00.240 --> 59:05.200]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:33.200]  Big things afoot here in Texas. You know, Dr. Corsi, I'm noticing there's like a gathering
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.000]  in Texas. It's also happening in other states like New Hampshire, but everybody is really
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.640]  moving to Texas and the globalists see Texas as the resistance to their new world order
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.600]  takeover. And I know they've got to get the guns, but I think as the founders said, you
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:49.840]  won't need the Second Amendment until they try to take it. As Thomas Jefferson said,
[01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:54.480]  elaborate on what you mean by the Second Amendment is going to save us. And you were telling
[01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:57.880]  me during the break, people are finally starting to get it. This has been great banter we're
[01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.880]  having.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.840]  Well, I think, first of all, the broadcast you're doing, at WND, getting the word out.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:07.500]  People are understanding that, oh, it's a conspiracy theory. It's not a conspiracy.
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:12.880]  It's a conscious plan to bankrupt the United States, conscious plan to take away our freedoms.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:18.760]  You get the Patriot Act coming in after 9-11. You get now the, you know, terrorism is expanding,
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:24.160]  so we've got to be able to take guns away, school killings. All these fear elements end
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:30.440]  up in taking fundamental rights from the American people while we're being indebted to China.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:36.360]  And China wants the assets. The new world order people, communist socialists, say China's
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:41.600]  the future cuz China is communist, but they've figured out, you know, the Obama people-
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.080]  Well, they're really just slave masters.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.480]  Capitalism, they're slave masters.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.840]  Yeah, yeah, communism for the slaves, palaces for the controllers.
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.720]  I mean, you know, Obama gets, you know, multimillion dollar vacations.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.400]  $10 million vacations, red carpets, they're the new Hollywood.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.680]  And celebrities, and, you know, so does Nancy Pelosi. You go into a federal building, you're
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:05.360]  gonna have to go through a metal detector. Your property is gonna be looked at. They're
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:10.200]  all gonna be protected, the federal government, by guns and weapons. And by the way, they're
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:14.320]  not part of Obamacare. Nobody in the Senate and the House is part of Obamacare. Nobody
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:18.280]  in the Senate and the House will be part of any gun restrictions. When China comes in-
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:19.280]  Unbelievable.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.280]  China comes in-
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.280]  Unbelievable.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:26.160]  And the Trans-Texas Corridor was the first salvo in this. And out of it, look, China
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:31.120]  is still managing the Panama Canal. They're managing these ports in Mexico like Lazaro
[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:36.960]  Cardenas in Manzanilla. China wants ports. The Bank of China has met with the federal
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:43.600]  government. They've said, we want assets now for our debt. We'll get it. And the coward
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:49.280]  pivot theory drives this. Because the coward pivot, two sociologists who had a plan, they
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:57.160]  bankrupt New York in the 70s with this idea, overloading welfare. So capitalism crashes.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:01.840]  You blame capitalism. You reconstruct socialism. Let the Chinese come in and show us how to
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:07.100]  do it. The Chinese understand capitalism the way it works. And we're just being prepared
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.100]  for it.
[01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:15.040]  The discussion today in the Senate about guns is to sensitize people. Remember, same sex
[01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:20.960]  marriage. 20 years ago, people were offended. Now everybody's desensitized. The same with
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:28.120]  a gun takeover. You introduce the idea. You show Newton, all these school. You wanna protect
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.940]  the schools, put armed guards in them. That's what they do in the federal buildings. It
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:32.940]  works for the federal.
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:39.700]  Federal buildings are not no gun zones. The federal troops have federal officers in every
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.700]  House and Senate-
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.640]  But how do you beat it when they've got all the illegal aliens voting and everything?
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:48.560]  What they don't have is you've got the people of the United States, those left in America
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:51.600]  who understand that the founding fathers created-
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:55.840]  We have to get aggressive and realize how much trouble we're in and go after them politically,
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:58.040]  legally. People have got to make this a full-time deal.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:59.040]  And take it seriously.
[01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:00.040]  Yeah, this isn't a joke.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:06.680]  It's not a joke. I mean, this is now when pre-prepared, all these, the census data,
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.200]  the data about filling out all this-
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.960]  The smart meters watching everything you're doing.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:13.560]  They're collecting data right now to know where everything is. So when they come to
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.720]  get the guns, they all say, well, give us the one you got in that closet. You registered
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:22.680]  it. We know you've got it. Hand it over. You know, this is where the information-
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:26.120]  And they know when people fight back, then it'll be, oh, there's a new terrorist threat.
[01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:30.360]  All we want to do is register the guns. What's wrong with that? Well, as soon as you've registered-
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.360]  Then they take them.
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:32.360]  They know where they are.
[01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:35.240]  They go, but you can keep your bolt action. Now Australia is banning bolt action.
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:39.200]  Well, and again, what's an assault rifle? Well, the assault rifle is going to be anything
[01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:40.360]  they decide is an assault rifle.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.800]  That's why they're now saying, oh, it's handguns too we're going to ban.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:47.440]  Anything you want is an assault rifle. And again, the Second Amendment was designed for
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:50.200]  this very situation for people to stay there.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.280]  We got to talk about what the Second Amendment was designed for with Dr. Jerome Corsi coming
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:05:01.040]  up, and then we'll get into all the other huge issues taking place right now.

[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:21.820]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:29.660]  Again, it's Friday, the 25th day of January, 2013. We've got Dr. Jerome Corsi here with
[01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:34.540]  us for another 25 minutes or so and then he's got to leave and get on an airplane. Again,
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:39.820]  he is a Ph.D. from Harvard University in political science. I work with the State Department
[01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:43.980]  and other agencies in highly classified areas as a consultant and of course has written
[01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:50.140]  five New York Times bestselling non-fiction books, many of them number one and he writes
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:53.220]  for World Net Daily and he's got a bunch of ebooks out right now.
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:57.540]  And yes, there are a lot of different sociologists and that's how communists operate during the
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:02.820]  infiltration phase because they want to bankrupt things, then blame free market and they get
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:07.300]  so many dependent they can take over. Now, Doc, we've had great banner, everybody's saying
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:14.580]  powerful radio earlier, but I want to be able to now just sit back and have you recap everything
[01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:20.100]  you've said that this is the global mega banks, anti-free market with the socialists and the
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:21.100]  communists.
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:26.180]  To recap last hour, leveraging with the communist Chinese using limited capitalism where they
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:31.300]  exempt themselves from the rules, basically modern slavery to take over and how we beat
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:35.180]  them and what we're facing and how they use the drugs, how the big banks are behind that.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.300]  You wanted to talk about that. I'm going to just sit back now. You've got the floor.
[01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:41.900]  I mean, there's so many. First of all, I want to start out with the Second Amendment. I
[01:09:41.900 --> 01:09:45.700]  want to say this about the Second Amendment. Second Amendment was written for a time like
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:51.260]  this. It was written for a time, you know, Revolutionary War was when the British were
[01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.580]  taking everything over, British making a final play to dominate the colonies.
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:10:01.340]  And the militias then at that point, people being armed were critical. An armed public
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:06.900]  today, Second Amendment is a powerful tool. It's why it's being attacked. It's critical
[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:12.300]  to maintain. Now, the next thing I want to say is, look, and Alex, we are the drug cartels,
[01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:18.140]  the government of the United States. You got the NSA, which is reading everybody's emails.
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:24.380]  Now, you mean to say, and I showed and published with John Cruz, the whistleblower, the information
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:30.780]  about HSBC money laundering, money coming from the drug cartels. That has to happen
[01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:37.940]  with the US government knowing about it. You mean Treasury, Federal Reserve, NSA, CIA didn't
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:44.580]  know that Mexican drug launderers were driving into Tijuana with a truckload of $100 bills
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:49.620]  sitting in the high net worth area, drinking espresso while that's being processed into
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:55.160]  the bank and shoveled all over the world on behalf of the drug cartels.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.220]  We facilitated that. I've talked to the Air Force and Army officers who sit there with
[01:10:59.220 --> 01:11:03.700]  the surveillance blimps and the aircraft, and they're told let that through, let that,
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:08.180]  stop that. Why do we have more heroin coming out of Afghanistan
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:15.940]  today than when the Taliban ran Afghanistan? Again, we are the drug cartels. We are the
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:21.260]  gun runners of the world. Fast and Furious was just the tip of the iceberg. You mean
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:26.580]  guns are being run worldwide and the NSA and the CIA doesn't know what's happening and
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:32.460]  can't catch anybody. It's nonsense. Drug cartels penetrating into the United States. You mean
[01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:36.660]  we're able to sell billions of dollars, I'd say the drug business may be a trillion dollar
[01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.660]  business-
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.660]  It is.
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:44.500]  To drug addicts in the streets of Colorado and every other city of America, and the CIA
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.500]  and the FBI can't find them?
[01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:52.100]  Well, I mean, Wells Fargo with Warren Buffett got caught laundering $378 million two years
[01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:53.780]  ago with Wachovia.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:58.020]  The major profits I think today being made in the banking system worldwide come from
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:03.540]  money laundering. The money laundering laws that are out there are not to catch the drug
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:04.540]  cartel.
[01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.540]  They're to harass us.
[01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:09.360]  They basically permit the federal government to track everything you're doing in the bank
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:15.660]  where your money is. Make sure you're not using any cash. The catch who's being caught
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:20.020]  with the Patriot Act are legitimate citizens who just do one or two things wrong.
[01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:25.380]  No, no, no, I know someone in Texas who has a successful business, no criminal record,
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:30.580]  and over two decades had saved up a couple $100,000 in cash, went to put it back in the
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:31.580]  bank-
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:32.580]  They'll be harassed.
[01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.580]  Or was arrested.
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:38.220]  Yeah, right, exactly. And see, but yet you come into Tijuana with a truckload $100 bills,
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:43.140]  hey, you're a preferred customer. And that money is gonna pass right through the entire
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:48.740]  system, gonna come through banks. HSBC was money laundering in Long Island.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:54.300]  We had the data stealing people's social security numbers, creating false accounts, running
[01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:59.860]  millions of dollars through these false accounts, closing the accounts. So there was no trace
[01:12:59.860 --> 01:13:05.020]  of them. We turned the information, John Cruz, the whistleblower, I wrote about it in WND.
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:10.220]  We went into the Department of Homeland Security in New York, turned over this information,
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:12.460]  turned it over to the Congress.
[01:13:12.460 --> 01:13:17.420]  And nobody was doing anything until we started publicizing it, writing the articles about
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:26.100]  it, exposing it. I've exposed HSBC in India, all around the world, HSBC is a criminal bank.
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:31.260]  It's engaging in these activities. And if HSBC wants to sue me, hey, I'll save them
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.260]  the problem.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:35.200]  But I mean, wait a minute, it's in the news. It's in the news that all the big Federal
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:37.700]  Reserve member banks and others have been caught.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:42.020]  Laundering money. They are laundering, it's the only way the drug business-
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.540]  That's why they keep it illegal to keep the price up.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.420]  You can't have a drug business if the governments don't cooperate.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:49.420]  Now doctor-
[01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:55.780]  It's the same with the guns. The guns are the same. The federal government wants a monopoly
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:59.880]  on the weapons so that they can put the weapons where they want them.
[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.320]  And selectively arrest us.
[01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:04.860]  And selectively arrest us if we dare have any. But they'll be happy to get them in the
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:08.540]  hands of Al-Qaeda. Where does Al-Qaeda get the weapons?
[01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.540]  Missiles.
[01:14:09.540 --> 01:14:12.440]  Let's track the weapons that were used in Mali. Let's track the weapons that are used
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.660]  in Syria. And find out they track right back to the state department.
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:19.100]  Now let me bring this up since you said that. People always in the mainstream media spin
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:23.620]  it. That I'm saying, and this is a quote of Chris Matthews, that Bush was at the towers
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:24.620]  with a plunger.
[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:28.380]  Bush is a teleprompter reading puppet like Obama to many levels. Though Obama and more
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:31.820]  and more we're learning is actually enjoying what's happening and in there running some
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:32.820]  of the things.
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:38.820]  I've always said criminal globalist elements are financing and using Al-Qaeda as a pretext
[01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:43.460]  to menace us into slavery. And as a pretext to bring in a police state and look at the
[01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:47.420]  homeland documents. It's all about returning veterans gun owners. I mean, don't I get an
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:51.220]  apology from the national conservatives out there who spun it?
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:53.700]  That I was saying the whole government was doing 9-11?
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:59.100]  I would say forget about it. The issue is that you're right in tracking the information
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:02.340]  and getting it out. This is, apologies whether you'll ever get-
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:06.120]  Sure, sure, I don't even want that. My point is, is I'm saying there's a criminal globalist
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.260]  element in the government using Al-Qaeda.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:13.820]  We have a criminal government. Our government is running drugs, permitting it to happen
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:15.540]  and running guns.
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.540]  And running Al-Qaeda.
[01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:21.740]  And running Al-Qaeda. We are the drug cartels. We are Al-Qaeda. This is a fundamental-
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:26.020]  You know 100 miles into the Texas border, all over the state, anywhere I have to go,
[01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:28.500]  they have border patrol checkpoints. And when I pull up now and they go, I want to search
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:31.860]  your car, I go, you know the government ships the drugs. And they go, all right, you can
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.760]  go. I mean, they all know it.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:39.540]  And look, Al-Qaeda right now, we have a group of expatriates out of Libya. They've been
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:43.900]  sending us information. Al-Qaeda has taken over Libya.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.580]  They fly the flags there.
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:51.100]  And they are, in fact, raging a tribal war where they're killing other tribes that were
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:56.460]  favorable to Qaddafi. We're not saying, we've got to use this doctrine to protect people
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:57.460]  as the UN go in.
[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:59.180]  Well, they're ethically closing the blacks.
[01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:04.660]  Because as long as Al-Qaeda is killing people, our government's gonna stand down. I mean,
[01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:10.420]  the whole Arab Spring was a takeover by the Muslim Brotherhood of all these countries,
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:11.420]  one after the other.
[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:12.820]  So where's it all going? How do we beat this?
[01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:18.040]  Well, again, exposing it is fundamental. People waking up and understanding that we've got
[01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.540]  a criminal government. It demands investigation. When you were calling for investigations,
[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:26.620]  Alex, you need to have you on the investigating committee.
[01:16:26.620 --> 01:16:33.460]  Get some Warren Commission that you get the State Department and the Justice Department
[01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:38.380]  saying for the first 24 hours, we gotta make sure Lee Harvey Oswald's found as the culprit.
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:44.300]  Paper over it. Put the critics on the investigating committees, give them the power, and let's
[01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.540]  prosecute the federal officials.
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:51.820]  How about Nancy Pelosi? How about Barack Obama? In terms of criminal activity-
[01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:56.660]  Rand Paul said bare minimum, Hillary should have to step down. Obviously, the White House
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:57.660]  has been caught lying.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:02.940]  Quit lying. I wanna know, for the eight hours this embassy was under attack and we had drones
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:05.460]  there, do they sit and watch it in the State Department House?
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:06.460]  Of course they did.
[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:12.780]  Do they go to bed and let our people die in the field over there? While in fact, we had
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:17.300]  Al-Qaeda attacking and we were running drugs. We'd rather have those ambassadors die than
[01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:22.380]  admit they were there with guns that were run, that was a cache of guns that were illegally
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:26.980]  brought into the United States by the United States headed to Syria.
[01:17:26.980 --> 01:17:32.980]  If they didn't die, we were gonna expose our own gun running. So the White House and over
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:38.340]  in Pentagon and CIA, they watched them die rather than call in military-
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:41.580]  And ordered the CIA torture base down the road to not help.
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:47.900]  And stand down. Some of the, I believe at least two of them, the government official,
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:53.180]  the military that were there dying in Benghazi, basically violated orders and went in.
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.660]  That's right, yeah, the Navy SEALs-
[01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:59.580]  Navy SEALs violated orders, they weren't gonna stand for this. They were there begging for
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:06.420]  help. They were calling in trajectories, giving target locations. Well, that was because the
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:08.140]  drones around there had to be armed.
[01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:13.300]  For eight hours, you had up to 500 people with anti-aircraft guns cranked down to the
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:15.380]  ground, firing into the building.
[01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:21.260]  What does Obama and Hillary come? They say, it's because of a movie. Again, using the
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:27.260]  incident to try to quash free speech. They were insulted over this movie.
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:29.660]  Well, they recycle everything they do to attack freedom.
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:34.580]  Attack freedom, it's all back on attack the United States citizens. Take the guns away,
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:38.660]  take the First Amendment away, and use any incident that happens.
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:42.540]  Let me ask you this, if we don't stop them studying this worldwide, reading their own
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:47.500]  white papers, their own sociologists, where does it go if we don't stop them?
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:52.860]  If it doesn't stop them, we might as well read Nazi Germany again, cuz we're gonna be
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.860]  the victims in another Nazi Germany. There's gonna be no place to go.
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:56.860]  These are authoritarians.
[01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:01.420]  Yeah, and let's let Congress know that if Congress doesn't listen, everybody in Congress,
[01:19:01.420 --> 01:19:03.900]  we vote out. Anybody who's there, we just vote out.
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:07.220]  It's time to be freaking out. I mean, this is openly-
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:13.300]  And demand hearings, demand investigations, press the information. Every day, Alex, when
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:18.100]  you're out there, showing people what's really in the news, your audience, what we're doing
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:22.600]  at WND, this is an extremely important function.
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:27.740]  Get the truth, the trans-Texas corridor, when people realize that they were gonna take four
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:33.060]  football fields wide to Texas, and give it to Spain to develop as high-
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.620]  That's globalism.
[01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:40.060]  And finally, Texans came out of these meetings, they told Rick Perry and the Texas Department
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.540]  of Transportation, they could shove this plant.
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.860]  But six years later, like a roach, he creeps back.
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:48.940]  Come back, it's constant vigilance. Jefferson was right, constant-
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:51.540]  And anyone who approaches the jewel is an enemy.
[01:19:51.540 --> 01:19:54.020]  And they will target us as the enemy.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:57.220]  That's fine, we're committed, we're going all the way. We'll be back with a final segment
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:01.020]  to talk about the new royalty. Stay with us.
[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:05.860]  Coming back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:10.460]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought, to the family hardships brought on
[01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:15.020]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:18.820]  At e Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:21.740]  life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:26.300]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:31.100]  are closed, but I managed to get my e Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:32.100]  and niece.
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:35.900]  It is better to be prepared ten years too early than one day too late.
[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:38.020]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:20:38.020 --> 01:20:40.340]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.180]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:09.260]  Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[01:21:09.260 --> 01:21:11.020]  This is really scary stuff.
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:16.260]  Defense experts warn that this odd device poses the greatest threat we've ever known.
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:20.580]  In fact, just a few weeks ago, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:24.220]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat.
[01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:27.100]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:30.980]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:36.660]  That's why my friend just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:39.460]  and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:45.300]  Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover exactly what it is plus

[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:55.820]  forever.

[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:29.240]  It's like a salon in a bottle.
[01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:33.460]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:22:33.460 --> 01:22:37.680]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:38.680]  to service debt.
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:42.200]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.580]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.580]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.780]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:57.820]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:03.180]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:04.180]  Box.
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:07.140]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:11.940]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:16.260]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:16.260 --> 01:23:21.840]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:26.900]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of super bugs with 17 naturally
[01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:32.060]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:23:32.060 --> 01:23:33.180]  normal cell.
[01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:36.860]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:23:36.860 --> 01:23:40.940]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:48.860]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[01:23:48.860 --> 01:23:56.220]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:57.220]  Protect your immune system.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:58.220]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:14.580]  Final segment with Dr. Jerome Corsi, he's got a big book coming out in a couple of months
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:19.940]  exposing just the death panels that didn't exist and that they now are saying are so
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:20.940]  great.
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:26.260]  It is just unspeakable how evil these authoritarians are and it's not authoritarianism for domination
[01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:28.740]  because they have some grand plan to help people.
[01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:31.580]  The globalists, I've studied them, really hate humanity.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:35.260]  They're very unhappy, nasty people, but you mentioned something earlier I wanted to flesh
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:36.260]  out here.
[01:24:36.260 --> 01:24:43.140]  Here's the weekly standard and it is in the new bill, Feinstein Gun Control Bill to Exempt
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.140]  Government Officials.
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:50.740]  And I have the Huffington Post here with one of the police patrolman associations in New
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:54.600]  York saying, well, we need guns to protect ourselves from criminals.
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:25:00.580]  So the police now under this federal bill are saying, well, we're gonna take all of
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:04.100]  your guns, but we'll still be able to have guns to protect ourselves cuz criminals won't
[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:05.500]  follow laws.
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.140]  This is new titles of nobility.
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:12.760]  This is what our founders fought because the police and all former feds, just like you
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:15.700]  said earlier, Congress exempts itself from Obamacare.
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.700]  Exactly.
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:19.220]  I mean, that is so discriminatory.
[01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.680]  Obama gets to have all the vacations he wants, travel anywhere he wants to go.
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.060]  Look at how Nancy Pelosi flies around.
[01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:28.320]  This is all, they have their own health system in Congress.
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:33.000]  They have their own lifestyle, their own parking lot, their own restaurants.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.380]  It's a scenic cure for life, pensions forever if you're in for one term.
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:42.840]  You know, look, Alex, this entire plan, the entire attack on God, that's what my new book
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.660]  is on, the ACLU.
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:48.220]  It's on the plan to remove God, it's called the Bad Samaritan.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:51.700]  Gloria Steinem wears shirts saying, I got an abortion, it's beautiful.
[01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:53.340]  We're celebrating abortions.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:58.200]  Now the next thing, if we're celebrating abortions, the next plan will be to celebrate the killing
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.200]  of the old.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:00.980]  You must not watch a mainline new TV.
[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:06.020]  No, no, no, the sexy thing is to talk about how ugly old people are and how great it is
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.020]  to kill them.
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.020]  Right, because they're useless.
[01:26:08.020 --> 01:26:11.660]  They're just wasted, they're old, they can't do anything, they can't contribute, kill them.
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:17.580]  But at the same time, all the groups that are supporting Obama, all the leftist-oriented
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:21.160]  groups, the minorities, are being used as dupes.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.520]  Nothing is in return to them.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:23.520]  Go into the-
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:24.520]  Obama won't even go talk to them.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.820]  Remember what Maxine Waters said.
[01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.740]  Go to the African-American communities, look at the highest unemployment.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:32.980]  Look at the biggest crime and drug use, dropouts from schools-
[01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:33.980]  Exploding.
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:34.980]  Families.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:37.420]  What is any federal government doing to, you know, the-
[01:26:37.420 --> 01:26:40.380]  Chicago, where the dawn runs, thanks.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.020]  Go into Detroit.
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:46.280]  Take a look at the comparison, it's circulating in the Internet, between Detroit and Hiroshima
[01:26:46.280 --> 01:26:47.820]  at the end of World War II.
[01:26:47.820 --> 01:26:52.660]  Hiroshima is a thriving community, Detroit, under socialism, is devastated.
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:55.820]  That's the future of America under socialism, Detroit.
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:56.820]  Go look at it.
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:02.860]  No jobs, the jobs to China, everybody in poverty, everybody facing either go into the drug-
[01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:06.980]  And when I say to socialists that are mid-level and really mean well, they go, everything's
[01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:10.980]  gonna collapse, austerity, you wanna kill old people, and meanwhile it's the eugenicists
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:12.980]  saying they're gonna kill the old people.
[01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:17.020]  And my book, this whole thing, gotta look at the Cloward Piven theory.
[01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:25.260]  The plan is to so bankrupt the United States with new entitlement programs, Obamacare,
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:29.740]  you've got, you know, all the food stamps you want, well, they'll roll out entitlement
[01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:35.020]  after entitlement, because the idea is we'll never be able to pay for them, we'll be bankrupt,
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:38.980]  and the collapse of the United States, they'll blame capitalism, then they'll open the door
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:42.300]  for the Chinese, the Chinese will own the debt, and the socialists-
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:43.300]  They already do.
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.580]  The Chinese know how to run capitalism, we'll just use the Chinese system.
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:49.140]  Constitution's an old document, we've already had the Georgia-
[01:27:49.140 --> 01:27:54.940]  They're already saying that in the Piers Pressure article, do one on this.
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:28:00.220]  This article says we need to do what the communist Chinese say, read it, and then I'll be dealt
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:01.220]  with.
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:04.940]  And that's gonna be for everybody right here.
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:07.660]  Actually, did you see Piers Morgan say he wants to shoot me?
[01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:10.500]  Yes, I saw that, I saw the entire series-
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:13.180]  Have you been around the so-called liberals privately where all they were talking about
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:14.180]  is killing people?
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:19.940]  Look, the whole agenda is a death agenda, it's killing babies, how are we gonna celebrate
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:20.940]  killing babies?
[01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:21.940]  Killing old people.
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:22.940]  Killing old people.
[01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:26.060]  How could the free market pay for everybody, and now socialism, nothing can be paid for?
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:31.460]  In fact, look, people don't understand, this is not an economic downturn we're in.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:37.380]  This is a created, manipulated, structural unemployment, where even if the economy improves,
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:38.900]  the jobs created are in China.
[01:28:38.900 --> 01:28:41.460]  They've doubled the food stamps, that's on goal.
[01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:44.660]  They've had increasing dependency on the federal government.
[01:28:44.660 --> 01:28:48.140]  And they're saying, and they've even got Rand Paul going, we've gotta adapt or die, that's
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:52.420]  psy-op to make the Republican Party just the right wing of the left.
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:55.060]  The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are essentially one party.
[01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:56.060]  It's a psy-op.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:28:57.060]  It's one party.
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:28:58.580]  People are rejecting socialism.
[01:28:58.580 --> 01:29:01.460]  And people have gotta continue to reject socialism.
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:04.820]  People have gotta start taking strong measures, demanding-
[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:05.860]  And it's time to start-
[01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.860]  Federal investigations.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:09.940]  I agree, but isn't it start to not complying as well?
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:13.660]  It's also, first of all, the Second Amendment is fundamental.
[01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:15.940]  People have got to retain their guns.
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:19.940]  The Second Amendment was created for times when tyranny is on the run.
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:20.940]  And it's here.
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:21.940]  It's here.
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:22.940]  And it's here, and it's on the move.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:25.600]  You know, our founders are fighting for us from the grave.
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:30.140]  And we've gotta listen, because the words that they gave us, the instructions and the
[01:29:30.140 --> 01:29:32.220]  tools are right there.
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:36.260]  First Amendment, Second Amendment, and we've gotta demand the federal government as a criminal
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:38.460]  government running drug cartels-
[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:41.580]  Tell you what, come back and do five more minutes with us in the big announcement.
[01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:44.660]  I want you to finish up plans to turn this around.
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:50.060]  Okay, fantastic, here we go.
[01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.340]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.340 --> 01:29:53.740]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.740 --> 01:30:02.380]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:07.060]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[01:30:07.060 --> 01:30:09.100]  immunity and health.
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:13.700]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of

[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:35.620]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and
[01:30:35.620 --> 01:30:40.780]  leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:45.340]  natural skin-nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:49.340]  skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:06.440]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:11.020]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:12.900]  by a disastrous economy?

[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.780]  At eFoods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather life's
[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:22.060]  storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:26.860]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:31.660]  are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time to be able to help my sister
[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:32.660]  and niece.
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:36.460]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:38.700]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:41.060]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:04.260]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:09.500]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:32:09.500 --> 01:32:15.540]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:16.540]  to the global takeover.
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:22.420]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:26.140]  These are items that I did research on that I personally use.
[01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:31.140]  You've got the LifeStraw so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:35.900]  The Ktor Handcrank Generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out
[01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:36.900]  in the field.
[01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:39.940]  Strategic Relocation, third edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:42.380]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:47.140]  TheraSafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:50.160]  Handcrank shortwave AM-FM radios.

[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:09.700]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.740]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:18.340]  Here's a surprise, tyrants.
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:19.340]  We can see you.
[01:33:19.340 --> 01:33:25.860]  We can see for miles and miles and miles and we know your playbook.
[01:33:25.860 --> 01:33:30.460]  We've been warning people for decades and now that we're coming down to the wire, people
[01:33:30.460 --> 01:33:37.780]  are going, wait, Ron Paul, Dr. Corsi, Alex Jones, G. Edward Griffin, countless others,
[01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:41.220]  Bob Chapman, the list goes on and on, Lou Rockwell.
[01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:45.820]  They all warned us about this and exactly what they said is now happening.
[01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:49.060]  They told us 10 years ago the smart meters were going to hook into all our electronics
[01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:52.780]  and track us in taxes and surveillance and the government said it was a conspiracy theory
[01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:53.780]  but now it's admitted.
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:57.900]  Well, wait, Alex said the NSA was spying on us 10 years ago without warrants, non-terror
[01:33:57.900 --> 01:33:58.900]  related.
[01:33:58.900 --> 01:33:59.900]  Now they admit it.
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:02.380]  Alex said that it was really for the American people, Homeland Security.
[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:03.380]  Now it's admitted.
[01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:06.140]  Again, it's all happening.
[01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:09.900]  We've got a chance to beat these people if you realize they're really bad people.
[01:34:09.900 --> 01:34:14.100]  They're not misguided liberals, environmental wackos.
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:17.500]  I wish Rush Limbaugh would stop saying they're idiot wackos.
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:20.940]  These are, cuz I've been in hundreds of their events and they always come over when the
[01:34:20.940 --> 01:34:24.580]  cameras off and punch you in the arm or grab your shirt and say I'm gonna get you.
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:25.660]  One day we're gonna get you.
[01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.340]  I'm sure that's happened to you, Dr. Corsi.
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:30.580]  In closing, we've got some huge news coming up after you go.
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:34.100]  Kissinger predicts nuclear war with Iran, infowars.com.
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:38.040]  Holder begins gun control push trying to raise money for the Democratic Party on the back
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:43.020]  of it, fireside chats, assault weapon ban lacks Democratic votes to pass Senate.
[01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:45.380]  Don't think they won't have another shooting, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:47.620]  Now that is just some of the stuff we've got here.
[01:34:47.620 --> 01:34:52.380]  We're gonna make the big announcement on the $115,000 biggest contest ever after he leaves
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:54.100]  his operation, Paul Revere.
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:35:00.000]  That's going live with a red link right now at infowars.com and we'll post it to prisonplanet.com
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.260]  as a backup.
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:03.940]  But doctor, we've had great banner for the last hour.
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:08.100]  Other points you wanna add about solutions, I just wanna first get your take on this.
[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:13.740]  Look, if this is real, I mean, you're more steeled than ever knowing it's real.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:15.020]  We've talked privately.
[01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:18.900]  It's now all manifesting, our worst analysis being proven right.
[01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:21.620]  Again, people better take this serious.
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:23.700]  What can you say to police and military?
[01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:28.100]  I'm talking to police and military, and they're either totally waking up, and the majority
[01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:31.180]  of them are, or they're deciding to just sign on to evil.
[01:35:31.180 --> 01:35:32.900]  How will the system deal with that?
[01:35:32.900 --> 01:35:38.000]  Well, the police and the military have got to the oath keepers, the whole plan to reach
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:43.300]  out and say, look, because the new world order will turn on the police as well.
[01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:44.300]  They always do.
[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:48.060]  But if they don't sign on, they'll be equally victims in this.
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:50.860]  But again, Alex, it's a plan.
[01:35:50.860 --> 01:35:52.900]  The Obama plan to bankrupt America.
[01:35:52.900 --> 01:35:53.900]  Your book.
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:58.300]  That's what I've been pushing that people to read, you understand that once we are indebted
[01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:01.740]  to China, we can't tell China to stay out.
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:07.820]  Once you've sold current TV to Al Jazeera, Al Jazeera owns the airwaves.
[01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:10.340]  That's globalism, have foreigners come in and buy everything.
[01:36:10.340 --> 01:36:12.740]  And I wrote a book America for sale.
[01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:17.780]  I warn people, you're gonna be reduced down to living in the safe places where you can
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:22.860]  find to live, burying your guns, having food to live, and even that's not safe.
[01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:23.860]  How long are you gonna last?
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:25.580]  No, they know we've got the food.
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:28.740]  But people can understand what you've been saying is true.
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.660]  Fast and Furious occurred from the top.
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:37.920]  It was a administration concocted plan by Eric Holder to take the guns away, to attack
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:38.920]  the Second Amendment.
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:45.660]  They have these guns show up at events, killings and murders and say, look, the guns are being
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:46.660]  sold.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:47.660]  That came out in the memos.
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:49.660]  It was out and he tried to get the truth.
[01:36:49.660 --> 01:36:51.500]  The memos won't be released.
[01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:57.580]  The testimony, even Hillary's testimony, lying testimony, testimony where Hillary did not
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:37:00.420]  say, where are the 25 people who survived Benghazi?
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:01.980]  Why can't we talk to them?
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:06.340]  What was the White House doing and the CIA for the eight hours of this attack?
[01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:10.500]  Were they watching it occur and not sending in the military to save our troops?
[01:37:10.500 --> 01:37:16.060]  Why do the two SEALs have to essentially disobey orders to go to protect Stevens?
[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:18.820]  Again, what were the guns we were running there?
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:25.860]  You do not launder billions of dollars through HSBC for the Mexican drug cartels.
[01:37:25.860 --> 01:37:28.140]  All admitted, fines now out there.
[01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:30.740]  We've been publishing it in WND without the government knowing-
[01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:35.220]  The cartel leaders said in trials, hey, we have a national security pass.
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:36.720]  We were doing this with the government.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:38.840]  We are the drug cartels.
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:40.060]  We are Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:41.380]  We're arming Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:45.960]  We're arming the drug cartels and you've got to have, let's have criminal investigations
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:46.960]  of Hillary.
[01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.180]  Let's get the documents.
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:49.540]  Let's demand the documents.
[01:37:49.540 --> 01:37:50.740]  Why are they so bold?
[01:37:50.740 --> 01:37:55.220]  How could they publicly use Al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria and then go on the news and say,
[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:57.060]  you got to give your rights up.
[01:37:57.060 --> 01:37:58.060]  Al-Qaeda got weapons in Libya.
[01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:02.660]  Well, the compliant press with Piers Morgan, with all these other people, Piers, bring
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:05.300]  the foreigners in here and have them lecture to us on gun control.
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:07.380]  They actually says that and they're going to get me.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.380]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:12.580]  And the whole idea is avoid investigation.
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:15.420]  That's what the government wants to do, no memos.
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:18.340]  Where are the memos and the investigation on Ben Gotti?
[01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:22.980]  Take the head of the EPA when they caught her using a dummy email.
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:24.340]  HSBC, let's have a hearing.
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:25.720]  How did that happen?
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:28.020]  And the Federal Reserve and didn't know about it.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:29.500]  Why won't the Congress do it?
[01:38:29.500 --> 01:38:30.500]  Blackmail threatened?
[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:32.140]  Look, the Congress is part of the deal.
[01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:36.420]  Congress is being offered the lifetime royalty, as you say.
[01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:37.420]  They've got their positions.
[01:38:37.420 --> 01:38:40.380]  The Democratic and Republican Party are basically in agreement.
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:42.700]  And now they're offering the cops lifetime royalty.
[01:38:42.700 --> 01:38:43.700]  Take the people's guns.
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:45.180]  You can keep yours after you retire.
[01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:48.120]  Cops, if you believe that, you're idiots.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:53.340]  And just as believing the fact that if we let them go on this one, why don't we have
[01:38:53.340 --> 01:38:57.780]  a Watergate style investigation of the entire Obama administration?
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:58.780]  I agree.
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:02.340]  They admit, it was done 1,000 times what Nixon did, 10,000 times.
[01:39:02.340 --> 01:39:06.500]  They admit it's the cops holding up, going after the guns, cuz the cops know they're
[01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:10.220]  gonna have their guns taken and the cops know it's gonna be a civil war.
[01:39:10.220 --> 01:39:13.340]  Cops better protect us because the cops are next.
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:14.340]  That's the point.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:18.980]  The Communist Chinese would be happy to come in here with their military and tell the local
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:20.500]  law enforcement, we don't need you anymore.
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:22.500]  Well, they'll tell them, turn your guns and then they're gonna kill them.
[01:39:22.500 --> 01:39:24.180]  But look, you've got the NSA.
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:28.020]  The NSA can read your emails, read my emails.
[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:32.340]  You mean they couldn't read the emails of HSBC laundering money?
[01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:36.980]  They couldn't read the emails of the drug cartels coming across the border?
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:42.900]  They couldn't read the emails from Ambassador Stevens saying, we're not protected here running
[01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:45.340]  guns without kind of taking over.
[01:39:45.340 --> 01:39:49.380]  You talk to a lot of corporate and government people, are they concerned right now?
[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:53.780]  Increasingly, because again, the corporations, the whole idea is, well, corporations will
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:54.780]  be fine in globalism.
[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:57.260]  They use all the labor from China.
[01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:00.300]  So they don't need American labor.
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:02.460]  American labor is useless.
[01:40:02.460 --> 01:40:04.500]  It's a detail.
[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:06.860]  Don't need expensive American or European-
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:09.380]  Don't all these rich people know they're gonna get double-crossed?
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:11.180]  That's the whole point.
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:13.220]  You're not gonna be safe by being ignorant.
[01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:14.220]  They're idiots.
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:15.220]  You're not gonna be-
[01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:17.260]  The governing class is gonna slit their throats.
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:21.180]  And this is the big move towards globalism.
[01:40:21.180 --> 01:40:25.860]  It's the one chance where they think if they can just bankrupt the United States, eliminate
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:28.940]  the military, step by step, China will move in.
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:32.940]  We become a colony to Communist China.
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:34.460]  We become the globalists.
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:36.860]  That's why Dinesh D'Souza's film gets it wrong.
[01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:41.580]  It's not that Obama hates nation states and is an anti-colonialist.
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:44.060]  Well, no, he does hate nation states.
[01:40:44.060 --> 01:40:49.780]  It's that this is a reverse colonialism of the globalist and collectivist governing class
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:53.980]  to get rid of the nations and create a giant world government.
[01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:59.100]  Even when the Georgetown professor says the Constitution's an old document, ignore it.
[01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:03.700]  Because they think nation states, God, they think God is old.
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:05.180]  How is D'Souza's film wrong?
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:09.940]  Well, D'Souza's film is wrong in that we want to colonialize America.
[01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:10.940]  Obama-
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:11.940]  That's right.
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:12.940]  America's been colonialized by the globalists.
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:16.140]  Obama doesn't mind colonialism as long as he's the one doing the colonizing.
[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:17.140]  Exactly.
[01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:18.140]  It's a total lie.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:21.140]  Globalism is corporate colonization using communist methods.
[01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:24.820]  Let the banks do it because the banks will control the money.
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:28.660]  If England thinks it's going to vote out of the EU, they're not going to get a chance
[01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:29.660]  to do that.
[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:30.900]  That's not going to happen.
[01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:34.980]  The EU, again, bankrupting the EU, bankrupting-
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:37.280]  And their own documents admit it was designed to bankrupt.
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:42.820]  It puts more power in the hands of the global bankers who want to say, we'll be just fine.
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:45.940]  And the EU bureaucrats are all exempt from the taxes.
[01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:46.940]  Look at the money.
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:47.940]  Same deal.
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:52.340]  The only money in the United States today is held by the Chinese of the richest country
[01:41:52.340 --> 01:41:53.340]  in the world.
[01:41:53.340 --> 01:41:57.260]  The drug cartels have more money than the corporations of the federal government.
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:59.900]  The federal government has been intentionally bankrupt.
[01:41:59.900 --> 01:42:01.340]  A criminal takeover.
[01:42:01.340 --> 01:42:02.340]  Criminal takeover.
[01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:04.700]  It's a criminal takeover by the globalists of the federal government.
[01:42:04.700 --> 01:42:06.420]  And they're just criminals.
[01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:08.300]  That's why they use criminal tactics.
[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:10.700]  Obama is heading a coup d'etat from within.
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:14.420]  A criminal cartel, foreign criminal cartel coup d'etat.
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:18.300]  We are, the United States government is the drug cartel.
[01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:19.900]  We are the drug cartels.
[01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.020]  We are Al-Qaeda.
[01:42:22.020 --> 01:42:23.140]  We're funding Al-Qaeda.
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:26.460]  We're putting guns- Again, the criminal groups that have come in and hijacked are.
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:27.460]  Right.
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:28.460]  And killing Qaddafi.
[01:42:28.460 --> 01:42:30.860]  I mean, Obama, why did Obama turn on Qaddafi?
[01:42:30.860 --> 01:42:32.340]  He'd come in and worked with him.
[01:42:32.340 --> 01:42:35.780]  Qaddafi funded Obama through Louis Farrakhan.
[01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:37.540]  Reverend Wright met with Qaddafi.
[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:39.500]  He funded Sarkozy.
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:40.580]  That's even come out in the news.
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:44.340]  And then Obama turns- They double-crossed their own guy.
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:48.220]  Grew Qaddafi to the wolves because he had Al-Qaeda coming to the floor.
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:52.820]  Al-Qaeda's taken over all the criminal groups- Which, again, is Saudi Arabia.
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:54.300]  The whole idea- That's the deal.
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:57.980]  The whole idea this Arab Spring- Turn everything over to the Saudis.
[01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:03.140]  Only more of the Muslim Brotherhood, the radicals, taking over all of North Africa.
[01:43:03.140 --> 01:43:08.600]  So it's Saudi Arabia, the communist Chinese, and the mega banks all teamed up against any
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:09.700]  country they don't control.
[01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:11.500]  Any country they don't control.
[01:43:11.500 --> 01:43:14.980]  And bankrupting the United States people, making the United States people feel like
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:18.700]  if they don't get their social security checks, look at the number of people that are on the
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:21.100]  verge of bankruptcy in the United States.
[01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:23.340]  Number of people facing losing their homes.
[01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:26.680]  The plan is to take the homes away from Americans.
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:28.340]  And nationalize that.
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:31.260]  Plan is to reduce Americans to poverty.
[01:43:31.260 --> 01:43:36.620]  And this whole Claubert Piven theory is a conscious attempt to bankrupt the United States
[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:38.980]  in order for globalists to gain power.
[01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:40.540]  It's domestication for slaughter.
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:43.140]  Dr. Corsi, you've got to go catch an airplane.
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:45.820]  We're going to have you back on very, very soon when the new book comes out.
[01:43:45.820 --> 01:43:48.660]  In fact, I want to tell Weldon Henson back there over our department.
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:51.660]  I want to carry- Bad Samaritans, bad Samaritans, you'll have
[01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:52.660]  it.
[01:43:52.660 --> 01:43:53.660]  I want to carry all your new books.
[01:43:53.660 --> 01:43:55.740]  All right, Dr. Corsi, thank you for being with us.
[01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:56.980]  Alex, you're doing God's work.
[01:43:56.980 --> 01:43:57.980]  Keep it up.
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:43:58.980]  Thank you, sir.
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:43:59.980]  Wow.
[01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:01.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's got to leave us to go get on an airplane.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:02.300]  There it goes.
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:05.100]  Dr. Corsi will help him get unhooked in here.
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:11.260]  And just amazing times that we live in, absolutely amazing times.
[01:44:11.260 --> 01:44:12.260]  And I've studied history.
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:17.180]  I became obsessed with history when I was about 10 years old and became a good reader.
[01:44:17.180 --> 01:44:20.180]  And I've studied communism, fascism, socialism.
[01:44:20.180 --> 01:44:24.780]  I've read the books of Dr. Carol Quigley, the books of the White House Science Czar,
[01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:30.700]  the books of the Rockefellers, their foundations, their statements, everything that they stand
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:31.700]  for.
[01:44:31.700 --> 01:44:33.800]  And their game plan is 100% public.
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:36.780]  So when people ask, how do I know that TSA was coming to Austin?
[01:44:36.780 --> 01:44:39.820]  Well, they've announced they're gonna be in every city, and now they're here running checkpoints
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:40.820]  on the road.
[01:44:40.820 --> 01:44:42.340]  I also have my police sources.
[01:44:42.340 --> 01:44:46.300]  I mean, people ask, how did I know they'd start putting smart meters on with armed police?
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:47.620]  Well, they announced they would.
[01:44:47.620 --> 01:44:51.500]  How did I know they would start double and triple charging during peak times with smart
[01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:52.500]  meters?
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:56.660]  And then smart meters would dial in to all the new appliances 15 years ago.
[01:44:56.660 --> 01:45:00.300]  And now it's just happening, cuz it was all MIT documents.
[01:45:00.300 --> 01:45:05.260]  You can't go buy a dishwasher now, or any major appliance that doesn't have Bluetooth
[01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:09.900]  or wireless hookups, TVs, you name it, with cameras on them, dialing in through the smart
[01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:12.620]  meter, watching and listening to you.
[01:45:12.620 --> 01:45:16.820]  I mean, it's beyond 1984.
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:21.300]  Cancer viruses and the vaccines, thousands of documents, sterilizing people, killing
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:22.300]  people.
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:25.420]  I mean, we're living in a stinking nightmare, but it's all scientifically rolled out.
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:29.580]  And 95% of the government people in corporate don't know all this.
[01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:31.460]  That's why they haven't killed me.
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:34.260]  Because it's all a joke, go listen to that loud Texan.
[01:45:34.260 --> 01:45:36.580]  Wouldn't you be loud if all this was true and you knew it?
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:38.220]  Well, it is true.
[01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:41.980]  Of course I'm upset, man, I'm on the front lines of this thing.
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:46.440]  And if you'll just get out of your stinking coma, we can turn this thing around.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:50.580]  Now I wanna make a big announcement, Roger, I have to skip this network break.
[01:45:50.580 --> 01:45:54.140]  You know what, I'll make the announcement with this video, and then come back and make
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:55.700]  some other comments.
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:46:01.500]  The video just went up at infowars.com with the contest details and rules.
[01:46:01.500 --> 01:46:09.700]  It's all up at infowars.com right now, red linked in the featured news area and at prisonplanet.com.
[01:46:09.700 --> 01:46:13.060]  Infowars launches operation Paul Revere.
[01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:18.020]  Here it is, this will be a huge blow against the globalists, here it is.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:25.860]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:31.580]  Fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with the biggest contest announcement we've ever
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:32.580]  made.
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:35.220]  This is so incredibly exciting.
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:39.860]  We are launching operation Paul Revere.
[01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.420]  What did Paul Revere do?
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:49.020]  He rode through the countryside in New England saying, to arms, to arms, the redcoats are
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:50.020]  coming.
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:51.780]  One is by land, two is by sea.
[01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:56.340]  And all that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[01:46:56.340 --> 01:47:05.340]  Let me officially announce operation Paul Revere, a $100,000 cash first place winner
[01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:09.260]  to be judged by yours truly, Alex Jones.
[01:47:09.260 --> 01:47:12.420]  The film can be three minutes, it can be up to two hours.
[01:47:12.420 --> 01:47:16.580]  It can be fiction, nonfiction, documentary, drama.
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:21.680]  It's got to promote liberty and freedom and expose tyranny and oppression.
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:25.260]  And it's not just people in the US that can enter, it's folks worldwide.
[01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:29.900]  The rules, the details are at infowars.com forward slash contest.
[01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:35.100]  You have to read the rules and officially sign up for this because it's a $100,000 prize
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:40.820]  first place, $10,000 second place, $5,000 third place.
[01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:45.860]  But just as I did last year with a reporter contest, we are going to crowdsource from
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:52.400]  the pool of incredible talent out there and hire several official crews to be directors
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:59.140]  and writers and camera people in infowars.com produced major films and documentaries that
[01:47:59.140 --> 01:48:03.140]  will be put in movie theaters and on cable and I've got all the connections to get it
[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:04.140]  done.
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:06.340]  So we're going to really give the new world order hell.
[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:07.340]  This is extremely exciting.
[01:48:07.340 --> 01:48:10.960]  I've made over 20 films, one of them alone has reached more than 40 million people on
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:12.280]  YouTube and Google Video.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:17.180]  The Obama deception, Endgame, Father of Public, Road to Tyranny.
[01:48:17.180 --> 01:48:21.120]  Films are the most effective thing I do, but they're very time consuming.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:26.820]  And so I want to turn the power of we the people loose here and your art, your research,
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:29.780]  your ideas are unstoppable.
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:35.500]  We're officially kicking the contest off this Friday and you've got a little more than three
[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:42.420]  months until April 30th, just a little more than three months to produce your documentary
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:48.020]  or your film and get it out and it will absolutely reach tens of millions of people.
[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:50.420]  Our normal contest get about 500 entries.
[01:48:50.420 --> 01:48:52.460]  That's what $10,000 prizes.
[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:55.660]  This is 10 times that 100,000 for first place.
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:57.420]  That's one of the biggest contest out there.
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:49:01.780]  In fact, it's the biggest next to Doritos that has $100,000.
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:08.260]  This is huge, ladies and gentlemen, $115,000 in cash prizes and a shot to have your film
[01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:11.740]  produced and financed by Infowars.com.
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:17.560]  Edit it, upload it to YouTube and one other alternate public video site and send your
[01:49:17.560 --> 01:49:21.020]  entry to Paul Revere at Infowars.com.
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:26.120]  The animating contest of liberty that Thomas Jefferson talked about is happening right
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:27.120]  now.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:30.620]  The modern battlefield is in the mind more than ever.
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:33.820]  We use truth, the globalists use lies and deception.
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:38.380]  The corruption and oppression and high tech police state is in our face, but the controllers
[01:49:38.380 --> 01:49:39.380]  are scared.
[01:49:39.380 --> 01:49:43.180]  They intended to use the Internet to dominate and control humanity and surveillance, but
[01:49:43.180 --> 01:49:45.640]  we've turned their system against them.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:51.780]  This is a historic crossroads that we have reached and I ask you to ride in the year
[01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:58.140]  2013, just as one of the founders of this republic did back in 1775.
[01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:04.780]  I'm calling you to arms in the Infowar because the pen and the video camera is mightier than
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:05.780]  the sword.
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:11.060]  Let's go in there and rescue humanity and awaken them and set brush fires in the minds
[01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:12.380]  of men and women everywhere.
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:16.060]  Be part of this contest, you've got three months, put your hat in the ring.
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:19.360]  Be part of the solution to the corruption and oppression.
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:21.700]  Be part of the resistance to tyranny.
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:26.900]  We're looking for the Paul Revere's that will drive a stake for the New World Order's wicked
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:27.900]  heart.
[01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:32.740]  All right, we're going to break and when we come back, I'll give you more details of this
[01:50:32.740 --> 01:50:34.700]  and then I get into some of the other news.
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:38.900]  But again, I'm even shaken up right now by how fast this is moving.
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:41.980]  If you're a new listener and you're going, what is this all about?
[01:50:41.980 --> 01:50:44.120]  Read history, read about tyranny.
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:45.120]  That's what it's all about.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:50.460]  Okay, now, there will probably be 1000 entries to this, this will probably reach 100 million
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:51.460]  people.
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:53.820]  This will be the best 115,000 ever spent.
[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:56.060]  All of you win by entering the contest.
[01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:00.980]  Get involved now, infowars.com has it red linked at the top.
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:04.720]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer
[01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:09.660]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.
[01:51:09.660 --> 01:51:10.660]  Here's why.
[01:51:10.660 --> 01:51:16.000]  Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power and unlike gas generators, solar generators
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:20.400]  run quietly, emit no fumes and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:23.820]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:29.080]  Now here's the best part, every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't
[01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:30.120]  sell as new.
[01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:35.300]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily at the end of
[01:51:35.300 --> 01:51:36.300]  each year.
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:40.020]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:45.260]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.780]  Don't wait, they go fast.
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:50.660]  Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[01:51:50.660 --> 01:52:01.180]  For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:04.720]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:06.100]  That bears repeating.
[01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:09.620]  Digestive health is the key to wellness and elimination of toxins.
[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:14.140]  And ProEM-1 daily probiotic cleanse is the key to digestive health.

[01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.500]  to cleanse and remove toxins.

[01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:47.860]  Again, any historian would look at what's happening and would say, my gosh, we're going
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:50.140]  into total fascism.
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:54.420]  But it's really eugenics, eugenicism, I've got to come up with a word for this.
[01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:57.440]  It's a technocratic hell.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:04.100]  And everything, once you study it, is a psych warfare program to get you to submit to them.
[01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:05.820]  And to get you to take on the idea that you're guilty.
[01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:10.620]  I mean, look at these headlines up at infowars.com, you're a radio listener.
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:13.540]  Airport terror announcements now being played in hotels.
[01:55:13.540 --> 01:55:17.340]  And the article by Paul Watson and myself, we wrote this article together this morning.
[01:55:17.340 --> 01:55:20.620]  Paul's already written three articles today, I don't tell him to do that.
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:26.100]  He's passionate and works about 16 hours a day, because he understands how bad it is.
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:33.700]  And when he's very clean cut, his family are very nice, well-spoken people that look even
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:35.660]  aristocratic almost.
[01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:38.780]  And they go out in London and walk down the street, the police walk over and ask who you
[01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:41.060]  are, line up, you're a terrorist.
[01:55:41.060 --> 01:55:47.380]  It's when you look handsome or smart, you're the enemy, okay?
[01:55:47.380 --> 01:55:49.940]  It's when you care, the enemy senses it.
[01:55:49.940 --> 01:55:55.940]  If you look like a zombie, that's how I know how to infiltrate things, cuz I can pull it
[01:55:55.940 --> 01:55:56.940]  off.
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:00.700]  I can actually get in the mode of a low IQ and gonna, and then the system doesn't even
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:01.700]  notice you.
[01:56:01.700 --> 01:56:04.700]  They hate you when you're strong.
[01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:08.980]  And people like Watson and his brothers will be out with their wives or girlfriend, depending
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:09.980]  on which one.
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:14.380]  And it's just always the police come over and line up, gonna ask you some questions
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:16.340]  that happened to me when I was in London.
[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:21.280]  And this is how they operate.
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:25.140]  And they told me in England, they said, don't be here at the tube station, out on the street
[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:26.140]  at the entrance.
[01:56:26.140 --> 01:56:27.140]  Don't ask people questions here.
[01:56:27.140 --> 01:56:29.220]  Move along or we'll have you thrown out.
[01:56:29.220 --> 01:56:30.900]  They do that to people that are born in England.
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:32.900]  England's not a free country anymore.
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:34.420]  Paul Watson knows that.
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:41.020]  So he sits in his house, 16 hours a day conservatively, some days 18, fighting the New World Order
[01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:46.140]  at a computer.
[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:48.260]  Because he understands and he doesn't like being a slave.
[01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:50.240]  He doesn't like that it's getting worse every minute.
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:52.900]  He doesn't like the oxygen is leaving the room.
[01:56:52.900 --> 01:57:00.540]  He knows, it's like the old swashbuckler archeologist movies that came out in the 30s, 40s and 50s
[01:57:00.540 --> 01:57:04.900]  that Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost Ark is based on.
[01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:08.100]  Where you're in the temple and the water's coming in rising up, you've got to get out
[01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:12.700]  of your debt or the walls are coming in on you or sands pouring in.
[01:57:12.700 --> 01:57:15.220]  We got to get out of this.
[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:20.620]  And I'll be driving home looking at the trees, looking at the moon, the beauty of the world,
[01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:21.780]  loving my wife, my children.
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:24.820]  I don't want to die.
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:25.820]  I don't want to die.
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:30.300]  I mean, I know there's a probability they'll kill me or put me in prison.
[01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:33.940]  I mean, I wish I wasn't right.
[01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:39.220]  I wish I wasn't having to be up here launching a huge contest with hundreds of films to defeat
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:40.300]  the enemy.
[01:57:40.300 --> 01:57:45.260]  I wish I didn't have to be so effective because you know how dangerous that is?
[01:57:45.260 --> 01:57:47.380]  I destroyed Piers Morgan, the proofs of the pudding.
[01:57:47.380 --> 01:57:49.160]  They won't have me on any other shows.
[01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:52.580]  They're scared to death.
[01:57:52.580 --> 01:57:56.900]  Because they know I'll shake people out of their coma, not because I'm anybody special,
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:59.880]  but because I am primitive.
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.140]  It's a primitive response.
[01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:04.720]  They don't want you in your normal response to being oppressed to go, I'm not your slave.
[01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:07.860]  They want you to just go along with it, comply.
[01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:10.400]  Now is the time to get involved.
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:12.080]  Now is the time to take on the globalists.
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:17.380]  Now is the time to decide for what you serve, evil or good.
[01:58:17.380 --> 01:58:24.020]  And by the way, if we defend liberty, all the prosperity will come back.
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:25.300]  That's the thing.
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:27.880]  All of you that are part of the power structure and think this is going to be a beautiful
[01:58:27.880 --> 01:58:32.580]  dark ride and you've got these visions of yourself with all these powers of the state,
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:35.080]  you're going to wish later you'd not been part of this.

[01:59:53.820 --> 02:00:05.620]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:10.460]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:11.460]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:13.620]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.620 --> 02:00:21.740]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:21.740 --> 02:00:32.460]  I want to look at the mass shootings in this country that have slightly increased the last
[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:33.460]  20 years.
[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:38.260]  I say slightly increased because they're still incredibly rare, but it's one of the only
[02:00:38.260 --> 02:00:40.300]  violent crime statistics going up.
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:47.580]  In fact, we can reload those statistics from FBI.gov that Melissa Melton collated in that
[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:51.180]  slide show when Armistice Ben Fuchs joins us.
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:54.660]  Because I was listening to his show, I think it was Tuesday or Wednesday.
[02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:56.860]  And I actually sat in the car because I used to get ready at home.
[02:00:56.860 --> 02:01:02.260]  I sat in the car as I was driving into the office and I only got here about 40 minutes
[02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:06.340]  before airtime, but I sat there for about 10 minutes wanting to listen to what he was
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:07.340]  saying.
[02:01:07.340 --> 02:01:13.980]  Cuz I've interviewed so many brain surgeons, endocrinologists, different scientists, that
[02:01:13.980 --> 02:01:16.780]  I knew everything he was saying was true, it was just reminding me of it all.
[02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:21.340]  But he was putting it together so concisely and I said, can you come on Friday, I'll talk
[02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:22.340]  about this when we come back.
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:29.860]  I said, can you send me something on drug interactions with SSRIs or SRIs and mass murdering
[02:01:29.860 --> 02:01:30.860]  and killing?
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:35.420]  That's what he sent me, all these documents and articles and inserts as a pharmacist,
[02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:38.780]  a compounding pharmacist, one of the most successful in Colorado, he was a mainline
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:39.780]  pharmacist before that.
[02:01:39.780 --> 02:01:43.780]  That guy looks 20 years younger than he is, but I got some other questions about allergies.
[02:01:43.780 --> 02:01:49.860]  I wanna ask him after that, cuz I've been on longevity steadily, but only a few of the
[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:50.860]  products.
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:53.420]  I've never been a big supplement person, I'm just not in the habit for about a year and
[02:01:53.420 --> 02:01:55.780]  I've lost about 25, 30 pounds.
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:02:00.620]  It was about 40, but I gained some back cuz I never remember to do it all.
[02:02:00.620 --> 02:02:05.080]  And my muscle levels gone up, standing there naked in my bathroom, I look a lot better
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:07.460]  than I used to.
[02:02:07.460 --> 02:02:12.260]  But the muscle weighs a couple times more than fat, so there's been that conversion.
[02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:17.420]  But what do I do with supplements?
[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:21.300]  By the way, a university study on the M4's health supplements here that just came out
[02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:25.060]  from Yahoo Finance, just about how amazing they are.
[02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:28.840]  This is groundbreaking stuff, I wouldn't be promoting it.
[02:02:28.840 --> 02:02:35.460]  And my mountain juniper, they call it cedar allergy, that plagues half of Austin on average,
[02:02:35.460 --> 02:02:41.780]  has gotten so bad living here for 20 something years, since high school, 22 years.
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:47.620]  And most plants pop during the spring or summer.
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:51.500]  This thing goes off in the winter, December, January, February.
[02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:59.060]  It's so bad this year that I'm talking about going to Seattle or Miami Beach or somewhere
[02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:02.300]  for those months to do the show next year, because it's a living hell.
[02:03:02.300 --> 02:03:04.540]  So I wanna ask him, are there supplements?
[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:05.540]  What can I do?
[02:03:05.540 --> 02:03:09.180]  And I've just gotta get religious, cuz every time I do what he says, it works.
[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:15.500]  Look at Aaron, lost 95 pounds without going into one of those clinics and taking speed.
[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:20.700]  My wife's had dramatic response, my mother, my dad, if I will just follow this, then I'll
[02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:21.700]  have a great response.
[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:27.640]  So I'm gonna come back and get into the shootings and how he recommends people are able to phase
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:31.140]  off of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, cuz going right off of them, the inserts tell
[02:03:31.140 --> 02:03:35.620]  you, that'll make even go more daffy duck where he bounces around and shoots off into
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:39.780]  the atmosphere or over the horizon.
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:44.120]  So I'm no medical doctor, the medical doctors we've had on, and the psychologists, psychiatrists
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:47.860]  have said that are awake, do not go off East cold turkey.
[02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:51.060]  Whatever you do, I'm not giving that advice, that's what they say.
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:54.820]  I'm not giving any medical advice here, I'm just going off the research and what I would
[02:03:54.820 --> 02:03:55.820]  do.
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:59.620]  So we're gonna talk about the mass shootings, how to get off of it, and then natural things
[02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:04.580]  that the, by the way, the FDA wants to ban, that in the placebo studies I've seen five,
[02:04:04.580 --> 02:04:09.500]  six, seven, eight, ten times more effective in some cases.
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:16.500]  And it's not just melatonin, so also good news for people that are depressed or whatever.
[02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:20.140]  So this, we're all about solutions here, so that's why he's gonna be joining us.
[02:04:20.140 --> 02:04:24.600]  And also, we're gonna do some midair refueling, when you buy the quality, longevity products
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:30.620]  discounted at the lowest price available at mfowarshealth.com or mfowarestore.com.
[02:04:30.620 --> 02:04:33.820]  You get stuff like free shipping when you sign up for auto ship, you can sign up and
[02:04:33.820 --> 02:04:38.660]  pay 10 bucks, get discounts to be a distributor, get distributor prices, wholesale prices.
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:44.440]  When you do that, it funds mfowars operation, so we can have $100,000 contest, people to
[02:04:44.440 --> 02:04:47.700]  make films to wake up America, operation Paul Revere.
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:52.140]  So the funding that comes in lets us continue and expand and do more aggressive stuff in
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:53.140]  the face of the new world order.
[02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:56.100]  Because if I'm gonna get killed fighting these people, which I hope doesn't happen, knock
[02:04:56.100 --> 02:05:01.300]  on wood, pray to Jesus, I'm gonna go all the way.
[02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:06.540]  The new year is a great time to take charge of your health and wellness.

[02:06:41.220 --> 02:06:45.300]  citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:45.300 --> 02:06:48.800]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:50.820]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:51.820]  It's here.

[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:05.580]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[02:07:05.580 --> 02:07:10.180]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[02:07:10.180 --> 02:07:12.040]  by a disastrous economy?
[02:07:12.040 --> 02:07:14.740]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:18.540]  At E Foods Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather
[02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:21.460]  life's storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[02:07:21.460 --> 02:07:26.020]  After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all the grocery stores
[02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:30.820]  are closed, but I managed to get my E Foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[02:07:30.820 --> 02:07:31.820]  and niece.
[02:07:31.820 --> 02:07:35.620]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:37.860]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:07:37.860 --> 02:07:40.220]  Heed the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[02:08:55.580 --> 02:08:59.580]  of the New World Order are spreading across the planet.
[02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:03.580]  Every form of tyranny is exploding into huge flames
[02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:07.580]  and it's generating all that is good.
[02:09:07.580 --> 02:09:11.580]  The general public is under scientific conditioning,
[02:09:11.580 --> 02:09:15.580]  completely programmed. It's up to us not to laugh at them
[02:09:15.580 --> 02:09:19.580]  or to even get angry with them. It's up to us to shake them out of their trance.
[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:23.580]  To shake them out of the spell. To awaken
[02:09:23.580 --> 02:09:27.580]  the brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere. That's why we've launched
[02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:31.580]  Operation Awaken the Sleeping Giant
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:35.580]  where you can get 11 prisonplanet.tv memberships
[02:09:35.580 --> 02:09:39.580]  for the price of one, $5.95 a month. That's less than $0.59
[02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:43.580]  per person per month. You can create a username and passcode, give it
[02:09:43.580 --> 02:09:47.580]  to up to 10 more people. And that many can be simultaneously
[02:09:47.580 --> 02:09:51.580]  logged on to see the nightly news, to see all my films, to hear the show.
[02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:55.580]  We're having a huge effect already. But quite frankly, Operation Awaken the Sleeping Giant
[02:09:55.580 --> 02:09:59.580]  is nothing compared to Operation Paul Revere
[02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:03.580]  launched about 25 minutes ago, last hour
[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:07.580]  at prisonplanet.com and at infowars.com
[02:10:07.580 --> 02:10:11.580]  Operation Paul Revere, Operation Paul Revere
[02:10:11.580 --> 02:10:15.580]  to just absolutely turn loose, tens of thousands
[02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:19.580]  they have tens of thousands of entries for the Doritos contest
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:23.580]  $100,000 for a stupid Doritos MSG ad.
[02:10:23.580 --> 02:10:27.580]  Okay, this is $100,000 first place cash.
[02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:31.580]  So you've got to jump through more stuff with the Doritos. It's got to air, it's got to get certain ratings
[02:10:31.580 --> 02:10:35.580]  on the Super Bowl, sometimes it doesn't so you don't get all the money. This is just $100,000
[02:10:35.580 --> 02:10:39.580]  I judge it. You've got three months to produce
[02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:43.580]  the film. It can be three minutes long or two hours long. Three minutes to two hours
[02:10:43.580 --> 02:10:47.580]  that's the area. It can be fiction, non-fiction. It's got to expose tyranny, promote
[02:10:47.580 --> 02:10:51.580]  liberty. The rules are up at infowars.com. And all of you
[02:10:51.580 --> 02:10:55.580]  will win by exposing the globalist. We're launching this right now.
[02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:59.580]  All of us will win by resisting. Thousands of films are going to get made. It's going to flood
[02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:03.580]  YouTube and one other online free video site.
[02:11:03.580 --> 02:11:07.580]  Pick the other. Pick whichever one you want.
[02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:11.580]  And just flood the internet. We all win. It's a giant rush.
[02:11:11.580 --> 02:11:15.580]  It's Operation Paul Revere. Ride out as Paul Revere. I mean one example
[02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:19.580]  of a film is you could dress up like Paul Revere and actually ride around in the city at night
[02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:23.580]  warning people that tyranny is happening and handing out from horseback documents
[02:11:23.580 --> 02:11:27.580]  about the new world order takeover. I'm not saying that'll be the winner. It's just there's unlimited
[02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:31.580]  ideas. I'm actually planning to do that. I just if I get the time. I've got a thousand
[02:11:31.580 --> 02:11:35.580]  ideas. I know how to bring these people down. I know how to turn you loose. You know
[02:11:35.580 --> 02:11:39.580]  how to turn yourself loose. Operation Paul Revere.
[02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:43.580]  Operation Paul Revere. Operation Paul Revere.
[02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:47.580]  Operation Paul Revere. Launch. Dropped. And again taking
[02:11:47.580 --> 02:11:51.580]  the capital that comes in. What's the best thing we can do? Launch a news program. Make
[02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:55.580]  films. Come out with a magazine. Make viral reports.
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:59.580]  I mean I get 15 million listeners conservatively
[02:11:59.580 --> 02:12:03.580]  every week and that's growing. That's an old number. 140 stations.
[02:12:03.580 --> 02:12:07.580]  Gaining a couple new ones a week. In fact I've got news stations I'm supposed to plug today. The week's gone by.
[02:12:07.580 --> 02:12:11.580]  I mean it's incredible. We're having an effect. And with good cheer
[02:12:11.580 --> 02:12:15.580]  I stand against the enemy. If they kill me or set me up or whatever
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:19.580]  take care of my family. Keep the Infowars operation going. We've got a plan for that.
[02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:23.580]  But don't. But understand that's a sign of victory against the enemy.
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:27.580]  I hope that doesn't happen. The reason they have it is because they don't want to underline and highlight everything
[02:12:27.580 --> 02:12:31.580]  I've said. The point is that this is a fight. This is the fight I was born for.
[02:12:31.580 --> 02:12:35.580]  This is the fight you were born for. You're not meant to just watch TV and drink
[02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:39.580]  beer all day and have a good time and then get euthanized at some government facility.
[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:43.580]  You're not meant to be some bureaucrat feeding on people all day. You're not meant
[02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:47.580]  to live like this. You're not meant to put your kids on Prozac
[02:12:47.580 --> 02:12:51.580]  and Ritalin. We're not meant to live like this. And this is the animating
[02:12:51.580 --> 02:12:55.580]  contest for liberty. I'm not happy about the tyranny getting so obvious
[02:12:55.580 --> 02:12:59.580]  because I know how dark it is. But you know what? If that's the case, good. It's now out in the open.
[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:03.580]  Okay.
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:07.580]  We're going to go now for the balance of the hour to one of my favorite guests
[02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:11.580]  and one of our listeners' favorite guest. He is
[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:15.580]  pharmacist Ben Fuchs. He was a mainline pharmacist for many years
[02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:19.580]  until he saw what it was doing to people. And he's developed many
[02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:23.580]  different products, different vitamin and mineral
[02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:27.580]  systems, skin systems, you name it. He's the host of the nationally syndicated radio program
[02:13:27.580 --> 02:13:31.580]  on GCN, The Bright Side. The Bright Side, again, is on GCN the hour before
[02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:35.580]  I am. Fuchs is a registered pharmacist, nutritionist, cosmetic chemist,
[02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:39.580]  and founder of the Ocono Comp Pharmacy and Rocky
[02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:43.580]  Mountain Natural Laboratories. He's very successful pharmacist Ben.com
[02:13:43.580 --> 02:13:47.580]  BrightSideBen.com. And I'll just recap this if you just joined us. I'm
[02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:51.580]  driving in Tuesday morning. And I get ready at home. So it's
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:55.580]  about 10 o'clock I leave. It's about 10.30 to get to the office.
[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:59.580]  I got to get in and do the show. I couldn't. I had to keep listening because he was covering what
[02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:03.580]  serotonin reuptake inhibitors do to the brain. What SRIs do.
[02:14:03.580 --> 02:14:07.580]  Serotonin, you know, just the basic systems.
[02:14:07.580 --> 02:14:11.580]  He was breaking it down. And so I called him. I had Richard call him and I said,
[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:15.580]  I want to get you on about what you were breaking down because I've had all these brain surgeons and scientists on.
[02:14:15.580 --> 02:14:19.580]  They said the same thing. You say it's so concise. Send me the documentation
[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:23.580]  on that. I mean, I already know it, but send it to me. So he sent me this giant stack
[02:14:23.580 --> 02:14:27.580]  of inserts and documents and even mainstream news about
[02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:31.580]  placebos doing better than Prozac for you. And then many natural things
[02:14:31.580 --> 02:14:35.580]  really helping people that are depressed. So this is about
[02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:39.580]  solutions. And this is how people can safely from the research
[02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:43.580]  get off serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the natural things out there the FDA
[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:47.580]  is trying to block you from getting. Then I'm going to ask him about things that help with allergies.
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:51.580]  But again, I also have this report and I'll show TV viewers a document
[02:14:51.580 --> 02:14:55.580]  cam shot. Yahoo Finance, Alabama
[02:14:55.580 --> 02:14:59.580]  International or AL International announces results
[02:14:59.580 --> 02:15:03.580]  of Younggeviti clinical research studies performed by Clemson University
[02:15:03.580 --> 02:15:07.580]  Institute of Nutraceutical Research. Unbelievable
[02:15:07.580 --> 02:15:11.580]  findings and scientific double blind studies. And yes,
[02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:15.580]  we'll also do some pitching here to fund the operation. It's a win win. I promote
[02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:19.580]  what I believe in. I like government that takes your money at gunpoint that uses it against you and gives it
[02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:23.580]  MSNBC or state run media out of Qatar coming in and
[02:15:23.580 --> 02:15:27.580]  buying Al Gore's network to brainwash us. We're here saying, hey,
[02:15:27.580 --> 02:15:31.580]  we believe in this. These products are incredible. Infowarshealth.com and he's going to go through
[02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:35.580]  many of the things he formulated available at Infowarshealth.com that
[02:15:35.580 --> 02:15:39.580]  have had unbelievable responses out there. Okay, so we're going to go over this
[02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:43.580]  also talk about what he would do for, say, cedar allergy or really mountain
[02:15:43.580 --> 02:15:47.580]  juniper, but they call it cedar allergy. I'm going to pick his brain about that.
[02:15:47.580 --> 02:15:51.580]  And again, Ben joins us and I've got some of the questions. I said, send me
[02:15:51.580 --> 02:15:55.580]  questions that I should ask so I can understand this better and for people. So let's
[02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:59.580]  talk about the shootings. Let's talk about what SSRIs are doing
[02:15:59.580 --> 02:16:03.580]  and other psychotropics and antipsychotics that roughly 20% of the country is on.
[02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:07.580]  And then let's talk about, from his research, what has successfully
[02:16:07.580 --> 02:16:11.580]  helped people get off these and actually helped people not be depressed
[02:16:11.580 --> 02:16:15.580]  in this Orwellian system. What the FDA doesn't want you to know about.
[02:16:15.580 --> 02:16:19.580]  Okay, so pharmacist Ben joins us right now. Thank you
[02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:23.580]  for coming on. Thank you for having me, Alex. It's a pleasure. Okay, we're going to break
[02:16:23.580 --> 02:16:27.580]  in about four minutes, so start getting into these chemicals, what they're doing, the inserts
[02:16:27.580 --> 02:16:31.580]  say they make you mass murder. Why? The answer is give big pharma
[02:16:31.580 --> 02:16:35.580]  more money, more access to kids to stop mass shootings always connected to these
[02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:39.580]  drugs. Well, the most important thing, Alex, for people to recognize is that far
[02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:43.580]  from the happy, bliss-inducing, joy-inducing neurotransmitter
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:47.580]  hormone substance that serotonin is portrayed to be by the mainstream
[02:16:47.580 --> 02:16:51.580]  media and by mainstream medical professionals, it turns out that serotonin
[02:16:51.580 --> 02:16:55.580]  is a hormone of vigilance. It's a hormone of awareness. It's a hormone
[02:16:55.580 --> 02:16:59.580]  that's designed to keep us on our toes, so to speak. It's a daytime
[02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:03.580]  hormone that's designed to keep us able to handle the ups and downs and the
[02:17:03.580 --> 02:17:07.580]  vicissitudes of day-to-day life. So when you start to monkey around with
[02:17:07.580 --> 02:17:11.580]  this serotonin system, what you're monkeying around with is the awareness
[02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:15.580]  system, and the end result of too much serotonin is hyper-awareness,
[02:17:15.580 --> 02:17:19.580]  hyper-vigilance, paranoia, and this sense that
[02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:23.580]  this hyper-focused sense that people have when they're freaking out.
[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:27.580]  Artificial schizophrenia. It's like a type of schizophrenia. In fact,
[02:17:27.580 --> 02:17:31.580]  LSD is very similar to serotonin. It's in the same
[02:17:31.580 --> 02:17:35.580]  class. Same class, basically the same substance. Basically,
[02:17:35.580 --> 02:17:39.580]  it's the same molecule, and if you want to know what the effects of
[02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:43.580]  too much serotonin are, the kind of effects that you get when you start to manipulate the serotonin
[02:17:43.580 --> 02:17:47.580]  clearing system, which is how these SSRI drugs are,
[02:17:47.580 --> 02:17:51.580]  think of the last time you saw somebody on some kind of LSD trip.
[02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:55.580]  LSD was actually researched, was discovered when they were
[02:17:55.580 --> 02:17:59.580]  researching ways to manipulate this serotonin system. So
[02:17:59.580 --> 02:18:03.580]  serotonin is a neurotransmitter
[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:07.580]  that is involved with the vigilance response. Now, you obviously need to have this
[02:18:07.580 --> 02:18:11.580]  vigilance response, but you've got to be very, very careful with it. In addition,
[02:18:11.580 --> 02:18:15.580]  serotonin is largely produced by stress
[02:18:15.580 --> 02:18:19.580]  cells in the digestive system. Your digestive system is always
[02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:23.580]  on the alert for poisons and for toxins, and you have these stress cells,
[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:27.580]  cells that are literally similar to adrenal cells, that produce
[02:18:27.580 --> 02:18:31.580]  serotonin, just waiting for you to eat some kind of poison or some kind of toxin.
[02:18:31.580 --> 02:18:35.580]  Is that why Prozac is linked to diabetes? Prozac is linked
[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:39.580]  to diabetes for other reasons. We can get into that in a moment. That's
[02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:43.580]  a very important point, but that's why Prozac is used as an appetite
[02:18:43.580 --> 02:18:47.580]  medicine. Prozac and serotonin has an effect on the digestive system
[02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:51.580]  that is much bigger than the effect that it has on the brain. In fact, 90%
[02:18:51.580 --> 02:18:55.580]  plus of the serotonin in your body is actually produced by these stress cells
[02:18:55.580 --> 02:18:59.580]  in the digestive system. So this feeling of butterflies in your stomach,
[02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:03.580]  the feeling of nervousness that you have before you have a date or if you have stage fright,
[02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:07.580]  these are all serotonin mediated. They are the alert response
[02:19:07.580 --> 02:19:11.580]  that's produced by serotonin in these digestive stress cells.
[02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:15.580]  In the brain, serotonin is involved in the wakefulness
[02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:19.580]  response, and if you want to know what serotonin really does, think about melatonin,
[02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:23.580]  which is the exact opposite of serotonin, and we all know that when you take
[02:19:23.580 --> 02:19:27.580]  melatonin, you feel groggy, you feel sleepy, you feel relaxed. Well, serotonin does
[02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:31.580]  the exact opposite. Melatonin is the antagonistic.
[02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:35.580]  Alright, we've got to go to break, but from my research, because you're the big pharmacist and the expert,
[02:19:35.580 --> 02:19:39.580]  other experts have told me, after you've been on these drugs a while, though, it burns you out,
[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:43.580]  and they put you usually on more, then you're in a hyper awake form
[02:19:43.580 --> 02:19:47.580]  of sleep. You're in a dream state or daydreaming state,
[02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:51.580]  but hyper awake, having a hallucination, and that's why people then go and use
[02:19:51.580 --> 02:19:55.580]  a meat cleaver to chop up their one year old baby and drink the blood when the woman
[02:19:55.580 --> 02:20:23.580]  is a Sunday schoolteacher. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:41.580]  tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:45.580]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and
[02:20:45.580 --> 02:20:49.580]  their program of global eugenics dehumanization and
[02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:53.580]  ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info
[02:20:53.580 --> 02:20:57.580]  war. The spirit of 1776

[02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:33.580]  who I've caught on video in New York some of their
[02:33:33.580 --> 02:33:37.580]  reported members that's in my film Martial Law
[02:33:37.580 --> 02:33:41.580]  just saying get out of here. And they went on to say you know we're going to
[02:33:41.580 --> 02:33:45.580]  kill you like Stalin did and I've told this story and it's no exaggeration
[02:33:45.580 --> 02:33:49.580]  let me just be conservative. 20 times I can remember or more.
[02:33:49.580 --> 02:33:53.580]  I've had communists come up and tell me that when they take over I'm dead. I mean their religion
[02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:57.580]  is how they're going to kill us. And so again that's
[02:33:57.580 --> 02:34:01.580]  also at NewAmerican.com but up at drugsreport.com
[02:34:01.580 --> 02:34:05.580]  communists cheer on Obama's gun grab
[02:34:05.580 --> 02:34:09.580]  and there it is right there and we syndicate some of their
[02:34:09.580 --> 02:34:13.580]  better reports and even had Bob Dacy one of their writers in studio last week
[02:34:13.580 --> 02:34:17.580]  a fellow Austinite and it's got links to all of it
[02:34:17.580 --> 02:34:21.580]  and to the official peoplesworld.org saying take our guns
[02:34:21.580 --> 02:34:25.580]  Unbelievable information up at drugsreport.com
[02:34:25.580 --> 02:34:29.580]  easiest place to find it because I think this is already scrolled off our featured news
[02:34:29.580 --> 02:34:33.580]  from this morning. Which is a problem with Infowars. It's not a problem but
[02:34:33.580 --> 02:34:37.580]  we're going to redesign Prison Planet as a test with a big official company
[02:34:37.580 --> 02:34:41.580]  and then redesign some things and if that works then we're going to go to Infowars with a redesign
[02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:45.580]  still the basic look that's popular. But if you go to the top of Infowars.com which we can punch you up
[02:34:45.580 --> 02:34:49.580]  you'll see two links here. Breaking News that's the total
[02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:53.580]  RSS news feed and I think I'm going to change that red link to the
[02:34:53.580 --> 02:34:57.580]  top stories because the stories we write are the stuff that we think is most important
[02:34:57.580 --> 02:35:01.580]  probably twenty or thirty of them a day depending on how many we put out go in this
[02:35:01.580 --> 02:35:05.580]  and every five or six hours on average the top six or seven stories scroll
[02:35:05.580 --> 02:35:09.580]  through
[02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:13.580]  well I just noticed that the top story area
[02:35:13.580 --> 02:35:17.580]  or he must have just written a new article about that
[02:35:17.580 --> 02:35:21.580]  Infowars launches Operation Paul Revere
[02:35:21.580 --> 02:35:25.580]  Kissinger predicts nuclear war with Iran, Sheriff refuses to

[02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:45.580]  Illinois citizens still being arrested for filming police in their own yard
[02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:49.580]  for filming cops while they put a smart meter on their house without a
[02:35:49.580 --> 02:35:53.580]  warrant, communist cheer on Obama's gun grab
[02:35:53.580 --> 02:35:57.580]  that already has scrolled off the front page, Feinstein declares war on mill of rights
[02:35:57.580 --> 02:36:01.580]  calls for American citizens to be disarmed or registered, urgent
[02:36:01.580 --> 02:36:05.580]  big agri group trying to ban raw sales of milk in South Carolina

[02:36:09.580 --> 02:36:13.580]  man who brought down Acorn tells all
[02:36:13.580 --> 02:36:17.580]  the client sheriffs, just dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of them now
[02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:21.580]  standing up all over this great land from the north to the south to the east to the west
[02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:25.580]  they're trying to say owning guns is a southern thing and trying to play us off against each other
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:29.580]  New Yorkers and everybody else are coming together and saying how dare you bash people
[02:36:29.580 --> 02:36:33.580]  in the south, we're all Americans, we're not hyphenated like you want us to be
[02:36:33.580 --> 02:36:37.580]  we're not going to have a race war like you want, you're not getting our guns and I've seen so many
[02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:41.580]  black folks and veterans mainly all over YouTube, I'm not even looking for it
[02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:45.580]  I see like 20 really strong
[02:36:45.580 --> 02:36:49.580]  smart, super well spoken, ought to have a radio show, black guys
[02:36:49.580 --> 02:36:53.580]  just all over YouTube going on, we're not socialists, we're not globalists
[02:36:53.580 --> 02:36:57.580]  we're not turning our guns in, we know what's going on, we know what's happening
[02:36:57.580 --> 02:37:01.580]  we know the fraud, we know about eugenics, I mean it's exciting
[02:37:01.580 --> 02:37:05.580]  it's exciting, okay I'm going to shut up and go back to our guest, Ben Fuchs
[02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:09.580]  I'm glad Drudge linked to that because I saw that article this morning, I wanted to talk about it
[02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:13.580]  look at all these stacks, I mean there's hundreds of articles, it's all insane
[02:37:13.580 --> 02:37:17.580]  I'm going to cover a lot of special stuff tonight on the nightly news, we've got the reporters doing the news
[02:37:17.580 --> 02:37:21.580]  but I'm going to have a special report on a couple things, Ben Fuchs
[02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:25.580]  like this is your radio show now because I'm actually going to turn off my microphone and walk out of the room
[02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:29.580]  because this gets me so angry and so excited that I'll start cutting into you
[02:37:29.580 --> 02:37:33.580]  in the rest of this segment, get into the tryptophan
[02:37:33.580 --> 02:37:37.580]  and the fact that they don't, you know what's in meat, they don't want us
[02:37:37.580 --> 02:37:41.580]  getting that, explain to somebody on Prozac, I know you're not their doctor or pharmacist
[02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:45.580]  but what you would do personally, I say Prozac, the whole class of dozens
[02:37:45.580 --> 02:37:49.580]  of what is it 30 or 40 of these on the market or more right now, some numbers are over
[02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:53.580]  70 but they're not quite in the same class, well you're the pharmacist, break down
[02:37:53.580 --> 02:37:57.580]  what's not in our body, how they know this, why it says on the insert
[02:37:57.580 --> 02:38:01.580]  could make you cause mass murder, have schizophrenic
[02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:05.580]  mania, I've known women on it in college that were
[02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:09.580]  every woman I knew on it was a nymphomaniac, I don't want to get into details here but I didn't like
[02:38:09.580 --> 02:38:13.580]  that, I want the real woman, I want the real personality, not like some biological
[02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:17.580]  android, what's, why does this, obviously they want more crazy
[02:38:17.580 --> 02:38:21.580]  people so they want to put you on something that makes you crazy, what are things out there
[02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:25.580]  naturally that would actually help people because of the deficiencies in this
[02:38:25.580 --> 02:38:29.580]  toxic system, you have the floor, break it down. Well there's so many things, there's so
[02:38:29.580 --> 02:38:33.580]  many ways and we'll talk about that in a second but I want people on SSRIs to understand this
[02:38:33.580 --> 02:38:37.580]  the chemical imbalance theory of depression, the idea
[02:38:37.580 --> 02:38:41.580]  that depression is caused by a lack of serotonin and that you build your
[02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:45.580]  serotonin, you're not depressed, number one it's simplistic and naive and number two it's
[02:38:45.580 --> 02:38:49.580]  never been shown to be the case, in fact drugs
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:53.580]  that block serotonin have been shown to have anti-depressant activity just
[02:38:53.580 --> 02:38:57.580]  as well as drugs that increase serotonin so please do not be fooled
[02:38:57.580 --> 02:39:01.580]  by the simplistic idea that all you do is raise your serotonin levels
[02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:05.580]  and you're not depressed anymore, that is drug company propaganda
[02:39:05.580 --> 02:39:09.580]  that is marketing and advertising information that has never been
[02:39:09.580 --> 02:39:13.580]  shown to be the case, that's first of all, what has been shown to
[02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:17.580]  be the case is that elevations in serotonin, super high levels of serotonin
[02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:21.580]  such as the kind that are caused by artificially manipulating
[02:39:21.580 --> 02:39:25.580]  the serotonin system are associated with agitation, with restlessness
[02:39:25.580 --> 02:39:29.580]  with diarrhea, with hallucinations, with fast heartbeat
[02:39:29.580 --> 02:39:33.580]  serotonin itself, the very word serotonin
[02:39:33.580 --> 02:39:37.580]  means sero for blood, tonin for tightening
[02:39:37.580 --> 02:39:41.580]  that's because serotonin's classic effect is blood clotting
[02:39:41.580 --> 02:39:45.580]  and hypertension, let me say that again, serotonin's classic
[02:39:45.580 --> 02:39:49.580]  effect on the body is blood clotting and hypertension and it's in the
[02:39:49.580 --> 02:39:53.580]  very name serotonin, now blood clotting and hypertension are two
[02:39:53.580 --> 02:39:57.580]  iconic signs of the body's stress response
[02:39:57.580 --> 02:40:01.580]  and given the fact that 80 million or more Americans are hypertensive
[02:40:01.580 --> 02:40:05.580]  and some of the best selling drugs on the planet are blood thinning
[02:40:05.580 --> 02:40:09.580]  drugs and among the most toxic drugs, so clearly blood clotting and hypertension
[02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:13.580]  are big problems in this country, it seems to me that anybody who's considering
[02:40:13.580 --> 02:40:17.580]  taking a drug that would manipulate serotonin levels, that would up
[02:40:17.580 --> 02:40:21.580]  serotonin levels, that would increase the amount of this neurotransmitter
[02:40:21.580 --> 02:40:25.580]  that's associated with blood clotting and hypertension would want to think twice
[02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:29.580]  especially considering that this chemical imbalance theory has never been shown
[02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:33.580]  to be the case, now what we do know is that serotonin is a hormone of
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:37.580]  awareness, it's a hormone of vigilance, it is a summertime hormone
[02:40:37.580 --> 02:40:41.580]  it is a daytime hormone, it is associated with
[02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:45.580]  the sun and it's associated with light, which is why the best way to get
[02:40:45.580 --> 02:40:49.580]  your serotonin is to make sure you're getting some sunlight and not only that
[02:40:49.580 --> 02:40:53.580]  take your sunglasses off and make sure you're looking at the sun
[02:40:53.580 --> 02:40:57.580]  the rays from the sun, the photonic energy from the sun will go through
[02:40:57.580 --> 02:41:01.580]  your eyes, it'll go into your brain and it will help up-regulate
[02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:05.580]  serotonin production, in addition Alex as you mentioned there's wonderful
[02:41:05.580 --> 02:41:09.580]  wonderful nutritional strategies that you can use to up-regulate your
[02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:13.580]  serotonin system, earlier we talked about how digestive
[02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:17.580]  stress cells are called interochromatin cells, they're the largest
[02:41:17.580 --> 02:41:21.580]  producers of serotonin in the body, one of the best ways that you can
[02:41:21.580 --> 02:41:25.580]  make sure that your serotonin system is running cleanly is to eliminate
[02:41:25.580 --> 02:41:29.580]  problem foods number one, and that means any kind of foods that the body will perceive
[02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:33.580]  as a toxin, that is processed foods, that is things like excitotoxins
[02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:37.580]  MSG for example, artificial flavors, and secondly
[02:41:37.580 --> 02:41:41.580]  make sure you're addressing something called H. pylori
[02:41:41.580 --> 02:41:45.580]  H. pylori is a bacteria that overgrows in the digestive tract
[02:41:45.580 --> 02:41:49.580]  as we get older and as our digestive system becomes more compromised
[02:41:49.580 --> 02:41:53.580]  as our acid production in our digestive system and our stomach starts to become compromised
[02:41:53.580 --> 02:41:57.580]  this bacteria overgrows and that is a big time stressor on
[02:41:57.580 --> 02:42:01.580]  the serotonin system, the digestive serotonin system, so addressing
[02:42:01.580 --> 02:42:05.580]  your digestive system by clearing out H. pylori using things like apple cider
[02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:09.580]  vinegar for example, digestive enzymes for example, probiotics
[02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:13.580]  unbelievably important for supporting digestive health and supporting
[02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:17.580]  the serotonin, the digestive serotonin system, then there's the supplements
[02:42:17.580 --> 02:42:21.580]  that you could take, you mentioned 5-HTP and tryptophan, well
[02:42:21.580 --> 02:42:25.580]  in order to understand the importance of tryptophan and 5-HTP when it comes
[02:42:25.580 --> 02:42:29.580]  to serotonin, we have to understand a little bit about how biochemistry works
[02:42:29.580 --> 02:42:33.580]  in the body, the body is always taking chemical A, turning it into chemical B
[02:42:33.580 --> 02:42:37.580]  turning it into chemical C, turning it into chemical D, sort of like tinker toys
[02:42:37.580 --> 02:42:41.580]  imagine when you were a kid you used to play with tinker toys, you stick a little piece in the tinker toy
[02:42:41.580 --> 02:42:45.580]  and you create some kind of little constructive piece and then you put another
[02:42:45.580 --> 02:42:49.580]  piece on and it's a different constructive unit that you've created
[02:42:49.580 --> 02:42:53.580]  you put another piece on and you've created a different constructive unit and this is how chemicals
[02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:57.580]  work in the body, well serotonin starts
[02:42:57.580 --> 02:43:01.580]  off with tryptophan, tryptophan gets one piece stuck on and it becomes
[02:43:01.580 --> 02:43:05.580]  5-HTP or 5-hydroxytryptophan, you stick
[02:43:05.580 --> 02:43:09.580]  another piece on it and it becomes serotonin, but it all starts
[02:43:09.580 --> 02:43:13.580]  from tryptophan, so you say well gosh tryptophan must be important stuff and you better
[02:43:13.580 --> 02:43:17.580]  believe it's important stuff, not only is tryptophan critical for
[02:43:17.580 --> 02:43:21.580]  making serotonin, but tryptophan is an essential
[02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:25.580]  amino acid which means it must come in from the diet, you have
[02:43:25.580 --> 02:43:29.580]  to be eating tryptophan and tryptophan is found exclusively
[02:43:29.580 --> 02:43:33.580]  in high protein foods, you could find a little bit perhaps
[02:43:33.580 --> 02:43:37.580]  in broccoli and asparagus and you'll find some in soy, but most
[02:43:37.580 --> 02:43:41.580]  especially it's found in dairy and it's found in meat and it's especially
[02:43:41.580 --> 02:43:45.580]  found in high concentrations in whey protein, in fact for anybody who's dealing
[02:43:45.580 --> 02:43:49.580]  with SSRIs or wants to get off of SSRIs
[02:43:49.580 --> 02:43:53.580]  the first thing you want to think about is getting yourself on some good whey
[02:43:53.580 --> 02:43:57.580]  protein, a good whey protein supplement, if you can't handle it from a digestive standpoint
[02:43:57.580 --> 02:44:01.580]  make sure you take it with digestive enzymes and a little bit of apple cider vinegar
[02:44:01.580 --> 02:44:05.580]  just briefly tell us about that new product, tryptophan will boost your serotonin levels
[02:44:05.580 --> 02:44:09.580]  but there's another way that you can boost your serotonin levels and that's by taking the
[02:44:09.580 --> 02:44:13.580]  direct precursor to serotonin which is this stuff 5-HTP
[02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:17.580]  now 5-HTP is unbelievably important and helpful
[02:44:17.580 --> 02:44:21.580]  for people who are dealing with depression, anxiety, it's a wonderful sleep aid
[02:44:21.580 --> 02:44:25.580]  it's a wonderful anti-apatite or appetite suppressant, it'll help you
[02:44:25.580 --> 02:44:29.580]  lose weight, it's crazy cheap, it's like 10 or 15 bucks
[02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:33.580]  for a 3 month supply, you take about 100 milligrams or 200
[02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:37.580]  milligrams a night and that too will boost your serotonin, now when it comes to
[02:44:37.580 --> 02:44:41.580]  making serotonin in the brain, it's not just protein, even though serotonin
[02:44:41.580 --> 02:44:45.580]  comes from tryptophan, it's not just protein foods that help you
[02:44:45.580 --> 02:44:49.580]  build serotonin, you actually have to have carbohydrate
[02:44:49.580 --> 02:44:53.580]  with your protein, so you want to make sure that you're getting carbohydrates but you
[02:44:53.580 --> 02:44:57.580]  want to make sure it's not super fast burning carbohydrates like
[02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:01.580]  processed foods and soda pop and desserts, you want to make sure it's a carbohydrate that's got a lot of
[02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:05.580]  fiber in it, especially vegetable carbohydrates, there's a big big
[02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:09.580]  problem and there's an important relationship between sugar intake and serotonin
[02:45:09.580 --> 02:45:13.580]  when you eat sugar, this is perceived biochemically by the body
[02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:17.580]  as a major stress, sugar is very very explosive stuff
[02:45:17.580 --> 02:45:21.580]  if you ever put a marshmallow in a fire and you see the marshmallow go poof
[02:45:21.580 --> 02:45:25.580]  you can see how explosive sugar is, well in the body that same kind of
[02:45:25.580 --> 02:45:29.580]  explosivity, that same kind of explosive reaction occurs
[02:45:29.580 --> 02:45:33.580]  and so when you eat sugar, especially fast burning sugars, dessert kinds of
[02:45:33.580 --> 02:45:37.580]  sugars, soda pop kinds of sugars, the body's stress response
[02:45:37.580 --> 02:45:41.580]  is triggered and this stress response involves serotonin
[02:45:41.580 --> 02:45:45.580]  in fact the hormone insulin and the hormone serotonin work
[02:45:45.580 --> 02:45:49.580]  hand in hand and today we have a big problem, maybe the biggest
[02:45:49.580 --> 02:45:53.580]  health crisis of all is something called insulin resistance and this is
[02:45:53.580 --> 02:45:57.580]  when the body stops listening to insulin and going hand in hand with
[02:45:57.580 --> 02:46:01.580]  insulin resistance is serotonin resistance and just like insulin
[02:46:01.580 --> 02:46:05.580]  resistance will keep the body from listening to insulin, serotonin resistance will keep the
[02:46:05.580 --> 02:46:09.580]  body from listening to serotonin, of course then you're going to go to the doctor and he's going to give you
[02:46:09.580 --> 02:46:13.580]  an SSRI drug and all you really need to do is
[02:46:13.580 --> 02:46:17.580]  reset this insulin system by reducing your intake of fast burning sugars
[02:46:17.580 --> 02:46:21.580]  so you want to make sure you're having some carbohydrate with your protein, you want to make sure it's
[02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:25.580]  fibery carbohydrate, you want to make sure you're getting enough protein, especially tryptophan
[02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:29.580]  containing protein and you want to make sure that you're getting 5 HTP, now in addition
[02:46:29.580 --> 02:46:33.580]  to all of this, there are co-factors that the brain uses, the body
[02:46:33.580 --> 02:46:37.580]  uses to help make serotonin, chief among these is vitamin
[02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:41.580]  C and the B complex, especially vitamin B6 and to a little bit
[02:46:41.580 --> 02:46:45.580]  lesser extent minerals like zinc and magnesium, and that's why you need to take the Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[02:46:45.580 --> 02:46:49.580]  and infowarshealth.com, I mean it's simple, my children act like demons
[02:46:49.580 --> 02:46:53.580]  and I let them have processed sugar but when we are on the job and only feed them organic
[02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:57.580]  and healthy food, they're little angels and everything's great, if I'm on the road
[02:46:57.580 --> 02:47:01.580]  and I'm dumb enough to eat a piece of cake or something, I feel like I have a hangover the next day
[02:47:01.580 --> 02:47:05.580]  going over this and people go to infowarshealth.com, there's many of the products, you and
[02:47:05.580 --> 02:47:09.580]  others and Dr. Wallach have formulated and this is no joke folks
[02:47:09.580 --> 02:47:13.580]  what would you, again we're not giving them the advice, they should, because it's
[02:47:13.580 --> 02:47:17.580]  very dangerous to go off the serotonin reuptake inhibitors and we have a report
[02:47:17.580 --> 02:47:21.580]  here, we're going to show people in a moment, what would you do
[02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:25.580]  if you were say a 35 year old man or woman who's been
[02:47:25.580 --> 02:47:29.580]  on psychotropics for say 6 years, they've got you on 3 of them
[02:47:29.580 --> 02:47:33.580]  because the others didn't work and you don't know
[02:47:33.580 --> 02:47:37.580]  who you are anymore and you're kind of eating a regular McDonald's
[02:47:37.580 --> 02:47:41.580]  diet, what would be just the brief process that Ben Fuchs, and again my dad's
[02:47:41.580 --> 02:47:45.580]  a dentist and oral surgeon, the people he respects more than anybody aren't
[02:47:45.580 --> 02:47:49.580]  even doctors of people, it's pharmacists because he knows especially long time
[02:47:49.580 --> 02:47:53.580]  master pharmacist, you guys kill people if you make a mistake and so
[02:47:53.580 --> 02:47:57.580]  you guys really went to school to actually know what the drugs do, you know
[02:47:57.580 --> 02:48:01.580]  I don't know 20, 30 times what doctors do, so that's why you're the
[02:48:01.580 --> 02:48:05.580]  guy to talk to on this, what are the dangers of going off the serotonin
[02:48:05.580 --> 02:48:09.580]  reuptake inhibitors or other anti-psychotic classes?
[02:48:09.580 --> 02:48:13.580]  Well first of all we have to understand how serotonin reuptake inhibitors work, when the brain
[02:48:13.580 --> 02:48:17.580]  secretes serotonin it immediately sucks that serotonin back up again
[02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:21.580]  so the serotonin will get released and then it will get uptaken
[02:48:21.580 --> 02:48:25.580]  it will get sucked back up again into the
[02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:29.580]  nerves so that it doesn't have too much of an effect, this is called reuptake and it's a
[02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:33.580]  standard process that occurs in the body or in the brain
[02:48:33.580 --> 02:48:37.580]  reuptake inhibitors inhibit that
[02:48:37.580 --> 02:48:41.580]  process so the serotonin stays in the system
[02:48:41.580 --> 02:48:45.580]  a major chemical imbalance, that serotonin is artificially
[02:48:45.580 --> 02:48:49.580]  kept active, so you get off your serotonin reuptake inhibitors and because
[02:48:49.580 --> 02:48:53.580]  this uptake mechanism has been shut down, now you've got all of this
[02:48:53.580 --> 02:48:57.580]  serotonin that has left the nerve cells, you run into
[02:48:57.580 --> 02:49:01.580]  a major, major risk of serotonin depletion because the serotonin
[02:49:01.580 --> 02:49:05.580]  is not getting taken up back into the cell, so you want to make
[02:49:05.580 --> 02:49:09.580]  sure if you're going to get off of serotonin reuptake inhibitors that you
[02:49:09.580 --> 02:49:13.580]  wean yourself off of them very slowly and you build your
[02:49:13.580 --> 02:49:17.580]  serotonin levels back up by number one, making sure you're getting out in
[02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:21.580]  the sun, make sure you get 10 or 15 minutes of sun 3 or 4 days a week
[02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:25.580]  you don't want to burn, but you want to make sure that you're getting some sun
[02:49:25.580 --> 02:49:29.580]  yeah the ultimate prozac is climbing mountains, I'm telling you right now
[02:49:29.580 --> 02:49:33.580]  absolutely, ultimate prozac is the great outdoors, nature and the divine force, that's the prozac
[02:49:33.580 --> 02:49:37.580]  oh my god, I want more of it!
[02:49:37.580 --> 02:49:41.580]  right, you get out in the sun, don't we all feel better when we're out in the sun?
[02:49:41.580 --> 02:49:45.580]  are you kidding, if I had my way all I'd do is climb mountains
[02:49:45.580 --> 02:49:49.580]  with a demon in the sky that's hell-bent on our destruction
[02:49:49.580 --> 02:49:53.580]  we've been bamboozled and entranced and we believe this nonsense
[02:49:53.580 --> 02:49:57.580]  and then as you point out, when we don't have the vitamins and minerals, we do get sunburned
[02:49:57.580 --> 02:50:01.580]  well that's another thing, if you want to prevent yourself from getting sunburned, make sure you're getting nutrients
[02:50:01.580 --> 02:50:05.580]  that get stored in your skin to protect you from the sun, carotenes, flavonoids
[02:50:05.580 --> 02:50:09.580]  vitamin c, zinc, vitamin e, they literally get deposited in your skin
[02:50:09.580 --> 02:50:13.580]  to protect you from the sun, and let me tell you something, skin cancer rates
[02:50:13.580 --> 02:50:17.580]  are increasing dramatically, despite the fact that
[02:50:17.580 --> 02:50:21.580]  how do you like that? the sun is actually protective against skin cancer
[02:50:21.580 --> 02:50:25.580]  the sun is protective against skin cancer, and people are using sunscreens
[02:50:25.580 --> 02:50:29.580]  like they're going out of style, and skin cancer rates are increasing by 100%
[02:50:29.580 --> 02:50:33.580]  aluminum based, we're going to come back, I want to talk about
[02:50:33.580 --> 02:50:37.580]  again, somebody on these drugs, because I've got a schedule here from
[02:50:37.580 --> 02:50:41.580]  ssrstories.com, and it talks about warning, going off this
[02:50:41.580 --> 02:50:45.580]  is a big deal, I mean folks, you're on a LSD molecule
[02:50:45.580 --> 02:50:49.580]  so we're going to come back, and we're extremists
[02:50:49.580 --> 02:50:53.580]  we're saying LSD is bad to give to kids, especially
[02:50:53.580 --> 02:50:57.580]  they're going to have a bad trip, and almost all these shooters and mothers
[02:50:57.580 --> 02:51:21.580]  that kill their kids, they're on it, why don't we send them to jail?
[02:51:27.580 --> 02:51:31.580]  is only compounding the problem
[02:51:31.580 --> 02:51:35.580]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:51:35.580 --> 02:51:39.580]  a solar power generator provides

[02:54:11.580 --> 02:54:15.580]  no thought control
[02:54:15.580 --> 02:54:19.580]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I don't have a dairy, I don't sell milk
[02:54:19.580 --> 02:54:23.580]  I don't sell eggs, I don't sell beef steak
[02:54:23.580 --> 02:54:27.580]  There's a lot of contaminants in the beef and stuff now, as you know
[02:54:27.580 --> 02:54:31.580]  There's some downsides to a bunch of meat, and even though I love every piece of it
[02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:35.580]  Because of the industrial system, we've got high quality whey available
[02:54:35.580 --> 02:54:39.580]  Obviously, so I guess we do sell that in the way at Infowarshealth.com

[02:55:43.580 --> 02:55:47.580]  For people, Catherine at Infowars.com
[02:55:47.580 --> 02:55:51.580]  And we have a whole team there of people, some of them pharmacists and others, when they answer the phone
[02:55:51.580 --> 02:55:55.580]  Others are just trained by them to answer your questions, Infowarshealth.com
[02:55:55.580 --> 02:55:59.580]  This is a revolution though, because I'll tell you this, Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[02:55:59.580 --> 02:56:03.580]  Polymers Plus, the essential fatty acids, all of it
[02:56:03.580 --> 02:56:07.580]  What it's giving me is more energy
[02:56:07.580 --> 02:56:11.580]  Something magic to give us energy, no, we're designed for the minerals
[02:56:11.580 --> 02:56:15.580]  The trace elements, the things we need, the government says we need 40-something vitamins and minerals
[02:56:15.580 --> 02:56:19.580]  We need 90, and it's all available at Infowarshealth.com
[02:56:19.580 --> 02:56:23.580]  Okay, so continuing, basically you're saying get out in the sunshine
[02:56:23.580 --> 02:56:27.580]  While you wean yourself off, there's different regimens online
[02:56:27.580 --> 02:56:31.580]  Doctors say it takes about two months generally, depending on the type
[02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:35.580]  Obviously consult one of the physicians, the problem is these psychologists aren't really physicians
[02:56:35.580 --> 02:56:39.580]  They'll tell you, stay on it, or their answer is more of it, well this isn't working
[02:56:39.580 --> 02:56:43.580]  We'll stack them, that'll fix it, so we're not telling you what to do
[02:56:43.580 --> 02:56:47.580]  I'm saying get out, exercise fresh air
[02:56:47.580 --> 02:56:51.580]  Pray to God, if you don't believe in that, meditate, all the studies show it works
[02:56:51.580 --> 02:56:55.580]  For whatever reason, praying helps, there are no atheists and foxholes
[02:56:55.580 --> 02:56:59.580]  Ben, why do the studies show, I've got them right here, that the
[02:56:59.580 --> 02:57:03.580]  Praying helps? Well, relaxation response
[02:57:03.580 --> 02:57:07.580]  That's the reason why people have religion in the first place, is this idea that there's something
[02:57:07.580 --> 02:57:11.580]  That can help them, that can take control over their lives
[02:57:11.580 --> 02:57:15.580]  I'm not a particular religious person, but I'm a very spiritual person, and there's a lot of
[02:57:15.580 --> 02:57:17.580]  A lot of good that can be had by people
[02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:21.580]  When you pray, what are you focusing on? The great void, the great unknown, the universe
[02:57:21.580 --> 02:57:23.580]  You're forgetting all this, you're ah
[02:57:23.580 --> 02:57:27.580]  The magic of the body, the amazingness of nature, the cosmos
[02:57:27.580 --> 02:57:31.580]  There's a hundred trillion cells in your body, and each one of them has 18 feet
[02:57:31.580 --> 02:57:35.580]  Of DNA, if you added all the DNA in your body, it would go 300 billion miles
[02:57:35.580 --> 02:57:39.580]  You have a coordinated, tightly choreographed
[02:57:39.580 --> 02:57:43.580]  System that is beyond belief, just in a tiny cell of which you have a hundred trillion
[02:57:43.580 --> 02:57:47.580]  It's unbelievable, Alex, we are the most unbelievable
[02:57:47.580 --> 02:57:51.580]  We're the most unbelievable creatures, we should be only focusing on that
[02:57:51.580 --> 02:57:55.580]  Let alone the cosmos that is trillions upon trillions
[02:57:55.580 --> 02:57:59.580]  Look, one piece of human DNA as you know, three billion long
[02:57:59.580 --> 02:58:03.580]  One piece, we are incredible
[02:58:03.580 --> 02:58:07.580]  Incredible, Alex, you know what a cell is? A cell is a tiny, we talk about cells so glibly
[02:58:07.580 --> 02:58:11.580]  But what is this thing? It's a tiny little animal that if you took it out of your body
[02:58:11.580 --> 02:58:15.580]  And put it in a petri dish, it would walk to food, it would run away from poison
[02:58:15.580 --> 02:58:19.580]  It excretes, it reproduces, it has a skeletal system, and it's one one hundredth
[02:58:19.580 --> 02:58:23.580]  No, no, we're just like jellyfish, we are a colony creature
[02:58:23.580 --> 02:58:27.580]  You know about that, don't you? The fact that our tissues make up a colony
[02:58:27.580 --> 02:58:31.580]  We are a colony, that's right, we're a hundred trillion cell colony, that's exactly right
[02:58:31.580 --> 02:58:35.580]  With DNA that resonates from signals from space
[02:58:35.580 --> 02:58:39.580]  Proven, antennas, spiritual antennas, we'll be back

[02:59:53.580 --> 02:59:57.580]  Direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.580 --> 03:00:01.580]  Broadcasting Network
[03:00:01.580 --> 03:00:05.580]  Big Brother
[03:00:05.580 --> 03:00:09.580]  Mainstream Media
[03:00:09.580 --> 03:00:13.580]  You want answers? Well, so does he
[03:00:13.580 --> 03:00:17.580]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[03:00:17.580 --> 03:00:21.580]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[03:00:21.580 --> 03:00:25.580]  I promise you this, unless I get run over by a car
[03:00:25.580 --> 03:00:29.580]  The next couple of weeks we'll get Ben back to take an hour or two of calls
[03:00:29.580 --> 03:00:33.580]  On allergies, on getting off serotonin reuptake inhibitors, on weight loss, everything
[03:00:33.580 --> 03:00:37.580]  And again, we're doing a few minutes in for marshaling here, but really this is all hey, go eat more eggs
[03:00:37.580 --> 03:00:41.580]  Folks, drink more milk, I mean healthy milk
[03:00:41.580 --> 03:00:45.580]  It's really more sunlight
[03:00:45.580 --> 03:00:49.580]  Now we do have SleepEase that does have the
[03:00:49.580 --> 03:00:53.580]  Chemicals, the 5-HTP in it
[03:00:53.580 --> 03:00:57.580]  That then I guess gets converted over to the tryptophan
[03:00:57.580 --> 03:01:01.580]  And other things that the EPA took off the market with a fake scare a few decades ago
[03:01:01.580 --> 03:01:05.580]  But the precursor of it, SleepEase, available at InfowarsHealth.com
[03:01:05.580 --> 03:01:09.580]  Right now, there in the huge catalog
[03:01:09.580 --> 03:01:13.580]  But Ben, you've agreed to stay another 20 minutes, what I'm going to do is we're going to come back in the next
[03:01:13.580 --> 03:01:17.580]  Segment, I'm going to throw it to you to cover areas of this in general
[03:01:17.580 --> 03:01:21.580]  Then I'm going to come back in the final segment, we're in overdrive right now
[03:01:21.580 --> 03:01:25.580]  The reason I get so excited about all this is the truth is laying around all
[03:01:25.580 --> 03:01:29.580]  In front of us, and it really makes me mad at the power structure, because you're a nice guy
[03:01:29.580 --> 03:01:33.580]  You say, well, most doctors and people don't know this, and that's actually true, because I know a lot of
[03:01:33.580 --> 03:01:37.580]  Doctors, my dad knows a lot of them, but a lot of them in the power
[03:01:37.580 --> 03:01:41.580]  Structure, they do know, and it's very cold blooded that
[03:01:41.580 --> 03:01:45.580]  Double blind studies, sugar pills, better than Prozac, and actually makes, I mean
[03:01:45.580 --> 03:01:49.580]  What's happening in Harris and Kleibold and all these guys who are on these drugs
[03:01:49.580 --> 03:01:53.580]  When they go crazy and have that same million mile stare, you know, crazy
[03:01:53.580 --> 03:01:57.580]  Man look on their face, what's happening to them
[03:01:57.580 --> 03:02:01.580]  When they're playing murder simulator video games and they're on four or five drugs
[03:02:01.580 --> 03:02:05.580]  And an amphetamine drug on top of it usually, and they go and kill everybody
[03:02:05.580 --> 03:02:07.580]  I mean, they're highly suggestible
[03:02:07.580 --> 03:02:11.580]  Violence and paranoia are part of the hypervigilant response
[03:02:11.580 --> 03:02:15.580]  Vigilance is important, you know, you've got to be aware, but this hypervigilant
[03:02:15.580 --> 03:02:19.580]  Response is akin to paranoia, what we call paranoia can be defined as hypervigilance
[03:02:19.580 --> 03:02:23.580]  When you start messing around with serotonin, pharmacologically manipulating
[03:02:23.580 --> 03:02:27.580]  Its levels, keeping serotonin activity high artificially
[03:02:27.580 --> 03:02:31.580]  You run the risk of this kind of paranoia hypervigilance, which is where
[03:02:31.580 --> 03:02:35.580]  Rage comes from and rageful behavior comes from, you can't mess around
[03:02:35.580 --> 03:02:39.580]  With your brain chemistry artificially and not expect to create
[03:02:39.580 --> 03:02:43.580]  Problems, and this whole idea of chemical imbalance, manipulating the brain
[03:02:43.580 --> 03:02:47.580]  Alex, do you think there's a test for serotonin, do you think you go to a psychiatrist and he
[03:02:47.580 --> 03:02:51.580]  Does a test to see how high your serotonin level goes, they just give it to you
[03:02:51.580 --> 03:02:55.580]  They just give them to you, that's exactly right, they give them to you like they're M&M's or like they're candy
[03:02:55.580 --> 03:02:59.580]  The fact of the matter is the history of psychiatry is not very pretty, the history of medicine
[03:02:59.580 --> 03:03:03.580]  In general is not very pretty, the inventor of the lobotomy as you know a hundred years ago did thousands
[03:03:03.580 --> 03:03:07.580]  Thousands where he would go before a carnival and take a mentally
[03:03:07.580 --> 03:03:11.580]  Retarded person and jam an ice pick in their brain in front of people
[03:03:11.580 --> 03:03:15.580]  That's how they do, that's how they used to cure depression, they would hack your brain out
[03:03:15.580 --> 03:03:19.580]  Or electroconvulsive therapy where they shock you into being happy, this is the
[03:03:19.580 --> 03:03:23.580]  History of psychiatry, but Alex the question is, why are we complicit
[03:03:23.580 --> 03:03:27.580]  Why do we participate, why do we listen to anything they tell us
[03:03:27.580 --> 03:03:31.580]  When like you say, the information is right there in plain sight
[03:03:31.580 --> 03:03:35.580]  Perhaps hidden in plain sight, but it's in plain sight, I sent you a stack of information
[03:03:35.580 --> 03:03:39.580]  It took me all of 15 or 20 minutes to gather that information
[03:03:39.580 --> 03:03:43.580]  It's everywhere, the fact of the matter is if you do your research you will see
[03:03:43.580 --> 03:03:47.580]  Serotonin is a sunlight, daylight, awareness, vigilance, hormone
[03:03:47.580 --> 03:03:51.580]  This is another very important point, serotonin absorbs
[03:03:51.580 --> 03:03:55.580]  Light, serotonin contains, serotonin contains tryptophan
[03:03:55.580 --> 03:03:59.580]  Or a tryptophan like shape, tryptophan itself contains like chlorophyll
[03:03:59.580 --> 03:04:03.580]  Which is the ultimate light absorbing substance, gets its light absorbing power
[03:04:03.580 --> 03:04:07.580]  From tryptophan, so when you eat tryptophan, not only do you upregulate
[03:04:07.580 --> 03:04:11.580]  Serotonin, but you help your body utilize light, Alex we are
[03:04:11.580 --> 03:04:15.580]  Photosynthetic beings, we absorb light from the sun
[03:04:15.580 --> 03:04:19.580]  That sunlight gets turned into batteries, it gets turned into biochemistry
[03:04:19.580 --> 03:04:23.580]  It gets turned into physical matter, most especially serotonin
[03:04:23.580 --> 03:04:27.580]  In fact, by the way, tryptophan is a part of our visual pigment
[03:04:27.580 --> 03:04:31.580]  We actually see via the activity of tryptophan, we receive light from the sun in our eyes
[03:04:31.580 --> 03:04:35.580]  Via the activity of tryptophan, by the way I'm showing people images
[03:04:35.580 --> 03:04:39.580]  Of public lobotomies, if you even misbehave
[03:04:39.580 --> 03:04:43.580]  They just take you down and jam an ice pick up through the eyelid
[03:04:43.580 --> 03:04:47.580]  And right into your brain, into the cerebral cortex and just randomly
[03:04:47.580 --> 03:04:51.580]  Punching holes into your brain with pleasure

[03:05:45.580 --> 03:05:49.580]  And their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[03:05:49.580 --> 03:05:55.580]  Ultimate extermination, the war is here, it's an Infowar
[03:05:55.580 --> 03:06:01.580]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984

[03:07:06.580 --> 03:07:15.580]  The progressive deterioration of the body that occurs almost universally the older one gets can partly to significantly be prevented with conscientious attention to nutrition
[03:07:15.580 --> 03:07:23.580]  If the Hanza men can play rugby in their 90s then it is possible for everyone in North America to experience a more youthful life as well
[03:07:23.580 --> 03:07:28.580]  One key ingredient to warding off aging and reversing some of it is the type and quality of protein consumed
[03:07:28.580 --> 03:07:37.580]  All protein foods or supplements you currently consume are heat damaged destroying 50 to 75% of your ability to utilize the body building amino acids
[03:07:37.580 --> 03:07:43.580]  One World Way is not heat damaged and allows your body to utilize 100% of the amino acids
[03:07:43.580 --> 03:07:46.580]  This feat no one else has achieved

[03:08:00.580 --> 03:08:06.580]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show
[03:08:06.580 --> 03:08:09.580]  Because there's a war on for your mind
[03:08:09.580 --> 03:08:25.580]  We're back live, pharmacist Ben Fuchs, compounding pharmacist is our guest
[03:08:25.580 --> 03:08:31.580]  We're doing one more segment with him here on this Friday edition and I'll be back this Sunday
[03:08:31.580 --> 03:08:39.580]  4 to 6 p.m. Central live in studio we ran a best of with some new stuff that had there but also some tidbits of best of last Sunday 4 to 6
[03:08:39.580 --> 03:08:43.580]  About once a month it's a rebroadcast, about three times a month it's live
[03:08:43.580 --> 03:08:47.580]  One of the hardest working guys in media because I know there's no future if we don't turn this around
[03:08:47.580 --> 03:08:51.580]  I'm going to shoot a couple of reports that are going to be on the nightly news tonight of extreme import
[03:08:51.580 --> 03:08:57.580]  And that's 7 o'clock central, prisonplanet.tv, you can get 11 memberships for $5.95 a month and share them
[03:08:57.580 --> 03:09:00.580]  I mean nobody offers that, that just pays for the bandwidth
[03:09:00.580 --> 03:09:07.580]  Our goal is to get the word out, we have the $115,000 contest we're able to do because you're supporting us
[03:09:07.580 --> 03:09:14.580]  For people to make films, thousand films I guess will be made, it will reach I'd guess 50 to 100 million people
[03:09:14.580 --> 03:09:17.580]  That's my goal is 100 million, I'd be happy with 50 million
[03:09:17.580 --> 03:09:24.580]  There will be some great films made, great resistance to tyranny and the winner gets $100,000, second place $10,000
[03:09:24.580 --> 03:09:30.580]  Operation of Paul Revere, third place $5,000 and then it shot that pool of not just the winners but others
[03:09:30.580 --> 03:09:35.580]  To come here and be financed by infowars.com, producing it to make a flotilla of films
[03:09:35.580 --> 03:09:40.580]  Because I could make some really good films and I have obviously mega viral films
[03:09:40.580 --> 03:09:45.580]  But we want to go to the next level and just expand the team in the face of this, it's all in
[03:09:45.580 --> 03:09:50.580]  It's a total commitment against the new world order and we couldn't have done it without your support
[03:09:50.580 --> 03:09:57.580]  If you support us in a win win, buying pro pure water filters discounted with promo code water at infowarsstore.com
[03:09:57.580 --> 03:10:03.580]  Or going to infowarshealth.com and getting the best supplements that we've assembled all in one spot via Younggebity
[03:10:03.580 --> 03:10:07.580]  Discounted, infowarshealth.com, this is how we do it
[03:10:07.580 --> 03:10:15.580]  And by the way I'm not being a bad guy here because I'm against Genesis, Genesis is great
[03:10:15.580 --> 03:10:19.580]  Most radio networks and stations take any advertising, Genesis has a lot of standards
[03:10:19.580 --> 03:10:24.580]  But I'm approached all the time by supplement companies and they'll say
[03:10:24.580 --> 03:10:29.580]  We'll pay you $100,000 to endorse this product and I go see the claims and I can't prove it
[03:10:29.580 --> 03:10:35.580]  And I go sorry I'm not going to do that and then they come back and go we'll pay you $500,000 right now
[03:10:35.580 --> 03:10:41.580]  These are things you hear nationwide not just on Genesis and I go I'm sorry I just can't prove these things
[03:10:41.580 --> 03:10:49.580]  And so no, I have to do money bombs or sell memberships or whatever but everything I do is about getting the word out
[03:10:49.580 --> 03:10:52.580]  If it's a t-shirt it's about defending the second amendment or property rights
[03:10:52.580 --> 03:10:55.580]  If it's a film it's about exposing agenda 21
[03:10:55.580 --> 03:10:59.580]  Everything we do is a win win win win win and Infowarshealth is just amazing
[03:10:59.580 --> 03:11:04.580]  So get your beyond tangy tangerine, your polymers plus that bears my name on it, I like it so much
[03:11:04.580 --> 03:11:10.580]  All the different supplements are available there, the essential fatty acids, everything
[03:11:10.580 --> 03:11:13.580]  Infowarshealth.com and know you're supporting us
[03:11:13.580 --> 03:11:19.580]  Now Ben I'm going to give you the rest of this segment about 10 minutes to get into other facets
[03:11:19.580 --> 03:11:23.580]  What you would do, why allergies are increasing, how people should detox
[03:11:23.580 --> 03:11:27.580]  Other things about what Prozac and other drugs are doing to people
[03:11:27.580 --> 03:11:31.580]  What you would do with a child who's obviously bouncing off the walls
[03:11:31.580 --> 03:11:34.580]  It's usually they admit what they've been eating
[03:11:34.580 --> 03:11:37.580]  You've got the floor for the balance of this segment
[03:11:37.580 --> 03:11:40.580]  Alex there's two great movements in the body
[03:11:40.580 --> 03:11:44.580]  You have the movement towards stress and vigilance and awareness and fear
[03:11:44.580 --> 03:11:47.580]  And you have the relaxation response
[03:11:47.580 --> 03:11:54.580]  Growth and repair and anti-aging and healing all occur when the body is relaxed
[03:11:54.580 --> 03:11:58.580]  Anything that exacerbates or exaggerates the stress response
[03:11:58.580 --> 03:12:03.580]  Serotonin for example, prescription drugs for example, sugar and processed food for example
[03:12:03.580 --> 03:12:09.580]  Anything that exacerbates the stress response, this fear response is going to shut down growth and repair
[03:12:09.580 --> 03:12:14.580]  And this is why it seems to me like there's this almost this insidious conspiracy
[03:12:14.580 --> 03:12:19.580]  To keep us from being able to grow, to keep us sick, to keep us from being able to repair
[03:12:19.580 --> 03:12:24.580]  To accelerate the aging process and this is why it's so, so, so important
[03:12:24.580 --> 03:12:28.580]  To avoid interacting with prescription drugs at all times
[03:12:28.580 --> 03:12:31.580]  With the exception perhaps of pain pills if you're in pain
[03:12:31.580 --> 03:12:36.580]  Antibiotics obviously although these days we hear about the problems with antibiotic resistance
[03:12:36.580 --> 03:12:40.580]  Anybody who understands anything about antibiotics could have seen this one coming
[03:12:40.580 --> 03:12:45.580]  But still there's times when you need antibiotics perhaps aside from antibiotics and pain pills and perhaps chemotherapy
[03:12:45.580 --> 03:12:49.580]  Any prescription drugs need to be avoided like the plague
[03:12:49.580 --> 03:12:51.580]  Literally like the plague
[03:12:51.580 --> 03:12:56.580]  If you're on an SSRI drug, if you're considering an SSRI drug please consider the alternatives
[03:12:56.580 --> 03:12:59.580]  Number one, get yourself out in the sun
[03:12:59.580 --> 03:13:02.580]  Number two, make sure you're practicing deep breathing techniques
[03:13:02.580 --> 03:13:06.580]  Number three, make sure you're getting enough salt for your adrenal glands
[03:13:06.580 --> 03:13:09.580]  This is another hideous idea that we have to avoid salt
[03:13:09.580 --> 03:13:14.580]  The fact of the matter is salt is very important for helping the adrenal glands
[03:13:14.580 --> 03:13:18.580]  And keeping your body from going into this fight or flight response
[03:13:18.580 --> 03:13:21.580]  Make sure that you're using a nutritional supplement program
[03:13:21.580 --> 03:13:25.580]  Especially the B complex which is not only important for making serotonin
[03:13:25.580 --> 03:13:29.580]  But it's important for the stress response and it's important for mental health as well
[03:13:29.580 --> 03:13:33.580]  Make sure you're focusing on digestive wellness
[03:13:33.580 --> 03:13:36.580]  The immune system is the digestive system in many ways
[03:13:36.580 --> 03:13:41.580]  In fact 80-90% of your immune system is located in the digestive tract
[03:13:41.580 --> 03:13:44.580]  You talk about allergies, the number one cause of allergies
[03:13:44.580 --> 03:13:49.580]  Whether it's to cedarwood or whether it's to juniper or whether it's to pollen or whether it's to anything else
[03:13:49.580 --> 03:13:52.580]  The number one cause is a stressed out immune system
[03:13:52.580 --> 03:13:55.580]  Especially considering the kind of foods that we're eating
[03:13:55.580 --> 03:13:57.580]  If you're dealing with H. pylori bacteria
[03:13:57.580 --> 03:14:02.580]  This is one of the main reasons why the body goes into a stress response
[03:14:02.580 --> 03:14:06.580]  Address your H. pylori, that means get on probiotics
[03:14:06.580 --> 03:14:08.580]  That means eat fermented foods
[03:14:08.580 --> 03:14:13.580]  That means make sure that you're staying away from anything that has a negative effect on the digestive system
[03:14:13.580 --> 03:14:17.580]  And use apple cider vinegar and digestive enzymes after your meals
[03:14:17.580 --> 03:14:20.580]  If you have your gallbladder, keep it
[03:14:20.580 --> 03:14:24.580]  Focus on fat absorption, that is the absorption of essential fatty acids
[03:14:24.580 --> 03:14:27.580]  And the absorption of fatty vitamins
[03:14:27.580 --> 03:14:30.580]  If somebody tries to talk you into having your gallbladder removed
[03:14:30.580 --> 03:14:34.580]  Don't do it unless you have cancer in there, you need your gallbladder
[03:14:34.580 --> 03:14:39.580]  80 million Americans are dealing with fatty liver disease
[03:14:39.580 --> 03:14:41.580]  If you go to a doctor today he'll tell you
[03:14:41.580 --> 03:14:43.580]  Oh it's just a normal part of aging
[03:14:43.580 --> 03:14:45.580]  No it's not a normal part of aging
[03:14:45.580 --> 03:14:49.580]  In fact they call it non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
[03:14:49.580 --> 03:14:53.580]  They have to distinguish it from the kind of fatty liver disease that you used to have to drink
[03:14:53.580 --> 03:14:55.580]  A pint of Jack Daniels to get
[03:14:55.580 --> 03:14:57.580]  A pint of Jack Daniels every day to get
[03:14:57.580 --> 03:14:59.580]  Today we're all getting that kind of disease
[03:14:59.580 --> 03:15:03.580]  Focus on liver wellness by eliminating processed foods
[03:15:03.580 --> 03:15:07.580]  Make sure you're eating less calories and you're getting more nutrients
[03:15:07.580 --> 03:15:12.580]  And this is one of the major reasons why a nutritional supplement program is so important
[03:15:12.580 --> 03:15:16.580]  Use liquid nutrients and use liquid foods as much as possible
[03:15:16.580 --> 03:15:19.580]  It will remove the load off of your digestive tract
[03:15:19.580 --> 03:15:22.580]  Give yourself a food holiday periodically
[03:15:22.580 --> 03:15:24.580]  Practice intermittent fasting
[03:15:24.580 --> 03:15:29.580]  In fact one of the most anabolic building strategies you could ever use
[03:15:29.580 --> 03:15:31.580]  Is to practice intermittent fasting
[03:15:31.580 --> 03:15:34.580]  Where you take a food holiday, you take a day off from food once a month
[03:15:34.580 --> 03:15:40.580]  Once every couple of weeks it will actually stimulate the production of building hormones
[03:15:40.580 --> 03:15:44.580]  Do everything you can do to turn on the building response
[03:15:44.580 --> 03:15:48.580]  The body is a healing system, it's a regenerating system
[03:15:48.580 --> 03:15:52.580]  You are witness to this healing and regenerating system every time you cut yourself
[03:15:52.580 --> 03:15:54.580]  You can see how the skin heals
[03:15:54.580 --> 03:15:57.580]  Well that same healing system that takes place in the skin
[03:15:57.580 --> 03:16:00.580]  Takes place in the bones, takes place in the digestive tract
[03:16:00.580 --> 03:16:04.580]  Takes place in the nervous system, takes place in the liver and throughout the body
[03:16:04.580 --> 03:16:07.580]  Access this healing response that is your birth right
[03:16:07.580 --> 03:16:11.580]  Nobody has to have a degenerative disease
[03:16:11.580 --> 03:16:17.580]  In fact we know that there is a 1200 different disease states
[03:16:17.580 --> 03:16:21.580]  Well really there is only one disease state and that is the disease of degeneration
[03:16:21.580 --> 03:16:24.580]  And given that the body is a healing and regenerating system
[03:16:24.580 --> 03:16:28.580]  Nobody has to deal with this degenerative process
[03:16:28.580 --> 03:16:31.580]  However we have to participate
[03:16:31.580 --> 03:16:34.580]  We have to take a role in our health
[03:16:34.580 --> 03:16:36.580]  And that means not listening to the medical model
[03:16:36.580 --> 03:16:40.580]  We have more doctors in this country per capita than any other country in the world
[03:16:40.580 --> 03:16:42.580]  Than any other country in the history of the world
[03:16:42.580 --> 03:16:44.580]  We spend more money per capita on health
[03:16:44.580 --> 03:16:49.580]  Yet we are the sickest culture ever in the history of mankind
[03:16:49.580 --> 03:16:53.580]  Clearly the modern medical model has failed us
[03:16:53.580 --> 03:16:58.580]  Ambulatory medicine, not heroic medicine where you get stitched up after you get hit by a car
[03:16:58.580 --> 03:17:02.580]  But ambulatory medicine, this idea that you can go to the doctor for your blood pressure
[03:17:02.580 --> 03:17:04.580]  You can go to the doctor for your depression
[03:17:04.580 --> 03:17:07.580]  You can go to the doctor for whatever kind of illness you have
[03:17:07.580 --> 03:17:10.580]  Ambulatory medicine is not the answer
[03:17:10.580 --> 03:17:13.580]  We are the answer, the divine force is the answer
[03:17:13.580 --> 03:17:16.580]  And it works through simple things like deep breathing
[03:17:16.580 --> 03:17:18.580]  Simple things like getting out in the sun
[03:17:18.580 --> 03:17:20.580]  Simple things like eating whole food
[03:17:20.580 --> 03:17:23.580]  Simple things like getting on a nutritional supplement program
[03:17:23.580 --> 03:17:26.580]  And simple things like spirituality and praying as well
[03:17:26.580 --> 03:17:34.580]  And truly health is a multidimensional process that works spiritually, mentally, emotionally and physically
[03:17:34.580 --> 03:17:36.580]  All the dimensions have to be addressed
[03:17:36.580 --> 03:17:38.580]  Spirituality is your business
[03:17:38.580 --> 03:17:41.580]  Mentality means thinking correct thoughts
[03:17:41.580 --> 03:17:44.580]  Every time you think a thought, Alex, it gets turned into biochemistry
[03:17:44.580 --> 03:17:47.580]  Every time you feel a feeling, it gets turned into biochemistry
[03:17:47.580 --> 03:17:49.580]  So making sure you're thinking clearly
[03:17:49.580 --> 03:17:50.580]  You're not thinking fear thoughts
[03:17:50.580 --> 03:17:52.580]  You're thinking powerful thoughts
[03:17:52.580 --> 03:17:55.580]  Making sure you're addressing the emotional aspects of reality of your life
[03:17:55.580 --> 03:17:59.580]  And making sure that you're focusing on physical well-being
[03:17:59.580 --> 03:18:02.580]  Through the correct foods, through sunlight, through oxygen
[03:18:02.580 --> 03:18:04.580]  And don't forget about a good exercise program
[03:18:04.580 --> 03:18:09.580]  The body thrives under conditions of small amounts of stress
[03:18:09.580 --> 03:18:11.580]  Stress is not a four-letter word
[03:18:11.580 --> 03:18:15.580]  Small amounts of stress actually turn on this building process
[03:18:15.580 --> 03:18:18.580]  The body likes small amounts of stress
[03:18:18.580 --> 03:18:22.580]  And long, luscious, long periods of rest
[03:18:22.580 --> 03:18:24.580]  And this combination of stress and rest
[03:18:24.580 --> 03:18:27.580]  With appropriate nutrition and nutritional strategies
[03:18:27.580 --> 03:18:29.580]  Along with mental and emotional strategies
[03:18:29.580 --> 03:18:31.580]  Is the key to wellness and the key to health
[03:18:31.580 --> 03:18:35.580]  And nobody, nobody, nobody has to deal with degenerative disease
[03:18:35.580 --> 03:18:39.580]  They're all reversible, including cancer, FYI
[03:18:39.580 --> 03:18:41.580]  Amazing information
[03:18:41.580 --> 03:18:43.580]  In fact, let's do one more segment and come back with this
[03:18:43.580 --> 03:18:46.580]  Younggevity news that I've got
[03:18:46.580 --> 03:18:47.580]  Here it is
[03:18:47.580 --> 03:18:49.580]  This is out of Yahoo Finance
[03:18:49.580 --> 03:18:55.580]  AEL International announces results of Younggevity clinical research studies
[03:18:55.580 --> 03:18:59.580]  Performed by Clemson University Institute of Neuromedical Research
[03:18:59.580 --> 03:19:00.580]  Have you seen this?
[03:19:00.580 --> 03:19:01.580]  I love it, Alex
[03:19:01.580 --> 03:19:05.580]  I used to, you know, medical professionals, they need to see paperwork
[03:19:05.580 --> 03:19:06.580]  Fine, there's the paperwork
[03:19:06.580 --> 03:19:08.580]  I've been seeing it for 20 years
[03:19:08.580 --> 03:19:09.580]  The paperwork I get is letters
[03:19:09.580 --> 03:19:10.580]  That's my paperwork
[03:19:10.580 --> 03:19:13.580]  Letters from people who tried to be on tangy tangerines
[03:19:13.580 --> 03:19:15.580]  So now there's credentialed letters
[03:19:15.580 --> 03:19:19.580]  There's credentialed information from Clemson University
[03:19:19.580 --> 03:19:21.580]  And I love it and that's some powerful stuff, Alex
[03:19:21.580 --> 03:19:22.580]  And they're the best

[03:20:45.580 --> 03:20:48.580]  And their program of global eugenics dehumanization

[03:22:34.580 --> 03:22:36.580]  Won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:22:36.580 --> 03:22:38.580]  They've been available since 1986
[03:22:38.580 --> 03:22:41.580]  Yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement
[03:22:41.580 --> 03:22:45.580]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs

[03:23:02.580 --> 03:23:04.580]  How did we ever survive?
[03:23:04.580 --> 03:23:06.580]  From natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy
[03:23:06.580 --> 03:23:08.580]  And the devastating summer drought
[03:23:08.580 --> 03:23:11.580]  To the family hardships brought on by a disastrous economy
[03:23:11.580 --> 03:23:14.580]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything
[03:23:14.580 --> 03:23:17.580]  At eFoods Direct we hear from customers every day

[03:23:21.580 --> 03:23:22.580]  After Hurricane Sandy
[03:23:22.580 --> 03:23:24.580]  Danny from New York City wrote
[03:23:24.580 --> 03:23:26.580]  Almost all the grocery stores are closed
[03:23:26.580 --> 03:23:29.580]  But I managed to get my eFoods just in time
[03:23:29.580 --> 03:23:31.580]  To be able to help my sister and niece
[03:23:31.580 --> 03:23:34.580]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early
[03:23:34.580 --> 03:23:35.580]  Than one day too late
[03:23:35.580 --> 03:23:37.580]  I can warn you but I can't feed you

[03:24:26.580 --> 03:24:44.580]  Yeah the Communist Party USA
[03:24:44.580 --> 03:24:47.580]  Says they want us to turn our guns in
[03:24:47.580 --> 03:24:49.580]  You know they're not going to be turning theirs in
[03:24:49.580 --> 03:24:52.580]  No, no, they keep theirs, you turn yours in
[03:24:52.580 --> 03:24:56.580]  They're real nice people
[03:24:56.580 --> 03:24:58.580]  Oh boy, it doesn't matter, communists have killed
[03:24:58.580 --> 03:25:03.580]  What about seven, eight times worldwide what Hitler did?
[03:25:03.580 --> 03:25:05.580]  Wow, look at that, we ought to put their official logo
[03:25:05.580 --> 03:25:07.580]  In that article we've got linked on Drudge at the top
[03:25:07.580 --> 03:25:10.580]  That one that says CPUSA
[03:25:10.580 --> 03:25:12.580]  And maybe we should slap that right up there
[03:25:12.580 --> 03:25:14.580]  At the top of that article because it really says it all
[03:25:14.580 --> 03:25:16.580]  And hey, they're working with Obama
[03:25:16.580 --> 03:25:18.580]  There he is right there
[03:25:18.580 --> 03:25:20.580]  Oh, we're in a lot of trouble right now
[03:25:20.580 --> 03:25:22.580]  Oh, this is a good image right here
[03:25:22.580 --> 03:25:24.580]  That actually ought to be added right there
[03:25:24.580 --> 03:25:26.580]  That's the one right there
[03:25:26.580 --> 03:25:28.580]  I'm going to have that added to the article
[03:25:28.580 --> 03:25:32.580]  In closing, pharmacist Ben Fuchs is here with us
[03:25:32.580 --> 03:25:35.580]  And this information is just amazing
[03:25:35.580 --> 03:25:38.580]  And he looks 20 years younger than he actually is
[03:25:38.580 --> 03:25:41.580]  Infowarshealth.com
[03:25:41.580 --> 03:25:43.580]  I'm going to get this press release added up there to that site
[03:25:43.580 --> 03:25:45.580]  I'm also going to get it added to Infowars.com
[03:25:45.580 --> 03:25:48.580]  Briefly tell us about the announcement by the
[03:25:48.580 --> 03:25:51.580]  Clinical research studies performed by Clemson University
[03:25:51.580 --> 03:25:54.580]  And what they found about Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[03:25:54.580 --> 03:25:57.580]  And some of the other products at Infowarshealth.com
[03:25:57.580 --> 03:25:59.580]  Let me tell you something, Alex
[03:25:59.580 --> 03:26:02.580]  People always want to know if they want one thing that they could do
[03:26:02.580 --> 03:26:04.580]  Just to see how well this stuff works
[03:26:04.580 --> 03:26:07.580]  And I'm telling you, if you try the Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[03:26:07.580 --> 03:26:10.580]  There's no way you will not become a believer in nutrition
[03:26:10.580 --> 03:26:13.580]  And it's because of this unbelievable concentration of nutrients
[03:26:13.580 --> 03:26:15.580]  In a liquid format
[03:26:15.580 --> 03:26:18.580]  The digestive system, the system that's designed
[03:26:18.580 --> 03:26:21.580]  By nature to absorb nutrients over time
[03:26:21.580 --> 03:26:23.580]  Becomes so overwhelmed that no matter what we're eating
[03:26:23.580 --> 03:26:25.580]  No matter what we're taking
[03:26:25.580 --> 03:26:27.580]  Especially in terms of nutritional supplements that come in pills
[03:26:27.580 --> 03:26:32.580]  And the nutritional value of foods
[03:26:32.580 --> 03:26:34.580]  We don't get the benefit of these things
[03:26:34.580 --> 03:26:36.580]  Because our digestive system starts to break down
[03:26:36.580 --> 03:26:39.580]  When you get your nutrients in a liquid format
[03:26:39.580 --> 03:26:43.580]  Whether you're talking about soups or smoothies
[03:26:43.580 --> 03:26:45.580]  Or vegetable juices
[03:26:45.580 --> 03:26:47.580]  Or the Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[03:26:47.580 --> 03:26:50.580]  You give your body nutrients with no work
[03:26:50.580 --> 03:26:52.580]  That's why when you're sick you want the chicken soup
[03:26:52.580 --> 03:26:54.580]  Exactly
[03:26:54.580 --> 03:26:56.580]  You hit the nail on the head
[03:26:56.580 --> 03:26:58.580]  When you're sick you want the Jewish penicillin
[03:26:58.580 --> 03:27:00.580]  You want the chicken soup
[03:27:00.580 --> 03:27:03.580]  Because you're getting the protein and you're getting the immune factors
[03:27:03.580 --> 03:27:05.580]  And you're getting the sugars
[03:27:05.580 --> 03:27:07.580]  The complex sugars
[03:27:07.580 --> 03:27:09.580]  And you're getting that chemical that's so key
[03:27:09.580 --> 03:27:11.580]  That's in the meat
[03:27:11.580 --> 03:27:13.580]  I'm not sure which one that is
[03:27:13.580 --> 03:27:15.580]  But you're getting lots of great protein in the meat
[03:27:15.580 --> 03:27:17.580]  And you're getting it in a liquid format
[03:27:17.580 --> 03:27:19.580]  You know the one that's in Turkey, it keeps escaping
[03:27:19.580 --> 03:27:21.580]  You're talking about tryptophan
[03:27:21.580 --> 03:27:23.580]  That's the famous tryptophan that we're talking about
[03:27:23.580 --> 03:27:26.580]  And that's why they talk about tryptophan as being a sleepy kind of substance
[03:27:26.580 --> 03:27:28.580]  Because it's so relaxing
[03:27:28.580 --> 03:27:30.580]  That's another story
[03:27:30.580 --> 03:27:32.580]  See how that's the real Prozac right there
[03:27:32.580 --> 03:27:34.580]  That's your natural Prozac
[03:27:34.580 --> 03:27:36.580]  5-HTP and tryptophan
[03:27:36.580 --> 03:27:38.580]  Not that you're sleepy, you've finally gotten relaxed
[03:27:38.580 --> 03:27:40.580]  You're relaxed, exactly
[03:27:40.580 --> 03:27:42.580]  But back to your question about this Clemson study
[03:27:42.580 --> 03:27:44.580]  What they found was
[03:27:44.580 --> 03:27:46.580]  And exactly what I've been saying for years
[03:27:46.580 --> 03:27:48.580]  Since I started using the young Japanese products back in the late 90's
[03:27:48.580 --> 03:27:51.580]  When you take your nutrients in a liquid fashion
[03:27:51.580 --> 03:27:53.580]  You notice results
[03:27:53.580 --> 03:27:55.580]  And you notice them quickly
[03:27:55.580 --> 03:27:57.580]  And the kind of results you get are global results
[03:27:57.580 --> 03:27:59.580]  They're non-specific results
[03:27:59.580 --> 03:28:01.580]  You lose weight
[03:28:01.580 --> 03:28:03.580]  You have more energy
[03:28:03.580 --> 03:28:05.580]  You feel better
[03:28:05.580 --> 03:28:07.580]  You're not sleeping as much
[03:28:07.580 --> 03:28:09.580]  You're not sick as much
[03:28:09.580 --> 03:28:11.580]  That just affect the entire body
[03:28:11.580 --> 03:28:13.580]  And that's why people lose weight without even trying
[03:28:13.580 --> 03:28:15.580]  Do you know, Alex, that's the number one thing people say
[03:28:15.580 --> 03:28:17.580]  When they're on the Beyond Tangy Tangerine
[03:28:17.580 --> 03:28:19.580]  They lost weight and it wasn't even hard
[03:28:19.580 --> 03:28:22.580]  And that is the beauty of a nutritional supplement program
[03:28:22.580 --> 03:28:24.580]  You get healthy
[03:28:24.580 --> 03:28:26.580]  And it doesn't require a lot of work
[03:28:26.580 --> 03:28:28.580]  Because you know what?
[03:28:28.580 --> 03:28:30.580]  It's your birthright
[03:28:30.580 --> 03:28:32.580]  It's our birthright
[03:28:32.580 --> 03:28:35.580]  This healing system is built into every one of the 100 trillion cells of the body
[03:28:35.580 --> 03:28:37.580]  And let nobody tell you
[03:28:37.580 --> 03:28:39.580]  That you have to take a drug
[03:28:39.580 --> 03:28:41.580]  Or you have to have surgery
[03:28:41.580 --> 03:28:43.580]  Or you have to have some doctor's interference
[03:28:43.580 --> 03:28:46.580]  In order for you to be able to access this healing power
[03:28:46.580 --> 03:28:48.580]  Armistice, Ben Fuchs
[03:28:48.580 --> 03:28:50.580]  Thanks for spending an hour and a half with us today
[03:28:50.580 --> 03:28:52.580]  Or almost that much time
[03:28:52.580 --> 03:28:54.580]  And we'll talk to you very, very soon
[03:28:54.580 --> 03:28:56.580]  Thank you for all you do
[03:28:56.580 --> 03:28:58.580]  Thank you, my pleasure, Alex
[03:28:58.580 --> 03:29:00.580]  Alright, folks, that's it for the live segment of the transmission
[03:29:00.580 --> 03:29:02.580]  The in-studio interview with Dr. Jerome Corsi
[03:29:02.580 --> 03:29:04.580]  Halfway in the first hour is coming up
[03:29:04.580 --> 03:29:06.580]  You have your station tuned in and saying, I don't understand
[03:29:06.580 --> 03:29:08.580]  It's been four hours, some days were three hours
[03:29:08.580 --> 03:29:10.580]  Some days were three and a half hours
[03:29:10.580 --> 03:29:12.580]  We sent out four hours
[03:29:12.580 --> 03:29:14.580]  And for, I don't know, 15 years or so
[03:29:14.580 --> 03:29:16.580]  14 years I did three hours
[03:29:16.580 --> 03:29:18.580]  And for a couple years I did
[03:29:18.580 --> 03:29:20.580]  I did four hours
[03:29:20.580 --> 03:29:22.580]  But with the nightly news and the stuff
[03:29:22.580 --> 03:29:24.580]  It just sometimes burned me out too bad
[03:29:24.580 --> 03:29:26.580]  But now that I'm back
[03:29:26.580 --> 03:29:28.580]  I've gotten on vitamins and minerals
[03:29:28.580 --> 03:29:30.580]  I have more energy
[03:29:30.580 --> 03:29:32.580]  So I'm kind of leaning towards four hours
[03:29:32.580 --> 03:29:34.580]  Just officially again
[03:29:34.580 --> 03:29:36.580]  789-9277
[03:29:36.580 --> 03:29:38.580]  888-789-9277
[03:29:38.580 --> 03:29:40.580]  Or 888-636-9277
[03:29:40.580 --> 03:29:42.580]  And get others to go
[03:29:42.580 --> 03:29:44.580]  And sign up as distributors
[03:29:44.580 --> 03:29:46.580]  To get discounts at infowarshealth.com
[03:29:46.580 --> 03:29:48.580]  It is a revolution
[03:29:48.580 --> 03:29:50.580]  Information is power, the people perish
[03:29:50.580 --> 03:30:04.580]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones at the GCN Radio Network
