[00:00.000 --> 00:25.480]  We must be cautious in Austria.
[00:25.480 --> 00:29.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin
[00:29.400 --> 00:35.360]  and I'm your host Alex Jones. It's already the 10th day of June, 2015. Our reporters
[00:35.360 --> 00:40.080]  are now in place. Paul Watson is arriving as we speak in Austria. Of course, Rob Do and
[00:40.080 --> 00:46.920]  Josh Owens have been in place for the last three, four days. They got their Sunday evening
[00:46.920 --> 00:51.320]  and we're going to be breaking down huge developments. The dam has yet again broken
[00:51.320 --> 00:57.320]  on the news blockade on Bilderberg and mainstream media is calling it the most exclusive meeting
[00:57.320 --> 01:01.440]  in the world and admitting that policies being set and now investigations are being
[01:01.440 --> 01:08.840]  called for all over Europe and the UK. There is a news blackout in the United States. They
[01:08.840 --> 01:16.640]  are threatening two weeks in prison and 500 euro fine. If you step foot in the giant exclusion
[01:16.640 --> 01:21.280]  zone, that's now front page in the Austrian newspapers, convicted criminal David Petraeus
[01:21.280 --> 01:26.320]  to represent the US at Bilderberg. We've got Austrians that are really angry on video about
[01:26.320 --> 01:32.960]  the Bilderberg takeover and Paul Watson has done an incredible video, nine minutes, just
[01:32.960 --> 01:38.520]  amazing the focus he's got boiling down their secret agenda and their public agenda. That's
[01:38.520 --> 01:43.320]  coming up. We'll talk to our reporters on the ground and more, but exposing Bilderberg
[01:43.320 --> 01:47.840]  will shoot some major holes in the new order agenda. That's why we're focusing on it because
[01:47.840 --> 01:52.760]  it's a window into the real world and we get the public to wake up to that. It's a big
[01:52.760 --> 01:57.520]  win for humanity. Here's John Bounds report on the background of the Bilderberg group.
[01:57.520 --> 02:05.600]  Welcome to Bilderberg exposed evolution by stealth. Tonight we will examine the influence
[02:05.600 --> 02:11.400]  of the council forum relations on the Bilderberg group and document the objectives of the masters
[02:11.400 --> 02:18.040]  of world domination. In order to fundamentally understand Bilderberg, we must look at the
[02:18.040 --> 02:24.320]  origin and influence of the CFR. The council on forum relations was founded after World
[02:24.320 --> 02:32.120]  War One when Woodrow Wilson tasked his advisor Edward House to create a fellowship of 150
[02:32.120 --> 02:38.200]  scholars to formulate a new foreign policy strategy. From the very beginning, the CFR
[02:38.200 --> 02:44.400]  was committed to a one world government based on a centralized global financial system.
[02:44.400 --> 02:49.800]  A global Congress would need to be assembled. So by invitation only, leaders of the world
[02:49.800 --> 02:57.200]  and industry, politics, media, and royalty were brought in to discuss an extreme secrecy
[02:57.200 --> 03:03.440]  planning related to global domination by the selected elite. The objectives of the Bilderberg
[03:03.440 --> 03:11.200]  group include one set of universal values, control of world public opinion by mind control,
[03:11.200 --> 03:17.880]  an end to the middle class, only rulers and servants, a zero growth society, order out
[03:17.880 --> 03:24.280]  of chaos and perpetual wars, total control of education to program the public mind as
[03:24.280 --> 03:30.920]  a servant class, centralized control of all foreign and domestic policies, impose a UN
[03:30.920 --> 03:38.320]  tax on world citizens, expanding NAFTA in the World Trade Organization globally, and expansion
[03:38.320 --> 03:41.360]  of NATO as a world military.
[03:41.360 --> 03:47.400]  In the 1960s, the attendees included Prince Philip, Paul-Henry Spock, former Secretary
[03:47.400 --> 03:53.040]  General of NATO, former Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, former Secretary of the New Department
[03:53.040 --> 04:00.400]  of Economic Affairs Eric Rohl, former President Gerald Ford, former U.S. Secretary of State
[04:00.400 --> 04:06.520]  Henry Kissinger, former U.S. Secretary of State Christian Herter, and special assistant
[04:06.520 --> 04:12.240]  to the President Charles Douglas Jackson. The final names are especially important as
[04:12.240 --> 04:18.520]  they boldly violated the Logan Act, a U.S. federal law that forbids unauthorized citizens
[04:18.520 --> 04:24.360]  from negotiating with foreign governments. Violation of the Logan Act is a felony punishable
[04:24.360 --> 04:28.240]  under federal law with imprisonment of up to three years.
[04:28.240 --> 04:34.560]  For more information regarding Bilderberg, please visit infowarstore.com and pick up
[04:34.560 --> 04:40.000]  Daniel Estuland's excellent work, The Octopus Deception. Please join us tomorrow when we
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.280]  examine how the Bilderberg Group manufactured the United States Presidents in the 1970s
[04:46.280 --> 04:51.760]  and how these commanders-in-chief conspired with foreign entities illegally to forward
[04:51.760 --> 04:58.240]  the goals of a new world order as the elitist Bilderberg agenda evolves by stealth.
[04:58.240 --> 04:59.240]  We'll be back.
[04:59.240 --> 05:01.040]  This is John Bowne with the Infowars Nightly News.
[05:01.040 --> 05:04.520]  House Speaker Boehner says fast-track legislation will likely be voted on by the House.
[05:04.520 --> 05:10.800]  The only snag they say is working out how they're going to get welfare checks to Americans
[05:10.800 --> 05:16.440]  who are going to lose their jobs. But it's not just jobs and wealth that we're losing.
[05:16.440 --> 05:20.320]  Senator Jeff Sessions, one of the few people in either House of Congress to actually bother
[05:20.320 --> 05:25.400]  to read the secret treaty, is very disturbed by what he's seeing. As he points out, it
[05:25.400 --> 05:31.960]  is a treaty with fast-track. Congress is giving up the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds
[05:31.960 --> 05:36.560]  vote to pass a treaty. But the biggest secret of this secret agreement is that it creates
[05:36.560 --> 05:41.680]  a commission with global governance powers. This commission will be able to modify the
[05:41.680 --> 05:47.000]  treaty without any further input from any country. As Senator Sessions says, Congress
[05:47.000 --> 05:52.440]  would be pre-clearing a political and economic union before a word of that arrangement has
[05:52.440 --> 05:55.440]  been made available to a single private citizen.

[06:56.600 --> 07:03.760]  I am Mark Hattie. I want to reveal this line, line, line, line.
[07:03.760 --> 07:08.520]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[07:08.520 --> 07:13.640]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus. All of
[07:13.640 --> 07:19.120]  our children are hit with modern mind control. Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars,
[07:19.120 --> 07:23.720]  you name it. Young humans have not yet developed their nervous system and are being hammered
[07:23.720 --> 07:28.800]  daily by globalist concoctions. It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and
[07:28.800 --> 07:33.120]  then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs. Working with my team, we set out to find the
[07:33.120 --> 07:37.560]  best formula with the highest quality ingredients that children would actually like and take.
[07:37.560 --> 07:41.120]  We worked with the leading manufacturer in nutritional supplements that are safe for
[07:41.120 --> 07:45.720]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there, introducing
[07:45.720 --> 07:51.200]  child ease with herbs and calming extracts like chamomile and lemon balm and essential
[07:51.200 --> 07:56.920]  nutrients that taste great. Obtain your child ease today at infowarslife.com. That's Child

[08:21.320 --> 08:33.120]  Watson filed a very powerful report this morning at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. Bilderberg
[08:33.120 --> 08:41.080]  2015 to focus on rebranding authoritarianism and in the article and in the video piece
[08:41.080 --> 08:47.320]  that accompanies it, he lays out their secret and their public agenda that are pretty much
[08:47.320 --> 08:51.480]  one and the same. We're going to play that detailed report that really deserves a lot
[08:51.480 --> 09:02.840]  of attention here in just a moment. Then we're going to be talking to our reporters from
[09:02.840 --> 09:08.320]  Austria at the bottom of the hour, Rob Do and Josh Owens, about the major developments
[09:08.320 --> 09:16.880]  that have been unfolding. There is huge international coverage now of Bilderberg with headlines like
[09:16.880 --> 09:24.560]  just who exactly is going to Bilderberg meeting. Bilderberg, who's missing from the guest list
[09:24.560 --> 09:28.640]  for this year's most exclusive gathering, London Telegraph, and those are just some
[09:28.640 --> 09:37.200]  of the English speaking papers, the English language papers that are breaking it down.
[09:37.200 --> 09:42.000]  It is all over the German, Austrian, Spanish, Greece, Russian, you name it, pointing out
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.800]  that it's violating all sorts of federal laws in our country and others to have politicians
[09:47.800 --> 09:55.920]  meeting to set policy in secret. Every country has laws against this for obvious reasons.
[09:55.920 --> 09:58.840]  Because there's no record, just like there's a congressional record or even if there's
[09:58.840 --> 10:03.320]  a secret committee there's got to be a record of what was discussed and then 20 years later
[10:03.320 --> 10:08.760]  it's supposed to be released because obviously operating in secret you can and will have
[10:08.760 --> 10:15.840]  internal takeovers. You've got people sitting over trillions of dollars of budgets and they're
[10:15.840 --> 10:23.960]  secret and they can keep reclassifying stuff 50, 60 years out as they do now. It's just
[10:23.960 --> 10:27.240]  absolutely criminal. Here's Paul Watson's report and we'll get into all the other
[10:27.240 --> 10:28.240]  news.
[10:28.240 --> 10:33.560]  The Bilderberg group has released its full participant list and agenda for the 2015 elitist
[10:33.560 --> 10:39.920]  confab days before it's set to begin in Austria. But as ever the topics up for discussion are
[10:39.920 --> 10:46.440]  so vague as to almost be meaningless. And we know that many of the most sensitive topics
[10:46.440 --> 10:53.640]  never appear on the list in the first place. So what's the real agenda of Bilderberg 2015?
[10:53.640 --> 10:59.840]  For a start it's unusual that Bilderberg is taking place after the G7 conference. It's
[10:59.840 --> 11:04.360]  normally the other way around. This suggests that Bilderberg's role in not only setting
[11:04.360 --> 11:10.520]  the consensus but making the final call on many of these issues will be pivotal this
[11:10.520 --> 11:15.520]  year. The intense security surrounding the Interalpen Hotel with our reporters Rob Dew
[11:15.520 --> 11:21.480]  and Josh Owens already having been harassed numerous times by police illustrates how paranoid
[11:21.480 --> 11:27.440]  Bilderberg are about keeping the details of their agenda under wraps. Artificial intelligence
[11:27.440 --> 11:33.080]  will be one of the core discussion topics at Bilderberg 2015. And one of the most interesting
[11:33.080 --> 11:39.160]  newbies in terms of Bilderberg attendees is undoubtedly Regina Duggan, former dopper
[11:39.160 --> 11:46.480]  director and now Google executive and a pioneer of ingestible ID microchips. Duggan along
[11:46.480 --> 11:52.240]  with Google chairman Eric Schmidt and Demis Hassabis vice president of engineering for
[11:52.240 --> 11:59.120]  Google DeepMind will scheme with global power brokers on how to grease the skids for public
[11:59.120 --> 12:06.280]  acceptance and adoption of big brother technology that otherwise wouldn't look out of place
[12:06.280 --> 12:13.480]  in a dystopian sci-fi thriller. This all ties into Bilderberg's overarching goal of rebranding
[12:13.480 --> 12:18.760]  authoritarianism. As a result of endless money printing and growing wealth inequality the
[12:18.760 --> 12:25.000]  global elite has created the preconditions for widespread riots and civil unrest. We
[12:25.000 --> 12:30.320]  already had a taste of this with Ferguson and Baltimore. Now the wealthy are buying
[12:30.320 --> 12:37.280]  safe rooms and secret hideaways in remote locations as they prepare to hunker down for
[12:37.280 --> 12:42.240]  the next stage of the economic collapse. And Bloomberg is now reporting that Johann Rupert,
[12:42.240 --> 12:47.800]  the billionaire owner of Cartier, is worried about artificial intelligence and robots replacing
[12:47.800 --> 12:54.800]  human workers causing class warfare and social disorder. Make no mistake, Bilderberg wants
[12:54.800 --> 13:01.400]  class warfare. They want riots because this allows the elite to exploit the chaos, poses
[13:01.400 --> 13:07.760]  the saviours and introduce the solution of statist and economic totalitarianism. And
[13:07.760 --> 13:12.680]  if you want to get true insight into what motivates Bilderberg, look no further than
[13:12.680 --> 13:18.720]  the guy who calls the shots, Henry Kissinger. All the other Bilderberg attendees, Bar David
[13:18.720 --> 13:24.120]  Rockefeller, show deference to the National Security Advisor. Kissinger has always been
[13:24.120 --> 13:30.360]  an aggressive advocate of real politic, an amoral Machiavellian form of diplomacy and
[13:30.360 --> 13:36.320]  policymaking which eschews morality and ethical considerations. And of course Kissinger has
[13:36.320 --> 13:43.040]  been implicated in numerous war crimes, crimes against humanity, kidnap, torture and murder
[13:43.040 --> 13:48.600]  in places like Chile, Cambodia and East Timor. But what's most alarming is the fact that
[13:48.600 --> 13:56.920]  the 92 year old Kissinger still advises the Obama administration today. He's been lobbying
[13:56.920 --> 14:03.360]  for years for regime change in Syria, which may at some stage be achieved as a result
[14:03.360 --> 14:09.760]  of ISIS created partly as a result of the US arming other jihadist groups in the region,
[14:09.760 --> 14:15.360]  taking over half the country, something the Syrian rebels could never accomplish.
[14:15.360 --> 14:20.960]  Under the guise of stopping terror financing to ISIS, which only seems to have become stronger
[14:20.960 --> 14:26.920]  since the US and others began officially targeting the terror organization, Bilderberg will discuss
[14:26.920 --> 14:34.480]  imposing harsher bank restrictions, eviscerating whatever financial privacy we have left, as
[14:34.480 --> 14:42.680]  well as a coordinated EU crackdown on the sale of precious metals. This ties in to the wider
[14:42.680 --> 14:51.000]  war on cash. Numerous voices have recently called for eliminating physical currency altogether,
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.360]  giving central banks and governments the power to directly control your finances under the
[14:56.360 --> 15:03.480]  justification of preventing an economic collapse. At its most authoritarian extreme, this means
[15:03.480 --> 15:10.440]  having to obtain government permission every time you withdraw or spend a moderately large
[15:10.440 --> 15:16.240]  sum of money. France is already set to introduce laws in September, which will restrict French
[15:16.240 --> 15:23.160]  citizens from making cash payments over 1,000 euros. Bilderberg is set to intensify this
[15:23.160 --> 15:29.520]  crackdown on cash. Preventing Greece from ditching the euro and stacking the deck against the
[15:29.520 --> 15:35.800]  EU referendum outvote in the United Kingdom will also be a core centerpiece of Bilderberg's
[15:35.800 --> 15:42.840]  agenda going forward over the next 12 months. The EU and the single currency is a pet project
[15:42.840 --> 15:49.960]  of Bilderberg. If that pillar of world government begins to crumble, it undermines the rest
[15:49.960 --> 15:56.520]  of the architecture of global government, including TPP, which again, despite not being
[15:56.520 --> 16:01.840]  on the official list, will be discussed by Bilderberg members. TPP could also be used
[16:01.840 --> 16:07.520]  to sneak through draconian climate change regulations under the radar. Bilderberg is
[16:07.520 --> 16:13.800]  scheming ways of how to bypass Congress and directly implement the post-industrial revolution
[16:13.800 --> 16:20.520]  that they've been pushing for over a decade. These measures, if fully implemented, will
[16:20.520 --> 16:27.480]  bankrupt the United States, cost millions of jobs, and force the country into deindustrialized
[16:27.480 --> 16:32.880]  debt slavery. Geopolitically, Bilderberg will also put pressure on recalcitrant European
[16:32.880 --> 16:40.680]  countries like Austria to further isolate Russia while encouraging the arming of Kiev-backed
[16:40.680 --> 16:49.000]  militias. Don't be surprised to see a major confrontation between NATO and the US before
[16:49.000 --> 16:56.200]  the end of the year as a result of this agenda. After slamming the G7 as authoritarian rule,
[16:56.200 --> 17:03.280]  China has also been completely frozen out of representation at Bilderberg 2015. The hegemonic
[17:03.280 --> 17:10.040]  importance of targeting Beijing's influence in the South China Sea, again, potentially
[17:10.040 --> 17:17.120]  risking a devastating confrontation, will be emphasized at Bilderberg 2015.
[17:17.120 --> 17:21.440]  Another topic up for discussion is the US presidential election. Let's not forget that
[17:21.440 --> 17:28.960]  Bilderberg almost certainly acted as kingmaker back in 2008 when both Barack Obama and Hillary
[17:28.960 --> 17:34.320]  Clinton were strongly rumored to have paid a visit to the conference in Chantilly, Virginia.
[17:34.320 --> 17:40.760]  The attendance of Jim Messina of the Messina Group, the organization that ran Obama's 2012
[17:40.760 --> 17:49.040]  re-election campaign, proves that Hillary is Bilderberg's pick for 2016. Messina is
[17:49.040 --> 17:56.480]  now advising Hillary Clinton. His presence at Bilderberg will be focused around ensuring
[17:56.480 --> 18:02.880]  none of Hillary's potential challenges get the big bucks from the innumerable transnational
[18:02.880 --> 18:07.760]  banks and corporations that will be represented at the secretive confab.
[18:07.760 --> 18:14.200]  So in summary, Bilderberg's 2015 talking points and agenda for the next 12 months. Further
[18:14.200 --> 18:21.320]  isolating Russia over Ukraine, arming Ukrainian militias and potentially stoking a major confrontation
[18:21.320 --> 18:28.320]  with NATO, strangling financial support for Hillary Clinton's potential 2016 presidential
[18:28.320 --> 18:33.880]  competitors, the elites positioning themselves as financial saviours when more riots and
[18:33.880 --> 18:42.960]  civil unrest unfold, moving towards the abolition of cash and imposing economic totalitarianism,
[18:42.960 --> 18:50.720]  discrediting the out-campaign for the United Kingdom's EU referendum, rebranding authoritarianism
[18:50.720 --> 18:59.200]  in anticipation of the coming economic collapse, finalizing the TPP as the next pillar of global
[18:59.200 --> 19:05.720]  government, dismantling China and the BRICS country's ability to challenge the unipolar
[19:05.720 --> 19:12.920]  system, selling artificial intelligence and Big Brother surveillance as trendy and cool
[19:12.920 --> 19:19.280]  in order to fool the general public into adopting technology that will eviscerate their financial
[19:19.280 --> 19:22.120]  livelihoods and personal privacy.
[19:22.120 --> 19:29.000]  So that's what we know so far about the real agenda behind Bilderberg 2015, with more leaks
[19:29.000 --> 19:34.400]  and information to come. I'll be travelling out to Austria to join info wars reporters
[19:34.400 --> 19:40.240]  Rob Dew and Josh Owens, so be sure to check out the other videos on this channel and
[19:40.240 --> 19:45.400]  the Alex Jones channel as we lead the coverage for Bilderberg 2015.
[19:45.400 --> 19:52.280]  Excellent job Paul Joseph Watson, he's now in Austria, he's now on the ground, he may
[19:52.280 --> 19:57.720]  even be joining us coming up here in about 10 minutes from our live feed on top the hotel.

[21:59.720 --> 22:03.840]  Honey, it's time for dinner. What are you doing over there on your computer?
[22:03.840 --> 22:08.840]  I'm shopping for a new wallet. Mine is falling apart. Hey, did you know there's a company
[22:08.840 --> 22:12.760]  called ID Stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[22:12.760 --> 22:17.200]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing. What is that?
[22:17.200 --> 22:21.320]  Well, apparently, many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips
[22:21.320 --> 22:25.880]  inside them called RFID that transmit our banking information to card readers when
[22:25.880 --> 22:30.360]  we pay. Unfortunately, a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the
[22:30.360 --> 22:34.560]  city scanning people, collecting their credit card numbers and personal information without
[22:34.560 --> 22:39.440]  us knowing it. Wow, that sounds scary. Since you're getting a new wallet anyway, you should
[22:39.440 --> 22:43.080]  definitely get an ID Stronghold shielded wallet. Are they more expensive?
[22:43.080 --> 22:48.080]  No. In fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from IDStronghold.com for the same price
[22:48.080 --> 22:51.160]  or less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores.
[22:51.160 --> 22:55.600]  Sounds great. My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out too. I want to
[22:55.600 --> 22:59.760]  be protected and these wallets at IDStronghold.com look fantastic.

[24:13.480 --> 24:18.000]  We are on the march. The globalists are on the run, but they're fleeing forward trying
[24:18.000 --> 24:23.440]  to accelerate and submit their plans that are in deep trouble in the process of trying
[24:23.440 --> 24:29.920]  to establish an open, fascist planetary government. They are endangering the entire globe. We've
[24:29.920 --> 24:34.960]  got more economists, more experts coming out saying they believe we're going to have World
[24:34.960 --> 24:43.760]  War III. The owner of Alibaba, arguably bigger than Amazon, is coming out saying he thinks
[24:43.760 --> 24:49.800]  World War III is coming and it's a good thing. This shows the delusional, crazy town stuff
[24:49.800 --> 24:55.320]  that's starting to go on with these elites. I don't care how many mansions you've got
[24:55.320 --> 25:02.560]  or how many underground bunkers or jet copters or how many mistresses these people may have.
[25:02.560 --> 25:07.800]  World War III is something the planet probably won't survive much less you, but they're
[25:07.800 --> 25:16.200]  megalomaniacs and they've lost connection to reality. I mean, Hitler wasn't a novice.
[25:16.200 --> 25:23.400]  He was a combat vet of World War I, but he still became delusional and bent off more
[25:23.400 --> 25:31.400]  than he could chew. I mean, he had 70 million Germans total and he thought he was going
[25:31.400 --> 25:41.960]  to take over billions of people. They had a good go, but the delusion soon wore off.
[25:41.960 --> 25:45.320]  And these elites today, I mean almost every elite ends up getting crazy at the end of
[25:45.320 --> 25:49.880]  an empire and they always start wars, they end up losing. And now if we have this happen,
[25:49.880 --> 25:59.960]  it's goodbye. Goodbye will be the dead planet. I mean, life will reconstitute itself and creep
[25:59.960 --> 26:06.160]  back who knows how many hundreds of thousands of years it'll take. Bacteria and insects
[26:06.160 --> 26:11.520]  and things will continue on, but goodbye planet earth. For all intents and purposes they want
[26:11.520 --> 26:17.040]  to trash this sucker out big time. Like a spoiled rock band throwing television sets
[26:17.040 --> 26:28.200]  off the 25th floor. In the second hour, I'm going to cover the geopolitical news, the
[26:28.200 --> 26:36.560]  economic news. It's all very intense. We're going to hit Bilderberg this hour. Then in
[26:36.560 --> 26:41.440]  the third hour, trends forecaster Gerald Salente joins us with his latest trend projections,
[26:41.440 --> 26:46.400]  his take on Bilderberg, the TPP and more. Always enjoy having Gerald Salente on his
[26:46.400 --> 26:54.800]  new trends. Journal is out. Spring edition liars, cowers, freaks and fools spent on a
[26:54.800 --> 27:02.720]  while. Welcome to the presidential reality show. Let me just give you some of the headlines
[27:02.720 --> 27:09.160]  that are here. I've probably said this 500, 600 times in the last four years that they
[27:09.160 --> 27:13.400]  would end up sending al-Qaeda into Syria and other areas. They were then given the weapons
[27:13.400 --> 27:18.880]  in Benghazi and then they will end up attacking the west. That'll be used to take our liberties.
[27:18.880 --> 27:25.000]  When they shoot up a shopping mall or a high school or a convention center, I predicted
[27:25.000 --> 27:30.680]  that. The calls will be to restrict our second amendments. Well, it wasn't hard to predict
[27:30.680 --> 27:37.600]  this to London independence today. ISIS dirty bomb. Jihadists have seized enough radioactive
[27:37.600 --> 27:45.320]  material to build their first WMD when our own government created this organization and
[27:45.320 --> 27:49.600]  changed their name to ISIS to confuse the public when the military said they wouldn't
[27:49.600 --> 27:55.240]  be part of it. But it's now been not just leaked, but defense intelligence confirmed
[27:55.240 --> 28:01.280]  those documents a month ago and declassified that they quote predicted that arming the
[28:01.280 --> 28:08.840]  rebels would create a Salafist state in the area. So they kind of hedged their bet and
[28:08.840 --> 28:14.120]  complained at the time and said, we don't want to do this. Was that moral? Was it Machiavellian?
[28:14.120 --> 28:19.240]  Whatever, it's the same thing. Our criminal government armed al-Qaeda and then changed
[28:19.240 --> 28:33.120]  their name to confuse the public. Coming up, we're going to get to Syrian rebels. They're
[28:33.120 --> 28:37.160]  taking control of the country. They're winning because they ran back into Iraq, got secretly
[28:37.160 --> 28:41.960]  supplied by NATO and they're going in hard. So they can chop off every Christian's head
[28:41.960 --> 28:46.960]  they find, throw people off roofs, just murder everyone. Oh, if you're a homosexual, you're
[28:46.960 --> 28:52.680]  dead, but no feminist, no liberal. That's okay because it's trendy, it's sexy, it's cool
[28:52.680 --> 28:58.720]  the White House is doing this. It's anti-Western. You go out to any communist march and there'll
[28:58.720 --> 29:06.240]  be a bunch of radical jihadis with them. With women screaming white women, white privilege,
[29:06.240 --> 29:15.720]  white men are pigs, all males are bad. I love Stalin, I love Satan, I love Mao. When the
[29:15.720 --> 29:20.000]  jihadis would sexually mutilate them and put a bag over their head if they were lucky.
[29:20.000 --> 29:28.720]  But they love that because it's destructive and evil. The West, with women empowered,
[29:28.720 --> 29:33.800]  they want to dominate it and wreck it so they can be overrun and put in slave pits with
[29:33.800 --> 29:39.840]  bags on their heads. They can't drive cars. That's their dream. They have bags put on
[29:39.840 --> 29:45.080]  their heads to be sexually mutilated and not be able to drive a car and be beaten and raped.
[29:45.080 --> 29:50.440]  They love it. They hate the country that gave them the freedom. But the bags stay with us.
[29:50.440 --> 30:15.840]  Here on the March, the Empire's on the Run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:15.840 --> 30:20.280]  Regular attendee David Petraeus will be there with his Get Out of Jail card. Courtesy of
[30:20.280 --> 30:25.320]  pals like Tony Blair, who put in a good word for him when he leaked reams of classified
[30:25.320 --> 30:29.880]  documents as long as he doesn't reveal any Bilderberg secrets. And of course there's
[30:29.880 --> 30:34.080]  the heads of banks who've recently been caught rigging interest rates with LIBOR, rigging
[30:34.080 --> 30:39.400]  currency exchanges, commodity rates, pretty much rigging every market and getting caught
[30:39.400 --> 30:43.640]  money laundering but just getting off with a slap on the wrist. Where are the police?
[30:43.640 --> 30:48.680]  If you have a party at your home and there comes a burglar, it's also your private home.
[30:48.680 --> 30:52.800]  And we save it. Somebody needs to keep an eye on these crooks.

[33:33.520 --> 33:38.800]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. We return weeknight at
[33:38.800 --> 33:43.400]  7 o'clock with infowarsnightlynews. Also do an abbreviated two-hour transmission live
[33:43.400 --> 33:50.560]  every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. And of course, routinely, David Knight comes and co-hosts the broadcast
[33:50.560 --> 34:00.160]  with us as well. We have three of our great reporters in the field in Austria right now
[34:00.160 --> 34:09.120]  covering Bilderberg 2015. And I think it's important just to take a deep breath and to
[34:09.120 --> 34:18.120]  pull back and to observe the planet and who's controlling it. Kit Daniels has an excellent
[34:18.120 --> 34:28.240]  article up on infowars.com that is so important. Dealing with the quotes, the evil quotes
[34:28.240 --> 34:37.840]  of Bilderberg and then linking to where members of Bilderberg made these statements. The headline
[34:37.840 --> 34:43.840]  is the most evil quotes from Bilderberg and Siders. There's another article, The Spirit
[34:43.840 --> 34:49.720]  of Jim Tucker, seen at Bilderberg 2015. And it's an allegory. We're not saying we actually
[34:49.720 --> 34:56.560]  saw Casper the Friendly Guest. Another video, Austrian's Mad as Hell at Bilderberg 2015.
[34:56.560 --> 35:04.360]  Convicted criminal David Petraeus to represent U.S. at Bilderberg. 500 euro fine or two weeks
[35:04.360 --> 35:09.960]  in prison for entering giant exclusion zone, security zone at Bilderberg. That is such
[35:09.960 --> 35:16.640]  important news. Bilderberg 2015 to focus on rebranding authoritarianism with a very important
[35:16.640 --> 35:21.000]  video that we aired earlier where Watson breaks it all down. It's most important nine minutes
[35:21.000 --> 35:27.440]  on Bilderberg out there. How they want to bring in a planetary government with carbon
[35:27.440 --> 35:34.240]  taxes and computer systems with smart dust as they call it, RFID in everything, tracking
[35:34.240 --> 35:40.080]  the internet of things, taxing, micromanaging, shutting down local farming, shutting down
[35:40.080 --> 35:48.480]  community centers, shutting down anything independent. A cashless society, tracking everything you
[35:48.480 --> 35:55.320]  do and then taxing the daylights out of you. And gaming the economies like they game interest
[35:55.320 --> 36:00.640]  rates, currency rates, and the stock markets. That's all admitted. And you look at who's
[36:00.640 --> 36:05.880]  at this meeting. These are the people that own Dutch Royal Shell and BP. And their wealth
[36:05.880 --> 36:10.360]  are state secrets like Queen Beatrix. These are the people that are financing through
[36:10.360 --> 36:16.160]  their foundations like Ford and Rockefeller and Carnegie taking our guns, breaking up
[36:16.160 --> 36:26.360]  the family, demonizing men as good role models. They are the engines and they are the captains.
[36:26.360 --> 36:34.720]  They are the system of anti human extremism for a global decline. They publicly say zero
[36:34.720 --> 36:41.680]  growth. They want a decline into what they call neo feudalism where they get the life
[36:41.680 --> 36:46.080]  extension. They get the power. They get to live in the countryside and beautiful complexes
[36:46.080 --> 37:06.000]  because we live in giant mega city presence. This is the group openly funding ISIS at
[37:06.000 --> 37:12.240]  Al Qaeda to destabilize and bring in fear so they can bring in the solution. This is
[37:12.240 --> 37:19.520]  the group openly funding civil unrest and destabilization. This is the group. And you
[37:19.520 --> 37:24.680]  look at the members of it, they are mainly just super gophers for the royalty and the
[37:24.680 --> 37:30.080]  top controllers who also attend, who then go out and have their legions of minions
[37:30.080 --> 37:38.320]  under them. It's a major summit where they fine tune existing global treaties, corporate
[37:38.320 --> 37:45.760]  treaties from the different corporate houses and the different imperial families that sit
[37:45.760 --> 37:52.760]  behind those houses. When I say imperial, I mean the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers,
[37:52.760 --> 37:59.480]  the Lee family in China, the Japanese royalty. You look at who runs this whole show, folks.
[37:59.480 --> 38:06.120]  They are anti human demons who come from lines of genetic psychopaths. And so they're
[38:06.120 --> 38:13.160]  willing and able and hungry and desire secretive control. But the minute you blast them with
[38:13.160 --> 38:21.360]  spotlights of truth, I love to be out in the sun. It feels good. I enjoy it. The globalists
[38:21.360 --> 38:29.760]  don't like it. And I mean that is an allegory. Their skin burns like vampires. The light
[38:29.760 --> 38:36.680]  of truth hits them. They start to fry. And we're there frying them right now because
[38:36.680 --> 38:40.440]  they are the ones attacking us. They're the ones in our face. They're the ones that have
[38:40.440 --> 38:52.160]  committed all these crimes. I mean, go read their unbelievable quotes. I'm going to cover
[38:52.160 --> 38:58.240]  other news like West Coast of North America to be slammed in 2016 with 80% as much Fukushima
[38:58.240 --> 39:03.720]  radiation as Japan. Clearing your browser history can be deemed obstruction of justice
[39:03.720 --> 39:07.800]  in the U.S. Even though you got to clear the cookies and stuff to get better deals on the
[39:07.800 --> 39:12.680]  Internet, doesn't matter. It's criminal. They can indict you and send you to 20 years in
[39:12.680 --> 39:19.440]  prison for it. We're going to be covering that. There is no law. They just deem it misapply
[39:19.440 --> 39:30.320]  and then have a kangaroo jury sends you down the river. Oh, but don't worry, evil tyranny
[39:30.320 --> 39:38.520]  of this level will burn and drown everyone involved in it as well. The gun of oppression
[39:38.520 --> 39:46.920]  kicks as hard as it shoots. The lovers of tyranny, the lovers of death will get to drink
[39:46.920 --> 39:59.280]  deeply from the cups they've poured. Now joining us from outside the security perimeter where
[39:59.280 --> 40:06.920]  you get two weeks in prison and fines has been reported by the main Austrian news. Dinosaur
[40:06.920 --> 40:15.920]  media has been embarrassed now by info wars.com and drugs report.com into reporting massive
[40:15.920 --> 40:20.200]  coverage all over the European press and all over the U.K. press. Joining us the latest
[40:20.200 --> 40:26.680]  developments is Paul Watson and we'll talk to Josh Owens and Rob Dew. Paul Watson, what
[40:26.680 --> 40:30.400]  are your observations? Did you have trouble getting in? What are you witnessing?
[40:30.400 --> 40:35.360]  No, it was actually really smooth getting in, Alex. What I noticed is there is a police
[40:35.360 --> 40:42.560]  presence now at the airport. It's full of cops. There was one security official at the airport
[40:42.560 --> 40:47.440]  going around with a camera. He gave me some funny looks. I don't know if that's related.
[40:47.440 --> 40:52.480]  But what stands out to me is Bilderberg is where the real power lies because we saw how
[40:52.480 --> 40:57.880]  the journalists were treated at the G7 conference. Literally they were pampered like royalty.
[40:57.880 --> 41:03.080]  They had food tables. They had relaxation rooms. They were even given goodie bags with
[41:03.080 --> 41:08.200]  free t-shirts. They were completely pampered. And yet what's happened here, we've seen
[41:08.200 --> 41:13.440]  with Josh and Rob, completely harassed every single day. Now we've got reports from Josh
[41:13.440 --> 41:16.960]  Owens. And they've been going after Guardian reporters as well. So the biggest paper, not
[41:16.960 --> 41:24.160]  just in the U.K. but in Europe, they're harassing them as well. So total 180.
[41:24.160 --> 41:29.080]  Total flip. And people say, oh, it's just a game of golf. It's just a talking shop. No.
[41:29.080 --> 41:36.040]  The talking shop is the G7. That's the puppet show. This is where the real power is in evidence
[41:36.040 --> 41:41.320]  because it's a giant lobbying organization. And again, Charlie Skelton reported about
[41:41.320 --> 41:45.840]  30 minutes ago that people who he's with, other journalists, are now going out and
[41:45.840 --> 41:49.760]  buying groceries in their own hotel, which is completely away from the Bilderberg hotel
[41:49.760 --> 41:55.200]  outside the perimeter, being approached by cops in the car park and being asked to search
[41:55.200 --> 42:00.480]  their vehicle and basically ask questions, ask for their passport again. So they've kind
[42:00.480 --> 42:05.080]  of restricted the security perimeter somewhat, but they're still harassing journalists to
[42:05.080 --> 42:10.200]  an even greater extent, which again proves that this is the real center of power. They're
[42:10.200 --> 42:15.480]  really nervous about anything whatsoever leaking out of this conference because it holds more
[42:15.480 --> 42:19.840]  sway than the G7 puppet show.
[42:19.840 --> 42:24.400]  We debated this year going to Bilderberg because we have exposed it. We already have sources.
[42:24.400 --> 42:29.840]  We know their agenda. We will be able to report remotely. And it's very expensive to send
[42:29.840 --> 42:34.120]  three reporters, but I decided to do it because we're really beginning to have victory over
[42:34.120 --> 42:35.120]  these people.
[42:35.120 --> 42:40.400]  They understand that informationally, if we can identify them with the public, it begins
[42:40.400 --> 42:44.840]  to move them into check and then checkmate. That's why they're so desperate. They've been
[42:44.840 --> 42:50.440]  indicted before for Lockheed scandals. They've been indicted in worldwide fund scams. I mean,
[42:50.440 --> 42:58.120]  this is really a nasty group. This is Mafia 2.0, but really what's new is really old.
[42:58.120 --> 43:06.600]  This is the original Mafia. This is the proto-Mafia and they cannot survive exposure. But if you
[43:06.600 --> 43:11.880]  look at how they're behaving here, it just shows that they can't help but act authoritarian
[43:11.880 --> 43:17.280]  because it's their arrogant, disconnected nature. It's so many years. People that work
[43:17.280 --> 43:22.760]  at the hotel won't talk to us when we go into the hotel a week before, days before, but
[43:22.760 --> 43:27.920]  then after the Bilderberg group is so rude to them, they will then come and meet with
[43:27.920 --> 43:34.560]  us at local pubs or other hangouts and give us the intel we need. That's why they don't
[43:34.560 --> 43:38.840]  let us in a week, a week and a half before at the hotel now. It's why they've got a security
[43:38.840 --> 43:43.480]  perimeter miles and miles out because they know we're doing old-fashioned journalism
[43:43.480 --> 43:47.520]  of, hey, listen, here's a nice tip for dinner. You're going to have some really evil people
[43:47.520 --> 43:50.800]  here in a week. They'll look at you weird. I can't talk to you about that. Well, just
[43:50.800 --> 43:54.040]  listen. When they won't let you look them in the eyes, when you hear them talking about
[43:54.040 --> 43:59.000]  planetary tyranny and when they're really rude to you and hateful and don't tip you,
[43:59.000 --> 44:04.240]  just know these are the global mafia. Google Bilderberg. Do your research. Decide what's
[44:04.240 --> 44:07.960]  best to do and if you just want to let these criminals get away with this or if you want
[44:07.960 --> 44:12.400]  to give us information and we would always get incredible information. To the point,
[44:12.400 --> 44:17.880]  we're followed at all times by Spooks when we're there. Jim Tucker is followed continually.
[44:17.880 --> 44:23.440]  They wait outside his hotel room. They break in his hotel room. They bug his hotel room.
[44:23.440 --> 44:28.080]  So that's why they're trying to keep you back because they are deathly afraid that we're
[44:28.080 --> 44:31.960]  going to learn about the criminal activities going on inside. Paul Watson.
[44:31.960 --> 44:37.000]  No, they're kind of flipping back to the model they had in Greece. I think it was Vula
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.360]  Mayny 2009 where they literally, you know, follow people around the town, secret spies
[44:42.360 --> 44:46.760]  following them in and out of their hotels. You know, that blew up in their faces. After
[44:46.760 --> 44:51.600]  that, they kind of relented a bit. Watford and Copenhagen was very much more relaxed.
[44:51.600 --> 44:56.480]  So they now seem to be flipping back to that paradigm where they're completely paranoid
[44:56.480 --> 45:01.720]  about journalists getting anywhere near this conference because this, again, is where the
[45:01.720 --> 45:09.080]  real power is wielded. We got more information on the agenda coming out. Klaus Kleinfield,
[45:09.080 --> 45:15.480]  who is the head of Alcoa, he is there representing the business roundtable. Now, of course, from
[45:15.480 --> 45:20.320]  the Bilderbergs official website, they claim that they're not discussing the TPP, which
[45:20.320 --> 45:24.760]  is complete nonsense because, you know, there are numerous heads of major corporations there,
[45:24.760 --> 45:29.800]  right as this deal is set to be authorized with a fast track with the TPA, which could
[45:29.800 --> 45:34.720]  come down as soon as Thursday. So Klaus Kleinfield, who is a regular Bilderberg
[45:34.720 --> 45:40.080]  attendee, is there. He represents the business roundtable. Now, if you go on the business
[45:40.080 --> 45:46.400]  roundtable group's website, basically 75% of it is devoted to lobbying for the passage
[45:46.400 --> 45:54.600]  of the TPP. The people involved in the business roundtable control $7.2 trillion in annual
[45:54.600 --> 45:59.560]  revenue, and he's there lobbying on their behalf with all these finance ministers with
[45:59.560 --> 46:04.120]  these heads of state at Bilderberg. So again, you know, just a talking shop, nothing going
[46:04.120 --> 46:09.680]  on there. Also, ISIS in the news today, we've seen it was top of the George report earlier
[46:09.680 --> 46:16.400]  today, ISIS planning dirty bomb. Obviously, we have John Allen attending Bilderberg this
[46:16.400 --> 46:22.880]  year. He's the specialist head of combating ISIS for the US. Again, allied with the release
[46:22.880 --> 46:29.040]  of this Pentagon document, which said that they knew arming jihadists in Syria and Libya
[46:29.040 --> 46:34.480]  would create this Salafist principality. In other words, ISIS, they knew that would
[46:34.480 --> 46:38.960]  take place and they wanted it to take place in order to topple Assad, which they couldn't
[46:38.960 --> 46:44.600]  get done before. Now ISIS controls half of Syria, that agenda is going through. So he's
[46:44.600 --> 46:51.120]  going to be there discussing that. We've got Ryanair's Michael O'Leary. The Independent
[46:51.120 --> 46:55.640]  wrote a kind of sophomoric jokie article about how the fact that Michael O'Leary is there
[46:55.640 --> 47:00.120]  means that this is nonsense, and because he's seen as quite an ostentatious character
[47:00.120 --> 47:06.680]  in the United Kingdom, but he's been a public advocate aggressively of the United Kingdom
[47:06.680 --> 47:12.160]  staying in the European Union. So he's going to be there talking, discussing about how
[47:12.160 --> 47:19.240]  to discredit the out campaign when that vote on the EU referendum comes up before 2017,
[47:19.240 --> 47:23.800]  because that's what they did at Bilderberg in previous years with Ireland with the Lisbon
[47:23.800 --> 47:29.120]  Treaty. They schemed how to discredit the no campaign in that. Eventually, they were
[47:29.120 --> 47:36.120]  successful. So that's why he's there. Other takes on this, I mean, the media response
[47:36.120 --> 47:42.240]  has been generally much improved this year. I remember back in 2013 in Watford, the BBC
[47:42.240 --> 47:47.720]  reported the blonde woman who interviewed you was standing literally 500 yards from
[47:47.720 --> 47:52.360]  where they were meeting, and she said it was, quote, a conspiracy theory. She said, isn't
[47:52.360 --> 47:58.200]  this just a big conspiracy theory? Today, the BBC released a very fair article basically
[47:58.200 --> 48:03.600]  admitting that this group does have power, a raft of different influential people there.
[48:03.600 --> 48:09.800]  And generally so far, the media coverage has given Bilderberg the credence and the importance
[48:09.800 --> 48:20.920]  it deserves in comparison to previous years. It's a real G7 meeting, not a public PR deception
[48:20.920 --> 48:26.480]  meeting where they hand out goodie bags, as you were saying. And once they admit that
[48:26.480 --> 48:32.240]  this stuff's going on, everyone's been told for 60 years there are no elites, ultra rich
[48:32.240 --> 48:39.000]  don't meet in secret. Once people start paying attention to this, instead of the Kardashian
[48:39.000 --> 48:47.600]  dad putting on a dress, it is game over. And I keep hammering that this is a secret, illegal,
[48:47.600 --> 48:54.680]  taxpayer funded lobbying meeting with all the key players of the Anglo-American establishment
[48:54.680 --> 49:01.240]  haggling over fine tuning their takeover. And how to sell fraudulent elections. Let's
[49:01.240 --> 49:09.240]  face it, that's what they do. They aren't going to meet on how to discredit the vote
[49:09.240 --> 49:16.480]  to get out of the EU for the UK. They're figuring out how to make it look like Scotland didn't
[49:16.480 --> 49:23.800]  really vote to stay, that the UK isn't going to vote to stay, or that it is going to. They're
[49:23.800 --> 49:29.360]  there basically figuring out how to bamboozle people, but it's not going to work forever,
[49:29.360 --> 49:36.760]  because a bigger and bigger spotlight is being shined on this conference. And again, that's
[49:36.760 --> 49:43.840]  testified to by the media coverage. The fact that Bilderberg is taking place after the G7
[49:43.840 --> 49:47.880]  is important, it normally takes place before, which suggests this year they're not only
[49:47.880 --> 49:53.520]  setting the consensus, which G7 then kind of rubber stamps, but they're actually making
[49:53.520 --> 49:59.520]  the final decisions on a lot of these issues. And a key one is related to ISIS, because
[49:59.520 --> 50:03.880]  from the information we've got, they're going to trump up this ISIS threat, which is a genuine
[50:03.880 --> 50:07.760]  threat because it was created by arming those who had it in the first place, but they're
[50:07.760 --> 50:13.440]  going to use it to target, quote, terror financing, which means economic totalitarianism.
[50:13.440 --> 50:17.760]  And that's their excuse to take over the internet, take over all transactions and kill cash,
[50:17.760 --> 50:21.200]  which they have all their CEOs publicly promoting right now.
[50:21.200 --> 50:28.120]  Yeah. And the very fact they would even end to banning cash. I mean, from my perspective,
[50:28.120 --> 50:32.000]  it's never going to happen. There would be a worldwide revolt against it. But the mere
[50:32.000 --> 50:36.120]  fact they're considering it and promoting it is testament to their extra...
[50:36.120 --> 50:39.920]  What they're going to do is it's going to be quasi illegal. It'll be legal, but they're
[50:39.920 --> 50:43.920]  going to act like it's illegal with asset forfeit or seizure and the rest of it. I mean, look
[50:43.920 --> 50:47.840]  at this headline, clearing your browser history can be deemed obstruction of justice in the
[50:47.840 --> 50:52.360]  US. Stay there, Paul. I want to talk more about what you predict is going to happen
[50:52.360 --> 50:56.880]  with the security forces and the rest of it, because this is all a microcosm of the larger
[50:56.880 --> 51:01.360]  global police state. Bilderberg is establishing. Stay with us.
[51:01.360 --> 51:05.760]  So the phone rings and I pick it up and it's Mark and Mark says to me, Hey, third Sunday,
[51:05.760 --> 51:10.960]  June, Father's Day, I ordered dad a gun. It's here. He's going to build it out and we're
[51:10.960 --> 51:14.440]  going to go out on Father's Day shooting. You want to come and I said, Yeah, what a great
[51:14.440 --> 51:19.320]  idea for Father's Day gift. An AR 15 rifle kit from guns, 80.com. I think I'll get my
[51:19.320 --> 51:22.480]  dad one. He says, go ahead, see you out on the range. So we're going to meet on the range
[51:22.480 --> 51:28.200]  on Father's Day. Get your dad an AR 15 rifle kit at guns, 80.com, guns, 80.com or call

[53:31.680 --> 53:35.800]  why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been
[53:35.800 --> 53:40.600]  available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your
[53:40.600 --> 53:45.240]  retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs. If you would like
[53:45.240 --> 53:51.560]  to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation
[53:51.560 --> 54:08.920]  and low returns. Call 800-686-2237. Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[54:08.920 --> 54:11.520]  We're going to go back to Paul Watson for the rest of this segment. Then I'll talk
[54:11.520 --> 54:15.120]  for one segment with Josh Ellings and of course Rob Duget, their take on what they've
[54:15.120 --> 54:23.440]  seen break down, but we know about LeBron James, may leave Cleveland to a new victory.
[54:23.440 --> 54:28.400]  What does it matter at the end of the day? Nothing. We know about Kim Kardashian's stepdad
[54:28.400 --> 54:33.400]  wearing a dress. Meanwhile, the global elite are putting fluoride in the water to brain
[54:33.400 --> 54:37.320]  damages and writing books, how they do it, laughing at us like eco science. The White
[54:37.320 --> 54:41.800]  House Science Art wrote a book admitting it, how they do it to brain damages and reduce
[54:41.800 --> 54:46.840]  their fertility. But see that's not as cool as LeBron James, because people have been
[54:46.840 --> 54:53.640]  drinking fluoride and it just comes down to we are identifying the real world. They put
[54:53.640 --> 54:58.400]  us in this media fantasy land and laugh at us. I'm coming out of the media fantasy land,
[54:58.400 --> 55:03.320]  go and look at this and you can see more and more we're able to really wake people up.
[55:03.320 --> 55:09.360]  Briefly, we've got specials that run every week, but we might go six months before we
[55:09.360 --> 55:16.040]  offer a special say on water filters. We're offering what I think is the best deal that
[55:16.040 --> 55:23.880]  we've ever offered on the Pro Pure Pitcher. Now, it is normally $69.95 with the super
[55:23.880 --> 55:27.680]  high quality, high powered filter that cuts out the glyphosates, the fluoride you name
[55:27.680 --> 55:33.640]  it. Comparable pitchers that you get at major stores just have charcoal and take out the
[55:33.640 --> 55:41.360]  bad taste and reduce stuff a little bit. This is the best system for the price out there.
[55:41.360 --> 55:48.400]  It's almost as good as their $200 systems. It's the Pro One G2.0 filter that just is
[55:48.400 --> 55:52.520]  just amazing, the all-in-one filter. It's what I use when I'm on the road. We use it
[55:52.520 --> 56:01.800]  also right here in the office. It's amazing. It's $55.95 right now. That's 20% off. We're
[56:01.800 --> 56:07.040]  running this special through next Wednesday, and then we will not offer this special for
[56:07.040 --> 56:12.640]  another year. We had to get special authorization to do this. We already have the lowest prices.
[56:12.640 --> 56:17.000]  We have a signed contract with the maker. We are the main level distributor because
[56:17.000 --> 56:22.840]  we offer such low prices. We had to really push to get this because, well, it's joke
[56:22.840 --> 56:26.440]  level. I mean, it basically cuts out almost all their profit in all of ours, but it's
[56:26.440 --> 56:35.400]  a loss leader. Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139. If you can't afford or you don't want the
[56:35.400 --> 56:39.200]  stainless steel model that's bigger and takes maybe a minute to put together, this takes
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.920]  no time to put together, it's just great to take to work, great to have in your truck,
[56:43.920 --> 56:49.360]  great to take camping. It also funds the operation and sending our reporters around the world.
[56:49.360 --> 56:54.120]  It's a win-win-win, 360 win. Anything I do, I look at it. Do I feel good about what I'm
[56:54.120 --> 57:01.560]  promoting? Does it make my conscience really feel ecstatic? Not just okay, but wow, I feel
[57:01.560 --> 57:07.480]  good doing this. I'm high on that, folks. I mean, that's my philosophy and I know a
[57:07.480 --> 57:10.720]  lot of people have that philosophy. Just the globalists have the opposite philosophy. That's
[57:10.720 --> 57:18.560]  important. We point that out. I like to give pleasure, not hurt, but I also want to smash
[57:18.560 --> 57:24.080]  the heads in of tyrants and I'll do it politically. We have to have that sheepdog instinct, though,
[57:24.080 --> 57:35.360]  to want to defend as well. Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139, simply the best water filtration
[57:35.360 --> 57:40.800]  system in the entire family, biggest discounts ever, Infowarstore.com. Now, we're going to
[57:40.800 --> 57:43.520]  go to break in about a minute and a half. I want to come back to Watson. What are you
[57:43.520 --> 57:47.360]  going to cover in the next segment? What else have you not gotten to and what are you expecting
[57:47.360 --> 57:51.440]  to happen this year and what do you think the flavor of this year is? I agree, they're
[57:51.440 --> 57:59.280]  rebranding tyranny, the next step of their takeover, but what else crystallizes 2015?
[57:59.280 --> 58:02.840]  As he said, Alex, it's all about rebranding authoritarianism. That's why they're coming
[58:02.840 --> 58:11.120]  in with these capital controls on cash. Again, while HSBC just got caught, $43 million fine
[58:11.120 --> 58:19.000]  laundering money, the drug lords. Again, 2012, $1.9 billion fine for the same thing.
[58:19.000 --> 58:25.120]  Yet, three of the top people from HSBC are now at Bilderberg or will be tomorrow, including
[58:25.120 --> 58:32.000]  the head of the BBC Trust, talking about how to restrict, squeeze the middle class. So,
[58:32.000 --> 58:36.000]  we need to be watched, we need to be surveilled in terms of finances because we might be cheating
[58:36.000 --> 58:41.560]  on ATACs, yet they're laundering money. And they're above the law and they run the narcotics
[58:41.560 --> 58:47.560]  aircraft that's come out. And of course, they fly drugs out, little kids out. They're some
[58:47.560 --> 58:51.000]  nasty people. We'll be back, stay with us.
[58:51.000 --> 58:54.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors
[58:54.840 --> 59:00.000]  on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website, infolwars.com, because
[59:00.000 --> 59:04.720]  the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as
[59:04.720 --> 59:10.000]  affordable as they should be. So, I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over
[59:10.000 --> 59:17.200]  the years will then, about six months ago, we get contacted by head down firearms, hdfirearms.com.
[59:17.200 --> 59:21.280]  Run and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people, their veterans, their
[59:21.280 --> 59:25.560]  patriots, their listeners of the radio show and they want to support the broadcast. It's
[59:25.560 --> 59:30.200]  always about security, whether it's for yourself, your wife, your loved ones. Go to their website
[59:30.200 --> 59:35.280]  hdfirearms.com, buy right off their website and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer
[59:35.280 --> 59:38.840]  of your choice. You can pick it up at the gun show, you can pick it up at the local sporting
[59:38.840 --> 59:46.760]  goods store, whatever you do, get your head down firearm today. The spirit of 1776 lives
[59:46.760 --> 59:49.840]  at head down firearms, hdfirearms.com.
[59:49.840 --> 01:00:11.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:20.400]  You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:27.880]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:33.160]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen, second hour. After our reporters leave us in about
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:38.120]  15 minutes, I'm going to go over the economic news, Dow Jones Industrial Average struggles
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:42.320]  to maintain gains. We're going to break down what I think is behind that. The latest out
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:47.600]  of control gains by ISIS in Syria and Iraq, just with our government financing the whole
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.480]  thing publicly. The Iraqis all know it. Their government has presented the evidence. Our
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:55.720]  military knows it and has tried to expose it.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:59.080]  The elite really are bold.
[01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:02.920]  Paul Watson finishing up. You've got the floor for the next four minutes on the Bilderberg
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:08.280]  agenda. Tell us what you're planning next. His Skype just dropped. We'll reconnect
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.600]  with them. Great technology. We've been using Skype since they came out with it. We were
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:21.160]  using it back in 2008 at the DNC. And it's gotten a lot clearer than it used to be. And
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.240]  the audio's gotten better on average, but it drops as much as it ever did.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:28.040]  Alex, I'm just going to mention one thing. We were watching them shooting a helicopter
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:36.720]  flying right over right before it dropped. You think they may have jamming? Not saying
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:43.760]  it's absolute, but it would surprise me. Were we capturing that, the helicopter flying
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:50.200]  over them? Could have been on Ustream. I'm not sure. I'm sure they caught it on HD though.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:57.720]  Paul, tell us about being buzzed by the helicopter. Yeah, I think we captured that. Yeah, I'm
[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:02.600]  not sure whether it's surveilling us or what, but we caught it. But one other thing is there
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:06.200]  are a lot of smaller countries represented here at Bilderberg who are not necessarily
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:12.700]  part of the globalist agenda. So you will get outliers from these smaller countries
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:18.800]  like Austria and Finland attending this conference, which is why Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:24.040]  General, is going to pressure the Austrian President Heinz Fischer to make Austria joy
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:28.760]  in NATO. That's been under discussion for many years now in order to further isolate
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.840]  Russia as part of this move to a potential confrontation between NATO and Russia that
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.440]  we talked about which could. And that's really the big news. They admit
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:42.480]  that they're moving armor and trainers in to fight the Russians right on their doorstep.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:48.240]  This is just madness. Yeah, and they want to arm the Ukrainian rebels. We had the bill
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:54.760]  in Congress. Again, McCain and Lindsey Graham introduced it to arm these Ukrainian jihadists
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.860]  who are now on a par with ISIS, you know, with their burning people alive on crosses
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.680]  and hanging people. Those are the new freedom fighters that they want to arm. So that's
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:10.360]  going to be under discussion too. What are you planning without giving
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:14.360]  way too much? And then give us your prediction for Bilderberg 2015.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:20.960]  Well, obviously, they're going to start arriving tomorrow. Normally, it's it's late morning,
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:26.200]  so we've just got to find a good spot to get some of the cars coming in. Also, we're talking
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.760]  about another location. Don't want to divulge too much information, but we're looking at
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:36.400]  several different locations to catch them coming in to get the best shots. As far as
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.440]  people here, I met somebody in the airport coming through who was attending. So we'll
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:45.320]  see how many people last year in Copenhagen. It wasn't so many. That was in a major city,
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.520]  obviously. Did you talk to him at the airport?
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:52.360]  Yeah, I met him in Copenhagen last year and he was from Poland. So he was flying from
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:56.760]  London to he says that, you know, other Polish people are going to be there. So there should
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:02.320]  be at least a smattering of, you know, independent media and hopefully a lot of protesters.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.320]  Okay. So you ran into somebody who's media or a demonstrator, not someone who's part
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.320]  of Bilderberg?
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:11.800]  Well, actually, I was on the plane with somebody who was speaking in a very Bilderberg-esque
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:17.320]  tone talking about how the UK serfs shouldn't even have the right to vote to get out of
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.320]  the EU. And, you know, he looked like he could be part of Bilderberg, maybe one of their
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.320]  aides.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.920]  Well, let's remember they have about 130, quote, members, usually about 10, 15 special
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:34.200]  guests, but hundreds of minions that kind of carry the brain bugs around. And so they're
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.760]  going to be crawling all over the place arrogantly as well.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:42.120]  And another thing is who is going to attend who is not on the list? Because of course
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:47.200]  in 2008, it was Obama and Hillary Clinton. Numerous other individuals have attended.
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.600]  They've been photographed, but not on the official list.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:53.120]  And that's why they don't want us to know when they're coming in. And then the best
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.000]  off thing will be obviously getting them when they get off the airplanes on their private
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.680]  jets. Paul, thank you so much. We'll talk to you more when I come back with other
[01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:05.680]  reporters.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:12.480]  This is not your granddaddy's smoke filled room. This is Bilderberg 2015. Every year,
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:18.400]  the Bilderberg confab tweaks its efforts to lock out the media, deny transparency and
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.960]  keep its agenda secret.
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:27.160]  Similar to the 6.2 mile exclusion zone around the radioactive chair noble plant, Austrian
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:32.440]  federal police have set up a similar sized zone to keep the public away from the hotel
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:39.280]  where over 150 world leaders will meet in secret in four wars reporters were stopped
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:44.680]  at a checkpoint, had their vehicles searched and even had police come to the front door
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:51.640]  of their hotel room, all in the name of keeping their cameras away from the 150 world leaders
[01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.840]  attempting to meet in secret.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:06:00.320]  You'll have continual coverage of Bilderberg on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.520]  on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website info wars dot com
[01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:13.880]  because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:19.320]  as affordable as they should be. So I refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over

[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:17.000]  Build a bird 2015. You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:36.760]  be cautious in Ontario. It was easier to control a million people literally. It was
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:46.120]  easier to control a million people than physically to kill a million people. Today it is infinitely
[01:08:46.120 --> 01:09:03.560]  easier to kill a million people than to control a million people. The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:31.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. This is an emergency transmission from female
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:39.360]  region 6 in occupied North America. That's not rhetoric. That's truth. We won't be able
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.720]  to defeat the globalist if we can't admit. They've taken over the infrastructure. They've
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:50.120]  taken over the mega banks. They control the currency. They're waging war on our families.
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:53.840]  And now they're getting ready to get rid of the free speech and the private property and
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:58.560]  all the rest of it. They could never do that before because they couldn't selectively enforce
[01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:04.360]  it all. Now through carbon taxes and the casual society, they openly say that they're going
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:12.120]  to be able to do this. It is going to be insane. And to stop us from getting together, they're
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:18.640]  engineering massive class warfare and are going to sick the giant mobs of welfare heads
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:26.000]  on the paramilitary police, the globalist set up to take the fall. I mean, you can see
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:34.200]  the problem reaction solution philosophy of the new world order in everything they do.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:40.080]  And we're here. We've reverse engineered the whole thing. I'm not bragging. We've reverse
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.520]  engineered the whole stinking mess with our field of experts. We can pretty much predict
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:50.000]  the next thing the globalists are going to do because we're inside their operation. We've
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.840]  infiltrated everything they run and control. But their entire attack operation is based
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:02.240]  on a dumb down public. So it's kind of like we got the glasses from they live. We can
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.800]  see the general public can't. We're here trying to get people to just put the glasses on and
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:13.520]  to use the rowdy Piper allegory from they live. You got to fight the public sometimes to get
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:19.920]  them to put the glasses on. But once you put the glasses on, or once you take the red pill,
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:23.960]  you can't be told about the new world order. You got to see it for yourself. And once you
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:29.440]  see it, you'll say, how did I not understand that before? Because the con game, there is
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:34.160]  no secret government. There is no shadow government. There are no death panels. It decreases your
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:41.680]  prices. We're not coming after your guns. We love you two plus two equals five. You didn't
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.920]  build your business. And when you're faced with a wall of lies, you either accept them
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:53.280]  or you admit you're in deep trouble. And people are fundamentally lazy. We've been kept comfortable
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:56.520]  while having our real freedoms taken. We've been given the baubles, the trinkets, the
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:02.520]  signants of success while we're being undermined. And people don't want to hear they're in
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:05.880]  deep trouble. They don't want to hear there's a shadowy evil group putting cancer viruses
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.280]  and vaccines and fluoride in the water and writing books about how they're doing it and
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.440]  laughing at us. I can play a PBS thing with one of the developers of the sock vaccine
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:18.440]  with sock top doctor going, yeah, we knew the cancer viruses and all in it. It was going
[01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:25.280]  to kill tens of millions. There's too many people. You know, I mean, I know why you're
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:32.080]  afraid. I've been afraid to. But I'm like a struggling person being held under water.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:36.520]  I'm not afraid at this point. I'm just struggling with everything I got to get to the surface.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:40.800]  But collectively, I got to get you to go to the surface with me. We're chained together.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.720]  We've got enough strength together to swim to the surface. We can't do it individually.
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:49.320]  We're down here with chains on us. We're only 10 feet under the water. And if we can just
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:56.080]  get the public to all jump towards the surface, move towards the edge to climb out, lift the
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:13:01.600]  chains up with our arms, kick with our feet. We can hit the top, get the air we need and
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:08.920]  get to the dry land. But I've likened it and I told Esquire where they did a profile on
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:21.800]  me last year that I liken this to claustrophobia. I've never been a claustrophobic person.
[01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:26.200]  But now I understand claustrophobia because when I read what the globalists are doing
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:29.800]  and I read books they've written and I watch clips of them on C-SPAN admitting all this
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:35.120]  horrible stuff, I feel claustrophobic because it's just, I want to warn people. It's out
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:42.880]  in the open. It's horrible. Why do we have to do this? They know their MMR shot gives
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:50.520]  you type 1 diabetes. Then they claim it's genetic. Well, of course it's genetic that
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:56.640]  if you get hit with an autoimmune response, your pancreas can fail. It's like if it's
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:00.520]  genetic if you smoke three packs of cigarettes and you're predisposed to get lung cancer,
[01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:11.640]  you're going to get it. Yes, genetically I can't take six or seven, three fifty-seven
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:20.920]  rounds into my heart. Probably couldn't take one. I guess you could breed some breed of
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:26.000]  human that had a heart that could take a couple gunshots. But it's not the genetics making
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.520]  it die when a bullet goes through your heart. It's the bullet. We're being murdered by a
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:37.000]  scientific elite slowly. They're laughing at us. They're criminals and they had such
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  control of the horror media for so long that they could have these secret confabs, not
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.200]  just this one but other events, trilateral commission meetings you name it and they would
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:51.520]  have people go on radio or friends and say, oh, it's crazy. There's no such thing as a
[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:59.360]  council on foreign relations. There's no such thing as the Bilderberg group. I don't know
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:07.000]  how you know these things and don't tell people. But it's the analogy I talked about or the
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.800]  example I talked about last week. I can go out to these firms and I can install software
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:19.280]  and systems that scan people's cookies and then I can change the algorithm to know what
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.960]  people will pay and what they won't pay off their past surfing history of other people's
[01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:28.720]  sites by subscribing to that database and then I can have the numbers change when they
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:35.480]  come in and gouge people. In fact, they have face scanning cameras that came out a decade
[01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:39.560]  ago and a lot of these big elite stores already have your face scan from the DMV database.
[01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:45.160]  They bought it from the feds and then it will see who you are and then jack up prices accordingly
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:51.280]  and you ask, well, how do they do that? They have price tax. Well, notice a lot of high
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:57.120]  end stores now don't have price tax and then they'll have a little handheld computer, a
[01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:00.320]  little iPhone when they walk over and they'll tell you what stuff costs while they're looking
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:06.240]  down at it. I mean, and I could do that and fix all of our funding problems and have plenty
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:10.400]  of money to do everything I want, but I won't do that because that's a screw job. We'll
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:14.920]  see the elite would say, well, you're not Machiavelli because they say the end justifies
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:20.200]  the means, but your end is evil as well. We know the end doesn't justify the means because
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:26.880]  that always leads to corruption and collapse. Evil sells good men and women on doing corrupt
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:33.280]  things for the greater good and we know where that gets us. But who's the chief pusher of
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:40.520]  this idea of real politic, Henry Kissinger? Let's go to Josh Owens reporting from right
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:45.680]  outside the security perimeter in Austria. They're promising two weeks in jail and a
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:50.960]  500 euro fine. If you step foot inside the giant exclusion zone, we'll put that article
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:57.120]  up on air for TV viewers. The articles on info wars.com and it is a massive perimeter.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.600]  There's no way people won't even know that they're getting into this when they go into
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.840]  this perimeter, but they stop you miles out. Josh, thank you for joining us.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:11.600]  Hey, Alex, this is actually Rob do. Okay. It takes a little bit of time to switch that
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.920]  stuff out and we didn't have time. Okay. Well, I'd said, I'm not mad. Just be clear. I'd
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:20.480]  said Josh and then you, but that's fine. Go ahead. Okay. Actually, where the perimeter
[01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:26.400]  is runs into the backyard area of where our location is. So it is really far, at least
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:31.840]  a mile in diameter going around the Interalpen hotel. This is Rob do reporting live from
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:39.360]  Mohsern, Austria, about halfway up the mountain between the village of Telfz and Buchan, Austria,
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:45.080]  up top of the mountain where the Interalpen hotel is. And so today we, we pretty much,
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:49.360]  I think called a truce with the cops. They are not badgering us as much. They're letting
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:53.680]  us go through the checkpoints quicker. And I've agreed not to film them essentially.
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.680]  You know, one of them came up to us at one point and said, are you the guys making the
[01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.320]  YouTube videos? I said, yeah, yeah, we are. He said, are you filming now? I said, yeah,
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.240]  I am for my protection, but I won't put it in your face as long as you leave us alone.
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:11.680]  And so he, they looked at our passports and let us go through the checkpoint. So I think
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:17.880]  that era of the story here at Bilderberg 2015 is ended. And now we can concentrate more
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.320]  on what these globalists are doing. Dealing with this stuff so much, I didn't have time
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:27.400]  to make my full photo dossier. And yesterday we were having lunch. And later on, I'm working
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.760]  on a report. And the next thing I know, I'm looking at a guy that we had lunch next to.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:36.880]  It was Alexander Stubb, who is listed on the Bilderberg site as the prime minister of Finland.
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:42.360]  But on Wikipedia, he's listed as the finance minister. So regardless though, he was there.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:47.200]  I noticed him as we were sitting. He didn't look like a big politician or anything. He
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:51.720]  was there with three other people in this small little restaurant. But he reminded me
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:55.360]  of my brother-in-law. And I pointed him out to Josh. I said, look, that kind of looks
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:19:00.680]  like my brother-in-law. And lo and behold, as I'm putting this report together today,
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.080]  this morning, I realized that that's the guy we're sitting next to during lunch. And I
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:11.080]  could kick myself for not knowing that earlier and then going to confront him about why he's
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:16.920]  converting with people like Henry Kissinger, the heads of HSBC and Queen Beatrix, all these
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.120]  eugenicists. I mean, I don't know how these people can do this in good conscience. So I
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:26.920]  wanted to ask him that if I do see him again down in Telfs. I tell you Rob, I can tell
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:31.960]  why Hitler and the globalists liked that area. It is absolutely gorgeous. I mean, it is
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:36.200]  a legendary looking with those Alps in the background. I'm sure you're just hating this
[01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.200]  assignment.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:42.520]  No, I actually do love the people here are very nice. Everybody here is very polite.
[01:19:42.520 --> 01:19:48.280]  It's very clean. Everybody here is very respectful except for the police. We had to deal with
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:51.080]  the police there in the beginning and then you saw what happened yesterday. We went to
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:56.600]  the police station, which I think was was by the way, we have the footage of them trying
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:00.760]  to snatch your camera coming up on the other side and your interview with locals.

[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:07.120]  need to burglarize a home is one simple household tool, a pair of scissors. If your home security

[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:22.280]  The phone line, you shell out 1500 bucks, get locked into a long-term contract and think
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:27.440]  you're safe. But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip. And when a
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:32.920]  burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless. Simply Safe Home Security is the smarter choice.

[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:29.560]  And this is a nightmare coming true for these guys and gals to have the public begin to
[01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.800]  be aware of them. I mean, they write books for each other to read about their horrible
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:39.120]  plans for humanity. But they know that only the quote, intellectual elite, read those
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:47.080]  and then grovel and try to join. See, so much of the intelligency of the planet just grovels
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:53.520]  and supplicates themselves before them so that a 92-year-old Henry Kissinger can toad-like
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:25:00.280]  wave his magic wand at them and enter them into the sanctums of the elite as they sit
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:06.840]  atop trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars of fiat money they
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:12.640]  just make up for themselves. While lecturing us all day, I want to talk to Josh Owens here
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:19.080]  in the next segment. I'll be talking to Rob do again. Rob, we now have the HD footage.
[01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:23.280]  Obviously, it caught out and we had to go to break whenever they were grabbing at your
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:27.720]  camera. But we do have a clip of that. We're going to play in a moment. I believe we have
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:34.000]  it queued up to that part. But it does show how exercising free speech, exercising right
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:42.680]  out of the press, has now forced the police to not act like, when the shoe fits, Nazis.
[01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:47.280]  Checkpoints, papers, all the rest is garbage. You cannot film. I'm bugging their eyes out.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:51.040]  I'm not calling them Nazis. I'm just saying it's Nazi-esque and you are in the home of
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:26:00.360]  Hitler there, and Svartzenegger there in Austria. And again, I'm not a germaphobe. I'm a pho-pho-germ.
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:04.200]  In bending words here, I'm not a germaphobe. I actually think the culture is neat and nice
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:11.760]  in many ways. But it really is a stark backdrop to all of this. And I want to thank all the
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:17.200]  listeners around the world from Sweden and Mexico and Russia and the United States and
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:22.480]  the U.K. I saw people commenting on Info Wars that did call the state and federal police
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:28.240]  and said the world is watching. For me, that's another exciting victory. It shows by going
[01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:33.520]  out, not being intimidated, it then invites more press to come and not be scared, and
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:39.000]  more demonstrators. And so I don't think we'll see 3,500 demonstrators as police estimated
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:44.360]  back in 2013 north of London. But I do think that we're going to see some demonstrators
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:49.080]  out there. I know you talked to locals too. They were unhappy with the checkpoints.
[01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:54.240]  Yeah, they definitely were. And just to go back to yesterday, what we did was, it was
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:57.840]  genius on your part to suggest that, but we really put them back on their heels.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:01.320]  Oh, come on. Don't say I'm a genius. You're smarter than I am.
[01:27:01.320 --> 01:27:05.480]  It really was. It was like a media genius going in there live and just putting it in
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:08.560]  their face and saying, look, we're going to film you, whether you like it or not. Now,
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:11.400]  are you going to keep acting like tyrants or are you going to leave us alone? Well, you
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:15.000]  know what? After people calling them and us putting up more videos, they're now leaving
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.160]  us alone. So it worked. It totally worked. And now we can concentrate on our real job,
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.440]  which is exposing the scum.
[01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:26.240]  But that's how it works. If you face down the red coats, they back off. If you let them
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:30.800]  go too far, they put you in a FEMA camp. I mean, historically, we got to back the police
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.080]  state off or it's game over.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.520]  And I tell you what, talking to the youth yesterday, a lot of the older people, they
[01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:40.840]  either didn't speak English or didn't really want to talk to us, but the youth were actually,
[01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:44.080]  even if they didn't speak really good English, they could engage us. And there were times
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:48.000]  where I had to really school some people, you know, the one kid I asked, I said, do
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.160]  you think elite's meeting in secret is good? He goes, secret, good. I'm like, no, it's
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.560]  not good. And I had to explain to him probably meant he thought you meant privacy.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:28:01.520]  No, I think, I think he understood. I think he, I think he understood because we talked
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:05.640]  a little bit before that. And it was just these, some of these people really had no
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:08.800]  idea what was going on, Bilderberg wise, but they gone through the checkpoints. They just
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.200]  didn't know what it was about.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.640]  But there were a few people that were awake. There was a guy wearing a Wu Tang clan t-shirt.
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:19.480]  It was very outspoken against them. And, you know, just his bravado, I just admired that
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:23.440]  it, you know, these people aren't going to just sit down and take it. And, you know,
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:27.240]  I said, I encourage them, go out, talk to your friends about this, get some people,
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:30.560]  we're going to, there's going to be a protest here this weekend. Be part of it.
[01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:35.520]  I wonder if what we saw the locals in Switzerland actually lit torches like something out of
[01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:40.760]  a Frankenstein novel and marched up to the castle. And then suddenly helicopters were
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:44.680]  taking off in the elite, a bunch of them left at half day early. And then we had a member
[01:28:44.680 --> 01:28:51.760]  of the EU parliament charge in and get beaten up. I mean, it's been a circus.
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:54.760]  That was in, that was in Switzerland. Yeah, it has been. And that's the kind of things
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:59.880]  that need to happen. This type of, that was in St. Moritz. Yeah. And actually we posted
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:05.200]  today an old interview from Jim Tucker. While we were out filming the locals, I saw this
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.920]  guy walking, I saw the back of him at first and I'm like, Josh, I think that's Jim Tucker
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:12.920]  just kind of making fun. But he had the hat on. He was kind of walking the same way. And
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:15.640]  then we see him sitting in a restaurant a little bit later. I'm like, just shoot some
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:20.640]  footage of this guy. It just, the spirit of Jim Tucker was alive here in Bilderberg 2015.
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:25.560]  I want to kind of put out a little memorials for him. So people know where we've come from.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.680]  You know, people like Jim Tucker, we're kind of trailblazing this, you know, decades ago.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:32.880]  Now we're following in their footsteps. And you know, just as you've been doing it for
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:36.760]  years as well, but just really taking that spirit of just standing up and saying, Hey,
[01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:40.520]  we're going to expose what you're doing and we're not going to back down. We're not afraidy.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:44.680]  That's it. You have done well, Rob. Dude, we're going to come back and we're going to play
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.880]  that clip with Josh of them going after your camera. We'll talk to Josh showing straight
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:56.880]  ahead. No one cover. We're on the March, the empire. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:07.560]  Former DARPA director and now Google executive Regina Dugan will be attending the secret of
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:14.280]  2015 Bilderberg conference this year in Austria. Dugan, who is helping to develop and promote
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:19.720]  the idea of implantable microchips will be there to head up the discussion on artificial
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:26.480]  intelligence. Regina Dugan is also an advocate for ingestible microchips. That's right. Tiny
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:33.200]  microchips inside little pills that users would swallow daily in order to obtain what
[01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:40.680]  Dugan describes as superpowers by having your entire body act as a biological authentication
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:46.920]  system for cell phones, cars, door locks, and other devices. And she is quick to point
[01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:52.840]  out that these microchip pills have already been approved by the FDA. For the complete

[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:04.360]  Hey, how you doing? Good, brother. Just recently started using your products. Everything you
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:08.480]  said about them is correct. Me and my wife both use a lot of them and it's made a lot
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:11.600]  of changes in our lives here. Well, thank you, brother. It's because it also funds our
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:15.880]  operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality. Supermail vitality
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:22.120]  was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic
[01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:27.720]  chemicals. We do the supermail and the super female vitality, big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:32.720]  We've gotten off to the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, a big ton of money there. Sourced
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:39.200]  from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet and then concentrated or maximum
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:43.720]  potency. They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff, just cover that
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:48.000]  up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:54.040]  naturally going goes right to the source. It's pretty exciting and I love it. Visit infowarslife.com
[01:32:54.040 --> 01:33:15.000]  today to secure your supermail vitality and other powerful products from infowarslife.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:21.840]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:48.320]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:33:48.320 --> 01:34:13.680]  I want to go back to our intrepid reporters. You know, I get irritating. I irritate the
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:21.400]  cruise sometimes and I can be irritable and sometimes I do little snappish things on air
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:30.560]  and that's because that's really how I am. I mean, when I blow up on air, that's real
[01:34:30.560 --> 01:34:39.640]  and I've been psychoanalyzing this week why I have been in a controlled rage and it makes
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:47.240]  me even sicker that the globalists are now out in the open. They're openly funding Al-Qaeda.
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:55.000]  It's come out, they're funding them to commit all these serious war crimes and then I see
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.800]  comments in the news like, well, we got to do what we got to do to take out a sod. Like
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:07.080]  being Machiavellian is cool and to see the weak public and the weak sellout prostitutes,
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:14.160]  old salantes terms coming up. Sit back in real politics with the general public and
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:18.600]  go, yeah, you got to work on the dark side sometimes. Yeah, you got to do really evil
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:26.560]  things for the greater good. It makes me want to slap them upside the head. They haven't
[01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:32.680]  studied history. They don't know how evil works. They are fools. They are destroying
[01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:42.000]  their prosperity and I'll tell you, it's all these soft novices, spoiled, entitled babies
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:51.200]  of every race, color, creed and religion who feel entitled to everything. They want to
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:57.360]  play with evil. They think it's fun new tricks they've just discovered. It's not new. It's
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:06.320]  as old as the hills and it leads to last century government killed 262 million people according
[01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:16.000]  to the University of Hawaii and Honolulu. Democide, non-military related deaths, wars
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:29.240]  killed probably 500 plus million soldiers. 262 million people and it was most of the
[01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:34.080]  time the same. Societies that were somewhat industrialized or agrarian, everything was
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:38.840]  happy. Everybody's doing good. They let corrupt people get in. They want to expand. They want
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:42.800]  to raise taxes. They want to take freedom. They want to invade a neighbor. Pretty soon
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:48.880]  folks are in forced labor camps. Black uniforms are everywhere. Spies are on the street corners
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:54.520]  and the criminals take over and then the prosperity goes down the drain. You've got to sit there
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:58.680]  scared while a guy in a black uniform is at your house taking your 18-year-old daughter
[01:36:58.680 --> 01:37:04.400]  out on a date, lecturing to the 50-year-old parents about how the cow ate the cabbage.
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:10.160]  I mean, this is what happens to the Talitarian places. All the nobodies, all the scum, all
[01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:17.360]  the filth, all the trash, just running everything, having their way with us, piling on greater
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:25.200]  men, piling on greater women, robbing art, directing the culture. Excellent movie based
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:35.000]  on a best-selling non-fiction book, The Lives of Others. But the true story of a Stozy
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:48.120]  urgent, basically, who's over teams spying on people and watching people commit suicide
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:56.400]  and stuff, the playwrights, the artists being dominated by these fascist so-called leftists
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:02.120]  and then demanding the starlets have sex with the Communist Bureau who's over the media
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:10.080]  and just seeing the dehumanization, the opposite of a free market, where just because you're
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:20.800]  Joe Stalin or Adolf Hitler or Mao Zedong, you get to play God. No, no, no! You will
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:27.240]  not take over! And they couldn't conquer this republic. They couldn't conquer America even
[01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:30.880]  though we had our problems. We were still hardcore freedom-based and that was spreading
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:38.680]  worldwide, so they jacked the water with superdoses of hardcore chemical warfare. And they put
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:50.480]  in the baking products, the powdered eggs on average have 300 parts per million. I remember
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:53.880]  I'd go to summer camp sometimes at a Christian camp that had powdered eggs and I never threw
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:39:01.880]  up. I had an iron stomach, I still do. And I remember they'd serve powdered eggs and
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:04.280]  we're telling my dad the next year I'd go, I've been there two years and I don't want
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:08.960]  to go back to that camp. I throw up my breakfast, the powdered eggs. My body was like what on
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:15.320]  earth? But a few times I held them down and I remember, as a kid, I remember drinking
[01:39:15.320 --> 01:39:23.000]  a big glass of tap water and getting a headache and feeling sick. Didn't even know to ask
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.920]  for bottled or filtered water. And there I was having my IQ reduced by at least 10 points.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:34.920]  Look at the Harvard study. I mean, my dad was top of his class. He was salutatorian
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:38.880]  because he played football too in sports at enough time to be valedictorian. And then
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:44.120]  they did testing in the state. 160 top smartest overall. They sent him to UT when he was a
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:50.040]  junior in high school. My dad, mathematically in other ways, was way smarter than me because
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:59.440]  he didn't grow up drinking fluoride, folks. I am a brain damaged person. Thanks a lot.
[01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:07.080]  My mom and her parents just as smart as my dad's family. I mean, I've already had so
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:13.040]  much stolen from me and so have you. By these people that poisoned our water, they're evil.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:21.480]  Stop them. Stop them now. What is people's problem? And I just use the water example
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:29.760]  because it's there. It's admitted. They know it's deadly. It's a sick joke. 1.3 parts per
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:35.920]  million will lower your IQ by 10 points in the Harvard study after six years of drinking.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:44.240]  How do you think 300 parts per million on average in a lot of products does? I'm surprised
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:49.600]  Americans can even wipe their butts. So we can't get mad at all these brain damaged
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.920]  zombies because we're all walking around under chemical attack. We'd all notice a big chemical
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:00.240]  attack that was, you know, they spray the town. Everybody dies, flops around like roaches
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:04.200]  dying. They've been sprayed with raid. No, they just hit us and we kind of wander off
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:12.040]  and stumble around and, you know, and yes, they found that the highest fluoride levels
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:19.160]  are seven. That's an EPA report. 754 parts per million in powdered eggs. On average is
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:25.520]  300. But yes, see, it's double plus what I said, double plus horrible. That's EPA records,
[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:30.520]  disposition schedule. This is why the EPA itself, its own scientists have had a huge rebellion
[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.360]  and said we want it out of the food. We want it out of the water. We want it out of the
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:38.720]  pesticides. My God. And you know why some of these EPA people have testified in closed
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:43.280]  session and it's come out. They got brain damaged kids, folks. People don't like having
[01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:49.040]  brain damaged kids. All right, I'm going to stop ranting. I'm going to go to Josh Owens.
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:55.040]  I got a bunch of other news I'm going to hit. But I mean, this is why I blow up, folks.
[01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:59.240]  It's why I feel sorry for anybody that ever punches me or something because I got a lot
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:05.760]  of rage pent up. I mean, it's claustrophobic level. I sit here every day. Most people want
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:10.280]  to just go play and party and I get it. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. I
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:15.520]  can't stop. All I think about is this because I just all I do is just watch them run around
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:23.360]  like a group of satanic monkeys sabotaging humanity. And they call themselves royalty.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:26.960]  Some woman who gets paid by the state and it's worth trillions of dollars and her money's
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:32.440]  a state secret. And they sued the Associated Press and won because the AP videoed them
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:38.720]  on a yacht in South America and on jet skis in public. There's not even a presumption
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:44.800]  of privacy for these people in public, but they don't care. They think they're God. Well,
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:54.000]  guess what? You're not God or. And by whore, I mean drunk on the blood of the innocence
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:43:00.280]  is what you are. All of you. Sick of you. All you could do to dominate us was dumb us
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:06.600]  down from birth, poison our food and water. Well, guess what? We know about it. Even in
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:12.000]  a stunned state, once you're conscious, we're going to defeat you. They want us to be like
[01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.320]  them to their kids are also inbred and so screwed up, committing suicide and on drugs.
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:20.800]  And I mean, these globalists will have like six, seven, eight kids trying to get one just
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:24.960]  to replace them. They can't even get a good kid out of five or six kids. You people are
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:29.000]  cursed and you think your curse is on us. It's going to have any effect with your chemicals
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:33.320]  and biologicals. God's going to curse you with stuff that no bunker is going to allow
[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:39.920]  you escape. Excuse me. Let's go to Josh. Oh, it's covering Bilderberg 2015 in Austria.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:45.240]  Josh. Oh, let's go ahead. Hey, Alex. Josh owns it for us. Com what you're talking about
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:50.440]  earlier with a cop trying to take my camera. It's it's on the video on the Alex Jones channel
[01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:56.160]  called the police trying to confiscate a reporter's camera. And when I was there, it was almost
[01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:00.080]  a little blip in what happened. But when I went back and rewatched the video, I realized
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:04.680]  he actually lunge for my camera. And I know he hit my hand, but I was in the in the moment
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:07.720]  of everything that was going to look at the arrogance in his in his eyes and in the still
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:14.560]  image. What a joke. Well, in that moment, he was just trying to intimidate us because
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:18.520]  as soon as I pulled the camera away, he walked off. He walked off in the back and hid behind
[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:22.480]  this little corner wall and kept saying, we did not call you. We did not call you. He
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:27.440]  was very upset that you. Exactly. We talked to you. You don't talk to Hillary. You don't
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:30.440]  talk to her. You don't look her in the eye. That's Bilderberg meaning rules. You don't
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:36.800]  look at any of their godly faces. Sorry. Go ahead. Oh, exactly. And I think just speaking
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:41.400]  from being in Copenhagen last year, I think that might be one of the reasons that they've
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.240]  mackened the hiding in such a secluded areas because last year we were right beside the
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:48.520]  hotel and we could smell the food they were eating. We're watching them eat. We're watching
[01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:53.480]  them smoke cigars and now they've set up a perimeter to where I, you know, we might
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:57.840]  see them. I'm not sure, but I think they're going to have world leaders there at a secret
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:04.040]  summit or something. Something big is going on. Yeah. Well, I mean, I think the point,
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:07.600]  well, last night I was talking to a friend and he said, you know, the reason that the
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:11.320]  cops freak out on you guys is because you're filming them. Most reporters don't go through
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:16.440]  there and film the checkpoints. They just go through them, get through it and everything's
[01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:19.800]  fine. And I was like, yeah, but don't you realize that's the point? That's the whole
[01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:27.540]  reason that we're here is to keep these big monolithic creatures from growing and spreading.
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:32.760]  If someone's not covering it, it just gets worse. It festers like a sore and then it's
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:37.560]  out of control. So obviously they don't freak out on other reporters because they're not
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:41.720]  filming them. The ones that do film them, they feel threatened. Yeah, well, that shows
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:46.880]  the mindset. Who are you talking to? Charlie Skelton? No, no, this was just one of my friends
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:51.680]  back back in. Okay, well, I want you to interview Charlie, what he went through. You know, he's
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:55.840]  a really nice friendly guy and he gets harassed everywhere he goes and he stands up to it.
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:46:00.040]  But then you run into other reporters who say, Oh, you just thought of, you know, not, you
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:04.920]  know, not getting Bilderberg's way as if we're the ones imposing trying to cover this criminal
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:10.200]  organization as if we're troublemakers. But, but exactly people who are selfish minded
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:14.360]  always think, Well, why do you go to Bilderberg if you don't want to have this happen? It's
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:22.960]  this idea of just submit. No, we know, or people say, ha, ha, the cops rousted you, your idiots.
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:28.960]  No, we know they're going to do that. We're there to show it's happening. I'm going to
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:32.640]  be like in World War Two, flying a bomber over Germany. And then people write letters
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:36.360]  back going, aha, I saw newsreels. If you're getting shot at, you're an idiot. As if you
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:40.760]  didn't know you were going to get shot at, you're there to draw fire to show what's going
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:48.440]  on. Everything is military on the planet, business, life, everything. And this all that's
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:53.320]  what info war is about is that is that we've got to show people what they've got growing
[01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:57.040]  under the surface. You walk in somebody's house, they go, I don't have roaches. You
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:01.160]  might have a pull this plank off the wall by your stove, pull it off. It's like 5000 roaches.
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:05.320]  It got roaches. We're there showing the roaches. Go ahead.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:11.320]  Absolutely. And people act like it's outrageous or absurd what we do when we cover the police,
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:17.680]  being authoritarian. But you know, the big secret is, is that everyone right now listening
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:21.400]  to this, you can pull your phone out and hold it like this. And that's about the extent
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:26.840]  of it. It's not hard to do. It's not difficult. People either say that it's so heroic to do
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:31.240]  it or that it's idiotic to do it and it and it's absurd. And the fact of the matter is
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:37.560]  is that we've been harassed from the second we got here when we started ascending the
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:41.920]  mountain to yesterday. And then we went to the police station yesterday, we went back
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:47.640]  to the checkpoint, filled them for the third time. And today we breeze through no problem.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.760]  So the proof is in the pudding. It's right there. People can see it for themselves. If
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:55.560]  you sit back and you allow this to grow, then it's going to grow. And then it's going to
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:58.480]  get to the point where it's going to affect you. And you're going to wish you had done
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:03.880]  something before it got to the nation of sheep will be ruled by wolves. Thomas Jefferson,
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:09.040]  what doesn't the public get? Don't act like prisoners. Don't act like perps. The public
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:13.120]  in general acts like criminals in front of the police and all scared and the cops act
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:16.320]  accordingly. I've noticed if you just smile at the cops, wave at them, come over and talk
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.600]  to them. Most of the time they'll be eating out of your hand. They're so used to the public
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:25.240]  hating them. They now hate the public. That's what George Soros and the globalists have set
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:29.920]  up. They brag about it. They're setting up where we're all fighting with each other locally
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:34.240]  instead of taking our counties and cities back, putting police forces in like we want
[01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:38.160]  and taking our world back. That's how we're going to do it. We're the winners. We're the
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:44.120]  good guys. We're out promoting freedom. And we're not ashamed of it. That's the key. Stop
[01:48:44.120 --> 01:48:49.560]  acting like you're ashamed of this. Be bold, folks. Be bold in the face of this scum. The
[01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:54.480]  only hope we've got is going in hard against these people. 110%. And let me tell you, every
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:58.920]  time we take action, we have victory. That's what's so frustrating is people don't know
[01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:03.480]  how powerful good men are and how powerful good women are.
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:08.440]  Absolutely. And the fact of the matter is, is that at the end of the day, you're going
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:11.800]  to wish you had done it. You're going to wish that you had stood up before it got to the
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:15.480]  point where you couldn't because history proves that when it gets to that point, you're going
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:18.840]  to be begging that you could get that time back. And I just don't think people realize
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:20.280]  it because people aren't paying attention.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:23.360]  Anything else you want to add if we're going to go to break them and come back and hit economic
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.520]  news and shift gears and drill Selente joining us. Anything else that needs to be added?
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:29.520]  What are you planning next?
[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:33.640]  Tomorrow we have a lot of stuff planned. The meeting hasn't started yet. So tomorrow the
[01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:39.880]  meeting starts and hopefully we'll get to see the face of evil up close.
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:45.480]  All right. Well, you guys are doing a fantastic job. God bless you. Folks are praying for you.
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:50.760]  Josh Owens, Paul Watson, and of course, Rob, the reporting from Austria. Thank you.
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:51.760]  Thank you.
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:56.640]  And we'll continue to watch and monitor their Twitter feeds at real Alex Jones. Continue
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:00.280]  to monitor everything that's happening. And if something big happens, we'll go live on
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:07.040]  the Ustream, post the video to infowars.com, prisonplanet.com. Sometimes during Bilderberg,
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:10.600]  infowars gets attacked and taken down even though that's very sophisticated to do. They
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:14.600]  have to actually get into the control servers to do it. And we've got some of the best companies
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:17.960]  and individuals and hackers out there keeping the sites up. The attacks are pretty much
[01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:22.560]  continual, but if infowars goes down, then there's things like prisonplanet. That's why
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:27.880]  we have other websites as backups, because really all infowars and prisonplanet are
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:33.320]  as launch points. So third party groups like Facebook, Twitter, and others can't censor
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:38.040]  us when we launch. That's something everybody else should do is spread the word about this
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:42.920]  broadcast, but also shoot your own videos or take other videos, edit them together with
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:47.880]  info you think is important and post it. We need more people firing, firing, firing,
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:52.280]  firing on the globalist in the info war and just never stop. And we're going to go up
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:55.160]  over the top on these people and we're going to look down. They're going to be defeated.
[01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:59.400]  They're going to be Nuremberg trials and they're going to get taken up at the gallows. We're
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:25.400]  going to hang them hot.
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:32.400]  We're going to go up over the top on these people and we're going to look down on these
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:52:02.400]  people and we're going to look down on these people and we're going to look down on these
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:32.400]  people and we're going to look down on these people.
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:53:02.400]  We're going to go up over the top on these people and we're going to look down on these
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:32.400]  people.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:54:02.400]  We're going to go up over the top on these people and we're going to look down on these
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:32.400]  people.
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:55:07.400]  And we're going to jump over these people and we're going to look down on these people.
[01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:16.000]  When the song goes on I'll be out there untangling my mind and you know the allegory is the Bilderberg group this this this evil
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:20.160]  Succubus
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:26.320]  Attached to humanity that is just involved in so much horrible stuff. I mean just just Henry Kissinger
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:32.240]  The big new presents he wrote in one of his books I forget which one I read like five books. He wrote
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:36.040]  You can pull the quotes up online where he said yeah
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:42.440]  I'm very proud of the fact that of what the Khmer Rouge did and you know the best part was is I manipulated them into killing everybody
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:44.440]  I didn't kill him myself. So I'm innocent
[01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:48.480]  It's like this weird sick course. He's saying he's behind it
[01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:54.920]  But then bragging to the elite how he did it and protected himself. They're all about not getting the blame not
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:56:02.080]  That's what they have boards and globalist groups and international laws and no one knows exactly who did it or who how it
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:04.080]  Happened so no one gets the blame
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.560]  We're not fighting Napoleon or Hitler
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:10.800]  Or we can see them
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:18.440]  We're just fighting big swarms of corporate con artists who are run by you Genesis at the top
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:24.100]  I'm just gonna go over this with the Gerald Salente the Dow Jones industrial average the
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:29.680]  West Coast of North America to be slammed by 2016 with 80% as much Fukushima radiation in Japan
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:35.960]  Clearing your browser history can be deemed destruction of justice in the US. I
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:39.480]  It's just I
[01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:42.840]  Think what's really getting to me is like I said earlier. It's out in the open now
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:45.000]  I mean, I knew this stuff before you knew this stuff, but
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:52.640]  Now they're titrating the dose there. Yes, we gives my poison at small amounts and build it up till they develop an
[01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:56.560]  immunity or resistance to it become tolerant and
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:02.640]  They've just built the poison level up so high. We're now I mean they could start
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:09.080]  Barbecuing children on the White House lawn. I mean, maybe that would wake people up. It's like the New York Times few years ago
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:13.120]  Paul was like look at this
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:18.080]  They admit the New York Times the UN rounds up the African villagers and kills them to create a carbon sinks
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:20.080]  They can build a factory nearby
[01:57:20.080 --> 01:57:27.040]  This is good news is coming out and I said and Paul's as smart as I am smarter, but I said Paul
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:33.320]  They're putting it in the paper to condition you to accept it. That. Oh, yeah, the UN just lines up people and murders them
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:35.320]  But they're liberal so it's okay
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:46.840]  Briefly I mentioned last hour we're funded by the high quality products at m4 store.com and m4slife.com and we have the
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:49.680]  Pro pure g2 filter
[01:57:50.800 --> 01:57:59.320]  Pitcher system the entire system for 20% off. It's normally like $69. It's $55 and 95 cents right now. That is the biggest
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:02.880]  True percentage off anything we've ever offered
[01:58:03.720 --> 01:58:07.080]  We just keep lowering prices trailblazing
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:11.400]  We had to go to the manufacturer and get signed off because I have a contract
[01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:14.400]  I can't go below a certain amount. We have the lowest prices already
[01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:19.360]  So when you tell like we're Walmart and we raise it 30% one week and then lower it 20 the next week and tell you
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:23.160]  It's a sale when we got a sale. It's a sale and you're purchased
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:25.960]  This is a great way to get a high quality filter to cut off fluoride glyphosates
[01:58:27.160 --> 01:58:32.320]  Reduces or removes thousands of different chemicals that are in different water supplies. You're insane if you're not filtering
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:39.440]  This is the time to get the picture. It's portable. I think it's the best bang for your buck out there info or store.com or 888

[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:12.440]  Government cover-ups you want answers?
[02:00:12.960 --> 02:00:19.320]  Well, so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now
[02:00:19.320 --> 02:00:21.320]  live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  Alex Jones
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:28.720]  The alleged Peter bear
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:39.000]  Then his astronauts out of the headlines now, but you notice they got him for withdrawing his own after-tax money
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:43.840]  To pay off one of his alleged
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:45.840]  molestation victims
[02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:52.240]  Now
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:55.160]  You look at those laws they can be applied towards comebacks
[02:00:56.680 --> 02:01:00.040]  But they're generally applied against innocent people and that's come out in the news
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:05.960]  They just had hearings three months ago in Congress about the IRS targeting hundreds of thousands of innocent people a year
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:10.040]  Just grabbing their bank accounts you name it if they made small withdrawals or
[02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.440]  Lots of small deposits even though they could say each deposit was from the cash of the day
[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:22.520]  From the restaurant now, there's no law there. There's just a regulation they can interpret
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:25.600]  and
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:27.640]  We know the Boston bombing is
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:34.280]  as phony as a leprechaun from Pluto riding a rainbow pony unicorn
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:38.480]  Drawn by 14 Santa Claus's on
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:45.560]  A sleigh of unattain him with a beautiful Hillary Clinton jumping over the moon
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:52.360]  Playing tiddlywanks, it's just as nonsensical. It's pure bull
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:56.440]  Well, look at the story out of CBS news that I've been mentioning
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:02.840]  Clearing your browser history can be deemed obstruction of justice in the US
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:07.520]  next week a 24 year old man who knew Boston bombing a
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.440]  marathon bombers is
[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:17.160]  Scheduled to appear in US federal court for sentencing on obstruction of justice charges related to 2013 attacks and
[02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:21.360]  They're arguing it's because he
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:24.960]  Erased his browser history. I mean I erased my browser history
[02:02:25.840 --> 02:02:27.840]  Every time I go buy something
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:34.000]  Which I order groceries online sometimes clothes. I don't like shopping. Obviously. I take my daughter shopping sometimes
[02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:39.280]  Go get my son a new tennis record or whatever, but fishing poles or shotgun shells
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:43.600]  But I tend to buy stuff online now as most people do
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:49.760]  And are they gonna come bust me and argue I you know erase my browser. I'm covering something up
[02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.760]  And I can't pronounce this guy's name
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:55.320]  car rules a horn
[02:02:55.320 --> 02:02:59.960]  Matt todova a former taxi driver did not participate in any
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:02.960]  Of or have any knowledge of the bombings according to US authorities
[02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:09.840]  What could land him in 20 years in prison was he has since been his arrest are the charges that he deleted video files from his computer
[02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:12.440]  And clear his browser history in the days following the attacks
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:18.560]  A grand jury indictment issued May 29th
[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:24.960]  2014 states that he deleted a large amount of information from his Google Chrome internet cash
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:30.480]  Following the bombing including references to the video of the suspect bombers which they went got from Google anyways
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:37.720]  Two of the photographs of the bombers released approximately the same time and the photograph of officer Sean Collier who had been allegedly killed I
[02:03:39.040 --> 02:03:42.280]  Mean this is just sick how they're going after all these innocent people
[02:03:43.120 --> 02:03:46.520]  To shut them up because they all know it's phony. I
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:54.640]  Mean guys, let me tell you the older brother was in the CIA. He was at Georgetown in CIA funded projects openly
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.120]  Connected to radicalizing the jihad
[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:06.960]  In the Caucasus and the Russians blew his cover two years before the FBI got caught caught lying about that
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:14.280]  They've killed his friends executed them shot them in public bus stations in their houses
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:19.080]  They put handcuffs on you shoot you in the back of the head and then nobody gets in trouble. I mean, that's dangerous folks
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:22.160]  They could do that to anybody
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:28.920]  Now either he went over there as a double agent to create al-qaeda groups or to spy on him
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:34.720]  And then he came back and attacked and was a triple agent or what's more likely is he thought it was part of a drill
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:36.000]  They set him up
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:41.360]  It's just it's just wrong. He was a playboy. He was into boxing MMA into girls
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:49.400]  He wasn't good about Muslim. They set him up and the media says I'm this evil demon for saying it the government runs al-qaeda and Isis
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:53.200]  Fox news when you attack me. I mean, I'm telling the truth here
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:59.600]  And I don't know what happened at the Boston bombing, but what we're told ain't it. Okay ain't it
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:08.720]  It's that time again a private party with some of the most powerful people on earth privacy guaranteed by thousands of police
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:11.720]  Paid for by the public
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:19.080]  Besides Kissinger regular attendee David Petraeus will be there with his get-out-of-jail card
[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:26.880]  courtesy of pals like Tony Blair who put in a good word for him when he leaked reams of classified documents as long as he doesn't
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:33.520]  Reveal any Bilderberg secrets and of course, there's the heads of banks who've recently been caught rigging interest rates with live war
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:40.040]  Ringing currency exchanges commodity rates pretty much rigging every market and getting caught money laundering
[02:05:40.040 --> 02:05:43.440]  But just getting off with a slap on the wrist. Where are the police?

[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.360]  Next line I think goes for any nuclear war between the US Russia or China
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:02.800]  As we rush into certain death
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:10.400]  Well Gerald Solente three four years ago said World War three could be coming nobody else is really saying that at the time I
[02:09:11.040 --> 02:09:15.840]  Remember his trends journal. He's so good at it. He'll probably without me even giving him time to do it
[02:09:16.760 --> 02:09:22.080]  Pull up the quotes, but I remember in his trends journals three four years ago. He kept
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:28.160]  Harping that when the economy starts to go down they take us to war and this time China maybe even
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:30.760]  Russia or vice versa and
[02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:35.000]  I'm not saying China and Russia don't have their own corrupt problems
[02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:37.560]  It's the exact same type of oligarchies
[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:44.480]  But the West is pushing it all and the very same West is screwing us over at least a long time ago
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:51.040]  corrupt empires took care of their own people generally and the spoils came back to Rome the spoils came back to
[02:09:51.480 --> 02:09:53.480]  London the spoils came back
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:56.120]  to
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:09:58.120]  Oosterbeck
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:01.080]  But they don't even come back now
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:04.840]  The globalists sell us out to other dictators
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:08.880]  But then also try to keep them in check with military forces
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:13.600]  So we got Bilderberg 2015 with the TPP in the background
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:19.160]  We've got global government being exposed these corporate combines these illegal lobbying groups coming out
[02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:24.160]  We've got the stock markets in trouble the bond markets teetering
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:26.160]  But they just keep pumping up the bubble bigger
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:32.200]  There is so much to get into today with Gerald Salente of trends research comm
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:39.760]  Gerald Salente is an American trends forecaster publisher of the trends journal business consultant author and makes predictions about the
[02:10:39.880 --> 02:10:46.480]  Global financial markets and other events of historical importance Salente has described himself as a political atheist and a citizen the world
[02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:51.440]  He's appeared on everything from the today showed a good morning America to Oprah Winfrey CBS
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:57.760]  NBC nightly news Russia today Alex Jones show you name it trends research calm and boy you read his
[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:04.480]  Spring issue has been on a while and it's it's just spot-on summer one coming up soon
[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:09.440]  Gerald Salente again joins us. We have defense intelligence documents coming out
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:15.360]  And there's all this new news here, but it's just such a big deal that our government admits in Pentagon reports that
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:24.160]  Our government set up Al Qaeda and ISIS in Egypt and in Syria and now they want to quote open bases back up to fight them
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:29.780]  But you watch it'll be to just keep them in this new enclave. They're they're splitting Iraq up right now
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:36.840]  They don't run ISIS or Al Qaeda. They funded them. They turned them loose now. They're going to keep them in that area
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:44.640]  Keep them in that zone that Saudi Arabia's reward for being behind 9-11 with the criminals in our government
[02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:53.280]  Now the media frames that as I'm not saying there's not radical Islamists. They're absolutely are and whereas Al Qaeda the old Al Qaeda was mainly synthetic
[02:11:54.720 --> 02:12:00.480]  This new ISIS they allowed him to recruit for years worldwide is a bunch of idiot bots
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:08.880]  recruited by globalist intelligence agencies to be run by their psych warfare controllers who poses imams and
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:11.240]  They have Saudi Arabian
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:13.240]  Turkish and NATO money
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:19.400]  And it just came out two weeks ago that the jihadis are putting out videos threatening in full wars official Al Qaeda ISIS
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:23.320]  I'm proud of that. I'm very proud of that Joe Biggs is very proud of that
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:29.400]  And they admit we're hurting their recruiting and they're telling their people do not listen to the American pig
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:33.000]  We are not to run by them and jihad for us. Yes
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:37.400]  Because you see the truth is hitting them hard. So these teenagers and others
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:40.880]  Understand that they're setting up the Middle East to be destroyed
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:46.240]  They're setting it up for a class of civilization. So I've kind of set the table for Gerald Solente
[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:49.600]  I'll be throwing a lot of wildcards at him today, but Gerald
[02:12:50.160 --> 02:12:55.640]  You're probably scrambling around with your stacks of articles and documents, but I remember you obsessively writing
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:03.680]  And actually five six years ago, but the last three intensifying about going to war with Russia mainly and the preparations for that
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:05.680]  And why they want war
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:11.520]  To basically be the smokescreen for an economic implosion so they don't get blamed now that it's all happening
[02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:13.360]  I don't hear you talk about it that much
[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:16.600]  So so so break down why you saw that coming and where we're going
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:20.440]  well talking about it, you know, we just sent out a
[02:13:20.440 --> 02:13:27.920]  Trends this week just today. It went out and it's about the Middle East. It's it's exploded
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:35.680]  The world the world the world is at war and you briefly mentioned it when you talked about Saudi Arabia
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:42.160]  You want to talk about some radicals? How about those Wahhabis? Huh? Alright, they wonderful
[02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:49.400]  Hey, how come you don't hear all these people like Samantha Powers and Hillary Clinton and Susan Rice and
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:52.320]  Condoleezza Rice and all of these women that
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:57.880]  Claim that we should be in Afghanistan because of the way they
[02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:03.160]  Treat women so terribly, but they have locked sure when it comes to Saudi Arabia
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:08.880]  I mean the women aren't even allowed to drive a car can't leave the country without permission
[02:14:09.080 --> 02:14:12.800]  From their husband and on and on and on they have no rights at all
[02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:20.000]  But they're quite about that because it goes back to what you're saying about supporting these radical
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:25.880]  Fundamentalists because among the most radical are the Saudis. Hey, Alex
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:31.480]  You know how they love to show those pictures of ISIS beheading a guy every now and then yes
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:33.760]  What Saudis up to now? We're ready
[02:14:33.760 --> 02:14:39.120]  It's only a half the year and they broke last year's record in beheadings
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:43.240]  They're up to about 88 now and it's what they're beheading people for
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:49.080]  Talking bad about the Prophet Muhammad or whatever and look if that's their country a hellhole they can do it
[02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:55.240]  I don't want it exported here and the left gets up there Gerald as you know and says we have to get rid of free speech
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:59.760]  Because it might offend somebody that's the whole point. I'm not out insulting Muhammad
[02:14:59.760 --> 02:15:01.760]  I'm not out trying to troll the Muslims
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:05.720]  But at the same time if somebody if some preacher wants to do it
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:09.800]  It's their right because the minute they take their right. They take Gerald Salante's right
[02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:16.680]  Yeah, again and going back to this though with these Saudis, you know, they're behind a lot of this
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:23.960]  Destabilization. Yes, they're the ones the Arab little league with the others that started the war in in
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:30.880]  Libya, they're the ones that are overthrowing Assad you mentioned mentioned Turkey and now Erdogan
[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:38.800]  Have faced a defeat in Sunday's election in Turkey because the people there are tired of getting
[02:15:39.080 --> 02:15:45.860]  Involved in these wars particularly with Syria and here's the big one and this is what today's
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:49.840]  Trends this week that just went out is about
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:55.320]  It's not making the news and it's going to spread throughout the Middle East
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:16:01.720]  The Saudis are slaughtering Yemenis on a daily basis
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:11.560]  Bombing the place. It's the poorest country in the Middle East being bombed by one of the richest countries and
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:17.240]  And one of the princes gave him a hundred and something bent lease to the pilots calling him brave heroes
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:22.440]  Bombing towns with no with no anti-aircraft guns from 30,000 feet
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:26.640]  I mean that'd be like me stepping on a frog and giving myself a medal and
[02:16:27.880 --> 02:16:30.440]  Me being the United States
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:35.080]  Feeding you with everything that you need to crush them
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:40.360]  So we have our assistant secretary of state over in Riyadh
[02:16:41.520 --> 02:16:48.040]  Bragging that we're said they're setting up coordination centers and cells to do
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:55.560]  reconnaissance to do intelligence to do refueling and to assist them with the military
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:03.880]  industrial complex to supply Saudi Arabia with everything it needs to slaughter these people now
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:05.880]  This is why it's so big
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:14.560]  When do you remember in our lifetime that the Saudis have launched a war against another country?
[02:17:15.200 --> 02:17:17.040]  Never never
[02:17:17.040 --> 02:17:24.960]  So what they're doing is they're one of the largest arms buyers in the world and now they're putting those arms to work
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:31.880]  That's right. Oh, I thought of that. They've been stockpiling and are estimated to be what fifth or six in the world for arm stockpiling
[02:17:31.880 --> 02:17:38.000]  I'd forgotten that and I guess now they're expending all those. I mean they have a hell horde of weapons, don't they?
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:41.440]  exactly so now if you're a
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:52.080]  Yemeni and your family's just been wiped out. Oh, and by the way, you have about four million of you guys working in the Saudi oil fields
[02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:54.960]  You think you're gonna seek revenge?
[02:17:55.760 --> 02:18:01.160]  So what we're saying is get ready for the counterattacks though the
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:03.560]  Prestitudes the media whores
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:05.880]  They'll call it terrorism
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:08.720]  It's getting even
[02:18:08.720 --> 02:18:13.960]  So they're gonna call the Shiites responding to be exterminated and I'm not trying to lionize the Shiites
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:19.920]  But compared to the Wahhabist they really are the underdog and they're always being attacked and now when they strike back
[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:21.920]  They're gonna be called terrorists is what you're saying
[02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:28.720]  Exactly because what they're gonna start doing is they're going to start launching attacks on Saudi oil fields
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:35.200]  Guaranteed it's already beginning to happen. It's not making the American news
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:41.880]  Number two or the Western news number two. They're going to attack the quote royal family
[02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:48.440]  I love how they give these names like what are we six years old a royal family? You know what happened? Don't you Alex a
[02:18:49.280 --> 02:18:56.160]  Princess kissed the frog and the frog became a king and their royal who's making this crap up
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:59.320]  It's a dictatorship that was put in place
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:01.920]  following the breakup of the
[02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:09.080]  Ottoman Empire after World War one as you well know and your listeners do with the Sykes Pico plan
[02:19:09.240 --> 02:19:12.720]  There was no Saudi Arabia. There was no Iraq
[02:19:12.800 --> 02:19:19.760]  They made these countries up and put dictators in to run the joints and now it's beginning to collapse
[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:26.960]  Why this is so important in Yemen when the retaliation happens against Saudi Arabia?
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:33.520]  It's going to start spreading. It's going to go into Bahrain. It's going to go into cutter
[02:19:33.520 --> 02:19:40.320]  It's going to go into the United Arab Emirates. It's got the the Middle East is already in flames
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.920]  Oh and our commander in chief
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:46.840]  Obama should be brought up on
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:49.320]  charges of treason
[02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:58.520]  He has lied about everything that he said when he was campaigning as the candidate Obama
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:05.540]  But you remember that you know, this was the guy that was gonna get rid of the Patriot Act
[02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.600]  close Guantanamo and most recently our liar in chief
[02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:13.680]  last September
[02:20:13.680 --> 02:20:21.680]  When we were going to save them your zitties on the mountain and I'm not going to put no boots back on the ground
[02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:25.280]  The boots are flying back into Iraq
[02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:30.960]  One lie after and you predicted that you said we put troops back in here's the headline today
[02:20:31.080 --> 02:20:36.960]  US prepares plans for more troops new bases in Iraq officials and watch they're going to split the country in three parts and
[02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:41.040]  Claim that they've made a peace deal with the new caliphate down the road
[02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:47.000]  Which is what the West planned all along and again, it's out of control
[02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:50.240]  It has been for centuries
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:57.000]  This whole Prophet Muhammad thing with the sheer and the Sunnis is going on since he died
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:02.320]  Yeah, for those that don't know the Shiites say that you've got to have a genetic line to Muhammad to be a
[02:21:02.320 --> 02:21:10.560]  Basically a priest and the others say no anybody can be and of course that groups the majority eighty percent
[02:21:11.520 --> 02:21:18.600]  About a nineteen percent or Shiite another one percent or kind of these subgroups alawites the Zohar astra Muslim subgroups
[02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:25.600]  But they hate each other just absolutely more than some of the radicals hate the West and and I see the West
[02:21:26.680 --> 02:21:28.680]  Trying to start a Shiite Sunni
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:35.120]  Civil war looks like they're doing a pretty good job. That's exactly it. They're creating
[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:42.960]  Destabilization in the entire area. They're pitting one against the other and the people are the losers
[02:21:42.960 --> 02:21:51.560]  You look what's going on in Syria Syria wasn't bothering anybody and you remember? Oh, this is what I love to with the cover of the trends journal
[02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:57.000]  We call it the presidential reality show liars crooks freaks and fools
[02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.400]  You look at Hillary Clinton now
[02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:07.640]  This is the woman responsible for the overthrow of Qaddafi and you remember that famous clip of her on
[02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:09.840]  CBS news
[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:14.400]  Asking how did she feel when they found out he was dead and here she is?
[02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:18.680]  We came we saw he died he
[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:26.120]  Anyway going back to the the fallacy of this whole campaign and what they're doing now
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:28.120]  She's playing an Obama
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.840]  She's playing
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:34.320]  Misprogressive she's playing peace and love
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:41.560]  She's playing we're gonna help the little people's on and on and on in the meantime
[02:22:41.840 --> 02:22:47.400]  And as Obama did as well they keep pushing for more
[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:54.440]  War and I'm sick of this term that they use. Oh, no, these are in combat troops on the ground
[02:22:54.440 --> 02:23:02.360]  These are advisers. What does everybody have attention deficit disorder? That's what they call them in Vietnam
[02:23:05.640 --> 02:23:09.320]  What are other big areas you're looking at right now other developments
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:16.160]  The big one is what's going on in China. You look at the oil imports that are going on there
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:18.160]  They're down over 15%
[02:23:18.160 --> 02:23:23.680]  You look at their export and import trade down both of them
[02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:26.320]  China is in a bubble
[02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:31.920]  But here's what's going on. You talked about the volatility in the bond markets
[02:23:31.920 --> 02:23:34.320]  There's volatility in the oil markets
[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:41.640]  You're seeing swings on the equity markets in the Shanghai index whether it's the Dax in in in Europe
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:44.640]  You're seeing three and five percent swings
[02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:47.960]  Daily there's total volatility
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:56.680]  The only way this market has been propped up is by this cheap money and they have no way out
[02:23:56.680 --> 02:23:59.120]  You know, we had a conference here last week
[02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:01.920]  One of the guest speakers was no me prince
[02:24:02.080 --> 02:24:08.680]  Well, as you well know was the author of all the president's bankers as it would have it
[02:24:08.680 --> 02:24:19.480]  Just two days before she came here to colonial Kingston. She was a keynote speaker at the Federal Reserve meeting with the World Bank and
[02:24:20.480 --> 02:24:22.480]  the IMF and
[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:30.080]  The Federal Reserve and here she is on a tapes and they'll be made available at the conference saying
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:32.640]  They don't know what they're talking about. Well, Gerald
[02:24:32.640 --> 02:24:36.400]  I'd love to air some of that and put a plug at the end to get the full interview
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:39.800]  But for folks that don't know no me prince was a managing director
[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:42.640]  at Goldman Sachs
[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:49.040]  She worked under the head of Goldman Sachs and back in you know, 2002 or whatever couldn't be part of it anymore
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:52.160]  Because of what she saw coming and that's huge
[02:24:53.080 --> 02:24:56.120]  But she was a keynote speaker at a Federal Reserve major event
[02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:03.400]  Because we even have major Federal Reserve a sub chairman in Dallas and Kansas City sounding like Gerald Salente
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:05.400]  sounding like
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:11.240]  Others so it really shows people in the system are worried that is huge that they had her
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:13.800]  address the Federal Reserve and
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:18.520]  She said what she wanted. She said, you know, I am and I'm gonna say what I feel like
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:27.040]  She said what happened was that the reason it went over so well was that the opening address just before her was from a cardinal and
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:34.200]  And the Cardinals said that the bank should be doing more to help the people and help the poor so he kind of set the
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:40.800]  Framework for her to come out blasting away and what a dynamo. She is and then we had a Q&A
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:44.800]  Afterwards and her and I both went on and talked about the set issues
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:51.480]  But the bottom line of all of this is is that at the top they don't know what they're doing
[02:25:52.080 --> 02:25:54.080]  They have no idea
[02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:59.480]  They're guessing at this. There's never been such a thing as quantitative. That's right
[02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:01.480]  We're in a total law-law land of
[02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:09.400]  Experimentation and how long can it keep going? I mean we know as you predicted the real collapse globally for real people started a few years ago
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:16.120]  We had you know, 0.2 growth and we know that's cook numbers Ron Paul agreed. There's probably 3% negative
[02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:17.200]  That's a depression
[02:26:17.200 --> 02:26:22.000]  But they paper over it with this fake service economy and all these baubles
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  But even that's starting to implode
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:27.280]  Well again, look at the numbers coming out now with the
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:32.920]  In the housing market if so all of this cheap money, it's still no great deal out there
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:40.880]  It's you know, they're building half of what they did during the boom. They talk about the rebirth and manufacturing again another Washington
[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:45.720]  White House line, you know, you have since 2007, you know
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:52.400]  Manufacturing is down over 3% and some 3 million jobs and manufacturing have been lost and where are they made up?
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:57.960]  Oh, they're made up in healthcare and ambulatory services jobs to pay nothing. Here's the facts
[02:26:58.200 --> 02:27:01.460]  You go from when the crash happened to now
[02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:08.840]  95% of all the wealth gained during that period in the United States went to 1%
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:11.200]  I'm not making that number up
[02:27:11.200 --> 02:27:18.600]  It's a fact while the income of the average person the the median household income is even now below
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:23.640]  1999 levels. There is no recovery. It's only enriching the rich
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:29.480]  So when is it going to explode or implode? I would have thought three years ago
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:35.560]  We had forecast that we're gonna raise interest rates in March of 2014
[02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:41.720]  Who in their right mind would have ever believed that they would keep these reg these interest rates?
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:46.880]  0% interest rates going on for 90 months
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:52.920]  And you saw what happened back in Switzerland and in Germany just a couple of months ago
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:57.760]  They're selling 10-year bonds that pay negative interest rates
[02:27:57.760 --> 02:28:03.960]  Which means you buy the bond and get less money back under the big lie of deflation
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:10.360]  Ten years later. So this is all a game that and here's what we're saying
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:17.400]  And that's what this week this week's trends is about that the Middle East could be the kind of
[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:23.600]  Catalyst that blows these markets to pieces and that's the outside
[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:26.080]  geopolitical event
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:28.080]  Everybody should be watching closely
[02:28:28.080 --> 02:28:37.080]  What's going on in Yemen because the prostitutes are reporting it and the United States is a part of it?
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:39.360]  Let me ask you this question
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:43.880]  And we've talked about this forever, but now it's in the Guardian the New York Times
[02:28:44.600 --> 02:28:49.040]  Everywhere the elites are buying underground bunkers safe houses. They're moving to New Zealand
[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:54.120]  I knew a lot of Hollywood folks six seven years ago. We're telling me no we think the US is gonna collapse
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:57.160]  That's the inside word big producers billionaires moving
[02:28:57.160 --> 02:29:00.800]  Israel all their billionaires have left and moved out
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:04.520]  What do the elite know the public doesn't know? Why are they so scared?
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:13.120]  No, there was a in Bloomberg yesterday. There was a fellow from South Africa. I believe he's the head of Cartier
[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:20.320]  Jason I think report came out and said he's worried about total social unrest because of inequality
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:23.080]  Yeah, yo, hand that was his first thing exactly
[02:29:23.080 --> 02:29:29.920]  And this is a guy saying and he's in South Africa, so he's really feeling and that's what's going to happen
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:33.920]  You know what I say when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose they lose
[02:29:33.920 --> 02:29:37.120]  Let's talk about that when we come back and ways to protect ourselves and other

[02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:12.440]  The only snag they say is working out how they're going to get welfare checks to Americans who are going to lose their jobs
[02:30:12.880 --> 02:30:15.440]  But it's not just jobs and wealth that we're losing
[02:30:15.440 --> 02:30:22.560]  Senator Jeff Sessions one of the few people in either House of Congress to actually bother to read the secret treaty is very
[02:30:22.560 --> 02:30:27.400]  Disturbed by what he's seen as he points out it is a treaty with fast-track
[02:30:28.040 --> 02:30:33.320]  Congress is giving up the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds vote to pass a treaty
[02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:39.040]  But the biggest secret of this secret agreement said it creates a commission with global governance powers
[02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:46.320]  This commission will be able to modify the treaty without any further input from any country as Senator Sessions says
[02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:49.480]  Congress would be pre-clearing a political and economic
[02:30:50.040 --> 02:30:55.260]  Union before a word of that arrangement has been made available to a single private citizen

[02:33:23.120 --> 02:33:30.160]  Imagine a house of cards, but unlike other house of cards you may have seen before a giant house of cards
[02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:33.320]  built on quicksand
[02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:35.960]  Towering thousands of feet in the air

[02:34:00.160 --> 02:34:04.640]  And nobody gets in trouble. They pay fines that are less than 1% of the profit
[02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:11.280]  They made off the fraud it comes out in the news that major banks own the aircraft shipping drugs in and flying
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:14.160]  torture people out and in little kids, I mean
[02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:18.320]  You start to study who runs things and it's just like really
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:22.280]  It's beyond any Hollywood movie. It's beyond
[02:34:25.800 --> 02:34:27.800]  And it's just the scale of it
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:30.920]  Joe Salete is our guest. I want to talk to him about
[02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:38.680]  All these revelations coming out. I mean from the government running radical Islam and funding it to the stock stock market
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:44.080]  Everything being rigged the NSA spying on us. I mean really everything I've been talking about for 20 years
[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:47.000]  Everything Gerald's been talking about for 35 years
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:51.960]  It's just all come out now. So so where do we go from here? I
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:57.240]  Always thought you exposed it that would do something instead. There's a doubling down. We'll talk to him in a moment

[02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:23.160]  Other leading competitors are like $60 70 and it's a charcoal filter. That's not what this does
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:28.080]  This isn't just some element that takes some of the bad taste out and reduces a little bit of stuff
[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:32.440]  This cuts out hundreds of different things or reduces it down to like 99%

[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:17.120]  I'm buying for storage, but it does thousands of gallons for the filter as we replaced
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:20.920]  It does have a replaceable filter you can get as well, but quite frankly, you know
[02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:27.240]  The filters are like 25 to $30 because they're expensive to make so you're getting a super good deal because it is filters included

[02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:41.120]  Colonial Kingston. He's having conferences. He's making the news. He's doing international media. He's doing domestic media
[02:38:41.120 --> 02:38:44.120]  He's reaching millions every week. He's doing his own daily show
[02:38:44.760 --> 02:38:50.920]  Video blog he's taking action. Well, he saved the world. No, but together we can bring back a renaissance
[02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:56.080]  And that's what he's been talking about the globalists admit they ugly top architecture. They ugly that close
[02:38:56.680 --> 02:39:04.360]  So we would lose respect for ourselves. They they had the CIA fund ugly art. They've done it scientifically. It's declassified
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:08.400]  Are they going to be successful suppressing humanity Gerald Salente?
[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:14.600]  No, and with every, you know, there was a great quote from Rand Paul right after he
[02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:21.020]  Announced that he was running for president and he was being interviewed on NBC and
[02:39:21.840 --> 02:39:28.920]  The host asked him if he always wanted to run for president. He said no, you know, he said I wasn't always on his mind
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:35.600]  He said but you know, I hear from the guys that are running out there that you hear from they wanted to be president
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:39.760]  run for president since they were in the eighth grade and
[02:39:40.400 --> 02:39:45.320]  That's what you have as I say the people that are running the show
[02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:48.120]  You said it a hundred times on this show thousands on your own
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:53.320]  They want to be the people running things since they were kids. That's not who you want
[02:39:53.320 --> 02:39:56.680]  You want to George Washington or an Eisenhower that doesn't want the job?
[02:39:56.680 --> 02:40:05.480]  And just as you couldn't stand these guys that wanted to be and women that wanted to be class president and Heather's student council in
[02:40:05.840 --> 02:40:10.520]  High school and college you can't stand them now and what I'm saying is
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:17.400]  Those are the people running the show. Why is everybody afraid of them?
[02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:19.400]  Of course, it could change
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:25.400]  There's nothing in the way to stop it other than the will and
[02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:31.440]  What they've done and you've been talking about it because when you put it all in context
[02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:33.760]  It's a neo
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:35.920]  feudal society
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:38.480]  We have a political elite an
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:44.400]  Economically privileged and we the little people you mentioned it before
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:51.960]  All of the forex rigging. It's a fact all of the live war rate rigging, you know the interest rates
[02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:59.280]  It's a gold silver. It's all come out. It's everything's rigged. It's rigged all of all of the quote missteps and
[02:40:59.960 --> 02:41:06.720]  misleading of the peanuts that they paid slap on the wrist finds not one hand rolls
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:12.880]  But look at the laws for we the little just like Corzine grabbed your bank account didn't get in trouble
[02:41:13.320 --> 02:41:20.080]  That's right. Nobody's ever heard about it again. So what happens is it's a neo feudal?
[02:41:20.080 --> 02:41:22.080]  society and
[02:41:22.400 --> 02:41:29.840]  The laws for the nobility are different than the peasants and that's what's happened in the country
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:34.400]  Anybody that has to deal with the government at any level
[02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:39.360]  Look what they do, you know, you asked me one time is on the last show
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:44.720]  Have I have been harassed, you know been treated unfairly by the police? I forgot
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:50.120]  I wrote a whole story in the Trends Journal. I called it to pee or not to pee
[02:41:50.120 --> 02:41:56.480]  I pulled off on a country road in the middle of nowhere in upstate, New York
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:01.280]  Yeah, where are you supposed to I mean growing up in Texas ever you say everybody pulled over peeing in a bush
[02:42:01.280 --> 02:42:03.840]  But I went I was going into the woods. I
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:08.280]  Had a convertible my top was down. It was 10 o'clock at night. I
[02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:14.760]  Wrote the story and I even sent the same letter that I wrote in the Trends Journal to the to the
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:21.680]  Court up here in in New York where this guy started harassing me to state trooper
[02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:30.440]  Who whom I looking for in the woods and he would not let me go to the bathroom and followed me for 45 minutes
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:34.680]  This guy harassed me wanted to start a confrontation
[02:42:34.680 --> 02:42:40.040]  So in a neo feudal society, don't go over that yellow line
[02:42:40.440 --> 02:42:43.120]  Your signal light was an on when you made a turn
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:47.960]  You had your brakes on with another car was coming at you but steal
[02:42:49.040 --> 02:42:56.560]  Trillions of dollars ruin the lives of tens of millions of people by foreclosing on their homes
[02:42:57.080 --> 02:43:02.400]  Robbing them everything you got and you know you get Alex you get dinner at the White House
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:06.880]  That's what you get. You don't do anything wrong
[02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:13.440]  Stay in line. We're gonna prosecute to the letter of the law because we're a neo feudal society
[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:19.800]  And what are the prestitutes to those disgusting human beings those media whores?
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:26.000]  I'll tell you what they do. Hey, you see what happened with this for I'm saying to myself
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:34.480]  What's a fifth row? Why is this thing on the front pages? Oh, I'll tell you why because people are into sports
[02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:40.760]  Oh, and you know what Alex? We're gonna have our attorney general who's letting all the
[02:43:41.560 --> 02:43:45.320]  Slimesters that are stealing from us that do nothing
[02:43:45.360 --> 02:43:48.560]  We're gonna go prosecute people in another country
[02:43:48.560 --> 02:43:52.600]  And you know why Alex because over a 24-year period
[02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:59.600]  They stole up to a hundred and fifty million dollars a hundred and fifty million dollars over
[02:44:00.280 --> 02:44:08.040]  24 years that's a second of stealing by the banks in the neo feudal United States
[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:14.320]  That's what's going on. We are being pushed into a hey
[02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:21.040]  You think I'm making it up every time you see the president the secretary of this Senate
[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:31.040]  They got a plane there's these 747s and red carpets and saluting everywhere. It's the nobility
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:35.360]  Other news items, I mean there's so much
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:41.840]  What do you make a builder burg in a six mile security perimeter threatening to arrest press if they step across an invisible line?
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:42.800]  I mean fences up
[02:44:42.800 --> 02:44:47.640]  I just say don't come in here as if everybody's read the newspaper or we're gonna put you in jail for two weeks
[02:44:47.640 --> 02:44:53.960]  Now they're flipping out on our reporters and here are a bunch of known criminals meaning in secret to set policy
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:57.760]  I think it's good news though that these shadow government organizations are being exposed
[02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:02.960]  It's good news for the people and again. I want to also pick up on what you said
[02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:07.800]  It's very important for every what could people do they need to support
[02:45:07.800 --> 02:45:13.320]  They need to buy the products that you're selling you're putting out quality products to bring improve people's lives
[02:45:13.320 --> 02:45:18.160]  Oh, by the way, that's another one of the big trends in the trends journal longevity and
[02:45:18.680 --> 02:45:22.440]  And so when we're talking about am I putting information out?
[02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:24.880]  They need to support us because you're right
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:31.920]  It is big news because I remember learning about the builder birds back, you know in early
[02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:34.440]  1980s when there was this newspaper
[02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:40.120]  I think was Liberty Lobby that they ended up putting out a business that this wonderful attorney
[02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:46.720]  I knew in Rhinebeck started turning me on to these things an older cat and now it's become common
[02:45:46.720 --> 02:45:52.440]  But you asked me what do I think about what they're doing how they're courting off the area? They're the nobility
[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:58.360]  That's the way you protect the nobility and that's what I'm trying to say
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:04.640]  It's up to the people now to really do something the power is in our hands
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:11.400]  And if the people would only understand that they would they wouldn't bow down to authority
[02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:16.240]  They wouldn't applaud freaks that show up and call themselves
[02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:22.240]  candidates and I'm sick of these presidential candidates talking tough
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:28.640]  I mean this Lindsey Graham, you know what he's gonna do what a thug putin is
[02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:33.320]  What is he gonna go over there and hit him with his handbag? I mean come on
[02:46:33.320 --> 02:46:38.920]  Marco Rubio Ted Cruz these guys couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:46.360]  And they all talk tough and they're talking tough to get our people killed and murder other millions
[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:48.360]  So what are the big trends?
[02:46:48.520 --> 02:46:54.600]  The trends on what people should do and how to prepare and I don't give financial advice
[02:46:54.840 --> 02:47:01.280]  You are seeing the volatility in the markets. You're seeing in the bond markets are seeing it on the oil markets
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:04.800]  You're seeing it in the equity markets. I'm still in gold and
[02:47:05.480 --> 02:47:12.160]  The other things what where do you see the big fears coming from? How many more?
[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:19.240]  Scares do we have to have oh this month? It was eggs a couple of months ago. It was pork
[02:47:20.800 --> 02:47:22.680]  Clean food
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:27.680]  It's the bit and clean water and all the implements that make that happen
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:35.640]  Self-sustaining those are the areas to look at and the biggest the biggest right now as we see it
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:37.640]  Just to put this into perspective
[02:47:37.680 --> 02:47:44.920]  They say that humans were created without getting into you know, I don't know when but they say a hundred thousand years ago
[02:47:45.080 --> 02:47:52.080]  It took from a hundred thousand years ago to 1900 to put one point six billion people on the planet
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:48:00.320]  In a hundred years, we've added almost six billion people. There's not enough stuff out there
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:07.720]  There's not enough resources in terms of clean food and clean water to support the planet
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:10.040]  those are the things to look into and
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:15.720]  Particularly you saw the new study that just came out about the obesity rates
[02:48:15.720 --> 02:48:22.520]  Ballooning worldwide and hey, we are the exceptionals here in America. We're number one
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:30.440]  So where are the trends? The trends are all in this area particularly with an aging baby boom population
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:32.760]  That's global
[02:48:32.760 --> 02:48:37.200]  How are they going to age healthy and it's not going to be medicine?
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:42.520]  It's going to be the mind so for example if you're feeling down
[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:46.240]  You haven't made it in life. You're trying to start a new one
[02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:52.760]  Wouldn't it be nice to go to a longevity center where you could get in shape physically emotionally and spiritually?
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:56.160]  Learn how to create the future you haven't done before
[02:48:56.800 --> 02:49:02.040]  Because your life is really when you were talking about the founding fathers. They were in kids
[02:49:02.560 --> 02:49:05.640]  They were adults. They were the elderly
[02:49:06.120 --> 02:49:11.320]  They were the ones that were respected the markets full on jeffety centers
[02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:18.120]  The markets for aging healthy the markets are building community. Oh, and then as the population ages
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:23.440]  Where are the real estate trends going to be they're going to be on the outskirts?
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:31.480]  Thriving metropolises in those small cities that went down a bit when the suburbs came in
[02:49:31.600 --> 02:49:37.200]  But now we're going to rejuvenate because as you get older, you don't want to drive anywhere
[02:49:37.200 --> 02:49:40.840]  You go to Florida and you say only
[02:49:41.640 --> 02:49:45.880]  Lunatics could have invented this joint. There's no man's transportation
[02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:48.200]  No rail
[02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:53.660]  Yeah, they got buses you see all these old people all you see is that George Collins joke
[02:49:53.660 --> 02:50:01.000]  Well father Guido saw dude she where you don't see the back of the head, you know these old people driving these cars
[02:50:01.320 --> 02:50:04.320]  So that's not the way to go into the future
[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:13.400]  so the future has a lot of opportunities and the United States still has the greatest opportunity is I see it of
[02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:19.680]  Any country in the world? Absolutely now when we come back we'll talk about the presidential reality show that you discussed your new
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:27.400]  Trends journal Hillary Clinton being maneuvered in to be the president her chief of staff basically her top advisors at Bilderberg
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:29.400]  That means they're behind her
[02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:32.840]  She's been many times before been fined Logan Act
[02:50:32.840 --> 02:50:36.760]  It just illustrates for me. It's emblematic of how
[02:50:37.680 --> 02:50:39.440]  arrogant they are
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:42.840]  Jeb Bush Hillary Clinton the optics of these
[02:50:43.600 --> 02:50:46.120]  Imperial want to be families. Why not just give them crowns?
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:52.000]  What's the between Queen Elizabeth and Kim Jong-un one doesn't have a crown the other ducks and
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:59.000]  As one senator said is the presidency a crown passed between two families
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:02.680]  Not available in California, Louisiana and Virginia

[02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:13.160]  Hey, did you know there's a company called ID stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic pickpocketing?
[02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:17.280]  Oh, I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing. What is that?
[02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:23.320]  Well, apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID
[02:53:23.400 --> 02:53:26.600]  The transmitter banking information to card readers when we pay
[02:53:27.320 --> 02:53:33.920]  Unfortunately a bad guy can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people collecting their credit card numbers and personal
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:41.320]  Information without us knowing it. Wow, that sounds scary since you're getting a new wallet. Anyway, you should definitely get an ID stronghold
[02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:48.880]  Shielded wallet. Are they more expensive? No, in fact, I can get a shielded leather wallet from ID stronghold calm for the same price or less
[02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:52.440]  Then regular unshielded wallets from other stores sounds great
[02:53:52.520 --> 02:53:55.480]  My wallet isn't falling apart yet, but let me pick one out, too
[02:53:55.480 --> 02:54:22.600]  I want to be protected and these wallets ID stronghold calm look fantastic. This is a little piece of me
[02:54:22.600 --> 02:54:28.800]  We'll die for the system
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:45.160]  That is David Bowie bring us in
[02:54:45.160 --> 02:54:53.440]  Broadcasting worldwide here in the final segment with Gerald Salente. I got three children
[02:54:56.160 --> 02:55:02.320]  We've got an article in infowars.com evil quotes by Bilderberg group members most these quotes are public that they put in books
[02:55:02.320 --> 02:55:08.200]  I mean, these are some nasty people. These are the totalitarians and they're trying to rebrand it right now
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:18.320]  Get Daniel's stories excellent curtain emos excellent all Steve Watson the Don Salazar all our great reporters
[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:27.520]  I try to list them all the show be over kill failing all the people behind the scenes camera TV
[02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:31.600]  It you know
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:37.800]  Narls Barkley song says was I crazy cuz I didn't know enough because I knew too much. I just know way too much now
[02:55:38.520 --> 02:55:42.520]  I'm not bragging either. It's not hard to figure out history and what's happening once you figure it out
[02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:46.160]  It's a lot of stuff. It's coming if you watch baseball you learn how baseball works
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:51.200]  I've been watching the globalist for 25 years and man. They seem to be getting worse
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:56.680]  They seem to be getting more reckless more wild more crazy. I mean, what about the Russia situation Gerald?
[02:55:56.680 --> 02:56:03.560]  Well, I mean we open the interview with that. I mean, they're sitting in armor. There's video Western troops battling the Russians
[02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:07.000]  That's Russian area. It's always been part of Russia off and on
[02:56:08.640 --> 02:56:13.040]  It's not Iraq, I mean the globalist couldn't hold Iraq
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:19.560]  Why do they want to attack Russia Russia's just trying to stabilize itself
[02:56:19.560 --> 02:56:26.240]  Why do the globalists have this instinct? I guess your audio was cut out for a moment
[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:32.120]  Why do the globalists have this instinct to try to wreck everything? I'm sorry. Go ahead. Yeah, it's it's the neocons
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:39.160]  It's that you know the Kagan's the new one or the wife of Kagan and it's this this sick mentality
[02:56:39.160 --> 02:56:43.320]  They're they're crazy people and everybody's afraid to call a spade a spade
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:51.440]  They're they're megalomaniacs their psychopaths and by their DJs shall know that and of course everyone knows the deal
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:55.640]  That wants to know it was that when Gorbachev made a deal with Reagan
[02:56:55.800 --> 02:57:01.840]  Was that NATO wasn't going to expand beyond the borders of where they were and under Clinton?
[02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:05.880]  They started doing it excelled on the bush and now of course we have
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:10.320]  American troops in the Stony and Lithuania the entire let's not forget
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:16.160]  Let's not forget the UN admits that the Croats and the Muslims killed double what the Serbs did they started the fight again
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:17.880]  I'm not lionizing the Serbs, but they started it
[02:57:17.880 --> 02:57:25.000]  We gave them a third of their country blew up their infrastructure their power plants water TV stations and then put
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:29.320]  Al Qaeda in charge KLA to run and in now every few weeks
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:33.000]  I read the foreign press where they go into Christian areas and murder everybody
[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:37.400]  I mean this is just it was all to take out an ally of Russia
[02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:43.960]  Exactly and it and again, you know, it's it's it you asked about you know
[02:57:43.960 --> 02:57:50.280]  Why they doing it with Russia and I was talking about this room before what was that really about Russia?
[02:57:50.560 --> 02:57:55.640]  It's really about Russia and again because most people know about sports
[02:57:55.720 --> 02:57:57.720]  They made it a sporting issue
[02:57:58.160 --> 02:58:00.920]  So that then the people that don't tune into anything
[02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:07.240]  All of a sudden are tuned into something and they know about it because it was about Russia
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:09.400]  You go back to our spring
[02:58:10.280 --> 02:58:16.920]  2014 trends journal and it was about the Ukraine crisis and how we showed how they use the
[02:58:17.480 --> 02:58:22.400]  Social Olympics to lead up to the Ukraine crisis sure sure stay there

[02:58:25.520 --> 02:58:28.520]  They want to isolate Russia so they can then point out I'm gonna say look
[02:58:28.520 --> 02:58:34.760]  They're totally isolated when they kick them out of g7 and and and then now take away their World Cup
[02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:40.560]  So they can't have anything for their economy. I mean it is economic warfare as Ron Paul has said

[03:00:28.200 --> 03:00:30.520]  You were getting into this russian situation. It's just
[03:00:31.640 --> 03:00:37.960]  Crazy's the word. I keep overusing it. It just shows an arrogance a bravada a hootspa
[03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:43.880]  Uh, do you agree with me that it is getting worse? They are getting more insane or is it just we know more about it now Gerald?
[03:00:44.440 --> 03:00:46.040]  No, they're more insane
[03:00:46.040 --> 03:00:51.240]  Because smart people wouldn't do this you made the point about look they can't win in a rock in afghanistan
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:54.040]  Libby is a mess. You're gonna beat the russians
[03:00:54.760 --> 03:00:56.760]  I mean apolly and couldn't pull it off
[03:00:57.320 --> 03:01:01.880]  Hitler launched the largest military offensive in world history and he couldn't do it
[03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:06.120]  It'll be the end of life. It'll be what what einstein said
[03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:09.400]  I don't know how the third world war will be fought
[03:01:09.720 --> 03:01:15.400]  But the fourth will be fought with sticks and stuff invading russia is would be like invading the u.s. Everybody's gonna fight
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:18.840]  Exactly, and it'll be it'll be annihilation
[03:01:19.640 --> 03:01:25.240]  And so the neocons think and the military industrial complex by putting more
[03:01:26.040 --> 03:01:31.560]  Weapons on the russian border. They won't be able to retaliate. They're out of their mind
[03:01:31.560 --> 03:01:37.400]  And and again going back to how they're using the propaganda. They use this fifth for example
[03:01:37.720 --> 03:01:43.160]  I said when we wrote about the trends journal back a year ago how they use the social Olympics
[03:01:43.480 --> 03:01:51.400]  You remember don't get on a plane to go there. They got toothpaste bombers. I tell you oh and those black widow bombers
[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:54.280]  They're there too. And you know what else alex?
[03:01:54.840 --> 03:01:56.840]  the water is all yellow
[03:01:56.840 --> 03:02:05.160]  And they shoot stray dogs and hate homophobes by the time the winter olympics began in sochi
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:14.920]  57% of americans believe there would be a terrorist strike and the ratings of america's attitude toward russia was at a
[03:02:16.200 --> 03:02:18.200]  1993 low
[03:02:18.920 --> 03:02:20.920]  They're using the propaganda
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:23.240]  And disgusting you in beings
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:31.720]  That are the prostitutes and the media whores because they get paid to put out keep putting out those lies
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:38.200]  What was russia's crime arresting all the Rockefeller and Rothschild banker fronts that came out in court and kicking them out
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:43.400]  I mean, what was russia's big crime? I mean, I guess not accelerating their population decline
[03:02:43.880 --> 03:02:46.920]  Having pro-family events. I mean, what did russia do that made him so mad?
[03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:55.160]  It's it's russia is a threat because of these sick people that believe that the united states is going to be
[03:02:55.560 --> 03:02:57.560]  The superpower around the world
[03:02:58.280 --> 03:03:00.840]  And they just don't want to have any competition
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:03.400]  They you read their work
[03:03:04.200 --> 03:03:11.320]  They should be in an insane asylum speaking of which you heard rumsfeld come out about how now, you know
[03:03:11.320 --> 03:03:18.280]  He's not so sure about iraq and you know, it wasn't good to try to exploit democracy. Who's he talking about?
[03:03:18.520 --> 03:03:22.120]  This is the little clown that lied that we know where those
[03:03:22.760 --> 03:03:26.680]  WMD's are the east and north they're south you remember that
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:32.440]  You remember him coming out that the world is better off without Saddam who said and then he said that he never said that
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:34.600]  Then he said he never said they were north of tukrit
[03:03:35.800 --> 03:03:37.800]  Oh, yeah, I had the quote it's there
[03:03:37.800 --> 03:03:43.720]  Oh, I know he's an incredible liar almost as good as obama or almost that's what i'm saying when you ask who these people are
[03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:50.280]  They're sick people and no one wants to call them that instead. They call them secretary of this
[03:03:50.760 --> 03:03:53.560]  president that a prime minister a chancellor
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:58.120]  Well, and i want to point out a lot of folks go good. They want america to dominate the world
[03:03:58.120 --> 03:04:02.680]  No, they don't the very same globalists are targeting small farms small ranches small industry
[03:04:02.680 --> 03:04:08.760]  They're monopoly men they're worldwide using american muscle to take over the planet while we get the blame
[03:04:09.080 --> 03:04:10.520]  So let's be clear
[03:04:10.520 --> 03:04:13.480]  They they want to screw russia over they want to screw us over as well
[03:04:14.200 --> 03:04:22.040]  You got it and that's one of the stories. It's the grand manipulation. It's a takeover. It's a multinational takeover
[03:04:22.200 --> 03:04:26.280]  And they've turned this country into slave landia
[03:04:26.280 --> 03:04:33.880]  Yeah, we talk about the why the markets are going up two reasons and two reasons only the cheap money allows
[03:04:34.040 --> 03:04:39.000]  Companies to buy back their stock and the other one is mergers and acquisitions
[03:04:39.640 --> 03:04:42.040]  So that the big could gobble up more
[03:04:42.680 --> 03:04:50.600]  Fire people and give them no money to work there. Isn't it wonderful wall march is going to pay $10
[03:04:50.600 --> 03:04:58.920]  An hour half of their employees are part-time workers. You're right. Gerald. Thank you so much. Thank you powerful interview
