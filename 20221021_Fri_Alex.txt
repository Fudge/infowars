[00:00.000 --> 00:19.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, America is potentially experiencing and is about to experience the
[00:19.080 --> 00:27.320]  darkest day in its history in the very near future.
[00:27.320 --> 00:33.480]  I'm going to break down exactly why I feel that way today and I've got a couple great
[00:33.480 --> 00:37.840]  guests coming up as well, Norm Pattis, Mike Adams.
[00:37.840 --> 00:44.320]  I'm so flippantly enraged at the news cycle today and what is happening to our country
[00:44.320 --> 00:49.040]  with just the ignorance and brainwashing of the average American.
[00:49.040 --> 00:51.640]  It's a challenge to even come on air and do the show.
[00:51.640 --> 00:55.700]  It's a good thing Alex is out, hopefully he's enjoying some nice weather, hopefully he's
[00:55.700 --> 01:00.400]  enjoying some outdoors, enjoying some peace and quiet because I mean this country is so
[01:00.400 --> 01:03.560]  screwed man, it's bad, it's really bad.
[01:03.560 --> 01:08.000]  I don't like coming on air like this, I don't like coming on air being doom and gloom but
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.160]  that's just the damn reality of it.
[01:11.160 --> 01:15.760]  So I'm going to get into all the news, we do have a big announcement with Norm Pattis
[01:15.760 --> 01:25.120]  involving some legal stuff here that is coming up in about 20 minutes and then Mike Adams
[01:25.120 --> 01:27.480]  is going to have big breaking news as well.
[01:27.480 --> 01:32.400]  Not to mention Pete Santilli is going to have huge breaking news at three o'clock on the
[01:32.400 --> 01:38.680]  war room with a Clinton involved company now getting sued for almost a billion dollars
[01:38.680 --> 01:40.960]  for support for terrorism.
[01:40.960 --> 01:47.520]  So all kinds of big developments today but first you know this debate and this is a small
[01:47.520 --> 01:56.920]  clip from the walk away debate that happened featuring Shamika Michelle and you had a debate
[01:56.920 --> 02:01.840]  on the issue of abortion going on, there were a lot of different issues being debated but
[02:01.840 --> 02:08.720]  I think that this clip right here which is encapsulated down, not the full clip but encapsulated
[02:08.720 --> 02:17.200]  down for time really puts the whole abortion argument into perspective and the sad part
[02:17.200 --> 02:24.160]  is it doesn't even matter, liberals, leftists, democrats, they don't even care about reality
[02:24.160 --> 02:28.760]  folks, they've committed to the lies because it makes them more comfortable and it makes
[02:28.760 --> 02:31.840]  their lifestyle acceptable.
[02:31.840 --> 02:38.840]  But here's Shamika Michelle I think burying the abortion argument here in clip seven
[02:38.840 --> 02:41.480]  at the walk away debate.
[02:41.480 --> 02:46.520]  According to the Black Lives Matter website, the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision opens
[02:46.520 --> 02:52.200]  the door to statewide bans and subsequent rulings that will harm black people disproportionately.
[02:52.200 --> 02:57.960]  Since the Roe decision in 1973, 19 million black babies have been aborted, which is nearly
[02:57.960 --> 03:00.600]  half of the current black population in America.
[03:00.600 --> 03:04.800]  How can the organization that insists they have the authority on protecting black lives
[03:04.800 --> 03:10.160]  also claim it is detrimental to black people to have restricted access to a procedure that
[03:10.160 --> 03:12.360]  has ended 19 million black lives?
[03:12.360 --> 03:17.720]  A black woman has never had autonomy over her body in this country.
[03:17.720 --> 03:24.640]  She was used as a baby manufacturing machine for her slave owner who needed more and more
[03:24.640 --> 03:28.600]  people when they stopped allowing slaves to be brought over to the United States.
[03:28.600 --> 03:33.440]  I just want to ask Reese as a black woman if she had autonomy over her body when she
[03:33.440 --> 03:35.960]  caught her legs up and got that baby in her stomach.
[03:35.960 --> 03:40.080]  Okay we're going to just go ahead and say no, absolutely not.
[03:40.080 --> 03:45.000]  And so just to be clear, you're asking literally does she have autonomy over her body because
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  she...
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.160]  Her point was black women have never had the ability to have autonomy over our bodies
[03:51.160 --> 03:52.560]  and that is a lie.
[03:52.560 --> 03:59.240]  This is 2022 and women have the ability to decide yes or no, I want to have sex or I
[03:59.240 --> 04:00.240]  don't.
[04:00.240 --> 04:01.960]  I want to take birth control or I don't.
[04:01.960 --> 04:06.760]  We need to stop telling these lies as if we just happen to fall on a penis and get pregnant.
[04:06.760 --> 04:08.000]  That's not how it works.
[04:08.000 --> 04:11.680]  My mother was raped at 14 walking to cheer camp.
[04:11.680 --> 04:13.960]  I am that baby.
[04:13.960 --> 04:20.040]  So when y'all sit here and talk about something that is less than 1% of all abortions as is,
[04:20.040 --> 04:23.280]  that is the reason why we have abortions.
[04:23.280 --> 04:28.440]  That is not the truth and I want us to stop lying about it and I want us as women to be
[04:28.440 --> 04:33.600]  responsible and have accountability and stop trying to blame everybody else for what's
[04:33.600 --> 04:35.600]  going on with our bodies.
[04:35.600 --> 04:41.240]  Do you see why debate, political debate is so necessary in this country?
[04:41.240 --> 04:45.280]  I mean folks, we're like, we're desperate, we're thirsty in the desert for political
[04:45.280 --> 04:46.680]  debate and we're not getting it.
[04:46.680 --> 04:48.400]  But that's why the left doesn't want to debate.
[04:48.400 --> 04:53.320]  Shamika Michelle just destroyed the entire leftist argument on abortion.
[04:53.320 --> 04:55.080]  Oh, we don't have autonomy over you.
[04:55.080 --> 04:56.360]  Yeah you do.
[04:56.360 --> 05:01.120]  Stop lying about it.
[05:01.120 --> 05:06.440]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[05:06.440 --> 05:07.760]  you.
[05:07.760 --> 05:11.680]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars because they rightly see
[05:11.680 --> 05:16.760]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[05:16.760 --> 05:21.000]  the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.040]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from info wars.com
[05:27.040 --> 05:31.760]  and to also financially support info wars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using
[05:31.760 --> 05:36.680]  promo code 1776 at checkout to get additional 10% off.
[05:36.680 --> 05:39.080]  These people are coming for your birthright.
[05:39.080 --> 05:40.240]  They're coming for your First Amendment.
[05:40.240 --> 05:43.520]  They admit once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[05:43.520 --> 05:47.520]  I am in your hands and I'm asking of your support now who have my commitment to never
[05:47.520 --> 05:50.880]  give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.
[05:50.880 --> 05:54.320]  Thank you for all your past support and I'm encouraging you now to redouble your efforts
[05:54.320 --> 06:00.400]  at infowarsstore.com with promo code 1776 for additional 10% off on the already big sales
[06:00.400 --> 06:08.440]  and huge discount.
[06:08.440 --> 06:16.280]  You found it, the tip of the spear, it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer.
[06:16.280 --> 06:29.520]  There you have US senators in both parties saying we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia
[06:29.520 --> 06:32.760]  first and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before.
[06:32.760 --> 06:34.960]  What do you think that makes the Russians do?
[06:34.960 --> 06:41.120]  Well, it makes them go into war mode, so I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[06:41.120 --> 06:46.040]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert only one level above that
[06:46.040 --> 06:50.240]  on their death con just like our system and that's fire the weapons.
[06:50.240 --> 06:56.280]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying let's just use nuclear weapons
[06:56.280 --> 06:57.280]  on Russia.
[06:57.280 --> 07:03.560]  Think of their interests, Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea launched
[07:03.560 --> 07:09.160]  missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[07:09.160 --> 07:14.880]  Sea launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5, land launch system they can also launch
[07:14.880 --> 07:20.680]  ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down and yes, the United States has those
[07:20.680 --> 07:21.680]  too.
[07:21.680 --> 07:25.920]  That's a Pentagon lie that tries to develop systems that we don't have.
[07:25.920 --> 07:28.120]  It's on record the US has those systems.
[07:28.120 --> 07:34.600]  The point is it's called mutually assured destruction or mad for a reason because anyone
[07:34.600 --> 07:39.840]  that would violate the mad doctrine is insane and you know I'm on the side of not having
[07:39.840 --> 07:43.760]  a nuclear war especially when Russia is not starting to fight with us and especially after
[07:43.760 --> 07:48.200]  we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia when that
[07:48.200 --> 07:49.440]  was all a giant lie.
[07:49.440 --> 07:54.280]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[07:54.280 --> 08:01.720]  So that was Alex Jones back in March of this year and we've got more throwbacks from Alex
[08:01.720 --> 08:06.720]  Jones from over a decade ago, a couple years ago.
[08:06.720 --> 08:09.760]  It's all coming up today on the Alex Jones show.
[08:09.760 --> 08:16.200]  I want Troyer here filling in and I got to tell you the duty is heavy today.
[08:16.200 --> 08:22.840]  The duty is heavy today and it's not just the understood concept of mutually assured
[08:22.840 --> 08:28.560]  destruction when it comes to a world war we're dealing with on a lower level on a more local
[08:28.560 --> 08:33.160]  level mutually assured destruction of our country right now.
[08:33.160 --> 08:38.360]  What do you think happens when one side of the political aisle gets censored, one side
[08:38.360 --> 08:44.040]  of the political aisle gets imprisoned, one side of the political aisle gets debanked,
[08:44.040 --> 08:50.920]  deplatformed, attacked, lied about, how long can that go on?
[08:50.920 --> 08:54.840]  And so what option is that side of the political aisle left with?
[08:54.840 --> 08:59.040]  Either become a slave or fight back for their freedom.
[08:59.040 --> 09:03.400]  That's mutually assured destruction.
[09:03.400 --> 09:12.480]  Now this is breaking as we go on air today, Steve Bannon sentenced to four months in prison
[09:12.480 --> 09:18.120]  for contempt of the January 6 committee, a sham committee, a bullshit committee, a big
[09:18.120 --> 09:21.040]  lie about what happened on January 6.
[09:21.040 --> 09:26.080]  Democrats burned dozens of major cities in this country for an entire summer in the name
[09:26.080 --> 09:33.680]  of George Floyd who they lied about how he died, billions of property damage, dozens
[09:33.680 --> 09:39.880]  of murders, hundreds of police officers hospitalized, thousands of assaults, cities boarded up,
[09:39.880 --> 09:42.800]  many have never even come back to life.
[09:42.800 --> 09:46.960]  And then they tell you January 6 was an insurrection and a terror attack when the government sends
[09:46.960 --> 09:51.120]  out an emergency alert everybody goes home and obeys.
[09:51.120 --> 09:55.960]  And they lie and they say police officers were murdered on January 6, not a single
[09:55.960 --> 09:59.280]  police officer died that day.
[09:59.280 --> 10:06.560]  So I'm real hot under the collar today because it's just a fact, everything that comes from
[10:06.560 --> 10:11.160]  the political left in America in the year 2022 is based in a lie.
[10:11.160 --> 10:13.320]  Every single thing.
[10:13.320 --> 10:19.240]  There is not a single basis of truth that the American left and the Democrat party can
[10:19.240 --> 10:21.960]  derive any of their policy from.
[10:21.960 --> 10:30.880]  Not a, not a centella, whether it's abortion, whether it's January 6, whether it's the energy
[10:30.880 --> 10:35.840]  crisis, whether it's inflation, whether it's Ukraine and Russia, you will not find any
[10:35.840 --> 10:36.840]  truth now.
[10:36.840 --> 10:37.840]  None.
[10:37.840 --> 10:38.840]  It's all lies.
[10:38.840 --> 10:39.840]  It's all propaganda.
[10:39.840 --> 10:43.400]  And that's why Tulsi Gabbard left the Democrat party.
[10:43.400 --> 10:47.640]  That's why the congressman from, I think it was New Hampshire left the Democrat party.
[10:47.640 --> 10:50.360]  That's why Joe Rogan, who's a liberal said vote Republican.
[10:50.360 --> 10:53.240]  That's why Elon Musk said, I can't, I can't vote Democrat ever.
[10:53.240 --> 10:54.640]  I'm going to be voting Republican.
[10:54.640 --> 10:57.720]  That's why you have the Blexit black people leaving the Republican party.
[10:57.720 --> 11:02.120]  That's why you have the Lexit Latino people leaving the Republican party, the Democrat
[11:02.120 --> 11:03.120]  party.
[11:03.120 --> 11:06.960]  That's why you have the walk away movement, other voters leaving the Democrat party.
[11:06.960 --> 11:10.520]  That's why you have gays against groomers saying, I'm not going to sit here and watch
[11:10.520 --> 11:12.600]  liberals groom children for sex.
[11:12.600 --> 11:14.520]  I'm, I'm not going to do that.
[11:14.520 --> 11:20.520]  And now you have the Jigsit Jews leaving the Democrat party.
[11:20.520 --> 11:27.000]  You look at the numbers for CNN, MSNBC, late night news, nobody's watching their bullcrap.
[11:27.000 --> 11:34.240]  Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Jesse Waters, all have higher ratings than
[11:34.240 --> 11:38.200]  all the other left, left wing news combined in prime time.
[11:38.200 --> 11:42.800]  And yet they sit here and tell you they're about to win the midterms because they know
[11:42.800 --> 11:45.840]  they're about to steal it.
[11:45.840 --> 11:49.920]  And maybe it's not just that they steal it at the polls.
[11:49.920 --> 11:53.440]  They use their propaganda in mainstream media to steal it and rig it.
[11:53.440 --> 11:57.560]  They use their justice department to go after Republicans so people think that Republicans
[11:57.560 --> 12:01.360]  are the bad guys when they arrest Steve Bannon and put him in jail for, for four months.
[12:01.360 --> 12:02.360]  People don't know any better.
[12:02.360 --> 12:03.520]  They think, oh, he must be a criminal.
[12:03.520 --> 12:05.840]  When they impeach Donald Trump twice, they don't know any better.
[12:05.840 --> 12:09.520]  They think, oh, he must be a criminal.
[12:09.520 --> 12:11.600]  They have all of their bots on Twitter right now.
[12:11.600 --> 12:14.480]  If you're a Twitter user, you've certainly noticed this.
[12:14.480 --> 12:21.080]  You can't even log on to Twitter without getting every fourth tweet now is Democrat party propaganda
[12:21.080 --> 12:26.400]  from an account that you don't follow is forced onto your newsfeed telling you how bad Republicans
[12:26.400 --> 12:28.200]  are and how great Democrats are.
[12:28.200 --> 12:33.040]  It's a full on onsalot and they just want to delay the Twitter handover to Elon Musk
[12:33.040 --> 12:38.840]  till after the midterms so that they can rig the elections with their propaganda on Twitter
[12:38.840 --> 12:40.320]  until then.
[12:40.320 --> 12:42.760]  It is a dark day, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:42.760 --> 12:45.280]  The Democrats have hundreds of political prisoners.
[12:45.280 --> 12:46.480]  There's news stories today.
[12:46.480 --> 12:53.920]  They sent 30 agents after a army veteran and, and, and beat him and his wife up before taking
[12:53.920 --> 12:54.920]  them to jail.
[12:54.920 --> 12:59.120]  They just sent in Steve Bannon to four months in prison for contempt of the January 6 committee,
[12:59.120 --> 13:04.280]  a sham committee.
[13:04.280 --> 13:05.800]  Our only hope now is a miracle from God.
[13:05.800 --> 13:06.800]  I'm not going to lie to you.
[13:06.800 --> 13:08.440]  It's not only hope.
[13:08.440 --> 13:13.920]  We need a miracle from God or you can consider freedom in America dead and, and, and that
[13:13.920 --> 13:15.600]  regard the country's dead.
[13:15.600 --> 13:16.840]  So yeah, I'm a little upset.
[13:16.840 --> 13:21.200]  I'm a little depressed today because I can see the future and where it's going and there
[13:21.200 --> 13:27.520]  is nothing I see good about the future unless there's a miracle from God because the next
[13:27.520 --> 13:31.960]  two to three years in this country folks are going to be a disaster.
[13:31.960 --> 13:37.920]  Now after that, maybe there's hope because it's going to get so bad in this country that
[13:37.920 --> 13:41.120]  it doesn't matter political, left, right, Republican, Democrat, it's not going to make
[13:41.120 --> 13:42.120]  a difference.
[13:42.120 --> 13:43.680]  You're going to see total depression.
[13:43.680 --> 13:48.520]  You're going to see starvation, food chain collapse, supply chain collapse, thousands
[13:48.520 --> 13:53.560]  of prisoners, you'll be in jail, bank account shut down.
[13:53.560 --> 13:57.840]  This is, this is the full power grab and, and why wouldn't they steal it for the Democrats?
[13:57.840 --> 14:01.400]  The globalists need the Democrats in there when all of this goes down.
[14:01.400 --> 14:04.640]  And I haven't even begun to talk about the chances of nuclear war that increase every
[14:04.640 --> 14:06.640]  day that Biden is in office.
[14:06.640 --> 14:12.280]  Oh, what about that killer vaccine that they now want to give to your little kids?
[14:12.280 --> 14:13.280]  What about that?
[14:13.280 --> 14:18.360]  Oh, what about the drag queen stripper time for kids where they take, they take perverts
[14:18.360 --> 14:23.320]  and prostitutes and rapists and they, and they allow them to have access to your children
[14:23.320 --> 14:26.880]  and they grab them and touch them just like Joe Biden.
[14:26.880 --> 14:30.480]  Oh yeah.
[14:30.480 --> 14:32.800]  These people are such frauds.
[14:32.800 --> 14:33.800]  It's unbelievable.
[14:33.800 --> 14:38.040]  Here, here's just one example, and we've got Norm Patis coming up in the next segment
[14:38.040 --> 14:43.760]  with big legal developments as far as the latest case is concerned.
[14:43.760 --> 14:51.040]  Here's a, here's a perfect example of the fraud that we're dealing with right here.
[14:51.040 --> 14:59.040]  So the Biden administration has agreed to send another $50 billion to Ukraine.
[14:59.040 --> 15:04.040]  So the number of overall money sent to Ukraine is $100 billion from the United States.
[15:04.040 --> 15:06.080]  Now Zelensky is still begging for more money.
[15:06.080 --> 15:10.400]  He met with the central bankers today, Goldman Sachs, to ask for more help.
[15:10.400 --> 15:16.840]  And he wants people censored on the internet that, that speak out against him.
[15:16.840 --> 15:18.640]  He's not a totalitarian at all.
[15:18.640 --> 15:23.600]  But okay, $100 billion for Ukraine, $100 billion.
[15:23.600 --> 15:29.840]  Do you guys recall just a year ago that they told Elon Musk that if he gave $6 billion to
[15:29.840 --> 15:32.800]  the UN, he could solve world hunger?
[15:32.800 --> 15:33.800]  You remember that?
[15:33.800 --> 15:34.800]  Here's NPR.
[15:34.800 --> 15:39.440]  How $6 billion from Elon Musk could feed millions on the brink of famine.
[15:39.440 --> 15:45.400]  CNN, UN to Elon Musk, here's that $6 billion plan to fight world hunger.
[15:45.400 --> 15:52.040]  So if $6 billion can end world hunger, what can $100 billion do?
[15:52.040 --> 15:53.960]  End a world war?
[15:53.960 --> 15:56.200]  Because that's what they're about to do, folks.
[15:56.200 --> 16:00.840]  So $6 billion to solve world hunger, but $100 billion for Ukraine.
[16:00.840 --> 16:01.840]  It's our bestseller.
[16:01.840 --> 16:06.440]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[16:06.440 --> 16:11.000]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.840]  and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall bestseller.
[16:14.840 --> 16:18.360]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[16:18.360 --> 16:23.840]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[16:23.840 --> 16:24.840]  function of the body.
[16:24.840 --> 16:29.640]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[16:29.640 --> 16:32.200]  need to live and be healthy.
[16:32.200 --> 16:34.480]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[16:34.480 --> 16:36.200]  And so much of the food is debased.
[16:36.200 --> 16:41.320]  There's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses
[16:41.320 --> 16:42.320]  with a product like this.
[16:42.320 --> 16:46.000]  Now, there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.480]  very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the infill war.

[18:08.080 --> 18:09.400]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[18:09.400 --> 18:13.360]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[18:13.360 --> 18:17.680]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride, and when

[18:33.600 --> 18:37.480]  few drops every day, and almost everyone has dramatic results.

[19:05.480 --> 19:09.800]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers
[19:09.800 --> 19:15.120]  and stories we've broken together, this family that is infill wars.
[19:15.120 --> 19:20.240]  Think about how infill wars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bal Senaro and
[19:20.240 --> 19:27.720]  other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their
[19:27.720 --> 19:31.200]  main base to defeat the New World Order.
[19:31.200 --> 19:36.960]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[19:36.960 --> 19:41.440]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[19:41.440 --> 19:45.040]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit.
[19:45.040 --> 19:49.440]  And now infill wars is facing its darkest hours, it isn't going to give up.
[19:49.440 --> 19:51.200]  Without your support we can be shut down.
[19:51.200 --> 19:54.600]  Please go to saveinfillwars.com today.
[19:54.600 --> 20:01.040]  Saveinfillwars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[20:01.040 --> 20:07.040]  Reading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:43.980 --> 20:48.680]  and
[20:48.680 --> 20:54.000]  it's actually heartbreaking to see the left celebrating this thinking that this is somehow
[20:54.000 --> 20:59.480]  going to be their redemption or I don't know what it is.
[20:59.480 --> 21:03.280]  But man, oh man, it is rough stuff.
[21:03.280 --> 21:09.160]  And of course Alex Jones and infill wars are always the test case with a lot of their corporate
[21:09.160 --> 21:15.720]  fascism and political oppression with the censorship and now the billion dollar lawsuit
[21:15.720 --> 21:19.120]  that they're now trying to use the precedent against Kanye West and Fox News and others.
[21:19.120 --> 21:25.160]  So Norm Pattis joins me now, the legal representation for Alex in this case.
[21:25.160 --> 21:31.240]  And Norm, I understand there's some developments here on the legal front and perhaps some plans
[21:31.240 --> 21:32.320]  moving forward.
[21:32.320 --> 21:33.840]  What updates can you give us today?
[21:33.840 --> 21:39.080]  You know, I just finished proofreading the final version of our petition for a new trial.
[21:39.080 --> 21:41.920]  It's due today, the 10th day after the verdict.
[21:41.920 --> 21:46.360]  And we're working, as soon as I'm off the air here, I'll finish working on our final
[21:46.360 --> 21:52.120]  draft of a motion for what's called remittiter to reduce the verdict on the grounds that
[21:52.120 --> 21:56.960]  the verdict is unsupported by the evidence and as a result of speculation, passion and
[21:56.960 --> 22:01.760]  anger by inviolation of the defendant's right to due process of law.
[22:01.760 --> 22:04.000]  So both these motions will be filed today.
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.960]  The plaintiffs are expected to file their motion for punitive damages under Katpa.
[22:08.960 --> 22:14.400]  This afternoon we'll have some reply briefs due to one another next week, hearings in
[22:14.400 --> 22:19.320]  early November and then argument on November 7th about what the final judgment in this
[22:19.320 --> 22:20.520]  case should be.
[22:20.520 --> 22:27.320]  But from our perspective, Alex Jones' free speech systems was denied a fair trial and
[22:27.320 --> 22:30.320]  we want a new trial.
[22:30.320 --> 22:35.440]  And so it sounds like this process, at least in the next two to three weeks, there's going
[22:35.440 --> 22:37.560]  to be a lot of developments.
[22:37.560 --> 22:40.960]  Is that kind of a key factor to see where the future goes?
[22:40.960 --> 22:41.960]  Yes.
[22:41.960 --> 22:45.560]  I mean, new trial, post trial, these are called post trial motions.
[22:45.560 --> 22:50.240]  That's the class of things that we're discussing and post trial motions are routine, especially
[22:50.240 --> 22:54.520]  in a case where the verdict is as shockingly large as this one.
[22:54.520 --> 22:57.240]  You know, I'm asking for a new trial.
[22:57.240 --> 22:59.520]  Do I expect to get one from Judge Bellis?
[22:59.520 --> 23:04.680]  I candidly know, but I want the issue squarely before the court so that when the appellate
[23:04.680 --> 23:09.880]  court gets this case, as it ultimately will, it can see exactly what happened here.
[23:09.880 --> 23:16.960]  And in my view, the jury was misled and a caricature was held up to the jury of Infowars
[23:16.960 --> 23:20.400]  and Alex Jones as marketing rage to make a buck.
[23:20.400 --> 23:25.200]  And the question that was never answered is, does Alex Jones create his viewers or do his
[23:25.200 --> 23:29.720]  viewers come to Mr. Jones because they see a world in disarray?
[23:29.720 --> 23:33.760]  And Mr. Jones and you or others at Infowars are offering answers.
[23:33.760 --> 23:38.120]  They may not be answers that everyone likes, but we're entitled to reckon with the world
[23:38.120 --> 23:41.120]  as we see fit, according to our own lights.
[23:41.120 --> 23:46.800]  In this case, the plaintiffs persuaded the court that you all didn't comply with discoveries
[23:46.800 --> 23:48.520]  substantially comply.
[23:48.520 --> 23:53.720]  Yet you gave tens of thousands of documents, emails, internal documents, financial information.
[23:53.720 --> 23:59.760]  You and others set for dozens of depositions, responded in writing to material, answered
[23:59.760 --> 24:01.880]  what are known as requests for admission.
[24:01.880 --> 24:07.440]  You bathed them in tens, if not hundreds of thousands of documents and scores, if not
[24:07.440 --> 24:10.120]  hundreds of hours of deposition testimony.
[24:10.120 --> 24:15.680]  They had the benefit of all of that when they went to trial and you were denied the right
[24:15.680 --> 24:16.920]  to defend yourself.
[24:16.920 --> 24:21.800]  You were defaulted for not giving them everything they asked for in the form in which they wanted
[24:21.800 --> 24:22.800]  it.
[24:22.800 --> 24:27.120]  And the result of the default was you were prohibited to defend yourself.
[24:27.120 --> 24:32.360]  Yet the defendant or the plaintiffs, rather, were able to use everything that you gave
[24:32.360 --> 24:35.800]  them, everything against you to ask for money.
[24:35.800 --> 24:38.480]  And in our view, that is fundamentally unfair.
[24:38.480 --> 24:45.120]  If it would be one thing if you all had ignored the lawsuit, had failed to answer it, had failed
[24:45.120 --> 24:50.560]  to give any documents, had failed to do anything in response to the plaintiff's discovery
[24:50.560 --> 24:51.560]  request.
[24:51.560 --> 24:56.440]  In that case, the default might be warranted, but the law is that defaults have to be proportionate
[24:56.440 --> 24:57.560]  to the harm.
[24:57.560 --> 25:00.720]  And in this case, it was wildly disproportionate.
[25:00.720 --> 25:03.200]  You didn't adhere to their standard of perfection.
[25:03.200 --> 25:07.480]  They got a default and they were able to use all that you gave them against you.
[25:07.480 --> 25:12.120]  And they used it, in my view, to create a fiction that doesn't exist as a matter of
[25:12.120 --> 25:13.120]  law.
[25:13.120 --> 25:17.960]  And that fiction is the following, you gin up rage to sell products, you don't believe
[25:17.960 --> 25:23.480]  a word of what you say, and you sense people out intentionally to harm the plaintiffs and
[25:23.480 --> 25:24.480]  Sandy Hook.
[25:24.480 --> 25:27.120]  I have spent years with all of you folks.
[25:27.120 --> 25:29.440]  I have spent months on your campus.
[25:29.440 --> 25:33.240]  I've spent probably thousands of hours on this case.
[25:33.240 --> 25:38.360]  And I can tell you that none of that is true as I see it and as I understand it.
[25:38.360 --> 25:43.200]  So the default was used to create a straw man to present to the jury, and then they were
[25:43.200 --> 25:49.800]  able to blow hot air onto that straw man and set it afire to the tune of a billion dollars.
[25:49.800 --> 25:55.480]  In the trial itself, nobody, there was no evidence from a medical professional, no evidence
[25:55.480 --> 26:01.160]  from a mental health professional, no evidence from a third party that anybody was ever sent
[26:01.160 --> 26:02.960]  to harass these folks.
[26:02.960 --> 26:09.040]  Not yet the jurors were told that as a result of the default, these things had quote unquote
[26:09.040 --> 26:10.320]  been established.
[26:10.320 --> 26:14.640]  So things that no evidence support were deemed to be true, half-truths were presented as
[26:14.640 --> 26:18.960]  whole truths, and the plaintiffs basically said to the jury, you know, give us a lot
[26:18.960 --> 26:20.880]  to stop Alex Jones.
[26:20.880 --> 26:23.600]  That's not a compensatory damages argument.
[26:23.600 --> 26:25.600]  That's a punitive damages argument.
[26:25.600 --> 26:31.000]  And we think that even in the context of a default, you were entitled to a fair trial
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.760]  and you were deprived of one and we think you should have a new trial.
[26:34.760 --> 26:35.760]  And I feel strongly about that.
[26:35.760 --> 26:40.440]  I am very confident that if you get, if the appellate court follows the law, you will
[26:40.440 --> 26:41.440]  get a new trial.
[26:41.440 --> 26:42.680]  This verdict is shocking.
[26:42.680 --> 26:46.080]  Well, and let's just call it what it is.
[26:46.080 --> 26:50.520]  They were mad that in discovery, they didn't get the evidence they wanted.
[26:50.520 --> 26:52.600]  That's what it is really about.
[26:52.600 --> 26:55.440]  They didn't get the evidence they wanted, even though they got everything.
[26:55.440 --> 26:57.960]  I mean, I sat for at least four or five depositions.
[26:57.960 --> 27:02.040]  I can't even remember, you know, dozens of hours.
[27:02.040 --> 27:03.040]  They were mad.
[27:03.040 --> 27:04.040]  They didn't get the evidence they wanted.
[27:04.040 --> 27:05.040]  They got all the discovery.
[27:05.040 --> 27:07.000]  They literally got everything we have.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.360]  And they were mad because what they wanted wasn't in there.
[27:11.360 --> 27:18.240]  But you talk about the billion-dollar judgment, I mean, the numbers, the only, I mean, the
[27:18.240 --> 27:24.520]  only numbers that they even gave the jury to give that decision were numbers of revenue
[27:24.520 --> 27:27.240]  brought in that weren't even accurate.
[27:27.240 --> 27:32.160]  It wasn't, it wasn't actually an accurate number of revenue or profits.
[27:32.160 --> 27:35.360]  They just throw this number out there and they say, this is how much Alex is worth.
[27:35.360 --> 27:37.480]  And then we can't even provide a counter argument.
[27:37.480 --> 27:41.880]  Well, that's what happened in Texas, even less happened in Connecticut.
[27:41.880 --> 27:46.320]  In Connecticut, they had a financial expert on their list of witnesses they chose not
[27:46.320 --> 27:47.320]  to call them.
[27:47.320 --> 27:53.400]  The only evidence about the revenue at the, at free speech came in the form of the following.
[27:53.400 --> 27:57.120]  Attorney Maddie said of the corporate, asked of the corporate representative, do you know
[27:57.120 --> 27:58.720]  how much, what, what the revenue was?
[27:58.720 --> 27:59.720]  I don't.
[27:59.720 --> 28:00.720]  Can you estimate it?
[28:00.720 --> 28:01.720]  I can't really speculate.
[28:01.720 --> 28:04.200]  Would you agree with me that it was at least over a given period?
[28:04.200 --> 28:06.960]  And I don't recall the years, at least a hundred, a hundred million.
[28:06.960 --> 28:08.760]  Yeah, I'd agree with that.
[28:08.760 --> 28:10.680]  Would you agree it could be as much as a billion?
[28:10.680 --> 28:12.280]  Yeah, I would agree with that.
[28:12.280 --> 28:14.640]  So basically that's all the jury had.
[28:14.640 --> 28:19.680]  But Owen, that's not even relevant to the task that was before this jury.
[28:19.680 --> 28:24.960]  In Texas, the jury had to set both compensatory and punitive damages.
[28:24.960 --> 28:29.920]  And the amount of money free speech made might be relevant in the punitive damages calculation.
[28:29.920 --> 28:33.960]  In Connecticut, the jury only decided compensatory damages.
[28:33.960 --> 28:36.160]  That number was simply irrelevant.
[28:36.160 --> 28:41.000]  The plaintiffs were entitled at that hearing in damages to all the damages they could prove.
[28:41.000 --> 28:45.560]  They, all the compensation they could prove would address their suffer.
[28:45.560 --> 28:49.160]  They offered no number to the jury, not one plaintiff.
[28:49.160 --> 28:51.160]  They did not make a claim for economic damages.
[28:51.160 --> 28:56.160]  It's a break here. Come back in the next segment and finish off that thought. We'll be right back.
[29:21.160 --> 29:25.160]  Humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[29:25.160 --> 29:29.760]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[29:29.760 --> 29:36.360]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com, it changes the world.

[30:56.360 --> 30:59.360]  It's a critical fight. Visit infowarsstore.com right now.
[30:59.360 --> 31:03.360]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[31:03.360 --> 31:10.360]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[31:10.360 --> 31:12.360]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[31:12.360 --> 31:15.360]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[31:15.360 --> 31:17.360]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next,
[31:17.360 --> 31:18.360]  or they're going to go for Steve Bannon,
[31:18.360 --> 31:20.360]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[31:20.360 --> 31:23.360]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on their 20 years,
[31:23.360 --> 31:25.360]  and I knew they were planning all of this,
[31:25.360 --> 31:27.360]  and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere,
[31:27.360 --> 31:29.360]  but I couldn't have done it without your support.
[31:29.360 --> 31:32.360]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet,
[31:32.360 --> 31:37.360]  not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[31:37.360 --> 31:41.360]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[31:41.360 --> 31:43.360]  because of your past support.
[31:43.360 --> 31:45.360]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now,
[31:45.360 --> 31:47.360]  to critical juncture of the battle,

[32:07.360 --> 32:13.360]  All three types of iodine that the body needs to be healthy and survive and thrive.
[32:13.360 --> 32:17.360]  It boosts your libido, your energy, your stamina, your immune system.
[32:17.360 --> 32:20.360]  X3 is the ultimate iodine product on the market.

[32:43.360 --> 32:45.360]  It takes about two weeks to kick in.
[32:45.360 --> 32:47.360]  An aspirin kicks in in 30 minutes,
[32:47.360 --> 32:49.360]  Tylenol kicks in in 30 minutes.
[32:49.360 --> 32:51.360]  This kicks in in about two weeks on average.
[32:51.360 --> 32:53.360]  You need to experience it.
[32:53.360 --> 32:55.360]  Don't wait.
[32:55.360 --> 32:57.360]  You'll be impressed, infowarsstore.com.
[32:57.360 --> 33:00.360]  X3.
[33:00.360 --> 33:04.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[33:04.360 --> 33:07.360]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:12.360 --> 33:14.360]  Big Brother.
[33:14.360 --> 33:16.360]  Mainstream media.
[33:16.360 --> 33:18.360]  Government cover-ups.
[33:18.360 --> 33:20.360]  You want to stop tyranny?
[33:20.360 --> 33:22.360]  Well, so does he.
[33:22.360 --> 33:25.360]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios,
[33:25.360 --> 33:32.360]  it's Alex Jones.
[33:32.360 --> 33:34.360]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[33:34.360 --> 33:37.360]  we have a major announcement
[33:37.360 --> 33:40.360]  that affects every American in our free speech.
[33:40.360 --> 33:42.360]  The ADL, the Southern Parliament Law Center,
[33:42.360 --> 33:44.360]  the Deep State is openly all over
[33:44.360 --> 33:47.360]  international television and U.S. television.
[33:47.360 --> 33:49.360]  And the newspaper is saying they're going to use
[33:49.360 --> 33:51.360]  the Alex Jones president to shut down all conservatives,
[33:51.360 --> 33:54.360]  to all populists in Kanye West next.
[33:54.360 --> 33:57.360]  The lawyer sued Kanye West for $200-plus million
[33:57.360 --> 33:59.360]  for simply talking about the coroner's report
[33:59.360 --> 34:01.360]  that they thought fentanyl probably killed him
[34:01.360 --> 34:04.360]  and that he didn't have any other injuries that would have killed him.
[34:04.360 --> 34:08.360]  That lawyer said, we're doing this off the Alex Jones precedent
[34:08.360 --> 34:12.360]  because the court jury just found in Connecticut
[34:12.360 --> 34:15.360]  that Alex Jones made money by telling lies.
[34:15.360 --> 34:19.360]  So that's how they have this new legal system.
[34:19.360 --> 34:21.360]  It's absolute garbage.
[34:21.360 --> 34:24.360]  And Norm Pass is one of the top constitutional lawyers in the country,
[34:24.360 --> 34:26.360]  but you know how good he is,
[34:26.360 --> 34:30.360]  the former top lawyer in the country hired him to represent him.
[34:30.360 --> 34:33.360]  famously Mr. Smith.
[34:33.360 --> 34:35.360]  So he's a top lawyer when he's telling you this,
[34:35.360 --> 34:38.360]  he's not just saying it because he's my lawyer and I'm his client.
[34:38.360 --> 34:40.360]  This is a rape of the First Amendment
[34:40.360 --> 34:44.360]  this country was founded on July 4, 1776.
[34:44.360 --> 34:46.360]  So our Declaration of Independence,
[34:46.360 --> 34:49.360]  our Bill of Rights that came later, is all under massive attack.
[34:49.360 --> 34:51.360]  We are filing for a new trial.
[34:51.360 --> 34:53.360]  This was not a real trial.
[34:53.360 --> 34:55.360]  It was a massive fraud.
[34:55.360 --> 34:57.360]  In the next few hours, he's going to file for the new trial.
[34:57.360 --> 34:59.360]  He's going to give you an exclusive right now
[34:59.360 --> 35:02.360]  on what they really did and read from the filing.
[35:02.360 --> 35:04.360]  So we filed in a matter of hours.
[35:04.360 --> 35:06.360]  This is major exclusive breaking news.
[35:06.360 --> 35:10.360]  I'm going to hand the baton back to our lawyer and to Norm Patis
[35:10.360 --> 35:12.360]  for this exclusive information.
[35:12.360 --> 35:15.360]  Norm Patis, please recap and then get into the exclusive information
[35:15.360 --> 35:18.360]  from the filing and why this is so incredible experience
[35:18.360 --> 35:19.360]  and what they really did.
[35:19.360 --> 35:22.360]  They said that I sent people to peel on children's graves.
[35:22.360 --> 35:24.360]  They had no witnesses. They never saw it.
[35:24.360 --> 35:26.360]  They have no proof I sent them.
[35:26.360 --> 35:28.360]  They have no proof I sent anyone anywhere.
[35:28.360 --> 35:30.360]  It's all a giant fraud.
[35:30.360 --> 35:34.360]  Norm Patis, I hand the baton to you and Owen Troyer.
[35:34.360 --> 35:36.360]  The trial was deeply distressing.
[35:36.360 --> 35:38.360]  There was a default on discovery grounds
[35:38.360 --> 35:42.360]  and then certain facts were deemed quote-unquote established
[35:42.360 --> 35:45.360]  and the plaintiffs were able to persuade the judge
[35:45.360 --> 35:48.360]  that you, meaning Alex Jones and free speech systems,
[35:48.360 --> 35:51.360]  were responsible for any harm that befell a plaintiff.
[35:51.360 --> 35:53.360]  And so when a witness testified,
[35:53.360 --> 35:56.360]  somebody called and said that someone peed on my grave,
[35:56.360 --> 35:58.360]  that became proof that Alex sent them.
[35:58.360 --> 36:02.360]  I have never seen a trial in which that was permitted,
[36:02.360 --> 36:04.360]  even in the context of a hearing in default.
[36:04.360 --> 36:06.360]  The law is clear.
[36:06.360 --> 36:09.360]  Plaintiffs are required to prove that the damages they seek
[36:09.360 --> 36:11.360]  are related to the liability they assert.
[36:11.360 --> 36:14.360]  The court abandoned its gatekeeping function
[36:14.360 --> 36:18.360]  to assure that competent evidence comes in only
[36:18.360 --> 36:20.360]  and the result was a slaughter.
[36:20.360 --> 36:22.360]  So let me read from the pleadings.
[36:22.360 --> 36:27.360]  The disciplinary default itself was outrageous.
[36:27.360 --> 36:31.360]  The court has to consider proportionality in the violation.
[36:31.360 --> 36:34.360]  In this case, infowars and Alex gave tens of thousands
[36:34.360 --> 36:37.360]  of documents, scores of hours of depositions,
[36:37.360 --> 36:39.360]  other pleadings and whatnot,
[36:39.360 --> 36:41.360]  and the plaintiffs were free to use them.
[36:41.360 --> 36:45.360]  But at trial, Alex and his team were unable to use
[36:45.360 --> 36:47.360]  those very items to defend him.
[36:47.360 --> 36:50.360]  So we write, the default in this case was disproportionate.
[36:50.360 --> 36:52.360]  The appropriate course would have been assuming,
[36:52.360 --> 36:54.360]  but for argument's sake, that the court's conclusion
[36:54.360 --> 36:57.360]  that the defendants failed substantially to comply
[36:57.360 --> 37:00.360]  with discovery would be to instruct the jury
[37:00.360 --> 37:03.360]  that in a trial involving damages,
[37:03.360 --> 37:05.360]  the jury was free to draw adverse inferences
[37:05.360 --> 37:07.360]  from failure to comply.
[37:07.360 --> 37:09.360]  That's a lot of gobbledygook.
[37:09.360 --> 37:11.360]  Let me read it to you simply.
[37:11.360 --> 37:13.360]  Entering a default where the defendants appeared,
[37:13.360 --> 37:16.360]  produced documents, attended depositions,
[37:16.360 --> 37:18.360]  answered requests to admit,
[37:18.360 --> 37:20.360]  and otherwise responded to requests for production,
[37:20.360 --> 37:23.360]  gave the plaintiffs a deadly advantage.
[37:23.360 --> 37:27.360]  They were able to use information provided by the defendant
[37:27.360 --> 37:30.360]  to argue for damages in a case where the defendants
[37:30.360 --> 37:32.360]  were deprived of any right to challenge the use
[37:32.360 --> 37:34.360]  to which the plaintiffs put that information.
[37:34.360 --> 37:39.360]  The result was the functional equivalent of execution
[37:39.360 --> 37:42.360]  by a Chinese firing squad with the defendants
[37:42.360 --> 37:45.360]  required to pay the cost of the bullets used to kill them.
[37:45.360 --> 37:47.360]  And you know, I chose my words carefully.
[37:47.360 --> 37:50.360]  I will appear in the highest courts of the land
[37:50.360 --> 37:52.360]  to defend these propositions.
[37:52.360 --> 37:55.360]  Again, Mr. Jones was held to have sent people
[37:55.360 --> 37:57.360]  to harass a plaintiff.
[37:57.360 --> 38:00.360]  There is, and I write in the pleading,
[38:00.360 --> 38:02.360]  in the weeks of testimony,
[38:02.360 --> 38:05.360]  that the plaintiffs did not prove by competent evidence
[38:05.360 --> 38:09.360]  that Mr. Jones ever sent anyone to harass a plaintiff
[38:09.360 --> 38:11.360]  or that anyone who listened to him
[38:11.360 --> 38:14.360]  heeded a call from him to harass a plaintiff.
[38:14.360 --> 38:16.360]  The jury was instructed, however,
[38:16.360 --> 38:18.360]  that liability had been established.
[38:18.360 --> 38:20.360]  A disciplinary default was transformed
[38:20.360 --> 38:23.360]  into a fatal impression that somewhere,
[38:23.360 --> 38:25.360]  someone had somehow proven
[38:25.360 --> 38:28.360]  that Mr. Jones did exactly what the plaintiffs alleged.
[38:28.360 --> 38:30.360]  There was no such proof.
[38:30.360 --> 38:33.360]  But the plaintiffs keeping the truth from the jury
[38:33.360 --> 38:37.360]  and permitting jurors to labor under the false impression
[38:37.360 --> 38:39.360]  that a finding had been made
[38:39.360 --> 38:41.360]  that Mr. Jones had in fact caused harm.
[38:41.360 --> 38:43.360]  Not one witness in the case
[38:43.360 --> 38:45.360]  appeared to testify that they harassed a plaintiff
[38:45.360 --> 38:47.360]  at the behest of Mr. Jones.
[38:47.360 --> 38:49.360]  Neither did Mr. Jones himself harass a plaintiff.
[38:49.360 --> 38:52.360]  Indeed, Mr. Jones only ever broadcast
[38:52.360 --> 38:55.360]  the name of one plaintiff, Robbie Parker.
[38:55.360 --> 38:58.360]  The closest thing the jury saw to harassing conduct
[38:58.360 --> 39:01.360]  was videos of Dan Badande, an info wars employee
[39:01.360 --> 39:04.360]  and Wolfgang Holby, a man who to this day denies
[39:04.360 --> 39:06.360]  that the Sandy Hook shootings took place,
[39:06.360 --> 39:09.360]  haranguing new town officials over their cover-up
[39:09.360 --> 39:11.360]  and participation in a hoax.
[39:11.360 --> 39:13.360]  No plaintiff was present at that event.
[39:13.360 --> 39:16.360]  And Norm, let me interject one little fact totem here
[39:16.360 --> 39:18.360]  because I think it's relevant.
[39:18.360 --> 39:20.360]  The individual whose name Jones mentioned
[39:20.360 --> 39:22.360]  did a TV press conference.
[39:22.360 --> 39:26.360]  So he goes on TV and puts his name and face out there
[39:26.360 --> 39:28.360]  and you're not allowed to say it.
[39:28.360 --> 39:31.360]  Well, it doesn't, you know, let's just leave that aside.
[39:31.360 --> 39:33.360]  I mean, Mr. Parker's name got used.
[39:33.360 --> 39:35.360]  Okay, fine, there were videos and, you know,
[39:35.360 --> 39:38.360]  could you all have done a better job of covering that?
[39:38.360 --> 39:41.360]  I think the jury could reasonably conclude you could have.
[39:41.360 --> 39:43.360]  But that's the only name that ever got mentioned.
[39:43.360 --> 39:45.360]  The only other testimony about an individual
[39:45.360 --> 39:48.360]  arguably connected to Jones harassing a plaintiff
[39:48.360 --> 39:50.360]  was a bottom-end named Mark Mills.
[39:50.360 --> 39:52.360]  Mark Mills appeared on the show in February one year
[39:52.360 --> 39:55.360]  after storming a Super Bowl press conference
[39:55.360 --> 39:57.360]  to claim that 9-11 was an inside job
[39:57.360 --> 39:59.360]  sponsored by the government.
[39:59.360 --> 40:02.360]  15 months later, he turned up at a Sandy Hook event.
[40:02.360 --> 40:05.360]  There's no evidence that he was sent there by Infowars,
[40:05.360 --> 40:07.360]  that he was ever on the Infowars payroll,
[40:07.360 --> 40:09.360]  and then it was suggested to the jury
[40:09.360 --> 40:11.360]  that he was arrested at that event, and he was.
[40:11.360 --> 40:13.360]  But when he pled guilty to an offense,
[40:13.360 --> 40:16.360]  he pled guilty to interfering with a police officer.
[40:16.360 --> 40:18.360]  So the jury was left with the impression
[40:18.360 --> 40:20.360]  that Mills was sent by Jones
[40:20.360 --> 40:23.360]  because it was established by the default.
[40:23.360 --> 40:26.360]  He wasn't. There was no evidence of that whatsoever.
[40:26.360 --> 40:29.360]  So at some point, and we write,
[40:29.360 --> 40:32.360]  given the law of default imposed by the court,
[40:32.360 --> 40:34.360]  these rules were unavailing.
[40:34.360 --> 40:36.360]  Everything was Mr. Jones' fault.
[40:36.360 --> 40:39.360]  The trial court wholly abandoned its responsibility
[40:39.360 --> 40:42.360]  to assure a fair trial and conducted
[40:42.360 --> 40:45.360]  according to the rules of evidence to take place.
[40:45.360 --> 40:48.360]  The trial was transformed into a memorial service.
[40:48.360 --> 40:51.360]  And I go on and on.
[40:51.360 --> 40:53.360]  So, I mean, we feel pretty strongly
[40:53.360 --> 40:57.360]  we've asserted 10 grounds for a new trial,
[40:57.360 --> 41:00.360]  including the plaintiff's counsel's treatment of Alex
[41:00.360 --> 41:03.360]  and its demeaning of him, its haranguing of him,
[41:03.360 --> 41:05.360]  its argumentative and wholly unprofessional
[41:05.360 --> 41:07.360]  cross-examination of him.
[41:07.360 --> 41:10.360]  And we are confident that if we're not given
[41:10.360 --> 41:13.360]  a new trial by the trial court, we will be by the appellate court.
[41:13.360 --> 41:16.360]  All right, Norm, do one more segment with me
[41:16.360 --> 41:18.360]  on the other side of this break
[41:18.360 --> 41:20.360]  if you can just bear with me for five minutes
[41:20.360 --> 41:23.360]  because I have two questions that I have for you on the other side.
[41:23.360 --> 41:26.360]  And then I kind of just want to get a general legal perspective
[41:26.360 --> 41:29.360]  from you on other developments.
[41:29.360 --> 41:31.360]  Well, be sure to ask me the extent to which this case
[41:31.360 --> 41:34.360]  can fairly be called a precedent for other cases,
[41:34.360 --> 41:37.360]  because it really can't. That's a hoax, okay?
[41:37.360 --> 41:39.360]  Okay, I will do that. I'm running that right now.
[41:39.360 --> 41:42.360]  So, we'll come back in five minutes and do that, folks.
[41:42.360 --> 41:45.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, listen, we plan on staying on air.
[41:45.360 --> 41:47.360]  That's our plan.
[41:47.360 --> 41:49.360]  And we're already operating in small margins.
[41:49.360 --> 41:51.360]  That's fine. You know, it's like,
[41:51.360 --> 41:53.360]  we don't have strategic oil reserves.
[41:53.360 --> 41:55.360]  We have our tank. That's it.
[41:55.360 --> 41:57.360]  That's when you shop at InfowarsStore.com.
[41:57.360 --> 41:59.360]  Now, we don't plan on going anywhere.
[41:59.360 --> 42:01.360]  You know, we don't need more money.
[42:01.360 --> 42:03.360]  The crew doesn't demand more money. I'm not demanding more money.
[42:03.360 --> 42:05.360]  Alex Jones doesn't care if he works for the next 20 years
[42:05.360 --> 42:07.360]  and doesn't have to get paid.
[42:07.360 --> 42:09.360]  But if you want Infowars to stay on air, folks,
[42:09.360 --> 42:13.360]  now is the time to shop at InfowarsStore.com,
[42:13.360 --> 42:15.360]  especially with Alex out of the office.
[42:15.360 --> 42:17.360]  I've explained this phenomenon before.
[42:17.360 --> 42:20.360]  When Alex is gone, the funding stops.
[42:20.360 --> 42:23.360]  People just don't go shop as much because they see Alex isn't on air
[42:23.360 --> 42:25.360]  and they just tune out so they don't hear the plugs
[42:25.360 --> 42:27.360]  when Alex is talking about his new book
[42:27.360 --> 42:29.360]  or the great supplements.
[42:29.360 --> 42:31.360]  We still have t-shirts available at InfowarsStore.com.
[42:31.360 --> 42:33.360]  So, folks, I'm telling you,
[42:33.360 --> 42:35.360]  if you appreciate the work that Alex has done,
[42:35.360 --> 42:37.360]  if you appreciate the work that Infowars have done,

[42:53.360 --> 42:55.360]  look, we've been proven right, our work here is done,
[42:55.360 --> 42:57.360]  but no, we're going to stay in the arena

[44:05.360 --> 44:07.360]  from their own admissions is now happening.
[44:07.360 --> 44:09.360]  Infowars' credibility.
[44:09.360 --> 44:11.360]  My credibility has never been higher
[44:11.360 --> 44:13.360]  and it's because of your backing of this operation
[44:13.360 --> 44:15.360]  that I could steadfastly,
[44:15.360 --> 44:17.360]  despite the censorship and the boycotts
[44:17.360 --> 44:19.360]  and the attacks and the lawsuits,
[44:19.360 --> 44:21.360]  stay on air.
[44:21.360 --> 44:23.360]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture
[44:23.360 --> 44:25.360]  in the fight together.
[44:25.360 --> 44:27.360]  So I want to ask all of you today
[44:27.360 --> 44:29.360]  to help keep me on the air.
[44:29.360 --> 44:31.360]  In my decades on air,
[44:31.360 --> 44:33.360]  I've never asked for personal donations,
[44:33.360 --> 44:35.360]  but I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court
[44:35.360 --> 44:37.360]  to pay for 40% of the legal fees
[44:37.360 --> 44:39.360]  and I can't fund those myself.
[44:39.360 --> 44:41.360]  It's unsustainable.

[45:30.520 --> 45:34.360]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations, but I'm being forced
[45:34.360 --> 45:39.960]  by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees and I can't fund those myself.
[45:39.960 --> 45:40.960]  It's unsustainable.
[45:40.960 --> 45:49.320]  So please, visit SaveInfoWars.com, SaveInfoWars.com where you can make straight donations, five,
[45:49.320 --> 45:53.520]  ten, fifty hundred dollars, whatever you can, so that I can continue to persevere.
[45:53.520 --> 45:56.480]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[45:56.480 --> 45:58.000]  Thank you for your support.
[45:58.000 --> 45:59.000]  Wouldn't be without you.
[45:59.000 --> 46:00.000]  SaveInfoWars.com.
[46:00.000 --> 46:06.320]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[46:06.320 --> 46:11.680]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[46:11.680 --> 46:15.520]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[46:15.520 --> 46:16.520]  to speak freely.
[46:16.520 --> 46:19.760]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[46:19.760 --> 46:21.200]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[46:21.200 --> 46:25.360]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[46:25.360 --> 46:29.680]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[46:29.680 --> 46:30.680]  your support.
[46:30.680 --> 46:33.760]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[46:33.760 --> 46:38.280]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[46:38.280 --> 46:41.920]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been
[46:41.920 --> 46:43.600]  because of your past support.
[46:43.600 --> 46:47.400]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[46:47.400 --> 46:52.120]  free double your efforts of visiting infowars.com and getting amazing products that keep us on
[46:52.120 --> 46:53.120]  air.
[46:53.120 --> 46:58.400]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is infowars.com, and I thank you all for your
[46:58.400 --> 47:01.200]  support.
[47:01.200 --> 47:19.600]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[47:19.600 --> 47:24.760]  My final segment with Norm Patis, folks, every InfoWars transmission from here on out is
[47:24.760 --> 47:27.000]  more important than the next.
[47:27.000 --> 47:32.600]  There's just, there's so much going on in our, in the soul of America, in the mind
[47:32.600 --> 47:33.600]  of America.
[47:33.600 --> 47:37.280]  I'm going to finish up with Norm Patis and try to get into the rest of it, but Norm,
[47:37.280 --> 47:43.240]  let's pick it up because we are seeing lawyers say, we're going to use the Alex Jones precedent,
[47:43.240 --> 47:46.000]  we're going to go after Kanye West, we're going to use the Alex Jones precedent, we're
[47:46.000 --> 47:47.760]  going to go after Fox News.
[47:47.760 --> 47:49.960]  You're saying there is no precedent here.
[47:49.960 --> 47:50.960]  Explain that.
[47:50.960 --> 47:51.960]  Yeah.
[47:51.960 --> 47:56.240]  So the claim, I think with respect to the Kanye case is that somehow they're going
[47:56.240 --> 47:58.520]  to make an intentional infliction of emotional distress.
[47:58.520 --> 48:04.280]  At the heart of Alex's case in part was this claim of so-called stochastic terrorism, terrorism
[48:04.280 --> 48:05.880]  by means of the internet.
[48:05.880 --> 48:10.120]  And that is if you have a broad social media platform and you say something that bothers
[48:10.120 --> 48:15.240]  somebody, you're responsible for what anyone else does when they hear that.
[48:15.240 --> 48:19.480]  And so in Alex's case, given the operation of the default, the complaint claimed that
[48:19.480 --> 48:23.440]  Alex said things he knew to be untrue, and Alex denies that, but the judge told him he
[48:23.440 --> 48:24.440]  couldn't say that.
[48:24.440 --> 48:28.280]  If Alex on the stand denied lying, he would have been held in contempt.
[48:28.280 --> 48:31.840]  If he admitted lying, he would have committed perjury.
[48:31.840 --> 48:35.280]  So he made the sensible decision, which was to boycott the proceeding.
[48:35.280 --> 48:41.080]  Because faced with that dilemma by the trial judge, had he testified and pled the fifth
[48:41.080 --> 48:44.600]  to protect himself from criminal jeopardy, they would have gotten an adverse inference
[48:44.600 --> 48:45.600]  against him.
[48:45.600 --> 48:46.600]  So it was a trilemma.
[48:46.600 --> 48:51.080]  But as to the presidential value of this case, what makes it a precedent or what makes
[48:51.080 --> 48:55.760]  it a non-precedent is the fact that all of this took place because of the default.
[48:55.760 --> 49:01.360]  The plaintiffs were never required to prove the fundamental assertion of this case.
[49:01.360 --> 49:05.040]  That is that others harassed the plaintiff, not Alex.
[49:05.040 --> 49:09.920]  That others harassed the plaintiffs because of what Alex said.
[49:09.920 --> 49:12.040]  And that's the danger to free speech.
[49:12.040 --> 49:17.500]  But that's the proposition that the default avoided they're having to test or being tested.
[49:17.500 --> 49:22.680]  So they were permitted to say, somebody threatened, I got a call, my life was threatened.
[49:22.680 --> 49:24.280]  They didn't have to say who said it.
[49:24.280 --> 49:25.280]  They didn't have to say when.
[49:25.280 --> 49:27.400]  They didn't have to corroborate it.
[49:27.400 --> 49:30.000]  They didn't even have to say the person said it to them.
[49:30.000 --> 49:34.400]  It could have been reported by a third party, them, which is classic hearsay.
[49:34.400 --> 49:37.760]  All of that was quote unquote, deemed established by the default.
[49:37.760 --> 49:43.000]  And there was never an evidentiary foundation required as to hearsay, as to foundation, as
[49:43.000 --> 49:44.640]  to connection to Alex.
[49:44.640 --> 49:47.800]  And this is all because of the default.
[49:47.800 --> 49:53.720]  So absent to default, these questions will have to be answered in cases involving Kanye
[49:53.720 --> 49:54.720]  and others.
[49:54.720 --> 50:01.320]  And for other lawyers to get all hot and bothered and say, hey, wow, this is good news for going
[50:01.320 --> 50:03.640]  to get to harass people we don't like.
[50:03.640 --> 50:08.120]  That's just, well, BS, I know this is family radio and television, so I won't say what
[50:08.120 --> 50:09.120]  it actually is.
[50:09.120 --> 50:10.120]  But it's BS.
[50:10.120 --> 50:13.400]  It's not going to happen unless a plaintiff gets defaulted.
[50:13.400 --> 50:16.200]  Now in Alex's case, there was a default.
[50:16.200 --> 50:21.160]  The plaintiffs were able to persuade the trial judge that you all operate like IBM.
[50:21.160 --> 50:24.060]  And therefore, everything the plaintiffs want, they should have gotten.
[50:24.060 --> 50:25.560]  They got a boatload.
[50:25.560 --> 50:28.720]  If they didn't get everything, they shouldn't have had the default, as I said at the top
[50:28.720 --> 50:29.720]  of the hour.
[50:29.720 --> 50:33.520]  They should have gotten an adverse inference and let the jury decide for themselves what
[50:33.520 --> 50:34.600]  the truth is.
[50:34.600 --> 50:40.840]  But instead of that, the default was operated to present half truths to the jury as a whole
[50:40.840 --> 50:41.840]  truth.
[50:41.840 --> 50:45.240]  The result was a fundamental miscarriage of justice.
[50:45.240 --> 50:49.920]  I can't help but wonder whether there are six jurors out there who now know that they
[50:49.920 --> 50:52.800]  weren't told the whole truth and whether they're upset.
[50:52.800 --> 51:00.440]  For example, when Alex got on the stand, here's the things the judge told me.
[51:00.440 --> 51:01.440]  Seems we have lost.
[51:01.440 --> 51:02.440]  Okay.
[51:02.440 --> 51:06.400]  Norm, you cut out for about the last 15 seconds.
[51:06.400 --> 51:12.200]  Just FY, but we got you back.
[51:12.200 --> 51:13.200]  Okay.
[51:13.200 --> 51:16.760]  So, you know, Alex was prohibited for testifying, the judge told him, that he couldn't mention
[51:16.760 --> 51:21.880]  that free speech systems was in bankruptcy, even though that to be true, the jury never
[51:21.880 --> 51:22.880]  did.
[51:22.880 --> 51:28.080]  That Sandy Hook was a minor part of the free speech's coverage over the 10 years at issue.
[51:28.080 --> 51:29.480]  The judge wouldn't permit that.
[51:29.480 --> 51:33.520]  But the defendant, excuse me, the plaintiffs were permitted to argue that there was massive
[51:33.520 --> 51:37.880]  coverage while covering hundreds of millions of people over a 10-year period.
[51:37.880 --> 51:40.360]  Alex couldn't mention the truth that books reflect.
[51:40.360 --> 51:44.760]  That is that Sandy Hook did not yield a profit to free speech systems.
[51:44.760 --> 51:48.200]  Sure, there were days where money was made and Sandy Hook was discussed, but there was
[51:48.200 --> 51:50.000]  no correlation between it.
[51:50.000 --> 51:54.740]  He could not testify that he believed he had substantially complied with discovery.
[51:54.740 --> 51:58.680]  He could not testify about his belief that the opinions he expressed were protected by
[51:58.680 --> 51:59.840]  the First Amendment.
[51:59.840 --> 52:04.360]  He could not deny that he lied because the court concluded that he had, as a result of
[52:04.360 --> 52:07.280]  a discovery default, out even hearing his testimony.
[52:07.280 --> 52:15.000]  So, I mean, the number of ways in which this default was transformed into a machine used
[52:15.000 --> 52:20.280]  to present a straw man to the jury, a straw man that the plaintiffs could then argue should
[52:20.280 --> 52:23.240]  pay a million dollars is shocking to me.
[52:23.240 --> 52:28.800]  And if an appellate court lets it stand, that will reflect fundamentally poorly on the
[52:28.800 --> 52:31.040]  American civil justice system.
[52:31.040 --> 52:35.280]  So we're filing this new trial petition probably within the next hour or two.
[52:35.280 --> 52:39.360]  I've got to do some final edits on it and get off here with you to do those.
[52:39.360 --> 52:44.080]  And then we'll be also filing a motion to remit or reduce the damages.
[52:44.080 --> 52:49.560]  Our claim is the plaintiffs had the responsibility to put evidence from which the jury could
[52:49.560 --> 52:53.960]  do more than speculate in arriving at a sum of damages.
[52:53.960 --> 52:55.080]  They never offered a sum.
[52:55.080 --> 52:56.800]  They never offered a bill.
[52:56.800 --> 52:58.200]  They never asked for anything.
[52:58.200 --> 53:01.800]  It was their lawyers who asked for billions and they got a billion.
[53:01.800 --> 53:04.240]  So we remain optimistic.
[53:04.240 --> 53:06.200]  We remain in the fight.
[53:06.200 --> 53:10.520]  I'm very determined to see this one through the end and to a successful outcome.
[53:10.520 --> 53:13.560]  One more question on that case quickly.
[53:13.560 --> 53:17.840]  We have the sound bite of the plaintiff's lawyer, Chris Maddy, after the case concluded
[53:17.840 --> 53:23.280]  saying to Infowars, Alex Jones, audience members, don't go shop at the website.
[53:23.280 --> 53:28.400]  How is that not malpractice when those funds would be going to pay these bills?
[53:28.400 --> 53:36.360]  Well, I think the purpose of this lawsuit was never to, was never to, well, I mean,
[53:36.360 --> 53:37.360]  the purpose of this lawsuit-
[53:37.360 --> 53:38.360]  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not.
[53:38.360 --> 53:39.360]  We understand the purpose-
[53:39.360 --> 53:40.360]  We've got to shut you guys down.
[53:40.360 --> 53:41.360]  Sure, sure.
[53:41.360 --> 53:42.360]  The purpose was to shut us down.
[53:42.360 --> 53:46.560]  But how can the lawyer go out and say, hey, don't pay the bills that the court just awarded
[53:46.560 --> 53:47.560]  the plaintiffs?
[53:47.560 --> 53:54.960]  You know, I think, I don't know, I mean, Chris Maddy had his reasons for saying what
[53:54.960 --> 53:55.960]  he said.
[53:55.960 --> 53:56.960]  I've not spoken too about it.
[53:56.960 --> 53:57.960]  I've not even seen the clip.
[53:57.960 --> 54:03.560]  Well, it's just funny because I had lawyers in a deposition I was given tell me that I
[54:03.560 --> 54:07.080]  should sue a previous lawyer for malpractice for something similar.
[54:07.080 --> 54:12.040]  And so it's funny, but we know how that goes, but we can just drop it right there.
[54:12.040 --> 54:15.240]  You know, here's what's funny about this, and you can comment on this, or I just want
[54:15.240 --> 54:17.240]  to ask you one more question before we let you go.
[54:17.240 --> 54:22.800]  And Norm, you've seen this, I feel in this entire thing, we are the ones that have been
[54:22.800 --> 54:23.800]  defamed.
[54:23.800 --> 54:25.320]  I'm the one that has hate mail sent to me.
[54:25.320 --> 54:29.120]  I'm the one that now gets lied about things that I've never said, things that I've never
[54:29.120 --> 54:30.120]  done.
[54:30.120 --> 54:31.960]  I get death threats sent to me all the time.
[54:31.960 --> 54:32.960]  Norm, you've seen them.
[54:32.960 --> 54:33.960]  I've sent them to you.
[54:33.960 --> 54:34.960]  We presented them to the court.
[54:34.960 --> 54:36.040]  They don't seem to care.
[54:36.040 --> 54:39.840]  So I feel that we're the ones that have been defamed here, but you don't need to comment
[54:39.840 --> 54:40.840]  on that.
[54:40.840 --> 54:41.840]  That's just me putting my two cents.
[54:41.840 --> 54:43.080]  Here's my final question for you, though.
[54:43.080 --> 54:48.040]  Come back to the Texas case, the way this worked out, and I've asked other lawyers and
[54:48.040 --> 54:49.040]  they don't have an answer.
[54:49.040 --> 54:50.040]  So maybe you do.
[54:50.040 --> 54:53.440]  The way this worked out is that the judge went to the jury and said, everybody give
[54:53.440 --> 54:58.480]  me a number about how much Alex Jones owes, and they each went out and, okay, I had 13,
[54:58.480 --> 55:00.720]  4, 5 million, whatever.
[55:00.720 --> 55:05.120]  And then she added it up and said, this is the total number, it was 55 million or whatever.
[55:05.120 --> 55:07.280]  So is that how this normally goes?
[55:07.280 --> 55:13.160]  So you're saying, let's say 10 jury members, nine of them say zero dollars, and then one
[55:13.160 --> 55:16.720]  of them says a billion, and then you get a billion-dollar judgment?
[55:16.720 --> 55:17.840]  That's how it went in Texas.
[55:17.840 --> 55:18.840]  Is that normal?
[55:18.840 --> 55:20.720]  Well, I don't know how it went in Texas.
[55:20.720 --> 55:25.960]  I'd be stunned if the judge had any interaction with the jury that was not on the record.
[55:25.960 --> 55:27.520]  I just don't think that happened.
[55:27.520 --> 55:30.840]  But I think that in Connecticut, there were six jurors, and they had to agree unanimously
[55:30.840 --> 55:31.840]  on a sum.
[55:31.840 --> 55:37.160]  And however they arrived at that sum is however they arrived at it, but they all had to agree
[55:37.160 --> 55:38.840]  on the particular number.
[55:38.840 --> 55:43.800]  So in the Connecticut case, there were actually 30 numbers they had to agree to, 15 plaintiffs,
[55:43.800 --> 55:48.000]  one line for reputation, harm to reputation, another line for emotional distress.
[55:48.000 --> 55:53.040]  So they reached 30 unanimous agreements by some mysterious and opaque process that I
[55:53.040 --> 55:55.680]  can't relate to the evidence in this case.
[55:55.680 --> 56:00.240]  And that's a problem for Alex, it's a problem for every American, because when you walk
[56:00.240 --> 56:05.280]  into court, you're entitled to due process of law, and if you've erred, you should pay.
[56:05.280 --> 56:07.760]  But you shouldn't pay more than the error is worth.
[56:07.760 --> 56:11.560]  And it's up to the plaintiff, the moving party, to show what that error is worth.
[56:11.560 --> 56:14.640]  And when they produce no evidence, they're entitled to no money.
[56:14.640 --> 56:15.720]  So this is amazing, Norm.
[56:15.720 --> 56:19.760]  You're now the fifth lawyer I've asked this question, and nobody can even seem to wrap
[56:19.760 --> 56:24.560]  their minds around it, when 10 jurors all give a different number, and then the judge
[56:24.560 --> 56:26.920]  just adds that up and says, this is the total number.
[56:26.920 --> 56:28.240]  Again, that's what happened in the Texas case.
[56:28.240 --> 56:29.760]  I know you weren't in that courtroom.
[56:29.760 --> 56:32.080]  I've just never even heard of that in any case.
[56:32.080 --> 56:35.360]  I'm not sure she, is that what she did?
[56:35.360 --> 56:36.360]  Yes.
[56:36.360 --> 56:37.360]  Is it?
[56:37.360 --> 56:38.360]  Wow.
[56:38.360 --> 56:39.360]  Yeah.
[56:39.360 --> 56:40.360]  That's insane.
[56:40.360 --> 56:43.600]  I've never, every lawyer I've talked to has said, I've never heard of such a thing
[56:43.600 --> 56:44.600]  in my life.
[56:44.600 --> 56:50.400]  No, I mean, I'd have, you know, I love you, I trust you, but I just doubt that.
[56:50.400 --> 56:52.400]  That just cannot be how it happened.
[56:52.400 --> 56:54.640]  I believe the jury had to come up with that number.
[56:54.640 --> 56:56.360]  I don't think the judge computed it.
[56:56.360 --> 56:59.040]  No, she's talking to Andino right now.
[56:59.040 --> 57:01.480]  She added all the different jurors' numbers.
[57:01.480 --> 57:02.760]  Each juror wrote down a number.
[57:02.760 --> 57:06.000]  She added them all up and said, this is the final number Jones has to pay.
[57:06.000 --> 57:09.480]  Well, then there's, that's another grounds for appeal.
[57:09.480 --> 57:10.480]  So well, there you go.
[57:10.480 --> 57:11.480]  All right.
[57:11.480 --> 57:12.480]  Norm Patis, you got to follow that report.
[57:12.480 --> 57:13.480]  Thank you so much for that update.
[57:13.480 --> 57:14.480]  I do.
[57:14.480 --> 57:15.760]  God bless and God speed, brother.
[57:15.760 --> 57:18.680]  We'll be in touch.
[57:18.680 --> 57:23.560]  And of course, Norm and I will be back in court next week.
[57:23.560 --> 57:27.160]  I'm in court twice next week.
[57:27.160 --> 57:33.280]  I'm in court two times next week because I stood outside the Capitol in D.C. and because
[57:33.280 --> 57:38.400]  I did a 30-second disruption of Jerry Nadler's false impeachment hearing in 2019 and they're
[57:38.400 --> 57:41.680]  still trying to put me in jail for months for that.
[57:41.680 --> 57:43.560]  So I'll be in court with Norm next week.
[57:43.560 --> 57:49.960]  It's nice being politically persecuted by these scum bags, by these dirt bags.
[57:49.960 --> 57:50.960]  It's our best seller.
[57:50.960 --> 57:56.440]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller, but as folks tried
[57:56.440 --> 58:01.000]  vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made
[58:01.000 --> 58:04.120]  them, it has become our number one overall best seller.

[58:07.480 --> 58:12.920]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[58:12.920 --> 58:13.920]  function of the body.

[58:18.720 --> 58:21.280]  need to live and be healthy.
[58:21.280 --> 58:23.560]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[58:23.560 --> 58:25.320]  And so much of the food is debased.
[58:25.320 --> 58:30.400]  There's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body defenses
[58:30.400 --> 58:31.400]  with a product like this.
[58:31.400 --> 58:35.080]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the

[59:57.280 --> 1:00:11.360]  Oh boy, it's a lot more peaceful to listen to that.
[1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:19.560]  That'll calm your blood pressure, that'll lower the tension, but I can't spend time
[1:00:19.560 --> 1:00:23.280]  listening to country music right now, we got too much news to cover.
[1:00:23.280 --> 1:00:33.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we go back in time, we go 12 years back in time to a classic Alex
[1:00:33.080 --> 1:00:39.160]  Jones clip warning you, now you've seen them, the carbon lockdowns are coming.
[1:00:39.160 --> 1:00:44.600]  Just on rec, and I had Martin Moreno on yesterday reading the quotes out of the New York Times,
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:49.240]  said yes, we want to shut the economy down, we want to reduce the economy to have a lower
[1:00:49.240 --> 1:00:54.280]  carbon footprint, now they want to shut off the economy to bankrupt you and force you
[1:00:54.280 --> 1:00:58.320]  onto government subsidy so they control you, it's called serfdom.
[1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:05.720]  But Boehner has come out in business and media newspaper and said Obama and Congress intentionally
[1:01:05.720 --> 1:01:13.160]  spending to force value-added tax, and there's also a New Hampshire Senator, Judd Gregg, is
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:17.920]  also saying the same thing, that they want to bankrupt the economy to force a total takeover
[1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:23.720]  of society, so we're actually getting honesty now.
[1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:30.120]  So you know what's amazing and it's just so obvious to you, it's so obvious to me, it's
[1:01:30.120 --> 1:01:36.280]  so obvious to anybody that can think and has any foresight whatsoever, what the stop manmade
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:39.040]  climate change agenda is really about.
[1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:44.680]  It's right there in the first word, stop man, man, that's what it's really about.
[1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:47.880]  What do you think happens when they shut off the energy?
[1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:50.360]  What do you think happens when they shut down the infrastructure?
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:57.480]  You die, I mean, you go poor, you starve, you die, how do you not see that?
[1:01:57.480 --> 1:01:59.000]  That's the point.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:03.240]  And so this is the great reset, it's hit the reset button on the world, they don't care
[1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:06.280]  about the infrastructure, they don't care about the people, they would much rather what it's
[1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:09.940]  like 8 billion people on the earth, they would much rather have 8 billion people die, whatever
[1:02:09.940 --> 1:02:14.400]  happens the infrastructure happens, they'll rebuild what they want, what they don't want,
[1:02:14.400 --> 1:02:17.840]  they'll have robots doing it all, led by AI.
[1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:21.760]  This is the new technotronic age that the globalists believe that they're about to launch,
[1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:27.600]  and you won't be here, you will be dead, because you're the man in manmade climate change that
[1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:34.040]  they want to end, and they tell you this, and people still don't get it.
[1:02:34.040 --> 1:02:38.880]  But you know what, people do get it, this audience gets it, and the problem is this
[1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:44.920]  audience needs to be 500 times as big as it is, but that's why they have us censored,
[1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:49.360]  that's why they try to shut us down, because they know, not that infowars is perfect, not
[1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:55.880]  that we're always right, but we see, we have the foresight, we have the prophecy, we can
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:03:01.600]  see the future, I don't know why you can too, I don't know why others can't, that's why
[1:03:01.600 --> 1:03:06.840]  they have to have us shut down, because people know they get this information, they connect
[1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:12.080]  the dots, they see the future, and then they can spread that information onward, and so
[1:03:12.080 --> 1:03:16.040]  that's why we have to be shut down, and that's why you see the lawsuits, same thing with
[1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:20.160]  Steve Bannon, Steve Bannon gets the vision, Steve Bannon sees the future, so what did
[1:03:20.160 --> 1:03:29.480]  they do to Steve Bannon today? Four months in jail for contempt of a sham committee.
[1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:36.200]  How much worse is it going to get in this country? Folks, you need to be praying and
[1:03:36.200 --> 1:03:42.760]  begging to God, whether you believe in God or not, I mean, there's no atheists in the
[1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:49.760]  trenches, as they say, there's no atheists in the foxhole, there's a reason, because
[1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:53.680]  when you're up against that dire moment, when you're up against that, your back is against
[1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:59.000]  that wall of life or death, something inside of you begs, something inside of you reaches
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:04.960]  out for higher power to save you, and if you don't have that feeling right now, with where
[1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:12.320]  this country is going, then you've been completely fluoridated out of any true human emotion,
[1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:17.400]  you've been completely brainwashed and dumbed down into seeing that you are being treated
[1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:25.320]  as a slave and marked for death. And whether you believe in the Bible or not, they're trying
[1:04:25.320 --> 1:04:29.600]  to fulfill the biblical prophecy, whether you believe in God or not, if you don't have
[1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:34.400]  that urge, if you don't have that sense of urgency, that sense of desperation to beg
[1:04:34.400 --> 1:04:39.760]  God, to beg a higher power, to beg maybe something you don't fully understand or believe in for
[1:04:39.760 --> 1:04:44.840]  some relief. But I got to tell you, from where I'm standing right here, I think we are in
[1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:51.280]  for two more years of absolute hell under the Joe Biden administration. We need a miracle
[1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:58.560]  in the midterms in 18 days. If Republicans don't take Congress, folks, batten down the
[1:04:58.560 --> 1:04:59.560]  hatches.
[1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:06.640]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy. I am blessed
[1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:12.880]  to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed
[1:05:12.880 --> 1:05:18.720]  with silencing us. They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's
[1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:24.720]  came over. And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:30.160]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech. That's why when
[1:05:30.160 --> 1:05:35.600]  you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswords.com, it changes
[1:05:35.600 --> 1:05:40.040]  the world. And that's why when you go to infowarstore.com and get amazing products that
[1:05:40.040 --> 1:05:45.280]  empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also
[1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:49.720]  empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist. The fight starts at
[1:05:49.720 --> 1:05:55.520]  infowars.com and the support of the fight starts at infowarstore.com. God bless and thank
[1:05:55.520 --> 1:06:18.120]  you all for your support.
[1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:28.760]  I'm just so overwhelmed and emotional right now. I need to cover this news. Nobody else
[1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:34.760]  covers the news like we do here. I've got Mike Adams coming up. I've got more flashbacks
[1:06:34.760 --> 1:06:44.680]  from Alex Jones predicting the future. So let me just try to put the blinders on emotionally,
[1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:51.360]  politically and just bear down and cover this news as much as I can bear here for our guest.
[1:06:51.360 --> 1:06:56.040]  So again, Steve Bannon sentenced to four months in jail for contempt of the January 6th committee.
[1:06:56.040 --> 1:07:00.800]  Total sham, total BS, total political persecution. January 6th political prisoner, Pete Schwartz
[1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:04.480]  called Gateway Pundit from his prison block. You won't believe how corrupt the DOJ is screwing
[1:07:04.480 --> 1:07:10.280]  with this man. Yeah, the story of what the FBI did to him and his wife is unbelievable.
[1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:19.400]  I'm just, folks, I just, I mean, you're now, this is the most corrupt America's ever been.
[1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:24.960]  No doubt America's probably been through harder times, I would say. The Great Depression,
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:29.640]  World War I, World War II, maybe there's, you know, America's been through tougher times
[1:07:29.640 --> 1:07:36.560]  than this, but we've never had corruption like this. And we are really yet to see the
[1:07:36.560 --> 1:07:41.160]  fruits of what this corruption is breeding. And it's all really coming out of the Democrat
[1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:48.360]  Party at this point and the Biden administration and the clown world being run by the globalists.
[1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:55.400]  But man, it's like, I just, like, that's the big story. It's like warning, warning, warning,
[1:07:55.400 --> 1:08:00.080]  sound the alarm, sound the alarm, ring the alarm bell. I can put up like the lighthouse,
[1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:04.280]  scream at the top of the mountain. This is the most corrupt America's ever been. You're
[1:08:04.280 --> 1:08:09.340]  screwed if we don't do something about it. If Democrats get Congress, we're done. It's
[1:08:09.340 --> 1:08:15.600]  over two years of hell guaranteed. Forget about an election in 2024, folks. I'm telling you,
[1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:21.080]  the country will collapse. That'll be, will beg for the country to collapse at that point.
[1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:28.480]  And that's what the globalists want. Biden gets lost on stage, speaks complete gibberish.
[1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:31.880]  Here, you want to hear that? Here, you guys want to hear from the president, Joe Biden?
[1:08:31.880 --> 1:08:35.560]  See if you guys can make any sense of Joe Biden here in clip eight.
[1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:40.880]  Tim Ryan in Ohio said he doesn't want you there. Warnock said, wouldn't say. Do you
[1:08:40.880 --> 1:08:44.480]  think they're making a mistake? No, they're by 16 or I've already gone in four yet and
[1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:50.480]  a lot more are asked. Another 20 or so. I'm going to be doing it. Okay. There's your president.
[1:08:50.480 --> 1:08:57.520]  Can't even talk. Can't even talk. You liberals, you Democrats. Why do you lie to yourselves
[1:08:57.520 --> 1:09:01.520]  like this? Do you have a death wish? Are you suicidal? Actually, the answer is yes. I got
[1:09:01.520 --> 1:09:05.840]  liberal activists talking about their suicidal today. I'll cover that later. I mean, should
[1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:11.280]  I cover it right now? Big, big, big liberal activists talking about how she's suicidal
[1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:15.960]  and how one, one fourth of LGBTQ activists are suicidal and they, and they, and they,
[1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:20.480]  and they blame Republicans for it. I'm not even kidding you. It's all right here. Olivia
[1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:25.000]  Giuliana, you probably heard her one in four LGBTQ teams attempt suicide in the beginning
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:31.280]  of last year. And then she says this is what anti LGBTQ legislation does. She says she's,
[1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:38.920]  she's thought about suicide herself. You have a mental problem. You stop blaming others
[1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:43.960]  for your mental problems. Stop blaming the rest of the country for your problems. Stop
[1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:50.600]  trying to make the world and the country in your image. You're suicidal. You've got mental
[1:09:50.600 --> 1:10:01.120]  problems. That's your problem. That's your issue. Not ours. And then the CDC says one
[1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:07.440]  in four LGBTQ teams attempt suicide. And so now we have to rewrite laws and we have to
[1:10:07.440 --> 1:10:11.800]  rewrite the school system and rewrite television and media so that we can make sure that the
[1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:25.920]  little snowflakes don't kill themselves. All right, let me get back to the news. I'm just
[1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:30.880]  a disaster today. I should just open up the phone lines. Biden could refill this. So this
[1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:35.600]  is, I want to go back in time to just show you what a joke Joe Biden is. So Biden begs
[1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:41.640]  OPEC to pump more oil. They don't do it. So he drains our strategic oral reserves. Now
[1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:47.080]  just a few years ago when oil was down, when Trump was in office, Republicans tried to
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:57.920]  spend $3 billion to resupply and overload the strategic oral reserves when oil was at $24
[1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:04.360]  a barrel. That didn't happen because Democrats voted against it. So Republicans tried to increase
[1:11:04.360 --> 1:11:12.560]  the petroleum emergency reserve by purchasing $3 billion worth at $24 a barrel. Now it's
[1:11:12.560 --> 1:11:19.840]  like $100 a barrel. And Joe Biden is so stupid, he drains our oil reserves again, then he
[1:11:19.840 --> 1:11:23.200]  announces to the public, because he's asked, well, what are you going to do? You've drained
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:29.520]  the strategic oral reserves. He says, when oil hits $80 a barrel again, I'll replenish
[1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:36.000]  the oil reserves. Wow. So you rejected it when we were going to buy it at $24 a barrel.
[1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.960]  Then you go out and tell the rest of the world you're going to buy it $80 a barrel so that
[1:11:39.960 --> 1:11:44.840]  Russia and China and the rest of the world, when it hits $80 a barrel, they're going
[1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:54.560]  to buy it all up. Unbelievable. And by the way, it's not coming down to $80 a barrel
[1:11:54.560 --> 1:12:01.560]  anytime soon. Remember, they said Elon Musk could solve world hunger with $6 billion.
[1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:11.160]  The Democrats have sent $100 billion to Ukraine. We got stabbed in the back by Amy Coney Barrett
[1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:16.560]  again. Judge dismisses attempt by Missouri judge and other states to block Biden's student
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:21.400]  debt forgiveness program. Amy Coney Barrett, Missouri federal judge, rejects challenge
[1:12:21.400 --> 1:12:25.800]  to Biden's student relief debt relief. So, oh, by the way, nobody's got it yet. This
[1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:29.920]  is them just trying to buy votes out of the midterms. Nobody's got any student debt relief.
[1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:33.600]  There's Democrats buying votes. It's like what they're doing with draining the strategic
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:37.680]  oil reserves, just trying to buy votes. That's an emergency for the country, not when your
[1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:43.960]  poll numbers are shrinking. And so they're just going to take your tax dollars, raise
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:48.040]  your taxes, and give it to people that don't want to pay their loans. It's unbelievable.
[1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:56.040]  Just completely unbelievable is what it is. So now you have Laura Logan. Newsmax cuts ties
[1:12:56.040 --> 1:13:00.600]  with Laura Logan after she said world leaders dine on the blood of children. They do and
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:06.120]  their souls actually. Newsmax bans Laura Logan after she goes full QAnon. That's what the
[1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:10.480]  Daily Beast says. Well, here, you can listen to it for yourself in clip 10. Here's what
[1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:16.480]  got Laura Logan banned from Newsmax. You know what? It's even bigger than that because
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:21.640]  I, you know, I spoke to a man who was actually holding the documents in his hand. He told
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:28.880]  me about it, right? He said he infiltrated the global cabal at the UN level, right? And
[1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:35.640]  one of the things that he was able to tell me about from his own personal experience
[1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:42.400]  when he witnessed himself was these documents that show that the plan, there is a plan.
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:47.320]  And this was several years ago, right? The plan was to infiltrate 100 million illegal
[1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:52.960]  immigrants. And at that point, they were already at 40 million. And these people would dilute
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:57.480]  what they called the pool of patriots. Those were their words, right? And they would not
[1:13:57.480 --> 1:14:01.880]  be taught that America is a great country and trained to sing the national anthem with
[1:14:01.880 --> 1:14:06.600]  pride and so on and so on. They would be taught all the negative things that were taught about
[1:14:06.600 --> 1:14:10.920]  the U.S. city that our own children are taught. And what would be the effects of diluting the
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:16.960]  pool of patriots? Well, it would be to break down this sense of pride in being American
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:24.000]  and what it means to be American. So that's actually a different clip, but it's the same
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:28.440]  segment. I've got the other clip. I'll play it on the other side. But everything she said
[1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:34.760]  there is accurate. And I've got proof of that with this interview of Berkeley students.
[1:14:34.760 --> 1:14:40.200]  Listen, everything Laura Logan just said is proven correct in this short clip of Berkeley.
[1:14:40.200 --> 1:14:44.280]  You see Berkeley students being interviewed in clip four. Do you love America? The part
[1:14:44.280 --> 1:14:48.480]  of America that I really enjoy like the Black Lives Matter protests and stuff like that.
[1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:53.600]  What I don't enjoy is like the homophobia and the racism and just like the rich eating
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:57.760]  the poor and like just making it so difficult to live here. How do you think we can combat
[1:14:57.760 --> 1:15:01.080]  against those issues? It just really starts with like the older generation as well. They
[1:15:01.080 --> 1:15:09.000]  also have to try to like change their mindset because their mindset is also affecting us.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:14.840]  News and universities are putting out the dumbest people you've ever seen in your life. And
[1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:18.520]  that's what they really believe. They really think America is a bad place. They really
[1:15:18.520 --> 1:15:21.400]  think America is racist. They really think the rich are to blame for all their problems.
[1:15:21.400 --> 1:15:30.080]  Who do you think is going to give you a job, you idiot? I don't know if I can do the news.
[1:15:30.080 --> 1:15:32.960]  I really don't. I may just have to open up the phone lines. Maybe we'll play the Laura
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:36.880]  Logan clip. I mean, I got huge news here. I mean, I should be covering the news, new
[1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:45.160]  vaccine news right after they, they, the CDC voted to make the COVID-19 vaccines mandatory
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:54.880]  for children. Pfizer hiked the vaccine price to $130 per dose. We are just getting raped
[1:15:54.880 --> 1:16:18.120]  by these warmongers.
[1:16:18.120 --> 1:16:30.080]  So here we go again with izzydr. A two-hour flu.
[1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:32.140]  Weこんな
[1:16:32.140 --> 1:16:34.540]  and so much of the food is debased.
[1:16:34.540 --> 1:16:36.340]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[1:16:36.340 --> 1:16:39.360]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses

[1:19:01.380 --> 1:19:03.820]  It's not hype that your support of InfoWars
[1:19:03.820 --> 1:19:05.940]  is the reason we were able to do this.
[1:19:05.940 --> 1:19:07.620]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[1:19:07.620 --> 1:19:10.340]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen
[1:19:10.340 --> 1:19:11.500]  on the periodic table.
[1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:13.940]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen
[1:19:13.940 --> 1:19:15.420]  and does the opposite of fluoride.
[1:19:15.420 --> 1:19:16.580]  And when you've got it in your body,
[1:19:16.580 --> 1:19:18.260]  it doesn't just supercharge yourselves,
[1:19:18.260 --> 1:19:19.220]  it doesn't just give you more energy,
[1:19:19.220 --> 1:19:20.780]  it doesn't just boost your immune system,
[1:19:20.780 --> 1:19:23.420]  but it also blocks the bad halogens
[1:19:23.420 --> 1:19:26.940]  in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[1:19:26.940 --> 1:19:28.020]  So ladies and gentlemen,
[1:19:28.020 --> 1:19:31.380]  it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average.

[1:19:59.060 --> 1:20:01.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:20:01.860 --> 1:20:05.460]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:09.220 --> 1:20:12.020]  It's called the great reset, tough guy.
[1:20:13.020 --> 1:20:14.140]  It's called the New World Order.
[1:20:14.140 --> 1:20:16.980]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy
[1:20:16.980 --> 1:20:20.220]  and make people poor so they can loan us fiat money
[1:20:20.220 --> 1:20:21.660]  and take control of our lives
[1:20:21.660 --> 1:20:24.260]  with a social credit score and a universal basic income.
[1:20:24.260 --> 1:20:25.580]  That's everything.
[1:20:25.580 --> 1:20:27.700]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[1:20:27.700 --> 1:20:30.860]  The whole world's gonna be about surveillance and control
[1:20:30.860 --> 1:20:33.020]  and them manipulating and tracking everything you do.
[1:20:33.020 --> 1:20:34.780]  It's all being officially announced.
[1:20:34.780 --> 1:20:35.940]  I've got articles everywhere.
[1:20:35.940 --> 1:20:38.260]  They're press releases saying it.
[1:20:41.620 --> 1:20:43.460]  And then the crew asks me during the break, they go,
[1:20:43.460 --> 1:20:44.540]  are you all right, are you all right?
[1:20:44.540 --> 1:20:45.980]  You really seem upset here.
[1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:47.460]  Are you feeling okay?
[1:20:47.460 --> 1:20:48.700]  Well then, about to have this war.
[1:20:48.700 --> 1:20:50.460]  I mean, they're gonna start with a couple hundred million
[1:20:50.460 --> 1:20:52.620]  people that's young, I'm pretty freaked out.
[1:20:52.620 --> 1:20:53.820]  This is real.
[1:20:53.820 --> 1:20:57.620]  This is not, this is not a freaking game to me, man.
[1:20:59.420 --> 1:21:01.380]  You understand, like I love to do, right?
[1:21:01.380 --> 1:21:02.860]  I love to kill them and die.
[1:21:05.220 --> 1:21:06.700]  People are starving then,
[1:21:06.700 --> 1:21:08.700]  like hundreds of millions right now.
[1:21:08.700 --> 1:21:10.060]  You never see it on news.
[1:21:10.060 --> 1:21:11.340]  They're dying right now.
[1:21:11.340 --> 1:21:13.700]  They're in their freaking houses starving
[1:21:13.700 --> 1:21:15.500]  and begging for God to help them.
[1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:18.620]  And no one's coming because God tells us to get up
[1:21:18.620 --> 1:21:21.700]  and take action, and then we don't do anything.
[1:21:22.700 --> 1:21:24.220]  And that paralyzes God.
[1:21:26.420 --> 1:21:29.700]  Yeah, God can do it, but God needs us to do it
[1:21:29.700 --> 1:21:31.740]  because God's not free will.
[1:21:31.740 --> 1:21:33.300]  Once again, not for the first time
[1:21:33.300 --> 1:21:35.860]  when it seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory
[1:21:35.860 --> 1:21:37.420]  turned out to be the truth.
[1:21:37.420 --> 1:21:38.260]  Yeah, I'm upset.
[1:21:38.260 --> 1:21:42.700]  I'm really, I'm really freaked out.
[1:21:42.700 --> 1:21:44.660]  I'm like, yeah, I'm really freaked out.
[1:21:44.660 --> 1:21:46.500]  I'm really freaked out.
[1:21:46.500 --> 1:21:47.900]  I'm really freaked out, you see?
[1:21:47.900 --> 1:21:49.620]  Because this is real.
[1:21:49.620 --> 1:21:51.260]  The supply chain being cut off.
[1:21:51.260 --> 1:21:53.500]  The energy grid being cut off is real.
[1:21:56.340 --> 1:21:57.980]  And we're going into a time now
[1:21:57.980 --> 1:21:59.780]  where we're not gonna be on the air.
[1:21:59.780 --> 1:22:01.380]  I mean, if we don't back this off,
[1:22:01.380 --> 1:22:03.620]  if we don't get sane people to stop the globalist,
[1:22:03.620 --> 1:22:06.820]  let me, we won't be here in six months.
[1:22:06.820 --> 1:22:09.060]  You won't be here in six months.
[1:22:14.460 --> 1:22:17.660]  This is the Alex Jones show, The Legendary.
[1:22:17.660 --> 1:22:20.820]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[1:22:20.820 --> 1:22:22.140]  InfoWars.com.
[1:22:22.140 --> 1:22:23.340]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[1:22:23.340 --> 1:22:24.340]  InfoWars.com.
[1:22:24.340 --> 1:22:25.900]  And so, you know, I think,
[1:22:25.900 --> 1:22:28.740]  I think what's happening today
[1:22:28.740 --> 1:22:30.740]  and why I'm just kind of a mess on air,
[1:22:30.740 --> 1:22:32.460]  it's not because I did six hours yesterday
[1:22:32.460 --> 1:22:33.460]  and I'm just burnt out.
[1:22:33.460 --> 1:22:34.740]  No, I could do that every day.
[1:22:34.740 --> 1:22:38.780]  It's, I think what's happening is you in the audience
[1:22:38.780 --> 1:22:42.520]  and just the average American that may not tune in,
[1:22:44.020 --> 1:22:46.060]  we're really starting to feel the pressure
[1:22:46.060 --> 1:22:49.860]  and we're really starting to see how desperate things are
[1:22:49.860 --> 1:22:50.980]  and how bad things are.
[1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:53.060]  And it's worse than we can even imagine.
[1:22:54.420 --> 1:22:58.980]  And I think the pressure is that people look at InfoWars
[1:22:58.980 --> 1:23:01.740]  and they look up to InfoWars thinking that, you know,
[1:23:01.740 --> 1:23:04.860]  I mean, folks, they're trying to destroy us.
[1:23:04.860 --> 1:23:07.020]  Like you understand, they're trying to destroy us.
[1:23:07.020 --> 1:23:08.380]  They're trying to destroy Alex Jones.
[1:23:08.380 --> 1:23:09.700]  They're trying to destroy me.
[1:23:09.700 --> 1:23:16.200]  Like, I just, I don't know.
[1:23:19.100 --> 1:23:19.940]  So here's what I'm gonna do.
[1:23:19.940 --> 1:23:21.420]  I can't even really host the show.
[1:23:21.420 --> 1:23:22.580]  So I'm gonna open up the phone lines.
[1:23:22.580 --> 1:23:24.540]  I'm too overwhelmed with it all.
[1:23:24.540 --> 1:23:27.420]  The number is 877-789-2539.
[1:23:27.420 --> 1:23:30.220]  877-789-2539.
[1:23:30.220 --> 1:23:31.420]  Just your calls on anything.
[1:23:31.420 --> 1:23:33.860]  Just whatever you wanna talk about.
[1:23:33.860 --> 1:23:37.460]  Joe Biden and the Democrats not wanting to replenish
[1:23:37.460 --> 1:23:40.740]  the strategic oil reserves at $24 a barrel
[1:23:40.740 --> 1:23:43.380]  and now they're emptying them to save their hopes
[1:23:43.380 --> 1:23:44.220]  at the midterms.
[1:23:44.220 --> 1:23:46.460]  What do you think is gonna happen at the midterms?
[1:23:46.460 --> 1:23:51.460]  Pfizer raising the price of the vaccine after yesterday.
[1:23:51.740 --> 1:23:54.300]  The CDC making it mandatory for children.
[1:23:54.300 --> 1:23:56.580]  Then Pfizer raises the price.
[1:23:56.580 --> 1:23:59.260]  A new poll, nearly 80% of American voters
[1:23:59.260 --> 1:24:01.740]  opposed transgender procedures on minors.
[1:24:01.740 --> 1:24:04.500]  Okay, so where should we send the other 20%
[1:24:04.500 --> 1:24:06.060]  that think that's a good thing?
[1:24:06.060 --> 1:24:08.660]  It's just absolutely nuts.
[1:24:12.300 --> 1:24:13.460]  It's just totally nuts.
[1:24:15.340 --> 1:24:20.340]  And so we got Mike Adams coming up in the third hour
[1:24:20.620 --> 1:24:22.100]  and the fourth hour with big news.
[1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:24.420]  We've got Pete Santilli hosting the war room today
[1:24:24.420 --> 1:24:25.980]  with huge exclusive news.
[1:24:25.980 --> 1:24:28.420]  You're not gonna see anywhere else.
[1:24:28.420 --> 1:24:32.020]  But I just, I can't focus and cover the news today
[1:24:32.020 --> 1:24:34.860]  because it's just, it's riffraff to me.
[1:24:34.860 --> 1:24:36.300]  It's cannon fodder to me.
[1:24:36.300 --> 1:24:37.380]  You know what's going on.
[1:24:37.380 --> 1:24:39.100]  I know what's going on.
[1:24:39.100 --> 1:24:41.780]  And this country's been marked for destruction.
[1:24:43.020 --> 1:24:44.900]  And it breaks your heart.
[1:24:44.900 --> 1:24:48.140]  It's just soul crushing to see your fellow brother,
[1:24:48.140 --> 1:24:52.620]  your fellow American cheering on their own destruction
[1:24:52.620 --> 1:24:55.020]  and dragging you down with them.
[1:24:57.140 --> 1:24:58.860]  So we have the Laura Logan clip.
[1:24:58.860 --> 1:25:01.780]  This is the clip that got her banned from Newsmax.
[1:25:01.780 --> 1:25:04.900]  You tell me if Laura Logan is lying here.
[1:25:04.900 --> 1:25:05.740]  Here it is.
[1:25:07.340 --> 1:25:08.180]  But you know what?
[1:25:08.180 --> 1:25:09.420]  It's even bigger than that.
[1:25:09.420 --> 1:25:11.980]  Because I, you know, I spoke to a man
[1:25:11.980 --> 1:25:14.900]  who was actually holding the documents in his hand.
[1:25:14.900 --> 1:25:15.740]  He told me about it.
[1:25:15.740 --> 1:25:16.860]  Is this the same clip, guys?
[1:25:16.860 --> 1:25:18.180]  He said he was, you know what?
[1:25:18.180 --> 1:25:19.020]  Pull it out.
[1:25:19.020 --> 1:25:19.860]  I'm done.
[1:25:19.860 --> 1:25:20.700]  I don't want it.
[1:25:20.700 --> 1:25:21.540]  Nevermind.
[1:25:21.540 --> 1:25:22.380]  You guys can go find the Laura Logan clip.
[1:25:22.380 --> 1:25:23.220]  It's no big deal.
[1:25:23.220 --> 1:25:25.900]  All right, let's go to, let's go to clip six.
[1:25:25.900 --> 1:25:29.700]  Now remember this gentleman, David Attenborough,
[1:25:29.700 --> 1:25:32.420]  was nominated to get a Nobel Peace Prize.
[1:25:32.420 --> 1:25:35.780]  He's a, he's a voiceover professional.
[1:25:35.780 --> 1:25:37.540]  He does voiceovers is what he does.
[1:25:37.540 --> 1:25:38.940]  And so I saw it and I said,
[1:25:38.940 --> 1:25:41.500]  why is David Attenborough on the list
[1:25:41.500 --> 1:25:43.420]  to receive the Nobel Peace Prize?
[1:25:43.420 --> 1:25:45.540]  Well, he just released this video
[1:25:45.540 --> 1:25:47.140]  and it answered the question,
[1:25:47.140 --> 1:25:50.980]  why is David Attenborough nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize?
[1:25:50.980 --> 1:25:52.140]  Here's why right here.
[1:25:54.140 --> 1:25:56.420]  In the last 150 years,
[1:25:56.420 --> 1:26:01.420]  the world has warmed on average by just over one degree Celsius.
[1:26:02.420 --> 1:26:05.140]  And our atmosphere now contains concentrations
[1:26:05.140 --> 1:26:08.620]  of carbon dioxide that have not been equaled
[1:26:08.620 --> 1:26:09.980]  for millions of years.
[1:26:09.980 --> 1:26:10.820]  Another lie.
[1:26:11.860 --> 1:26:13.380]  We are today,
[1:26:13.380 --> 1:26:16.580]  perilously close to tipping points.
[1:26:16.580 --> 1:26:17.820]  Oh yeah, he's had a lot of boosters.
[1:26:17.820 --> 1:26:19.220]  You can tell the boosters that do him well.
[1:26:19.220 --> 1:26:22.900]  Or send global temperatures spiraling catastrophically higher.
[1:26:22.900 --> 1:26:26.500]  If we continue on our current path,
[1:26:26.500 --> 1:26:29.780]  we will face the collapse of everything.
[1:26:29.780 --> 1:26:31.180]  They've said this for 50 years.
[1:26:31.180 --> 1:26:33.380]  They've been telling us this for 50 years.
[1:26:33.380 --> 1:26:37.980]  Food production, access to fresh water,
[1:26:37.980 --> 1:26:40.060]  habitable, and big temperature.
[1:26:40.060 --> 1:26:41.420]  The globalists are doing all this to you.
[1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:42.580]  Not the weather, the globalists.
[1:26:42.580 --> 1:26:44.300]  And ocean food chains.
[1:26:45.300 --> 1:26:47.900]  And if the natural world can no longer support
[1:26:47.900 --> 1:26:50.340]  the most basic of our needs,
[1:26:50.340 --> 1:26:53.260]  then much of the rest of civilization
[1:26:53.260 --> 1:26:55.060]  will quickly break down.
[1:26:56.660 --> 1:26:59.180]  Please make no mistake.
[1:27:00.500 --> 1:27:04.260]  Climate change is the biggest threat to security
[1:27:04.260 --> 1:27:05.500]  from modern humans.
[1:27:05.500 --> 1:27:06.340]  So all right, that's good.
[1:27:06.340 --> 1:27:07.740]  So you can see he can't even move his face.
[1:27:07.740 --> 1:27:09.260]  He's gotten a couple of boosters.
[1:27:09.260 --> 1:27:10.460]  They've destroyed his face.
[1:27:10.460 --> 1:27:12.700]  He can barely even open his eyes.
[1:27:12.700 --> 1:27:14.460]  But he did the global warming video.
[1:27:14.460 --> 1:27:17.060]  So now he gets nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.
[1:27:17.060 --> 1:27:19.060]  You want to know what's coming to the White House?
[1:27:19.060 --> 1:27:24.060]  Joe Biden has just invited one of the biggest trans activists
[1:27:24.700 --> 1:27:25.660]  to the White House.
[1:27:25.660 --> 1:27:28.340]  And here he is bragging about it in clip nine.
[1:27:28.340 --> 1:27:30.380]  It's day 222 of being a girl.
[1:27:30.380 --> 1:27:31.980]  I'm in Washington, D.C.
[1:27:31.980 --> 1:27:33.500]  and I'm going to the White House
[1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:36.060]  to speak to the President of the United States.
[1:27:37.060 --> 1:27:37.980]  You know that phrase?
[1:27:37.980 --> 1:27:40.740]  I fear I may have girlbossed too close to the sun.
[1:27:40.740 --> 1:27:41.900]  Well, that's how I feel today
[1:27:41.900 --> 1:27:45.060]  because I get to sit down with Joe Biden
[1:27:45.060 --> 1:27:47.860]  and now this news and I get to ask him a few questions
[1:27:47.860 --> 1:27:50.540]  surrounding trans issues in the United States
[1:27:50.540 --> 1:27:52.260]  and talk to him about my transness.
[1:27:52.260 --> 1:27:53.700]  And I really just want to...
[1:27:53.700 --> 1:27:54.540]  Okay, that's good.
[1:27:54.540 --> 1:27:55.740]  Go ahead and pull it down.
[1:27:55.740 --> 1:27:56.580]  You get the point.
[1:27:56.580 --> 1:27:57.980]  It's a total clown show.
[1:27:57.980 --> 1:28:00.140]  Listen to what Joe Biden lied about yesterday,
[1:28:00.140 --> 1:28:01.460]  calling Republican socialists.
[1:28:01.460 --> 1:28:02.940]  This is amazing in clip five.
[1:28:04.100 --> 1:28:06.940]  You didn't know there were that many socialist republicans.
[1:28:09.940 --> 1:28:13.580]  Public is called Biden infrastructure program socialist.
[1:28:13.580 --> 1:28:15.900]  And it goes through all of republicans
[1:28:15.900 --> 1:28:18.660]  and most conservative republicans call it socialism.
[1:28:25.820 --> 1:28:27.060]  Guy named Paul Gosier,
[1:28:27.060 --> 1:28:29.060]  he's written three separate letters.
[1:28:29.060 --> 1:28:29.900]  So here's what it is.
[1:28:29.900 --> 1:28:32.940]  So the Republicans voted against the infrastructure bill
[1:28:32.940 --> 1:28:34.860]  because it had billions of dollars in it
[1:28:34.860 --> 1:28:37.420]  that had nothing to do with infrastructure.
[1:28:37.420 --> 1:28:39.700]  And he says, oh, I get requests from Republicans
[1:28:39.700 --> 1:28:41.340]  to build infrastructure in their cities
[1:28:41.340 --> 1:28:43.180]  because that's money for infrastructure.
[1:28:43.180 --> 1:28:46.220]  The infrastructure bill had money for trans things
[1:28:46.220 --> 1:28:49.300]  and vaccine crap and masks.
[1:28:49.300 --> 1:28:51.260]  And that's not infrastructure, that's socialism.
[1:28:51.260 --> 1:28:53.020]  And then they say, hey, can we build a bridge?
[1:28:53.020 --> 1:28:54.740]  And Biden says, that's socialism.
[1:28:54.740 --> 1:28:57.940]  It's just unbelievable the lies, your call's next.
[1:28:57.940 --> 1:29:01.140]  I am extremely honored to be seen
[1:29:01.140 --> 1:29:04.060]  by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[1:29:04.060 --> 1:29:08.180]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore
[1:29:08.180 --> 1:29:13.180]  that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:29:13.260 --> 1:29:15.740]  They know the truth about their globalist operations
[1:29:15.740 --> 1:29:17.660]  is exposed, it's came over.
[1:29:17.660 --> 1:29:21.020]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening
[1:29:21.020 --> 1:29:23.260]  and peacefully fighting back.
[1:29:23.260 --> 1:29:25.420]  And our main tool is free speech
[1:29:25.420 --> 1:29:27.820]  and the truth we promote using free speech.
[1:29:27.820 --> 1:29:29.740]  That's why when you share articles and videos
[1:29:29.740 --> 1:29:33.220]  from band.video or infowars.com or newswars.com
[1:29:33.220 --> 1:29:34.460]  it changes the world.

[1:29:42.140 --> 1:29:44.860]  you're also empowering the tip of the spear
[1:29:44.860 --> 1:29:46.420]  in the fight against the globalist.

[1:29:57.980 --> 1:30:00.460]  Don't let the globalist monsters
[1:30:00.460 --> 1:30:02.580]  and their mercenary minions be successful
[1:30:02.580 --> 1:30:04.740]  at silencing you.
[1:30:04.740 --> 1:30:06.220]  And the globalist number one mission
[1:30:06.220 --> 1:30:07.820]  is to silence info wars
[1:30:07.820 --> 1:30:09.140]  because they rightly see us
[1:30:09.140 --> 1:30:11.420]  as one of the main beacons of resistance
[1:30:11.420 --> 1:30:13.780]  alerting the people, not as of America,
[1:30:13.780 --> 1:30:16.420]  but the world for the threat of the globalist
[1:30:16.420 --> 1:30:18.580]  and their censorship and tyranny.
[1:30:18.580 --> 1:30:20.500]  That's why it's so essential today,

[1:30:39.260 --> 1:30:40.660]  they're coming for you.
[1:30:40.660 --> 1:30:43.540]  I am in your hands and I'm asking of your support now

[1:31:01.580 --> 1:31:05.300]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics,
[1:31:05.300 --> 1:31:08.460]  we are always the cutting edge and tip of the spear.

[1:31:47.980 --> 1:31:49.820]  you've got to go to infowarsstore.com

[1:32:10.380 --> 1:32:12.020]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[1:32:12.020 --> 1:32:14.020]  And over the years, you have come to the table,
[1:32:14.020 --> 1:32:16.500]  you have stepped to the plate so many times
[1:32:16.500 --> 1:32:18.780]  and kept info wars and free speech on the air
[1:32:18.780 --> 1:32:19.740]  and I thank you.
[1:32:19.740 --> 1:32:22.020]  But now I have my own legal bills
[1:32:22.020 --> 1:32:24.260]  that have reached the point that I can't pay them
[1:32:24.260 --> 1:32:25.460]  and I need your support.
[1:32:25.460 --> 1:32:28.420]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward,

[1:32:44.140 --> 1:32:46.460]  foyers in the making is almost over
[1:32:46.460 --> 1:32:48.620]  and right at the end, we're not giving up,
[1:32:48.620 --> 1:32:50.660]  we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[1:32:50.660 --> 1:32:52.940]  So please, if you support what we're doing
[1:32:52.940 --> 1:32:54.500]  and want to fight for liberty and freedom

[1:32:58.420 --> 1:33:03.420]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:33:03.940 --> 1:33:05.780]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:09.500 --> 1:33:14.500]  Live from the info wars.com studios,
[1:33:21.540 --> 1:33:24.580]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:24.580 --> 1:33:28.180]  and now your host, Owen Shroyer.
[1:33:28.180 --> 1:33:29.540]  All right, before I go to your phone calls,
[1:33:29.540 --> 1:33:31.540]  I want to mention something really quick.
[1:33:33.100 --> 1:33:38.100]  So ABC News is reporting that an Arizona drop box
[1:33:42.140 --> 1:33:46.620]  has what they're claiming is voter intimidation
[1:33:46.620 --> 1:33:49.500]  because I guess somebody went to a voting drop box
[1:33:49.500 --> 1:33:54.500]  in Mesa, Arizona four or five times.
[1:33:54.500 --> 1:33:58.980]  And so the drop box watcher went out and confronted them
[1:33:58.980 --> 1:34:00.900]  and now they're saying, look, this is voter intimidation.
[1:34:00.900 --> 1:34:02.580]  Look, Republicans are doing voter intimidation.
[1:34:02.580 --> 1:34:04.700]  So folks, let me just say, I believe,
[1:34:04.700 --> 1:34:08.500]  I don't know this case, but this could easily be a setup
[1:34:08.500 --> 1:34:12.660]  where Democrats pretend they're drop box watching
[1:34:12.660 --> 1:34:16.060]  and then a Democrat goes to drop their ballot off
[1:34:16.060 --> 1:34:18.340]  and then they get into a fake little harassment
[1:34:18.340 --> 1:34:20.740]  and then they say, see, Republicans are doing voter intimidation
[1:34:20.740 --> 1:34:23.020]  at the drop boxes and then they make it illegal
[1:34:23.020 --> 1:34:24.700]  to monitor the drop boxes.
[1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:27.580]  So if you are out there doing drop box monitoring,
[1:34:27.580 --> 1:34:29.580]  do not confront these people.
[1:34:29.580 --> 1:34:31.020]  That's a trap.
[1:34:31.020 --> 1:34:34.700]  Document it, videotape it, do everything that's legal,
[1:34:34.700 --> 1:34:36.100]  do not confront them.
[1:34:36.100 --> 1:34:40.500]  That's what they want because the moment you confront them,
[1:34:40.500 --> 1:34:43.100]  then they're gonna claim that you're doing voter intimidation
[1:34:43.100 --> 1:34:44.620]  and they're gonna shut down the whole operation.
[1:34:44.620 --> 1:34:47.580]  So I don't know if this was two Democrats doing a false flag
[1:34:47.580 --> 1:34:50.660]  to reach that agenda, but I would not be surprised
[1:34:50.660 --> 1:34:53.340]  if that's what they wanted anyway or planning to do.
[1:34:53.340 --> 1:34:56.220]  So if you are watching the drop boxes,
[1:34:56.220 --> 1:34:58.180]  do not confront these people.
[1:34:58.180 --> 1:35:00.660]  Do not record it, videotape it,
[1:35:00.660 --> 1:35:02.180]  do everything you're supposed to do,
[1:35:02.180 --> 1:35:03.540]  but the minute you confront them,
[1:35:03.540 --> 1:35:05.180]  you're giving them exactly what they want
[1:35:05.180 --> 1:35:07.260]  and then they're gonna make poll watching
[1:35:07.260 --> 1:35:08.820]  and drop box watching illegal,
[1:35:08.820 --> 1:35:10.420]  which is really what the Democrats want
[1:35:10.420 --> 1:35:12.140]  because that's how they plan on cheating.
[1:35:12.140 --> 1:35:13.740]  So I wanted to mention that real quick.
[1:35:13.740 --> 1:35:15.660]  Now again, folks, infowarstore.com
[1:35:15.660 --> 1:35:17.860]  is how everything we do here is possible.
[1:35:17.860 --> 1:35:22.860]  And I mean, folks, it's just crazy.
[1:35:24.540 --> 1:35:26.740]  We wanna stay on air, that's the plan.
[1:35:27.580 --> 1:35:30.700]  They keep claiming we have all this money, we don't.
[1:35:30.700 --> 1:35:32.620]  So I mean, Alex Jones could just shut it down
[1:35:32.620 --> 1:35:34.500]  and he could just say, okay, fine,
[1:35:34.500 --> 1:35:36.700]  you wanna try to get a billion dollars out of me,
[1:35:36.700 --> 1:35:38.260]  you're not gonna do it, it doesn't exist,
[1:35:38.260 --> 1:35:39.900]  but they don't want the money.
[1:35:39.900 --> 1:35:42.340]  I mean, the plaintiffs might want the money, I don't know.
[1:35:42.340 --> 1:35:43.220]  The lawyers might want the money,
[1:35:43.220 --> 1:35:46.180]  but the real goal is to shut this place down.
[1:35:46.180 --> 1:35:47.940]  If you want infowarstore to stay on air,

[1:36:18.820 --> 1:36:22.420]  And whenever Alex Jones returns from this break,
[1:36:22.420 --> 1:36:23.940]  if he sees that the coffers are empty
[1:36:23.940 --> 1:36:25.580]  and there's no money and people aren't supporting,
[1:36:25.580 --> 1:36:27.180]  I don't know what that's gonna do to his psyche.
[1:36:27.180 --> 1:36:30.100]  So let's give a big round of support right now
[1:36:30.100 --> 1:36:34.220]  to Infowars by shopping at infowarstore.com
[1:36:34.220 --> 1:36:35.940]  and getting a great supplement
[1:36:35.940 --> 1:36:39.180]  that is important for your health and your immune system
[1:36:39.180 --> 1:36:40.900]  as we head into the colder weather,
[1:36:40.900 --> 1:36:45.540]  like vitamin D3 gummies, great for children as well.
[1:36:45.540 --> 1:36:47.940]  All right, let's go to the phone lines.
[1:36:47.940 --> 1:36:50.740]  Let's go to Mike in Florida.
[1:36:50.740 --> 1:36:53.060]  Mike, you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[1:36:54.740 --> 1:36:56.020]  How you doing, Owen?
[1:36:56.020 --> 1:36:58.260]  Yeah, man, nothing really specific
[1:36:58.260 --> 1:37:00.740]  just to talk about other than my observation out here
[1:37:00.740 --> 1:37:02.340]  when I'm talking to people waking them up.
[1:37:02.340 --> 1:37:04.620]  And I'm at the point where I just go,
[1:37:04.620 --> 1:37:07.620]  what do you need to see to wake up?
[1:37:07.620 --> 1:37:09.260]  What has to happen to wake up?
[1:37:09.260 --> 1:37:11.100]  I mean, like you said, covering the news,
[1:37:11.100 --> 1:37:12.980]  I mean, it just gets monotonous over time,
[1:37:12.980 --> 1:37:15.580]  but there's a million things I can point out
[1:37:15.580 --> 1:37:16.980]  and then they'll point out one little thing
[1:37:16.980 --> 1:37:18.820]  and that millions strings of fabric
[1:37:18.820 --> 1:37:19.980]  that maybe doesn't make sense
[1:37:19.980 --> 1:37:21.180]  and then they just go against it.
[1:37:21.180 --> 1:37:23.540]  So I think it's just cognitive dissonance that it's worse.
[1:37:23.540 --> 1:37:26.700]  No, it really is, it's reaching a level of,
[1:37:26.700 --> 1:37:29.100]  it can't even be explained, I would say.
[1:37:29.100 --> 1:37:30.580]  It really, it can't even be explained.
[1:37:30.580 --> 1:37:32.620]  That's why I'm going to odd places
[1:37:32.620 --> 1:37:33.980]  to try to make sense of it all.
[1:37:33.980 --> 1:37:35.300]  Are these people even human?
[1:37:35.300 --> 1:37:36.260]  Are they aliens?
[1:37:36.260 --> 1:37:39.220]  Are they NPCs in some sort of weird simulation we're in?
[1:37:39.220 --> 1:37:41.060]  I mean, are they under MK Ultra?
[1:37:41.060 --> 1:37:42.580]  Do they really just hate everything?
[1:37:42.580 --> 1:37:43.500]  Hate life that much?
[1:37:43.500 --> 1:37:45.180]  They enjoy lying to themselves,
[1:37:45.180 --> 1:37:46.900]  lying to everyone else around them.
[1:37:46.900 --> 1:37:48.860]  24 seven, it's crazy.
[1:37:48.860 --> 1:37:53.260]  I mean, that's my whole goal is to inform people
[1:37:53.260 --> 1:37:55.700]  that want to be informed with the news every day
[1:37:55.700 --> 1:37:57.460]  and then using the news every day
[1:37:57.460 --> 1:37:59.140]  for those that don't understand what's going on
[1:37:59.140 --> 1:38:00.940]  so that they can see what's going on.
[1:38:00.940 --> 1:38:02.460]  But like you said, at this point,
[1:38:02.460 --> 1:38:04.340]  if you don't see what's going on,
[1:38:04.340 --> 1:38:05.300]  what is it going to take?
[1:38:05.300 --> 1:38:06.860]  You're going to end up in a gulag.
[1:38:06.860 --> 1:38:08.620]  You're going to die from the vaccine.
[1:38:08.620 --> 1:38:10.940]  You're going to be poor and starving on the street.
[1:38:10.940 --> 1:38:12.780]  So I mean, I guess that's what it's going to take.
[1:38:12.780 --> 1:38:15.140]  I'm afraid, Mike, that is what it's going to take now.
[1:38:15.140 --> 1:38:17.180]  Well, look at that, for example,
[1:38:17.180 --> 1:38:18.940]  like event 201, for an example,
[1:38:18.940 --> 1:38:21.340]  I'll show somebody their own website.
[1:38:21.340 --> 1:38:23.900]  John Hopkins Bill and Linda Gates Foundation,
[1:38:23.900 --> 1:38:26.660]  World Economic Forum, they put on that event.
[1:38:26.660 --> 1:38:28.340]  They made that website.
[1:38:28.340 --> 1:38:30.380]  The information is on the website
[1:38:30.380 --> 1:38:33.740]  of exactly the plan for COVID and the vaccine,
[1:38:33.740 --> 1:38:35.340]  the whole thing, but way before it even happened.
[1:38:35.340 --> 1:38:36.540]  It's right there.
[1:38:36.540 --> 1:38:37.940]  One of us didn't make that site.
[1:38:37.940 --> 1:38:38.980]  They made it.
[1:38:40.900 --> 1:38:41.740]  It's insane.
[1:38:43.940 --> 1:38:46.180]  Yeah, believe me, Mike, that's why today,
[1:38:46.180 --> 1:38:47.380]  I just can't even really,
[1:38:47.380 --> 1:38:48.460]  I can't even host a show.
[1:38:48.460 --> 1:38:53.460]  Cause I mean, we almost have reached this point where,
[1:38:54.060 --> 1:38:55.860]  I mean, I've almost intellectually reached this point.
[1:38:55.860 --> 1:38:57.420]  And look, I could change my emotions,
[1:38:57.420 --> 1:38:59.260]  change everybody's emotional here.
[1:38:59.260 --> 1:39:01.020]  But I mean, right now I'm at the point
[1:39:01.020 --> 1:39:03.860]  where I just look at the future and I just say,
[1:39:03.860 --> 1:39:05.820]  either you get it or you don't.
[1:39:05.820 --> 1:39:07.820]  And the only way people are going to get it now
[1:39:07.820 --> 1:39:09.660]  is if in the next two years,
[1:39:09.660 --> 1:39:11.540]  this country just completely collapses,
[1:39:11.540 --> 1:39:14.220]  gas prices, $10, $15 a gallon,
[1:39:14.220 --> 1:39:16.660]  grocery bills going up 500%,
[1:39:16.660 --> 1:39:19.260]  energy bills going up 1000%.
[1:39:19.260 --> 1:39:22.540]  You won't be able to afford to heat or cool your home.
[1:39:22.540 --> 1:39:24.460]  I mean, that's where this is all going.
[1:39:24.460 --> 1:39:26.780]  I mean, it's like, do you think it's bad now?
[1:39:26.780 --> 1:39:29.260]  Imagine two more years of Joe Biden in the White House,
[1:39:29.260 --> 1:39:32.420]  plus a more radicalized Democrat Congress.
[1:39:32.420 --> 1:39:33.420]  Like it's gonna be bad.
[1:39:33.420 --> 1:39:34.700]  Mike, thank you so much for the call.
[1:39:34.700 --> 1:39:36.540]  Let's go to Chelsea in Florida.
[1:39:36.540 --> 1:39:39.820]  Chelsea, you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[1:39:39.820 --> 1:39:43.260]  What up, oh, we're in Alpha Gang.
[1:39:43.260 --> 1:39:44.300]  How are ya?
[1:39:44.300 --> 1:39:46.540]  Hey, I'm great, thanks for calling.
[1:39:46.540 --> 1:39:49.020]  Okay, I just wanna invite the nation
[1:39:49.020 --> 1:39:53.100]  to a 14 days prayer proclamation for America.
[1:39:53.100 --> 1:39:55.540]  My church, Hague Ministries is doing it.
[1:39:55.540 --> 1:39:58.340]  I'm an online member because I'm here in Florida.
[1:39:58.340 --> 1:40:01.180]  It's October 26th to November 8th.
[1:40:01.180 --> 1:40:04.500]  You can go to jhm.org, sign up for their emails.
[1:40:04.500 --> 1:40:06.100]  And they're gonna be sending out the download,
[1:40:06.100 --> 1:40:07.980]  which is 14 day prayer.
[1:40:07.980 --> 1:40:09.460]  And if the nation can come together,
[1:40:09.460 --> 1:40:13.580]  you know, two Chronicles 714 says
[1:40:13.580 --> 1:40:15.020]  that the Lord will forgive our land.
[1:40:15.020 --> 1:40:16.420]  So I just wanna throw that out there
[1:40:16.420 --> 1:40:18.100]  to everybody that's feeling down.
[1:40:18.100 --> 1:40:19.340]  We got that coming up again.
[1:40:19.340 --> 1:40:21.740]  It's October 26th to November 8th.
[1:40:21.740 --> 1:40:24.060]  And that's right, the two weeks before the midterm.
[1:40:24.060 --> 1:40:25.100]  That's what we need.
[1:40:25.100 --> 1:40:27.580]  And that's the point, it's just like,
[1:40:27.580 --> 1:40:31.460]  there's no, I don't think there's any human intervention
[1:40:31.460 --> 1:40:32.780]  that can save us from what's coming.
[1:40:32.780 --> 1:40:34.780]  Only God's intervention at this point.
[1:40:34.780 --> 1:40:37.620]  Amen to that, and he is good.
[1:40:37.620 --> 1:40:40.660]  I hope you enjoy, you can go out this beautiful day
[1:40:40.660 --> 1:40:42.780]  and enjoy it, maybe work out.
[1:40:42.780 --> 1:40:46.260]  I just took, I've been on Diab Force for three months.
[1:40:46.260 --> 1:40:48.820]  Down 30 pounds, so.
[1:40:48.820 --> 1:40:50.220]  Well, good for you, you sound great.
[1:40:50.220 --> 1:40:52.220]  You've worked out my body as well.
[1:40:52.220 --> 1:40:53.060]  Thank you. That's awesome.
[1:40:53.060 --> 1:40:55.420]  I'm so glad that the products at infowarestore.com
[1:40:55.420 --> 1:40:57.420]  worked for you as they do everyone else.
[1:40:57.420 --> 1:40:59.060]  Thank you so much for that call.
[1:40:59.060 --> 1:41:01.980]  By the way, you know, there's really no time off here.
[1:41:01.980 --> 1:41:06.180]  Tomorrow, we're gonna be out in the Infowars truck.
[1:41:06.180 --> 1:41:08.140]  So be on the lookout for that.
[1:41:08.140 --> 1:41:11.140]  I'm gonna do a live stream on my getter account.
[1:41:11.140 --> 1:41:14.260]  We'll post the HD video to band.video.
[1:41:14.260 --> 1:41:16.700]  But we're gonna go out in the armored truck tomorrow.
[1:41:16.700 --> 1:41:18.540]  Could be one of the last times we have to go out in it.
[1:41:18.540 --> 1:41:20.860]  We're probably gonna have to sell it to pay some bills.
[1:41:20.860 --> 1:41:22.780]  So be on the lookout for that.
[1:41:22.780 --> 1:41:27.780]  Let's go to, let's go to Joe calling in.
[1:41:27.860 --> 1:41:30.460]  He's in the USA, Joe, go ahead.
[1:41:30.460 --> 1:41:32.660]  Hey, what's going on, Owen?
[1:41:32.660 --> 1:41:33.980]  Hi.
[1:41:33.980 --> 1:41:35.820]  All right, so I brought this up
[1:41:35.820 --> 1:41:37.940]  on the Christel Stato radio show
[1:41:37.940 --> 1:41:40.340]  and he just totally snubbed it off.
[1:41:40.340 --> 1:41:41.780]  I think there should be a law
[1:41:41.780 --> 1:41:45.780]  that if you hold any sort of government clearance,
[1:41:45.780 --> 1:41:48.580]  that, you know, husband and wife
[1:41:48.580 --> 1:41:51.300]  should be made to testify against each other.
[1:41:51.300 --> 1:41:52.700]  They shouldn't have that immunity,
[1:41:52.700 --> 1:41:53.900]  because basically-
[1:41:53.900 --> 1:41:56.180]  Are you talking about with stocks?
[1:41:56.180 --> 1:41:57.020]  With that?
[1:41:57.020 --> 1:41:59.060]  What are you talking about with stocks or what?
[1:41:59.060 --> 1:42:01.180]  No, no, I'm just saying like in general,
[1:42:01.180 --> 1:42:03.940]  like if you hold like government clearance
[1:42:03.940 --> 1:42:05.540]  in the government, right?
[1:42:05.540 --> 1:42:08.220]  Especially high level government clearance
[1:42:08.220 --> 1:42:12.220]  that spouse, they shouldn't be allowed
[1:42:12.220 --> 1:42:16.100]  to have immunity from testifying against each other.
[1:42:16.100 --> 1:42:19.060]  Because to me, marriage is the glue
[1:42:19.060 --> 1:42:23.660]  that's holding all the corruption together in Washington, DC.
[1:42:23.660 --> 1:42:26.540]  Because I'll read this real quick.
[1:42:26.540 --> 1:42:30.260]  Spousal privilege specifically protects the marital relationship.
[1:42:30.260 --> 1:42:31.860]  It gives one spouse the privilege
[1:42:31.860 --> 1:42:34.420]  to refuse to testify against the other
[1:42:34.420 --> 1:42:36.780]  without legal ramifications
[1:42:36.780 --> 1:42:39.100]  in order to protect the marital relationship
[1:42:39.100 --> 1:42:41.820]  from the harm that would come of one spouse-
[1:42:41.820 --> 1:42:42.980]  Well, I'll tell you what, Joe.
[1:42:42.980 --> 1:42:45.020]  I'll tell you what, I don't-
[1:42:46.900 --> 1:42:49.060]  Boy, that's, because you're right, you're right.
[1:42:49.060 --> 1:42:51.660]  All the intertwining marriages
[1:42:51.660 --> 1:42:53.180]  protects all these people in DC.
[1:42:53.180 --> 1:42:54.700]  You're 100% right about that.
[1:42:54.700 --> 1:42:56.460]  But boy, oh boy, you're talking, I don't know,
[1:42:56.460 --> 1:42:57.300]  oh yeah, wow.
[1:42:58.580 --> 1:43:02.140]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[1:43:02.140 --> 1:43:03.220]  But when you fight tyranny,
[1:43:03.220 --> 1:43:05.220]  the new world order comes after you.
[1:43:05.220 --> 1:43:06.860]  Now, I knew that.
[1:43:06.860 --> 1:43:09.660]  And for 28 years I've been on air exposing these people
[1:43:09.660 --> 1:43:11.540]  and together we've had a great effect.
[1:43:11.540 --> 1:43:13.620]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[1:43:13.620 --> 1:43:14.780]  They're trying to shut us down,
[1:43:14.780 --> 1:43:17.100]  but they can't beat the power of we the people
[1:43:17.100 --> 1:43:18.380]  of you and I together.

[1:43:59.860 --> 1:44:04.780]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with a globalist.
[1:44:04.780 --> 1:44:08.700]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics,
[1:44:08.700 --> 1:44:11.220]  not just in America, but in the world.
[1:44:11.220 --> 1:44:14.660]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range
[1:44:14.660 --> 1:44:18.060]  in the information war, but I don't deserve the credit.
[1:44:18.060 --> 1:44:21.100]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers
[1:44:21.100 --> 1:44:23.540]  who've supported info wars are the real reason
[1:44:23.540 --> 1:44:25.260]  you have the success.
[1:44:25.260 --> 1:44:27.500]  We're having now the greatest victories
[1:44:27.500 --> 1:44:30.660]  in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[1:44:30.660 --> 1:44:35.020]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon,
[1:44:35.020 --> 1:44:38.100]  and that's why today it's more important than ever
[1:44:38.100 --> 1:44:40.260]  to realize how important you've been in this fight
[1:44:40.260 --> 1:44:42.860]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out
[1:44:42.860 --> 1:44:44.220]  and to intensify them.
[1:44:44.220 --> 1:44:47.620]  God bless you all, I salute you, I thank you,
[1:44:47.620 --> 1:44:50.620]  and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[1:44:50.620 --> 1:44:53.780]  because we are over the target and history is happening.
[1:44:53.780 --> 1:44:56.460]  The fight is my fight, it's your fight, it's our fight.
[1:44:56.460 --> 1:44:57.620]  God bless you all.
[1:44:58.620 --> 1:45:02.300]  Think about a world without info wars.
[1:45:03.500 --> 1:45:05.700]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about
[1:45:05.700 --> 1:45:08.700]  all the incredible guests and callers and stories
[1:45:08.700 --> 1:45:11.620]  we've broken together, this family that is info wars.
[1:45:13.100 --> 1:45:16.100]  Think about how info wars is cited by Joe Rogan
[1:45:16.100 --> 1:45:19.860]  and Tucker Carlson and Bal Senaro and other foreign leaders
[1:45:19.860 --> 1:45:24.340]  like Nigel Farage as being the main impotest
[1:45:24.340 --> 1:45:27.100]  towards firing up their main base
[1:45:27.100 --> 1:45:29.300]  to defeat the new world order.
[1:45:29.300 --> 1:45:33.060]  The only reason humanity's still in the fight today
[1:45:33.060 --> 1:45:36.460]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[1:45:36.460 --> 1:45:38.660]  have taken action and supported this show.
[1:45:39.620 --> 1:45:43.100]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit.
[1:45:43.100 --> 1:45:45.740]  And now info wars is facing its darkest hours
[1:45:45.740 --> 1:45:47.340]  and isn't gonna give up.
[1:45:47.340 --> 1:45:49.180]  Without your support we can be shut down.

[1:45:58.580 --> 1:46:02.700]  Fluoride is the enemy, it's the bad halogen.
[1:46:02.700 --> 1:46:06.500]  To the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[1:46:06.500 --> 1:46:08.180]  What's the good halogen?
[1:46:08.180 --> 1:46:10.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.
[1:46:10.980 --> 1:46:12.660]  And we have the highest quality iodine
[1:46:12.660 --> 1:46:15.100]  you're gonna find anywhere exclusively

[1:46:24.500 --> 1:46:27.420]  better into the cells for all cellular function
[1:46:27.420 --> 1:46:30.220]  and for energy and so much more.

[1:46:53.500 --> 1:46:56.820]  ["The New World Order"]
[1:46:59.060 --> 1:47:01.860]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies
[1:47:01.860 --> 1:47:05.460]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:09.540 --> 1:47:12.220]  ["The New World Order"]
[1:47:12.220 --> 1:47:14.140]  All right, we're back here taking your phone calls.
[1:47:14.140 --> 1:47:17.380]  Remember, folks, shop at infowarstore.com
[1:47:17.380 --> 1:47:18.620]  if you wanna keep us on the air.
[1:47:18.620 --> 1:47:20.220]  Simple as that.
[1:47:20.220 --> 1:47:22.380]  All right, let's go back to the phone lines now.
[1:47:22.380 --> 1:47:24.940]  Let's go to Dave in Pennsylvania.
[1:47:24.940 --> 1:47:27.660]  Dave, you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[1:47:27.660 --> 1:47:28.980]  Hey, Owen, how's it going?
[1:47:28.980 --> 1:47:31.060]  All right, thanks for calling.
[1:47:31.060 --> 1:47:33.620]  I started reading the Bible a few months ago.
[1:47:33.620 --> 1:47:35.820]  I'm about halfway through, but something
[1:47:35.820 --> 1:47:37.660]  that really caught my attention,
[1:47:37.660 --> 1:47:39.780]  it's so relevant to what's happening today
[1:47:39.780 --> 1:47:40.700]  and it's real simple.
[1:47:40.700 --> 1:47:45.100]  It's, I'm up to about proverbs chapter 25,
[1:47:45.100 --> 1:47:47.900]  but they specifically mention lies,
[1:47:47.900 --> 1:47:50.940]  liars versus truth tellers.
[1:47:50.940 --> 1:47:55.020]  They call them sluggards or like lazy people
[1:47:55.020 --> 1:47:58.220]  and then they specifically mention schemers,
[1:47:58.220 --> 1:47:59.540]  which are liars.
[1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:01.860]  So the schemers and the liars are meant
[1:48:01.860 --> 1:48:04.340]  to cause chaos with their words,
[1:48:04.340 --> 1:48:06.020]  which is what you see everywhere,
[1:48:06.020 --> 1:48:07.420]  everywhere you look in the media
[1:48:07.420 --> 1:48:09.660]  and all the people that have control
[1:48:09.660 --> 1:48:11.300]  of the news networks, et cetera.
[1:48:11.300 --> 1:48:13.100]  Then you have the truth tellers.
[1:48:13.100 --> 1:48:14.580]  They're not loud and obnoxious.
[1:48:14.580 --> 1:48:19.100]  They speak softly and their truth causes peace.
[1:48:19.100 --> 1:48:24.100]  So God celebrates those who rebuke the liars.
[1:48:24.220 --> 1:48:26.860]  So what I'm thinking is obviously info wars,
[1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:28.140]  you guys are on the good side.
[1:48:28.140 --> 1:48:29.700]  You're doing what needs to be done
[1:48:29.700 --> 1:48:32.420]  just simply by speaking the truth.
[1:48:32.420 --> 1:48:34.700]  But then you look at the evildoers
[1:48:34.700 --> 1:48:36.380]  who are spreading all the lies.
[1:48:36.380 --> 1:48:39.660]  They're not only lying to cause chaos,
[1:48:39.660 --> 1:48:43.740]  but they're actively going after the truth tellers
[1:48:43.740 --> 1:48:46.340]  as and calling them liars.
[1:48:46.340 --> 1:48:50.420]  So the people at the top are truly the evil ones,
[1:48:50.420 --> 1:48:55.420]  but the ones who just believe the lies are misled.
[1:48:55.780 --> 1:48:59.180]  So not like my neighbor, for example, good guy,
[1:48:59.180 --> 1:49:02.580]  he's got his Biden sign out there, drives me nuts.
[1:49:02.580 --> 1:49:04.500]  I don't think he's truly evil,
[1:49:04.500 --> 1:49:06.140]  but I think he's just misled
[1:49:06.140 --> 1:49:08.740]  because he's believing the garbage that he's hearing.
[1:49:08.740 --> 1:49:11.980]  So the question is they're going after you
[1:49:11.980 --> 1:49:15.020]  because of everything you guys always say.
[1:49:15.020 --> 1:49:16.660]  You got a growing following
[1:49:16.660 --> 1:49:20.100]  and more and more people are learning the truth
[1:49:20.100 --> 1:49:22.540]  and the liars are all being exposed
[1:49:22.540 --> 1:49:24.740]  and that's their biggest fear.
[1:49:24.740 --> 1:49:27.660]  So how do we go on the aggressive
[1:49:27.660 --> 1:49:30.700]  to spread the truth even further?
[1:49:30.700 --> 1:49:31.820]  What does that look like?
[1:49:31.820 --> 1:49:35.860]  Is it having conversations with everyone you run into?
[1:49:35.860 --> 1:49:39.420]  What does it look like when you can change someone's mind
[1:49:39.420 --> 1:49:42.460]  and open their eyes up to the truth?
[1:49:42.460 --> 1:49:45.700]  You know, and I think we just have to keep on
[1:49:45.700 --> 1:49:47.020]  fighting the good fight.
[1:49:47.020 --> 1:49:48.940]  And I think I'm hopeful
[1:49:48.940 --> 1:49:52.220]  because I know that there's more of us than them.
[1:49:52.220 --> 1:49:55.780]  You just don't see it because we're not boasting about it
[1:49:55.780 --> 1:49:58.220]  because we know we've become a target.
[1:49:58.220 --> 1:49:59.540]  But I know there's more.
[1:49:59.540 --> 1:50:04.260]  I mean, any anecdotal evidence of the realization of that
[1:50:04.260 --> 1:50:06.140]  is not going to be provided to us.
[1:50:06.140 --> 1:50:08.340]  I mean, we can point things out,
[1:50:08.340 --> 1:50:10.980]  like look at the ratings on TV shows
[1:50:10.980 --> 1:50:12.260]  or look at where the audience is
[1:50:12.260 --> 1:50:15.220]  or look at Trump rallies, 50,000 people at a Trump rally,
[1:50:15.220 --> 1:50:16.780]  a Biden rally, 50 people.
[1:50:16.780 --> 1:50:20.740]  So I mean, there's certain things we can look at that prove
[1:50:20.740 --> 1:50:23.220]  but here's what I've learned through time.
[1:50:23.220 --> 1:50:24.700]  And I'll relate this back to your neighbor
[1:50:24.700 --> 1:50:26.340]  and thank you for the call, Dave.
[1:50:27.580 --> 1:50:32.660]  People, it's very, very rare, very, very rare
[1:50:32.660 --> 1:50:34.620]  that you can actually change someone's mind
[1:50:34.620 --> 1:50:36.300]  in a conversation like that
[1:50:36.300 --> 1:50:40.300]  or bring up in a debate like that just on the streets
[1:50:40.300 --> 1:50:41.820]  or at the supermarket or with your neighbor.
[1:50:41.820 --> 1:50:43.780]  It's very rare.
[1:50:43.780 --> 1:50:46.060]  It's almost impossible even.
[1:50:46.060 --> 1:50:49.620]  Now, the only way for people to realize the truth
[1:50:49.620 --> 1:50:51.100]  is to realize it for themselves.
[1:50:51.100 --> 1:50:52.500]  That was the case with me.
[1:50:53.580 --> 1:50:56.700]  That's probably the case with most people in this audience.
[1:50:56.700 --> 1:50:59.100]  Now there's times where you can kind of inject something
[1:50:59.100 --> 1:51:00.580]  or you can throw them a bone
[1:51:00.580 --> 1:51:02.780]  or kind of leave a bread crumb trail
[1:51:02.780 --> 1:51:04.220]  that might lead them to the truth
[1:51:04.220 --> 1:51:07.820]  but they always have to discover it for themselves.
[1:51:07.820 --> 1:51:11.580]  The only time they might be able to have a mind change
[1:51:11.580 --> 1:51:13.660]  is when you see an actual political debate.
[1:51:13.660 --> 1:51:15.180]  That's why political debates are so important.
[1:51:15.180 --> 1:51:17.820]  That's why the Democrats don't wanna do them anymore.
[1:51:17.820 --> 1:51:18.980]  Like the debate I played earlier
[1:51:18.980 --> 1:51:21.100]  at the walk away debate with Shamika Michelle.
[1:51:21.100 --> 1:51:22.460]  That's powerful.
[1:51:22.460 --> 1:51:24.380]  That can change people's minds.
[1:51:24.380 --> 1:51:25.740]  But just a conversation,
[1:51:25.740 --> 1:51:28.220]  it's almost impossible to change someone's minds.
[1:51:28.220 --> 1:51:29.380]  You can try to lead them to water
[1:51:29.380 --> 1:51:32.220]  but you can't force them to drink type of a thing.
[1:51:33.180 --> 1:51:35.740]  Now I wanna relate that to the development
[1:51:35.740 --> 1:51:36.820]  I mentioned earlier.
[1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:39.700]  Now Elon Musk has said he's gonna cut 75%
[1:51:39.700 --> 1:51:41.740]  of Twitter's workforce once he gets there.
[1:51:41.740 --> 1:51:42.880]  That's a good start.
[1:51:44.660 --> 1:51:46.060]  I think the Democrats gonna make sure
[1:51:46.060 --> 1:51:47.740]  he can't get on there till after the midterms
[1:51:47.740 --> 1:51:49.260]  because here's what I'm seeing.
[1:51:49.260 --> 1:51:50.660]  Every fourth tweet now,
[1:51:50.660 --> 1:51:52.380]  if you get on Twitter, you're probably seeing the same thing.
[1:51:52.380 --> 1:51:54.780]  Every fourth tweet is Democrat party propaganda.
[1:51:54.780 --> 1:51:57.540]  And by the way, Joe Biden just invited
[1:51:57.540 --> 1:52:01.380]  all of his Twitter propagandists to the White House today.
[1:52:01.380 --> 1:52:06.380]  You've got about 30 Democrat paid for Twitter propagandists
[1:52:06.700 --> 1:52:09.380]  at the White House today.
[1:52:09.380 --> 1:52:10.900]  So they're doing it big.
[1:52:11.900 --> 1:52:15.620]  And Roger Stone was right all along
[1:52:15.620 --> 1:52:18.460]  and it's too bad the Republican party didn't listen to him.
[1:52:18.460 --> 1:52:20.140]  It's too bad Donald Trump didn't listen to him
[1:52:20.140 --> 1:52:21.420]  because he was right.
[1:52:21.420 --> 1:52:23.620]  Because if you're neutral,
[1:52:23.620 --> 1:52:25.380]  and it's the same thing with the mainstream media,
[1:52:25.380 --> 1:52:27.500]  television, Twitter, wherever you go,
[1:52:27.500 --> 1:52:29.700]  it's all the mainstream media.
[1:52:29.700 --> 1:52:32.100]  Overwhelmed with Democrat party propaganda,
[1:52:32.100 --> 1:52:33.580]  overwhelmed with liberal propaganda.
[1:52:33.580 --> 1:52:34.580]  So you talk about your neighbor,
[1:52:34.580 --> 1:52:35.700]  he doesn't know any better.
[1:52:35.700 --> 1:52:37.860]  He's got the Biden sign, he doesn't know any better.
[1:52:37.860 --> 1:52:38.700]  Well, why?
[1:52:38.700 --> 1:52:41.140]  Because he turns on the TV, local news,
[1:52:41.140 --> 1:52:43.180]  late night talk show, mainstream news,
[1:52:43.180 --> 1:52:46.140]  and all he sees is Republicans bad, Democrats good,
[1:52:46.140 --> 1:52:47.500]  to put it simply.
[1:52:47.500 --> 1:52:49.940]  Same thing when you log on to Twitter.
[1:52:51.060 --> 1:52:53.680]  And so this is gonna crush Republicans, folks.
[1:52:53.680 --> 1:52:57.600]  The internet censorship and the fake news media
[1:52:57.600 --> 1:53:00.120]  is gonna crush Republicans, I'm afraid, in this midterm.
[1:53:00.120 --> 1:53:01.720]  And because they've never been able
[1:53:01.720 --> 1:53:04.520]  to do anything about it, it's going to crush them.
[1:53:04.520 --> 1:53:06.200]  And Roger Stone was right.
[1:53:06.200 --> 1:53:09.840]  The internet censorship is going to crush Republicans.
[1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:12.160]  I think this midterm election is gonna be
[1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:14.600]  the most consequential when that is concerned.
[1:53:15.720 --> 1:53:18.000]  Because even before with the Hunter Biden laptop
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:21.840]  and that censorship, it's one thing to censor the truth.
[1:53:21.840 --> 1:53:23.600]  It's a whole nother thing to censor the truth
[1:53:23.600 --> 1:53:27.600]  and then pile on your propaganda on top of it.
[1:53:27.600 --> 1:53:31.060]  And we're seeing that more than ever right now.
[1:53:32.440 --> 1:53:37.440]  So to the unassuming, ignorant, apolitical American,
[1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:41.200]  all they see is pro-democrat party propaganda,
[1:53:41.200 --> 1:53:43.000]  anti-Republican party propaganda,
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  and they end up going to vote Democrat.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:46.600]  And so that's a serious problem.
[1:53:46.600 --> 1:53:48.120]  You're right, your neighbor's probably not evil.
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:49.880]  He's been propagandized.
[1:53:49.880 --> 1:53:51.920]  And it just goes on every day
[1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:53.240]  and Barack Obama made it legal.
[1:53:53.240 --> 1:53:55.200]  And now you have all the Twitter propagandists
[1:53:55.200 --> 1:53:57.800]  that the Democrats pay for at the White House today.
[1:53:57.800 --> 1:53:59.880]  All right, let's go to Bob in New York City.
[1:53:59.880 --> 1:54:02.040]  Bob, you're on the Alex Jones show, go ahead.
[1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:06.080]  Hey, Owen, start with a prayer for you
[1:54:06.080 --> 1:54:07.720]  and blue light to protect us all.
[1:54:07.720 --> 1:54:11.480]  Thank you so much for being a co-host, big deal.
[1:54:11.480 --> 1:54:12.320]  Thank you.
[1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:16.480]  If you wanna know where I've been for the last year,
[1:54:16.480 --> 1:54:18.680]  essentially, it's from a phone call
[1:54:18.680 --> 1:54:21.200]  from Alex Jones' show in December 2nd,
[1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:23.720]  talking about our sit-ins in New York
[1:54:23.720 --> 1:54:25.960]  and battling good and evil, really.
[1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:28.000]  That's what we're doing here in New York.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.280]  So if you wanna know the work of the Archangel Michael
[1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:33.400]  in New York City, go to Austeer Scholar on Rumble,
[1:54:33.400 --> 1:54:35.400]  and you'll see video after video.
[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:38.400]  We went viral yesterday because that's my group of people
[1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:40.640]  that go to confront people.
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:43.920]  And we went to AOC herself and just embarrassed her.
[1:54:43.920 --> 1:54:44.760]  Anyway, it's going for...
[1:54:44.760 --> 1:54:46.440]  Yeah, she's getting protested every time.
[1:54:46.440 --> 1:54:49.200]  And I kind of, in a way,
[1:54:49.200 --> 1:54:51.520]  I mean, obviously I don't like AOC's politics,
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:53.960]  but in a way, I kind of, she is probably,
[1:54:53.960 --> 1:54:56.200]  or she's mostly, I mean, she goes out there
[1:54:56.200 --> 1:54:57.040]  and deals with the people.
[1:54:57.040 --> 1:54:58.720]  She actually sits there and goes face-to-face
[1:54:58.720 --> 1:54:59.760]  with the protesters.
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:01.400]  I kind of respect that in a way,
[1:55:01.400 --> 1:55:03.520]  but she's getting protested at her own events now
[1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:05.240]  every time by liberals.
[1:55:06.520 --> 1:55:08.880]  Yeah, well, half the room was not liberal,
[1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:10.160]  let me tell you about that.
[1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:11.680]  See, we do stuff like that.
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:14.600]  See, there's about 250 people who have been battling
[1:55:14.600 --> 1:55:17.160]  the mandate since 2020, hardcore people.
[1:55:17.160 --> 1:55:19.400]  The unfortunate thing is that it's sort of flattened out.
[1:55:19.400 --> 1:55:21.880]  We get thousands of Instagram growth,
[1:55:21.880 --> 1:55:25.280]  but when we have an event, like we have one tomorrow,
[1:55:25.280 --> 1:55:28.400]  the South tip of City Hall in Manhattan,
[1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:30.200]  on the Broadway side, you can't miss it,
[1:55:30.200 --> 1:55:32.840]  but there's always only gonna be 250,
[1:55:32.840 --> 1:55:35.280]  maybe 1,000 people, maybe 1,500.
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:37.560]  We need a million people out there
[1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:39.880]  if this is the largest city in the world, right?
[1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:42.800]  I need all the info warriors to come out
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:45.880]  to the Southern tip of Broadway tomorrow.
[1:55:45.880 --> 1:55:48.520]  Conservatives, Trumpers, anybody who hates Eric Adams,
[1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:50.240]  anybody who hates the mass,
[1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:53.400]  anybody who hates the vaccine that they were forced to take,
[1:55:53.400 --> 1:55:55.080]  the second one that they were forced to take,
[1:55:55.080 --> 1:55:58.560]  especially the boosters that are unnecessary.
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:01.560]  Yes, we're anti-vaxx and,
[1:56:01.560 --> 1:56:04.120]  because this is poison, this is killing,
[1:56:04.120 --> 1:56:07.280]  this is genocide, and we scream it to the truth,
[1:56:07.280 --> 1:56:08.280]  and that's what we do.
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:10.360]  And my group is the one that does the sit-ins
[1:56:10.360 --> 1:56:13.680]  and we go and hit up different drag queen story hours,
[1:56:13.680 --> 1:56:15.880]  and so we need eyeballs.
[1:56:15.880 --> 1:56:17.480]  Many people, info warriors were out there
[1:56:17.480 --> 1:56:21.160]  with cameras rolling because antifas is the black part.
[1:56:21.160 --> 1:56:22.000]  That's the black part of the state.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:25.400]  Hey, hey, I'm running short on time on this segment.
[1:56:25.400 --> 1:56:27.320]  You're saying specifically,
[1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:29.200]  you're saying specifically you're having an event
[1:56:29.200 --> 1:56:31.120]  in New York tomorrow.
[1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:32.840]  Yeah, tomorrow is put on by other people,
[1:56:32.840 --> 1:56:34.840]  and so it'll be about 1,000,
[1:56:34.840 --> 1:56:38.520]  but there's this convergence of a lot of things.
[1:56:38.520 --> 1:56:40.000]  But what are the details of the audience
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:40.840]  if it's in New York?
[1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:41.800]  We have a huge New York audience.
[1:56:41.800 --> 1:56:44.520]  What are the details so they can get involved?
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:47.840]  It's called, you know, DVS7 is the rapper
[1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:52.600]  who's putting it on, DVS7.0, DVS7.0, you find out.
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:54.400]  And then it's New York Freedom Rally.
[1:56:54.400 --> 1:56:58.000]  It's not really, it's like a lot of just putting
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.320]  a spotlight on cockroaches.
[1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:03.560]  And we're pouncing on Eric Adams.
[1:57:03.560 --> 1:57:06.480]  Project Veritas has just pounced on Eric Adams.
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:08.520]  We got a strike while the iron is hot.
[1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:11.760]  Where is the, where is the event and what time tomorrow?
[1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:13.520]  Southern tip of City Hall Park.
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:16.560]  It's Broadway, Broadway and Park Row.
[1:57:16.560 --> 1:57:18.120]  If New York doesn't know where City Hall is,
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:18.960]  they're gonna figure it out.
[1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:20.480]  And what time are you getting there?
[1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:23.560]  It is, I think noon or marching across the Brooklyn.
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:24.400]  All right, all right, there you go.
[1:57:24.400 --> 1:57:25.600]  All right, Bob, thank you.
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:27.200]  Folks, look, I've gotta go,
[1:57:27.200 --> 1:57:29.320]  I've gotta go handle some business.
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:30.560]  I'll be back in the next hour.
[1:57:30.560 --> 1:57:32.520]  I gotta go take care of some business real quick.
[1:57:32.520 --> 1:57:35.960]  Mike Adams is about to come in, host the first five.
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:37.960]  He's gonna be with me taking phone calls
[1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:39.440]  for the rest of this hour.
[1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:40.920]  And then he's gonna host the fourth hour
[1:57:40.920 --> 1:57:42.880]  with big breaking news, head of Pete Santilli
[1:57:42.880 --> 1:57:45.320]  on the war room with big breaking exclusiveness.
[1:57:48.480 --> 1:57:51.680]  I am extremely honored to be seen
[1:57:51.680 --> 1:57:54.640]  by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[1:57:54.640 --> 1:57:56.720]  I am blessed to know that our information
[1:57:56.720 --> 1:58:00.280]  is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:03.760]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:06.280]  They know the truth about their globalist operations
[1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:08.160]  as exposed, it's came over.
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:09.640]  And all over the planet,
[1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:13.880]  humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:58:13.880 --> 1:58:16.040]  And our main tool is free speech
[1:58:16.040 --> 1:58:18.480]  and the truth we promote using free speech.
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:20.400]  That's why when you share articles and videos

[1:59:49.600 --> 1:59:52.400]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:59:52.400 --> 1:59:56.000]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:59:56.000 --> 2:00:01.000]  You.
[2:00:10.720 --> 2:00:12.840]  A day's left, Joe Biden takes over and man,
[2:00:12.840 --> 2:00:15.600]  everybody knows they are gonna cut the economy off.
[2:00:15.600 --> 2:00:17.960]  They're gonna shut the power off, the gas off,
[2:00:17.960 --> 2:00:20.200]  they are, it's gonna be hell on earth.
[2:00:20.200 --> 2:00:29.800]  But U.S. President pushes green energy, yes, windmills, things that cost two jobs for
[2:00:29.800 --> 2:00:30.800]  every job they make.
[2:00:30.800 --> 2:00:37.640]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants, they're going to cut off the energy
[2:00:37.640 --> 2:00:45.640]  source test so it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[2:00:45.640 --> 2:00:59.160]  They're going to cut our coal power off again so no one can do business here.
[2:00:59.160 --> 2:01:04.560]  Alright welcome everybody to this third hour of the Alex Jones show here on Infowars.com.
[2:01:04.560 --> 2:01:08.760]  I'm Mike Adams and I'm going to be here for the next two hours going to be rejoined by
[2:01:08.760 --> 2:01:13.160]  Owen Schreuer coming up after this break and then I've got a special guest for the fourth
[2:01:13.160 --> 2:01:18.040]  hour today Bob Moriarty will be joining us to talk about economic collapse and I do want
[2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:22.460]  to just start out here and just give you a table of contents of what we're going to cover
[2:01:22.460 --> 2:01:27.440]  because it's bombshell, it's extraordinary and yes everything that Alex Jones talked
[2:01:27.440 --> 2:01:29.800]  about is coming true.
[2:01:29.800 --> 2:01:35.800]  Every warning is hitting us hard and it's even worse than what Alex Jones predicted.
[2:01:35.800 --> 2:01:42.400]  It's far worse because just recently the White House admitted that they are in fact a funding
[2:01:42.400 --> 2:01:49.360]  research into global dimming or what's called geoengineering using stratospheric aerosol
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:50.720]  injection.
[2:01:50.720 --> 2:01:56.560]  So the terraforming that we warned you about right here on Infowars.com and through many
[2:01:56.560 --> 2:02:01.800]  voices like myself and Dane Wiggington from Geoengineering Watch and many others all of
[2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:04.040]  that is coming true.
[2:02:04.040 --> 2:02:08.520]  It's no longer in the realm of a conspiracy theory it's a fact that's being touted by
[2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:14.080]  the White House as a way to solve the problems that they claim are facing our world.
[2:02:14.080 --> 2:02:17.520]  Well from their point of view what are the world problems?
[2:02:17.520 --> 2:02:21.600]  Too many people are still alive in their view right?
[2:02:21.600 --> 2:02:25.560]  So they're here to kill as many as possible by any means necessary.
[2:02:25.560 --> 2:02:32.720]  So today starting soon with Owen I'm going to go over in meticulous detail the terraforming
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:38.680]  operation to alter Earth's climate, to alter the atmospheric chemistry, to collapse the
[2:02:38.680 --> 2:02:45.480]  global harvest of food crops combined with a determined energy collapse and a fertilizer
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:51.000]  collapse also collapsing all three elements that make photosynthesis possible.
[2:02:51.000 --> 2:02:58.760]  In order to cause mass global famine, collapse, destitution and then either the enslavement
[2:02:58.760 --> 2:03:04.600]  or the annihilation of whatever human beings might be able to survive the starvation you're
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:09.880]  going to be targeted for extermination or enslavement one way or another.
[2:03:09.880 --> 2:03:13.200]  That is what is happening right now we have all the data points we have all the proof
[2:03:13.200 --> 2:03:17.720]  we have all the admissions and we're going to go over that today in great detail.
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:21.520]  In addition to that we're going to cover the collapse what I'm calling the collapse of
[2:03:21.520 --> 2:03:28.560]  Western civilization there is now a very real risk that Western Europe falls permanently
[2:03:28.560 --> 2:03:33.720]  and never rises again the chaos that you're seeing with the Bank of England and the collapse
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:38.560]  of the government of England right now the government of the United Kingdom.
[2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:43.280]  That is just a small sign of things to come the euro is going to collapse and the yen
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:48.640]  is going to collapse the Bank of Japan is in dire straits right now and while the dollar
[2:03:48.640 --> 2:03:53.680]  will be the last currency probably to still remain viable it's going to collapse at some
[2:03:53.680 --> 2:03:57.400]  point too although that may happen more like next year.
[2:03:57.400 --> 2:04:02.800]  But it's all coming everything that Alex Jones predicted is coming true and that's why they
[2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:10.040]  had to try to silence him so desperately because his warnings were so true and so accurate
[2:04:10.040 --> 2:04:15.280]  that they knew that he would gain massively in audience and credibility as people began
[2:04:15.280 --> 2:04:19.480]  to see reality unfold in the world around them in exactly the same way that Alex Jones
[2:04:19.480 --> 2:04:24.360]  and his other hosts and guests described here on info wars dot com you know Owen shroyer
[2:04:24.360 --> 2:04:30.560]  has nailed it as well and so many of the other guests and that the special reports and other
[2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:35.080]  personalities of alternative or independent media we've nailed it this entire time.
[2:04:35.080 --> 2:04:38.560]  So that's a little taste of what we're going to cover here in the show today stay with
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:43.240]  us I'm Mike Adams here going to be rejoined by Owen shroyer shortly right after this one

[2:06:23.160 --> 2:06:27.000]  be with him in the remainder of this hour and then folks i gotta tell you pete sandtilly
[2:06:27.000 --> 2:06:32.320]  filling in for me on the war room today has huge breaking news that could have major implications
[2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:36.160]  i mean if you want to look for hope in the news today watch the war room with pete sandtilly
[2:06:36.160 --> 2:06:40.560]  but mike adams on the line with me now we can take a couple phone calls phone lines are
[2:06:40.560 --> 2:06:45.320]  still open we got a couple callers waiting to go on uh get on here but mike um where
[2:06:45.320 --> 2:06:51.640]  where are you at today because i gotta tell you i'm i'm i'm going through some serious
[2:06:51.640 --> 2:06:57.280]  stuff intellectually trying to deal with this right now because it's like if you can't see
[2:06:57.280 --> 2:07:02.080]  what's going on at this point then is there any hope for you at all anymore maybe i maybe
[2:07:02.080 --> 2:07:06.840]  i've that's just maybe there still is hope i'm just not realizing that people can still
[2:07:06.840 --> 2:07:11.000]  wake up i guess i don't know i guess they have to have somebody die from the vaccine
[2:07:11.000 --> 2:07:14.320]  or i guess they have to have their gas shut off and their energy shut off i guess they
[2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:17.360]  have to go poor i guess they have to see empty shelves at the grocery store maybe then they'll
[2:07:17.360 --> 2:07:22.640]  get it i know that the democrats have no real shot of winning in the midterms but we know
[2:07:22.640 --> 2:07:27.200]  we're up against a massive wall of voter fraud that they're gonna be waging against us so
[2:07:27.200 --> 2:07:32.520]  i mean where is your headspace right now here 18 days till the midterms well oh and i i
[2:07:32.520 --> 2:07:37.440]  share your concern and i i believe that we are in some very desperate times and the democrats
[2:07:37.440 --> 2:07:42.360]  are capable of almost anything at this point including potentially staging an arrest of
[2:07:42.360 --> 2:07:47.760]  trump that's a possibility that still is out there we've talked about false flag possibilities
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:53.520]  they could detonate you know a nuclear weapon even on us soil or maybe one in ukraine and
[2:07:53.520 --> 2:07:58.920]  try to blame rusher for it they could carry out nuclear terrorism like with a dirty bomb
[2:07:58.920 --> 2:08:03.280]  type of event or other things you know a cyber attack grid down scenario that's blamed on
[2:08:03.280 --> 2:08:08.840]  russia and so on but they could also just arrest trump and then try to provoke an armed
[2:08:08.840 --> 2:08:14.080]  uprising in response to that so that they can paint gun owners and trump supporters as
[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:19.120]  the insurrectionists that they've tried to describe everybody as and that's why it's
[2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:25.240]  it's critical that even if trump is arrested that trump supporters maintain a posture of
[2:08:25.240 --> 2:08:31.400]  peace during all of this because a lot of these arrests a lot of these court cases they're
[2:08:31.400 --> 2:08:38.200]  going to be overturned on appeal i even believe that the the alex jones trial will be overturned
[2:08:38.200 --> 2:08:43.760]  or significantly adjusted because of the outrageousness of of the you know the the fine the one billion
[2:08:43.760 --> 2:08:49.640]  dollars roughly in addition steve bannon is of course challenging his sentence the four
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:53.040]  month sentence that has been handed down he's going to challenge that and i believe that
[2:08:53.040 --> 2:08:59.120]  will be successful as well any arrest of trump is just a a show arrest for the for theatrical
[2:08:59.120 --> 2:09:03.720]  purposes excuse me and trump will fight it and trump will beat it for all the things
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:10.040]  that they've tried to find terms of criminal evidence of trump all they can find is you
[2:09:10.040 --> 2:09:15.440]  know typos and grammatical errors and contracts that he signed years ago meanwhile they're
[2:09:15.440 --> 2:09:21.520]  ignoring hunter biden's laptop which has evidence of hundreds of crimes including business related
[2:09:21.520 --> 2:09:26.880]  crimes money movement crimes and sex related crimes as well so that's where we stand right
[2:09:26.880 --> 2:09:31.480]  now god help us pray for our safety for the next what is it little over two weeks to get
[2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:36.680]  us to november 8th yeah you bring up the bannon arrest four months today of course democrats
[2:09:36.680 --> 2:09:41.000]  celebrating they got another political prisoner honestly i mean at this point i i think you're
[2:09:41.000 --> 2:09:45.280]  probably two years out if the country doesn't just completely collapse you're probably about
[2:09:45.280 --> 2:09:49.200]  two years out from democrats just lining people up in a firing squad or scalping them and
[2:09:49.200 --> 2:09:51.960]  you know putting their their chopping their heads off and raising their heads in the sky
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:56.600]  like look we did it i mean that's seriously that's how evil they've gotten uh and and
[2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:02.280]  you know as far as i'm i'm not somebody that thinks in a war mindset i'm i'm not i'm i'm
[2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:07.760]  a peace guy i i'm a logic guy i'm an intellect guy i'm a let's talk things out guy but if
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:13.040]  i go into if i go into war mode you talk about uh the potential for trump to be arrested
[2:10:13.040 --> 2:10:17.440]  if i go into war mode i'm i actually hope he gets arrested now i've been arrested three
[2:10:17.440 --> 2:10:21.120]  times for my political speech it's not fun i've spent nights in jail i don't wish that
[2:10:21.120 --> 2:10:25.640]  upon anybody i don't wish that upon donald trump he doesn't deserve it but i'm saying
[2:10:25.640 --> 2:10:29.960]  them arresting donald trump would probably be the biggest wake-up call for the average
[2:10:29.960 --> 2:10:34.440]  american out there just how evil just how desperate just the lengths that they'll go
[2:10:34.440 --> 2:10:38.640]  to for their politics again trump is innocent he doesn't deserve to be arrested i'm not
[2:10:38.640 --> 2:10:43.200]  cheering for trump to be arrested but if i'm like how can we wake america up how can we
[2:10:43.200 --> 2:10:48.080]  get people to see how evil the democrats are i'd say please go arrest trump go arrest him
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:54.360]  right now well it would be the marlago raid on steroids if they were to arrest trump no
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:59.160]  doubt about it and and it would blow back harshly against the democrats and but understand
[2:10:59.160 --> 2:11:03.560]  though when the democrats have repeatedly miscalculated in fact they miscalculated in
[2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:10.760]  the first place about donald trump back in 2016 they really promoted him on the air thinking
[2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:15.480]  that there's no way he could win and so they put him in a position to win and then he did
[2:11:15.480 --> 2:11:21.280]  win and in fact he won a past you know far beyond the the threshold of cheating that
[2:11:21.280 --> 2:11:26.480]  the democrats were carrying out even in 2016 so the democrats have they have miscalculated
[2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:31.600]  on several fronts they've also miscalculated on how quickly they think that people will
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:38.280]  obediently go along with everything that they demand so covid they think they think the lockdown
[2:11:38.280 --> 2:11:43.440]  obedience in covid was proof that the american people are all sheeple who will do what they
[2:11:43.440 --> 2:11:47.880]  are told but the miscalculation is that people actually learned a harsh lesson from those
[2:11:47.880 --> 2:11:52.080]  lockdowns and at least half the country is in the position now with where they say no
[2:11:52.080 --> 2:11:57.400]  more we will not just blindly obey orders we will not be locked down and you've got
[2:11:57.400 --> 2:12:02.200]  state ag's and state governors now rising up against this nonsense even in in florida
[2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:06.600]  for example and the florida surgeon general is pushing back against all that nonsense
[2:12:06.600 --> 2:12:11.600]  so it's the miscalculations by the democrats that are actually creating a lot of openings
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:16.320]  and i believe this this midterm election outcome will see both the house and the senate in
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:21.120]  the hands of the g.o.p. well i hope you're right and it really is just gonna come down
[2:12:21.120 --> 2:12:26.440]  to i mean i don't know how many it's like the democrats have a handicap of what like
[2:12:26.440 --> 2:12:30.280]  maybe three four five million votes that they just know that they're gonna steal right out
[2:12:30.280 --> 2:12:36.440]  of the gates that republicans are gonna have to climb that wall of voter fraud to win but
[2:12:36.440 --> 2:12:41.040]  i mean look all the evidence is there i mean i point this out all the time if you look
[2:12:41.040 --> 2:12:47.280]  at news tv ratings all the top rated tv shows are on fox news all of them tucker carlson
[2:12:47.280 --> 2:12:54.760]  laura ingham shon hannity jesse waters all outrank with viewers every cnn msnbc abc news
[2:12:54.760 --> 2:12:59.640]  nbc news cbs news all of them fox news hosts are double triple quadruple their audience
[2:12:59.640 --> 2:13:04.840]  okay well we know how fox news audience votes i mean same thing goes to talk about rally
[2:13:04.840 --> 2:13:09.000]  turnout trump has rallies thirty forty fifty thousand at a trump rally biden has a rally
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:13.320]  he's lucky if he can get a hundred there so i mean you look at that and you say okay well
[2:13:13.320 --> 2:13:17.760]  clearly the sides on the the favor of the republicans you have the black's it black people leaving
[2:13:17.760 --> 2:13:22.360]  the democrat party the legs it latinos leaving the democrat party now you have the jegs it
[2:13:22.360 --> 2:13:27.400]  jews leaving the democrat party you had the walk away movement thousands of leftists and
[2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:31.440]  democrats leaving the democrat party you got gays against groomers saying hey look we're
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:34.760]  lgbtq but we're not gonna be controlled by the democrat party either we don't like what
[2:13:34.760 --> 2:13:39.840]  they're doing all the evidence shows the momentum goes in favor of the glp and again it's like
[2:13:39.840 --> 2:13:45.880]  okay so what happens what happens say on november ninth when the democrats take the
[2:13:45.880 --> 2:13:50.440]  house and congress and and we're supposed to sit here and take it well that's a real
[2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:55.960]  good question they may be attempting to do that and just rig it blatantly and just see
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:14:00.000]  what the american people do because i i do think that is the line in the sand i think
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:03.880]  a lot of american people have been waiting these last two years and they've been kind
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:10.760]  of holding back with their anger or frustration thinking okay okay we're gonna correct this
[2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:16.560]  in the midterms you know correct the the theft of the 2020 election the the 2000 mules and
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:20.480]  the vote rigging and all of that we're gonna correct that in the midterms well if that
[2:14:20.480 --> 2:14:26.960]  ability to democratically correct a vote theft is taken away from the american people then
[2:14:26.960 --> 2:14:32.760]  i fear that that millions of americans that that will be their breaking point and again
[2:14:32.760 --> 2:14:37.080]  i would urge people to remain calm and and you know maintain a stance of peace and all
[2:14:37.080 --> 2:14:42.600]  of this but i think the democrats may be counting on this mass uprising could be before the
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:46.760]  election with a trump arrest that they stage or even after the election with what you just
[2:14:46.760 --> 2:14:52.240]  described a massive obvious blatant election theft where they're gonna say well what are
[2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:56.360]  you gonna do about it and i mean the establishment basically saying to the people what are you
[2:14:56.360 --> 2:15:02.440]  gonna do about it and then i guess i guess we're gonna find out um what happens and
[2:15:02.440 --> 2:15:07.560]  anything could go at that point but make no mistake the authoritarian biden regime wants
[2:15:07.560 --> 2:15:14.600]  any excuse to label we the people uh criminal insurrectionists and extremists so they can
[2:15:14.600 --> 2:15:18.400]  clamp down with a form of martial law and attempt nationwide gun confiscation which
[2:15:18.400 --> 2:15:24.980]  will not go well by the way yeah they've really put us in a precarious position and unfortunately
[2:15:24.980 --> 2:15:30.120]  sadly the best shot i think at least we will see what happens in the future but the best
[2:15:30.120 --> 2:15:34.240]  shot we had to peacefully save this country was with trump as president and uh that that
[2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:37.720]  didn't happen he gave it back to the deep state to the globalist to the democrats so
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:42.760]  uh you know you're looking at a situation where i mean americans are basically just
[2:15:42.760 --> 2:15:46.760]  gonna have to go into poverty uh not be able to afford gas not be able to afford to heat
[2:15:46.760 --> 2:15:50.360]  their home uh your children are going to get sent to school and taught how to have sex
[2:15:50.360 --> 2:15:53.960]  when they're 10 years old and and and we'll see we'll see if america wants to deal with
[2:15:53.960 --> 2:15:58.640]  that for the rest of their lives or we'll see what happens once a tragedy reaches a
[2:15:58.640 --> 2:16:05.360]  level of national significance american citizens should be allowed to basically question that
[2:16:05.360 --> 2:16:10.560]  event in any way that they deemed fit the first amendment is unique in the world that's what
[2:16:10.560 --> 2:16:14.120]  they want to take away your ability to speak freely so they're going to go for michael
[2:16:14.120 --> 2:16:17.120]  indel next or they're going to go for steve bannon or they're going to go for tucker
[2:16:17.120 --> 2:16:21.640]  carlson i studied the globalist 30 years ago but only 28 years and i knew they were
[2:16:21.640 --> 2:16:25.760]  planning all of this and i warned the public as a modern paul revere but i couldn't have
[2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:29.600]  done it without your support and now because we've been so successful warning the population
[2:16:29.600 --> 2:16:33.720]  of the planet not just america we're public enemy number one when it comes to the global
[2:16:33.720 --> 2:16:37.960]  agenda that's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful info wars

[2:20:02.120 --> 2:20:04.360]  order it's alex jones
[2:20:04.360 --> 2:20:20.480]  all right folks we have breaking news right now and this is this is the indicator of where
[2:20:20.480 --> 2:20:24.520]  the democrats are going from here they're not backing down they're getting more hardcore
[2:20:24.520 --> 2:20:31.200]  the imprisonment of steve bannon the first person to be imprisoned for contempt in over
[2:20:31.200 --> 2:20:38.680]  four decades in this country steve bannon contempt of january sixth committee of course
[2:20:38.680 --> 2:20:43.440]  eric holder in contempt when him and brock obama were running guns over the southern
[2:20:43.440 --> 2:20:50.280]  border he did he got no punishment for that so we now know the democrats next move and
[2:20:50.280 --> 2:20:55.120]  mike adams and i were debating this i think we have the answer now the january sixth committee
[2:20:55.120 --> 2:21:01.120]  has just subpoenaed donald trump the subpoena of donald trump from the january sixth committee
[2:21:01.120 --> 2:21:05.280]  requesting all communications they did pretty much they just want everything they want his
[2:21:05.280 --> 2:21:09.280]  entire computer they want his emails they want his text they want to even ask for signal
[2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:14.640]  messages as well so i think we just got our answer mike they're not backing down they
[2:21:14.640 --> 2:21:21.360]  feel more they feel more emboldened than ever and if trump doesn't cooperate with subpoena
[2:21:21.360 --> 2:21:26.120]  they will arrest and jail him as well and i think that's actually what they want yep
[2:21:26.120 --> 2:21:30.280]  that's that's exactly what's coming it is remarkable that it happened here just as we
[2:21:30.280 --> 2:21:35.200]  were talking about us all that break during the break as well and it shows that they're
[2:21:35.200 --> 2:21:38.520]  going to try to do to donald trump what they did to alex jones so basically they're going
[2:21:38.520 --> 2:21:43.120]  to request all of these documents and records essentially millions of records across all
[2:21:43.120 --> 2:21:48.920]  forms of communication and media that donald trump might use including signal text messages
[2:21:48.920 --> 2:21:54.040]  you know email anything and then no matter what trump provides them even if he attempts
[2:21:54.040 --> 2:21:58.720]  to comply they will say well it's not enough just like they did to alex they'll they'll
[2:21:58.720 --> 2:22:03.040]  say oh well you didn't give us this or that something that they are imagining might exist
[2:22:03.040 --> 2:22:07.320]  that doesn't even exist and then they'll find a reason to find him in contempt and then
[2:22:07.320 --> 2:22:12.360]  to arrest him and prosecute him so we have what we're looking at here of course is a
[2:22:12.360 --> 2:22:19.520]  totally corrupt authoritarian regime massive abuses of power congressional committees were
[2:22:19.520 --> 2:22:26.240]  never intended to engage in this type of activity to carry out mass arrests especially of political
[2:22:26.240 --> 2:22:30.760]  opponents and just as you pointed out oh and when democrats are in contempt of congress
[2:22:30.760 --> 2:22:35.640]  they are never never prosecuted or arrested whether it's hillary clinton with her emails
[2:22:35.640 --> 2:22:40.760]  or eric holder as you said and remember eric holder with brock obama they were gun runners
[2:22:40.760 --> 2:22:47.240]  they ran guns they enabled gun smuggling across the border to put illegal guns into the hands
[2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:51.480]  of mexican drug cartels in order to cause violence and killings and many killings actually
[2:22:51.480 --> 2:22:56.120]  took place in the united states because of of their crimes and they were never held accountable
[2:22:56.120 --> 2:23:03.800]  whatsoever so here we go it begins so i have to agree with your analysis there trump couldn't
[2:23:03.800 --> 2:23:09.040]  be he can cooperate with this subpoena 100 percent or zero percent the result is going
[2:23:09.040 --> 2:23:13.800]  to be the same they still want him arrested they still want to get him in court and i
[2:23:13.800 --> 2:23:17.560]  gotta understand here folks there's a sick level to this too there's a real sick level
[2:23:17.560 --> 2:23:23.920]  to this now when i turned over all of my emails and texts to the january six committee and
[2:23:23.920 --> 2:23:30.040]  the fbi look you gotta understand i'm a single guy i'm 30 years old i have nothing to hide
[2:23:30.040 --> 2:23:34.600]  i'm not guilty of anything and so i said fine go through it there's nothing they're gonna
[2:23:34.600 --> 2:23:39.640]  find uh you know there i don't have there's no personal pictures of me or any you know
[2:23:39.640 --> 2:23:43.480]  anybody that i know and love or anything like that so fine read all my texts have at it
[2:23:43.480 --> 2:23:48.960]  enjoy all the emails enjoy all the spam enjoy that stuff i you know i can't even imagine
[2:23:48.960 --> 2:23:53.360]  because you're you're you're dealing with the situation now where you're not just dealing
[2:23:53.360 --> 2:23:58.680]  with political people that want to get into your phone and your emails to try to find
[2:23:58.680 --> 2:24:03.760]  anything they can to arrest you or charge you with a crime folks these sick freaks i'm not
[2:24:03.760 --> 2:24:07.520]  you think this is a joke these six these sick freaks are gonna hope they find naked pictures
[2:24:07.520 --> 2:24:12.720]  of malania trump these sick freaks are gonna hope that they find personal pictures videos
[2:24:12.720 --> 2:24:18.080]  emails on the trump family like we all have on the biden family now and if you don't think
[2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:22.920]  that that is in the back of your mind you are terribly mistaken they did the fbi panty
[2:24:22.920 --> 2:24:31.200]  rated malania trump's wardrobe these are sick perverts the fbi agent that led to fake kidnapping
[2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:37.240]  of governor whitmer went to orgies and beat his wife you you folks this is beyond just
[2:24:37.240 --> 2:24:41.720]  political they want to completely embarrass donald trump they want to get all this personal
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:48.200]  stuff they want to leak it to the public again mike you know maybe this is why i was so on
[2:24:48.200 --> 2:24:54.560]  edge all day today is somehow inside of me i knew that this was coming that we are now
[2:24:54.560 --> 2:24:59.440]  i said it at the top of the show america's probably gone through harder times the average
[2:24:59.440 --> 2:25:02.880]  americans life is still pretty good right now compares to the rest of the world probably
[2:25:02.880 --> 2:25:07.560]  still the higher standard of living maybe but our country has never been more corrupt
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:11.960]  than it is today the american people have never dealt with more corruption than we're
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:16.720]  dealing with right now and it's only getting worse well on and i don't know if this is
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:20.560]  the case that's going to cause the scenario that i'm about to describe but i can see
[2:25:20.560 --> 2:25:26.520]  a scenario where someone like governor desantis of of florida and the attorney general of
[2:25:26.520 --> 2:25:33.120]  florida and i i don't recall his name right now but where they might say that trump is
[2:25:33.120 --> 2:25:42.240]  a resident of florida and that we hereby nullify this lawless illegal politicized weaponization
[2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:49.840]  of congress against political opponents and we are going to protect donald j trump from
[2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:55.640]  this illegitimate witch hunt now i can't say if that's going to happen right now but
[2:25:55.640 --> 2:26:03.120]  i i can see that there's a nullification trend that is accelerating and at some point the
[2:26:03.120 --> 2:26:09.360]  attorney general or the governors of states including texas for example have to say to
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:17.440]  this this outlandish regime in washington dc no we we do not comply with your illegal
[2:26:17.440 --> 2:26:21.480]  demands with your abuse of power with your corruption we do not comply with it we're
[2:26:21.480 --> 2:26:26.800]  going to protect donald j trump here in florida and basically come and take it or come and
[2:26:26.800 --> 2:26:33.680]  take him in this case and then that would set off a a regional conflict between florida
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:38.080]  and the illegitimate regime in washington dc i think that day is coming it may not be
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:42.480]  on this trump issue but it's going to happen it's essentially an extension of the sanctuary
[2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:47.480]  states that were declared by democrats saying that they would nullify the authority of immigration
[2:26:47.480 --> 2:26:51.560]  services so i think you're going to see that from conservative states very soon on multiple
[2:26:51.560 --> 2:26:58.600]  issues well and if elections aren't the peaceful option to stave off this corruption that
[2:26:58.600 --> 2:27:03.320]  we're dealing with and i think that is i mean it's not necessarily secession i mean secession
[2:27:03.320 --> 2:27:08.960]  is one argument you could make but it's kind of just like a state declaration of independence
[2:27:08.960 --> 2:27:13.400]  i guess is what i would call that a state declaration of independence to say look if
[2:27:13.400 --> 2:27:19.680]  you're a resident of florida or i would pray texas if beto gets in forget it but say okay
[2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:26.520]  you're a resident of florida you're a resident of texas we do not see we do not provide there
[2:27:26.520 --> 2:27:32.000]  is no jurisdiction for any federal law enforcement here there is no jurisdiction for any dc law
[2:27:32.000 --> 2:27:38.520]  enforcement here and if you want to try to criminally prosecute or arrest anybody in my
[2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:42.680]  state you're going to have to go through our law enforcement our state law enforcement
[2:27:42.680 --> 2:27:48.920]  and our local law enforcement and we're not going to be so cooperative with these criminal
[2:27:48.920 --> 2:27:55.680]  persecutions and political arrests i mean that's that's like the second level of the
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:28:01.480]  peaceful way to stave off this corruption if elections don't succeed as the first yeah
[2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:06.880]  absolutely and i think kerry lake has spoken to some extent about a similar thing in arizona
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:11.800]  should she become governor which looks very likely at this point talked about i think
[2:28:11.800 --> 2:28:18.280]  nullifying the fbi's capabilities in arizona i believe it was her but in any case it's
[2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:23.800]  a trend across the conservative states where if you have the fbi that is really proving
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:30.480]  itself to be lackeys of the biden regime and not at all interested in actual law enforcement
[2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:35.240]  then at some point these states are going to say enough is enough you cannot operate
[2:28:35.240 --> 2:28:41.800]  your corruption regimes in our states and terrorize our people so incredible breaking
[2:28:41.800 --> 2:28:47.680]  news january six committee subpoenas donald trump same day they jail steve bannon for
[2:28:47.680 --> 2:28:52.800]  four months folks if you don't see how this corruption is being emboldened right now you're
[2:28:52.800 --> 2:29:00.840]  just blind you're just blind don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions

[2:33:00.040 --> 2:33:11.640]  lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[2:33:11.640 --> 2:33:18.320]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[2:33:18.320 --> 2:33:31.680]  the info war and now your host
[2:33:31.680 --> 2:33:37.280]  well i'm just overwhelmed at the news i'm just overwhelmed at how corrupt this country
[2:33:37.280 --> 2:33:42.120]  is i'm overwhelmed that people would support the corruption that the biden administration
[2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:47.240]  and the democrat party is engaged in but this is this is history repeating itself ladies
[2:33:47.240 --> 2:33:52.400]  and gentlemen that's all this is you can look back at any authoritarian regime and it always
[2:33:52.400 --> 2:33:57.680]  goes the same way it always goes the same way they launch false flags they blame their
[2:33:57.680 --> 2:34:03.320]  opposition they own the media they own the press they lie about their opposition and
[2:34:03.320 --> 2:34:07.180]  then ultimately there is no opposition because they killed all the opposition and then wars
[2:34:07.180 --> 2:34:11.640]  break out to deal with the evil and i just feel like that's what we're seeing play out
[2:34:11.640 --> 2:34:19.000]  right here and it's it's funny mike sitting here thinking like man i wish i wasn't in
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:23.880]  the middle of all this but i guess it's too late for that but the american people are
[2:34:23.880 --> 2:34:27.400]  going to be in the middle of all this it's not just us that are at the front lines everybody
[2:34:27.400 --> 2:34:32.200]  is going to be implicated and affected by this whether they realize it or not if you
[2:34:32.200 --> 2:34:36.440]  think that this corrupt and inept leadership is just going to result in a bunch of political
[2:34:36.440 --> 2:34:41.840]  activists and stuff being arrested and imprisoned and disappeared think again our infrastructure
[2:34:41.840 --> 2:34:45.320]  is going to collapse folks our country is going to collapse we don't have real leadership
[2:34:45.320 --> 2:34:50.240]  they're more inclined on going after their opposition than actually helping the country
[2:34:50.240 --> 2:34:54.280]  i don't think people understand that this isn't just about political persecution this
[2:34:54.280 --> 2:35:01.280]  country is going to collapse under this leadership yeah absolutely on i think the collapse really
[2:35:01.280 --> 2:35:09.000]  takes place first in europe western europe is poised for just an outrageous hellish scenario
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:14.200]  of this coming winter in terms of lack of food lack of scarcity and also a financial collapse
[2:35:14.200 --> 2:35:18.240]  that appears to be brewing across you know the bank of england the pensions there but
[2:35:18.240 --> 2:35:23.400]  also the euro currency itself now europe is going to be kind of the canary in the coal
[2:35:23.400 --> 2:35:28.480]  mine for americans because what you see in europe is coming to america as well some of
[2:35:28.480 --> 2:35:34.880]  it deliberate a lot of the takedown obviously has been happening on purpose but some of
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:40.080]  it is also just a ripple effect of bad decision making such as the economic sanctions against
[2:35:40.080 --> 2:35:46.240]  russia for example you know the the oil refineries in the gulf coast area in america they used
[2:35:46.240 --> 2:35:51.960]  to purchase oil from russia before the sanctions and they use that oil to manufacture diesel
[2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:57.720]  fuel well now we are down to an alarming low level of diesel inventory in america only
[2:35:57.720 --> 2:36:02.920]  25 days remaining of diesel in the united states now it doesn't mean it's going to be out in
[2:36:02.920 --> 2:36:08.400]  25 days because there's still more refining taking place but the the buffer is only 25
[2:36:08.400 --> 2:36:12.120]  days right now and that's the lowest it's been in i don't know 20 years or something
[2:36:12.120 --> 2:36:18.920]  like that so it's it's very concerning and that's because of the sanctions so i am anticipating
[2:36:18.920 --> 2:36:24.000]  we're gonna have blackouts in america we're going to have a starvation we're gonna have
[2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:30.520]  some grocery store shelves empty especially in early 2023 and i saw steve quail was on
[2:36:30.520 --> 2:36:34.600]  the other day talking with alex jones and i know you guys have a sponsor which is the
[2:36:34.600 --> 2:36:40.480]  satellite phone store i think it's at info wars phone dot com and i gotta tell folks
[2:36:40.480 --> 2:36:46.160]  seriously get yourself back up communications gear those satellite phones and those bivvy
[2:36:46.160 --> 2:36:52.000]  sticks which are the two-way satellite text messaging devices can save you when the grid
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:57.400]  goes down or in a hurricane and just as a disclosure that same company also sponsors
[2:36:57.400 --> 2:37:02.680]  uh... my podcast as well but the reason that we talk about them is because they are saving
[2:37:02.680 --> 2:37:08.000]  lives left and right and you know you've gotta have a backup form of communication you gotta
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:12.720]  have a backup form of money which i believe to be gold and silver you gotta have backup
[2:37:12.720 --> 2:37:17.600]  food which is storeable food and garden seeds you gotta have backup emergency medicine which
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:22.880]  includes in my view iodine and sanitizers and so on all kinds of things but for backup
[2:37:22.880 --> 2:37:28.680]  comms it's info wars phone dot com and i use those products every day i don't travel without
[2:37:28.680 --> 2:37:33.560]  those products by the way and i also gave a bunch of those to some border operators
[2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:38.740]  that are actually on the border in south texas right now they are capturing uh... human traffickers
[2:37:38.740 --> 2:37:42.520]  and weapons traffickers and they're using those sad phones they also have these push
[2:37:42.520 --> 2:37:47.760]  to talk uh... satellite walkie talkies and they are using that to keep their team safe
[2:37:47.760 --> 2:37:52.120]  while they're interdicting these uh... smugglers and traffickers that are coming across the
[2:37:52.120 --> 2:37:56.280]  border and in fact i'm gonna be doing an interview about that coming up pretty soon so the stuff
[2:37:56.280 --> 2:38:00.040]  is in the hands of people right now who are trying to keep america safe
[2:38:00.040 --> 2:38:04.360]  i mean we haven't even mentioned the wide open border and the invasion that's happening
[2:38:04.360 --> 2:38:10.080]  right now with the fentanyl coming in killing there's just a seventeen-year-old girl accidentally
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:15.240]  overdosed on fentanyl uh... i mean it's just it's unbelievable not to mention all the criminals
[2:38:15.240 --> 2:38:19.960]  that are coming in you've had more individuals on the terror watch list across the southern
[2:38:19.960 --> 2:38:26.880]  border under joe biden than every other previous administration combined uh... five million
[2:38:26.880 --> 2:38:32.040]  that we know of i mean this is just an all-out assault on the country and it's just like
[2:38:32.040 --> 2:38:38.040]  oh business is usual now the the assault is coming many forms and and i have intel from
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:43.640]  very good sources that there are uh... weapons that have been smuggled not only through the
[2:38:43.640 --> 2:38:48.960]  southern border but also from canada uh... from the north there are weapons systems
[2:38:48.960 --> 2:38:53.920]  that were acquired in ukraine and they were smuggled into canada and they've been brought
[2:38:53.920 --> 2:38:58.320]  across the border they include by the way a k forty sevens their full auto and that's
[2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:01.760]  just the small arms that are involved in this i don't want to say what else is involved
[2:39:01.760 --> 2:39:07.440]  uh... i wasn't necessarily given permission to share more details but let me tell you
[2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:11.040]  there are a lot of people in homeland security that are desperately hunting for these weapons
[2:39:11.040 --> 2:39:14.480]  systems because they can take out
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:18.400]  aircraft okay from from the ground
[2:39:18.400 --> 2:39:23.600]  there the open border problem is about to spill over into
[2:39:23.600 --> 2:39:28.240]  uh... a massive attack on america from uh... terror cells
[2:39:28.240 --> 2:39:32.560]  that are here and and by the way i can say this one one of the things that has been smuggled
[2:39:32.560 --> 2:39:34.240]  across the southern border
[2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:39.320]  are explosive vests uh... or what are called suicide vests and some of them have been engineered
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:44.400]  with radiological material so imagine this combination of kinetic explosives with some
[2:39:44.400 --> 2:39:46.800]  radiologic uh... dirty ball material
[2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:51.360]  uh... you know in combination in a vest that's already passed across the southern border
[2:39:51.360 --> 2:39:54.320]  and you can see there's going to be an activation day
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:39:58.960]  probably the day with the most chaos whatever that happens to be maybe political chaos maybe
[2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:02.560]  the day after trump is arrested who knows but there are terrorists in these case they
[2:40:02.560 --> 2:40:05.200]  are uh... recruited in afghanistan
[2:40:05.200 --> 2:40:10.560]  and they they have made their way into america and they plan to detonate across many targets
[2:40:10.560 --> 2:40:16.160]  on whatever their activation day is i don't know what day that is nobody does but it's coming
[2:40:16.160 --> 2:40:21.360]  man i'm just uh... i wish there was some good news today mike i mean i don't know is it a
[2:40:21.360 --> 2:40:27.120]  sunny day it's a sunny day here on austin's friday yeah is that count friday the sun is out i mean
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:29.920]  i got that going for me that's about it
[2:40:29.920 --> 2:40:34.160]  well the good news is that if you're watching this folks uh... you have a heads up i mean
[2:40:34.160 --> 2:40:37.760]  that's the good news is that info wars really is tomorrow's news today
[2:40:37.760 --> 2:40:42.240]  so you're you have a head start on the masses you know that the masses are going to be so far
[2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:47.040]  behind when all of this comes down because that the financial collapse is going to follow
[2:40:47.040 --> 2:40:50.800]  uh... whatever big event breaks next whether it's a dirty bomb or something else that people
[2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:55.760]  got a panic the banks can barely handle the cash withdrawal demand right now so banks are
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:40:59.840]  going to close and freeze atm's are going to shut down so you don't want to be in that group of the
[2:40:59.840 --> 2:41:03.920]  oblivious people who don't know what's coming so the fact that you are hearing this and you can
[2:41:03.920 --> 2:41:08.400]  plan accordingly and you can have your backup plans of all those categories that we're talking
[2:41:08.400 --> 2:41:14.320]  about food money medicine comms everything you're gonna be in a very good position frankly that's
[2:41:14.320 --> 2:41:19.760]  the good that's the silver lining i mean yeah things are going to get bad hellishly bad but
[2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:24.320]  you can survive it you can navigate it because of the knowledge that you're gaining right here
[2:41:24.320 --> 2:41:31.040]  on info wars dot com by the way in that vein there have been runs on gold such big runs on
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:36.320]  gold i don't know if you've noticed this individual gold buyers or even just coin collectors
[2:41:36.880 --> 2:41:43.120]  can't even get gold right now and silver silvers is wiped out uh... the the wait time on silver
[2:41:43.120 --> 2:41:47.920]  not only that i've got intel that the european silver uh... foundries that the mince that
[2:41:47.920 --> 2:41:52.240]  actually make the silver coins they're not even taking any orders for twenty twenty three because
[2:41:52.240 --> 2:41:56.800]  they can't anticipate their cost due to the one thousand percent increase in electricity takes
[2:41:56.800 --> 2:42:02.160]  a lot of energy to melt you know metals and make coins so they're not even taking orders man
[2:42:02.160 --> 2:42:07.200]  that the silver is going to be just unobtainium it's almost there right now seriously folks you
[2:42:07.200 --> 2:42:12.080]  call anybody who sells silver you ask him what's the wait time you're lucky if it's only 30 days
[2:42:12.080 --> 2:42:17.920]  it's going to be a couple months out real soon all right mike adams is set to host the fourth

[2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:04.240]  in just the last two months it's filled with articles about how bugs are good for us and how
[2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:09.040]  they're a great source of protein and just really good for you and the un says to do it but if you
[2:48:09.040 --> 2:48:14.240]  remember back in 2013 we put out a video called info wars reporter eats bug at un request
[2:48:14.240 --> 2:48:19.920]  and there you can see me chomping on a poor little grasshopper because the un told me i needed to do
[2:48:19.920 --> 2:48:28.480]  it because i'm the problem the un now says why not eat more insects yeah that's right the food
[2:48:28.480 --> 2:48:33.280]  and agriculture organization on monday held the likes of grasshoppers ants and other members of
[2:48:33.280 --> 2:48:40.160]  the insect world as an underutilized food for people livestock and pets a 200 page report
[2:48:40.160 --> 2:48:45.680]  released at a news conference at the un's agency in rome says two billion people worldwide already
[2:48:45.680 --> 2:48:49.680]  supplement their diets with insects which are high in protein minerals and have environmental
[2:48:49.680 --> 2:48:54.240]  benefits so why not give that to the western world well you know they're going to lower our
[2:48:54.240 --> 2:48:58.720]  standard of living so in a few years we are going to be wandering the fields looking for grasshoppers
[2:48:58.720 --> 2:49:04.800]  and crickets and beetles and anything to get that nutritional um sustenance that we desire
[2:49:04.800 --> 2:49:11.520]  and it's an inherent desire my dad's been to china several times and he has always made this
[2:49:11.520 --> 2:49:18.240]  observation i don't see any stray cats i don't see any squirrels in the trees i don't see any birds
[2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:23.680]  flying around the city in fact i rarely even see bugs he told me because let me tell you the
[2:49:23.680 --> 2:49:28.800]  people in china eat everything because their food is controlled by the government and when
[2:49:28.800 --> 2:49:34.560]  you have government control you always have starvation you always have scarcity of resources
[2:49:34.560 --> 2:49:38.880]  and you always have the elites being able to circumvent any type of process and they always
[2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:43.360]  get theirs that's right remember you're always the problem when it comes to the un and therefore
[2:49:43.360 --> 2:49:49.840]  eating bugs is the solution here's another video we put out in march of 2014 man buys pizza filled
[2:49:49.840 --> 2:49:54.240]  with bugs and this is something alex jones and his cousin buckley put together and they went to a
[2:49:54.240 --> 2:50:04.320]  fair folks we're going with the billworm my goodness thank you so much sir for $13 great $13 for a succulent
[2:50:04.320 --> 2:50:09.280]  so these cost more than a regular pizza yeah they're eight dollars a slice so so these are
[2:50:09.280 --> 2:50:15.840]  even more powerful thank you i do this only to prove myself four bill gates we can have more
[2:50:15.840 --> 2:50:22.400]  jets and for al gore i want to buy carbon taxes honey do you want one that is an extremist
[2:50:22.400 --> 2:50:28.080]  certainly so there that was an extremist response that young girl being horrified by eating bugs
[2:50:29.200 --> 2:50:33.440]  it's a conspiracy that women ever breastfed their children it's a conspiracy that iq's
[2:50:33.440 --> 2:50:39.440]  river above 70 it's a conspiracy that geoengineering's not a problem it's a conspiracy that vaccines
[2:50:39.440 --> 2:50:47.920]  are brain damaging you or fluoride the answer ladies and gentlemen to everything is the gmo
[2:50:47.920 --> 2:50:53.200]  no more pizza the gmo no warm pizza combining the best of bill gates gmo
[2:50:55.280 --> 2:50:57.840]  ladies and gentlemen in the name of trendiness
[2:51:01.760 --> 2:51:07.360]  delicious well let's look at these articles every one of these articles except one is from
[2:51:08.480 --> 2:51:15.920]  december or late november of this year gizmodo are insects the future of food nordic food lab
[2:51:15.920 --> 2:51:21.040]  a nonprofit culinary research institute is on a three-year effort to turn insects the creepy
[2:51:21.040 --> 2:51:26.560]  carlies that most of us squash without a second thought into tasty cravable treats have you ever
[2:51:26.560 --> 2:51:30.720]  heard of the conference insects feed the world what's a three-day conference used to promote the
[2:51:30.720 --> 2:51:36.880]  use of insects as human food and animal feed and assuring food security insects to feed the world
[2:51:36.880 --> 2:51:42.000]  is the ambitious title of this first international conference on insects and your program makes clear
[2:51:42.000 --> 2:51:48.080]  that the fledgling world insect community has big plans to make a contribution to sustainability
[2:51:48.080 --> 2:51:53.920]  of our food system and the global food supply insects are truck full of protein and essential
[2:51:53.920 --> 2:51:59.600]  micronutrients such as iron and zinc a single kilogram of feed yields 12 times more edible
[2:51:59.600 --> 2:52:06.160]  cricket protein than beef united nations food and agricultural organization FAO became interested
[2:52:06.160 --> 2:52:10.960]  in the role of insects as food security about a decade ago after documenting the significant part
[2:52:10.960 --> 2:52:16.720]  that insects play in central african diets i'm sorry you go to almost any country outside the
[2:52:16.720 --> 2:52:22.800]  u.s even mexico and they have mealworms crickets covered in different spices and stuff but people
[2:52:22.800 --> 2:52:27.840]  do eat these as protein and i'm not saying it's bad but when the u.n is telling you you have to do
[2:52:27.840 --> 2:52:32.560]  it to save the planet there's something up and it's usually not anything good for the human race
[2:52:32.560 --> 2:52:37.840]  what we really need is an internationally agreed safety framework for the use of insects we are
[2:52:37.840 --> 2:52:46.080]  are actively involved in drafting legislation on food and feed safety next article from mail
[2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:52.160]  online grasshopper crusted shrimp tacos with a side of scorpion guacamole upscale restaurants
[2:52:52.160 --> 2:52:57.280]  offering a menu that is crawling with bizarre bug delicacies and this is how they roll things out
[2:52:57.280 --> 2:53:02.000]  they bring them to upscale trendy places and say look look at the trendy people they're eating the
[2:53:02.000 --> 2:53:07.120]  bugs you need to eat the bugs now all right you're probably already eating bugs though just to let
[2:53:07.120 --> 2:53:10.880]  you know if you're eating hot dogs or any other processed food where they allow actually certain
[2:53:10.880 --> 2:53:16.080]  amounts of bugs and even rat droppings into the mixes that they make of these things there's a
[2:53:16.080 --> 2:53:20.080]  certain allowable amount so you've probably been eating all this stuff anyway but now they're gonna
[2:53:20.080 --> 2:53:26.560]  make you do it and you're gonna see it in all of its glory here's one out of man cave daily get ready
[2:53:26.560 --> 2:53:32.960]  to eat insects 50 of all television programs are now food programs and they talk about now
[2:53:32.960 --> 2:53:37.760]  all these television programs are showing people eating bugs that's the big thing the big trend
[2:53:37.760 --> 2:53:41.680]  on these things so you're gonna see it on tv then you're gonna go to the restaurant and see it
[2:53:41.680 --> 2:53:46.160]  it's the trendy areas everybody's doing it so why don't you do it too it's all part of the mind
[2:53:46.160 --> 2:53:51.120]  control that the the mainstream media likes to run on you the most dramatic faces are pulled
[2:53:51.120 --> 2:53:55.200]  when they're asked to eat insects he's talking about the people in these food programs people who
[2:53:55.200 --> 2:53:58.960]  happily eat hot dogs at home meaning they've consumed more insect and rat than sewer dwelling
[2:53:58.960 --> 2:54:04.400]  mutants but asked them to eat a bug and they react like a preschooler being asked to kiss a cockroach
[2:54:05.280 --> 2:54:09.040]  anyone's squeamish about eating insects is going to have to get over it at this moment we have
[2:54:09.040 --> 2:54:16.160]  seven billion people and in 2050 will grow until nine billion right now we know that 70 countries
[2:54:16.160 --> 2:54:21.840]  in the world are in a state of dire food insecurity and forget the luxury of vegetarianism are
[2:54:21.840 --> 2:54:26.080]  avoiding animals because your imaginary friend doesn't like them pretty soon refusing to eat
[2:54:26.080 --> 2:54:31.200]  anything will be on par with having your own castle which means it's not going to exist your
[2:54:31.200 --> 2:54:36.400]  people are going to be eating anything and everything scorpion on a stick rat on a stick
[2:54:37.280 --> 2:54:41.760]  anything on a stick they'll sell it at a fair and you'll definitely be eating it here's another one
[2:54:41.760 --> 2:54:46.560]  after the apocalypse this is what we'd eat this is actually a pretty interesting article what would
[2:54:46.560 --> 2:54:51.360]  happen if there was a catastrophic event in the world what would we be able to do well there's
[2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:56.080]  a doctor that said we can actually after we use all all our canned food stockpiles and stuff we
[2:54:56.080 --> 2:55:01.040]  can actually convert existing fossil fuels to food by growing bacteria on top of them and then we
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:05.760]  either eat the bacterial slime or feed it to rats and bugs and then eat them i guess all is not
[2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:12.320]  going to be so bad if there is an apocalypse now here's our last article from november these are
[2:55:12.320 --> 2:55:16.800]  all from december november should you be eating crickets and this talks about cricket flour this
[2:55:16.800 --> 2:55:20.880]  is a new thing people are making and they're cooking all kinds of things with it it is gluten free
[2:55:20.880 --> 2:55:25.360]  though by the way so for all you health conscious people out there might not be a bad idea to get
[2:55:25.360 --> 2:55:31.600]  into cricket flour and here's a word you're going to be hearing a lot in the future anthropo
[2:55:31.600 --> 2:55:37.600]  entomophagy the use of insects as human food the answer to feeding a growing global population in
[2:55:37.600 --> 2:55:43.040]  the world whose climate is going bonkers and just to let you know this is going trendy style jet
[2:55:43.040 --> 2:55:49.840]  blue is serving now cricket protein bars to passengers so jet blue is definitely the trendiest
[2:55:49.840 --> 2:55:54.480]  airline although i do like them because they offer you to get one bag on for free now they're
[2:55:54.480 --> 2:55:59.120]  serving cricket bars what does that mean insects are coming into the mainstream here in the united
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:03.760]  states and don't be surprised that any restaurant you go into in the next few years is going to be
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:07.600]  having and especially in 2015 it's going to be having these things on the menus now whether
[2:56:07.600 --> 2:56:12.080]  people eat them or not and whether this thing becomes a moneymaker that remains to be seen
[2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:16.640]  but one thing is for sure they are going to be pushing this on the people i had an agency within
[2:56:16.640 --> 2:56:24.880]  the us department of agriculture and our whole interest is ensuring food security for the united
[2:56:24.880 --> 2:56:29.280]  states and for the rest of the world as well and if you ever have seen the film snow piercer which
[2:56:29.280 --> 2:56:33.920]  is kind of a collectivist dream of people being stuck on a train that travels around the world in
[2:56:33.920 --> 2:56:40.000]  a giant loop these people are eating protein bars and when they finally break through to the other
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:44.480]  side and see what's behind the curtain they find the protein bars are actually made out of mashed
[2:56:44.480 --> 2:56:50.560]  up insects so it's definitely not a farfetched plant out there the un would love to see us all
[2:56:50.560 --> 2:56:55.760]  feasting on insects while they're eating beef and chicken and pork and all the other meats

[3:00:30.480 --> 3:00:37.680]  to show you a video clip from a new interview of david eich who apparently has been banned by yet
[3:00:37.680 --> 3:00:42.640]  a country and just just as some background i want to say you know david eich is someone i
[3:00:42.640 --> 3:00:48.160]  publicly apologize to because he knew the truth about what was happening with covet before i did
[3:00:48.720 --> 3:00:54.240]  it always seems to come around that david eich was right first i'm telling you and so because he's
[3:00:54.240 --> 3:00:59.200]  always correct or almost always let's say not a hundred percent but he's almost always correct
[3:00:59.200 --> 3:01:03.200]  the governments just want to ban him from even traveling to their countries so
[3:01:03.200 --> 3:01:08.160]  check out this short clip of david eich talking about how he's been banned from i believe the
[3:01:08.160 --> 3:01:17.200]  netherlands now in this case check it out bid eich dot connector video cast well you'll never guess
[3:01:17.200 --> 3:01:28.560]  another country wants to ban me i bet you're shocked i was banned from australia in 2019
[3:01:29.520 --> 3:01:38.080]  i don't mean given a visa for months and then last minute literally it was withdrawn and i'm
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:44.800]  effectively banned from germany i mean you try to get a venue there vast majority say oh no no
[3:01:44.800 --> 3:01:51.520]  and then if you do get one to agree they then get um attacked and threatened that their business is
[3:01:51.520 --> 3:02:01.280]  going to be destroyed if they have me speaking see the power of speech it's so threatening to the
[3:02:01.280 --> 3:02:08.160]  regimes that claim to hold power they cannot let a man like david eich speak so folks you
[3:02:08.160 --> 3:02:13.840]  can find that video on banned dot video i believe the title is called another country has banned me
[3:02:13.840 --> 3:02:17.200]  or countries banned me again yeah here it is another country wants to ban me
[3:02:17.840 --> 3:02:23.200]  confirming yet again that i'm right david eich dot connector video cast so be sure to check that
[3:02:23.200 --> 3:02:27.920]  out again banned dot video and i'm sure a lot of people will cross post that video to other
[3:02:27.920 --> 3:02:34.880]  platforms as well and i just want to give a shout out to david eich uh you know hey the world of
[3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:41.120]  the awakened we see the truth that you are speaking and sharing and no matter how many
[3:02:41.120 --> 3:02:46.560]  countries ban you uh they can never silence the truth because the truth is more powerful
[3:02:46.560 --> 3:02:51.600]  than all the corruption and all the evil in the world so god bless you david eich for all that
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:55.360]  you are doing and all the millions of people that you've reached over all the years and have yet
[3:02:55.360 --> 3:03:01.600]  to reach with your messages that are yet to come so uh europe of course is is desperate to keep the
[3:03:01.600 --> 3:03:07.920]  lies pumping out as long as possible because europe is facing a collapse of not just finances and not
[3:03:07.920 --> 3:03:13.840]  just its social order but i believe a collapse of its civilization and i've said it publicly western
[3:03:13.840 --> 3:03:20.480]  civilization is on the brink right now and western europe in particular may never recover
[3:03:20.480 --> 3:03:26.000]  it may not go back to normal at all there there may be nothing left i mean it may collapse into a
[3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:30.800]  third world existence did you know that in some countries right now especially in poland for example
[3:03:30.800 --> 3:03:36.480]  people are gathering trash so that they can burn trash this coming winter because they have nothing
[3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:42.080]  left to burn and so air quality restrictions have been suspended by the polish government to allow
[3:03:42.080 --> 3:03:47.280]  the people of poland to burn their trash can you imagine just chucking garbage bags into the incinerator
[3:03:47.280 --> 3:03:54.000]  or the fireplace is like wow why does the city smell like plastic and and burn polymers out because
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:59.040]  everybody's burning their trash you see all these people who failed to prepare you know and they're
[3:03:59.040 --> 3:04:04.480]  they're hoarding trash like the living rooms are going to be full of trash like what is wrong with
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:10.240]  you people these are the people who called preppers tin foil hat wearers while the preppers probably
[3:04:10.240 --> 3:04:15.440]  have a wood burning stove or something like that right some way to keep warm the non-preppers who
[3:04:15.440 --> 3:04:20.080]  dismiss all of this are going to have their living rooms overflowing with trash like an episode of
[3:04:20.800 --> 3:04:27.040]  extreme hoarders or something uh this horse poop being gathered by other europeans for them to burn
[3:04:27.040 --> 3:04:32.640]  can you imagine that your leaders destroy your country to such an extent that you're running
[3:04:32.640 --> 3:04:37.840]  around scrambling for horse poop to try to burn something to not freeze to death this coming
[3:04:37.840 --> 3:04:42.640]  winter folks that's germany for you right there that's poland that's going to be happening all
[3:04:42.640 --> 3:04:47.520]  across western europe and it's not clear how many people are going to survive this coming winter
[3:04:47.520 --> 3:04:51.120]  through the freezing and the starvation stay with us we'll be back with much more straight

[3:06:17.280 --> 3:06:21.840]  health ranger of naturalnews.com thank you for joining me we're going to be joined here in a
[3:06:21.840 --> 3:06:26.880]  minute by bob moriarty who's an extraordinary individual who's done amazing things in his life
[3:06:26.880 --> 3:06:32.720]  and continues to offer critical information for your survival in this case financial survival
[3:06:32.720 --> 3:06:38.960]  level the collapse is accelerating and and the the big convergence of all of these issues
[3:06:39.520 --> 3:06:44.480]  is about to reach a peak this is what's critical to understand folks you know you're watching
[3:06:44.480 --> 3:06:48.960]  this show you know the globalists are trying to exterminate you but did you know all the
[3:06:48.960 --> 3:06:54.000]  vectors they are using in order to do that and one of those vectors is geoengineering
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:06:58.720]  weather control systems they're also using stratospheric aerosol injection to block
[3:06:58.720 --> 3:07:04.880]  the sun in order to block photosynthesis now you may have learned this in high school biology
[3:07:04.880 --> 3:07:10.320]  photosynthesis has three inputs folks it's sunlight it's water and it's carbon from carbon
[3:07:10.320 --> 3:07:16.320]  dioxide well all three of those things are under attack by the globalists they're blocking sunlight
[3:07:16.320 --> 3:07:22.320]  because they claim they need to dim the sun in order to stop quote global warming which is a hoax
[3:07:22.320 --> 3:07:26.720]  they're blocking the rain through weather control systems and engineered droughts and
[3:07:26.720 --> 3:07:31.440]  we've had dain wiggington on to talk about that and to discuss the patents of the weather control
[3:07:31.440 --> 3:07:37.040]  systems and they're also altering the atmosphere to remove carbon dioxide from atmospheric chemistry
[3:07:37.040 --> 3:07:43.200]  through so-called carbon sequestration which denies food crops of the world access to carbon that
[3:07:43.200 --> 3:07:48.800]  they need did you know that all the food you eat is made of carbon did you know that including the
[3:07:48.800 --> 3:07:55.040]  beef from the cows and the cows eat the grass and that's all carbon all the way through because
[3:07:55.040 --> 3:07:59.520]  there's carbon chains and all the proteins obviously in all the meat that you eat without
[3:07:59.520 --> 3:08:05.120]  carbon dioxide the world collapses did you know that and the globalists are trying to eliminate
[3:08:05.120 --> 3:08:11.680]  carbon dioxide well in addition to those things going on the globalists are engaged in a dismantling
[3:08:11.680 --> 3:08:17.360]  of the financial system and that's what our guest is is about to join us to talk about this dismantling
[3:08:17.360 --> 3:08:23.600]  is a let's say a controlled demolition of the debt markets and the currencies of the world and also
[3:08:23.600 --> 3:08:30.080]  banking solvency so I want to bring on Bob Moriarty now to talk about this Mr. Moriarty sir
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:33.920]  welcome to the show it's an honor to have you on I'm a fan of your work and I can't wait to see
[3:08:33.920 --> 3:08:42.560]  what you'll share with us today well my thank you it's my honor well absolutely I know it's
[3:08:42.560 --> 3:08:47.680]  it's my honor sir you have done incredible things in your life and I can hardly give you enough credit
[3:08:47.680 --> 3:08:53.040]  but could could you just give us a background of your your aviation history some of what you did
[3:08:53.040 --> 3:08:57.520]  when you served and what you do now with your financial analysis just for people who maybe
[3:08:57.520 --> 3:09:03.040]  haven't seen you yet okay I'll try to keep this short because I've done a lot of things
[3:09:03.680 --> 3:09:10.800]  you have it's like a couple hours right there of your of your resume I joined the Marine Corps
[3:09:10.800 --> 3:09:19.600]  a week after I turned 18 and now it's a month after the Gulf of Tonkson incident and the United
[3:09:19.600 --> 3:09:25.120]  States knew they were going to go to war in Vietnam they were looking for pilots so I got in
[3:09:25.120 --> 3:09:33.760]  flight training when I was 18 years old I got my wings when I was 20 I was flying the F4 when I was
[3:09:33.760 --> 3:09:40.960]  20 I was literally the youngest fighter pilot in the world and that's not because I'm exceptional
[3:09:40.960 --> 3:09:48.880]  I just got into the program very early I went to Vietnam when I was 21 I was there for almost
[3:09:48.880 --> 3:09:58.560]  two years I flew something over 800 missions in combat and I've flown just about every
[3:09:59.120 --> 3:10:06.320]  military mission you could fly short of dropping nuclear weapons and of course that could be very
[3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:15.520]  handy here soon they may be calling me up maybe so yeah but it's extraordinary you put in you
[3:10:15.520 --> 3:10:23.280]  have more actual combat flight experience than almost any aviator not I mean to you know present
[3:10:23.280 --> 3:10:29.360]  day or throughout history it's extraordinary what you've done for our country and now you've taken
[3:10:29.360 --> 3:10:34.560]  upon yourself to warn people about what's coming financially tell us about your book your your
[3:10:34.560 --> 3:10:40.960]  website and I'll get into the questions for you please okay well I've actually written about
[3:10:40.960 --> 3:10:51.760]  10 books I wrote a book about my time in the military in 2015 Putin went to the UN and he
[3:10:51.760 --> 3:11:02.240]  spoke and he said do you realize what you have done and when he said that I I realized I really
[3:11:02.240 --> 3:11:09.680]  needed to write a book about my experience in the military and naturally if you write a book
[3:11:09.680 --> 3:11:17.120]  50 years after you are in the service you're going to have a different perspective when I was 21
[3:11:17.120 --> 3:11:26.400]  and 22 in combat I believed everything that I was told but like COVID like BLM like antifa
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:41.440]  like global warming like the Ukraine war it was all I so I fought I am not a pacifist I would fight
[3:11:41.440 --> 3:11:48.000]  again but to defend America not to attack people who are not large enemies
[3:11:50.480 --> 3:11:55.840]  and tell us about your your latest financial book I believe because I want to get into finances
[3:11:55.840 --> 3:11:59.200]  with you but I just want to keep establishing background for this this is the first time that
[3:11:59.200 --> 3:12:03.600]  you and I have actually uh been able to talk by the way for those watching like we we have never
[3:12:03.600 --> 3:12:12.880]  spoken before I mean I follow you and you follow me we just never cross paths I several financial
[3:12:12.880 --> 3:12:21.920]  books and and two of the most important one is nobody knows anything and the theme of that book
[3:12:21.920 --> 3:12:31.600]  is there's no such thing as experts or guru and when people claim guru hood they're almost always
[3:12:31.600 --> 3:12:40.800]  lying you can look at Fauci you can look at CDC the NIH uh WHO these people are supposed to be
[3:12:40.800 --> 3:12:49.840]  experts so CDC just passed a rule saying you can give the COVID vaccine to children now
[3:12:49.840 --> 3:12:57.280]  after two and a half years don't these people realize how deadly that is but the financial books
[3:12:57.280 --> 3:13:04.480]  what I'm trying to teach people is that ordinary people with the ordinary knowledge asking the
[3:13:04.480 --> 3:13:12.400]  right questions can come to the right answers uh because there are no experts and there are no
[3:13:12.400 --> 3:13:20.240]  gurus and if people would learn to think they can come to the right conclusion and and certainly
[3:13:20.240 --> 3:13:26.960]  given what we've had to happen for the last two and a half years you have to wake up there's
[3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:33.440]  tons of information available you've made it available I've made it available I was talking
[3:13:33.440 --> 3:13:40.080]  about how the vaccines would never work two and a half years ago I was talking about how Fauci
[3:13:40.080 --> 3:13:47.840]  and Bill Gates belong to prison and they do and and people should have access to that information
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:55.600]  so I've written another book called basic investing in resource stocks and what I'm trying to show is
[3:13:55.600 --> 3:14:03.600]  that if you understand what moves financial markets you have a leg up and you can in fact
[3:14:03.600 --> 3:14:10.480]  actually make money investing yeah you you talk about resource stocks and and also I want to give
[3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:16.240]  a shout out to the liberty and finance channel uh with dunnigan over there that that's where I first
[3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:21.440]  saw you bob you've done several interviews there they they do a great job but uh I want to start
[3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:26.160]  asking you now for your analysis uh now and then in in coming segments here on the show
[3:14:26.720 --> 3:14:32.960]  of just how bad do you think it's going to get here in the united states and also Europe as well
[3:14:32.960 --> 3:14:37.280]  and where where do you think you know I mean let's talk about derivatives exposure let's talk about
[3:14:37.280 --> 3:14:42.240]  a contraction of the money supply through rising interest rates in and Europe versus the united
[3:14:42.240 --> 3:14:48.240]  states and where do you want to begin in that conversation okay let me backtrack for just a
[3:14:48.240 --> 3:14:58.320]  minute because something that's going on very few people understand now Putin understands
[3:14:58.320 --> 3:15:06.560]  the death-based financial system of the west is passed itself by date the united states has had
[3:15:06.560 --> 3:15:14.320]  the world's reserve currency since 1944 and everybody gets about 80 years since the world's
[3:15:14.320 --> 3:15:21.200]  reserve currency and they eventually get so corrupt that the system has to fail but the
[3:15:21.200 --> 3:15:31.520]  financial system in the world is intertwined now and when when the the pension funds in the
[3:15:31.520 --> 3:15:37.360]  uk blow up they're also blowing up in the EU they're also blowing up in japan they're also
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:41.920]  blowing up mr. Moriarty sorry to interrupt we're about to go to break please please stand by for
[3:15:41.920 --> 3:15:45.600]  us and finish that thought on the other side of this break we're going to get into the pension
[3:15:45.600 --> 3:15:50.800]  collapse the debt collapse the currencies when we come back right after this break stay with us here
[3:15:50.800 --> 3:15:54.800]  on info wars.com this is the alex joneshow with our guest bob moriarty
[3:15:58.400 --> 3:16:06.240]  i have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist i have come from nowhere to the very
[3:16:06.240 --> 3:16:12.240]  heights of politics not just in america but the world we are engaging the globalist at point
[3:16:12.240 --> 3:16:18.320]  blank range in the information war but i don't deserve the credit yes i persevered but the
[3:16:18.320 --> 3:16:24.000]  listeners and viewers who support them for wars are the real reason we've had the success we're

[3:16:59.920 --> 3:17:07.280]  significance american citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that
[3:17:07.280 --> 3:17:11.680]  they deemed fit the first amendment is unique in the world that's what they want to take away
[3:17:11.680 --> 3:17:15.600]  your ability to speak freely so they're going to go from michael indell next or they're going to go
[3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:20.080]  for steve bannon are going to go for tucker carlson i studied the globalist 30 years ago but on their
[3:17:20.080 --> 3:17:25.200]  28 years and i knew they were planning all of this and i warned the public as a modern paul revere
[3:17:25.200 --> 3:17:29.120]  but i couldn't have done it without your support and now because we've been so successful warning
[3:17:29.120 --> 3:17:33.520]  the population of the planet not just america we're public enemy number one when it comes to

[3:20:19.680 --> 3:20:24.880]  it's mike adams you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:24.880 --> 3:20:32.400]  ask yourself this question folks where is james gordon meek
[3:20:33.280 --> 3:20:39.600]  where is james gordon meek because he is the deep dive journalist who has disappeared following
[3:20:39.600 --> 3:20:46.400]  an fbi raid and it was rumored that he was digging into not only what happened with biden's
[3:20:46.400 --> 3:20:52.480]  military withdrawal from afghanistan but also looking into money being sent to ukraine
[3:20:52.480 --> 3:21:00.160]  which some some of which was skimmed for kickbacks to democrat boat rigging operations in the united
[3:21:00.160 --> 3:21:05.760]  states such as paying off mules and overseas printing companies to print fake ballots and
[3:21:05.760 --> 3:21:11.440]  things like that that's just an unconfirmed rumor at this point but it is it does raise questions
[3:21:11.440 --> 3:21:17.360]  that we want to have answered we also want to know where mr meek is and pray for his safety let's
[3:21:17.360 --> 3:21:23.600]  hope he reemerges and is able to complete his project now getting back to our guest bob moriardy
[3:21:23.600 --> 3:21:31.840]  who is an aviator uh us marine corps aviator and also now a financial analyst and author
[3:21:31.840 --> 3:21:38.000]  he was just telling us about i believe putin's recognition that america's debt based system
[3:21:38.000 --> 3:21:43.920]  is a strategic weakness that can be exploited by russia is that is that kind of where we left off
[3:21:43.920 --> 3:21:52.240]  there mr moriardy um yes and no it's actually the debt based system of the west and that goes all
[3:21:52.240 --> 3:21:59.840]  the way back to greek and roman times where if you borrow money and you're not able to pay it back
[3:21:59.840 --> 3:22:07.680]  you lose uh what you put up against the loan now in bambelonian times and in ballastine
[3:22:07.680 --> 3:22:16.080]  uh the king realized that if he kicked the farmers off the fields because they went bankrupt
[3:22:16.080 --> 3:22:22.560]  nobody would be there to raise food so for every 50 years or so there would be a jubilee
[3:22:23.440 --> 3:22:35.520]  all money is loaned into existence so there is always more money owed than actually exists
[3:22:35.520 --> 3:22:42.560]  and periodically you have to have some kind of a reset and the reset you start all over again
[3:22:42.560 --> 3:22:48.640]  and nobody's talking about it jubilee but we're gonna have it one way or another now the world
[3:22:48.640 --> 3:22:55.360]  economic forum and the globalist the real reason they're doing what they're doing is they know the
[3:22:55.360 --> 3:23:01.600]  financial system it was on the verge of blowing up they want to take control of all the assets
[3:23:01.600 --> 3:23:10.160]  and turn the rest of us and my that's you and me we're we're useless eaters okay so by 2030
[3:23:10.720 --> 3:23:19.440]  you will own nothing you will owe nothing and you'll be happy and that's in their book and
[3:23:19.440 --> 3:23:27.280]  that they say that very clearly but that's also the definition of slavery so what's happened is
[3:23:27.280 --> 3:23:35.760]  the western-based financial system is past its sell-by date the chinese and the russians
[3:23:35.760 --> 3:23:43.680]  certainly understand this and the part of the reason putin went into ukraine is he's trying to
[3:23:43.680 --> 3:23:54.880]  institute a new resource-based financial system that's not based around debt now he's talking about
[3:23:54.880 --> 3:24:00.560]  multiple currencies and multiple commodities and i know exactly what it's going to do is
[3:24:00.560 --> 3:24:06.560]  going to end up going to gold because that's what they've done every time in the last 5000 years
[3:24:06.560 --> 3:24:14.640]  now i'm not saying they're going to gold because it's the best solution they're going to go to
[3:24:14.640 --> 3:24:21.120]  gold because it's the only solution now let's go to the uk because that's what's been on
[3:24:21.120 --> 3:24:30.080]  everybody's mind lately as of december 31st last year uh bonds their highest-rated
[3:24:30.080 --> 3:24:40.000]  yields are down 52.3 percent and of course the pension funds are overloaded with these bonds
[3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:48.800]  the theory being that the bonds are safe but the pension funds have been using derivatives
[3:24:48.800 --> 3:25:01.280]  something called ldi to magnify the return on their bonds and it all blew up uh the the
[3:25:01.280 --> 3:25:09.280]  british pound was about two dollars a dozen years ago and it got down to 103 ten days ago
[3:25:11.440 --> 3:25:17.520]  what nobody's talking about is that the japanese pension fund is in worse shape
[3:25:17.520 --> 3:25:24.640]  the pension funds in the eu are just as bad as the uk and the pension funds in the united
[3:25:24.640 --> 3:25:30.960]  states are a disaster too we are mr moriarty would you say that these pension funds are already
[3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:35.200]  mathematically over the tipping point it's just a matter of how they unravel at this point
[3:25:36.400 --> 3:25:43.840]  correct absolutely so what kind of timescale are we looking at for that i mean the uk government
[3:25:43.840 --> 3:25:48.720]  is in chaos right now just because of the lis trust fiasco and all of that but uh i mean they
[3:25:48.720 --> 3:25:53.680]  are they are financially insolvent in the pension system and if the pensioners don't get paid i mean
[3:25:53.680 --> 3:25:58.960]  that's that's going to be civil unrest on top of all the other causes what what kind of timeline
[3:25:58.960 --> 3:26:05.680]  do you think is likely to unfold uh that's a really good question i was about to answer that
[3:26:05.680 --> 3:26:16.000]  and it's one day or one week or one month or a few months okay but that's it it's very very very
[3:26:16.000 --> 3:26:23.920]  very close the banks are exceptionally nervous now they're sitting on resources they don't want
[3:26:23.920 --> 3:26:33.120]  loaned each other uh have you ever been to niagra have you seen the niagra ever before those are
[3:26:33.120 --> 3:26:44.640]  false like no i have you you've got three pieces of the miag miag river and there are signs saying
[3:26:44.640 --> 3:26:51.040]  do not go past this point because if you're in the river and you go past the point you're
[3:26:51.040 --> 3:26:58.400]  going to go over the edge no we're past the point okay this is no longer a theory this is happening
[3:26:58.400 --> 3:27:05.520]  right now and just because people don't recognize it doesn't mean it's not happening it is happening
[3:27:05.520 --> 3:27:13.280]  and everything the governments are doing is beyond stupid the the germany had the ability
[3:27:13.920 --> 3:27:22.320]  up until about two weeks ago to end the fuel crisis in europe all they had to do is turn
[3:27:22.320 --> 3:27:29.360]  Nord Stream to us and then the united states attacked Nord Stream 2 and took out three or
[3:27:29.360 --> 3:27:36.640]  four pipelines but they're still back in the same situation um i i went to the hardware store today
[3:27:36.640 --> 3:27:44.480]  to pick up a chicken a chicken being a really good idea to have right now and they have raised the
[3:27:44.480 --> 3:27:56.560]  price of wood pellets from 3.85 euros to 10 euros in one year i i use kerosene stoves
[3:27:57.200 --> 3:28:09.600]  and a 20 liter bottle of kerosene was 24 years a year ago and an eight liter container is now 24
[3:28:09.600 --> 3:28:17.360]  euros uh are you living are you living in europe yeah i live south of france uh i also didn't realize
[3:28:17.360 --> 3:28:26.400]  that fascinating yeah uh my my wife was british and we saw what was coming a long time ago and said
[3:28:26.400 --> 3:28:33.840]  we need to get away from grant zero i am literally afraid of the united states now the the level of
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:41.520]  crime and the level of corruption is so high that it's a very dangerous country okay stay

[3:33:26.800 --> 3:33:30.480]  all right mike adams here continuing with bob moriarty and i want you to understand
[3:33:30.480 --> 3:33:37.440]  the magnitude of what he is saying this is a man who i have admired and listened to for quite some
[3:33:37.440 --> 3:33:44.160]  time he is a man with incredible courage and achievement who fought for america he put in
[3:33:44.160 --> 3:33:51.120]  more actual airtime combat flight hours and missions than almost anybody you could think of
[3:33:51.120 --> 3:33:58.240]  who's living today or even back then he has gone through a tremendous amount to fight for america
[3:33:58.240 --> 3:34:05.680]  and yet today as he just told us he's living in the south of france and he he is saying that america
[3:34:05.680 --> 3:34:11.120]  looks to be very dangerous and yet what we're seeing today in america the chaos and the violence
[3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:16.560]  and the collapse is is only scratching the surface of what is yet to come so we're going to go back
[3:34:16.560 --> 3:34:24.640]  to mr bob moriarty again i mr moriarty i'm just i'm so i'm truly in awe about your life experience
[3:34:24.640 --> 3:34:30.400]  and that you have all of this courage no i'm serious uh that to to bring keep bringing it
[3:34:30.400 --> 3:34:36.160]  to us today where you could have just retired and sat back and and done nothing but here you are
[3:34:36.160 --> 3:34:40.640]  still trying to save the lives of americans right now so thank you sir for all that you've done
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:34:49.760]  well mike you know this to be true if you have the ability to communicate a solution
[3:34:49.760 --> 3:34:59.760]  and you've got an obligation to okay and the idea that we just sit and vote every two years or every
[3:34:59.760 --> 3:35:07.280]  four years and that's the limit of our participation that's absolutely incorrect americans have to
[3:35:07.280 --> 3:35:16.960]  start taking responsibility for themselves there is evil in the world uh putin gave a speech here
[3:35:16.960 --> 3:35:26.880]  recently and he was talking about satanic not in terms of religion but he recognized there is absolute
[3:35:26.880 --> 3:35:36.480]  evil going on the world economic forum is the evil bill gates is evil george soros is evil
[3:35:36.480 --> 3:35:43.600]  the devil's crowd it's evil now we know this this isn't some gee i've got a wild hair up my
[3:35:43.600 --> 3:35:49.280]  ass i'll just make this up it's not true these people are evil and what they're trying to do
[3:35:49.920 --> 3:35:57.440]  is mass murder and the whole point of blowing up the financial system which is absolutely deliberate
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:05.360]  is to avoid being blamed for what they've done now i'm in europe and i'll be absolutely candid
[3:36:05.360 --> 3:36:12.800]  this year it's going to be really rough in terms of the economy in terms of businesses
[3:36:12.800 --> 3:36:22.800]  shutting down inflation and and the availability of fertilizer food and fuel next year it's going
[3:36:22.800 --> 3:36:31.840]  to be a total disaster you are not overstating that if europe continues on the path that they're on
[3:36:31.840 --> 3:36:42.080]  they're going to be a third world shithole well um mr moriarty we got to we got to bleep that out but
[3:36:42.080 --> 3:36:48.880]  uh for for broadcast but i we certainly understand exactly what you're saying um we're looking at a
[3:36:48.880 --> 3:36:54.800]  70 plus percent shutdown of industrial metals and smelting operations across europe something like
[3:36:54.800 --> 3:36:59.440]  a 70 percent shutdown in ammonia production which affects fertilizer production i mean
[3:36:59.440 --> 3:37:04.880]  we're we're looking at aren't we the the deindustrialization of europe starting with germany but not
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:11.360]  limited to germany you know you just said a third world bleephole is kind of where this is going
[3:37:11.360 --> 3:37:17.280]  and yet there seems to be no leadership in any european country that is willing to take the
[3:37:17.280 --> 3:37:22.160]  reins and try to turn this thing around because there's actually plenty of energy in europe
[3:37:22.160 --> 3:37:29.280]  they just won't tap into it they want their people to suffer yeah you're absolutely correct
[3:37:29.280 --> 3:37:37.920]  and i would have thought by now with 27 countries in the eu leadership would start floating to the
[3:37:37.920 --> 3:37:48.000]  top but with the exception of hungary and a little bit in idly uh there isn't any leadership i'm
[3:37:48.000 --> 3:37:56.640]  i'm absolutely devastated by the idea that the germans would destroy their own economy the entire
[3:37:56.640 --> 3:38:05.280]  eu the europe the european union rests on the foundation of having a successful germany and
[3:38:05.280 --> 3:38:12.640]  germany is going to shut down now there are riots and there are protests all over europe now
[3:38:12.640 --> 3:38:19.600]  you're not seeing an impress in the west but it's true and and this year it's going to be
[3:38:19.600 --> 3:38:26.880]  catastrophic and if they don't turn north string too on next year there will be no food okay it's
[3:38:26.880 --> 3:38:33.120]  going to be bad this year next year will be no food well that's that's so i want to ask you that
[3:38:33.120 --> 3:38:38.080]  because uh we've seen there are protests in france uh happening lately and uh in other
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:43.520]  countries as well as you just mentioned but since you're living certainly not close to the big cities
[3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:50.240]  but what are you seeing locally in terms of uh uh frustration or planning among the locals in france
[3:38:50.240 --> 3:38:59.680]  who who do see what's coming um that's a good question because again there's next to no reporting
[3:38:59.680 --> 3:39:08.560]  about this outside of france but the two biggest refineries in northern france went on strike
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:19.600]  and they were demanding a 15 increase in wages the refineries to the south of france had done
[3:39:19.600 --> 3:39:29.600]  the same thing now and about 30 of the gas stations in france are out of one or more kinds of fuel
[3:39:29.600 --> 3:39:36.400]  and these things are catastrophic and it's only going to get worse and you're absolutely correct
[3:39:36.400 --> 3:39:43.600]  this is something europe has done to itself france used to be a major producer of natural gas and then
[3:39:43.600 --> 3:39:49.040]  the greens took over and said well gee we don't want fracking fracking well you've got a simple
[3:39:49.040 --> 3:39:55.200]  choice you either produce energy or you buy it from somebody who's got it so they're not buying it
[3:39:55.200 --> 3:40:00.720]  from germ or they're not buying it from russia because america forced sanctions down their
[3:40:00.720 --> 3:40:06.720]  throat but that's suicide well the green policies have been absolutely catastrophic for europe and
[3:40:06.720 --> 3:40:12.000]  also for america as well but you know i'm starting to see echoes of srilanka here because one of
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:17.040]  the things that took down srilanka was the fact that farmers could not get fuel to transport their
[3:40:17.040 --> 3:40:22.880]  crops to markets and so crops rotted in the fields so you just mentioned there's a lack of fuel
[3:40:23.600 --> 3:40:28.160]  in in france and that's what some of the protests are all about but even in the united states i'm
[3:40:28.160 --> 3:40:33.760]  sure you've seen this the mississippi river is so low that the barges can't navigate the river
[3:40:33.760 --> 3:40:40.640]  and so there are literal hills of beans and crops sitting on the shores of the mississippi
[3:40:40.640 --> 3:40:46.320]  molding and rotting because you can't navigate the river and according to sources that i've
[3:40:46.320 --> 3:40:51.680]  interviewed such as dane wiggington that's a weather control systems a deliberate drought in
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:58.160]  order to shut down the food ecosystem and even the transportation arteries that that transport
[3:40:58.160 --> 3:41:04.320]  those food systems across united states and folks by the way one tugboat with 15 barges
[3:41:04.320 --> 3:41:09.920]  replaces a thousand long haul trucks on the highways okay so you can't just say oh we're
[3:41:09.920 --> 3:41:15.360]  loaded on the trucks there aren't enough trucks to move all that stuff they just don't exist period
[3:41:15.360 --> 3:41:22.000]  your thoughts mr morgan hardy well there's actually not enough diesel for the trucks if you didn't
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:29.040]  have the trucks that's true this this has been going on literally since the world economic
[3:41:29.040 --> 3:41:39.600]  forum started i think in 1971 and what's important to recognize is that the davos crown totally
[3:41:39.600 --> 3:41:46.480]  unelected the rich the powerful the beautiful have gotten together and said we should rule
[3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:56.240]  the world and nothing is debated they're just doing things covet was a perfect example how many
[3:41:56.240 --> 3:42:05.600]  tens of thousands of doctors had to close their eyes to what was going on some of the top doctors
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:11.760]  in the world were saying two and a half years ago this is very dangerous this is something
[3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:19.120]  the united states created there are simple solutions to it and you guys are taking a solution that's
[3:42:19.120 --> 3:42:26.480]  deadly and the cdc coming out this week and saying they're gonna get shots to the two kids
[3:42:26.480 --> 3:42:33.200]  unreal yeah that's a crime against nature that's a war crime and i hope those bastards uh are on
[3:42:33.200 --> 3:42:40.800]  trial one day well uh cdc i i say cdc stands for child death cult that's what the cdc has become
[3:42:40.800 --> 3:42:47.280]  and and this so-called immunization is a ritualistic sacrifice of children like malik uh in the old

[3:47:21.120 --> 3:47:25.600]  okay we are joined again in this final segment today fourth hour of the alex jones
[3:47:25.600 --> 3:47:32.080]  joined by bob moriarty who's uh again i just i think he's just such an awesome guy he's like
[3:47:32.080 --> 3:47:38.000]  sometimes people say i mean oh oh you're a pilot because i trained to fly uh cessnas well this guy
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:44.640]  flew at fours okay i mean there's no comparison so uh we're you know us us little cessna pilots
[3:47:44.640 --> 3:47:50.240]  are nothing compared to what he did and while getting shot at over vietnam as well but uh
[3:47:50.240 --> 3:47:54.160]  he's never want to back down from danger or from telling the truth and he continues with us here
[3:47:54.160 --> 3:47:59.120]  mr bob moriarty um mr moriarty we haven't given out your website yet do you have a website you
[3:47:59.120 --> 3:48:02.480]  want to share with our audience here where they can find i don't know your book or other things
[3:48:03.680 --> 3:48:12.320]  yeah certainly it's three two one gold dot com and if they go to amazon they could find my books
[3:48:12.320 --> 3:48:17.760]  and and if you're a cessna pilot i'll take something you're gonna enjoy one of the things you
[3:48:17.760 --> 3:48:30.400]  probably don't know is i delivered 243 cessnas and pipers and beach all over the world right i i've
[3:48:30.400 --> 3:48:37.200]  got about 10 000 hours flying small planes over the ocean and don't even ask me if that's rational
[3:48:38.320 --> 3:48:43.360]  why yeah why am i not surprised to hear that yeah and i i bet some of those were night flights too
[3:48:43.360 --> 3:48:51.680]  for some reason just just guessing um in any case mr moriarty let's let's talk about america for this
[3:48:51.680 --> 3:48:55.520]  segment here because uh you already mentioned that you have a lot of concern about what's
[3:48:55.520 --> 3:49:02.400]  going to happen domestically uh civil unrest and so on you and i both know that the let's say 95
[3:49:02.400 --> 3:49:07.840]  percent or more of the population of america they are completely oblivious to what is happening
[3:49:07.840 --> 3:49:12.320]  happening what is taking shape economically and financially and what's actually coming
[3:49:12.320 --> 3:49:18.240]  so i want to ask you sir what what do you think america will look like especially in the cities
[3:49:18.240 --> 3:49:23.680]  whenever this bank freeze or this cascade of derivatives debt collapses or pensions collapse
[3:49:23.680 --> 3:49:28.560]  whatever whatever big thing happens whenever it is what is america going to look like in your opinion
[3:49:28.560 --> 3:49:42.240]  we are three meals away from total chaos we have seen in the past what happened when uh
[3:49:42.240 --> 3:49:50.400]  so security couldn't get payments out on time and and literally people were starving and rioting
[3:49:50.400 --> 3:49:58.880]  the united states it's simply not prepared now the soviet union and soviet bloc countries
[3:49:58.880 --> 3:50:07.120]  their entire economy collapsed in a period of a few months but they were prepared for it and
[3:50:07.120 --> 3:50:14.240]  it's incumbent on americans one take some responsibility for your own life if you're
[3:50:14.240 --> 3:50:20.640]  depending on thema or the local government or the state government or the federal government
[3:50:20.640 --> 3:50:28.240]  they are not going to protect you you need to have access to food you need to have some cash
[3:50:28.240 --> 3:50:36.800]  you may need to have some weapons but you must be prepared these cities are going to be exceptionally
[3:50:36.800 --> 3:50:44.960]  dangerous now i've been watching uh some of the clips okay that info wars has about the riots
[3:50:44.960 --> 3:50:50.880]  and blm and antifa it's going to be worse than that it's going to be far worse than that and
[3:50:50.880 --> 3:50:56.320]  i'm not saying that's because i'm trying to scare people i'm saying that's because i'm trying to
[3:50:56.320 --> 3:51:04.960]  wake people up take some responsibility for your own life well how can people do that what i mean
[3:51:04.960 --> 3:51:12.400]  obviously you you are an advocate of gold as a you know saving assets out of the risky financial
[3:51:12.400 --> 3:51:17.280]  system the fiat currencies and so on but uh what else can people do aside from looking at precious
[3:51:17.280 --> 3:51:25.520]  metals well um literally the Mormons believe that you should keep a year's food and since you're
[3:51:25.520 --> 3:51:35.600]  going to eat the food anyway keeping a year's food it's not a bad idea it's a good idea okay we are
[3:51:35.600 --> 3:51:42.240]  going to have cash you need to have cash you need to have food you need to keep your your car fuel
[3:51:42.240 --> 3:51:50.800]  you need to talk to your children okay the banking system is going to fail the credit card system
[3:51:50.800 --> 3:51:58.720]  is going to fail and you need to sit and think about it and say what do i do to protect my family
[3:51:58.720 --> 3:52:06.080]  my children my neighborhood because that time is not only coming it's coming very very quickly
[3:52:07.120 --> 3:52:11.840]  well those systems fail that you just mentioned that means also the snap system the food stamp
[3:52:11.840 --> 3:52:18.640]  system is going to fail and so that's 40 what is it now 47 million americans will find that they can
[3:52:18.640 --> 3:52:24.880]  no longer purchase food through a government program that they have been living on and uh
[3:52:24.880 --> 3:52:32.000]  doesn't that mean basically riots and looting erupting everywhere i mean almost in every city in america
[3:52:33.280 --> 3:52:40.080]  we've already got that look at california look at san francisco look at los angeles people are
[3:52:40.080 --> 3:52:49.680]  suffering yeah they're living on the edge right now but it's going to get a hundred times worse
[3:52:49.680 --> 3:52:56.000]  than that and you either prepare now while you still can or you're going to get eaten up
[3:52:57.760 --> 3:53:04.560]  now but you're living in europe and surely you're going to see riots in france you're going to see
[3:53:04.560 --> 3:53:11.840]  riots in the uk in germany and perhaps in italy and other places as well so can you share with us
[3:53:11.840 --> 3:53:17.600]  a little what i mean what's what's your plan to survive what's coming there there's no safe place
[3:53:17.600 --> 3:53:26.880]  right now in in the western world that's for sure mike there are relatively safe places i live in a
[3:53:26.880 --> 3:53:35.440]  little tiny house in a little tiny village with 190 people in it in a farming community
[3:53:35.440 --> 3:53:42.160]  that's never too hot never too cold i've got a stream running right underneath my house so i'm
[3:53:42.160 --> 3:53:50.240]  putting in a run of river generator it's going to be bad everyone's going to get hurt and it's only
[3:53:50.240 --> 3:53:57.600]  a degree of relative safety but if you're living in a big city like boston or cleveland or chicago
[3:53:58.560 --> 3:54:06.320]  though those are going to turn really ugly well you have a really good video bandwidth for someone
[3:54:06.320 --> 3:54:12.160]  living in rural france in a small village by the way is a good job on getting the bandwidth going
[3:54:12.160 --> 3:54:17.120]  i've seen a lot worse connections here in the united states it turns out but but you're right
[3:54:17.120 --> 3:54:22.080]  you got to choose where you're going to be when it all comes down because where you are matters
[3:54:22.080 --> 3:54:26.960]  tremendously it's like uh you know jill scowes and talking about strategic relocation where do you
[3:54:26.960 --> 3:54:32.000]  want to be when it all comes down time is running out i'm in taxes we see people coming here from
[3:54:32.000 --> 3:54:37.120]  all over the country uh from california of course in other places and and they're mostly saying
[3:54:37.120 --> 3:54:41.440]  just don't want to be in california when the collapse comes they see it people are seeing it
[3:54:41.440 --> 3:54:53.120]  absolutely but understand people have alternatives now and the time is it's coming very shortly
[3:54:53.120 --> 3:54:59.760]  they're not going to have those alternatives at its time to prepare i i'm not talking about this
[3:54:59.760 --> 3:55:07.280]  is happening five or ten or twenty years from now it's happening tomorrow or next week right a
[3:55:07.280 --> 3:55:13.360]  matter of days or weeks or maybe maybe a few months at at the most um the the debt-based
[3:55:13.360 --> 3:55:18.800]  financial system uh of course there it's coming down what do you think they're going to try to
[3:55:18.800 --> 3:55:23.280]  do the the central banks to try to replace that system you think they're going to give us a strong
[3:55:23.280 --> 3:55:30.320]  push into a digital currency system or attempt to do that they're they're going to try to and
[3:55:30.320 --> 3:55:36.480]  they're going to fail what's really important to understand if if you want to see what they're
[3:55:36.480 --> 3:55:42.000]  going to do over the next six months to a year take a look and see what they've done over the last
[3:55:42.000 --> 3:55:50.160]  five to ten years and it's like the american participation in afghanistan name any period
[3:55:50.160 --> 3:55:59.200]  of the war that wasn't marked with abject stupidity the same thing with the fed the fed the fed has
[3:55:59.200 --> 3:56:06.160]  created this monster this isn't something they're going to fix those people are too stupid to tie
[3:56:06.160 --> 3:56:15.680]  shoes okay they have to wear loafers um and i i want to keep going this americans have to rely
[3:56:15.680 --> 3:56:24.320]  on themselves these systems are broken we've got a 79 year old who is senile okay as president of
[3:56:24.320 --> 3:56:30.000]  the united states and everybody wants to pretend he's not the village idiot well he is a village
[3:56:30.000 --> 3:56:35.200]  idiot you can look at him you can listen to him and you know and look who we've got it was vice
[3:56:35.200 --> 3:56:41.680]  president okay she got into her position because her sex and her color and look at the number
[3:56:41.680 --> 3:56:49.280]  three uh nancy polosi and nancy polosi was part of the group taking the money from ukraine that
[3:56:49.280 --> 3:56:55.520]  five billion dollars the united states paid for the coup d'etat much of that went to jill biden
[3:56:55.520 --> 3:57:02.400]  and to nancy polosi well i i think you're right and when western civilization collapses i think
[3:57:02.400 --> 3:57:07.040]  historians will look back and say well how could they not collapse look at the incompetence and
[3:57:07.040 --> 3:57:13.680]  stupidity of all the leaders some of whom you just named but also the leaders of you know england
[3:57:13.680 --> 3:57:20.160]  and germany and and some even even france and so on so uh mr moriarty thank you for joining me today

[3:58:55.200 --> 3:59:01.200]  heights of politics not just in america but the world we are engaging the globalist at point
