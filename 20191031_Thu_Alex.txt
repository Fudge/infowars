[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:31.460]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:31.460 --> 00:43.620]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:43.620 --> 00:53.860]  It's October 31, 2019, the high holy day of Satanists, Druids, worshipers of the dark Lord.
[00:53.860 --> 01:13.220]  And just minutes ago, the Democratic Party, servants of the anti-human New World Order, voted 232 to 196 along party lines to improve and approve impeachment roadmap of President Trump.
[01:13.220 --> 01:25.940]  They have officially initiated impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States, and they are making their move right now.
[01:25.940 --> 01:34.020]  We're going to have open phones and guests today. We're going to be laying all of this out for you.
[01:34.020 --> 01:50.980]  Now, we also have some very serious reports about the Caribbean and the fact that there is ongoing cover-up of Ebola that has reportedly made it into the Caribbean.
[01:50.980 --> 02:04.420]  It also made it into Texas, and it made it into New York, if you remember, six years ago, and got covered up. But it was confirmed that those individuals did have Ebola.
[02:04.420 --> 02:11.140]  We're taking it to the CDC main centers in Atlanta, Georgia. That is now in the news today.
[02:11.140 --> 02:29.460]  Alert Ebola outbreak feared in Bahamas. As nation put on high alert, we, of course, exclusively reported on tens of thousands of individuals coming out of the Congo earlier this year into San Antonio, Texas, Houston, Texas, and Austin, Texas.
[02:29.460 --> 02:37.060]  Unvetted, unchecked for any diseases when they were having the biggest Ebola outbreak in history that is still ongoing.
[02:37.060 --> 02:49.940]  Our camera people, including Owen Schreuer, were physically assaulted by effeminate white males that were leading the operation.
[02:49.940 --> 02:55.060]  These people were illegally brought into the United States, but they are above the law.
[02:55.060 --> 03:04.340]  Also, I knew what I would find last night when we saw it. I knew the media would spin it. We were live on air. I went live till past midnight last night.
[03:04.340 --> 03:09.620]  Special emergency report on impending initiation of impeachment today.
[03:09.620 --> 03:15.860]  We're going to play those clips when we come back from break of what just happened minutes ago.
[03:15.860 --> 03:23.460]  And Rob Dew was in the run in the show and he said, look at this Twitter account of a man that dresses as a woman
[03:23.460 --> 03:29.620]  and look at how they're simulating human sacrifice of a baby and cutting it out of a woman, helter skelter style.
[03:29.620 --> 03:35.940]  Charlie Manson style, which is one of the highest level satanic rituals.
[03:35.940 --> 03:39.860]  And then drinking the blood of the baby live, which is what they simulate.
[03:39.860 --> 03:46.580]  Like at Bohemian Grove, they simulate the sacrifice of a child as above so below that's called lesser magic.
[03:46.580 --> 03:50.740]  Well, I knew what I'd find when we went to the Instagram of this individual.
[03:50.740 --> 03:59.220]  Devil worship and vampirism. This is not on Halloween trying to be shocking, simulating cutting a baby out of his womb.
[03:59.220 --> 04:05.140]  This is all about blasphemy.
[04:05.140 --> 04:10.260]  And these people embrace Satan and they have the lowest life expectancy, the highest level of suicide.
[04:10.260 --> 04:14.420]  And they say it's because we're not giving them access to our children.
[04:14.420 --> 04:17.540]  These are the people and I bet you money. We're digging into it.
[04:17.540 --> 04:23.300]  This individual has been at drag queen story time. You know they have, you know they have.
[04:23.300 --> 04:27.060]  We're digging into it right now. We know this individual is a supporter of that.
[04:27.060 --> 04:32.020]  And this is extremely graphic. We're going to show you what's really graphic when we come back.
[04:32.020 --> 04:37.220]  Giant machete attacks all over Europe, warning viewer discretion is advised.
[04:37.220 --> 04:45.220]  When you import central Africans directly out of the jungle, you are going to get the jungle.
[04:45.220 --> 04:51.620]  We're going to be laying all of that out here today as well as the controlled takedown of civilization
[04:51.620 --> 04:56.820]  and the interdimensional assault of the alien invasion. That's what that is right there.
[04:56.820 --> 05:02.500]  That's a transmission accelerates. We're on planet earth in the middle of the space.
[05:02.500 --> 05:08.100]  This is a assault. The planet is under interdimensional demonic attack.
[05:08.100 --> 05:12.740]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[05:12.740 --> 05:17.620]  I don't care what your views are. I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[05:17.620 --> 05:22.580]  That's important. But we have something in common. We have a set of values that are at the core of
[05:22.580 --> 05:27.940]  this country that hold this place together. Clinton deep state bag man, Comey thinks it's
[05:27.940 --> 05:33.460]  funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to Congress in the world. He thinks committing crimes
[05:33.460 --> 05:38.980]  are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted. The word is the criminal
[05:38.980 --> 05:43.860]  investigation is honing in on him. From my new home in New Zealand I will...
[05:43.860 --> 05:52.900]  Oh and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand. Not so fast criminal. We're going to
[05:52.900 --> 05:57.380]  bring you to justice and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well because if we don't
[05:57.380 --> 06:02.500]  you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy. But the American people know how
[06:02.500 --> 06:16.180]  much you hate us and we're fighting back at infowars.com, newswars.com, and band.video.
[06:16.180 --> 06:22.820]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[06:22.820 --> 06:39.220]  front lines of the info war. It is Thursday October 31st 2019 and the Democrats have this
[06:39.220 --> 06:48.180]  all planned out initiate the official impeachment proceedings initiate the official impeachment
[06:48.180 --> 06:58.660]  procedures then have their kangaroo pretrial in the House of Representatives and vote before
[06:58.660 --> 07:04.740]  Thanksgiving to attack the Christian holiday and then have the trial in the Senate in December
[07:04.740 --> 07:12.740]  and remove the president as a Christmas present to piss on Christ. That is exactly the plan
[07:12.740 --> 07:19.460]  as we told you months ago and everybody said oh Trump is invincible nothing's going to happen
[07:20.740 --> 07:26.660]  but you notice suddenly all these big Republicans are saying it's time to censor
[07:26.660 --> 07:31.780]  conservatives and the internet. Gorka is coming out they're all coming out they're lining up to
[07:31.780 --> 07:36.820]  be good little boys and girls so they can stay at least for now on Facebook and Twitter.
[07:36.820 --> 07:43.620]  Now that Twitter announced yesterday that they're banning political advertising that means
[07:43.620 --> 07:48.660]  conservative advertising and then all the thousands of leftist propaganda channels
[07:49.220 --> 07:56.180]  those will be called news so conservatives won't be able to pay money to counter lies
[07:57.540 --> 08:01.700]  even though there's federal laws that TV and radio stations and other media have to take ads
[08:01.700 --> 08:07.460]  of their publishers by all the candidates as long as they don't violate obscenity laws.
[08:10.180 --> 08:19.060]  So last year it's Alex Jones this year it's the NRA and now it's the speech of Republican candidates
[08:20.820 --> 08:24.500]  but is it 40-something House member Republicans have already resigned the last few years they're
[08:24.500 --> 08:31.700]  blackmailing them they're pulling out all the stops and the average conservative looks and says
[08:31.700 --> 08:36.260]  Trump's done nothing wrong they'll never get it done in the Senate.
[08:39.220 --> 08:44.580]  Once the impeachment gets going the next month they're going to start having women come forward
[08:44.580 --> 08:48.900]  and say Trump raped them they're going to pull Kavanaugh they're going to have more fake whistle
[08:48.900 --> 08:56.100]  blowers come out and there's just going to be a crescendo and then riots and you're going to
[08:56.100 --> 09:09.220]  see the full push they will probably fail if everyone is maximal 100% engaged in the third
[09:09.220 --> 09:14.980]  dimension on the streets at church at work getting the word out calling talk radio calling C-SPAN
[09:14.980 --> 09:20.100]  calling Congress going to DC going to their offices letting them have a piece of your mind
[09:20.100 --> 09:25.460]  that means your congressman your congresswoman your senator and the opposition people but
[09:25.460 --> 09:31.380]  also people in swing states folks you better not just pick up the telephone and send an email do
[09:31.380 --> 09:43.540]  that too every day you better get on an airplane. Our forebears fought a six-year war almost seven
[09:43.540 --> 09:47.460]  year war with their bare hands it's an empire never been defeated.
[09:50.660 --> 09:55.460]  They gave up their families their names their treasures their lives many of them.
[09:57.620 --> 10:04.020]  Well if we don't get off the bench and get in the game and I know this audience is activist
[10:04.020 --> 10:09.620]  I'm just saluting you but if others don't we're going to face a really hard road now
[10:09.620 --> 10:15.700]  you notice Hillary has come out through her surrogates and said she's running Bill has come
[10:15.700 --> 10:20.500]  out and said I know she's running for something she's about to amount we're going to play that
[10:20.500 --> 10:29.140]  clip for you next segment. And they just need to keep her out because she's so unpopular until
[10:30.100 --> 10:37.060]  Trump's removed and then she emerges to run against whatever Republicans are left that
[10:37.060 --> 10:44.100]  have already signed on to be paid off. You're like well that's unpopular that's crazy well we've
[10:44.100 --> 10:50.580]  put up with everything they've done so far the censorship the attacks on the family convicted
[10:50.580 --> 10:54.580]  pedophiles going in and fondling kids in front of us at public schools on television.
[10:56.660 --> 11:04.580]  So we've green lit this and no one's been officially indicted even though we know that's
[11:04.580 --> 11:11.940]  going on and there's criminal investigations but it's a day late a dollar short unless Trump pulls
[11:11.940 --> 11:21.780]  the political triggers now. But the swamp is made of a bunch of social climbers and cowards yes men
[11:21.780 --> 11:26.900]  and women and so even if some people are inclined to not hate the country and want to stand up to
[11:26.900 --> 11:36.420]  evil they just don't have the metal that it takes to survive. Because obviously if you have any
[11:36.420 --> 11:42.660]  discernment fighting this is our only hope but these people think playing it safe got them where
[11:42.660 --> 11:49.940]  they are but not in the final in game not in the final stages. And it's all a total quickening.
[11:49.940 --> 11:59.700]  We obsess over the whole drag queen movement because they're not drag queens they're demonic
[11:59.700 --> 12:10.180]  priests dressed in satanic regalia. That's what Satan has put war paint on a lot of the sex a
[12:10.180 --> 12:15.860]  lot of the subgroups and that's what they do that's what Hollywood shows you demon clowns that kill
[12:15.860 --> 12:21.060]  children and now they're everywhere simulating this we're going to play it coming up and then you
[12:21.060 --> 12:24.660]  go to the sites of these people and they're like we are Satanists we are devil worshipers
[12:24.660 --> 12:29.540]  and they even dress up as devils now and come to the schools and just terrorize the children.
[12:29.540 --> 12:36.900]  It's meant to terrorize them it is a demonic visitation visitation we're getting words now
[12:36.900 --> 12:44.420]  visitation. Now Ebola outbreak feared in Bahamas is nation put on high alert that's mainstream news
[12:44.420 --> 12:50.260]  we'll tell you about that coming up we've got the footage of folks pouring in out of the Congo
[12:50.260 --> 12:55.540]  with the biggest Ebola outbreak ever not just to the Caribbean nations but into the United States
[12:55.540 --> 13:02.500]  and Texas predominantly and when there's Ebola outbreaks they just cover it up that's all coming
[13:02.500 --> 13:08.900]  up but it's all part of the attempted takedown total warfare against the United States and Trump's
[13:08.900 --> 13:13.540]  a great champion fighting this and he wants to not panic people at the same time trying to resist
[13:13.540 --> 13:17.460]  it and he has gone after the pedophile rings and they're you know he's doing a great job
[13:17.460 --> 13:25.860]  in fronts but he just doesn't have the people in the political class 90% of the DC ruling system
[13:25.860 --> 13:35.940]  is a bunch of lawyers and they're in their own little cult and they are basically the last thing
[13:35.940 --> 13:41.380]  the civilization is going to see will be their squawking and hopping and trying to manage things
[13:41.380 --> 13:49.300]  as civilization unravels let's go out to break with the end of the impeachment vote that just
[13:49.300 --> 13:54.580]  happened 30 minutes ago and then Pelosi up there with a big American flag going we're doing this
[13:54.580 --> 14:03.140]  because it's America and it's about we the people no Nancy it's about the globalists the chai comms
[14:03.140 --> 14:09.060]  saying no to the people and screwing the nation over no borders no wall no USA at all and you
[14:09.060 --> 14:14.980]  know that but you're up there like a like a old lady that's having a bake sale you know for the
[14:14.980 --> 14:25.220]  disabled kids it's for America and you like us here it is again there you go with the votes

[14:36.900 --> 14:45.940]  motion to reconsider is laid upon the table i want to begin my remarks by some of the most
[14:45.940 --> 14:52.500]  beautiful words in our country's history our country look we the people of the united states
[14:52.500 --> 14:58.100]  in order to form a more perfect union there's the american flag oh she loves that domestic

[15:11.380 --> 15:16.580]  anybody it's not in the wiki least that's their main mission no she wants to bring the nation together
[15:17.860 --> 15:22.180]  by having a secret kangaroo court that coached all the fake witnesses and all the evidence and
[15:22.180 --> 15:26.340]  transcripts show it's not true and then they're all leftist hacks that openly work for brennan
[15:26.340 --> 15:31.380]  and clapper and obama and hillary and then they get them all trained in a star chamber and then
[15:31.380 --> 15:37.140]  they're going to march them out for hearings in the next month in the next three weeks and then
[15:37.140 --> 15:42.340]  right before thanksgiving they're going to have an impeachment vote just like they did today

[21:17.860 --> 21:22.340]  that they accelerated the plan to remove him from office no matter how dangerous it was
[21:22.340 --> 21:27.860]  and i began to tell people several months ago that this impeachment was real
[21:29.380 --> 21:36.420]  and that Pelosi would end up initiating a vote in the house to commence official impeachment
[21:36.420 --> 21:43.220]  proceedings and once they start the investigation they're not going to exonerate the president
[21:44.740 --> 21:52.100]  and once they vote in the house the articles of impeachment it goes to trial in the senate
[21:52.100 --> 22:00.420]  they are going to pull out the stops like you've never seen but the fake conservative media
[22:00.420 --> 22:08.100]  is going to tell you because they're controlled that oh Pelosi isn't really gonna do it oh look
[22:08.100 --> 22:13.540]  notice she didn't bring up the full vote yet oh it's all a bluff she knows yeah that she doesn't
[22:13.540 --> 22:18.500]  have the votes oh they'll never get him in the senate anyways impeachment's helping trump
[22:19.460 --> 22:26.740]  that's to make everybody think everything's okay and then matt drudge shows you what they're doing
[22:26.740 --> 22:33.860]  and what they're saying so that conservatives get out of their bubbles and wake up and stop this
[22:34.500 --> 22:41.380]  and so trump wakes the hell up and takes action for all our hides because they get him man
[22:43.060 --> 22:45.060]  and people are like what the hell's drudge doing
[22:48.100 --> 22:52.740]  because the average conservative site or news show everybody wants to hear positive news
[22:52.740 --> 22:59.380]  that everything's okay well i don't want them to win and come after our families even more
[22:59.380 --> 23:04.100]  and our guns and wreck this country even more my god they're in the process of gutting it completely
[23:04.100 --> 23:14.180]  right now i don't want to live in la la land and i told you a month ago when everybody was just
[23:14.180 --> 23:22.340]  down sky high oh alex they're not gonna initiate official impeachment proceedings and i said the
[23:22.340 --> 23:31.220]  hell they aren't they're not having kangaroo courts and secret events and putting out totally
[23:31.220 --> 23:37.380]  fake information and getting caught and not stopping for no reason you can see it you can feel it
[23:37.380 --> 23:45.940]  we're at war and if you don't have chills running up and down your spine understand these people
[23:45.940 --> 23:51.300]  are bad news and they get full control you either better get ready to fight or haul ash

[24:05.300 --> 24:07.460]  and get your head screwed on straight
[24:10.420 --> 24:16.740]  now let me tell you one of the keys to this i have been watching gorka and bannon
[24:17.380 --> 24:22.740]  and turning point usa and all these sycophants at the top of those groups
[24:24.420 --> 24:32.660]  and they have been kissing ass to facebook and twitter and the left and making ceremonial bows
[24:32.660 --> 24:34.580]  now obviously
[24:37.140 --> 24:41.380]  it's agreed upon so i don't see who and it's done through lawyers but they've come to me with the
[24:41.380 --> 24:46.740]  same you better run the white flag up and it's okay you know we'll let you you know we'll let you
[24:46.740 --> 24:53.460]  live that's like in uh you study history but you use an allegory of fiction of the road warrior
[24:53.460 --> 25:02.580]  when humongous is saying just leave us with the pump and leave us with the tanks and the
[25:02.580 --> 25:09.380]  refinery and you can go your way just give us that big fat tank of gas and we spare your lives
[25:10.820 --> 25:16.340]  humongous is a reasonable man why we can negotiate with him yeah go ahead and try to negotiate with
[25:16.340 --> 25:19.380]  people a thousand times worse than the fictional humongous
[25:19.380 --> 25:21.380]  yes

[25:32.100 --> 25:38.100]  i mean these people are not gonna give you quarter they have climbed out of the pit of hell
[25:38.100 --> 25:44.340]  this is the great fabled move on america this is as important as world war two or more to our nation
[25:44.340 --> 25:47.940]  because we knew our enemy was back then
[25:50.660 --> 25:57.380]  now we have an enemy within and hillary is directing all of this and she got sucker punched
[25:57.380 --> 26:03.220]  by the landslide for trump and they are making their move right now
[26:05.620 --> 26:08.260]  and she's up there like a prom mom

[35:34.420 --> 35:43.780]  going to be getting to let me get back to the impeachment folks think at least some people
[35:44.420 --> 35:49.620]  that if you talk about how serious the deep state is and how serious the democrats are
[35:50.820 --> 35:58.500]  in impeaching the president that you're helping them no they have a plan they had a plan with
[35:58.500 --> 36:03.780]  cabernon but because of a lot of activists and researchers going through each woman that accused
[36:03.780 --> 36:09.700]  them folks were able to find out their criminal records they were blackmailed and then they would
[36:09.700 --> 36:14.420]  later admit they had been told a lie or they would be exposed for crimes they'd committed
[36:15.620 --> 36:19.140]  the deep state goes through databases of any women at colleges or high schools
[36:19.620 --> 36:24.900]  that people like cabernon went to they then contact women that are secretly prostitutes
[36:24.900 --> 36:27.780]  women that are secretly drug dealers women that have criminal records
[36:27.780 --> 36:33.140]  women that have had their children taken by cps and gotten them back this has come out in the news
[36:34.020 --> 36:38.100]  and the women have gone public said i'm not going to do this i got a call and was told they would
[36:38.100 --> 36:44.900]  expose what i do for a living if i didn't say that cabernon raped me i've never met cabernon it's not
[36:44.900 --> 36:51.540]  true now they had what eight women accused him at least four have come out and said
[36:51.540 --> 36:55.940]  they were threatened that it wasn't true others admitted they lied and won't say why
[36:55.940 --> 37:01.860]  why malazze ford is a deep state cia recruiter on record it's a complete joke
[37:04.660 --> 37:09.940]  now they failed but they barely failed and because they didn't get in trouble
[37:11.540 --> 37:20.820]  for what they did they're going to do it to the next person that trump nominates and
[37:20.820 --> 37:28.100]  then 95 of people die within 10 months of pancreatic cancer
[37:28.100 --> 37:34.100]  ruth better ginsberg has had a lot of cancer a lot of past problems most numbers actuaries are
[37:34.100 --> 37:40.580]  with what she's got you live maximum four months she should be dead by next week if you go by
[37:40.580 --> 37:50.900]  average she should be dead already really now they're going to make a run at everybody trump's
[37:50.900 --> 37:56.980]  gotten in hundreds over 200 high level federal judges hundreds more about to be confirmed
[37:57.860 --> 38:02.740]  they're going to make a run at the two supreme court individually put in they're not going to give
[38:02.740 --> 38:12.740]  up once they get rid of trump all hell is going to break loose and the deep state's already
[38:12.740 --> 38:17.540]  buttering up pence articles but he had a good week trump had a bad week so hoping pence is
[38:17.540 --> 38:22.580]  dumb enough to think if he goes along with trump being removed he's got that type wrecking vote in
[38:22.580 --> 38:34.500]  the senate and they need the two thirds but he couldn't be that one that pushes him over
[38:37.460 --> 38:42.900]  that they'll let him be president that is not going to happen just like the sun comes up in
[38:42.900 --> 38:51.300]  the morning and sets in the evening Hillary Clinton thinks she's going to run and thinks
[38:51.300 --> 38:57.940]  she's going to win now she's got a book out about how she's touching if she's coming to

[40:13.940 --> 40:21.380]  two months ago a week ago yesterday they're not going to initiate an official impeachment
[40:23.540 --> 40:27.620]  proceeding like with a time bomb when you set the timer and hit the button it's going
[40:28.900 --> 40:29.780]  it's in motion
[40:33.940 --> 40:40.820]  they're not going to trigger that domino unless they intend to pass the vote for impeachment now
[40:40.820 --> 40:45.540]  and then have the pony trial the kangaroo event in the senate
[40:51.620 --> 40:52.340]  and now it's here
[40:55.860 --> 41:01.060]  so we better start talking about what we're going to do to stop it and i got to tell you
[41:01.860 --> 41:07.780]  trump by not being able to get the indictments public and to not be able to get the justice
[41:07.780 --> 41:14.020]  department say action it is emboldened these snakes and they're imperiling this country the economy
[41:14.020 --> 41:19.780]  the whole world this this this country is like a giant doomsday bomb ticking down for the whole
[41:19.780 --> 41:26.100]  world this is a global crisis because the chai comms and everybody else want the country wrecked
[41:26.100 --> 41:28.900]  they don't care either way as long as it destabilizes the nation
[41:28.900 --> 41:39.460]  and everybody better start whistle blowing on the deep state everybody better start putting
[41:39.460 --> 41:44.420]  pressure on the establishment i mean you got a neighbor that's a u.s senator or congressperson
[41:45.540 --> 41:50.100]  don't go over threaten them like a democrat does you go over and let them know real sternly
[41:50.100 --> 42:00.500]  how the cabbage ate the cow and understand these people are coming for you and your family
[42:01.460 --> 42:07.780]  and really do some thinking about that and decide whether you're going to be a spectator
[42:07.780 --> 42:11.780]  or whether you're going to be on the field and whether you're going to just shoot your mouth off
[42:12.660 --> 42:17.060]  about hell well if it ever gets bad and i ever see you in troops i'll do something
[42:17.060 --> 42:23.780]  and ladies and gentlemen this country's fighting for its life right now and we need peaceful focused
[42:23.780 --> 42:31.860]  but aggressive sustained truth information warfare at the enemy and i'm gonna say this again
[42:34.340 --> 42:39.060]  do you understand how critical it is that twitter announced no political advertising
[42:39.060 --> 42:44.740]  starting tomorrow that means the democrats and their thousands of channels of propaganda won't
[42:44.740 --> 42:50.900]  be called political advertising the republican party's being silenced right now for what is
[42:50.900 --> 42:56.980]  about to take place and it's going to happen at facebook everywhere else they're making their move
[42:57.780 --> 43:02.180]  and you see all these republican lapdogs rolling over and showing their bellies right now

[43:12.260 --> 43:16.580]  i don't care what your views are i hope you articulate them and defend them and listen
[43:16.580 --> 43:20.820]  and debate them that's important but we have something in common we have a set of values
[43:20.820 --> 43:25.780]  that are at the core of this country that hold this place together clinton deep state bag man

[47:59.620 --> 48:06.020]  school district to request sexual orientation of kindergarten students diversity data soon
[48:06.020 --> 48:15.700]  collected on four-year-olds that's a dan lineman article at news wars dot com it goes right to the
[48:15.700 --> 48:23.300]  cbc government canadian broadcasting system where they say it's aimed at understanding diversity
[48:23.300 --> 48:31.060]  four-year-olds will be asked if uh they are one of 50 sexual orientations or genders that's to
[48:31.060 --> 48:36.260]  teach them the mental illness that's what that is can you imagine four-year-olds being victimized by
[48:36.260 --> 48:44.740]  the brainwashing my god this is just so heinous and absolutely over the top and then meanwhile
[48:44.740 --> 48:53.060]  don't worry uh it's going on in texas as well and we went to try to cover it as you noticed on
[48:53.060 --> 49:00.260]  monday a big fat man in a blonde red wig began attacking and screaming had to be arrested going
[49:00.260 --> 49:06.980]  i'm dying i'm a black trans don't kill me i need access to children and to understand that's how it
[49:06.980 --> 49:12.260]  is for those folks the access to children is it's just like i've got to have them and please
[49:12.900 --> 49:16.900]  and and that's one of the beginning stages it gets a lot lot worse for these folks once they get
[49:16.900 --> 49:24.180]  fully taken over by uh whatever these things are from the color out of space continuing
[49:24.180 --> 49:29.860]  ladies and gentlemen um this video is up on info wars dot com
[49:32.260 --> 49:36.260]  there's an editor's note on this paul joseph watson article i guess he doesn't want to get arrested
[49:36.260 --> 49:44.900]  over in england for saying this thing uh is not a woman looks like something out of hellraiser
[49:44.900 --> 49:48.980]  video drag queen they all look like demon clowns but oh that's a drag queen it's all
[49:48.980 --> 49:53.860]  lies than lies it's not a woman it's a man it's not even a man dressed up like a woman it's a man
[49:53.860 --> 50:00.340]  dressed up like a demon because they are demons so video man dressed as a demon who says he's a
[50:00.340 --> 50:06.900]  vampire on his own website simulates cutting baby out of his artificial womb and drinking
[50:06.900 --> 50:12.580]  his blood with pleasure and reveling in the satanic sacrifice there's my editor's note
[50:13.860 --> 50:21.620]  from alice shones this is not a this is a man dressed up as a psychotic demon woman
[50:21.620 --> 50:27.700]  from a hellraiser movie engaged in his sick twisted fantasies that stem from the delirium
[50:27.700 --> 50:35.700]  fueled by a declining plunging society now we're going to play this footage
[50:38.180 --> 50:43.300]  and this is what charlie manson had done to share and tate who was heavily into the occult we
[50:43.300 --> 50:49.460]  should add and you see how that ended for her when her baby she was eight months pregnant was cut
[50:49.460 --> 50:55.620]  out of her womb and of course she was tied up they showed it to her first to get extra goodies
[50:55.620 --> 51:04.260]  and extra harm before they drank her blood and that's what they do to get the fear and the essence
[51:04.260 --> 51:11.300]  out of it the adrenal chrome is also in the blood not just when you eat the glands and so people
[51:11.300 --> 51:15.380]  when we showed this last night well that's probably just performance art yes just performance art
[51:15.380 --> 51:21.780]  uh when you go to this individual blare backs instagram which we can put on screen for folks
[51:22.820 --> 51:23.940]  you will notice
[51:27.380 --> 51:27.620]  here
[51:32.020 --> 51:32.980]  that when we scroll down
[51:35.860 --> 51:41.220]  you will notice that this is an ongoing fun thing that happens and it's all occultic and
[51:41.220 --> 51:47.460]  vampiric and and that's what this man does and it's ongoing in the sinister twisted sickening
[51:47.460 --> 51:52.180]  bars that they do this and when you watch the video now there's some drag queen story time right
[51:52.180 --> 51:59.300]  there of course we knew that would be there when you see all of this macabre and this you know these
[51:59.300 --> 52:06.260]  demon outfits that they're all wearing you have to understand this is the religion this is the
[52:06.260 --> 52:12.740]  rollout it's not enough to defile themselves they want to defile everyone else and they want access
[52:13.540 --> 52:22.660]  to your children and if you watch the video at the bar everyone is celebrating it in a ritual
[52:23.860 --> 52:28.100]  and they have women there that are that are you know trying to give power under this and this is
[52:28.100 --> 52:34.180]  all just occultist doing a ritual which again is a simulated murder of a baby out of the womb
[52:34.180 --> 52:38.740]  of the drinking of the blood and then when you look at the demonic sickening ugly face of this man
[52:38.740 --> 52:44.500]  in the but the big leering clown mouth remember this is just coming to your drag queen story time
[52:45.620 --> 52:50.260]  and you see poor desmond is amazing at the pito bars dancing when he's 10 11 years old
[52:50.900 --> 52:56.340]  and being handled by convicted murderers and satanists and talking about how he likes to
[52:56.340 --> 53:04.500]  take rohibinol and other drugs here let's back this up and play this with audio if we can let's
[53:04.500 --> 53:10.020]  go ahead and roll uh this video for everybody this is this is what they're assaulting us with
[53:10.020 --> 53:14.260]  this is who they are as i've been telling you these aren't men dressed as women these are the
[53:14.260 --> 53:22.260]  cultist dressed as demon clowns that is satanic regalia getting access to your children in rituals
[53:22.260 --> 53:30.020]  to mark them and to horrify them and to do it in front of you that is a form of ritual here it is
[53:32.980 --> 53:36.740]  a disgusting man stabbing into the fake belly
[53:39.300 --> 53:46.100]  and getting the baby out and drinking the blood playing with the placenta
[53:46.100 --> 53:52.900]  uh celebrating it and it's all about defiling women defiling children and then and it's saying
[53:52.900 --> 53:58.100]  sick gross men are women and then women are supposed to celebrate that a good masculine
[53:58.100 --> 54:03.620]  man that loves you and takes care of you he's bad but if you're an ugly sickening devil worshiper
[54:03.620 --> 54:11.780]  doing filthy sick things and an hbo promoting having sex with bugs raping earthworms uh
[54:11.780 --> 54:16.260]  that now there's articles up on dreads report dot com about the left now making blood sausage and
[54:16.260 --> 54:23.060]  rituals and eating blood sausage this is what happens every society when they collapse it's why
[54:23.060 --> 54:27.220]  society's become very conservative after they've been through this and we're about to go through a
[54:27.220 --> 54:35.060]  full assault by these individuals so put a bunch of sick fake placenta and all the rest of this
[54:35.060 --> 54:39.540]  to just make women look as ugly and gross and childbirth is ugly and gross you have all the left
[54:39.540 --> 54:46.740]  celebrating abortion celebrating child sacrifice saying it's a sacrifice i've played those reports

[55:05.540 --> 55:12.260]  they're all dressed up for drag queen story time so we let men dressed as demons have access to
[55:12.260 --> 55:18.260]  children in many public schools they don't tell you when they come in after your children and now
[55:18.260 --> 55:23.860]  in canada they're going to tell four-year-olds that they're one of 50 sexual genders and when
[55:23.860 --> 55:29.380]  your child says okay i'm a unicorn okay i'm a girl but he's a boy they'll be taken canada's
[55:29.380 --> 55:33.860]  already doing it and they'll be put in a government home and then at age seven their penis and testicles
[55:33.860 --> 55:37.940]  will be cut off in the satanic mutilation and everyone will praise it and worship it because
[55:37.940 --> 55:42.100]  it's mass Stockholm syndrome it's so evil the average person can't believe the state's doing
[55:42.100 --> 55:46.900]  this so they have to say oh it must be good and then they've got you in the society collapses
[55:48.020 --> 55:53.140]  that is the psychological warfare plan now i'm going to get into all of this the impeachment

[1:01:01.540 --> 1:01:07.620]  moronic love affair with totalitarianism will inevitably foist upon these spoiled anti-american
[1:01:07.620 --> 1:01:14.420]  generations is the harvesting of their own organs they will be chosen based on their beliefs which
[1:01:14.420 --> 1:01:20.740]  will no longer be protected under totalitarianism similar to the plight of the peace loving buddhist
[1:01:20.740 --> 1:01:26.820]  faloon gong in china who are having their organs removed while they're alive because they won't
[1:01:26.820 --> 1:01:33.940]  accept atheism the china organ harvest research center data from 2007 reveals that hospitals
[1:01:33.940 --> 1:01:43.940]  charged more than 65 000 for a kidney 130 000 for a liver and more than 150 000 for a lung or a heart
[1:01:43.940 --> 1:01:51.220]  researchers insist the pseudo voluntary organ donation system in asia has a turnover of 60 000
[1:01:51.220 --> 1:01:59.220]  to 100 000 transplants annually the practice is alleged to have started in the 1990s it was initially
[1:01:59.220 --> 1:02:05.060]  targeted to forcibly remove the organs of prisoners on death row china later claim that
[1:02:05.060 --> 1:02:10.580]  death row prisoners consented to donate their organs to the state to redeem themselves for
[1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:16.020]  the crimes they had committed against the state a practice china claimed to have stopped in january
[1:02:16.020 --> 1:02:24.580]  2015 juan jefu has been facing heavy criticism in australia to his supporters he's a pioneering
[1:02:24.580 --> 1:02:30.260]  liver transplant surgeon to his detractors he was responsible for running china's organ
[1:02:30.260 --> 1:02:37.300]  transplant system for more than a decade a system that's relied almost exclusively on organs taken
[1:02:37.300 --> 1:02:44.100]  from executed prisoners in a rare press briefing dr huang spoke to a small group of journalists
[1:02:44.100 --> 1:02:50.820]  to respond to his critics saying chinese prisoners must agree to have their organs harvested before
[1:02:50.820 --> 1:02:57.380]  they die concept is a lot of presuming concept concept written concept the explosion of organ
[1:02:57.380 --> 1:03:04.020]  transplant activities in china from 2000 together with reports of thousands of transplant tourists
[1:03:04.020 --> 1:03:10.260]  going to china to purchase organs suggests a larger supply of organs than could be sourced from
[1:03:10.260 --> 1:03:16.980]  executed criminals alone according to the tribunal the scales of the chinese transplant industry
[1:03:16.980 --> 1:03:22.020]  together with other evidence points to the possibility that china is involved in forced
[1:03:22.020 --> 1:03:28.340]  organ harvesting and selling for profit organs from prisoners of conscience fowling gong is a
[1:03:28.340 --> 1:03:35.140]  form of chinese meditation and exercise with a spiritual underpinning since 1999 the chinese
[1:03:35.140 --> 1:03:39.700]  government has cracked down on fowling gong charging it with being an unregistered religion
[1:03:39.700 --> 1:03:45.940]  and cult that aims to subvert the state the seven person china tribunal panel which was initiated
[1:03:45.940 --> 1:03:51.940]  by the international coalition to end transplant abuse in china delivered its final findings in
[1:03:51.940 --> 1:04:00.500]  june for over a decade the people's republic of china has publicly accused of acts of cruelty
[1:04:01.140 --> 1:04:08.500]  and wickedness that matched the cruelty and wickedness of many evil torturers and execution
[1:04:10.340 --> 1:04:16.820]  it stated with certainty that in china forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience
[1:04:16.820 --> 1:04:22.820]  has been practiced for a substantial period of time so maybe that poll should be adjusted instead
[1:04:22.820 --> 1:04:28.260]  we should just cut to the chase and say that seven out of ten american millennials will likely
[1:04:28.260 --> 1:04:33.700]  have their organs harvested while they're alive on average 22 people die every day in the united
[1:04:33.700 --> 1:04:39.780]  states waiting for a transplant the median wait time for a lung here is four months a heart almost
[1:04:39.780 --> 1:04:45.940]  a year and a kidney two years transplant tourists understandably have been drawn to other countries
[1:04:45.940 --> 1:04:52.500]  by promises of little to no weight but look on the bright side us tourism will skyrocket as the
[1:04:52.500 --> 1:04:59.700]  world health care system caches in in capitalist style to acquire one of those freshly harvested

[1:06:40.740 --> 1:06:51.300]  31 2019 thursday transmission and i'm sure that as listeners you probably want to respond with the
[1:06:51.300 --> 1:07:01.540]  house of representatives by a very large majority voting today to initiate official
[1:07:01.540 --> 1:07:08.660]  impeachment proceedings against the president boy i saw a lot of celebrating last month when
[1:07:08.660 --> 1:07:15.780]  uh Pelosi wasn't officially having the hearings they did that so they weren't real hearings
[1:07:16.420 --> 1:07:20.660]  so they could drill and prepare and prep in secret
[1:07:22.740 --> 1:07:27.860]  brennan and clapper and comey and obama and hillary's protoge these are all literal adjuncts
[1:07:27.860 --> 1:07:35.300]  to those deep staters now they're going to take the training wheels off and have the show trial
[1:07:35.300 --> 1:07:42.900]  for the indictment but they're already bringing forward the fake facts they produced and their
[1:07:42.900 --> 1:07:49.860]  kangaroo operation and then they're going to pass articles of impeachment against the president
[1:07:53.140 --> 1:07:55.620]  and then all hell is going to break loose through christmas
[1:07:57.700 --> 1:08:01.940]  in the u.s senate and the deep state is going to pull out every stop they've got
[1:08:01.940 --> 1:08:14.500]  to remove the elected president who's done nothing wrong but challenge their criminal operations
[1:08:19.860 --> 1:08:26.900]  the question is what are we going to do about it that's really the question here that everybody
[1:08:26.900 --> 1:08:32.020]  has to be asking themselves because the globalists know they're getting their ass kicked politically
[1:08:32.020 --> 1:08:35.460]  all over the world they know there's a global awakening and they're coming down with both feet
[1:08:37.460 --> 1:08:42.420]  on top of everyone
[1:08:47.060 --> 1:08:51.220]  and have you added that the behavior of a lot of the republicans rolling over
[1:08:51.220 --> 1:08:55.940]  and have you added to that
[1:08:58.660 --> 1:09:03.780]  twitter saying they're banning all political advertising that's the only shot people in
[1:09:03.780 --> 1:09:09.220]  america have is to spend money to counter their propaganda but you can't even spend money to
[1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:14.500]  counter the thousands of channels and dis info and facebook and twitter propaganda that that's
[1:09:14.500 --> 1:09:21.620]  really political lies and advertising and hoaxes but they don't call political so then you can't
[1:09:21.620 --> 1:09:29.220]  even run an ad to challenge it or run an ad showing joe biden say i gave the order to the
[1:09:29.220 --> 1:09:33.700]  president of ukraine to fire that prosecutor investigating my son i said to that son of a
[1:09:33.700 --> 1:09:40.980]  bitch he didn't fired today we're gonna hold up one million dollars everything they said trump did
[1:09:40.980 --> 1:09:49.620]  they did in front of god and the world but on this hoax they're gonna go forward because it's all
[1:09:49.620 --> 1:09:57.220]  they've got and their criminals run wild and people laugh at these criminals they think oh
[1:09:57.220 --> 1:10:03.700]  they're a joke no one's buying it they don't care they've got election fraud they've got tens of
[1:10:03.700 --> 1:10:09.140]  millions of dead people's names that they have homeless and illegal aliens go voting in
[1:10:09.140 --> 1:10:22.420]  and they have the criminal will to dominate us so they're silencing all conservative speech on
[1:10:22.420 --> 1:10:28.100]  twitter facebook's already rejecting most ads they're just acting like oh we're still open for it and
[1:10:28.100 --> 1:10:34.100]  then hillary is decrying them saying how dare you take political advertising she's not even saying
[1:10:34.100 --> 1:10:41.460]  it's russian propaganda now she just says how dare you today take political
[1:10:44.260 --> 1:10:52.660]  advertising she condemns facebook the woman that rigged the debates and rigged all the
[1:10:52.660 --> 1:10:56.900]  questions it had four times the money that trump did and four times the advertising and did hire
[1:10:56.900 --> 1:11:02.900]  russian bots and british bots and every other bot you just go to these foreign countries and get
[1:11:02.900 --> 1:11:08.100]  around our election laws and hire companies there to run the attacks michael moore would
[1:11:08.100 --> 1:11:13.620]  organize protests outside trump tower with russian bots that's all confirmed everything
[1:11:13.620 --> 1:11:28.340]  they say we've done they are think about that and now bill clinton says that hillary is getting
[1:11:28.340 --> 1:11:35.540]  ready to run he says he's not going to say what she's running for but oh she's getting ready to
[1:11:35.540 --> 1:11:43.860]  run yeah she's campaigning she's raising money she's running the dnc conference calls she's calling
[1:11:43.860 --> 1:11:48.500]  the shots and cori booker's running around kissing her ass
[1:11:52.900 --> 1:11:57.140]  it's up on info wars dot com right now let's play that short clip in the former president
[1:11:57.140 --> 1:12:02.100]  god she may or may not ever run for anything but i can't legally run for president again
[1:12:03.060 --> 1:12:06.820]  she may or may not ever run for anything but i can't legally run for president again
[1:12:08.180 --> 1:12:08.980]  oh did you hear that
[1:12:11.780 --> 1:12:15.300]  but what she really wants to do is stay and control the political machine
[1:12:15.300 --> 1:12:19.460]  so that she controls who gets into office that's really what's happening you'll just still get
[1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:24.980]  hillary i mean she was in with her husband co-president for eight years then co-president
[1:12:24.980 --> 1:12:27.540]  with obama really that was admitted for eight years
[1:12:31.060 --> 1:12:35.460]  and that's not enough for her she wants more so here's the toll free number what's your take on this
[1:12:37.140 --> 1:12:40.900]  they got a timeline mcconnell says be ready for the trial after thanksgiving
[1:12:41.780 --> 1:12:47.460]  said that two weeks ago he says it's coming they're going to do it will they get the votes of the
[1:12:47.460 --> 1:12:54.340]  senate will the neocons show us who they really are and stab trumpet the back you bet your votes
[1:12:54.340 --> 1:13:00.260]  say well what are we going to do to fight back against this folks overconfidence is the realization
[1:13:01.700 --> 1:13:09.380]  of everything we're trying to do 877-789 alex 877-789-2539 877
[1:13:11.620 --> 1:13:18.740]  789-2539 first-time callers long-time callers it's a free-for-all i'm going to try to move
[1:13:18.740 --> 1:13:22.180]  quick through your calls i've been getting more calls we're going to do that on the other side
[1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:30.660]  here but this is a time to be praying for people's eyes to be open it's also a time to be politically
[1:13:30.660 --> 1:13:48.980]  active and politically engaged and to realize that it's only going to get worse if people don't
[1:13:48.980 --> 1:13:54.740]  get out of their houses and get up off their asses and get aggressive they have taken all of our
[1:13:54.740 --> 1:14:09.060]  acquiescence as weakness they have taken the fact that they think we're weak and they think we care
[1:14:09.060 --> 1:14:17.940]  what mainstream media says about us and so they're making their move and they're still just this
[1:14:17.940 --> 1:14:22.660]  delusion when people see the globalists and all their minions and how pathetic they are you think
[1:14:22.660 --> 1:14:26.100]  there's no way they're going to beat us they've all they've got most the world
[1:14:29.620 --> 1:14:33.140]  under their control right now ladies and gentlemen
[1:14:35.780 --> 1:14:40.740]  they've got most the world under their control right now and they've bullied and dominated and
[1:14:40.740 --> 1:14:45.060]  murdered hundreds of millions of people and the same globalist that are about to carve America
[1:14:45.060 --> 1:14:50.180]  put mouse a tongue into power and he killed 100 plus millions of their people and they love to do
[1:14:50.180 --> 1:14:56.980]  that here they're dreaming of it they want to carve us up so bad that they just are salivating
[1:14:58.260 --> 1:15:04.900]  and i cannot express to you enough how bad they are how evil they are their main line statements
[1:15:04.900 --> 1:15:09.780]  are when you go to democrat events is let's kill kids up to age three we hate children but they
[1:15:09.780 --> 1:15:15.700]  lecture you all day about how they love children now you do what they say these are demonic fallen
[1:15:15.700 --> 1:15:21.940]  people these are the minions of satan they are satanic in their own operating system
[1:15:27.060 --> 1:15:29.620]  and they make everything a big joke like it's halloween
[1:15:30.980 --> 1:15:37.700]  but these are people turned over to an anti christ spirit and your churches are scared they won't
[1:15:37.700 --> 1:15:42.180]  say a word the republican leaders are scared they won't say a word and i'm going to get into some
[1:15:42.180 --> 1:15:46.580]  of the republicans coming out supporting the washington post push for censorship and supporting
[1:15:46.580 --> 1:15:52.100]  an in gorka calling for conservatives to be banned off twitter so that he gets in favor with them and
[1:15:52.100 --> 1:15:58.580]  he doesn't get taken off these are just unamerican trash posing as if they care about us and trying

[1:20:32.420 --> 1:20:33.620]  a lot of people say
[1:20:33.620 --> 1:20:43.940]  well if they remove trump there'll be a depression the globalists have been engineering a depression
[1:20:43.940 --> 1:20:49.060]  and they want an excuse to do it and they want to use trump to claim that that's how it happens
[1:20:49.060 --> 1:20:55.380]  they want a civil war they want to start non confiscation they want a breakdown of civilization
[1:20:55.380 --> 1:21:02.100]  because they think when you see your 401k plunging you'll do whatever they say politically like you
[1:21:02.100 --> 1:21:15.780]  did back in the year 2008 because the appeasement of letting convicted pedophiles go into schools
[1:21:15.780 --> 1:21:21.540]  unannounced in many cases and have children sitting their laps all the men literally make demon faces
[1:21:23.060 --> 1:21:28.180]  and to have states passing laws to keep babies alive and take their organs because they got caught
[1:21:28.180 --> 1:21:35.220]  and need the law retroactively and accepting open borders and saying that we can't have any sovereignty
[1:21:35.220 --> 1:21:37.060]  they think we're weak
[1:21:41.460 --> 1:21:47.220]  i mean i'm not mad at paul watson i get why he does it tongue in cheek to play their games on
[1:21:47.220 --> 1:21:52.660]  twitter and facebook but there's always going to be more they want but i became physically ill
[1:21:52.660 --> 1:22:00.340]  last night when i watched this video of this vampire wannabe person that's what it is it's an
[1:22:00.340 --> 1:22:07.620]  ugly scary man dressed up like a vampire but says i'm a girl so don't talk bad about me
[1:22:07.620 --> 1:22:14.980]  simulating murdering her own baby and paul watson has in the headline drag queen simulates cutting
[1:22:14.980 --> 1:22:20.580]  baby out of her wound drinking blood so they tell us two plus two equals ten and we agree with it
[1:22:20.580 --> 1:22:26.580]  and then we go along with some monster demon vampire creeperzoid pervert
[1:22:29.060 --> 1:22:29.460]  and then
[1:22:32.260 --> 1:22:37.940]  we all dutifully call this thing a her which is blasphemy about women
[1:22:40.100 --> 1:22:47.940]  i mean women are holy they're powerful they're magic so we're men but a different way
[1:22:47.940 --> 1:22:54.260]  and the devil hates women that's why the devil targets women first you get the women then you
[1:22:54.260 --> 1:23:08.100]  got the children so follow the men and women are the military manufacturing center satan sees us as
[1:23:08.100 --> 1:23:16.980]  a weapon system and wants to get rid of us that's kill still destroy and these people are going about
[1:23:16.980 --> 1:23:21.940]  like lions roaring seeing who they may devour
[1:23:27.060 --> 1:23:35.460]  and most people fall down on their knees and say eat me last here have the children take everything
[1:23:36.180 --> 1:23:39.540]  and they wonder why they're so unhappy and why they're so lost
[1:23:39.540 --> 1:23:45.380]  and you can just feel the evil on this planet
[1:23:46.580 --> 1:23:52.020]  angry that it's not having its full way and just wanting to finish us off and then the
[1:23:52.020 --> 1:23:56.260]  massive censorship we've seen so i'm gonna go to your calls the next segment but i want to
[1:23:56.260 --> 1:23:59.700]  just mention what's coming up on this front because i talked about it but here it is
[1:23:59.700 --> 1:24:06.740]  hillary clinton condemns facebook over political ads oh she condemns now it's not russian bots
[1:24:06.740 --> 1:24:11.540]  she's making up it's just republican ads period are bad she condemns it
[1:24:15.940 --> 1:24:20.180]  they've already banned all these big republican accounts mainline congress women others
[1:24:20.180 --> 1:24:27.140]  have photos and videos on twitter of them with their grandchildren saying hey i'm up for reelection
[1:24:27.140 --> 1:24:32.260]  please vote for me because i love america and trump runs these big twitter ads and facebook ads that
[1:24:32.260 --> 1:24:38.580]  say we're looking for strong women that want to empower america and be part of the leadership to
[1:24:38.580 --> 1:24:44.980]  restore the republic and what did facebook say they said that hurts men that identify as women
[1:24:45.540 --> 1:24:49.700]  or some women don't identify as strong as if you're like that's mental illness we're talking about
[1:24:49.700 --> 1:24:54.020]  it is mentalizing anything we want you can't say it and the republicans didn't do anything
[1:24:54.740 --> 1:25:00.660]  there weren't any injunctions any lawsuits there was and so they go hey we'll just shut all you up
[1:25:00.660 --> 1:25:06.660]  and then they'll call all the thousands of democrat channels and propaganda that is political advertising
[1:25:06.660 --> 1:25:13.300]  that they won't call it that so they're shutting trump down right now at twitter facebook's already
[1:25:13.300 --> 1:25:17.540]  curtailed it massively can't even say my name they're now demonizing women at shooting ranges
[1:25:17.540 --> 1:25:21.220]  banning your facebook's because a woman was just with a gun they say that's part of a terrorist
[1:25:21.220 --> 1:25:25.060]  organization and no one sees what's happening and now they're going after everybody's bank
[1:25:25.060 --> 1:25:29.060]  accounts and a lot of us go oh we better shut up they'll get our bank accounts they'll get
[1:25:29.060 --> 1:25:36.900]  everything if you cower haley clinton condemns facebook oh over political ads twitter will
[1:25:36.900 --> 1:25:43.300]  ban political ads jack dorsi announces starting tomorrow and don't worry zuckerberg doubles
[1:25:43.300 --> 1:25:48.020]  on the facebook political ads at her twitter ban what does it even mean doubles down it's already
[1:25:48.020 --> 1:25:55.220]  controlling but don't worry sebastian gorka demands evil nick fointes be censored and if you don't
[1:25:55.220 --> 1:26:00.900]  agree with what nick fointes says or what he does i don't agree with a lot of it should he be off
[1:26:00.900 --> 1:26:06.420]  twitter again but now with conservatives like gorka you know he's they're signaling daily wire
[1:26:06.420 --> 1:26:13.380]  founders says conservatism is about conserving liberalism and then he goes on to say you dumb
[1:26:13.380 --> 1:26:17.780]  conservatives if you're a real conservative who believes in individual liberty that above all
[1:26:17.780 --> 1:26:23.140]  else you want less government control of her lives hate filled gremlins are not conservative
[1:26:23.140 --> 1:26:28.500]  and he wants them banned and he goes on to call them you know throwbacks and culture war i mean
[1:26:28.500 --> 1:26:35.700]  this is just the left taking over everything that's all this is and and now they're just all
[1:26:35.700 --> 1:26:44.420]  uncloking to show you who they are so this is it this is the biggest salt they're going to impeach
[1:26:44.420 --> 1:26:48.500]  the president in the house by the end of the year and they're going to have their fake
[1:26:48.500 --> 1:26:54.980]  said and hearing and that's where the real fight's going to be and if you're overconfident about it
[1:26:56.980 --> 1:27:03.220]  when they get trump like the minute they think he's discredited the minute he's been convicted
[1:27:03.220 --> 1:27:08.820]  they'll probably bomb him blow him up something like that because they're not going to let him
[1:27:08.820 --> 1:27:12.660]  fight back at that point they want him discredited they want the fake conviction and they're going
[1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:18.580]  to kill the president just to sure as the son of the the president's a walking dead man unless we
[1:27:18.580 --> 1:27:24.260]  admit he is a walking dead man you know in fact we'll play a little intro coming in that's it's
[1:27:24.260 --> 1:27:30.500]  nice it's a cdc uh thunderstruck put the trump and you know it's dynamic and powerful and masculine
[1:27:30.500 --> 1:27:40.260]  and manly and america's back and it's confidence and that's great but if we don't prosecute the
[1:27:40.260 --> 1:27:45.700]  democrats if we don't stop them we don't have a future by the way ladies and gentlemen we're
[1:27:45.700 --> 1:27:50.660]  running a giant special right now forty to seventy percent off storage free shipping

[1:32:13.620 --> 1:32:19.300]  textbook she said dad they're teaching us about the periodic table and i clicked on iodine and it
[1:32:19.300 --> 1:32:24.180]  says that two billion people have low IQs are mentally retarded on the planet earth because
[1:32:24.180 --> 1:32:28.340]  they didn't get enough iodine that's what you say all the time but i've heard people say you're
[1:32:28.340 --> 1:32:33.700]  crazy and it's not true but dad it's right here on the periodic table when i click it saying exactly
[1:32:33.700 --> 1:32:38.980]  what you said and i said i know honey that's why i have you take the high quality nutraceutical
[1:32:38.980 --> 1:32:45.060]  grade iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant it's why you're so alive it's it's one of the
[1:32:45.060 --> 1:32:50.980]  reasons uh that you're so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age and it just
[1:32:50.980 --> 1:32:57.060]  really blew her away to read it there for herself and i know that two billion people ladies and
[1:32:57.060 --> 1:33:01.620]  gentlemen two billion are mentally retarded on the face of the earth right now because of iodine
[1:33:01.620 --> 1:33:06.340]  deficiency research it and find out for yourself now info wars dot com
[1:33:09.380 --> 1:33:12.020]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:33:12.020 --> 1:33:23.860]  the fake media tried to stop us from going to the white house but i'm president and they're not
[1:33:23.860 --> 1:33:39.220]  we are fighting the fake news it's fake phony fake
[1:33:42.260 --> 1:33:44.580]  their agenda is not your agenda
[1:33:44.580 --> 1:33:52.900]  very very stupid they want you to think we're all crooked we're not
[1:33:54.500 --> 1:33:58.420]  it's russia the russians and the russians
[1:34:00.420 --> 1:34:06.500]  presidency is effectively a russian op political hurricane is out there it seems for him we'll
[1:34:06.500 --> 1:34:14.180]  call it a hurricane veteran who has president possibly working for the russians al trump has
[1:34:14.180 --> 1:34:21.540]  been a russian intelligence asset since 1987 what you just said is one of the most insanely
[1:34:21.540 --> 1:34:27.540]  idiotic things i have ever heard there's outright treason i mean there is no question he has no
[1:34:27.540 --> 1:34:36.020]  idea that right he's going down uh there is a reason why donald trump fears robert moeller
[1:34:36.020 --> 1:34:42.580]  in front of the tv cameras with the nation's attention turned to him i said it they uh
[1:34:42.580 --> 1:34:50.020]  he's called a coup d'etat which is a french for coup d'etat part of the uh just relax take it easy
[1:34:50.020 --> 1:34:58.420]  take your time because uh so really it's much more come on try getting it out that's beyond my
[1:34:58.420 --> 1:35:14.340]  purview i really can't speak to that you can't speak to that
[1:35:28.820 --> 1:35:38.340]  we
[1:35:45.700 --> 1:35:47.540]  i was shaking off the legs
[1:35:47.540 --> 1:36:06.340]  We move that embassy to Jerusalem, we could spark a full-on intifada and real people
[1:36:06.340 --> 1:36:07.340]  could die.
[1:36:07.340 --> 1:36:13.860]  I believe they will.
[1:36:13.860 --> 1:36:28.220]  The president of the United States is racist, all of us already knew that.
[1:36:28.220 --> 1:36:32.060]  You don't have a president who said talking about exterminating Latina.
[1:36:32.060 --> 1:36:53.020]  Trump believes that his voters are not only OK with a racist president, but that they want
[1:36:53.020 --> 1:36:55.300]  a racist president.
[1:36:55.300 --> 1:37:03.540]  My mind is real short, two months ago I was in prison and I'm in the wild, let's continue
[1:37:03.540 --> 1:37:20.500]  to make America great again.
[1:37:20.500 --> 1:37:25.740]  Trump is as destructive a person in this century as Hitler, Stalin and Mao were in
[1:37:25.740 --> 1:37:26.740]  the last century.
[1:37:26.740 --> 1:37:48.100]  He may be responsible for many more million deaths than they were.
[1:37:48.100 --> 1:37:52.260]  You are fake news.
[1:37:52.260 --> 1:38:07.780]  President Trump's fitness for office is now the top story in the country.
[1:38:07.780 --> 1:38:13.100]  And Mr. Smith on Vimeo made that, I can tell you we put out a little two minute video,
[1:38:13.100 --> 1:38:20.700]  didn't even have Alex Jones or M4s on it, about the president and talking about bringing
[1:38:20.700 --> 1:38:26.260]  the troops home and honoring the dead and they called it dangerous and hate and they
[1:38:26.260 --> 1:38:31.700]  took it off Facebook on just somebody else's account.
[1:38:31.700 --> 1:38:33.060]  That's how evil these people are.
[1:38:33.060 --> 1:38:34.540]  So I really support Trump.
[1:38:34.540 --> 1:38:35.540]  I love the president.
[1:38:35.540 --> 1:38:39.940]  He's doing an amazing job in the face of all this.
[1:38:39.940 --> 1:38:45.060]  But if we don't admit to ourselves that they're serious and they mean business and they're
[1:38:45.060 --> 1:38:54.340]  coming and we just laugh at all the times they failed so far, they're going to get that
[1:38:54.340 --> 1:39:00.620]  left hook in and can really do some damage because they've got the neocons, they've got
[1:39:00.620 --> 1:39:04.180]  the deep state, the whole thing's making its move.
[1:39:04.180 --> 1:39:12.180]  They have passed the initiation of official impeachment and they're not going to end up
[1:39:12.180 --> 1:39:14.500]  pulling it back.
[1:39:14.500 --> 1:39:15.700]  They're not going to end up.
[1:39:15.700 --> 1:39:21.340]  They've got their plan and it's going to go to the Senate in my view and again, all hell
[1:39:21.340 --> 1:39:22.340]  is going to break loose.
[1:39:22.340 --> 1:39:29.460]  I want to go to Danny, Charles, Jeff, Jason, Stephen, Sean, Wildman, Gary, Dan and others.
[1:39:29.460 --> 1:39:35.700]  We're going to have Reverend Childress on for two segments, black genocide expert to get
[1:39:35.700 --> 1:39:42.100]  his take on Kanye West coming out and talking about the black genocide and Alex Jones woke
[1:39:42.100 --> 1:39:46.500]  level and all that and that's the big litmus test.
[1:39:46.500 --> 1:39:47.500]  Kanye doing that.
[1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:48.500]  He's for real, folks.
[1:39:48.500 --> 1:39:53.860]  If you are black and you start talking about the black genocide but just going on, they're
[1:39:53.860 --> 1:39:57.100]  genocide to everybody but they're testing it out on the black folks.
[1:39:57.100 --> 1:40:00.460]  The black folks have gotten me, you know what, into the stick.
[1:40:00.460 --> 1:40:05.100]  I mean, we're all getting fed into a wood shipper but the black folks are like the feet.
[1:40:05.100 --> 1:40:06.500]  They went in first.
[1:40:06.500 --> 1:40:11.020]  We're all connected but let me tell you, they got stuck in there first.
[1:40:11.020 --> 1:40:14.820]  You can sit back and look how screwed up the black community is and look down on folks but
[1:40:14.820 --> 1:40:21.740]  let me tell you, that was a job done right there.
[1:40:21.740 --> 1:40:22.740]  Look what they've done to us.
[1:40:22.740 --> 1:40:28.380]  Look what they've done to everybody.
[1:40:28.380 --> 1:40:31.180]  I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back and go to Sean and everybody else
[1:40:31.180 --> 1:40:39.220]  is holding Dan, Gary, Wildman, Stefan, Jason, Charles, Danny, we'll get there, buddy.
[1:40:39.220 --> 1:40:42.220]  Go to Jeff and everybody.
[1:40:42.220 --> 1:40:43.220]  I got to be honest with you.
[1:40:43.220 --> 1:40:45.740]  I know the devil worse per czar.
[1:40:45.740 --> 1:40:49.540]  I've studied them and I don't like looking at them and giving them attention.
[1:40:49.540 --> 1:40:54.820]  It's a form of worship even having to be around them and I understand that but they have to
[1:40:54.820 --> 1:41:01.500]  be exposed and I mean, I'll be honest, I'm not going to carry out any offensive violence
[1:41:01.500 --> 1:41:15.380]  but we all know what the normal default position is with this and so I'm in a controlled rage
[1:41:15.380 --> 1:41:23.140]  right now and I'm sorry, the crew has to be around this.
[1:41:23.140 --> 1:41:24.420]  I don't want to look at Pelosi.
[1:41:24.420 --> 1:41:28.700]  I don't want to look at any of these people but I got to tell you, I know a lot of people
[1:41:28.700 --> 1:41:38.020]  stick their head in the sand and stop engaging and just hide because it's just, it's hard
[1:41:38.020 --> 1:41:42.700]  to get in the ring with these people.
[1:41:42.700 --> 1:41:48.420]  Not because you're scared of them but because they're spiritually stink so bad.
[1:41:48.420 --> 1:41:54.060]  The Bible describes them as foul smelling, foul looking, spiritually stinking.
[1:41:54.060 --> 1:41:59.860]  And then they want our kids, oh, our poor children and they've got it all set up that
[1:41:59.860 --> 1:42:05.260]  if we did what folks would do in the old days to keep this type of evil under check, I mean,
[1:42:05.260 --> 1:42:10.500]  people knew when men started dressing up like clowns and coming after kids, that was a demon.
[1:42:10.500 --> 1:42:13.300]  They knew what to do.
[1:42:13.300 --> 1:42:17.260]  And they had it all set up now to make themselves the victims if we do that.
[1:42:17.260 --> 1:42:20.700]  So there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[1:42:20.700 --> 1:42:26.060]  But I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, if you think you don't like these people, God
[1:42:26.060 --> 1:42:27.940]  hates them so much.
[1:42:27.940 --> 1:42:28.940]  It's unbelievable.
[1:42:28.940 --> 1:42:29.940]  Unbelievable.
[1:42:29.940 --> 1:42:30.940]  God hates.
[1:42:30.940 --> 1:42:36.300]  These fake churches tell you God, they haven't been reading the Bible, folks.
[1:42:36.300 --> 1:42:42.740]  And so just believe me, these people are going to get trillions of times what they've done
[1:42:42.740 --> 1:42:43.740]  to these children.
[1:42:43.740 --> 1:42:48.100]  Now it doesn't do any justice, I get it.
[1:42:48.100 --> 1:42:54.260]  But everything they've imagined and they think they're doling out, they're gonna get to infinity
[1:42:54.260 --> 1:42:55.260]  and beyond.
[1:42:55.260 --> 1:43:00.660]  I quote Buzz Lightyear, oh, you know, there's more than one infinity.
[1:43:00.660 --> 1:43:04.860]  Well, they're right back, ladies and gentlemen, you're close to with us.
[1:43:04.860 --> 1:43:06.900]  Hey, Steve, how you doing?
[1:43:06.900 --> 1:43:11.740]  Hey, Alex, oh my God, longtime listener, first-time caller.
[1:43:11.740 --> 1:43:17.340]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital, I went to VA hospital out here in Boise, and
[1:43:17.340 --> 1:43:18.740]  I was in there until June.
[1:43:18.740 --> 1:43:22.460]  And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:23.620]  Let me tell you something, man.
[1:43:23.620 --> 1:43:28.940]  I had an internal digestive problem and I stumbled with it for about five or six years.
[1:43:28.940 --> 1:43:32.940]  And the doctors, they tried every test, nobody could figure out what it is.
[1:43:32.940 --> 1:43:36.540]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said,
[1:43:36.540 --> 1:43:39.300]  you know what, I'm gonna get me some of that freaking living defense.
[1:43:39.300 --> 1:43:42.500]  Now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have any stuff.
[1:43:42.500 --> 1:43:47.020]  But I ordered it, it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started taking
[1:43:47.020 --> 1:43:50.740]  it, man, that stuff changed my life, it saved my life.
[1:43:50.740 --> 1:43:55.460]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled, anybody's traveled overseas,
[1:43:55.460 --> 1:44:00.220]  you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[1:44:00.220 --> 1:44:04.180]  That's true folks, we don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality and living
[1:44:04.180 --> 1:44:07.780]  defense is over the top good.
[1:44:07.780 --> 1:44:11.220]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[1:44:11.220 --> 1:44:17.620]  Well, that's because different types of physiology, different types of metabolic systems and people
[1:44:17.620 --> 1:44:19.300]  will like different formulas.
[1:44:19.300 --> 1:44:21.900]  It's just that simple.
[1:44:21.900 --> 1:44:26.940]  X3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because some people need all three
[1:44:26.940 --> 1:44:31.580]  types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine.
[1:44:31.580 --> 1:44:35.980]  Get both, they're both great for you, whichever one you like, use that and give the other
[1:44:35.980 --> 1:44:38.260]  to family or friends.
[1:44:38.260 --> 1:44:41.620]  Bottom line, iodine is essential, that's why I harp on it.
[1:44:41.620 --> 1:44:45.940]  The globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[1:44:45.940 --> 1:44:49.060]  Lower IQ, makes you sluggish, you don't live as long.
[1:44:49.060 --> 1:44:50.060]  It's simple.
[1:44:50.060 --> 1:44:54.740]  Get your high quality iodine at infowarstore.com and help fund the Info War.
[1:44:54.740 --> 1:44:59.180]  We've got a huge sale running right now but it's about to end.
[1:44:59.180 --> 1:45:07.060]  It's the iodine challenge, both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[1:45:07.060 --> 1:45:11.420]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[1:45:11.420 --> 1:45:13.300]  I don't care what your views are.
[1:45:13.300 --> 1:45:16.540]  I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen and debate them.
[1:45:16.540 --> 1:45:17.540]  That's important.
[1:45:17.540 --> 1:45:18.820]  But we have something in common.
[1:45:18.820 --> 1:45:22.900]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[1:45:22.900 --> 1:45:28.180]  Clinton, deep state bag man, Comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that
[1:45:28.180 --> 1:45:30.140]  he lied to Congress and the world.
[1:45:30.140 --> 1:45:34.620]  He thinks committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get
[1:45:34.620 --> 1:45:35.620]  indicted.
[1:45:35.620 --> 1:45:40.420]  But where it is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[1:45:40.420 --> 1:45:42.020]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will...
[1:45:42.020 --> 1:45:48.700]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[1:45:48.700 --> 1:45:50.580]  Not so fast, criminal.
[1:45:50.580 --> 1:45:54.500]  We're going to bring you to justice and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[1:45:54.500 --> 1:45:59.220]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy.
[1:45:59.220 --> 1:46:04.100]  But the American people know how much you hate us and we're fighting back at infowars.com,
[1:46:04.100 --> 1:46:08.100]  newswars.com, and band.video.
[1:46:08.100 --> 1:46:09.100]  Here's the bad news.

[1:47:10.740 --> 1:47:26.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:26.100 --> 1:47:31.780]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:47:31.780 --> 1:47:34.780]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:34.780 --> 1:47:37.740]  Okay, and I'm going to pledge to do this.
[1:47:37.740 --> 1:47:41.060]  Tomorrow, I haven't done this in years.
[1:47:41.060 --> 1:47:44.220]  I am going to open the show up, and within 10 minutes of the show, I'm going to take
[1:47:44.220 --> 1:47:49.100]  calls throughout the entire broadcast tomorrow, and we'll be taking calls into the next hour.
[1:47:49.100 --> 1:47:52.340]  But we need to give everybody a chance to talk about the state of the world and what's
[1:47:52.340 --> 1:47:53.340]  happening.
[1:47:53.340 --> 1:47:54.340]  And I'm not trying to depress people.
[1:47:54.340 --> 1:47:58.460]  When I go over all this, I'm trying to point out how bad things are so we get up and we
[1:47:58.460 --> 1:48:01.100]  do something.
[1:48:01.100 --> 1:48:02.100]  That's how we got Trump in.
[1:48:02.100 --> 1:48:05.620]  We suckerpussed him.
[1:48:05.620 --> 1:48:09.740]  And other anti-globalists are being elected everywhere, but the New World Order is launching
[1:48:09.740 --> 1:48:15.660]  its counter-offensive, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:48:15.660 --> 1:48:20.780]  And Trump thinks he can overpower him this time just with his charisma, and he's not
[1:48:20.780 --> 1:48:24.980]  stood up against the censorship, and now they're banning Republicans doing advertising, and
[1:48:24.980 --> 1:48:26.460]  it's going to be system-wide.
[1:48:26.460 --> 1:48:29.940]  This Twitter thing is a test.
[1:48:29.940 --> 1:48:35.020]  Now they won't even take Republican money for ads.
[1:48:35.020 --> 1:48:39.460]  So they're moving forward with campaign finance reform that's silencing the American people.
[1:48:39.460 --> 1:48:44.700]  All the big money is against America, but groups are able to pool money and fight back,
[1:48:44.700 --> 1:48:48.660]  and the truth, $1 of truth counters $100 of lies.
[1:48:48.660 --> 1:48:50.580]  They know that.
[1:48:50.580 --> 1:48:55.700]  They can't allow ads of Joe Biden saying he held back a billion dollars until they fired
[1:48:55.700 --> 1:48:56.700]  the prosecutor.
[1:48:56.700 --> 1:49:03.460]  Notice they said that Trump got an ad ban on Twitter and Facebook because it was false.
[1:49:03.460 --> 1:49:04.580]  They won't show you the ad.
[1:49:04.580 --> 1:49:05.700]  He showed you the ad.
[1:49:05.700 --> 1:49:07.660]  It's what that evil bastard said.
[1:49:07.660 --> 1:49:11.700]  By the way, there are a lot of great guys that didn't have their parents married.
[1:49:11.700 --> 1:49:13.060]  Bastard is not a word I need to use anymore.
[1:49:13.060 --> 1:49:14.780]  That's a compliment to these people.
[1:49:14.780 --> 1:49:15.780]  Demons.
[1:49:15.780 --> 1:49:19.180]  All right, I'm going to go to your calls right now.
[1:49:19.180 --> 1:49:22.620]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gary.
[1:49:22.620 --> 1:49:24.140]  Gary and Florida, thanks for calling.
[1:49:24.140 --> 1:49:25.540]  Where do you see this going?
[1:49:25.540 --> 1:49:27.180]  Hey, Alex.
[1:49:27.180 --> 1:49:34.260]  Second-time caller, I called about two weeks ago, and you asked who was for impeachment
[1:49:34.260 --> 1:49:40.220]  and I said I was, but you thought it was because I was against Trump, and I had mentioned
[1:49:40.220 --> 1:49:44.580]  to you it was, I hoped it got to impeachment.
[1:49:44.580 --> 1:49:51.020]  I was worried it wasn't even going to get there, but I wanted to see how many Republican
[1:49:51.020 --> 1:49:52.860]  senators it would expose.
[1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:57.220]  Now, I remember you saying that, and I said, I think it's too dangerous, and I told you
[1:49:57.220 --> 1:50:00.020]  I think it would get to impeachment.
[1:50:00.020 --> 1:50:06.660]  And then I'm glad to finally hear Roger the other day was great hearing from him.
[1:50:06.660 --> 1:50:12.220]  And he kind of vindicated some of the things that I was thinking, however, I think he was
[1:50:12.220 --> 1:50:15.420]  wrong on a couple of things.
[1:50:15.420 --> 1:50:19.020]  So much, I have to say, so little time, so I want to try and be concise.
[1:50:19.020 --> 1:50:21.020]  Sure, go ahead.
[1:50:21.020 --> 1:50:27.100]  First of all, I think this is pretty much the second, the third, getting in the ninth
[1:50:27.100 --> 1:50:28.620]  and in game.
[1:50:28.620 --> 1:50:35.380]  I had mentioned that if we ever did get to that other impeachment, the whole goal in
[1:50:35.380 --> 1:50:43.300]  the end would be for them to destroy this president, obviously, because the Democrats,
[1:50:43.300 --> 1:50:51.500]  they think like the Chinese 25 to 30 year period, they've taken 25 years to pretty much
[1:50:51.500 --> 1:50:58.060]  get 80,000 people in the State Department and throughout this deep state.
[1:50:58.060 --> 1:51:01.460]  And Trump came around and they never thought he'd get elected.
[1:51:01.460 --> 1:51:08.380]  So basically, they stopped the last part of that 25 to 30 year period, that takeover time,
[1:51:08.380 --> 1:51:11.980]  battleground USA, they really wanted it.
[1:51:11.980 --> 1:51:14.740]  So now Roger said two really good things.
[1:51:14.740 --> 1:51:17.980]  He's the great disruptor.
[1:51:17.980 --> 1:51:21.980]  And that we should put money against these senators that are Republicans, and here's
[1:51:21.980 --> 1:51:23.500]  where I disagree with Roger.
[1:51:23.500 --> 1:51:24.500]  Oh, really?
[1:51:24.500 --> 1:51:28.260]  Well, why do you think Twitter is banning quote political advertising to block Trump's
[1:51:28.260 --> 1:51:29.260]  money?
[1:51:29.260 --> 1:51:30.260]  Exactly.
[1:51:30.260 --> 1:51:34.900]  But remember, you asked Lee Strand, they're moving in for the kill.
[1:51:34.900 --> 1:51:37.540]  We're sitting here rearranging deck chairs.
[1:51:37.540 --> 1:51:41.700]  Everyone needs to go to DC and march into their damn offices and get in their faces.
[1:51:41.700 --> 1:51:43.740]  The way the Lib Tards do.
[1:51:43.740 --> 1:51:44.740]  I got to jump, sir.
[1:51:44.740 --> 1:51:45.740]  God bless you.
[1:51:45.740 --> 1:51:46.740]  I got to get to everybody.
[1:51:46.740 --> 1:51:47.740]  You made some good points.
[1:51:47.740 --> 1:51:48.740]  Okay.
[1:51:48.740 --> 1:51:49.740]  Let's talk to Dan in New York.
[1:51:49.740 --> 1:51:50.740]  Dan, you're on the air.
[1:51:50.740 --> 1:51:51.740]  Go ahead.
[1:51:51.740 --> 1:51:57.180]  Alex, Alex, thank you for every single thing that you do, but I'm in New York and right
[1:51:57.180 --> 1:52:01.420]  now they're coming out with bicycle licenses, licenses to use your bicycle.
[1:52:01.420 --> 1:52:02.420]  Yeah.
[1:52:02.420 --> 1:52:03.420]  What do you think these dirty commies do?
[1:52:03.420 --> 1:52:07.340]  They take your cars away and they tax you for a damn bicycle.
[1:52:07.340 --> 1:52:09.820]  He wants to tax your meat, your salt.
[1:52:09.820 --> 1:52:11.620]  These people are crooks.
[1:52:11.620 --> 1:52:17.700]  Alex, the sixth plank of communism out of the communist manifesto is the centralization
[1:52:17.700 --> 1:52:20.860]  of the means of communication and transport.
[1:52:20.860 --> 1:52:21.860]  Okay.
[1:52:21.860 --> 1:52:26.980]  And we got to remember that Mitch McConnell's wife is the head of the DOT, and I've never
[1:52:26.980 --> 1:52:30.620]  seen the DOT on the march like this ever before.
[1:52:30.620 --> 1:52:32.980]  New York City doesn't even look the same.
[1:52:32.980 --> 1:52:34.500]  It's out of control.
[1:52:34.500 --> 1:52:38.580]  So if we think we're going to trust Mitch McConnell, we're out of our minds.
[1:52:38.580 --> 1:52:41.620]  We need to get after him and Lindsey Graham.
[1:52:41.620 --> 1:52:43.580]  We can't trust them at all.
[1:52:43.580 --> 1:52:45.900]  We need to really, really act.
[1:52:45.900 --> 1:52:48.580]  Because remember, behind the scenes, they're being threatened.
[1:52:48.580 --> 1:52:50.380]  Their wives are being threatened.
[1:52:50.380 --> 1:52:53.300]  People are coming to their houses saying they're going to kill them, and not everybody's
[1:52:53.300 --> 1:52:58.900]  as tough as Khalees or Rand Paul, or quite frankly, yours truly, who won't back down.
[1:52:58.900 --> 1:53:00.420]  And you're absolutely right, sir.
[1:53:00.420 --> 1:53:01.580]  This is just full on.
[1:53:01.580 --> 1:53:02.900]  They're making their move.
[1:53:02.900 --> 1:53:03.900]  Yes.
[1:53:03.900 --> 1:53:10.580]  And right now, the DOT last week was doing an infomercial for Citibike, and Citibike
[1:53:10.580 --> 1:53:11.900]  is owned by Lyft.
[1:53:11.900 --> 1:53:17.380]  And when I lived in San Francisco, I was dealing with their pre-ICO positions and Chinese and
[1:53:17.380 --> 1:53:19.500]  Japanese companies own Lyft.
[1:53:19.500 --> 1:53:23.860]  The DOT is actively making money for China right now.
[1:53:23.860 --> 1:53:26.020]  It's out of control.
[1:53:26.020 --> 1:53:28.860]  All right, brother.
[1:53:28.860 --> 1:53:29.860]  Well, thank you so much.
[1:53:29.860 --> 1:53:30.860]  Good points.
[1:53:30.860 --> 1:53:34.140]  We've got another report we're pulling up for next hour, but the Republicans are demanding
[1:53:34.140 --> 1:53:38.740]  that SHIF show up to the Judiciary Committee, because they're not even following the rules,
[1:53:38.740 --> 1:53:40.420]  the law, any of it.
[1:53:40.420 --> 1:53:43.700]  And again, people said, well, that means it's just a show thing.
[1:53:43.700 --> 1:53:45.100]  It's not a real impeachment.
[1:53:45.100 --> 1:53:47.820]  They were cooking it up in an illegal operation.
[1:53:47.820 --> 1:53:51.100]  Now they're springing it.
[1:53:51.100 --> 1:53:52.660]  Impeachment Halloween on Hill.
[1:53:52.660 --> 1:53:53.660]  There's dredge report.
[1:53:53.660 --> 1:54:00.380]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[1:54:00.380 --> 1:54:02.060]  Let's talk to Charles in Missouri.
[1:54:02.060 --> 1:54:03.060]  Charles, thanks for calling.
[1:54:03.060 --> 1:54:04.060]  Go ahead.
[1:54:04.060 --> 1:54:07.620]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[1:54:07.620 --> 1:54:12.340]  I just know this country's fighting for its life, and literal armies of pedophiles are
[1:54:12.340 --> 1:54:18.580]  dressed up like vampires, calling themselves drag queens coming for our children.
[1:54:18.580 --> 1:54:20.700]  You lying about that?
[1:54:20.700 --> 1:54:21.700]  I see it every day.
[1:54:21.700 --> 1:54:25.100]  I'll tell you what, man, I want to know why Trump ain't doing something about this.
[1:54:25.100 --> 1:54:27.060]  He knows he didn't do nothing wrong.
[1:54:27.060 --> 1:54:31.260]  There are tons of attorneys saying there ain't nothing illegal about what he done or said
[1:54:31.260 --> 1:54:33.620]  on that call.
[1:54:33.620 --> 1:54:38.100]  He needs to be freaking claiming to go out and just hit Marsh wall and go after all of
[1:54:38.100 --> 1:54:39.100]  them.
[1:54:39.100 --> 1:54:42.700]  I'm a military tribunal.
[1:54:42.700 --> 1:54:46.900]  I want to say F, you know, that at us, but I'm going to keep it civil, but I'm tired
[1:54:46.900 --> 1:54:48.300]  of this, man.
[1:54:48.300 --> 1:54:50.460]  These guys don't realize what they're messing with.
[1:54:50.460 --> 1:54:53.780]  They're actually poking a bear because if they do impeach Trump, hey, we're going to
[1:54:53.780 --> 1:54:54.780]  reelect them.
[1:54:54.780 --> 1:55:00.700]  Well, here's the problem, and I hear what you're saying.
[1:55:00.700 --> 1:55:03.340]  They're just getting impeachment going, and they're going to have a bunch of other fake
[1:55:03.340 --> 1:55:07.820]  stuff come up during it, okay?
[1:55:07.820 --> 1:55:10.460]  They've already showed their hand, plus he said, oh, we're not just going to do the Ukraine
[1:55:10.460 --> 1:55:11.460]  thing.
[1:55:11.460 --> 1:55:12.460]  We've got a bunch of stuff.
[1:55:12.460 --> 1:55:16.500]  So they're just getting it already, and they're just going to flood it times a hundred like
[1:55:16.500 --> 1:55:17.500]  Kavanaugh.
[1:55:17.500 --> 1:55:22.660]  They'll have 20 women saying Trump raped them up there, and then they're going to have the
[1:55:22.660 --> 1:55:25.140]  moral air cover they think they need.
[1:55:25.140 --> 1:55:27.820]  They're going to initiate riots nationwide.
[1:55:27.820 --> 1:55:31.820]  And so I'm just telling you, the train wreck is coming.
[1:55:31.820 --> 1:55:33.460]  It's here.
[1:55:33.460 --> 1:55:34.460]  And I hear what you're saying.
[1:55:34.460 --> 1:55:38.980]  You know, the Democrats have chai-com operatives running most of their offices.
[1:55:38.980 --> 1:55:43.260]  It's come out, Pelosi, Feinstein, all of it.
[1:55:43.260 --> 1:55:48.220]  And so, yes, if the Justice Department did its job, most of them would already be indicted.
[1:55:48.220 --> 1:55:52.740]  My God, these are globalists that don't think the country should exist, that have been maneuvering
[1:55:52.740 --> 1:55:54.460]  us towards collapse.
[1:55:54.460 --> 1:55:59.420]  But Trump can't get any of these cowardly lawyers that tell him they're taking action to ever
[1:55:59.420 --> 1:56:02.220]  do anything because they're all hedging their bets.
[1:56:02.220 --> 1:56:04.020]  They're all a bunch of damn cowards.
[1:56:04.020 --> 1:56:05.020]  I appreciate your call.
[1:56:05.020 --> 1:56:12.620]  Let's go ahead and go to Jeff, and Canada, Jeff, you're on the air, go ahead, and welcome.
[1:56:12.620 --> 1:56:16.300]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[1:56:16.300 --> 1:56:22.340]  Really believe you're not understating the danger of the times here, and I've been praying
[1:56:22.340 --> 1:56:29.020]  about it and whatnot, and a phrase came to me, Patriot Revere worldwide, Operation Patriot
[1:56:29.020 --> 1:56:31.220]  Revere worldwide.
[1:56:31.220 --> 1:56:34.500]  There's no fence that you can consider as God.
[1:56:34.500 --> 1:56:36.020]  The devil owns the fence.
[1:56:36.020 --> 1:56:44.500]  And if people do not act, the quorum is going to give way to destruction.
[1:56:44.500 --> 1:56:52.100]  And so I think we really need to all mobilize in every possible way that we can in the 3D
[1:56:52.100 --> 1:56:54.540]  world, in the 4D world.
[1:56:54.540 --> 1:56:55.540]  We're fighting big tech.
[1:56:55.540 --> 1:57:02.780]  We're fighting all these things, and there's an all-out attack trying to sink the big ship,
[1:57:02.780 --> 1:57:03.780]  and it's not going to stop.
[1:57:03.780 --> 1:57:12.340]  And the only way is for patriots to act, and worldwide, a patriot movement that is going
[1:57:12.340 --> 1:57:17.020]  to use the First Amendment to avoid using the Second Amendment.
[1:57:17.020 --> 1:57:18.020]  Jeff, don't hang up.
[1:57:18.020 --> 1:57:21.020]  I want to come back and have you finish, because you're right.
[1:57:21.020 --> 1:57:26.340]  Most people who aren't Satanists and who don't want destruction and evil, you're like, why
[1:57:26.340 --> 1:57:27.340]  would they want to wreck everything?
[1:57:27.340 --> 1:57:28.340]  This isn't going to go well.
[1:57:28.340 --> 1:57:29.340]  This is going to be destructive.
[1:57:29.340 --> 1:57:31.580]  It's going to blow up.
[1:57:31.580 --> 1:57:33.260]  These are minions.
[1:57:33.260 --> 1:57:34.860]  The globalists set off shore.
[1:57:34.860 --> 1:57:40.020]  They're manipulating all this, and so they have nothing to lose but attack.
[1:57:40.020 --> 1:57:45.540]  And then by us not getting the word out strategically about how serious this is, we give them the
[1:57:45.540 --> 1:57:46.540]  advantage.
[1:57:46.540 --> 1:57:48.980]  So you're absolutely right.
[1:57:48.980 --> 1:57:51.820]  And I want to hear more about this idea about patriot and revere worldwide.
[1:57:51.820 --> 1:57:55.940]  When we come back, please stay with us.
[1:57:55.940 --> 1:58:00.020]  We are running the Everything Must Go Super Sale, but it's going to have to end by early
[1:58:00.020 --> 1:58:04.620]  next week, because we're selling out of many of our best-selling products, like Ultra 12,

[1:59:55.060 --> 2:00:00.180]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[2:00:00.180 --> 2:00:17.460]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's
[2:00:17.460 --> 2:00:20.180]  Alex Jones.
[2:00:20.180 --> 2:00:35.220]  Yeah, folks, one adventure, you're about to get it, you know, we can see off potential
[2:00:35.220 --> 2:00:44.380]  futures and you can feel where we're going if we make any wrong steps at this point.
[2:00:44.380 --> 2:00:47.060]  Now, there's not just evil in the world, there's good.
[2:00:47.060 --> 2:00:50.980]  And I think prayer is essential.
[2:00:50.980 --> 2:00:52.980]  That prayer has to be turned into action.
[2:00:52.980 --> 2:01:00.500]  We've got Reverend Childress, a black genocide research group, who's made films as an expert
[2:01:00.500 --> 2:01:04.580]  testified to Congress on Planned Parenthood and the targeting of black people.
[2:01:04.580 --> 2:01:08.620]  And the fact that Kanye West is for real, he would come out and talk about that while
[2:01:08.620 --> 2:01:09.620]  he's done it.
[2:01:09.620 --> 2:01:13.860]  And boy, they coming after him now, so he's going to pop in for a few seconds, we'll go
[2:01:13.860 --> 2:01:14.860]  back to your calls.
[2:01:14.860 --> 2:01:18.740]  I'm going to get to everybody that's holding right now, Danny and Jeff and Jason and Stefan
[2:01:18.740 --> 2:01:24.580]  and Sean and Wildman and Brian and Mel and Costa Rica, we'll get to all of you.
[2:01:24.580 --> 2:01:34.060]  But Jeff and Canada is a trucker, this is a launch operation Patriot Revere.
[2:01:34.060 --> 2:01:41.020]  Whatever you do, get active or get enslaved, so I agree.
[2:01:41.020 --> 2:01:44.260]  The globalists go hire all these companies worldwide to run their operations against
[2:01:44.260 --> 2:01:45.260]  America.
[2:01:45.260 --> 2:01:48.100]  But people all over the world can realize America is where the big fight's happening
[2:01:48.100 --> 2:01:49.100]  right now.
[2:01:49.100 --> 2:01:53.260]  If the globalists get full control, Katie bar the door, if America becomes a pure engine
[2:01:53.260 --> 2:01:54.260]  of evil.
[2:01:54.260 --> 2:02:00.980]  And just like Russia was an engine of communism and it was hellish, well, we can't go there
[2:02:00.980 --> 2:02:02.820]  or it's going to be 10 times worse than Russia.
[2:02:02.820 --> 2:02:03.820]  Just watch, folks.
[2:02:03.820 --> 2:02:05.740]  We're so close to that.
[2:02:05.740 --> 2:02:10.580]  So what do you see with this operation Patriot Revere?
[2:02:10.580 --> 2:02:18.980]  Well, Alex, I think, you know, you could turn it into a contest, I don't know if a contest
[2:02:18.980 --> 2:02:25.500]  is the right genre for this, but to mobilize the creativity of the Patriots, like you told
[2:02:25.500 --> 2:02:30.540]  me you saw a lawn sign that said Hillary for prison and it went worldwide.
[2:02:30.540 --> 2:02:35.340]  It was one person acting and just putting a sign on their lawn and somebody else grabbed
[2:02:35.340 --> 2:02:36.580]  it and spun off of it.
[2:02:36.580 --> 2:02:38.580]  It was, yeah, it was like, it was homemade.
[2:02:38.580 --> 2:02:39.580]  Yeah, it was homemade.
[2:02:39.580 --> 2:02:44.420]  And it was, it was seemingly nothing, but it went worldwide.
[2:02:44.420 --> 2:02:45.420]  That's what we need.
[2:02:45.420 --> 2:02:49.460]  You know, someone takes a microphone and goes down to the NRA there and gets an interview
[2:02:49.460 --> 2:02:52.180]  seen by hundreds of thousands of people.
[2:02:52.180 --> 2:02:55.740]  Everybody has to pray to God and act in what they hear.
[2:02:55.740 --> 2:02:57.340]  Just do what you hear.
[2:02:57.340 --> 2:02:58.340]  But you have...
[2:02:58.340 --> 2:02:59.340]  That's right.
[2:02:59.340 --> 2:03:01.620]  And sure, you go on YouTube or Facebook or Twitter, they ban you in a week or maybe they
[2:03:01.620 --> 2:03:02.620]  shadow ban you immediately.
[2:03:02.620 --> 2:03:07.700]  You do it more and everybody's going to catch Hillary when she collapses again or when she
[2:03:07.700 --> 2:03:12.180]  slaps somebody across the face or one of these child molesters or, you know, we're going,
[2:03:12.180 --> 2:03:17.300]  we have to go get eyes on them and they're so evil that you don't have to wait for action
[2:03:17.300 --> 2:03:18.300]  with these people.
[2:03:18.300 --> 2:03:23.020]  Man, I'm telling you, these corrupt mayors, these corrupt politicians, it is time to let
[2:03:23.020 --> 2:03:27.340]  them have it politically, legally and lawfully, just like Veritas does.
[2:03:27.340 --> 2:03:28.340]  Exactly.
[2:03:28.340 --> 2:03:31.060]  I would like to see a T-shirt and a hatline.
[2:03:31.060 --> 2:03:38.580]  And I think patriots could rally around that flag and really just take action in the...
[2:03:38.580 --> 2:03:41.940]  Yeah, I've been trying to think what the new Hillary for prison style shirt is for this
[2:03:41.940 --> 2:03:42.940]  year.
[2:03:42.940 --> 2:03:46.300]  That was the dominant, the shirt of the 2016 election.
[2:03:46.300 --> 2:03:50.340]  We get the credit for that, which means they've come after us, but I kind of like the Trump
[2:03:50.340 --> 2:03:53.580]  Medusa one because it's Hillary and she plans to run again.
[2:03:53.580 --> 2:03:58.620]  That means that's going to happen, but she's trying, but I just don't know, you know, Trump
[2:03:58.620 --> 2:04:02.300]  did nothing wrong or you know, you know, you know, Trump's a hero.
[2:04:02.300 --> 2:04:05.940]  I mean, I mean, I don't know, but we need to show that support now, but I'm telling
[2:04:05.940 --> 2:04:13.260]  you, people get intimidated by Congress and, but I mean, there's all these big office buildings
[2:04:13.260 --> 2:04:20.700]  for the House and Senate and you go there and you go into the committee hearings, almost
[2:04:20.700 --> 2:04:22.580]  none of them are in the Capitol.
[2:04:22.580 --> 2:04:26.580]  That's just where the House and Senate chambers are when they're in session and you just go
[2:04:26.580 --> 2:04:29.340]  to the metal detector and you go through there, your constituents.
[2:04:29.340 --> 2:04:30.340]  They're not royalty.
[2:04:30.340 --> 2:04:32.540]  They're not Queen Elizabeth, a sovereign.
[2:04:32.540 --> 2:04:39.220]  We kicked her great, great, great, great grandfather's ass, okay, to say that you work
[2:04:39.220 --> 2:04:46.380]  for us and you need to go in there and get in their dirty little maggot filled faces.
[2:04:46.380 --> 2:04:52.500]  And when they're in their towns and cities or when they go to events, it's time.
[2:04:52.500 --> 2:04:53.500]  It's time.
[2:04:53.500 --> 2:04:58.140]  And let me tell you, if they win, they're going to physically come after everybody.
[2:04:58.140 --> 2:05:02.900]  So we don't offensively want any violence, but we've got to start preparing for defensive
[2:05:02.900 --> 2:05:06.700]  operations.
[2:05:06.700 --> 2:05:10.220]  Folks ask me, Alex, why do you have two different types of iodine?
[2:05:10.220 --> 2:05:16.540]  Well, that's because different types of physiologies, different types of metabolic systems and people
[2:05:16.540 --> 2:05:18.220]  will like different formulas.
[2:05:18.220 --> 2:05:20.820]  It's just that simple.
[2:05:20.820 --> 2:05:25.460]  This three is the deep breath crystal iodine and two other types because some people need
[2:05:25.460 --> 2:05:30.540]  all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine.
[2:05:30.540 --> 2:05:31.540]  Get both.
[2:05:31.540 --> 2:05:33.860]  They're both great for you, whichever one you like.
[2:05:33.860 --> 2:05:37.220]  Use that and give the other to family or friends.
[2:05:37.220 --> 2:05:39.300]  Bottom line, iodine is essential.
[2:05:39.300 --> 2:05:40.580]  That's why I harp on it.
[2:05:40.580 --> 2:05:44.900]  The globalist want you to be efficient in it for a lot of reasons.
[2:05:44.900 --> 2:05:46.940]  Lower IQ makes you sluggish.
[2:05:46.940 --> 2:05:48.020]  You don't live as long.
[2:05:48.020 --> 2:05:49.020]  It's simple.
[2:05:49.020 --> 2:05:54.180]  Buy quality iodine at infowarstore.com and help fund the info war infowarstore.com.
[2:05:54.180 --> 2:05:58.140]  We've got a huge sale running right now, but it's about to end.
[2:05:58.140 --> 2:06:09.260]  It's the iodine challenge, both types of iodine with selenium for 60% off together.
[2:06:09.260 --> 2:06:11.540]  I have to sign letters.
[2:06:11.540 --> 2:06:13.700]  It's the hardest thing I have to do.
[2:06:13.700 --> 2:06:21.260]  I signed letters, dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith from Arkansas, dear Mr. and Mrs. Jones from
[2:06:21.260 --> 2:06:29.620]  Alabama, dear Mr. and Mrs. somebody from some great state, I'm sorry to inform you your
[2:06:29.620 --> 2:06:32.300]  son has been killed in combat.
[2:06:32.300 --> 2:06:33.300]  I'm so sorry.
[2:06:33.300 --> 2:06:36.180]  It's the hardest thing that I have to do.
[2:06:36.180 --> 2:06:40.300]  And I signed those letters and it just, it breaks your heart.
[2:06:40.300 --> 2:06:44.820]  And sometimes I go out to a place Dover Air Force Base.
[2:06:44.820 --> 2:06:47.620]  It's a very tough experience.
[2:06:47.620 --> 2:06:53.980]  We go out there and we meet the parents and the families, the wives, the children, the
[2:06:53.980 --> 2:06:55.700]  sisters, the brothers.
[2:06:55.700 --> 2:06:59.260]  We meet them and we talk to them.
[2:06:59.260 --> 2:07:01.780]  These things are just impossible.
[2:07:01.780 --> 2:07:08.060]  I don't know how parents can do it even and I'll be talking to some of the parents and
[2:07:08.060 --> 2:07:10.420]  they'll act like they're fine.
[2:07:10.420 --> 2:07:12.420]  I said, how are you doing?
[2:07:12.420 --> 2:07:13.420]  We're fine, sir.
[2:07:13.420 --> 2:07:14.420]  We're fine.
[2:07:14.420 --> 2:07:15.420]  We're really good.
[2:07:15.420 --> 2:07:16.420]  I said, that's great.
[2:07:16.420 --> 2:07:20.140]  And I'll tell the colonel, I said, Colonel, I think they're doing great.
[2:07:20.140 --> 2:07:21.140]  No, sir.
[2:07:21.140 --> 2:07:23.020]  They're not going to do great.
[2:07:23.020 --> 2:07:24.020]  You'll see.
[2:07:24.020 --> 2:07:25.500]  And I didn't know what he was talking about.
[2:07:25.500 --> 2:07:26.940]  This is the first time.
[2:07:26.940 --> 2:07:32.620]  And then we went outside to the runway and this incredible machine is flying in and it
[2:07:32.620 --> 2:07:38.180]  lands and it comes over and it pulls up, that door opens up.
[2:07:38.180 --> 2:07:44.540]  And the colonel told me, he said, sir, when that door opens up, those same people that
[2:07:44.540 --> 2:07:50.660]  you think are okay, do things that you'll never see, you will hear sounds like you've
[2:07:50.660 --> 2:07:51.660]  never heard.
[2:07:51.660 --> 2:07:52.660]  That's what he does.
[2:07:52.660 --> 2:07:58.780]  And I saw that door open up with a coffin, with a flag over it.
[2:07:58.780 --> 2:08:06.060]  With these beautiful soldiers, five or six on each side, lifting the coffin and walking
[2:08:06.060 --> 2:08:11.500]  down the runway, the plank, they call it, off this cargo plane.
[2:08:11.500 --> 2:08:19.660]  And I see parents make sounds, scream and cry like you've never seen before.
[2:08:19.660 --> 2:08:25.060]  A mother who was fine 20 minutes ago, you think, breaking the military line and jumping
[2:08:25.060 --> 2:08:31.380]  off and then jumping onto a coffin of her son or her daughter.
[2:08:31.380 --> 2:08:36.380]  Jumping on, on top of the flowers, on top of the American flag, I've seen this.
[2:08:36.380 --> 2:08:40.220]  We were supposed to be in Syria for 30 days.
[2:08:40.220 --> 2:08:42.900]  We've now been there for 10 years.
[2:08:42.900 --> 2:08:46.860]  We were supposed to be in Afghanistan for a short period of time.
[2:08:46.860 --> 2:08:50.620]  We're now going to be there for close to 19 years.
[2:08:50.620 --> 2:09:05.060]  It's time to bring them home.
[2:09:05.060 --> 2:09:08.540]  We put that up on a fan page.
[2:09:08.540 --> 2:09:11.700]  Darren McBreen made it, put it on his private page.
[2:09:11.700 --> 2:09:18.020]  It's a little fan page he's got, stuff he likes, and set it for the decade.
[2:09:18.020 --> 2:09:22.660]  And they took it down and said it was hate because they define things.
[2:09:22.660 --> 2:09:26.100]  They're judge, jury, they're executioner.
[2:09:26.100 --> 2:09:30.740]  And so because Trump wants to stop killing babies after they're born, because he wants
[2:09:30.740 --> 2:09:35.980]  to get us out of these endless wars because he doesn't want people unchecked coming in
[2:09:35.980 --> 2:09:44.780]  from a Congo with Ebola that's now reportedly in the Caribbean because he's trying to stabilize
[2:09:44.780 --> 2:09:54.060]  our economy because he doesn't want communist China owning our debt.
[2:09:54.060 --> 2:09:56.900]  He's the bad guy.
[2:09:56.900 --> 2:10:06.980]  And they get up and they lie and now they've passed initiation of the expansion of Adam
[2:10:06.980 --> 2:10:17.420]  Schiff's kangaroo court with official impeachment proceedings.
[2:10:17.420 --> 2:10:23.180]  And they've got the votes to impeach the president and the threat in everybody in the Senate.
[2:10:23.180 --> 2:10:27.660]  And they got a bunch of tricks up their sleeves and I'm only telling you this so people get
[2:10:27.660 --> 2:10:28.660]  out of their comfort zones.
[2:10:28.660 --> 2:10:33.180]  I wanted to get Reverend Childress on and I appreciate him coming on for just a few segments
[2:10:33.180 --> 2:10:34.180]  here.
[2:10:34.180 --> 2:10:35.580]  And then we're going to go to all your calls, folks.
[2:10:35.580 --> 2:10:37.460]  We've got a bunch of important breaking news as well.
[2:10:37.460 --> 2:10:41.660]  I'm going to go into the fourth hour somewhere today.
[2:10:41.660 --> 2:10:47.140]  But I wanted to get Reverend Childress on because we talked about Kanye West last time.
[2:10:47.140 --> 2:10:50.300]  He was on and I said, I think he's for real.
[2:10:50.300 --> 2:10:53.580]  I don't think this is just some PR deal and nobody's perfect.
[2:10:53.580 --> 2:10:55.940]  But you know, I mean, he can lead a lot of people to Christ.
[2:10:55.940 --> 2:10:56.940]  That's a good thing.
[2:10:56.940 --> 2:10:58.420]  I remember children's agree with me.
[2:10:58.420 --> 2:10:59.620]  Some folks have been critical of him.
[2:10:59.620 --> 2:11:08.060]  My point, as I said, the litmus test is the targeting of black babies is why Planned Parenthood
[2:11:08.060 --> 2:11:09.060]  was founded.
[2:11:09.060 --> 2:11:15.260]  This is some SJW virtue signal for me to say, oh, it's terrible that half the black folks
[2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:23.820]  that are conceived never make it out of their mother and 30-something million, 60 million
[2:11:23.820 --> 2:11:24.820]  something people aborted.
[2:11:24.820 --> 2:11:25.820]  It's all insane.
[2:11:25.820 --> 2:11:28.980]  30-something percent of black folks never get out of their mother's womb.
[2:11:28.980 --> 2:11:29.980]  They never had that first birthday.
[2:11:29.980 --> 2:11:30.980]  Any of it.
[2:11:30.980 --> 2:11:34.500]  And I went to a birthday party randomly to part and grabbed a little kid's cake and smashed
[2:11:34.500 --> 2:11:35.500]  it on the wall.
[2:11:35.500 --> 2:11:36.500]  They'd arrest me for being mean to kids.
[2:11:36.500 --> 2:11:37.500]  They'd chop a kid up.
[2:11:37.500 --> 2:11:38.500]  It's a good thing.
[2:11:38.500 --> 2:11:44.180]  And then the left has all these videos glorifying killing babies and now drag queen story time,
[2:11:44.180 --> 2:11:50.660]  you know, to simulate killing babies and these people are devil worshipers, folks.
[2:11:50.660 --> 2:12:03.900]  And I said, the litmus test is, are you against black genocide for these fake black leaders?
[2:12:03.900 --> 2:12:08.940]  Because that's who's being fed in the woodchipper first is black people.
[2:12:08.940 --> 2:12:12.140]  And so it's not something of virtue to say, oh, I'm so nice to the black people.
[2:12:12.140 --> 2:12:13.140]  I'm so good.
[2:12:13.140 --> 2:12:16.540]  A lot of the black folks have been brainwashed and turned against me just because I'm white.
[2:12:16.540 --> 2:12:20.460]  I still understand they've been brainwashed, just like white people have been brainwashed.
[2:12:20.460 --> 2:12:26.780]  But the issue is the true issue of genocide and targeting, everything's been tested on
[2:12:26.780 --> 2:12:31.140]  black people because they were isolated and targeted.
[2:12:31.140 --> 2:12:32.140]  And that's the historical fact.
[2:12:32.140 --> 2:12:35.060]  And you read what Margaret Sanger wrote and you know about Bill and Melinda Gates, you
[2:12:35.060 --> 2:12:36.780]  know about the whole situation.
[2:12:36.780 --> 2:12:42.500]  It's all built on what we've allowed to be done there and to have Kanye come out and
[2:12:42.500 --> 2:12:44.180]  talk about it.
[2:12:44.180 --> 2:12:46.820]  That is good and that needs to be supported and praised.
[2:12:46.820 --> 2:12:48.980]  What do you think, Reverend Childress?
[2:12:48.980 --> 2:12:51.540]  I really appreciate you coming on the broadcast.
[2:12:51.540 --> 2:12:55.140]  People should of course check out your important website, blackgenocide.org.
[2:12:55.140 --> 2:12:56.740]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[2:12:56.740 --> 2:12:59.980]  Oh, just also you hit the nail on the head.
[2:12:59.980 --> 2:13:03.020]  There's a trimmer in the forest today.
[2:13:03.020 --> 2:13:10.660]  Even on the web, they are already trying to censor and disrupt the videos that are playing
[2:13:10.660 --> 2:13:12.580]  Kanye's comments.
[2:13:12.580 --> 2:13:19.500]  And what is happening is he's kind of taken off where Tupac left off, who was getting
[2:13:19.500 --> 2:13:27.260]  ready to shift out of that hip hop grievance mindset into supporting some of the Judeo-Christian
[2:13:27.260 --> 2:13:29.900]  ethic and he was killed.
[2:13:29.900 --> 2:13:31.740]  We have to pray for Kanye West.
[2:13:31.740 --> 2:13:36.900]  He is the Democratic Party as of right now, worst nightmare.
[2:13:36.900 --> 2:13:46.900]  Hillary or Harris Poll just said 42% of black men are now supporting Donald Trump.
[2:13:46.900 --> 2:13:53.740]  Rasmussen in August said 36% of African-American people are supporting Trump.
[2:13:53.740 --> 2:13:58.620]  Once again, we shared this, they're more skilled at reading data than we are.
[2:13:58.620 --> 2:14:00.980]  We don't talk about it enough.
[2:14:00.980 --> 2:14:03.780]  They cannot win in 2020.
[2:14:03.780 --> 2:14:11.420]  The only way they have to somehow disrupt or impeach or just denigrate this president
[2:14:11.420 --> 2:14:19.100]  so bad that he falls out of favor, right now, they are witnessing the demise of their party
[2:14:19.100 --> 2:14:22.420]  because they made African-Americans the key.
[2:14:22.420 --> 2:14:24.820]  Now they're going to the Achilles heel.
[2:14:24.820 --> 2:14:26.820]  They're going down big time.
[2:14:26.820 --> 2:14:29.260]  And this is amazing to watch.
[2:14:29.260 --> 2:14:32.420]  And once again, you hit the nail right on the head.
[2:14:32.420 --> 2:14:36.020]  When he said abortion, I said, uh-oh.
[2:14:36.020 --> 2:14:37.020]  That's it.
[2:14:37.020 --> 2:14:39.300]  He is crossing over.
[2:14:39.300 --> 2:14:45.020]  Either he has to back off that statement or all hell is going to break loose on Kanye
[2:14:45.020 --> 2:14:46.020]  West.
[2:14:46.020 --> 2:14:49.340]  And you can see in his eyes, because I've watched Kanye, like everybody has for decades,
[2:14:49.340 --> 2:14:51.860]  you can see the energy and he knows what he's doing.
[2:14:51.860 --> 2:14:54.540]  I mean, you can see it in the body language.
[2:14:54.540 --> 2:14:55.540]  He's taking the step.
[2:14:55.540 --> 2:14:59.620]  He says, only thing I fear is my father, God.
[2:14:59.620 --> 2:15:01.260]  He's a prophetical voice right now.
[2:15:01.260 --> 2:15:06.580]  Now listen, you got Brad Pitt, once again, Tupac, once again, had that ability to cross
[2:15:06.580 --> 2:15:09.380]  over culturally.
[2:15:09.380 --> 2:15:13.740]  You have Brad Pitt showing up at his church talking about he's changed his opinion on
[2:15:13.740 --> 2:15:14.740]  God.
[2:15:14.740 --> 2:15:20.780]  Kanye West, he's in the target right now.
[2:15:20.780 --> 2:15:23.940]  I'm praying for that brother every day.
[2:15:23.940 --> 2:15:29.060]  This is something that is a phenom right now in our culture.
[2:15:29.060 --> 2:15:31.780]  It's probably the last thing the Democrats thought would happen.
[2:15:31.780 --> 2:15:34.140]  By the way, I'm not bragging, but Kanye does.
[2:15:34.140 --> 2:15:37.500]  I confirm, listen, almost every day to at least some of the shows.
[2:15:37.500 --> 2:15:39.340]  So it's a good chance we get this message to him.
[2:15:39.340 --> 2:15:42.900]  I want to get your message to Kanye West because you're right, he's under a big attack
[2:15:42.900 --> 2:15:43.900]  right now.
[2:15:43.900 --> 2:15:47.660]  They do this fake attack saying he's not for real, no, ladies and gentlemen, he is for
[2:15:47.660 --> 2:15:48.660]  real.
[2:15:48.660 --> 2:15:51.860]  And what he's saying puts him in a lot of danger and we've got to support that and praise
[2:15:51.860 --> 2:15:54.340]  that because he's putting his skin completely in the game.
[2:15:54.340 --> 2:15:59.100]  Well, they're right back with Reverend Childress on the other side, then your phone calls and
[2:15:59.100 --> 2:16:00.100]  more.
[2:16:00.100 --> 2:16:02.940]  By the way, impeachment against Trump is now live.
[2:16:02.940 --> 2:16:07.980]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector
[2:16:07.980 --> 2:16:09.740]  without all the speculation.
[2:16:09.740 --> 2:16:14.980]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[2:16:14.980 --> 2:16:19.340]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment
[2:16:19.340 --> 2:16:23.940]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace inspired by entrepreneurs who
[2:16:23.940 --> 2:16:26.020]  sold picks and shovels during the gold rush.
[2:16:26.020 --> 2:16:29.980]  The money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital
[2:16:29.980 --> 2:16:32.820]  assets, not a security IPO or note.
[2:16:32.820 --> 2:16:37.900]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27%
[2:16:37.900 --> 2:16:42.100]  annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[2:16:42.100 --> 2:16:43.100]  Don't miss this one.

[2:16:57.540 --> 2:16:59.980]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[2:16:59.980 --> 2:17:04.100]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.

[2:18:13.620 --> 2:18:17.060]  There's a lot of factors that go into this and I'm not telling you something that you

[2:19:05.260 --> 2:19:07.340]  The Alex Jones Show.
[2:19:07.340 --> 2:19:12.740]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook.
[2:19:12.740 --> 2:19:17.460]  She said, Dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table and I clicked on iodine and
[2:19:17.460 --> 2:19:22.500]  it says that 2 billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth because
[2:19:22.500 --> 2:19:23.740]  they didn't get enough iodine.
[2:19:23.740 --> 2:19:27.420]  That's what you say all the time, but I've heard people say you're crazy and it's not
[2:19:27.420 --> 2:19:32.100]  true, but Dad, it's right here on the periodic table when I click it saying exactly what
[2:19:32.100 --> 2:19:33.100]  you said.
[2:19:33.100 --> 2:19:37.740]  I said, I know, honey, that's why I have you take the high-quality, nutraceutical grade
[2:19:37.740 --> 2:19:42.580]  iodine is because it's why you're so vibrant, it's why you're so alive.
[2:19:42.580 --> 2:19:47.580]  It's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier and smarter than most of the kids
[2:19:47.580 --> 2:19:48.580]  you're age.
[2:19:48.580 --> 2:19:54.220]  And it just really blew her away to read it there for herself and to know that 2 billion
[2:19:54.220 --> 2:19:58.620]  people, ladies and gentlemen, 2 billion are mentally retarded on the face of the Earth
[2:19:58.620 --> 2:20:01.100]  right now because of iodine deficiency.
[2:20:01.100 --> 2:20:08.260]  Watch it and find out for yourself now, infowars.com.
[2:20:08.260 --> 2:20:29.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:29.060 --> 2:20:36.380]  It's an anti-human agenda and it's so evil, people have trouble believing it, but as soon
[2:20:36.380 --> 2:20:39.820]  as you research and you find out how real it is and Reverend Childress has made films,
[2:20:39.820 --> 2:20:46.820]  he's testified to Congress, he's tried to go convict the spirits of particularly black
[2:20:46.820 --> 2:20:51.100]  congressional leaders about the genocide going on and he'll be with us a little bit at the
[2:20:51.100 --> 2:20:54.420]  next segment and I promise I'm going to give to every caller or host some of the next hour
[2:20:54.420 --> 2:20:56.300]  before Matt Bracken takes over.
[2:20:56.300 --> 2:21:00.300]  He's going to be really ready to break down how serious this is and what curb balls he
[2:21:00.300 --> 2:21:04.500]  expects the deep state to throw, false flags to try to trigger a race war.
[2:21:04.500 --> 2:21:09.780]  You can just smell it, you can see it politically, but in the spirit you can feel it and as Reverend
[2:21:09.780 --> 2:21:13.500]  Childress has been coming on like 15 years, I've never heard him make a term like it's
[2:21:13.500 --> 2:21:15.820]  true that there's a disturbance in the force.
[2:21:15.820 --> 2:21:19.060]  Well that's just Hollywood trying to rip off what's already really there, the gut, the
[2:21:19.060 --> 2:21:21.060]  spirit, the sixth sense has been proven.
[2:21:21.060 --> 2:21:22.060]  You can just feel it.
[2:21:22.060 --> 2:21:28.620]  I mean I'll be honest, I mean I feel loving, I feel loved more than ever, but I really
[2:21:28.620 --> 2:21:35.180]  also feel real anger and I have to physically hold back wanting to go after these people
[2:21:35.180 --> 2:21:38.860]  and the things they're doing and the Satanism they're openly conducting and saying yeah
[2:21:38.860 --> 2:21:43.340]  we kill babies after they're born, the normal thing to do when a governor says we're killing
[2:21:43.340 --> 2:21:46.940]  babies after they're born or before they're born is to go after them and I'm not saying
[2:21:46.940 --> 2:21:50.620]  go after them because they got it set up where they can misrepresent it where it's bad if
[2:21:50.620 --> 2:21:55.540]  you go stop a governor killing hundreds of thousands of kids, but he kills little babies
[2:21:55.540 --> 2:21:59.340]  who don't deserve it and he's a good man.
[2:21:59.340 --> 2:22:02.860]  So I'm not a liar folks and I'm not somebody calling for violence, but I'm getting to the
[2:22:02.860 --> 2:22:06.820]  point here and I see that's what they're going to state stuff though, they know it has to
[2:22:06.820 --> 2:22:09.820]  happen soon, they're going to do it on their terms and they're going to make us look like
[2:22:09.820 --> 2:22:10.820]  the bad guys.
[2:22:10.820 --> 2:22:16.980]  So don't pull the trigger first, whoever pulls the trigger first loses, shot her around the
[2:22:16.980 --> 2:22:19.260]  world with the red coats, they pull the trigger first.
[2:22:19.260 --> 2:22:22.820]  We don't want violence and I'm telling you folks they're already violent against their
[2:22:22.820 --> 2:22:26.860]  unborn or born and I'm sick of it, I'm going to stop ranting, remember shoulders, let's
[2:22:26.860 --> 2:22:30.740]  play the couple about Connie and how about Alex Jones woke level and in the same speech
[2:22:30.740 --> 2:22:35.420]  he gets into, they're targeting blacks for extermination, Planned Parenthood in the neighborhoods,
[2:22:35.420 --> 2:22:39.540]  I mean this is coffin nails to the satanic agenda here it is.
[2:22:39.540 --> 2:22:45.100]  Man come on man, ain't finna go Alex Jones level with y'all man, come on man, what y'all
[2:22:45.100 --> 2:22:52.540]  like, wake up, wake up Mr. West, wake up culture, wake up, everybody think they so woke but
[2:22:52.540 --> 2:22:55.220]  they following the rules of what woke supposed to be.
[2:22:55.220 --> 2:23:03.900]  We brainwashed out here bro, come on man, this is a free man talking.
[2:23:03.900 --> 2:23:08.300]  Democrats had his vote and Democrats have food stamps for years bro, what are you talking
[2:23:08.300 --> 2:23:15.300]  about, guns in the 80s, taking the fathers out the home, Planned B, lowering our votes,
[2:23:15.300 --> 2:23:22.940]  making us on board our children, gosh and that killed.
[2:23:22.940 --> 2:23:26.660]  Reverend Childress this is historic and the enemy knows, I think the enemy knows they're
[2:23:26.660 --> 2:23:30.300]  losing, that's why they're launching full out attacks, have you seen all the Satanism
[2:23:30.300 --> 2:23:34.660]  stuff of simulated murdering babies, the amount of women and these are the folks that are
[2:23:34.660 --> 2:23:38.780]  literally getting into the schools with our kids, I mean, what would you call this period
[2:23:38.780 --> 2:23:41.420]  of time we're in right now?
[2:23:41.420 --> 2:23:45.980]  The battle for the soul completely and the battle for the country, it has come to be
[2:23:45.980 --> 2:23:51.460]  our political and spiritual armageddon prior to the real one.
[2:23:51.460 --> 2:23:59.180]  This is 2020, going into 2020 should be activism, activism, activism, you said go after them,
[2:23:59.180 --> 2:24:03.300]  how do we go after them, we do, we have to go after them in their face, we have to be
[2:24:03.300 --> 2:24:09.460]  on their steps, we have to be, I'm going to the museum in February 16th at the African
[2:24:09.460 --> 2:24:15.740]  Heritage Museum because they keep hiding eugenics and the story of Planned Parenthood there
[2:24:15.740 --> 2:24:21.180]  and so we're going to lead a protest there, it's the way we're going to hit back whenever
[2:24:21.180 --> 2:24:23.940]  we can with the resources we have.
[2:24:23.940 --> 2:24:29.740]  But our message is resonating, their message is depleting, it's being exposed and you're
[2:24:29.740 --> 2:24:35.860]  absolutely right, if we lay back now, we're done, they're coming with some probably is
[2:24:35.860 --> 2:24:40.100]  going to be so demonic, so evil and yet they're not ashamed.
[2:24:40.100 --> 2:24:47.060]  Look at the Cortez did not rebuke the woman or say or step away from that conversation
[2:24:47.060 --> 2:24:51.100]  when the lady stands up at her meeting and says, we have to start eating children.
[2:24:51.100 --> 2:24:54.740]  Now I would have addressed that right there, any human being should have addressed that,
[2:24:54.740 --> 2:24:57.420]  well, that's not where you hear about that, she didn't say a word.
[2:24:57.420 --> 2:25:00.780]  Again, all that LaRouche lady was doing was quoting what they've said, they're saying
[2:25:00.780 --> 2:25:05.860]  start eating dead bodies, don't have kids, humans are better, we need to eat the babies,
[2:25:05.860 --> 2:25:09.860]  we'll play that when we come back, exactly, I'm glad you raised that and the news is,
[2:25:09.860 --> 2:25:16.500]  oh, that's fake, but the response of AOC isn't, she's nodding her head to this insanity.
[2:25:16.500 --> 2:25:24.780]  Right, I don't, Kanye has to be prayerful because you get extremely frustrated watching
[2:25:24.780 --> 2:25:29.940]  why people won't respond and see the depths of evil this is and step away from it.
[2:25:29.940 --> 2:25:33.780]  And that's Kanye's frustration right now, he says, I'm only being real, I'm only being
[2:25:33.780 --> 2:25:39.900]  logical, I'm being objective, I choose my friends, I choose my political views, you
[2:25:39.900 --> 2:25:45.580]  do not choose for me, but they've had it that way so long, they are in the total derision
[2:25:45.580 --> 2:25:49.020]  right now, but they're planning something big and you just raised something, I guess
[2:25:49.020 --> 2:25:51.020]  you're picking it up for me.
[2:25:51.020 --> 2:25:56.300]  No, I mean, you're picking up how angry I am, obviously you are as well, they're so
[2:25:56.300 --> 2:26:01.340]  evil, it's like they're trying to provoke us and they're just flaunting and then other
[2:26:01.340 --> 2:26:05.940]  people are asleep and we can't believe that it should be easy to beat this, I mean, this
[2:26:05.940 --> 2:26:06.940]  is crazy.
[2:26:06.940 --> 2:26:13.780]  Absolutely, and it's frustrating for me and I've been in it for a while and I gotta
[2:26:13.780 --> 2:26:20.980]  thank God for the little incremental progress I see, it should be a total wave at this point,
[2:26:20.980 --> 2:26:28.260]  but they see it, trust me, our foes see it, and I shun to think what they're going to
[2:26:28.260 --> 2:26:35.100]  do to set him up, to set up others, his family, anyone that's identified with Donald Trump
[2:26:35.100 --> 2:26:40.340]  right now is in the crosshairs, probably no more so than Kanye West at this point.
[2:26:40.340 --> 2:26:44.780]  No, I agree, because Trump and his family and people like myself have been really in
[2:26:44.780 --> 2:26:49.100]  the crosshairs, but I can tell you, they're now more afraid of Kanye West than they are
[2:26:49.100 --> 2:26:55.980]  of Alex Jones, because Kanye, as you said, can absolutely get people off the plantation.
[2:26:55.980 --> 2:27:02.460]  Yes, that's exactly, he's going to be the net turner they fear and he's unquestionably,
[2:27:02.460 --> 2:27:06.780]  I don't think he asked for this, I think if you watched how all this happens, it kind
[2:27:06.780 --> 2:27:12.060]  of evolved, that's a good thing about this, it's not like he's trying to see a program
[2:27:12.060 --> 2:27:18.020]  or trying to have a platform on this, it just because he was being himself, he got out there
[2:27:18.020 --> 2:27:27.180]  and that's a God thing to me, and this is what Jay-Z wanted to do with Obama and Hillary,
[2:27:27.180 --> 2:27:34.900]  this is what they cloned him for, and now what has happened is, a protege, so to speak,
[2:27:34.900 --> 2:27:39.060]  has usurped his influence and is shaking the nation.
[2:27:39.060 --> 2:27:45.900]  This is what Jay-Z was supposed to do for Obama and Hillary, didn't work out, but Kanye,
[2:27:45.900 --> 2:27:54.420]  my goodness, I mean, from prison reform, the lowest black unemployment in history, education,
[2:27:54.420 --> 2:28:00.540]  opportunity zones, I mean, people are now looking at this.
[2:28:00.540 --> 2:28:03.700]  Trump is like a Moses figure.
[2:28:03.700 --> 2:28:11.940]  Right now, he's going past my expectations, I knew he was the man, but really, I never
[2:28:11.940 --> 2:28:14.780]  thought he would make the progress in the years.
[2:28:14.780 --> 2:28:19.100]  But like you said, the Lord works in mysterious ways, they try this with Jay-Z, they try it
[2:28:19.100 --> 2:28:26.340]  with people, you know, big NBA stars like LeBron James, but none of that catches because
[2:28:26.340 --> 2:28:30.060]  Hillary's a damn demon, I put that picture back up her, I mean, Hillary looks like a
[2:28:30.060 --> 2:28:34.420]  jack-o-lantern demon, my God, and just none of it's working, and then boom, Kanye's not
[2:28:34.420 --> 2:28:38.420]  even trying and he's scaring the hell out of him and totally changing minds.
[2:28:38.420 --> 2:28:44.620]  Totally, absolutely, no question about it, to show you how bad it is, Hillary is thinking
[2:28:44.620 --> 2:28:50.420]  about coming back, this is how depleted and how they have no message, I've never seen
[2:28:50.420 --> 2:28:54.260]  a party with absolutely, totally no message.
[2:28:54.260 --> 2:28:57.820]  But they have blackmail and they have threats and they're going after the Senate, I believe
[2:28:57.820 --> 2:29:00.860]  they will impeach Trump in the House and then the battle is going to be the Senate,
[2:29:00.860 --> 2:29:04.300]  we'll finish up Reverend Childress and your phone call straight ahead, stay with us.

[2:32:05.580 --> 2:32:09.740]  The time has come to defy the thought police.
[2:32:09.740 --> 2:32:13.260]  They are banning hundreds and hundreds of symbols every year.
[2:32:13.260 --> 2:32:18.620]  They're waging war on communication itself as the Fabian Socialists promised they would
[2:32:18.620 --> 2:32:22.740]  do more than 70 years ago from their command base in England.
[2:32:22.740 --> 2:32:29.180]  We've had Oxford come out and ban clapping, the ADL and others will literally bankrupt
[2:32:29.180 --> 2:32:32.940]  you, kick you out of college, destroy you, have you arrested in some areas.
[2:32:32.940 --> 2:32:38.940]  If you do the OK symbol, that's the international sign language symbol for OK, they know what
[2:32:38.940 --> 2:32:40.100]  they're doing.
[2:32:40.100 --> 2:32:44.740]  These people are authoritarians and they're dangerous and the answer to their attack on
[2:32:44.740 --> 2:32:47.460]  speech is to exercise it in their face.
[2:32:47.460 --> 2:32:52.620]  We have a it's OK to be OK politically incorrect ball cap, it's black and white, very nice
[2:32:52.620 --> 2:32:57.260]  as the OK symbol on it, it's a great way to start conversations, infowars.com is on the
[2:32:57.260 --> 2:32:58.260]  back.
[2:32:58.260 --> 2:33:02.780]  Get yours today at infowarstore.com and support free speech by supporting Info Wars while
[2:33:02.780 --> 2:33:08.140]  having a great hat.
[2:33:08.140 --> 2:33:23.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, you found it, the tip of the spear, it is the
[2:33:23.020 --> 2:33:24.900]  Alex Jones show.
[2:33:24.900 --> 2:33:31.860]  So here's AOC, our ladies saying we got to eat the babies to save the earth.
[2:33:31.860 --> 2:33:36.700]  Well, they're, so they're nodding whether here it is, we have a few months left.
[2:33:36.700 --> 2:33:41.100]  I love that you support the green deal, but it's not getting, you know, getting rid of
[2:33:41.100 --> 2:33:44.620]  fossil fuel is not going to solve the problem fast enough.
[2:33:44.620 --> 2:33:49.780]  A Swedish professor saying, you know, we can eat dead people, but that's not fast enough.
[2:33:49.780 --> 2:33:55.540]  So I think your next campaign slogan has to be this, we got to start eating babies.
[2:33:55.540 --> 2:34:02.340]  We don't have enough time, there's too much CO2, all of you, you know, you're pollutant,
[2:34:02.340 --> 2:34:03.860]  too much CO2.
[2:34:03.860 --> 2:34:09.060]  We have to start now, please, you are so great, I'm so happy that you're really supporting
[2:34:09.060 --> 2:34:11.660]  the green deal, but it's not enough.
[2:34:11.660 --> 2:34:17.380]  You know, even if we would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution.
[2:34:17.380 --> 2:34:20.620]  So we have to get rid of the babies.
[2:34:20.620 --> 2:34:22.140]  That's a big problem.
[2:34:22.140 --> 2:34:29.220]  Just stopping having babies aside and not, we need to eat the babies and then again worldwide
[2:34:29.220 --> 2:34:34.500]  they have these armies, many of them convicted pedophiles that dress like demonic clowns
[2:34:34.500 --> 2:34:37.980]  and then go out and scare the hell out of kids, unannounced at some schools without
[2:34:37.980 --> 2:34:43.140]  parents knowing, and then if the person identifies as a woman, we are supposed to go, that's
[2:34:43.140 --> 2:34:45.820]  not a demon psycho, that's a woman.
[2:34:45.820 --> 2:34:50.860]  The new definition of a woman is a person simulating ripping a baby out of their womb
[2:34:50.860 --> 2:34:57.980]  when it's a man and drinking the blood and torturing the baby, but then meanwhile we
[2:34:57.980 --> 2:35:03.940]  really are keeping babies alive outside of the womb to later harvest their organs.
[2:35:03.940 --> 2:35:05.460]  So there's no level of horror.
[2:35:05.460 --> 2:35:11.460]  Here, let's hear the audio of this, go ahead and fade it up.
[2:35:11.460 --> 2:35:17.460]  That's what's going on in New York City folks.
[2:35:17.460 --> 2:35:24.980]  And by the way, we looked this guy up, he does support drag queens for a time, we found
[2:35:24.980 --> 2:35:26.620]  photos where it looks like he's at those.
[2:35:26.620 --> 2:35:33.980]  So this fella is going to drop by, look at that trophy, that dead baby.
[2:35:33.980 --> 2:35:38.220]  Now play the big compilation we've got of the mainstream media celebrating, kill babies,
[2:35:38.220 --> 2:35:47.300]  it's fun, teach them, make them submit, it's good to bully those babies.
[2:35:47.300 --> 2:35:51.740]  Look at that face, look at that demon, look at that mental illness.
[2:35:51.740 --> 2:35:55.380]  You know we don't want to look at this folks, radio listeners are lucky they're not seeing
[2:35:55.380 --> 2:35:56.380]  it.
[2:35:56.380 --> 2:36:01.100]  We share it because that's who these folks are, but that's a lady, you can't talk bad
[2:36:01.100 --> 2:36:03.980]  about a lady as she simulates drinking baby blood.
[2:36:03.980 --> 2:36:09.620]  By the way, it's not for Halloween, this dude does this year round.
[2:36:09.620 --> 2:36:15.500]  Pure Satanism on the Instagram, pull it up yourself and that's in between, I guess, visiting
[2:36:15.500 --> 2:36:16.500]  your children.
[2:36:16.500 --> 2:36:23.940]  And again, Desmond is amazing, 9-10-11 would dance at Pito bars, we have a new thing, police
[2:36:23.940 --> 2:36:32.980]  won't do anything in New York again, and with convicted murderers and people handling him
[2:36:32.980 --> 2:36:33.980]  as his handlers.
[2:36:33.980 --> 2:36:41.460]  And he talks about how he takes for him and all, and how he takes other drugs with adults.
[2:36:41.460 --> 2:36:46.460]  It's like, well, it's art when it's a little boy, but if they had a little 10-year-old
[2:36:46.460 --> 2:36:52.580]  girl at that of his, oh see, that's what it gets, you know, to buck up, get tough, you
[2:36:52.580 --> 2:36:59.140]  know, like on the pedophiles of the Catholic Church and 3000 plus priests admitted in Pennsylvania
[2:36:59.140 --> 2:37:05.980]  that they would have satanic rituals with little children and rape them.
[2:37:05.980 --> 2:37:09.540]  This is mass industrial, Reverend Childress is going to leave us here in a few minutes,
[2:37:09.540 --> 2:37:13.900]  but I wanted him to be able to just finish talking about Kanye West because it is a
[2:37:13.900 --> 2:37:19.420]  big deal, folks, you know, what he's doing, and I think it's a lot bigger than him just
[2:37:19.420 --> 2:37:21.020]  trying to get a Christian market.
[2:37:21.020 --> 2:37:25.220]  He knows you talk about Jesus and you talk about aborting babies.
[2:37:25.220 --> 2:37:30.380]  The left comes after you, especially if you're an icon, and this is a big deal, and I didn't
[2:37:30.380 --> 2:37:31.380]  know about the Brad Pitt.
[2:37:31.380 --> 2:37:34.340]  Tell me about, what's going on with Brad Pitt, Reverend Childress?
[2:37:34.340 --> 2:37:40.700]  Well, shockingly, you know, he's an atheist, and you know that, I didn't know his parents
[2:37:40.700 --> 2:37:46.260]  were missionaries or something along that line, but he just recently went to Kanye
[2:37:46.260 --> 2:37:52.980]  West Church, felt that he had to change his position on God, and that he was now seeking
[2:37:52.980 --> 2:37:59.780]  after God, seeking, I guess, Christ, because Kanye says Christ is king.
[2:37:59.780 --> 2:38:05.940]  So this was undoubtedly, you know, just, it was shocking to me for Brad Pitt, you know,
[2:38:05.940 --> 2:38:13.700]  I had my evaluation on Brad Pitt, but obviously he's come to an end of himself, it's just
[2:38:13.700 --> 2:38:19.060]  to make that comment, living all your life in atheists and bragging about it, now saying
[2:38:19.060 --> 2:38:23.780]  he was wrong, but it was from Kanye West, and once again, that's a crossover culturally.
[2:38:23.780 --> 2:38:30.300]  Kanye West is very dangerous right now to the Democrats, that's, you have Hollywood
[2:38:30.300 --> 2:38:38.260]  acknowledging him, when Hollywood usually supports the Democratic mantras, narratives and everything
[2:38:38.260 --> 2:38:39.860]  they wanna do.
[2:38:39.860 --> 2:38:44.420]  This is really amazing in these times, it's a God thing, and I just wanna play my role
[2:38:44.420 --> 2:38:49.180]  to everything I'm supposed to do, but I'm having fun watching others and other situations
[2:38:49.180 --> 2:38:50.180]  come up.
[2:38:50.180 --> 2:38:54.740]  I totally agree with you, and we get frustrated seeing the evil, but the evil's coming out
[2:38:54.740 --> 2:39:00.340]  from the rocks because it's throwing a fit, it's being exercised, it knows it's in trouble,
[2:39:00.340 --> 2:39:04.180]  so it's trying to hurry up and normalize it and hopes we'll give up and give in, but
[2:39:04.180 --> 2:39:08.140]  all it's doing is enraging us, and that's how evil fails throughout history.
[2:39:08.140 --> 2:39:13.460]  It thinks that we're like its minions, and that we're intimidated by it, and that is
[2:39:13.460 --> 2:39:15.100]  not what's happening.
[2:39:15.100 --> 2:39:21.540]  The campaign to normalize it, just as you said, is up another level, shockingly, they
[2:39:21.540 --> 2:39:29.500]  feel they're just gonna ram it down, the academia, the public square, Hollywood, of course, that
[2:39:29.500 --> 2:39:34.340]  clip you just played, people have to understand that was somebody's business, where this guy
[2:39:34.340 --> 2:39:39.180]  was right across the river from me, and I'm saying to myself, they are just gonna, but
[2:39:39.180 --> 2:39:46.380]  you know, Andrew Como and his legislation of infanticide, this is in your face time,
[2:39:46.380 --> 2:39:49.740]  and we have to be in their face, but we're winning, we're winning.
[2:39:49.740 --> 2:39:54.300]  You're right, I just, I wish Trump would do something about the censorship, now they're
[2:39:54.300 --> 2:39:57.340]  gonna ban all political ads, well they're gonna let the Democrats run their ads, now
[2:39:57.340 --> 2:40:01.740]  they're already silencing Republican candidates ads on Twitter, starting tomorrow, I mean,
[2:40:01.740 --> 2:40:02.740]  this is dangerous.
[2:40:02.740 --> 2:40:06.940]  I can't believe he's gonna let that, I think he's planning something, but when he does
[2:40:06.940 --> 2:40:10.140]  it, it's gonna have to be able to stick and move forward.
[2:40:10.140 --> 2:40:16.620]  He knows that would basically begin to stymie and unquestionably hinder this wave that's
[2:40:16.620 --> 2:40:23.660]  going on right now, they're in a complete panic right now, I mean, it's like their
[2:40:23.660 --> 2:40:30.900]  worst nightmares are appearing, and so we have to be bold, we have to be the lions,
[2:40:30.900 --> 2:40:36.740]  we have to be in the public square, we have to be at PTA board meetings, and we have to
[2:40:36.740 --> 2:40:43.220]  be at town meetings when there's something that's being imposed upon us that is not of
[2:40:43.220 --> 2:40:45.260]  our Judeo-Christian ethic.
[2:40:45.260 --> 2:40:50.500]  And we've got to share your website, our website, and our own internet, like Drudge
[2:40:50.500 --> 2:40:54.420]  always warned, build your own infrastructure, like you've done, like genocide.org, in the
[2:40:54.420 --> 2:41:00.260]  great film you produced, exposing all this, folks, every person you wake up is so critical,
[2:41:00.260 --> 2:41:03.580]  every link you share is so critical, and now more than ever, people are looking for the
[2:41:03.580 --> 2:41:08.020]  truth, so share blackgenocide.org, infowars.com and newswars.com.
[2:41:08.020 --> 2:41:10.660]  Thank you, Reverend Childress, and God bless you.
[2:41:10.660 --> 2:41:11.660]  Thank you so much, sir.
[2:41:11.660 --> 2:41:12.660]  God bless.
[2:41:12.660 --> 2:41:16.220]  And you're in Texas in January, we want to get you here in studio.
[2:41:16.220 --> 2:41:17.220]  You got it.
[2:41:17.220 --> 2:41:18.220]  All right, you're awesome.
[2:41:18.220 --> 2:41:21.220]  I think he's been here before, too, or we went and interviewed him up there, that's
[2:41:21.220 --> 2:41:23.860]  where I met him, years ago, for a film.
[2:41:23.860 --> 2:41:27.260]  Okay, folks, I'm gonna go to break, and I promise I'm gonna go bam, bam, bam through
[2:41:27.260 --> 2:41:32.860]  your calls, about 15 minutes to the next hour, and then that bracket on the author, researcher,
[2:41:32.860 --> 2:41:36.340]  former Navy SEAL, a really smart guy about their false flags, he's gonna be responding
[2:41:36.340 --> 2:41:40.980]  to an official impeachment, proceedings have been initiated, they had a little kangaroo
[2:41:40.980 --> 2:41:44.620]  deal to cook it up, they've got training wheels, now they're gonna start rolling this sucker
[2:41:44.620 --> 2:41:54.020]  out, and it just makes my blood boil, because you go to a Democrat event, they look like
[2:41:54.020 --> 2:41:58.260]  a collection of child molesters, devil worshipers, and mentally ill people, and you go to a Republican
[2:41:58.260 --> 2:42:01.260]  event, it looks like good hard work, and decent people with every race, color, and
[2:42:01.260 --> 2:42:02.260]  creative.
[2:42:02.260 --> 2:42:03.260]  I mean, it's just simple.
[2:42:03.260 --> 2:42:04.580]  These people are scum, okay?
[2:42:04.580 --> 2:42:09.060]  There are enemies, period, and everybody just better get, it's worse than I even know.
[2:42:09.060 --> 2:42:13.620]  There is no depth to these people, they are trash, and I don't know how anyone does it
[2:42:13.620 --> 2:42:18.580]  spend all their time fighting these people, and I'll say this, I get so focused on newsdays
[2:42:18.580 --> 2:42:21.540]  like this, and I don't even plug and promote the products, and we're gonna go bankrupt
[2:42:21.540 --> 2:42:25.860]  if we don't have your support, and we'll get shut down, so I'm gonna tell you right
[2:42:25.860 --> 2:42:30.420]  now, I need a lot of money in a war chest into the future, no matter what they do to
[2:42:30.420 --> 2:42:33.660]  stay on air, to put airplanes in the air with messages, to a bunch of stuff I'm planning
[2:42:33.660 --> 2:42:39.180]  to pull, and I wanna hire a bunch more reporters going to 2020, we've got a lot of plans, but
[2:42:39.180 --> 2:42:43.620]  it takes money, and we've got products you need, so the store-wide free shipping, double
[2:42:43.620 --> 2:42:48.540]  patriot points, 40, 70% off, it's gotta end on a whole bunch of items this weekend because
[2:42:48.540 --> 2:42:53.660]  they're selling out, you need to get them at infowarstore.com, like the parasite cleanse,
[2:42:53.660 --> 2:42:58.820]  living defense, the big iodine challenge, 60% off the X2, the X3, the biodrislinium,
[2:42:58.820 --> 2:43:04.340]  60% off, that's all got again, but a lot of stuff came back in like DNA Force Plus.
[2:43:04.340 --> 2:43:06.420]  The Alex Jones Show.
[2:43:06.420 --> 2:43:11.780]  A few days ago, my 11-year-old daughter came to me, and she had her digital textbook, and
[2:43:11.780 --> 2:43:16.500]  she said, dad, they're teaching us about the periodic table, and I clicked on iodine, and
[2:43:16.500 --> 2:43:21.380]  it says that two billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet Earth
[2:43:21.380 --> 2:43:24.980]  because they didn't get enough iodine, that's what you say all the time, but I've heard
[2:43:24.980 --> 2:43:29.420]  people say you're crazy, and it's not true, but dad, it's right here on the periodic table
[2:43:29.420 --> 2:43:34.180]  when I click it saying exactly what you said, and I said, I know, honey, that's why I have
[2:43:34.180 --> 2:43:39.780]  you take the high-quality, nutraceutical grade iodine is because it's why you're so
[2:43:39.780 --> 2:43:45.460]  vibrant, it's why you're so alive, it's one of the reasons that you're so much healthier
[2:43:45.460 --> 2:43:49.980]  and smarter than most of the kids you're age, and it just really blew her away to read it
[2:43:49.980 --> 2:43:55.460]  there for herself, and to know that two billion people, ladies and gentlemen, two billion
[2:43:55.460 --> 2:44:00.180]  are mentally retarded on the face of the Earth right now because of iodine deficiency.
[2:44:00.180 --> 2:44:02.260]  Research it and find out for yourself now.
[2:44:02.260 --> 2:44:04.140]  Infowars.com.
[2:44:04.140 --> 2:44:08.500]  We have strong disagreement on policy grounds, and I hope there's diversity in policy here.
[2:44:08.500 --> 2:44:12.780]  I don't care what your views are, I hope you articulate them and defend them and listen
[2:44:12.780 --> 2:44:15.900]  and debate them, that's important, but we have something in common.
[2:44:15.900 --> 2:44:19.980]  We have a set of values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together.
[2:44:19.980 --> 2:44:25.260]  Clinton deep state bag man, Comey, thinks it's funny that he was the leaker, and that he
[2:44:25.260 --> 2:44:27.180]  lied to Congress and the world.
[2:44:27.180 --> 2:44:31.460]  He thinks committing crimes are funny, and he thinks if he acts confident, he won't
[2:44:31.460 --> 2:44:32.460]  get indicted.
[2:44:32.460 --> 2:44:37.460]  But where it is, the criminal investigation is honing in on him.
[2:44:37.460 --> 2:44:40.460]  From my new home in New Zealand, I will.
[2:44:40.460 --> 2:44:45.740]  Oh, and now suddenly he's talking about moving to New Zealand.
[2:44:45.740 --> 2:44:47.660]  Not so fast, criminal.
[2:44:47.660 --> 2:44:51.580]  We're going to bring you to justice, and we're going to bring Hillary to justice as well.
[2:44:51.580 --> 2:44:56.860]  Because if we don't, you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy, but the American
[2:44:56.860 --> 2:45:02.460]  people know how much you hate us, and we're fighting back at Infowars.com, NewsWars.com,
[2:45:02.460 --> 2:45:03.460]  and band.video.
[2:45:03.460 --> 2:45:04.460]  Hey, Steve.
[2:45:04.460 --> 2:45:05.460]  How you doing?
[2:45:05.460 --> 2:45:11.100]  Hey, Alex, oh my God, longtime listener, first-time caller.
[2:45:11.100 --> 2:45:16.660]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital, I went to VA hospital out here in Boise, and
[2:45:16.660 --> 2:45:21.060]  I was in there until June, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living
[2:45:21.060 --> 2:45:22.060]  defense.
[2:45:22.060 --> 2:45:23.060]  Let me tell you something, man.
[2:45:23.060 --> 2:45:28.260]  I had an internal digestive problem, and I stuck with it for about five or six years,
[2:45:28.260 --> 2:45:30.820]  and the doctors, they tried every test.
[2:45:30.820 --> 2:45:34.500]  Nobody could figure out what it is, and then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr.
[2:45:34.500 --> 2:45:37.820]  Group and those commercials, I said, you know what, I'm going to get me some of that freaking
[2:45:37.820 --> 2:45:38.820]  living defense.
[2:45:38.820 --> 2:45:41.860]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have any stuff,
[2:45:41.860 --> 2:45:45.980]  but I ordered it, and it shipped to me, I got it, I hid it from the nurses, I started
[2:45:45.980 --> 2:45:50.060]  taking it, man, that stuff changed my life, it saved my life.
[2:45:50.060 --> 2:45:53.660]  If there's any veteran out there, I don't care if you've traveled, anybody's traveled
[2:45:53.660 --> 2:45:59.540]  overseas, you absolutely owe it to yourself to get two bottles of that living defense.
[2:45:59.540 --> 2:46:03.500]  It's true, folks, we don't sell anything unless it's the highest quality, and living
[2:46:03.500 --> 2:46:05.860]  defense is over the top good.
[2:46:05.860 --> 2:46:10.900]  All of our bodies are different, all of our metabolic systems are diverse.
[2:46:10.900 --> 2:46:13.900]  Some of us are deficient in some things and not in others.
[2:46:13.900 --> 2:46:17.340]  There's a lot of factors that go into this, and I'm not telling you something that you
[2:46:17.340 --> 2:46:20.700]  don't know, but I'm here to tell you.
[2:46:20.700 --> 2:46:28.340]  Every time I commit and use the supplements that we sell on a religious basis, my life
[2:46:28.340 --> 2:46:33.180]  completely changes, I'm healthier, I have more energy, I lose weight, I look better
[2:46:33.180 --> 2:46:34.900]  than everybody notices.
[2:46:34.900 --> 2:46:42.100]  Two months ago, I said on air, I am going to commit to take X2, body's ultimate turmeric,
[2:46:42.100 --> 2:46:47.540]  I'm going to commit to flush my gut out with the gut fusion from M4's life, and when I
[2:46:47.540 --> 2:46:52.140]  take these products, the results are nothing less than miraculous.
[2:46:52.140 --> 2:46:58.140]  Well, one product that's amazing that I use, I don't talk enough about is gut fusion, folks.
[2:46:58.140 --> 2:46:59.140]  Check it out.
[2:46:59.140 --> 2:47:00.140]  There's nothing else like it.
[2:47:00.140 --> 2:47:07.700]  It's 100% off right now, the sale's about to end, gutfusioninforstore.com.
[2:47:07.700 --> 2:47:18.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[2:47:18.820 --> 2:47:33.060]  By the way, welcome back, Alex Jones, everyone, right to your calls.
[2:47:33.060 --> 2:47:34.060]  Thank you for patiently holding.
[2:47:34.060 --> 2:47:38.580]  They just reminded me, I talked about this earlier in the week, and then I had one of
[2:47:38.580 --> 2:47:43.300]  the security guys come over and go, hey, Hillary Clinton's at Book People at Riverbend Center
[2:47:43.300 --> 2:47:48.700]  in downtown Austin, three to four PM this Sunday, are you going?
[2:47:48.700 --> 2:47:51.340]  Yes, I will be down there.
[2:47:51.340 --> 2:47:53.220]  I'm not going to attempt to go in there.
[2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:58.380]  The Secret Service would stop me once I stood in line for hours, but I'm going to be outside
[2:47:58.380 --> 2:48:05.180]  and I'm going to show you how vicious and evil and hateful her nasty supporters are.
[2:48:05.180 --> 2:48:09.900]  And so I'm going to go out and engage these people anywhere I can to show who they are
[2:48:09.900 --> 2:48:11.780]  and what they're doing.
[2:48:11.780 --> 2:48:15.820]  And there's going to be, obviously, a lot of other folks, but she's calling it the
[2:48:15.820 --> 2:48:21.060]  Book of Gutsy Women always uses the woman thing to hide behind.
[2:48:21.060 --> 2:48:22.060]  She's a monster.
[2:48:22.060 --> 2:48:27.460]  She's an evil, evil witch involved with Jeffrey Epstein and every other form of evil you
[2:48:27.460 --> 2:48:28.900]  can imagine.
[2:48:28.900 --> 2:48:31.500]  And so these arrogant leftists think they've silenced us.
[2:48:31.500 --> 2:48:33.340]  They haven't silenced anything.
[2:48:33.340 --> 2:48:41.180]  So no matter where this monster goes, you need to go expose her and she can't stop you
[2:48:41.180 --> 2:48:47.820]  getting tickets or going in and saying Bill Clinton's a rapist and the head of your foundation
[2:48:47.820 --> 2:48:56.100]  was convicted for smuggling children out of Haiti and you're a monster and you're a criminal.
[2:48:56.100 --> 2:49:04.180]  She's running the whole impeachment against Trump right now.
[2:49:04.180 --> 2:49:11.460]  We got a bunch of neocon want to be Trump supporters that claim they represent Trump.
[2:49:11.460 --> 2:49:12.460]  They don't.
[2:49:12.460 --> 2:49:15.780]  They're out there pony it up, bowing down to Twitter and Facebook to stay on there.
[2:49:15.780 --> 2:49:16.780]  We don't give a rat.
[2:49:16.780 --> 2:49:17.780]  You know what?
[2:49:17.780 --> 2:49:21.780]  We're going to go out and we're going to expose these monsters everywhere they are and you
[2:49:21.780 --> 2:49:22.780]  need to too.
[2:49:22.780 --> 2:49:23.780]  It's fun.
[2:49:23.780 --> 2:49:24.780]  It's good.
[2:49:24.780 --> 2:49:32.780]  And it's going to happen.
[2:49:32.780 --> 2:49:53.900]  We've got the fire of victory and all you've got to do is throw it.
[2:49:53.900 --> 2:49:54.900]  It's forbidden.
[2:49:54.900 --> 2:49:55.900]  It's reboting.
[2:49:55.900 --> 2:49:58.420]  Find out what you're not supposed to hear.
[2:49:58.420 --> 2:50:01.300]  Tune into it.
[2:50:01.300 --> 2:50:03.940]  You're just as important as I am, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:50:03.940 --> 2:50:07.700]  In fact, more important because there's more of you than me.
[2:50:07.700 --> 2:50:08.700]  I need you.
[2:50:08.700 --> 2:50:10.420]  You need me.
[2:50:10.420 --> 2:50:12.940]  We don't like these devil worshipers.
[2:50:12.940 --> 2:50:19.980]  So let's face them and let's pray that God to bring judgment upon them for the innocent's
[2:50:19.980 --> 2:50:20.980]  sake.
[2:50:20.980 --> 2:50:21.980]  Okay.
[2:50:21.980 --> 2:50:22.980]  It's been on the longest.
[2:50:22.980 --> 2:50:23.980]  Is it Danny?
[2:50:23.980 --> 2:50:24.980]  Is it?
[2:50:24.980 --> 2:50:25.980]  Yeah.
[2:50:25.980 --> 2:50:30.460]  Yes, it's Danny and then Jason.
[2:50:30.460 --> 2:50:31.460]  Danny and Portland.
[2:50:31.460 --> 2:50:32.460]  An enemy stronghold.
[2:50:32.460 --> 2:50:33.460]  Danny, what's on your mind today?
[2:50:33.460 --> 2:50:34.460]  Thanks for holding.
[2:50:34.460 --> 2:50:37.820]  Hey, God bless you, Alex.
[2:50:37.820 --> 2:50:44.980]  God bless Donald Trump and God bless the Patriots, true Americans.
[2:50:44.980 --> 2:50:47.700]  So I just, I got a lot on my mind.
[2:50:47.700 --> 2:50:56.540]  Well, first I wanted to say, quote scripture, the wicked prowl on every side when vileness
[2:50:56.540 --> 2:51:01.540]  is exalted among the sons of men and that's all 12, 8, 10.
[2:51:01.540 --> 2:51:02.540]  Exactly.
[2:51:02.540 --> 2:51:03.540]  It's a ritual.
[2:51:03.540 --> 2:51:08.300]  They ex, and that's even in satanic, I don't mean fake Alistair Crowley stuff, but real
[2:51:08.300 --> 2:51:11.900]  satanic, you know, books and said, I went and read them, I looked at them, I mean, we're
[2:51:11.900 --> 2:51:15.820]  talking rare books and it's lesser magic.
[2:51:15.820 --> 2:51:20.380]  They do rituals in the open because subconsciously, you know what's going on.
[2:51:20.380 --> 2:51:21.460]  Consciously you don't.
[2:51:21.460 --> 2:51:23.380]  And that gives them great power, they believe.
[2:51:23.380 --> 2:51:24.380]  Sorry.
[2:51:24.380 --> 2:51:25.380]  Go ahead.
[2:51:25.380 --> 2:51:27.740]  Oh, yeah, exactly.
[2:51:27.740 --> 2:51:32.380]  Well, we're definitely seeing the vileness exalted.
[2:51:32.380 --> 2:51:36.260]  You know, I was, you know, already seeing it everywhere with the drag queen drag queen
[2:51:36.260 --> 2:51:43.860]  story time and then I've seen that video of the drag trans person cutting a baby out of
[2:51:43.860 --> 2:51:49.100]  their fake stomach and drinking the blood and people are laughing and filming and joking
[2:51:49.100 --> 2:51:50.100]  around.
[2:51:50.100 --> 2:51:54.340]  But it's that psychotic look that person can be in Hollywood playing a demon because they
[2:51:54.340 --> 2:51:55.340]  are.
[2:51:55.340 --> 2:52:00.180]  Oh, it's disgusting and that the fact that people laugh about it and think it's funny
[2:52:00.180 --> 2:52:05.420]  is that that's a clear sign that things are really, really in a bad spot right now.
[2:52:05.420 --> 2:52:09.780]  And I have noticed, and I talked to you the other day actually about this and here in
[2:52:09.780 --> 2:52:16.380]  Portland that it's not just myself, it's everyone is, and I'd say especially the people who
[2:52:16.380 --> 2:52:23.060]  are kind of blindly, sheepishly following the left, there's just a mass depression and
[2:52:23.060 --> 2:52:29.420]  a mass sense of dread that's something big or bad is happening or both.
[2:52:29.420 --> 2:52:35.660]  And I think it's just that we're on the precipice, as you like to say, of, you know, either it's
[2:52:35.660 --> 2:52:38.820]  going to get real good or real bad here in just a moment.
[2:52:38.820 --> 2:52:44.500]  And all I'm trying to do is say the red coats are coming one of the by land to it by sea
[2:52:44.500 --> 2:52:47.140]  instead of the Republican echo chamber that everything's fine.
[2:52:47.140 --> 2:52:49.700]  And I'm not being doom and gloom.
[2:52:49.700 --> 2:52:51.340]  People need to worry.
[2:52:51.340 --> 2:52:54.420]  Because everyone I knew said, oh, they'll never start official impeachment proceedings.
[2:52:54.420 --> 2:52:57.220]  Well, it just vote, it just happened today.
[2:52:57.220 --> 2:53:02.500]  And so I agree with Drudge showing what they're doing, showing how bad it is so people aren't
[2:53:02.500 --> 2:53:04.580]  delusional and so we do something.
[2:53:04.580 --> 2:53:06.100]  Does that make sense?
[2:53:06.100 --> 2:53:07.100]  Absolutely.
[2:53:07.100 --> 2:53:14.340]  I think people need to just get up and fight, you know, it's like watching someone who's
[2:53:14.340 --> 2:53:18.020]  just passively being beaten and spit on.
[2:53:18.020 --> 2:53:21.060]  And you just want to say, just get up and swaying, you know.
[2:53:21.060 --> 2:53:22.060]  Do something.
[2:53:22.060 --> 2:53:24.660]  Don't just sit there and take it, you know, that's what everybody's doing.
[2:53:24.660 --> 2:53:25.660]  They're sitting there.
[2:53:25.660 --> 2:53:26.660]  That's it.
[2:53:26.660 --> 2:53:27.660]  I don't want to take it.
[2:53:27.660 --> 2:53:28.660]  Exactly.
[2:53:28.660 --> 2:53:31.180]  I mean, I wanted to work 24 hours yesterday.
[2:53:31.180 --> 2:53:40.180]  I worked, I worked 20 hours yesterday and I didn't want to sleep, but I did a few hours
[2:53:40.180 --> 2:53:41.860]  and people are like, how do you have that much energy?
[2:53:41.860 --> 2:53:45.020]  Well, I had like four cups of coffee yesterday or he had two today.
[2:53:45.020 --> 2:53:47.780]  But I mean, it's not that it's the spirit wants to fight.
[2:53:47.780 --> 2:53:48.780]  The flesh is weak.
[2:53:48.780 --> 2:53:49.780]  The spirit wants to fight.
[2:53:49.780 --> 2:53:50.780]  God bless you, brother.
[2:53:50.780 --> 2:53:54.860]  I appreciate your call, Danny.
[2:53:54.860 --> 2:53:58.860]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jason in North Carolina.
[2:53:58.860 --> 2:53:59.860]  Jason, thanks for holding.
[2:53:59.860 --> 2:54:00.860]  You're a trooper.
[2:54:00.860 --> 2:54:01.860]  Go ahead.
[2:54:01.860 --> 2:54:02.860]  Hey, brother.
[2:54:02.860 --> 2:54:03.860]  How you doing?
[2:54:03.860 --> 2:54:04.860]  Thanks for taking my call, man.
[2:54:04.860 --> 2:54:06.380]  I'm actually just feel like I could open it.
[2:54:06.380 --> 2:54:07.380]  I mean, I mean, you know what?
[2:54:07.380 --> 2:54:09.700]  Actually, I feel like I beat up about 20 full grown men.
[2:54:09.700 --> 2:54:10.700]  I mean, I'm not bragging.
[2:54:10.700 --> 2:54:11.900]  I don't like this feeling.
[2:54:11.900 --> 2:54:14.020]  I am in a kick people's ass mode.
[2:54:14.020 --> 2:54:15.020]  You know what I mean?
[2:54:15.020 --> 2:54:16.020]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:54:16.020 --> 2:54:17.820]  I know exactly how you feel, man.
[2:54:17.820 --> 2:54:22.460]  You know, every day you turn the TV on, you get 99% democratic ads.
[2:54:22.460 --> 2:54:26.060]  Every day you get on Twitter, they say they go and block ads, but everything I always
[2:54:26.060 --> 2:54:27.460]  get is democratic ads.
[2:54:27.460 --> 2:54:30.500]  You know, of course, my delete them.
[2:54:30.500 --> 2:54:37.220]  And you know, I support my president 150% and I'm glad to see that people is doing that.
[2:54:37.220 --> 2:54:39.660]  And we're trying to make strides.
[2:54:39.660 --> 2:54:43.580]  One question I have is how do we get through the complete narrow minded people that you
[2:54:43.580 --> 2:54:44.580]  ask them?
[2:54:44.580 --> 2:54:46.580]  Why don't you like the president and they can't give you an answer?
[2:54:46.580 --> 2:54:50.980]  You know, I got to tell you, Christ said, let the dead bury the dead, knock the dust off
[2:54:50.980 --> 2:54:51.980]  your feet.
[2:54:51.980 --> 2:54:52.980]  Try to wake people up.
[2:54:52.980 --> 2:54:57.180]  But if they are delusional and give you that little demon smileback, move on, they're gone.
[2:54:57.180 --> 2:55:01.420]  Whatever reason they're turned over to delusion or a reprobate mind, whatever you want to
[2:55:01.420 --> 2:55:05.540]  call it, they're given great, great delusion and they bought into it.
[2:55:05.540 --> 2:55:06.740]  They bought the chili.
[2:55:06.740 --> 2:55:10.260]  And so I would just move on to people that do care and people that, you know, the crazy
[2:55:10.260 --> 2:55:13.820]  part is we went down and interviewed homeless people downtown, mainly black homeless people
[2:55:13.820 --> 2:55:17.340]  because they're mainly white around town, but downtown they're mainly black for whatever
[2:55:17.340 --> 2:55:18.980]  reason.
[2:55:18.980 --> 2:55:22.900]  And just statistically, you know, what's her name?
[2:55:22.900 --> 2:55:26.580]  Michael Obama was saying that, you know, white people are running from black people.
[2:55:26.580 --> 2:55:29.820]  Well, statistically black folks congregate together more than any other group.
[2:55:29.820 --> 2:55:34.260]  But as we're mainly black homeless folks, they're like, well, you take a microchip to
[2:55:34.260 --> 2:55:35.260]  get free stuff.
[2:55:35.260 --> 2:55:38.620]  They're like, that's the market, the beach, my privacy violated, I'm not giving up my
[2:55:38.620 --> 2:55:39.780]  humanity for that.
[2:55:39.780 --> 2:55:40.780]  I'm not a slave.
[2:55:40.780 --> 2:55:45.620]  Well, you go talk to some liberal white lawyer, they'll say, hell yeah, I'll take a chip.
[2:55:45.620 --> 2:55:50.900]  So like literal crackhead, these black guys said, I'm a cocaine addict.
[2:55:50.900 --> 2:55:56.140]  And like, Owen talked like 15 black guys, only one of them said, I'd take a chip.
[2:55:56.140 --> 2:56:01.220]  So again, they still had dignity and know that it's a satanic assault, that that's a
[2:56:01.220 --> 2:56:05.220]  sign of turning the evil, and even though they're addicted to cocaine, they wouldn't
[2:56:05.220 --> 2:56:07.980]  do it for cocaine.
[2:56:07.980 --> 2:56:13.420]  But the average leftist wants to defile their body and says, I want the chip.
[2:56:13.420 --> 2:56:15.620]  I mean, so you see how it's spiritual.
[2:56:15.620 --> 2:56:17.460]  Absolutely, man, I see it.
[2:56:17.460 --> 2:56:20.060]  And we're definitely in a war and we got to stand and fight.
[2:56:20.060 --> 2:56:24.740]  And the only thing left for me to do that I haven't done is stood on the steps at DC.
[2:56:24.740 --> 2:56:26.180]  And that's coming in the recent weeks.
[2:56:26.180 --> 2:56:30.180]  I'm taking my family up there and we're going to get in at them, see us facing anybody we
[2:56:30.180 --> 2:56:34.780]  can come in contact with, let them know that the people of America still believe in faith
[2:56:34.780 --> 2:56:35.780]  and truth.
[2:56:35.780 --> 2:56:39.100]  And we see right, see you in lies and we're going to do everything we can to stand behind
[2:56:39.100 --> 2:56:40.100]  our president.
[2:56:40.100 --> 2:56:41.100]  So we do succeed.
[2:56:41.100 --> 2:56:42.100]  Well, sir, that's beautiful.
[2:56:42.100 --> 2:56:47.660]  And we produce some shows and what I recommend to do, but I would just have your phone, camera,
[2:56:47.660 --> 2:56:52.300]  you have your site, a family vacation site on Twitter, Facebook, whatever, just over here,
[2:56:52.300 --> 2:56:53.300]  shoot some videos.
[2:56:53.300 --> 2:56:54.300]  Oh, here's the monument.
[2:56:54.300 --> 2:56:55.300]  Here's the thing.
[2:56:55.300 --> 2:56:57.860]  And then say, oh, we're going in to meet our Congress people.
[2:56:57.860 --> 2:56:58.860]  And then you go in.
[2:56:58.860 --> 2:57:01.940]  They tell you when they're coming back and you'll just run into people in the halls and
[2:57:01.940 --> 2:57:05.620]  then you just come over and ask them questions, they'll treat you like crap or give some
[2:57:05.620 --> 2:57:08.700]  you know, answer like, yeah, I want to ban all the guns and then you'll have a viral
[2:57:08.700 --> 2:57:12.700]  video and they'll just know, though, my goodness, because let me tell you, I've been in the
[2:57:12.700 --> 2:57:18.620]  Senate and House buildings many times over the years, probably not exaggerate, 25 times
[2:57:18.620 --> 2:57:20.860]  over the years.
[2:57:20.860 --> 2:57:25.140]  And they're always shocked to see patriots because there's nothing but some mainstream
[2:57:25.140 --> 2:57:29.540]  media and a few Soros people running around to get all the news coverage.
[2:57:29.540 --> 2:57:33.580]  So they've trained us to run down to the big demonstrations and then the media doesn't
[2:57:33.580 --> 2:57:35.100]  cover those.
[2:57:35.100 --> 2:57:39.140]  But they, oh, don't go to the Capitol, don't go to the office buildings, don't you don't
[2:57:39.140 --> 2:57:43.900]  know, don't go there, don't go there, yes, go there and don't even go to DC.
[2:57:43.900 --> 2:57:47.660]  Find out where they're giving speeches and coming back to the district and go get in
[2:57:47.660 --> 2:57:49.860]  those maggots faces.
[2:57:49.860 --> 2:57:53.980]  God bless you, Jason, more calls coming up.

[3:01:32.540 --> 3:01:37.740]  throw out there and then I'll hang up and let you address them okay first off I don't know
[3:01:37.740 --> 3:01:42.860]  why we're talking about Hillary Clinton at this point Trump's got everything he needs to arrest
[3:01:42.860 --> 3:01:48.140]  her she is one of the biggest criminals she is the biggest criminal in world history her her
[3:01:48.140 --> 3:01:55.180]  husband their entire fraudulent Clinton Foundation so you know Trump's got everything he needs
[3:01:55.180 --> 3:02:01.340]  at the same time he's got everything he needs to go after the usurped fraudulent congress people
[3:02:01.340 --> 3:02:07.500]  okay they stole congress through voter and election fraud so he needs he's the one who
[3:02:07.500 --> 3:02:13.260]  can stop this you and I the american people we need to be praying that's our this is a battle
[3:02:13.260 --> 3:02:18.940]  first spot on our knees in a spiritual realm but he needs to take action he's the only one who
[3:02:18.940 --> 3:02:24.140]  can do this to shut them down going to congress going to the halls and all that that's great
[3:02:24.140 --> 3:02:29.660]  but that's not going to do what must be done at this point in time right now he is not protecting
[3:02:29.660 --> 3:02:35.180]  our first amendment he's not having the backs of his people he's not stopping the the slaughter of
[3:02:35.180 --> 3:02:40.940]  our free speech on all of the social media platforms okay yeah that's why Matt Drudge and
[3:02:40.940 --> 3:02:46.540]  people are pissed off at him all I know is I'm gonna go expose Hillary because she's a monster
[3:02:46.540 --> 3:02:50.860]  and we built the platform to get Trump into office so if Trump's not gonna do his job I'm
[3:02:50.860 --> 3:02:57.580]  gonna go do it well we have to but he's got to do is he can shut them down you and I can't
[3:02:57.580 --> 3:03:04.380]  okay now as a side note we need a mandatory death sentence for child rapist okay I am tired
[3:03:04.380 --> 3:03:09.180]  of seeing these perverts perverting our children the public schools perverting perverting the young
[3:03:09.180 --> 3:03:14.460]  I mean imagine if a fat dude in a clown outfit came and talked to your son or daughter at the
[3:03:14.460 --> 3:03:19.020]  park about sex they'd get arrested now they do it in your face government sponsored again it's
[3:03:19.020 --> 3:03:24.620]  got to be so evil so big that it's just it's just Stockholm syndrome kicks in because people have
[3:03:24.620 --> 3:03:29.340]  become a bunch of jellyfish followers and the only people that have gotten a kick or will
[3:03:29.340 --> 3:03:35.100]  are child molesters because they are demonically driven to rape children well they're getting
[3:03:35.100 --> 3:03:40.140]  away with it okay this evil and by the way the raping is what they can get away with they really
[3:03:40.140 --> 3:03:45.420]  want to kill children and they're doing it they're getting away with it because good men and women
[3:03:45.420 --> 3:03:51.020]  are doing nothing you know it used to be where you know you came against someone in this manner
[3:03:51.020 --> 3:03:56.140]  you perverted a child you raped a woman you raped a child their family will come after you and they

[3:09:07.340 --> 3:09:12.540]  literally fox news is on showing more the people are designing that are testifying it's trump and
[3:09:12.540 --> 3:09:16.940]  none of the other witnesses none of the transcripts line up they're all brennan protoges hillary
[3:09:16.940 --> 3:09:22.220]  protoges obama protoges here was fox news and the body language of this guy walk around outside
[3:09:22.220 --> 3:09:28.460]  and the leftist operatives kissing his butt and just all these guys think that they're
[3:09:29.100 --> 3:09:33.900]  earning brownie points with the deep state here it is president solensky listening in as
[3:09:33.900 --> 3:09:39.180]  president trump was speaking to him uh morrison was in the white house situation room morrison
[3:09:39.180 --> 3:09:45.020]  told the three house committees today quote i want to be clear i was not concerned that anything
[3:09:45.020 --> 3:09:50.620]  illegal was discussed foxes also told morrison testify that the memo the call released by the
[3:09:50.620 --> 3:09:56.300]  white house is accurate based on his memory and he does not know the identity of the whistleblower
[3:09:56.300 --> 3:10:02.780]  a republican who sat in on that session talked about morrison i felt that this witness today
[3:10:02.780 --> 3:10:09.660]  was a very credible witness uh he came across very sincere very matter of fact and was very
[3:10:09.660 --> 3:10:14.380]  professional in his demeanor um you know throughout this whole and again they were on the fly there
[3:10:14.380 --> 3:10:17.420]  i was back there during the break and it was another one of the fake whistleblowers i got
[3:10:17.420 --> 3:10:20.700]  more confused but i'll have that in a later report the point is is that it just shows the
[3:10:20.700 --> 3:10:24.540]  difference between these different groups and different people and now there isn't a whistleblower
[3:10:24.540 --> 3:10:28.700]  there was a whistleblower was a ci analyst that worked for brennan and it just goes on and on
[3:10:28.700 --> 3:10:34.540]  it's a huge confusing mess and it's all total garbage uh let's go to your phone calls appreciate
[3:10:34.540 --> 3:10:39.260]  folks holding uh let's go ahead and talk to shon in new jersey thanks for holding shon
[3:10:40.700 --> 3:10:45.740]  hey alex how are you doing today brother i'm good brother um i'm going to give some
[3:10:45.740 --> 3:10:51.260]  shoutouts to a couple of your products i use on the regular and i want to give an update
[3:10:51.260 --> 3:10:56.300]  i'm a veteran from new jersey who had some equipment seized from him and the police
[3:10:56.300 --> 3:11:03.740]  kept changing the charges same thing they're doing the president uh i'm an avid user of x2
[3:11:03.740 --> 3:11:10.300]  brain force real red pill love them to death brother i've always had trouble sleeping at night
[3:11:10.300 --> 3:11:18.060]  like i've had trouble shutting my computer down my brain it runs wild many many thoughts
[3:11:18.620 --> 3:11:24.780]  quite often ever since i started supplementing with your products it's helped me maintain focus
[3:11:25.500 --> 3:11:33.420]  i've been able to regenerate myself properly with sleep consistent sleep i gotta give you
[3:11:33.420 --> 3:11:40.540]  a shout out to your products brother they're spot on well thank you uh i mean i consider
[3:11:40.540 --> 3:11:46.220]  for 10 hours and show mainline studies science about iodine alone good clean iodine two billion
[3:11:46.220 --> 3:11:51.660]  people have mental disabilities according to encyclopedia britannica alive on earth from
[3:11:51.660 --> 3:11:57.420]  lack of iodine and what the fda says you need is way lower folks than what most of studies show
[3:11:57.420 --> 3:12:01.980]  and so the zombiosis and and the health problems and so much more is the lack of that and then
[3:12:01.980 --> 3:12:07.660]  yeah you add a good neutropic like brain force that's got natural things that tune your brain up
[3:12:07.660 --> 3:12:11.660]  well then when you bring it's more active then you sleep better later so there's just a lot of
[3:12:11.660 --> 3:12:17.180]  things that go on and uh it yeah i mean i gotta be careful about the x2 and the x3 because i take
[3:12:17.180 --> 3:12:21.500]  too much of it i i i mean i it's the opposite with me i can't sleep uh because it just gives
[3:12:21.500 --> 3:12:26.860]  me so much energy uh and i'm not going to get any details here but i mean it's like i'm 15 years old
[3:12:26.860 --> 3:12:31.580]  in the uh you know in the with my wife in that department i mean i'm i'm like a i mean i'm like

[3:12:43.740 --> 3:12:48.300]  the inquiry and get it going and then i believe they're gonna impeach him in the house they've
[3:12:48.300 --> 3:12:52.780]  got the votes you know the democrats are gonna do it people go but he's innocent we know he's

[3:20:01.500 --> 3:20:21.500]  slash show you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:24.380 --> 3:20:30.620]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's
[3:20:30.620 --> 3:20:35.180]  Matt Bracken you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:37.580 --> 3:20:44.060]  okay um in a little while we're going to have a former CIA station chief Bradley Johnson Brad
[3:20:44.060 --> 3:20:50.940]  Johnson one is my guest but he's stuck in traffic and we're working on getting him hooked up
[3:20:51.980 --> 3:20:56.300]  not sure when that's going to happen but don't worry i've got plenty of material i'd love to be
[3:20:56.300 --> 3:21:02.860]  talking to him right now but he has a very unique point of view from you know spending many decades
[3:21:02.860 --> 3:21:12.220]  inside the CIA but not as a uh scum sucking deep state um you know mole for globalism but actually
[3:21:12.220 --> 3:21:19.100]  as an american patriot surprisingly enough and today is today halloween is going to go down in
[3:21:19.100 --> 3:21:27.260]  history i think as a very memorable pivotal pivotal day because the house voted on party lines with
[3:21:27.260 --> 3:21:35.580]  two democrat defections uh straight on party lines to um move ahead and give the imprimatur
[3:21:35.580 --> 3:21:44.780]  of legitimacy to the adam schiff bogus you know down in the bunker down in the skiff with schiff
[3:21:44.780 --> 3:21:52.860]  fake impeachment inquiry i saw a great meme comparing it to a lynching and what Nancy Pelosi
[3:21:52.860 --> 3:21:58.140]  has done is saying well we're going to give the lynch mob some plastic badges and now it's legal
[3:21:58.700 --> 3:22:05.180]  and i'm glad to see that the none of the republicans moved over uh and uh voted to to give this thing
[3:22:05.180 --> 3:22:13.820]  any legitimacy but what we're really seeing now is a is a battle royale between the deep state
[3:22:13.820 --> 3:22:21.500]  the globalists and donald trump and the patriots and we're seeing that they have got a lot more assets
[3:22:21.500 --> 3:22:27.660]  than anybody would have ever dreamed they just can keep coming up with you know with russia gate
[3:22:27.660 --> 3:22:33.660]  then ukraine gate and we don't even know where it's going to stop we have no idea how many more of
[3:22:33.660 --> 3:22:40.460]  these moles they're going to to uh produce um but this one at least something beneficial is coming
[3:22:40.460 --> 3:22:47.020]  out of this um and i'll say it you know the eric charmer charmarella charama charamella
[3:22:47.980 --> 3:22:53.740]  i just like to call him ci or amela because the first letters of his of his name are actually
[3:22:53.740 --> 3:23:01.980]  cia you can't make that up so eric charamella he is he is this uh 33 year old pajama boy
[3:23:01.980 --> 3:23:09.900]  who who is basically a mole uh inside of the trump white house until 2017 when he was fired for
[3:23:09.900 --> 3:23:16.860]  leaking but did he get kicked out of the cia techno he went right back to the cia where he's been on
[3:23:16.860 --> 3:23:23.500]  on ice waiting to play his next role which was to be the the cut out the so-called whistleblower
[3:23:23.500 --> 3:23:29.180]  i call him the cut out which is an intel term meaning somebody that gives you a little bit of
[3:23:29.180 --> 3:23:34.540]  space a little bit of distance so that your fingerprints aren't on some some dirty skull
[3:23:34.540 --> 3:23:49.180]  duggery so the guy yesterday the fat major he's the spy the fat major born in ukraine obviously he's
[3:23:49.180 --> 3:23:57.180]  a ukraineophile speaks russian and ukrainian he was actually on the infamous trump phone call he
[3:23:57.180 --> 3:24:03.340]  ukraine everything against russia and when it looked like trump might be shading to against
[3:24:03.340 --> 3:24:14.860]  ukraine he went off the reservation he contacted his old buddy the spy eric cia ramella and cia
[3:24:14.860 --> 3:24:23.660]  ramella went to his old pals who guess what are now working for eric for adam schiff on the intel
[3:24:23.660 --> 3:24:29.660]  committee you can't make this up some so one good thing that's coming out of this entire fiasco this
[3:24:29.660 --> 3:24:38.140]  flap is that that the the the diagram the parameters of this nest of spies it's becoming
[3:24:38.140 --> 3:24:45.180]  uh visible it's becoming evident you know there are there are uh uh guys that are very high up
[3:24:45.180 --> 3:24:53.180]  like general hr mcmaster uh he was the trump national security advisor early on you know you
[3:24:53.180 --> 3:24:59.980]  have to wonder who is giving trump this advice to like keep on comey or hire mcmaster some really
[3:24:59.980 --> 3:25:07.100]  bad bad actors that were surrounding trump were really secret never trumpers so among the people
[3:25:07.100 --> 3:25:16.060]  working for mcmaster were eric cia ramella and as as well as some names that you're gonna be seeing
[3:25:16.060 --> 3:25:25.420]  in the coming days other names that we're going to be saying like like sean misko and abby grace
[3:25:25.420 --> 3:25:33.900]  these are other nsc uh assistants to mcmaster guess where they went when they left the uh
[3:25:33.900 --> 3:25:38.620]  finally left the trump white house guess where they went they went to work for adam schiff
[3:25:38.620 --> 3:25:45.900]  the what we're seeing is an intel operation this is as phony as a three dollar bill you know nobody
[3:25:45.900 --> 3:25:53.100]  in their right mind that's you know not a child essentially is going to look at this and think
[3:25:53.100 --> 3:25:59.740]  that it's legit that the army major just really honestly he couldn't bear it his conscience wouldn't
[3:25:59.740 --> 3:26:06.780]  take it it's an army officer been in combat you know he's seen everything he's seen the elephant
[3:26:06.780 --> 3:26:14.540]  yet his conscience was so aggrieved he just had to go and drop a dime but not to the inspector
[3:26:14.540 --> 3:26:21.500]  general uh not to file a whistleblower report himself not to do the honorable thing put on his
[3:26:21.500 --> 3:26:28.540]  uniform and go on meet the press or some show like that hell no he leaks it to his old pal
[3:26:29.500 --> 3:26:36.540]  eric cia ramella who's back working for the cia under brennan remember all of these people
[3:26:36.540 --> 3:26:45.420]  were put in place by brennan who then coordinates with shifts staff which is sean misko and abby
[3:26:45.420 --> 3:26:52.860]  grace former nsc people now working against trump on the adam schiff intel committee folks you can't
[3:26:52.860 --> 3:27:01.260]  make this up this is this is the this is russia gate 2.0 and the and the problem is when russia
[3:27:01.260 --> 3:27:07.980]  gate 2.0 ukraine gate when it finally fizzles out and dies they're going to come up with something
[3:27:07.980 --> 3:27:14.140]  else it'll be china gate or it'll be korea gate but it's going to be something because these deep
[3:27:14.140 --> 3:27:19.900]  state conspirators one thing we can say about them they're not going to quit and they're not
[3:27:19.900 --> 3:27:27.260]  going to quit because the guys at the top brennan clapper and comey they really seriously don't want
[3:27:27.260 --> 3:27:34.460]  to go to prison and that's what they're facing at a minimum is prison time so when the when the
[3:27:34.460 --> 3:27:41.260]  ig horowitz report comes out that supposedly as thick as a telephone book and is full of
[3:27:41.260 --> 3:27:48.460]  indictable criminal behavior and then when durham's investigation finally works its way up the chain
[3:27:48.460 --> 3:27:53.340]  of command they haven't remember they haven't questioned the principles yet that's because
[3:27:53.340 --> 3:27:59.100]  first they assemble all the evidence against against them by interviewing under oath you know
[3:27:59.100 --> 3:28:04.140]  with a penalty of perjury they interview the underlings other people that were in various
[3:28:04.140 --> 3:28:09.500]  meetings and they work their way up the chain of command when they finally get the clapper comey
[3:28:10.140 --> 3:28:15.740]  and brennan though they're going to have them in a kind of a noose or a straight jacket because
[3:28:15.740 --> 3:28:21.100]  if they lie they'll know it's a lie and you can't take the fifth in a grand jury you've got to say
[3:28:21.100 --> 3:28:27.420]  something so this is a the huge battle royale that is playing out that we're seeing right now
[3:28:27.420 --> 3:28:34.860]  this is going to be a fight to the finish and it looks like um brad johnson is back and after this
[3:28:34.860 --> 3:28:42.540]  break uh i'll be on with uh retired ci officer brad johnson and we're going to break this down
[3:28:42.540 --> 3:28:48.460]  some more is i'll tell you folks we're only in the early innings you might think it can't get any
[3:28:48.460 --> 3:28:53.580]  wilder than this but on the other side we're going to talk about some ways that this could get
[3:28:54.300 --> 3:29:01.180]  a lot wilder that these will be the tame easy soft days compared to what might be coming we'll be back
[3:29:02.060 --> 3:29:07.980]  we can all agree these are troubled times right so do you know who's on your wireless network

[3:31:05.820 --> 3:31:11.500]  ago my 11 year old daughter came to me and she had her digital textbook she said dad
[3:31:11.500 --> 3:31:15.900]  they're teaching us about the periodic table and i clicked on iodine and it says that two
[3:31:15.900 --> 3:31:20.860]  billion people have low IQs or mentally retarded on the planet earth because they didn't get enough
[3:31:20.860 --> 3:31:25.500]  iodine that's what you say all the time but i've heard people say you're crazy and it's not true
[3:31:25.500 --> 3:31:31.100]  but dad it's right here on the periodic table when i click it saying exactly what you said and i said
[3:31:31.100 --> 3:31:37.340]  i know honey that's why i have you take the high quality nutraceutical grade iodine is because
[3:31:37.340 --> 3:31:43.500]  it's why you're so vibrant it's why you're so alive it's it's one of the reasons uh that you're
[3:31:43.500 --> 3:31:48.700]  so much healthier and smarter than most other kids your age and it just really blew her away to read
[3:31:48.700 --> 3:31:55.020]  it there for herself to know that two billion people ladies and gentlemen two billion are mentally
[3:31:55.020 --> 3:31:59.580]  retarded on the face of the earth right now because of iodine deficiency research it and find out for
[3:31:59.580 --> 3:32:06.060]  yourself now info wars dot com we have strong disagreement on policy grounds and i hope there's
[3:32:06.060 --> 3:32:10.860]  diversity in policy here i don't care what your views are i hope you articulate them and defend
[3:32:10.860 --> 3:32:15.180]  them and listen and debate them that's important but we have something in common we have a set of
[3:32:15.180 --> 3:32:20.780]  values that are at the core of this country that hold this place together clinton deep state bag man
[3:32:20.780 --> 3:32:26.300]  comey thinks it's funny that he was the leaker and that he lied to congress in the world he thinks
[3:32:26.300 --> 3:32:32.540]  committing crimes are funny and he thinks if he acts confident he won't get indicted the word is the
[3:32:32.540 --> 3:32:37.740]  criminal investigation is honing in on him from my new home in new zealand i will
[3:32:40.540 --> 3:32:46.780]  oh and now suddenly he's talking about moving to new zealand not so fast criminal we're going to
[3:32:46.780 --> 3:32:51.260]  bring you to justice and we're going to bring hillary to justice as well because if we don't
[3:32:51.260 --> 3:32:56.780]  you criminals will continue to strike back at your enemy but the american people know how much you
[3:32:56.780 --> 3:33:02.300]  hate us and we're fighting back at info wars dot com news wars dot com and band off video
[3:33:02.300 --> 3:33:18.700]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:18.700 --> 3:33:26.700]  you
[3:33:34.700 --> 3:33:42.700]  okay um we're still uh as they say efforting getting uh brad johnson hooked up he's he's new to this
[3:33:42.700 --> 3:33:49.340]  he's not uh one of these leaker types that has all the reporters on speed dial you know he a clandestine
[3:33:49.340 --> 3:33:56.780]  operator uh he's more about uh you know preventing the uh spreading of this information most of his
[3:33:56.780 --> 3:34:03.980]  career so this whole thing about broadcasting what he knows it's new to him um but we might have him
[3:34:03.980 --> 3:34:11.340]  on phone or we're gonna keep trying on skype i was saying before that we're just in the beginning
[3:34:11.340 --> 3:34:18.380]  of this because as an animal is cornered it becomes the most dangerous even a rat is gonna
[3:34:18.380 --> 3:34:24.540]  fight to the death when it when it sees that it's in a corner or like al bagh daddy he's
[3:34:24.540 --> 3:34:30.220]  gonna blow himself in and some children up but in this case clapper comey brennan mccabe
[3:34:31.020 --> 3:34:37.100]  they don't see themselves uh fighting to the end they see themselves as as uh
[3:34:37.100 --> 3:34:43.900]  uh operatives who are going to fight against trump for their their their cause of higher
[3:34:43.900 --> 3:34:50.220]  loyalty which is their loyalty to globalism you have to keep this in mind we're fighting for
[3:34:50.220 --> 3:34:57.500]  our country we're nationalists they are past being nationalists to these guys nationalism
[3:34:57.500 --> 3:35:04.940]  is a dirty word and not only i mean brennan he joined the cia in the 70s after voting
[3:35:04.940 --> 3:35:12.060]  for gust hall a Stalinist communist so if he could get into the cia you know 40 years ago
[3:35:12.780 --> 3:35:19.580]  imagine the little socialist globalist communist creeps that they've been recruiting ever since
[3:35:19.580 --> 3:35:28.620]  then how do you imagine that guys like cia remella uh misko and grace uh and these and these other
[3:35:28.620 --> 3:35:34.300]  characters how do you think they all wound up in one things like the national security council
[3:35:34.300 --> 3:35:40.540]  they shouldn't be able to get a security clearance at all and they're and they're actually uh you
[3:35:40.540 --> 3:35:47.660]  know in positions of great influence at the elbow of our leaders you know another thing to understand
[3:35:47.660 --> 3:35:53.740]  is that you know you can see a chain of command where theoretically you're going to have uh you
[3:35:53.740 --> 3:35:59.820]  know a general mcmaster way up high he's a he's a flag rank he's a senior executive service equivalent
[3:35:59.820 --> 3:36:05.660]  as a general flag rank and you would think how in the world there must there must be a dozen people
[3:36:05.660 --> 3:36:14.540]  between him and somebody like eric cia remella but remella was a special assistant to obama
[3:36:15.260 --> 3:36:24.140]  and so and so were uh misko and abby grace they were assistants to McMaster so they're
[3:36:24.140 --> 3:36:29.260]  they're very smart i mean i they've got the degrees they speak the languages but they're
[3:36:29.260 --> 3:36:36.620]  loyalty is completely not toward america their loyalty is toward globalism and when a president
[3:36:36.620 --> 3:36:43.980]  comes in who is who is threatening to turn america from away from their globalist from their
[3:36:43.980 --> 3:36:50.940]  globalist agenda and back towards an american make america great again agenda to them this
[3:36:50.940 --> 3:36:59.900]  strikes at their heart i mean these characters another one is named um casco um caption charles
[3:36:59.900 --> 3:37:08.300]  caption another cia guy above the you know between McMaster and cia remella is this guy
[3:37:08.300 --> 3:37:18.620]  charles kupchen excuse me k up chan cia and cfr council and foreign relations um the atlantic
[3:37:18.620 --> 3:37:25.340]  council these guys are one worlders we have to understand we can't look at them as fellow
[3:37:25.340 --> 3:37:32.700]  patriotic americans who just have a a uh a difference of opinion you know sort of like uh
[3:37:32.700 --> 3:37:38.620]  you know the the uh mets or the excuse me the nationals versus the astros red versus blue
[3:37:39.180 --> 3:37:47.180]  they see patriotic american nationalists trump voters like you and me they see us as the enemy
[3:37:47.180 --> 3:37:55.100]  as as being you know throwbacks like neanderthals they are the enlightened ones they they are
[3:37:55.100 --> 3:38:00.620]  moving completely past america that's why they're for open borders that's why they're
[3:38:00.620 --> 3:38:06.220]  for flooding our country with people from anywhere in the world you know to break down our social
[3:38:06.220 --> 3:38:14.620]  cohesion uh and essentially turn turn in this imported group into just a a bunch of socialist
[3:38:14.620 --> 3:38:21.340]  drones that will vote for the democrat party and turn every single state in our country into a
[3:38:21.340 --> 3:38:26.780]  another version of california i mean you would you would think that states like like uh georgia
[3:38:26.780 --> 3:38:32.460]  or virginia confederate states these would be conservative to the bitter end but this agenda
[3:38:32.460 --> 3:38:43.500]  has been working beautifully and and even with trump coming in uh in 2016 unfortunately he got a
[3:38:43.500 --> 3:38:50.220]  lot of bad advice to keep a lot of these obama holdovers on and he's been surrounded by never
[3:38:50.220 --> 3:38:58.220]  trump globalist traders from day one people who are spying on him and working against him
[3:38:58.220 --> 3:39:06.140]  and it's i'm never going to uh be able to figure out you know who were the exact people was it
[3:39:06.140 --> 3:39:11.740]  previous i mean who were the people that said yeah these are these are people you can trust
[3:39:11.740 --> 3:39:18.060]  keep these guys around trump has been surrounded by really terrible people but gradually they've
[3:39:18.060 --> 3:39:23.340]  been weeded out but even when they've been weeded out we can see that some of them went to shifts
[3:39:23.340 --> 3:39:28.700]  intel committee some of them went back to cia and you know even though brennan officially
[3:39:28.700 --> 3:39:35.180]  is not in the cia anymore i i think behind the scenes he is pulling the strings or at least
[3:39:35.180 --> 3:39:42.140]  he's extremely influential um i i think we have uh brad johnson up now uh is brad there can we uh
[3:39:42.140 --> 3:39:48.300]  hear brad yes how are you doing matt i'm doing great i don't know how much you've been able to
[3:39:48.300 --> 3:39:55.420]  hear but uh what a day to be on the show huh yes it is there's so much going on it's incredible
[3:39:56.620 --> 3:40:01.740]  yeah i just i wanted to kind of my take is that uh you know trump has been surrounded by these
[3:40:01.740 --> 3:40:10.140]  uh ivy league globalists um the guys like cia ramella uh i know that you've you know they i just
[3:40:10.140 --> 3:40:16.460]  can't get over the irony of the first three letters of his name charamella cia ramella
[3:40:17.340 --> 3:40:22.300]  these guys they're very smart they i was a russian studies major at the university of virginia
[3:40:22.940 --> 3:40:29.020]  maybe that's not yale but i mean i i didn't go that globalist route i was i considered myself
[3:40:29.020 --> 3:40:36.860]  a patriot when i was serving yes so did i and uh and i still do i was gonna go ahead i've been
[3:40:38.220 --> 3:40:43.580]  yeah go ahead i've been monopolizing the whole show okay i was gonna say i heard i did come on
[3:40:43.580 --> 3:40:48.460]  and hear you talking about john brennan still having influence and uh in the cia and i've got
[3:40:48.460 --> 3:40:53.900]  to reiterate that and and there is no question whatsoever about it i can say absolute fact
[3:40:53.900 --> 3:40:59.420]  that he's got tremendous pulse still in the cia i mean let's not forget the current director of the
[3:40:59.420 --> 3:41:05.660]  cia jena haspel was a close associate of john brennan's john brennan's clearance is still intact
[3:41:05.660 --> 3:41:11.180]  that has not been pulled which that's an oversight that should be taken care of uh so he's got access
[3:41:11.180 --> 3:41:17.740]  to them basically whenever he wants and the uh three top lieutenants that are within the the
[3:41:17.740 --> 3:41:23.980]  cia operations end of thing running running it not like the hr or personnel sorts of people
[3:41:23.980 --> 3:41:30.540]  those three individuals were also closely working for and associated with john brennan
[3:41:30.540 --> 3:41:34.700]  so the number one number two number three number four people at the cia right now
[3:41:35.260 --> 3:41:38.860]  our close friends and associates that have worked closely in the past with john brennan
[3:41:38.860 --> 3:41:44.700]  so to to suggest even for a moment that he isn't pulling strings whenever he desires to in the
[3:41:44.700 --> 3:41:51.100]  in the cia is just poorly informed he absolutely is connected so you think that they're the loyalty
[3:41:51.100 --> 3:41:57.260]  of that upper echelon just as we saw that that fbi headquarters was completely twisted and perverted
[3:41:57.260 --> 3:42:04.380]  to serve you know uh nefarious ends you think that maybe the the top fours of cia are are still real
[3:42:04.380 --> 3:42:11.420]  they still really have a protect the deep state agenda we've got one minute till break uh all of
[3:42:11.420 --> 3:42:17.420]  the agencies are that way the fbi the cia nsa state department they're all that way the uh
[3:42:17.420 --> 3:42:23.820]  pipeline to leadership in all of the federal agencies uh that are in the intelligence community
[3:42:23.820 --> 3:42:28.300]  have been controlled by the left for a long time so the only people that make their way up through
[3:42:28.300 --> 3:42:34.380]  that pipeline and get into positions of leadership are the resist uh deep state types of people so
[3:42:34.380 --> 3:42:39.340]  they're all that way there is there's no exceptions to that it's it's not what people say on talking
[3:42:39.340 --> 3:42:42.700]  heads say where they're oh there's good people that are purely professional there that's
[3:42:42.700 --> 3:42:47.660]  that used to be that way but that's no longer that way that was all consolidated under obama
[3:42:47.660 --> 3:42:51.660]  and that's the way it stays and unfortunately trump hasn't had the chance to fix that yet
[3:42:52.460 --> 3:42:56.460]  yeah when when we come back from the break i'm going to talk about um what you think of
[3:42:56.460 --> 3:43:00.380]  are ways we could clean out the stable uh if it's even possible
[3:43:03.340 --> 3:43:07.820]  folks ask me alex why do you have two different types of iodine well that's because
[3:43:07.820 --> 3:43:14.300]  different types of physiology different types of metabolic systems and people will like different
[3:43:14.300 --> 3:43:21.180]  formulas it's just that simple x3 is the deep earth crystal iodine and two other types because
[3:43:21.180 --> 3:43:28.380]  some people need all three types to absorb others like the pure atomic iodine get both they're both
[3:43:28.380 --> 3:43:34.540]  great for you whichever one you like use that and give the other to family or friends bottom line
[3:43:34.540 --> 3:43:40.620]  iodine is essential that's why i harp on it the globalist want you to be deficient in it for a lot

[3:47:32.780 --> 3:47:40.380]  yeah before i get back to brad johnson i wanted to mention that since i was going to be on the
[3:47:40.380 --> 3:47:47.180]  show today i put two of my books on to a kindle free run so my first and my last books enemies
[3:47:47.180 --> 3:47:52.620]  foreign and domestic and the bracken collection they're on a kindle free run so if you just go to
[3:47:52.620 --> 3:47:58.940]  amazon you can download them if you want the audible or versions or the printed books you've
[3:47:58.940 --> 3:48:03.660]  got to go to amazon or you can get the printed books straight from me and that way you'll cut
[3:48:03.660 --> 3:48:08.780]  jeff bezos out of taken half anyway but if you just want to read the kindle versions they're
[3:48:08.780 --> 3:48:16.220]  free today on on amazon kindle and i also wanted to mention i wrote something over the weekend
[3:48:16.220 --> 3:48:22.380]  sometimes i write little fictional short stories because they're just a little bit too hot to write
[3:48:22.380 --> 3:48:30.300]  as a as a essay or a column with people's real name so look for something on americanpartisan.org
[3:48:30.860 --> 3:48:38.860]  called adam fish must die because it's it's my fear that as the as the impeachment turns out to be
[3:48:38.860 --> 3:48:43.740]  a dry hole like when adam shift was saying oh i've got all the evidence about russian collusion
[3:48:43.740 --> 3:48:49.980]  right in my pocket it was a lie they can only do this leak strategy from the bunker while
[3:48:49.980 --> 3:48:54.380]  they're maintaining secrecy but eventually it's going to be shown that adam shift doesn't have
[3:48:54.380 --> 3:49:00.220]  anything and then what happens when the deep state gets really desperate i explore that
[3:49:00.220 --> 3:49:05.820]  possibility in my uh short story that's up at american partisan but let now i want to bring
[3:49:05.820 --> 3:49:10.700]  back brad johnson and we're going to talk about what can we do at this point i mean is it just a
[3:49:10.700 --> 3:49:16.860]  done deal that the that the cia the nsa the fbi they're all run you know they're essentially
[3:49:16.860 --> 3:49:24.620]  co-opted by by uh globalists by leftists what can be what can we do yeah it's a it's a it's a tough
[3:49:24.620 --> 3:49:29.740]  problem and i would say that anyone i've talked to that are a retired agency and people like that
[3:49:29.740 --> 3:49:36.060]  that i know we've all concluded that essentially it cannot be fixed with what's there that's and i
[3:49:36.060 --> 3:49:41.100]  think that's the bottom line now all of these federal agencies are highly bloated and so the
[3:49:41.100 --> 3:49:45.660]  numbers have gone way up the number of people that they hired were extensive under obama
[3:49:45.660 --> 3:49:51.020]  under the obama administration during those years so these very bloated intelligence uh
[3:49:51.660 --> 3:49:57.260]  community uh agencies probably the the first thing to do to start would be to pair them
[3:49:57.260 --> 3:50:02.140]  back down to size and that would be a riff that would be a reduction in force is the term this
[3:50:02.140 --> 3:50:08.620]  is something that the democrats have used in the past and that was what was done to initially
[3:50:08.620 --> 3:50:13.180]  essentially lay the groundwork for the destruction of the capability of the cia it was done back in
[3:50:13.180 --> 3:50:18.940]  jimmy carter days it was a halloween it was just it was the thursday of halloween and it was known
[3:50:18.940 --> 3:50:25.180]  as black thursday at the time so done those number of years ago almost to the day and they fired a
[3:50:25.180 --> 3:50:28.700]  couple of thousand people and a couple more thousand people walked out the door next day
[3:50:28.700 --> 3:50:33.820]  because they were so pissed so something along those lines would be that was that was um that was
[3:50:33.820 --> 3:50:38.700]  back with i think admiral stanfield turner when he came in but that's absolutely correct it was
[3:50:38.700 --> 3:50:44.060]  turner but unfortunately unfortunately the people that were rift that were really were forced out
[3:50:44.060 --> 3:50:50.060]  or quit were a lot of the um the the old old hardcore cold warriors you know that knew where
[3:50:50.060 --> 3:50:55.340]  the bodies were buried and and had helped put them there and what we were left with were the
[3:50:55.340 --> 3:51:01.180]  new coterie of these leftists so even if we had a big riff now my fear is that it would just be used
[3:51:01.180 --> 3:51:08.060]  as a purge of the remaining patriots consolidating the hold of the leftists well i would i would
[3:51:08.060 --> 3:51:12.540]  disagree slightly i would say there's no patriots left certainly at the leadership level at the
[3:51:12.540 --> 3:51:17.820]  working level yes but those people essentially uh you have to keep your head down your mouth shut
[3:51:17.820 --> 3:51:21.980]  because if it comes out that you're a conservative you're destroyed your career is over it's it's
[3:51:21.980 --> 3:51:26.140]  not that you necessarily get fired on the spot but you're never going to get a good job and the only
[3:51:26.140 --> 3:51:31.500]  way to get promoted and move up is to have a good job that that ticks off all those things that are
[3:51:31.500 --> 3:51:36.620]  required to go to the next level and that's how they control the pipeline there's a lot of laws
[3:51:36.620 --> 3:51:43.100]  controlling the promotion process but there's no laws controlling the how jobs are handed out and
[3:51:43.100 --> 3:51:47.820]  that's the way that the liberals have taken it over inside all of these federal agencies many
[3:51:47.820 --> 3:51:54.780]  years ago at state department and in recent decades at the rest of the agencies so uh there a riff
[3:51:54.780 --> 3:51:59.420]  would especially at the at the higher levels there there's no conservatives to target so it
[3:51:59.420 --> 3:52:04.620]  could only be to the good it would be a net win to do a riff of any sort at any of these agencies
[3:52:04.620 --> 3:52:11.020]  yeah i i wonder about just an abolishment at this point because you look at the cia's history
[3:52:11.820 --> 3:52:16.540]  and it's like a ticking off the failures i remember tucker carlson did this a few months
[3:52:16.540 --> 3:52:23.180]  ago it was very brave of him putting a target on himself like that but but i mean korea missed it
[3:52:23.180 --> 3:52:30.380]  you know um you know gulf of tonkin well that was probably a setup uh essentially i mean you
[3:52:30.380 --> 3:52:35.020]  you just go down the list nine eleven oh they've missed everything the collapse of the soviet
[3:52:35.020 --> 3:52:39.260]  union you know the year before the those burling wall goes down they're saying that the soviet
[3:52:39.260 --> 3:52:44.860]  union is going to be around for another century so what would we lose by losing the cia and starting
[3:52:44.860 --> 3:52:51.820]  all over again well uh if it's to lose the cia to start all over again i would say that might be
[3:52:51.820 --> 3:52:55.980]  actually a decent argument there would probably be something along those lines i would i would think
[3:52:55.980 --> 3:53:00.860]  would be a good idea maybe pulling some elements out that that run the operations but essentially
[3:53:00.860 --> 3:53:07.740]  once once you saw everything get melded into one big pot where there's no distinction between
[3:53:07.740 --> 3:53:13.820]  operations and analysis and everything else within the cia that was essentially at doing it in now
[3:53:13.820 --> 3:53:18.140]  let me say a couple things about the cia for failures there's also a lot of successes of
[3:53:18.140 --> 3:53:23.100]  course the failures become public uh so there's it's easy to to pick off points like that that
[3:53:23.100 --> 3:53:29.100]  you're mentioning and the successes mainly stay secret forever uh at one thing that that uh the
[3:53:29.100 --> 3:53:35.980]  cia has done well recently was uh getting alabab daddy so now that was an intelligence success
[3:53:35.980 --> 3:53:41.180]  that was a human operation granted military intelligence was involved the curds were involved
[3:53:41.180 --> 3:53:45.980]  a lot of people were involved but it is a measure of success there are capabilities that remain within
[3:53:45.980 --> 3:53:51.100]  the cia for liaison operations as it traditionally has been called now they call it you know working
[3:53:51.100 --> 3:53:56.940]  with our foreign partners as is the term that's used today so that does remain an area where
[3:53:56.940 --> 3:54:04.460]  the cia can do some stuff but the unfortunately the uh unilateral espionage and by that i mean
[3:54:04.460 --> 3:54:09.420]  only the united states would know who these espionage people are who the spies are that there
[3:54:09.420 --> 3:54:15.260]  would be no liaison no foreign country that would be aware of us dealing with these people that
[3:54:15.260 --> 3:54:20.060]  has what has been just completely destroyed under the obama years under john brennan that's the
[3:54:20.060 --> 3:54:25.020]  part that needs to be built back up because that's the centerpiece not having that is a lot like you
[3:54:25.020 --> 3:54:29.900]  know having a navy that doesn't have ships all we do is rely on our foreign partners when we need a
[3:54:29.900 --> 3:54:35.820]  aircraft carrier uh task force in them in the mediterranean for example we call our our foreign
[3:54:35.820 --> 3:54:41.500]  partners and say hey please send a task force there i mean that's just stupidity defined and to do
[3:54:41.500 --> 3:54:46.860]  the same thing with espionage is stupidity defined so that's a capability that has to be brought back
[3:54:46.860 --> 3:54:52.380]  well i think that i think that one thing that's going to come out of this entire the russia hoax
[3:54:53.020 --> 3:54:57.820]  collusion delusion is that is that it's going to be obvious to americans that
[3:54:57.820 --> 3:55:03.660]  this was a cia active measure intel operation conducted i think by john brennan at obama's
[3:55:03.660 --> 3:55:09.580]  orders against the uh candidate trump and then president trump and you know using people like
[3:55:09.580 --> 3:55:17.660]  mifsud downer and and um and help helper is going to expose how these stooges um well it's great when
[3:55:17.660 --> 3:55:23.340]  they're working against you know uh lower slobovia but it's not great when they're brought home and
[3:55:23.340 --> 3:55:28.860]  used against americans in a political campaign or against an american president and just you know
[3:55:28.860 --> 3:55:35.420]  sheep dipping it by using foreigners to avoid the uh no domestic spying doing it in london or or roam
[3:55:35.420 --> 3:55:41.260]  um it's going to be apparent this was a brennan operation and i i hope he goes to prison i don't
[3:55:41.260 --> 3:55:46.540]  know if that's even plausible but um if it looks like he is going to prison i would not rule out
[3:55:47.260 --> 3:55:53.500]  crazy false flag operations like what i i wrote about um in the uh short story i just put out
[3:55:53.500 --> 3:56:00.140]  last weekend but i think we're in very perilous times um last last two minutes um go go ahead with
[3:56:00.140 --> 3:56:04.620]  the last two minutes whatever's on your mind yeah let me address that because that's extremely
[3:56:04.620 --> 3:56:09.020]  important i think there's no question whatsoever that there's john brennan's fingerprints all over
[3:56:09.020 --> 3:56:13.660]  this thing and i've been saying over the last almost year that all roads lead back to john brennan
[3:56:13.660 --> 3:56:18.380]  every time something is uncovered there's a connection to john brennan on all of these things
[3:56:18.380 --> 3:56:23.660]  and the foreign aspects that you mentioned all of that this is clearly uh an operation intelligence
[3:56:23.660 --> 3:56:28.300]  operation that's been run against the president and it continues to this day the ukraine thing is
[3:56:28.300 --> 3:56:33.500]  all just an extension of that as they fail on all of their earlier attempts they just keep coming
[3:56:33.500 --> 3:56:38.220]  up with a new aspect to try and the ukraine it just happens to be the latest one now i would
[3:56:38.220 --> 3:56:45.340]  diverge slightly on obama i obama may have been aware of all of this i think all this will play
[3:56:45.340 --> 3:56:50.300]  out and we should hopefully find out but i don't think he was the beginning of it because if you
[3:56:50.300 --> 3:56:56.140]  look at the steel dossier and the timing of all these things this all began and was set in motion
[3:56:56.140 --> 3:57:02.140]  before trump was even the candidate for the republican party so why that timing and i think it
[3:57:02.140 --> 3:57:07.100]  all links back instead to hillary clinton and the reason i think hillary clinton is because
[3:57:07.100 --> 3:57:12.140]  there was the leak of all of those documents and just based on what the fbi has been saying there
[3:57:12.140 --> 3:57:18.780]  were 25 or 30 000 classified documents at a minimum that were leaked by hillary clinton so she was
[3:57:18.780 --> 3:57:23.580]  faced with that problem early on when she was secretary of state fully believing she was
[3:57:23.580 --> 3:57:29.020]  going to become president went to john brennan and said john help me fix this problem of these
[3:57:29.020 --> 3:57:33.820]  leaked documents that seem to be uh probably getting people killed and there are a lot of problems
[3:57:33.820 --> 3:57:39.580]  overseas so i think that we're coming or redward i'm sorry we're coming right to the end i don't
[3:57:39.580 --> 3:57:44.860]  know if you can see the countdown but we've just got about 10 seconds so if folks these are perilous
[3:57:44.860 --> 3:58:01.820]  times uh brad johnson's got a youtube channel look for him there and uh i'll see you next time i see
