[00:05.000 --> 00:10.000]  We are on the March. The Empire is on the run.
[00:10.000 --> 00:14.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20.000 --> 00:26.000]  Well, it's four o'clock Central Standard Time on the Sunday Live Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:26.000 --> 00:33.000]  Everybody, the 16th day, the 16th day, ladies and gentlemen, of November 2014.
[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  I know stations Rear, the Live Show, also at different times.
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.000]  Thank you so much for joining us. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:41.000 --> 00:47.000]  We'll be here for the next two hours as we are every single Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Time.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  Don't forget the weekday show, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. as well,
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  or the nightly news, 7 o'clock Central Standard Time as well.
[00:56.000 --> 01:02.000]  Or to begin, so many important stories.
[01:02.000 --> 01:13.000]  There's a report out, London Independent, that ISIS is actually seven times bigger than what the CIA is saying.
[01:13.000 --> 01:27.000]  Well, you notice I've been saying it's 250,000 to 300,000 fighters since the beginning of the name change six months ago.
[01:27.000 --> 01:36.000]  Because ISIS is just the name of the al-Qaeda forces out of Saudi Arabia that have been attacking Syria for four years.
[01:36.000 --> 01:42.000]  So when they say ISIS is 16,000 or 25,000, that is absolute poppycock.
[01:42.000 --> 01:52.000]  This is a organized criminal operation funded by Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, and the West, NATO, Israel's involved.
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  It's just a fact. See, I don't go where I want to go. I go where the facts are.
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.000]  And it's not hard to have these facts. This is all well known.
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.000]  But it's now in the news that the Kurdish estimates are they're fighting 200,000.
[02:08.000 --> 02:13.000]  That's the London Independent. That is all coming up today.
[02:13.000 --> 02:21.000]  That's just one little tidbit. CIA ways expanded role in ISIS fight.
[02:21.000 --> 02:29.000]  Got another stack of news here in a video when I get to Florida school children terrorized by police for their safety.
[02:29.000 --> 02:38.000]  It's on CBS News locally. Police officers draw guns during unannounced active shooter drill and terrorize them.
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  This isn't an accident. This is done nationwide.
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  I want to decompartmentalize the police today and explain to them why they're doing this.
[02:45.000 --> 02:49.000]  It's not the mission they've been told.
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.000]  We're going to break that down as well. The news behind the news, the rest of the story.
[02:52.000 --> 02:59.000]  Vitamir Putin to leave G20 early after tense meeting with David Cameron. Cameron when Putin walked over said,
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  I don't know if I'm going to shake your hand. I guess I will.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  But we did one thing. You get out of Ukraine.
[03:05.000 --> 03:07.000]  This is how wars start.
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  Imagine a Canadian that has no connection to Ukraine that's been half Russian forever.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  The West has overthrown the country.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  And now this guy waddles over and tells Putin, get out.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  This is thug level. You don't do that in diplomatic circles.
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.000]  This is unprecedented. And the Russians are leaving.
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  And they came to the G20 and said the gloves are off.
[03:32.000 --> 03:39.000]  As I've said, I don't sanctify. I don't lionize. I don't deify the Russians or Putin.
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.000]  But they're not the people trying to take my guns or sign me on to foreign derivatives packages in the trillions.
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  They're not the ones surveilling me. The Russians are under attack.
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000]  The Russians are being destabilized.
[03:50.000 --> 03:58.000]  The Russians have the West in there trying to overthrow and take their gas pipelines where they sell gas to Europe at low prices.
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  I find no fault. Like Pontius Pilate, I said I don't compare them to Christ.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  No, he's certainly no devil. He's certainly no Christ.
[04:07.000 --> 04:11.000]  But Vladimir Putin, they love to demonize a person.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  The larger issue here is Russia itself is not on the offense.
[04:16.000 --> 04:21.000]  And the West wants to conquer Russia just as they've conquered America.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  The globalists that have conquered the West want to conquer Russia.
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  And that's just a fact. And so my North Star, my default is the truth.
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.000]  Does that mean the Russians haven't done horrible atrocities over the last 200 years, the Ukrainians?
[04:36.000 --> 04:40.000]  That's really been a Germanic area 4-200 years ago.
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  Does that mean Stalin didn't kill 10 million Kulaks? No, I know the history.
[04:45.000 --> 04:53.000]  The point is, is they're getting along and along comes George Soros to destabilize the country.
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  We've got reporters in Ferguson with breaking news as well.
[04:57.000 --> 05:16.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[05:16.000 --> 05:29.000]  Well they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in every stitch. Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[05:29.000 --> 05:34.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  Blue diamond gusset's got it, other stone.
[05:39.000 --> 05:46.000]  We turned jeans inside out. Diamond gusset jeans. Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[05:46.000 --> 05:53.000]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can ride all day with confidence.
[05:53.000 --> 06:01.000]  Order yours at gusset.com. Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[06:01.000 --> 06:30.000]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity.
[06:30.000 --> 06:41.000]  The time to choose sides has come. We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[06:41.000 --> 06:49.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this November 16, 2014 Sunday Worldwide broadcast.
[06:49.000 --> 06:53.000]  We'll be here for the next two hours. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:53.000 --> 07:00.000]  I want to open the phones up at the bottom of the hour on a host of news issues.
[07:00.000 --> 07:07.000]  And then at the bottom of the next hour, roughly an hour and 25 minutes from now, we will have Joe Biggs and Jakari Jackson,
[07:07.000 --> 07:15.000]  who are the folks that got the footage of the media being attacked and they got shot with rubber bullets back during the last Ferguson blow-up.
[07:15.000 --> 07:25.000]  Well, they're saying that the grand jury tonight or tomorrow will decide whether the bill or no bill with an indictment of this police officer.
[07:25.000 --> 07:37.000]  And police departments across the country in major metro areas like Chicago, D.C., New York, Los Angeles are bracing for riots, racial attacks, you name it.
[07:37.000 --> 07:45.000]  Who knows what will happen if this takes place because a lot of race-baiting black leaders have been out in the news,
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  saying that all hell is going to break loose if this officer isn't indicted.
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.000]  Listen, all I try to do is send reporters to the scene, gather the facts, and report the truth.
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.000]  Overall, most of the demonstrators have acted responsibly.
[07:59.000 --> 08:09.000]  There have been some groups mixed in with the demonstrators that have looted repeatedly and shot at police and thrown them all off cocktails.
[08:09.000 --> 08:13.000]  And there has been a bad element that's piggybacked on this.
[08:13.000 --> 08:23.000]  That said, now with all the witnesses in the video, reportedly the grand jury scene, it's true that this gentleman who had just shook down,
[08:23.000 --> 08:29.000]  reportedly strong arms, someone at a convenience store, charged and attacked the officer.
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  And so it looks like he should be no billed.
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  And so if he's innocent, he should not be indicted.
[08:36.000 --> 08:43.000]  That said, we would say, hey, we're reporters in an area that the police had not even said move out of,
[08:43.000 --> 08:54.000]  and they went on orders to go ahead and shoot my reporters and vice reporters and Al Jazeera reporters with rubber bullets and tear gas,
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  and would chase my reporters down and assault them.
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.000]  So I got to say a lot of shameful behavior by the police, shameful behavior by the looters,
[09:03.000 --> 09:10.000]  and we would catch looters and say there's a looter right over here and the police would run up with shotguns and say, I will effing kill you.
[09:10.000 --> 09:15.000]  In fact, the cop that did that got suspended was a Ferguson PD officer.
[09:15.000 --> 09:16.000]  It's just a mess.
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  I mean, it's just a unprofessional mess all the way around.
[09:20.000 --> 09:28.000]  But with all this going on in our country, the racial divide that's been pushed by the Democrats and by Obama for seven years,
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  well, eight years we count the election and MSNBC saying your racist if you don't support Obamacare,
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  your racist if you aren't for gun control, turn your guns in.
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  And Michael Moore saying white people that own guns have them because they're racist.
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  He says that all the time when he has armed bodyguards and own guns himself.
[09:47.000 --> 09:54.000]  They are the number one fanars of the flame that have created this atmosphere.
[09:54.000 --> 10:05.000]  And watching how the federally trained police and even state police acted with the local police and sheriff's department tells me that if riots break out,
[10:05.000 --> 10:16.000]  that need to be put down and need to be stopped, you have no right to go burn somebody's house or business down because of a verdict in a grand jury.
[10:16.000 --> 10:24.000]  Whether you think it's a proper verdict or not, you don't have a right to go randomly attack innocent people or burn down their businesses because of that.
[10:24.000 --> 10:33.000]  But separately, then the police get out of hand and try to attack reporters or the general public or use it as a way to try to clamp down on the public.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  Well, then that's a tyranny as well. So this is a real tightrope that's being walked here.
[10:39.000 --> 10:46.000]  And seeing when I saw on the live video feeds that we all watched here and that millions tuned in and watched with our reporters on the ground.
[10:46.000 --> 10:55.000]  And seeing just the across the board behavior is extremely worrisome and this country is undoubtedly a powder kick.
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.000]  Now police departments, the AP's reporting are bracing across the country for a verdict tonight or the next few days.
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  Our reporters are in Ferguson. They'll join us, as I said, at the bottom of the next hour.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  This may not be the big trigger and I hope it's not. I hope there is no big trigger.
[11:10.000 --> 11:23.000]  But as the welfare checks continue to come but don't have as big a buying value and basically become devalued pieces of junk, you're going to see more crime.
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.000]  I don't care if it's a black community, poor white community, Native American community, Hispanic community.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  You've got 50 million Americans on food stamps, about 100 million on assistance.
[11:32.000 --> 11:41.000]  And as the dollars devalue, this is already happening in Europe and other areas, as their currencies are devalued, there's a global race to devalue currencies right now by private central banks.
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  As that happens, you will see crime increase.
[11:45.000 --> 11:51.000]  And because media has pushed racial division, people tend to form up into racial gangs like prison.
[11:51.000 --> 12:00.000]  Because, oh, then it's okay to go out and mug somebody because they're black and you're white or they're white and you're black or you're straight and they're gay.
[12:00.000 --> 12:08.000]  We all know how this psychology works. A lot of criminals aren't psychopaths or sociopaths.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  They rationalize that you're driving a nice Lexus so you deserve to be carjacked.
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.000]  They rationalize that, you know, your wife was wearing a hot outfit so she deserved to be raped.
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  They're criminals, they're mentally ill, they have twisted minds, bad upbrings, whatever the case may be.
[12:26.000 --> 12:33.000]  But they rationalize what they're doing. They're not actual sociopaths or psychopaths. They're predators, though.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  And they will decide that what they're doing is okay in their own twisted logic.
[12:39.000 --> 12:45.000]  And I've talked about this in the last few weeks here on air.
[12:45.000 --> 12:55.000]  Almost everyone I know is being shaken down in Austin, Texas, even in nice areas by folks.
[12:55.000 --> 13:02.000]  And last night I had a white guy come up and say, I need money right now. You need to give it to me or, you know, things are going to go well.
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.000]  I was coming out of a grocery store at like 7 at night, this stuff's going on now.
[13:09.000 --> 13:14.000]  And I just ignored him, gave him a real serious look, got in the car.
[13:14.000 --> 13:20.000]  But the funny thing about it was, in the past I wouldn't carry all the time.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  But lately things have gotten so serious pretty much all the time.
[13:23.000 --> 13:27.000]  I've got, I started getting in the truck where I've, you know, got the firearm.
[13:27.000 --> 13:34.000]  It's sad that we've gotten to that, but definitely crimes up. Definitely there's some issues going on.
[13:34.000 --> 13:38.000]  And a lot of it's racial. This was a white guy last night who did the same thing.
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  He didn't say, give me money or I'll hurt you. He bugged his eyes out and said, you need to give me money. I'm not going to ask twice.
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  I said, what's that mean? And he turned and walked away because I didn't basically start urinating on myself.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.000]  But most people who've been domesticated and trained, I guess would give the guy money.
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  I had that happen a few weeks ago with a black guy came up, big black guy came up and did that.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  And we got real aggressive and bowed up and said, give me money right now.
[14:01.000 --> 14:05.000]  And I just basically, I didn't freeze up. I just got ready to fight.
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  And he turned and walked off to find somebody who was an easier target.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  I just started getting ready. I've gotten the point. I just can't put up with it anymore.
[14:11.000 --> 14:17.000]  I just started getting ready. And it happened to Anthony Gucciardi who's a writer here.
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  It happened to one of our computer people who's done consulting for us in the past.
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000]  Max Cabrera was on the news, getting beat up, broke his nose, four black guys, five black guys,
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  sexually assaulted his girlfriend on Sixth Street for no reason.
[14:31.000 --> 14:34.000]  The police have the videos. They said, no reason. They're just attacking.
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  So my point is this country's a powder keg and thug life has been promoted,
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  not just in the inner city black communities in it, but across the board.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  It's a gang mentality has been promoted in young people.
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  And that gang mentality has gotten into the military. It's gotten into police.
[14:50.000 --> 14:55.000]  It's a big problem. I mean, the military, they separate the 20% are now in hardcore criminal gangs,
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.000]  Crips, Bloods, Mexican mafia, different Aryan groups.
[15:02.000 --> 15:07.000]  I mean, it's just things are reverting back to kind of a road warrior scenario.
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.000]  This is what happens with dumb down populations.
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  You don't associate with a gang of liberty and freedom and due process and being honorable.
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.000]  That's the real gang is having a good family name and people know they can do business with you.
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.000]  No men are reverting to like a mindless sports culture. That's all they care about.
[15:24.000 --> 15:29.000]  All they care about is, you know, I'm not knocking sports, but it's become gladiatorial like Rome.
[15:29.000 --> 15:35.000]  And we are a degenerating society. So that's why we're watching Ferguson very, very closely.
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.000]  It's a powder keg coming up the latest on Obamacare.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  And I want to open the phones up. I'll give the number out in the next segment.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  Here comes Gruber tape number five.
[15:44.000 --> 15:49.000]  The Obamacare architect saying basically what Zuckerberg said of Facebook,
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  Americans are dumb aphors. They're dumb. We deceive them. Ha, ha, ha.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  We rip them off. More tapes on that. There's so much coming up.
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  And Bill Cosby, I'll tell you what I think about that. Stay with us.
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[16:12.000 --> 16:19.000]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[16:19.000 --> 16:26.000]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  We now have the synergistic solution.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  DNA force, just one of the key compounds.
[16:34.000 --> 16:42.000]  BiopqQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.
[16:42.000 --> 16:45.000]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[16:45.000 --> 16:50.000]  The ultimate value cutting edge trailblazing game changer that also supports the InfoWars.

[17:01.000 --> 17:06.000]  Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.000]  based around the key concepts of super oxygenation, the next level in cleansing is here.
[17:11.000 --> 17:14.000]  With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies,
[17:14.000 --> 17:17.000]  the new oxy-powder, available through InfoWars Life,
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies.
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients,
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  often times full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[17:31.000 --> 17:36.000]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[17:36.000 --> 17:41.000]  Oxy-powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[17:41.000 --> 17:47.000]  Instead, oxy-powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.

[20:33.000 --> 20:38.000]  Well, it's now publicly admitted that Obamacare, by its own architect,
[20:38.000 --> 20:44.000]  was paid $400,000 to help write it from MIT.
[20:44.000 --> 20:48.000]  It was written to massively increase healthcare costs on healthy people
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  and to lower the quality of everybody else's healthcare
[20:53.000 --> 20:57.000]  and centralize it so that big insurance companies could force you to buy insurance
[20:57.000 --> 21:01.000]  and then give you low quality coverage and could jack up prices
[21:01.000 --> 21:07.000]  and get past old state laws that didn't let them basically gouge people.
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  That's why the Republican leadership, Boehner and McConnell,
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  have said they can't repeal it or they don't want to repeal it
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  or they can't repeal the whole thing.
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  Here comes Gruber tape number five.
[21:17.000 --> 21:25.000]  Was this written by my adolescent children by any chance as he makes front of a crowd?
[21:25.000 --> 21:29.000]  Melissa Francis said that when she worked at CNBC,
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  they stopped me from telling the truth about Obamacare.
[21:33.000 --> 21:38.000]  I was silenced and told not to warn people on the financial channel.
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.000]  Here's another headline out of CBS News.
[21:41.000 --> 21:45.000]  Children will be fined, close quote, if you fail to sign up for Obamacare,
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  people are going to be in for a shock.
[21:47.000 --> 21:52.000]  Oh yeah, it'll be thousands per person, 5,000 per person.
[21:52.000 --> 21:56.000]  And it doesn't matter if you even have insurance like my parents have on Blue Cross, Blue Shield,
[21:56.000 --> 21:59.000]  they've already had their prices doubled last year.
[21:59.000 --> 22:04.000]  They just got a letter because Blue Cross, because they haven't had claims basically ever.
[22:04.000 --> 22:08.000]  Because of that, they're going to be fined on top of having their insurance
[22:08.000 --> 22:12.000]  because it's too low, even though it just doubled.
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.000]  So I hope everyone enjoys that.
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  CBS News reports the penalty is meant to incentivize people to get coverage,
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  said senior analyst Laura Adams of insurancequotes.com.
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  This year I think a lot of people are going to be in for a shock.
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  The financial penalty for skipping out on health coverage will be more than triple.
[22:32.000 --> 22:37.000]  In 2015, up to 2% of income, depending on which is higher,
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  children will be fined at half the current rate.
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  Isn't that nice? Children will be fined.
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  And you can't keep your doctor in it.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  I mean, just a total screw job.
[22:48.000 --> 22:56.000]  And they admit it's a new tax, but the money goes to corporations.
[22:56.000 --> 23:00.000]  That's what the big banking regulation changes have been, is to shut down small banks.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  The big boys are in control.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  Crony capitalism.
[23:05.000 --> 23:13.000]  Gruber has been grubbered again, saying stupid Americans falling off a building.
[23:13.000 --> 23:18.000]  That's the article out of WorldNet Daily, where he says, yeah, when people discover it and he laughs,
[23:18.000 --> 23:21.000]  he says it'll be like falling off a building.
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.000]  We've got all five clips, and we'll play those in the next segment.
[23:25.000 --> 23:28.000]  But I'm tipping out the plan. Everybody's already heard them a bunch.
[23:28.000 --> 23:31.000]  They're on infowars.com and prisonplotter.com.
[23:31.000 --> 23:37.000]  You know what he said, kind of like one of the main architects is E.C. LeManuel, doctor is E.C. LeManuel,
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  admitted, yeah, there's death panels.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  Yeah, we're going to ration care.
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  That's meant to ruin health care and force you into a single-payer system,
[23:44.000 --> 23:47.000]  but still administered by private groups.
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  So you just get a private government, not privatization.
[23:50.000 --> 23:57.000]  Private institutions with government power gang-raping you and your family.
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  But here's a big question.
[23:59.000 --> 24:04.000]  They jump the shark with the banker bailout, tens of trillions of dollars of foreign banks.
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  They've done all this other stuff and gotten away with it.
[24:06.000 --> 24:08.000]  Have they gone too far?
[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  Because they will go too far. That's the nature of evil.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  They will go and go and go. They're not accountable.
[24:13.000 --> 24:17.000]  They're compartmentalized, so it's hard to finger one person that's behind it.
[24:17.000 --> 24:22.000]  That's why they get away with so much is because it is a bureaucracy,
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  a corporate and governmental interface.
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  But how much can they get away with?
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  What is a bridge too far?
[24:28.000 --> 24:29.000]  Is there any end?
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.000]  Is there any bottom to the abuse?
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  They now have drones flying around.
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  That's being reported by mainstream news.
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.000]  Here on the stack, stealing your cell phone data for the NSA.
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  Police departments under federal grants have put up fake cell towers everywhere,
[24:45.000 --> 24:51.000]  stealing your data illegally. All of it's a felony, but they do it.
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  And sometimes they actually stop bad guys with it, but there's a reason we don't have this
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  because it's illegal because Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia did it,
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  but our founders made it illegal because they'd lived under it 230-something years ago.
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  There's a reason we've been prosperous.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  We've never been perfectly free, but we tried to stay free.
[25:10.000 --> 25:14.000]  If you don't withdraw your support from tyranny,
[25:14.000 --> 25:18.000]  if you don't resist oppression, there is no bottom.
[25:18.000 --> 25:21.000]  The bad guys take over. There's no checks and balances.
[25:21.000 --> 25:23.000]  Everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  Look at all the decadent signals we see.
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  Look at the cycle we're in. We're in the bottom of a very, very decadent cycle.
[25:29.000 --> 25:33.000]  I want to pull out of this now before Katie bar the door.
[25:33.000 --> 25:38.000]  Here's the toll-free number I want to hear from you on Obamacare, on Gruber.
[25:38.000 --> 25:43.000]  How far will they go? Will the Republican leadership get away with not repealing Obamacare?
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  I don't want to hear about repealing some of the provisions. I want it all gone.
[25:47.000 --> 25:51.000]  But are they counting on our stupidity?
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  Are they counting on the fact that we're ignorant?
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  I think the political realignment of two weeks ago says something different.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  Doesn't mean I think Republicans will save us, but it shows the public's angry.
[26:00.000 --> 26:04.000]  The Democrats have had the biggest losses they've had since 1921.
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.000]  And in the states, since pre-Civil War.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  So this is a big deal. The Republican leadership better know they're in trouble.
[26:13.000 --> 26:17.000]  But plus, are you going to let the globalists totally bankrupt and loot the country?
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  Obama says he's about to sign executive orders for totally open borders.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  And illegalize anybody that can get here.
[26:23.000 --> 26:27.000]  And you have amnesty status to any kid in the world as a refugee, period.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  If they're poor or reason to come here, that'll bankrupt us overnight.
[26:31.000 --> 26:34.000]  That's the plan. Bring us to our knees. Make us dependent on them.
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  Cloward and Piven.
[26:37.000 --> 26:41.000]  Gun control. He says he's going to use the UN Treaty to restrict guns in the new year.
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  Treaty goes into effect that we haven't ratified.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  The 24th is a Christmas gift to us. Christmas Eve.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  I want to get your take on all this.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.000]  First-time callers 877-789-ALEX.
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  And again, you don't have to even be a first-time, but long-time.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  Have it called in in six months? I want to hear from you.
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.000]  I want to give new folks a chance, or folks that haven't been able to get in in a while.
[27:04.000 --> 27:11.000]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  The Sunday number is a different number than the weekday,
[27:16.000 --> 27:19.000]  as we produce the whole show in-house here on Sundays.
[27:19.000 --> 27:23.000]  877-789-2539.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  And we will get you up and on the air here today.
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  You can also shoot Twitter questions, tweet at Real Alex Jones,
[27:31.000 --> 27:34.000]  and tell me, you know, any questions or comments you've got.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.000]  We'll try to read some of those out on air.
[27:36.000 --> 27:41.000]  That's Real Alex Jones on Twitter as well.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  How much will you put up with the question?
[27:44.000 --> 27:49.000]  Because the average person that had health coverage has seen it doubled.
[27:49.000 --> 27:52.000]  If you were poor under Medicaid or Medicare, depending on your age,
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  you already got basically free health care.
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  There's all these charity health care systems.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  Folks just don't know how to access them.
[27:59.000 --> 28:02.000]  We had the best health care in the world just 30 years ago.
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  Government involvement with Special Interest and big HMOs and insurance companies,
[28:06.000 --> 28:11.000]  looting things, has now put us way down the line in health care.
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  And now they're getting ready to wreck it.
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  They don't want the average person to have it.
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.000]  They're getting ready to loot this as just another government tax.
[28:19.000 --> 28:20.000]  They always want more.
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.000]  But this time, they split the money with the federal government.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  Some of the states get some of the money.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  And then the private corporations.
[28:27.000 --> 28:30.000]  And the average small local insurance company that does a good job
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.000]  and takes care of people, they're going to be shut down.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  That's what this has all been done for.
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  The big insurance companies stock us up.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  The small insurance companies are shutting down.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  It's about monopolies.
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  877-789-Alex, look forward to taking your phone calls coming up.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  We've got the latest on ISIS, Bill Cosby.
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  We'll also look at NRA, Warrens of Obama, fueled in-run around
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  Constitution on gun rights.
[28:53.000 --> 28:57.000]  It's all coming up in the latest on Ebola as well.
[28:57.000 --> 29:18.000]  Stay with us.
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  Whether it's survival shield, nascent iodine or DNA force,

[30:05.000 --> 30:08.000]  I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[30:08.000 --> 30:09.000]  It has changed my life.
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.000]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now, counting the weight,
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.000]  staying in shape.
[30:13.000 --> 30:17.000]  InfowarsLife.com, you've heard the callers of the show.
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine
[30:19.000 --> 30:21.000]  and your super male.
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  After this, I was barely walking.
[30:23.000 --> 30:26.000]  Now I'm able to function as a human again.

[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  fluoride shield, oxy powder.

[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  InfowarsLife.com.
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.000]  The X2, just amazing what it's able to do to actually detox
[30:48.000 --> 30:49.000]  the body.
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.000]  It's great stuff.
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.000]  To promote something, it's got to be something I personally use
[30:53.000 --> 30:54.000]  and that I believe in.
[30:54.000 --> 30:57.000]  Check out InfowarsLife.com today and the entire line

[32:07.000 --> 32:09.000]  Security, alert.
[32:09.000 --> 32:11.000]  This is Homeland Security.
[32:11.000 --> 32:15.000]  Analysis, InfowarsBuilding, independent media operation.
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  You let the worst people get controlled and tell us
[32:17.000 --> 32:20.000]  that we are the ones responsible.
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  Prime Directive, discredit Alex Jones.
[32:22.000 --> 32:25.000]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theory.
[32:25.000 --> 32:28.000]  A popular conspiracy theory talk show called Infowars.
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.000]  Alex Jones is now in an Austin Jail.
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  These people are assaulting us.
[32:32.000 --> 32:35.000]  Targeting of patriots engaged.
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  They are never going to stop.
[32:37.000 --> 32:39.000]  They're never going to deviate from their program

[32:51.000 --> 32:53.000]  You've got to set your eye on the enemy.
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  Don't worry about what propaganda they put out.
[32:56.000 --> 33:25.000]  Surely it's for God you can fail it.
[33:32.000 --> 33:38.000]  It was back in 1996 when I first interviewed
[33:38.000 --> 33:42.000]  the author of Compromise, Clinton Bush,
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  and the CIA, Terry Reed.
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  I don't want to find him and get him back on.
[33:47.000 --> 33:51.000]  Get him on in like five, six years.
[33:51.000 --> 33:58.000]  And he was there at Mina Arkansas
[33:58.000 --> 34:01.000]  and saw Bill Clinton and saw Republican leaders
[34:01.000 --> 34:04.000]  and others at the airport
[34:04.000 --> 34:07.000]  where the goodies were coming in.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  And I've interviewed a lot of other eye witnesses
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  and folks about that.
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  And we said at the time that the 1993 election
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  was basically staged
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  and that they were working together behind the scenes
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  and it had been released later
[34:19.000 --> 34:24.000]  that George Herbert Walker Bush met 11 times publicly
[34:24.000 --> 34:28.000]  but also a bunch secretly more than any other governor
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.000]  when he was president with Bill Clinton.
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  And of course it's come out that Bill Clinton
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  and Hillary are both CIA trained
[34:36.000 --> 34:38.000]  and that George Herbert Walker Bush was.
[34:38.000 --> 34:40.000]  They tried to keep that secret
[34:40.000 --> 34:43.000]  and said that he was made director never being there.
[34:43.000 --> 34:47.000]  But it was declassified that he was even in Dallas in 63
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  and ran a bunch of covert operations.
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  So that's the truth.
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  So now in the Daily Mail,
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  he's my brother from another mother.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  George W. Bush gushes about unlikely pal Bill Clinton
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  who ousted his father from the Oval Office.
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  Yeah, right.
[35:05.000 --> 35:08.000]  And it is just so ridiculous.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  And these guys have this charity together
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  for the Haitians and the rest of it.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  And the Clintons keep like half the money
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  for their own private airplanes and things.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  It's just such a joke.
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  This is everything wrong with politics in this country.
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.000]  But I remember all these insiders
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  that I would interview,
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  the folks from the Clinton Chronicles,
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  state police officers,
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  Bill Clinton's former chief of staff
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  when he was governor,
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  all these people that were confirming
[35:39.000 --> 35:44.000]  that it was totally staged.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  Here's Clinton tweeting,
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.000]  receive my copy of 41 by 43 George W. Bush touching tribute.
[35:51.000 --> 35:54.000]  See, you can't have like North Korea dictatorship,
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  so they just have these Rhino Republicans
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  working with Democrats behind the scenes,
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  and that's how they continue their control.
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  And who are the Bush type Republicans targeting
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  with the Tea Party right now?
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  I'm going to go to your phone calls here on Obamacare,
[36:10.000 --> 36:15.000]  and look at this story.
[36:15.000 --> 36:20.000]  D.C. police plan for future seizure proceeds
[36:20.000 --> 36:24.000]  years in advance in cities budget documents.
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  D.C. police have made plans for millions of dollars
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  in anticipated proceeds from civil seizures.
[36:30.000 --> 36:32.000]  That's why there's a quota.
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  Cash and property, even though the federal guidelines
[36:34.000 --> 36:36.000]  say agencies may not commit to such spending.
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.000]  Yes, see, they had state asset for future seizure for 30 years.
[36:40.000 --> 36:42.000]  It got very corrupt and no due process,
[36:42.000 --> 36:44.000]  just taking the money out of your wallet,
[36:44.000 --> 36:45.000]  no drugs, nothing illegal found.
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  So we got a law passed federally, you couldn't do it.
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  So the feds have another law passed.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  You can have asset for future seizure
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  as long as it's federally run.
[36:53.000 --> 36:56.000]  You can get up to 90% of the proceeds back.
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  So now the police grab the money,
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  give it to the feds and get it back at the department level.
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  If it's state level, it goes into a general fund
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  and they don't see it.
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  That's in the Washington Post.
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  And now they are trying to turn the police
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  into nothing but pure pirates.
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.000]  Just like the IRS, no judge, no jury, no indictment.
[37:18.000 --> 37:20.000]  The New York Times reported three weeks ago,
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  takes the bank accounts of people with no criminal record
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  because their deposits are small
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  and they say that shows evidence of criminal activity.
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.000]  No judge, no jury, no due process.
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.000]  And hey, death panels, that's illegal.
[37:35.000 --> 37:36.000]  They're doing it.
[37:36.000 --> 37:37.000]  It's in Obamacare.
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  They say it's legal now.
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  Ranking over the coals.
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  What won't you put up with?
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  Well, you already put up with quite a bit.
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  So the sky's the limit.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  You're going to put up with a lot more, boys and girls,
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.000]  as the government, the criminal elements of it,
[37:51.000 --> 37:54.000]  publicly ship in the majority of the narcotics,
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  show when dummies, low level,
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  go out and sell it at the residential retail level,
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  they can grab them up and get that money as well.
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  That is quite a business operation.
[38:05.000 --> 38:08.000]  And there's not one cop I've talked to in 15 years
[38:08.000 --> 38:13.000]  that doesn't go, of course, the fed ship in most the drugs.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  And the CIA Inspector General, back in 97,
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  came out and admitted, yes, we do this.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  And a month and a half ago that he classified
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  that the CIA targeted Gary Webb,
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  the award-winning journalist who wrote Dark Alliance
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  and exposed CIA drug dealing.
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  He's been vindicated, it's all now come out.
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  Of course, they went to his house and shot him twice in the head.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  A lot of them cartels, too, though,
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  they want to keep the drugs illegal, they've been threatened.
[38:37.000 --> 38:40.000]  It was mainly cartels that were threatening Gary at the end.
[38:40.000 --> 38:44.000]  Because they didn't want to shake up the apple cart.
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  They need to keep drugs illegal
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  so it's not treated as a disease and it's pathetic
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  and then it's not cool and stylish.
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  You make it illegal, it's like the roaring 20s
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  with alcohol prohibition.
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.000]  Everybody want to be involved in it.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  They say cocaine should be as cheap as basically a bag of tea.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  It grows as easily.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  Cheaper than chocolate.
[39:09.000 --> 39:12.000]  But it's not.
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  I don't know, I haven't looked at the prices lately
[39:14.000 --> 39:17.000]  but it's a lot of money.
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  And that's an example, but with the other hand
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  the government pushes a new freedom initiative
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  from the Clintons, from the Bushes,
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  the forced drugging of kids, the forced psychological assessment
[39:25.000 --> 39:29.000]  of kids in public schools.
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.000]  So again, I ask you, what is it you won't put up with?
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  How about our government funding al-Qaeda?
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  Changing their name to ISIS to confuse the public
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  when the military woke up to it.
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  War with ISIS, Islamic militants have an army of 200,000.
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  That's now being an independent.
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  Remember I told you it was 300,000?
[39:48.000 --> 39:51.000]  Because that's how big the jihadi al-Qaeda army is.
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.000]  It's renamed, it's not 16 or 25,000 like they've been saying.
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.000]  It's over 200,000 conservatively.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  I got an email while back going,
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  why do you say it's 200 something thousand?
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  Why it's 1500, 1600, 16,000 or whatever it is?
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  I'm like, because this is al-Qaeda army,
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  we know how big it is, and wait till they attack us
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  because they're a real terrorist group.
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  It's just the globalists above us have funded them,
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.000]  turned them loose to come and go after us.
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  And then our military gets to go fight and die
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  fighting a real enemy,
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  but that was funded and manufactured
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  by the very same globalists that run our country.
[40:26.000 --> 40:29.000]  Until we realize how the world really works and grow up,
[40:29.000 --> 40:32.000]  ship the drugs in, create the crisis off of the solution,
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  build prisons everywhere,
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  launder the money back to the police departments,
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  their asset formage of seizure, and the big banks.
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  You ever hear about big banks that launder,
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  get caught laundering billions, getting in trouble?
[40:43.000 --> 40:44.000]  No you don't.
[40:44.000 --> 40:47.000]  Or they pay a 1% fine.
[40:47.000 --> 40:50.000]  But you, or your kids gets caught with a marijuana cigarette,
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  there's gonna be hell to pay.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  You're not supposed to pull up to a checkpoint
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  in a free country and ask, do you have any drugs, guns,
[40:58.000 --> 40:59.000]  or paraphernalia in the car?
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  As if guns are illegal.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  They do that in Texas and Missouri and all over.
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  Well, what do you mean do I have any guns?
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  Yeah, I've got a M4 right here.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  Oh, I need you to go right over here.
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  Get out of the car, you got a gun.
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  See, it doesn't matter we fought to have the law
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  but understand we've got the right to that M4.
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  The police have been told to act like it's illegal
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  or act like it's bad.
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  In perception in Hollywood does that.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  We're going to break and coming back with Bob,
[41:27.000 --> 41:31.000]  Sherry, Ryan, Rachel, Andrew, Robert, John, Ronnie, Robert,
[41:31.000 --> 41:34.000]  Itamio, Ron, Anthony.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  We're going to all of you straight ahead
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  but be ready because each caller gets about a minute
[41:38.000 --> 41:41.000]  because I want to move to the next person.
[41:41.000 --> 41:44.000]  We will sell out of this as unfortunately
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  I predicted by tomorrow.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  It is the best seller we've ever had.
[41:49.000 --> 41:52.000]  It is Secret 12, two years in the making.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  I've been taking it for about four to six months.
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  I took an earlier version we were testing.
[41:56.000 --> 41:59.000]  This is the same type that you basically inject
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  and in the studies and things.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  It's just a lot more absorbable sublingual.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  You don't inject this though.
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  But this is the same type that you inject.
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  Well, 80% of it is, it's the methylcobalamin
[42:10.000 --> 42:12.000]  and then it's the other 20%.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  It's all organic and it's amazing.
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  It is the purest form of nutraceutical grade,
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  vitamin B12 fusion out there and it's incredible.
[42:21.000 --> 42:22.000]  Most stuff is synthetic.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  Most stuff is not absorbed.
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  When you take it by pill or take it in your mouth,
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  this is Special Secret 12,
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  developed by InfowarsLife.com
[42:30.000 --> 42:35.000]  and our researchers, our doctors, our chemists.

[42:39.000 --> 42:42.000]  or call 888-253-3139.

[42:56.000 --> 42:59.000]  888-253-3139.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  Discover the secret.
[43:01.000 --> 43:03.000]  When you're out on the road,
[43:03.000 --> 43:08.000]  the last place you want to be is on the road.
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  But if the unfortunate happens,
[43:10.000 --> 43:13.000]  you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[43:13.000 --> 43:17.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[43:17.000 --> 43:22.000]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[43:22.000 --> 43:26.000]  They're so bright in every stitch,
[43:26.000 --> 43:30.000]  guarantee you love the way they fit.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch
[43:33.000 --> 43:35.000]  where you need it most.
[43:35.000 --> 43:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it.
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  Others don't.
[43:41.000 --> 43:43.000]  We turned jeans inside out.
[43:43.000 --> 43:45.000]  Diamond gusset jeans,

[47:04.000 --> 47:07.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:07.000 --> 47:11.000]  Radio Active
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  We're here to be active.
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  We're here to try to have a free society.
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  Not be overrun by criminals.
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  When you lay down, criminals take over and overrun you.
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  They got lots of fancy excuses for why.
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  Ron, Anthony, all of you, Bob, Sherry, everybody.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  We are
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  going to be going to your phone calls,
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  ladies and gentlemen.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  In fact, we're gonna go to them right now.
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  Ron in Florida, I see on the screen,
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  is asking, why is Gruber not being sued?
[48:08.000 --> 48:09.000]  If you don't know who Gruber is,
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  he's one of the main architects of Obamacare,
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  met at least 10 times with Obama in private,
[48:15.000 --> 48:16.000]  and then there's a video.
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.000]  We played Friday.
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  Bragg that he and Obama said,
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  the public can't know it's gonna increase prices,
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  and they came up with a deception.
[48:25.000 --> 48:26.000]  For the dumb Americans,
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  I mean, these are words they use,
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  so you ask, why is he not being sued?
[48:30.000 --> 48:31.000]  Yeah, we're all being affected.
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  We can all have a class accident suit.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  But why would they be so bold?
[48:38.000 --> 48:39.000]  Why would they say
[48:39.000 --> 48:40.000]  that it would cut your healthcare in half,
[48:40.000 --> 48:41.000]  and it doubles it?
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  Why would they say there weren't death panels,
[48:43.000 --> 48:44.000]  and there are?
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  Why would they be,
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  because they think we're done, folks?
[48:47.000 --> 48:50.000]  Ron in Florida, that's a great question.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  What's your take on that?
[48:52.000 --> 48:55.000]  My take is that we have a giant Ponzi scheme,
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  and every state, the states are our only hope,
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  because they can call an article 5 convention,
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  and we can pass amendments,
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  and we can take over the power of impeachment,
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  and get rid of the people in Washington,
[49:05.000 --> 49:06.000]  which is a corporation.
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  People don't know that.
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  But we should sue everyone who's involved with this scam,
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  with this criminal fraud.
[49:12.000 --> 49:15.000]  Thing is, you know, we're the lawyers.
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  Don't we have any conservative lawyers?
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  I only hear about Judicial Watch,
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  Jerry Stuckalo, and ACLJ,
[49:21.000 --> 49:22.000]  and that's about it.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  It took them to get Lois Lerner's email.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  Well, I know this.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  I've always been against having a constitutional convention,
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  because the globalists could use it to take over,
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  but they're already doing it to begin with.
[49:32.000 --> 49:35.000]  So, yeah, we should have the states withdraw,
[49:35.000 --> 49:36.000]  have a con con.
[49:36.000 --> 49:37.000]  It's in the Constitution,
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  and then declare the federal government,
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  basically null and void,
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.000]  and overthrow all these unconstitutional actions
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  through the power of the state votes.
[49:47.000 --> 49:50.000]  And that's why they teach you there's no state power.
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  The states can do nothing.
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.000]  Because the states are the answer.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  They are the check and balance that's there.
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  Great point. Good to hear from you.
[50:00.000 --> 50:03.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob.
[50:03.000 --> 50:07.000]  Bob in North Dakota, you're on the air.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  Alex, love your show, man.
[50:09.000 --> 50:10.000]  I love your brother.
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  You're a fellow brother in the fight here.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  Two very important things.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  A while back on Rush Limbaugh,
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  I heard that he came up with the discovery
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  that the IRS cannot fine you if you don't have Obamacare
[50:22.000 --> 50:25.000]  if they don't owe you a refund.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  If they owe you a refund or show them money,
[50:27.000 --> 50:28.000]  they can fine you.
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.000]  So, everybody should structure their taxes as such
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  so that they don't owe you a refund
[50:33.000 --> 50:34.000]  and they can't fine you.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  I don't know how long that's going to last,
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  but that's out there.
[50:36.000 --> 50:37.000]  All right, let's be clear.
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  They said day one they would take the refunds in the bill.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  We read the subsection on air probably 30, 40 times.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  And they would go on CNN and MSNBC.
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  If anybody wonders why CNN's collapsing,
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  being dumped off Dish Network,
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  being dumped off cable systems all over the country,
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  it's because they went on TV and said it was racist
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  like MSNBC, that there was no fine.
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  There was no tax.
[51:00.000 --> 51:02.000]  Everyone now knows they're a fraud.
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  They have destroyed themselves.
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[51:05.000 --> 51:06.000]  Yeah, they're liars.
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  There's a communist news network.
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  Secondly though, in the Golden Silver Exchange
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  here in North Dakota, there's a free CD out.
[51:13.000 --> 51:14.000]  I have yet to get it,
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  but apparently it talks about how the New World Order
[51:17.000 --> 51:21.000]  is planning on crushing the dollar here next fall.
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  And I thought that that's what a coincidence
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  that also next October, next fall,
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  that's when the last of the four blood moons hit.
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  And you know how symbolic the New World Order is.
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  I really think something bad is going to happen here
[51:34.000 --> 51:35.000]  around next fall.
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  I want to know if you heard anything about that.
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  Well, all the economists say the next year is critical.
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  The economy's been sliding for a long time.
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  They've been papering over it with fraudulent jobs,
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  numbers, and inflation numbers.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  And that's admitted, and for the average person,
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  it's really rough.
[51:48.000 --> 51:50.000]  If you're in a boon town or in the right business area,
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  you're doing good because our economy is somewhat diverse
[51:53.000 --> 51:56.000]  when it comes to entertainment and services.
[51:56.000 --> 52:00.000]  But if you go into a depression with a service economy,
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  you're not collapsing.
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  You're dead.
[52:03.000 --> 52:04.000]  It's road warrior.
[52:04.000 --> 52:07.000]  So yes, the globalists are obsessed with astrology,
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  obsessed with blood moons.
[52:09.000 --> 52:10.000]  I'm not.
[52:10.000 --> 52:11.000]  They are.
[52:11.000 --> 52:12.000]  I've been to Bohemian Grove.
[52:12.000 --> 52:13.000]  I've covered skull and bones.
[52:13.000 --> 52:14.000]  I've covered the UN.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  They tell our kids to be atheistic,
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  but they're into the occult.
[52:19.000 --> 52:22.000]  And these blood moons certainly do have something to do with it.
[52:22.000 --> 52:23.000]  I appreciate your call.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  Thank you so much, Bob.
[52:25.000 --> 52:28.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sherri in Texas.
[52:28.000 --> 52:30.000]  You're on the air.
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  Hi, Alex.
[52:31.000 --> 52:32.000]  Thank you.
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.000]  Here's an overview, as I see it.
[52:34.000 --> 52:36.000]  All is a means to an end.
[52:36.000 --> 52:39.000]  If you're going to ban the guns and not the drugs,
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  and the drugs are a means to an end.
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  In other words, you take certain drugs.
[52:43.000 --> 52:44.000]  You're denied certain guns.
[52:44.000 --> 52:47.000]  And also, if people are arrested and booked,
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  then they can be exploited.
[52:49.000 --> 52:52.000]  The more they know about us, the more they can use against us,
[52:52.000 --> 52:53.000]  the more they can deny it.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  Sure, that's it.
[52:54.000 --> 52:56.000]  I mean, you look like slavery's outlawed,
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  and then they bring in prohibition
[52:57.000 --> 53:00.000]  just so the government can make money off the black market.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  People get smart and get rid of that after 10 years.
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  Right then, they made narcotics illegal
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  that were sold at corner drug stores
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  with much lower drug use level,
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  because losers took that stuff.
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  Everybody knew it.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  Or you might take Lodinum, which was opium.
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  We had a really bad toothache, you know, once a year.
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  But there were attic problems,
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  but there wasn't a black market,
[53:18.000 --> 53:23.000]  because a bottle of Lodinum in 1925 cost about 10 cents.
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  A bottle, a brown bottle, I've looked it up,
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  cost about 25 cents of opium,
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  with more than 20 dosages of it.
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.000]  And there wasn't a black market.
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  There wasn't drug addicts everywhere.
[53:34.000 --> 53:35.000]  They made it illegal.
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  So the Roosevelt family that had a monopoly on the shipping
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  and end could now have a black market
[53:40.000 --> 53:41.000]  and make even more money.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  And folks, if you don't know about that, look it up.
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.000]  And I admired Teddy Roosevelt on many fronts.
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  I didn't admire Theodore Roosevelt,
[53:48.000 --> 53:51.000]  but, you know, the family was the main dynasty
[53:51.000 --> 53:56.000]  bringing in opium and making it into heroin.
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  That was a U.S. invention, by the way.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  Thank you so much for your call.
[53:59.000 --> 54:02.000]  I mean, the public parent, people when I say this,
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  send me emails saying you're a conspiracy theorist.
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.000]  It is a fact that Coca-Cola from the day it was made
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  and Dr. Pepper from the day it was made,
[54:11.000 --> 54:14.000]  Dr. Pepper was the first soft drink developed in Texas
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  at a pharmacy in Waco.
[54:17.000 --> 54:21.000]  From the day it was made, had cocaine in it.
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  Other brands of soft drink, tonics,
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  you had to have mixed at the drugstore.
[54:25.000 --> 54:29.000]  You'd go to the drugstore, they would mix different herbs in,
[54:29.000 --> 54:34.000]  including caffeine, opium, heroin, cocaine, you name it.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  That's why Coke's called Coke.
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  And the Coke flavor is a decokinated,
[54:42.000 --> 54:46.000]  like decaffeinated coffee, cocaine.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  That's why they always joke and say,
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  they have a big safe, the secret ingredient,
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  it's all a big joke, it's cocaine.
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  That's how dumb down the public is.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  The secret ingredient is cocaine.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  The cocaine facilities in South America
[55:00.000 --> 55:04.000]  and Central America on record are the global distributors
[55:04.000 --> 55:07.000]  of legal pharmaceutical cocaine
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.000]  using a bunch of different surgeries.
[55:11.000 --> 55:14.000]  And by the way, this is all verified info,
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  but you won't see it on television.
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  So it's all a big joke.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  It's all a big joke, need to understand that.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  They wouldn't have an excuse to break down your door
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  or have secret spies or checkpoints.
[55:25.000 --> 55:29.000]  Notice they use the drug war to build a police state.
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  And then now they use the drug war to quote,
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  say everybody's a terrorist and then vice versa.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  Or they pass anti-terror laws like the Patriot Act
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  and then use it on the American people
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  in non-terror related cases.
[55:40.000 --> 55:41.000]  This is how the scam works.
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  One more call before we go to break.
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  Then we'll go to Robert John, Ronnie Robert,
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.000]  Itamio, Anthony, Ryan, and others.
[55:48.000 --> 55:51.000]  Andrew in Illinois, you'll take us out of the shower.
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.000]  Go ahead.
[55:52.000 --> 55:55.000]  Yeah, I started out having paid health insurance,
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  but now they make me pay it.
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  My guaranteed insurance is taking away.
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  Now next year it might double.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  I almost wish I wasn't a legal alien there to be free.
[56:04.000 --> 56:05.000]  Well, that's right.
[56:05.000 --> 56:08.000]  And almost everybody who was part-time is now,
[56:08.000 --> 56:11.000]  who's full-time is going to part-time to get out of Obamacare.
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.000]  And as you hear, public schools all over the country
[56:14.000 --> 56:17.000]  are firing their teachers and rehiring them part-time.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  Oh, my.
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  Plus there was hundreds of department homeland security vehicles
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  were found in Chesterfield.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  What's that all about?
[56:26.000 --> 56:30.000]  The government is in a multi-billion round armored vehicle
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  buildup against us.
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  They're publicly training to quote take on returning veterans,
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, Christians,
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  evangelicals.
[56:38.000 --> 56:42.000]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  The backlash is, though, it woke up the military and police
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  that they were openly called in the last three years
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  and prepared for war with anybody that isn't a total criminal.
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  But let me ask you this.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  How far do you think they can go?
[56:55.000 --> 56:56.000]  Have they gone too far?
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  Will Obamacare get repealed?
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  I hope so.
[57:01.000 --> 57:02.000]  I hear you.
[57:02.000 --> 57:03.000]  I hear you, Andrew.
[57:03.000 --> 57:04.000]  God bless you.
[57:04.000 --> 57:05.000]  All right.
[57:05.000 --> 57:06.000]  Here's the toll-free number to join us.
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  877-789-2539.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  We've got a bunch of callers on hold.
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  But our system's computerized.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  We turn it on and off.
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  We're opening the phone system right now to fill up those lines.
[57:16.000 --> 57:21.000]  877-789-Alex, second hour straight ahead.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  Call after call after call.
[57:23.000 --> 57:27.000]  We've got an update with Jakari Jackson and Joe Biggs in Ferguson.
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  We've got calls about Ferguson.
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  Folks want to talk about that.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  And more.
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  In fact, Ryan's up next.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  Says Ferguson to be a lot bigger than expected.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  We'll find out why he thinks that more.
[57:38.000 --> 57:39.000]  This is real radio.
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  Americana, common sense.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  That's why they call us radicals.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  That's why they call us terrorists.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  Well, King George called the founders terrorists.
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  We just want freedom.
[57:48.000 --> 57:52.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[58:22.000 --> 58:51.000]  We're calling 888-253-3139.
[58:58.000 --> 59:02.000]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[59:02.000 --> 59:07.000]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth,
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  nerve growth, and rejuvenation.
[59:09.000 --> 59:14.000]  But no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health,
[59:14.000 --> 59:19.000]  nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[59:19.000 --> 59:25.000]  We now have the synergistic solution, DNA force, just one of the key compounds.
[59:25.000 --> 59:32.000]  BIO-PQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.
[59:32.000 --> 59:35.000]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?
[59:35.000 --> 59:40.000]  The ultimate value, cutting edge, trailblazing game changer that also supports the InfoWars.

[59:44.000 --> 59:48.000]  or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[59:48.000 --> 59:51.000]  DNA force from InfoWarslife.
[59:54.000 --> 59:57.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  I'm going to go to Ryan so he has plenty of time for the next segment for Missouri, so as far as it's going to be a lot bigger than expected.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  We've got our reporters that are on the ground there.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Gun cells are up 300% in Missouri right now and fears of rioting as the media basically fans the flames of that when this verdict comes out
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  on the police officer that shot a black man.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  I've seen a lot of bad officer shootings, that one in Albuquerque where they shoot the homeless guy who's unarmed
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  and then let the dog bite him and make fun of him and turns out the cop driving up on his police video
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  driving up says, I can't wait to kill this guy.
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  I mean, we would just tell you the truth if the cop was bad.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  He was just physically attacked and charged, but it doesn't mean the police should shoot reporters with rubber bullets for no reason.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  In fact, can you guys queue up the video where they come up?
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  We'll have so much cussing on it and threaten to shoot bigs.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  I'll eff and kill you.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  And that cop was suspended. I wonder if he's still suspended.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  I mean, you don't need that guy driving a bus man, much less being a cop.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  Come up to just peaceful reporters doing nothing and saying, I'll eff and kill you.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  So I appreciate my reporters volunteer to go up there.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  I had Jakari and big say to me, Hey, are you ready?
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  I want to go up there and said, I'm not going to send you up there.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  You know, I'm not going to put you on the spot and say, Hey, I want you to go.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  They were ready to go.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  So they're going to pop in the bottom of the hour.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Let's go to the bottom of the call list and talk to Anthony in New York.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  Then we'll go to Ryan, Tim, Robert, John, Ronnie, Robert.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  And well, we come back to, I'll go to my pronounce that right.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  I pronounced that it Tommy.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  Oh, or how do you sit?
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Okay, good.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  We'll, we'll, we'll get to that fella as well.
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Anthony in New York, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  I'm all right, brother. What's on your mind?
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:58.000]  I'm very good.
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  You know, of course, you know, there's the PDD 51, you know, president's director 51.
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  Yes. Tell us what PDD 51 does.
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  Well, what it basically does is that any kind of traffic event, economic, social,
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  or any event that can actually create, it can become a full dictator.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  Basically our constitution is invalid.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  Yep.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  And Bush signed that and then Obama expanded PDD 51 and said for any crisis,
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  including economic, Congress is suspended.
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  You name it.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:32.000]  How sensational is that?
[1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  You know, I've covered that so many times over the years.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  I forget to bring that back up that that's why the president thinks he can
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  operate outside the constitution and law is they're claiming that he can be a
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  dictator because of the crisis.
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:50.000]  And you know that under, you know, the gun treaty that's going to take effect next month,
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  all we have to do is create a situation and basically he could just suspend the
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  constitution and take our guns away.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  Basically, he can do that.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  You're right.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  And, but they haven't announced those powers, though they're operating under an
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  emergency.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  The question is moral authority.
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  If Congress doesn't go along with this and if Congress says no, you can't legalize
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  the illegals.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  No, you can't restrict the Second Amendment.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:16.000]  No, you can't shut off the power plants.
[1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  No, you can't launch wars without authorization.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:22.000]  Then they can have a conflict where they started peaching him.
[1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  The question is, why haven't they impeached him so far because they're intimidated?
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  Not only that, but they have a lot of, they don't have a lot of during and basically
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  you have the NS, the, what do you call it?
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  NSA.
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  Correct.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:38.000]  Yes.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  Basically, you know, they have a lot of during all these politicians.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  I think they know that they have them in their pocket.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  So that's why they haven't impeached him yet.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  Well, that's it.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  And so they can blame him for the agenda when it's bigger than Obama.
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:52.000]  Exactly.
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:58.000]  And the Republican leadership, Boehner and, and, and Mitch McConnell and John McCain
[1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  can shit over there behind closed doors with Harry Reid and Pelosi and all this other trash
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  and act like there's opposition.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  And that's how they keep fooling us.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  That's how this keeps happening is this bait and switch.
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  I don't think the American people are, are, are totally dumbed down now to this.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  I think they're starting to get wise.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  One more thing.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  I saw on the internet that this is kind of crazy that you're a double agent.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  I mean, like a CIA agent.
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  I mean, that's crazy.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  Well, I mean, if the CIA is putting out what I'm putting out, then they're good.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  But no, I don't work for the CIA.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  Never met anybody.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  The CIA.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  I've said that I've had family.
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  That's the same.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  I had a family that works for Coca-Cola.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  It's so big.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  They recruited heavily out of Texas that did stuff with the CIA.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  A lot of family in the army and stuff.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  And they all told me, you're right, man.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  The government's evil.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  This stuff's all going on.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Good job.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:50.000]  So yeah, I mean, people say on the internet that I'm Bill Hicks and I'm a Vatican agent.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  I work for Israel.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  I'm a space alien.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  If I am a space alien, then we need more of these space aliens because I'm fighting for
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  freedom.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  I'm pro-human.
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  Even though I'm an alien.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  I first got online and I seen the price of the X2 and the DNA force.
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.000]  I was a little hesitant, but I pulled the trigger on it.
[1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  It has changed my life.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  I've been taking it for about 24 days now, counting the weight, staying in shape.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  InfoWarsLives.com.
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  You've heard the callers to the show.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  Several months back, I started taking your nascent iodine and your super meal.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  Prior to this, I was barely walking.
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  Now I'm able to function as a human again.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  Whether it's survival shield nascent iodine or DNA force, super meal vitality, super
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  female vitality, lung cleanse, fluoride shield, oxy powder.

[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  It's great stuff.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:52.000]  If I'm going to promote something, it's got to be something I personally use and that
[1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  I believe in.

[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:34.960]  giant political diversion. I mentioned this, so I'll cover it now and then go to your phone
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:43.800]  calls. Ryan and many others that are patiently holding on this live Sunday edition. Bill
[1:07:43.800 --> 1:07:51.800]  Cosby's attorney calls rape allegations decades old and discredited. That's from CNN. Bill
[1:07:51.800 --> 1:07:56.460]  Cosby refuses to address sexual assault allegations on NPR interview will no longer appear on
[1:07:56.460 --> 1:08:03.960]  David Letterman's show. The stunning fall of America's dad is what page six says of
[1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:09.680]  the New York Post. Bill Cosby raped me. Why did it take 30 years for people to believe
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:19.240]  my story? You know, everything in this country is about power. And Bill Cosby has criticized
[1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:25.920]  gang thug culture and hip hop. Bill Cosby doesn't have a criminal record. And now you
[1:08:25.920 --> 1:08:30.440]  got a bunch of people that were behind closed doors of Bill Cosby 20, 30 years later saying
[1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:36.080]  he raped him. He may have done this, but my gut tells me it's probably not true or it's
[1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:44.320]  exaggerated. It is now standard for women and divorces. I mean, psychologists will tell
[1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:51.440]  you this, it's in the criminology. Because the feminists teach all sexes rape to say
[1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:57.200]  that you've been raped or to say if you argue with a woman, it's harassment. You argue with
[1:08:57.200 --> 1:09:02.680]  your wife, it's harassment now. Not allowed to do that. And you've got Dinecore caught
[1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:09.440]  running child kidnap slaves in the Associated Press, the Wall Street Journal and the Chicago
[1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:13.520]  Tribune. Six, seven years ago, congressional hearings, they didn't get in trouble. Kidnap
[1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:20.080]  kids. They didn't say where are the kids out of Europe. You've got ISIS killing 300 plus
[1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:23.920]  thousand people under the al-Qaeda name in Syria, blowing up hundreds of churches. It's
[1:09:23.920 --> 1:09:31.320]  no big deal. But you've got Hollywood clearly with sexual abuse, clearly of young children
[1:09:31.320 --> 1:09:34.880]  going on, major coverups. I know a lot of folks in Hollywood, they've talked about it,
[1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:43.840]  told me about it. So it's going on. I mean, look at the Catholic priesthood where they
[1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:48.360]  would go and say, you know, I'm having homosexual thoughts when you're 14 years old or whatever,
[1:09:48.360 --> 1:09:51.520]  the stories have been in the news. And they say, well, join the priesthood because there's
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:56.520]  like a group within it recruiting people in. Look at Penn State. That's clearly bigger
[1:09:56.520 --> 1:10:01.640]  than what we were told. We've talked about Penn State 10 years ago when I had a John
[1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:06.240]  DeCamp on the guy that wrote the Franklin coverup saying that Boys Town and separately,
[1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:10.080]  Penn State was a pedophile ring. And then it came out. I was delaying him when he was
[1:10:10.080 --> 1:10:12.960]  saying on there, I was like, delay that, delay that. I'm like, look, we're not saying that.
[1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:19.520]  There's no proof. It came out later. So those of us that aren't into this stuff can't even
[1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:28.160]  imagine it, but it's going on out there. But then I see Bill Cosby with no proof, no indictments.
[1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:32.680]  Now that he's that quote has been the system's done with him, they're not killing him like
[1:10:32.680 --> 1:10:35.880]  a lot of Hollywood stars end up getting killed. It's come out to get their insurance money
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:39.840]  or to make them big again. You know, so, so, so the people that own, you know, their managers
[1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:46.640]  can get some money. Bill Cosby is being politically assassinated right now. And he may be guilty
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:51.080]  of throwing some woman down and doing something. I don't know. It's the fact that the media
[1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:56.200]  is jumping on this and piling on him. Let me tell you, folks, when Bill Clinton settled,
[1:10:56.200 --> 1:11:00.640]  not one, not two, not three, not four, it was more than five cases. I've interviewed
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:06.520]  these women on air. We need a broader, if you name it, when he settled rape cases, Gloria
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:11.240]  Stein and the feminists wouldn't say a word, they would attack those women. I've interviewed
[1:11:11.240 --> 1:11:16.400]  the guy who saw Clinton going in with Jennifer Flowers and got his legs broken by the state
[1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:20.760]  police. I've interviewed the people that saw the kids basically being killed on the railroad
[1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:24.880]  tracks in Mina. I mean, I believe me, I've been doing this 20 years. I know every angle
[1:11:24.880 --> 1:11:30.480]  of it. When they want to cover up for somebody, they cover up. So when they go after Bill
[1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:38.320]  Cosby, I don't put any stock in it because 30 years later, especially when you become
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:43.520]  a quote celebrity, I'm nothing like Bill Cosby, but I have 15, 20 million listeners a week.
[1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:48.440]  I had a caller earlier, you know, going, let me ask you a question. I heard you're a double
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:55.880]  agent of the CIA on the internet. Is that true? Well, people say I'm puff the magic
[1:11:55.880 --> 1:12:01.400]  dragon on the internet. They say I'm a space alien. They say I work for a judge a tree
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:08.360]  by its fruits. Don't just throw out a mindless allegation. What do I do? I promote the Second
[1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:13.600]  Amendment, family values, freedom, sovereignty, a renaissance. I've never done anything wrong.
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:18.960]  I've never been indicted. I've never been in trouble. And the truth is I've talked
[1:12:18.960 --> 1:12:24.080]  about some family I've had that have been in the CIA who told me you're right about
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:30.680]  all this. I saw it. That's why I told those stories. That's where that comes from. But
[1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:38.920]  it doesn't matter if the CIA talked and acted like me, I would support them. And quite frankly,
[1:12:38.920 --> 1:12:43.960]  it's CIA whistleblowers like Tosh Plumlee, Ray McGovern. I mean, he was the one of the
[1:12:43.960 --> 1:12:47.160]  top analysts in the country, Ray McGovern. He briefed Ronald Reagan and George Bush as
[1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:52.680]  their main briefer. He was in the CIA almost 40 years. He comes on and agrees with everything
[1:12:52.680 --> 1:13:03.080]  I say. So if the CIA was like Ray McGovern, I would be all for it. Same thing with all
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:09.720]  these NSA whistleblowers. I've had the former director, a director of the NSA on five times
[1:13:09.720 --> 1:13:14.920]  my show, a couple times David Knight, agreeing with everything I say. A global, panopticonic,
[1:13:14.920 --> 1:13:19.320]  computerized, predict the future, takeover of society, William Benny to create total
[1:13:19.320 --> 1:13:27.080]  tyranny. I've talked to folks like him and others. When they were just a decade ago,
[1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:30.560]  15 years ago, the NSA wasn't doing all this illegal stuff. They were targeting foreign
[1:13:30.560 --> 1:13:36.680]  governments that they should be. There are a lot of good people in the government. But
[1:13:36.680 --> 1:13:42.520]  you've got a lot of dumbed down people on the internet, just like, what's his name?
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:46.600]  This Gruber guy saying that people are dumb. Just throw slogans at him. It's the same deal.
[1:13:46.600 --> 1:13:50.520]  Instead of being a real intellectual, having real facts, you just say, oh, Alex Jones
[1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:55.480]  is bad. He's been proven to be this. So yes, I work for the Vatican. I work for Israel.
[1:13:55.480 --> 1:14:00.720]  I work for the CIA. I work for space aliens. I am Bill Hicks. I am all these other people.
[1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:04.720]  No, I'm none of those people, folks. But it wouldn't matter if I was because it's what
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:11.720]  I say and what I stand for that matters. And it isn't a show about Alex Jones. But I have
[1:14:11.720 --> 1:14:18.600]  experienced people wanting to target you and people wanting to shake you down because you
[1:14:18.600 --> 1:14:24.600]  give them a job or because you let them get around you. They use the fact that, I mean,
[1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:29.520]  I'll hardly be in a room alone with somebody that in my family. And I know so many, Jesse
[1:14:29.520 --> 1:14:36.920]  Ventura won't do it either, especially a woman because they'll just make stuff up. And that's
[1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:41.520]  how immoral our society is. People think you get ahead making stuff up and being a drama
[1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:47.080]  queen. Instead, no, you really still get ahead being honorable, not screwing people over,
[1:14:47.080 --> 1:14:52.440]  doing what you say you'll do, telling the truth. See, I'm so honorable is why people
[1:14:52.440 --> 1:14:56.080]  always attack my honor. Because the system taps my phones. The system knows what I've
[1:14:56.080 --> 1:15:00.840]  done for 20 years. They know who my family is. They know I come from a good family. They
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:05.760]  know I'm an American as American as it gets. I mean, quite frankly, I'm as American as it
[1:15:05.760 --> 1:15:12.440]  gets. The whole pedigree is ridiculous, okay? Founding Texas, Mayflower, 1776, everything.
[1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:19.120]  You want me to talk about me? I'm good. I love God. I love justice. I love freedom.
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:23.200]  I love you being wealthy and successful. There's a bunch of crooks that hate my guts, and they
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:27.320]  think you're so stupid. They can go out and say, oh, he's a right winger. Oh, he's a racist.
[1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:31.800]  Oh, he's a, he works for Israel. Oh, he, he doesn't bash Israel. I mean, you go to the
[1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:36.400]  white supremacist sites. They don't attack Benjamin yet in YAHE. They don't attack Ben
[1:15:36.400 --> 1:15:41.880]  Gurion. They don't attack Jesus Christ. They attack me. Why do you think the most globalist
[1:15:41.880 --> 1:15:45.400]  fed run organizations in the world talk about how they want to kill me all day? Because
[1:15:45.400 --> 1:15:49.640]  they hate my guts, folks, because they're fed run. I want to bring humanity together.
[1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:54.760]  I want prosperity. I want freedom. I want a future. That's who I am. And what I've produced
[1:15:54.760 --> 1:16:01.760]  and what I stand for stands on its own. Your calls are coming up.
[1:16:31.720 --> 1:16:36.280]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time,
[1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:40.480]  they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms. Can you put two and
[1:16:40.480 --> 1:16:45.760]  two together? Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and 308

[1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:05.480]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has
[1:19:05.480 --> 1:19:10.000]  been told not to drink the water. Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:15.680]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[1:19:15.680 --> 1:19:20.200]  single day? If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:23.000]  Connect residents forming long lines throughout the day.

[1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:30.640]  was. To stay safe and healthy during a crisis,
[1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:35.680]  you must have access to safe, clean water, water which will not be available at your

[1:21:13.880 --> 1:21:19.160]  I think it's going to be a lot worse than what the average people out on the street
[1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:23.600]  even. I've lived in North St. Louis for a long time.
[1:21:23.600 --> 1:21:30.600]  I don't think it's going to be as big as the Watts Riot, but I just want to say that
[1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:37.680]  there's around 12 people in my family and we're the worst people in this country. It's
[1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:45.240]  full of veterans. It's full of Eagle Scouts. It's full of survivalists. It's full of freedom-loving
[1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:46.840]  patriots.
[1:21:46.840 --> 1:21:51.240]  We all own weapons. We're all informed. We all have a plan A and B. This is the first
[1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:58.240]  time in my two decade life that my dad has called the plan A into action. I know it has
[1:21:58.240 --> 1:22:05.240]  a lot to do with where we're located, but we are at our resort or our retreat property
[1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:11.680]  right now just waiting this out because of course they're not going to do it at the end
[1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:14.720]  of the week where the average person is more happy. They're going to do it at the beginning
[1:22:14.720 --> 1:22:18.440]  of the week where the average person is just in general more upset.
[1:22:18.440 --> 1:22:23.280]  Well, that's what's sick. They seem to do all this stuff to make it as bad as possible.
[1:22:23.280 --> 1:22:29.280]  Right. Then this thing with Bill Cosby, Bill Cosby, they're down with them. They just threw
[1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:34.360]  them on the bus and every news channel talking about this is kind of subliminally about the
[1:22:34.360 --> 1:22:41.360]  day before, a couple of days before it's released. Just getting people pumped up. All the local
[1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:48.360]  news channels and LA, you can see them on YouTube. They're fear mongering. The unorganized
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:58.600]  public is no match for the organized police slash military. It's the same thing these
[1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:02.000]  days. They want to have some of these riots because then they can get more police state
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:06.240]  funding and further bring this country into a tyranny. The average cop doesn't want that,
[1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:10.640]  but we're here to decompartmentalize that. Thank you for your call. Bill Cosby bashes
[1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:15.840]  thugs and welfare moms. We can't blame white people. I'm telling you, this is political
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:20.760]  folks. He's come out and criticized Obama. He says you can't blame white people. And
[1:23:20.760 --> 1:23:27.760]  then there's never any proof of all this rape garbage. It's 30 year old and he just won't
[1:23:27.760 --> 1:23:32.920]  respond. The media is like, you're bad. You're bad. They don't. All I'm saying is when there's
[1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:36.440]  real stuff that's proven, the media won't do anything about it. But when they pick somebody
[1:23:36.440 --> 1:23:40.720]  to destroy them, they'll do it. And I just don't pile on. That's all I'm saying. He may
[1:23:40.720 --> 1:23:47.720]  be guilty, but you know what? You're innocent until proven guilty. The last several years
[1:23:48.200 --> 1:23:53.240]  Cosby has criticized president Obama for a range of broken promises and rallied against
[1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:57.560]  entitled Americans for their thuggish behavior and incessant willingness to remain uneducated.
[1:23:57.560 --> 1:24:02.760]  He's talking about black Americans. And so he's not with the program folks. So bye bye
[1:24:02.760 --> 1:24:09.760]  Bill telling you this is a hit job. A hit job. Anybody can see it. That's all I'm saying.
[1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:16.880]  He may have actually done it, but it's selective enforcement. John in FEMA region five, you're
[1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:22.320]  on the air. Yeah, I like how you do today. Good brother. Thanks for holding. Hey, listen,
[1:24:22.320 --> 1:24:28.640]  I got an idea is money talks and you know, as long as Congress is not going to act, why
[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:35.640]  don't we just not pay our bills for insurance or pay what we used to pay instead? That's
[1:24:36.120 --> 1:24:39.160]  right. I mean, I mean, if enough Americans did it, it might do something, but they'll
[1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:44.920]  just dump your insurance or still find you. I'm wondering how they get away with it when
[1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:49.400]  it doubles or triples premiums has death panels and the main architect laughs at people and
[1:24:49.400 --> 1:24:55.440]  says it's a giant screw job. I screwed you how it then stays in place and Boehner and
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:25:02.440]  the Republican leaders won't repeal it. Well, I think the globalists have got an eye and
[1:25:03.200 --> 1:25:07.880]  their finger on the pulse of everything that's in everybody's closet in the Republican party.
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:12.520]  So that's why they're not doing anything or they'll manufacture it. Exactly. Bill Cosby
[1:25:12.520 --> 1:25:19.360]  is a message. Listen, you stay in your place and you do what you're told or we'll destroy
[1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:23.840]  you. So that's why there's got to become a point where if there's some patriot like
[1:25:23.840 --> 1:25:29.440]  Rand Paul or Ted Cruz and folks pop up and clan outfits at their rally and say, I love
[1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:33.120]  Ted Cruz or Rand Paul, you got to know it's a setup. And back when that happened, Rand
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:37.520]  Paul was running for Senate and then won the primary. I said on there, I said, let's search
[1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:42.600]  out these people's faces. Folks, you know who they are? They were democratic party operatives
[1:25:42.600 --> 1:25:49.120]  working for the party, dressed up like racists saying racist things with rebel flags, meaning
[1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:54.560]  to demonize Rand, but it didn't work. We caught Democrats down at an event in Houston
[1:25:54.560 --> 1:26:00.800]  last year saying racist stuff with the whole Trayvon Martin deal. This is what they do.
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:06.880]  They race bait. And so we don't just knee jerk believe something when it's put out immediately.
[1:26:06.880 --> 1:26:11.400]  God bless you. Good to hear from you. Ronnie in Texas. Speaking of Rand Paul, go ahead.
[1:26:11.400 --> 1:26:18.160]  Yes, I think it's remarkable that Dr. Rand Paul is now acknowledged as a major leader
[1:26:18.160 --> 1:26:24.760]  of the Republican Republican Party by a very same lame scheme media who for decades went
[1:26:24.760 --> 1:26:31.840]  way out of their way to ignore and or belittle his father, my hero, Dr. Ron Paul, Senator
[1:26:31.840 --> 1:26:39.360]  Dr. Rand Paul actually filibustered against the tyrannical NDAA that now gives our truly
[1:26:39.360 --> 1:26:47.200]  evil president the legal authority to seize and or execute anyone without trial on the
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:52.440]  virtual whim of our dictator in chief. That's right. Great point. And that ties in Ronnie
[1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:58.320]  to PDD 51 and the new executive order where Obama expanded an earlier executive order.
[1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:03.440]  Folks just Google PDD 51 and new executive order give Obama dictator power for any crisis
[1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:09.520]  including economic for any crisis, including economic, he can suspend Congress. You name
[1:27:09.520 --> 1:27:13.880]  it. Well, I don't care if you sign an executive order saying that we're not going to let Congress
[1:27:13.880 --> 1:27:20.880]  say okay and do that, but he is about to use UN treaties. You name it to supersede Congress.
[1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:26.040]  We are at a crossroads right now. Thank you, Ronnie. Robert in California. You want to
[1:27:26.040 --> 1:27:32.640]  talk about Groober's Goober's. Go ahead. Hey, brother. Hey, man. Hey, good. Groober's
[1:27:32.640 --> 1:27:39.120]  Groober's. Obamacare is a fraud. Isn't that fraud committed by all three branches and
[1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:45.600]  quoting the code case policy? How many felonies do we have to have to prosecute? Well, it
[1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:49.840]  is a felony when you get paid $400,000 to write a report for Congress saying it's not
[1:27:49.840 --> 1:27:54.720]  a tax. And then you laugh and say we deceived them. We weren't transparent. It was a tax
[1:27:54.720 --> 1:28:02.400]  and dumb Americans. I mean, he's confessing in five videos now. And in one saying when
[1:28:02.400 --> 1:28:06.400]  I met with the president, he said, I can't in I can't let folks know it's going to increase
[1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:10.840]  their prices. So they figured out a system, the line of people. I mean, I played that
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:17.200]  clip like four times last week. And it's just they're literally crapping on us and rubbing
[1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:21.720]  it in. And I'm sorry to use that analogy. I don't use profanity. I don't use gross language,
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:27.540]  but that's the only way to describe it. That's what I'm saying. How much do we have to put
[1:28:27.540 --> 1:28:35.200]  up with? How much? That's my question. Listen, I got a question, another one. If we take
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:42.680]  and report this to a federal judge as a crime against Obamacare, what do you think is happening?
[1:28:42.680 --> 1:28:46.040]  I think it's a great question. In fact, I'm glad you called in on the topic. I want to
[1:28:46.040 --> 1:28:50.440]  hear from listeners coming up and we talked to our reporters for a few minutes from Ferguson.
[1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:55.400]  What do we do about this? This guy's dancing on our grave politically, freedom wise if
[1:28:55.400 --> 1:29:00.800]  we don't bring into justice. I mean, this guy has engaged in fraud in my view.

[1:32:23.480 --> 1:32:34.440]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.

[1:33:34.880 --> 1:33:42.800]  I've been watching and I've been waiting. Monday through Friday, 11am to 2pm central.
[1:33:42.800 --> 1:33:49.040]  Of course, return weeknight, 7am central, InfoWars Nightly News, find the tales at infowarsnews.com.
[1:33:49.040 --> 1:33:53.400]  We have the live Sunday transmission. We're live, 4-6pm central. Every Sunday we want
[1:33:53.400 --> 1:33:57.440]  to thank all the new affiliates. I mean, we're getting like two, three new affiliates a week
[1:33:57.440 --> 1:34:03.480]  right now. We're getting close to 200 affiliates. Very exciting on the weekday show. Well over
[1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:08.660]  100 on the weekend show. Very exciting. And the reason I started this weekend show seven
[1:34:08.660 --> 1:34:14.680]  years ago was to give big stations and little stations alike a taste of the show. It's pretty
[1:34:14.680 --> 1:34:20.200]  radical. I mean, 2 plus 2 equals 4 is pretty much illegal at the Department of Education.
[1:34:20.200 --> 1:34:25.160]  So that's radical in races as well. We're kind of like 2 plus 2 equals 4 here. Freedom's
[1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:30.360]  good. George Washington's good. Family's good. Keeping some of your money's good. You know,
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:35.680]  just bad stuff. Bad people. And it's worked great. I mean, the stations usually pick it
[1:34:35.680 --> 1:34:41.120]  up on Sunday for a few months, then put us on weeknights or take the daytime show and
[1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:46.240]  re-air it. And then we go live. And they end up putting us on and removing the establishment
[1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:51.440]  talk show host. And that shows America is waking up, ladies and gentlemen. Very, very
[1:34:51.440 --> 1:34:57.160]  exciting infowars.com is the news website. But my job's easy. I just study history, common
[1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:03.440]  sense and try to just get up here and tell the truth and tell you my opinion on things.
[1:35:03.440 --> 1:35:09.680]  I want to go to Clavin and Brian and Atomio and Robert and Robert and Gerald and Damien
[1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:15.760]  and Tim and Ryan. I will get to everybody, but tomorrow we're going to have Jakari Jackson
[1:35:15.760 --> 1:35:20.280]  and, of course, Joe Biggs, our reporters who got hit with rubber bullets and tear gas, you
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:24.400]  name it, a few months ago in Ferguson. They're going to be there, alerting the grand jury
[1:35:24.400 --> 1:35:31.280]  verdict on the Brown shooting case. And again, from what we've seen, a lot of evidence points
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:36.000]  towards the cop telling the truth. But the whole handling of it seems like a Psyop. So
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:40.120]  very suspicious. We're going to get Jakari Jackson's take. We've also got their filed
[1:35:40.120 --> 1:35:46.720]  report on infowars.com, where we're talking about a 300% increase in gun sales in the
[1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:51.080]  state. We've got those interviews with gun dealers, you name it. And Jakari's report,
[1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:57.000]  the call before the storm has gone viral as well. So Jakari, just give us a recap so far
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:02.240]  of what you see going on and what you think is going to happen. What's your gut tell you?
[1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:06.360]  Jakari Jackson reporting live just north of Ferguson, Missouri. Yeah, like you talked
[1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:10.360]  about in that report, Alex, we had a chance to go to West Floris and yesterday walk the
[1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:16.240]  streets and we saw gun, not so much gun owners, but we saw shop owners boarding up their windows,
[1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:20.240]  their establishments, and none of them really want to talk on camera. But they were telling
[1:36:20.240 --> 1:36:23.760]  us, yeah, we're very much concerned. You know, they think that that was exactly the
[1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:28.400]  call before the storm. And so people were making preparation. We saw several buildings,
[1:36:28.400 --> 1:36:32.720]  even a lot of phone stores, you know, your T-Mobile stores, your Boost mobile stores,
[1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:37.840]  they had their buildings completely boarded up in anticipation of this verdict coming
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:42.000]  down with Officer Wilson. And we had a chance, myself and Joe Biggs, we went to the liquor
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:45.880]  store today where Mike Brown was, and we were looking around trying to see if we could get
[1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:50.040]  a feel for it. And a lot of the locals were telling us here that they didn't think Mike
[1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:53.880]  Brown had gone to that particular store, or at least committed the crime that they said.
[1:36:53.880 --> 1:36:58.120]  He did stealing the, the Cigarillos or whatever they were from behind the counter. And I looked
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:02.160]  around and I'm about 6'1". I don't know how big Mike was, but I'm about 6'1". And
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:05.280]  where they were placed in that particular store, it'd been difficult for me to grab.
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:08.800]  Could somebody have done it? Yeah. But, you know, it takes my much larger than me. Like
[1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:13.800]  I said, I'm not exactly sure how big Mike was. But what do they say about the video
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:17.720]  that they report to be him? Well, a lot of people were saying that that wasn't
[1:37:17.720 --> 1:37:21.640]  him. Now, to me, it looked like it was him, especially if you contrast that with the footage
[1:37:21.640 --> 1:37:25.800]  or, I guess, the still images of Mike on the ground, I guess a few minutes later after
[1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:30.360]  his encounter with Wilson, he does appear to be wearing the same clothing, does appear
[1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:34.720]  to be the same body type, same body proportions. So also, to me, it did look like Mike, although
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:40.080]  some people dispute that it was him. All right. Anything else that you think you should
[1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:44.720]  add? I mean, do we have it? I mean, they were saying maybe tonight, maybe tomorrow. What
[1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:50.720]  then tell her you gathering on when the verdict may be from the grand jury on whether to indict
[1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:54.000]  the police officer? We've been hearing a whole lot that it's going to be tomorrow.
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:57.760]  Local news is teasing it. A lot of them don't want to come out and say definitive tomorrow,
[1:37:57.760 --> 1:38:02.880]  but a lot of people are speculating that it will be Monday when the verdict comes down.
[1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:07.240]  And we've also seen that a lot of churches are volunteering to care for school children
[1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:11.200]  because they anticipate the schools to be closed as well. So they say, hey, bring your
[1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:14.440]  kids over here to the church, to the rec center. We'll take care of them while you're at work
[1:38:14.440 --> 1:38:18.400]  and hopefully, you know, the riots won't affect the churches if the riots do happen.
[1:38:18.400 --> 1:38:24.240]  Anything else, Chicago, you want to add? No, we're here. We're ready. We got the gear.
[1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:28.200]  We got the infidel body armor. Joe Biggs is here. You know, we're going to be in the
[1:38:28.200 --> 1:38:32.440]  thick of it. You know, if it does turn ugly, hopefully it doesn't, you know, everything
[1:38:32.440 --> 1:38:37.440]  was calm around the quick trip yesterday. No, no protests, no anything. So hopefully
[1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:41.080]  it remains that way. But if it does happen to hit the fan, we'll be here to document
[1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:46.360]  it in for wars.com. That's right. Right around that grocery store, they got burned down. That
[1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:50.200]  seems to be the epicenter of the protesting. A lot of legitimate protesters, a lot of smart
[1:38:50.200 --> 1:38:55.000]  people out there, some, you know, unsavory groups coming into capitalize on it. They're
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:59.720]  talking about riots in Chicago, other areas. I mean, I understand people's concerned about
[1:38:59.720 --> 1:39:03.120]  a police state at the same time, though, I think it'll make the police state worse if
[1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:07.760]  people run around rioting. But if folks are angry, what could they do? Well, they could
[1:39:07.760 --> 1:39:12.360]  go vote or they could file lawsuits. I mean, I don't like the fact that Ferguson's like
[1:39:12.360 --> 1:39:16.760]  70% black and what there's two black police officers out of 50 something. I mean, there
[1:39:16.760 --> 1:39:22.080]  are some issues there, but running around just randomly getting mad. I don't think it's
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:26.960]  a productive jacari. What do you think? No, that's exactly how I feel. You know, if you
[1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:31.880]  want to have a peaceful protest, go talk to your police chief, go talk to the prosecutor,
[1:39:31.880 --> 1:39:36.480]  whoever it may be, but burning down this neighborhood is not going to solve anything.
[1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:40.040]  But the thing about it is a lot of these people coming to do this harm, they're not from
[1:39:40.040 --> 1:39:42.920]  here. You know, these guys, they come from Chicago, they come from wherever, wherever
[1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:46.680]  else they think it's like a cool, you know, instead of go out to the bar, to the club,
[1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:49.840]  you know, watch the game, let's go burn down a neighborhood and then they go back home
[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:50.840]  to their plus five.
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:54.080]  Well, yeah, we see that with sports fans all over the world too. It happens in South America,
[1:39:54.080 --> 1:39:58.480]  Europe, Africa, the US, everybody does it. It's a thug culture. And whether it's, you
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:02.800]  know, Northern England thugs burning something down or folks in Chicago, it's just a bunch
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:07.040]  of aimless youth that never grew up and never got a job. Thank you, Jacari. We're going
[1:40:07.040 --> 1:40:10.960]  to have you live tomorrow as all this unfolds and at night as the verdict comes out and
[1:40:10.960 --> 1:40:15.800]  be safe in the middle of that. You guys, you know, do as much as you want, but be safe
[1:40:15.800 --> 1:40:18.560]  because you guys volunteered to go up there. We appreciate your courage. We're going to
[1:40:18.560 --> 1:40:23.720]  come back in a moment and talk to Joe Biggs after he jumps in front of the mic there
[1:40:23.720 --> 1:40:28.160]  in front of the camera in just a moment. Then we're going to come back and race through
[1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:34.600]  Charles Calvin. Let's talk about Ferguson and Brian and Tim and everybody else. We're
[1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:39.120]  going to get to Ryan and Tennessee. You name it after this break, but if we've got Joe
[1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:43.560]  Biggs now in front of the camera, Joe, give us your quick take as a reporter and as an
[1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:49.040]  analyst on what you think is going to happen. Well, I honestly, I think all hell will break
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:54.960]  loose because we, we pretty much have a good feeling that, you know, officer Wilson will
[1:40:54.960 --> 1:40:59.920]  not be charged with a murder of Mike Brown and he will be released. The mayor of Ferguson
[1:40:59.920 --> 1:41:05.520]  has come out and said that if indeed he is cleared of all charges, he will be cleared
[1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:11.080]  to go back to work and work as a police officer on the beat out here on the streets. Now I
[1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:16.280]  don't know if that decision is purely up to them or if Wilson has any say in that, but
[1:41:16.280 --> 1:41:20.480]  if I were him, I would not want to be seen in this area again whatsoever. You know, I
[1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:26.800]  use social media quite a bit to talk with the people in this area who organized a lot
[1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:27.800]  of these protests.
[1:41:27.800 --> 1:41:31.400]  There was a protest today we tried to get to, but it started snowing so bad we weren't able
[1:41:31.400 --> 1:41:36.400]  to make it to because it was about 30 minutes south, global warming. But yeah, Al Gore,
[1:41:36.400 --> 1:41:40.760]  like you said, but you know, protests was relaying in the middle of the roads blocking
[1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:46.120]  a very ritzy neighborhood street and they had drawn chalk around them just like, you
[1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:50.240]  know, when someone dies on the road and they were all laying in the roads protesting there.
[1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:54.200]  Someone says, the snow is not going to stop us. We will come out. If you board up your
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:42:00.880]  windows, we'll just burn the building down. So everyone's very happy about attacking
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:05.200]  this entire place and just, you know, you know, riding and doing whatever, you know,
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:10.200]  what they're saying now is this is no longer, they're no longer considered protesters. They
[1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:15.240]  are considered people starting a revolution that they're hoping it'll spark a revolution
[1:42:15.240 --> 1:42:20.120]  across the U.S. where people in Atlanta, Chicago and other places will stand up against the
[1:42:20.120 --> 1:42:24.760]  police state and their way of doing it is with violence. And you know, they're calling
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:28.400]  out, you know, when I went to the gun store and spoke to the owner yesterday, you know,
[1:42:28.400 --> 1:42:32.000]  he pulled me aside and he said, you know, from what I see on Twitter and Facebook, just
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:35.960]  you being white is a good chance that you might get shot or something like that. And
[1:42:35.960 --> 1:42:41.720]  he was, you know, very concerned for, you know, our health and well-being. And I can
[1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:45.840]  understand that, but, you know, we're professionals. We're going to be out here. We've done this.
[1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:49.560]  We're going to document it. And, you know, I've got some other stuff to talk about. So
[1:42:49.560 --> 1:42:52.720]  if you want to come back, we can. Yeah, I want you to finish up quickly, Joe Biggs.
[1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:56.400]  We're going to go right to these calls. They'll be back on tomorrow as well with the weekday

[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:23.880]  research on the toxification of our bodies. Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the
[1:43:23.880 --> 1:43:29.000]  body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:34.560]  fillers, GMOs, additives or worse. Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules

[1:47:16.600 --> 1:47:30.640]  By the way, the Prime Minister of Canada got Putin's face and Putin left the G 20. I mean,
[1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:35.720]  stuff's really escalating. I want to go to your calls here in just a moment finishing
[1:47:35.720 --> 1:47:42.160]  up Joe Biggs reporting from nearby Ferguson. He's there in St. Louis. They're now saying
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:46.600]  the verdict should be tomorrow and they're reporting that all hell is probably going
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:50.960]  to break loose. That's what that's what the police are saying. In fact, the social media
[1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:56.080]  is pretty much saying they'll be a riot regardless of whether the cops and died it or not. That
[1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:01.000]  just sounds bizarre, Joe. Well, it's just like a sporting event. Say if the St. Louis
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:05.320]  Cardinals were in the World Series, people would take to the street, start flipping cars.
[1:48:05.320 --> 1:48:10.240]  It happens after Stanley Cups or one, you know, in a hockey game. So, you know, people
[1:48:10.240 --> 1:48:14.360]  riot when there's something positive and people riot when there's something negative. It's
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:19.600]  just a way for people to unleash that rage that they've had pent up all year.
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:24.340]  You know, I got some really good intel today that there are quite a bit of Homeland Security
[1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:30.600]  vehicles being spotted. I'd say about 20, 25 minutes out around the St. Louis area.
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:37.600]  There's a big block of the area and there was a Navy Veteran Thursday who posted a picture
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:44.440]  on Facebook and he works at the Chesterfield Mall and are at the Drury Inn Mall in Chesterfield.
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:49.360]  And what he did is he was driving through the parking lot to go to work and he saw tons
[1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:54.360]  and tons of DHS vehicles parked in there. And so he took a picture and took some video
[1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:59.320]  and posted it to Facebook and said, why are all these Homeland Security officers here?
[1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:05.320]  Well, he was called in Friday by his boss and told to take those down. Well, then my
[1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:11.880]  buddy runs a radio station here in St. Louis. He was called by this guy who was a Navy Veteran
[1:49:11.880 --> 1:49:16.160]  and he was called this morning and he was told he was fired. The Department of Homeland
[1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:21.880]  Security saw those pictures and the place where he works has also been fined as well
[1:49:21.880 --> 1:49:27.480]  for basically divulging secret information about where they're hiding.
[1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:31.080]  By the way, the press is allowed to do that. They shouldn't be intimidating folks. They
[1:49:31.080 --> 1:49:35.800]  shouldn't have let that guy go just because the feds told them to. But we see more and
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:40.480]  more of this. Joe, do a special report on that. Try to interview that guy. This is just
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:43.400]  outrageous. Great job. Any other intel?
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:47.360]  Well, like we said, it's pretty good chance it's going to happen tomorrow and the reason
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:52.000]  I say that is because on Friday the schools told the parents, hey, we're going to give
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:57.200]  your child extra homework that way for Monday when they don't come in, they can catch up
[1:49:57.200 --> 1:50:02.000]  on the work and be ready for Tuesday if things go back to normal. So with that being said,
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:07.320]  it looks like Monday. Also, some more mainstream media and news sources came into town today
[1:50:07.320 --> 1:50:13.120]  as well from out of town from New York and places like that for tomorrow. So give or
[1:50:13.120 --> 1:50:16.440]  take. Tomorrow is going to happen at some point in time and we're going to be out there
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:20.640]  at the courthouse as it happens, bringing you guys live up to date coverage.
[1:50:20.640 --> 1:50:24.920]  That's right. Tomorrow, 11 a.m. central and the nightly news at night, you're going to
[1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:29.400]  be there until the verdict there in Ferguson, Missouri. Great job, Joe. And I want to say
[1:50:29.400 --> 1:50:34.320]  thank you to infantile body armor for giving this. We appreciate it very much. It's nice
[1:50:34.320 --> 1:50:38.880]  to have this extra protection. Yeah, they're a good sponsor to thank you so much, Joe.
[1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:44.400]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, now let's go ahead and race through your calls. Tommy
[1:50:44.400 --> 1:50:47.920]  Oh, I think in California, thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:54.040]  Thanks, Alex. Welcome to your question about the amount of tyranny we will put up with.
[1:50:54.040 --> 1:50:58.960]  I just think it goes back to what Thomas Jefferson said. We're going to deal with it until we
[1:50:58.960 --> 1:51:05.080]  don't deal with it. If instead of this Obamacare legislation getting passed, just think if
[1:51:05.080 --> 1:51:10.080]  it was the Federal Reserve, we are voting for it. It would have got passed and we will
[1:51:10.080 --> 1:51:15.280]  have the Federal Reserve just like we have Obamacare. And it'd be 100 years of the same
[1:51:15.280 --> 1:51:20.120]  thing. So I just think that when people get tired, that's when they'll do something about
[1:51:20.120 --> 1:51:26.400]  it. I think for long as electricity works, we're content with the enslaved.
[1:51:26.400 --> 1:51:30.880]  I agree. I mean, humans have always been on the edge of extinction until modern times.
[1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:34.760]  So survival was winning. So as long as they give us the electricity and the chicken fee,
[1:51:34.760 --> 1:51:39.680]  we seem to put up with anything. The question is how far will this go where they admit Obamacare
[1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:44.880]  is meant to hurt us and bankrupt us and screw us over? I mean, why are they so arrogant?
[1:51:44.880 --> 1:51:50.280]  That's a question. Well, the arrogance comes from their natural
[1:51:50.280 --> 1:51:56.200]  proclivity to it. That's right. This is what they do. They said it before, we're going
[1:51:56.200 --> 1:52:01.280]  to do this to you. How will you respond? If you lay down, we're going to do more. If
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:10.080]  you lay down some more, we're going to do more until you rise up and actually begin to
[1:52:10.080 --> 1:52:15.200]  withdraw, you could sit from our criminal activity. We're going to engage in.
[1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:19.200]  I agree. And you do it by shooing them. You do it by shooing the architects that admit
[1:52:19.200 --> 1:52:24.400]  it's a fraud. You do it by not complying. You do it by saying no. You do it by getting
[1:52:24.400 --> 1:52:29.320]  involved, not by burning down your city. Thank you so much, sir. Great points. Brian,
[1:52:29.320 --> 1:52:32.800]  in FEMA Region 5, thanks for holding. What former state are you in?
[1:52:32.800 --> 1:52:33.800]  Wisconsin.
[1:52:33.800 --> 1:52:34.800]  All right. Welcome.
[1:52:34.800 --> 1:52:35.800]  All right. Welcome.
[1:52:35.800 --> 1:52:40.240]  Yeah, thanks. That was good to talk to you. I talked to you about three years ago and
[1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:45.200]  I wanted Ron Paul to get more hardcore and you suggested that we waterboard him with
[1:52:45.200 --> 1:52:46.200]  coffee.
[1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:49.680]  I don't remember that, but that's a funny idea.
[1:52:49.680 --> 1:52:56.200]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think we should waterboard the entire Congress with some coffee. As far
[1:52:56.200 --> 1:53:01.800]  as this Gruber character goes, he's like one of these hip, trendy, enlightened, sophisticated,
[1:53:01.800 --> 1:53:09.120]  no-better types. Why hasn't he been arrested? I mean, people talk about suing him. How come
[1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:11.320]  he hasn't been arrested? He's admitted.
[1:53:11.320 --> 1:53:16.920]  Well, I think a grand jury, he got paid $400,000 to produce a fraud to fool Congress and to
[1:53:16.920 --> 1:53:22.240]  fool the dumb voters and he admits it's his premeditated fraud. So he should be indicted
[1:53:22.240 --> 1:53:24.320]  by a grand jury for fraud.
[1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:29.280]  Absolutely. I just, I'm sitting there like, why is, you know, whoever's supposed to do
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:32.640]  this, why hasn't he, why they sitting on their hands?
[1:53:32.640 --> 1:53:36.920]  Well, it's in my opinion, that's the case, but there's not much opinion there. I mean,
[1:53:36.920 --> 1:53:40.880]  this thing is a giant screw job written by foreign banks that own the insurance companies.
[1:53:40.880 --> 1:53:44.440]  And I hear you. Good to hear from you. Great point. Thanks for holding. Tim in Missouri,
[1:53:44.440 --> 1:53:46.040]  you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:53:46.040 --> 1:53:48.040]  Alex, good evening.
[1:53:48.040 --> 1:53:49.040]  Good evening.
[1:53:49.040 --> 1:53:54.640]  Got a couple of things I'd like to mention. The tyranny that's going on at the federal
[1:53:54.640 --> 1:53:59.000]  level, I think the one of the ways the solutions we can stop this is with our constitutional
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:00.440]  sheriffs at the county level.
[1:54:00.440 --> 1:54:01.440]  Yes.
[1:54:01.440 --> 1:54:07.000]  Yes, we need to get sheriff select that'll follow the constitution. Great point.
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:12.240]  And one other thing I talked to another deputy here just yesterday and all these illegals
[1:54:12.240 --> 1:54:16.000]  that are coming across the border, he says they don't even ask for green cards now.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:19.600]  He says it's just useless. It's a mute point because he, what the president's going to
[1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:25.600]  do and they're overloading our system. We have ban loads of them coming up 35 in Missouri
[1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:28.720]  every day and there's nothing they can do about it.
[1:54:28.720 --> 1:54:32.920]  And they're above the law in the banks. Everybody cater because they're part of the plan to
[1:54:32.920 --> 1:54:36.880]  bankrupt the country. Nothing against these poor folks. They're leaving collapsed countries.
[1:54:36.880 --> 1:54:41.320]  They want to collapse us as well to then buy the country up for pennies on the dollar.
[1:54:41.320 --> 1:54:46.440]  This is agenda 21 program. You're absolutely right. So you're saying that the deputies
[1:54:46.440 --> 1:54:49.640]  up in your area, Missouri, are they aware of what's going on?
[1:54:49.640 --> 1:54:55.960]  Oh, yeah, they say they don't even ask for green cards. What they do is they arrest them
[1:54:55.960 --> 1:54:59.920]  for whatever the issue is. And when they have three hits, then they, you know, they can
[1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:03.400]  do something about it when they're arrested three times. But he says most of them don't
[1:55:03.400 --> 1:55:08.680]  even have driver's license or drive it on Mexican driver's license. You know, they're
[1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:14.760]  not even driving legally, but we have the book thrown at us and then it's just a romper
[1:55:14.760 --> 1:55:21.080]  room. Great point, Tim. Gerald in Arkansas, you're on the ear about the Obama unaffordable
[1:55:21.080 --> 1:55:26.920]  screw job healthcare act. Go ahead. Yeah, it basically Alex. I'm a first, first time
[1:55:26.920 --> 1:55:31.720]  caller, but I support you in what you're doing. I bless you. You're, you're a true
[1:55:31.720 --> 1:55:37.400]  patriot. And here's the thing that I have not heard anybody talk about. We're still under
[1:55:37.400 --> 1:55:45.320]  common law. Yes. Okay. Why does nobody understand that you, the code cannot, we're on the uniform
[1:55:45.320 --> 1:55:52.120]  commercial code. That's not talked about very much. So, so the code, if you put it in Google
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:57.960]  under uniform commercial code, you'll come up and then click on common law. It explains
[1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:03.040]  that we're still under common law and that we can bring a common law action. The code
[1:56:03.040 --> 1:56:10.520]  cannot preclude a common law action. We need to, we need to attack them with the constitution
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:17.720]  and what they have left us there to use where they can't. No, I hear you. There is a conspiracy.
[1:56:17.720 --> 1:56:21.640]  There is an organized corruption, a global government by select grips being formed. That's
[1:56:21.640 --> 1:56:26.840]  not public. But more than that, the system's so lawless. It's just groups of criminals
[1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:30.760]  in the system now just robbing everything. And they don't even care if the whole thing
[1:56:30.760 --> 1:56:35.400]  comes down. We've now reached the rats leaving the sinking ship level. I mean, it's bad.
[1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:40.840]  Thank you so much, Gerald. Go ahead. Let's take one quick call from Wayne in Texas. Last
[1:56:40.840 --> 1:56:45.400]  caller started the others. Wayne real fast on the UN gun treaty coming up on Christmas.
[1:56:48.520 --> 1:56:51.640]  Alex, can you hear me? I sure can. Go ahead. About 30 seconds.
[1:56:53.400 --> 1:57:01.560]  Okay. What I got is you put on your Paul Revere patch. The rest of us put on our Patriot patches.
[1:57:01.560 --> 1:57:06.920]  We go to Washington and we stand there with our long guns and tell them to come on out.
[1:57:07.480 --> 1:57:12.680]  Get out. And then we have a special election. Are you there? I'm listening.
[1:57:13.880 --> 1:57:18.920]  You have a special election and none of these that we've put under indictment are going to
[1:57:18.920 --> 1:57:23.960]  be able to run for office period because it all be under indictment. And then Rand Paul will have
[1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:28.840]  his day. I hear you. I mean, look, it's starting to come down to that. And I don't want violence,
[1:57:28.840 --> 1:57:33.160]  but they're violently wrecking the country, violently butchering the border, illegally
[1:57:33.160 --> 1:57:38.520]  bringing in everybody. I mean, that's why homeless Korea is set up to stop what you just said.
[1:57:39.480 --> 1:57:44.520]  So we're trying to 1776 peacefully in an info war instead of it going physical.
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:48.440]  I'll see you back tomorrow. Lord willing. God bless you all. Great job crew. Get out there and
[1:57:48.440 --> 1:58:01.080]  buy for freedom.
