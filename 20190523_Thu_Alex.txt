[00:00.000 --> 00:10.760]  Well, there's a new buzzword out there, and it's the Trumps-involved-in cover-ups.
[00:10.760 --> 00:15.720]  Here's what the president had to say in the Rose Garden yesterday after his meeting with
[00:15.720 --> 00:20.880]  the Crip Keeper, Nancy Pelosi, and the guy that said he'd get Trump seven ways from Sunday,
[00:20.880 --> 00:25.680]  or six ways from Sunday, old, chucky, Schumer.
[00:25.680 --> 00:28.760]  Things are going well, and I said, let's have the meeting on infrastructure.
[00:28.760 --> 00:29.760]  We'll get that done easily.
[00:29.760 --> 00:32.520]  That's one of the easy ones.
[00:32.520 --> 00:40.640]  And instead of walking in happily into a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said
[00:40.640 --> 00:43.240]  that I was doing a cover-up.
[00:43.240 --> 00:44.920]  I don't do cover-ups.
[00:44.920 --> 00:47.080]  You people know that probably better than anybody.
[00:47.080 --> 00:56.440]  And I was just looking at a list of some of the things that we just did more than 2,500
[00:56.440 --> 00:59.480]  subpoenas qualified for.
[00:59.480 --> 01:01.320]  And I let everybody talk.
[01:01.320 --> 01:07.440]  I let the White House counsel speak for 30 hours, 30 hours.
[01:07.440 --> 01:13.280]  I have 19 special counsel lawyers, 40 FBI agents.
[01:13.280 --> 01:15.240]  I said, open it all up.
[01:15.240 --> 01:19.400]  Let them have whatever they want, nearly 500 search warrants.
[01:19.400 --> 01:20.400]  Think of that as search warrant.
[01:20.400 --> 01:23.040]  Did you ever see a search warrant before?
[01:23.040 --> 01:24.120]  Neither did I.
[01:24.120 --> 01:27.560]  This was over 500 search warrants.
[01:27.560 --> 01:34.400]  And of the 19 people that were heading up this investigation, or whatever you want to
[01:34.400 --> 01:40.720]  call it, with Bob Mueller, they were contributors to the Democrat Party, most of them, into
[01:40.720 --> 01:42.520]  Hillary Clinton.
[01:42.520 --> 01:44.360]  They hated President Trump.
[01:44.360 --> 01:47.120]  They hated him with a passion.
[01:47.120 --> 01:52.560]  They went to her big party after the election that turned out to be a wake, not a party.
[01:52.560 --> 01:53.560]  It was a wake.
[01:53.560 --> 01:55.640]  And they were very angry.
[01:55.640 --> 02:04.480]  These are the people that after two years and $40 million or $35 million, it will end
[02:04.480 --> 02:09.160]  up being a lot more than that by the time all the bills are paid.
[02:09.160 --> 02:11.960]  This is what happened.
[02:11.960 --> 02:16.560]  No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing.
[02:16.560 --> 02:25.360]  They issued 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers.
[02:25.360 --> 02:28.560]  Think of that, though, 500 witnesses.
[02:28.560 --> 02:36.200]  And then I have Nancy Pelosi go out and say that the President of the United States engaged
[02:36.200 --> 02:37.200]  in a cover-up.
[02:37.200 --> 02:40.880]  Now, we've had a house investigation.
[02:40.880 --> 02:43.340]  We have Senate investigations.
[02:43.340 --> 02:47.520]  We have investigations like nobody's ever had before, and there's nothing.
[02:47.520 --> 02:49.120]  We did nothing wrong.
[02:49.120 --> 02:53.000]  They would have loved to have said we colluded.
[02:53.000 --> 02:54.000]  They would have loved it.
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  These people were out to get us, the Republican Party and President Trump.
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.080]  They were out to get us.
[03:02.080 --> 03:05.880]  This was a one-sided horrible thing.
[03:05.880 --> 03:10.780]  The bottom line is they said there's no collusion, no collusion with Russia.
[03:10.780 --> 03:18.240]  You heard so much talk about phone calls that my son made to me from this meeting that was
[03:18.240 --> 03:24.240]  set up by GPS Fusion, it looks like, which is the other side for those that don't know.
[03:24.240 --> 03:30.640]  And for a year, I heard about phone calls, went to a special number unauthorized, and
[03:30.640 --> 03:38.760]  it would have been my son, Don, who's a good young man who's gone through hell.
[03:38.760 --> 03:43.320]  And they were calls that must have been made by him before and after the meeting, three
[03:43.320 --> 03:49.600]  calls after massive study at work.
[03:49.600 --> 03:52.720]  They actually found who made the calls.
[03:52.720 --> 03:59.240]  One was a friend of ours, a real estate developer, great guy, most of you know him, nice guy,
[03:59.240 --> 04:01.240]  loves our country.
[04:01.240 --> 04:05.160]  And the other one was the head of NASCAR, two of them.
[04:05.160 --> 04:10.840]  So the three calls that were so horrible that he had a meeting and he called me and then
[04:10.840 --> 04:16.800]  he had the meeting after, and he made two more calls.
[04:16.800 --> 04:21.840]  And they were written about like this little, little lines, couple of lines, nobody wanted
[04:21.840 --> 04:23.760]  to admit it.
[04:23.760 --> 04:27.640]  Even last night, we had a great election.
[04:27.640 --> 04:29.720]  I went there on Monday.
[04:29.720 --> 04:39.400]  We had an election for Fred Keller, it was a 50-50 shot, and he won in a landslide.
[04:39.400 --> 04:45.840]  He went and we did a rally, hardly mentioned today, and yet if he lost, it would have been
[04:45.840 --> 04:49.480]  the biggest story in the country, even bigger than this witch hunt.
[04:49.480 --> 04:56.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, strap yourselves in for this Thursday, May 23, 2019 transmission.
[04:56.520 --> 05:00.280]  It's going to be one hell of a broadcast.

[05:06.000 --> 05:07.000]  the run.
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with

[06:14.960 --> 06:32.320]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, and the heart of the Resistance,
[06:32.320 --> 06:33.320]  it's Alex Jones.
[06:33.320 --> 06:37.640]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[06:37.640 --> 06:44.080]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an
[06:44.080 --> 06:52.080]  orbit which freezes his life support systems, and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[06:52.080 --> 06:58.640]  Transdimensionally, over the space time continuum, where people are extremely lazy, the social
[06:58.640 --> 07:00.440]  engineers are there laughing.
[07:00.440 --> 07:05.200]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now real.
[07:05.200 --> 07:09.800]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men,
[07:09.800 --> 07:13.440]  and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand
[07:13.440 --> 07:18.440]  that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's
[07:18.440 --> 07:24.440]  fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[07:24.440 --> 07:27.440]  I'm picking up a big transmission right now.
[07:27.440 --> 07:31.440]  I think it's Alex Jones coming back.
[07:31.440 --> 07:32.440]  On screen.
[07:32.440 --> 07:36.440]  But here's the good news, chumps.
[07:36.440 --> 07:39.440]  You think you're gonna assassinate Trump?
[07:39.440 --> 07:45.440]  Shut down the Internet and bully a bunch of us and go along with you.
[07:45.440 --> 07:46.440]  How do I preserve power?
[07:46.440 --> 07:47.440]  Now.
[07:47.440 --> 07:49.440]  You want to be willing to fight?
[07:49.440 --> 07:50.440]  One point at this point.
[07:50.440 --> 07:55.440]  And only the dumbest morons buy into your SJW Globalist George Soros droppings.
[07:55.440 --> 07:56.440]  Stabilize.
[07:56.440 --> 08:01.440]  So George Soros, Hillary Clinton, and the New World Order, and Michael Moore, go back to
[08:01.440 --> 08:03.440]  where you came from.
[08:03.440 --> 08:07.440]  We're awake, and you're not putting us back in the coma.
[08:07.440 --> 08:09.440]  You got that, Jack?
[08:09.440 --> 08:10.440]  You're done.
[08:10.440 --> 08:11.440]  It's over.
[08:11.440 --> 08:12.440]  What what?
[08:12.440 --> 08:13.440]  Get him back.
[08:13.440 --> 08:14.440]  Get him back.
[08:14.440 --> 08:29.440]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[08:29.440 --> 08:34.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live global broadcast,
[08:34.440 --> 08:38.440]  on the 23rd, 2019, on this Thursday.
[08:38.440 --> 08:39.440]  Wow.
[08:39.440 --> 08:41.440]  I say it almost every day now.
[08:41.440 --> 08:42.440]  It's true.
[08:42.440 --> 08:43.440]  Just every day gets crazier.
[08:43.440 --> 08:45.440]  The news gets more insane.
[08:45.440 --> 08:50.440]  The global social engineers and their minions are now admitting that they hate children,
[08:50.440 --> 08:55.440]  hate mothers, hate families, hate God, hate civilization.
[08:55.440 --> 08:59.440]  They're extremely suicidal and nihilistic, but they want to take us with them.
[08:59.440 --> 09:05.440]  I mean, that's what globalism is, is a post-industrial, post-human world.
[09:05.440 --> 09:09.440]  But they really mean to carry it out.
[09:09.440 --> 09:16.440]  But humanity is really awakening right now and striking back in so many ways.
[09:16.440 --> 09:29.680]  The tyranny of the EU is facing virtual annihilation politically with the six-week-old, he started
[09:29.680 --> 09:37.720]  talking about forming it a year ago, but six-week-old Brexit campaign, and it's been picked up and
[09:37.720 --> 09:46.200]  it's been adopted all across Europe as a symbol of rebellion against EU tyranny.
[09:46.200 --> 09:50.200]  And how does Junker, the unelected head of the EU, respond?
[09:50.200 --> 09:55.000]  We'll play the clip here in just a moment.
[09:55.000 --> 10:04.720]  Junker lashes out at stupid nationalists on eve of European elections.
[10:04.720 --> 10:05.720]  Think about the arrogance.
[10:05.720 --> 10:07.280]  That's an actual quote.
[10:07.280 --> 10:16.480]  Think about the arrogance of Mayor de Blasio making similar statements or AOC making similar
[10:16.480 --> 10:26.320]  statements or people like Governor Cuomo making similar statements or Mayor Kahn making statements
[10:26.320 --> 10:28.080]  about England.
[10:28.080 --> 10:34.920]  How do you have leaders in your own countries that say you suck because they're usurpers?
[10:34.920 --> 10:44.080]  He told CNN that he lashed out at stupid nationalists, close quote, on the eve of the European elections.
[10:44.080 --> 10:45.600]  And he went further.
[10:45.600 --> 10:49.040]  He said they love their countries.
[10:49.040 --> 10:55.280]  Well, what else is going to stand up for you but heritage and rule of law invested in
[10:55.280 --> 10:57.160]  Western culture that's being erased?
[10:57.160 --> 11:04.800]  And then I think about the headlines where you see the New York Times, The Washington
[11:04.800 --> 11:10.600]  Post, BBC saying, if you don't like the European Union, you're a Nazi.
[11:10.600 --> 11:13.800]  Or if you claim there's a global government, you're a Nazi.
[11:13.800 --> 11:21.040]  When Junker is the heir of the richest royal family of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, his
[11:21.040 --> 11:28.320]  grandfather took by force Luxembourg that he owns per square mile, the richest country
[11:28.320 --> 11:30.080]  in the world.
[11:30.080 --> 11:33.000]  He is a literal super king.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.600]  He sits on the unelected EU bureaucracy.
[11:36.600 --> 11:44.640]  They have a ceremonial parliament that is embarrassing them because the whole parliament
[11:44.640 --> 11:48.960]  is basically converting to anti-EU nationalist movements.
[11:48.960 --> 11:53.960]  So his answer is we'll just abolish the parliament and put an EU army in every country.
[11:53.960 --> 11:54.960]  You're not leaving.
[11:54.960 --> 11:58.120]  And you think that's crazy.
[11:58.120 --> 12:01.160]  He'll never get away with it.
[12:01.160 --> 12:07.360]  His grandfather was the second most powerful person in Germany.
[12:07.360 --> 12:12.520]  His father was in the SS.
[12:12.520 --> 12:16.840]  He owns Europe still, to a great extent.
[12:16.840 --> 12:23.160]  He only executed a few Nazis for show at the end of World War II, brought most of them
[12:23.160 --> 12:26.080]  over here, 36,000, the rat line.
[12:26.080 --> 12:32.960]  And the richness of this, the stench of this is ridiculous.
[12:32.960 --> 12:35.360]  It's insane.
[12:35.360 --> 12:36.360]  It's over the top.
[12:36.360 --> 12:41.520]  Hitler envisioned the European Union and its flag.
[12:41.520 --> 12:44.480]  Hitler designed the EU flag.
[12:44.480 --> 12:47.080]  Hitler designed the Volkswagen Beetle.
[12:47.080 --> 12:48.760]  Hitler designed the logo.
[12:48.760 --> 12:50.360]  Hitler designed the highways.
[12:50.360 --> 12:53.400]  Hitler developed the plan with Wernher von Braun for NASA.
[12:53.400 --> 12:55.400]  All of it.
[12:55.400 --> 13:05.560]  And they think we're so stupid that a literal Nazi king, king, sits on Europe just as Hitler
[13:05.560 --> 13:11.880]  envisioned Edward VIII, the German king who was in England.
[13:11.880 --> 13:18.840]  Not when the, once the war started, he stepped down as king and the plan didn't go as they
[13:18.840 --> 13:22.680]  had foreseen it because England wasn't supposed to come to the war.
[13:22.680 --> 13:24.880]  That's why never Chamberlain was standing down.
[13:24.880 --> 13:27.720]  And they had treaties and it's all been declassified.
[13:27.720 --> 13:31.440]  But the average person doesn't know mainline history.
[13:31.440 --> 13:34.640]  England was supposed to go with Hitler.
[13:34.640 --> 13:41.720]  They had a peace treaty and they were supposed to put a German king over the European Union.
[13:41.720 --> 13:46.800]  Hitler is a German royal.
[13:46.800 --> 13:50.320]  You cannot make up how ridiculous this is.
[13:50.320 --> 13:57.760]  We have a stinking Nazi telling us we're stupid because we want our countries and don't want
[13:57.760 --> 14:00.560]  to be ruled by him.
[14:00.560 --> 14:03.520]  Here is a clip of a Junker.
[14:03.520 --> 14:05.960]  You heard of the Junker bombers, the Junker factories?
[14:05.960 --> 14:06.960]  Yeah.
[14:06.960 --> 14:13.200]  Junker telling you how to calculate the cabbage, here it is.
[14:13.200 --> 14:20.680]  People are looking at us as if we were a kind of peace guard because we have achieved on
[14:20.680 --> 14:24.240]  this continent what has not been achieved elsewhere.
[14:24.240 --> 14:32.720]  We have 60 wars for the time being, globally spoken, none in Europe, a part Ukraine, which
[14:32.720 --> 14:37.720]  is part of Europe, which is not part of the European Union.
[14:37.720 --> 14:44.480]  These populist nationalists, stupid nationalists, they are in love with their own country and
[14:44.480 --> 14:47.120]  they don't like the others.
[14:47.120 --> 14:54.320]  In some countries of the European Union, the government, the parliament, a major part of
[14:54.320 --> 14:59.240]  the society don't like those coming from far away.
[14:59.240 --> 15:06.120]  I do like those coming from far away because the main guiding principle of the European
[15:06.120 --> 15:07.720]  Union should be solidarity.
[15:07.720 --> 15:08.720]  We have to act.
[15:08.720 --> 15:10.440]  Okay, let's stop there.
[15:10.440 --> 15:11.440]  Let's translate that.
[15:11.440 --> 15:12.440]  It's pretty clear.
[15:12.440 --> 15:15.720]  We're going to bring in a bunch of foreigners that we totally control to outvote you and
[15:15.720 --> 15:21.720]  dominate you and because the European Union and global government is going to stop war.
[15:21.720 --> 15:25.600]  That's like Emperor Palpatine in Star Wars Episode 4 saying once we've taken over and
[15:25.600 --> 15:29.520]  killed everybody, they'll be peace, so it's a very, very sick world viewer.
[15:29.520 --> 15:34.280]  The end of Game of Thrones, she's going to kill all the other leaders and take over so
[15:34.280 --> 15:35.280]  they'll be peace.
[15:35.280 --> 15:41.040]  I mean, this is classic dictator stuff, megalomaniac stuff, and there it is coming out of Junker's
[15:41.040 --> 15:44.040]  fat, disgusting, pig-like mouth.
[15:44.040 --> 15:48.000]  My God, his father should have been executed.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.960]  His grandfather should have been executed.
[15:49.960 --> 15:52.720]  Junker should be thrown in chains.
[15:52.720 --> 15:54.160]  These are criminal Nazis.
[15:54.160 --> 15:56.160]  The real thing, the real thing.
[15:56.160 --> 15:57.160]  We'll be right back.
[15:57.160 --> 15:58.160]  Stay with us.
[15:58.160 --> 16:01.600]  Okay, so a watch is good and some jewelry.
[16:01.600 --> 16:02.600]  Better grab some flowers, too.

[17:28.680 --> 17:34.040]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:34.040 --> 17:35.040]  the world.
[17:35.040 --> 17:38.080]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:38.080 --> 17:44.040]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:44.040 --> 17:47.800]  In the former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire.
[17:47.800 --> 17:48.800]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:48.800 --> 17:50.360]  Who do we fight for?
[17:50.360 --> 17:56.920]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire, by James Dunne, available
[17:56.920 --> 18:00.880]  at Amazon Books.
[18:00.880 --> 18:06.160]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[18:06.160 --> 18:11.440]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[18:11.440 --> 18:18.160]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:18.160 --> 18:24.040]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:24.040 --> 18:27.360]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:27.360 --> 18:32.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[18:32.000 --> 18:37.320]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:37.320 --> 18:38.320]  symptoms.
[18:38.320 --> 18:42.200]  If pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:42.200 --> 18:46.920]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.920 --> 18:52.720]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.720 --> 18:55.400]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:55.400 --> 19:02.480]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[19:02.480 --> 19:07.240]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[19:58.200 --> 20:05.200]  supplement routine.
[20:28.200 --> 20:39.400]  Welcome back.
[20:39.400 --> 20:44.280]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. live, then Owen Troyer with the
[20:44.280 --> 20:45.280]  War Room.
[20:45.280 --> 20:46.780]  They have a nightly day mornings at 8 a.m.
[20:46.780 --> 20:53.040]  I'll be back Sunday, of course, 4 to 6 p.m. as we are always doing a live show.
[20:53.040 --> 20:59.440]  By then, the elections would have all closed, the polls open in many European countries
[20:59.440 --> 21:10.560]  today, and they will then roll on out from there right through until Sunday.
[21:10.560 --> 21:13.320]  And so we will then have the results for you.
[21:13.320 --> 21:17.160]  The EU, of course, has been caught engaging in a lot of election fraud.
[21:17.160 --> 21:22.000]  They've been caught bringing in millions of foreigners and then allowing them to vote
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.120]  in an attempt to break the back of Europe's sovereignty and culture.
[21:27.120 --> 21:31.360]  The globalists don't want there to be any culture or any system that can stand alone.
[21:31.360 --> 21:36.320]  They want the globalist, anti-human culture of death.
[21:36.320 --> 21:43.560]  And many experts are believing that this is going to signal virtual annihilation, not
[21:43.560 --> 21:49.200]  just for the European Union, but for Theresa May and others.
[21:49.200 --> 21:57.080]  PM May facing annihilation by Nigel Farage's Brexit Party in EU elections.
[21:57.080 --> 22:01.680]  A lot of people say, oh, you voted two and a half years ago, three years ago, to pull
[22:01.680 --> 22:09.560]  out of the unelected European Union that just tricked the UK and others into so-called trade
[22:09.560 --> 22:12.880]  deals that were really global government deals.
[22:12.880 --> 22:14.480]  And so, oh, look, you're pathetic.
[22:14.480 --> 22:16.640]  In three years, you can't get out of it.
[22:16.640 --> 22:19.160]  That's only pissed people off more.
[22:19.160 --> 22:23.680]  That's only made more people wake up in Europe to the EU and how authoritarian it is and
[22:23.680 --> 22:27.280]  how it's trying to destroy the cultures and how it's trying to create a permanent welfare
[22:27.280 --> 22:28.280]  state.
[22:28.280 --> 22:33.400]  And so the people are now rebelling in a giant way.
[22:33.400 --> 22:36.240]  And the system is reeling.
[22:36.240 --> 22:37.880]  It's sounding the alarm.
[22:37.880 --> 22:44.040]  It's calling for banning any form of nationalism, any form of Christianity now.
[22:44.040 --> 22:48.560]  The socialists, the globalists, the technocrats, the big tech heads, the big bank heads are
[22:48.560 --> 22:53.280]  now saying, listen, the only way to win and beat these people is just in the free press
[22:53.280 --> 23:00.480]  and bring in total authoritarianism and bring in a European Union arming that will rule
[23:00.480 --> 23:03.800]  over everyone.
[23:03.800 --> 23:06.600]  And that is the plan.
[23:06.600 --> 23:09.240]  That is the operation.
[23:09.240 --> 23:25.360]  And this cannot be undercalculated how big and how important this is and how this is
[23:25.360 --> 23:31.840]  another giant nail in the globalist coffin for their larger operations.
[23:31.840 --> 23:37.880]  But I'm going to wait till next segment to cover this because you have to come in with
[23:37.880 --> 23:41.040]  a bail-off for something that's important.
[23:41.040 --> 23:45.520]  We have to have war drums to announce something that's positive.
[23:45.520 --> 23:49.200]  I have to have the right music when I come into these segments.
[23:49.200 --> 23:52.520]  Or I just can't do the show anymore, actually.
[23:52.520 --> 23:57.040]  It's just a neuroses I have now, being sarcastic, folks, that'll be a new headline across the
[23:57.040 --> 23:58.040]  country.
[23:58.040 --> 24:02.720]  But no, no, seriously, more and more I realize that I can't just come on air and just start
[24:02.720 --> 24:06.360]  spewing these truth bombs and hardcore info.
[24:06.360 --> 24:22.720]  I need to build this up because what's historically happening is so earth-shattering that I just
[24:22.720 --> 24:26.720]  don't even know what to say.
[24:26.720 --> 24:28.800]  It's beautiful.
[24:28.800 --> 24:33.880]  And if you look at what's happening across the world, all the globalists are doing is
[24:33.880 --> 24:39.080]  losing.
[24:39.080 --> 24:41.640]  All the globalists are doing is failing.
[24:41.640 --> 24:46.400]  Oh, they're throwing temper tantrums and they're killing people and they're flooding borders
[24:46.400 --> 24:52.040]  with disease and they're trying to turn the chessboard over, but they are losing in the
[24:52.040 --> 24:57.320]  final equation in a huge way.
[24:57.320 --> 25:02.360]  And we should talk about the chronicle of what's happened the last few years and what
[25:02.360 --> 25:06.160]  I think is coming next and open the phones up and get your take on what you think is
[25:06.160 --> 25:08.240]  coming next.
[25:08.240 --> 25:12.920]  We have always informative Robert Barnes, lawyer, constitutional lawyer, joining us
[25:12.920 --> 25:15.560]  to cover a whole host of big news developments.
[25:15.560 --> 25:17.720]  And then Millie Weaver is here in town, one of our great reporters.
[25:17.720 --> 25:23.080]  She's also going to be in studio with us for part of the third hour today.
[25:23.080 --> 25:29.280]  And then out from that, we have Matt Bracken in the fourth hour, always very important
[25:29.280 --> 25:30.640]  information that he covers.
[25:30.640 --> 25:41.360]  But when we come back, I'm really going to do my best to give you not a pep talk, not
[25:41.360 --> 25:45.240]  what I want you to hear, but what I really think is going on and what I know is going
[25:45.240 --> 25:46.520]  on.
[25:46.520 --> 25:47.520]  And I respect the listeners.
[25:47.520 --> 25:49.240]  I respect all of our guests.
[25:49.240 --> 25:52.960]  I respect my crew and the work they do.
[25:52.960 --> 26:00.200]  And I really try to tell you how I think things are really going and I think I've done a pretty
[26:00.200 --> 26:01.760]  good job so far of being accurate.
[26:01.760 --> 26:06.200]  So I'm going to tell you the positives and I'm going to tell you the negatives.
[26:06.200 --> 26:12.000]  And then I want to get your take on the type of curveballs the globalist could throw at
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.520]  us.
[26:13.520 --> 26:19.800]  That said, if the globalists are able to take out our leadership around the world, the
[26:19.800 --> 26:26.920]  nationalist populist leadership in media, in academia, in government, and in finance,
[26:26.920 --> 26:33.960]  and in spirituality, Christianity, they will be successful.
[26:33.960 --> 26:37.000]  It's the only shot they've got.
[26:37.000 --> 26:43.840]  And as each day goes by, more blood runs out of them, the more behind they are, the more
[26:43.840 --> 26:47.440]  hopeless their case becomes.
[26:47.440 --> 26:51.520]  But they could sabotage things and bring the whole system down because they can't beat
[26:51.520 --> 26:56.120]  us, which has been their long term plan anyways, with the clowered and pivot type strategies
[26:56.120 --> 26:59.760]  and strategies and gambits.
[26:59.760 --> 27:04.840]  So we're going to look at all of it here today, but this is the most critical information.
[27:04.840 --> 27:11.400]  This EU election, even though the parliament is ceremonial to the dictatorship, is a complete
[27:11.400 --> 27:13.680]  referendum on them.
[27:13.680 --> 27:19.200]  And remember, parliamentary elections go where it's nearly impossible to ever have one group
[27:19.200 --> 27:31.800]  completely sweep 50%, but a 45% that's chronicled and projected and forecast for Brexit is at
[27:31.800 --> 27:32.800]  45%.
[27:32.800 --> 27:35.400]  That is ultra-devastating.
[27:35.400 --> 27:39.640]  Then there's five or six other nationalist populist parties that are set to get around
[27:39.640 --> 27:41.680]  15% to 20%.
[27:41.680 --> 27:49.840]  They're talking upwards of 60 plus percent sliding into populism, nationalism, what makes
[27:49.840 --> 27:58.480]  us great, what creates real diversity, what creates firewalls between tyrannies that try
[27:58.480 --> 28:01.880]  to spread, checks and balances.
[28:01.880 --> 28:08.080]  So this is a big, big, big, big deal, and the globalists are already running around
[28:08.080 --> 28:13.640]  chickens with their heads cut off freaking out, but they are going to go into insane
[28:13.640 --> 28:17.080]  mode, I believe, when this happens.
[28:17.080 --> 28:22.720]  And so everybody better strap themselves in because we are not in Kansas anymore, as
[28:22.720 --> 28:24.080]  I like to say.
[28:24.080 --> 28:26.360]  We are not in Kansas anymore.
[28:26.360 --> 28:30.600]  And hey, global government tried to take down the world, sell us out to the chai comms,
[28:30.600 --> 28:33.920]  break up our families, and they've wounded the hell out of us.
[28:33.920 --> 28:34.920]  We're hurt.
[28:34.920 --> 28:38.840]  We've been path poisoned and culturally and spiritually and physically, but we're coming
[28:38.840 --> 28:44.560]  back and once you know you've been poisoned and once you know who did it, we can get our
[28:44.560 --> 28:48.000]  hands metaphysically around their throats.
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.960]  And we have got our hands around the throats now.
[28:49.960 --> 28:56.840]  So let's just sprint to the finish and squeeze, squeeze, squeeze lovingly, politically until
[28:56.840 --> 28:59.240]  the enemy's heart stops.
[28:59.240 --> 29:03.800]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[29:03.800 --> 29:05.720]  They don't know me and will never meet.
[29:05.720 --> 29:07.440]  I had a problem like you once.
[29:07.440 --> 29:12.880]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[29:12.880 --> 29:14.000]  my life.
[29:14.000 --> 29:19.240]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[29:19.240 --> 29:24.440]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[29:24.440 --> 29:27.600]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[29:27.600 --> 29:32.280]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits

[31:04.840 --> 31:05.840]  incredible.
[31:05.840 --> 31:09.040]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world and the globalists are
[31:09.040 --> 31:10.440]  so upset.
[31:10.440 --> 31:14.560]  The problem is people forget to take them.

[32:00.480 --> 32:01.480]  we're defeating the leftist tyrant.
[32:01.480 --> 32:02.480]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said we used to love you on air
[32:02.480 --> 32:03.480]  and it was so good to see you on, you know, the iTunes or on YouTube.
[32:03.480 --> 32:04.480]  Are you coming back?
[32:04.480 --> 32:21.360]  We're at infowarstore.com, we're at newswarstore.com, Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news,
[32:21.360 --> 32:25.040]  we have our own videos, we have our own articles, they're trying to destroy us, but thanks to
[32:25.040 --> 32:29.040]  you and others having us on, infowarstore is still chatting along, so we're there folks,
[32:29.040 --> 32:41.200]  I'm Paul Watts and I'll see you tomorrow's news, today, infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com.
[32:41.200 --> 32:46.240]  I'm at infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com, we knew this censorship is coming forever,
[32:46.240 --> 32:50.040]  we have our own video streams, our own audio streams and it's all free to air, anybody
[32:50.040 --> 32:52.600]  can use it, reupload it, do whatever you want.
[32:52.600 --> 32:56.160]  People go to infowarstore.com and newswarstore.com, that's where they find it, you know, there's
[32:56.160 --> 33:03.480]  what they go to websites, they just go there.
[33:03.480 --> 33:19.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, and it's time for humanity to stand up in the
[33:19.440 --> 33:29.960]  info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want
[33:29.960 --> 33:30.960]  to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[33:30.960 --> 33:59.440]  It's Alex Jones.
[33:59.440 --> 34:00.440]  This is it.
[34:00.440 --> 34:07.240]  This isn't a Netflix show, it's not Dungeons and Dragons, it's not Mario Brothers, it's
[34:07.240 --> 34:16.600]  not Donkey Kong, it's not LARPing in the park, this is it, powerful forces, technocrats want
[34:16.600 --> 34:21.960]  complete control over every facet of your life, they want to track and trace and monitor
[34:21.960 --> 34:30.040]  your every movement, not to empower you, but to game the system to build a post human world
[34:30.040 --> 34:32.800]  in their own words.
[34:32.800 --> 34:35.160]  Thank you again for joining us.
[34:35.160 --> 34:45.280]  The numbers are in, anti-EU pro-capitalist, pro-sovereignty parties are set to sweep
[34:45.280 --> 34:55.160]  60 plus percent of the parliamentary elections that are about to happen.
[34:55.160 --> 35:02.720]  These elections are staggered, just like our senatorial elections are, and so for there
[35:02.720 --> 35:10.440]  to be a slide of that number is unprecedented and is going to be a devastating referendum
[35:10.440 --> 35:19.760]  against the unelected EU tyranny that is the literal brainchild of Adolf Hitler that just
[35:19.760 --> 35:26.200]  adds to the bizarreness when you criticize the EU, they say you're a Nazi, when the air
[35:26.200 --> 35:34.360]  to the Nazi Empire sits upon the unelected EU, Junker.
[35:34.360 --> 35:43.840]  Yes, you cannot make this stuff up, that's why they say truth is stranger than fiction.
[35:43.840 --> 35:51.400]  Now everyone seems to be focused on the UK because it's trying to pull out with Brexit,
[35:51.400 --> 35:55.440]  but notice how they're not giving England the exit it wanted three years ago, has created
[35:55.440 --> 36:03.400]  a Brexit party that's set to win 40 plus percent of the seats and then it'll be UKIP and other
[36:03.400 --> 36:09.560]  nationalist parties that win the others in European elections that are happening today,
[36:09.560 --> 36:15.040]  tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday, depending on the country.
[36:15.040 --> 36:17.840]  They're happening today in the UK.
[36:17.840 --> 36:22.240]  We're going to be here live tonight, live tomorrow night, we're going to be here this
[36:22.240 --> 36:28.920]  weekend and we're going to do extended coverage during Sunday, right up through the 4-6 PM
[36:28.920 --> 36:34.040]  regularly scheduled Sunday update that I've been doing for 12 years, doing the syndicated
[36:34.040 --> 36:40.640]  show for 20 plus, the weekday show, but 11-12 years now because so much news breaks on the
[36:40.640 --> 36:47.440]  weekend, we're going to be here and this election is just as important as Trump's election.
[36:47.440 --> 36:53.280]  It was the nationalist movement, the patriot movement that got its embryonic start here,
[36:53.280 --> 36:57.320]  Nigel Farage has said that, and the early days of UKIP, he's been coming on the show
[36:57.320 --> 37:04.240]  for almost 20 years, half their support when he'd knock on doors in England was from InfoWars.
[37:04.240 --> 37:07.920]  They had no media coverage, nothing, InfoWars was their coverage.
[37:07.920 --> 37:13.360]  InfoWars was in the top 50 websites back then in England, it's in the top couple hundred
[37:13.360 --> 37:18.400]  right now because they had no independent press, I'm not bragging, it's the fact that
[37:18.400 --> 37:24.440]  we were there, there was something there and they heard Paul Watson on the show and they
[37:24.440 --> 37:29.240]  heard all the other great folks from Ireland and Scotland that we had on and of course
[37:29.240 --> 37:36.960]  now we have EuropeWars.com and Paul has Summit.News, but that shows why Hillary came after us, that
[37:36.960 --> 37:41.440]  shows why they're trying to censor us everywhere, that's why they're calling us hate figures
[37:41.440 --> 37:55.680]  is because the genesis, the genesis of the movements we see today from Brazil to Nigeria
[37:55.680 --> 38:06.360]  to Japan to Greece to Italy to Spain to the UK to everywhere is incredible.
[38:06.360 --> 38:13.120]  Now the German Chancellor is a lame duck, her party is out of power, but the way the German
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.720]  parliamentary system works, she'll still be in office for another year and a few months
[38:17.720 --> 38:23.560]  and again it's happening everywhere, by Chronicle it'll take the whole show, but they are getting
[38:23.560 --> 38:26.840]  their asses handed to them.
[38:26.840 --> 38:32.400]  Now it's not fun if you're at Donald Trump, it's not fun if you're in Alex Jones to have
[38:32.400 --> 38:37.720]  the lawsuits and the audits and the harassment and the demonization and they had your family
[38:37.720 --> 38:43.680]  harassed and I'm not a victim, I'm a target, I'm an overcomer thanks to your support and
[38:43.680 --> 38:50.040]  God's support and so are you, but it is important to point out how criminal these people are,
[38:50.040 --> 38:57.480]  how the IRS persecuted more than 50,000 conservatives under Obama and admittedly did it for political
[38:57.480 --> 38:58.480]  purposes.
[38:58.480 --> 39:03.360]  They harassed law enforcement organizations, fraternal groups, veterans groups, pro-gun
[39:03.360 --> 39:09.720]  groups, pro-nationalist groups, pro-Christian groups, anti-abortion groups were audited,
[39:09.720 --> 39:21.720]  were harassed, were set up, were put in jail and now in 2019 Hillary Clinton's law firm
[39:21.720 --> 39:29.280]  Wilmer Hale that she runs is savagely attacking me on every front, but we're still here strong
[39:29.280 --> 39:32.760]  because of your support, they don't even know what to do.
[39:32.760 --> 39:38.920]  But with this fight comes a great cost and if you look at all the strategies of the enemy,
[39:38.920 --> 39:44.120]  it's to attack the family, demoralize the nation, break down the nation, flood the nation
[39:44.120 --> 39:52.360]  with foreigners, attack our power source God so that we get God out of our lives, Jesus
[39:52.360 --> 39:59.160]  Christ and attack fathers and mothers and attack leaders.
[39:59.160 --> 40:06.720]  So I want to explain something here, an exhausted part of me at a subconscious level sometimes
[40:06.720 --> 40:11.240]  wants to be taken out of the game and wants to get, you know, my leg broken politically
[40:11.240 --> 40:17.040]  so I can at least rest, but my spirit wants to keep going and fighting even harder.
[40:17.040 --> 40:25.280]  My flesh does not enjoy this, but at my spirit begs God to keep me in this fight and my spirit
[40:25.280 --> 40:31.800]  begs you to keep me in the game because we need to be here working hard, a platform for
[40:31.800 --> 40:36.200]  others that are de-platformed, we need to be a platform to get the truth out during crises
[40:36.200 --> 40:39.360]  that are coming, during false flags, during major events.
[40:39.360 --> 40:47.320]  I know in full wars is now more critical than it's ever been, but I have to tell you without
[40:47.320 --> 40:57.800]  you fervently and religiously and compulsively in a committed habituated way in a habit spreading
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.560]  the word about info wars.com and news wars.com and about how we're verboten and how people
[41:02.560 --> 41:07.360]  should find out for themselves using the Streisand effect against the enemy and without you buying
[41:07.360 --> 41:14.520]  the products and without you supporting local stations, we will not be on the air in a year.
[41:14.520 --> 41:18.440]  Can you imagine a world like that?
[41:18.440 --> 41:21.560]  No ladies and gentlemen, I certainly can't.
[41:21.560 --> 41:23.600]  So we need your support now more than ever.
[41:23.600 --> 41:29.640]  I need everybody listening to go to m4warstore.com and sign up for auto ship, get our toothpaste
[41:29.640 --> 41:34.800]  with the colloidal silver and iodine fortified fluoride free, it's concentrated, no fillers,
[41:34.800 --> 41:35.880]  it's amazing.
[41:35.880 --> 41:40.840]  Get our wake up America coffee, sign up for auto ship, the additional 10% off, next time
[41:40.840 --> 41:44.600]  you order, it just puts it on auto ship in canceling time for free.
[41:44.600 --> 41:51.560]  That way you don't forget to support because I'm the very same way myself.
[41:51.560 --> 41:57.280]  I tend to get the charities every year, just a few charities and I tend to forget so I
[41:57.280 --> 42:02.840]  put it in my Google calendar so that I remember every November to give a donation in December.
[42:02.840 --> 42:04.440]  Well, it's the same thing.
[42:04.440 --> 42:05.520]  Get the coffee.
[42:05.520 --> 42:10.320]  Get the turmeric, get the bone broth formula, get the fish oil, get the vitamin mineral
[42:10.320 --> 42:13.120]  fusion fruit punch, great for adults, great for kids.
[42:13.120 --> 42:14.120]  All of this is win-win.
[42:14.120 --> 42:17.680]  These are things that are good for you and your family that then fund an operation that
[42:17.680 --> 42:24.360]  is fire breathing when it comes to not backing down and wanting to be put in the fight, wanting
[42:24.360 --> 42:27.440]  to be put in the game, wanting to go forward.
[42:27.440 --> 42:32.480]  But if I spend all my time trying to raise capital and worrying about what I'm doing
[42:32.480 --> 42:36.880]  up here, it takes us off balance and we can't expand in the face of the enemy, but we're
[42:36.880 --> 42:42.120]  doing it and believing that God will provide and provision us through you by touching your
[42:42.120 --> 42:45.080]  conscience and your soul to commit and double down.
[42:45.080 --> 42:46.080]  I salute you.
[42:46.080 --> 42:50.200]  I thank you for your previous support, but I tell you now, you can see the results.
[42:50.200 --> 42:54.360]  We're beginning to really win, but the enemy is targeting the Liberty leadership and I
[42:54.360 --> 42:59.320]  am the second most targeted person in the world.
[42:59.320 --> 43:03.400]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't
[43:03.400 --> 43:04.520]  need, you don't want.
[43:04.520 --> 43:11.440]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major
[43:11.440 --> 43:12.440]  city.
[43:12.440 --> 43:16.080]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth, our major cities.
[43:16.080 --> 43:17.840]  How can I solve that problem?
[43:17.840 --> 43:22.840]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now
[43:22.840 --> 43:31.600]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[43:31.600 --> 43:34.520]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[43:34.520 --> 43:38.040]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[43:38.040 --> 43:42.280]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[43:42.280 --> 43:44.240]  I've got two in my home.
[43:44.240 --> 43:49.400]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your
[43:49.400 --> 43:55.040]  house, don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[43:55.040 --> 43:56.040]  Have clean air.
[43:56.040 --> 43:59.400]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[43:59.400 --> 44:06.080]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known
[44:06.080 --> 44:11.400]  positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[44:11.400 --> 44:16.600]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things it's associated
[44:16.600 --> 44:19.600]  with, and then it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[44:19.600 --> 44:23.280]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if
[44:23.280 --> 44:24.280]  they were sick.
[44:24.280 --> 44:28.160]  But then you add, not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest
[44:28.160 --> 44:33.320]  quality bone broth out there, literally, then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have
[44:33.320 --> 44:37.480]  the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that
[44:37.480 --> 44:42.520]  are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[44:42.520 --> 44:44.760]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[44:44.760 --> 44:48.840]  It's 50% off right now at Infowarsstore.com because I want you to try it and see how great
[44:48.840 --> 44:49.840]  it is.
[44:49.840 --> 44:52.480]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[44:52.480 --> 44:57.080]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taken on the globalists
[44:57.080 --> 45:05.440]  and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[45:05.440 --> 45:09.280]  The real Red Pill Plus, ladies and gentlemen, our team is constantly on the lookout for

[46:00.680 --> 46:07.400]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and
[46:07.400 --> 46:11.520]  backed up with human waste and debris.
[46:11.520 --> 46:17.200]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine
[46:17.200 --> 46:23.640]  products and safe sex products, and so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and
[46:23.640 --> 46:24.640]  clogged.
[46:24.640 --> 46:29.800]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged, the human body

[47:03.040 --> 47:27.320]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:27.320 --> 47:45.560]  Did you ever think just five years ago that every globalist candidate in the world would
[47:45.560 --> 47:51.080]  be being thrown out of office, that the Pope would be fighting back by calling for world
[47:51.080 --> 48:00.520]  government to force planetary carbon taxes, that you would see the globalist unelected
[48:00.520 --> 48:08.840]  EU in its own parliament elections facing 60 plus percent of their minions being swept
[48:08.840 --> 48:16.560]  from office in a single election that runs for the next three days and starts today.
[48:16.560 --> 48:24.440]  What an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen, but the establishment is going
[48:24.440 --> 48:30.040]  to then make its move against free speech.
[48:30.040 --> 48:39.800]  And then once they've silenced you, they can then lie about you and that is their plan.
[48:39.800 --> 48:42.480]  That is their goal.
[48:42.480 --> 48:45.680]  That is their template.
[48:45.680 --> 48:48.480]  That is their program.
[48:48.480 --> 48:56.360]  But think about the arrogance of Yonker, the unelected head of the EU bureaucracy that
[48:56.360 --> 49:01.080]  took over all these nations and almost none of them even voted to join the EU.
[49:01.080 --> 49:06.720]  They just woke up in these so-called trade deals like NAFTA and GATT and the Trans-Pacific
[49:06.720 --> 49:08.680]  Partnership that Trump got us out of.
[49:08.680 --> 49:14.720]  Well, this was a similar deal, similar model.
[49:14.720 --> 49:20.480]  And he said that people who love their country are, quote, stupid, and he said that nationalists
[49:20.480 --> 49:27.040]  are stupid, and he said we need to bring everyone in and be inclusive, yes, need to bring in
[49:27.040 --> 49:35.000]  uneducated people, the lowest room from Third World, the lowest educated, the highest crime
[49:35.000 --> 49:41.120]  rates from the Third World, so the bottom of the barrel of the Third World.
[49:41.120 --> 49:47.160]  Bring them in and then teach them to hate their country that they now live in and have
[49:47.160 --> 49:49.480]  an SJW chip on their shoulder.
[49:49.480 --> 49:53.880]  This is the program being run all over the world.
[49:53.880 --> 50:00.560]  The establishment knows that if they push racism and can get majority minorities to
[50:00.560 --> 50:05.160]  adopt that, that they won't want freedom.
[50:05.160 --> 50:07.340]  They won't want free market.
[50:07.340 --> 50:11.240]  They won't want things like that.
[50:11.240 --> 50:16.480]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they will just want the racial identity, just like the final
[50:16.480 --> 50:19.080]  episode of Game of Thrones.
[50:19.080 --> 50:20.640]  The writers are telling you how the world really works.
[50:20.640 --> 50:27.480]  They say people don't fight and die or build civilizations and societies for gold.
[50:27.480 --> 50:30.160]  They don't do it for flags.
[50:30.160 --> 50:32.600]  They do it for stories.
[50:32.600 --> 50:35.760]  They do it for an ethos.
[50:35.760 --> 50:41.920]  And so they can remove the ethos of free market and truly open society and fathers and mothers
[50:41.920 --> 50:47.520]  and cultures and people being welded together through a shared belief and freedom and renaissance
[50:47.520 --> 50:53.320]  and the West that was the light in the dark.
[50:53.320 --> 50:56.520]  If they can do that, they've won.
[50:56.520 --> 51:00.040]  And so that's why all the different Democrats and all the different globalists and all the
[51:00.040 --> 51:03.120]  different UN people tell you nation-states are bad.
[51:03.120 --> 51:05.720]  When Trump said it's good to have a nation, it's good to have your own country.
[51:05.720 --> 51:11.240]  It's good to have a people that stand up for themselves and have a shared system of values
[51:11.240 --> 51:14.120]  instead of being ruled by some far-off thing you don't know.
[51:14.120 --> 51:18.640]  That's going back to 1776 and saying no to King George.
[51:18.640 --> 51:23.600]  But the governor of New York and the unelected dictator of the EU, the grandson of the number
[51:23.600 --> 51:34.040]  two Nazi, literally, says that you're stupid and that if you like a nation-state, you're
[51:34.040 --> 51:37.840]  stupid and if you care about your country, you're stupid.
[51:37.840 --> 51:43.040]  See, they have to get around to that at a certain point.
[51:43.040 --> 51:51.240]  So in amongst all the articles they've had the last month saying Alex Jones is a racist,
[51:51.240 --> 51:52.240]  Alex Jones is bad.
[51:52.240 --> 51:55.600]  He says there's a global government that's going to have a carbon tax over everything
[51:55.600 --> 51:57.480]  you do.
[51:57.480 --> 52:01.200]  And the Pope comes out and says I want global governance, global government and a carbon
[52:01.200 --> 52:07.600]  tax over all human activity and humans are bad.
[52:07.600 --> 52:08.600]  And the devil's not real.
[52:08.600 --> 52:13.760]  Isn't that what the devil would tell you?
[52:13.760 --> 52:17.600]  So here's Cuomo before I play Juncker, here it is.
[52:17.600 --> 52:21.640]  We're not going to make America great again, it was never that great.
[52:21.640 --> 52:25.440]  It's here to that.
[52:25.440 --> 52:29.640]  We have not reached greatness.
[52:29.640 --> 52:37.640]  We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.
[52:37.640 --> 52:46.480]  We will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51% of our
[52:46.480 --> 52:49.480]  population is gone.
[52:49.480 --> 52:52.640]  That's all the left does, that's all they teach at colleges is how to have a chip on
[52:52.640 --> 52:53.640]  your shoulder.
[52:53.640 --> 52:58.600]  And how your identity is that you're persecuted, your identity is that people are being mean
[52:58.600 --> 53:04.440]  to you but you're fighting to get into this country so you can then bitch and complain
[53:04.440 --> 53:05.720]  all day.
[53:05.720 --> 53:10.280]  So America is not going to be great, it was never that great.
[53:10.280 --> 53:14.280]  He wants you to be demoralized, he wants your identity to be that you suck so the chai
[53:14.280 --> 53:18.720]  comms and the globalists can come in and run your life because here you've got a real
[53:18.720 --> 53:26.080]  stake in private property, in values and freedom, not there, not in his world system.
[53:26.080 --> 53:33.200]  There's Junker, the literal heir to the most powerful royal family under Hitler to the
[53:33.200 --> 53:40.000]  biggest munitions company owners, bombers, fighters, jet aircraft, they were making jet
[53:40.000 --> 53:49.320]  aircraft in World War II, so was Messerschmitt and space planes and ICBMs they were developing
[53:49.320 --> 53:51.080]  at the end of the war.
[53:51.080 --> 53:56.640]  Here's this guy telling you how much being a European sucks and how you're stupid, here
[53:56.640 --> 53:58.640]  it is.
[53:58.640 --> 54:05.400]  These populist nationalists, stupid nationalists, they are in love with the old country and
[54:05.400 --> 54:08.040]  they don't like the others.
[54:08.040 --> 54:15.200]  In some countries of the European Union, the government, the parliament, a major part of
[54:15.200 --> 54:20.160]  the society don't like those coming from far away.
[54:20.160 --> 54:27.040]  I do like those coming from far away because the main guiding principle of the European
[54:27.040 --> 54:28.640]  Union should be solidarity.
[54:28.640 --> 54:36.600]  We have to act in solidarity with those who are in the worst situation.
[54:36.600 --> 54:41.920]  The parliament, the people don't like open border.
[54:41.920 --> 54:50.360]  Like we said, they don't like it, but I like it, so we do it, yeah?
[54:50.360 --> 54:57.640]  Luxembourg not like my grandfather, take it over, it's mine now, I own it.
[54:57.640 --> 55:02.880]  My grandfather killed lots of people, my father killed lots of people for it.
[55:02.880 --> 55:09.080]  And so I bring in, our principle is I bring in the Muslims, they get stuff free, they
[55:09.080 --> 55:16.560]  burn your car, rape your father, I like it, I like to conquer Europe.
[55:16.560 --> 55:20.800]  My granddaddy tried and now I do it.
[55:20.800 --> 55:29.360]  I'm a liberal, unelected head of EU dictatorship, yeah.
[55:29.360 --> 55:34.720]  You cannot make this level of crap up.
[55:34.720 --> 55:37.720]  By the way, you think I'm joking, just type in, it's AP, Reuters everywhere the last
[55:37.720 --> 55:45.280]  few days, Pope calls for global governance and a world government system to save the
[55:45.280 --> 55:47.000]  earth in the next 12 years.
[55:47.000 --> 55:57.160]  Oh, the AOC, Beto O'Rourke, Cory Booker line, and then now AOC came out and said, oh, I
[55:57.160 --> 55:58.160]  was joking.
[55:58.160 --> 56:03.520]  Oh, they have a poll, though, two-thirds of millennials believe she's right, it's ending
[56:03.520 --> 56:04.520]  in 12 years.
[56:04.520 --> 56:11.240]  But she said, you'd have to be a, you'd have to have the intellect of a sea sponge, where
[56:11.240 --> 56:19.120]  she come up with that, a sea sponge, that doesn't have any central nervous system, wonder who
[56:19.120 --> 56:23.600]  wrote that line for her, to believe she meant the world's really ending in 12 years.
[56:23.600 --> 56:29.840]  Really, Al Gore said in 10 years all the coastal cities will be flooded, in 2003 he then went
[56:29.840 --> 56:33.640]  out and bought mansions right on the beach in two places, and of course sea levels actually
[56:33.640 --> 56:35.480]  stay the same in the next 10 years.
[56:35.480 --> 56:41.240]  So, no lady, you said it, there's the article on newswars.com, get it out to folks, it'll
[56:41.240 --> 56:42.240]  wake them up.
[56:42.240 --> 56:50.840]  Most Democrats believe Cortez's claim, she said that only a sea sponge would believe.
[56:50.840 --> 56:56.520]  The freshman congresswoman also doubled down on the claim in April.
[56:56.520 --> 56:59.960]  So she goes out and gives a speech about not having to work ever again and everything's
[56:59.960 --> 57:01.080]  going to be free.
[57:01.080 --> 57:06.560]  Al rejected, she says, it was a typo, then she said her Twitter was hacked, and then
[57:06.560 --> 57:11.040]  she said, okay, I said it, well then she said the world's going to end in 12 years, then
[57:11.040 --> 57:16.440]  she said I didn't really mean it, and then now she says it was a joke, no lady, you're
[57:16.440 --> 57:23.320]  terrorizing people and no one bought it but your millennial audience, and they're so zombie-like,
[57:23.320 --> 57:30.200]  they're still believing it, even though their Jim Jones leader, Alexandria OC, the original
[57:30.200 --> 57:34.360]  gangster, is now saying she didn't mean it.
[57:34.360 --> 57:37.080]  That's mind control, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:37.080 --> 57:41.720]  Hour number two of the most banned demonized broadcast in the world, straight ahead.
[57:41.720 --> 57:45.480]  However you're listening, tell everyone you know to tune in and break the back of the
[57:45.480 --> 57:49.120]  sensors, save the republic.
[57:49.120 --> 57:54.480]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[57:54.480 --> 57:58.600]  control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[57:58.600 --> 58:03.640]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[58:03.640 --> 58:07.360]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[58:07.360 --> 58:11.880]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[58:11.880 --> 58:14.840]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[58:14.840 --> 58:20.120]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLife.com, I couldn't do it.

[1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:20.520]  U.K. voting, where it is, vast majority about the vote to get out, other elections happening
[1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:23.080]  as well.
[1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:26.920]  Robert Barnes, attorney at law, really smart historian, will be joining us to cover the
[1:00:26.920 --> 1:00:28.840]  waterfront next segment.
[1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:33.960]  Not just cases against us, that'll be a minor footnote, but Abinadi, more indictments, what's
[1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:38.320]  happening with these demonization attacks of Trump, how they're unconstitutional.
[1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:42.400]  But look at the talking points, the new one that Trump's involved in a cover-up.
[1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:46.920]  When you've got a witch hunt going on 40 years into his past, Congress engaged in massive
[1:00:46.920 --> 1:00:52.280]  criminal activity, here's Tucker Carlson reporting.
[1:00:52.280 --> 1:00:58.920]  Well thanks to Nancy Pelosi, the phrase cover-up dominated cable news today, watch.
[1:00:58.920 --> 1:01:03.380]  Nancy Pelosi describes President Trump as being engaged in a cover-up.
[1:01:03.380 --> 1:01:08.720]  One of the things that she said is that the Trump administration is engaged in a cover-up.
[1:01:08.720 --> 1:01:13.280]  She said President Trump is engaged in a cover-up.
[1:01:13.280 --> 1:01:17.760]  Comments Pelosi had made this morning that the President had engaged in a cover-up.
[1:01:17.760 --> 1:01:20.960]  She accused the President of engaging in a cover-up.
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:24.840]  The President complaining to the Speaker of the House that she accused him of a cover-up.
[1:01:24.840 --> 1:01:31.160]  That phrase cover-up from Nancy Pelosi really set him off.
[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:36.600]  Over at MSNBC, one anchor accused the President of a cover-up for refusing to publicize his
[1:01:36.600 --> 1:01:39.520]  private life.
[1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:44.760]  When you talk about, I don't do cover-ups, there's also the fact that he has been refusing
[1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:49.520]  to let his current and former aides testify, refusing to turn over documents that have
[1:01:49.520 --> 1:01:55.560]  been demanded, including the tax returns, also refusing to grant an interview to Robert
[1:01:55.560 --> 1:01:58.560]  Mueller.
[1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:02.640]  Joe Contra watches an awful lot of television, he writes about media for The Hill, and he
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:03.960]  joins us tonight.
[1:02:03.960 --> 1:02:10.600]  Joe, is it my imagination or did once again the Speaker of the House deliver the talking
[1:02:10.600 --> 1:02:15.840]  point that everyone in cable news eagerly took up and repeated?
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:17.720]  I think you're seeing a pattern here, Tucker.
[1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:23.560]  I remember back in January, the term manufactured crisis was used to talk about what was going
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:25.360]  on at the U.S. southern border.
[1:02:25.360 --> 1:02:30.840]  And then you heard over and over, dozens upon dozens of times, and not just from one network,
[1:02:30.840 --> 1:02:35.680]  but different networks, different anchors, or pundits, or guests, using that same exact
[1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:38.960]  term to the word, manufactured crisis.
[1:02:38.960 --> 1:02:42.760]  Now sure enough, as we know, when even the New York Times admits, it's no longer a manufactured
[1:02:42.760 --> 1:02:45.080]  crisis at the border, that's a real thing.
[1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:46.200]  Story for another time.
[1:02:46.200 --> 1:02:49.920]  And then we had the other crisis, which was the constitutional crisis.
[1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:54.200]  And that was two weeks ago, when Bill Barr, after he testified in front of the Senate,
[1:02:54.200 --> 1:02:59.560]  decided not to do so with the House when they changed the rules around as far as staffers
[1:02:59.560 --> 1:03:03.000]  being able to question him, which had never happened in Congress before, and he said,
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  this is going to be a circus, no thanks, I'm not going to show up.
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.520]  So that became a constitutional crisis.
[1:03:07.520 --> 1:03:09.080]  And Pelosi says that as well.
[1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:12.640]  And sure enough, the Media Research Center, and I get they're conservative, but the numbers
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:19.000]  here are usually accurate, they found that between May 8th and May 12th, that on ABC,
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:27.040]  CBS, NBC, CNN, and MSNBC, that that exact term, constitutional crisis, was uttered 386
[1:03:27.040 --> 1:03:28.040]  times.
[1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:32.760]  I'm not very good at that, but I'm pretty sure that's more than 70 times if you average
[1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:34.600]  it out per network.
[1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:38.720]  So yeah, it goes out one mouth, it comes out another mouth.
[1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:43.120]  And now here we are with cover up, and that will be the next new constitutional crisis
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:48.640]  as far as terms that we hear over and over again, as if it's an echo chamber.
[1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:53.880]  Is it, we're entering campaign season, there's a presidential campaign in progress already.
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:57.720]  At some point, these are campaign finance violations.
[1:03:57.720 --> 1:04:03.200]  These are television networks donating to presidential campaigns to a party and not
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:06.880]  declaring it.
[1:04:06.880 --> 1:04:11.080]  That would be very interesting to see that case be made, perhaps, but no, it just seems
[1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:16.440]  to be that people are taking their cues from one party in this business and not the other,
[1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:18.120]  particularly from Pelosi.
[1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:22.640]  And look, I wanted to hear some reporters yell at her the way that Trump is yelled at.
[1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:25.200]  What cover up are you specifically talking about?
[1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:26.880]  Who's involved in this cover up?
[1:04:26.880 --> 1:04:29.480]  Is Bob Mueller involved in this cover up?
[1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:32.880]  Because he's been reluctant to testify to this point.
[1:04:32.880 --> 1:04:37.960]  So is he also part of the cover up that now includes, I believe, Bill Barr, Don McGahn,
[1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:39.880]  Kato Kalin, the White House chef?
[1:04:39.880 --> 1:04:43.840]  I mean, who else is involved in this deep conspiracy of people who otherwise probably
[1:04:43.840 --> 1:04:47.240]  don't like the president that much, but are willing to put their careers on the line to
[1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:48.240]  cover up for him?
[1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:50.120]  It's quite comical on some level, actually.
[1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:51.600]  It is kind of amazing.
[1:04:51.600 --> 1:04:52.920]  I hope we get to the bottom of it.
[1:04:52.920 --> 1:04:54.320]  I know there are Russians there somewhere.
[1:04:54.320 --> 1:05:00.160]  Well, we say it's comical, but these criminals are trying to sabotage our recovery.
[1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:01.160]  Mike in New Jersey.
[1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:02.160]  You're on the air.
[1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:03.160]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[1:05:03.160 --> 1:05:04.160]  You are the man, Alex.
[1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:05.680]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:06.680]  I'm so excited.
[1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:07.680]  I'm such a big fan.
[1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:09.880]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[1:05:09.880 --> 1:05:12.520]  I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:13.520]  The bone broth.
[1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:14.520]  The bone broth.
[1:05:14.520 --> 1:05:15.520]  The bone broth.
[1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:16.520]  The bone broth.
[1:05:16.520 --> 1:05:17.520]  The bone broth.
[1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:22.520]  It tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:24.520]  It tastes like oval theme.
[1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:26.520]  It tastes like oval theme.
[1:05:26.520 --> 1:05:28.520]  It tastes like oval theme.
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:29.520]  Like, good.
[1:05:29.520 --> 1:05:30.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:34.520]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[1:05:34.520 --> 1:05:39.520]  I've used the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for
[1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:40.520]  that as well.
[1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:43.080]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:44.080]  I'm thanking you.
[1:05:44.080 --> 1:05:48.760]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:49.760]  the true bone broth.
[1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:50.760]  It is next level.
[1:05:50.760 --> 1:05:51.760]  It really is good.
[1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:52.760]  Thank you.
[1:05:52.760 --> 1:05:53.760]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[1:05:53.760 --> 1:05:54.760]  Thank you.
[1:05:54.760 --> 1:06:21.720]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide its
[1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:50.060]  products and products.
[1:06:50.060 --> 1:06:53.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide and I wanted to get constitutional
[1:06:53.900 --> 1:06:59.980]  lawyer, prominent civil rights lawyer as well, Robert Barnes on, because he's been following
[1:06:59.980 --> 1:07:06.500]  very, very closely what's been happening with the persecution of the president.
[1:07:06.500 --> 1:07:12.140]  And I want to be very, very clear here, if Michael Moore was put in prison, given a multi
[1:07:12.140 --> 1:07:17.700]  year prison sentence and spent nine months in jail for getting five of his friends to
[1:07:17.700 --> 1:07:23.020]  give small campaign donations to somebody, I'd say that was political persecution.
[1:07:23.020 --> 1:07:29.460]  That happened to Dinesh D'Souza and everybody from the young turds to Michael Moore celebrated
[1:07:29.460 --> 1:07:30.660]  it.
[1:07:30.660 --> 1:07:37.220]  And now you've got massive persecution of the free press going on in this country, not
[1:07:37.220 --> 1:07:44.140]  by Trump, but by Obama previously and now by state prosecutors against these pro-lifers
[1:07:44.140 --> 1:07:50.580]  that got the pro-abortionist on tape at restaurants and other places talking about making millions
[1:07:50.580 --> 1:07:55.900]  of dollars off selling baby parts, which is illegal.
[1:07:55.900 --> 1:07:58.980]  Even the LA Times said, this is persecution of the press.
[1:07:58.980 --> 1:08:02.060]  Well, I don't like Bill Clinton and I didn't like Barack Obama.
[1:08:02.060 --> 1:08:06.380]  There was plenty of stuff to go after them that was real, selling out the country, missile
[1:08:06.380 --> 1:08:09.900]  secrets, open borders.
[1:08:09.900 --> 1:08:14.780]  Imagine if they wanted to go back 40 years into Obama's tax returns or his kid's tax
[1:08:14.780 --> 1:08:17.140]  returns or his family's.
[1:08:17.140 --> 1:08:22.100]  If they wanted to put it all over television, if they wanted to illegally spy on him and
[1:08:22.100 --> 1:08:25.900]  then get caught spying on him, that's really the issue here.
[1:08:25.900 --> 1:08:28.780]  And I was talking to Barnes this weekend about it.
[1:08:28.780 --> 1:08:29.780]  He was making a lot of great points.
[1:08:29.780 --> 1:08:33.220]  I said, please come on the show next week.
[1:08:33.220 --> 1:08:34.580]  He's been busy in courting things.
[1:08:34.580 --> 1:08:39.660]  He could do it today to lay out the facts here because this is very, very clear.
[1:08:39.660 --> 1:08:41.420]  They're calling it a constitutional crisis.
[1:08:41.420 --> 1:08:46.500]  Well, that's only if the questions are so close for my research that there's a debate
[1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:47.500]  there.
[1:08:47.500 --> 1:08:52.620]  I don't think there is a constitutional crisis, Bob, or maybe I'm wrong.
[1:08:52.620 --> 1:08:57.700]  Is it this a crisis and that the Democrats are completely authoritarian and out of control?
[1:08:57.700 --> 1:08:59.900]  That is precisely the case.
[1:08:59.900 --> 1:09:05.140]  I mean, what is frightening here is Congress historically has been limited in its subpoena
[1:09:05.140 --> 1:09:06.140]  power.
[1:09:06.140 --> 1:09:12.340]  So historically, Congress cannot use as its excuse to go after private citizens, go after
[1:09:12.340 --> 1:09:13.860]  private records.
[1:09:13.860 --> 1:09:18.380]  It can only use its very limited subpoena power to give you an idea, the United States
[1:09:18.380 --> 1:09:23.660]  Senate never even did or used its subpoena power for investigative purposes for the
[1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:27.580]  first 70 years of our constitutional republic.
[1:09:27.580 --> 1:09:31.780]  So this was not something that was considered by the founders to be inherent in Congress.
[1:09:31.780 --> 1:09:36.620]  In fact, they were afraid of abuse of power by Congress because of what had happened in
[1:09:36.620 --> 1:09:37.620]  the parliament.
[1:09:37.620 --> 1:09:43.420]  In parliament in the UK, they had used their quote unquote subpoena powers and quasi prosecutorial
[1:09:43.420 --> 1:09:49.580]  powers to wrongfully harass ministers, put people in the tower, all kinds of abuses.
[1:09:49.580 --> 1:09:53.540]  So the whole point and purpose was that the executive branch would have the enforcement
[1:09:53.540 --> 1:09:56.020]  power, not the legislative branch.
[1:09:56.020 --> 1:10:01.380]  And the legislative branch is subpoena powers limited to solely oversight of the government
[1:10:01.380 --> 1:10:08.300]  officials themselves related to their public conduct or related to matters of pending legislation.
[1:10:08.300 --> 1:10:11.060]  And what they've done here is they've completely eviscerated that.
[1:10:11.060 --> 1:10:16.460]  The two Obama appointed judges, one in D.C., one yesterday in New York, issued orders that
[1:10:16.460 --> 1:10:23.660]  compelled banks, accountants, and private agencies to disclose a wide range of records
[1:10:23.660 --> 1:10:28.580]  that concerned the records of private Americans, including records of President Trump before
[1:10:28.580 --> 1:10:31.180]  he was ever president, before he was ever a candidate.
[1:10:31.180 --> 1:10:32.540]  But it went beyond that.
[1:10:32.540 --> 1:10:36.820]  It went to businesses and organizations merely because they have an affiliation or association
[1:10:36.820 --> 1:10:37.820]  with Trump.
[1:10:37.820 --> 1:10:42.460]  Actually, it even included the records of minor citizens, minor children.
[1:10:42.460 --> 1:10:44.460]  This is how insane this is.
[1:10:44.460 --> 1:10:48.500]  So when you add it up and you aggregate it, what you get is something that's very disturbing,
[1:10:48.500 --> 1:10:53.380]  that's something that's very unsettling, because these two decisions completely eviscerate
[1:10:53.380 --> 1:10:58.380]  and eliminate privacy for all Americans in the entire country.
[1:10:58.380 --> 1:11:01.660]  Because the records that are being looked at, or the private records of private citizens
[1:11:01.660 --> 1:11:05.940]  during a time period that they were entirely private and the president himself was a private
[1:11:05.940 --> 1:11:10.660]  citizen, and they have no limit, that neither judge put any limit at all on the scope of
[1:11:10.660 --> 1:11:14.340]  these subpoenas or the records that can be obtained.
[1:11:14.340 --> 1:11:20.660]  They are using Trump to get Obama appointed judges to issue unprecedented power to the
[1:11:20.660 --> 1:11:27.060]  Democrats in Congress to go after anybody, anywhere, any place, any time for any reason.
[1:11:27.060 --> 1:11:31.900]  And it goes even beyond that, because what they actually publicly stated yesterday, the
[1:11:31.900 --> 1:11:37.260]  Democrats lawyer in court, said their entire purpose of getting all of these intimate private
[1:11:37.260 --> 1:11:43.340]  financial personal records was to publicly disclose those records to the world.
[1:11:43.340 --> 1:11:49.660]  So this is a shocking, frightening, unprecedented invasion of privacy that threatens the rights
[1:11:49.660 --> 1:11:53.820]  of every American, and that if it's not reversed by the higher courts, either the appellate
[1:11:53.820 --> 1:11:59.900]  courts or the Supreme Court, no American's privacy is any longer protected from the United
[1:11:59.900 --> 1:12:00.900]  States Congress.
[1:12:00.900 --> 1:12:06.820]  So let me as a layperson that tracks this quantified, and you correct me if I'm wrong.
[1:12:06.820 --> 1:12:12.420]  After hijacking the executive, even after Obama left office, they left stay-behind groups
[1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:18.820]  in there, rogue groups that ran this illegal out-of-control witch hunt that came up completely
[1:12:18.820 --> 1:12:25.380]  dry, and as you said, the executive is who carries out these prosecutions.
[1:12:25.380 --> 1:12:27.500]  So now we have a real constitutional crisis.
[1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:32.140]  Not that Trump won't give this up, but that the legislative via the Democrats is now trying
[1:12:32.140 --> 1:12:40.020]  to usurp the executive power of prosecution, of investigation, and is now completely rogue,
[1:12:40.020 --> 1:12:45.220]  mad dog, complicit with the controlled corporate press, most of it owned by foreign operatives
[1:12:45.220 --> 1:12:50.620]  like the Chinese, communist, and they are, as you said, publicly admitting they intend
[1:12:50.620 --> 1:12:55.740]  to harass everyone involved, twist everything involved, just like they're doing with us
[1:12:55.740 --> 1:12:57.260]  in the Sandy Hook situation.
[1:12:57.260 --> 1:13:02.260]  I mean, this really is the tactic to take law in this country and then to completely
[1:13:02.260 --> 1:13:03.260]  subvert it.
[1:13:03.260 --> 1:13:04.260]  Absolutely.
[1:13:04.260 --> 1:13:08.500]  And in fact, it even goes further than that, because the executive branch would not have
[1:13:08.500 --> 1:13:14.740]  the capacity to issue this kind of subpoena that goes to so many records of so many people
[1:13:14.740 --> 1:13:19.660]  over such a long period of time that is not limited in any way, shape, or form.
[1:13:19.660 --> 1:13:25.540]  Even the Obama-pointed judge yesterday in New York admitted that this was an extraordinarily
[1:13:25.540 --> 1:13:32.220]  overly broad subpoena, yet then took no action at all to limit or restrict the scope of it.
[1:13:32.220 --> 1:13:36.140]  So this is something that a judge would not have the authority to do.
[1:13:36.140 --> 1:13:39.340]  This is something that the prosecutor would not have authority to do.
[1:13:39.340 --> 1:13:42.140]  A grand jury would not have the authority to do.
[1:13:42.140 --> 1:13:47.340]  People litigants in civil discovery normally would not have the power to do, because this
[1:13:47.340 --> 1:13:52.580]  is goes far beyond just records that are material or pertinent to a particular inquiry.
[1:13:52.580 --> 1:13:56.180]  These are just, hey, we would like to look at all your records over a 10, 20-year time
[1:13:56.180 --> 1:13:57.180]  period.
[1:13:57.180 --> 1:14:01.300]  Which, by the way, people don't understand, even with cheap lawyers, it would cost Trump
[1:14:01.300 --> 1:14:03.180]  hundreds of millions of dollars.
[1:14:03.180 --> 1:14:07.340]  And then there's no way to comply with all of it, so they're going to claim contempt.
[1:14:07.340 --> 1:14:12.580]  So pulling back from this, this is beyond a runaway train, then, Bob Barnes.
[1:14:12.580 --> 1:14:16.980]  And this is a foaming at the mouth, piranha-like attack.
[1:14:16.980 --> 1:14:18.300]  What does the president need to do?
[1:14:18.300 --> 1:14:23.380]  I know he needs to refuse it, declare executive privilege, but when you've got runaway courts
[1:14:23.380 --> 1:14:31.380]  and activist judiciary with activist media, with activist Democrats in a trifecta of authoritarianism,
[1:14:31.380 --> 1:14:32.620]  what does Trump do?
[1:14:32.620 --> 1:14:36.780]  It's going to be a little bit counterintuitive for him, but what he needs to do is this is
[1:14:36.780 --> 1:14:38.540]  really not about him.
[1:14:38.540 --> 1:14:43.740]  This is about, he needs to make this case about the privacy rights of every single American.
[1:14:43.740 --> 1:14:47.020]  Make it about the minor child's records that they're trying to seize.
[1:14:47.020 --> 1:14:50.180]  Make it about third-party business records they're trying to seize.
[1:14:50.180 --> 1:14:53.260]  Make it about the private citizen's records they're trying to seize.
[1:14:53.260 --> 1:14:57.700]  Make it say that in the name of attacking him, they're trying to deny Americans their
[1:14:57.700 --> 1:15:02.020]  fundamental constitutional rights to privacy that will eliminate and eviscerate those rights
[1:15:02.020 --> 1:15:03.020]  for them.
[1:15:03.020 --> 1:15:06.940]  If they want Congress or some Congress person who has a personal grievance or grudge to
[1:15:06.940 --> 1:15:11.540]  wage a personal war and use their congressional power against them, this threatens every
[1:15:11.540 --> 1:15:15.780]  American, everywhere, all of it for all of the future.
[1:15:15.780 --> 1:15:19.500]  So you just said when you come back and flesh this out, as a prominent constitutional lawyer
[1:15:19.500 --> 1:15:22.220]  and civil rights lawyer, very prominent, one of the top guys in the country, if folks
[1:15:22.220 --> 1:15:25.820]  in case you didn't know, with Robert Barns here, you just said it, just like I was saying,
[1:15:25.820 --> 1:15:26.820]  it's what they're doing to me.
[1:15:26.820 --> 1:15:29.020]  It's what they're doing to everybody.
[1:15:29.020 --> 1:15:35.940]  This is this new legal tyranny, judicial tyranny with Democrats in the legislative branch,
[1:15:35.940 --> 1:15:41.100]  and it's a threat to everyone, and so this is a giant out-of-control power grab and
[1:15:41.100 --> 1:15:42.100]  you're right.
[1:15:42.100 --> 1:15:44.260]  Trump shouldn't make it about how he had nothing wrong.
[1:15:44.260 --> 1:15:45.260]  We know that.
[1:15:45.260 --> 1:15:49.860]  He has to make it about this is a total power grab, usurpation, reign of terror.
[1:15:49.860 --> 1:15:52.500]  We'll be back with Robert Barns, ladies and gentlemen.

[1:18:13.420 --> 1:18:17.420]  They've tried to ban us off every platform out there, but we've just gotten stronger
[1:18:17.420 --> 1:18:22.420]  because you've taken action with hashtag Alex Jones.

[1:18:27.420 --> 1:18:32.420]  if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones, we are unstoppable together.

[1:18:58.420 --> 1:19:06.420]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western world history.
[1:19:06.420 --> 1:19:15.420]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order not to say the name Alex Jones or infowars.com.
[1:19:20.420 --> 1:19:24.420]  This is Nazi Germany level. This is racketeering. This is cartels.
[1:19:24.420 --> 1:19:30.420]  Mr. President, we need your help. We need it now. You can take on Big Tech.
[1:19:30.420 --> 1:19:37.420]  We saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[1:19:37.420 --> 1:19:41.420]  populist organization. So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones,
[1:19:41.420 --> 1:19:47.420]  then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[1:19:47.420 --> 1:19:52.420]  The way to fight back is to support infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom
[1:19:52.420 --> 1:20:00.420]  and free speech. Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[1:20:22.420 --> 1:20:42.420]  Welcome back, folks. I'm Alex Jones, your host, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer,
[1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:47.420]  famous civil rights lawyer, one of the winningest records out there,
[1:20:47.420 --> 1:20:56.420]  really smart fellow. He is not giving you rhetoric. He's not telling you what he wants to believe about Trump.
[1:20:56.420 --> 1:21:02.420]  He's not even Republican or Democrat. He's nonpartisan. He's telling you the reality.
[1:21:02.420 --> 1:21:08.420]  And if you've studied history, like I have, I know most of you have, you've never heard of anything like this.
[1:21:08.420 --> 1:21:16.420]  I mean, when you've got a woman in the White House having sex with a president and then she goes public and things,
[1:21:16.420 --> 1:21:20.420]  there's some way for the courts to get involved because there's a real person.
[1:21:20.420 --> 1:21:25.420]  Something's happened. There's a individual that has standing.
[1:21:25.420 --> 1:21:30.420]  But when Trump doesn't have any criminal past or any criminal history or any problems,
[1:21:30.420 --> 1:21:34.420]  and then as soon as he runs for office, he goes from being popular to Satan,
[1:21:34.420 --> 1:21:43.420]  and he's found completely innocent after a three-year illegal proctology exam fiasco.
[1:21:43.420 --> 1:21:47.420]  They've all committed all these incredible crimes to do it.
[1:21:47.420 --> 1:21:57.420]  And now they were selected jurisdictions in Chicago, in Cook County, and in Maryland, in Baltimore, and in D.C.,
[1:21:57.420 --> 1:22:04.420]  and in the Southern District of New York, with Obama and Hillary appointed foaming at the mouth attack dogs,
[1:22:04.420 --> 1:22:10.420]  saying we're going to get him. He's going down when they started the investigations.
[1:22:10.420 --> 1:22:16.420]  Well, that's just insane. And, you know, Robert, what blows me away here is how naked they are,
[1:22:16.420 --> 1:22:21.420]  and even admitting it's political, and the talking points, and Pelosi stuttering,
[1:22:21.420 --> 1:22:27.420]  and the fact that, though, Trump isn't more on the offense. We'll talk about that more in the next segment,
[1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:32.420]  but sure, he's appointed this U.S. attorney that, you know, goes after corrupt FBI and stuff.
[1:22:32.420 --> 1:22:35.420]  Okay, great. You know, they're getting really scared.
[1:22:35.420 --> 1:22:40.420]  But now this isn't just about Trump's duty to prosecute the deep state.
[1:22:40.420 --> 1:22:45.420]  They aren't giving up, it looks like, to me. They're putting their afterburners on.
[1:22:45.420 --> 1:22:50.420]  And I'm just wondering how bad this is going to get. What do you think is going to unfold here?
[1:22:50.420 --> 1:22:54.420]  Like you said, this is unprecedented.
[1:22:54.420 --> 1:23:02.420]  Precisely. I mean, for example, back at the end of the 1900s, there was an attempt by Congress to go after people that were some of the robber barons.
[1:23:02.420 --> 1:23:07.420]  And those are some of, you know, people who actually were involved in extensive levels of corruption, et cetera.
[1:23:07.420 --> 1:23:10.420]  The United States Supreme Court said, no, you can't do that.
[1:23:10.420 --> 1:23:19.420]  Congress does not have the power to use its legislative power to pretend to be a prosecutorial body and invade the privacy of third parties or private citizens.
[1:23:19.420 --> 1:23:24.420]  This continued throughout after the, during the HUAC committees, the House Un-American Activities Committee,
[1:23:24.420 --> 1:23:29.420]  advised by Democrats, run by Democrats, controlled by Democrats in the 1950s,
[1:23:29.420 --> 1:23:34.420]  which actually, it was not the Joe McCarthy committee that actually did most of the abuses.
[1:23:34.420 --> 1:23:37.420]  It was the Democratic House Committee that did most of the abuses.
[1:23:37.420 --> 1:23:40.420]  The abuses were so bad, the U.S. Supreme Court stepped in again.
[1:23:40.420 --> 1:23:45.420]  Famous case called Blackkins versus the United States, where the Supreme Court again stated,
[1:23:45.420 --> 1:23:49.420]  Congress does not have the power to ransack people's private thoughts, private records,
[1:23:49.420 --> 1:23:53.420]  either through compelled testimony or compelled disclosure of financial or other records.
[1:23:53.420 --> 1:23:59.420]  Then other courts have followed that up in the 60s and 70s when Congress used its aging committee or its other committee,
[1:23:59.420 --> 1:24:04.420]  selects subcommittee on aging, selects subcommittee on different items to try to go after private citizens.
[1:24:04.420 --> 1:24:09.420]  And repeatedly, including the Southern District of New York in a Bergman case, said, no, you can't do that.
[1:24:09.420 --> 1:24:12.420]  You can't seek private records of private citizens.
[1:24:12.420 --> 1:24:18.420]  You can't, your soul and whole objective is to craft and draft and pass laws.
[1:24:18.420 --> 1:24:20.420]  It's not to try to enforce laws.
[1:24:20.420 --> 1:24:28.420]  It's not to try to apply laws. It is not try to ransack people's personal private records because they knew how dangerous it would be
[1:24:28.420 --> 1:24:35.420]  if we have these peeping Tom politicians being able to ransack or go window shopping to any American citizen.
[1:24:35.420 --> 1:24:40.420]  They just happen to dislike or who is their political or ideological adversary.
[1:24:40.420 --> 1:24:43.420]  And that is precisely what is taking place now by Congress.
[1:24:43.420 --> 1:24:47.420]  And that is why it is such a unique, unprecedented, unparalleled threat.
[1:24:47.420 --> 1:24:53.420]  And that it is ironic that it is happening because of a president who's been completely innocent
[1:24:53.420 --> 1:24:58.420]  and who's only been guilty of getting the ordinary, everyday American people to support a political revolution
[1:24:58.420 --> 1:25:07.420]  to try to overturn the institutionalized corruption that led us to this stage in place where Trump could get elected in the first place.
[1:25:07.420 --> 1:25:17.420]  Pulling back from this, you just crystallize it perfectly. This is the legislative branch taking on the executive branch,
[1:25:17.420 --> 1:25:20.420]  which is over the FBI, the CIA, all of it.
[1:25:20.420 --> 1:25:26.420]  Literally, this is a power grab for the first time in 240-something years of our history.
[1:25:26.420 --> 1:25:31.420]  This is the first time at this level, as you pointed out, it happened back in the 50s a little bit,
[1:25:31.420 --> 1:25:37.420]  that the legislative branch has tried to basically make itself all three branches of government,
[1:25:37.420 --> 1:25:41.420]  because it's acting like a judiciary, it's acting like the legislature,
[1:25:41.420 --> 1:25:47.420]  and it's also trying to act like the executive, and then it's engaged in all of this intimidation and threats.
[1:25:47.420 --> 1:25:49.420]  It's really become a tyranny.
[1:25:49.420 --> 1:25:53.420]  Precisely. It's classic of extension of what Obama did with the presidency.
[1:25:53.420 --> 1:26:00.420]  It is an attempt to usurp authority that previously they did not have and that the Constitution explicitly denied them.
[1:26:00.420 --> 1:26:04.420]  So you see them adjudicating Attorney General Barr in contempt.
[1:26:04.420 --> 1:26:10.420]  Well, that's the judiciary branch's objective and obligation, and the prosecutorial branch's duty and obligation.
[1:26:10.420 --> 1:26:15.420]  And here you have them usurping the executive branch's investigative role,
[1:26:15.420 --> 1:26:19.420]  and doing so in a way that even the executive branch could not get away with.
[1:26:19.420 --> 1:26:25.420]  The executive branch would need probable cause of criminal conduct to have a grand jury try to examine these records,
[1:26:25.420 --> 1:26:26.420]  and even then they would have-
[1:26:26.420 --> 1:26:31.420]  Oh yeah, Mueller only asked for a few years of Roger Stone stuff. He didn't say give us 40 years,
[1:26:31.420 --> 1:26:33.420]  and people were saying Mueller was out of control.
[1:26:33.420 --> 1:26:37.420]  Oh, absolutely. What it is, is they're unsatisfied with what Mueller did,
[1:26:37.420 --> 1:26:39.420]  so they've decided they're just going to replace Mueller,
[1:26:39.420 --> 1:26:44.420]  and in the process they're going to eviscerate the privacy rights of every single American to achieve it and accomplish it.
[1:26:44.420 --> 1:26:51.420]  And unfortunately they have a bunch of complicit Obama-appointed judges who are making decisions that are purely politically motivated.
[1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:57.420]  To give it a parallel, to give an example, does anybody think that if the Republican Senate, assuming they ever got the honus,
[1:26:57.420 --> 1:27:03.420]  actually decided to subpoena Joe Biden's and Hunter Biden's and the Biden's family records for the time period-
[1:27:03.420 --> 1:27:07.420]  The Democrats would never put up with that hell shift that's come out,
[1:27:07.420 --> 1:27:12.420]  and even said that they can't have Biden's records from two years ago on Ukraine.
[1:27:12.420 --> 1:27:19.420]  Exactly. So here you have Biden's records related to his family's getting huge payoffs from Chinese government officials,
[1:27:19.420 --> 1:27:25.420]  from Ukrainian oligarchs and from others according to various published reliable allegations in the press,
[1:27:25.420 --> 1:27:30.420]  that's far more reliable and trustworthy than the completely discounted, discredited allegations against the president,
[1:27:30.420 --> 1:27:39.420]  and yet if any subpoena was issued for those records, these same Obama-appointed judges would suddenly remember and rediscover their privacy rights.
[1:27:39.420 --> 1:27:42.420]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, Schiff as you know last week signaled, he said,
[1:27:42.420 --> 1:27:43.740]  There are committee won't hear it.
[1:27:43.740 --> 1:27:46.100]  We're not going to ask for it and no judges should.
[1:27:46.100 --> 1:27:48.260]  Nothing Biden's done is subpoenable.
[1:27:48.260 --> 1:27:50.780]  He is above the law because it's political
[1:27:50.780 --> 1:27:52.200]  because he's running for office.
[1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:53.860]  Well, Trump's running for office too.
[1:27:53.860 --> 1:27:56.540]  So, I mean, the paradox here
[1:27:56.540 --> 1:27:59.500]  where they don't care how hypocritical they look now.
[1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:00.340]  Oh, exactly.
[1:28:00.340 --> 1:28:01.180]  I mean, for example, what would have happened
[1:28:01.180 --> 1:28:03.620]  if the Republican house when it actually had control
[1:28:03.620 --> 1:28:05.580]  had subpoenaed all the records of anybody connected
[1:28:05.580 --> 1:28:06.940]  to the Clinton foundation?
[1:28:06.940 --> 1:28:09.060]  There would have been a more legitimate basis for that
[1:28:09.060 --> 1:28:10.260]  than there is of this.
[1:28:10.260 --> 1:28:12.180]  And yet all of the Obama appointed judges
[1:28:12.180 --> 1:28:13.820]  would have remembered the First Amendment rights,
[1:28:13.820 --> 1:28:15.780]  the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights,
[1:28:15.780 --> 1:28:17.380]  which encompassed the right to privacy
[1:28:17.380 --> 1:28:18.860]  of every ordinary American
[1:28:18.860 --> 1:28:21.820]  against congressional intrusion and invasion of that privacy
[1:28:21.820 --> 1:28:23.700]  by peeping Tom politicians.
[1:28:23.700 --> 1:28:25.500]  And that is why this is so dangerous.
[1:28:25.500 --> 1:28:28.140]  This is authorizing every politician in Congress
[1:28:28.140 --> 1:28:29.620]  to become a peeping Tom
[1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:32.180]  against the ordinary privacy rights of everyday Americans.
[1:28:32.180 --> 1:28:33.380]  This isn't a witch hunt.
[1:28:33.380 --> 1:28:34.900]  This is an inquisition.
[1:28:36.140 --> 1:28:37.260]  Robert Barnes is our guest.
[1:28:37.260 --> 1:28:39.620]  We'll talk about how he thinks Trump should strike back.
[1:28:39.620 --> 1:28:43.780]  Plus, high Canadian courts has threatened us.
[1:28:43.780 --> 1:28:45.660]  It was an article on infowars.com.
[1:28:45.660 --> 1:28:49.180]  They say you will not report on us drugging small children
[1:28:49.180 --> 1:28:50.860]  and chopping their genitals off.
[1:28:50.860 --> 1:28:51.700]  I'm not kidding.
[1:28:51.700 --> 1:28:52.940]  They're telling us in America,
[1:28:52.940 --> 1:28:55.500]  we'll chop their balls off, sit down and shut up.
[1:28:57.460 --> 1:28:58.660]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[1:28:58.660 --> 1:29:00.780]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[1:29:00.780 --> 1:29:02.580]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[1:29:02.580 --> 1:29:04.140]  I sued the IRS in one.
[1:29:04.140 --> 1:29:07.100]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[1:33:35.800 --> 1:33:37.800]  I
[1:33:57.080 --> 1:34:01.560]  ladies and gentlemen robert barns constitutional lawyer civil rights lawyer
[1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:06.880]  with one of the most successful records in the country joins us and we've been
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:10.880]  talking about the incredible usurpation of power the legislative under the
[1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:15.080]  democrats in the house becoming a government under themselves they already
[1:34:15.080 --> 1:34:20.320]  tried to put Mueller up there as this god that failed that whole operation was
[1:34:20.320 --> 1:34:25.200]  a crime it's now come out now they're going even further so what does president
[1:34:25.200 --> 1:34:30.360]  trump need to do recapping some what you already said himself in the way
[1:34:30.360 --> 1:34:37.000]  handles this but also what do we do what should the executive do proactively
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:41.640]  not just in how we ourselves respond to being accused of being criminals by these
[1:34:41.640 --> 1:34:45.360]  criminals by this inquisition but how does the president go on the offense
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:49.120]  against this with all the crimes they've already committed because it's clear
[1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:52.440]  they're not suing for peace when they've been caught committing all these crimes
[1:34:52.440 --> 1:34:57.840]  they're going for broke so recap what you said very powerful very historical
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:03.000]  that this is cancer the democrats can't pass their gun confiscation they can't
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:07.560]  pass their open borders they're just doing it by fiat and so at every level
[1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:13.680]  it's just a total power grab break that down for us sure so the president needs
[1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:17.200]  to assert that this is one of the most dangerous and precarious threats to
[1:35:17.200 --> 1:35:21.800]  individual privacy in the history of this country and and while it is about
[1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:25.600]  him personally the reality is the precedent that can be set by this case
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:29.400]  will endanger the privacy rights of every ordinary American will create
[1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:34.960]  will make Congress a third party of the surveillance state and allow the any
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:39.720]  politician to become a peeping Tom politician and to spy on any citizen
[1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:42.480]  anywhere in the country that they happen to disagree with using their
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:46.600]  congressional powers to do so powers at the Constitution explicitly and
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:51.040]  expressly denied Congress in the first place secondly the president needs to
[1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:56.440]  use his the power of his public platform to add to basically to both educate and
[1:35:56.440 --> 1:36:01.080]  inform and to motivate the American public to recognize how consequential
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:04.760]  this issue is judges and courts and everybody else pays attention to what's
[1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:08.880]  happening in the court of public opinion and it is critically essential as as
[1:36:08.880 --> 1:36:12.920]  important as to the courts of law that the public opinion rally behind the
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:16.680]  president to recognize that whatever anyone even thinks of the president this
[1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:19.920]  is the kind of invasion of a privacy that is both unprecedented and
[1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:23.680]  unparalleled and that cannot be permitted to take place in the United
[1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:27.400]  States if we are to have constitutional rights and liberties against the power of
[1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:31.600]  an invasive Congress third the actions that need to be taken by the executive
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:36.120]  branch writ large is to continue to fight this fight in the courts but also to
[1:36:36.120 --> 1:36:41.400]  examine opportunities it can have to make to put these politicians on the
[1:36:41.400 --> 1:36:46.200]  other side of the aisle so Leo let's have it if it's gonna be open season then
[1:36:46.200 --> 1:36:49.680]  parts of the executive branch can examine whether or not they can do
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:53.440]  investigations into the Clinton Foundation whether that should be reopened
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:57.480]  where they can do an investigation into the Biden corruption it was both parties
[1:36:57.480 --> 1:37:00.600]  and both sides can play at this and the executive branch is the only one that
[1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:05.160]  has the constitutional authority to actually do so so I think that it the
[1:37:05.160 --> 1:37:08.920]  courts need to be put into the position where they recognize the errors of their
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:12.600]  ways where they recognize this will not be applied just in what in a one-way
[1:37:12.600 --> 1:37:17.080]  fashion to favor just one side and if they recognize that hopefully they will
[1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:21.360]  then realize that they need to reassert the original constitutional rights and
[1:37:21.360 --> 1:37:24.920]  liberties that were always present and this is the rights that were founded
[1:37:24.920 --> 1:37:27.960]  from the beginning of the country ordinary citizens do not get to have
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:32.560]  their personal thoughts personal ideas and personal records ran ransacked by
[1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:37.280]  prying peeping Tom politicians I want you elaborate on that but just at a
[1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:43.120]  instinctive level as an American is just a father as a businessman as a journalist
[1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:47.360]  they've committed all these crimes illegal spying all of it they've been
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:51.200]  caught and then now they don't get in trouble and they start 20-something new
[1:37:51.200 --> 1:37:55.600]  investigations and they're gonna subpoena thousands of people and and
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:37:59.160]  hundreds of Trump's companies to obviously harass the living hell out of
[1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:04.360]  him what if Trump because they say Trump doesn't even have the power to order the
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:07.560]  FBI to investigate people when he obviously does constitutionally imagine
[1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:13.240]  he says fine I want 40 years of Pelosi and Earl mafia family I want 40 years of
[1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:19.540]  you know of all these other crazy people people like Maxine Waters and her
[1:38:19.540 --> 1:38:24.040]  husband getting tens of millions to his own private bank directly from her or if
[1:38:24.040 --> 1:38:28.480]  Trump says okay we're gonna subpoena 30 years or 40 years of Obama's records
[1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:33.600]  they would crap their pants flip out and run into the shadows but instead
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:38.000]  Trump is surrounded by all these lawyers and these FBI leaders that I think are
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.340]  working for the other side and they just tell him to sit there like a sitting
[1:38:41.340 --> 1:38:44.960]  duck and take this crap he has the constitutional authority to light their
[1:38:44.960 --> 1:38:50.520]  ass up and so I say let's go after Pelosi and Hillary and Obama and do
[1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:53.560]  exactly what they're doing to Trump they'll put their tail between their
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:58.200]  legs and leave immediately and let America be great again why in the hell
[1:38:58.200 --> 1:39:02.840]  then is that not happening exactly for example the president could do that
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:06.640]  publicly independent of the executive power that he has he comes out and says
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:10.640]  what we just said he said it's common sense they just did it to me and it's
[1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:14.880]  not even their jurisdiction it's my jurisdiction and now I'm coming for you
[1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:20.120]  they have opened the freaking door oh precisely and what he could do is he
[1:39:20.120 --> 1:39:25.000]  could make an offer of settlement that he will drop all challenges and contests
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:30.400]  to any subpoena that the Democratic Congress is issuing in exchange for all
[1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:33.760]  of the exact same records that they are subpoenaing from him of the same
[1:39:33.760 --> 1:39:38.960]  category and kind be disclosed by every Democratic member of Congress by
[1:39:38.960 --> 1:39:43.240]  congressman Amash up in Michigan who wants to talk about impeachment they
[1:39:43.240 --> 1:39:47.920]  can look at his Chinese financial ties by and by the last two Democratic
[1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:52.160]  presidents both president Obama all of his sealed records that are still sealed
[1:39:52.160 --> 1:39:55.840]  all get publicly disclosed and president Clinton including the Clinton
[1:39:55.840 --> 1:40:00.520]  Foundation and every Democratic candidate for president state of California was
[1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:03.240]  trying to condition ballot access on various things they can't do
[1:40:03.240 --> 1:40:07.600]  constitutionally well fine let's have everybody abide by the same standards
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:11.720]  the Democrats in the house are saying we should have a uniform set of rules
[1:40:11.720 --> 1:40:15.840]  that we need to have full transparency of public officials and that's why we're
[1:40:15.840 --> 1:40:19.320]  doing all of this microscopic macroscopic inquiry into private
[1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:23.280]  citizens records that's what we're prying into private citizens records from
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:27.160]  time periods that the president himself was a private citizen okay fun let's
[1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:30.960]  have Pelosi do the same let's have let's have every Democratic congressman do
[1:40:30.960 --> 1:40:34.400]  the same let's have every Democratic senator do the same let's have every
[1:40:34.400 --> 1:40:37.720]  Democratic candidate for the presidency including Senator Joe Biden and his
[1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:41.600]  family members Hunter Biden do the same and he should publicly offer that and
[1:40:41.600 --> 1:40:45.440]  then the utility of it is if they were sincere if they were correct they would
[1:40:45.440 --> 1:40:49.200]  take them up but everybody knows there's zero chance they will do that and
[1:40:49.200 --> 1:40:52.720]  consequently will expose them for the hypocrisy and the duplicity with which
[1:40:52.720 --> 1:40:56.080]  they are operating it suggests that they are the ones that are operating in
[1:40:56.080 --> 1:41:01.080]  secret hiding information I mean the president Trump is one of the only
[1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:05.400]  politicians in recent American history to get poorer by going into public
[1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:10.560]  office all of the LBJ went from like a million to like two billion or something
[1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:16.880]  exactly and it's insane and he waived executive privilege on millions of
[1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:21.360]  emails and no one ever did that oh precisely well I mean as you've
[1:41:21.360 --> 1:41:25.320]  experienced doubts the parties that when you have voluntarily provide
[1:41:25.320 --> 1:41:28.840]  information when you willingly provide information when you help facilitate
[1:41:28.840 --> 1:41:33.240]  the providing of information all you do is get attacked for I mean the idea that
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:36.880]  Nancy Pelosi could be out yesterday talking about a cover-up when this has
[1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:41.360]  been the most transparent presidency in response to an illicit unauthorized
[1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:47.400]  unjust witch hunt in American political history is just absurd but he can expose
[1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:51.120]  all of it he can say look you guys claim that you want transparency for all
[1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:54.600]  public officials from their prior private conduct and anybody connected to
[1:41:54.600 --> 1:42:00.600]  them I'll do that if you do that you have all the Democratic game over right
[1:42:00.600 --> 1:42:05.840]  then precisely none of them can do it I mean Joe Biden's family has gotten rich
[1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:09.440]  while he's in office how did that happen Nancy Pelosi got rich while she was in
[1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:12.880]  office how did that happen Diane Feinstein got rich while she was in office
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:16.640]  how did that happen Kamala Harris got sweetheart book deals how did that happen
[1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:21.400]  the go through every Democratic politician who is President Obama hit all
[1:42:21.400 --> 1:42:24.640]  his college and that goes back to the fact we're going to break here that
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:27.320]  they're the oldest party in the country they've been getting away with
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:30.800]  everything forever they're the one-party system in this country the
[1:42:30.800 --> 1:42:34.160]  Republicans have just been these bitch-slap little minions and here comes
[1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:37.520]  this wildcard Trump and they don't know what to do and you're absolutely right
[1:42:37.520 --> 1:42:41.480]  they have opened the door for all of us I want to shift gears into other issues
[1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:45.160]  Abbanani and died again as you predicted here on here a month or so ago
[1:42:45.160 --> 1:42:50.680]  where that's going we're going to look at the big elections in Europe we're
[1:42:50.680 --> 1:42:55.640]  going to look at this this the situation with the parliament and the
[1:42:55.640 --> 1:42:58.640]  courts in Canada coming out for me

[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:27.080]  my friends we are living in epic times these are not boring times
[1:47:27.080 --> 1:47:33.840]  constitutional lawyer successful natural lawyer civil rights lawyer Bob Barnes
[1:47:33.840 --> 1:47:36.640]  is going to write a show on this 50 minutes the next hour then Millie
[1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:42.080]  Weaver our reporter is going to be in studio with more breaking news I've
[1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:46.400]  covered a lot of news so far but I gotta tell you I haven't covered 10% that's
[1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:50.840]  why you've got to go to news wars.com you've got to go to info wars.com the
[1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:56.600]  globalist the corporate media the anti-free speech wolves are working
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:48:02.120]  around the clock to try to shut us down because our information is powerful I
[1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:07.040]  mean what you just heard Robert Barnes talk about is bedrock constitution
[1:48:07.040 --> 1:48:12.320]  Supreme Court rulings it's that's why they can't have us on air is because
[1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:19.280]  we're covering facts here and we have the fathers in studio who whose wives
[1:48:19.280 --> 1:48:24.600]  take their daughters in Texas and in Canada and in England we've had them on
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:29.280]  and then their daughters their sons get chemically or physically castrated and
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:34.920]  they have no say because the state tricked them to do it well now I've got
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:39.120]  the courts in Canada threatening me to not talk about it because there's these
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:43.800]  gag orders everywhere and they don't talk about kids being sterilized I mean
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:48.360]  this is crazy Canadian court tries to stop Alex Jones from covering trans
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:53.520]  child case everybody says hey why doesn't somebody stand up why doesn't
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:59.280]  somebody fight why doesn't somebody stand up well you go show an abortion
[1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:03.040]  clinic keeping babies alive and selling their organs you get indicted you don't
[1:49:03.040 --> 1:49:10.960]  get a Nobel Prize you expose kids being chemically sterilized you get you get
[1:49:10.960 --> 1:49:15.800]  courts threatening to arrest you and listen I'm willing to get arrested but
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:20.760]  I'm just saying you folks you get like we're fighting right like like we're not
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:25.120]  just up here shooting our mouths off I mean we're under total attack because we
[1:49:25.120 --> 1:49:29.480]  stand up for children everybody else and not because we're heroes my instinct is
[1:49:29.480 --> 1:49:34.200]  to stand up for kids that's just a default I walk out in a parking lot and
[1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:37.800]  some guys beating up a kid or a woman for no reason I'm gonna tell them to stop
[1:49:37.800 --> 1:49:40.520]  and if they don't stop I'm gonna stomp their head in the ground or die trying
[1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:45.680]  it's not because I'm Mr. Badass my cells are all aligned towards doing right
[1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:52.040]  thing and you know what evil has never beaten me yet because you've always
[1:49:52.040 --> 1:49:55.920]  backed me and I'll never give up and I'll never give in but I might give out
[1:49:55.920 --> 1:49:59.080]  folks like an old horse and you know that'd probably be a gift when it
[1:49:59.080 --> 1:50:03.560]  actually happens but I want to run this course as hard as I can for you and for
[1:50:03.560 --> 1:50:07.560]  myself and my family and it's personal for me and they've done a lot of stuff
[1:50:07.560 --> 1:50:12.320]  to me and that makes this actually a sweet fight but literally I need oxygen in
[1:50:12.320 --> 1:50:17.480]  my lungs I need him when in my sales I need like the Bible says out of God's
[1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:21.600]  nostrils he created the earth that will you are little little G you're in the
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:27.640]  image of God your breath your financial support is your will your work your
[1:50:27.640 --> 1:50:34.080]  strength is what is in my sales it's like the old parables of the Greek gods
[1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:38.240]  that people forgot them they died well it's stories folks if we forget America
[1:50:38.240 --> 1:50:41.960]  if we forget free market we forget real liberalism not the fake modern
[1:50:41.960 --> 1:50:46.960]  liberalism but real freedom it'll die but if we remember it our stories better
[1:50:46.960 --> 1:50:51.560]  than their story like the last game of thrones episode was so much hype I
[1:50:51.560 --> 1:50:55.440]  watched the last season it was pretty powerful and and and they're so they're
[1:50:55.440 --> 1:50:59.720]  talking about having a new king instead of a new war and they say people don't
[1:50:59.720 --> 1:51:04.880]  do all this for gold they'll do it for flags they do it for stories and we've
[1:51:04.880 --> 1:51:10.760]  got the better story story that delivers but this isn't like Netflix where you
[1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:15.600]  turn it on and Hollywood's funding it this is the embattled operation this
[1:51:15.600 --> 1:51:19.320]  is an operation where I wish back in the heyday I could snap my fingers and
[1:51:19.320 --> 1:51:23.240]  bring in millions of dollars but I was like oh I have enough so I didn't try to
[1:51:23.240 --> 1:51:29.960]  hoard piles of money I should have like a big fat dragon I didn't now we need the
[1:51:29.960 --> 1:51:35.640]  funds we have big specials Memorial Day specials that are running 60% off

[1:52:36.080 --> 1:52:39.880]  happens we're gonna keep going all right going back to Robert Barnes here we've
[1:52:39.880 --> 1:52:45.440]  talked a lot about Trump and the incredible tyranny we're seeing and
[1:52:45.440 --> 1:52:49.200]  since I have more time with you there 15 minutes the next hour let's spend this
[1:52:49.200 --> 1:52:55.040]  time finishing up with Trump what do you think the psychology is that we've got
[1:52:55.040 --> 1:52:58.400]  all the cards as nationalist the globalists have been caught in all this
[1:52:58.400 --> 1:53:03.440]  fraud all this illegal spying they've launched 20-plus investigations and then
[1:53:03.440 --> 1:53:08.480]  I guess Trump still doesn't have control of the executive he can't get the FBI
[1:53:08.480 --> 1:53:13.360]  and others to attack when it's clear and present and ridiculous for the law and
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:17.360]  our own self-interest that he should do this I mean what the hell how much will
[1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:22.920]  we put up with I mean no doubt I mean the extraordinary factor is if anyone
[1:53:22.920 --> 1:53:27.360]  doubted the existence of a deep state which was originated in the construct
[1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:30.920]  by a writer for the Economist back to the end of the 19th century to describe
[1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:34.320]  the dual state which was how do you how do you have part of the government
[1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:38.400]  continue to function and operate as if elections don't exist and he was just
[1:53:38.400 --> 1:53:41.360]  describing that phenomenon is this there's this new administrative state
[1:53:41.360 --> 1:53:45.240]  that basically replaces the elective poor portion of government this became
[1:53:45.240 --> 1:53:48.800]  further developed by people studying fascism particularly German refugee
[1:53:48.800 --> 1:53:52.960]  professors in the 1940s and then that evolved mostly by the left in the 60s
[1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:56.840]  and 70s into the term deep state to describe the rise of intelligence
[1:53:56.840 --> 1:54:00.920]  operations and high-ranking law enforcement and executive branch government
[1:54:00.920 --> 1:54:04.240]  components of the United States and foreign governments explaining how they
[1:54:04.240 --> 1:54:08.480]  could be completely immune from public elections well the Trump's election
[1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:11.720]  proves that without any question and beyond any doubt because here you have
[1:54:11.720 --> 1:54:15.880]  the president United States not even in control of his own FBI not even in
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:19.280]  control of his own Department of Justice and large parts of it not even
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:23.000]  control over the CIA not even control over large parts of the intelligence
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:28.240]  infrastructure of the counterintelligence operations at the FBI and CIA so it's
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:32.160]  frightening and terrifying the degree and the scope to which the president's
[1:54:32.160 --> 1:54:36.320]  election and his lack of power over his own executive branch and now he's
[1:54:36.320 --> 1:54:40.720]  facing a position where Congress is pretending to be the executive branch
[1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:45.040]  and pretending to be the judicial branch but doing it with the co-option of the
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:48.360]  judicial branch on behalf of the Democratic members of House who have
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:52.120]  abominable view of the power of their own power just as Obama thought of
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:55.400]  himself as not only president but also Congress and also the judicial branch
[1:54:55.400 --> 1:54:59.440]  whenever and wherever he could the first president to launch a massive spying
[1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:04.120]  campaign against his competitive to his preferred candidate in an election
[1:55:04.120 --> 1:55:08.600]  season the what the the biggest surveillance spying scandal in history
[1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:12.960]  was under President Obama the biggest levels of which hunt prosecutions
[1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:16.960]  against whistleblowers was against was under President Obama but now you have
[1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:20.680]  judges appointed by President Obama putting their imprint on the judiciary
[1:55:20.680 --> 1:55:24.640]  and that imprint is frightening that imprint is going to a degree that you
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:28.480]  know Stalinist courts would have been afraid to have gone so when you go to
[1:55:28.480 --> 1:55:31.280]  the point where you believe the legislative branch can you serve all
[1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:36.640]  the branches of government and to evade the privacy of ordinary Americans but
[1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:40.840]  without any limit or restriction at all then we're to a place in a position where
[1:55:40.840 --> 1:55:44.240]  the president is basically being limited and hamstrung by the people that are
[1:55:44.240 --> 1:55:48.520]  supposed to be working for him nobody in the executive branch was elected except
[1:55:48.520 --> 1:55:52.680]  President Trump and yet it's all the unelected people who are dictating
[1:55:52.680 --> 1:55:56.960]  policy dictating prosecutorial decisions dictating investigated decisions I
[1:55:56.960 --> 1:56:00.120]  mean for example the Department of Justice should have long ago opened up
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:03.880]  investigations into big tech there there's the FEC should have opened up
[1:56:03.880 --> 1:56:07.400]  investigations into big tech from meddling in elections here you have
[1:56:07.400 --> 1:56:10.680]  Facebook we talked earlier about the European elections Facebook has been
[1:56:10.680 --> 1:56:15.160]  meddling in the European elections by having a secret blacklist of people to
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:20.480]  target of people to censor of people to demonetize of people to de-platform in
[1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:24.160]  different ways sometimes overtly sometimes subvertly and they don't all
[1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:30.120]  the way through to try to influence the elections in the UK and Europe Wow and
[1:56:30.120 --> 1:56:33.840]  yet what we get what we have is a Department of Justice a federal
[1:56:33.840 --> 1:56:36.840]  elections commission a federal communications commission that has done
[1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:40.240]  nothing about it they've done zero they've done zoos they've done Zuka they've
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:44.840]  done nada and yet and why and yet we spent two years investigating a fake

[2:00:28.160 --> 2:00:31.920]  tyrannical investigations what's coming next you're getting into election
[2:00:31.920 --> 2:00:37.920]  meddling facebook admits mainline parties in spain and
[2:00:37.920 --> 2:00:41.920]  Greece and the UK they're banning them they're blocking them it's just it's
[2:00:41.920 --> 2:00:46.400]  just incredible oh no doubt about it i mean here we had a two-year
[2:00:46.400 --> 2:00:52.240]  investigation over 40 million dollars spent on behalf of the the Mueller team
[2:00:52.240 --> 2:00:56.640]  because purportedly election meddling and by big tech or an election meddling
[2:00:56.640 --> 2:01:01.360]  by foreign governments using big tech was a great clear and present danger to the
[2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:05.040]  future of democracy well there was actually no real election
[2:01:05.040 --> 2:01:09.200]  meddling that took place in the 2016 election that favored Trump of any
[2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:12.960]  great consequence of any kind and as the even muller
[2:01:12.960 --> 2:01:16.480]  one of the corrupt actors on behalf of the deep state who was who hired a huge
[2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:20.720]  notorious anti-trump prosecutorial team of a lot of ethically challenged
[2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:24.800]  prosecutors concluded no collusion no obstruction no
[2:01:24.800 --> 2:01:28.080]  crime and yet despite that we're now that we have
[2:01:28.080 --> 2:01:31.520]  real election meddling taking place and there was evidence of election meddling
[2:01:31.520 --> 2:01:35.440]  by facebook and others by the founder of LinkedIn in the
[2:01:35.440 --> 2:01:40.160]  2017 Alabama election that was later outed by the New York Times
[2:01:40.160 --> 2:01:44.560]  even the we've had facebook we had election meddling alleged in 2018
[2:01:44.560 --> 2:01:48.160]  and now we have clear undisputed undeniable evidence of election meddling
[2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:52.240]  throughout the european elections where a blacklist of facebook where
[2:01:52.240 --> 2:01:55.760]  facebook was blacklisting certain people targeting them for the purposes
[2:01:55.760 --> 2:02:00.480]  of interfering and impairing the electoral outcomes in the 2019
[2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:04.000]  european union parliamentary elections in the european union
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:07.440]  because the brexit party was surging in the united kingdom
[2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:11.200]  the populist parties were surging in spain surging in france
[2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:15.680]  surging in italy surging in greece for the purposes of challenging the european
[2:02:15.680 --> 2:02:18.800]  unions totalitarian and authoritarian structure
[2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:23.120]  to ideally undermine and end the european union all together as an
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:26.000]  experiment as an undemocratic anti-democratic
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:29.280]  experiment that was partially designed by a former nati
[2:02:29.280 --> 2:02:33.120]  so here you had this critical time period where the future of europe and the
[2:02:33.120 --> 2:02:35.760]  world could change and what did the big tech do
[2:02:35.760 --> 2:02:38.880]  they deliberately uh and intentionally meddled in the election
[2:02:38.880 --> 2:02:42.240]  by targeting people so that people wouldn't see their messages
[2:02:42.240 --> 2:02:45.600]  people wouldn't hear their messages uh such that people if they did see or
[2:02:45.600 --> 2:02:48.560]  hear their messages they saw or heard them in a negative light
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:51.360]  just as sort of you were the tip of the spear for what they're doing in the
[2:02:51.360 --> 2:02:54.080]  united states and in large parts of the world since
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:58.000]  info wars has a substantial following in canada and australia
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.640]  and the united kingdom where these elections would take in place
[2:03:00.640 --> 2:03:04.240]  part of it was removing the best anti-globalist advocates from the public
[2:03:04.240 --> 2:03:08.720]  sphere right during the critical election time period but despite that
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:13.040]  they're still losing everywhere what do you expect them to do now
[2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:16.960]  if they lose these elections which the numbers show they will
[2:03:16.960 --> 2:03:19.920]  i think what you're seeing the democratic house do so how did the
[2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:23.360]  democratic house respond to the president winning
[2:03:23.360 --> 2:03:26.480]  uh and even moeller having to admit he was completely innocent
[2:03:26.480 --> 2:03:29.680]  what they did was uh they decided to launch their own
[2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:33.680]  uh witch hunt of unparalleled and unprecedented scale for the purposes of
[2:03:33.680 --> 2:03:37.040]  personal embarrassment and attack so i think you're going to see the same
[2:03:37.040 --> 2:03:40.080]  thing happen across the world when they fail in these
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:42.720]  elections when the populace succeed in these elections
[2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:45.600]  you're going to see a wholesale onslaught you're already seeing it
[2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:48.480]  someone in the united kingdom in the united kingdom you have members of the
[2:03:48.480 --> 2:03:52.800]  press and big corporations basically green lighting encouraging
[2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:55.600]  joking about physical assaults and attacks on
[2:03:55.600 --> 2:04:00.000]  Nigel Farage they're now calling it milkshaking whereas someone's it's it's
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:03.360]  not going to stop there it's going to start by throwing things at people and
[2:04:03.360 --> 2:04:06.320]  then it's going to go to physical attacks on people and then it's going to be
[2:04:06.320 --> 2:04:11.040]  actually already bricks and acid attacks mainline news is saying throw
[2:04:11.040 --> 2:04:14.160]  acid on Nigel Farage don't they get if that actually
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:17.760]  happens in the green light is to kill a bunch of leftists i mean i don't
[2:04:17.760 --> 2:04:21.680]  it's it's crazy how they don't think two dimension only
[2:04:21.680 --> 2:04:25.440]  well i think to the degree they do they're trying to recreate the 1930s
[2:04:25.440 --> 2:04:29.760]  in the 1930s the communists were very successful at getting people to become
[2:04:29.760 --> 2:04:33.360]  violent in the street and counter to it and what it did is it gave rise to
[2:04:33.360 --> 2:04:36.640]  fascism and gave rise to other dynamics
[2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:39.920]  all right robert barnes is our guest one more segment i'm going to shift
[2:04:39.920 --> 2:04:43.360]  gears into courts telling us we can't talk

[2:05:52.880 --> 2:05:56.400]  websites just go there
[2:06:00.320 --> 2:06:06.400]  you are listening to an info wars dot com front line report
[2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:18.400]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:06:18.400 --> 2:06:21.760]  from deep in the heart of fema region six
[2:06:21.760 --> 2:06:29.440]  austin texas transmitting worldwide it's alex jones all right it was probably
[2:06:29.440 --> 2:06:33.360]  four or five six months ago we first had barns on know who was for years on the
[2:06:33.360 --> 2:06:37.440]  news they said watch avanadi he's a corrupt
[2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:41.760]  lawyer he's the front man for the democrats when he fails they'll flush him
[2:06:41.760 --> 2:06:45.120]  like you know what well now he got indicted again
[2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:48.960]  just want to spend a few minutes on him because he's archetypal
[2:06:48.960 --> 2:06:53.440]  for the democrats build up these people as invincible he's got to be president
[2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:57.280]  he's god he's a lord and savior you can't stop him
[2:06:57.280 --> 2:07:02.320]  everything he says is true and then now he's getting indicted and sued
[2:07:02.320 --> 2:07:08.480]  uh it just shows how the democrats put on a good con game but that's it
[2:07:08.480 --> 2:07:11.840]  oh no doubt about it here you have sort of a penultimate example of the
[2:07:11.840 --> 2:07:15.680]  politically motivated democratic warrior and they're people that are
[2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:18.960]  ethically challenged people that are morally conflicted
[2:07:18.960 --> 2:07:22.000]  people that rarely are clean or honest in their background
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:26.240]  so as soon as avanadi came to fame i started putting out public information
[2:07:26.240 --> 2:07:30.320]  that this was a very dangerous threat to the ordinary individual and client
[2:07:30.320 --> 2:07:33.520]  to his own clients not just to other people in parties
[2:07:33.520 --> 2:07:37.920]  and said so broadly said so in a wide scale talked to various government
[2:07:37.920 --> 2:07:41.040]  officials and others and said this man is a unique level of threat
[2:07:41.040 --> 2:07:45.600]  and here you had cnn msnbc the new york times
[2:07:45.600 --> 2:07:49.920]  washington post all these major publications giving him literally
[2:07:49.920 --> 2:07:53.360]  hundreds of millions of dollars in free air time
[2:07:53.360 --> 2:07:57.200]  promoting him as a democratic candidate for the presidency of the united states
[2:07:57.200 --> 2:08:01.680]  brian stelter was just mumbling and it was just
[2:08:01.680 --> 2:08:05.600]  sort of foaming at the mouth talking about how wonderful avanadi was
[2:08:05.600 --> 2:08:09.520]  it was just absurd and ludicrous because of it a whole bunch of people hired
[2:08:09.520 --> 2:08:13.360]  avanadi who never should his background i knew i was aware of him in l.a.
[2:08:13.360 --> 2:08:16.960]  and orange county that's where he's from he overlapped with some clients there
[2:08:16.960 --> 2:08:20.720]  are people that have fired him and hired me so i was aware of his background and
[2:08:20.720 --> 2:08:24.640]  had said this guy's basically he's a fraudster he's a cheat he's an evader
[2:08:24.640 --> 2:08:27.920]  he's disloyal and dishonest he's dishonorable and what i publicly
[2:08:27.920 --> 2:08:31.440]  predicted about a year ago and then predicted right here on info wars
[2:08:31.440 --> 2:08:34.000]  was that he would be that he would be in prison
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:37.040]  long before while president trump was still in office
[2:08:37.040 --> 2:08:40.720]  while the media was predicting the opposite so the effect of it here's what
[2:08:40.720 --> 2:08:43.760]  he's been indicted for he's been indicted for attempting to extort
[2:08:43.760 --> 2:08:46.800]  nike he's been indicted by the way he did that through
[2:08:46.800 --> 2:08:50.000]  twitter he used his twitter account to engage in the extortion
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:53.840]  so here twitter is so concerned about bad actions and bad activities
[2:08:53.840 --> 2:08:57.360]  and yet they they completely ban you without really any explanation or
[2:08:57.360 --> 2:09:00.800]  meaning whatsoever uh while michael avanadi a criminal who
[2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:04.480]  used their services to engage in criminal extortion according to the united
[2:09:04.480 --> 2:09:07.920]  states government the southern district of new york a grand jury
[2:09:07.920 --> 2:09:10.800]  in the southern district of new york uh there's been no action on his account
[2:09:10.800 --> 2:09:13.040]  whatsoever but then it was not only that he's
[2:09:13.040 --> 2:09:17.440]  subsequently been indicted for a bunch for a defraudian disabled man
[2:09:17.440 --> 2:09:21.840]  who he kept telling him that in fact the uh his money his settlement hadn't come
[2:09:21.840 --> 2:09:24.560]  in yet but he was going to lend him money out of his own pocket
[2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:27.920]  while he was actually using the actual settlement proceeds from his own
[2:09:27.920 --> 2:09:32.800]  disabled client to buy a private plane and to fly private planes and and pay
[2:09:32.800 --> 2:09:36.400]  for his Ferrari payments uh then on top of that
[2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:39.520]  he was defrauding a wide range of other clients business partners
[2:09:39.520 --> 2:09:42.880]  employees he fired a woman because she was pregnant
[2:09:42.880 --> 2:09:46.960]  she sued him she got a judgment against him he refused to pay it defrauded her
[2:09:46.960 --> 2:09:51.440]  he defrauded uh various employees he was taking employees payroll taxes and
[2:09:51.440 --> 2:09:54.640]  pocketing it instead taking it employees work
[2:09:54.640 --> 2:09:57.200]  workman's comp payments and pocketing it instead
[2:09:57.200 --> 2:10:01.600]  taking employers employee his own employees it'll take hours to go over it
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:04.720]  but but you were calling him out you said over a year ago here on the air
[2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:08.000]  predicting it why would the democrats choose him
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  as their god they just keep doing this it's it's
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:15.920]  because he's conflicted because he's corrupted the problem with an honest
[2:10:15.920 --> 2:10:19.840]  lawyer for the democratic party is it runs a risk that they will
[2:10:19.840 --> 2:10:23.360]  refuse that he that he or she will refuse to do their bidding when the
[2:10:23.360 --> 2:10:25.760]  time comes i call it the snowden problem in
[2:10:25.760 --> 2:10:28.240]  other words if you have someone with an independent conscience who will act on
[2:10:28.240 --> 2:10:30.560]  that independent conscience when they see illegality
[2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:33.680]  even if done on behalf of their own favorite political party
[2:10:33.680 --> 2:10:36.720]  then the you can't have that person in a position of power
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:41.600]  so the reason why they prefer a guy like avanadi and large members of the press
[2:10:41.600 --> 2:10:44.960]  said avanadi was a better lawyer than alan dirshowitz that shows you what a
[2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:49.120]  joke the press is so here you have the press promoting avanadi over dirshowitz
[2:10:49.120 --> 2:10:52.560]  why because he's corrupted because he's conflicted
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:57.520]  here's a guy who stormy daniels uh uh the most recent indictment is that of
[2:10:57.520 --> 2:11:00.480]  course he stole stormy daniels book proceeds and other proceeds
[2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:04.320]  i mean that's what this guy is so the uh he was such a it's the reason why
[2:11:04.320 --> 2:11:07.760]  socialism often doesn't work it's a problem of power not a problem
[2:11:07.760 --> 2:11:11.040]  necessarily of ideas the problem of power is that you put any
[2:11:11.040 --> 2:11:15.040]  certain person in power exactly you put people over the larger
[2:11:15.040 --> 2:11:18.320]  well of money and ideas they're going to steal it unless they're the ones that
[2:11:18.320 --> 2:11:21.520]  developed it and still they will too but somebody that just is put over it will
[2:11:21.520 --> 2:11:24.880]  certainly steal it so where do you predict he goes because
[2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:28.480]  they bring in these superstars they just hopefully forget about him
[2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:32.800]  absolutely i mean he currently faces 404 years in federal prison
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:35.840]  so my guess is that he ultimately cuts a deal
[2:11:35.840 --> 2:11:39.120]  and probably does it they're going to need him to do at least 10 years he'll be
[2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:42.400]  disbarred or if they give up all his money he'll be back begging on the
[2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:46.160]  street someplace uh maybe he'll work side by side with stormy daniels and
[2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:49.680]  various clubs sure i just see it as emblematic about everything the left
[2:11:49.680 --> 2:11:53.360]  does like muller or like the covington kids or like
[2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:57.040]  small it it's it's all just empty speaking of the devil here is
[2:11:57.040 --> 2:12:04.240]  the view just literally a few months ago worshiping avanadi here it is
[2:12:04.240 --> 2:12:07.520]  lately to me you're like the holy spirit you are
[2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:13.600]  all places at all times right i mean you i do i see you all over cable news i see
[2:12:13.600 --> 2:12:17.680]  you you know there is a a a seat available if you want to be a co-host at
[2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:20.960]  the veal you might you know people here you can pitch
[2:12:20.960 --> 2:12:24.720]  he'd make a great lady around the table no but um
[2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:27.840]  so and i say and i have the same issue with juliani he's
[2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:31.200]  everywhere i got and so i i questioned myself when i see juliani was like i see
[2:12:31.200 --> 2:12:34.080]  you on tv so much when do you have time to be
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:36.960]  lawyering to be doing like real lawyering because you're i mean you're
[2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:41.200]  representing you know might as you represent he has a great bigger calling
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:44.480]  here that being a lawyer is minimal compared to what he's doing
[2:12:44.480 --> 2:12:48.160]  the priest heard what whatever he's out there saving the country you know what
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:52.000]  i'm i'm very fortunate in that i'm surrounded by a staff and other very
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:55.760]  qualified attorneys and people that support me and that are doing great
[2:12:55.760 --> 2:12:59.280]  work uh relating to our cases and the work that we've done and
[2:12:59.280 --> 2:13:02.560]  and look we've published a lot of our filings in the case
[2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:05.760]  people can look at the quality of the work that we've done from a legal basis
[2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:09.120]  and this is a two-pronged fight let's be clear about this this is a fight
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:12.240]  not only in a court of law but also in the court of public opinion
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:15.600]  and the amount of media attention that we have received and the amount of media
[2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:19.920]  appearances that i've made has actually benefited my client stormy daniels
[2:13:19.920 --> 2:13:22.720]  and that's enough i can't watch any more of it so here's this
[2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:26.560]  literal vampire but what is it with leftist that they don't know they're
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:31.120]  going to get busted like just this instinct to crime crime crime what is
[2:13:31.120 --> 2:13:34.480]  that it's a i i think that deep into reflect
[2:13:34.480 --> 2:13:37.760]  reflection and a projection on the core personality of a lot of democratic
[2:13:37.760 --> 2:13:40.240]  politicians that fundamentally they're corrupt
[2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:43.120]  that fundamentally they know they're they're hypocrites that fundamentally
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:46.400]  they're deceitful that what they what i've not he was is he personified the
[2:13:46.400 --> 2:13:50.160]  modern-day democratic party it guised itself as the holy spirit
[2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:53.920]  it guised itself as professional operations and intelligence
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:57.360]  when in fact it was nothing more than a cheap huxter a bad hustler
[2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:01.520]  a pimp out there prostituting false lies against innocent people
[2:14:01.520 --> 2:14:05.760]  in order for their own riches and fame and that that core they're corrupt at
[2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:08.800]  core all they really care about is power they say they care about the
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:12.080]  empire well do you want to tell me what you told me privately six months ago i
[2:14:12.080 --> 2:14:15.200]  mean i'm not going to get into private conversations but you just basically
[2:14:15.200 --> 2:14:18.560]  said what his business was and who others businesses were and they're like you've
[2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:22.000]  been up against him and then and that's why you couldn't stand him
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:25.520]  oh no question i mean this was someone who posed an imminent threat a clear and
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:28.640]  present danger to ordinary people who who would entrust
[2:14:28.640 --> 2:14:32.720]  him with their legal affairs and it's it's like trusting the government with
[2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:36.320]  the democratic power with it at core they'll say that what they're doing is
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:40.160]  for some great righteous cause for some some great just purpose when in fact
[2:14:40.160 --> 2:14:43.680]  it's just a power grab so it like a lot of these lawsuits
[2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:46.960]  that are out there that they claim well we want to protect people and so for
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:50.640]  when really they just want to power grab against the dissident voices they dislike
[2:14:50.640 --> 2:14:54.000]  so that's all abinadi was abinadi was a power grab
[2:14:54.000 --> 2:14:58.800]  to allow the democratic party to defame the president to slander and smear him
[2:14:58.800 --> 2:15:02.960]  based on the allegations of a liar and a liar's liar and the lawyer
[2:15:02.960 --> 2:15:05.920]  and what he reflects and represents and personifies
[2:15:05.920 --> 2:15:09.520]  is how the democratic party currently operates which in the name of justice
[2:15:09.520 --> 2:15:12.640]  and the name of righteousness and the name of the good cause they actually
[2:15:12.640 --> 2:15:15.280]  just seek power for its own sake and for their own sake
[2:15:15.280 --> 2:15:19.120]  and that's why corruption set the core the center the heart and the soul
[2:15:19.120 --> 2:15:22.720]  of the modern day left and why they approach things and you can never trust
[2:15:22.720 --> 2:15:25.040]  that their objectives are what they say they are
[2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:28.880]  all right robert barnes i said i was happy for an hour now it's an hour and 15 minutes but we did

[2:20:15.840 --> 2:20:19.040]  constitutional lawyer robert barnes is our guest
[2:20:19.040 --> 2:20:24.240]  we've covered the waterfront here but the story up on info wars.com
[2:20:24.240 --> 2:20:28.000]  people say hey stand up for the kids hey you know cover well we have
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:31.600]  kids from new mexico california michigan texas
[2:20:31.600 --> 2:20:35.520]  we have fathers on mainly where it'll be the little boy usually
[2:20:35.520 --> 2:20:39.040]  sometimes little girl and the school convinces them hey you're really a boy
[2:20:39.040 --> 2:20:43.120]  or girl so at age eight they start giving them
[2:20:43.120 --> 2:20:46.320]  chemicals that stuck their growth cause all sorts of health
[2:20:46.320 --> 2:20:53.040]  problems but try to change their hormones from a girl to a boy or girl to a boy
[2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:57.760]  and now we we we covered one of the cases in canada
[2:20:57.760 --> 2:21:01.280]  where the father didn't want this to happen
[2:21:01.280 --> 2:21:04.240]  and i saw that the court was trying to say you couldn't even report on it
[2:21:04.240 --> 2:21:09.280]  basically we got these letters from them saying we couldn't link to a public
[2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:14.800]  file on a previous court ruling. Canadian court tries to stop alex
[2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:18.880]  jones from covering trans child case
[2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:22.800]  case transitions from battle over parental rights to free speech
[2:21:22.800 --> 2:21:27.280]  it's up on info wars.com if you care about these kids and care about what
[2:21:27.280 --> 2:21:30.160]  we're facing to tell you what's happening please make it
[2:21:30.160 --> 2:21:33.840]  matter and spread the article robert barnes you you've looked
[2:21:33.840 --> 2:21:37.280]  into this for us as your lawyer also for info wars
[2:21:37.280 --> 2:21:42.160]  what do you what do you make of this it's extraordinary and it's also
[2:21:42.160 --> 2:21:46.640]  frightening the scope and the scale of it because what you're talking about is
[2:21:46.640 --> 2:21:50.880]  what first you have a court overruling a parent
[2:21:50.880 --> 2:21:54.000]  about their own guidance for their own child
[2:21:54.000 --> 2:21:58.800]  which can have a lot life-lasting effects on the psychology and biology of
[2:21:58.800 --> 2:22:02.880]  the child. Second you have a court banning him
[2:22:02.880 --> 2:22:07.520]  the parent from publicly talking about public actions of public officials
[2:22:07.520 --> 2:22:10.960]  including government officials the court officials and health officials
[2:22:10.960 --> 2:22:15.440]  and then they took it a third step and said no one can discuss the name or
[2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:18.160]  identity of any of the public officials involved
[2:22:18.160 --> 2:22:21.680]  on the health side of the equation so it's an extraordinarily
[2:22:21.680 --> 2:22:24.560]  it's an order that would be completely unconstitutional and all
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:28.400]  likelihood in the united states but canada like Europe like rest most of
[2:22:28.400 --> 2:22:31.200]  the rest of the world doesn't have the same first amendment
[2:22:31.200 --> 2:22:35.280]  protections that the United States does so the
[2:22:35.280 --> 2:22:38.320]  that's why they can get away with it there in a way they probably could not
[2:22:38.320 --> 2:22:41.520]  get away with it here but still it's frightening and
[2:22:41.520 --> 2:22:45.920]  and what it reveals is the court recognizes and the court realizes
[2:22:45.920 --> 2:22:50.560]  that in fact this is unpopular opinion this is not an opinion supported by the
[2:22:50.560 --> 2:22:53.200]  public will and so they they know they would lose
[2:22:53.200 --> 2:22:57.120]  in the court of public opinion so they use a pretext and their pretext is an
[2:22:57.120 --> 2:23:01.680]  intriguing one it says if public opinion
[2:23:01.680 --> 2:23:06.000]  corresponds to doesn't necessarily cause but corresponds to
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:10.480]  people making any kind of threat of any kind even if it's anonymous and unrelated
[2:23:10.480 --> 2:23:13.920]  and could be by someone it's a self-serving anonymous threat
[2:23:13.920 --> 2:23:17.920]  against the any of the individuals on the other side of the aisle in the case
[2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:21.440]  that that's an excuse to completely silence public debate and discussion
[2:23:21.440 --> 2:23:24.880]  about it so if you want to win any court case where you're in my view abusing a
[2:23:24.880 --> 2:23:27.840]  child ruining their life you just small it and put a
[2:23:27.840 --> 2:23:31.360]  threat in against yourself exactly that's all you got to do now
[2:23:31.360 --> 2:23:33.520]  because all you get and then you'll run to the court and the court will say
[2:23:33.520 --> 2:23:37.360]  nobody can talk about this and i mean there's a core problem
[2:23:37.360 --> 2:23:41.680]  with causation with assuming or asserting causation connected to
[2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:45.920]  public tragedies and travesties or even the threats of action which happen all
[2:23:45.920 --> 2:23:49.200]  the time and the actions of other officials
[2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:53.120]  and the covington case i was attacked after i was attacked
[2:23:53.120 --> 2:23:56.000]  by a lot you know by institutional members of the press and others
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:24:00.400]  the my law offices were threatened with a such a viable bomb threat
[2:24:00.400 --> 2:24:03.520]  that the federal bureau of investigation had to launch an open inquiry
[2:24:03.520 --> 2:24:06.640]  what i did not do is go around and say everybody that's been critical of me
[2:24:06.640 --> 2:24:10.080]  can no longer be critical of me because it because of this fact
[2:24:10.080 --> 2:24:12.800]  that's just the reality of the world in which we live and we shouldn't
[2:24:12.800 --> 2:24:16.000]  correlate or cause a have causation between the two
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:19.600]  and then we should never use somebody else's wayward action
[2:24:19.600 --> 2:24:23.360]  as an excuse to suppress and censor and not just here
[2:24:23.360 --> 2:24:27.040]  but all over the world it is the same thing i won't give the particulars we
[2:24:27.040 --> 2:24:29.920]  don't have time not because we've been threatened
[2:24:29.920 --> 2:24:33.600]  you know with legal action but there are public lawyers that go around attack
[2:24:33.600 --> 2:24:36.000]  you and me all day on the biggest shows in the country
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:40.320]  and then if we respond back they freak out and run to court saying we should be
[2:24:40.320 --> 2:24:44.000]  silenced like this brewery that said don't hit people with milkshakes
[2:24:44.000 --> 2:24:46.880]  hit him in the head with bricks and somebody said man you're asking for
[2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:50.080]  trouble they went oh my god we're being threatened and called the police
[2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:54.160]  they're going out and saying assault people with deadly weapons we go hey
[2:24:54.160 --> 2:24:57.680]  that's pretty dangerous don't oh my god that's a threat i mean it's like
[2:24:57.680 --> 2:25:02.480]  cartoon how the left acts and their little sjw bubbles
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:05.680]  oh no doubt about it and it's just very dangerous i mean here you have an
[2:25:05.680 --> 2:25:08.880]  extraordinary ruling about something that is still
[2:25:08.880 --> 2:25:12.080]  hotly controverted and debated within both the
[2:25:12.080 --> 2:25:15.520]  even the liberal schools of psychology and biology
[2:25:15.520 --> 2:25:20.240]  and the medical profession about whether or not someone who's a 12 13 or 14
[2:25:20.240 --> 2:25:24.640]  can make a decision about their own gender whether or not if that's gender
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:27.920]  dysphoria or whether or not that's a uh a
[2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:31.600]  psychologically well-reasoned and healthy decision that's even within the
[2:25:31.600 --> 2:25:35.520]  liberal in the left fields of academia that's a controversial question yeah i
[2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:38.560]  mean let's be clear maybe one out of ten millions a real hemaphodite
[2:25:38.560 --> 2:25:41.600]  that person could argue they're one or the other fine we don't care
[2:25:41.600 --> 2:25:44.640]  just don't try to teach five-year-olds there's something else
[2:25:44.640 --> 2:25:48.720]  knowing that here forcing over the father's objection
[2:25:48.720 --> 2:25:52.480]  the child to undergo medical experimentation
[2:25:52.480 --> 2:25:56.720]  and biological alteration for a decision that someone at that age is
[2:25:56.720 --> 2:26:00.160]  unlikely to be able to meaningfully process this is school sponsored
[2:26:00.160 --> 2:26:04.560]  joseph mingle a level experimentation but as long as you say it's liberal it's
[2:26:04.560 --> 2:26:07.200]  okay exactly and then you get a bunch of a
[2:26:07.200 --> 2:26:11.520]  couple of leftist doctors who have their own opinions about the field
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:14.880]  injecting their own political biases into the process
[2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:18.160]  and that was what was being publicly discussed and that is what the court the
[2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:22.800]  canadian court said these people cannot be discussed and what about what about
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:26.720]  extra judicial here is that the term extra uh you know border
[2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:30.400]  uh i mean what's the term outside of their own jurisdiction
[2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:34.400]  extra uh jurisdiction only what's the term that they're not telling me what i
[2:26:34.400 --> 2:26:38.640]  can say in texas it's extra jurisdictional uh it's
[2:26:38.640 --> 2:26:42.320]  also uh it's it's basically a prior restraint
[2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:46.720]  so in the u.s prior restraints on speech are almost completely prohibited
[2:26:46.720 --> 2:26:50.720]  uh it's just very rare that you can do any form of prior restraint on speech
[2:26:50.720 --> 2:26:54.480]  and that's why this order is likely not effective in the united states
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:59.120]  uh and the but it is effective in canada and there's a substantial info wars
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:02.000]  audience in canada and so what they effectively did
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:05.600]  is prevent the info wars audience and any other audience in canada
[2:27:05.600 --> 2:27:09.200]  from hearing from the father from hearing about the individuals involved
[2:27:09.200 --> 2:27:12.640]  and whether they were tainted by political bias because i mean as a
[2:27:12.640 --> 2:27:15.120]  general rule if you're a medical professional you get involved in a
[2:27:15.120 --> 2:27:18.400]  public proceeding you've already been named in that public proceeding
[2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:22.000]  you say that your opinion was warranted by science and had no inflection look
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:26.080]  when you're sterilizing kids in the name of transgenderism
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:30.640]  you better be ready to be in public exactly be ready if you're right then
[2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:34.320]  you can defend yourself because what you've done is shocking to many people
[2:27:34.320 --> 2:27:37.920]  you've overridden a father you you're making a decision that can alter the
[2:27:37.920 --> 2:27:42.720]  child's biology and psychology for life when he is he is still a child and by
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:46.000]  law is not considered competent to make decisions of that kind and caliber
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:49.680]  for himself you believe you're right it's controversial even in your field
[2:27:49.680 --> 2:27:53.520]  amongst fellow leftists so you better be ready and able to defend it
[2:27:53.520 --> 2:27:56.640]  and rather than defend your opinion the very first thing you do is you run to
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:28:00.640]  court and tell the court you need a special safe space where you can't be
[2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:04.800]  publicly criticized or questioned or investigated for what you did and why
[2:28:04.800 --> 2:28:07.440]  you did it uh and you're immune from public
[2:28:07.440 --> 2:28:10.960]  criticism for a decision that the public is deeply curious about that's right
[2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:14.320]  when you're sterilizing kids because that's the end game of this
[2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:17.120]  that's the end result and just biologically you better be ready for
[2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:19.760]  scrutiny Robert Barnes I just just popped my head

[2:31:59.840 --> 2:32:04.320]  and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up
[2:32:04.320 --> 2:32:09.040]  with human waste and debris this is from people flushing things that aren't
[2:32:09.040 --> 2:32:12.960]  meant to be flushed like baby wipes and feminine
[2:32:12.960 --> 2:32:16.480]  products and safe sex products and so this is
[2:32:16.480 --> 2:32:20.560]  resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged

[2:33:27.680 --> 2:33:35.200]  so i came here to do a meeting on infrastructure with democrats
[2:33:35.200 --> 2:33:38.400]  not really thinking they wanted to do infrastructure or anything else
[2:33:38.400 --> 2:33:41.920]  other than investigate and i just saw that
[2:33:41.920 --> 2:33:45.840]  Nancy Pelosi just before our meeting made a statement that we believe that the
[2:33:45.840 --> 2:33:50.640]  president of the united states is engaged in a cover-up
[2:33:50.640 --> 2:33:54.160]  well it turns out i'm the most and i think most of you would
[2:33:54.160 --> 2:33:59.040]  agree to this i'm the most transparent president probably in the history of
[2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:03.840]  this country we have given on a witch hunt or a
[2:34:03.840 --> 2:34:08.320]  hoax the whole thing with russia was a hoax
[2:34:08.320 --> 2:34:11.760]  as it relates to the trump administration and myself
[2:34:11.760 --> 2:34:16.960]  it was a total horrible thing that happened to our country
[2:34:16.960 --> 2:34:21.440]  it hurt us in so many ways despite that we're setting records with
[2:34:21.440 --> 2:34:25.840]  the economy with jobs with the most of people most people employed today that
[2:34:25.840 --> 2:34:28.960]  we've ever had in the history of our country
[2:34:28.960 --> 2:34:32.400]  we have the best unemployment numbers that we've had
[2:34:32.400 --> 2:34:36.800]  in the history of our country in some cases 51 years but generally in the
[2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:41.600]  history of our country companies are moving back in
[2:34:41.600 --> 2:34:44.880]  things are going well and i said let's have the meeting on infrastructure
[2:34:44.880 --> 2:34:48.400]  we'll get that done easily that's one of the easy ones
[2:34:48.400 --> 2:34:53.040]  and instead of walking in happily into a meeting
[2:34:53.040 --> 2:34:56.960]  i walk in to look at people that had just said
[2:34:56.960 --> 2:35:00.960]  that i was doing a cover-up i don't do cover-ups
[2:35:00.960 --> 2:35:05.200]  you people know that probably better than anybody
[2:35:05.840 --> 2:35:09.600]  millie weaver's riding shotgun with us i'm your host alex jones we have matt
[2:35:09.600 --> 2:35:13.280]  brackett coming up the fourth hour of the war with those sure after that
[2:35:13.280 --> 2:35:16.480]  millie so much breaking so much unfolding you've been on the campaign
[2:35:16.480 --> 2:35:19.520]  trail you've been following democrats and republicans you
[2:35:19.520 --> 2:35:22.720]  you don't edit these videos other than cutting the spaces out
[2:35:22.720 --> 2:35:26.560]  what i'd say 95 percent of democrats act like even possessed
[2:35:26.560 --> 2:35:31.360]  goblin creatures oh yeah i mean they can't answer questions and that's why you
[2:35:31.360 --> 2:35:35.440]  have so many of them going and trying to tell other people oh don't talk to them
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:39.520]  don't talk to info wars because as soon as you question them
[2:35:39.520 --> 2:35:43.200]  all of everything falls through because they can't logically defend their
[2:35:43.200 --> 2:35:46.480]  point they always say you're not supposed to be here whether you're at the
[2:35:46.480 --> 2:35:51.040]  capitol in texas or whatever you need to shut up like get out of here
[2:35:51.040 --> 2:35:54.320]  get the hell out of here you're not supposed to be here
[2:35:54.320 --> 2:35:57.920]  yeah they tell us that we need to shut up they think everything's a university
[2:35:57.920 --> 2:36:02.160]  they always go police arrest her oh yeah they'll say arrest her get her out of
[2:36:02.160 --> 2:36:06.720]  here i want to shut up here i want them silent i want to mute it
[2:36:06.720 --> 2:36:12.400]  exactly and they have big signs that told men to shut the f up at their
[2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:15.280]  protest in austin in austin yeah days ago
[2:36:15.280 --> 2:36:18.800]  yes they were telling men they shouldn't have a say but then when you ask them
[2:36:18.800 --> 2:36:22.880]  well doesn't it require a man to make a baby
[2:36:22.880 --> 2:36:27.920]  so shouldn't they have a say given that it takes two to reproduce to me i don't
[2:36:27.920 --> 2:36:31.200]  even get this thing where like men and women or even at odds with each other
[2:36:31.200 --> 2:36:34.800]  it's it's it's crazy how they've gotten this point of course
[2:36:34.800 --> 2:36:38.320]  mainly most these women that are all obsessed with you know they say i'm a
[2:36:38.320 --> 2:36:42.160]  slut i'm let's face it no man's ever wanted them
[2:36:42.160 --> 2:36:45.680]  studies are out like conservative women are better looking more successful more
[2:36:45.680 --> 2:36:47.760]  happy you know it's kind of interesting most of
[2:36:47.760 --> 2:36:51.760]  women that were out there were like a bunch of old cat ladies that look like
[2:36:51.760 --> 2:36:55.280]  they've already been through menopause so it's kind of like you probably can't
[2:36:55.280 --> 2:36:58.800]  even get pregnant so no no but exactly that's the point
[2:36:58.800 --> 2:37:03.200]  is they're miserable they never had a man and they're pissed
[2:37:03.200 --> 2:37:07.600]  yeah i mean they think that men are trying to somehow hold them down
[2:37:07.600 --> 2:37:11.440]  and that being a woman and being a mother and embracing
[2:37:11.440 --> 2:37:15.680]  maternity is somehow weak for women to do that when it's actually one of the
[2:37:15.680 --> 2:37:19.440]  hardest things you can do it's very hard to be a mom
[2:37:19.440 --> 2:37:23.280]  and do it like a boss and those women that do it should be
[2:37:23.280 --> 2:37:27.440]  celebrated and these women just want to essentially
[2:37:27.440 --> 2:37:31.600]  deny the fact that the babies living within their wombs
[2:37:31.600 --> 2:37:34.880]  have rights and that they are human beings
[2:37:34.880 --> 2:37:38.080]  yeah these are human beings and now all the textbooks are
[2:37:38.080 --> 2:37:42.000]  they're a cancer they're a blob and all these left to shows like top crap about
[2:37:42.000 --> 2:37:45.600]  the baby and then now they're like oh let's kill babies after they're born
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:50.640]  you know a woman tried to compare babies in the womb to a microbe
[2:37:50.640 --> 2:37:54.160]  they tried to compare they try to they call it a parasite they call it an
[2:37:54.160 --> 2:37:56.560]  invading force yeah they do anything they can
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:38:00.640]  no your whole body's built with ovaries that it releases
[2:38:00.640 --> 2:38:04.000]  it's like saying a flower with another flower making seeds as a
[2:38:04.000 --> 2:38:09.200]  cancer no you are designed for it you have it these two things combined make a
[2:38:09.200 --> 2:38:12.400]  new creature that grows in you that's magic that's beautiful
[2:38:12.400 --> 2:38:15.760]  but they turn into something ugly you know when i ask them
[2:38:15.760 --> 2:38:19.920]  should women be allowed to abort unborn babies in the womb
[2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:23.520]  they say what business is it of yours and i said to them
[2:38:23.520 --> 2:38:26.800]  i said that's probably what the german people said
[2:38:26.800 --> 2:38:30.960]  when the jewish people were being exterminated and killed in the
[2:38:30.960 --> 2:38:33.920]  concentration camps what business is it of yours
[2:38:33.920 --> 2:38:39.280]  america what business is it of yours other countries that don't like to see
[2:38:39.280 --> 2:38:42.400]  millions of people slaughtered see that's the thing millie
[2:38:42.400 --> 2:38:46.800]  the average leftist doesn't believe their leftist bleeding heart crap
[2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:50.960]  their sociopaths at best psychopaths at worse
[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:55.440]  who know we have a conscience so they're constantly punching our conscience
[2:38:55.440 --> 2:39:00.080]  buttons to get us to give them money and power
[2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:03.360]  that's all they want i was watching last night i woke up at 2 30 in the morning
[2:39:03.360 --> 2:39:07.120]  couldn't sleep and for some reason then my news feed
[2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:13.440]  on my ipad uh was evergreen college in washington state in olympia
[2:39:13.440 --> 2:39:19.680]  and how uh people signing up to go to the college is down by 50 plus percent
[2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:24.000]  they've gone from 5 000 students down to 2 000 students and they're imploding so i
[2:39:24.000 --> 2:39:27.840]  watched for several hours before i went back to bed at like four
[2:39:27.840 --> 2:39:31.920]  the actual videos of the professors
[2:39:31.920 --> 2:39:36.800]  the black professors saying and i feel sorry most black folks aren't like this
[2:39:36.800 --> 2:39:41.200]  literally whites are inherently evil you are scum
[2:39:41.200 --> 2:39:45.120]  nothing but evil can come because you're white i want power
[2:39:45.120 --> 2:39:48.400]  i rule you and the woman starts literally going
[2:39:48.400 --> 2:39:55.360]  power power i am power i am power i am power power power power power
[2:39:55.360 --> 2:39:58.480]  and i was like watching hours of this and the white professors are actually
[2:39:58.480 --> 2:40:03.360]  bowing going yes yes yes he goes get out of my way
[2:40:03.360 --> 2:40:07.040]  and it's like and like whites are evil get out of my but i guess
[2:40:07.040 --> 2:40:10.720]  lordship they fall down and anyone that didn't do it was like fired and
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:14.640]  i mean this is cuckoo land man this was hitlerian
[2:40:14.640 --> 2:40:19.200]  of course blacks can act like hitler anybody can if they take on that mindset
[2:40:19.200 --> 2:40:23.520]  and she was doing it this professor that led the whole thing they call her the
[2:40:23.520 --> 2:40:26.880]  red queen some of the alumni have done videos on her
[2:40:26.880 --> 2:40:30.880]  exactly the problem is alex they're doing exactly what the nazis did
[2:40:30.880 --> 2:40:34.720]  with the jewish people to white people today they're trying to make white people
[2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:39.200]  the scapegoat for all of the problems in the ethnic
[2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:41.840]  communities all the problems that black people
[2:40:41.840 --> 2:40:46.800]  mexican people face in america well now white people are the new scapegoats
[2:40:46.800 --> 2:40:51.920]  and that sets white people exactly i saw a headline on drudge
[2:40:51.920 --> 2:40:55.760]  today that people think they're getting was it lower grades
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:40:59.040]  or it was the craziest i forget all the headlines it's like
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:03.200]  they blame climate change for everything they were blaming white people now for
[2:41:03.200 --> 2:41:06.080]  climate change they have leftist studies coming out
[2:41:06.080 --> 2:41:09.920]  saying that white people white colonialization
[2:41:09.920 --> 2:41:14.560]  whiteness is causing climate change now let's go further than that because
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:16.880]  there's a few articles out today that are actually
[2:41:16.880 --> 2:41:21.280]  accurate from what i've seen the average white kid
[2:41:21.280 --> 2:41:24.720]  parents are guilty about being white all they've done is nice people their whole
[2:41:24.720 --> 2:41:28.720]  life they're doing howl hitlers and you know
[2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:32.880]  swastika signs and stuff as a joke because when you've done nothing wrong
[2:41:32.880 --> 2:41:35.840]  and you're being told you're an evil piece of crap
[2:41:35.840 --> 2:41:38.960]  well because you know the whole martin Luther king christian thing worked
[2:41:38.960 --> 2:41:42.080]  generations people were actually like let's come together what we really want
[2:41:42.080 --> 2:41:44.960]  that had gone back to the original martin luther not martin luther king
[2:41:44.960 --> 2:41:48.560]  jr and so the the system's crapping all over
[2:41:48.560 --> 2:41:52.480]  that but then the the the the evil shadow of this is
[2:41:52.480 --> 2:41:55.280]  when you tell whites they're inherently evil in class
[2:41:55.280 --> 2:41:58.800]  everywhere a lot of white folks who have been doing their lives
[2:41:58.800 --> 2:42:01.520]  they're going to say i'm not buying into this especially when they've got brain
[2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:04.480]  wash minorities telling them they're inherently bad
[2:42:04.480 --> 2:42:07.680]  they're going to say f you and then they're going to get into the racism
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:11.280]  yeah and i would say that trolling though and doing those
[2:42:11.280 --> 2:42:14.160]  sig hails and whatnot out of frustration is definitely oh they're
[2:42:14.160 --> 2:42:17.040]  definitely trolling they're definitely trolling it's not a good idea to do it
[2:42:17.040 --> 2:42:19.600]  though because the problem is is that the less
[2:42:19.600 --> 2:42:24.000]  brainwashing and propaganda is so strong it just creates more
[2:42:24.000 --> 2:42:26.960]  ambiance for these brainwashed leftists that we need to
[2:42:26.960 --> 2:42:29.840]  wake up and i agree but then what do you do when
[2:42:29.840 --> 2:42:32.400]  they're telling everybody inherently whites are bad people put up it's okay
[2:42:32.400 --> 2:42:36.480]  to be white signs and the media freaks out even more i mean
[2:42:36.480 --> 2:42:41.120]  and then they now say that's racist no it's racist to say white people are bad
[2:42:41.120 --> 2:42:43.840]  and by the way if whites are so bad i'm gonna say it again
[2:42:43.840 --> 2:42:47.920]  why is everybody trying to get into a white country because they're christian
[2:42:47.920 --> 2:42:51.600]  folks they're christian it's christianity
[2:42:51.600 --> 2:42:55.280]  they've got studies in africa one tribe versus the next

[2:47:09.680 --> 2:47:16.160]  all across europe australia new zealand the u.s canada anyone posting it's
[2:47:16.160 --> 2:47:20.000]  okay to be white shine is called a racist
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:25.680]  even when you post it's okay to be black next to it this is the brainwashing
[2:47:25.680 --> 2:47:28.320]  but i personally have your team of you ever can see this
[2:47:28.320 --> 2:47:32.560]  racist piece of paper i have it's white itself it's not okay to be a white

[2:47:35.520 --> 2:47:40.960]  invisible ink so if i'm offended by this it should be banned like the
[2:47:40.960 --> 2:47:45.360]  okay symbol that's the new system of human discovery
[2:47:45.360 --> 2:47:50.000]  discovering what offends you and having it banned
[2:47:50.000 --> 2:47:54.000]  here's a compilation of local newscasts flipping out
[2:47:54.000 --> 2:47:57.360]  and saying that they are offended by it's okay to be white
[2:47:57.360 --> 2:48:02.000]  because the colleges are teaching white people are bad here it is
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:05.360]  thousands of flyers like this one are popping up on the university of idaho's
[2:48:05.360 --> 2:48:08.080]  campus the school's president chuck stabin says
[2:48:08.080 --> 2:48:12.160]  the slogan it's okay to be white is associated with white supremacists and
[2:48:12.160 --> 2:48:15.680]  neo-nazi groups a florida golf course university student
[2:48:15.680 --> 2:48:19.040]  admitted to hanging these flyers on campus they say
[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:23.280]  it's okay to be white 19-year-old griffin baker royo said he put up the
[2:48:23.280 --> 2:48:27.920]  signs to protest a new class on campus called white racism
[2:48:27.920 --> 2:48:31.760]  well griffin baker royo is still awaiting tonight to hear if he'll be
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:36.320]  supposed you're not by the university back it up 10 seconds
[2:48:36.320 --> 2:48:40.720]  the classes about white racism when all humans could be tribal
[2:48:40.720 --> 2:48:43.920]  and if we're going to try to work together with an ethos of a belief system
[2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:48.160]  what is that belief system well the left two belief system is whites are evil
[2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:53.600]  america sucks and even yonker the dictator that you use says
[2:48:53.600 --> 2:48:57.520]  countries suck europeans suck you're all stupid
[2:48:57.520 --> 2:49:01.440]  oh yeah i mean they seriously want to demonize white people it's ridiculous
[2:49:01.440 --> 2:49:04.720]  the whole race debate is ridiculous in this country
[2:49:04.720 --> 2:49:10.000]  because who's even really white like my skin color is beige you know i mean it's
[2:49:10.000 --> 2:49:12.960]  all a big joke it look like it's mental illness
[2:49:12.960 --> 2:49:17.680]  martin Luther king juniors turning in his grave here here's more of the newscast
[2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:21.680]  well griffin baker royo is still awaiting tonight to hear if he'll be
[2:49:21.680 --> 2:49:24.880]  punished or not by the university for putting up those posters
[2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:28.880]  that read it's okay to be white he hasn't been criminally charged
[2:49:28.880 --> 2:49:31.840]  but we do know that he's been referred to student affairs here at the
[2:49:31.840 --> 2:49:36.320]  university baker royo says we're not meant to be racist
[2:49:36.320 --> 2:49:40.240]  back at him again they always use european laws where they arrest you for
[2:49:40.240 --> 2:49:42.880]  this stuff to act like you'll be arrested here
[2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:46.160]  normalizing that will be arrested they're getting us ready
[2:49:46.160 --> 2:49:49.040]  by just hearing it in the court of public opinion millie
[2:49:49.040 --> 2:49:52.640]  yeah you know um they just want to normalize going after
[2:49:52.640 --> 2:49:56.720]  white people in general in this country and you know it's ridiculous that
[2:49:56.720 --> 2:50:00.320]  someone can't say that and somehow that's hate speech do you see how slippery
[2:50:00.320 --> 2:50:04.080]  the slope is with trying to demonize hate speech when you can't just say it's
[2:50:04.080 --> 2:50:07.200]  okay to be white which the funny thing about this whole white paper thing the
[2:50:07.200 --> 2:50:11.520]  whole joke is that the paper is white so it's like a
[2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:14.480]  paper that just says it's okay to be white and
[2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:18.480]  they're talking about the paper sure it's all semantical but but but
[2:50:18.480 --> 2:50:21.920]  millie spanning on this this is a divide and conquer stratagem
[2:50:21.920 --> 2:50:25.040]  where they put pressure on a group to then make them politically follow the
[2:50:25.040 --> 2:50:28.880]  orders they want that's terrorism this black professor i was
[2:50:28.880 --> 2:50:31.600]  watching uh that led the whole evergreen college thing
[2:50:31.600 --> 2:50:34.960]  that's killed their tuition over you have percent they're going they already
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:38.640]  have collapsed basically it's it's over and the left doubling down more as they
[2:50:38.640 --> 2:50:42.640]  as they circle the toilet bowl she said i don't have any power on black
[2:50:42.640 --> 2:50:46.800]  she's a professor she's ruined a university she's wrecking things she's
[2:50:46.800 --> 2:50:49.440]  causing a race war but she keeps saying yes i'm
[2:50:49.440 --> 2:50:53.520]  prejudiced she says i'm a racist on video i don't like whites
[2:50:53.520 --> 2:50:58.000]  but it's okay because i'm downtrodden now if she tried to go to african do that
[2:50:58.000 --> 2:51:01.840]  they'd you know she'd be gone she wouldn't anywhere else if they'd laugh
[2:51:01.840 --> 2:51:06.720]  at her she comes here does this hates everybody
[2:51:06.720 --> 2:51:10.560]  and then says she doesn't have power so she can be as mean as she wants
[2:51:10.560 --> 2:51:14.240]  it's a license to act like a thug here it is
[2:51:14.240 --> 2:51:17.360]  me and fgcu say they were offended by his act
[2:51:17.360 --> 2:51:21.760]  especially dr ted thornhill who teaches the white race especially
[2:51:21.760 --> 2:51:26.240]  he found one of the science on his especially the race pimp professor
[2:51:26.240 --> 2:51:30.720]  that runs the brainwashing system for the militant enthusiasm
[2:51:30.720 --> 2:51:38.640]  and for the whole social Darwinistic divide and conquer
[2:51:38.640 --> 2:51:46.320]  strategy of liberation theology continue this door i think is cowardly
[2:51:46.320 --> 2:51:51.520]  and uh unwanted it's it's a slogan that has been used by
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:54.320]  people like david duke you know a former wizard of the kukas
[2:51:54.320 --> 2:51:57.440]  pause again so you got this lady not even born here from other
[2:51:57.440 --> 2:52:00.720]  countries she wanted to get here so she could bitch is back it up 20 seconds
[2:52:00.720 --> 2:52:05.680]  please so she could get like david duke uses the term it's okay to be white
[2:52:05.680 --> 2:52:09.440]  never even heard that but if david duke eats chinese food is it banned too
[2:52:09.440 --> 2:52:15.680]  like sweden's banning runes that the original germanic language an alphabet
[2:52:15.680 --> 2:52:19.760]  because somebody might use it wrong this is a war on language
[2:52:19.760 --> 2:52:23.600]  by a bunch of chip on their shoulder third world populations
[2:52:23.600 --> 2:52:27.040]  brought in set up by the ford foundation
[2:52:27.040 --> 2:52:31.840]  to piss in everyone's face let's continue baker royo is still awaiting
[2:52:31.840 --> 2:52:35.360]  tonight to hear if he'll be punished or not by the university for putting up
[2:52:35.360 --> 2:52:39.200]  those posters that read it's okay to be white he hasn't been
[2:52:39.200 --> 2:52:41.760]  criminally charged but we do know that he's been
[2:52:41.760 --> 2:52:44.160]  referred to student affairs here at the university
[2:52:44.160 --> 2:52:47.600]  baker royo says his posters were not meant to be racist
[2:52:47.600 --> 2:52:51.120]  but many at fgcu say they were offended by his act
[2:52:51.120 --> 2:52:55.440]  especially dr ted thornhill who teaches the white racism classes
[2:52:55.440 --> 2:53:00.320]  he found one of the signs on his office door i think is cowardly
[2:53:00.320 --> 2:53:05.520]  and uh unwanted it's it's a slogan that has been used by
[2:53:05.520 --> 2:53:08.800]  people like david duke you know a former wizard of the kukas clan and he
[2:53:08.800 --> 2:53:13.040]  often sees it you could google this it takes less than five minutes to find
[2:53:13.040 --> 2:53:16.880]  to find out you know what i think people are protesting
[2:53:16.880 --> 2:53:21.360]  is the idea that adopting the messaging and the framing of people
[2:53:21.360 --> 2:53:25.360]  like this should never occur in our federal parliament
[2:53:25.360 --> 2:53:29.440]  so the idea that somehow white people are experiencing
[2:53:29.440 --> 2:53:34.160]  a level of racism that deserve to be condemned and recognized at the
[2:53:34.160 --> 2:53:38.480]  national parliament diminishes the real experiences of other people that
[2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:41.920]  experience day-to-day racism and then you know because
[2:53:41.920 --> 2:53:46.960]  lauren southern comes to stroller wearing a it's okay to be white shirt and
[2:53:46.960 --> 2:53:52.160]  people protested 29 senators goes and vote on a notion
[2:53:52.160 --> 2:53:55.920]  that it's okay to be white it's ridiculous it's ridiculous
[2:53:55.920 --> 2:53:59.360]  holding signs on this that's enough we're done with the report but i mean
[2:53:59.360 --> 2:54:02.480]  you've got this obviously my viewer racist woman
[2:54:02.480 --> 2:54:06.320]  chip on her shoulder wanted to get to the west as soon as she can
[2:54:06.320 --> 2:54:10.320]  to then come to civilization and say oh my god i hate you bow down to me i'm
[2:54:10.320 --> 2:54:14.000]  conquering you um which is why a lot of areas of
[2:54:14.000 --> 2:54:16.960]  the world can't get civilization because everyone's trying to conquer the next
[2:54:16.960 --> 2:54:20.720]  person and so she's here i rule you i conquer you
[2:54:20.720 --> 2:54:24.240]  you suck don't say you're all right you're bad i'm the victim
[2:54:24.240 --> 2:54:27.440]  i'm the god well then why don't you get the hell
[2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:31.200]  out of our country like the somali congresswoman
[2:54:31.200 --> 2:54:34.800]  that runs around saying america sucks all day why'd she marry her brother to
[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:38.080]  come here no we're nice so they use it against
[2:54:38.080 --> 2:54:41.760]  us and i'm done you know they're just trying to
[2:54:41.760 --> 2:54:45.760]  make it so that white people don't feel like they can defend themselves like
[2:54:45.760 --> 2:54:49.200]  it's wrong to say it's okay to be white but yet you can say it's okay to be
[2:54:49.200 --> 2:54:52.560]  black it's okay to be mexican which it is it's okay to be exactly because they
[2:54:52.560 --> 2:54:56.880]  run up and down the hallways preaching racism they're the racist the left is
[2:54:56.880 --> 2:55:00.320]  the one there they want to say we suck and we say no
[2:55:00.320 --> 2:55:04.560]  and they're getting upset well guess what we're gonna keep doing it
[2:55:04.560 --> 2:55:08.160]  and you know it's interesting i've never seen so much racial unity
[2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:12.160]  as i have recently oh when trump got elected it boosted the numbers way up
[2:55:12.160 --> 2:55:15.760]  he's incredibly popular the average black american just wants freedom
[2:55:15.760 --> 2:55:19.040]  who the hell wants all this who wants to send their kids to college
[2:55:19.040 --> 2:55:22.560]  and half the teaching isn't about math or accounting
[2:55:22.560 --> 2:55:26.240]  or history uh or science it's all about race war
[2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:30.800]  how does that help your your young person texas actually displayed so much
[2:55:30.800 --> 2:55:34.800]  racial unity alex at that maga beach bash it was insane
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:38.640]  you had hispanics blacks whites all together
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:42.400]  celebrating trump and america and they all loved each other and had so much
[2:55:42.400 --> 2:55:45.600]  that's what scares the left because that's all they've got
[2:55:45.600 --> 2:55:49.600]  they can't promote prosperity or free market or self-defense
[2:55:49.600 --> 2:55:53.680]  all they can promote is racial division exactly and that's why
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:57.600]  we the american people need to be united as ever and show that we
[2:55:57.600 --> 2:56:01.680]  we love each other who cares about your skin color and i agree but we have to
[2:56:01.680 --> 2:56:05.520]  stand up against the race peddling left exactly story up on info wars dot com by
[2:56:05.520 --> 2:56:09.760]  kello mcbreen breaking sealed court docs in a boarded
[2:56:09.760 --> 2:56:13.920]  schmollett case to be made public schmollett staged that but again
[2:56:13.920 --> 2:56:19.120]  the media said he was good to stage it so he doesn't get in trouble
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:23.120]  yeah what was interesting is actually at the maga beach bash i interviewed a
[2:56:23.120 --> 2:56:26.560]  bunch of african americans that were out there partying alongside these
[2:56:26.560 --> 2:56:30.320]  maga hat wearing trump supporters and guess what all of them said alex
[2:56:30.320 --> 2:56:34.240]  all of them said no i've had nothing but love and unity people have been
[2:56:34.240 --> 2:56:39.440]  smiling at us waving at us loving us we haven't had any racial instances so
[2:56:39.440 --> 2:56:43.280]  how can you have all these drunk inebriated maga people out there
[2:56:43.280 --> 2:56:47.120]  amongst all of these black americans and not one of these black americans that i
[2:56:47.120 --> 2:56:49.840]  talked to said they had any hate coming from the
[2:56:49.840 --> 2:56:52.720]  trump but that's because you're in texas if you go to
[2:56:52.720 --> 2:56:57.360]  baltimore or chicago the brainwashing is deep and folks have never been around
[2:56:57.360 --> 2:57:00.400]  white people in those areas they actually believe white people
[2:57:00.400 --> 2:57:04.320]  are all actually running around in kkk outfits i mean the people out here in
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:07.040]  texas the the maga hat wearing trump supporters
[2:57:07.040 --> 2:57:12.080]  were loving the black no no i i i know that the statistics show that racism's
[2:57:12.080 --> 2:57:15.840]  way down that's why the democrats are panicking
[2:57:15.840 --> 2:57:18.960]  exactly it if you want to see it for yourself
[2:57:18.960 --> 2:57:23.440]  go to any trump event and you see no i mean i i know the audience understands
[2:57:23.440 --> 2:57:26.000]  that we'll do five more minutes than matt braggins
[2:57:26.000 --> 2:57:30.480]  the matt braggins taking over watch this is about racist trump supporters
[2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:34.560]  millie weaver now up on info wars dot com and don't forget memorial day

[2:57:47.360 --> 2:57:50.400]  modern medicine introducing pollen block
[2:57:50.400 --> 2:57:54.560]  we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal
[2:57:54.560 --> 2:57:57.840]  distress symptoms including promoting clear nasal
[2:57:57.840 --> 2:58:02.400]  and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function
[2:58:02.400 --> 2:58:07.280]  in the 1960s researchers in france noticed that people who ate certain quail
[2:58:07.280 --> 2:58:11.600]  eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses
[2:58:11.600 --> 2:58:15.600]  they began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[2:58:15.600 --> 2:58:18.800]  we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting
[2:58:18.800 --> 2:58:22.640]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[2:58:22.640 --> 2:58:27.040]  pollen block is natural and effective it is not an antihistamine
[2:58:27.040 --> 2:58:30.800]  in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the
[2:58:30.800 --> 2:58:34.400]  activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:39.680]  and inflammatory responses in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe

[2:59:54.800 --> 3:00:06.720]  welcome back i'm alex jones we were riding shotgun with us matt bracken
[3:00:06.720 --> 3:00:09.600]  about to take over billy during the break you're like wow
[3:00:09.600 --> 3:00:12.960]  we're kind of arguing i am not arguing with you i agree with you
[3:00:12.960 --> 3:00:16.880]  i'm just saying the democrats know people aren't
[3:00:16.880 --> 3:00:21.600]  racist they know that because we aren't our weaknesses they can tell us do what
[3:00:21.600 --> 3:00:25.600]  we say or we'll call you racist it's a form of terrorism
[3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:29.600]  and they have wound up a lot of minorities to act like classical racists now
[3:00:29.600 --> 3:00:32.320]  and i just think getting right back in people's face is the way to go now
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:36.000]  you're actually exactly right when you said that about how
[3:00:36.000 --> 3:00:40.720]  they know that people aren't racist it's the same way they know that that baby in
[3:00:40.720 --> 3:00:44.720]  the womb is a as a human yet they try to deny it
[3:00:44.720 --> 3:00:48.240]  they use all these roundabout ways to try to deny it it's
[3:00:48.240 --> 3:00:51.680]  we're what it really is alex is i'm getting sick and tired of liberals
[3:00:51.680 --> 3:00:55.200]  with their arguments trying to push absolute untruth
[3:00:55.200 --> 3:00:59.120]  and illogical conclusions and think that we're just going to have to
[3:00:59.120 --> 3:01:02.560]  believe them because they resort to emotional appeals
[3:01:02.560 --> 3:01:05.840]  to try to make everyone feel uncomfortable that's what they try to do
[3:01:05.840 --> 3:01:09.760]  resort to emotional appeals so that people feel uncomfortable they can shut
[3:01:09.760 --> 3:01:13.440]  down dialogue and then we can't reach the factual logical
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:16.560]  conclusion that they're wrong well it's like them
[3:01:16.560 --> 3:01:21.120]  suing people if they question public events they want us to like you said
[3:01:21.120 --> 3:01:24.160]  do what they say they want us to buy into whatever they say
[3:01:24.160 --> 3:01:28.240]  well that that chow left the barn a long time ago i don't
[3:01:28.240 --> 3:01:31.520]  know what's you know what the best way to refute liberal
[3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:35.680]  arguments is you just go out there and you put a microphone in front of their
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:40.080]  face and you let them speak and ask them to essentially
[3:01:40.080 --> 3:01:44.160]  tell you why they support what they support and you will just get a bunch of
[3:01:44.160 --> 3:01:47.520]  jibber jabber cussing yelling you've been doing you've been doing
[3:01:47.520 --> 3:01:50.800]  interviewing people six seven years but intensely last four
[3:01:50.800 --> 3:01:54.320]  obviously it's getting more extreme how would you describe
[3:01:54.320 --> 3:01:58.400]  the tenor in the last few years there's definitely an uptick in violence
[3:01:58.400 --> 3:02:02.240]  and hostility and it's not just info wars because i've seen other journalists
[3:02:02.240 --> 3:02:06.720]  out there bright part other media companies get the same vitriol it's
[3:02:06.720 --> 3:02:11.280]  an uptick in violence from the left because they are realizing that all
[3:02:11.280 --> 3:02:14.640]  these beliefs that they've held and been brainwashed with
[3:02:14.640 --> 3:02:18.240]  that it's no longer going to be their reality
[3:02:18.240 --> 3:02:21.920]  because people are waking up people are getting redpilled and they're seeing
[3:02:21.920 --> 3:02:24.880]  the truth for what it is and they're panicking because
[3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:28.320]  these are your lemmings that want to run off the side of a cliff
[3:02:28.320 --> 3:02:31.840]  and they'll take humanity with them if we let them
[3:02:31.840 --> 3:02:36.960]  and that's why no more silence from conservatives i ask you i beg you
[3:02:36.960 --> 3:02:40.560]  conservatives please do something because these lemmings want to take us off
[3:02:40.560 --> 3:02:43.360]  the side of the cliff with them because that's where they're headed
[3:02:43.360 --> 3:02:47.120]  they want to destroy humanity they want our little children our little boys to
[3:02:47.120 --> 3:02:49.920]  be turned into drag queens they want our babies
[3:02:49.920 --> 3:02:54.000]  aborted and killed and they think nothing's wrong with that
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:57.840]  this is where we're heading alex millie i want to take what you just said live on
[3:02:57.840 --> 3:03:01.440]  air and and run it as a promo piece because you've never i've never heard
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:06.080]  anybody say true words that's what this is and it's a total
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:11.040]  attempt to take control of reality to dominate and bully everyone
[3:03:11.040 --> 3:03:15.040]  into submission and the the leadership of this
[3:03:15.040 --> 3:03:17.840]  knows full well what they're doing and they went to college
[3:03:17.840 --> 3:03:20.800]  and they got two or three of these worthless degrees and they were told
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:24.560]  you'll be the ruling class hillary's going to be elected 10 years ago they
[3:03:24.560 --> 3:03:29.280]  told them and when it didn't happen they've invested in this pipe dream
[3:03:29.280 --> 3:03:32.400]  and they're supposed to be the new ruling class
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:37.120]  when america doesn't really have that and they are so incredibly upset
[3:03:37.120 --> 3:03:41.360]  and now they're doing a ghost dance thinking if they throw a giant fit
[3:03:41.360 --> 3:03:44.880]  somehow will submit and then they can finally
[3:03:44.880 --> 3:03:48.240]  take control of civilization and part of it is that the liberals just don't want
[3:03:48.240 --> 3:03:51.840]  to admit that they're wrong some of them are just being so stubborn they don't
[3:03:51.840 --> 3:03:54.480]  want to admit they're wrong they don't want to admit that the russia collusion
[3:03:54.480 --> 3:03:58.000]  thing was a hoax just like how we saw nancy polosi i mean the democrats are
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:04:00.960]  doubling down trying to act like trump's covering up
[3:04:00.960 --> 3:04:05.360]  but there's no evidence there's no collusion and even when i'm at these
[3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:08.240]  these rallies they still say collusion you're a russian
[3:04:08.240 --> 3:04:12.400]  exactly and they act ridiculous when you point out that they're illogical
[3:04:12.400 --> 3:04:15.680]  and if you want to find those videos you can find them on millenio milley or you

[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:20.080]  jones show
[3:06:20.080 --> 3:06:25.280]  okay you've got me for the next hour i'm always thinking to myself
[3:06:25.280 --> 3:06:29.600]  as i come into the show the best show prep for this hour
[3:06:29.600 --> 3:06:34.160]  is just listening to the last hour because i just want to keep listening
[3:06:34.160 --> 3:06:39.120]  and i hope that i can i can maintain the high standard there that was
[3:06:39.120 --> 3:06:44.240]  with alex's guests and millie before me i love what alex said right there at the
[3:06:44.240 --> 3:06:47.680]  end the democrats are doing the ghost dance
[3:06:47.680 --> 3:06:51.120]  you know that was when the around the 1890s the last
[3:06:51.120 --> 3:06:54.640]  sue we're hoping that they could by magic
[3:06:54.640 --> 3:06:58.400]  make the white man's soldiers bullets just pass through them
[3:06:58.400 --> 3:07:02.960]  like water if they did the right ghost dance it didn't work out too well
[3:07:02.960 --> 3:07:07.760]  now i think what's happening i've often used the poker game analogy
[3:07:07.760 --> 3:07:12.320]  that trump has been obviously waiting for the mule report because he's got to
[3:07:12.320 --> 3:07:15.920]  show all of his cards before trump starts laying down his
[3:07:15.920 --> 3:07:20.800]  cards and the rose garden the rose garden
[3:07:20.800 --> 3:07:24.000]  speaks after the the short oval office meeting
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:28.400]  or trap i think that was brilliant you have to go back to
[3:07:28.400 --> 3:07:32.320]  to trump over the last many decades as a business leader
[3:07:32.320 --> 3:07:36.080]  and it's not just you know putting on the green eye shade and and
[3:07:36.080 --> 3:07:38.880]  getting your accountants and adding up the numbers there's a lot of
[3:07:38.880 --> 3:07:43.280]  psychological warfare involved in in business dealings
[3:07:43.280 --> 3:07:47.360]  and also obviously now involved in political dealings
[3:07:47.360 --> 3:07:52.800]  when when polosi said that trump is involved in a cover-up and she's having
[3:07:52.800 --> 3:07:58.160]  the impeachment meetings with her mainstream democrat radicals
[3:07:58.160 --> 3:08:02.160]  i think that trump that that was that made meant
[3:08:02.160 --> 3:08:07.520]  that made trump reach his limit and he had no plan at all for an infrastructure
[3:08:07.520 --> 3:08:11.520]  meeting he let them walk in he sandbagged them he walked out to the
[3:08:11.520 --> 3:08:15.200]  rose garden and he laid it on them and he was very calm and
[3:08:15.200 --> 3:08:19.840]  collected so when nancy polosi says that he had a temper tantrum
[3:08:19.840 --> 3:08:23.680]  and meanwhile she's drooling like somebody with dementia and can barely
[3:08:23.680 --> 3:08:27.440]  form words it it kind of puts the lie to her and
[3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:31.840]  does make her look like a ghost dancer and i think that
[3:08:31.840 --> 3:08:36.640]  what trump is doing and if you look at this as a businessman a politician and
[3:08:36.640 --> 3:08:44.240]  as a as a reality tv a host he is applying jiu jitsu to them
[3:08:44.240 --> 3:08:51.040]  so in jiu jitsu or in aikido you use the strength of your enemy against them
[3:08:51.040 --> 3:08:54.480]  and you you know you use their their rigidity or their
[3:08:54.480 --> 3:08:58.400]  their momentum and you understand it better than they do
[3:08:58.400 --> 3:09:02.800]  so that you can actually use their own force against them and that's what trump
[3:09:02.800 --> 3:09:06.720]  is doing now something that's been a big advantage of the
[3:09:06.720 --> 3:09:10.320]  democrats and we've all often commented on it
[3:09:10.320 --> 3:09:14.320]  whether they're right or wrong whether they have a weak hand or a strong hand
[3:09:14.320 --> 3:09:17.840]  they're very united they have party discipline
[3:09:17.840 --> 3:09:22.080]  they stick to the party line and right now the party line is
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:27.040]  trump is you know is a villain he's out of control he needs an intervention
[3:09:27.040 --> 3:09:30.640]  and and we have to go forward with impeachment
[3:09:30.640 --> 3:09:35.120]  meanwhile his rallies are drawing monster crowds the economy is doing great
[3:09:35.120 --> 3:09:38.640]  so there's this huge cognitive dissonance building up
[3:09:38.640 --> 3:09:43.200]  between what americans are hearing from trump and from the democrats
[3:09:43.200 --> 3:09:46.480]  and what they're seeing with their own eyes and now
[3:09:46.480 --> 3:09:50.720]  trump has trapped them into going further down this
[3:09:50.720 --> 3:09:54.880]  impeachment path sort of like a losing card player
[3:09:54.880 --> 3:09:58.800]  doubling down and doubling down eventually
[3:09:58.800 --> 3:10:02.480]  they're not only going to lose their stake they're going to lose the ranch
[3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:08.240]  because what they what they're oblivious to or they the reality that they
[3:10:08.240 --> 3:10:12.480]  prefer not to see is that trump's strongest cards
[3:10:12.480 --> 3:10:17.840]  are all about to be put on the table and the democrats have cut themselves off
[3:10:17.840 --> 3:10:22.240]  from any ability to retreat but to a position of reality
[3:10:22.240 --> 3:10:25.680]  where they're where they could say oh we knew all along there was no collusion
[3:10:25.680 --> 3:10:29.360]  and you know they can't do that they've burned all those bridges
[3:10:29.360 --> 3:10:33.040]  trump has lured them into burning all the bridges
[3:10:33.040 --> 3:10:37.280]  and they're stuck now out on the impeachment path
[3:10:37.280 --> 3:10:41.440]  meanwhile all of the real cards are about to be laid down
[3:10:41.440 --> 3:10:46.000]  and there are some huge cards going to come we have all been hearing for the
[3:10:46.000 --> 3:10:49.520]  past week about popadopolis and joseph mifsud
[3:10:49.520 --> 3:10:54.000]  i'd like to know if joseph mifsud if anybody's seen him alive lately
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:59.760]  because there are a lot of people john brennan etc that wish that joseph mifsud
[3:10:59.760 --> 3:11:02.240]  would be buried in the center of the earth somewhere
[3:11:02.240 --> 3:11:06.000]  or the bottom of the ocean because if that guy ever comes
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:10.240]  before congress it's going to you know he's not going to go down the tubes like
[3:11:10.240 --> 3:11:13.280]  a g gordon liddy he's going to say look i'm an
[3:11:13.280 --> 3:11:18.240]  operative for the uh five eyes i follow orders i got my orders from
[3:11:18.240 --> 3:11:23.280]  from mi6 they got their their orders in cooperative agreements
[3:11:23.280 --> 3:11:28.160]  from head of cia john brennan i just did what i was told
[3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:33.760]  this would make uh the john dean and uh the the disclosures about the tapes and
[3:11:33.760 --> 3:11:38.400]  watergate seem like nothing and and as far as the
[3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:42.720]  the democrat controlled mainstream media it's the same with them
[3:11:42.720 --> 3:11:47.040]  they've also burned all their bridges they can't now come back towards
[3:11:47.040 --> 3:11:51.040]  towards reality and say oh well yeah you know we were just going with that
[3:11:51.040 --> 3:11:54.880]  russia collusion story for the ratings but we never really believed it
[3:11:54.880 --> 3:11:57.920]  they're committed to it they are completely
[3:11:57.920 --> 3:12:02.720]  fully committed to it just the way that in a small side analogy
[3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:07.760]  they had michael avinotti on hundreds of times on msnbc and cnn
[3:12:07.760 --> 3:12:11.600]  they were calling him a strong presidential candidate
[3:12:11.600 --> 3:12:15.760]  and now he's completely revealed as a as a
[3:12:15.760 --> 3:12:20.960]  charlatan shyster lawyer huckster who even robbed his client stormy
[3:12:20.960 --> 3:12:24.720]  daniels and so this shows how the the media just is
[3:12:24.720 --> 3:12:28.320]  trapped out on their own limb sawing their own limb off
[3:12:28.320 --> 3:12:32.160]  and trump has been masterful it's sort of a
[3:12:32.160 --> 3:12:35.680]  in this poker game we've all been begging him to lay these cards down to lay
[3:12:35.680 --> 3:12:39.600]  these cards down but no he's been he's been holding his cards
[3:12:39.600 --> 3:12:44.320]  and watching the pot grow and what you know every time he makes a small bet the
[3:12:44.320 --> 3:12:49.040]  other side goes all in and covers him and the the pot is growing the pot is
[3:12:49.040 --> 3:12:53.360]  growing and now the these all the disclosures that the
[3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:56.880]  declassifications they're going to come out one after another
[3:12:56.880 --> 3:13:00.720]  they're going to be like 50 caliber bullets ripping through the democrats
[3:13:00.720 --> 3:13:04.080]  in the media there's going to be nowhere left for them
[3:13:04.080 --> 3:13:10.160]  if the economy holds together and we don't go to war with china or iran or
[3:13:10.160 --> 3:13:13.280]  some kind of a huge black swan event like that
[3:13:13.280 --> 3:13:19.520]  then it's going to be a huge victory in 2020 like a reagan 49 state kind of a
[3:13:19.520 --> 3:13:24.400]  thing because the democrats are going to have totally discredited themselves
[3:13:24.400 --> 3:13:29.040]  as as liars who are willing to take this country
[3:13:29.040 --> 3:13:34.080]  you know and tear it to pieces for pure political gain
[3:13:34.080 --> 3:13:37.760]  when it's shown that the real russian collusion was from
[3:13:37.760 --> 3:13:44.320]  hillary clinton and the dnc via her law firm fusion fusion gps and christopher
[3:13:44.320 --> 3:13:48.400]  steele to the russians that that was the real russian collusion
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:52.880]  collusion story when the average american who hasn't been paying that much
[3:13:52.880 --> 3:13:56.160]  attention when he finally figures out wait a
[3:13:56.160 --> 3:14:00.080]  minute the democrats were lying the whole time
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:04.080]  it's going to completely blow up the democrat party
[3:14:04.080 --> 3:14:08.960]  some people even think that trump didn't campaign hard for the congressmen
[3:14:08.960 --> 3:14:13.760]  in the midterms because he actually saw this in advance
[3:14:13.760 --> 3:14:19.440]  and saw how having a democrat congress for these two years
[3:14:19.440 --> 3:14:25.360]  would allow him to play a huge huge jujitsu leverage move
[3:14:25.360 --> 3:14:30.000]  to sort of you know by having them slightly stronger for two years
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:34.400]  to flip them to the mat knock the wind out of them pin them and then have four
[3:14:34.400 --> 3:14:38.560]  years where he can do anything it remains to be seen maybe i'm
[3:14:38.560 --> 3:14:42.720]  overly optimistic but as the next few days
[3:14:42.720 --> 3:14:46.720]  and weeks come to pass i expect at least if you listen to the
[3:14:46.720 --> 3:14:50.320]  you know the the regular the folks like nunas and
[3:14:50.320 --> 3:14:55.440]  jordan these these declassifications are going to be explosive
[3:14:55.440 --> 3:15:01.040]  and it's going to leave the the democrats and their democrat mainstream media
[3:15:01.040 --> 3:15:05.440]  with nowhere to hide completely discredited and
[3:15:05.440 --> 3:15:09.920]  we'll see what happens maybe you know i've i've had hope before but
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:12.880]  nothing like this is i feel better right now
[3:15:12.880 --> 3:15:17.600]  than that any and at any other point and then around the world we see other
[3:15:17.600 --> 3:15:22.320]  victories australia uh the huge victory for
[3:15:22.320 --> 3:15:25.760]  against labor the liberal party there the conservatives
[3:15:25.760 --> 3:15:30.080]  the uh the vote in uk today uh haven't seen how that's turning out but
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:34.800]  the brexit party should be doing great even in germany the tide seems to be
[3:15:34.800 --> 3:15:38.000]  turning and i can talk about that when we come back from the break
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:42.240]  all right anyway get a control matt maybe you're too optimistic

[3:20:16.240 --> 3:20:21.440]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones with
[3:20:21.440 --> 3:20:28.480]  Matt Bracken
[3:20:28.480 --> 3:20:32.640]  all right now uh i've got some more to say but we will be taking some phone
[3:20:32.640 --> 3:20:36.000]  calls maybe the next segment and that number is
[3:20:36.000 --> 3:20:46.160]  877-789-2539 or 789 alex and uh as the lines fill up maybe the
[3:20:46.160 --> 3:20:48.880]  next segment we'll go to that now i sound
[3:20:48.880 --> 3:20:52.640]  a pretty optimistic in the last segment and certainly
[3:20:52.640 --> 3:20:56.400]  it's better to have a battlefield victory than a loss
[3:20:56.400 --> 3:21:00.080]  but something that it's very important to remember is
[3:21:00.080 --> 3:21:03.360]  the progressives the communists the globalists
[3:21:03.360 --> 3:21:06.960]  they're fully committed this is their religion
[3:21:06.960 --> 3:21:10.080]  they they say they don't believe in god but their god is
[3:21:10.080 --> 3:21:14.480]  is global communism but they look at it in certain
[3:21:14.480 --> 3:21:19.280]  in several different ways for the masses communism is sold
[3:21:19.280 --> 3:21:23.040]  as their panacea you know everybody gets free stuff
[3:21:23.040 --> 3:21:27.760]  free college free medic medical care
[3:21:27.760 --> 3:21:34.800]  free housing of course that's ridiculous for the elites that rule the masses
[3:21:34.800 --> 3:21:39.200]  communism is a way to become feudal overlords
[3:21:39.200 --> 3:21:43.200]  they get to live in the castles which today are our gated communities or
[3:21:43.200 --> 3:21:48.080]  compounds like you know where zuckerberg and these other titans live
[3:21:48.080 --> 3:21:51.840]  they don't care if it's wreckage outside as long as the
[3:21:51.840 --> 3:21:55.680]  the dumb masses as long as the dumb masses
[3:21:55.680 --> 3:21:59.760]  vote for them on continuing promises of free stuff
[3:21:59.760 --> 3:22:04.880]  then they get to rule the people that get crushed are us the middle class
[3:22:04.880 --> 3:22:09.600]  the working class the heritage americans that built the country
[3:22:09.600 --> 3:22:14.800]  and we're just in the squeeze out play this is why the democrats are fully
[3:22:14.800 --> 3:22:18.320]  committed to open borders this is why it's absolutely
[3:22:18.320 --> 3:22:22.480]  foolish to even discuss going to congress
[3:22:22.480 --> 3:22:26.160]  and have any kind of reform not only would it be
[3:22:26.160 --> 3:22:30.400]  dragged out for months all that we would get from the democrat congress
[3:22:30.400 --> 3:22:34.640]  would be amnesty proposals we are voting rights proposals
[3:22:34.640 --> 3:22:37.840]  so it's ridiculous it's a joke and it's a waste of time
[3:22:37.840 --> 3:22:42.880]  to even go in that direction but as trump becomes stronger
[3:22:42.880 --> 3:22:47.760]  as the deep state coup is revealed and the democrats are in in retreat and
[3:22:47.760 --> 3:22:51.280]  have to cover their weakness trump will have the
[3:22:51.280 --> 3:22:54.560]  political capital to push straight ahead with what he could
[3:22:54.560 --> 3:22:57.920]  have been doing all along and in my opinion maybe he
[3:22:57.920 --> 3:23:00.000]  should have been of course he would have been
[3:23:00.000 --> 3:23:04.800]  crucified just massacred by the media for cruelty
[3:23:04.800 --> 3:23:09.920]  but it's actually more cruel to lure people into this country
[3:23:09.920 --> 3:23:13.840]  where they may face deportation regardless you have to spend their
[3:23:13.840 --> 3:23:17.200]  life savings five or six thousand dollars spent
[3:23:17.200 --> 3:23:22.080]  paid to the cartels to get them to the border to come across the border
[3:23:22.080 --> 3:23:26.240]  maybe lose their life in the desert or or you know maybe wind up being sex
[3:23:26.240 --> 3:23:29.520]  trafficked or catching a disease in one of these
[3:23:29.520 --> 3:23:34.400]  facilities it's actually more humane to clearly indicate
[3:23:34.400 --> 3:23:39.440]  to the world that the open door policy is closed
[3:23:39.440 --> 3:23:43.680]  and this actually was done last november and then also around
[3:23:43.680 --> 3:23:49.040]  the new year where caravans were turned away with pepper spray
[3:23:49.040 --> 3:23:52.960]  it seems like a long time ago a few months but it actually happened
[3:23:52.960 --> 3:23:56.240]  and it went down pretty well this was when there were
[3:23:56.240 --> 3:24:00.560]  10 000 or more that were all stashed in teowanna
[3:24:00.560 --> 3:24:04.400]  and they did sort of a wide out to the right
[3:24:04.400 --> 3:24:08.640]  to get to try to storm the border in san yasidro
[3:24:08.640 --> 3:24:12.800]  and we just fired pepper spray canisters at them and turned them back
[3:24:12.800 --> 3:24:16.400]  there was some bad media you know women dragging their children
[3:24:16.400 --> 3:24:20.240]  wiping their eyes from pepper spray but let's face it
[3:24:20.240 --> 3:24:26.560]  what country on earth can just have an open border to the world
[3:24:26.560 --> 3:24:32.240]  it's it's ridiculous there's no country if there's no border
[3:24:32.240 --> 3:24:36.880]  article four section four of the of the constitution says
[3:24:36.880 --> 3:24:40.560]  that the united states government shall protect the states
[3:24:40.560 --> 3:24:46.240]  from invasion it's in the constitution if the army if the military
[3:24:46.240 --> 3:24:51.520]  is for anything it's for defending our own borders from an invasion
[3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:57.040]  and fences work hungry when hungry was part of the balkan chain to back door
[3:24:57.040 --> 3:25:00.240]  their way up to germany they'd come from greece
[3:25:00.240 --> 3:25:03.760]  through the balkans which are not part of the eu shangan
[3:25:03.760 --> 3:25:07.200]  through hungry into europe hungry put up their own fence
[3:25:07.200 --> 3:25:12.640]  in months not a wall not something fancy and beautiful made out of giant steel
[3:25:12.640 --> 3:25:16.720]  panels but fence systems in months they put up hundreds of
[3:25:16.720 --> 3:25:21.040]  kilometers of fence and stopped the invasion cold
[3:25:21.040 --> 3:25:26.080]  we can do it just as fast and even before we have the big fence system like you
[3:25:26.080 --> 3:25:29.200]  see on that picture army troops can pull out
[3:25:29.200 --> 3:25:35.520]  concertina wire miles per day and with concertina wire in a pyramid
[3:25:35.520 --> 3:25:40.240]  just on the ground backed up with troops and pepper spray
[3:25:40.240 --> 3:25:45.600]  just like we did in san yasidro last november and around new years
[3:25:45.600 --> 3:25:49.600]  if you have mobs of people coming to the border and you know you don't have to
[3:25:49.600 --> 3:25:52.800]  welcome them into your country you don't have to have a
[3:25:52.800 --> 3:25:56.400]  taxi service of border patrol agents to take them
[3:25:56.400 --> 3:26:00.800]  to hold them for 20 days and then them to release them across america
[3:26:00.800 --> 3:26:04.800]  you can actually see them coming we have the technology
[3:26:04.800 --> 3:26:11.680]  a fleer infrared etc we can see them coming loudspeaker pepper spray
[3:26:11.680 --> 3:26:17.520]  turn around and very soon the word gets out that it's not an open door anymore
[3:26:17.520 --> 3:26:21.600]  if the if the president can't do this i don't know what he can do i mean we're
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:24.720]  we're talking about sending more troops back to the middle east
[3:26:24.720 --> 3:26:28.000]  but we won't even defend our own border we act as if
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:33.120]  we have to take everybody across our border if we stop them in northern
[3:26:33.120 --> 3:26:37.680]  mexico the dynamic changes completely
[3:26:37.680 --> 3:26:42.640]  because what happens is instead of mexico being a rapid turnstile
[3:26:42.640 --> 3:26:46.640]  where they're just flowing across dropping money in the coffers of the
[3:26:46.640 --> 3:26:51.920]  of the cartels and the people who who make money off of this
[3:26:51.920 --> 3:26:58.240]  migration instead of that becoming a open turnstile then mexico suddenly has a
[3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:01.760]  glut of refugees all across their northern border
[3:27:01.760 --> 3:27:06.160]  that's when you'll see them really cracking down because otherwise
[3:27:06.160 --> 3:27:10.640]  there's no there's no disincentive there's all there's advertisements out in
[3:27:10.640 --> 3:27:14.080]  in guatemala and el salvador saying come to america
[3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:17.440]  everything's free there are villages emptying out
[3:27:17.440 --> 3:27:23.680]  some people say more than one percent of guatemala has recently moved to america
[3:27:23.680 --> 3:27:29.280]  already i think a quarter of el salvador lives in the united states of america
[3:27:29.280 --> 3:27:34.400]  america is essentially abolishing itself and if we don't get a grip on this
[3:27:34.400 --> 3:27:38.800]  we're not going to be america because culture is destiny
[3:27:38.800 --> 3:27:42.800]  the people that are coming in don't know about the constitution
[3:27:42.800 --> 3:27:46.640]  can't spell it don't even read or write spanish
[3:27:46.640 --> 3:27:50.720]  are not particularly bright the only thing they know for sure
[3:27:50.720 --> 3:27:55.840]  is if they get to america eventually they'll be able to vote for the democrats
[3:27:55.840 --> 3:27:59.600]  and they'll vote for more welfare and if that happens
[3:27:59.600 --> 3:28:03.840]  folks we're done so it's going to take a president
[3:28:03.840 --> 3:28:08.800]  with a very harsh policy at the border but you have as they say you have to be
[3:28:08.800 --> 3:28:13.280]  cruel to be kind you have to clearly indicate
[3:28:13.280 --> 3:28:16.800]  that the open passage the open border is finished
[3:28:16.800 --> 3:28:21.600]  only then will this mass migration stop until that happens
[3:28:21.600 --> 3:28:24.960]  you know waiting for miles of wall to be built
[3:28:24.960 --> 3:28:29.120]  when it's going to take a decade in a decade there won't be a united states
[3:28:29.120 --> 3:28:32.880]  of america as we know it you know the in the next
[3:28:32.880 --> 3:28:36.480]  election i mean if florida or texas goes democrat
[3:28:36.480 --> 3:28:42.160]  it's all over it'll be hello president but a jig or kamala harris
[3:28:42.160 --> 3:28:45.280]  and then the the floodgates will be wide open
[3:28:45.280 --> 3:28:48.720]  so this really is an existential moment for america
[3:28:48.720 --> 3:28:52.960]  when when we come back on the other side uh we'll start taking some calls
[3:28:52.960 --> 3:28:56.400]  okay so a watch is good and some jewelry better grab some flowers too

[3:32:01.120 --> 3:32:05.440]  that it lowers IQ it literally dumps the population down
[3:32:05.440 --> 3:32:09.600]  and on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world
[3:32:09.600 --> 3:32:14.480]  we've gone through two permutations first seaweed based iodine that was
[3:32:14.480 --> 3:32:17.600]  pretty good but hard to source and the globalist tried to block us getting a
[3:32:17.600 --> 3:32:21.280]  supply of it so we discovered deep earth crystals a pure
[3:32:21.280 --> 3:32:24.800]  nascent iodine and brought you x2 that's been incredible
[3:32:24.800 --> 3:32:28.480]  now due to the establishment trying to block that we did more research and
[3:32:28.480 --> 3:32:32.880]  secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine but
[3:32:32.880 --> 3:32:36.560]  chemists scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with
[3:32:36.560 --> 3:32:40.880]  three other compounds two forms of iodine and vitamin c it
[3:32:40.880 --> 3:32:45.840]  supercharges it and makes it even more bio available
[3:32:45.840 --> 3:32:48.480]  ladies and gentlemen you want to research it you want to see it
[3:32:48.480 --> 3:32:54.960]  it's an incredible discovery x3 now available at m4slife.com
[3:32:54.960 --> 3:33:13.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:13.840 --> 3:33:21.600]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now
[3:33:21.600 --> 3:33:26.560]  your host matt bracken
[3:33:26.640 --> 3:33:30.400]  okay uh before we start taking calls i want to
[3:33:30.400 --> 3:33:34.480]  pull together some foreign threads and sort of paint a picture
[3:33:34.480 --> 3:33:38.800]  globally so to speak last week in australia
[3:33:38.800 --> 3:33:43.200]  the conservative it's weird in that country the conservative party is called
[3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:47.200]  the liberals and the liberals are called labor but anyway
[3:33:47.200 --> 3:33:51.440]  60 polls in a row mainstream polls in a row
[3:33:51.440 --> 3:33:54.800]  declared that labor was going to win the election
[3:33:54.800 --> 3:34:00.800]  by a wide margin and just like with trump and with the brexit result
[3:34:00.800 --> 3:34:08.480]  the brexit referendum the polls were wrong so in 2019
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:11.440]  you have to pretty much come to the conclusion
[3:34:11.440 --> 3:34:14.560]  that when you hear about polls in the in the media
[3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:19.040]  all you're doing is sticking a funnel into your ear for propaganda
[3:34:19.040 --> 3:34:23.520]  number one who honestly answers polls who says sure i'll take 10 minutes of my
[3:34:23.520 --> 3:34:26.160]  time and go through a hundred questions of
[3:34:26.160 --> 3:34:30.960]  which they'll cherry pick some that that they want certain results where the
[3:34:30.960 --> 3:34:34.480]  five preceding questions were designed to lead you to a
[3:34:34.480 --> 3:34:38.320]  to an answer on the question that they want i mean it the whole science of it
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:42.000]  is bogus this sample is is ridiculous because
[3:34:42.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  most people hang up on pollsters or lie to them
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:52.160]  but the point is everybody in australia thought that the liberal labor party
[3:34:52.160 --> 3:34:56.400]  was going to win and instead the conservative
[3:34:56.400 --> 3:34:59.920]  liberal party prime minister middleton won
[3:34:59.920 --> 3:35:03.440]  it shocked everybody just like trump's victory shocked everybody
[3:35:03.440 --> 3:35:08.800]  but by now it shouldn't be so shocking that election was over
[3:35:08.800 --> 3:35:14.480]  basically a green new deal party versus a free market economics party
[3:35:14.480 --> 3:35:18.320]  and people in public or on a poll they might say sure i'm for the green new
[3:35:18.320 --> 3:35:22.560]  deal roll i roll but when it comes to voting for
[3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:26.880]  let's cut our electricity by half in in 15 years
[3:35:26.880 --> 3:35:32.960]  or let's continue having a job people voted let's continue to have a job
[3:35:32.960 --> 3:35:38.400]  and if you if you extrapolate those results to an american 2020 election
[3:35:38.400 --> 3:35:43.280]  it would be like a president come out or a candidate kamala harris
[3:35:43.280 --> 3:35:46.720]  for the green new deal versus president trump
[3:35:46.720 --> 3:35:51.440]  for free market economics and i think it would be a wipeout for trump
[3:35:51.440 --> 3:35:54.960]  even in some some countries where you think that
[3:35:54.960 --> 3:36:00.960]  that the conservative or national side is is not that strong
[3:36:00.960 --> 3:36:04.480]  there are indications of a real time turn of the tide
[3:36:04.480 --> 3:36:09.840]  last week there's a popular national television show in germany
[3:36:09.840 --> 3:36:16.000]  and they took in a took a call in question does islam belong in germany
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:20.240]  and they had something like 15 000 people calling in sure they're self
[3:36:20.240 --> 3:36:23.680]  selecting but these are the people that were motivated
[3:36:23.680 --> 3:36:27.360]  and something like 94 of the callers said
[3:36:27.360 --> 3:36:32.080]  islam does not belong in germany i think that they believed that they had
[3:36:32.080 --> 3:36:36.080]  some privacy so they were more free with their opinion where they
[3:36:36.080 --> 3:36:39.680]  would never say that to a pollster you're talking to a pollster you don't know if
[3:36:39.680 --> 3:36:43.440]  it's some party guy who's recording your information for later
[3:36:43.440 --> 3:36:48.720]  use against you anyway there are some very positive trends
[3:36:48.720 --> 3:36:52.480]  but what all this means is that the eu bosses
[3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:56.160]  and the other globalist forces are going to be more desperate
[3:36:56.160 --> 3:37:01.200]  so that the game is not over by a long shot but we do seem to be lining up
[3:37:01.200 --> 3:37:07.040]  for a a some kind of a showdown over national sovereignty
[3:37:07.040 --> 3:37:12.800]  and free market economics versus globalism slash communism
[3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:18.400]  and the road to serfdom where global elites the brennans the comies
[3:37:18.400 --> 3:37:23.760]  the junkers the murkles the microns are going to run the world like a
[3:37:23.760 --> 3:37:27.600]  plantation where the middle class are just the slaves in
[3:37:27.600 --> 3:37:31.200]  the harness you know working our way so that we
[3:37:31.200 --> 3:37:34.160]  can pay for the migrants who will come into our
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:39.280]  countries and then vote that we as the slaves should work harder to pay them
[3:37:39.280 --> 3:37:43.680]  more welfare benefits you know this can't go on forever
[3:37:43.680 --> 3:37:46.880]  and it's going to wind up one way or the other
[3:37:46.880 --> 3:37:50.800]  but even if we do have some victories just remember
[3:37:50.800 --> 3:37:55.280]  progressivism is a religion and they're never going to quit
[3:37:55.280 --> 3:37:58.160]  just like you would never get muslims or christians
[3:37:58.160 --> 3:38:02.000]  to deny their faith based on rational arguments
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:06.240]  because to progressives they have the light of truth
[3:38:06.240 --> 3:38:10.640]  they have goodness on their side they are true believers
[3:38:10.640 --> 3:38:13.520]  they are you are never going to change their mind
[3:38:13.520 --> 3:38:17.360]  all we can do is beat them politically and if they
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:22.160]  pull enough tricks if they manage for example to impeach trump or
[3:38:22.160 --> 3:38:26.080]  something goes kinetic and trump is taken out and we wind up in a
[3:38:26.080 --> 3:38:30.400]  hot civil war instead of a cold civil war then we're gonna have to defeat them
[3:38:30.400 --> 3:38:33.440]  the other way but they're never going to just
[3:38:33.440 --> 3:38:37.440]  acquiesce to our arguments we're never going to convince them
[3:38:37.440 --> 3:38:41.600]  of the rightness of our logic the goodness of our history
[3:38:41.600 --> 3:38:45.200]  it's never going to happen we're going to have to defeat them
[3:38:45.200 --> 3:38:50.480]  politically if we can and by other means if that becomes necessary
[3:38:50.480 --> 3:38:53.520]  all right let's um let's go to some calls
[3:38:53.520 --> 3:38:58.320]  I see um since I'm kind of talking about immigration let's go to lander in
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:04.240]  oregon uh go ahead lander hey matt thanks for having me on
[3:39:04.240 --> 3:39:08.800]  you're welcome so I I like what you're talking about
[3:39:08.800 --> 3:39:12.480]  with all this stuff with the border but I'm wondering right now is
[3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:16.240]  you know we've already taken in so many immigrants do we already get
[3:39:16.240 --> 3:39:20.160]  basically a lethal dose for what the country can take what what's what do you
[3:39:20.160 --> 3:39:24.400]  see happening in the future there yeah that's a really that's a good
[3:39:24.400 --> 3:39:28.240]  point it may already be too late because you know that
[3:39:28.240 --> 3:39:31.360]  there's an old german saying there's nothing as permanent
[3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:35.280]  as a temporary guest worker you know once somebody gets into
[3:39:35.280 --> 3:39:39.520]  the community it's almost impossible to actually deport them
[3:39:39.520 --> 3:39:43.920]  even if they're you know a serial killer knocking off old ladies like
[3:39:43.920 --> 3:39:47.920]  we had one illegal um revealed last week he was
[3:39:47.920 --> 3:39:52.000]  an african actually I think from Nigeria but he was
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:56.400]  he was going to old ladies homes and killing women between like the age of
[3:39:56.400 --> 3:39:59.600]  70 and 90 you you don't see that in the mainstream
[3:39:59.600 --> 3:40:03.040]  media at all I mean imagine if it had been some white guy knocking off
[3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:06.800]  old black ladies it would be unbelievable
[3:40:06.800 --> 3:40:12.480]  so it's going to be very hard to deport any of this wave that is coming in
[3:40:12.480 --> 3:40:16.480]  eventually they and their children will probably be voting
[3:40:16.480 --> 3:40:20.480]  so it may it may mean that we're going to have to have
[3:40:20.480 --> 3:40:25.040]  some kind of a of a really harsh incident for example
[3:40:25.040 --> 3:40:28.960]  there's a lot of concern about Ebola right now in the Congo
[3:40:28.960 --> 3:40:32.960]  and and even in Nigeria getting into Sudan spreading
[3:40:32.960 --> 3:40:37.120]  and the the people carrying the Ebola there have been carriers
[3:40:37.120 --> 3:40:40.560]  that have had no symptoms for like weeks
[3:40:40.560 --> 3:40:44.720]  passed when they thought it was safe after isolation
[3:40:44.720 --> 3:40:48.240]  if the jihadis that have been attacking these Ebola clinics
[3:40:48.240 --> 3:40:53.280]  get infected people infected jihadis on to an airplane
[3:40:53.280 --> 3:40:57.280]  or they fly them to Mexico and have them walk across the border
[3:40:57.280 --> 3:41:02.320]  if Ebola gets loosened to this country and we have no means to to counter it
[3:41:02.320 --> 3:41:06.640]  there's no vaccines you know it one one Ebola patient
[3:41:06.640 --> 3:41:11.040]  requires you know an army of medical staff and just like a landfill and
[3:41:11.040 --> 3:41:14.880]  incinerators to deal with all of the the medical waste
[3:41:14.880 --> 3:41:19.920]  something like that at that level would I think be required to turn Americans
[3:41:19.920 --> 3:41:23.360]  harshly against the illegal immigration wave
[3:41:23.360 --> 3:41:26.800]  to the point where we would be mass deporting them
[3:41:26.800 --> 3:41:31.280]  but short of that I don't think that there's any chance of mass deportation
[3:41:31.280 --> 3:41:35.520]  and as you said we may already have had a lethal dose
[3:41:35.520 --> 3:41:39.520]  in terms of of the cloward-piven strategy
[3:41:39.520 --> 3:41:43.840]  overwhelming our welfare system and the Dunning-Kruger effect
[3:41:43.840 --> 3:41:48.160]  of reducing our IQ to the point where we just have a bunch of morons who
[3:41:48.160 --> 3:41:53.360]  always win the elections by voting for whoever promises the most
[3:41:53.360 --> 3:41:56.000]  welfare which is sort of like voting for the
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  idiocracy party but look it worked in California
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:03.520]  I mean you just look at California and you see the democrat plan
[3:42:03.520 --> 3:42:07.520]  for all 50 states you know the democrats that wreck cities like
[3:42:07.520 --> 3:42:10.880]  Baltimore or Chicago they don't turn around and say
[3:42:10.880 --> 3:42:15.520]  we're really sorry you republicans have any advice to give us about how we can
[3:42:15.520 --> 3:42:20.320]  fix this city heck no they're glad to wreck the city
[3:42:20.320 --> 3:42:24.640]  as long as the political elites rule the ruins
[3:42:24.640 --> 3:42:28.240]  and you know don't for a second think that democrats are ever going to come to
[3:42:28.240 --> 3:42:32.000]  their senses and say wow we've really been off the track
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:38.080]  we need to we need to institute some free market economic policies no way
[3:42:38.080 --> 3:42:41.520]  they don't care if if every city looks like Chicago or
[3:42:41.520 --> 3:42:45.680]  Baltimore as long as the democrat bosses are in charge
[3:42:45.680 --> 3:42:51.280]  they'll live like kings when we come back we'll take some more calls
[3:42:53.840 --> 3:42:58.080]  what you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech

[3:46:52.340 --> 3:46:53.340]  And get the fish oiled!
[3:46:53.340 --> 3:47:03.340]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:24.340 --> 3:47:34.340]  Okay, before I'm gone today, I want to mention I do actually have a new book out, which you can see right here.
[3:47:34.340 --> 3:47:40.340]  And it's a collection of my short stuff, I've written a lot of short stories and some essays.
[3:47:40.340 --> 3:47:45.340]  And it's available on Amazon and on Kindle, I'll do an audio book in a little while.
[3:47:45.340 --> 3:47:47.340]  Just wanted to mention that.
[3:47:47.340 --> 3:47:51.340]  Something that's really important, I was touching on in the last segment.
[3:47:51.340 --> 3:47:56.340]  Even when things are going well for us, remember, the left will never quit.
[3:47:56.340 --> 3:48:01.340]  It's the most powerful, proselytizing religion on the planet.
[3:48:01.340 --> 3:48:09.340]  The proof of it is that it's not Christians who are converting Marxists, it's the other way around.
[3:48:09.340 --> 3:48:18.340]  James Comey believes his great mentor of his entire life was this so-called theologian named Reinhold Nieberg,
[3:48:18.340 --> 3:48:22.340]  who believed that Jesus was sort of an early Marxist.
[3:48:22.340 --> 3:48:27.340]  Nelly Orr, who probably wrote the dossier more than Christopher Steele,
[3:48:27.340 --> 3:48:32.340]  she went to the Soviet Union to do her research during the good old gulag days.
[3:48:32.340 --> 3:48:40.340]  Brennan voted for the communist Gus Hall in the 70s when the Soviets were still running the gulags.
[3:48:40.340 --> 3:48:45.340]  So these folks absolutely are committed globalists.
[3:48:45.340 --> 3:48:50.340]  They can't wear the hammer and sickle anymore, it doesn't sell, they would if they could.
[3:48:50.340 --> 3:48:56.340]  But eventually, the tiger never changes its stripes.
[3:48:56.340 --> 3:49:01.340]  They do use a different mask to suit the era, but they're never going to quit.
[3:49:01.340 --> 3:49:04.340]  So this is going to be a lifelong battle for us.
[3:49:04.340 --> 3:49:09.340]  A problem with us conservatives is, Trump wins, we think it's over.
[3:49:09.340 --> 3:49:11.340]  That's the end of the threat.
[3:49:11.340 --> 3:49:15.340]  It's never, as we saw in the midterm elections, it's never over.
[3:49:15.340 --> 3:49:19.340]  We have to keep hammering away at them.
[3:49:19.340 --> 3:49:25.340]  And we are winning, as we can see from these elections in Australia and Britain, etc.
[3:49:25.340 --> 3:49:30.340]  But it's important to realize that they still control the mass media,
[3:49:30.340 --> 3:49:33.340]  and that's why they're going all out for censorship.
[3:49:33.340 --> 3:49:37.340]  That's why they'd like to see infowars absolutely destroyed.
[3:49:37.340 --> 3:49:43.340]  And it's very important in every channel that we can to keep pushing.
[3:49:43.340 --> 3:49:46.340]  Temporarily, I'm not banned on Facebook, which is unbelievable.
[3:49:46.340 --> 3:49:52.340]  So I'm posting links, but on Facebook, I can't post an infowars link.
[3:49:52.340 --> 3:49:55.340]  Or Paul Joseph Watson video, he's a banned person.
[3:49:55.340 --> 3:50:00.340]  So I wonder if I'm even doing the right thing by even being on Facebook at all.
[3:50:00.340 --> 3:50:04.340]  This morning, I just wrote a text on Facebook.
[3:50:04.340 --> 3:50:10.340]  A banned unperson with the initials PJW has a great new video out.
[3:50:10.340 --> 3:50:13.340]  If I actually linked, I'd be gone for 30 days.
[3:50:13.340 --> 3:50:16.340]  So I'm sort of torn there.
[3:50:16.340 --> 3:50:19.340]  All right, let's go back to the calls while we have a chance.
[3:50:19.340 --> 3:50:25.340]  And I'd like to talk to Judy in Florida about Trump's constitutional authority.
[3:50:25.340 --> 3:50:27.340]  Go ahead, Judy.
[3:50:27.340 --> 3:50:30.340]  Hi, Matt. It's great to talk to you.
[3:50:30.340 --> 3:50:33.340]  Sorry if I'm rasty. I'm home on doctor's orders.
[3:50:33.340 --> 3:50:34.340]  Okay.
[3:50:34.340 --> 3:50:40.340]  Yeah, I'm concerned about the authority that he has that he doesn't seem to be exercising,
[3:50:40.340 --> 3:50:45.340]  at least well enough, in my view, particularly when it comes to the border,
[3:50:45.340 --> 3:50:51.340]  because it seems as though, even with what Obama put in place during his presidency,
[3:50:51.340 --> 3:50:55.340]  that we've been, it's been an invasion from the beginning.
[3:50:55.340 --> 3:51:01.340]  So it's, you know, I wish he would have, and I think he should have acted much sooner in that regard.
[3:51:01.340 --> 3:51:06.340]  And also, I feel the same way when it comes to the censorship of his own constituency
[3:51:06.340 --> 3:51:09.340]  or those on the right in general.
[3:51:09.340 --> 3:51:17.340]  And I just feel like we don't know all of the deals that are being made behind closed doors
[3:51:17.340 --> 3:51:22.340]  as far as the survival of the nation or what he's been threatened with
[3:51:22.340 --> 3:51:26.340]  or whatever is holding him back, because it doesn't seem as though
[3:51:26.340 --> 3:51:32.340]  some of his decisions are very forthright or in our favor or for our protection.
[3:51:32.340 --> 3:51:38.340]  Yeah, there's no doubt that he has a lot of department heads who are not fully committed.
[3:51:38.340 --> 3:51:43.340]  I think that the Department of Homeland Secretary was her name, Nielsen.
[3:51:43.340 --> 3:51:48.340]  She was slow walking, you know, border protection.
[3:51:48.340 --> 3:51:53.340]  He has a lot of people that are maybe more afraid of the media than they need to be.
[3:51:53.340 --> 3:51:59.340]  I personally wish he would put, from day one, had put troops on the border and said, you know,
[3:51:59.340 --> 3:52:01.340]  the open border is done.
[3:52:01.340 --> 3:52:03.340]  It's in our power to do it.
[3:52:03.340 --> 3:52:08.340]  All it needs is concertina wire troops and pepper spray, and it's done.
[3:52:08.340 --> 3:52:14.340]  People won't keep coming if they keep getting pepper sprayed 100 meters inside of Mexico.
[3:52:14.340 --> 3:52:21.340]  And when there's 100,000 in northern Mexico, northern Mexican government will get real sick and tired
[3:52:21.340 --> 3:52:25.340]  of dealing with refugee camps in their soil.
[3:52:25.340 --> 3:52:32.340]  So it's really a sucker game to just be admitting 1,500 a day.
[3:52:32.340 --> 3:52:36.340]  That's something like, you know, almost 600,000 a year.
[3:52:36.340 --> 3:52:42.340]  And then on top of that, we have the legal, so-called legal migration by chain migration,
[3:52:42.340 --> 3:52:47.340]  which he hopes to do something with, but that would require a deal with Congress.
[3:52:47.340 --> 3:52:51.340]  As we saw yesterday, there's not gonna, there aren't gonna be any deals with Congress.
[3:52:51.340 --> 3:52:57.340]  So the president really needs to use his constitutional authority and seal the border.
[3:52:57.340 --> 3:52:59.340]  I don't know what he's waiting for.
[3:52:59.340 --> 3:53:06.340]  I've seen some border patrol people, retired border patrol people that have laid out the exact plan that I mentioned.
[3:53:06.340 --> 3:53:09.340]  Concertina wire troops, pepper spray.
[3:53:09.340 --> 3:53:11.340]  It can be done.
[3:53:11.340 --> 3:53:13.340]  I don't know why he doesn't do it.
[3:53:13.340 --> 3:53:22.340]  I don't know who's around him that's holding him back or, you know, if it's like the, if it's Jared and Ivanka and those guys,
[3:53:22.340 --> 3:53:27.340]  if they're, you know, surrounded by bleeding heart liberals, even in the White House, I don't know.
[3:53:27.340 --> 3:53:30.340]  I don't know.
[3:53:30.340 --> 3:53:33.340]  Wayne in Arizona has been holding the longest.
[3:53:33.340 --> 3:53:38.340]  You think that the grand jury, there are grand juries going on right now in your opinion?
[3:53:38.340 --> 3:53:44.340]  No, I wanted to talk about the preamble, but you're talking about the immigration of this invasion.
[3:53:44.340 --> 3:53:53.340]  I'm back on Wayno down here in Cochise County, where one of many illegal and unconstitutional invasions are going on.
[3:53:53.340 --> 3:54:05.340]  Page 38 of the White Justice Rule book provides the calling for the militia that causes the United States to present directives that repel invasions.
[3:54:05.340 --> 3:54:10.340]  Yeah, Wayne, your, Wayne, your audio is really bad and broken up, but I get your point.
[3:54:10.340 --> 3:54:16.340]  You know, Trump could not only use the military, he could ask for volunteers to come down to the border.
[3:54:16.340 --> 3:54:21.340]  I mean, there are, there are a lot of tools that could be used, including calling out the militia.
[3:54:21.340 --> 3:54:23.340]  This is an invasion. Absolutely.
[3:54:23.340 --> 3:54:26.340]  How many millions a year does it take before it's an invasion?
[3:54:26.340 --> 3:54:30.340]  Rome wasn't destroyed by, you know, invading armies.
[3:54:30.340 --> 3:54:38.340]  Rome was destroyed by refugees that they allowed into the country the Visigoths who were pleading that they had to escape from the Huns.
[3:54:38.340 --> 3:54:42.340]  They let the Visigoths in and the Visigoths sacked Rome.
[3:54:42.340 --> 3:54:46.340]  Wild man in Missouri, boy, you had some wild weather there last night.
[3:54:46.340 --> 3:54:49.340]  Oh, you want to talk about the Second Amendment?
[3:54:49.340 --> 3:54:50.340]  Go ahead.
[3:54:50.340 --> 3:54:53.340]  Yeah, I was just wondering if you heard about Missouri.
[3:54:53.340 --> 3:55:07.340]  We just passed the Second Amendment Preservation Act, which nullifies all federal gun control laws and makes it illegal for any federal law enforcement official to attempt to enforce federal gun control law in our state.
[3:55:07.340 --> 3:55:16.340]  And I also want to say thanks to Josh Hawley, our new senator, for being one of the few people in Washington to stand up to big tech and the censorship and recent hearings.
[3:55:16.340 --> 3:55:17.340]  Thank you, Hawley.
[3:55:17.340 --> 3:55:23.340]  Wild man, was that a bill that's proposed or is that an actual law that's passed?
[3:55:23.340 --> 3:55:25.340]  It just passed.
[3:55:25.340 --> 3:55:27.340]  Well, we'll have to look into that.
[3:55:27.340 --> 3:55:30.340]  Well, I'll look that up when the show's over.
[3:55:30.340 --> 3:55:33.340]  Second Amendment Preservation Act in Missouri.
[3:55:33.340 --> 3:55:34.340]  Okay.
[3:55:34.340 --> 3:55:36.340]  All right, now let's go out to California.
[3:55:36.340 --> 3:55:41.340]  Ian wants to know when we think that Trump will punish the Russiagators.
[3:55:41.340 --> 3:55:43.340]  Well, can't be soon enough for me.
[3:55:43.340 --> 3:55:45.340]  Go ahead, Ian.
[3:55:45.340 --> 3:55:48.340]  Yeah, I mean, can you hear me?
[3:55:48.340 --> 3:55:50.340]  Yes, loud and clear.
[3:55:50.340 --> 3:55:53.340]  Okay.
[3:55:53.340 --> 3:56:03.340]  My family came from the Philippines, and we've been here for 12, 12, 15 years, and we assimilated and all this stuff.
[3:56:03.340 --> 3:56:05.340]  And I've seen horrible things.
[3:56:05.340 --> 3:56:10.340]  I come from a country where there's not a lot of freedoms and all this stuff and all this corrupt.
[3:56:10.340 --> 3:56:23.340]  I never thought that I could, I would ever see that here, but to see such a blatant attempt to take over the government from within.
[3:56:23.340 --> 3:56:25.340]  Yeah, it's very third-worldish.
[3:56:25.340 --> 3:56:27.340]  It's very third-worldish.
[3:56:27.340 --> 3:56:38.340]  And if it's not stopped, if this isn't nipped in the bud, so to speak, if people don't go to jail, then what's the incentive not to just keep going to try it again?
[3:56:38.340 --> 3:56:44.340]  I personally think that Brennan, Clapper, Comey, Strock Page, or they need to be in prison.
[3:56:44.340 --> 3:56:46.340]  And maybe that's just the beginning.
[3:56:46.340 --> 3:56:50.340]  I'm optimistic that they're all ratting on each other right now, trying to make deals.
[3:56:50.340 --> 3:56:53.340]  And I think they'll all be pointing upward to Obama.
[3:56:53.340 --> 3:56:57.340]  In the end, their main defense is going to be Obama ordered us to do it.
[3:56:57.340 --> 3:57:03.340]  I mean, all those meetings in the Oval Office between the principles, they weren't talking about cookie recipes.
[3:57:03.340 --> 3:57:07.340]  They were talking about setting up this deep state coup.
[3:57:07.340 --> 3:57:09.340]  I'm pretty sure about that.
[3:57:09.340 --> 3:57:12.340]  Well, this is the last call of the day there.
[3:57:12.340 --> 3:57:14.340]  Good call.
[3:57:14.340 --> 3:57:17.340]  I hate to see America turn into a third-world country.
[3:57:17.340 --> 3:57:24.340]  If we're going to reestablish the rule of law, Trump's going to have to eventually go hardcore.
[3:57:24.340 --> 3:57:32.340]  And it looks like he has the building blocks in place with Attorney General Barr and the U.S. Attorney from Connecticut.
[3:57:32.340 --> 3:57:39.340]  I just hope it's not another bait and switch where we're going to get sold out by, you know, deep state actors.
[3:57:39.340 --> 3:58:03.340]  It sounds good, but really aren't going to do it.
[3:58:03.340 --> 3:58:15.340]  You're our only hope, brother.
[3:58:15.340 --> 3:58:17.340]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[3:58:17.340 --> 3:58:42.340]  It's people like you on the ground as you know that's boots on the ground.
[3:58:42.340 --> 3:58:51.340]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico,
[3:58:51.340 --> 3:58:55.340]  where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[3:58:55.340 --> 3:59:00.340]  Based off hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect traditions,
