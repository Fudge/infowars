[00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:12.064]  Well, there's a new buzzword out there and it's that Trump's involved in cover-ups.
[00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:25.474]  Here's what the president had to say in the Rose Garden yesterday after his meeting with the Crypt Keeper Nancy Pelosi and the guy that said he'd get Trump seven ways from Sunday, or six ways from Sunday, old Chuckie Schumer.
[00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:28.696]  Things are going well and I said let's have the meeting on infrastructure.
[00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:29.937]  We'll get that done easily.
[00:00:29.937 --> 00:00:32.379]  That's one of the easy ones.
[00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:33.080]  And instead of
[00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:43.275]  Walking in happily into a meeting, I walk in to look at people that had just said that I was doing a cover-up.
[00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:44.875]  I don't do cover-ups.
[00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:47.636]  You people know that probably better than anybody.
[00:00:47.636 --> 00:00:55.479]  And I was just looking at a list of some of the things that we just did more than 2,500 subpoenas qualified for.
[00:00:59.403 --> 00:01:01.365]  And I let everybody talk.
[00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:04.407]  I let the White House counsel speak for 30 hours.
[00:01:04.407 --> 00:01:07.489]  30 hours.
[00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:13.294]  I have 19 special counsel lawyers, 40 FBI agents.
[00:01:13.294 --> 00:01:15.155]  I said, open it all up.
[00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:17.277]  Let them have whatever they want.
[00:01:17.277 --> 00:01:19.278]  Nearly 500 search warrants.
[00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:20.419]  Think of that, a search warrant.
[00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:22.841]  Did you ever see a search warrant before?
[00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:26.184]  Neither did I. This was over 500 search warrants.
[00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:42.472]  And of the 19 people that were heading up this investigation, or whatever you want to call it, with Bob Mueller, they were contributors to the Democrat Party, most of them, and to Hillary Clinton.
[00:01:42.472 --> 00:01:44.294]  They hated President Trump.
[00:01:44.294 --> 00:01:47.076]  They hated him with a passion.
[00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:52.501]  They went to her big party after the election that turned out to be a wake, not a party.
[00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:53.042]  It was a wake.
[00:01:53.882 --> 00:01:55.483]  And they were very angry.
[00:01:55.483 --> 00:02:09.054]  These are the people that after two years and $40 million or $35 million, it'll end up being a lot more than that by the time all the bills are paid.
[00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:11.937]  This is what happened.
[00:02:11.937 --> 00:02:16.540]  No collusion, no obstruction, no nothing.
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.326]  They issued 50 orders authorizing use of pen registers.
[00:02:25.216 --> 00:02:37.063]  Think of that though, 500 witnesses and then I have Nancy Pelosi go out and say that the President of the United States engaged in a cover-up.
[00:02:37.063 --> 00:02:49.051]  Now, we've had a House investigation, we have Senate investigations, we have investigations like nobody's ever had before and there's nothing, we did nothing wrong.
[00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:50.692]  They would have loved to have said we
[00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.940]  Colluded.
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.821]  They would have loved it.
[00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:58.004]  These people were out to get us.
[00:02:58.004 --> 00:03:00.947]  The Republican Party and President Trump.
[00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:01.968]  They were out to get us.
[00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:05.811]  This was a one-sided horrible thing.
[00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:08.393]  The bottom line is they said there's no collusion.
[00:03:08.393 --> 00:03:10.675]  No collusion with Russia.
[00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:12.257]  You heard so much talk about
[00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:24.544]  Phone calls that my son made to me from this meeting that was set up by GPS Fusion, it looks like, which is the other side for those that don't know.
[00:03:24.544 --> 00:03:30.546]  And for a year I heard about phone calls went to a special number, unauthorized.
[00:03:30.546 --> 00:03:38.668]  And it would have been my son, Don, who's a good young man, who's gone through hell.
[00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:43.170]  And they were calls that must have been made by him before and after the meeting.
[00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.730]  Three calls.
[00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:52.656]  After massive study at work, they actually found who made the calls.
[00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:56.358]  One was a friend of ours, a real estate developer.
[00:03:56.358 --> 00:03:57.199]  Great guy.
[00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.380]  Most of you know him.
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.120]  Nice guy.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.122]  Loves our country.
[00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:03.583]  And the other one was the head of NASCAR.
[00:04:03.583 --> 00:04:05.064]  Two of them.
[00:04:05.064 --> 00:04:12.149]  So of the three calls that were so horrible that he had a meeting and he called me and then he had the meeting after,
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.642]  And he made two more calls.
[00:04:16.642 --> 00:04:21.284]  And they were written about like this little, little lines, couple of lines.
[00:04:21.284 --> 00:04:23.605]  Nobody wanted to admit it.
[00:04:23.605 --> 00:04:27.767]  Even last night, we had a great election.
[00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.648]  I went there on Monday.
[00:04:29.648 --> 00:04:34.891]  We had a, an election for Fred Keller.
[00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:38.173]  It was a 50-50 shot and he won in a landslide.
[00:04:39.315 --> 00:04:41.617]  We went and we did a rally.
[00:04:41.617 --> 00:04:44.520]  Hardly mentioned today.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.345]  And yet if he lost, it would have been the biggest story in the country, even bigger than this witch hunt.
[00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:56.432]  Ladies and gentlemen, strap yourselves in for this Thursday, May 23rd, 2019 transmission.
[00:04:56.432 --> 00:04:58.374]  It's gonna be one hell of a broadcast.
[00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:02.157]  Patriots are on the go.
[00:05:02.157 --> 00:05:06.881]  Hard-working Americans need high-quality energy when they're on the run.
[00:05:06.881 --> 00:05:17.348]  And ladies and gentlemen, we have spent years working with top developers to come out with the highest quality protein bar in vanilla coconut and chocolate peanut butter at InfoWarsLife.com.

[00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:21.347]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:22.828]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:06:29.577 --> 00:06:37.581]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:52.129]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems, and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:55.571]  Trans-dimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[00:06:55.931 --> 00:07:00.277]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[00:07:00.277 --> 00:07:02.399]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now reality.
[00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:06.828]  Well, the society unravels.
[00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:11.852]  Men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women.
[00:07:11.852 --> 00:07:18.357]  And they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed.
[00:07:18.357 --> 00:07:20.399]  It's fulfilling to be involved.
[00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:21.400]  It's fulfilling.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.481]  InfoWars.
[00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:23.662]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:07:23.662 --> 00:07:24.943]  Today.
[00:07:24.943 --> 00:07:26.964]  I'm picking up a fake transmission.
[00:07:26.964 --> 00:07:28.666]  I think it's on the news.
[00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:36.316]  But here's the good news, chumps.
[00:07:36.316 --> 00:07:39.718]  You think you're gonna assassinate Trump?
[00:07:39.718 --> 00:07:43.460]  Or shoot down the independent media and bully a bunch of us into going along with you?
[00:07:45.571 --> 00:07:46.811]  That's life reserve talking.
[00:07:46.811 --> 00:07:49.912]  Now, how many morons from here are willing to have a fight?
[00:07:49.912 --> 00:07:50.712]  21 at this point.
[00:07:50.712 --> 00:07:56.153]  And only the dumbest morons buy into your SJW globalist George Soros droppings.
[00:07:56.153 --> 00:07:56.693]  Stabilize.
[00:07:56.693 --> 00:07:57.933]  Emergency reserve.
[00:07:57.933 --> 00:08:00.814]  Hillary Clinton and the New World Order and Michael Moore.
[00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:04.074]  Go back to Hades where you came from.
[00:08:04.074 --> 00:08:07.615]  We're awake and you're not putting us back in the coma.
[00:08:07.615 --> 00:08:09.075]  You got that, Jack?
[00:08:09.075 --> 00:08:10.055]  You're done!
[00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:10.815]  It's over!
[00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:11.676]  Worldwide!
[00:08:11.676 --> 00:08:13.016]  Get him back!
[00:08:13.016 --> 00:08:13.876]  Get him back!
[00:08:20.407 --> 00:08:26.074]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live global broadcast May 23rd 2019 on this Thursday.
[00:08:26.074 --> 00:08:26.254]  Wow!
[00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:41.482]  I say it almost every day now.
[00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:41.842]  It's true.
[00:08:41.842 --> 00:08:44.023]  Just every day gets crazier.
[00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.003]  The news gets more insane.
[00:08:46.003 --> 00:08:55.327]  The global social engineers and their minions are now admitting that they hate children, hate mothers, hate families, hate God, hate civilization.
[00:08:55.327 --> 00:09:00.169]  They're extremely suicidal and nihilistic, but they want to take us with them.
[00:09:00.169 --> 00:09:02.270]  That's what globalism is, is a post
[00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:16.357]  Industrial post-human world, but they really mean to carry it out, but humanity is really awakening right now and striking back in so many ways.
[00:09:16.357 --> 00:09:32.561]  The tyranny of the EU is facing virtual annihilation politically with the six-week-old, he started talking about forming a year ago, but six-week-old
[00:09:34.565 --> 00:09:46.115]  Brexit campaign, and it's been picked up and it's been adopted all across Europe as a symbol of rebellion against EU tyranny.
[00:09:46.115 --> 00:09:49.938]  And how does Juncker, the unelected head of the EU, respond?
[00:09:49.938 --> 00:09:54.762]  We'll play the clip here in just a moment.
[00:09:54.762 --> 00:10:01.848]  Juncker lashes out at stupid nationalists on eve of European elections.
[00:10:04.554 --> 00:10:05.935]  Think about the arrogance.
[00:10:05.935 --> 00:10:08.416]  That's an actual quote.
[00:10:08.416 --> 00:10:28.025]  Think about the arrogance of Mayor de Blasio making similar statements, or AOC making similar statements, or people like Governor Cuomo making similar statements, or Mayor Kahn making statements about England.
[00:10:28.025 --> 00:10:33.047]  How do you have leaders in your own countries that say you suck because they're
[00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:34.890]  Usurpers.
[00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:44.014]  He told CNN that he lashed out at stupid nationalists, close quote, on the eve of the European elections.
[00:10:44.014 --> 00:10:45.555]  And he went further.
[00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:50.217]  He said they love their countries.
[00:10:50.217 --> 00:10:57.119]  Well, what else is going to stand up for you but heritage and rule of law invested in Western culture that's being erased?
[00:10:57.119 --> 00:11:00.321]  And then I think about the headlines.
[00:11:01.345 --> 00:11:10.532]  Where you see the New York Times, the Washington Post, BBC saying, if you don't like the European Union, you're a Nazi.
[00:11:10.532 --> 00:11:13.675]  Or if you claim there's a global government, you're a Nazi.
[00:11:13.675 --> 00:11:28.747]  When Juncker is the heir of the richest royal family of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, his grandfather took by force Luxembourg that he owns, per square mile, the richest country in the world,
[00:11:30.017 --> 00:11:32.939]  He is a literal super king.
[00:11:32.939 --> 00:11:36.561]  He sits on the unelected EU bureaucracy.
[00:11:36.561 --> 00:11:48.907]  They have a ceremonial parliament that is embarrassing them because the whole parliament is basically converting to anti-EU nationalist movements.
[00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:53.850]  So his answer is, we'll just abolish the parliament and put an EU army in every country.
[00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.072]  You're not leaving.
[00:11:57.072 --> 00:11:58.532]  And you think, that's crazy.
[00:11:58.532 --> 00:11:59.533]  He'll never get away with it.
[00:12:00.871 --> 00:12:07.155]  His grandfather was the second most powerful person in Germany.
[00:12:07.155 --> 00:12:12.478]  His father was in the SS.
[00:12:12.478 --> 00:12:17.561]  He owns Europe still, to a great extent.
[00:12:17.561 --> 00:12:22.624]  He only executed a few Nazis for show at the end of World War II.
[00:12:22.624 --> 00:12:25.966]  Brought most of them over here, 36,000, the rat line.
[00:12:25.966 --> 00:12:28.668]  And the richness of this, the stench of this,
[00:12:29.986 --> 00:12:32.849]  is ridiculous.
[00:12:32.849 --> 00:12:35.231]  It's insane.
[00:12:35.231 --> 00:12:36.412]  It's over the top.
[00:12:36.412 --> 00:12:41.176]  Hitler envisioned the European Union and its flag.
[00:12:41.176 --> 00:12:44.459]  Hitler designed the EU flag.
[00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:46.862]  Hitler designed the Volkswagen Beetle.
[00:12:46.862 --> 00:12:48.563]  Hitler designed the logo.
[00:12:48.563 --> 00:12:50.265]  Hitler designed the highways.
[00:12:50.265 --> 00:12:53.368]  Hitler developed the plan with Wernher von Braun for NASA.
[00:12:53.368 --> 00:12:53.728]  All of it.
[00:12:55.567 --> 00:13:14.066]  They think we're so stupid that a literal Nazi king, KING, sits on Europe just as Hitler envisioned Edward VIII, the German king who was in England, but once the war started,
[00:13:15.987 --> 00:13:22.531]  He stepped down as king and the plan didn't go as they had foreseen it because England wasn't supposed to come to the war.
[00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:24.793]  That's why never Chamberlain was standing down.
[00:13:24.793 --> 00:13:27.615]  And they had treaties and it's all been declassified.
[00:13:27.615 --> 00:13:31.217]  But the average person doesn't know mainline history.
[00:13:31.217 --> 00:13:34.620]  England was supposed to go with Hitler.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.421]  They had a peace treaty.
[00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:41.384]  And they were supposed to put a German king over the European Union.
[00:13:41.384 --> 00:13:44.026]  Juncker is a German royal.
[00:13:46.738 --> 00:13:50.240]  You cannot make up how ridiculous this is.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:14:00.467]  We have a stinking Nazi telling us we're stupid because we want our countries and don't want to be ruled by him.
[00:14:00.467 --> 00:14:03.409]  Here is a clip of Junker.
[00:14:03.409 --> 00:14:04.689]  You heard of the Junker bombers?
[00:14:04.689 --> 00:14:05.870]  The Junker factories?
[00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.491]  Yeah.
[00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:11.174]  Here's Junker telling you how the cow ate the cabbage.
[00:14:11.174 --> 00:14:11.494]  Here it is.
[00:14:12.867 --> 00:14:24.175]  People are looking at us as if we were a kind of peace god, because we have achieved on this continent what has not been achieved elsewhere.
[00:14:24.175 --> 00:14:30.419]  We have 60 wars, for the time being, globally spoken.
[00:14:30.419 --> 00:14:37.584]  None in Europe, apart Ukraine, which is part of Europe, but which is not part of the European Union.
[00:14:37.584 --> 00:14:41.107]  These populist nationalists, stupid nationalists,
[00:14:42.094 --> 00:14:44.376]  They are in love with their own country.
[00:14:44.376 --> 00:14:47.099]  And they don't like the others.
[00:14:47.099 --> 00:14:59.349]  In some countries of the European Union, the government, parliament, a major part of the society, don't like those coming from far away.
[00:14:59.349 --> 00:15:02.132]  I do like those coming from far away.
[00:15:03.032 --> 00:15:07.656]  Because the main guiding principle of the European Union should be solidarity.
[00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:09.257]  We have to act in solidarity.
[00:15:09.257 --> 00:15:10.298]  Okay, let's stop there.
[00:15:10.298 --> 00:15:11.259]  Let's translate that.
[00:15:11.259 --> 00:15:12.260]  It's pretty clear.
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:20.907]  We're going to bring in a bunch of foreigners that we totally control to outvote you and dominate you, because the European Union and global government is going to stop war.
[00:15:21.607 --> 00:15:27.390]  That's like Emperor Palpatine in Star Wars Episode IV saying, once we've taken over and killed everybody, there'll be peace.
[00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.491]  So it's a very, very sick world viewer.
[00:15:29.491 --> 00:15:35.014]  The end of Game of Thrones, he's gonna kill all the other leaders and take over so there'll be peace.
[00:15:35.014 --> 00:15:44.040]  I mean, this is classic dictator stuff, megalomaniac stuff, and there it is coming out of Yunker's fat, disgusting, pig-like mouth.
[00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.580]  My God!
[00:15:45.788 --> 00:15:47.931]  His father should have been executed.
[00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:50.015]  His grandfather should have been executed.
[00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:52.599]  Juncker should be thrown in chains.
[00:15:52.599 --> 00:15:54.141]  These are criminal Nazis.
[00:15:54.141 --> 00:15:55.203]  The real thing.
[00:15:55.203 --> 00:15:56.585]  The real thing.
[00:15:56.585 --> 00:15:57.226]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:57.226 --> 00:15:57.566]  Stay with us.
[00:15:59.286 --> 00:16:01.488]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.
[00:16:01.488 --> 00:16:02.790]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:03.791]  Hey, whatcha doin'?
[00:16:03.791 --> 00:16:04.872]  Mother's Day, remember?
[00:16:04.872 --> 00:16:05.212]  Oh, yeah.
[00:16:05.212 --> 00:16:09.536]  So I'm making lists, gotta plan a trip to the store, then need to save all the receipts in case she wants to return.

[00:17:28.607 --> 00:17:34.952]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:34.952 --> 00:17:37.994]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:37.994 --> 00:17:43.919]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:47.722]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.722 --> 00:17:48.983]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:48.983 --> 00:17:50.324]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.324 --> 00:17:56.529]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.529 --> 00:17:57.970]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:18:00.703 --> 00:18:04.307]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:04.307 --> 00:18:06.089]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:06.089 --> 00:18:18.141]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:18.141 --> 00:18:23.167]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs,
[00:18:23.607 --> 00:18:33.272]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:33.272 --> 00:18:37.834]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:40.976 --> 00:18:42.696]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.696 --> 00:18:52.699]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.699 --> 00:18:55.340]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:00.041]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[00:19:02.432 --> 00:19:07.034]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.

[00:20:03.304 --> 00:20:05.920]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:38.297 --> 00:20:39.438]  Welcome back.
[00:20:39.438 --> 00:20:42.221]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:20:42.221 --> 00:20:42.742]  to 3 p.m.
[00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:43.162]  live.
[00:20:43.162 --> 00:20:45.184]  Then Owen Schroer with The War Room.
[00:20:45.184 --> 00:20:46.766]  David Knight, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[00:20:46.766 --> 00:20:50.590]  I'll be back Sunday, of course, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.592]  as we are always doing a live show.
[00:20:52.592 --> 00:20:57.157]  And by then, the elections would have all closed.
[00:20:57.157 --> 00:20:59.820]  The polls open in many European countries today.
[00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:08.288]  And they will then roll on out from there right through until Sunday.
[00:21:10.447 --> 00:21:13.288]  And so we will then have the results for you.
[00:21:13.288 --> 00:21:17.428]  The EU, of course, has been caught engaging in a lot of election fraud.
[00:21:17.428 --> 00:21:27.050]  They've been caught bringing in millions of foreigners and then allowing them to vote in an attempt to break the back of Europe's sovereignty and culture.
[00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.271]  The globalists don't want there to be any culture or any system that can stand alone.
[00:21:31.271 --> 00:21:34.552]  They want the globalist anti-human culture of death.
[00:21:36.141 --> 00:21:49.625]  And many experts are believing that this is going to signal virtual annihilation, not just for the European Union, but for Theresa May and others.
[00:21:49.625 --> 00:21:57.128]  PM May facing annihilation by Nigel Farage's Brexit party in EU elections.
[00:21:57.128 --> 00:22:05.010]  A lot of people say, oh, you voted two and a half years ago, three years ago, to pull out of the unelected European Union that just
[00:22:06.368 --> 00:22:12.849]  Tricked the UK and others into so-called trade deals that were really global government deals.
[00:22:12.849 --> 00:22:14.490]  And so, oh look, you're pathetic.
[00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.510]  In three years, you can't get out of it.
[00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.071]  That's only pissed people off more.
[00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:28.113]  That's only made more people wake up in Europe to the EU and how authoritarian it is and how it's trying to destroy the cultures and how it's trying to create a permanent welfare state.
[00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:32.234]  And so the people are now rebelling in a giant way.
[00:22:33.339 --> 00:22:44.003]  And the system is reeling, it's sounding the alarm, it's calling for banning any form of nationalism, any form of Christianity now.
[00:22:44.003 --> 00:23:02.371]  The socialists, the globalists, the technocrats, the big tech heads, the big bank heads are now saying, listen, the only way to win and beat these people is just end the free press and bring in total authoritarianism and bring in a European Union army that will rule over everyone.
[00:23:03.726 --> 00:23:06.467]  And that is the plan.
[00:23:06.467 --> 00:23:09.029]  That is the operation.
[00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:29.759]  And this cannot be under-calculated how big and how important this is and how this is another giant nail in the globalist coffin for their larger
[00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:32.990]  Operations.
[00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:40.976]  But I'm going to wait till next segment to cover this because we have to come in with Beowulf for something that's important.
[00:23:40.976 --> 00:23:45.539]  We have to have war drums to announce something that's positive.
[00:23:45.539 --> 00:23:50.522]  I have to have the right music when I come into these segments or I just can't do the show anymore, actually.
[00:23:52.405 --> 00:23:54.767]  It's just a neuroses I have now.
[00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:58.169]  Big sarcastic folks, that'll be a new headline across the country.
[00:23:58.169 --> 00:24:06.455]  But no, seriously, more and more I realize that I can't just come on air and just start spewing these truth bombs and hardcore info.
[00:24:06.455 --> 00:24:09.817]  I need to build this up.
[00:24:09.817 --> 00:24:19.444]  Because what's historically happening is so earth shattering.
[00:24:19.444 --> 00:24:19.664]  That
[00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:25.773]  I just don't even know what to say.
[00:24:25.773 --> 00:24:28.675]  It's beautiful.
[00:24:28.675 --> 00:24:34.439]  And if you look at what's happening across the world, all the globalists are doing is losing.
[00:24:38.937 --> 00:24:42.119]  All the globalists are doing is failing.
[00:24:42.119 --> 00:24:57.109]  Oh, they're throwing temper tantrums, and they're killing people, and they're flooding borders with disease, and they're trying to turn the chessboard over, but they are losing in the final equation in a huge way.
[00:24:57.109 --> 00:25:06.795]  And we should talk about the chronicle of what's happened in the last few years, and what I think's coming next, and open the phones up and get your take on what you think's coming next.
[00:25:08.177 --> 00:25:15.458]  We have always informative Robert Barnes, lawyer, constitutional lawyer, joining us to cover a whole host of big news developments.
[00:25:15.458 --> 00:25:17.599]  And then Millie Weaver is here in town, one of our great reporters.
[00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:23.000]  She's also going to be in studio with us for part of the third hour today.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.601]  And then out from that, we have Matt Bracken in the fourth hour.
[00:25:27.601 --> 00:25:30.521]  Always very important information that he covers.
[00:25:30.521 --> 00:25:33.622]  But when we come back, I'm really going to do my best.
[00:25:36.704 --> 00:25:46.430]  To give you, not a pep talk, not what I want you to hear, but what I really think is going on and what I know is going on.
[00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:53.975]  And I respect the listeners, I respect all of our guests, I respect my crew and the work they do.
[00:25:53.975 --> 00:25:59.259]  I really try to tell you how I think things are really going.
[00:25:59.259 --> 00:26:02.861]  And I think I've done a pretty good job so far of being accurate.
[00:26:02.861 --> 00:26:05.123]  So I'm gonna tell you the positives and I'm gonna tell you the negatives.
[00:26:06.124 --> 00:26:13.368]  And then I want to get your take on the type of curveballs the globalists could throw at us.
[00:26:13.368 --> 00:26:33.879]  That said, if the globalists are able to take out our leadership around the world, the nationalist populist leadership, in media, in academia, in government, and in finance, and in spirituality, Christianity, they will be successful.
[00:26:33.879 --> 00:26:35.460]  It's the only shot they've got.
[00:26:36.841 --> 00:26:47.324]  And as each day goes by, the more blood runs out of them, the more behind they are, the more hopeless their case becomes.
[00:26:47.324 --> 00:26:59.688]  But they could sabotage things and bring the whole system down because they can't beat us, which has been their long-term plan anyways, with the Cloward and Piven type strategies and stratagems and gambits.
[00:26:59.688 --> 00:27:03.889]  So we're going to look at all of it here today, but this is the most critical information.
[00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:06.110]  This EU election,
[00:27:07.304 --> 00:27:13.568]  Even though the parliament is ceremonial to the dictatorship, is a complete referendum on them.
[00:27:13.568 --> 00:27:31.318]  And remember, parliamentary elections go where it's nearly impossible to ever have one group completely sweep 50%, but a 45% that's chronicled and projected and forecast for Brexit is at 45%.
[00:27:31.318 --> 00:27:31.978]  That is ultra devastating.
[00:27:35.287 --> 00:27:41.552]  Then there's five or six other nationalist populist parties that are set to get around 15 to 20 percent.
[00:27:41.552 --> 00:27:58.986]  You're talking upwards of 60 plus percent sliding into populism, nationalism, what makes us great, what creates real diversity, what creates firewalls between tyrannies that try to spread.
[00:28:00.851 --> 00:28:01.792]  Checks and balances.
[00:28:01.792 --> 00:28:15.760]  So this is a big, big, big, big deal and the globalists are already running around like chickens with their heads cut off freaking out, but they are going to go into insane mode, I believe, when this happens.
[00:28:17.031 --> 00:28:24.016]  And so, everybody better strap themselves in because we are not in Kansas anymore, as I like to say.
[00:28:24.016 --> 00:28:26.177]  We are not in Kansas anymore.
[00:28:26.177 --> 00:28:33.182]  And hey, global government tried to take down the world, sell us out to the chi-coms, break up our families, and they've wounded the hell out of us.
[00:28:33.182 --> 00:28:34.403]  We're hurt.
[00:28:34.403 --> 00:28:39.226]  We're half poisoned, culturally and spiritually and physically, but we're coming back.
[00:28:39.226 --> 00:28:42.589]  And once you know you've been poisoned, and once you know who did it,
[00:28:43.547 --> 00:28:47.890]  We can get our hands, metaphysically, around their throats.
[00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:49.891]  And we have got our hands around their throats now.
[00:28:49.891 --> 00:28:58.056]  So, let's just sprint to the finish and squeeze, squeeze, squeeze, lovingly, politically, until the enemy's heart stops.
[00:28:59.176 --> 00:29:03.738]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:29:03.738 --> 00:29:05.838]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:29:05.838 --> 00:29:07.559]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:14.121]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.

[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.063]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[00:31:03.063 --> 00:31:05.645]  That what God gave us through Mother Nature is incredible.
[00:31:05.645 --> 00:31:08.427]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[00:31:08.427 --> 00:31:10.429]  And the globalists are so upset.
[00:31:10.429 --> 00:31:13.252]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[00:31:14.485 --> 00:31:19.549]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:20.530]  So we looked at that.
[00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.152]  We made the very best a.m.

[00:32:01.621 --> 00:32:07.124]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[00:32:07.124 --> 00:32:14.627]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[00:32:14.627 --> 00:32:15.947]  Are you coming back?
[00:32:15.947 --> 00:32:17.088]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[00:32:17.688 --> 00:32:19.070]  We're at newswars.com.
[00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:21.293]  Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news.
[00:32:21.293 --> 00:32:22.254]  We have our own videos.
[00:32:22.254 --> 00:32:23.075]  We have our own articles.
[00:32:23.075 --> 00:32:28.061]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[00:32:28.061 --> 00:32:30.324]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:32:30.324 --> 00:32:33.609]  InfoWars.com, man!
[00:32:33.609 --> 00:32:33.969]  Woo!
[00:32:36.681 --> 00:32:41.265]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here talking about InfoWars.com.
[00:32:41.265 --> 00:32:43.987]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:32:43.987 --> 00:32:46.208]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[00:32:46.208 --> 00:32:49.731]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:52.473]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[00:32:52.473 --> 00:32:54.735]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:32:54.735 --> 00:32:55.756]  That's where they find it.
[00:32:55.756 --> 00:32:57.717]  You know, there's things called websites.
[00:32:57.717 --> 00:32:58.118]  Just go there.
[00:33:03.254 --> 00:33:17.217]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:17.217 --> 00:33:24.038]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:33:24.038 --> 00:33:26.259]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:33:28.444 --> 00:33:33.645]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:59.341 --> 00:34:00.922]  This is it.
[00:34:00.922 --> 00:34:03.063]  This isn't a Netflix show.
[00:34:03.063 --> 00:34:05.164]  It's not Dungeons and Dragons.
[00:34:05.164 --> 00:34:07.105]  It's not Mario Brothers.
[00:34:07.105 --> 00:34:09.486]  It's not Donkey Kong.
[00:34:09.486 --> 00:34:11.567]  It's not LARPing in the park.
[00:34:11.567 --> 00:34:13.287]  This is it.
[00:34:13.287 --> 00:34:15.468]  Powerful forces.
[00:34:15.468 --> 00:34:20.251]  Technocrats want complete control over every facet of your life.
[00:34:20.251 --> 00:34:23.752]  They want to track and trace and monitor your every movement.
[00:34:23.752 --> 00:34:24.713]  Not to empower you.
[00:34:25.523 --> 00:34:32.648]  But to game the system to build a post-human world in their own words.
[00:34:32.648 --> 00:34:35.089]  Thank you again for joining us.
[00:34:35.089 --> 00:34:39.292]  The numbers are in.
[00:34:39.292 --> 00:34:54.122]  Anti-EU, pro-capitalist, pro-sovereignty parties are set to sweep 60 plus percent of the parliamentary elections that are about to happen.
[00:34:55.066 --> 00:35:01.728]  These elections are staggered, just like our senatorial elections are.
[00:35:01.728 --> 00:35:18.372]  And so for there to be a slide of that number is unprecedented and is going to be a devastating referendum against the unelected EU tyranny that is the literal brainchild of Adolf Hitler.
[00:35:19.468 --> 00:35:33.139]  That just adds to the bizarreness when you criticize the EU, they say you're a Nazi, when the heir to the Nazi empire sits upon the unelected EU.
[00:35:33.139 --> 00:35:35.501]  Junker.
[00:35:35.501 --> 00:35:39.604]  Yes, you cannot make this stuff up.
[00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:43.807]  That's why they say, truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:35:43.807 --> 00:35:45.609]  Now everyone seems to be
[00:35:47.085 --> 00:35:51.327]  Focused on the UK because it's trying to pull out with Brexit.
[00:35:51.327 --> 00:36:01.811]  But notice how they're not giving England the exit it wanted three years ago, has created a Brexit party that's set to win 40 plus percent of the seats.
[00:36:01.811 --> 00:36:14.937]  And then it'll be UKIP and other nationalist parties that win the others in European elections that are happening today, tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday, depending on the country.
[00:36:14.937 --> 00:36:16.278]  They're happening today in the UK.
[00:36:17.756 --> 00:36:20.937]  We're going to be here live tonight, live tomorrow night.
[00:36:20.937 --> 00:36:29.019]  We're going to be here this weekend, and we're going to do extended coverage during Sunday, right up through the 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:36:29.019 --> 00:36:41.342]  regularly scheduled Sunday update that I've been doing for 12 years, doing the syndicated show for 20 plus, the weekday show, but 11, 12 years now, because so much news breaks on the weekend.
[00:36:41.342 --> 00:36:44.843]  We're going to be here, and this election is just as important as Trump's election.
[00:36:47.415 --> 00:36:53.297]  It was the nationalist movement, the patriot movement that got its embryonic start here.
[00:36:53.297 --> 00:36:54.998]  Nigel Farage has said that.
[00:36:54.998 --> 00:37:04.202]  In the early days of UKIP, he's been coming on the show almost 20 years, half their support when he'd knock on doors in England was from InfoWars.
[00:37:04.202 --> 00:37:06.043]  They had no media coverage, nothing.
[00:37:06.043 --> 00:37:07.903]  InfoWars was their coverage.
[00:37:07.903 --> 00:37:12.365]  InfoWars was in the top 50 websites back then in England.
[00:37:12.365 --> 00:37:13.726]  It's in the top couple hundred right now.
[00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:15.763]  Because they had no independent press.
[00:37:15.763 --> 00:37:17.924]  I'm not bragging.
[00:37:17.924 --> 00:37:19.185]  It's the fact that we were there.
[00:37:19.185 --> 00:37:21.367]  There was something there.
[00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:24.289]  And they heard Paul Watson on the show.
[00:37:24.289 --> 00:37:28.071]  And they heard all the other great folks from Ireland and Scotland that we had on.
[00:37:28.071 --> 00:37:31.874]  And of course now we have europewars.com.
[00:37:31.874 --> 00:37:33.435]  And Paul has summit.news.
[00:37:33.435 --> 00:37:36.837]  But that shows why Hillary came after us.
[00:37:36.837 --> 00:37:39.199]  That shows why they're trying to censor us everywhere.
[00:37:39.199 --> 00:37:41.480]  That's why they're calling us hate figures.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:41.981]  Is because.
[00:37:44.654 --> 00:38:05.403]  The genesis, the genesis of the movements we see today from Brazil, to Nigeria, to Japan, to Greece, to Italy, to Spain, to the UK, to everywhere, is incredible.
[00:38:08.717 --> 00:38:10.878]  The German Chancellor is a lame duck.
[00:38:10.878 --> 00:38:12.199]  Her party is out of power.
[00:38:12.199 --> 00:38:17.802]  But the way the German parliamentary system works, she'll still be in office for another year and a few months.
[00:38:17.802 --> 00:38:19.183]  And again, it's happening everywhere.
[00:38:19.183 --> 00:38:26.807]  If I chronicle it all, it'll take the whole show, but they are getting their asses handed to them.
[00:38:26.807 --> 00:38:29.868]  Now, it's not fun if you're a Donald Trump.
[00:38:29.868 --> 00:38:38.133]  It's not fun if you're an Alex Jones to have the lawsuits and the audits and the harassment and the demonization and to have your family harassed.
[00:38:39.093 --> 00:38:41.114]  And I'm not a victim.
[00:38:41.114 --> 00:38:42.015]  I'm a target.
[00:38:42.015 --> 00:38:44.916]  I'm an overcomer, thanks to your support and God's support.
[00:38:44.916 --> 00:38:46.477]  And so are you.
[00:38:46.477 --> 00:38:49.739]  But it is important to point out how criminal these people are.
[00:38:50.438 --> 00:38:55.983]  How the IRS persecuted more than 50,000 conservatives under Obama.
[00:38:55.983 --> 00:38:58.725]  And admittedly, did it for political purposes.
[00:38:58.725 --> 00:39:08.753]  They harassed law enforcement organizations, fraternal groups, veterans groups, pro-gun groups, pro-nationalist groups, pro-Christian groups, anti-abortion groups.
[00:39:08.753 --> 00:39:09.674]  We're audited.
[00:39:09.674 --> 00:39:11.695]  We're harassed.
[00:39:11.695 --> 00:39:13.036]  We're set up.
[00:39:13.036 --> 00:39:15.018]  We're put in jail.
[00:39:15.018 --> 00:39:17.300]  And now, in 2019,
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:30.042]  Hillary Clinton's law firm, WilmerHale, that she runs, is savagely attacking me on every front, but we're still here strong because of your support.
[00:39:30.042 --> 00:39:32.543]  They don't even know what to do.
[00:39:32.543 --> 00:39:44.766]  But with this fight comes a great cost, and if you look at all the strategies of the enemy, it's to attack the family, demoralize the nation, break down the nation, flood the nation with foreigners,
[00:39:47.603 --> 00:39:59.066]  Attack our power source, God, so that we get God out of our lives, Jesus Christ, and attack fathers and mothers, and attack leaders.
[00:39:59.066 --> 00:40:03.287]  So, I want to explain something here.
[00:40:03.287 --> 00:40:13.309]  An exhausted part of me, at a subconscious level sometimes, wants to be taken out of the game, and wants to get, you know, my leg broken politically, so I can at least rest.
[00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:15.890]  But my spirit wants to keep going and fighting even harder.
[00:40:16.673 --> 00:40:19.894]  My flesh does not enjoy this.
[00:40:19.894 --> 00:40:24.774]  But my spirit begs God to keep me in this fight.
[00:40:24.774 --> 00:40:28.475]  And my spirit begs you to keep me in the game.
[00:40:28.475 --> 00:40:33.676]  Because we need to be here, working hard, a platform for others that are deplatformed.
[00:40:33.676 --> 00:40:39.537]  We need to be a platform to get the truth out during crises that are coming, during false flags, during major events.
[00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:44.478]  I know InfoWars is now more critical than it's ever been.
[00:40:44.478 --> 00:40:45.158]  But I have to tell you,
[00:40:47.048 --> 00:41:14.354]  Without you, fervently, and religiously, and compulsively, in a committed, habituated way, in a habit, spreading the word about Infowars.com and Newswars.com, and about how we're verboten, and how people should find out for themselves, using the Streisand effect against the enemy, and without you buying the products, and without you supporting local stations, we will not be on the air in a year.
[00:41:14.354 --> 00:41:15.134]  Can you imagine
[00:41:16.205 --> 00:41:18.394]  A world like that.
[00:41:18.394 --> 00:41:20.464]  No, ladies and gentlemen, I certainly can't.
[00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.661]  So we need your support now more than ever.
[00:41:23.661 --> 00:41:28.705]  I need everybody listening to go to m4workstore.com and sign up for AutoShip.
[00:41:28.705 --> 00:41:32.748]  Get our toothpaste with colloidal silver and iodine fortified, fluoride-free.
[00:41:32.748 --> 00:41:34.750]  It's concentrated, no fillers.
[00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:35.750]  It's amazing.
[00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.912]  Get our Wake Up America coffee.
[00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:40.434]  Sign up for AutoShip, an additional 10% off.
[00:41:40.434 --> 00:41:44.437]  Next time you order, it just puts it on AutoShip and cancels any time for free.
[00:41:44.437 --> 00:41:49.041]  That way you don't forget to support, because I'm the very same way myself.
[00:41:51.601 --> 00:42:03.328]  I tend to give to charities every year, just a few charities, and I tend to forget, so I put it in my Google Calendar so that I remember every November to give a donation in December.
[00:42:03.328 --> 00:42:04.308]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:42:04.308 --> 00:42:13.053]  Get the coffee, get the turmeric, get the bone broth formula, get the fish oil, get the vitamin mineral fusion fruit punch, great for adults, great for kids.
[00:42:13.053 --> 00:42:14.034]  All of this is win-win.
[00:42:14.034 --> 00:42:15.595]  These are things that are good for you and your family.
[00:42:16.215 --> 00:42:16.315]  Yes.
[00:42:34.795 --> 00:42:45.181]  And we can't expand in the face of the enemy, but we're doing it and believing that God will provide and provision us through you by touching your conscience and your soul to commit and double down.
[00:42:45.181 --> 00:42:46.222]  I salute you.
[00:42:46.222 --> 00:42:47.563]  I thank you for your previous support.
[00:42:47.563 --> 00:42:50.144]  But I tell you now, you can see the results.
[00:42:50.144 --> 00:42:51.265]  We're beginning to really win.
[00:42:51.265 --> 00:42:54.267]  But the enemy is targeting the Liberty leadership.
[00:42:54.267 --> 00:42:57.049]  And I am the second most targeted person in the world.
[00:42:59.306 --> 00:43:04.488]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us, and it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[00:43:04.488 --> 00:43:13.071]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[00:43:13.071 --> 00:43:16.052]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[00:43:16.052 --> 00:43:17.792]  How can I solve that problem?
[00:43:17.792 --> 00:43:24.054]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.
[00:43:26.155 --> 00:43:31.477]  The Alexa Pure Breeze Groundbreaking Ion Cluster Air Filter Technology.
[00:43:31.477 --> 00:43:34.439]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[00:43:34.439 --> 00:43:38.020]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:42.342]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[00:43:42.342 --> 00:43:44.163]  I've got two in my home.
[00:43:44.163 --> 00:43:50.265]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[00:43:50.265 --> 00:43:51.106]  Don't live

[00:43:55.989 --> 00:43:57.250]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:43:59.366 --> 00:44:11.176]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[00:44:11.176 --> 00:44:17.362]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[00:44:17.362 --> 00:44:19.544]  And it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[00:44:19.544 --> 00:44:23.667]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:31.236]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally.
[00:44:31.236 --> 00:44:41.950]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:44.693]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.

[00:44:49.559 --> 00:44:52.423]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.

[00:46:00.359 --> 00:46:11.444]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[00:46:11.444 --> 00:46:20.308]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[00:46:20.308 --> 00:46:24.290]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:31.453]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[00:46:31.453 --> 00:46:33.633]  And you may be experiencing backup too.
[00:46:33.633 --> 00:46:39.556]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to Infowarsstore.com and get Oxy-Powder.
[00:46:39.556 --> 00:46:42.117]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.

[00:46:53.199 --> 00:47:02.821]  So go to Infowarsstore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with Oxy-Powder.
[00:47:02.821 --> 00:47:05.501]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:47.035]  Did you ever think just five years ago that every globalist candidate in the world would be being thrown out of office
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:56.642]  That the Pope would be fighting back by calling for world government to force planetary carbon taxes.
[00:47:56.642 --> 00:48:14.427]  That you would see the globalist unelected EU in its own parliament elections facing 60 plus percent of their minions being swept from office in a single election that runs for the next three days and starts today.
[00:48:16.383 --> 00:48:23.127]  What an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:23.127 --> 00:48:29.932]  But the establishment is going to then make its move against free speech.
[00:48:29.932 --> 00:48:39.598]  And then once they've silenced you, they can then lie about you, and that is their plan.
[00:48:39.598 --> 00:48:42.319]  That is their goal.
[00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:44.201]  That is their template.
[00:48:45.481 --> 00:48:48.423]  That is their program.
[00:48:48.423 --> 00:49:01.050]  But think about the arrogance of Juncker, the unelected head of the EU bureaucracy, that took over all these nations and almost none of them even voted to join the EU.
[00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:08.875]  They just woke up in these so-called trade deals like NAFTA and GATT and the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Trump got us out of.
[00:49:08.875 --> 00:49:11.157]  Well, this was a similar deal.
[00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:11.737]  Similar model.
[00:49:14.704 --> 00:49:19.086]  And he said that people who love their country are, quote, stupid?
[00:49:19.086 --> 00:49:23.529]  And he said that nationalists are stupid?
[00:49:23.529 --> 00:49:25.890]  And he said we need to bring everyone in and be inclusive.
[00:49:25.890 --> 00:49:26.670]  Yes.
[00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:36.956]  We need to bring in uneducated people, the lowest rung from third world, the lowest educated, the highest crime rates from the third world.
[00:49:36.956 --> 00:49:40.978]  So the bottom of the barrel of the third world.
[00:49:40.978 --> 00:49:44.080]  Bring them in and then teach them to hate their country
[00:49:45.247 --> 00:49:49.390]  That they now live in and have an SJW chip on their shoulder.
[00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:53.853]  This is the program being run all over the world.
[00:49:53.853 --> 00:50:05.120]  The establishment knows that if they push racism and can get majority minorities to adopt that, that they won't want freedom.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.302]  They won't want free market.
[00:50:07.302 --> 00:50:10.024]  They won't want things like that.
[00:50:11.499 --> 00:50:13.080]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.862]  They will just want the racial identity.
[00:50:15.862 --> 00:50:19.044]  Just like the final episode of Game of Thrones.
[00:50:19.044 --> 00:50:20.585]  The writers are telling you how the world really works.
[00:50:20.585 --> 00:50:27.429]  They say, people don't fight and die or build civilizations and societies for gold.
[00:50:27.429 --> 00:50:30.151]  They don't do it for flags.
[00:50:30.151 --> 00:50:32.573]  They do it for stories.
[00:50:32.573 --> 00:50:34.034]  They do it for an ethos.
[00:50:35.717 --> 00:50:53.267]  And so if they can remove the ethos of free market and truly open society and fathers and mothers and cultures and people being welded together through a shared belief in freedom and renaissance and the West that was the light in the dark.
[00:50:53.267 --> 00:50:55.549]  If they can do that, they've won.
[00:50:56.451 --> 00:51:03.035]  And so that's why all the different Democrats and all the different globalists and all the different UN people tell you nation-states are bad.
[00:51:03.035 --> 00:51:14.023]  When Trump said it's good to have a nation, it's good to have your own country, it's good to have a people that stand up for themselves and have a shared system of values, instead of being ruled by some far-off thing you don't know.
[00:51:14.023 --> 00:51:18.606]  That's going back to 1776 and saying no to King George.
[00:51:18.606 --> 00:51:25.110]  But the governor of New York and the unelected dictator of the EU, the grandson of the number two Nazi, literally,
[00:51:28.607 --> 00:51:32.590]  Says that you're stupid.
[00:51:32.590 --> 00:51:34.712]  And that if you like a nation state, you're stupid.
[00:51:34.712 --> 00:51:39.055]  And if you care about your country, you're stupid.
[00:51:39.055 --> 00:51:42.978]  See, they have to get around to that at a certain point.
[00:51:42.978 --> 00:51:51.244]  So in amongst all the articles they've had the last month saying Alex Jones isn't racist.
[00:51:51.244 --> 00:51:52.085]  Alex Jones is bad.
[00:51:52.085 --> 00:51:55.968]  He says there's a global government that's going to have a carbon tax over everything you do.
[00:51:57.421 --> 00:52:03.683]  And the Pope comes out and says, I want global governance, global government, and a carbon tax over all human activity.
[00:52:03.683 --> 00:52:07.484]  And humans are bad.
[00:52:07.484 --> 00:52:12.146]  And the devil's not real.
[00:52:12.146 --> 00:52:13.706]  Isn't that what the devil would tell you?
[00:52:13.706 --> 00:52:15.607]  So here's Cuomo before I play Juncker.
[00:52:15.607 --> 00:52:17.508]  Here it is.
[00:52:17.508 --> 00:52:20.589]  We're not gonna make America great again.
[00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:21.549]  It was never that great.
[00:52:24.465 --> 00:52:25.386]  Let's hear to that.
[00:52:25.386 --> 00:52:29.529]  We have not reached greatness.
[00:52:29.529 --> 00:52:37.535]  We will reach greatness when every American is fully engaged.
[00:52:37.535 --> 00:52:49.325]  We will reach greatness when discrimination and stereotyping against women, 51% of our population, is gone.
[00:52:49.325 --> 00:52:50.666]  That's all the left does.
[00:52:50.666 --> 00:52:53.048]  That's all they teach at colleges is how to have a chip on your shoulder.
[00:52:54.141 --> 00:53:05.649]  And how your identity is that you're persecuted, your identity is that people are being mean to you, but you're fighting to get into this country, so you can then bitch and complain all day.
[00:53:05.649 --> 00:53:07.811]  So America is not going to be great.
[00:53:07.811 --> 00:53:10.232]  It was never that great.
[00:53:10.232 --> 00:53:11.653]  He wants you to be demoralized.
[00:53:11.653 --> 00:53:17.257]  He wants your identity to be that you suck, so the chi-coms and the globalists can come in and run your life.
[00:53:17.257 --> 00:53:23.061]  Because here, you've got a real stake in private property and values and freedom.
[00:53:23.061 --> 00:53:23.422]  Not there.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.921]  Not in his world system.
[00:53:25.921 --> 00:53:36.309]  Here's Juncker, the literal heir to the most powerful royal family under Hitler, to the biggest munitions company owners.
[00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:39.392]  Bombers, fighters, jet aircraft.
[00:53:39.392 --> 00:53:41.774]  They were making jet aircraft in World War II.
[00:53:41.774 --> 00:53:44.156]  So was Messerschmitt.
[00:53:44.156 --> 00:53:50.941]  And space planes, and ICBMs they were developing at the end of the war.
[00:53:50.941 --> 00:53:51.602]  Here's this guy.
[00:53:52.745 --> 00:53:56.549]  Telling you how much being a European sucks, and how you're stupid.
[00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:58.490]  Here it is.
[00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:05.317]  These populist nationalists, stupid nationalists, they are in love with their own country.
[00:54:05.317 --> 00:54:08.019]  And they don't like the others.
[00:54:08.019 --> 00:54:15.927]  In some countries of the European Union, the government, the parliament, a major part of the society,
[00:54:17.714 --> 00:54:20.255]  Don't like those coming from far away.
[00:54:20.255 --> 00:54:28.577]  I do like those coming from far away, because the main guiding principle of the European Union should be solidarity.
[00:54:28.577 --> 00:54:33.539]  We have to act in solidarity with those who are in the worst situation.
[00:54:33.539 --> 00:54:40.741]  But that message... The Parliament, the people don't like open border.
[00:54:41.766 --> 00:54:43.047]  That's what he said.
[00:54:43.047 --> 00:54:46.388]  They don't like it, but I like it.
[00:54:46.388 --> 00:54:48.089]  So we do it.
[00:54:48.089 --> 00:54:50.149]  Yeah?
[00:54:50.149 --> 00:54:53.671]  Luxembourg, not like my grandfather, take it over.
[00:54:53.671 --> 00:54:55.832]  It's mine now.
[00:54:55.832 --> 00:54:57.633]  I own it.
[00:54:57.633 --> 00:54:59.873]  My grandfather killed lots of people.
[00:54:59.873 --> 00:55:02.835]  My father killed lots of people for it.
[00:55:02.835 --> 00:55:10.758]  And so I bring in... Our principle is, I bring in the Muslims, they get stuff free, they burn your car, rape your daughter.
[00:55:12.102 --> 00:55:13.884]  I like it.
[00:55:13.884 --> 00:55:16.507]  I like to conquer Europe.
[00:55:16.507 --> 00:55:21.032]  My granddaddy tried, and now I do it.
[00:55:21.032 --> 00:55:25.878]  I'm a liberal, unelected head of EU dictatorship.
[00:55:29.301 --> 00:55:34.646]  You cannot make this level of crap up.
[00:55:34.646 --> 00:55:35.828]  By the way, you think I'm joking?
[00:55:35.828 --> 00:55:38.490]  Just type in, it's AP, Reuters, everywhere, the last two days.
[00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:47.319]  Pope calls for global governance and a world government system to save the earth in the next 12 years.
[00:55:47.319 --> 00:55:50.022]  Oh, the AOC, Beto O'Rourke,
[00:55:52.711 --> 00:55:53.731]  Cory Booker line.
[00:55:53.731 --> 00:55:57.993]  And then now AOC came out and said, oh, I was joking.
[00:55:57.993 --> 00:55:59.314]  Oh, they have a poll though.
[00:55:59.314 --> 00:56:03.076]  Two thirds of millennials believe she's right.
[00:56:03.076 --> 00:56:04.977]  It's ending in 12 years.
[00:56:04.977 --> 00:56:11.120]  But she said, you'd have to be a, you'd have to have the intellect of a sea sponge.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:13.501]  Where'd she come up with that?
[00:56:13.501 --> 00:56:14.281]  A sea sponge.
[00:56:14.281 --> 00:56:18.903]  Guess it doesn't have any central nervous system.
[00:56:18.903 --> 00:56:19.964]  Wonder who wrote that line for her.
[00:56:21.007 --> 00:56:23.429]  To believe she meant the world's really ending in 12 years.
[00:56:23.429 --> 00:56:27.972]  Really, Al Gore said in 10 years all the coastal cities would be flooded.
[00:56:27.972 --> 00:56:32.695]  In 2003, he then went out and bought mansions right on the beach in two places.
[00:56:32.695 --> 00:56:35.256]  Of course, sea levels actually stayed the same the next 10 years.
[00:56:35.256 --> 00:56:38.078]  So, no lady, you said it.
[00:56:38.078 --> 00:56:40.199]  There's the article on newswars.com.
[00:56:40.199 --> 00:56:41.140]  Get it out to folks.
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:41.920]  It'll wake them up.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.003]  Most Democrats believe Cortez's claim.
[00:56:46.003 --> 00:56:49.986]  She said that only a sea sponge would believe.
[00:56:50.799 --> 00:56:56.444]  The freshman congresswoman also doubled down on the claim in April.
[00:56:56.444 --> 00:57:00.908]  So she goes out and gives a speech about not having to work ever again and everything's going to be free.
[00:57:00.908 --> 00:57:01.688]  People reject it.
[00:57:01.688 --> 00:57:03.730]  She says it was a typo.
[00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:06.352]  Then she said her Twitter was hacked.
[00:57:06.352 --> 00:57:07.754]  And then she said, OK, I said it.
[00:57:08.507 --> 00:57:10.928]  Well, then she said the world's gonna end in 12 years.
[00:57:10.928 --> 00:57:12.909]  Then she said, I didn't really mean it.
[00:57:12.909 --> 00:57:15.670]  And now she says it was a joke.
[00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:21.353]  No, lady, you're terrorizing people and no one bought it but your millennial audience.
[00:57:21.353 --> 00:57:27.756]  And they're so zombie-like, they're still believing it, even though they're Jim Jones leader, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
[00:57:28.479 --> 00:57:34.061]  OC, the original gangster, is now saying she didn't mean it.
[00:57:34.061 --> 00:57:36.782]  That's mind control, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:36.782 --> 00:57:41.323]  Hour number two of the most banned, demonized broadcast in the world, straight ahead.
[00:57:41.323 --> 00:57:46.305]  However you're listening, tell everyone you know to tune in and break the back of the censors.
[00:57:46.305 --> 00:57:47.185]  Save the republic!
[00:57:49.093 --> 00:57:53.256]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[00:57:53.256 --> 00:57:54.316]  They are technocrats.
[00:57:54.316 --> 00:57:56.618]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[00:57:56.618 --> 00:58:04.102]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[00:58:04.102 --> 00:58:05.843]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[00:58:05.843 --> 00:58:07.945]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[00:58:08.445 --> 00:58:14.807]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[00:58:14.807 --> 00:58:19.989]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.

[01:00:12.014 --> 01:00:14.958]  Epic times.
[01:00:14.958 --> 01:00:17.841]  Another referendum against the EU and the UK voting.
[01:00:17.841 --> 01:00:19.663]  Word is vast majority about to vote to get out.
[01:00:19.663 --> 01:00:20.844]  Other elections happening as well.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:28.744]  Robert Barnes, attorney at law, really smart historian, will be joining us to cover the waterfront next segment.
[01:00:28.744 --> 01:00:38.251]  Not just cases against us, that'll be a minor footnote, but Avenatti, more indictments, what's happening with these demonization attacks of Trump, how they're unconstitutional.
[01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:48.238]  But look at the talking points, the new one that Trump's involved in a cover-up, when you've got a witch hunt going on 40 years into his past, Congress engaged in massive criminal activity.
[01:00:48.238 --> 01:00:49.459]  Here's Tucker Carlson reporting.
[01:00:52.196 --> 01:00:57.652]  Well thanks to Nancy Pelosi, the phrase cover-up dominated cable news today.
[01:00:57.652 --> 01:00:57.893]  Watch.
[01:00:58.885 --> 01:01:03.308]  Nancy Pelosi describes President Trump as being engaged in a cover-up.
[01:01:03.308 --> 01:01:08.651]  One of the things that she said is that the Trump administration is engaged in a cover-up.
[01:01:08.651 --> 01:01:12.973]  She said President Trump is engaged in a cover-up.
[01:01:12.973 --> 01:01:17.716]  Comments Pelosi had made this morning that the President had engaged in a cover-up.
[01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:20.918]  She accused the President of engaging in a cover-up.
[01:01:20.918 --> 01:01:24.220]  The President complaining to the Speaker of the House that she accused him of a cover-up?
[01:01:24.605 --> 01:01:31.111]  That phrase, cover-up from Nancy Pelosi, really set him off.
[01:01:31.111 --> 01:01:37.277]  Over at MSNBC, one anchor accused the president of a cover-up for refusing to publicize his private life.
[01:01:39.437 --> 01:01:52.563]  When you talk about, I don't do cover-ups, there's also the fact that he has been refusing to let his current and former aides testify, refusing to turn over documents that have been demanded, including the tax returns.
[01:01:52.563 --> 01:01:58.626]  Also, refusing to grant an interview to Robert Mueller.
[01:01:58.626 --> 01:02:00.507]  Joe Concio watches an awful lot of television.
[01:02:00.507 --> 01:02:03.549]  He writes about media for The Hill, and he joins us tonight.
[01:02:04.372 --> 01:02:13.753]  Joe, is it my imagination or did once again the Speaker of the House deliver the talking point that everyone in cable news eagerly took up and repeated?
[01:02:15.879 --> 01:02:17.740]  I think you're seeing a pattern here, Tucker.
[01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:24.264]  I remember back in January, the term manufactured crisis was used to talk about what was going on at the U.S.
[01:02:24.264 --> 01:02:25.265]  southern border.
[01:02:25.265 --> 01:02:34.391]  And then you heard over and over, dozens upon dozens of times, and not just from one network, but different networks, different anchors or pundits or guests,
[01:02:34.691 --> 01:02:38.834]  Using that same exact term to the word, manufactured crisis.
[01:02:38.834 --> 01:02:43.818]  Now sure enough, as we know, and even the New York Times admits, it's no longer a manufactured crisis at the border.
[01:02:43.818 --> 01:02:44.819]  That's a real thing.
[01:02:44.819 --> 01:02:46.080]  Story for another time.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.843]  And then we had the other crisis, which was the constitutional crisis.
[01:02:49.843 --> 01:02:51.865]  And that was two weeks ago, when Bill Barr
[01:02:52.265 --> 01:03:02.576]  After he testified in front of the Senate, decided not to do so with the House when they changed the rules around as far as staffers being able to question him, which had never happened in Congress before.
[01:03:02.576 --> 01:03:04.939]  And he said, this is going to be a circus, no thanks, I'm not going to show up.
[01:03:04.939 --> 01:03:07.422]  So that became a constitutional crisis.
[01:03:07.422 --> 01:03:09.003]  And Pelosi says that as well.
[01:03:09.003 --> 01:03:14.149]  And sure enough, the Media Research Center, and I get they're conservative, but the numbers here are usually accurate.
[01:03:14.689 --> 01:03:25.963]  They found that between May 8th and May 12th, that on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC, that that exact term, constitutional crisis, was uttered 386 times.
[01:03:25.963 --> 01:03:30.147]  I'm not very good at math, but I'm pretty sure.
[01:03:30.828 --> 01:03:34.532]  That's more than 70 times, if you average it out, per network.
[01:03:34.532 --> 01:03:47.365]  So yeah, it goes out one mouth, it comes out another mouth, and now here we are with cover-up, and that will be the next new constitutional crisis, as far as terms that we hear over and over again, as if it's an echo chamber.
[01:03:48.922 --> 01:03:51.064]  We're entering campaign season.
[01:03:51.064 --> 01:03:53.847]  There's a presidential campaign in progress already.
[01:03:53.847 --> 01:03:57.550]  At some point, these are campaign finance violations.
[01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:03.796]  These are television networks donating to presidential campaigns to a party and not declaring it.
[01:04:06.816 --> 01:04:09.858]  That would be very interesting to see that case being made, perhaps.
[01:04:09.858 --> 01:04:18.025]  But no, it just seems to be that people are taking their cues from one party in this business and not the other, particularly from Pelosi.
[01:04:18.025 --> 01:04:22.529]  And look, I wanted to hear some reporters yell at her the way that Trump is yelled at.
[01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:24.851]  What cover-up are you specifically talking about?
[01:04:25.071 --> 01:04:26.812]  Who's involved in this cover-up?
[01:04:26.812 --> 01:04:29.272]  Is Bob Mueller involved in this cover-up?
[01:04:29.272 --> 01:04:39.936]  Because he's been reluctant to testify to this point, so is he also part of the cover-up that now includes, I believe, Bill Barr, Don McGahn, Cato Kaelin, the White House chef?
[01:04:39.936 --> 01:04:48.498]  I mean, who else is involved in this deep conspiracy of people who otherwise probably don't like the President that much, but are willing to put their careers on the line to cover up for him?
[01:04:48.498 --> 01:04:49.979]  It's quite comical on some level, actually.
[01:04:50.399 --> 01:04:51.762]  It is kind of amazing.
[01:04:51.762 --> 01:04:53.205]  I hope we get to the bottom of it.
[01:04:53.205 --> 01:04:54.347]  I know there are Russians there somewhere.
[01:04:54.347 --> 01:04:57.434]  Well, we say it's comical, but these criminals are trying to sabotage our recovery.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.961]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[01:05:01.961 --> 01:05:02.882]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[01:05:02.882 --> 01:05:04.243]  You are the man, Alex.
[01:05:04.243 --> 01:05:05.764]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[01:05:05.764 --> 01:05:06.564]  I'm so excited.
[01:05:06.564 --> 01:05:07.465]  I'm such a big fan.
[01:05:07.465 --> 01:05:09.947]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[01:05:09.947 --> 01:05:12.468]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[01:05:12.468 --> 01:05:13.869]  The Bone Broth.
[01:05:13.869 --> 01:05:15.310]  The Bone Broth.
[01:05:15.310 --> 01:05:16.691]  The B-B-B-Bone Broth.
[01:05:16.691 --> 01:05:17.972]  The B-B-B-Bone Broth.
[01:05:17.972 --> 01:05:22.715]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[01:05:22.715 --> 01:05:23.816]  It tastes like Ovaltine!
[01:05:24.156 --> 01:05:25.537]  It tastes like Ovaltine!
[01:05:25.537 --> 01:05:27.097]  It tastes like Ovaltine!
[01:05:27.097 --> 01:05:28.157]  Like good!
[01:05:28.157 --> 01:05:28.798]  Whoa!
[01:05:28.798 --> 01:05:30.498]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:05:30.498 --> 01:05:34.699]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride-Free Toothpaste.
[01:05:34.699 --> 01:05:38.481]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[01:05:38.481 --> 01:05:40.521]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[01:05:40.521 --> 01:05:43.102]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[01:05:43.102 --> 01:05:43.842]  I'm thanking you.
[01:05:43.842 --> 01:05:46.383]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula.
[01:05:46.383 --> 01:05:50.284]  The turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[01:05:50.284 --> 01:05:51.105]  It is next level.
[01:05:51.105 --> 01:05:51.645]  It really is good.
[01:05:51.645 --> 01:05:52.045]  So thank you.
[01:05:52.225 --> 01:05:54.146]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:05:54.146 --> 01:05:54.547]  Thank you.
[01:06:14.426 --> 01:06:23.229]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:49.818 --> 01:06:52.761]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:06:52.761 --> 01:07:06.414]  I wanted to get constitutional lawyer, prominent civil rights lawyer as well, Robert Barnes on, because he's been following very, very closely what's been happening with the persecution of the president.
[01:07:06.414 --> 01:07:08.716]  And I want to be very, very clear here.
[01:07:08.716 --> 01:07:10.698]  If Michael Moore was put in prison,
[01:07:11.579 --> 01:07:22.914]  Given a multi-year prison sentence and spent nine months in jail for getting five of his friends to give small campaign donations to somebody, I'd say that was political persecution.
[01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:29.562]  That happened to Dinesh D'Souza and everybody from the Young Turds to Michael Moore celebrated it.
[01:07:30.541 --> 01:07:37.065]  And now you've got massive persecution of the free press going on in this country.
[01:07:37.065 --> 01:07:54.237]  Not by Trump, but by Obama previously, and now by state prosecutors against these pro-lifers that got the pro-abortionist on tape at restaurants and other places talking about making millions of dollars off selling baby parts, which is illegal.
[01:07:55.754 --> 01:07:59.120]  Even the LA Times said, this is persecution of the press.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:00.883]  Well, I don't like Bill Clinton.
[01:08:00.883 --> 01:08:02.366]  And I didn't like Barack Obama.
[01:08:02.366 --> 01:08:05.111]  There was plenty of stuff that go after them that was real.
[01:08:05.111 --> 01:08:07.516]  Selling out the country, missile secrets, open borders.
[01:08:09.804 --> 01:08:17.132]  But imagine if they wanted to go back 40 years into Obama's tax returns, or his kids' tax returns, or his family's.
[01:08:17.132 --> 01:08:24.440]  If they wanted to put it all over television, if they wanted to illegally spy on him, and then get caught spying on him.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:27.103]  That's really the issue here, and I was talking to Barnes.
[01:08:27.944 --> 01:08:28.785]  This weekend about it.
[01:08:28.785 --> 01:08:29.745]  He was making a lot of great points.
[01:08:29.745 --> 01:08:33.168]  I said, please come on the show next week.
[01:08:33.168 --> 01:08:34.549]  He's been busy in court and things.
[01:08:34.549 --> 01:08:39.633]  He could do it today to lay out the facts here, because this is very, very clear.
[01:08:39.633 --> 01:08:41.614]  They're calling the constitutional crisis.
[01:08:41.614 --> 01:08:46.998]  Well, that's only if the questions are so close for my research that there's a debate there.
[01:08:46.998 --> 01:08:52.582]  I don't think there is a constitutional crisis, Bob, or maybe I'm wrong.
[01:08:52.582 --> 01:08:57.146]  Isn't this a crisis in that the Democrats are completely authoritarian and out of control?
[01:08:58.843 --> 01:08:59.924]  That is precisely the case.
[01:08:59.924 --> 01:09:06.070]  I mean, what is frightening here is Congress historically has been limited in its subpoena power.
[01:09:06.070 --> 01:09:13.837]  So historically, Congress cannot use as its excuse to go after private citizens, go after private records.
[01:09:13.837 --> 01:09:17.100]  It can only use its very limited subpoena power.
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.802]  To give you an idea, the United States Senate
[01:09:19.204 --> 01:09:27.507]  Never even did or used its subpoena power for investigative purposes for the first 70 years of our constitutional republic.
[01:09:27.507 --> 01:09:31.908]  So this was not something that was considered by the founders to be inherent in Congress.
[01:09:31.908 --> 01:09:37.610]  In fact, they were afraid of abuse of power by Congress because of what had happened in the Parliament.
[01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:41.851]  In Parliament in the UK, they had used their quote-unquote subpoena powers and
[01:09:42.191 --> 01:09:49.496]  Quasi-prosecutorial powers to wrongfully harass ministers, put people in the tower, all kinds of abuses.
[01:09:49.496 --> 01:09:55.940]  So the whole point and purpose was that the executive branch would have the enforcement power, not the legislative branch.
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:10:07.727]  And the legislative branch's subpoena power is limited to solely oversight of the government officials themselves, related to their public conduct, or related to matters of pending legislation.
[01:10:08.191 --> 01:10:11.013]  And what they've done here is they've completely eviscerated that.
[01:10:11.013 --> 01:10:31.127]  The two Obama appointed judges, one in DC, one yesterday in New York, issued orders that compelled banks, accountants, and private agencies to disclose a wide range of records that concerned the records of private Americans, including records of President Trump before he was ever president, before he was ever a candidate.
[01:10:31.127 --> 01:10:32.528]  But it went beyond that.
[01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:37.312]  It went to businesses and organizations merely because they have an affiliation or association with Trump.
[01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:42.394]  It actually even included the records of minor citizens, minor children.
[01:10:42.394 --> 01:10:44.415]  This is how insane this is.
[01:10:44.415 --> 01:10:51.618]  So when you add it up and you aggregate it, what you get is something that's very disturbing, that's something that's very unsettling, because these two decisions
[01:10:52.133 --> 01:10:58.115]  Completely eviscerate and eliminate privacy for all Americans in the entire country.
[01:10:58.115 --> 01:11:06.837]  Because the records that are being looked at are the private records of private citizens during a time period that they were entirely private and the president himself was a private citizen.
[01:11:06.837 --> 01:11:14.319]  And they have no limit that neither judge put any limit at all on the scope of these subpoenas or the records that can be obtained.
[01:11:14.319 --> 01:11:19.800]  They are using Trump to get Obama appointed judges to issue unprecedented power
[01:11:20.305 --> 01:11:26.989]  to the Democrats in Congress to go after anybody, anywhere, anyplace, anytime, for any reason.
[01:11:26.989 --> 01:11:43.259]  And it goes even beyond that, because what they actually publicly stated yesterday, the Democrats' lawyer in court said their entire purpose of getting all of these intimate, private, financial, personal records was to publicly disclose those records to the world.
[01:11:43.259 --> 01:11:46.601]  So this is a shocking, frightening, unprecedented,
[01:11:47.150 --> 01:11:51.134]  So let me, as a layperson that tracks this quantified, and you correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:12:06.605 --> 01:12:19.196]  After hijacking the executive, even after Obama left office, they left stay-behind groups in there, rogue groups that ran this illegal, out-of-control witch hunt that came up completely dry.
[01:12:21.144 --> 01:12:25.288]  And as you said, the executive is who carries out these prosecutions.
[01:12:25.288 --> 01:12:46.788]  So now we have a real constitutional crisis, not that Trump won't give this up, but that the legislative, via the Democrats, is now trying to usurp the executive power of prosecution, of investigation, and is now completely rogue, mad dog, complicit with a controlled corporate press, most of it owned by foreign operatives like the Chinese, communists.
[01:12:47.448 --> 01:12:57.374]  And they are, as you said, publicly admitting they intend to harass everyone involved, twist everything involved, just like they're doing with us in the Sandy Hook situation.
[01:12:57.374 --> 01:13:03.777]  I mean, this really is the tactic to take law in this country and then to completely subvert it.
[01:13:03.777 --> 01:13:04.277]  Absolutely.
[01:13:04.277 --> 01:13:09.300]  In fact, it even goes further than that, because the executive branch would not have the capacity
[01:13:09.835 --> 01:13:10.235]  I think so.
[01:13:32.182 --> 01:13:35.704]  So this is something that a judge would not have the authority to do.
[01:13:35.704 --> 01:13:39.066]  This is something that the prosecutor would not have the authority to do.
[01:13:39.066 --> 01:13:41.928]  A grand jury would not have the authority to do.
[01:13:41.928 --> 01:13:46.872]  Civil litigants in civil discovery normally would not have the power to do.
[01:13:46.872 --> 01:13:52.115]  Because this goes far beyond just records that are material or pertinent to a particular inquiry.
[01:13:52.455 --> 01:13:56.598]  These are just, hey, we would like to look at all your records over a 10, 20 year time period.
[01:13:56.598 --> 01:14:07.087]  Which by the way, people don't understand, even with cheap lawyers, it would cost Trump hundreds of millions of dollars, and then there's no way to comply with all of it, so they're going to claim contempt.
[01:14:07.087 --> 01:14:08.267]  So pulling back from this,
[01:14:09.088 --> 01:14:16.810]  This is beyond a runaway train, then, Bob Barnes, and this is a foaming at the mouth, piranha-like attack.
[01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:18.470]  What does the president need to do?
[01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:33.454]  I know he needs to refuse it, declare executive privilege, but when you've got runaway courts and activist judiciary with activist media with activist Democrats in a trifecta of authoritarianism, what does Trump do?
[01:14:33.454 --> 01:14:37.795]  It's going to be a little bit counterintuitive for him, but what he needs to do is this is really not about him.
[01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:43.598]  This is about, he needs to make this case about the privacy rights of every single American.
[01:14:43.598 --> 01:14:46.904]  Make it about the minor child's records that they're trying to seize.
[01:14:46.904 --> 01:14:49.610]  Make it about third-party business records they're trying to seize.
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.102]  Make it about the private citizens' records they're trying to seize.
[01:14:53.102 --> 01:15:02.527]  Make it say that in the name of attacking him, they're trying to deny Americans their fundamental constitutional rights to privacy that will eliminate and eviscerate those rights for them.
[01:15:02.527 --> 01:15:09.991]  Do they want Congress or some congressperson who has a personal grievance or grudge to wage a personal war and use their congressional power against them?
[01:15:10.475 --> 01:15:15.718]  This threatens every American, everywhere, for all of the future.
[01:15:15.718 --> 01:15:24.442]  So you just said, we're going to come back and flesh this out, as a prominent constitutional lawyer and civil rights lawyer, very prominent, one of the top guys in the country, folks, in case you didn't know, with Robert Barnes here.
[01:15:24.442 --> 01:15:26.423]  You just said it, just like I was saying, it's what they're doing to me.
[01:15:26.423 --> 01:15:28.264]  It's what they're doing to everybody.
[01:15:28.264 --> 01:15:31.446]  This is this new legal tyranny, judicial
[01:15:32.006 --> 01:15:35.968]  We'll be back with Robert Barnes, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:10.882]  This is a digital AI-enforced gag order.
[01:19:10.882 --> 01:19:14.607]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:21.970]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:19:21.970 --> 01:19:23.191]  This is racketeering.
[01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:24.311]  This is cartels.
[01:19:24.311 --> 01:19:26.711]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:19:26.711 --> 01:19:28.591]  We need it now.
[01:19:28.591 --> 01:19:30.292]  You can take on Big Tech.
[01:19:30.292 --> 01:19:39.233]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[01:19:39.233 --> 01:19:47.275]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[01:19:47.275 --> 01:19:48.135]  The way to fight back
[01:19:48.775 --> 01:19:53.597]  is to support Infowars now more than ever and make it a standard of freedom and free speech.
[01:19:53.597 --> 01:20:01.321]  Understand that they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[01:20:01.321 --> 01:20:03.963]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.538 --> 01:20:37.964]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:20:37.964 --> 01:20:39.845]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:20:39.845 --> 01:20:48.629]  Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, famous civil rights lawyer, one of the winningest records out there, really smart fella.
[01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:51.231]  He is not giving you rhetoric.
[01:20:51.231 --> 01:20:57.353]  He's not telling you what he wants to believe about Trump.
[01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:59.134]  He's not even Republican or Democrat.
[01:20:59.134 --> 01:21:01.795]  He's nonpartisan.
[01:21:01.795 --> 01:21:03.255]  He's telling you the reality.
[01:21:03.255 --> 01:21:09.657]  And if you've studied history like I have, I know most of you have, you've never heard of anything like this.
[01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:10.738]  I mean, when you've got a woman
[01:21:13.211 --> 01:21:17.315]  In the White House having sex with the President and then she goes public and things.
[01:21:17.315 --> 01:21:19.097]  There's some way for the courts to get involved.
[01:21:19.097 --> 01:21:21.520]  There's a real person.
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.921]  Something's happened.
[01:21:22.921 --> 01:21:26.625]  There's a individual that has standing.
[01:21:26.625 --> 01:21:34.253]  But when Trump doesn't have any criminal past or any criminal history or any problems, and then as soon as he runs for office he goes from being popular to Satan,
[01:21:35.717 --> 01:21:36.037]  And he's
[01:21:50.888 --> 01:22:09.253]  Jurisdictions in Chicago, in Cook County, and in Maryland, in Baltimore, and in D.C., and in the Southern District of New York, with Obama and Hillary appointed foaming at the mouth attack dogs saying, we're gonna get him, he's going down, when they started the investigations.
[01:22:10.998 --> 01:22:35.616]  Well that's just insane and you know Robert what blows me away here is how naked they are and even admitting it's political and the talking points and Pelosi stuttering and the fact that though Trump isn't more on the offense we'll talk about that more in the next segment but sure he's appointed this for US attorney that you know goes after corrupt FBI and stuff okay great you know they're getting really scared but
[01:22:37.891 --> 01:22:41.116]  Now this isn't just about Trump's duty to prosecute the deep state.
[01:22:41.116 --> 01:22:43.339]  They aren't giving up, it looks like to me.
[01:22:43.339 --> 01:22:49.287]  They're putting their afterburners on and I'm just wondering how bad this is going to get.
[01:22:49.287 --> 01:22:50.870]  What do you think is going to unfold here?
[01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:52.912]  Like you said, this is unprecedented.
[01:22:54.505 --> 01:22:55.045]  Precisely.
[01:22:55.045 --> 01:23:02.729]  I mean, for example, back at the end of the 1900s, there was an attempt by Congress to go after people that were some of the robber barons.
[01:23:02.729 --> 01:23:07.892]  And those are some of the people who actually were involved in extensive levels of corruption, etc.
[01:23:07.892 --> 01:23:10.093]  The United States Supreme Court said, no, you can't do that.
[01:23:10.093 --> 01:23:19.118]  Congress does not have the power to use its legislative power to pretend to be a prosecutorial body and invade the privacy of third parties or private citizens.
[01:23:19.588 --> 01:23:37.383]  This continued during the HUAC committees, the House Un-American Activities Committee, advised by Democrats, run by Democrats, controlled by Democrats in the 1950s, which actually it was not the Joe McCarthy committee that actually did most of the abuses, it was the Democratic House committee that did most of the abuses.
[01:23:37.383 --> 01:23:38.864]  The abuses were so bad the U.S.
[01:23:38.864 --> 01:23:42.988]  Supreme Court stepped in again, famous case called Watkins v. the United States.
[01:23:43.348 --> 01:23:54.092]  Where the Supreme Court again stated Congress does not have the power to ransack people's private thoughts, private records, either through compelled testimony or compelled disclosure of financial or other records.
[01:23:54.092 --> 01:24:10.137]  Then other courts have followed that up in the 60s and 70s when Congress used its Aging Committee or its other committees, Select Subcommittee on Aging, Select Subcommittee on Different Items, to try to go after private citizens and repeatedly, including the Southern District of New York in a Bergman case, said no, you can't do that.
[01:24:10.137 --> 01:24:12.238]  You can't seek private records of private citizens.
[01:24:12.558 --> 01:24:13.499]  You can't.
[01:24:13.499 --> 01:24:19.065]  Your sole and whole objective is to craft and draft and pass laws.
[01:24:19.065 --> 01:24:20.847]  It's not to try to enforce laws.
[01:24:20.847 --> 01:24:22.909]  It's not to try to apply laws.
[01:24:22.909 --> 01:24:31.037]  It is not try to ransack people's personal private records because they knew how dangerous it would be if we have these peeping Tom politicians
[01:24:31.431 --> 01:24:40.554]  Being able to ransack or go window shopping to any American citizen they just happen to dislike or who is their political or ideological adversary.
[01:24:40.554 --> 01:24:43.594]  And that is precisely what is taking place now by Congress.
[01:24:43.594 --> 01:24:47.696]  And that is why it is such a unique, unprecedented, unparalleled threat.
[01:24:47.696 --> 01:24:48.796]  And it is ironic
[01:24:49.281 --> 01:25:07.870]  That it is happening because of a president who's been completely innocent and who's only been guilty of getting the ordinary everyday American people to support a political revolution to try to overturn the institutionalized corruption that led us to this stage in place to where Trump could get elected in the first place.
[01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:12.673]  Pulling back from this, you just crystallized it perfectly, this is the legislative branch
[01:25:13.655 --> 01:25:20.878]  Taking on the executive branch, which is over the FBI, the CIA, all of it.
[01:25:20.878 --> 01:25:26.360]  Literally, this is a power grab for the first time in 240-something years of our history.
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:27.461]  This is the first time
[01:25:28.826 --> 01:25:48.377]  At this level, as you pointed out, it happened back in the 50s a little bit, that the legislative branch has tried to basically make itself all three branches of government, because it's acting like a judiciary, it's acting like the legislature, and it's also trying to act like the executive, and then it's engaged in all of this intimidation and threats.
[01:25:48.377 --> 01:25:49.438]  It's really become a tyranny.
[01:25:50.609 --> 01:25:53.950]  Precisely, it's classic and extension of what Obama did with the presidency.
[01:25:53.950 --> 01:26:01.233]  It is an attempt to usurp authority that previously they did not have and that the Constitution explicitly denied them.
[01:26:01.233 --> 01:26:05.034]  So you see them adjudicating Attorney General Barr in contempt?
[01:26:05.401 --> 01:26:11.525]  Well, that's the Judiciary Branch's objective and obligation, and the Prosecutorial Branch's duty and obligation.
[01:26:11.525 --> 01:26:19.510]  And here you have them usurping the Executive Branch's investigative role, and doing so in a way that even the Executive Branch could not get away with.
[01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:29.717]  The Executive Branch would need probable cause of criminal conduct to have a grand jury try to examine these records, and even then they would have- Oh yeah, Mueller only asked for a few years of Roger Stone stuff.
[01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:33.079]  He didn't say give us 40 years, and people were saying Mueller was out of control.
[01:26:34.099 --> 01:26:34.999]  Oh absolutely!
[01:26:34.999 --> 01:26:44.784]  What it is, is they're unsatisfied with what Mueller did, so they've decided they're just going to replace Mueller, and in the process they're going to eviscerate the privacy rights of every single American to achieve it and accomplish it.
[01:26:44.784 --> 01:26:49.687]  And unfortunately they have a bunch of complicit, Obama-appointed judges who are making decisions that are
[01:26:50.086 --> 01:26:51.607]  Purely politically motivated.
[01:26:51.607 --> 01:27:04.817]  To give you a parallel, to give you an example, does anybody think that if the Republican Senate, assuming they ever got cojones, actually decided to subpoena Joe Biden's and Hunter Biden's and the Biden's family records for the time period in which Biden was vice president?
[01:27:04.817 --> 01:27:06.198]  The Democrats would never put up with that!
[01:27:06.198 --> 01:27:12.103]  Hell, Schiff has come out and even said that they can't have Biden's records from two years ago on Ukraine!
[01:27:13.252 --> 01:27:13.953]  Exactly.
[01:27:13.953 --> 01:27:30.793]  So here you have Biden's records related to his family's getting huge payoffs from Chinese government officials, from Ukrainian oligarchs, and from others, according to various published reliable allegations in the press, that's far more reliable and trustworthy than the completely discounted, discredited allegations against the president.
[01:27:31.233 --> 01:27:39.738]  And yet, if any subpoena was issued for those records, these same Obama-appointed judges would suddenly remember and rediscover their privacy rights.
[01:27:39.738 --> 01:27:41.979]  Uh-oh, Schiff, as you know, last week signaled.
[01:27:41.979 --> 01:27:46.302]  He said, our committee won't hear it, we're not going to ask for it, and no judges should.
[01:27:46.302 --> 01:27:48.323]  Nothing Biden's done is subpoenable.
[01:27:48.323 --> 01:27:52.205]  He is above the law because it's political, because he's running for office.
[01:27:52.205 --> 01:27:53.906]  Well, Trump's running for office, too.
[01:27:53.906 --> 01:27:58.429]  So, I mean, the paradox here, where they don't care how hypocritical they look now.
[01:27:59.505 --> 01:27:59.966]  Oh, exactly.
[01:27:59.966 --> 01:28:06.453]  I mean, for example, what would have happened if the Republican House, when it actually had control, had subpoenaed all the records of anybody connected to the Clinton Foundation?
[01:28:06.852 --> 01:28:10.294]  There would have been a more legitimate basis for that than there is of this.
[01:28:10.294 --> 01:28:23.762]  And yet all of the Obama-appointed judges would have remembered the First Amendment rights, the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment rights, which encompass the right to privacy of every ordinary American against congressional intrusion and invasion of that privacy by peeping Tom politicians.
[01:28:23.762 --> 01:28:25.543]  And that is why this is so dangerous.
[01:28:25.543 --> 01:28:32.267]  This is authorizing every politician in Congress to become a peeping Tom against the ordinary privacy rights of everyday Americans.
[01:28:32.267 --> 01:28:33.428]  This isn't a witch hunt.
[01:28:33.428 --> 01:28:34.649]  This is an inquisition.
[01:28:36.181 --> 01:28:37.262]  Robert Barnes is our guest.
[01:28:37.262 --> 01:28:39.704]  We'll talk about how he thinks Trump should strike back.
[01:28:39.704 --> 01:28:45.728]  Plus, High Canadian Courts has threatened us with an article on Infowars.com.
[01:28:45.728 --> 01:28:50.371]  They say you will not report on us drugging small children and chopping their genitals off.
[01:28:50.371 --> 01:28:51.672]  I'm not kidding.
[01:28:51.672 --> 01:28:54.494]  They're telling us in America, we'll chop their balls off.
[01:28:54.494 --> 01:28:55.295]  Sit down and shut up.
[01:28:57.523 --> 01:28:58.744]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.744 --> 01:29:02.667]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.667 --> 01:29:04.208]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.208 --> 01:29:07.170]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.170 --> 01:29:12.713]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:12.713 --> 01:29:13.934]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:13.934 --> 01:29:16.856]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:16.856 --> 01:29:19.078]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:19.078 --> 01:29:23.521]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:23.521 --> 01:29:25.862]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:27.421 --> 01:29:28.661]  Maybe not today.
[01:29:28.661 --> 01:29:29.962]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:29:29.962 --> 01:29:33.703]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:29:33.703 --> 01:29:34.784]  Forget bunkers.
[01:29:34.784 --> 01:29:36.604]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:38.325]  You need Survivalist Camps.

[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:17.107]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.107 --> 01:33:22.049]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:32.344 --> 01:33:39.208]  Metal under tension, beggin' you to touch him, girl.
[01:33:39.208 --> 01:33:41.510]  Highway to the banjo sound.
[01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:46.893]  Fire into the banjo sound.
[01:33:46.893 --> 01:33:56.239]  Headin' into twilight, spreadin' out her wings,
[01:33:57.563 --> 01:34:05.069]  Ladies and gentlemen, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, civil rights lawyer with one of the most successful records in the country, joins us.
[01:34:06.607 --> 01:34:09.749]  And we've been talking about the incredible usurpation of power.
[01:34:09.749 --> 01:34:14.812]  The legislative under the Democrats in the House becoming a government under themselves.
[01:34:14.812 --> 01:34:18.654]  They already tried to put Mueller up there as this god.
[01:34:18.654 --> 01:34:19.315]  That failed.
[01:34:19.315 --> 01:34:21.136]  That whole operation was a crime.
[01:34:21.136 --> 01:34:21.896]  It's now come out.
[01:34:21.896 --> 01:34:24.158]  Now they're going even further.
[01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:27.179]  So what does President Trump need to do?
[01:34:27.179 --> 01:34:29.541]  Recapping some of what you already said.
[01:34:29.541 --> 01:34:32.243]  Himself and the way he handles this, but also what do we do?
[01:34:33.463 --> 01:34:48.554]  What should the executive do proactively, not just in how we ourselves respond to being accused of being criminals by these criminals, by this Inquisition, but how does the president go on the offense against this with all the crimes they've already committed?
[01:34:48.554 --> 01:34:52.898]  Because it's clear they're not suing for peace when they've been caught committing all these crimes.
[01:34:52.898 --> 01:34:54.239]  They're going for broke.
[01:34:54.239 --> 01:34:59.403]  So recap what you said, very powerful, very historical, that this is cancer.
[01:35:00.163 --> 01:35:02.666]  The Democrats can't pass their gun confiscation.
[01:35:02.666 --> 01:35:04.569]  They can't pass their open borders.
[01:35:04.569 --> 01:35:06.672]  They're just doing it by fiat.
[01:35:06.672 --> 01:35:10.396]  And so at every level, it's just a total power grab.
[01:35:10.396 --> 01:35:11.238]  Break that down for us.
[01:35:12.319 --> 01:35:12.880]  Sure.
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:20.167]  So the President needs to assert that this is one of the most dangerous and precarious threats to individual privacy in the history of this country.
[01:35:20.167 --> 01:35:33.259]  And while it is about him personally, the reality is the precedent that can be set by this case will endanger the privacy rights of every ordinary American, will make Congress a third party of the surveillance state,
[01:35:33.655 --> 01:35:44.319]  And allow any politician to become a peeping Tom politician and to spy on any citizen anywhere in the country that they happen to disagree with using their congressional powers to do so.
[01:35:44.319 --> 01:35:49.101]  Powers that the Constitution explicitly and expressly denied Congress in the first place.
[01:35:49.817 --> 01:36:02.242]  Secondly, the president needs to use the power of his public platform to basically to both educate and inform and to motivate the American public to recognize how consequential this issue is.
[01:36:02.242 --> 01:36:06.784]  Judges and courts and everybody else pays attention to what's happening in the court of public opinion.
[01:36:06.784 --> 01:36:16.308]  And it is critically essential, as important as it is to the courts of law, that the public opinion rally behind the president to recognize that whatever anyone even thinks of the president
[01:36:16.588 --> 01:36:28.991]  This is the kind of invasion of privacy that is both unprecedented and unparalleled, and that cannot be permitted to take place in the United States if we are to have constitutional rights and liberties against the power of an invasive Congress.
[01:36:28.991 --> 01:36:42.715]  Third, the actions that need to be taken by the executive branch writ large is to continue to fight this fight in the courts, but also to examine opportunities it can have to put these politicians on the other side of the aisle.
[01:36:42.715 --> 01:36:45.636]  So, Leo, if it's going to be open season,
[01:36:46.055 --> 01:36:56.962]  Then parts of the executive branch can examine whether or not they can do investigations into the Clinton Foundation, whether that should be reopened, whether they can do an investigation into the Biden corruption.
[01:36:56.962 --> 01:36:59.203]  Both parties and both sides can play at this.
[01:36:59.203 --> 01:37:03.386]  And the executive branch is the only one that has the constitutional authority to actually do so.
[01:37:03.846 --> 01:37:15.291]  So I think that the courts need to be put into the position where they recognize the errors of their ways, where they recognize this will not be applied just in a one-way fashion to favor just one side.
[01:37:15.291 --> 01:37:23.214]  And if they recognize that, hopefully they will then realize that they need to reassert the original constitutional rights and liberties that were always present.
[01:37:23.214 --> 01:37:26.416]  And this is the rights that were founded from the beginning of the country.
[01:37:26.416 --> 01:37:32.218]  Ordinary citizens do not get to have their personal thoughts, personal ideas, and personal records ransacked
[01:37:33.099 --> 01:37:59.899]  I want you to elaborate on that, but just at an instinctive level as an American, as just a father, as a businessman, as a journalist, they've committed all these crimes, illegal spying, all of it, they've been caught, and then now they don't get in trouble and they start 20-something new investigations and are going to subpoena thousands of people and hundreds of Trump's companies to obviously harass the living hell out of him?
[01:37:59.899 --> 01:38:00.599]  What if Trump
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:07.222]  Because they say Trump doesn't even have the power to order the FBI to investigate people, when he obviously does constitutionally.
[01:38:07.222 --> 01:38:11.464]  Imagine if he says, fine, I want 40 years of Pelosi and her whole mafia family.
[01:38:11.464 --> 01:38:16.725]  I want 40 years of, you know, of all these other crazy people.
[01:38:18.366 --> 01:38:23.209]  Like Maxine Waters and her husband getting tens of millions to his own private bank directly from her.
[01:38:23.209 --> 01:38:33.055]  Or if Trump says, OK, we're going to subpoena 30 years or 40 years of Obama's records, they would crap their pants, flip out and run into the shadows.
[01:38:33.055 --> 01:38:39.518]  But instead, Trump is surrounded by all these lawyers and these FBI leaders that I think are working for the other side.
[01:38:39.518 --> 01:38:42.360]  And they just tell him to sit there like a sitting duck and take this crap.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:46.021]  He has the constitutional authority to light their ass up!
[01:38:46.021 --> 01:38:52.164]  And so I say, let's go after Pelosi and Hillary and Obama and do exactly what they're doing to Trump.
[01:38:52.164 --> 01:38:57.186]  They'll put their tail between their legs and leave immediately and let America be great again.
[01:38:57.186 --> 01:38:59.987]  Why in the hell, then, is that not happening?
[01:39:01.221 --> 01:39:01.661]  Exactly.
[01:39:01.661 --> 01:39:05.804]  For example, the president could do that publicly, independent of the executive power that he has.
[01:39:05.804 --> 01:39:07.825]  He comes out and says what we just said!
[01:39:07.825 --> 01:39:09.166]  He said it's common sense!
[01:39:09.166 --> 01:39:12.028]  They just did it to me, and it's not even their jurisdiction!
[01:39:12.028 --> 01:39:15.129]  It's my jurisdiction, and now I'm coming for you!
[01:39:15.129 --> 01:39:17.371]  They have opened the frickin' door!
[01:39:18.507 --> 01:39:19.368]  Oh, precisely.
[01:39:19.368 --> 01:39:34.922]  And what he could do is he could make an offer of settlement that he will drop all challenges and contests to any subpoena that the Democratic Congress is issuing in exchange for all of the exact same records that they are subpoenaing from him of the same category and kind
[01:39:35.342 --> 01:39:59.189]  Be disclosed by every Democratic member of Congress, by Congressman Amash up in Michigan who wants to talk about impeachment, they can look at his Chinese financial ties, and by the last two Democratic presidents, both President Obama, all of his sealed records that are still sealed, all get publicly disclosed, and President Clinton, including the Clinton Foundation, and every Democratic candidate for president.
[01:39:59.529 --> 01:40:04.432]  State of California is trying to condition ballot access on various things they can't do constitutionally.
[01:40:04.432 --> 01:40:05.213]  Well, fine.
[01:40:05.213 --> 01:40:08.034]  Let's have everybody abide by the same standards.
[01:40:08.034 --> 01:40:15.179]  The Democrats in the House are saying we should have a uniform set of rules that we need to have full transparency of public officials.
[01:40:15.179 --> 01:40:20.402]  And that's why we're doing all of this microscopic, macroscopic inquiry into private citizens' records.
[01:40:20.402 --> 01:40:26.186]  And that's why we're prying into private citizens' records from time periods that the President himself was a private citizen.
[01:40:26.186 --> 01:40:26.706]  Okay, fine.
[01:40:27.045 --> 01:40:28.646]  Let's have Pelosi do the same.
[01:40:28.646 --> 01:40:31.687]  Let's have every Democratic Congressman do the same.
[01:40:31.687 --> 01:40:33.928]  Let's have every Democratic Senator do the same.
[01:40:33.928 --> 01:40:40.070]  Let's have every Democratic candidate for the presidency, including Senator Joe Biden and his family members, Hunter Biden, do the same.
[01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:41.690]  And he should publicly offer that.
[01:40:41.690 --> 01:40:42.891]  And then the utility of it is,
[01:40:43.531 --> 01:40:46.213]  If they were sincere, if they were correct, they would take them up.
[01:40:46.213 --> 01:40:49.296]  But everybody knows there's zero chance they will do that.
[01:40:49.296 --> 01:40:54.000]  And consequently, it will expose them for the hypocrisy and the duplicity with which they are operating.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.823]  It suggests that they are the ones that are operating in secret, hiding information.
[01:40:57.823 --> 01:41:05.789]  I mean, President Trump is one of the only politicians in recent American history to get poorer by going into public office.
[01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:07.411]  All of these other policies.
[01:41:07.411 --> 01:41:11.017]  LBJ went from like a million to like two billion or something.
[01:41:11.017 --> 01:41:11.618]  Exactly.
[01:41:11.618 --> 01:41:14.002]  And it's insane.
[01:41:14.002 --> 01:41:18.910]  And he waived executive privilege on millions of emails and no one ever did that.
[01:41:19.969 --> 01:41:20.789]  Oh, precisely.
[01:41:20.789 --> 01:41:31.815]  Well, I mean, as you've experienced, Alex, the parties that when you voluntarily provide information, when you willingly provide information, when you help facilitate the providing of information, all you do is get attacked for it.
[01:41:31.815 --> 01:41:43.341]  I mean, the idea that Nancy Pelosi could be out yesterday talking about a cover-up, when this has been the most transparent presidency in response to an illicit, unauthorized, unjust witch hunt,
[01:41:43.641 --> 01:41:44.742]  And it would be game over right then.
[01:42:13.936 --> 01:42:15.878]  Kamala Harris got sweetheart book deals.
[01:42:15.878 --> 01:42:17.700]  How did that happen?
[01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:26.428]  Go through every Democratic politician who has... President Obama hit all his college... And that goes back to the fact, and we're going to break here, that they're the oldest party in the country.
[01:42:26.428 --> 01:42:28.570]  They've been getting away with everything forever.
[01:42:28.570 --> 01:42:30.712]  They're the one-party system in this country.
[01:42:30.712 --> 01:42:33.755]  The Republicans have just been these bitch-slapped little minions.
[01:42:33.755 --> 01:42:36.218]  And here comes this wild-card Trump, and they don't know what to do.
[01:42:36.738 --> 01:42:37.699]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:42:37.699 --> 01:42:39.780]  They have opened the door for all of us.
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:42.042]  I want to shift gears into other issues.
[01:42:42.042 --> 01:42:45.985]  Abinanti indicted again, as you predicted here on air a month or so ago.
[01:42:45.985 --> 01:42:50.569]  Where that's going, we're going to look at the big elections in Europe.
[01:42:50.569 --> 01:42:57.814]  We're going to look at this situation with the Parliament and the courts in Canada coming after me.
[01:42:57.814 --> 01:43:02.778]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:43:03.198 --> 01:43:05.140]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.582]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[01:43:07.582 --> 01:43:08.583]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[01:43:08.583 --> 01:43:09.043]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:09.043 --> 01:43:10.324]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:43:10.324 --> 01:43:12.426]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[01:43:12.426 --> 01:43:18.310]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case, my truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:20.312]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:43:20.312 --> 01:43:21.273]  God bless you, brother.
[01:43:21.273 --> 01:43:27.858]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[01:43:28.278 --> 01:43:29.359]  You're our only hope, brother.
[01:43:29.359 --> 01:43:31.679]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:43:31.679 --> 01:43:34.441]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[01:43:56.849 --> 01:43:58.711]  They've not shut down our speech!
[01:43:58.711 --> 01:44:04.215]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[01:44:04.215 --> 01:44:11.722]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[01:44:11.722 --> 01:44:13.043]  Are you coming back?
[01:44:13.043 --> 01:44:14.204]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[01:44:14.784 --> 01:44:16.125]  We're at NewsWars.com.
[01:44:16.125 --> 01:44:18.388]  Paul Watts has launched his own Summit.News.
[01:44:18.388 --> 01:44:19.349]  We have our own videos.
[01:44:19.349 --> 01:44:20.410]  We have our own articles.
[01:44:20.410 --> 01:44:25.175]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[01:44:25.175 --> 01:44:27.437]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[01:44:27.437 --> 01:44:30.700]  InfoWars.com, man!
[01:44:30.700 --> 01:44:32.422]  Woo!
[01:44:33.783 --> 01:44:38.365]  InfoWars.com, because there's a bunch of people out here that don't know about InfoWars.com.
[01:44:38.365 --> 01:44:41.086]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:44:41.086 --> 01:44:43.307]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.

[01:44:46.808 --> 01:44:49.549]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.

[01:44:54.651 --> 01:44:55.211]  Please go there.

[01:45:58.362 --> 01:46:10.152]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[01:46:10.152 --> 01:46:16.358]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[01:46:16.358 --> 01:46:18.520]  And it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:22.643]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[01:46:23.504 --> 01:46:30.231]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally.
[01:46:30.231 --> 01:46:40.923]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[01:46:41.443 --> 01:46:43.685]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[01:46:43.685 --> 01:46:48.550]  It's 50% off right now in fullwrestore.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:51.412]  And of course getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[01:46:51.412 --> 01:47:01.321]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taking on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[01:47:01.321 --> 01:47:03.964]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:19.682 --> 01:47:23.104]  My friends, we are living in epic times.
[01:47:23.104 --> 01:47:27.686]  These are not boring times.
[01:47:27.686 --> 01:47:36.251]  Constitutional lawyer, successful national lawyer, civil rights lawyer, Bob Barnes is going to ride shotgun with us, 50 minutes to the next hour.
[01:47:36.251 --> 01:47:39.813]  Then Millie Weaver, our reporter, is going to be in studio with more breaking news.
[01:47:42.018 --> 01:47:46.241]  I've covered a lot of news so far, but I've got to tell you, I haven't covered 10%.
[01:47:46.241 --> 01:47:48.342]  That's why you've got to go to newswars.com.
[01:47:48.342 --> 01:47:50.744]  You've got to go to infowars.com.
[01:47:50.744 --> 01:48:01.591]  The globalists, the corporate media, the anti-free speech wolves are working around the clock to try to shut us down because our information is powerful.
[01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:08.954]  I mean, what you just heard Robert Barnes talk about is bedrock constitution, Supreme Court rulings.
[01:48:08.954 --> 01:48:15.038]  That's why they can't have us on air is because we're covering facts here.
[01:48:15.038 --> 01:48:25.325]  And we have the fathers in studio whose wives take their daughters in Texas and in Canada and in England, we've had them on.
[01:48:25.325 --> 01:48:32.610]  And then their daughters, their sons get chemically or physically castrated and they have no say because the state tricked them to do it.
[01:48:34.394 --> 01:48:38.657]  Well, now I've got the courts in Canada threatening me to not talk about it.
[01:48:38.657 --> 01:48:41.559]  Because there's these gag orders everywhere.
[01:48:41.559 --> 01:48:43.580]  And they don't talk about kids being sterilized.
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:45.501]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:48:45.501 --> 01:48:50.905]  Canadian court tries to stop Alex Jones from covering trans childcare.
[01:48:50.905 --> 01:48:53.126]  Everybody says, hey, why doesn't somebody stand up?
[01:48:53.126 --> 01:48:55.608]  Why doesn't somebody fight?
[01:48:55.608 --> 01:48:58.090]  Why doesn't somebody stand up?
[01:48:58.090 --> 01:49:02.813]  Well, you go show an abortion clinic, keeping babies alive and selling their organs, you get indicted.
[01:49:02.813 --> 01:49:04.074]  You don't get a Nobel Prize.
[01:49:05.987 --> 01:49:13.512]  You expose kids being chemically sterilized, you get courts threatening to arrest you.
[01:49:13.512 --> 01:49:19.936]  And listen, I'm willing to get arrested, but I'm just saying, folks, you get, like, we're fighting, right?
[01:49:19.936 --> 01:49:22.778]  Like, we're not just up here shooting our mouths off.
[01:49:22.778 --> 01:49:28.782]  I mean, we're under total attack because we stand up for children and everybody else, and not because we're heroes.
[01:49:28.782 --> 01:49:30.383]  My instinct is to stand up for kids.
[01:49:30.383 --> 01:49:31.384]  That's just a default.
[01:49:33.188 --> 01:49:40.814]  If I walk out in a parking lot and some guy's beating up a kid or a woman for no reason, I'm gonna tell them to stop and if they don't stop, I'm gonna stomp their head in the ground or die trying.
[01:49:40.814 --> 01:49:45.898]  As long as I'm Mr. Badass, my cells are all aligned towards doing the right thing.
[01:49:47.895 --> 01:49:48.656]  And you know what?
[01:49:48.656 --> 01:49:52.801]  Evil has never beaten me yet, because you've always backed me.
[01:49:52.801 --> 01:49:57.748]  And I'll never give up, and I'll never give in, but I might give out, folks, like an old horse.
[01:49:57.748 --> 01:50:04.577]  And you know, that'd probably be a gift when it actually happens, but I want to run this course as hard as I can for you and for myself and my family.
[01:50:05.609 --> 01:50:10.531]  And it's personal for me, and they've done a lot of stuff to me, and that makes this actually a sweet fight.
[01:50:10.531 --> 01:50:12.992]  But literally, I need oxygen in my lungs.
[01:50:12.992 --> 01:50:14.673]  I need wind in my sails.
[01:50:14.673 --> 01:50:19.175]  I need, like the Bible says, out of God's nostrils, He created the earth.
[01:50:19.175 --> 01:50:23.736]  Well, you are little g. You're in the image of God.
[01:50:23.736 --> 01:50:29.919]  Your breath, your financial support is your will, your work, your strength is what is in my sails.
[01:50:31.431 --> 01:50:35.795]  It's like the old parables of the Greek gods that people forgot when they died.
[01:50:35.795 --> 01:50:37.156]  Well, it's stories, folks.
[01:50:37.156 --> 01:50:44.202]  If we forget America, if we forget free market, if we forget real liberalism, not the fake modern liberalism, but real freedom, he'll die.
[01:50:44.202 --> 01:50:48.065]  But if we remember it, our story's better than their story.
[01:50:48.065 --> 01:50:49.847]  Like the last Game of Thrones episode.
[01:50:50.828 --> 01:50:51.508]  There's so much hype.
[01:50:51.508 --> 01:50:52.429]  I watched the last season.
[01:50:52.429 --> 01:50:53.709]  It was pretty powerful.
[01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:58.371]  And they're talking about having a new king instead of a new war.
[01:50:58.371 --> 01:51:00.632]  And they say, people don't do all this for gold.
[01:51:00.632 --> 01:51:01.913]  They don't do it for flags.
[01:51:01.913 --> 01:51:04.574]  They do it for stories.
[01:51:04.574 --> 01:51:06.574]  And we've got the better story.
[01:51:06.574 --> 01:51:07.495]  A story that delivers.
[01:51:08.803 --> 01:51:13.047]  But this isn't like Netflix where you turn it on and Hollywood's funding it.
[01:51:13.047 --> 01:51:15.530]  This is the embattled operation.
[01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:20.255]  This is an operation where I wish back in the heyday I could snap my fingers and bring in millions of dollars.
[01:51:20.255 --> 01:51:22.497]  But I was like, oh, I have enough.
[01:51:22.497 --> 01:51:24.740]  So I didn't try to hoard piles of money.
[01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:26.542]  I showed up like a big fat dragon.
[01:51:27.662 --> 01:51:28.783]  I didn't.
[01:51:28.783 --> 01:51:30.924]  Now, we need the funds.
[01:51:30.924 --> 01:51:35.165]  We have big specials, Memorial Day specials, that are running.
[01:51:35.165 --> 01:51:36.306]  60% off.
[01:51:36.306 --> 01:51:38.567]  Extend-A-Wise for your heart and cardiovascular.
[01:51:38.567 --> 01:51:41.188]  Micro-ZX to knock out the candida mold and stuff in your guts.
[01:51:41.188 --> 01:51:41.668]  It's amazing.
[01:51:41.668 --> 01:51:42.089]  60% off.
[01:51:43.169 --> 01:51:44.151]  We're good to go.
[01:52:00.754 --> 01:52:02.374]  And we're going to go down swinging regardless.
[01:52:02.374 --> 01:52:07.476]  I want to thank all the folks that have supported us, but don't let them extinguish this flame.
[01:52:07.476 --> 01:52:09.096]  Get products you need.
[01:52:09.096 --> 01:52:13.837]  Coffee, toothpaste, all of the highest quality, the new eight-pack PowerStack, the bone broth.
[01:52:13.837 --> 01:52:22.640]  Just get the products with the hundreds of thousands of votes and five stars on third-party sites and air filtration and water filtration.
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:23.160]  It's all there.
[01:52:24.116 --> 01:52:26.377]  And know that we appreciate you and we thank you.
[01:52:26.377 --> 01:52:30.418]  Shop with us, economically support us, and we commit to you.
[01:52:30.418 --> 01:52:34.719]  We won't stop until we either win or I give out.
[01:52:34.719 --> 01:52:35.699]  And I've already tried to set it up.
[01:52:35.699 --> 01:52:36.399]  Wait until that happens.
[01:52:36.399 --> 01:52:37.259]  We're going to keep going.
[01:52:37.259 --> 01:52:39.760]  All right, going back to Robert Barnes here.
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:44.821]  We've talked a lot about Trump and the incredible tyranny we're seeing.
[01:52:44.821 --> 01:52:50.223]  And since I have more time with you, another 15 minutes to the next hour, let's spend this time finishing up with Trump.
[01:52:51.775 --> 01:53:07.182]  What do you think the psychology is that we've got all the cards as nationalists, the globalists have been caught in all this fraud, all this illegal spying, they've launched 20 plus investigations, and then I guess Trump still doesn't have control of the executive?
[01:53:07.182 --> 01:53:15.466]  He can't get the FBI and others to attack when it's clear and present and ridiculous for the law and our own self-interest that he should do this?
[01:53:15.466 --> 01:53:16.766]  I mean, what the hell?
[01:53:16.766 --> 01:53:18.247]  How much will we put up with?
[01:53:20.034 --> 01:53:20.655]  I mean, no doubt.
[01:53:20.655 --> 01:53:31.786]  I mean, the extraordinary factor is if anyone doubted the existence of a deep state, which was originated in the construct by a writer for The Economist back at the end of the 19th century to describe the dual state.
[01:53:32.185 --> 01:53:37.811]  Which was, how could you have part of the government continue to function and operate as if elections don't exist?
[01:53:37.811 --> 01:53:44.777]  And he was just describing that phenomenon as there's this new administrative state that basically replaces the elected portion of government.
[01:53:44.777 --> 01:53:49.602]  This became further developed by people studying fascism, particularly German refugee professors in the 1940s.
[01:53:50.683 --> 01:54:06.976]  And then that evolved mostly by the left in the 60s and 70s into the term deep state to describe the rise of intelligence operations and high-ranking law enforcement and executive branch government components of the United States and foreign governments explaining how they could be completely immune from public elections.
[01:54:06.976 --> 01:54:10.719]  Well, the Trump's election proves that without any question and beyond any doubt.
[01:54:11.139 --> 01:54:27.892]  Because here you have the President of the United States not even in control of his own FBI, not even in control of his own Department of Justice and large parts of it, not even control over the CIA, not even control over large parts of the intelligence infrastructure, of the counterintelligence operations at the FBI and CIA.
[01:54:27.892 --> 01:54:29.553]  So it's frightening and terrifying.
[01:54:29.858 --> 01:54:50.827]  The degree and the scope to which the president's election and his lack of power over his own executive branch, and now he's facing a position where Congress is pretending to be the executive branch and pretending to be the judicial branch, but doing it with the co-option of the judicial branch on behalf of the Democratic members of House who have a view of their own power.
[01:54:51.167 --> 01:54:57.371]  This is Obama thought of himself as not only president but also Congress and also the judicial branch whenever and wherever he could.
[01:54:57.371 --> 01:55:05.796]  The first president to launch a massive spying campaign against his competitor to his preferred candidate in an election season.
[01:55:05.796 --> 01:55:10.179]  The biggest surveillance spying scandal in history was under President Obama.
[01:55:10.179 --> 01:55:16.003]  The biggest levels of witch hunt prosecutions against whistleblowers was under President Obama.
[01:55:16.423 --> 01:55:22.625]  But now you have judges appointed by President Obama, putting their imprint on the judiciary, and that imprint is frightening.
[01:55:22.625 --> 01:55:27.567]  That imprint is going to a degree that, you know, Stalinist courts would have been afraid to have gone.
[01:55:27.567 --> 01:55:45.494]  So, when you go to the point where you believe the legislative branch can usurp all other branches of government, and to invade the privacy of ordinary Americans without any limit or restriction at all, then we're to a place and a position where the President is basically being limited and hamstrung by the people that are supposed to be working for him.
[01:55:46.074 --> 01:55:49.957]  Nobody in the executive branch was elected except President Trump.
[01:55:49.957 --> 01:55:57.082]  And yet it's all the unelected people who are dictating policy, dictating prosecutorial decisions, dictating investigative decisions.
[01:55:57.082 --> 01:56:02.625]  I mean, for example, the Department of Justice should have long ago opened up investigations into Big Tech.
[01:56:02.625 --> 01:56:06.988]  The FEC should have opened up investigations into Big Tech for meddling in elections.
[01:56:06.988 --> 01:56:07.989]  Here you have Facebook.
[01:56:07.989 --> 01:56:09.630]  We talked earlier about the European elections.
[01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:27.494]  Facebook has been meddling in the European elections by having a secret blacklist of people to target, of people to censor, of people to demonetize, of people to de-platform in different ways, sometimes overtly, sometimes subvertly, and they've done it all the way through to try to influence the elections in the UK and Europe.
[01:56:29.821 --> 01:56:29.961]  Wow.
[01:56:46.789 --> 01:56:54.854]  That was a fake investigation into a few low-level ads by a Russian internet troll company that had zero impact and influence on the election.
[01:56:54.854 --> 01:56:55.094]  You said it.
[01:56:55.094 --> 01:56:56.235]  We're coming back in two minutes.
[01:56:56.235 --> 01:57:04.821]  But this is historic election meddling by the bureaucrats that have parlayed power to the deep state, big tech, for their own enrichment.
[01:57:04.821 --> 01:57:06.302]  They have stolen the First Amendment.
[01:57:06.302 --> 01:57:10.665]  They are trying to convert us to an authoritarian model with big media.
[01:57:11.676 --> 01:57:17.147]  With the universities and then there's Trump and other nationals getting elected everywhere and despite
[01:57:18.405 --> 01:57:28.173]  All the oppression, all the censorship, all the tyranny, we're set to see all across the EU anti-globalist nationalists being elected.
[01:57:28.173 --> 01:57:29.854]  So how do you think they strike back?
[01:57:29.854 --> 01:57:36.139]  We'll ask Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, these questions on the other side and more.

[01:57:55.727 --> 01:57:57.729]  And the globalists are so upset.
[01:57:57.729 --> 01:58:00.551]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[01:58:01.909 --> 01:58:02.209]  That's right.

[01:59:50.734 --> 01:59:53.437]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:19.258 --> 02:00:29.642]  Alright, constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes laying out devastating evidence that the Democratic Party is a cancer, absorbing the government, engaged in tyrannical investigations.
[02:00:29.642 --> 02:00:30.903]  What's coming next?
[02:00:30.903 --> 02:00:33.344]  We're getting into election meddling.
[02:00:33.344 --> 02:00:41.427]  Facebook admits mainline parties in Spain and Greece and the UK, they're banning them, they're blocking them.
[02:00:41.427 --> 02:00:43.888]  It's just, it's just incredible.
[02:00:43.888 --> 02:00:44.808]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:00:44.808 --> 02:00:48.530]  I mean, here we had a two-year investigation, over $40 million.
[02:00:49.460 --> 02:00:52.365]  Spent on behalf of the Mueller team.
[02:00:52.365 --> 02:01:02.301]  Because purportedly, election meddling by Big Tech, or election meddling by foreign governments using Big Tech, was a great clear and present danger to the future of democracy.
[02:01:03.041 --> 02:01:11.105]  Well, there was actually no real election meddling that took place in the 2016 election that favored Trump of any great consequence of any kind.
[02:01:11.105 --> 02:01:25.213]  And as the Evan Muller, one of the corrupt actors on behalf of the deep state who hired a huge, notorious anti-Trump prosecutorial team of a lot of ethically challenged prosecutors concluded, no collusion, no obstruction, no crime.
[02:01:25.805 --> 02:01:53.968]  And yet despite that, now that we have real election meddling taking place, and there was evidence of election meddling by Facebook and others, by the founder of LinkedIn in the 2017 Alabama election that was later outed by the New York Times even, we had election meddling alleged in 2018, and now we have clear, undisputed, undeniable evidence of election meddling throughout the European elections where a blacklist of Facebook, where Facebook was blacklisting certain people,
[02:01:54.355 --> 02:02:13.500]  Targeting them for the purposes of interfering and impairing the electoral outcomes in the 2019 European Union parliamentary elections in the European Union because the Brexit party was surging in the United Kingdom, the populist parties were surging in Spain, surging in France, surging in Italy, surging in Greece.
[02:02:13.865 --> 02:02:29.021]  For the purposes of challenging the European Union's totalitarian and authoritarian structure to ideally undermine and end the European Union altogether as an experiment, as an undemocratic, anti-democratic experiment that was partially designed by a former Nazi.
[02:02:29.457 --> 02:02:35.883]  So here you have this critical time period where the future of Europe and the world could change and what did the big tech do?
[02:02:35.883 --> 02:02:48.754]  They deliberately and intentionally meddled in the election by targeting people so that people wouldn't see their messages, people wouldn't hear their messages, such that people if they did see or hear their messages they saw or heard them in a negative light.
[02:02:48.754 --> 02:02:53.899]  Just as sort of you were the tip of the spear for what they're doing in the United States and in large parts of the world since
[02:02:54.252 --> 02:03:00.758]  Infowars has a substantial following in Canada and Australia and the United Kingdom where these elections were taking place.
[02:03:00.758 --> 02:03:07.004]  Part of it was removing the best anti-globalist advocates from the public sphere right during the critical election time period.
[02:03:07.004 --> 02:03:11.088]  But despite that, they're still losing everywhere.
[02:03:11.088 --> 02:03:16.173]  What do you expect them to do now if they lose these elections, which the numbers show they will?
[02:03:17.168 --> 02:03:19.570]  I think what you're seeing the Democratic House do.
[02:03:19.570 --> 02:03:26.675]  So how did the Democratic House respond to the president winning and even Mueller having to admit he was completely innocent?
[02:03:26.675 --> 02:03:35.301]  What they did was they decided to launch their own witch hunt of unparalleled and unprecedented scale for the purposes of personal embarrassment and attack.
[02:03:35.751 --> 02:03:42.894]  So I think you're going to see the same thing happen across the world when they fail in these elections, when the populists succeed in these elections.
[02:03:42.894 --> 02:03:45.015]  You're going to see a wholesale onslaught.
[02:03:45.015 --> 02:03:46.896]  You're already seeing it somewhere in the United Kingdom.
[02:03:46.896 --> 02:03:56.541]  In the United Kingdom, you have members of the press and big corporations basically greenlighting, encouraging, joking about physical assaults and attacks on Nigel Farage.
[02:03:56.923 --> 02:03:58.844]  They're now calling it milkshaking.
[02:03:58.844 --> 02:04:01.305]  It's not going to stop there.
[02:04:01.305 --> 02:04:05.868]  It's going to start by throwing things at people, and then it's going to go to physical attacks on people.
[02:04:05.868 --> 02:04:09.570]  Oh, it's already bricks and acid attacks.
[02:04:09.570 --> 02:04:13.052]  Mainline News is saying throw acid on Nigel Farage.
[02:04:13.052 --> 02:04:17.294]  Don't they get if that actually happens, then the green light is to kill a bunch of leftists?
[02:04:17.294 --> 02:04:21.857]  I mean, it's crazy how they don't think two-dimensionally.
[02:04:21.857 --> 02:04:24.499]  Well, I think to the degree they do, they're trying to recreate the 1930s.
[02:04:25.618 --> 02:04:31.881]  In the 1930s, the communists were very successful at getting people to become violent in the street and counter to it.
[02:04:31.881 --> 02:04:36.743]  And what it did is it gave rise to fascism and gave rise to other dynamics.
[02:04:36.743 --> 02:04:37.724]  All right.
[02:04:37.724 --> 02:04:38.824]  Robert Barnes is our guest.
[02:04:38.824 --> 02:04:39.445]  One more segment.
[02:04:39.445 --> 02:04:47.248]  I want to shift gears into courts telling us we can't talk about kids being sterilized in Canada and more.
[02:04:47.248 --> 02:04:47.749]  That's right.
[02:04:47.749 --> 02:04:48.329]  Tip of the spear.
[02:04:48.329 --> 02:04:50.510]  A bunch of breaking news in 60 seconds.
[02:04:50.510 --> 02:04:51.791]  On the other side, NewsWars.com.
[02:04:56.653 --> 02:04:57.955]  Shut down our speech!
[02:04:57.955 --> 02:05:03.461]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[02:05:03.461 --> 02:05:10.970]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:12.311]  Are you coming back?
[02:05:12.311 --> 02:05:13.452]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[02:05:14.053 --> 02:05:15.414]  We're at NewsWords.com.
[02:05:15.414 --> 02:05:17.637]  Paul Watson's launched his own Summit.News.
[02:05:17.637 --> 02:05:19.659]  We have our own videos, we have our own articles.
[02:05:19.659 --> 02:05:24.423]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars is still chugging along.
[02:05:24.423 --> 02:05:26.686]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[02:05:26.686 --> 02:05:28.247]  InfoWars!
[02:05:28.247 --> 02:05:31.571]  Don't tell me!
[02:05:31.571 --> 02:05:31.651]  Woo!
[02:05:33.027 --> 02:05:35.930]  InfoWars.com, because that's a bunch of people out here.
[02:05:35.930 --> 02:05:37.611]  I'm talking about InfoWars.com.
[02:05:37.611 --> 02:05:40.334]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:05:40.334 --> 02:05:42.556]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[02:05:42.556 --> 02:05:46.059]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[02:05:46.059 --> 02:05:48.822]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[02:05:48.822 --> 02:05:51.084]  People go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[02:05:51.084 --> 02:05:52.165]  That's where they find it.
[02:05:52.165 --> 02:05:54.086]  You know, there's things called websites.
[02:05:54.086 --> 02:05:54.487]  Just go there.
[02:06:00.467 --> 02:06:07.049]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:06:07.049 --> 02:06:18.573]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:18.573 --> 02:06:27.457]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:27.457 --> 02:06:28.417]  Alright, it was probably
[02:06:29.654 --> 02:06:32.177]  Four, five, six months ago, we first had Barnes on.
[02:06:32.177 --> 02:06:35.640]  I know he was for years on the news.
[02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:36.921]  They said, watch Avenatti.
[02:06:36.921 --> 02:06:38.343]  He's a corrupt lawyer.
[02:06:38.343 --> 02:06:39.684]  He's the front man for the Democrats.
[02:06:39.684 --> 02:06:42.027]  When he fails, they'll flush him.
[02:06:42.027 --> 02:06:42.988]  I said, you know what?
[02:06:42.988 --> 02:06:44.829]  Well, now he got indicted again.
[02:06:44.829 --> 02:06:47.913]  I just want to spend a few minutes on him because he's archetypal.
[02:06:49.284 --> 02:06:52.247]  The Democrats build up these people as invincible.
[02:06:52.247 --> 02:06:53.568]  He's going to be president.
[02:06:53.568 --> 02:06:54.349]  He's God.
[02:06:54.349 --> 02:06:55.951]  He's the Lord and Savior.
[02:06:55.951 --> 02:06:57.432]  You can't stop him.
[02:06:57.432 --> 02:06:58.593]  Everything he says is true.
[02:06:58.593 --> 02:07:01.856]  And then now he's getting indicted and sued.
[02:07:01.856 --> 02:07:07.302]  It just shows how the Democrats put on a good con game, but that's it.
[02:07:08.618 --> 02:07:09.579]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:07:09.579 --> 02:07:14.825]  Here you have sort of a penultimate example of the politically motivated Democratic warrior.
[02:07:14.825 --> 02:07:22.193]  And they're people that are ethically challenged, people that are morally conflicted, people that rarely are clean or honest in their background.
[02:07:22.193 --> 02:07:29.942]  So as soon as Avenatti came to fame, I started putting out public information that this was a very dangerous threat to the ordinary individual and client.
[02:07:30.482 --> 02:07:33.645]  To his own clients, not just to other people and parties.
[02:07:33.645 --> 02:07:41.172]  And it said so broadly, it said so on a wide scale, talked to various government officials and others, and said this man is a unique level of threat.
[02:07:41.172 --> 02:07:53.224]  And here you had CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, Washington Post, all these major publications giving him literally hundreds of millions of dollars in free air time.
[02:07:53.504 --> 02:07:57.328]  Promoting him as a Democratic candidate for the presidency of the United States.
[02:07:57.328 --> 02:08:05.755]  Brian Stelter was just mumbling and was just sort of foaming at the mouth talking about how wonderful Avenatti was.
[02:08:05.755 --> 02:08:07.497]  It was just absurd and ludicrous.
[02:08:07.497 --> 02:08:11.260]  Because of it, a whole bunch of people hired Avenatti, who never should.
[02:08:11.260 --> 02:08:14.463]  His background, I was aware of him in LA in Orange County.
[02:08:14.463 --> 02:08:15.204]  That's where he's from.
[02:08:15.564 --> 02:08:16.925]  He overlapped with some clients.
[02:08:16.925 --> 02:08:19.246]  There were people that had fired him and hired me.
[02:08:19.246 --> 02:08:23.068]  So I was aware of his background and had said, this guy's basically, he's a fraudster.
[02:08:23.068 --> 02:08:23.908]  He's a cheat.
[02:08:23.908 --> 02:08:24.808]  He's an evader.
[02:08:24.808 --> 02:08:26.429]  He's disloyal and dishonest.
[02:08:26.429 --> 02:08:27.290]  He's dishonorable.
[02:08:27.290 --> 02:08:36.754]  And what I publicly predicted about a year ago and then predicted right here on InfoWars was that he would be in prison long before, while President Trump was still in office.
[02:08:37.154 --> 02:08:39.235]  Well, the media was predicting the opposite.
[02:08:39.235 --> 02:08:42.136]  So the effect of it, here's what he's been indicted for.
[02:08:42.136 --> 02:08:44.618]  He's been indicted for attempting to extort Nike.
[02:08:44.618 --> 02:08:47.539]  He's been indicted, by the way, he did that through Twitter.
[02:08:47.539 --> 02:08:50.180]  He used his Twitter account to engage in the extortion.
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:58.304]  So here, Twitter is so concerned about bad actions and bad activities, and yet they completely ban you without really any explanation or meaning whatsoever.
[02:08:58.824 --> 02:09:11.756]  Uh, while Michael Avenatti, a criminal who used their services to engage in criminal extortion, according to the United States government, the Southern District of New York, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York, uh, there's been no action on his account whatsoever.
[02:09:11.756 --> 02:09:17.181]  But then it was not only that, he has subsequently been indicted for a bunch, for a defrauding a disabled man.
[02:09:17.574 --> 02:09:34.881]  Who he kept telling him that in fact the his money his settlement hadn't come in yet, but he was going to lend him money out of his own pocket while he was actually using the actual settlement proceeds from his own disabled client to buy a private plane and to fly private planes and pay for his Ferrari payments.
[02:09:34.881 --> 02:09:35.841]  Then on top of that.
[02:09:36.517 --> 02:09:40.643]  He was defrauding a wide range of other clients, business partners, employees.
[02:09:40.643 --> 02:09:42.986]  He fired a woman because she was pregnant.
[02:09:42.986 --> 02:09:43.667]  She sued him.
[02:09:43.667 --> 02:09:45.009]  She got a judgment against him.
[02:09:45.009 --> 02:09:47.112]  He refused to pay it, defrauded her.
[02:09:47.112 --> 02:09:49.375]  He defrauded various employees.
[02:09:49.375 --> 02:09:52.439]  He was taking employees' payroll taxes and pocketing it instead.
[02:09:53.079 --> 02:10:05.610]  It'll take hours to go over it, but you were calling him out, you said, over a year ago, here on the air, predicting it.
[02:10:05.610 --> 02:10:09.133]  Why would the Democrats choose him as their god?
[02:10:09.133 --> 02:10:10.174]  They just keep doing this.
[02:10:12.091 --> 02:10:13.132]  Because he's conflicted.
[02:10:13.132 --> 02:10:14.492]  Because he's corrupted.
[02:10:14.492 --> 02:10:24.458]  The problem with an honest lawyer for the Democratic Party is it runs a risk that he or she will refuse to do their bidding when the time comes.
[02:10:24.458 --> 02:10:25.779]  I call it the Snowden problem.
[02:10:25.779 --> 02:10:36.885]  In other words, if you have someone with an independent conscience who will act on that independent conscience when they see illegality, even if done on behalf of their own favorite political party, then you can't have that person in a position of power.
[02:10:36.885 --> 02:10:41.128]  So the reason why they prefer a guy like Avenatti and large members of the press
[02:10:41.727 --> 02:10:42.147]  That's right.
[02:11:02.133 --> 02:11:06.156]  So the, he was such a, it's the reason why socialism often doesn't work.
[02:11:06.156 --> 02:11:09.518]  It's a problem of power, not a problem necessarily of ideas.
[02:11:09.518 --> 02:11:12.420]  The problem of power is that you put any certain person in power.
[02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:18.984]  Exactly, you put people over the larger well of money and ideas, they're going to steal it, unless they're the ones that developed it.
[02:11:18.984 --> 02:11:22.887]  And still they will too, but somebody that just is put over it will certainly steal it.
[02:11:22.887 --> 02:11:24.448]  So where do you predict he goes?
[02:11:24.448 --> 02:11:27.710]  Because they bring in these superstars, they just hope we forget about them.
[02:11:28.688 --> 02:11:29.491]  Absolutely.
[02:11:29.491 --> 02:11:31.339]  I mean, he currently faces 404 years in federal prison.
[02:11:32.935 --> 02:11:37.197]  So my guess is that he ultimately cuts a deal and probably does it.
[02:11:37.197 --> 02:11:38.898]  They're going to need him to do at least 10 years.
[02:11:38.898 --> 02:11:39.719]  He'll be disbarred.
[02:11:39.719 --> 02:11:40.940]  He'll have to give up all his money.
[02:11:40.940 --> 02:11:44.182]  He'll be back begging on the street someplace.
[02:11:44.182 --> 02:11:47.043]  Maybe he'll work side-by-side with Stormy Daniels in various clubs.
[02:11:47.043 --> 02:11:54.087]  Sure, I just see it as emblematic of how everything the left does, like Mueller or like the Covington kids or like Schmollet.
[02:11:54.087 --> 02:11:55.348]  It's all just empty.
[02:11:55.348 --> 02:12:01.652]  Speaking of the devil, here is the view just literally a few months ago worshipping Avenatti.
[02:12:01.652 --> 02:12:01.992]  Here it is.
[02:12:04.311 --> 02:12:06.252]  Lately, to me, you're like the Holy Spirit.
[02:12:06.252 --> 02:12:10.492]  You are all places at all times.
[02:12:10.492 --> 02:12:11.453]  I mean, I do.
[02:12:11.453 --> 02:12:13.373]  I see you all over cable news.
[02:12:13.373 --> 02:12:14.053]  I see you.
[02:12:14.053 --> 02:12:18.374]  You know, there is a seat available if you want to be a co-host at the VA.
[02:12:18.374 --> 02:12:21.155]  There's people here you can pitch.
[02:12:21.155 --> 02:12:25.816]  He'd make a great lady around the table.
[02:12:25.816 --> 02:12:27.356]  And I have the same issue with Giuliani.
[02:12:27.356 --> 02:12:28.476]  He's everywhere.
[02:12:28.476 --> 02:12:32.197]  And so I question myself when I see Giuliani once I see you on TV so much.
[02:12:33.070 --> 02:12:34.933]  When do you have time to be lawyering?
[02:12:34.933 --> 02:12:36.175]  To be doing, like, real lawyering?
[02:12:36.175 --> 02:12:44.647]  Because you're, I mean, you're representing, you know, migrants, you're representing... But here's a bigger calling here, that being a lawyer is minimal compared to what he's doing.
[02:12:44.647 --> 02:12:45.689]  The priesthood?
[02:12:45.689 --> 02:12:46.430]  Whatever.
[02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:47.932]  He's out there saving the country.
[02:12:48.433 --> 02:12:59.079]  I'm very fortunate in that I'm surrounded by a staff and other very qualified attorneys and people that support me and that are doing great work relating to our cases and the work that we've done.
[02:12:59.079 --> 02:13:02.701]  And look, we've published a lot of our filings in the case.
[02:13:02.701 --> 02:13:05.943]  People can look at the quality of the work that we've done from a legal basis.
[02:13:05.943 --> 02:13:07.344]  And this is a two-pronged fight.
[02:13:07.344 --> 02:13:08.305]  Let's be clear about this.
[02:13:08.305 --> 02:13:12.027]  This is a fight not only in the court of law, but also in the court of public opinion.
[02:13:12.367 --> 02:13:20.271]  And the amount of media attention that we have received and the amount of media appearances that I've made has actually benefited my client, Stormy Daniels, and others.
[02:13:20.271 --> 02:13:20.951]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:13:20.951 --> 02:13:22.092]  I can't watch anymore of it.
[02:13:22.092 --> 02:13:27.954]  So here's this literal vampire, but what is it with leftists that they don't know they're going to get busted?
[02:13:27.954 --> 02:13:30.896]  Like, just this instinct to crime, crime, crime.
[02:13:30.896 --> 02:13:31.336]  What is that?
[02:13:33.056 --> 02:13:47.732]  I think it's a reflection and a projection on the core personality of a lot of Democratic politicians, that fundamentally they're corrupt, that fundamentally they know they're hypocrites, that fundamentally they're deceitful, that what Avenatti was is he personified the modern-day Democratic Party.
[02:13:48.132 --> 02:13:48.773]  We're good to go.
[02:14:05.652 --> 02:14:08.014]  At core, all they really care about is power.
[02:14:08.014 --> 02:14:09.114]  They say they care about the environment.
[02:14:09.114 --> 02:14:11.936]  Well, do you want to tell me what you told me privately six months ago?
[02:14:11.936 --> 02:14:22.183]  I mean, I'm not going to get into private conversations, but you just basically said what his business was and who others' businesses were, and they're like, you've been up against him, and that's why you couldn't stand him.
[02:14:22.183 --> 02:14:22.724]  Oh, no question.
[02:14:22.724 --> 02:14:30.269]  I mean, this was someone who posed an imminent threat, a clear and present danger to ordinary people who would entrust him with their legal affairs.
[02:14:30.871 --> 02:14:34.233]  And it's like trusting the government with democratic power.
[02:14:34.233 --> 02:14:41.717]  At core, they'll say that what they're doing is for some great righteous cause, for some great just purpose, when in fact it's just a power grab.
[02:14:42.239 --> 02:14:50.744]  So like a lot of these lawsuits that are out there that they claim, well, we want to protect people and so forth, when really they just want a power grab against the dissident voices they dislike.
[02:14:50.744 --> 02:14:52.264]  So that's all Avenatti was.
[02:14:52.264 --> 02:15:02.670]  Avenatti was a power grab to allow the Democratic Party to defame the president, to slander and smear him based on the allegations of a liar and a liar's liar and the lawyer.
[02:15:03.110 --> 02:15:15.444]  And what he reflects and represents and personifies is how the Democratic Party currently operates, which in the name of justice, in the name of righteousness, in the name of the good cause, they actually just seek power for its own sake and for their own sake.
[02:15:15.444 --> 02:15:21.630]  And that's why corruption sits at the core, the center, the heart and the soul of the modern day left and why they approach things.
[02:15:21.630 --> 02:15:24.754]  And you can never trust that their objectives are what they say they are.
[02:15:25.137 --> 02:15:27.218]  All right, Robert Barnes, I said I was having you for an hour.
[02:15:27.218 --> 02:15:30.479]  Now it's 915 minutes, but we did not hit Canadian court.
[02:15:30.479 --> 02:15:33.180]  Tries to stop Alex Jones from covering trans child abuse.
[02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:33.560]  I promise.
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:34.841]  We'll go to break for a few minutes, come back.
[02:15:34.841 --> 02:15:36.321]  We'll do two, three minutes on this.
[02:15:36.321 --> 02:15:38.202]  Let you get back to your important work you're on.

[02:17:39.889 --> 02:17:43.670]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.

[02:20:15.970 --> 02:20:19.192]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is our guest.
[02:20:19.192 --> 02:20:24.375]  We've covered the waterfront here, but the story up on InfoWars.com.
[02:20:24.375 --> 02:20:26.036]  People say, hey, stand up for the kids.
[02:20:26.036 --> 02:20:27.137]  Hey, you know, cover it.
[02:20:27.137 --> 02:20:31.719]  Well, we have kids from New Mexico, California, Michigan, Texas.
[02:20:31.719 --> 02:20:35.682]  We have fathers on, mainly, where it'll be the little boy, usually.
[02:20:35.682 --> 02:20:37.242]  Sometimes the little girl.
[02:20:37.242 --> 02:20:39.484]  And the school convinces them, hey, you're really a boy or a girl.
[02:20:41.229 --> 02:20:53.277]  So at age eight, they start giving them chemicals that stop their growth, cause all sorts of health problems, but try to change their hormones from a girl to a boy or girl to a boy.
[02:20:53.277 --> 02:20:59.481]  And now we covered one of the cases in Canada where the father didn't want this to happen.
[02:21:01.505 --> 02:21:05.307]  And I saw that the court was trying to say you couldn't even report on it basically.
[02:21:05.307 --> 02:21:13.412]  We got these letters from them saying we couldn't link to a public file on a previous court ruling.
[02:21:13.412 --> 02:21:19.015]  Canadian court tries to stop Alex Jones from covering trans child case.
[02:21:19.015 --> 02:21:22.977]  Case transitions from battle over parental rights to free speech.
[02:21:22.977 --> 02:21:23.918]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:21:25.666 --> 02:21:32.229]  If you care about these kids and care about what we're facing, to tell you what's happening, please make it matter and spread the article.
[02:21:32.229 --> 02:21:35.011]  Robert Barnes, you've looked into this for us.
[02:21:35.011 --> 02:21:37.392]  You're a lawyer also for M4s.
[02:21:37.392 --> 02:21:40.273]  What do you make of this?
[02:21:40.273 --> 02:21:44.575]  It's extraordinary, and it's also frightening the scope and the scale of it.
[02:21:44.575 --> 02:21:53.720]  Because what you're talking about is, first you have a court overruling a parent about their own guidance for their own child.
[02:21:54.107 --> 02:21:59.971]  Which can have life lasting effects on the psychology and biology of the child.
[02:21:59.971 --> 02:22:07.596]  Second, you have a court banning him, the parent, from publicly talking about public actions of public officials.
[02:22:07.596 --> 02:22:11.138]  Including government officials, the court officials, and health officials.
[02:22:11.138 --> 02:22:12.519]  And then they took it a third step.
[02:22:13.024 --> 02:22:20.126]  And said, no one can discuss the name or identity of any of the public officials involved on the health side of the equation.
[02:22:20.126 --> 02:22:26.307]  So it's an extraordinarily, it's an order that would be completely unconstitutional in all likelihood in the United States.
[02:22:26.307 --> 02:22:34.669]  But Canada, like Europe, like most of the rest of the world, doesn't have the same First Amendment protections that the United States does.
[02:22:34.669 --> 02:22:39.450]  So that's why they can get away with it there in a way they probably could not get away with it here.
[02:22:39.850 --> 02:22:41.172]  But still it's frightening.
[02:22:41.172 --> 02:22:48.840]  And what it reveals is the court recognizes and the court realizes that in fact this is unpopular opinion.
[02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:51.643]  This is not an opinion supported by the public will.
[02:22:51.643 --> 02:22:54.826]  And so they know they would lose in the court of public opinion.
[02:22:54.826 --> 02:22:56.308]  So they use a pretext.
[02:22:56.308 --> 02:22:58.290]  And their pretext is an intriguing one.
[02:22:58.290 --> 02:23:00.012]  It says if public opinion
[02:23:00.712 --> 02:23:08.536]  So if you want to win any court case where you're, in my view, abusing a child, ruining their life, you just small it and put a threat against yourself.
[02:23:29.730 --> 02:23:30.370]  Exactly.
[02:23:30.370 --> 02:23:31.911]  That's all you got to do now.
[02:23:31.911 --> 02:23:35.253]  And then you'll run to the court and the court will say, nobody can talk about this.
[02:23:35.253 --> 02:23:49.379]  I mean, there's a core problem with causation, with assuming or asserting causation connected to public tragedies and travesties, or even the threats of action, which happen all the time, and the actions of other officials.
[02:23:49.379 --> 02:23:51.320]  In the Covington case, I was attacked.
[02:23:52.020 --> 02:24:03.735]  After I was attacked by institutional members of the press and others, my law offices were threatened with such a viable bomb threat that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had to launch an open inquiry.
[02:24:03.735 --> 02:24:09.302]  What I did not do is go around and say everybody that's been critical of me can no longer be critical of me because of this fact.
[02:24:10.263 --> 02:24:12.385]  That's just the reality of the world in which we live.
[02:24:12.385 --> 02:24:16.208]  And we shouldn't correlate or have causation between the two.
[02:24:16.208 --> 02:24:21.993]  And we should never use somebody else's wayward action as an excuse to suppress and censor.
[02:24:21.993 --> 02:24:24.515]  And not just here, but all over the world.
[02:24:24.515 --> 02:24:25.556]  It's the same thing.
[02:24:25.556 --> 02:24:28.238]  I won't get into the particulars because we don't have time.
[02:24:28.238 --> 02:24:31.021]  Not because we've been threatened, you know, with legal action.
[02:24:31.721 --> 02:24:35.784]  There are public lawyers that go around attacking you and me all day on the biggest shows in the country.
[02:24:35.784 --> 02:24:41.207]  And then if we respond back, they freak out and run to court saying we should be silenced.
[02:24:41.207 --> 02:24:45.670]  Like this brewery that said, don't hit people with milkshakes, hit them in the head with bricks.
[02:24:45.670 --> 02:24:47.552]  And somebody said, man, you're asking for trouble.
[02:24:47.552 --> 02:24:50.173]  They went, oh my God, we're being threatened and called the police.
[02:24:50.173 --> 02:24:53.235]  They're going out and saying, assault people with deadly weapons.
[02:24:53.235 --> 02:24:55.177]  We go, hey, that's pretty dangerous.
[02:24:55.177 --> 02:24:57.078]  Don't say, oh my God, that's a threat.
[02:24:57.078 --> 02:25:01.241]  I mean, it's like cartoon how the left acts in their little SJW bubbles.
[02:25:02.662 --> 02:25:03.803]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:25:03.803 --> 02:25:04.863]  And it's just very dangerous.
[02:25:04.863 --> 02:25:22.556]  I mean, here you have an extraordinary ruling about something that is still hotly controverted and debated within both even the liberal schools of psychology and biology and the medical profession about whether or not someone who's 12, 13 or 14 can make a decision about their own gender.
[02:25:22.936 --> 02:25:31.120]  Whether or not that's gender dysphoria, or whether or not that's a psychologically well-reasoned and healthy decision.
[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:35.442]  Even within the liberal and the left fields of academia, that's a controversial question.
[02:25:35.442 --> 02:25:36.282]  Yeah, I mean, let's be clear.
[02:25:36.282 --> 02:25:38.663]  Maybe one out of ten million is a real hermaphrodite.
[02:25:38.663 --> 02:25:40.404]  That person could argue they're one or the other.
[02:25:40.404 --> 02:25:41.745]  Fine, we don't care.
[02:25:41.745 --> 02:25:43.846]  Just don't try to teach five-year-olds they're something else.
[02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:59.000]  Not only that, here, forcing, over the father's objection, the child to undergo medical experimentation and biological alteration for a decision that someone at that age is unlikely to be able to meaningfully process.
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:04.965]  This is school-sponsored, Joseph Mingala-level experimentation, but as long as you say it's liberal, it's okay.
[02:26:05.911 --> 02:26:06.571]  Exactly.
[02:26:06.571 --> 02:26:17.174]  And then you get a couple of leftist doctors who have their own opinions about the field, injecting their own political biases into the process, and that was what was being publicly discussed.
[02:26:17.174 --> 02:26:22.535]  And that is what the Canadian court said, these people cannot be discussed.
[02:26:22.535 --> 02:26:24.515]  What about extra-judicially, or is that the term?
[02:26:24.515 --> 02:26:27.876]  Extra-border?
[02:26:27.876 --> 02:26:30.517]  What's the term outside of their own jurisdiction?
[02:26:30.517 --> 02:26:32.597]  Extra-jurisdictionally?
[02:26:32.597 --> 02:26:35.238]  What's the term that they're now telling me what I can say in Texas?
[02:26:36.626 --> 02:26:38.468]  It's extra-jurisdictional.
[02:26:38.468 --> 02:26:42.452]  It's also, it's basically a prior restraint.
[02:26:42.452 --> 02:26:47.417]  So in the U.S., prior restraints on speech are almost completely prohibited.
[02:26:47.417 --> 02:26:50.821]  It's just very rare that you can do any form of prior restraining on speech.
[02:26:50.821 --> 02:26:55.906]  And that's why this order is likely not effective in the United States.
[02:26:55.906 --> 02:27:00.070]  But it is effective in Canada, and there is a substantial InfoWars audience in Canada.
[02:27:00.490 --> 02:27:11.913]  And so what they effectively did is prevent the Infowars audience and any other audience in Canada from hearing from the father, from hearing about the individuals involved and whether they were tainted by political bias.
[02:27:11.913 --> 02:27:27.636]  Because, I mean, as a general rule, if you're a medical professional, you get involved in a public proceeding, you've already been named in that public proceeding, you say that your opinion was warranted by science and had no inflection... Look, when you're sterilizing kids in the name of transgenderism, you better be ready to be in public.
[02:27:28.712 --> 02:27:29.433]  Exactly.
[02:27:29.433 --> 02:27:29.774]  Be ready.
[02:27:29.774 --> 02:27:31.938]  If you're right, then you can defend yourself.
[02:27:31.938 --> 02:27:34.482]  Because what you've done is shocking to many people.
[02:27:34.482 --> 02:27:36.085]  You've overridden a father.
[02:27:36.085 --> 02:27:40.272]  You're making a decision that can alter the child's biology and psychology for life.
[02:27:40.734 --> 02:27:47.159]  When he is still a child and by law is not considered competent to make decisions of that kind and caliber for himself.
[02:27:47.159 --> 02:27:48.200]  You believe you're right.
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:51.483]  It's controversial even in your field amongst fellow leftists.
[02:27:51.483 --> 02:27:53.705]  So you better be ready and able to defend it.
[02:27:53.705 --> 02:27:59.510]  And rather than defend your opinion, the very first thing you do is you run to court and tell the court you need a special safe space.
[02:27:59.970 --> 02:28:10.658]  Where you can't be publicly criticized or questioned or investigated for what you did and why you did it, and you're immune from public criticism for a decision that the public is deeply curious about.
[02:28:10.658 --> 02:28:11.098]  That's right.
[02:28:11.098 --> 02:28:17.502]  When you're sterilizing kids, because that's the end game of this, that's the end result, and just biologically, you better be ready for scrutiny.
[02:28:17.502 --> 02:28:19.344]  Robert Barnes, I just, this popped in my head.
[02:28:19.904 --> 02:28:21.105]  I gotta call Joe Rogan.
[02:28:21.105 --> 02:28:22.847]  We gotta get you on his show.
[02:28:22.847 --> 02:28:28.193]  As soon as I'm off air today, if you're ready to do it, you're a great constitutional lawyer on free speech.
[02:28:28.193 --> 02:28:29.614]  I think he'd probably interview you.
[02:28:29.614 --> 02:28:30.735]  You need to get out there.
[02:28:30.735 --> 02:28:31.476]  You're amazing.
[02:28:31.476 --> 02:28:32.978]  Thank you so much for all the time.
[02:28:32.978 --> 02:28:33.718]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:28:33.718 --> 02:28:36.181]  You're gonna be here later next week in Austin.
[02:28:36.181 --> 02:28:37.522]  Thank you, sir.
[02:28:37.522 --> 02:28:37.903]  Absolutely.
[02:28:38.578 --> 02:28:40.641]  He'll be in studio next week several days with us.
[02:28:40.641 --> 02:28:42.543]  All right, Millie Weaver's coming up straight ahead.
[02:28:42.543 --> 02:28:45.647]  Man, that was a powerful hour and a half.
[02:28:45.647 --> 02:28:46.969]  That's what it's all about.
[02:28:46.969 --> 02:28:51.014]  It's why I thank you all, the listeners, for making this show possible and this amazing crew.
[02:28:55.228 --> 02:28:57.910]  Everyone knows, even good people fall on hard times.
[02:28:57.910 --> 02:29:01.314]  Your credit cards get maxed out, and you get behind on your taxes.
[02:29:01.314 --> 02:29:05.998]  Unfortunately, the IRS is not as understanding, and they won't stop until they collect.
[02:29:05.998 --> 02:29:10.662]  They have the power to take your paycheck, freeze your bank accounts, even your home or business could be at risk.
[02:29:10.862 --> 02:29:14.204]  It's simply not worth it to take on the IRS by yourself.
[02:29:14.204 --> 02:29:16.806]  You need to call the experts at Optima Tax Relief.
[02:29:16.806 --> 02:29:19.508]  When you call, be sure to ask about the Fresh Start Initiative.

[02:30:57.879 --> 02:30:59.820]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:30:59.820 --> 02:31:00.641]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:31:00.641 --> 02:31:02.001]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:31:02.001 --> 02:31:03.522]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:31:03.522 --> 02:31:04.303]  I'm so excited.
[02:31:04.303 --> 02:31:05.223]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:31:05.223 --> 02:31:07.705]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:31:07.705 --> 02:31:10.206]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[02:31:10.206 --> 02:31:11.627]  The Bone Broth.
[02:31:11.627 --> 02:31:13.068]  The Bone Broth.
[02:31:13.068 --> 02:31:14.449]  The Bone Broth.
[02:31:14.449 --> 02:31:15.709]  The Bone Broth.
[02:31:15.709 --> 02:31:18.971]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake.
[02:31:18.971 --> 02:31:20.452]  You know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:31:20.452 --> 02:31:21.893]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:31:21.893 --> 02:31:23.074]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:31:23.074 --> 02:31:24.855]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[02:31:24.855 --> 02:31:25.495]  Like good.
[02:31:25.955 --> 02:31:26.536]  Whoa!
[02:31:26.536 --> 02:31:28.257]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:31:28.257 --> 02:31:32.460]  My daughter uses the Bubble Gum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[02:31:32.460 --> 02:31:36.262]  I've used the Super Male Vitality, a host of other products.
[02:31:36.262 --> 02:31:38.283]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:31:38.283 --> 02:31:40.845]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping me on air.
[02:31:40.845 --> 02:31:41.586]  I'm thanking you.
[02:31:41.586 --> 02:31:48.030]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[02:31:48.030 --> 02:31:48.770]  It is next level.
[02:31:48.770 --> 02:31:49.431]  It really is good.
[02:31:49.431 --> 02:31:49.991]  So thank you.
[02:31:49.991 --> 02:31:51.912]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:31:51.912 --> 02:31:52.293]  Thank you.
[02:31:56.061 --> 02:32:07.126]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and backed up with human waste and debris.
[02:32:07.126 --> 02:32:15.990]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine products and safe sex products.
[02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:19.992]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[02:32:20.672 --> 02:32:27.155]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged, and just like pipes get clogged, the human body gets clogged just like that.
[02:32:27.155 --> 02:32:29.315]  And you may be experiencing back-up too.
[02:32:29.315 --> 02:32:35.258]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to Infowarsstore.com and get Oxy-Powder.
[02:32:35.258 --> 02:32:37.819]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.
[02:32:38.499 --> 02:32:48.905]  If you're experiencing some cloggage, some backup of your own, Oxy-Powder from Infowarsstore.com will clear it out, guaranteed.
[02:32:48.905 --> 02:32:59.212]  So go to Infowarsstore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with Oxy-Powder.
[02:32:59.212 --> 02:33:01.833]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:30.115 --> 02:33:40.928]  So I came here to do a meeting on infrastructure with Democrats, not really thinking they wanted to do infrastructure or anything else other than investigate.
[02:33:40.928 --> 02:33:49.999]  And I just saw that Nancy Pelosi, just before our meeting, made a statement that we believe that the President of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.
[02:33:50.785 --> 02:34:00.711]  Well, it turns out I'm the most, and I think most of you would agree to this, I'm the most transparent president probably in the history of this country.
[02:34:00.711 --> 02:34:07.275]  We have given, on a witch hunt, on a hoax, the whole thing with Russia was a hoax.
[02:34:08.507 --> 02:34:17.130]  As it relates to the Trump administration and myself, it was a total, horrible thing that happened to our country.
[02:34:17.130 --> 02:34:18.530]  It hurt us in so many ways.
[02:34:18.530 --> 02:34:29.073]  Despite that, we're setting records with the economy, with jobs, with the most people employed today that we've ever had in the history of our country.
[02:34:29.073 --> 02:34:34.275]  We have the best unemployment numbers that we've had in the history of our country.
[02:34:34.275 --> 02:34:37.856]  In some cases, 51 years, but generally in the history of our country.
[02:34:39.358 --> 02:34:41.719]  Companies are moving back in.
[02:34:41.719 --> 02:34:42.820]  Things are going well.
[02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:44.921]  And I said, let's have the meeting on infrastructure.
[02:34:44.921 --> 02:34:46.161]  We'll get that done easily.
[02:34:46.161 --> 02:34:48.602]  That's one of the easy ones.
[02:34:48.602 --> 02:34:59.527]  And instead of walking in happily into a meeting, I walk in to look at people that I just said that I was doing a cover-up.
[02:34:59.527 --> 02:35:01.128]  I don't do cover-ups.
[02:35:01.128 --> 02:35:03.229]  You people know that probably better than anybody.
[02:35:05.953 --> 02:35:07.594]  Millie Weaver's riding a shotgun with us.
[02:35:07.594 --> 02:35:09.035]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:35:09.035 --> 02:35:11.316]  We have Matt Brackett coming up in the fourth hour of the war.
[02:35:11.316 --> 02:35:13.438]  We'll go in short after that.
[02:35:13.438 --> 02:35:15.639]  Millie, so much breaking, so much unfolding.
[02:35:15.639 --> 02:35:16.840]  You've been out on the campaign trail.
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:19.662]  You've been out following Democrats and Republicans.
[02:35:19.662 --> 02:35:22.864]  You don't edit these videos other than cutting the spaces out.
[02:35:22.864 --> 02:35:27.467]  What, I'd say 95% of Democrats act like demon-possessed goblin creatures.
[02:35:28.283 --> 02:35:43.635]  Oh yeah, I mean, they can't answer questions and that's why you have so many of them going and trying to tell other people, oh don't talk to them, don't talk to InfoWars, because as soon as you question them, all of everything falls through because they can't logically defend their point.
[02:35:43.635 --> 02:35:49.320]  And they always say, you're not supposed to be here, whether you're at the Capitol in Texas or wherever, you need to shut up.
[02:35:49.320 --> 02:35:51.241]  Like, get out of here!
[02:35:51.241 --> 02:35:52.362]  Get the hell out of here!
[02:35:52.362 --> 02:35:53.303]  You're not supposed to be here.
[02:35:54.503 --> 02:35:56.704]  Yeah, they tell us that we need to shut up.
[02:35:56.704 --> 02:35:58.044]  They think everything's a university.
[02:35:58.044 --> 02:35:59.064]  They always go, police!
[02:35:59.064 --> 02:36:00.385]  Arrest her!
[02:36:00.385 --> 02:36:02.665]  Oh yeah, they'll say, arrest her, get her out of here.
[02:36:02.665 --> 02:36:04.026]  I want them shut up.
[02:36:04.026 --> 02:36:05.426]  I want them silenced.
[02:36:05.426 --> 02:36:06.847]  I want them muted.
[02:36:06.847 --> 02:36:07.487]  Exactly.
[02:36:07.487 --> 02:36:13.128]  And they had big signs that told men to shut the F up at their protests.
[02:36:13.128 --> 02:36:14.149]  In Austin.
[02:36:14.149 --> 02:36:14.769]  In Austin, yeah.
[02:36:14.769 --> 02:36:15.349]  Two days ago.
[02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:17.830]  Yes, they were telling men they shouldn't have a say.
[02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:22.011]  But then when you ask them, well, doesn't it require a man to make a baby?
[02:36:23.075 --> 02:36:27.799]  So shouldn't they have a say, given that it takes two to reproduce?
[02:36:27.799 --> 02:36:31.502]  I don't even get this thing where like, men and women are even at odds with each other.
[02:36:31.502 --> 02:36:33.743]  It's crazy how they've gotten to this point.
[02:36:33.743 --> 02:36:39.728]  Of course, Millie, most of these women that are all obsessed with, you know, they say, I'm a slut.
[02:36:39.728 --> 02:36:41.670]  Let's face it, no man's ever wanted them.
[02:36:42.934 --> 02:36:46.255]  Studies are out like conservative women are better looking, more successful, more happy.
[02:36:46.255 --> 02:36:47.475]  You know what's kind of interesting?
[02:36:47.475 --> 02:36:53.917]  Most of the women that were out there were like a bunch of old cat ladies that look like they've already been through menopause.
[02:36:53.917 --> 02:36:57.698]  So it's kind of like, you probably can't even get pregnant, so... No, no, exactly.
[02:36:57.698 --> 02:36:59.018]  That's the point.
[02:36:59.018 --> 02:37:02.299]  Is they're miserable, they never had a man, and they're pissed.
[02:37:03.280 --> 02:37:17.445]  Yeah, I mean, they think that men are trying to somehow hold them down and that being a woman and being a mother and embracing maternity is somehow weak for women to do that when it's actually one of the hardest things you can do.
[02:37:17.445 --> 02:37:21.506]  It's very hard to be a mom and do it like a boss.
[02:37:21.506 --> 02:37:24.047]  And those women that do it should be celebrated.
[02:37:24.047 --> 02:37:32.350]  And these women just want to essentially deny the fact that the babies living within their wombs have rights.
[02:37:32.910 --> 02:37:35.551]  And that they are human beings.
[02:37:35.551 --> 02:37:45.756]  These are human beings, and now all the textbooks are, they're a cancer, they're a blob, and all these leftist shows like talk crap about the baby, and then now they're like, oh, let's kill babies after they're born.
[02:37:45.756 --> 02:37:49.918]  You know, a woman tried to compare babies in the womb to a microbe.
[02:37:50.765 --> 02:37:53.748]  They tried to compare... They call it a parasite.
[02:37:53.748 --> 02:37:55.370]  They call it an invading force.
[02:37:55.370 --> 02:37:56.671]  Yeah, they do anything they can.
[02:37:56.671 --> 02:38:00.315]  No, your whole body's built with ovaries that it releases.
[02:38:00.315 --> 02:38:04.599]  It's like saying a flower with another flower making seeds is a cancer.
[02:38:04.599 --> 02:38:05.400]  No.
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:07.002]  You were designed for it.
[02:38:07.002 --> 02:38:07.903]  You have it.
[02:38:07.903 --> 02:38:10.806]  These two things combined make a new creature that grows in you.
[02:38:10.806 --> 02:38:11.626]  That's magic.
[02:38:11.626 --> 02:38:12.607]  That's beautiful.
[02:38:12.607 --> 02:38:13.909]  But they turn into something ugly.
[02:38:14.249 --> 02:38:22.654]  You know, when I asked them, should women be allowed to abort unborn babies in the womb, they say, what business is it of yours?
[02:38:22.654 --> 02:38:32.300]  And I said to them, I said, that's probably what the German people said when the Jewish people were being exterminated and killed in the concentration camps.
[02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:34.901]  What business is it of yours, America?
[02:38:34.901 --> 02:38:40.785]  What business is it of yours, other countries that don't like to see millions of people slaughtered?
[02:38:40.785 --> 02:38:41.866]  See, that's the thing, Millie.
[02:38:42.566 --> 02:38:46.928]  The average leftist doesn't believe their leftist bleeding heart crap.
[02:38:46.928 --> 02:39:00.255]  They're sociopaths at best, psychopaths at worst, who know we have a conscience, so they're constantly punching our conscience buttons to get us to give them money and power.
[02:39:00.255 --> 02:39:01.196]  That's all they want.
[02:39:01.196 --> 02:39:09.340]  I was watching last night, I woke up at 2.30 in the morning, couldn't sleep, and for some reason my newsfeed on my iPad was
[02:39:10.891 --> 02:39:19.901]  Evergreen College in Washington State in Olympia and how people signing up to go to the college is down by 50 plus percent.
[02:39:19.901 --> 02:39:23.865]  They've gone from 5,000 students down to 2,000 students and they're imploding.
[02:39:23.865 --> 02:39:27.989]  So I watched for several hours before I went back to bed at like 4.
[02:39:27.989 --> 02:39:30.992]  The actual videos of the professors
[02:39:32.068 --> 02:39:39.373]  The black professors saying, and I feel sorry most black folks aren't like this, literally, whites are inherently evil.
[02:39:39.373 --> 02:39:41.294]  You are scum.
[02:39:41.294 --> 02:39:43.736]  Nothing but evil can come because you're white.
[02:39:43.736 --> 02:39:45.317]  I want power.
[02:39:45.317 --> 02:39:46.318]  I rule you.
[02:39:46.318 --> 02:39:47.919]  And the woman starts literally going,
[02:39:48.419 --> 02:39:49.320]  Power!
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:50.421]  Power!
[02:39:50.421 --> 02:39:52.062]  I am power!
[02:39:52.062 --> 02:39:52.903]  I am power!
[02:39:52.903 --> 02:39:53.563]  I am power!
[02:39:53.563 --> 02:39:53.984]  Power!
[02:39:53.984 --> 02:39:54.384]  Power!
[02:39:54.384 --> 02:39:54.785]  Power!
[02:39:54.785 --> 02:39:55.485]  Power!
[02:39:55.485 --> 02:40:01.430]  And I was like watching hours of this and the white professors are actually bowing going, yes, yes, yes.
[02:40:01.430 --> 02:40:02.511]  He goes, get out of my way!
[02:40:02.511 --> 02:40:04.112]  And it's like...
[02:40:04.873 --> 02:40:05.974]  And like, whites are evil!
[02:40:05.974 --> 02:40:07.635]  Get out of my, like, yes, lordship!
[02:40:07.635 --> 02:40:13.060]  They fall down, and anyone that didn't do it was, like, fired, and... I mean, this is cuckoo land, man!
[02:40:13.060 --> 02:40:14.782]  This was Hitlerian!
[02:40:14.782 --> 02:40:16.583]  Of course blacks can act like Hitler!
[02:40:16.583 --> 02:40:24.670]  Anybody can, if they take on that mindset, and... She was doing it, this professor that led the whole thing, they call her the Red Queen.
[02:40:24.670 --> 02:40:26.672]  Some of the alumni have done videos on her.
[02:40:26.992 --> 02:40:27.612]  Exactly.
[02:40:27.612 --> 02:40:33.154]  The problem is, Alex, they're doing exactly what the Nazis did with the Jewish people to white people today.
[02:40:33.154 --> 02:40:40.297]  They're trying to make white people the scapegoat for all of the problems in the ethnic communities.
[02:40:40.297 --> 02:40:49.160]  All the problems that black people, Mexican people face in America, well, now white people are the new scapegoats, and that sets white people... Exactly!
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:50.380]  I saw a headline on Drudge.
[02:40:52.062 --> 02:41:01.409]  Today that people think they're getting, what was it, lower grades or, it was the craziest, I forget all the headlines, it's like they blame climate change for everything!
[02:41:01.409 --> 02:41:04.210]  They were blaming white people now for climate change.
[02:41:04.210 --> 02:41:13.517]  They have leftist studies coming out saying that white people, white colonialization, whiteness is causing climate change now.
[02:41:13.517 --> 02:41:19.001]  Let's go further than that though, because there's a few articles out today that are actually accurate from what I'm seeing.
[02:41:19.001 --> 02:41:20.222]  The average white kid
[02:41:21.345 --> 02:41:23.286]  Parents are guilty about being white.
[02:41:23.286 --> 02:41:25.627]  All they've done is nice to people their whole life.
[02:41:25.627 --> 02:41:31.211]  They're doing Hall-Hitler's and, you know, swastika signs and stuff as a joke.
[02:41:31.211 --> 02:41:34.813]  Because when you've done nothing wrong, and you're being told you're an evil piece of crap...
[02:41:35.896 --> 02:41:39.039]  Well, because, you know, the whole Martin Luther King Christian thing worked.
[02:41:39.039 --> 02:41:41.001]  Generations of people were actually like, let's come together.
[02:41:41.001 --> 02:41:42.242]  That's what we really want.
[02:41:42.242 --> 02:41:46.006]  That had gone back to the original Martin Luther, not Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:41:46.006 --> 02:41:51.471]  And so the system's crapping all over that, but then the evil shadow of this is,
[02:41:52.632 --> 02:42:04.184]  When you tell whites they're inherently evil, in class, everywhere, a lot of white folks who have never done anything in their lives, they're going to say, I'm not buying into this, especially when they've got brainwashed minorities telling them they're inherently bad.
[02:42:04.184 --> 02:42:07.468]  They're going to say, F you, and then they're going to get into the racism.
[02:42:07.788 --> 02:42:14.294]  Yeah, and I would say that trolling, though, and doing those sig hails and whatnot out of frustration is definitely not a good idea.
[02:42:14.294 --> 02:42:15.115]  Oh, they're definitely trolling!
[02:42:15.115 --> 02:42:15.855]  They're definitely trolling!
[02:42:15.855 --> 02:42:31.789]  It's not a good idea to do it, though, because the problem is, is that the left's brainwashing and propaganda is so strong, it just creates more ambiance for these brainwashed leftists that we need to wake up and... No, no, I agree, but then what do you do when they're telling everybody inherently whites are bad?
[02:42:31.789 --> 02:42:33.250]  People put up, it's okay to be white signs.
[02:42:34.231 --> 02:42:36.513]  And the media freaks out even more.
[02:42:36.513 --> 02:42:37.954]  And then they now say, that's racist.
[02:42:37.954 --> 02:42:41.356]  No, it's racist to say white people are bad.
[02:42:41.356 --> 02:42:46.901]  And by the way, if whites are so bad, I'm going to say it again, why is everybody trying to get into a white country?
[02:42:46.901 --> 02:42:48.882]  Because they're Christian, folks.
[02:42:48.882 --> 02:42:49.983]  They're Christian.
[02:42:49.983 --> 02:42:51.724]  It's Christianity.
[02:42:51.724 --> 02:42:53.986]  They've got studies in Africa, one tribe versus the next.
[02:42:55.362 --> 02:42:58.387]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[02:42:58.387 --> 02:43:00.972]  That what God gave us through Mother Nature is incredible.
[02:43:00.972 --> 02:43:03.756]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[02:43:03.756 --> 02:43:05.760]  And the globalists are so upset.
[02:43:05.760 --> 02:43:08.584]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[02:43:09.810 --> 02:43:14.895]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[02:43:14.895 --> 02:43:15.856]  So we looked at that.
[02:43:15.856 --> 02:43:17.477]  We made the very best a.m.
[02:43:17.477 --> 02:43:17.917]  and p.m.

[02:44:56.377 --> 02:45:00.539]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators.
[02:45:00.539 --> 02:45:01.619]  They are technocrats.
[02:45:01.619 --> 02:45:03.901]  They are control freaks in their own words.
[02:45:03.901 --> 02:45:11.384]  And they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets in the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[02:45:11.384 --> 02:45:13.145]  We're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:45:13.145 --> 02:45:15.226]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[02:45:15.746 --> 02:45:22.091]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[02:45:22.091 --> 02:45:27.275]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4warslife.com, I couldn't do it.

[02:45:55.106 --> 02:46:02.408]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and
[02:46:03.068 --> 02:46:08.330]  Known positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[02:46:08.330 --> 02:46:14.113]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated with.
[02:46:14.113 --> 02:46:16.714]  And that it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[02:46:16.714 --> 02:46:21.716]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if they were sick.
[02:46:21.716 --> 02:46:27.679]  But then you add, not to the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally,
[02:46:28.419 --> 02:46:39.424]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[02:46:39.424 --> 02:46:41.885]  Our Ultimate Bone Broth Formula is amazing.
[02:46:41.885 --> 02:46:46.748]  It's 50% off right now at InforMoreStore.com because I want you to try it and see how great it is.
[02:46:46.748 --> 02:46:49.609]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[02:46:49.609 --> 02:46:55.752]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taking on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[02:46:59.238 --> 02:47:09.963]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:09.963 --> 02:47:20.168]  All across Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada, anyone posting it's okay to be white, the sign is called a racist.
[02:47:20.168 --> 02:47:23.409]  Even when you post, it's okay to be black next to it.
[02:47:23.409 --> 02:47:24.490]  This is the brainwashing.
[02:47:25.836 --> 02:47:29.960]  But I personally, if you're a TV viewer, can see this racist piece of paper I have.
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:31.661]  It's white itself.
[02:47:31.661 --> 02:47:34.504]  It's not okay to be a white piece of paper.
[02:47:34.504 --> 02:47:37.106]  In fact, ladies and gentlemen, it's invisible ink.
[02:47:37.106 --> 02:47:42.431]  So if I'm offended by this, it should be banned, like the OK symbol.
[02:47:42.431 --> 02:47:45.473]  That's the new system of human discovery.
[02:47:45.473 --> 02:47:46.735]  Discovery, what offends you?
[02:47:48.306 --> 02:47:50.087]  And having it banned.
[02:47:50.087 --> 02:48:00.253]  Here's a compilation of local newscasts flipping out and saying that they aren't offended by it's okay to be white because the colleges are teaching white people are bad.
[02:48:00.253 --> 02:48:00.934]  Here it is.
[02:48:02.176 --> 02:48:05.918]  Thousands of flyers like this one are popping up on the University of Idaho's campus.
[02:48:05.918 --> 02:48:13.822]  The school's president, Chuck Staben, says the slogan, it's okay to be white, is associated with white supremacists and neo-Nazi groups.
[02:48:13.822 --> 02:48:18.405]  A Florida Gulf Coast University student admitted to hanging these flyers on campus.
[02:48:18.405 --> 02:48:20.546]  They say, it's okay to be white.
[02:48:20.546 --> 02:48:27.390]  19-year-old Griffin Baker-Royo said he put up the signs to protest a new class on campus called white racism.
[02:48:28.110 --> 02:48:33.493]  Well, Griffin Baker-Royo is still awaiting tonight to hear if he'll be punished or not by the university.
[02:48:33.493 --> 02:48:34.053]  Back it up.
[02:48:34.053 --> 02:48:36.434]  Ten seconds.
[02:48:36.434 --> 02:48:45.478]  The classes about white racism, when all humans can be tribal, and if we're going to try to work together with an ethos of a belief system, what is that belief system?
[02:48:45.478 --> 02:48:50.381]  Well, the left's new belief system is whites are evil, America sucks.
[02:48:50.381 --> 02:48:57.024]  And even Juncker, the dictator of the EU, says countries suck, Europeans suck, you're all stupid.
[02:48:57.737 --> 02:49:00.841]  Oh yeah, I mean they seriously want to demonize white people.
[02:49:00.841 --> 02:49:01.522]  It's ridiculous.
[02:49:01.522 --> 02:49:04.866]  The whole race debate is ridiculous in this country.
[02:49:04.866 --> 02:49:07.008]  Because who's even really white?
[02:49:07.008 --> 02:49:09.611]  Like, my skin color is beige, you know?
[02:49:09.611 --> 02:49:11.093]  It's all a big joke.
[02:49:11.093 --> 02:49:13.095]  It's mental illness.
[02:49:13.095 --> 02:49:14.057]  Martin Luther King Jr.
[02:49:14.057 --> 02:49:15.679]  is turning in his grave.
[02:49:15.679 --> 02:49:16.620]  Here's more of the newscast.
[02:49:17.847 --> 02:49:27.070]  Well, Griffin Baker-Royo is still awaiting tonight to hear if he'll be punished or not by the university for putting up those posters that read, it's okay to be white.
[02:49:27.070 --> 02:49:32.732]  He hasn't been criminally charged, but we do know that he's been referred to student affairs here at the university.
[02:49:32.732 --> 02:49:36.493]  Baker-Royo says his posters were not meant to be racist.
[02:49:36.493 --> 02:49:36.933]  Back it up again.
[02:49:37.998 --> 02:49:44.933]  They always use European laws when they arrest you for this stuff to act like you'll be arrested here, normalizing that we'll be arrested.
[02:49:44.933 --> 02:49:48.341]  They're getting us ready by just hearing it in the court of public opinion, Milley.
[02:49:49.215 --> 02:49:59.382]  Yeah, you know, they just want to normalize going after white people in general in this country and, you know, it's ridiculous that someone can't say that and somehow that's hate speech?
[02:49:59.382 --> 02:50:04.825]  Do you see how slippery the slope is with trying to demonize hate speech when you can't just say it's okay to be white?
[02:50:04.825 --> 02:50:10.909]  Which, the funny thing about this whole white paper thing, the whole joke is that the paper is white.
[02:50:10.909 --> 02:50:15.893]  So it's like a paper that just says it's okay to be white and they're talking about the paper!
[02:50:15.893 --> 02:50:17.013]  Sure, it's all semantical, but...
[02:50:18.573 --> 02:50:19.574]  No expanding on this.
[02:50:19.574 --> 02:50:26.261]  This is a divide-and-conquer stratagem where they put pressure on a group to then make them politically follow the orders they want.
[02:50:26.261 --> 02:50:27.842]  That's terrorism.
[02:50:27.842 --> 02:50:34.308]  This black professor I was watching that led the whole Evergreen College thing that's killed their tuition by over, you know, half percent.
[02:50:34.308 --> 02:50:36.290]  They already have collapsed, basically.
[02:50:36.290 --> 02:50:36.651]  It's over.
[02:50:37.071 --> 02:50:40.355]  And the left's doubling down more as they circle the toilet bowl.
[02:50:40.355 --> 02:50:41.976]  She said, I don't have any power.
[02:50:41.976 --> 02:50:42.817]  I'm black.
[02:50:42.817 --> 02:50:44.079]  She's a professor.
[02:50:44.079 --> 02:50:45.720]  She's ruined a university.
[02:50:45.720 --> 02:50:46.741]  She's wrecking things.
[02:50:46.741 --> 02:50:48.263]  She's causing a race war.
[02:50:48.263 --> 02:50:50.005]  But she keeps saying, yes, I'm prejudiced.
[02:50:50.005 --> 02:50:52.227]  She says, I'm a racist on video.
[02:50:52.227 --> 02:50:53.729]  I don't like whites.
[02:50:53.729 --> 02:50:55.511]  But it's OK because I'm downtrodden.
[02:50:56.581 --> 02:51:00.566]  Now if she tried to go to Africa and do that, she'd be gone.
[02:51:00.566 --> 02:51:02.728]  She went anywhere else, they'd laugh at her.
[02:51:02.728 --> 02:51:10.718]  She comes here, does this, hates everybody, and then says she doesn't have power so she can be as mean as she wants.
[02:51:10.718 --> 02:51:12.900]  It's a license to act like a thug.
[02:51:12.900 --> 02:51:13.241]  Here it is.
[02:51:14.462 --> 02:51:23.669]  Many at FGCU say they were offended by his act, especially Dr. Ted Thornhill, who teaches the white racism class.
[02:51:23.669 --> 02:51:41.682]  Especially the race pimp professor that runs the brainwashing system for the militant enthusiasm and for the whole social Darwinistic divide-and-conquer strategy of liberation theology.
[02:51:41.682 --> 02:51:42.103]  Continue.
[02:51:43.430 --> 02:51:49.934]  This door, I think, is cowardly and unwanted.
[02:51:49.934 --> 02:51:55.737]  It's a slogan that has been used by people like David Duke, you know, a former wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.
[02:51:55.737 --> 02:51:57.938]  She got this lady not even born here from other countries.
[02:51:57.938 --> 02:51:59.979]  She wanted to get here so she could bitch.
[02:51:59.979 --> 02:52:01.560]  Back it up 20 seconds, please.
[02:52:01.560 --> 02:52:04.882]  So she could get, like, David Duke uses the term, it's okay to be white.
[02:52:05.834 --> 02:52:09.538]  Never even heard that, but if David Duke eats Chinese food, is it banned too?
[02:52:09.538 --> 02:52:17.505]  Like, Sweden's banning runes, the original Germanic language, an alphabet, because somebody might use it wrong.
[02:52:17.505 --> 02:52:28.496]  This is a war on language, by a bunch of chip-on-their-shoulder, third-world populations, brought in, set up by the Ford Foundation, to piss in everyone's face.
[02:52:28.496 --> 02:52:29.037]  Let's continue.
[02:52:30.106 --> 02:52:38.612]  Baker Royo is still awaiting tonight to hear if he'll be punished or not by the university for putting up those posters that read, it's okay to be white.
[02:52:38.612 --> 02:52:44.275]  He hasn't been criminally charged, but we do know that he's been referred to student affairs here at the university.
[02:52:44.275 --> 02:52:55.603]  Baker Royo says his posters were not meant to be racist, but many at FGCU say they were offended by his act, especially Dr. Ted Thornhill, who teaches the white racism class.
[02:52:55.603 --> 02:52:58.465]  He found one of the signs on his office door.
[02:52:58.465 --> 02:52:59.506]  I think it's cowardly.
[02:53:03.928 --> 02:53:09.552]  It's a slogan that has been used by people like David Duke, you know, a former wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, and he often used it.
[02:53:09.552 --> 02:53:10.832]  You could Google this.
[02:53:10.832 --> 02:53:14.334]  It takes less than five minutes to find out.
[02:53:14.334 --> 02:53:25.521]  You know, what I think people are protesting is the idea that adopting the messaging and the framing of people like this should never occur in our federal parliament.
[02:53:25.521 --> 02:53:28.943]  So the idea that somehow white people are experiencing
[02:53:30.023 --> 02:53:40.128]  A level of racism that deserves to be condemned and recognized at the National Parliament diminishes the real experiences of other people that experience day-to-day racism.
[02:53:40.128 --> 02:53:53.874]  And then, you know, because Lauren Southern comes to Australia wearing a it's okay to be white shirt and people protested, 29 senators goes and vote on a notion that it's okay to be white?
[02:53:53.874 --> 02:53:54.734]  It's ridiculous!
[02:53:55.114 --> 02:53:56.055]  It's ridiculous!
[02:53:56.055 --> 02:53:58.196]  Holding signs on this vehicle... Oh, that's enough.
[02:53:58.196 --> 02:53:59.137]  We're done with the report.
[02:53:59.137 --> 02:54:12.046]  But, I mean, you've got this, obviously in my view, a racist woman, chip on her shoulder, wanted to get to the West as soon as she can, to then come to civilization and say, oh my God, I hate you, bow down to me, I'm conquering you.
[02:54:12.046 --> 02:54:17.330]  Which is why a lot of areas of the world can't get civilization, because everyone's trying to conquer the next person.
[02:54:17.910 --> 02:54:25.178]  And so she's here, I rule you, I conquer you, you suck, don't say you're alright, you're bad, I'm the victim, I'm the God.
[02:54:25.178 --> 02:54:33.667]  Well then why don't you get the hell out of our country like the Somali congresswoman that runs around saying America sucks all day?
[02:54:33.667 --> 02:54:35.849]  Why'd she marry her brother to come here?
[02:54:35.849 --> 02:54:39.193]  No, we're nice, so they use it against us and I'm done!
[02:54:40.029 --> 02:54:45.614]  You know, they're just trying to make it so that white people don't feel like they can defend themselves.
[02:54:45.614 --> 02:54:51.080]  Like, it's wrong to say it's okay to be white, but yet you can say it's okay to be black, it's okay to be Mexican, which it is!
[02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:52.101]  It's okay to be any color.
[02:54:52.101 --> 02:54:55.223]  Exactly, because they run up and down the hallways preaching racism.
[02:54:55.223 --> 02:54:56.224]  They're the racists.
[02:54:56.224 --> 02:54:57.406]  The left is the one.
[02:54:57.406 --> 02:55:01.810]  They want to say we suck, and we say no, and they're getting upset.
[02:55:01.810 --> 02:55:02.611]  Well, guess what?
[02:55:02.611 --> 02:55:03.732]  We're going to keep doing it!
[02:55:04.744 --> 02:55:09.428]  And you know it's interesting, I've never seen so much racial unity as I have recently.
[02:55:09.428 --> 02:55:12.310]  Oh, when Trump got elected it boosted the numbers way up.
[02:55:12.310 --> 02:55:13.672]  He's incredibly popular.
[02:55:13.672 --> 02:55:15.873]  The average black American just wants freedom.
[02:55:15.873 --> 02:55:17.235]  Who the hell wants all this?
[02:55:17.235 --> 02:55:24.741]  Who wants to send their kids to college and half the teaching isn't about math or accounting or history or science.
[02:55:24.741 --> 02:55:26.362]  It's all about race war.
[02:55:26.362 --> 02:55:28.224]  How does that help your young person?
[02:55:28.464 --> 02:55:33.747]  Texas actually displayed so much racial unity, Alex, at that MAGA beach bash.
[02:55:33.747 --> 02:55:34.888]  It was insane!
[02:55:34.888 --> 02:55:42.612]  You had Hispanics, blacks, whites all together celebrating Trump and America and they all loved each other and had so much unity.
[02:55:42.612 --> 02:55:45.674]  But that's what scares the left because that's all they've got.
[02:55:45.674 --> 02:55:49.756]  They can't promote prosperity or free market or self-defense.
[02:55:49.756 --> 02:55:51.717]  All they can promote is racial division.
[02:55:52.097 --> 02:55:58.662]  Exactly, and that's why we, the American people, need to be united as ever and show that we love each other.
[02:55:58.662 --> 02:56:00.503]  Who cares about your skin color?
[02:56:00.503 --> 02:56:03.706]  And I agree, but we have to stand up against the race peddling left.
[02:56:03.706 --> 02:56:04.006]  Exactly.
[02:56:04.006 --> 02:56:06.888]  New story up on Infowars.com by Kellan McBreen.
[02:56:06.888 --> 02:56:07.589]  Breaking!
[02:56:07.589 --> 02:56:12.112]  Sealed court docs in aborted Schmollett case to be made public.
[02:56:12.112 --> 02:56:17.496]  Schmollett staged that, but again, the media said he was good to stage it so he doesn't get in trouble.
[02:56:19.301 --> 02:56:30.465]  Yeah, what was interesting is actually at the MAGA Beach Bash, I interviewed a bunch of African Americans that were out there partying alongside these MAGA hat-wearing Trump supporters, and guess what all of them said, Alex?
[02:56:30.465 --> 02:56:33.807]  All of them said, no, I've had nothing but love and unity.
[02:56:33.807 --> 02:56:36.888]  People have been smiling at us, waving at us, loving us.
[02:56:37.228 --> 02:56:39.390]  We haven't had any racial instances.
[02:56:39.390 --> 02:56:52.178]  So how can you have all these drunk, inebriated, MAGA people out there amongst all of these black Americans and not one of these black Americans that I talked to said they had any hate coming from the Trump- But that's because you're in Texas.
[02:56:52.178 --> 02:56:56.021]  If you go to Baltimore or Chicago, the brainwashing is deep.
[02:56:56.021 --> 02:56:58.983]  And folks have never been around white people in those areas.
[02:56:58.983 --> 02:57:02.405]  They actually believe white people are all actually running around in KKK outfits.
[02:57:03.055 --> 02:57:09.761]  I mean, the people out here in Texas, the MAGA hat-wearing Trump supporters, were loving the black people out there.
[02:57:09.761 --> 02:57:13.424]  I know, but the statistics show that racism is way down.
[02:57:13.424 --> 02:57:15.966]  That's why the Democrats are panicking.
[02:57:15.966 --> 02:57:17.267]  Exactly.
[02:57:17.267 --> 02:57:22.311]  If you want to see it for yourself, go to any Trump event and you see unity.
[02:57:22.311 --> 02:57:23.652]  I know the audience understands that.
[02:57:23.652 --> 02:57:24.673]  We'll do five more minutes.
[02:57:26.175 --> 02:57:28.137]  The Matt Braggins taking over?
[02:57:28.137 --> 02:57:33.261]  Watch the truth about racist Trump supporters, Billy Weaver, now up on InfoWars.com.
[02:57:33.261 --> 02:57:36.404]  And don't forget, Memorial Day specials are rolling right now.
[02:57:36.404 --> 02:57:43.571]  60% off on the ultimate turmeric formula, bodies, 95% cuminoid, and a bunch of other specials.
[02:57:45.140 --> 02:57:48.743]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:57:48.743 --> 02:57:50.525]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[02:57:50.525 --> 02:58:01.794]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.555 --> 02:58:11.757]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:58:11.757 --> 02:58:17.499]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[02:58:17.499 --> 02:58:22.800]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:58:22.800 --> 02:58:25.420]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:58:25.420 --> 02:58:27.141]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:27.141 --> 02:58:31.942]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[02:58:32.162 --> 02:58:37.126]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.126 --> 02:58:39.768]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:58:39.768 --> 02:58:44.492]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.

[02:59:49.209 --> 02:59:51.813]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:03.948 --> 03:00:05.129]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:00:05.129 --> 03:00:06.410]  Billy, we were riding shotgun with us.
[03:00:06.410 --> 03:00:07.852]  Matt Bracken about to take over.
[03:00:07.852 --> 03:00:10.635]  Billy, during the break, you're like, wow, we're kind of arguing.
[03:00:10.635 --> 03:00:11.495]  I am not arguing with you.
[03:00:11.495 --> 03:00:13.117]  I agree with you.
[03:00:13.117 --> 03:00:18.462]  I'm just saying the Democrats know people aren't racist.
[03:00:18.462 --> 03:00:23.527]  They know that because we aren't our weaknesses, they can tell us do what we say or we'll call you racist.
[03:00:23.527 --> 03:00:24.608]  It's a form of terrorism.
[03:00:25.749 --> 03:00:32.392]  And they have wound up a lot of minorities to act like classical racists now, and I just think getting right back in people's faces is the way to go now.
[03:00:32.392 --> 03:00:33.833]  You're actually exactly right.
[03:00:33.833 --> 03:00:44.178]  When you said that about how they know that people aren't racist, it's the same way they know that that baby in the womb is a human, yet they try to deny it.
[03:00:44.178 --> 03:00:47.360]  They use all these roundabout ways to try to deny it.
[03:00:49.001 --> 03:01:04.891]  What it really is, Alex, is I'm getting sick and tired of liberals with their arguments trying to push absolute untruths and illogical conclusions and think that we're just going to have to believe them because they resort to emotional appeals to try to make everyone feel uncomfortable.
[03:01:04.891 --> 03:01:06.052]  That's what they try to do.
[03:01:06.052 --> 03:01:15.138]  Resort to emotional appeals so that people feel uncomfortable, they can shut down dialogue, and then we can't reach the factual, logical conclusion that they're wrong.
[03:01:15.899 --> 03:01:19.582]  Well it's like them suing people if they question public events.
[03:01:19.582 --> 03:01:22.405]  They want us to, like you said, do what they say.
[03:01:22.405 --> 03:01:24.286]  They want us to buy into whatever they say.
[03:01:24.286 --> 03:01:28.910]  Well that cow left the barn a long time ago.
[03:01:28.910 --> 03:01:32.834]  You know what the best way to refute liberal arguments is?
[03:01:32.834 --> 03:01:38.639]  You just go out there and you put a microphone in front of their face and you let them speak and ask them
[03:01:39.119 --> 03:01:46.526]  To essentially tell you why they support what they support, and you will just get a bunch of jibber jabber, cussing, yelling.
[03:01:46.526 --> 03:01:50.969]  You've been interviewing people six, seven years, but intensely the last four.
[03:01:50.969 --> 03:01:52.971]  Obviously it's getting more extreme.
[03:01:52.971 --> 03:01:56.034]  How would you describe the tenor in the last few years?
[03:01:56.294 --> 03:02:06.278]  There's definitely an uptick in violence and hostility and it's not just InfoWars because I've seen other journalists out there, Breitbart, other media companies get the same vitriol.
[03:02:06.278 --> 03:02:14.862]  It's an uptick in violence from the left because they are realizing that all these beliefs that they've held and been brainwashed with that
[03:02:16.361 --> 03:02:19.743]  It's no longer going to be their reality, because people are waking up.
[03:02:19.743 --> 03:02:28.448]  People are getting red-pilled, and they're seeing the truth for what it is, and they're panicking because these are your lemmings that want to run off the side of a cliff.
[03:02:28.448 --> 03:02:31.930]  And they'll take humanity with them if we let them.
[03:02:31.930 --> 03:02:35.572]  And that's why, no more silence from conservatives.
[03:02:35.572 --> 03:02:41.715]  I ask you, I beg you, conservatives, please do something, because these lemmings want to take us off the side of the cliff with them.
[03:02:41.715 --> 03:02:42.896]  Because that's where they're headed.
[03:02:43.496 --> 03:02:45.097]  They want to destroy humanity.
[03:02:45.097 --> 03:02:49.040]  They want our little children, our little boys to be turned into drag queens.
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:51.582]  They want our babies aborted and killed.
[03:02:51.582 --> 03:02:54.103]  And they think nothing's wrong with that.
[03:02:54.103 --> 03:02:56.085]  This is where we're heading, Alex.
[03:02:56.085 --> 03:03:03.049]  Millie, I want to take what you just said live on air and run it as a promo piece, because I've never heard anybody say truer words.
[03:03:03.049 --> 03:03:05.211]  That's what this is.
[03:03:05.211 --> 03:03:12.056]  And it's a total attempt to take control of reality, to dominate and bully everyone into submission.
[03:03:12.976 --> 03:03:22.725]  And the leadership of this knows full well what they're doing, and they went to college, and they got two or three of these worthless degrees, and they were told, you'll be the ruling class.
[03:03:22.725 --> 03:03:25.328]  Hillary's going to be elected ten years ago, they told them.
[03:03:25.328 --> 03:03:31.374]  And when it didn't happen, they've invested in this pipe dream, and they're supposed to be the new ruling class.
[03:03:32.722 --> 03:03:46.157]  America doesn't really have that, and they are so incredibly upset, and now they're doing a ghost dance, thinking if they throw a giant fit, somehow we'll submit, and then they can finally take control of civilization.
[03:03:46.157 --> 03:03:49.541]  And part of it is that the liberals just don't want to admit that they're wrong.
[03:03:49.821 --> 03:03:51.702]  Some of them are just being so stubborn.
[03:03:51.702 --> 03:03:52.863]  They don't want to admit they're wrong.
[03:03:52.863 --> 03:03:55.565]  They don't want to admit that the Russia collusion thing was a hoax.
[03:03:55.565 --> 03:03:57.146]  Just like how we saw Nancy Pelosi.
[03:03:57.146 --> 03:04:01.349]  I mean, the Democrats are doubling down, trying to act like Trump's covering up.
[03:04:01.349 --> 03:04:02.570]  There's no evidence!
[03:04:02.570 --> 03:04:03.950]  There's no collusion!
[03:04:03.950 --> 03:04:07.413]  And even when I'm at these rallies... They still say, collusion!
[03:04:07.413 --> 03:04:08.373]  You're a Russian!
[03:04:08.373 --> 03:04:08.994]  Exactly.
[03:04:08.994 --> 03:04:12.596]  And they act ridiculous when you point out that they're illogical.
[03:04:12.596 --> 03:04:19.421]  And if you want to find those videos, you can find them on Millennial Millie, or you can find Caitlin's latest videos on Liberty Hangout, all on YouTube.
[03:04:20.001 --> 03:04:21.143]  They're incredible videos.
[03:04:21.143 --> 03:04:24.687]  We also post them at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:04:24.687 --> 03:04:26.890]  Millie, thank you for the great job you're doing.
[03:04:26.890 --> 03:04:27.771]  Glad you're here in town.
[03:04:27.771 --> 03:04:34.520]  Can't wait to see you and your crew back on the road and covering election 2020 that is already in full swing.
[03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:36.082]  Don't forget Memorial Day specials.
[03:04:36.702 --> 03:04:38.745]  Best deals ever in FullWarStore.com.
[03:04:38.745 --> 03:04:41.247]  Without you buying the products, we will be shut down.
[03:04:41.247 --> 03:04:42.409]  Thanks for your products.
[03:04:42.409 --> 03:04:44.110]  We are here fighting hard.
[03:04:44.110 --> 03:04:45.832]  So thank you so much.
[03:04:45.832 --> 03:04:50.657]  Matt Bracken's coming up straight ahead in the War Room in about 55 minutes with Odin Scrooge.
[03:04:54.485 --> 03:04:56.487]  They've not shut down our speech!
[03:04:56.487 --> 03:05:01.331]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants!
[03:05:01.331 --> 03:05:08.838]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air, it was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[03:05:08.838 --> 03:05:10.159]  Are you coming back?
[03:05:10.159 --> 03:05:11.300]  We're at InfoWars.com.
[03:05:11.920 --> 03:05:13.282]  We're at newswars.com.
[03:05:13.282 --> 03:05:15.505]  Paul Watson's launched his own summit.news.
[03:05:15.505 --> 03:05:16.446]  We have our own videos.
[03:05:16.446 --> 03:05:17.527]  We have our own articles.
[03:05:17.527 --> 03:05:22.294]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, InfoWars are still chugging along.
[03:05:22.294 --> 03:05:24.536]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[03:05:24.536 --> 03:05:26.118]  InfoWars!
[03:05:26.118 --> 03:05:27.821]  Don't tell me!
[03:05:27.821 --> 03:05:28.201]  Woo!
[03:05:35.481 --> 03:05:38.203]  I'm at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:05:38.203 --> 03:05:40.425]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[03:05:40.425 --> 03:05:43.928]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[03:05:43.928 --> 03:05:46.670]  Anybody can use it, re-upload it, do whatever you want.
[03:05:46.670 --> 03:05:48.931]  People go to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:05:48.931 --> 03:05:49.952]  That's where they find it.
[03:05:49.952 --> 03:05:51.913]  You know, there's things called websites.
[03:05:51.913 --> 03:05:52.334]  Just go there.
[03:06:07.026 --> 03:06:10.108]  Okay, you've got me for the next hour.
[03:06:10.108 --> 03:06:20.252]  I'm always thinking to myself as I come into the show, the best show prep for this hour is just listening to the last hour.
[03:06:32.230 --> 03:06:34.373]  Because I just want to keep listening.
[03:06:34.373 --> 03:06:41.762]  And I hope that I can maintain the high standard there that was with Alex's guests and Millie before me.
[03:06:41.762 --> 03:06:44.666]  I love what Alex said right there at the end.
[03:06:44.666 --> 03:06:47.149]  The Democrats are doing the ghost dance.
[03:06:47.962 --> 03:07:01.091]  That was when, around the 1890s, the last Sioux were hoping that they could, by magic, make the white man's soldier's bullets just pass through them like water, if they did the right ghost dance.
[03:07:01.091 --> 03:07:02.252]  It didn't work out too well.
[03:07:02.252 --> 03:07:16.341]  Now, I think what's happening, I've often used the poker game analogy, that Trump has been obviously waiting for the Mueller report, because he's got to show all of his cards before Trump starts laying down his cards.
[03:07:17.407 --> 03:07:27.112]  And the Rose Garden, the Rose Garden speech after the short Oval Office meeting or trap, I think that was brilliant.
[03:07:27.112 --> 03:07:32.455]  You have to go back to Trump over the last many decades as a business leader.
[03:07:32.455 --> 03:07:38.158]  And it's not just, you know, putting on the green eye shade and getting your accountants and adding up the numbers.
[03:07:38.158 --> 03:07:46.703]  There's a lot of psychological warfare involved in business dealings and also obviously now involved in political dealings.
[03:07:48.602 --> 03:08:04.795]  When Pelosi said that Trump is involved in a cover-up and she's having the impeachment meetings with her mainstream Democrat radicals, I think that made Trump reach his limit.
[03:08:04.795 --> 03:08:07.897]  And he had no plan at all for an infrastructure meeting.
[03:08:07.897 --> 03:08:08.878]  He let them walk in.
[03:08:09.685 --> 03:08:14.146]  He sandbagged them, he walked out to the Rose Garden, and he laid it on them.
[03:08:14.146 --> 03:08:30.110]  And he was very calm and collected, so when Nancy Pelosi says that he had a temper tantrum, and meanwhile she's drooling like somebody with dementia and can barely form words, it kind of puts the lie to her and does make her look like a ghost dancer.
[03:08:30.110 --> 03:08:31.350]  And I think that
[03:08:31.969 --> 03:08:44.396]  What Trump is doing, and if you look at this as a businessman, a politician, and as a reality TV host, he is applying jiu-jitsu to them.
[03:08:44.396 --> 03:08:49.959]  So in jiu-jitsu or in Aikido, you use the strength of your enemy against them.
[03:08:51.264 --> 03:09:02.091]  And you use their rigidity or their momentum, and you understand it better than they do, so that you can actually use their own force against them.
[03:09:02.091 --> 03:09:04.932]  And that's what Trump is doing now.
[03:09:04.932 --> 03:09:15.839]  Something that's been a big advantage of the Democrats, and we've often commented on it, whether they're right or wrong, whether they have a weak hand or a strong hand, they're very united.
[03:09:15.839 --> 03:09:17.980]  They have party discipline.
[03:09:17.980 --> 03:09:19.481]  They stick to the party line.
[03:09:20.114 --> 03:09:24.256]  And right now the party line is Trump is, you know, is a villain.
[03:09:24.256 --> 03:09:25.397]  He's out of control.
[03:09:25.397 --> 03:09:27.218]  He needs an intervention.
[03:09:27.218 --> 03:09:30.800]  And we have to go forward with impeachment.
[03:09:30.800 --> 03:09:33.361]  Meanwhile, his rallies are drawing monster crowds.
[03:09:33.361 --> 03:09:35.322]  The economy is doing great.
[03:09:35.322 --> 03:09:45.067]  So there's this huge cognitive dissonance building up between what Americans are hearing from Trump and from the Democrats and what they're seeing with their own eyes.
[03:09:45.902 --> 03:09:57.411]  And now Trump has trapped them into going further down this impeachment path, sort of like a losing card player, doubling down and doubling down.
[03:09:57.411 --> 03:10:02.595]  Eventually, they're not only going to lose their stake, they're going to lose their ranch.
[03:10:02.595 --> 03:10:14.464]  Because what they're oblivious to, or the reality that they prefer not to see, is that Trump's strongest cards are all about to be put on the table.
[03:10:15.157 --> 03:10:27.865]  And the Democrats have cut themselves off from any ability to retreat to a position of reality where they could say, oh, we knew all along there was no collusion, and they can't do that.
[03:10:27.865 --> 03:10:29.447]  They've burned all those bridges.
[03:10:29.447 --> 03:10:37.392]  Trump has lured them into burning all the bridges, and they're stuck now out on the impeachment path.
[03:10:37.392 --> 03:10:43.756]  Meanwhile, all of the real cards are about to be laid down, and there are some huge cards going to come.
[03:10:44.662 --> 03:10:49.704]  We've all been hearing for the past week about Papadopoulos and Joseph Mifsud.
[03:10:49.704 --> 03:10:54.045]  I'd like to know if Joseph Mifsud, if anybody's seen him alive lately.
[03:10:54.045 --> 03:11:04.189]  Because there are a lot of people, John Brennan, etc., that wish that Joseph Mifsud would be buried in the center of the earth somewhere, or the bottom of the ocean.
[03:11:04.189 --> 03:11:06.950]  Because if that guy ever comes before Congress,
[03:11:08.257 --> 03:11:11.979]  He's not going to go down the tubes like a G. Gordon Liddy.
[03:11:11.979 --> 03:11:15.301]  He's going to say, look, I'm an operative for the Five Eyes.
[03:11:15.301 --> 03:11:16.722]  I follow orders.
[03:11:16.722 --> 03:11:20.024]  I got my orders from MI6.
[03:11:20.024 --> 03:11:25.847]  They got their orders in cooperative agreements from head of CIA John Brennan.
[03:11:25.847 --> 03:11:27.388]  I just did what I was told.
[03:11:28.254 --> 03:11:36.537]  This would make the John Dean and the disclosures about the tapes in Watergate seem like nothing.
[03:11:36.537 --> 03:11:40.659]  And as far as the Democrat-controlled mainstream media...
[03:11:41.408 --> 03:11:42.849]  It's the same with them.
[03:11:42.849 --> 03:11:44.950]  They've also burned all their bridges.
[03:11:44.950 --> 03:11:54.994]  They can't now come back towards reality and say, oh, well, yeah, you know, we were just going with that Russia collusion story for the ratings, but we never really believed it.
[03:11:54.994 --> 03:11:56.615]  They're committed to it.
[03:11:56.615 --> 03:11:59.476]  They are completely, fully committed to it.
[03:11:59.476 --> 03:12:07.920]  Just the way that, in a small side analogy, they had Michael Avenatti on hundreds of times on MSNBC and CNN.
[03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:10.961]  They were calling him a strong presidential candidate.
[03:12:11.718 --> 03:12:22.391]  And now he's completely revealed as a charlatan, shyster lawyer, huckster, who even robbed his client, Stormy Daniels.
[03:12:22.391 --> 03:12:28.539]  And so this shows how the media just is trapped out on their own limb, sawing their own limb off.
[03:12:28.539 --> 03:12:30.161]  And Trump has been masterful.
[03:12:31.204 --> 03:12:36.628]  It's sort of, in this poker game, we've all been begging him to lay these cards down, to lay these cards down.
[03:12:36.628 --> 03:12:42.751]  But no, he's been holding his cards and watching the pot grow.
[03:12:42.751 --> 03:12:46.574]  Every time he makes a small bet, the other side goes all in and covers him.
[03:12:47.154 --> 03:12:57.042]  And the pot is growing, the pot is growing, and now all of the disclosures, the declassifications, they're going to come out one after another.
[03:12:57.042 --> 03:13:01.946]  They're going to be like .50 caliber bullets ripping through the Democrats and the media.
[03:13:01.946 --> 03:13:04.308]  There's going to be nowhere left for them.
[03:13:04.308 --> 03:13:12.715]  If the economy holds together and we don't go to war with China or Iran or some kind of a huge black swan event like that,
[03:13:13.453 --> 03:13:33.517]  Then it's going to be a huge victory in 2020, like a Reagan 49-state kind of a thing, because the Democrats are going to have totally discredited themselves as liars who are willing to take this country and tear it to pieces for pure political gain.
[03:13:34.204 --> 03:13:59.416]  When it's shown that the real Russian collusion was from Hillary Clinton and the DNC via her law firm Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele to the Russians, that that was the real Russian collusion story, when the average American who hasn't been paying that much attention, when he finally figures out, wait a minute, the Democrats were lying the whole time.
[03:14:00.268 --> 03:14:04.211]  It's going to completely blow up the Democrat Party.
[03:14:04.211 --> 03:14:29.188]  Some people even think that Trump didn't campaign hard for the congressman in the midterms because he actually saw this in advance and saw how having a Democrat Congress for these two years would allow him to play a huge jujitsu leverage move to sort of, you know, by having them slightly stronger for two years,
[03:14:30.157 --> 03:14:37.058]  To flip them to the mat, knock the wind out of them, pin them, and then have four years where he can do anything.
[03:14:37.058 --> 03:14:38.219]  It remains to be seen.
[03:14:38.219 --> 03:14:55.602]  Maybe I'm overly optimistic, but as the next few days and weeks come to pass, I expect, at least if you listen to the folks like Nunez and Jordan, these declassifications are going to be explosive.
[03:14:55.602 --> 03:14:57.983]  And it's going to leave the Democrats,
[03:14:58.633 --> 03:15:04.976]  And their Democrat mainstream media, with nowhere to hide, completely discredited.
[03:15:04.976 --> 03:15:07.077]  And we'll see what happens.
[03:15:07.077 --> 03:15:11.559]  Maybe, you know, I've had hope before, but nothing like this.
[03:15:11.559 --> 03:15:16.101]  I feel better right now than at any other point.
[03:15:16.101 --> 03:15:18.422]  And then around the world, we see other victories.
[03:15:18.422 --> 03:15:25.065]  Australia, huge victory against Labour, the Liberal Party there, the Conservatives.
[03:15:25.865 --> 03:15:28.446]  The vote in the UK today.
[03:15:28.446 --> 03:15:32.788]  Haven't seen how that's turning out, but the Brexit party should be doing great.
[03:15:32.788 --> 03:15:38.149]  Even in Germany, the tide seems to be turning, and I can talk about that when we come back from the break.
[03:15:38.149 --> 03:15:39.310]  All right, anyway.
[03:15:39.310 --> 03:15:40.790]  Get a control, Matt.
[03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:42.331]  Maybe you're too optimistic.
[03:15:42.331 --> 03:15:43.551]  We'll see.
[03:15:43.551 --> 03:15:45.232]  We'll be back after the break with more.
[03:15:53.038 --> 03:15:55.680]  Hunters, anglers, campers, and survivalists.
[03:15:55.680 --> 03:15:56.801]  Get back to nature.

[03:19:56.636 --> 03:20:12.489]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:12.489 --> 03:20:18.775]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:18.775 --> 03:20:22.638]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:20:28.590 --> 03:20:35.014]  Alright, now, uh, I've got some more to say, but we will be taking some phone calls, maybe the next segment.
[03:20:35.014 --> 03:20:43.739]  And that number is 877-789-2539, or 789-ALEX.
[03:20:43.739 --> 03:20:48.322]  And, uh, as the lines fill up, maybe the next segment will go to that.
[03:20:48.322 --> 03:20:55.827]  Now, I sounded pretty optimistic in the last segment, and certainly it's better to have a battlefield victory than a loss.
[03:20:56.607 --> 03:21:05.413]  But something that it's very important to remember is the progressives, the communists, the globalists, they're fully committed.
[03:21:05.413 --> 03:21:06.614]  This is their religion.
[03:21:06.614 --> 03:21:13.259]  They say they don't believe in God, but their God is global communism.
[03:21:13.259 --> 03:21:16.101]  But they look at it in several different ways.
[03:21:16.101 --> 03:21:20.825]  For the masses, communism is sold as their panacea.
[03:21:20.825 --> 03:21:23.927]  You know, everybody gets free stuff, free college,
[03:21:25.227 --> 03:21:26.608]  Free medical care.
[03:21:26.608 --> 03:21:29.490]  Free housing.
[03:21:29.490 --> 03:21:31.691]  Of course that's ridiculous.
[03:21:31.691 --> 03:21:39.376]  For the elites that rule the masses, communism is a way to become feudal overlords.
[03:21:39.376 --> 03:21:48.201]  They get to live in the castles, which today are gated communities or compounds like, you know, where Zuckerberg and these other titans live.
[03:21:48.201 --> 03:21:53.224]  They don't care if it's wreckage outside, as long as the dumb masses
[03:21:54.005 --> 03:22:00.970]  As long as the dumbasses vote for them on continuing promises of free stuff, then they get to rule.
[03:22:00.970 --> 03:22:09.917]  The people that get crushed are us, the middle class, the working class, the heritage Americans that built the country.
[03:22:09.917 --> 03:22:13.039]  And we're just in the squeeze-out play.
[03:22:13.039 --> 03:22:16.542]  This is why the Democrats are fully committed to open borders.
[03:22:16.542 --> 03:22:21.466]  This is why it's absolutely foolish to even discuss going to Congress
[03:22:22.629 --> 03:22:24.970]  And have any kind of reform.
[03:22:24.970 --> 03:22:32.772]  Not only would it be dragged out for months, all that we would get from the Democrat Congress would be amnesty proposals.
[03:22:32.772 --> 03:22:34.773]  We have voting rights proposals.
[03:22:34.773 --> 03:22:40.495]  So it's ridiculous, it's a joke, and it's a waste of time to even go in that direction.
[03:22:40.495 --> 03:22:49.558]  But as Trump becomes stronger, as the deep state coup is revealed, and the Democrats are in retreat and have to cover their weakness,
[03:22:50.603 --> 03:22:56.646]  Trump will have the political capital to push straight ahead with what he could have been doing all along.
[03:22:56.646 --> 03:22:58.567]  And in my opinion, maybe he should have been.
[03:22:58.567 --> 03:23:04.910]  Of course, he would have been crucified, just massacred by the media for cruelty.
[03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:13.035]  But it's actually more cruel to lure people into this country where they may face deportation regardless.
[03:23:13.035 --> 03:23:19.618]  You know, to spend their life savings, $5,000 or $6,000 paid to the cartels to get them to the border.
[03:23:20.313 --> 03:23:31.260]  To come across the border, maybe lose their life in the desert, or maybe wind up being sex trafficked, or catching a disease in one of these facilities.
[03:23:31.260 --> 03:23:39.646]  It's actually more humane to clearly indicate to the world that the open door policy is closed.
[03:23:39.646 --> 03:23:48.432]  And this actually was done last November, and then also around the New Year, where caravans were turned away with pepper spray.
[03:23:49.210 --> 03:23:53.131]  It seems like a long time ago, a few months, but it actually happened.
[03:23:53.131 --> 03:23:54.551]  And it went down pretty well.
[03:23:54.551 --> 03:24:08.774]  This was when there were 10,000 or more that were all stashed in Tijuana, and they did sort of a wide out to the right to try to storm the border in San Ysidro.
[03:24:08.774 --> 03:24:12.935]  And we just fired pepper spray canisters at them and turned them back.
[03:24:12.935 --> 03:24:18.196]  There was some bad media, you know, women dragging their children, you know, wiping their eyes from pepper spray.
[03:24:18.820 --> 03:24:25.768]  But let's face it, what country on earth can just have an open border to the world?
[03:24:25.768 --> 03:24:29.252]  It's ridiculous!
[03:24:29.252 --> 03:24:32.416]  There's no country if there's no border.
[03:24:32.416 --> 03:24:34.979]  Article 4, Section 4 of the Constitution says
[03:24:37.037 --> 03:24:41.742]  That the United States government shall protect the states from invasion.
[03:24:41.742 --> 03:24:43.364]  It's in the Constitution.
[03:24:43.364 --> 03:24:50.952]  If the army, if the military is for anything, it's for defending our own borders from an invasion.
[03:24:51.636 --> 03:24:53.237]  And fences work.
[03:24:53.237 --> 03:25:05.587]  Hungary, when Hungary was part of the Balkan chain to backdoor their way up to Germany, they'd come from Greece through the Balkans, which are not part of the EU Schengen, through Hungary into Europe.
[03:25:05.587 --> 03:25:08.489]  Hungary put up their own fence in months.
[03:25:08.489 --> 03:25:14.934]  Not a wall, not something fancy and beautiful made out of giant steel panels, but fence systems.
[03:25:14.934 --> 03:25:20.258]  In months, they put up hundreds of kilometers of fence and stopped the invasion cold.
[03:25:21.087 --> 03:25:32.912]  We can do it just as fast, and even before we have the big fence system like you see on that picture, Army troops can pull out concertina wire miles per day.
[03:25:32.912 --> 03:25:44.697]  And with concertina wire in a pyramid just on the ground, backed up with troops and pepper spray, just like we did in San Ysidro last November and around New Year's,
[03:25:45.749 --> 03:25:51.593]  If you have mobs of people coming to the border and, you know, you don't have to welcome them into your country.
[03:25:51.593 --> 03:26:00.900]  You don't have to have a taxi service of Border Patrol agents to take them, to hold them for 20 days, and then to release them across America.
[03:26:00.900 --> 03:26:03.161]  You can actually see them coming.
[03:26:03.161 --> 03:26:07.925]  We have the technology, FLIR, infrared, etc.
[03:26:07.925 --> 03:26:09.846]  We can see them coming.
[03:26:09.846 --> 03:26:14.189]  Loudspeaker, pepper spray, turn around, and very soon the word gets out.
[03:26:14.921 --> 03:26:18.104]  That it's not an open door anymore.
[03:26:18.104 --> 03:26:21.007]  If the president can't do this, I don't know what he can do.
[03:26:21.007 --> 03:26:27.113]  I mean, we're talking about sending more troops back to the Middle East, but we won't even defend our own border?
[03:26:27.113 --> 03:26:30.616]  We act as if we have to take everybody across our border?
[03:26:30.616 --> 03:26:33.719]  If we stop them in northern Mexico,
[03:26:35.040 --> 03:26:52.660]  The dynamic changes completely, because what happens is, instead of Mexico being a rapid turnstile where they're just flowing across, dropping money in the coffers of the cartels and the people who make money off of this migration,
[03:26:53.320 --> 03:26:53.841]  We're good to go.
[03:27:06.235 --> 03:27:09.018]  There's no disincentive.
[03:27:09.018 --> 03:27:15.464]  There's advertisements out in Guatemala and El Salvador saying, come to America, everything's free.
[03:27:15.464 --> 03:27:17.566]  There are villages emptying out.
[03:27:17.566 --> 03:27:23.851]  Some people say more than 1% of Guatemala has recently moved to America.
[03:27:23.851 --> 03:27:28.716]  Already, I think a quarter of El Salvador lives in the United States of America.
[03:27:29.384 --> 03:27:32.208]  America is essentially abolishing itself.
[03:27:32.208 --> 03:27:36.654]  And if we don't get a grip on this, we're not going to be America.
[03:27:36.654 --> 03:27:38.958]  Because culture is destiny.
[03:27:38.958 --> 03:27:46.008]  The people that are coming in don't know about the Constitution, can't spell it, don't even read or write Spanish.
[03:27:46.818 --> 03:27:48.819]  are not particularly bright.
[03:27:48.819 --> 03:27:58.146]  The only thing they know for sure is if they get to America, eventually they'll be able to vote for the Democrats and they'll vote for more welfare.
[03:27:58.146 --> 03:28:01.628]  And if that happens, folks, we're done.
[03:28:01.628 --> 03:28:07.172]  So it's going to take a president with a very harsh policy at the border.
[03:28:07.172 --> 03:28:10.314]  But you have, as they say, you have to be cruel to be kind.
[03:28:10.314 --> 03:28:10.875]  You have to
[03:28:11.989 --> 03:28:16.992]  Clearly indicate that the open passage, the open border is finished.
[03:28:16.992 --> 03:28:20.153]  Only then will this mass migration stop.
[03:28:20.153 --> 03:28:26.977]  Until that happens, you know, waiting for miles of wall to be built when it's going to take a decade.
[03:28:26.977 --> 03:28:31.399]  In a decade, there won't be a United States of America as we know it.
[03:28:31.399 --> 03:28:37.562]  You know, in the next election, I mean, if Florida or Texas goes Democrat, it's all over.
[03:28:37.562 --> 03:28:41.324]  It'll be, hello, President Buttigieg or Kamala Harris.
[03:28:42.265 --> 03:28:45.390]  And then the floodgates will be wide open.
[03:28:45.390 --> 03:28:49.196]  So this really is an existential moment for America.
[03:28:49.196 --> 03:28:52.281]  When we come back on the other side, we'll start taking some calls.
[03:28:53.095 --> 03:28:55.297]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.
[03:28:55.297 --> 03:28:56.598]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:28:56.598 --> 03:28:57.159]  Hey, whatcha doing?
[03:28:57.159 --> 03:28:58.660]  Ah, Mother's Day, remember?
[03:28:58.660 --> 03:28:59.020]  Oh, yeah.

[03:29:57.949 --> 03:29:58.769]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[03:29:58.769 --> 03:30:00.110]  You are the man, Alex.
[03:30:00.110 --> 03:30:01.632]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[03:30:01.632 --> 03:30:02.432]  I'm so excited.
[03:30:02.432 --> 03:30:03.353]  I'm such a big fan.
[03:30:03.353 --> 03:30:05.835]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[03:30:05.835 --> 03:30:08.337]  I gotta do a shout-out for the Bone Broth.
[03:30:08.337 --> 03:30:09.759]  The Bone Broth.
[03:30:09.759 --> 03:30:11.180]  The Bone Broth.
[03:30:11.180 --> 03:30:12.601]  The Bone Broth.
[03:30:12.601 --> 03:30:13.842]  The Bone Broth.
[03:30:13.842 --> 03:30:18.586]  Tastes like, tastes like a great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[03:30:18.586 --> 03:30:19.787]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[03:30:19.787 --> 03:30:21.188]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[03:30:21.188 --> 03:30:22.589]  It tastes like Ovaltine.
[03:30:23.430 --> 03:30:24.050]  Good!
[03:30:24.050 --> 03:30:24.670]  Whoa!
[03:30:24.670 --> 03:30:26.371]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[03:30:26.371 --> 03:30:30.572]  My daughter uses the Bubblegum Fluoride Free Toothpaste.
[03:30:30.572 --> 03:30:34.372]  I've used the Supermail Vitality, a host of other products.
[03:30:34.372 --> 03:30:36.393]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[03:30:36.393 --> 03:30:38.953]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[03:30:38.953 --> 03:30:39.714]  I'm thanking you.
[03:30:39.714 --> 03:30:46.155]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chaga mushroom, the true bone broth.
[03:30:46.155 --> 03:30:46.975]  It is next level.
[03:30:46.975 --> 03:30:47.555]  It really is good.
[03:30:47.555 --> 03:30:48.095]  So thank you.
[03:30:48.095 --> 03:30:50.036]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[03:30:50.036 --> 03:30:50.396]  Thank you.

[03:31:53.464 --> 03:32:02.750]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[03:32:02.750 --> 03:32:05.612]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[03:32:05.612 --> 03:32:11.656]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[03:32:12.336 --> 03:32:18.581]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source, and the Globeless tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:18.581 --> 03:32:24.866]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:24.866 --> 03:32:31.932]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[03:32:31.932 --> 03:32:32.132]  But!
[03:32:32.953 --> 03:32:34.574]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:33:13.923 --> 03:33:20.748]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:20.748 --> 03:33:26.773]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:33:26.773 --> 03:33:36.901]  Okay, before we start taking calls, I want to pull together some foreign threads and sort of paint a picture globally, so to speak.
[03:33:36.901 --> 03:33:39.743]  Last week in Australia, the conservative
[03:33:40.535 --> 03:33:46.119]  It's weird in that country, the conservative party is called the liberals and the liberals are called labor.
[03:33:46.119 --> 03:33:57.067]  But anyway, 60 polls in a row, mainstream polls in a row, declared that labor was going to win the election by a wide margin.
[03:33:57.067 --> 03:34:06.334]  And just like with Trump and with the Brexit result, the Brexit referendum, the polls were wrong.
[03:34:06.334 --> 03:34:06.914]  So in 2019,
[03:34:08.618 --> 03:34:18.207]  You have to pretty much come to the conclusion that when you hear about polls in the media, all you're doing is sticking a funnel into your ear for propaganda.
[03:34:19.190 --> 03:34:21.791]  Number one, who honestly answers polls?
[03:34:21.791 --> 03:34:37.036]  Who says, sure, I'll take ten minutes of my time and go through a hundred questions, of which they'll cherry pick some that they want certain results, where the five preceding questions were designed to lead you to an answer on the question that they want.
[03:34:37.036 --> 03:34:39.717]  I mean, the whole science of it is bogus.
[03:34:39.717 --> 03:34:46.099]  The sample is ridiculous because most people hang up on pollsters or lie to them.
[03:34:46.099 --> 03:34:47.359]  But the point is,
[03:34:48.428 --> 03:35:00.094]  Everybody in Australia thought that the Liberal Labour Party was going to win, and instead the Conservative Liberal Party, Prime Minister Middleton won.
[03:35:00.094 --> 03:35:03.616]  It shocked everybody, just like Trump's victory shocked everybody.
[03:35:03.616 --> 03:35:06.878]  But by now it shouldn't be so shocking.
[03:35:06.878 --> 03:35:13.822]  That election was over basically a Green New Deal party versus a free market economics party.
[03:35:14.634 --> 03:35:20.556]  And people in public or on a poll, they might say, sure, I'm for the Green New Deal, I roll.
[03:35:20.556 --> 03:35:33.101]  But when it comes to voting for, let's cut our electricity by half in 15 years, or let's continue having a job, people voted, let's continue to have a job.
[03:35:33.101 --> 03:35:40.564]  And if you extrapolate those results to an American 2020 election, it would be like a candidate Kamala Harris
[03:35:43.368 --> 03:35:51.592]  For the Green New Deal versus President Trump for free market economics, and I think it would be a wipeout for Trump.
[03:35:51.592 --> 03:36:04.558]  Even in some countries where you think that the conservative or national side is not that strong, there are indications of a real turn of the tide.
[03:36:04.558 --> 03:36:12.121]  Last week, there was a popular national television show in Germany, and they took a call-in question
[03:36:13.007 --> 03:36:16.168]  Does Islam belong in Germany?
[03:36:16.168 --> 03:36:19.669]  And they had something like 15,000 people calling in.
[03:36:19.669 --> 03:36:23.851]  Sure, they're self-selecting, but these are the people that were motivated.
[03:36:23.851 --> 03:36:29.453]  And something like 94% of the callers said, Islam does not belong in Germany.
[03:36:30.094 --> 03:36:38.158]  I think that they believed that they had some privacy, so they were more free with their opinion, where they would never say that to a pollster.
[03:36:38.158 --> 03:36:45.022]  You're talking to a pollster, you don't know if it's some party guy who's recording your information for later use against you.
[03:36:45.022 --> 03:36:48.844]  Anyway, there are some very positive trends.
[03:36:48.844 --> 03:36:55.688]  But what all this means is that the EU bosses and the other globalist forces are going to be more desperate
[03:36:56.272 --> 03:37:24.571]  So the game is not over by a long shot, but we do seem to be lining up for some kind of a showdown over national sovereignty and free market economics versus globalism slash communism and the road to serfdom, where global elites, the Brennans, the Comeys, the Junkers, the Merkels, the Macrons, are going to run the world like a plantation
[03:37:25.171 --> 03:37:41.323]  Where the middle class are just the slaves in the harness, you know, working our way so that we can pay for the migrants who will come into our countries and then vote that we as the slaves should work harder to pay them more welfare benefits.
[03:37:41.323 --> 03:37:47.007]  You know, this can't go on forever, and it's going to wind up one way or the other.
[03:37:47.007 --> 03:37:52.911]  But even if we do have some victories, just remember, progressivism is a religion.
[03:37:53.547 --> 03:37:55.348]  And they're never going to quit.
[03:37:55.348 --> 03:38:02.091]  Just like you would never get Muslims or Christians to deny their faith based on rational arguments.
[03:38:02.091 --> 03:38:06.333]  Because to progressives, they have the light of truth.
[03:38:06.333 --> 03:38:08.895]  They have goodness on their side.
[03:38:08.895 --> 03:38:11.136]  They are true believers.
[03:38:11.136 --> 03:38:13.657]  You are never going to change their mind.
[03:38:13.657 --> 03:38:15.898]  All we can do is beat them politically.
[03:38:16.608 --> 03:38:31.638]  And if they pull enough tricks, if they manage, for example, to impeach Trump or something goes kinetic and Trump is taken out and we wind up in a hot civil war instead of a cold civil war, then we're going to have to defeat them the other way.
[03:38:31.638 --> 03:38:35.681]  But they're never going to just acquiesce to our arguments.
[03:38:35.681 --> 03:38:41.705]  We're never going to convince them of the rightness of our logic, the goodness of our history.
[03:38:41.705 --> 03:38:42.886]  It's never going to happen.
[03:38:43.419 --> 03:38:49.804]  We're going to have to defeat them, politically if we can, and by other means if that becomes necessary.
[03:38:49.804 --> 03:38:53.726]  Alright, let's go to some calls.
[03:38:53.726 --> 03:39:00.531]  I see, since I'm kind of talking about immigration, let's go to Lander in Oregon.
[03:39:00.531 --> 03:39:01.292]  Go ahead, Lander.
[03:39:01.292 --> 03:39:04.374]  Hey Matt, thanks for having me on.
[03:39:04.374 --> 03:39:06.255]  You're welcome.
[03:39:06.255 --> 03:39:10.278]  So, I like what you were talking about with all this stuff with the border, but
[03:39:10.934 --> 03:39:15.396]  I'm wondering right now is, you know, we've already taken in so many immigrants.
[03:39:15.396 --> 03:39:19.397]  Do we already get basically a lethal dose for what the country can take?
[03:39:19.397 --> 03:39:22.098]  What do you see happening in the future there?
[03:39:22.098 --> 03:39:24.859]  Yeah, that's a really, that's a good point.
[03:39:24.859 --> 03:39:33.122]  It may already be too late because, you know, there's an old German saying, there's nothing as permanent as a temporary guest worker.
[03:39:33.122 --> 03:39:35.983]  You know, once somebody gets into the community,
[03:39:36.770 --> 03:39:47.598]  It's almost impossible to actually deport them, even if they're, you know, a serial killer knocking off old ladies, like we had one illegal revealed last week.
[03:39:47.598 --> 03:39:58.406]  He was an African, actually, I think from Nigeria, but he was going to old ladies' homes and killing women between, like, the age of 70 and 90.
[03:39:58.406 --> 03:40:00.368]  You don't see that in the mainstream media at all.
[03:40:00.368 --> 03:40:04.671]  I mean, imagine if it had been some white guy knocking off old black ladies.
[03:40:04.671 --> 03:40:05.972]  It would be unbelievable.
[03:40:06.889 --> 03:40:12.590]  So, it's going to be very hard to deport any of this wave that is coming in.
[03:40:12.590 --> 03:40:16.591]  Eventually, they and their children will probably be voting.
[03:40:16.591 --> 03:40:23.833]  So, it may mean that we're going to have to have some kind of a really harsh incident.
[03:40:23.833 --> 03:40:33.155]  For example, there's a lot of concern about Ebola right now in the Congo, and even in Nigeria, getting into Sudan, spreading.
[03:40:33.155 --> 03:40:35.215]  And the people carrying the Ebola
[03:40:35.908 --> 03:40:44.890]  There have been carriers that have had no symptoms for like weeks past when they thought it was safe after isolation.
[03:40:44.890 --> 03:40:59.314]  If the jihadis that have been attacking these Ebola clinics get infected people, infected jihadis onto an airplane, or they fly them to Mexico and have them walk across the border, if Ebola gets loose into this country,
[03:41:00.057 --> 03:41:02.419]  And we have no means to counter it.
[03:41:02.419 --> 03:41:04.861]  There's no vaccines.
[03:41:04.861 --> 03:41:14.009]  One Ebola patient requires an army of medical staff and just like a landfill and incinerators to deal with all of the medical waste.
[03:41:15.015 --> 03:41:26.982]  Something like that, at that level, would, I think, be required to turn Americans harshly against the illegal immigration wave to the point where we would be mass deporting them.
[03:41:26.982 --> 03:41:31.424]  But short of that, I don't think that there's any chance of mass deportation.
[03:41:31.424 --> 03:41:41.310]  And as you said, we may already have had a lethal dose in terms of the Cloward-Piven strategy overwhelming our welfare system.
[03:41:41.970 --> 03:41:58.044]  And the Dunning-Kruger effect of reducing our IQ to the point where we just have a bunch of morons who always win the elections by voting for whoever promises the most welfare, which is sort of like voting for the Idiocracy Party.
[03:41:58.044 --> 03:41:59.625]  But look, it worked in California.
[03:41:59.625 --> 03:42:05.390]  I mean, you just look at California and you see the Democrat plan for all 50 states.
[03:42:05.390 --> 03:42:08.713]  You know, the Democrats that wreck cities like Baltimore or Chicago
[03:42:09.594 --> 03:42:11.997]  They don't turn around and say, we're really sorry.
[03:42:11.997 --> 03:42:16.441]  Do you Republicans have any advice to give us about how we can fix this city?
[03:42:16.441 --> 03:42:17.883]  Heck no.
[03:42:17.883 --> 03:42:23.889]  They're glad to wreck the city as long as the political elites rule the ruins.
[03:42:24.827 --> 03:42:32.992]  And don't for a second think that Democrats are ever going to come to their senses and say, wow, we've really been off the track.
[03:42:32.992 --> 03:42:37.134]  We need to institute some free market economic policies.
[03:42:37.134 --> 03:42:38.195]  No way.
[03:42:38.195 --> 03:42:45.799]  They don't care if every city looks like Chicago or Baltimore as long as the Democrat bosses are in charge.
[03:42:45.799 --> 03:42:47.560]  They'll live like kings.
[03:42:47.560 --> 03:42:49.381]  When we come back, we'll take some more calls.
[03:42:53.928 --> 03:43:01.338]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[03:43:01.338 --> 03:43:05.623]  This is a digital, AI-enforced gag order.
[03:43:05.623 --> 03:43:09.328]  Not to say the name Alex Jones or InfoWars.com.
[03:43:14.997 --> 03:43:16.697]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[03:43:16.697 --> 03:43:17.918]  This is racketeering.
[03:43:17.918 --> 03:43:19.038]  This is cartels.
[03:43:19.038 --> 03:43:21.439]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[03:43:21.439 --> 03:43:23.319]  We need it now.
[03:43:23.319 --> 03:43:25.019]  You can take on Big Ten.
[03:43:25.019 --> 03:43:33.942]  They saw Infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family, populist organization.
[03:43:33.942 --> 03:43:42.004]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[03:43:42.004 --> 03:43:42.864]  The way to fight back
[03:43:53.209 --> 03:43:55.550]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[03:43:55.550 --> 03:44:02.173]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[03:44:54.091 --> 03:44:57.113]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing.
[03:44:57.113 --> 03:44:59.694]  That what God gave us through Mother Nature is incredible.
[03:44:59.694 --> 03:45:02.476]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world.
[03:45:02.476 --> 03:45:04.457]  And the globalists are so upset.
[03:45:04.457 --> 03:45:07.279]  The problem is people forget to take them.
[03:45:08.530 --> 03:45:13.594]  And that's why the whole industry has moved towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[03:45:13.594 --> 03:45:14.575]  So we looked at that.
[03:45:14.575 --> 03:45:16.196]  We made the very best a.m.
[03:45:16.196 --> 03:45:16.637]  and p.m.
[03:45:16.637 --> 03:45:24.924]  packets out there with an incredible spectrum of 13 different capsules that you take in two servings a day that are game-changing a.m.
[03:45:24.924 --> 03:45:26.004]  and p.m.
[03:45:26.004 --> 03:45:28.607]  total health and performance eight pack
[03:45:29.599 --> 03:45:30.079]  Okay, it's true.
[03:45:30.079 --> 03:45:31.859]  I stayed up late last night
[03:46:52.645 --> 03:46:57.109]  And it's official!
[03:46:57.109 --> 03:46:59.712]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:25.928 --> 03:47:36.936]  Okay, before I'm gone today, I want to mention I do actually have a new book out, which you can see right here, and it's a collection of my short stuff.
[03:47:36.936 --> 03:47:43.822]  I've written a lot of short stories and some essays, and it's available on Amazon and on Kindle.
[03:47:43.822 --> 03:47:45.803]  I'll do an audiobook in a little while.
[03:47:45.803 --> 03:47:48.245]  Just wanted to mention that.
[03:47:48.245 --> 03:47:50.947]  Something that's really important, I was touching on in the last segment,
[03:47:51.653 --> 03:47:57.078]  Even when things are going well for us, remember, the left will never quit.
[03:47:57.078 --> 03:48:02.302]  It's the most powerful proselytizing religion on the planet.
[03:48:02.302 --> 03:48:09.829]  The proof of it is that it's not Christians who are converting Marxists, it's the other way around.
[03:48:09.829 --> 03:48:18.236]  James Comey believes, his great mentor of his entire life was this so-called theologian named Reinhold Niebuhr,
[03:48:19.011 --> 03:48:23.213]  Who believed that Jesus was sort of a early Marxist.
[03:48:23.213 --> 03:48:33.618]  Nellie Orr, who probably wrote the dossier more than Christopher Steele, she went to the Soviet Union to do her research during the good old gulag days.
[03:48:33.618 --> 03:48:41.302]  Brennan voted for the communist Gus Hall in the 70s when the Soviets were still running the gulags.
[03:48:41.302 --> 03:48:45.724]  So these folks absolutely are committed globalists.
[03:48:46.388 --> 03:48:48.549]  They can't wear the hammer and sickle anymore.
[03:48:48.549 --> 03:48:49.369]  It doesn't sell.
[03:48:49.369 --> 03:48:51.250]  They would if they could.
[03:48:51.250 --> 03:48:56.891]  But eventually, the tiger never changes its stripes.
[03:48:56.891 --> 03:49:02.113]  They do use a different mask to suit the era, but they're never going to quit.
[03:49:02.113 --> 03:49:05.454]  So this is going to be a lifelong battle for us.
[03:49:05.454 --> 03:49:09.715]  A problem with us conservatives is Trump wins, we think it's over.
[03:49:09.715 --> 03:49:11.316]  That's the end of the threat.
[03:49:12.026 --> 03:49:16.129]  It's never, as we saw in the midterm elections, it's never over.
[03:49:16.129 --> 03:49:18.591]  We have to keep hammering away at them.
[03:49:18.591 --> 03:49:25.456]  And we are winning, as we can see from these elections in Australia and Britain, etc.
[03:49:25.456 --> 03:49:33.581]  But it's important to realize that they still control the mass media, and that's why they're going all out for censorship.
[03:49:33.581 --> 03:49:37.124]  That's why they'd like to see InfoWars absolutely destroyed.
[03:49:37.947 --> 03:49:43.370]  And it's very important in every channel that we can to keep pushing.
[03:49:43.370 --> 03:49:47.372]  Temporarily, I'm not banned on Facebook, which is unbelievable.
[03:49:47.372 --> 03:49:54.596]  So I'm posting links, but I'm, you know, on Facebook I can't post an InfoWars link or a Paul Joseph Watson video.
[03:49:54.596 --> 03:49:56.337]  He's a banned person.
[03:49:56.337 --> 03:50:00.460]  So I wonder if I'm even, you know, doing the right thing by even being on Facebook at all.
[03:50:00.460 --> 03:50:04.302]  I, like, this morning I just wrote a text on Facebook
[03:50:04.870 --> 03:50:10.873]  You know, a banned un-person with the initials PJW has a great new video out.
[03:50:10.873 --> 03:50:14.014]  If I actually linked, I'd be gone for 30 days.
[03:50:14.014 --> 03:50:16.315]  So I'm sort of torn there.
[03:50:16.315 --> 03:50:20.137]  All right, let's go back to the calls while we have a chance.
[03:50:20.137 --> 03:50:26.480]  And I'd like to talk to Judy in Florida about Trump's constitutional authority.
[03:50:26.480 --> 03:50:28.161]  Go ahead, Judy.
[03:50:28.161 --> 03:50:28.781]  Hi, Matt.
[03:50:28.781 --> 03:50:30.542]  It's great to talk to you.
[03:50:30.542 --> 03:50:31.583]  Sorry if I'm raspy.
[03:50:31.583 --> 03:50:33.063]  I'm home on doctor's orders.
[03:50:34.764 --> 03:50:45.407]  Yeah, I'm concerned about the authority that he has, that he doesn't seem to be exercising at least well enough, in my view, particularly when it comes to the border.
[03:50:45.407 --> 03:50:54.829]  Because it seems as though, even with what Obama put in place during his presidency, that it's been an invasion from the beginning.
[03:50:55.478 --> 03:51:01.481]  So it's, you know, I wish he would have and I think he should have acted much sooner in that regard.
[03:51:01.481 --> 03:51:09.165]  And also I feel the same way when it comes to the censorship of his own constituency or those on the right in general.
[03:51:09.165 --> 03:51:24.072]  And I just feel like, um, we don't know all of the deals that are being made behind closed doors as far as the survival of the nation or what he's been threatened with or whatever is holding him back.
[03:51:24.560 --> 03:51:33.045]  Because it doesn't seem as though some of these decisions are very forthright, or in our favor, or for our protection.
[03:51:33.045 --> 03:51:38.188]  Yeah, there's no doubt that he has a lot of department heads who are not fully committed.
[03:51:38.188 --> 03:51:49.295]  I think that the Department of Homeland Secretary, what's her name, Nilsson, she was slow walking, you know, border protection.
[03:51:49.295 --> 03:51:53.198]  He has a lot of people that are maybe more afraid of the media than they need to be.
[03:51:53.994 --> 03:52:00.963]  I personally wish he would put, from day one, put troops on the border and said, you know, the open border is done.
[03:52:00.963 --> 03:52:03.066]  It's in our power to do it.
[03:52:03.883 --> 03:52:08.606]  All it needs is concertina wire, troops, and pepper spray, and it's done.
[03:52:08.606 --> 03:52:14.731]  People won't keep coming if they keep getting pepper sprayed 100 meters inside of Mexico.
[03:52:14.731 --> 03:52:25.118]  And when there's 100,000 in northern Mexico, the Mexican government will get real sick and tired of dealing with refugee camps in their soil.
[03:52:25.118 --> 03:52:29.341]  So it's really a sucker game to just be admitting 1,500 a day
[03:52:32.503 --> 03:52:34.808]  That's something like, you know, almost 600,000 a year.
[03:52:36.787 --> 03:52:47.296]  And then on top of that, we have the legal, so-called legal migration by chain migration, which he hopes to do something with, but that would require a deal with Congress.
[03:52:47.296 --> 03:52:52.101]  As we saw yesterday, there aren't going to be any deals with Congress.
[03:52:52.101 --> 03:52:57.225]  The President really needs to use his constitutional authority and seal the border.
[03:52:57.225 --> 03:52:58.486]  I don't know what he's waiting for.
[03:52:58.486 --> 03:53:03.711]  I've seen some Border Patrol people, retired Border Patrol people, that have
[03:53:04.301 --> 03:53:06.682]  He laid out the exact plan that I mentioned.
[03:53:06.682 --> 03:53:09.964]  Concertino wire, troops, pepper spray.
[03:53:09.964 --> 03:53:10.744]  It can be done.
[03:53:10.744 --> 03:53:13.666]  I don't know why he doesn't do it.
[03:53:13.666 --> 03:53:26.412]  I don't know who's around him that's holding him back or if it's Jared and Ivanka and those guys, if they're surrounded by bleeding heart liberals even in the White House.
[03:53:26.412 --> 03:53:26.853]  I don't know.
[03:53:26.853 --> 03:53:28.113]  I don't know.
[03:53:30.672 --> 03:53:34.053]  Wayne in Arizona has been holding the longest.
[03:53:34.053 --> 03:53:37.193]  You think that the grand jury, there are grand juries going on right now?
[03:53:37.193 --> 03:53:40.034]  In your opinion?
[03:53:40.034 --> 03:53:45.195]  No, I want to talk about the preamble, but you're talking about the immigration, this invasion.
[03:53:45.195 --> 03:53:54.497]  I'm back on Wayno down here in Cochise County, where one of many illegal and unconstitutional invasions are going on.
[03:53:54.497 --> 03:53:55.518]  Page 38 of the White
[03:53:59.588 --> 03:54:10.900]  Yeah, Wayne, your audio is really bad and broken up, but I get your point.
[03:54:10.900 --> 03:54:15.545]  You know, Trump could not only use the military, he could ask for volunteers to come down to the border.
[03:54:16.235 --> 03:54:21.557]  I mean, there are a lot of tools that could be used, including calling out the militia.
[03:54:21.557 --> 03:54:23.718]  This is an invasion, absolutely.
[03:54:23.718 --> 03:54:26.800]  How many millions a year does it take before it's an invasion?
[03:54:26.800 --> 03:54:30.601]  Rome wasn't destroyed by, you know, invading armies.
[03:54:30.601 --> 03:54:38.605]  Rome was destroyed by refugees that they allowed into the country, the Visigoths, who were pleading that they had to escape from the Huns.
[03:54:38.605 --> 03:54:41.566]  They let the Visigoths in, and the Visigoths sacked Rome.
[03:54:43.085 --> 03:54:44.266]  Wildman in Missouri.
[03:54:44.266 --> 03:54:47.168]  Boy, you had some wild weather there last night.
[03:54:47.168 --> 03:54:49.690]  Oh, you want to talk about the Second Amendment?
[03:54:49.690 --> 03:54:50.370]  Go ahead.
[03:54:50.370 --> 03:54:53.573]  Yeah, I was just wondering if you heard about Missouri.
[03:54:53.573 --> 03:54:54.374]  We just passed
[03:54:55.515 --> 03:55:08.097]  The Second Amendment Preservation Act, which nullifies all federal gun control laws and makes it illegal for any federal law enforcement official to attempt to enforce federal gun control law in our state.
[03:55:08.097 --> 03:55:16.739]  And I also want to say thanks to Josh Hawley, our new senator, for being one of the few people in Washington to stand up to big tech and the censorship in recent hearings.
[03:55:16.739 --> 03:55:17.799]  Thank you, Hawley.
[03:55:17.799 --> 03:55:23.460]  Wildman, was that a bill that's proposed or is that an actual law that's passed?
[03:55:23.460 --> 03:55:24.220]  It just passed.
[03:55:26.044 --> 03:55:28.005]  Well, we'll have to look into that.
[03:55:28.005 --> 03:55:30.646]  I'll look that up when the show's over.
[03:55:30.646 --> 03:55:33.547]  Second Amendment Preservation Act in Missouri.
[03:55:33.547 --> 03:55:36.409]  Okay, all right, now let's go out to California.
[03:55:36.409 --> 03:55:36.749]  Ian.
[03:55:36.749 --> 03:55:41.751]  Ian wants to know when we think that Trump will punish the Russiagators.
[03:55:41.751 --> 03:55:43.552]  Well, can't be soon enough for me.
[03:55:43.552 --> 03:55:45.933]  Go ahead, Ian.
[03:55:45.933 --> 03:55:48.754]  Yeah, I mean, I feel, can you hear me?
[03:55:48.754 --> 03:55:49.615]  Yes, loud and clear.
[03:55:49.615 --> 03:55:49.695]  Okay.
[03:55:55.609 --> 03:56:06.196]  My family came from the Philippines and we've been here for 12, 15 years and we assimilated and all this stuff and I've seen horrible things.
[03:56:06.196 --> 03:56:10.759]  I come from a country where there's not a lot of freedoms and all this stuff and all this corruption.
[03:56:10.759 --> 03:56:14.301]  I never thought that I would ever see that here.
[03:56:14.301 --> 03:56:21.986]  But to see such a blatant attempt to take over the government from within.
[03:56:21.986 --> 03:56:24.928]  Yeah, it's very third world-ish.
[03:56:25.580 --> 03:56:27.561]  It's very third world-ish.
[03:56:27.561 --> 03:56:38.427]  And if it's not stopped, if this isn't nipped in the bud, so to speak, if people don't go to jail, then what's the incentive not to just keep going, to try it again?
[03:56:38.427 --> 03:56:44.910]  I personally think that Brennan, Clapper, Comey, Strzok, Page, Orr, they need to be in prison.
[03:56:44.910 --> 03:56:46.811]  And maybe that's just the beginning.
[03:56:46.811 --> 03:56:50.853]  I'm optimistic that they're all ratting on each other right now, trying to make deals.
[03:56:50.853 --> 03:56:53.415]  And I think they'll all be pointing upward to Obama.
[03:56:53.415 --> 03:56:53.795]  In the end,
[03:56:54.435 --> 03:56:57.916]  Their main defense is going to be Obama ordered us to do it.
[03:56:57.916 --> 03:57:04.078]  I mean, all those meetings in the Oval Office between the principals, they weren't talking about, you know, cookie recipes.
[03:57:04.078 --> 03:57:07.700]  They were talking about setting up this deep state coup.
[03:57:07.700 --> 03:57:09.720]  I'm pretty sure about that.
[03:57:09.720 --> 03:57:12.841]  Well, this is the last call of the day there.
[03:57:12.841 --> 03:57:14.722]  Good call.
[03:57:14.722 --> 03:57:17.043]  I hate to see America turn into a third world country.
[03:57:18.214 --> 03:57:24.775]  If we're going to re-establish the rule of law, Trump's going to have to eventually go hardcore.
[03:57:24.775 --> 03:57:30.557]  And it looks like he has the building blocks in place with Attorney General Barr and the U.S.
[03:57:30.557 --> 03:57:32.437]  Attorney from Connecticut.
[03:57:32.437 --> 03:57:41.199]  I just hope it's not another bait and switch where we're going to get sold out by, you know, deep state actors that sound good but really aren't going to do it.
[03:57:43.971 --> 03:57:48.993]  InfoWard, the most banned network in the world.
[03:57:48.993 --> 03:57:50.954]  Tom in Texas, police officer on the border.
[03:57:50.954 --> 03:57:53.335]  Talks about MS-13 and more.
[03:57:53.335 --> 03:57:54.375]  Thanks for calling, Tom.
[03:57:54.375 --> 03:57:54.835]  Yes, sir.
[03:57:54.835 --> 03:57:56.136]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:57:56.136 --> 03:57:58.237]  Just want to thank you for your products.
[03:57:58.237 --> 03:58:01.958]  I have the InfoWard decals on the outside of my cell phone case.
[03:58:01.958 --> 03:58:04.139]  My truck, sports shirts, all the equipment.
[03:58:04.139 --> 03:58:06.100]  I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[03:58:06.100 --> 03:58:07.060]  God bless you, brother.
[03:58:07.060 --> 03:58:10.602]  And I have three or four InfoWard bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[03:58:10.602 --> 03:58:13.743]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[03:58:14.063 --> 03:58:15.184]  You're our only hope, brother.
[03:58:15.184 --> 03:58:17.485]  I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[03:58:17.485 --> 03:58:20.226]  It's people like you on the ground, as you know, that's boots on the ground.
[03:58:46.398 --> 03:58:55.805]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques.
[03:58:55.805 --> 03:59:06.833]  Based on hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions, we've sourced only the best to provide you with our immune support and Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
