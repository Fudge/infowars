[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:11.260]   - Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.600]   of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.000]   on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.620]   Welcome to the Alex Jones Show
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.220]   on this Sunday, June 7th, 2015.
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.060]   I'm David Knight.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.060]   I'm your host here in the studio.
[00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.860]   Alex Jones is gonna be co-hosting with us today.
[00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.800]   He's gonna be joining us in the next segment
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.980]   to break down something that we just found out about.
[00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.700]   Of course, we see all these international agreements
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.900]   that are being made.
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.220]   One of these international agreements
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.560]   that is coming not from the trade treaties,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.540]   but it's actually coming from the State Department.
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.700]   See, we have all these bureaucracies
[00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.940]   that are writing rules and regulations
[00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.780]   that have the effect of law.
[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.380]   They've already bypassed our elected representatives
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.060]   in so many areas.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.280]   It's hardly even a surprise that we've got now
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.740]   sovereignty-changing, massive agreements
[00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.940]   that aren't just about trade,
[00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.420]   and they certainly aren't about free trade.
[00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.340]   They're about a crony capitalism kind of trade.
[00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.140]   This is what we saw with the banker bailouts.
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.060]   This is the kind of quote-unquote free trade
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.300]   that we're getting with these trade agreements.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.060]   But we see these regulations coming in
[00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.500]   from various bureaucracies all of the time,
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.920]   writing their own laws.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.740]   Congress creates these organizations,
[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.660]   like the EPA, like the IRS, like the ATF,
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.820]   all these different organizations
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.340]   that then go off and write their rules.
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.340]   The FCC coming out and taking over the internet,
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.580]   for example, just claiming that they have control over it,
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.860]   and they're now going to rewrite the rules.
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.060]   So they're going to exert control.
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.740]   It wasn't even given to them by Congress.
[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.500]   They just claim it, name it and claim it,
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.820]   and then they start writing rules for it.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.420]   So now we've got the State Department
[00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.340]   who's coming out and saying that they're going
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.380]   to have regulations that are going to govern
[00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.980]   international arms trade.
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.500]   That sounds familiar, doesn't it?
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500]   Remember the UN Arms Trade Treaty
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.820]   that they tried so many times to get through?
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.020]   They actually called it a treaty.
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.420]   Maybe that's why they couldn't get it through.
[00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.060]   They made the mistake of not calling it
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.500]   an agreement or a partnership.
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.200]   Now, we're going to talk about why these trade agreements
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.700]   are really treaties.
[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.740]   And of course, I'm very happy to see now Rand Paul
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.140]   and Senator Jeff Sessions.
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.060]   I always get them confused with Pete Sessions.
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.100]   Pete Sessions is on the wrong side of this, folks.
[00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.020]   He's a congressman, and he is pushing
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.340]   for a fast-tracked agreement for trade treaties
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.940]   that he has not read.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.380]   Pete Sessions, Senator Sessions, is a hero on this.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.980]   He's gone to actually read this, as has Rand Paul,
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.580]   and they're both speaking out on this,
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.860]   saying that this is not a trade agreement.
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.600]   This is, in fact, a treaty.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.580]   This whole thing is treachery, quite frankly.
[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.420]   It is treachery to even call it something
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.740]   other than a treaty, because they didn't have the votes
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.220]   to pass fast-track if it was a treaty.
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.940]   They had 62 votes.
[00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.820]   If they came up and honestly said that this was a treaty,
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.620]   they would have needed 67 votes.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.200]   That's why they called it an agreement.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.500]   That's why they called it a partnership.
[00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.420]   And of course, NAFTA was passed that way.
[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.700]   They called it the North American Free Trade Agreement.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.700]   But now, if you go back and look at what they're telling people
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.220]   when it comes up to investor state tribunals,
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.100]   the same thing that we now see being applied
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.780]   with these Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic partnerships,
[00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.300]   these tribunals, I guess we should call them IS, right?
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.340]   Investor state.
[00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.820]   It's another kind of IS, also created by the same people.
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.900]   But these tribunals, they say, really are treaty law claims.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.500]   So the people who are representing the corporations,
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.980]   the multinational corporations,
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.020]   in these arbitration agreements are quite clear
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.420]   about the fact that they are practicing treaty law.
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.180]   Look, treaty is any kind of an agreement
[00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.940]   between one or more nations that affects commerce
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.300]   or peace or various other aspects.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.500]   This is a treaty.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.980]   So the first thing they do is lie about it being a treaty
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.460]   so they don't have to get the votes.
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.780]   Senator Sessions has seen this.
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.780]   He's written a very scathing letter.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.780]   We're going to talk about that in detail in the next segment.
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.180]   Alex Jones is going to be co-hosting
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.060]   with us throughout this hour.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.020]   He's going to be talking about this particular instance
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.340]   with the State Department.
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.500]   This is essentially, according to the NRA,
[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.220]   they're saying that this is a gag order
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.980]   on firearms-related speech.
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.340]   In other words, they're going to come after you
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.940]   with some pretty heavy, very draconian penalties
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.700]   if you start putting out publications,
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.460]   technical publications about firearms.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.020]   And of course, this could be extended to anything.
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.660]   This is a way of destroying the Second Amendment
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.500]   using the First Amendment.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.380]   And these are regulations that are being passed
[00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.620]   by the State Department.
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:44.460]   Stay with us.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.220]   In the next segment, Alex Jones is going to break this down.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.060]   Be right back.
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:05:01.740]   - Today's top stories for June 5th, 2015.
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.500]   TPP begins to unravel as Obama launches
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.780]   final push for votes.
[00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.780]   Article by Paul Joseph Watson,
[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.340]   the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade package
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.500]   is beginning to unravel with more prominent voices
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.420]   slamming President Obama and the Republican leadership
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.940]   over the secretive deal that threatens to cost American jobs
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.260]   and hand big corporations new powers
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.300]   that would violate national sovereignty.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.500]   Hunting for hackers,
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.140]   NSA secretly expands internet spying at US border.
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.620]   Article by New York Times,
[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.580]   without public notice or debate,
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.380]   the Obama administration has expanded
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.100]   the NSA's warrantless surveillance
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.660]   of Americans' international internet traffic
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.220]   according to a classified NSA document.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.700]   In mid-2012, Justice Department lawyers
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.380]   wrote two secret memos permitting the spy agency
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.620]   to begin hunting on internet cables without a warrant
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.060]   and on American soil for data linked
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.100]   to computer intrusions originating abroad.
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.340]   You can find more reports like this at Infowars.com.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:07.660]   - It was easier to control a million people, literally.
[00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.900]   It was easier to control a million people
[00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.140]   than physically to kill a million people.
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.620]   Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.340]   than to control a million people.
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.380]   - This is an emergency transmission
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.620]   from FEMA Region 6 in Occupy North America.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.620]   - The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.020]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:07:01.540]   - Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday,
[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.820]   the seventh day of June, 2015.
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.060]   This is an emergency report dealing
[00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.260]   not just with the Second Amendment,
[00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.380]   but with every basic human liberty
[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.740]   that is now under open, naked attack.
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.340]   Again, ladies and gentlemen, this is a live radio broadcast.
[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.540]   We're going to be throwing it in a moment
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.660]   to David Knight, who is live in studio in Austin, Texas,
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.580]   co-hosting with me the Sunday syndicated transmission.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.620]   We'll also post this emergency alert to YouTube as well,
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.180]   and we're begging everyone out there
[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:40.180]   to please go to Infowars.com, click on the article,
[00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.420]   go to the NRA website and see this for yourself.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:47.260]   Remember last year, Cody Wilson, fellow Austinite,
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:53.900]   developed a 3D printable gun, an AR-15,
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.380]   and the feds came after him and said,
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.980]   "You can't put a file out, just digital information
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:04.140]   "on how to build that, or we're gonna indict you."
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.460]   And we warned then that the feds were going to claim
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.820]   that basically any type of written information
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.780]   about reloading, about how to fix any type of firearm,
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.860]   you name it, would be basically seen
[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.180]   as the anarchist cookbook,
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:19.340]   and that information itself was terrorist.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.740]   This is prior restraint.
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:24.180]   Well, now the NRA, who's very conservative
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.820]   and always very slow to act,
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.660]   has come out from their hill contacts,
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.460]   and Obama's promised a raft of executive powers
[00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.100]   outside of law to restrict the Second Amendment,
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.460]   they've now come out, stories on Infowars.com,
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.780]   and announced they're coming after the Second Amendment,
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.660]   not just with ammo restrictions,
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:43.340]   not just with the attempt that they've been announcing
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.820]   to ban some of the 5.56 ammo,
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.420]   but no, now they're saying they're going
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.580]   after the literature, everything,
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.460]   and that you'll have to get permission
[00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:56.260]   before you communicate about guns, period, on the internet.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.660]   They've also announced in two different
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.660]   congressional hearings that they wanna bring back
[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.780]   the quote, "fairness doctrine,"
[00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.020]   kinda like the USA Freedom Act, it's a horrible name,
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:06.340]   it's very Orwellian, the fairness doctrine
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.100]   to not let people on talk radio or print
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.460]   actually say their political views.
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.540]   You're like, that'll never happen, really, until 1987,
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:17.980]   when Bruce Fine, head counsel of the FCC, got rid of it.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.940]   Our guest Bruce Fine, until that was done,
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.060]   talk radio didn't even exist.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.140]   So we're going into this, the internet kill switch,
[00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.180]   the FCC takeover of the web,
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.900]   they've had Zuckerberg, Facebook,
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.700]   meeting with the Communist Chinese in the US
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.180]   how to do this, it's in the TPP, that part's been leaked.
[00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.660]   The borders are open without any type of law,
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:43.100]   the power plants are being shut off outside of law,
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.460]   they're just power grabbing.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.780]   Michelle Obama tells our kids
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.500]   what to eat in schools outside of law,
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.700]   and if the schools don't follow it,
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.900]   they're fined outside of law.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.780]   They just do whatever they want.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.100]   Here's the article on Infowars.com,
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.780]   absolutely critically important,
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.260]   NRA gun blogs, videos, web forums,
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.620]   threatened by new Obama regulation.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.100]   When you read the article by the Washington Examiner,
[00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:12.100]   it links to the NRA story at the NRA website,
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.460]   breaking it down to the announcement,
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.060]   June 3rd, took us four or five days
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:20.060]   to find out about this, Federal Register.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.660]   And that is where they are announcing it.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.100]   So they just publish things in the Federal Register,
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.020]   they just do whatever they want in everyone's face.
[00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.860]   But notice, if you go to Infowars.com,
[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.740]   or even mainstream media websites,
[00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:38.180]   it's the same story over and over again.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.740]   Rand Paul demands White House
[00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.220]   release trade deal text immediately.
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.260]   See, again, dictatorial centralized power,
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.940]   outside of law, just doing whatever they want.
[00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.500]   And thank God Rand Paul is saying,
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.540]   no, you must release it, I demand you do it.
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.980]   That's what a statesman would do.
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.180]   No one else even dares do that.
[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.140]   Obama on his amnesty.
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.460]   The law is on our side.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.500]   When he said he quote, changed the law.
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.220]   No, Congress never passed the amnesty,
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.100]   he's done it by executive fiat.
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:12.540]   So it's more deception, over and over and over again.
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.500]   Let's continue.
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:17.260]   Now, Joint Chiefs Chairman Dempsey says,
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.740]   Putin intends to undermine Ukraine and NATO,
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.780]   when clearly, you can say what you want
[00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.900]   about Russian corruption, it's certainly there.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.620]   The West is on their border, messing with them.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.540]   So again, it's all part of this lawlessness.
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:36.460]   All part of this recklessness by the elite we have here.
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:39.980]   And Obama has previously promised
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.780]   at least 16 different initiatives
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.020]   to go after the Second Amendment.
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.580]   They're now saying they're just gonna put anybody
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:48.740]   who's ever been to a psychologist, basically,
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.620]   and ever claimed insurance on it,
[00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.500]   they're gonna claim you have a disability
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.180]   and restrict buying guns,
[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.220]   then they're gonna make you turn them in.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.020]   This is already being selectively tested
[00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.020]   in states like California and New York.
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.740]   So the establishment is making their move
[00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.340]   to sew up the United States and consolidate total control.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.060]   If people don't get upset about this outrageous move
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:17.180]   that the feds are now saying in a comment period,
[00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.420]   oh yeah, we're getting ready to,
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.020]   I mean, if you go to Barnes and Noble,
[00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.260]   it's reloading magazines, designs of guns,
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.900]   how to fix them, they're saying,
[00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.900]   no, no, no, you can't have those.
[00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.540]   And I remember the old timers always saying,
[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.380]   when they start going after gun manuals,
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.300]   when they start going after gun technicals,
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.140]   when they start trying to restrict that,
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.500]   get ready, they're coming after the guns in general.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.100]   They're trying to kill the Second Amendment,
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.380]   right to keep and bear arms.
[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.660]   Culture, I'm gonna throw it now live
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.540]   to David Knight in the studio,
[00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:45.020]   and I'm gonna be back at the bottom of the hour
[00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.660]   with a very important message and information
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.500]   on the agenda of Bilderberg 2015.
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.180]   Then I'll be back at the end to get more into TPP.
[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.700]   But all of this connects together,
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.980]   centralized dictatorial power
[00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.420]   where arbitrary, tyrannical groups
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.420]   can do whatever they want whenever they want.
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.220]   All right, we take you now to the Infowars.com
[00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.300]   news studios and David Knight.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.100]   - And that article that Alex was talking about
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.460]   on Infowars.com is the NRA says that gun blogs,
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:18.340]   videos, web forums are threatened by new Obama regulation.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.580]   They say gunsmiths, manufacturers, reloaders,
[00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.260]   do-it-yourselfers could all find themselves muzzled.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:25.660]   And here's the deal.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.940]   This is all regulations being put out
[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.420]   by the State Department,
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.300]   regulations that would govern international arms sales,
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.140]   they say.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.620]   So because this is something that's going across
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.740]   international lines, and because of course,
[00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.380]   the internet is international,
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.700]   they would come after the internet.
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.580]   They say that any technical violations of this,
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:48.540]   people would face up to $1 million and 20 years in jail.
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.180]   That's how draconian these regulations are.
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.860]   Think about how they're coming after us
[00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.940]   just in this one area.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:57.860]   Look at the UN Arms Trade Treaty.
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.420]   Look at the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:03.980]   These are all things that can be used to stifle,
[00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.820]   to control firearms.
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:09.020]   We also have the FCC and the State Department
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.380]   then coming after the internet, after free speech,
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.500]   after technical information.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.620]   Understand that the UN Arms Trade Treaty,
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.020]   they put that together.
[00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:19.740]   It was admitted by the New York Times
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:23.420]   that Fast and Furious was a false flag attack
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.620]   designed to discredit the Second Amendment.
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.980]   And of course, what did Fast and Furious involve?
[00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.540]   It involved shipping arms across the border
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.580]   between the United States and Mexico.
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.980]   That was supposed to justify the UN Arms Trade Treaty
[00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:37.900]   for the American people.
[00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.540]   That was going to be their false flag.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:44.060]   Instead, when a federal agent got killed in this,
[00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.140]   and it blew up in their face, that was discredited.
[00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:50.140]   So they have tried to push this through in various ways.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.260]   Many people believe that they will push it through.
[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.460]   Perhaps might be part of these trade partnerships,
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.020]   the Transatlantic, the Trans-Pacific Partnerships.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.820]   That might include restrictions on it
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.140]   that they would then use to say,
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.260]   well, since we have to track the flow of firearms
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.980]   across borders by treaty,
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:11.060]   that means we have to get all this information about you,
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:12.780]   about your firearms.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.460]   We have to create this database
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.260]   so that we can do our work and enforce this treaty.
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.020]   That's the rationale that they would use for that.
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.380]   Now, of course, if this isn't in the Trans-Pacific
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.780]   or Transatlantic Partnerships,
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.740]   understand that it can be added
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.820]   after these things have been passed.
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.820]   That's one of the things that's so outrageous
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.460]   about these partnership agreements,
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:38.020]   is that we cannot only not see it before it's passed,
[00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.420]   that the elected representatives of ours
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:42.660]   cannot modify it or amend it,
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.700]   but that it will be easily amended
[00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:48.540]   without any input from the Congress after it is passed.
[00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.420]   We have to pass it so that they can change it.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:52.620]   Stay with us, we're gonna be right back.
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:54.260]   We're gonna talk about Bilderberg
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.260]   as the root of these Trans-Pacific,
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.020]   Trans-Atlantic Partnerships.
[00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.100]   - Alex Jones here with an Infowarslife.com
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.860]   Consumer Alert Report.
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.900]   Many of you are aware that around the world,
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:10.420]   most populations are woefully deficient
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:12.300]   in clean forms of iodine.
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:15.860]   The good news is, our listeners over the past two years
[00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:20.420]   tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:23.580]   The bad news is, for the first time in more than a year,
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.020]   supplies at Infowarslife.com
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.420]   of survival shield X2 nascent iodine are running low.
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.260]   But what's even more serious
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.180]   is the supply of these deep earth crystals.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:38.940]   That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary
[00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.540]   and only available to Infowarslife.com.
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.700]   And that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.220]   That's why it's more important than ever
[00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.780]   to secure your current and long time supply
[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.620]   of survival shield nascent iodine X2 today.

[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.460]   Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:02.940]   you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.980]   as sponsors on my syndicated radio show
[00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.900]   or the nightly news or the news website, Infowars.com.
[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.380]   Because the companies I've been approached by
[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.540]   were not the highest quality
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.820]   and they weren't as affordable as they should be.
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.540]   So I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.380]   over the years.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.140]   Well, then about six months ago,
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.620]   we get contacted by Head Down Firearms, HDfirearms.com.

[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:12.500]   (upbeat music)
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.020]   Crashing through the lies and disinformation,
[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:21.020]   it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.720]   (upbeat music)
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.340]   Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.180]   I'm David Knight.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.020]   I'm co-hosting today with Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.300]   In the last segment, he was talking
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.460]   about the new firearms regulations
[00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:37.880]   that the NRA has pointed out the State Department
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.220]   is trying to make law that would essentially
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.100]   restrict not only the Second Amendment,
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.220]   but also the First Amendment.
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.020]   Putting in penalties up to 20 years in prison,
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.260]   $1 million fines because you publish technical details
[00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.540]   about firearms or other things.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.820]   In the past, what they have done is they gave an exclusion
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.400]   to things that were in the public domain.
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.020]   And so it begs the question as to how they are going
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.060]   to define that.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.500]   And it's a very complicated discussion there,
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.240]   but the NRA is concerned about it.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.940]   We should all be concerned about this.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.780]   We have seen multiple ways that this administration,
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.300]   and of course the one before it,
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:17.380]   is coming after the internet freedoms that we enjoy,
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.180]   as well as our international sovereignty
[00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.280]   is now on the line.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.940]   Just as we saw with the implementation of NAFTA.
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:27.920]   It was very important for them to get that done
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.640]   under a Democrat president.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.400]   They got it done under Clinton.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.720]   It's very important for them to get this done under Obama
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.600]   because so many people who will just march in lockstep
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.700]   behind that, the camp followers of the Democratic Party,
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.040]   who might be concerned about this,
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:46.140]   because on the surface it looks like,
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.920]   and this is the way they're selling it on the surface,
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.600]   to get it to pass the scrutiny of people
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.920]   who aren't really paying attention.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.480]   They're saying, well, this is just about free trade.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.800]   So this is something between the free traders
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:21:59.600]   and people who are pro-business
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.160]   and people who are the unions.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.560]   And so that's how they play it to the people
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.400]   who are captive in this very simplistic
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.920]   two-party perspective that they offer to people.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.120]   But there is far, far more to this.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.840]   We're gonna talk about the history
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.240]   of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.760]   And of course you cannot talk about the history
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.320]   of the Trans-Pacific Partnership
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.520]   without talking about Bilderberg.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.520]   Alex Jones is gonna break that down in the next segment.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.920]   He's gonna give us some background on it.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.120]   Of course we have reporters who are traveling now
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.640]   on their way to Bilderberg coming up this next week.
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.160]   We have Paul Joseph Watson, Rob Dew, Josh Owens
[00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.240]   are all going to be in Austria this next week
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.800]   covering the Bilderberg group,
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.720]   something that for many decades
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.760]   they pretended did not even exist.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:46.800]   Well into the '90s, if you talked about Bilderberg,
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.920]   you were laughed at as being a conspiracy theorist.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.160]   We now know that Bilderberg, going back to
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.880]   its very beginning, the very first few meetings,
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.440]   they were working on creating a European Union
[00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.920]   and a euro currency.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:05.880]   That's the way they move to global governance
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:10.040]   is through this gradual process that is going on there.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.920]   Now we're in the later stages of consolidation.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.600]   Some of these organizations have been exposed.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.960]   We're going to be following who is showing up
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.600]   at the Bilderberg conference.
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.880]   But of course right now in Austria,
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.560]   not too far from where the Bilderberg conference
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:26.840]   is going to be held, they have the G7 meetings going on.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.760]   And the people that are there are very concerned
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:33.160]   about the Transatlantic Partnership, the TTIP.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:38.200]   The protesters at the G7 summit in Garmisch, Austria,
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:42.880]   in Bavaria are upset about what they see
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.920]   as being a sellout, rightfully so, a sellout of sovereignty.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.760]   Here's some of the quotes.
[00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.320]   This is a story on "The Guardian" by Charlie Skelton.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.640]   Of course, he is the one who covers Bilderberg
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.480]   for "The Guardian."
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.560]   We saw him there last year in Copenhagen.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.000]   A very good writer.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.840]   This is what he says.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.560]   He says, "A helicopter came and hovered directly over us
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.420]   "for about five minutes, presumably because they thought
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.380]   "someone on the march had brought along
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.120]   "a thermonuclear device."
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:09.700]   He says, "They're talking about this being
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.720]   "the largest police operation in the history of Bavaria."
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.160]   He said, "It was too loud to speak."
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.840]   He said, "There were so many helicopters
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:18.080]   "hovering over us right now."
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.560]   He says, "I keep expecting to hear 'Riot of the Valkyries'
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.880]   "referring to apocalypse now."
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.120]   "I don't know exactly what they're all doing up there.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.600]   "I hope they're trying to avoid each other."
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.000]   And then he quotes a journalist from Der Spiegel,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.480]   says that it is the largest police operation
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.320]   in the history of Bavaria.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.600]   And he goes on to say, "Such a huge display
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.920]   "of power like this, I'm afraid people feel
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   "that it's a provocation."
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:42.960]   Precisely, that's exactly what it is
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.040]   when they put up a massive police presence.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.080]   So if you look at that picture on there,
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.600]   if you pull that picture up for the article,
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:52.440]   you can see a few protesters flanked by an army of cops
[00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.040]   escorting them as they're marching.
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.860]   And so, Skelton goes on and says, "It feels a bit weird.
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.660]   "There could not actually be any more police in Garmisch
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.940]   "than there are right now.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.280]   "There wouldn't be room."
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.360]   He says, "There's traffic jams of police vehicles.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.560]   "Every spare inch of tarmac has been commandeered
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.600]   "for police coaches, riot vans, operations trucks.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.300]   "The only cars on the road that aren't police cars
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.680]   "are being driven by Plains Cove's policemen."
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.240]   And he goes on to say, "It's a show of political power."
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.560]   This is a 16-year-old student who is wide awake.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.800]   He said, "This is a show of political power,
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.360]   "but it is also a suppression of political protest.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.200]   "People have been stopped at checkpoints for so long,
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.440]   "for hours at a time, that it's really difficult
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.240]   "simply to show up here.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.560]   "But that's all that we can do in this situation
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.880]   "is to show up."
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.160]   Essentially, that's what Bilderberg is about.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.700]   We can't get into the meetings.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.200]   They hide it, they keep it in secret,
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.400]   just like they do the G7.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.920]   Unlike the G7, where you've got heads of state meeting,
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.940]   we have heads of state, we have corporations meeting,
[00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.720]   we have intelligence agencies meeting,
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.000]   and Bilderberg, like they have for decades.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.500]   And of course, we're not allowed to see what happens there.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:02.040]   The best we can do is try to ascertain who is there.
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.180]   In the last year or so, they have published an agenda,
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.760]   but we don't know if that's true.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.000]   We have no way to verify that.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.320]   We just have to take their word for it.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.600]   But then, Skelton goes on to ask in his article,
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.920]   he says, "But what made this 16-year-old show up today?"
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:17.280]   And the 16-year-old said, "It's the TTIP."
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.520]   That's the European version,
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.640]   the Transatlantic Partnership.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.880]   He says, "This was the word that was on everyone's lips,
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.960]   "everyone's placards, both young and old.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.640]   "The hikers were from across the political spectrum,
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.140]   "from anarcho-syndicalists and libertarians
[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.720]   "through the Greens to the Communists.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.140]   "But everybody was concerned about the TTIP trade deal.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.760]   "It seemed to be the one issue that gave focus
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.640]   "to this vast ideological sprawl."
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.080]   And so then he talked to a guy now,
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.840]   first he talks to a 16-year-old,
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.680]   then he talks to a 61-year-old,
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.920]   and he says, the 61-year-old says,
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.400]   "They are global companies with global power.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.080]   "But today we're told over and over again
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.900]   "that globalism is good.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.600]   "Yeah, it's good for a few.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.620]   "Yes, it is very good for those very few," he chuckled.
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:03.680]   "To call yourself a globalist,
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.200]   "you would have to be either very stupid
[00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.420]   "or very, very rich.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.340]   "Or perhaps you'd have to be very apathetic."
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.880]   You know, as we look at some of the stories
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.040]   that came up towards the end of the week last week,
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.640]   and we'll talk about this a little bit more,
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.040]   when I look at what happened
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.720]   with the Gaia Democratic School
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.840]   where they took some very young children
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.220]   to a pornography shop on a field trip,
[00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.760]   it reminded me of Brave New World.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.880]   And I think the real key that we see here,
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.080]   certainly in this particular case
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.280]   that's going on with the G7 right now,
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.160]   I think the vast majority of the population
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.840]   is subdued by a kind of Brave New World approach.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.720]   Something that comes at them
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.600]   and essentially celebrates promiscuity,
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.640]   makes a virtue of it, that distracts people,
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.000]   that says you can have all the sex that you want,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.240]   but you can't have a family, we don't want parents.
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.800]   And that's the society that we're moving to.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.480]   It's not something that started with Brave New World.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.280]   Of course, it goes back all the way to Plato's Republic.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.680]   That was the formula that he had for control.
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:16.360]   But I think that the vast majority of the public
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:20.280]   is distracted by this pleasure, by the drugs,
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.240]   by the sex that we are offered.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.520]   And so they're not paying attention.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.100]   The few people who do pay attention,
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.800]   like this 16-year-old, like the 61-year-old,
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:32.720]   who understand exactly what's going on
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.280]   with this trans-Pacific partnership,
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.640]   those who understand, who show up, what do they get?
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.360]   They get the 1984 treatment.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:46.360]   And so our government has to exercise 1984 surveillance
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:49.680]   on all of us to determine who's going to get the fist,
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.760]   the iron fist, the boot stomping in their face.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.080]   Stay with us, when we come right back,
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.200]   Alex Jones is gonna break down Vildaberg for you.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.200]   We'll be right back.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.880]   - Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.840]   firearms manufacturers as sponsors
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.120]   on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.160]   or the news website, infowars.com.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.680]   Because the companies I've been approached by
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.800]   were not the highest quality
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:15.080]   and they weren't as affordable as they should be.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.800]   So I refused probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.640]   over the years.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.400]   Well, then about six months ago,
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:25.880]   we get contacted by Head Down Firearms, HDfirearms.com.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.160]   Own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs,
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.960]   special ops people, they're veterans, they're patriots,
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.560]   they're listeners of the radio show,
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:34.400]   and they wanna support the broadcast.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.000]   It's always about security, whether it's for yourself,
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.360]   your wife, your loved ones.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.720]   Go to their website, HDfirearms.com.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.040]   Buy right off their website,
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.160]   and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer of your choice.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.600]   You can pick it up at the gun show,
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.520]   you can pick it up at the local sporting goods store,
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.880]   whatever you do, get your Head Down firearm today.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:57.400]   The spirit of 1776 lives at Head Down Firearms,
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.720]   HDfirearms.com.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.160]   Introducing Secret 12, the new Info Wars life,
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.840]   vitamin B12 formulation.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:08.240]   Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical grade,
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.040]   bioavailable coenzyme forms of B12,
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.960]   methocobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections,
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.760]   and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.720]   Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth,
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.320]   right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.280]   No needles, no injections.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:24.560]   Secure your revolutionary Secret 12 formula right now

[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.680]   Alex Jones here.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:32.440]   For the last two years, I've been working
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.000]   with top doctors, nutritionists, and chemists
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.520]   to design a nutraceutical formulation
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.880]   that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.280]   Introducing the all-new
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.680]   Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.800]   Experience the benefits of combining over 14 ancient herbs
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.440]   and extracts with exciting new advances
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.040]   in nutraceutical science.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   Visit InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.480]   That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.320]   - Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.160]   - Good, brother.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.880]   I recently started using your products.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.600]   Everything you said about them is correct.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.840]   Me and my wife both use a lot of them,
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.760]   and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.600]   - Well, thank you, brother,
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.280]   'cause it also funds our operation,
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.560]   but doing that, I know I've gotta have the highest quality.
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.000]   Super Male Vitality was developed
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.600]   to activate your body's own natural processes
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.960]   instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.120]   - We do the Super Male and the Super Female Vitality.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.640]   Big changes, a lot of energy.
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.720]   We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.200]   They've been telling money there.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:34.040]   - Sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.840]   harvested around the planet,
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.200]   and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.320]   They wanna stun and dumb down,
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.720]   and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while,
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.640]   but then burn you out, in my experience,
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.320]   whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.400]   goes right to the source.
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.200]   So it's pretty exciting, and I love it.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.680]   Visit InfoWarsLife.com today
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:55.720]   to secure your Super Male Vitality
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.400]   and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.680]   - Alex Jones here with InfoWarsLife.com
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.480]   Consumer Alert Report.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.520]   Many of you are aware that around the world,
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.000]   most populations are woefully deficient
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.880]   in clean forms of iodine.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.440]   The good news is our listeners over the past two years
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.000]   tried X2 nascent iodine and experienced it for themselves.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.160]   The bad news is for the first time in more than a year,
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:25.640]   supplies at InfoWarsLife.com
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.000]   of Survival Shield X2 nascent iodine are running low.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.880]   But what's even more serious
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.760]   is the supply of these deep earth crystals.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:38.520]   That exclusive 999 pure source is proprietary
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.120]   and only available to InfoWarsLife.com,
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.280]   and that supply is running low and is in question.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.800]   That's why it's more important than ever
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.400]   to secure your current and long-time supply
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.200]   of Survival Shield nascent iodine X2 today.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.200]   Available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.640]   or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:18.640]   Bilderberg, 2015.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.640]   You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   We must be cautious in Austria.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.640]   (explosion)
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.640]   (roaring)
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.640]   (roaring)
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.640]   (roaring)
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:35.640]   (roaring)
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.640]   with a special announcement for all InfoWars.com
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.640]   viewers and readers.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.640]   Bilderberg, 2015, is gonna be one of the most important
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.640]   Bilderberg events that's ever been covered by the press.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.640]   It is the Bilderberg group that represents
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   the global corporate fascist shadow government.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.640]   That is establishing a planetary regime right now.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.640]   They're behind the EU in their own annals.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.640]   They're behind the North American Union
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.640]   and now the Asian Union known as the TPP.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.640]   They don't want to be identified.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.640]   They don't want press coverage.
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.640]   Until 10 years ago, the media wouldn't even admit they existed.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:17.640]   But alternative media, the people's media,
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:19.640]   you, the viewers of this show and others,
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.640]   helped expose it.
[00:34:21.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   It's so exciting.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:25.640]   And now there's a real debate about TPP.
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.640]   Now there is a real debate about these shadow groups
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   and organizations.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.640]   Now people are saying, "What do you mean there's global treaties
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.640]   that are secret that curtail the internet freedom
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:41.640]   and have global carbon taxes and erase national sovereignty
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:45.640]   and set laws for our Congress and parliaments?"
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.640]   That's why they always denied corporate global government
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.640]   because the minute it's exposed
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:53.640]   and the minute we begin to discuss it,
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.640]   it begins to implode.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:57.640]   In fact, look at two articles that just came out.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:00.640]   In the BBC and Associated Press, there's hundreds of others,
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.640]   where the UKIP party, that's basically a Ron Paul,
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.640]   Patriot, Alex Jones party in Europe and England
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.640]   with Lord Monckton and Nigel Farage,
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.640]   has forced the Tory party to say,
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:13.640]   "We're going to move to get out of the EU
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.640]   if they don't let the UK make its own laws."
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.640]   England never got to vote.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.640]   The UK never got to vote
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.640]   to be part of the euro.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.640]   They just called it a trade deal
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:26.640]   like the TPP, like NAFTA, like GATT.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.640]   So these are very exciting developments.
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.640]   Bilderberg doesn't want to be covered.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.640]   Normally, they only shut the hotel down a day before
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.640]   when they have it in different parts of the world.
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.640]   This time it shut down a whole week before.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:40.640]   And Rob Doo, Paul Watson, Josh Owens,
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.640]   they're all going to be there Sunday
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.640]   through the Sunday afterwards.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   Coming up from the 8th, that Monday,
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.640]   right through Bilderberg,
[00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.640]   covering it live on the ground for us.
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.640]   The police and military and others
[00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.640]   are shaking people down, grabbing their IDs.
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:58.640]   They're already harassing hikers and skiers.
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.640]   This is already going on
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.640]   because the Bilderberg group is scared.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.640]   Royalty, world leaders, Rothschilds, Rockefellers,
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   the heads of Google, Microsoft,
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.640]   the Defense Department, Prime Ministers,
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:12.640]   they're all going to be there
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.640]   with Henry Kissinger and others.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.640]   And they just hope we all go to sleep
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.640]   and not know what they were doing.
[00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.640]   We're going to be there exposing it
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.640]   and pointing out that this is exactly
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.640]   the very type of organization and group
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:27.640]   that is staying in the shadows
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.640]   so they can engineer things like the TPP.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   Are there other globalist organizations? Yes.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   But if they're all chaired and run
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.640]   by the very same 150 Bilderberg group members
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.640]   and their guests.
[00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.640]   And so we're focusing in on what the dinosaur
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.640]   corporate media hopes you won't look at,
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.640]   hopes you won't investigate,
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.640]   because sunshine will destroy
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:53.640]   these political vampires.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.640]   So join us at Infowars.com/show
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:01.640]   where the radio show and TV show weekdays
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.640]   is free streaming.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.640]   Also, we're going to have the nightly news free,
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   not just for subscribers, all next week
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.640]   for seven days straight.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.640]   We'll also have reporting on Saturday.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.640]   It starts the 8th and it runs right through
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   for seven days.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.640]   We'll see if they try to stop our reporters
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:20.640]   even getting into Austria.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.640]   That's happened before in England.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.640]   It's happened in Canada.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.640]   Reporters have been shot at in places
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.640]   like Lisbon, Portugal.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.640]   I mean, this is a big deal.
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.640]   This is Spectre. This is Hydra.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.640]   These are the bad guys that are behind
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.640]   the derivatives, the central banks,
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:39.640]   the wars, the funding of ISIS.
[00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.640]   These crooks do not want you watching.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:45.640]   So get the free link at Infowars.com/show
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.640]   that we'll put below us here on this video
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.640]   and story, and send it out to friends and family.
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.640]   Post it on Facebook. Send it out on Twitter.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.640]   Sign off on your emails with it
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.640]   and be part of the Infowar,
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.640]   because you, the viewers, don't stand
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.640]   in front of us or beside us or behind us.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.640]   You stand at the heart of the human awakening
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.640]   worldwide, whether you be black, white,
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   old, young, from Germany, from China,
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.640]   from Mexico, from Canada, from the United States,
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:12.640]   from Austria, from South Africa,
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.640]   or from Libya. It doesn't matter.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:17.640]   Humans want freedom.
[00:38:17.640 --> 00:38:19.640]   We want a level playing field,
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.640]   and we're exposing the global corporate
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   robber baron kingpins.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   So hammer this info out,
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.640]   and hundreds of millions more worldwide
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.640]   will learn the truth about who really
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:31.640]   governs the planet.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.640]   If we just look at the politicians and front men,
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.640]   they'll just replace them like deck chairs
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.640]   on the Titanic.
[00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.640]   If we just look at who is pulling the strings,
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.640]   who's orchestrating it, and who's controlling it.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:43.640]   Alright, well, that's it for this
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.640]   special emergency transmission.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:47.640]   You are the modern Paul Reveres.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.640]   Get this information out to everybody you know,
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.640]   and we are literally going to see the fall
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.640]   of Bilderberg, the fall of the EU,
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.640]   the fall of this global tyranny,
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.640]   right as they try to launch it off the ground.
[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.640]   Because this is the point where the tyranny
[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.640]   emerges when the world government
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.640]   is announced, after all the denial,
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:06.640]   they're trying to bring down freedom,
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.640]   shut down web freedom right now.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.640]   Now is the time to expose them.
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.640]   They're at their weakest, right as they spread their wings.
[00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.640]   I'm Alex Jones signing off, and never forget,
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   if you're watching this transmission,
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.640]   you are the resistance.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.640]   Alright, and as Alex Jones just pointed out,
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.640]   we're going to be sending reporters,
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.640]   Paul Joseph Watson, Rob Due, and Josh Owens,
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.640]   to Bilderberg. They're on their way right now.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.640]   We're going to have a report, an update,
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.640]   from Rob Due in the next segment,
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:33.640]   giving us an update at the airport,
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.640]   how things are going, because we typically
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:37.640]   run into a lot of, just maybe
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.640]   coincidental travel problems when we go
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.640]   to Bilderberg, it seems like. We had
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:43.640]   more than our share of them last year,
[00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.640]   with things being cancelled on us,
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.640]   car reservations and so forth.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.640]   Very strange.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.640]   But anyway, we're going to have a report from Rob Due
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.640]   at the airport. Support us this next week.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.640]   We're going to be, as Alex Jones pointed out,
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.640]   broadcasting the Nightly News
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.640]   live. That's normally a subscription
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.640]   service. We do make it available
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.640]   the day after on YouTube. You can see it
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.640]   with YouTube subscriptions, but if you
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.640]   subscribe to Prison Planet and support
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.640]   us with your paid subscription
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.640]   there, that's something you can share with
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.640]   20 people each night.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.640]   But this week, it's going to be available for free.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.640]   So it's going to cost a lot of money for that
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.640]   bandwidth. It also costs a lot of money to send
[00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.640]   these reporters there. Support us in this effort.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.640]   If you're not going to get a subscription,
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.640]   support your health at
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.640]   Infowarslife.com.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.640]   We have a special this week. It's

[00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:35.640]   X2. Now of course, with
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.640]   everything that's going on, you
[00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.640]   need a few drops of this just to get
[00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.640]   a powerful dose of a key, essential
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.640]   nutrient, iodine. And of course,
[00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.640]   it's in one of the best forms you can find
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.640]   the iodine, nascent iodine. And our
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.640]   X2 iodine comes from
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:51.640]   thousands of feet within the Earth.
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.640]   We run radiation tests before we even
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:55.640]   accept the pure, raw iodine.
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.640]   It's now time to get prepared to have
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.640]   something in your medicine closet for yourself
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:01.640]   as well as for your everyday health
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.640]   as a supplement. Survival Shield

[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   I take it every day. My family takes
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.640]   it every day. Secure yours at Infowarslife.com.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.640]   Now as Alex was pointing out with Bilderberg,
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.640]   we're going to take a look, as I said in the
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:17.640]   next segment, we're going to have an update from
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:19.640]   Rob Dew as to the travel arrangements, as to
[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.640]   what's going on with them. But I want to take a look
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.640]   also at the origin
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.640]   and the history of Bilderberg.
[00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.640]   You know, last year marked the 60th
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.640]   anniversary of the first meeting
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.640]   of the Bilderberg Group. This year
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:33.640]   marks the 60th anniversary
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.640]   of their plans to create
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.640]   the European Union and the Euro
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.640]   currency. That's very important.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:41.640]   If we go back and look at an article that came out
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.640]   in 2009
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:45.640]   from Paul Joseph Watson, leaked
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.640]   1955 Bilderberg docs
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.640]   outline a plan for a
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.640]   single European currency.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.640]   And he points out the global elite spoke of the agenda
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.640]   to create the Euro nearly 40
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.640]   years before it was first codified
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.640]   in the 1992
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.640]   Maastricht Treaty. Now the interesting
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:03.640]   thing is they are calling it a European
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.640]   Union. They are calling it
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.640]   a treaty. We have achieved
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.640]   essentially a North American Union
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.640]   through a North American
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:13.640]   Free Trade Agreement.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.640]   They always like to make
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.640]   it a little bit more subversive for us.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.640]   I guess the Europeans are
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.640]   not quite as suspicious, but
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.640]   we do have a lot of people in America that
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:25.640]   are dumbed down enough, I guess, that they wouldn't understand
[00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.640]   the difference between a
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.640]   union and a trade treaty.
[00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.640]   But going back and looking
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   at the history of this, it's very
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:35.640]   interesting to see how they brought this
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.640]   in gradually. And of course, as Alex
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.640]   pointed out, the same people that had
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.640]   the Bilderberg had all these other different
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.640]   groups like the Trilateral Commission. We're going to talk about
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.640]   Zbigniew Brzezinski and how he outlined
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.640]   how they would move gradually
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.640]   to global governance when we come back. Stay with us.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:51.640]   We'll be right back.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.640]   [Music]
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:01.640]   Introducing Secret 12,

[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:07.640]   is a binary of
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.640]   nutrimedical grade, bioavailable
[00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:11.640]   coenzyme forms of B12.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.640]   Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.640]   injections, and adenosylcobalamin.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.640]   Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth,
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.640]   right on the tongue, and then swallowed.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.640]   No needles, no injections.

[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.640]   Alex Jones here. For the last two years
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:33.640]   I've been working with top doctors,
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.640]   nutritionists, and chemists to design
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.640]   a nutraceutical formulation
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.640]   that has truly life-changing health benefits.
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:41.640]   Introducing the all-new
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.640]   Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.

[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.640]   new advances in nutraceutical science.

[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.640]   Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.640]   you haven't really ever heard
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.640]   firearms manufacturers as sponsors
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.640]   on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.640]   or the news website InfoWars.com
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.640]   because the companies I've been approached
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.640]   by were not the highest
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.640]   quality and they weren't as affordable
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.640]   as they should be, so I refused
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.640]   probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   over the years. Well then,
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.640]   about six months ago, we get contacted
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:23.640]   by Head Down Firearms,

[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs,
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.640]   special ops people. They're veterans,
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.640]   they're patriots, they're listeners of the radio show,
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.640]   and they want to support the broadcast.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.640]   It's always about security, whether it's
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.640]   for yourself, your wife, your loved ones.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.640]   Go to their website, HDFirearms.com.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.640]   Buy right off their website,
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.640]   and they'll just send it to the FFL dealer
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:45.640]   of your choice. You can pick it up at the gun show,
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:47.640]   you can pick it up at a local sporting goods store,
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:49.640]   whatever you do, get
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:51.640]   your Head Down firearm

[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.640]   Another
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.640]   major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio,
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   where everybody in the entire city
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.640]   has been told not to drink the water.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.640]   Ohio's governor declaring a state of
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.640]   emergency. Did you know that the average
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.640]   person uses about 80 to 100
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   gallons of water at home
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.640]   every single day? If there's
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   a water emergency, will you be
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.640]   prepared? Panicked residents forming
[00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.640]   long lines throughout the day. We're here
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.640]   at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.640]   the shelves empty where water once
[00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:27.640]   was. To stay safe and healthy
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.640]   during a crisis, you must have
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:31.640]   access to safe, clean water.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.640]   Water which will not be available
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.640]   at your local grocery store. There's a
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:37.640]   mad dash on right now to stock up

[00:46:57.640 --> 00:47:03.640]   You're listening to the
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.640]   Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   [music]
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:19.640]   It's always a tough vote because
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   the average person thinks raising
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.640]   the debt ceiling must mean that we're running up
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.640]   our debt. Raising the debt ceiling,
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.640]   which has been done over a hundred times,
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.640]   does not increase
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.640]   our debt. It does not
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   somehow promote profitability.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   All it does is it says, "You've got to
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   pay the bills that you've already racked up, Congress."
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.640]   [music]
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:45.640]   You're listening to the Alex
[00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.640]   Jones Show.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:49.640]   [music]
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:53.640]   Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:55.640]   in studio. We've had Alex Jones
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.640]   popping in and co-hosting with
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.640]   me today. He also has a report that we're
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:01.640]   going to get to about the
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.640]   Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP.
[00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:05.640]   What's going on with that? Of course,
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:07.640]   a lot of people are starting to wake up and understand
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.640]   that we shouldn't have
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.640]   government conducted in secret.
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.640]   And that's precisely the
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.640]   fundamental issue about these so-called
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.640]   partnerships that are being negotiated right now.
[00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:19.640]   It's a total outrage.
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:21.640]   But this has been going on for a
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:23.640]   very long time. It's been going on for decades
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.640]   with groups like the Bilderberg
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.640]   Group. That's precisely
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.640]   the core problem with the Bilderberg
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.640]   Group. That they could meet secretly
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.640]   between government and corporations
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:35.640]   and the military and the
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.640]   intelligence services. That they could have these
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.640]   private meetings where we now know, looking
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.640]   at some of the documents that have
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.640]   come out, that they planned
[00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:45.640]   the European Union, the Euro
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.640]   single currency. Many other
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:49.640]   things that have come out, we understand,
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.640]   these are things that have been crafted together
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.640]   in secret by corporations working
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.640]   with government. The largest corporations
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.640]   working with government. It's no longer a conspiracy
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.640]   theory. It's pretty obvious
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.640]   what's going on now because we are in
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:03.640]   the final stages of what they've
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.640]   been working on for many, many decades.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.640]   Of course, the first Bilderberg meeting
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.640]   was 61 years ago.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:11.640]   60 years ago, they created
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.640]   the plan for the European Union
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.640]   and the Euro. Now, on the way to
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:17.640]   cover Bilderberg, we have
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.640]   Rob Dew and Josh Owens
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.640]   are headed out. He just filed
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.640]   a report about
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.640]   their trip at the airport, talking
[00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:27.640]   to people, see if they understand
[00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.640]   even now what's going on
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.640]   with the Bilderberg group. Here's that report.
[00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:35.640]   Rob Dew, reporting for
[00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:37.640]   Infowars.com. We are in O'Hare
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.640]   International Airport. We have about a three-hour layover
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.640]   before we get on the flight going to
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.640]   Austria. We're actually going to make a stop
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.640]   in Frankfurt, Germany and then head into Austria.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.640]   But, covering this year's
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.640]   Bilderberg. So, while
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.640]   we were here at three hours, had some time to
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.640]   think, I got to read a few articles.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:55.640]   There's one written by, or I guess
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.640]   co-written by Christine Jimenez
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   and she's talking about one of the people
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   who will be coming to this year's Bilderberg.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.640]   Eduardo Barraza, who
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.640]   is the Prime Minister of Portugal, who's
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.640]   also head of the steering committee.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.640]   Interestingly enough, he was invited to a couple
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.640]   Bilderberg meetings before
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.640]   he became Prime Minister. So, that's
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.640]   a theme we see a lot of these
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.640]   elites getting invited to these things.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.640]   They kind of get sniffed out to see if they're going to do what they're
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   told and then they get high position
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.640]   ships. He's also on the steering committee of Bilderberg
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.640]   and he was Prime Minister of Portugal.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.640]   Another thing
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:29.640]   that is really interesting is
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.640]   Alex is talking about how, like we're kind of
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.640]   ten years ahead of what normal people
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.640]   think. Not a lot of people know what Bilderberg is
[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:37.640]   and I bet I could ask anyone here
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.640]   what it is. In fact, I'm going to ask
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.640]   this fellow right here.
[00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:43.640]   Follow me over here. Hey, sir.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.640]   Do you know what the Bilderberg group is?
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.640]   No.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.640]   You've never heard of it? No.
[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.640]   What do you think it would be?
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:55.640]   A group of singers?
[00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.640]   That's pretty close. Let me tell you this.
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   It's a group of elites between
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.640]   120 and 150 that are going to get together
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.640]   in Austria this weekend, or this next week
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.640]   and discuss world policy, but they do it all in secret.
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:07.640]   Now, do you think if 150
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:09.640]   rock stars or movie stars got together somewhere
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:11.640]   there'd be press everywhere and people would be interested in it?
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:13.640]   I think so.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.640]   That's what's interesting about the Bilderberg group
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.640]   is it's total secrecy. They've got about 3,000
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:19.640]   cops that are going to guard this
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.640]   elite hotel in the middle of nowhere
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.640]   in the Austrian Alps.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:25.640]   Some of which, there's an elite commando group
[00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   called Cobra that will also be
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.640]   helping out with security. What do you think of that?
[00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:33.640]   What's his name have to do with anything, really?
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:35.640]   Cobra.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.640]   Well, because that was also the
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   arch enemy of G.I. Joe. I think it's very interesting that there's
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   an elite group of...
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.640]   They're also headquartered in a castle, which is also interesting.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.640]   But
[00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:47.640]   this is elected officials
[00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:49.640]   that go to this. Also
[00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.640]   billionaires, business owners,
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.640]   just really high-level people
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:55.640]   in Western Europe, the United States, and Canada
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.640]   get together. Some of our elected officials have been there.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.640]   Did you know Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.640]   actually went to it in 2012?
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.640]   No, I didn't know that.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.640]   Rick Perry's been to it as well, and I think he went
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   in Turkey back in 2007
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.640]   or 2008. I don't know who's Rick Perry.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.640]   Rick Perry was the governor of Texas for a long time.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.640]   He's also a presidential candidate.
[00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.640]   Where are you from?
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.640]   I'm from Ohio.
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.640]   Do you think an event like this,
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:21.640]   where you have 150 elites getting together
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.640]   in Western Europe, basically discussing things
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.640]   in secret, do you think we should know about this?
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.640]   I think so.
[00:52:27.640 --> 00:52:29.640]   I totally agree. Well, hey, thanks for your time.
[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.640]   Good luck to you. Have a good one.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.640]   All right, there you go. We asked a person here.
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.640]   He had no idea who the Bilderberg Group was,
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.640]   but what did we do? We educated him.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.640]   That's what I'm going to challenge you to do out there,
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:41.640]   is go out and make this the week that you talk about
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:43.640]   Bilderberg. I'm on a basketball team,
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.640]   and we went and had a couple beers
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.640]   last week after a game, and I told guys
[00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.640]   I'm not going to be making the next game and going to Austria.
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.640]   They're like, "What for?" I said, "I'm going to be covering the Bilderberg Group."
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:53.640]   And they all laughed. They go, "Bilderberg?
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:55.640]   No. See, that's why we have to get
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.640]   beyond this whole thing
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.640]   of what the name is. It's the
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.640]   Bilderberg Group, and you need to go out and talk
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.640]   to it. Talk about it. Tell your friends about it.
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.640]   Tell your neighbors about it. Just start
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.640]   opening the discourse,
[00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:09.640]   and that way, things like this
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.640]   will slowly start shedding light on them,
[00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   because that's what needs to happen. We need to stop having
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.640]   secret meetings run by elites where
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.640]   they're elected, they're using our tax dollars
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:19.640]   to pay for security, all this crazy madness,
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.640]   yet no press is allowed,
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:23.640]   or the press that is allowed is kept in control.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:25.640]   Well, that's about it. We're about to get on our
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.640]   flight. It's going to be a long one, so
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   I may not be as chipper next time you see me.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.640]   This is Rob Duh, reporting from O'Hare
[00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.640]   International Airport for Infowars.com and Infowars
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.640]   Nightly News.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.640]   Again, that's a very difficult trip to make,
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:39.640]   and of course, they're going to be on the ground
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.640]   and covering what's happening
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:43.640]   as soon as they get there. So it's a difficult
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.640]   thing for them. It's a difficult thing for us to
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.640]   support them. So again, if you want to support
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.640]   us in that operation,
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.640]   buy our products at InfowarsLife.com.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.640]   Also, we have the new T-shirt
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.640]   that is the
[00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.640]   Distress T-shirt, the Save America T-shirt,
[00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.640]   where you can tell people
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:02.640]   about the fourth, about Title
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.640]   4, Chapter 1 of the U.S.
[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.640]   Code regarding the flag.
[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:08.640]   Get them to understand
[00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:10.640]   that flying it upside down is not
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.640]   disrespect, it's actually
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:14.640]   trying to inform people. This is a way that you can
[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.640]   start to inform people about the distress
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:18.640]   that our government is currently under.
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:20.640]   Many people don't understand
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.640]   what's going on with
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.640]   these trade treaties, with the massive
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.640]   reorganization of
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:28.640]   our country and other countries into
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.640]   global governance. We've seen the pieces
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.640]   from Rex Jones, we've seen
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.640]   pieces from others where they go here
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.640]   in Austin or go in New York and they ask people
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.640]   what is the TPP? They have
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.640]   no clue what that is. They have no clue what
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:42.640]   Bilderberg is.
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.640]   These people who are protesting
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:46.640]   the G7 that's going on right now in Bavaria,
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.640]   not far from where the Bilderberg group is going to be
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:50.640]   meeting, and again, I had
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:52.640]   quotes from a 16-year-old,
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.640]   also from a 61-year-old.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.640]   They understood what the issue was.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.640]   I'm going to read you one more quote here from a guy
[00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:00.640]   who was a mathematician who showed up to protest.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.640]   And this is what he said. He said, "These
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.640]   secret trade agreements that are being negotiated
[00:55:04.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   by corporations without any
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.640]   oversight, without any knowledge
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   really of our elected representatives,
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.640]   this is all a question of legitimacy.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.640]   If laws and regulations
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.640]   are made and private,
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.640]   it limits the possibility of overseeing
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.640]   what the politicians do, obviously.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.640]   It seems the only people
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:24.640]   overseeing are those who stand
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.640]   to gain by the process.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.640]   Big business. This is what's been
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.640]   going on for a very long
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.640]   time at Bilderberg. And so
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.640]   it is no surprise to us
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.640]   to see that this is going to converge
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:38.640]   into a global
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:40.640]   governance now. Go back to the very
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.640]   beginning of Bilderberg. Why do they call it that?
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:44.640]   Well, that was the name of the hotel where they first met.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.640]   Interestingly enough,
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.640]   that hotel, the Bilderberg hotel,
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.640]   where they first met, was
[00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.640]   very close to the site of the last
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:54.640]   Nazi victory of World War II.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.640]   You might have seen the story of that
[00:55:56.640 --> 00:55:58.640]   in the movie "Bridge Too Far."
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.640]   Now, some people have
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.640]   alleged, have accused Prince Barnhart
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.640]   and others who created
[00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.640]   the Bilderberg group and who held that meeting
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:08.640]   at the closest
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.640]   they could get to the site of the last Nazi
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:12.640]   victory. Some people have accused them of
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.640]   being double agents, of collaborating
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.640]   with the Nazis to help in that
[00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:18.640]   last Nazi victory.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:20.640]   Nevertheless, what it did was it laid
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.640]   an economic foundation
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   for global governance.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.640]   And that's the way they do it gradually.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.640]   Going back to this article that I started
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:30.640]   talking about that is essentially
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.640]   six years and one month old from Paul Joseph
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.640]   Watson. Leaked 1955
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.640]   Bilderberg documents outline
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.640]   a plan for a single European
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.640]   currency. And he points out that
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.640]   the documents that they saw that were leaked
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:44.640]   by WikiLeaks from the 1955
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.640]   Bilderberg group conference that was
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:48.640]   held in Germany showed an agenda
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:50.640]   to create a European Union and
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.640]   a central European currency
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:54.640]   decades, decades before they
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.640]   were introduced. And so he points out
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.640]   that although they might have been talking
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.640]   about creating a
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   an economic trade
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.640]   group, he said the idea of doing
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.640]   a currency first appeared at
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.640]   Bilderberg. Even if you could say that they
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.640]   were responding to something that was out
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.640]   there already in terms of a
[00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.640]   European, a common trade area. But what it
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:16.640]   shows is that they moved gradually
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.640]   through a European Economic Commission
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:20.640]   then coming into
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:22.640]   the European community, then
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:24.640]   moving into the treaty. And
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:26.640]   now we see many people
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.640]   in Europe saying that the Greek
[00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.640]   financial tragedy is going
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.640]   to require a surrendering
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.640]   of sovereignty in order to make
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   the EU and the
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:38.640]   Euro work. Stay with us, we're going to be
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   right back. And we're going to go into more detail about
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.640]   this and the roots of these
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   transnational agreements.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.640]   We'll be right back.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   [Music]

[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.640]   We have rejected literally
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.640]   hundreds of products
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:06.640]   from the InfoWarsLife line because
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:08.640]   they are not of the very highest quality.
[00:59:08.640 --> 00:59:10.640]   Or because they're not 100%
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:12.640]   organic. Or because they don't pass
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:14.640]   all of the strictest toxicology
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.640]   tests there are that we have listed

[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.640]   that all of these products will
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:32.640]   blow you away like they've
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.640]   done the thousands of other customers
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.640]   that have visited InfoWarsLife.com
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.640]   and believed in us and tried the products.

[00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:50.640]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:52.640]   From his Central Texas Command Center
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.640]   deep behind enemy lines,
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.640]   the information war continues.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.640]   It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.640]   Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.640]   I'm Alex Jones.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.640]   I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.640]   I'm here to talk to you about
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.640]   the latest in the
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.640]   information war.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   We're going to talk about
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.640]   the latest in the
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.640]   information war.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.640]   Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:20.640]   I'm David Knight and I'm co-hosting today
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.640]   with Alex Jones. Alex is going to be
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:24.640]   joining us in this hour with a report
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.640]   about the TPP and the TTIP
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.640]   and the TPA.
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.640]   We've also got the TISA
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.640]   that came out this week.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.640]   Is that confusing?
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   It's meant to be confusing.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.640]   Here's what you need to know.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:40.640]   All of those together spell T-R-A-P.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.640]   It's a trap.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.640]   Quite frankly, it's a trap.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.640]   It's a trap that has been prepared
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.640]   for a very long time.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.640]   We were talking in the last hour about the roots of this,
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.640]   about the Bilderberg Group.
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.640]   Our reporters are headed there right now.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:56.640]   We just played a report in the last segment
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.640]   that is filed by Rob Dew
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:00.640]   in a layover at the airport.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:02.640]   Of course, they're on their way to Bilderberg.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.640]   As we see, most people don't know what Bilderberg is.
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.640]   Most people don't know what any of those
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   different acronyms are
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.640]   that are basically destroying
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.640]   the sovereignty, not only for the United States,
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.640]   but for the entire world.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.640]   These are all tools of global consolidation,
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.640]   tools of global governance
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.640]   by multinational corporations.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.640]   This is not about free trade.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.640]   This is not about protecting
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.640]   small corporations that are domestic.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.640]   This is about putting a few corporations
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.640]   who are writing these regulations in secret.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:32.640]   It's about putting them
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.640]   in charge of everything.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.640]   And it's not just simply
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:38.640]   about trade.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:40.640]   It's about owning everything.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.640]   And it's going to affect your health.
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.640]   It's going to affect your Internet freedoms.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.640]   It's going to affect
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.640]   the sovereignty of each individual nation.
[01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:50.640]   I want to cover a couple of stories
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:52.640]   before we go back to the Bilderberg Group
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.640]   because some of the people who listen to the show,
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.640]   some of them are covering news
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.640]   during this segment.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.640]   So I want to wait until all the radio stations are back.
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.640]   But I want to give you a sense of how,
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:04.640]   as they make what they do
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   more and more secret,
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   whether it's the Bilderberg Group or whether it's now
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   these new trade partnerships,
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.640]   everything is kept secret, but they demand
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.640]   to know everything about you.
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:16.640]   Look at this article from the Washington Post
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.640]   about the FBI.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.640]   Now, of course, we had the FBI's director,
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.640]   Comey, come out and say,
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.640]   "Well, you know, it's a good thing to have encryption,
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.640]   even though the government needs to have
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:28.640]   the ability to get around it," is what he said.
[01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.640]   So yeah, go ahead and encrypt your stuff, but not for the government.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:32.640]   Now we have the assistant director
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.640]   at the FBI's counterterrorism division,
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.640]   a man named Steinbach.
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.640]   And he came out with some very troubling,
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.640]   well, something that we already knew,
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.640]   quite frankly, but at least
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.640]   the candor is out there.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:46.640]   And I think even the Washington Post was a bit
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:48.640]   surprised, raised a little bit of an eyebrow
[01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:50.640]   when they reported this. They say, "FBI officials
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.640]   say companies should help us
[01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.640]   'prevent encryption above all else.'"
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.640]   That's what the FBI's
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.640]   assistant director for FBI counterterrorism said.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.640]   He says, "We need to build
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:02.640]   technological solutions
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.640]   to prevent encryption
[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.640]   above all else."
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.640]   In other words, their
[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.640]   highest priority
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:12.640]   is to be able to know
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.640]   everything, everything about you.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.640]   And we see this
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   manifested in many different ways.
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:20.640]   We see this with the dragnet surveillance
[01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.640]   of the NSA. We also see it even with
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.640]   what's going on with Jade Helm.
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.640]   Jade Helm is about mastering the human domain.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.640]   If you go back and look at what that
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:30.640]   phrase means, you see
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.640]   at conferences for
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.640]   the geospatial intelligence community
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.640]   where that is the title
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.640]   of the presentation, "Mastering the Human Domain."
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.640]   How do they propose to do that?
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.640]   They will master you as
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.640]   an individual by knowing
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:46.640]   everything about you individually,
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.640]   about your name, your identity,
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.640]   your biometrics, then knowing
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.640]   who you know, knowing where you
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.640]   go, what you do, and putting all of
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   those into a political context,
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.640]   putting them into a religious context,
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.640]   putting them into a racial
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.640]   context, profiling you
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:04.640]   in every way possible.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.640]   A very dangerous thing, but that
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.640]   is the plan. That is where they are
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.640]   going with all of this. Now, again, listen
[01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.640]   to this other quote from Steinbach. Again,
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.640]   he is the assistant director of FBI's
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:16.640]   counterterrorism. He says, "Privacy,
[01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:18.640]   if it's above all other things,
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.640]   including safety and freedom from terrorism,
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.640]   is not where we want to go."
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.640]   No, they absolutely
[01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.640]   don't want to go to privacy.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:28.640]   Go back and look at,
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:30.640]   since we're talking about
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.640]   consolidating the three different
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.640]   trade blocs of North America,
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.640]   Europe, and Asia, go back and
[01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.640]   look at the origins of all this.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.640]   That's what we're going to do in the next segment.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.640]   Of course, Zbigniew Brzezinski
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.640]   was the first director of the
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.640]   Trilateral Commission, another group like the
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:48.640]   Bilderberg Commission. It was based,
[01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:50.640]   his selection of this group that was
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.640]   founded by David Rockefeller, was based on
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:54.640]   the book that he wrote, "Between Two Ages."
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.640]   We're going to talk about how important it is
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.640]   to these people to know everything about you.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.640]   We'll be right back.
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:28.640]   [music]
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.640]   Alex Jones here. For the last two years,
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.640]   I've been working with top doctors,
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:34.640]   nutritionists, and chemists to design
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:36.640]   a nutraceutical formulation that
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.640]   has truly life-changing health benefits.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.640]   Introducing the all-new
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.640]   Ancient Defense Herbal Immunity Blend.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.640]   Experience the benefits of
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.640]   combining over 14 ancient herbs
[01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:48.640]   and extracts with exciting
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.640]   new advances in nutraceutical science.

[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.640]   [music]
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.640]   Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show
[01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.640]   on this Sunday, June 7, 2015.
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:48.640]   I am David Knight.
[01:06:48.640 --> 01:06:50.640]   Joining me today is Alex Jones.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.640]   He's going to be breaking down
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.640]   the Trans-Pacific Partnership for you
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:56.640]   in just a moment, but we're going
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.640]   to go back, before we go back to Alex,
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.640]   we're going to talk a little bit more
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.640]   about the history of the Bilderberg Group
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.640]   because all these different organizations
[01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:06.640]   are now converging.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.640]   It's very easy to see the grand plan now,
[01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.640]   even though the vast majority of the public
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.640]   is not paying any attention.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.640]   That's why it's so important
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:16.640]   to have this information war.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.640]   To wake up others, to help to educate them.
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:20.640]   We see the incredible apathy
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.640]   at the very bottom of this.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.640]   What this really is, is a brave new world,
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.640]   as I pointed out at the beginning.
[01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.640]   It's really about the majority of people
[01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   not knowing, not caring about the Bilderberg Group,
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.640]   not caring about the TPP,
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.640]   not caring about the TTIP,
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.640]   or any of these partnerships
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.640]   or agreements that are creating
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.640]   a global governance.
[01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.640]   Their eyes just glaze over.
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.640]   They can't be bothered.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:46.640]   Where does this all come from?
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.640]   It really is a brave new world
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:50.640]   at the very bottom. Of course, the people
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.640]   who do pay attention, they will get the iron fist
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:54.640]   of 1984.
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.640]   They will get the Orwellian treatment.
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.640]   But for most of the people, it really is about
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.640]   brave new world. Think about this
[01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:02.640]   summation
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.640]   of the brave new world that one party
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.640]   put out there. It's a system, they said,
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.640]   of social rewards for promiscuity
[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.640]   and lack of commitment.
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:12.640]   Does that describe us today
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:14.640]   in America, in the West?
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.640]   The social media that you see out there,
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.640]   the television, the
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.640]   music videos, the movies that you watch,
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:22.640]   doesn't that summarize that?
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.640]   A system of social rewards for promiscuity
[01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.640]   and lack of commitment.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.640]   In other words,
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.640]   unlimited sex and hedonism,
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:32.640]   but no family.
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.640]   Because, remember, in brave new world,
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.640]   they took away reproductive ability.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.640]   That was handled by the state.
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.640]   They would dumb down some
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.640]   and they would enhance others,
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:44.640]   but they kept control of that.
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:46.640]   The same thing is essentially a retelling
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.640]   with a technological spin
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.640]   of Plato's Republic.
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.640]   We saw this last week in that particular
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.640]   story that was up
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:56.640]   at InfoWars about the
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:58.640]   school, the Gaia Democratic
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.640]   School in Minnesota
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.640]   that took these children
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.640]   to a pornography shop. And if you look
[01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.640]   at this, I looked at that study,
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.640]   that story rather, I looked at it and I said,
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.640]   "Well, why are the parents
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.640]   surprised that this would happen?"
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.640]   Because it's all laid out there.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:16.640]   If you go to their site and you look at
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.640]   what you,
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.640]   the way they talk about what they're doing there,
[01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.640]   they talk about their philosophy, they talk about
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.640]   what Gaia means, and they
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.640]   are consciously referencing back
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.640]   to this pantheism,
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.640]   this paganism, this
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.640]   Gaia hypothesis that was
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.640]   put forth by James Lovelock.
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:36.640]   I remember when I took my family,
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.640]   it was 2001,
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.640]   we went to the UK,
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:42.640]   and came across this
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:44.640]   in so many different ways. Everybody was
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:46.640]   talking about Gaia at the time. I found
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.640]   it on magazines that were sitting on the train.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.640]   We went to the children's museum, and as the
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:52.640]   kids were looking at things, we went up
[01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.640]   to the third floor, it was a play area,
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.640]   and they had this tape loop
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.640]   that was going there that was explaining
[01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.640]   Gaia to everyone. And essentially
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.640]   what it is, is it's an idea that the Earth
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:04.640]   is a living organism, an
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.640]   entity, a conscious single thing,
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.640]   like an individual.
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.640]   Humans are
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.640]   a virus. Humans need to be wiped
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.640]   out. So it's not only
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:16.640]   a kind of pantheism where God is
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.640]   in everything,
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.640]   but it's also an anti-
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.640]   human eugenics type of
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.640]   approach, kind of like the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.640]   It also has that flavor to it.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:28.640]   But you look at the faculty there,
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.640]   and you see that you've got people who are
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:32.640]   practicing witchcraft.
[01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.640]   You look at their summer program, and they've
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.640]   got a witch and wizard
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.640]   camp. Learn real magic and
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.640]   develop your skills in the magical arts.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.640]   They've got people who are teaching there
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.640]   that are heavily into,
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.640]   as they put it, gender,
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   women, and sexuality studies.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   That's where their degrees are. You've got
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:52.640]   the lady who was the one, the teacher,
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:54.640]   who took them to the
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:56.640]   adult
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.640]   bookstore there.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.640]   She has a women's studies
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.640]   certificate from a community college.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.640]   She is an HIV coordinator
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.640]   for a GLBTQ.
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   That's gay, lesbian, bisexual,
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.640]   transsexual, queer
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:12.640]   youth drop. Now, when
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.640]   you look at this, and you say, "This is the principle of the
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.640]   school." When you look at Gaia,
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:18.640]   and you look at this pagan
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:20.640]   anti-human philosophy
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:22.640]   that underlines what they're doing there, why
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.640]   would you be surprised when
[01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:26.640]   they take your children
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.640]   to an adult
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:30.640]   sex toy store
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.640]   as part of a field trip? One of the children
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.640]   was just 11
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.640]   years old. And of course she excuses that by saying, "Well,
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.640]   they're going through physical changes
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.640]   at that point in time." They are not
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.640]   ready to handle it mentally.
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.640]   That's the issue. That's
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.640]   why we have laws against
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.640]   pedophilia. That's
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.640]   why we don't do that sort of thing.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.640]   Nevertheless, you've got
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.640]   a very small school. It's a private school.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.640]   They only have 25 students. You've got nine
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.640]   families who are calling for her resignation.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:00.640]   They're furious that she would do this without
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.640]   their permission. And yet you kind of
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.640]   have to ask, "Why didn't they
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.640]   research what was going on at the school?"
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:08.640]   Let's not get
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.640]   smug about this. Let's ask, "Why don't we
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.640]   do the research as parents about
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.640]   what's going on where our children are
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.640]   being taught?"
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.640]   Have you looked at the background
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:20.640]   of the people and the
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.640]   information that they're being taught in your school?
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:24.640]   Where your children
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.640]   are going? Are you familiar with Common Core?
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.640]   Do you understand the
[01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:30.640]   basis of these
[01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.640]   schools that fall back on
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.640]   Thomas Dewey's philosophy?
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:36.640]   Look at B.F. Skinner's philosophy.
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.640]   Do you really understand this kind
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.640]   of psychological manipulation
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.640]   that they're conducting on your children?
[01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.640]   Because it quite frankly is
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.640]   a brave new school.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.640]   That is the environment.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   What's interesting about the Gaia Democratic School
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:52.640]   is that they're so out front about it.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.640]   They're unabashedly
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.640]   candid about what they're doing there.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.640]   Whereas it's typically hidden
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.640]   at the other schools.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:02.640]   Pay attention to what's going on
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.640]   with your children. You need to understand
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.640]   what they're being taught.
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:08.640]   You need to understand how
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:10.640]   the school is defining an education.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.640]   Many parents
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:14.640]   question, "Why can't Johnny Reed?"
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.640]   That was the question. Well, that was never
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:18.640]   the intention of the government school.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.640]   If you go back and look at Dewey,
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.640]   if you go back and look at B.F. Skinner,
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.640]   that was not the intention.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.640]   Its purpose was not to educate your child.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   Its purpose was not to give your
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   child tools where they could
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.640]   become productive, independent
[01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:34.640]   thinkers. They didn't want to give them
[01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:36.640]   a liberal education in the terms
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.640]   of someone who is able to liberate
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.640]   themselves and think independently.
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:42.640]   They wanted them to be dumbed down.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.640]   The deliberate dumbing down of America.
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.640]   Again, that's a book that we sell at Infowars.com.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.640]   Charlotte Isserby pointed
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.640]   that out a long time ago during
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.640]   the Reagan administration with the new Department
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   of Education. She was brought in as an educator.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:56.640]   She realized
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.640]   what the agenda was on the
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.640]   Department of Education. Of course, that had just been created
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.640]   by Jimmy Carter. It was less
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.640]   than four years old when Ronald Reagan became president.
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.640]   He ran. One of the
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.640]   things when he was running was
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.640]   that he would shut down
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.640]   the Department of Education because
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.640]   the federal government should not be involved
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.640]   in education.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.640]   This is something that should be handled
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.640]   at the local level at the very most.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.640]   But it has to have parental
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.640]   involvements.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.640]   She took a look at this. She understood
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.640]   and she wrote a book about it with Phyllis Schlafly
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   talking about the deliberate dumbing down
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.640]   of America. That was the purpose.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:34.640]   A brave new world
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.640]   through brave new schools.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.640]   That's the way they get this.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.640]   Now, with people not paying
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.640]   any attention, with everything being kept
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.640]   secret, they have over a
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:46.640]   period of decades been able
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.640]   to pull their plan together. It's easy
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:50.640]   to see it now in the final stages.
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:52.640]   That's why it's easier for you to explain
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.640]   this to people who haven't been paying attention.
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:56.640]   You can now look in retrospect and
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.640]   see how this has worked out with the European Union,
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.640]   with the North American Union.
[01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.640]   And again, remember it was
[01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.640]   less than a year ago that David Petraeus,
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   who's gone to the last two Bilderberg
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.640]   groups, he'll probably be at this one
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.640]   this year as well. David
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.640]   Petraeus said, "Well, what comes after America?
[01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.640]   That's easy. North America." He said, "We're
[01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.640]   20 years into the North American Union."
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.640]   They understand what this is about.
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.640]   They created NORTHCOM
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.640]   in 2002. What does
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.640]   NORTHCOM have jurisdiction over? Well,
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.640]   it has jurisdiction over the North American
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:28.640]   Union. It has jurisdiction over
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.640]   Canada, America, Mexico.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.640]   This is something that's been going
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.640]   on for a very long time. We're going to go back
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:36.640]   and look at these documents that we reported on
[01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:38.640]   six years ago about what was
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.640]   happening at Bilderberg. And then we're going to talk
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.640]   about how that's reflected in the
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.640]   current Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.640]   partnerships and
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.640]   the fast-tracked agreement that
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:50.640]   subverts our Constitution. Stay with us.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.640]   We'll be right back.

[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.640]   consumer alert report.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.640]   Many of you are aware that
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.640]   around the world, most populations
[01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:10.640]   are woefully deficient in clean
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.640]   forms of iodine. The good news
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:14.640]   is our listeners over the past
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:16.640]   two years tried X2
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.640]   nascent iodine and experienced
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.640]   it for themselves. The bad
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:22.640]   news is for the first time in more
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.640]   than a year, supplies at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.640]   of survival shield X2 nascent iodine
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:29.640]   are running low. But what's
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.640]   even more serious is the supply
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   of these deep-earth crystals
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.640]   that exclusive 999

[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:41.640]   at InfoWarsLife.com. And that
[01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:43.640]   supply is running low and is
[01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.640]   in question. That's why it's more important
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.640]   than ever to secure your current and long-time
[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:49.640]   supply of survival shield nascent
[01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.640]   iodine X2 today. Available
[01:17:51.640 --> 01:17:53.640]   exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:55.640]   or by calling toll-free
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:58.640]   888-253-3139.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.640]   ever heard firearms manufacturers
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.640]   as sponsors on my syndicated radio show
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.640]   or the nightly news or the news website
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.640]   InfoWars.com because
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:10.640]   the companies I've been approached by were not
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:12.640]   the highest quality and they
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.640]   weren't as affordable as they should be
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:16.640]   so I refused probably 30
[01:18:16.640 --> 01:18:18.640]   40 firearms manufacturers over the
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:20.640]   years. Well then, about 6 months
[01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:22.640]   ago, we get contacted by Head

[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.640]   to support the broadcast. It's always about

[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:04.640]   to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   Crashing through the
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:14.640]   lies and disinformation.
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.640]   It's Alex Jones
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.640]   on the GCN Radio
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:20.640]   Network.
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.640]   Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:26.640]   I'm David Knight.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:28.640]   Co-hosting with me is Alex Jones.
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:30.640]   He's going to be breaking down the
[01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:32.640]   Trans-Pacific Partnership in a
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.640]   later segment. Right now,
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.640]   I want to go back into the
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.640]   history of Bilderberg. And of course
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.640]   we have our reporters on their way there now.
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:42.640]   We have Rob Due and Josh Owens
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.640]   just filed a report. You can see that up
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.640]   on InfoWars. From the airport
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:48.640]   to the airport, we have a lot of
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.640]   information on InfoWars.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:52.640]   From the airport, talking about where they're going
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.640]   and engaging people there at the airport.
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:56.640]   Asking them if they know anything
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:58.640]   about Bilderberg. If they know anything about
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.640]   PPP. If they care.
[01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.640]   And of course the problem is, people
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   don't care. It's the
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.640]   apathy that is killing us. That's
[01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:08.640]   why it's an information war.
[01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.640]   And of course, if you want to support us,
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.640]   we could certainly use your financial support.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:14.640]   But you could also support your health
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.640]   with Survival Shield X2. We have
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.640]   one on right now and it looks like it's going to sell out
[01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.640]   today. It's been moving very quickly.
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:22.640]   Likely, this will be
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.640]   the end of it today. It looks like it might
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.640]   sell out. It's $10 off the
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:28.640]   usual price. It is now just $29.95
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.640]   for a bottle. A few drops
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.640]   of this gives you a powerful dose of
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.640]   a key essential nutrient,
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:36.640]   iodine. And of course, it's in a great form.
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:38.640]   Nascent iodine. This particular nascent
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:40.640]   iodine that we have comes from thousands
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:42.640]   of feet beneath the earth. We run
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.640]   radioactive tests on it before we
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.640]   accept it to make sure that it is pure
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.640]   raw iodine and is not contaminated
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.640]   with anything else. Again,
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.640]   it's time to get prepared with Survival Shield
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.640]   X2 from InfoWarsLife.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.640]   You can find that at InfoWarsLife.com
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.640]   It is $10 off
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:00.640]   per bottle and they expect that to
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:02.640]   sell out today.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:04.640]   Now, as I mentioned at the
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:06.640]   top of the hour, we have an FBI official
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:08.640]   who came out this last week and said
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.640]   "We're going to
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.640]   essentially
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.640]   stop encryption. It's what
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:16.640]   they really want to do. Let's just be honest
[01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:18.640]   about it. They don't want anybody to have
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:20.640]   any secrets from them." He said, "Privacy,
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   if it's above all other things like safety
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.640]   and freedom from terrorism
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.640]   - he gets the freedom in there,
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:28.640]   right? - is not where we want to go."
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.640]   In other words, he doesn't want to go to privacy.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.640]   You need to understand that
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.640]   if they take away your freedom
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:36.640]   in this trade-off
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.640]   - they'd like to tell you there's a trade-off between
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.640]   security and liberty.
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:42.640]   No, there isn't any trade-off.
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.640]   If you give up your liberty,
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.640]   you become a slave by degree.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:48.640]   Slaves are never
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.640]   secure. And if you want to
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.640]   go into maximum security, you know where you get
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.640]   that? In a prison.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.640]   But that's the deal that they're giving you
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.640]   right now. And that's what
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:00.640]   they want to sell you
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.640]   above all else. That's what he says.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:04.640]   They want to prevent encryption above all else.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:06.640]   They want to prevent your privacy
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:08.640]   above all else. They want to know
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.640]   everything about you while they do
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.640]   everything in secret.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:14.640]   That's what this is all about. We saw
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.640]   this a long time ago in Zbigniew
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.640]   Brzezinski when he talked about
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:20.640]   in his book "Between the Two Ages."
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.640]   He talked about a technotronic era.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:24.640]   And he said, "The technotronic era
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:26.640]   is going to involve the gradual appearance
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.640]   of a more controlled society.
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.640]   Such a society would be
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.640]   dominated by an elite
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.640]   that is unrestrained by traditional
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.640]   values. Soon it will be possible
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.640]   to assert almost continuous
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:40.640]   surveillance over every citizen
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:42.640]   and maintain up-to-date,
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.640]   complete files containing even the
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:46.640]   most personal information about the
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.640]   citizen." This was written in 1970.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.640]   This was 45 years
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:52.640]   ago he said this. That
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:54.640]   day is now. It's not just
[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.640]   coming soon. Now they can
[01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:58.640]   assert continuous surveillance
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.640]   over every citizen and maintain
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:02.640]   complete up-to-date files on
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:04.640]   the most personal information about
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.640]   the citizen. And they want to make sure
[01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:08.640]   that that stays that way. And then he finishes
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.640]   up with this from 45 years
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:12.640]   ago. He said, "These files
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.640]   will be subject to
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.640]   instantaneous retrieval by
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.640]   the authorities." That's
[01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.640]   what the FBI is demanding.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.640]   Now he also said something else that was
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.640]   interesting 45 years ago in his
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.640]   book "Between the Two Ages." And again, Zbigniew Brzezinski,
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:28.640]   if you don't remember, he was essentially
[01:24:28.640 --> 01:24:30.640]   the guy that ran the Carter White House.
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.640]   Carter was his man. He picked Carter.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.640]   Carter was one of the founding members of the
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:36.640]   Trilateral Commission. Trilateral Commission
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:38.640]   is another one of these groups like the Bilderberg Group.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.640]   It was created in 1973,
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:42.640]   three years after this book that he wrote.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.640]   That brought him to the attention of
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.640]   David Rockefeller who created the organization.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.640]   And again, one of the founders
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.640]   of that organization, one of the first founding
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:52.640]   members of that organization, was
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:54.640]   Jimmy Carter. He was hand-picked
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.640]   by Zbigniew
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.640]   Brzezinski. And then he became
[01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.640]   the little public face of the
[01:25:00.640 --> 01:25:02.640]   Brzezinski administration, which is what we
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.640]   ought to call it, just as Nixon
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.640]   was the face of the Kissinger
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.640]   administration that followed it.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.640]   He says, "Today we
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.640]   are..." Now this is going back to what Brzezinski
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.640]   wrote 45 years ago in this book
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.640]   before the Trilateral Commission.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.640]   He said, "Today we are witnessing the emergence of
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.640]   transnational elites."
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.640]   This was 45 years ago. He said,
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:24.640]   "Whose ties cut across national boundaries.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.640]   It is likely that before long the
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.640]   social elites of most of the more advanced
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:30.640]   countries will be highly internationalist
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:32.640]   or globalist in their spirit
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:34.640]   and outlook. The nation-state
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.640]   is gradually yielding its
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.640]   sovereignty. Further progress
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.640]   will require greater American sacrifices."
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.640]   He's going to come out of
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.640]   America. We're the ones who are going to be taken
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.640]   down to let this global
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.640]   governance arise.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:50.640]   He says, "More intensive efforts to shape
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.640]   a new world monetary structure will have to
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.640]   be undertaken, with some consequent
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.640]   risk to the present relatively
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.640]   favorable American position."
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:00.640]   Yeah, they come at us
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:02.640]   through economics and through
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:04.640]   currency. Going back
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.640]   to the Bilderberg Group's second
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:10.640]   meeting, 60 years ago.
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:12.640]   We saw these minutes released
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.640]   six years ago. And again, Paul
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.640]   Joseph Watson, one of our reporters who is on his
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:18.640]   way now to this year's Bilderberg
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.640]   in Austria,
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.640]   wrote this at the time, six years ago,
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.640]   when this was released by WikiLeaks.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.640]   He said, "In 2003, a BBC
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.640]   investigative team was allowed to access
[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.640]   Bilderberg files, which confirmed
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.640]   that the EU and the Euro
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.640]   were the brainchild of
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.640]   Bilderberg." So it's nothing
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:38.640]   new to have a secretive
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:40.640]   meeting between corporations
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:42.640]   and governments to
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:44.640]   create world governance. We can see that's
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:46.640]   now in the open with these trade agreements.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:48.640]   The document outlines a plan. It says,
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.640]   "To arrive in the shortest
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:52.640]   possible time, at the highest degree
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.640]   of integration, beginning
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.640]   with a common European market." That
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.640]   was their goal. That's from the minutes of the
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:00.640]   1955 Bilderberg
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:02.640]   meeting. He said, "Just two years later,
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:04.640]   in 1955, we saw the
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:06.640]   first incarnation of the European
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:08.640]   Economic Community, the EEC.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.640]   It was comprised of a
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.640]   single market between Belgium, France,
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:14.640]   Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.640]   the Netherlands.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.640]   The EEC gradually
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.640]   enlarged over the next few decades, until
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:22.640]   it became the European Community.
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.640]   Then it enlarged again to become the
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.640]   European Union, officially created
[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:28.640]   in 1993."
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:30.640]   So you see the pattern of
[01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.640]   gradual consolidation.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.640]   Now, of course, their pattern of
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:36.640]   doing this is to consolidate regionally,
[01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.640]   then to consolidate those regions
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:40.640]   into a world governance.
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.640]   That's why we saw this being done
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:44.640]   in Europe, and then simultaneously
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:46.640]   it was being done in North America.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:48.640]   The Trilateral Commission
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.640]   was set up to work
[01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:52.640]   on three different areas. North America,
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:54.640]   Europe, and Asia.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:56.640]   What do we see now? We see that
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.640]   America, which has been
[01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.640]   the center where they put everything, the
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.640]   UN, all these different globalist
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.640]   organizations, we have a heavy
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.640]   presence in America, and of course, America
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.640]   is now going to unite with
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.640]   Pacific
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.640]   countries, and with
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:14.640]   the European countries. But
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.640]   doing so in a way that is going to give
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.640]   the corporations, the multinational
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:20.640]   corporations that is, just a few multinational
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.640]   corporations, it is going to give them
[01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.640]   control over everything.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:26.640]   So you can see the stepping stones of
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:28.640]   gradual consolidation. Going back again to the
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.640]   1955 Bilderberg
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.640]   summary, they say, "It might be better to proceed
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.640]   through the development of a common market by
[01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.640]   treaty, rather than by the
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.640]   creation of new high authorities."
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.640]   And we're going to talk when we
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:42.640]   come back about why these are treaties,
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.640]   and why this fast-tracked authority,
[01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.640]   the TPA, that was just passed by
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:48.640]   the Senate that is coming up before the House,
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:50.640]   is a treacherous
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:52.640]   agreement that denies the process
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.640]   for approving treaties. Stay with
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.640]   us, we'll be right back.
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:00.640]   Alex Jones here
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.640]   with an Infowarslife.com
[01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.640]   consumer alert report.
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:06.640]   Many of you are aware that
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:08.640]   around the world, most populations
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:10.640]   are woefully deficient in
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.640]   clean forms of iodine. The good
[01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:14.640]   news is, our listeners over the
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.640]   past two years tried
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:18.640]   X2 nascent iodine and experienced
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:20.640]   it for themselves. The bad
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:22.640]   news is, for the first time in
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:24.640]   more than a year, supplies at Infowarslife.com
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.640]   of
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:28.640]   survival shield X2 nascent iodine
[01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:30.640]   are running low. But what's even more
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:32.640]   serious is the supply of
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.640]   these deep earth crystals.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:36.640]   That exclusive 999
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:38.640]   pure source is proprietary
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.640]   and only available to Infowarslife.com
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:42.640]   and that supply
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.640]   is running low and is in question.
[01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:46.640]   That's why it's more important than ever
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:48.640]   to secure your current and long-time
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.640]   supply of survival shield nascent iodine
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:52.640]   X2 today. Available
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.640]   exclusively at Infowarslife.com
[01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:56.640]   or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:00.640]   Hey, how you doing Al?
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.640]   Good brother. Just recently started using your products.
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:04.640]   Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.640]   Me and my wife both use a lot
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.640]   of them and it's made a lot of changes in our lives
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:10.640]   here. Well thank you brother, because it also
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.640]   funds our operation, but doing that I know I've
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.640]   got to have the highest quality. Super male
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:16.640]   vitality was developed to
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:18.640]   activate your body's own natural
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.640]   processes instead of using
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.640]   synthetic chemicals. We do the
[01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.640]   super male and the super female
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.640]   vitality. Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:30:26.640 --> 01:30:28.640]   We've gotten off of the cheap energy
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:30.640]   drinks, energy shots. They've been a ton of
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:32.640]   money there. Sourced from powerful
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.640]   organic herbs, harvested
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:36.640]   around the planet and then
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.640]   concentrated or maximum
[01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.640]   potency. They want to stun
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.640]   and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:44.640]   cover that up for a while, but then burn you
[01:30:44.640 --> 01:30:46.640]   out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets

[01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:02.640]   ever heard firearms manufacturers as
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.640]   sponsors on my syndicated radio show or
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.640]   the nightly news or the news website
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:08.640]   Infowars.com because the companies
[01:32:08.640 --> 01:32:10.640]   I've been approached by were not
[01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.640]   the highest quality and they weren't
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:14.640]   as affordable as they should be so
[01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:16.640]   I refused probably 30, 40
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:18.640]   firearms manufacturers over the years.
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:20.640]   Well then, about six months ago
[01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.640]   we get contacted by Head Down

[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:54.640]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:54.640 --> 01:34:56.640]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:56.640 --> 01:34:58.640]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:00.640]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:02.640]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:04.640]   You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:06.640]   That's precisely what they are.
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:08.640]   Their formal recognition of the fact
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.640]   that power has already passed
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.640]   to these multinational corporations.
[01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.640]   Hasn't it passed?
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:16.640]   I mean, they can come to these
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.640]   Senators, they can come to Congressmen
[01:35:18.640 --> 01:35:20.640]   of every nation
[01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:22.640]   and they can tell them,
[01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:24.640]   "You're not going to be able to tell anybody what you see in this thing."
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:26.640]   "You can't make any notes
[01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.640]   and take these notes with you."
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.640]   They defy them to even talk
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:32.640]   about what they have written.
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:34.640]   And they have, with this
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.640]   fast-track trade agreement that ran
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:38.640]   through the Senate,
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.640]   they have put in process
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.640]   a procedure that is
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:44.640]   not going to be able to
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.640]   stop these agreements.
[01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:48.640]   So when they vote for the Trade Promotion
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:50.640]   Authority, the fast-tracked authority,
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.640]   they are,
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:54.640]   by proxy, voting for
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:56.640]   these partnership agreements, the Transatlantic,
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.640]   the Trans-Pacific, and others
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:00.640]   that are going to come down the road. Because this is going to last
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:02.640]   for six years.
[01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.640]   This is far
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:06.640]   broader than just the TPP
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.640]   and the TTIP.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:10.640]   This is going to go for six years, and just this last week
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.640]   we found out about yet another
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:14.640]   agreement. That's the
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:16.640]   TISA.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.640]   That's the Transfer in
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:20.640]   Trade and Services Agreement.
[01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.640]   It's a new one. Trade and Services Agreement.
[01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:24.640]   The TISA. That's one I didn't even
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:26.640]   know about. It's hard to keep up
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:28.640]   with these things, and they're going to be coming fast
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:30.640]   and furious, because they're going to be created
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.640]   by the executive branch, by Obama.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.640]   They're going to be presented to
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.640]   the legislature, and here's how this process that
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.640]   the Senate has approved, that still has to be approved
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.640]   by the House, but this is what the Senate
[01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.640]   approved last week.
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:44.640]   Typically when a bill becomes law, it has to go through
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:46.640]   committees. So it can be stopped, it can be
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.640]   modified in committees, before
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:50.640]   it goes to the floor. The leadership has a say
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.640]   as to whether or not it's going to go to the floor.
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.640]   It can be amended or stopped at any of these
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.640]   procedures. Not so
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:36:58.640]   with these agreements.
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.640]   Once these things are handed to
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:02.640]   the legislative bodies,
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:04.640]   they will have 45 days to send
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:06.640]   it to the floor. So
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:08.640]   they can make it quicker, but they can't
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.640]   take longer than 45 days, because
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:12.640]   if they don't put it on the floor for a vote
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.640]   in 45 days, it will go there automatically.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:16.640]   They cannot
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:18.640]   stop it in committee. The leadership
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.640]   cannot stop it. It will go to the House floor.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:22.640]   They will have 20 hours
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.640]   to debate it. They will not be allowed
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.640]   to have any amendments. And here's
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.640]   the key thing. It will pass
[01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:30.640]   forward with a simple majority vote
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:32.640]   of 51. Not with
[01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:34.640]   the 67 votes that would be needed
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.640]   for a treaty. So if you want to look
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:38.640]   at it, this TPA that was just passed
[01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:40.640]   in the Senate, was an act
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:42.640]   of treason against the Constitution
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:44.640]   by the 62
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:46.640]   Senators who voted for it.
[01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:48.640]   And let's understand who voted
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.640]   for it, because I've seen a lot of
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:52.640]   criticism of Senators,
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.640]   unjustly, people
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:56.640]   unjustly criticizing Rand Paul, even criticizing
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.640]   us, saying, "Hey, you're criticizing this trade
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.640]   agreement, but you love Rand Paul because he voted
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.640]   for it." He didn't vote for this.
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:04.640]   He voted against the TPA.
[01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:06.640]   Some people have confused the two votes.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:08.640]   There was a vote to stop the
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.640]   filibuster and go to a vote for the
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:12.640]   TPA. He voted for that,
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.640]   as did Senator Sessions and others. All the
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.640]   Republicans who were present voted for that.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:18.640]   But there were at least five Republicans and
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:20.640]   many Democrats, people like
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.640]   Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.640]   Warren, who spoke up against this.
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.640]   They voted against
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:28.640]   the Trade Promotion Authority, the Fast
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:30.640]   Track Authority. And this
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:32.640]   is what Senator Sessions has said. Now he and
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:34.640]   Rand Paul were a couple of the only Senators who
[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.640]   even bothered to go down and look at what
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:38.640]   they could see at this current
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.640]   point from the trade representatives.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.640]   He wrote yet another letter to Barack
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:44.640]   Obama. He says, "On May 6th of this
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.640]   year, I sent you a letter regarding
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:48.640]   your request for Congress to grant you
[01:38:48.640 --> 01:38:50.640]   Fast Track Executive Authority." So he just
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.640]   sent him this letter at the end of this last
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.640]   week. So he said, "I'm including that again
[01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:56.640]   and here are my concerns." He says,
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:58.640]   "Under Fast Track, Congress
[01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:00.640]   transfers its authority to the Executive
[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:02.640]   and agrees to give up several of
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.640]   its most basic powers."
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:06.640]   Exactly. They're giving up the power
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:08.640]   to write legislation. They're giving up the
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.640]   power to amend legislation.
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:12.640]   They're giving up the power to fully consider
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.640]   legislation on the floor. They're giving
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.640]   up the power to keep debate open
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:18.640]   until Senate cloture is invoked
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:20.640]   and, most importantly,
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:22.640]   they are giving up the
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:24.640]   constitutional requirement
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:26.640]   that treaties receive a
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:28.640]   two-thirds vote.
[01:39:28.640 --> 01:39:30.640]   He gets to the point. He doesn't
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:32.640]   play around with words. He's one of the few people
[01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:34.640]   to come out and say, "This is a treaty."
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.640]   It is a treaty. It's a lie to say
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.640]   that it is a trade agreement or a partnership.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.640]   It is a treaty. And as such,
[01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:42.640]   the constitutional requirement is
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:44.640]   that you get a two-thirds vote. Good
[01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:46.640]   for Senator Sessions, Jeff Sessions,
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:48.640]   to say that. He says that
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:50.640]   the latter, the fact that it is a
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:52.640]   treaty that needs a two-thirds vote, 67
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:54.640]   votes, he said, "That is especially
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.640]   important since having been close,
[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:58.640]   having been to the closed room
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:00.640]   to review the secret text of the
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:02.640]   Trans-Pacific Partnership, it is clear
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:04.640]   that it more closely resembles
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.640]   a treaty than a trade
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.640]   deal." And he says,
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:10.640]   "Fast Track through Congress would
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:12.640]   be pre-clearing a political
[01:40:12.640 --> 01:40:14.640]   and economic union."
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.640]   Understand, political union.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:18.640]   Not just an economic union, a political
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:20.640]   union. He understands where this is going.
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:22.640]   He knows that this is a treaty. He knows that this is
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:24.640]   a political union, not simply
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:26.640]   an economic union. Before
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:28.640]   a word of that agreement
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.640]   has been made available to a
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:32.640]   single private citizen.
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:34.640]   That is key.
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:36.640]   Senator Sessions has gone to
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:38.640]   the core of the issue.
[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:40.640]   This is like the Enabling Act that the
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:42.640]   White House and the White House and the
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:44.640]   White House and the White House and the
