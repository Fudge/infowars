[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:39.040]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:39.040 --> 00:47.000]  it is Tuesday the 24th day of May 2011 we're going to be live here for the
[00:47.000 --> 00:52.840]  next three hours Webster Griffin Tarpley joins us coming up in the second hour
[00:52.840 --> 00:59.640]  today he's going to be breaking down his detailed report yesterday posted at
[00:59.640 --> 01:07.960]  info wars.com US and Pakistan near open war and that is not an overstatement
[01:07.960 --> 01:16.240]  that is an accurate factual moderate statement that is exactly what is
[01:16.240 --> 01:20.920]  unfolding and it's part of a larger strategic plan. Tarpley six months before
[01:20.920 --> 01:26.800]  all of this began to unfold broke down this was the next piece that they wanted
[01:26.800 --> 01:32.040]  to move on the grand chessboard so Tarpley will be joining us with his
[01:32.040 --> 01:38.280]  detailed report US Pakistan near open war and what that will mean for the people
[01:38.280 --> 01:44.120]  of this planet and the people of the United States. Dr. Jerome Corsi will
[01:44.120 --> 01:49.320]  be joining us of course he's the guy that Swift voted John Kerry for those that
[01:49.320 --> 01:56.440]  don't know who he is and he has been breaking a lot of important news and
[01:56.440 --> 02:00.560]  information dealing with the whole birth certificate and the cover-up of what's
[02:00.560 --> 02:05.120]  happening with that. Corsi has now come out and this is up on
[02:05.120 --> 02:10.760]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com Corsi to file criminal charges against
[02:10.760 --> 02:16.280]  White House over Obama birth certificate and he's also sent me some other
[02:16.280 --> 02:20.360]  internal documents that he's going to be releasing here in the next few days he's
[02:20.360 --> 02:25.720]  sent us those ahead of time so we can go over those ahead of his interview today
[02:25.720 --> 02:32.680]  joining us in the third hour. We've not been big birther advocates in the last
[02:32.680 --> 02:37.200]  three years but more and more as we see evidence of a cover-up we've been forced
[02:37.200 --> 02:44.080]  to cover it and I know that there's a birth announcement in Hawaii those
[02:44.080 --> 02:47.440]  grandparents put in there and people say well that's the total proof well that's
[02:47.440 --> 02:53.480]  standard if you're trying you know to get a baby that's born out of the country
[02:53.480 --> 02:57.280]  that you want to have American citizenship and all the value that went
[02:57.280 --> 03:01.680]  with that especially in 1961 to put the birth announcement in the paper because
[03:01.680 --> 03:05.880]  then that could be used as evidence later to get the birth certificate it's
[03:05.880 --> 03:11.040]  also being confirmed by private investigators and credit report experts
[03:11.040 --> 03:16.640]  I looked into this myself last night WorldNet Daily's reporting on it today
[03:16.640 --> 03:23.480]  that Obama has a Connecticut social security number and that's not how it
[03:23.480 --> 03:28.720]  works you get it issued regionally and then associated with the time and date
[03:28.720 --> 03:35.880]  of the issuance of the social security number and it's beginning to link back
[03:35.880 --> 03:39.920]  to some of his family so there's a reason all of his records have been so
[03:39.920 --> 03:43.080]  sealed remember two years ago was a conspiracy theory to say his name was
[03:43.080 --> 03:48.600]  Barry Cetero and now the mainstream media is like oh yeah it was Barry Cetero
[03:48.600 --> 03:54.080]  he did change his name oh he was never a Muslim oh but it does say that in the
[03:54.080 --> 03:57.320]  one school record we've got from Indonesia so that the point is they're
[03:57.320 --> 04:02.600]  always changing their story and then Abercrombie the governor goes to the
[04:02.600 --> 04:07.800]  Bureau of Vital Statistics in Hawaii and comes out and says I couldn't find it and
[04:07.800 --> 04:12.720]  then magically it appears and then I go okay born in Hawaii let's move on to real
[04:12.720 --> 04:21.160]  issues then we look at them thing and it looks like a Photoshop novice made it I
[04:21.160 --> 04:26.760]  mean there are areas that are clear high res and then areas where you can see
[04:26.760 --> 04:32.080]  changes have been made where it's high res then areas beside it low res I mean
[04:32.080 --> 04:36.880]  it's been messed with it's been messed with and so people are like well why
[04:36.880 --> 04:40.920]  even cover it well why go after Nixon for lying about Watergate because he's
[04:40.920 --> 04:45.120]  lying something's going on they're hiding something they spent two million
[04:45.120 --> 04:49.720]  over almost three years blocking the release of this long form they said the
[04:49.720 --> 04:54.200]  long form didn't exist they've been lying they're hiding something that's why
[04:54.200 --> 04:58.760]  we've been covering it I got a bunch of other news coming up stay with us
[05:00.320 --> 05:04.880]  hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to

[06:10.840 --> 06:14.440]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned members
[06:14.440 --> 06:19.520]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[06:19.520 --> 06:24.880]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[06:24.880 --> 06:29.800]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel

[07:58.560 --> 08:08.200]  Alex ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:14.000 --> 08:22.440]  right now Benjamin yet in Yahoo is addressing the Congress at the Capitol
[08:22.440 --> 08:29.560]  giving a speech hyping up all of the fake terror and how important it is that
[08:29.560 --> 08:35.280]  we stay on our toes or Al C. I. Ada or Hamas that Israel publicly admits they
[08:35.280 --> 08:40.800]  founded oh you didn't know that that's admitted mainline history are about to
[08:40.800 --> 08:44.840]  attack us we've got to give all our rights up what would the national
[08:44.840 --> 08:49.560]  security state of Israel where they can ban free speech arrest scientists that
[08:49.560 --> 08:54.040]  expose the nuclear program get away with whatever they want what would the
[08:54.040 --> 08:59.840]  Israel do if they didn't have all these convenient terrorists menacing their
[08:59.840 --> 09:06.160]  population in our population what would Israel do well Israel wouldn't be able to
[09:06.160 --> 09:12.560]  continue to expand its borders Israel wouldn't be able to continue to lobby in
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.720]  the US to set up police state style systems here oh yes it's Israel in many
[09:17.720 --> 09:22.840]  cases that is advising the SWAT teams and local police and the threat fusion
[09:22.840 --> 09:28.520]  centers and I quite frankly resent it I don't want to be involved in Egypt I
[09:28.520 --> 09:31.600]  don't want to be involved in Israel I don't want to be involved in Libya I
[09:31.600 --> 09:36.040]  don't want to be involved in Pakistan I don't want to be involved in the 160
[09:36.040 --> 09:44.960]  plus countries that my tax money pays for a wire we concerned with Israel a
[09:44.960 --> 09:50.320]  country the size of Rhode Island why are we concerned with England why are
[09:50.320 --> 09:53.840]  we concerned with Russia it's like George why I know for some of you this
[09:53.840 --> 09:59.240]  sounds completely alien and that's because America has gotten so far away
[09:59.240 --> 10:05.280]  from our roots so far away from what this country was established for not
[10:05.280 --> 10:09.480]  getting involved in foreign entanglements not getting involved in foreign
[10:09.480 --> 10:15.600]  alliances that was a revolutionary idea that was George Washington who said that
[10:15.600 --> 10:19.760]  because before countries were always in wars always teaming up with each other
[10:19.760 --> 10:23.880]  always trying to invade other countries always trying to come to the aid of
[10:23.880 --> 10:27.600]  another country instead of just being left alone and engaging in trade and
[10:27.600 --> 10:32.240]  being people's friends but see oh then if somebody attacks you then you've got
[10:32.240 --> 10:36.600]  to attack them well what if that country really isn't going to attack you what if
[10:36.600 --> 10:42.080]  your ally attacks you or funds a group to attack you or creates a group to
[10:42.080 --> 10:47.200]  attack you so that you'll then come to their aid very basic psychology and I
[10:47.200 --> 10:51.660]  quite frankly am sick and tired of it and and what if you're the military
[10:51.660 --> 10:55.560]  industrial complex getting trillions of American tax dollars a year running the
[10:55.560 --> 11:00.000]  red light cameras running the police surveillance programs running the black
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.440]  box initiatives in all the cell phones and computers and going into all the
[11:04.440 --> 11:08.680]  cars by law to track everything we're doing developed by defense contractor
[11:08.680 --> 11:13.480]  companies who can just go lobby the government just like big agra can lobby
[11:13.480 --> 11:20.560]  the government to shut down their small competition just like we see GE running
[11:20.560 --> 11:24.440]  the White House shutting down their competition through the greenhouse gas
[11:24.440 --> 11:31.200]  taxes and regulations look this is the name of the game a bunch of insiders who
[11:31.200 --> 11:34.520]  were able to write the laws and the regulations because they can't get
[11:34.520 --> 11:40.160]  Congress to pass a law they just do it to basically dismantle what our country
[11:40.160 --> 11:46.360]  wants was and now we can't talk about trying to restore the Republic trying to
[11:46.360 --> 11:49.840]  get us out of the clutches of the foreign private banking corporate
[11:49.840 --> 11:58.920]  cartels instead we've got to be lectured by Benjamin yet and yahoo about our
[11:58.920 --> 12:03.960]  obsession in every newspaper every magazine every week for my entire life
[12:03.960 --> 12:11.640]  nothing but Israel nothing but the Palestinians nothing but their 3,000
[12:11.640 --> 12:18.000]  year-old tribal warfare between these groups that is never going to end never
[12:18.000 --> 12:25.400]  never never no matter what side you take it's never going away it's never going
[12:25.400 --> 12:35.840]  to stop it's never going to cease this is perpetual perpetual and our
[12:35.840 --> 12:40.480]  government spends more time on what's going on in the Middle East and Israel
[12:40.480 --> 12:45.640]  than they do dealing with problems here in our country and and last time I
[12:45.640 --> 12:49.880]  checked folks we're not England we're not Israel we're not Germany we're not
[12:49.880 --> 12:54.120]  Russia we're the United States but this is what globalism is all about getting
[12:54.120 --> 12:56.680]  us involved in these foreign entanglements and that's why we're
[12:56.680 --> 13:05.360]  bankrupt and you know quite frankly I am angry at the Israeli lobby I don't like
[13:05.360 --> 13:08.360]  what the Israeli lobbies doing I don't like the general electric lobby I don't
[13:08.360 --> 13:12.560]  like the defense contractor lobbies I don't I don't like any of these foreign
[13:12.560 --> 13:18.320]  international organizations coming in and buying our politicians like their
[13:18.320 --> 13:23.120]  baseball cards they're collecting or so much change in their pocket I don't like
[13:23.120 --> 13:29.080]  foreign domination illegitimate foreign domination and Israel the Israeli
[13:29.080 --> 13:35.480]  lobby openly you can go look it up is one of the biggest
[13:35.480 --> 13:40.720]  financiers of anti-gun legislation in this country and the NRA needs to talk
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.280]  about that Gunners of America needs to talk about that why in Israel do they
[13:45.280 --> 13:51.480]  give all the Israelis who wanted M16s which is fine with me I'm all people
[13:51.480 --> 13:57.320]  being able to defend themselves but then the Chuckie Schumer and the Rahm
[13:57.320 --> 14:02.080]  Emmanuel and all these people who in many cases are admittedly Israeli
[14:02.080 --> 14:10.120]  citizens and serving the Israeli military like Rahm Emmanuel and then he
[14:10.120 --> 14:14.560]  says that he wants all handguns banned and he wants to be able to have a secret
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.920]  government list where I can't buy a gun no judge no jury no arrest no charges no
[14:19.920 --> 14:23.800]  due process and I can't find out why I'm on the list or how I got on it and then
[14:23.800 --> 14:30.560]  I can't own a gun because because he says so
[14:32.000 --> 14:43.760]  because he says so because he is my boss he is my owner I don't like that and I
[14:43.760 --> 14:48.360]  don't like the fact that British intelligence is so heavily involved in
[14:48.360 --> 14:53.720]  our politics but more behind the scenes I I don't like foreign intrusion you see
[14:53.720 --> 14:58.000]  the government is setting up a system where the people are cut off from their
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.480]  elected representatives who are no longer servants but are officials and
[15:01.480 --> 15:08.360]  authorities and excellencies and honors and and and in all of these titles that
[15:08.360 --> 15:15.960]  belong to you know Kings and it's time for Americans to quit being so polite
[15:15.960 --> 15:21.600]  it's time for Americans to quit mincing words and and going along with the
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.120]  different mafias that exist that that were all taught to salute saluting
[15:26.120 --> 15:30.600]  Israel is the greatest form of American patriotism we're told saluting the
[15:30.600 --> 15:34.200]  defense contractors is the greatest form of patriotism saluting the fellow
[15:34.200 --> 15:38.160]  reserve is the greatest form of patriotism saluting the corrupt local
[15:38.160 --> 15:43.560]  mayors is the greatest form of patriotism groveling to police who more and
[15:43.560 --> 15:48.440]  more act like out-of-control criminals you know slamming people's heads in the
[15:48.440 --> 15:52.000]  ground out of wheelchairs and then lying and saying that they fell out of the
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.920]  wheelchair when the video is public that just came out a few days ago the police
[15:55.920 --> 15:59.600]  said oh he fell out yeah they grab him slam his head in keep slamming it that's
[15:59.600 --> 16:04.240]  falling I mean it's even when we know they're lying they lie in our face is a
[16:04.240 --> 16:08.840]  part of disrespect and I'm supposed to just run out with a piece of pie and a
[16:08.840 --> 16:12.720]  cup of coffee every time I see a cop and be afraid and kiss their hind in and
[16:12.720 --> 16:21.960]  everything like I've been in Mexico I've been in Honduras in places and you see
[16:21.960 --> 16:25.720]  the corrupt cops strutting around bugging their eyes out of people and I
[16:25.720 --> 16:29.120]  just can't help it I see Mexican troops walking along with their in their black
[16:29.120 --> 16:32.640]  uniforms with machine guns bugging their eyes out people scared tourists kind of
[16:32.640 --> 16:36.680]  ducking into things I just go ahead and just look at them and because it's an
[16:36.680 --> 16:40.800]  exercise that I keep my humanity and then I not be turned into a servile
[16:40.800 --> 16:49.040]  coward and I start taking pictures of them and most the time suddenly they go
[16:49.040 --> 16:52.440]  from acting like a weird thug to kind of looking at you and smiling because they
[16:52.440 --> 16:56.880]  think oh you must have power because you're not afraid of me see the system
[16:56.880 --> 17:02.240]  likes poor people with sewer lines open in the street and chickens running
[17:02.240 --> 17:07.520]  around and children with malnutrition the globalist have written white papers
[17:07.520 --> 17:11.520]  on how they want to use poverty to control us and then have poverty stricken
[17:11.520 --> 17:16.560]  cops who all they've got is their one uniform with the mustard stains on it
[17:16.560 --> 17:23.120]  you know out there shaking people down and I'm done I'm done having wart
[17:23.120 --> 17:30.200]  covered tyranny being shoved in my face and I'm being told it's Miss America I'm
[17:30.200 --> 17:34.480]  tired of them rolling a skeleton out in front of me and telling me I need to
[17:34.480 --> 17:41.200]  take it to the prom it's a rotten decaying mass we've studied history it's
[17:41.200 --> 17:46.160]  common sense tyranny happens over and over again the servants always get too
[17:46.160 --> 18:01.760]  much power and then they become the masters and then they go crazy I don't
[18:01.760 --> 18:06.040]  even know what to say I don't even know what to do anymore I mean it is prima
[18:06.040 --> 18:14.080]  facia in your face that this entire society is sinking into a total swamp
[18:14.080 --> 18:19.520]  of corruption that's the scariest thing about corruption once total corruption
[18:19.520 --> 18:25.200]  sets in the the corrupt operate the same way throughout history in every
[18:25.200 --> 18:31.360]  culture corruption and and and crime use truly one of the oldest and most
[18:31.360 --> 18:39.880]  organized cultures and it always wages war against any system or any canon or
[18:39.880 --> 18:45.400]  any law or any idea or any institution that would resist its total domination
[18:45.400 --> 18:51.320]  and then once they're in place the criminals then have a extreme form of
[18:51.320 --> 18:59.440]  nepotism where they recruit from the criminal ranks and create new offices
[18:59.440 --> 19:05.200]  for the criminal ranks and are threatened by anything good and wholesome
[19:05.200 --> 19:10.440]  and then overrun everything good and pull it down until they're sitting on a
[19:10.440 --> 19:22.760]  pile of societal industrial in the more modern sense or sociological wreckage of
[19:22.760 --> 19:27.680]  civilization they they always pull it down they always wreck everything and
[19:27.680 --> 19:32.120]  then the rest of the population fights back by being passive aggressive and
[19:32.120 --> 19:36.360]  not producing a lot or sitting around on their butts why should you paint a
[19:36.360 --> 19:39.240]  painting it'll just be stolen why should you build a business it'll just be
[19:39.240 --> 19:44.600]  stolen and then the whole society circles the toilet and that's America and
[19:44.600 --> 19:50.400]  it's all happening right now and when I see cops bugging their eyes out on

[22:03.800 --> 22:07.520]  that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the
[22:07.520 --> 22:11.120]  devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the
[22:11.120 --> 22:15.240]  United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless all
[22:15.240 --> 22:19.160]  caused by the devalued US dollar while the mainstream media continues to

[23:06.960 --> 23:11.480]  osteoporosis supplement shown to decrease fractures 87% without any of the
[23:11.480 --> 23:15.360]  dangerous side effects of medications calcium and vitamin D only decrease

[24:15.800 --> 24:27.080]  if you leave me I won't miss you and I won't ever take you back well the British
[24:27.080 --> 24:30.720]  government has announced they're gonna deploy a whole bunch of attack
[24:30.720 --> 24:35.000]  helicopters to the ground of Libya if the Libyan government fires back of
[24:35.000 --> 24:39.120]  course it'll be an act of terrorism when a foreign army invades you and you
[24:39.120 --> 24:44.520]  fight back it's now an act of terrorism that's the bizarre new psychology they
[24:44.520 --> 24:50.200]  sunk last week eight Libyan warships import the bombing is only intensifying
[24:50.200 --> 24:54.480]  Congress of course the House and Senate sent letters last week to President
[24:54.480 --> 25:00.600]  Obama and said President Obama we would like you to tell us how long you're
[25:00.600 --> 25:03.060]  gonna be there and if you're gonna continue you need to come to us and get
[25:03.060 --> 25:08.080]  war powers authorization as the Constitution states and Obama ABC News
[25:08.080 --> 25:11.800]  covered his quotes said we don't need that anymore we have you in
[25:11.800 --> 25:16.960]  authorization and that's the end of it Congress you can go sit in the corner
[25:16.960 --> 25:22.160]  and put a dunce hat on and suck your thumb why not I mean they spy on us
[25:22.160 --> 25:28.400]  without warrants they've got federalized goons at the TSA announcing the rollout
[25:28.400 --> 25:35.920]  at the prom and at grocery stores and malls and randomly at G20 meetings they
[25:35.920 --> 25:39.400]  in Pittsburgh they just say no one's allowed on the street anywhere randomly
[25:39.400 --> 25:43.400]  and they attack old ladies with police dogs coming out of stores with bags I
[25:43.400 --> 25:46.920]  mean why not have the president tell Congress sit down and shut up why not
[25:46.920 --> 25:51.520]  have the president tell the governor of Tennessee two years ago when they had
[25:51.520 --> 25:55.240]  military checkpoints on the highways governor said you can't do that without
[25:55.240 --> 25:59.720]  my permission and the Fed said we'll do whatever we want read the John Warren
[25:59.720 --> 26:04.800]  defense authorization act this is what's going on this is what's happening this
[26:04.800 --> 26:11.920]  is what this is what we're dealing with as a society because once the
[26:11.920 --> 26:15.640]  government isn't bound and once they start breaking little rules then they
[26:15.640 --> 26:20.600]  break beggar rules and finally they just say we'll do whatever we want we'll give
[26:20.600 --> 26:24.240]  $27 trillion to foreign offshore banks and then not tell Congress where it
[26:24.240 --> 26:28.880]  went we'll do whatever we want we'll stick our hands down your pants we'll
[26:28.880 --> 26:34.920]  break your will we'll randomly say you're not allowed to buy guns now because
[26:34.920 --> 26:38.200]  Americans for now at least three generations haven't really been taught
[26:38.200 --> 26:41.960]  about liberty or freedom or what it means and in the last 20 or 30 years
[26:41.960 --> 26:47.040]  they've demonized people and I remember getting government dossiers and reports
[26:47.040 --> 26:50.840]  in the mid 90s where it said do they make frequent references to the US
[26:50.840 --> 26:56.480]  Constitution do they have a get us out of the UN sticker on their car I remember
[26:56.480 --> 27:00.800]  a law enforcement magazine I bought at 711 just randomly something told me by
[27:00.800 --> 27:05.520]  that think was weapons and technology of law enforcement it was a SWAT team type
[27:05.520 --> 27:09.400]  magazine and it it was in there and it you can probably pull this up online
[27:09.400 --> 27:13.880]  because I did find an online copy of it many years ago and they said look if you
[27:13.880 --> 27:17.560]  see it get us out of the UN sticker on a car go ahead and pull them over go ahead
[27:17.560 --> 27:23.800]  and arrest them and police chiefs don't chastise this officer because having to
[27:23.800 --> 27:27.720]  get us out of the UN sticker means they may be a terror so go ahead and bring
[27:27.720 --> 27:31.000]  them in for whatever reason you need to make up whatever you need to see an
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.880]  American now cops read that they go well it's in an open magazine that I need to
[27:36.880 --> 27:43.360]  go ahead and take people into jail and they see as long as it's publicly
[27:43.360 --> 27:49.040]  exercised that's why they publicly came out and said torture is good torture is
[27:49.040 --> 27:53.760]  American as American as John Wayne apple pine baseball and the military went
[27:53.760 --> 27:56.360]  out and tortured people to death including people's children in front of
[27:56.360 --> 28:00.840]  their parents that's in the army's own report just army report on torture at
[28:00.840 --> 28:04.560]  Abu Ghraib you'll get MSNBC first published the full thing if you've got
[28:04.560 --> 28:11.040]  the nerve to read it again they used acid on large objects on children I'm not
[28:11.040 --> 28:15.320]  going to get into it but it's it's Hellraiser Jeffrey Dahmer it actually is
[28:15.320 --> 28:20.800]  worse than Jeffrey Dahmer Jeffrey Dahmer would sedate them before he used them as
[28:20.800 --> 28:26.600]  sex slave which is bad enough this is the opposite of sedation with the with
[28:26.600 --> 28:36.640]  the acid in the orifices but again then they got caught and so a few of them went
[28:36.640 --> 28:40.120]  to prison but then Bush put a book out saying I'd order torture again see
[28:40.120 --> 28:45.560]  that's the crazy world where raping children with battery acid dripping
[28:45.560 --> 28:52.880]  objects that's America and if you don't basically hail Hellraiser and pinhead I
[28:52.880 --> 28:58.000]  mean if you don't get into hardcore sato masochistic child torture you're not
[28:58.000 --> 29:02.360]  American you're not tough you're not a leader you don't have that what it takes
[29:02.360 --> 29:07.240]  how many shows on 24 and countless other programs same thing in Europe we
[29:07.240 --> 29:11.360]  wrote articles about it just search TV show promotes torture of children prison
[29:11.360 --> 29:15.560]  bonnet.com you'll get a whole bunch of articles on it and you know different TV
[29:15.560 --> 29:18.680]  shows in Europe England in the US Canada they all have their own special
[29:18.680 --> 29:21.280]  shows Homeland Security they were involved in some of the behind the
[29:21.280 --> 29:25.840]  scenes production and product placement funding propaganda placement in the show
[29:25.840 --> 29:31.800]  and oh the good guy has to torture a kid in front of the parent but that stops
[29:31.800 --> 29:36.880]  the nuke from going off see and once you get the cops to take on the Hellraiser
[29:36.880 --> 29:41.360]  attitude that it's good to want to torture kids well now this guy's the
[29:41.360 --> 29:47.000]  limit then you build a out-of-control federal brigade of potbelly pedophiles
[29:47.000 --> 29:51.040]  just take their hands down the pants to teach the parents to submit we're on the
[29:51.040 --> 30:00.640]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a very

[35:14.840 --> 35:20.120]  and this I'm not saying it's a good thing what Egypt was doing but you better
[35:20.120 --> 35:25.080]  believe it's about getting the 7 billion that Mubarak reportedly culled from
[35:25.080 --> 35:30.120]  that population over the 30-plus years he was in power and then notice there's
[35:30.120 --> 35:36.640]  no discussion of where his 7 billion went the new puppet group that's in there
[35:36.640 --> 35:41.880]  controlled by the old US created and trained military basically the US now
[35:41.880 --> 35:45.640]  people that run the people that run the US then through the US the big
[35:45.640 --> 35:50.720]  megabanks that run the US then through their military industrial complex and
[35:50.720 --> 35:55.400]  COG continuity government system then control Egypt and and that's on record
[35:55.400 --> 35:59.760]  and so what does that tell you about the globalist their own guy who groveled to
[35:59.760 --> 36:03.360]  them who would take people from all over the world on US aircraft flown there
[36:03.360 --> 36:08.200]  including American citizens to be tortured viciously the darling of Israel
[36:08.200 --> 36:13.040]  the darling of the United States State Department comes in sends alberian a
[36:13.040 --> 36:16.880]  week before revolution to start they fund groups they send in a Google
[36:16.880 --> 36:24.840]  executive on record to control the Google Facebook manipulations they send
[36:24.840 --> 36:28.320]  out the crowds which many of which had a reason to rebel against the western
[36:28.320 --> 36:36.080]  backed dictator but that's like the FBI arresting some local New Jersey capo but
[36:36.080 --> 36:43.040]  not going after the dawn of you know the tri-state area not going after the big
[36:43.040 --> 36:50.040]  dawn sitting in Manhattan but busting a capo say over Newark and the and the
[36:50.040 --> 36:56.160]  dawn is on television telling us how he's liberating Newark from his capo
[36:56.160 --> 37:05.000]  and we sit here with a completely and totally straight face putting up with
[37:05.000 --> 37:09.120]  this I mean it's just completely asinine so they're gonna end up killing him
[37:09.120 --> 37:13.720]  probably they'll execute him and his son or maybe they'll just put him in
[37:13.720 --> 37:18.720]  prison but the word is remember mubarak refused to step down our media came out
[37:18.720 --> 37:22.720]  and said mubarak will step down when in one hour State Department can confirm
[37:22.720 --> 37:26.600]  mubarak comes out eight nine hours later at the middle of the night Egypt time
[37:26.600 --> 37:30.040]  in the evening here and says I will not be stepping down to this foreign plot
[37:30.040 --> 37:36.680]  you're trying to bring down our country and they said take that and suddenly he
[37:36.680 --> 37:42.640]  falls over with stroke and they've got patented systems that are audio
[37:42.640 --> 37:46.520]  frequency systems they can hit generally the elderly where there's massive on
[37:46.520 --> 37:52.760]  average clotting in the big arteries in the throat and it breaks that up my dad
[37:52.760 --> 37:55.760]  told me about this and I went and looked it up and there it was and so nobody
[37:55.760 --> 37:59.160]  can even hear it you just feel a vibration in your throat it breaks up
[37:59.160 --> 38:04.280]  all that plaque and boom you have the stroke a few hours later but who knows
[38:04.280 --> 38:08.480]  I'm sure he just had a stroke a few minutes after leaving the podium I'm
[38:08.480 --> 38:15.120]  sure it was stressful for him and the head guy in Tunisia well what now three
[38:15.120 --> 38:19.600]  of the Middle Eastern leaders have strokes they just they've they they they
[38:19.600 --> 38:24.400]  they they don't die now they just fall over like jellyfish and then they'll
[38:24.400 --> 38:28.280]  roll in the unconscious person for the trial and then execute him and then
[38:28.280 --> 38:36.680]  there will be no no Obama says they're gonna forgive the one billion dollars of
[38:36.680 --> 38:42.360]  IMF World Bank debt Egypt's last time I checked has debt many times that and
[38:42.360 --> 38:47.280]  they've paid off the debts many times but but but but never the interest of
[38:47.280 --> 38:51.120]  course just create out of nothing backed up by US taxpayer money and now
[38:51.120 --> 38:54.720]  European tax money predominantly those the main contributors the IMF and World
[38:54.720 --> 38:58.040]  Bank US is the biggest contributor to the World Bank you're up to the IMF but
[38:58.040 --> 39:10.160]  both both power blocks contribute and looking at this it just shows the abject
[39:10.160 --> 39:14.240]  treachery and you got to love were several months into the whole Qaddafi
[39:14.240 --> 39:18.120]  bombardment after a couple months of their al-Qaeda back rebels not being
[39:18.120 --> 39:23.400]  able to overthrow Qaddafi they just continue to intensify the bombardment
[39:23.400 --> 39:28.360]  the ground troops advising the weapons systems the satellites being turned over
[39:28.360 --> 39:33.800]  the rebels to coordinate attacks now the attack helicopters the British the BBC
[39:33.800 --> 39:38.840]  and others are reporting are flowing in with the attack helicopters which are
[39:38.840 --> 39:45.000]  extremely formidable the Libyan government forces have been doing hit and
[39:45.000 --> 39:49.280]  runs and popping up and popping back undercover fighting the al-Qaeda forces
[39:49.280 --> 39:55.280]  and now the al-Qaeda forces are continuing to not have big victories
[39:55.280 --> 40:01.480]  and continuing to lose and so they're now getting ready to swore out war crimes
[40:01.480 --> 40:09.200]  on Qaddafi and they openly told him they said leave to another African country
[40:09.200 --> 40:12.680]  and we won't charge you with war crimes of course he knows that they lie
[40:12.680 --> 40:18.400]  incessantly remember Saddam was told leave Iraq and we won't invade and then
[40:18.400 --> 40:22.520]  it later got declassified they were planning to invade regardless and they
[40:22.520 --> 40:27.000]  were lying well of course they're lying the globalists lie out of hand and we
[40:27.000 --> 40:33.680]  just naively like children think anything the government pushes or says
[40:33.680 --> 40:42.120]  is a great thing so this is basically World War three by quasi stealth a
[40:42.120 --> 40:49.040]  thousand plus drones bombing Pakistan U.S. helicopters attacking military bases
[40:49.040 --> 40:55.240]  military emplacements helicopters going in and doing the stage killing of
[40:55.240 --> 41:02.080]  Osama bin Bernanke I meant Osama bin Laden all of this going on Pakistan says
[41:02.080 --> 41:09.200]  you're starting a war with us China says don't start a war with them you've got
[41:09.200 --> 41:14.880]  all these other proxy wars starting up everywhere and remember it's not our
[41:14.880 --> 41:18.560]  government doing this it's the criminals that have hijacked it and put their
[41:18.560 --> 41:22.560]  people in government this is an illegitimate government and they hate
[41:22.560 --> 41:26.760]  the American people even more than they hate sovereign Pakistanis sovereign
[41:26.760 --> 41:31.960]  Libyans they hate anybody they don't control this is about total domination
[41:31.960 --> 41:36.520]  of every facet of society speaking of that globally the agreements are being
[41:36.520 --> 41:41.280]  codified for new systems to shut down websites without court orders the
[41:41.280 --> 41:48.480]  censor websites and to have government roles at Google YouTube Yahoo Facebook
[41:48.480 --> 41:56.520]  and all the other major systems it's basically the internet to plan and all
[41:56.520 --> 42:00.600]  over Europe and England and now it's starting here YouTube and Google are
[42:00.600 --> 42:04.960]  knocking videos down saying this was taken down due to a government request
[42:04.960 --> 42:10.000]  so it's not happening with a bang but with a whimper here's the Washington
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.240]  Times Senate debates presidential power during cyber attacks so and you notice
[42:16.240 --> 42:19.720]  part of that is the is the kill switches and all the phones and devices and the
[42:19.720 --> 42:23.160]  takeover switches with government messages it's not really a kill switch
[42:23.160 --> 42:27.640]  it can be used as that its main system is a government takeover switch a kill
[42:27.640 --> 42:32.040]  switch is is only one facet of it it's a government takeover switch the point is
[42:32.040 --> 42:35.920]  they're getting all this ready now and announcing it to you mean which means
[42:35.920 --> 42:43.040]  they're getting closer to using it it says existing law crafted 1934 for
[42:43.040 --> 42:48.640]  radio and it's a total takeover system senator squared off with Obama
[42:48.640 --> 42:52.720]  administration yesterday about plans to give the president emergency powers to
[42:52.720 --> 42:56.800]  protect vital US electronic networks from attacks by hackers cyber terrorists
[42:56.800 --> 43:02.360]  and foreign governments and what it does is it actually puts by law NSA takedown
[43:02.360 --> 43:06.280]  hubs so they can take the web down or control it and that's admitted which
[43:06.280 --> 43:11.440]  then allows a foreign power or terrorist to actually go in and use the system to
[43:11.440 --> 43:15.760]  bring it down they're building the kill switch in the back doors in which then
[43:15.760 --> 43:20.520]  allow any criminal group the global issue name it to do it that's why the
[43:20.520 --> 43:24.640]  Obama's first head of cybersecurity resigned two years ago and pointed that
[43:24.640 --> 43:28.400]  out the center homeland security and governmental affairs committee held a
[43:28.400 --> 43:31.680]  hearing on the administration's legislative proposal announced two weeks
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.160]  ago that would rely on a pre-World War two radio emergency law provide the
[43:36.160 --> 43:39.400]  president with the authority to protect key computer communications networks
[43:39.400 --> 43:43.840]  like those mainly in private hands that run power grids phone systems banking
[43:43.840 --> 43:47.560]  systems from cyber attack yet they've gotten away from the lie of nuclear
[43:47.560 --> 43:52.480]  power plants they're not hooked up to the web and so we've got to do this
[43:52.480 --> 43:57.120]  the hackers all attack the nukes that they'll go in and detonate nukes inside
[43:57.120 --> 44:01.680]  military bases why they that's all hooked to the internet sure it is they're
[44:01.680 --> 44:05.480]  inside big vaults with guys with machine guns guarding them that's so
[44:05.480 --> 44:11.080]  ridiculous the Stuxnet that Israeli and US intelligence now admit they designed
[44:11.080 --> 44:15.120]  but they say we've got to give up our cybersecurity rights because of Stuxnet
[44:15.120 --> 44:18.160]  they launch it but then that's an example of why they need more power with
[44:18.160 --> 44:21.960]  the web because the US and Israel and concert made the Stuxnet it had to be
[44:21.960 --> 44:28.520]  injected by by Iranian moles that is moles controlled by the West and Iran
[44:28.520 --> 44:34.720]  into the the internal computer systems that by the way were bought from the
[44:34.720 --> 44:39.920]  West which is the back door it had to be injected with thumb drives into the
[44:39.920 --> 44:44.560]  internal networks it was not hooked to anything external but then they use
[44:44.560 --> 44:49.200]  Stuxnet see their nuclear system was brought down it's terrible we've got to
[44:49.200 --> 44:56.120]  have a takeover system here it was injected into networks that were private
[44:56.120 --> 44:59.400]  and under this cybersecurity plan that we've broken down with cybersecurity
[44:59.400 --> 45:03.360]  experts it's all in black and white it actually puts hubs in the
[45:03.360 --> 45:12.600]  infrastructure so the system can hijack the power plants hijack all cell
[45:12.600 --> 45:18.160]  phones all smartphones all computers all dishers dryers light bulbs the
[45:18.160 --> 45:21.800]  fluorescence are built for data over power lines to go in and control those
[45:21.800 --> 45:27.160]  you can't make this up smart meters in your house for your power this is a
[45:27.160 --> 45:32.480]  total technological takeover and the best part is you pay for it when you buy
[45:32.480 --> 45:38.400]  the devices you pay in the added cost for that big brother hidden tax that the
[45:38.400 --> 45:42.480]  companies are mandated to put in so I've got that report sent to base
[45:42.480 --> 45:46.480]  presidential power and cyberattack Fed sees eight more domains and privacy

[46:19.600 --> 46:24.720]  your car how fast you drive what you did what went on and they use it to charge

[46:28.400 --> 46:31.360]  out you run off the road and there's cases they go ahead and charge you with

[46:52.080 --> 46:56.640]  body scanner but droids and I guess stormtroopers shout orders at you so
[46:56.640 --> 47:00.440]  it's a fun for the kids to learn how to be slaves in the Empire but after all
[47:00.440 --> 47:05.720]  Darth Vader was just trying to keep us safe of course was the blowing up of the
[47:05.720 --> 47:10.560]  Death Star and inside job I mean do you really believe 12 guys with X wings could
[47:10.560 --> 47:14.440]  do it only in Hollywood folks that's what I mean it's ridiculous it's all
[47:14.440 --> 47:23.600]  fantasy okay that's just some of the news I've got here I spent about an hour
[47:23.600 --> 47:28.120]  last night watching different newscasts from around Texas because in the first
[47:28.120 --> 47:35.400]  six months of these reports coming out there were no reports in the news of
[47:35.400 --> 47:42.440]  where the radium and other radioactive isotopes at high levels were coming from
[47:42.440 --> 47:50.160]  and because it's in water districts all over Texas and only a few of the TV
[47:50.160 --> 47:55.560]  stations one of them in central Texas reported that out of the aquifers were
[47:55.560 --> 48:00.680]  drinking out of they are claiming that that's where the radium and other
[48:00.680 --> 48:08.960]  isotopes are at levels so high that it pegs the Geiger counters and I did some
[48:08.960 --> 48:13.880]  more research last night turns out there's no known deposits of radium in
[48:13.880 --> 48:21.160]  whales that high and and and they were wondering in some of the newscast why
[48:21.160 --> 48:26.680]  the radiation isn't as high it's low in the in the whole country water naturally
[48:26.680 --> 48:31.920]  some of it that's one isotope there's a bunch of them they were wondering why it
[48:31.920 --> 48:36.000]  was so high in the pipes and they were putting Geiger counters up to city pipes
[48:36.000 --> 48:40.240]  it was just a few years old in several towns outside Austin and the Geiger
[48:40.240 --> 48:47.160]  counter was was going wild at two times six times 14 times 20 20 times depending
[48:47.160 --> 48:51.840]  on which pipe they tested and they were saying oh it must be precipitating out
[48:51.840 --> 48:57.240]  and calcifying at higher levels in the pipe and that could certainly happen but
[48:57.240 --> 49:01.760]  no one's pointing out all the published literature and Dr. Connett's book and
[49:01.760 --> 49:07.200]  and the admissions that in the sodium fluoride that we buy from China that we
[49:07.200 --> 49:10.040]  buy from Florida other big areas where they mined this out of the phosphate
[49:10.040 --> 49:14.400]  mines and fertilizer that it that's that's where the deposits of a wide
[49:14.400 --> 49:19.320]  range of isotopes and if you read the suppressed state reports in Texas this
[49:19.320 --> 49:25.800]  is going on other states it goes back for decades on 2001 they were talking
[49:25.800 --> 49:29.520]  about it suppressed for decades the radioactive isotopes but they're not
[49:29.520 --> 49:33.720]  discussing the fact see they're scapegoating that oh well there's some
[49:33.720 --> 49:38.280]  radium which they can give off the guess the rate on gas there's some radium in
[49:38.280 --> 49:42.520]  Texas water which is certainly very bad for you give you a really nice case of
[49:42.520 --> 49:48.240]  liver cancer kidney cancer bladder cancers with the big one bone cancer
[49:48.240 --> 49:52.680]  precipitates out in the bones that's certainly part of it but they're now
[49:52.680 --> 49:57.520]  scapegoating that is the only place you're getting it and not dare point
[49:57.520 --> 50:03.960]  out that I'm telling you folks people inside water treatment plants around
[50:03.960 --> 50:10.800]  America if you'll just get a certified $300 Geiger counter and if you'll go
[50:10.800 --> 50:16.600]  into your pipes and if you'll go into the bags of fluoride or with the liquid
[50:16.600 --> 50:20.240]  type you get the tanks of it and you put your Geiger counter up to that all you
[50:20.240 --> 50:24.040]  got to do is go up when nobody's there at work this is I guess industrial
[50:24.040 --> 50:27.400]  sabotage homeland security says you're not supposed to I guess don't don't let
[50:27.400 --> 50:31.280]  us know that there's uranium or plutonium because it would be terrorism in
[50:31.280 --> 50:35.480]  the water to actually save people but just go up and I guarantee you people do
[50:35.480 --> 50:39.120]  this at water treatment plants you go up to those bags of fluoride it's going to
[50:39.120 --> 50:43.280]  be off the chart radiation and and and I think that's by the way we have the
[50:43.280 --> 50:47.520]  newscast showing them with the city water pipes so that's coming up later
[50:47.520 --> 50:51.800]  I'm gonna take two segments of your phone calls John Mike, Mary, Tony, Cameron, then
[50:51.800 --> 50:56.040]  Webster Tarp was coming up at eight after next hour prisonplanet.tv and
[50:56.040 --> 50:59.160]  FullWars.com stay with us
[51:02.360 --> 51:07.640]  Alex Jones here with key information the US government is a Ponzi scheme that
[51:07.640 --> 51:10.960]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[51:10.960 --> 51:16.280]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[51:16.280 --> 51:21.280]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling
[51:21.280 --> 51:25.280]  them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about 70
[51:25.280 --> 51:29.560]  percent of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our
[51:29.560 --> 51:33.320]  friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar
[51:33.320 --> 51:37.000]  will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their
[51:37.000 --> 51:42.240]  incomes and savings destroyed I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up

[53:01.960 --> 53:05.840]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic
[53:05.840 --> 53:09.480]  Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become
[53:09.480 --> 53:13.320]  more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and
[53:13.320 --> 53:17.160]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[53:17.160 --> 53:20.720]  our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of
[53:20.720 --> 53:26.200]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless

[53:30.240 --> 53:34.240]  these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get

[53:43.480 --> 53:54.560]  877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds
[53:54.560 --> 54:00.480]  are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[54:13.960 --> 54:17.520]  coming up towards the end of the third hour I'm gonna play some of those local
[54:17.520 --> 54:23.760]  newscast showing the Geiger counters on the city water pipes and I mean
[54:23.760 --> 54:29.160]  radiation is so high that it actually pushes the needles very low levels of
[54:29.160 --> 54:33.200]  radiation over time build up in the body and will kill you if it's high enough
[54:33.200 --> 54:38.640]  to actually have the needles going wild I mean you're talking incredibly high
[54:38.640 --> 54:45.080]  levels and it's all over Texas there's no national news on this it's always
[54:45.080 --> 54:50.760]  local news that will report it you have to understand it's being added to the
[54:50.760 --> 54:54.000]  water that's one of the main sources yes there's some radioactive isotopes in
[54:54.000 --> 54:59.240]  some aquifers because they're limestone aquifers in Texas where do you mine
[54:59.240 --> 55:07.080]  phosphates for aluminum or the the materials left over from aluminum
[55:07.080 --> 55:11.120]  smelting where do you mine the phosphates for the fertilizer industry
[55:11.120 --> 55:16.440]  limestone deposits and so that's the big issue and when I continue to push
[55:16.440 --> 55:20.280]  hoping that these investigative reporters go pick up this information
[55:20.280 --> 55:24.840]  and put it out in the national media so we can reverse these isotopes being
[55:24.840 --> 55:29.080]  added to the water let's go ahead and talk to John in North Carolina John
[55:29.080 --> 55:35.640]  you're on the air hi Alex how you doing pretty good yeah hey I'm a military I
[55:35.640 --> 55:42.600]  woke up when I was halfway through deployment in 2009 and they used to
[55:42.600 --> 55:47.720]  tell us some things that just didn't quite make sense and like they and we
[55:47.720 --> 55:51.840]  didn't notice it at the time but towards the end we we realized something was up
[55:51.840 --> 55:56.200]  but um what type of things were they telling you they were they were telling
[55:56.200 --> 56:00.240]  us that there were Iranian snipers in sector well how would they know they
[56:00.240 --> 56:05.440]  were Iranian unless they caught these guys um they were telling us that we
[56:05.440 --> 56:11.000]  were gonna go make um payments out to some of the um higher-ranking sheeps in
[56:11.000 --> 56:17.320]  the area to help with our um humanitarian aid and to build a rapport
[56:17.320 --> 56:20.880]  with the locals well we were handing out the payments the cash payments they
[56:20.880 --> 56:23.640]  were in cash I had double bags of like three hundred thousand dollars on my
[56:23.640 --> 56:27.480]  back and I would go to the town hall and hand over this money no questions asked
[56:27.480 --> 56:32.520]  and um and I feel so bad for doing it and I realized that's on record you know a
[56:32.520 --> 56:36.680]  lot of that money was to actually pay for attacks on American soldiers that's
[56:36.680 --> 56:41.360]  been confirmed yeah well and it was paid for they said it was for road
[56:41.360 --> 56:44.920]  improvement and I thought they meant you know building street lights and and
[56:44.920 --> 56:49.560]  they meant IEDs you see sir you've just stumbled into it what is full spectrum
[56:49.560 --> 56:53.560]  dominance really mean if you truly dominate everything you you control the
[56:53.560 --> 56:57.840]  enemy and you control the counter force which is your excuse to stay in
[56:57.840 --> 57:03.080]  country and pump the trillions in I'm sorry I'm sorry please continue yeah
[57:03.080 --> 57:06.760]  you're exactly right if they can't fight back then you don't really have to beat
[57:06.760 --> 57:10.840]  them now but I don't want to put words in your mouth is that what you were
[57:10.840 --> 57:15.280]  about to say it is that yeah you're exactly right you're exactly I maybe
[57:15.280 --> 57:18.280]  covered this a while back but I didn't know that but yeah that does wrote that
[57:18.280 --> 57:22.480]  road improvement was to make the roads safer we were paying them off not to
[57:22.480 --> 57:27.640]  blow us up so we're running around doing patrols looking for the bad guys and we
[57:27.640 --> 57:32.240]  would do a quote-unquote humanitarian aid mission and hand over money to the
[57:32.240 --> 57:36.280]  bad guys quote-unquote maybe they were the bad guys you know maybe they were I'm
[57:36.280 --> 57:40.680]  not maybe not the guy specifically in the room with me but and then we'd
[57:40.680 --> 57:44.800]  hand the money over to them and you know hard days work and six months into it
[57:44.800 --> 57:49.560]  we were like when are they gonna fix you damn roads like and they never did
[57:49.560 --> 57:54.200]  luckily we also never got blown out now you understand though that was only one
[57:54.200 --> 57:59.080]  level of full spectrum dominance when you start paying people off to not bomb
[57:59.080 --> 58:02.520]  you they're gonna come back later and hold you hostage and start bombing again
[58:02.520 --> 58:08.400]  until the payments return and the people doing the bombing think they're in
[58:08.400 --> 58:12.200]  control but the psych warfare chiefs understand that means that whenever they
[58:12.200 --> 58:17.080]  want to initiate destabilization again as a pretext to stay they simply stop
[58:17.080 --> 58:21.840]  making the payments you understand how that works that makes a lot of sense
[58:21.840 --> 58:27.760]  I can see that any other stories you want to tell us about Iraq
[58:27.760 --> 58:35.680]  my um no not not really not really um not too much I can say I'm still in the
[58:35.680 --> 58:40.480]  military um hold on just a second we're back in one minute
[58:43.120 --> 58:51.520]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.520 --> 58:55.240]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.240 --> 58:59.040]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.040 --> 59:03.520]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.520 --> 59:07.760]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:07.760 --> 59:12.400]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.400 --> 59:16.360]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:16.360 --> 59:20.520]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[59:20.520 --> 59:24.480]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:24.480 --> 59:28.640]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:28.640 --> 59:32.400]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[59:32.400 --> 59:36.080]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[59:36.080 --> 59:42.080]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[59:42.080 --> 59:46.640]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call

[59:51.680 --> 01:00:06.000]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:13.280]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:21.160]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:31.440]  and
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:53.920]  all right folks I forget that we had a one minute break there I was taking care
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:59.880]  of some business they're in the break I guess going back to the callers here
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:04.640]  John North Carolina you called in currently in the military you had one
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:09.960]  more thing you wanted to add go ahead yeah um so I got a story about the is
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:13.240]  involved the police state which we were talking about for the better party show
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:21.800]  um this morning um yeah when we got back me and a couple of my roommates were you
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.120]  know me and a couple of guys had deployed with we were living together and
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:27.720]  uh and you know we got we got like the don't fair only flags like we're all
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:32.160]  about you know going back to the roots that America was built on and not this
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:36.240]  whole empire of America thing because it's getting a little out of control and
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:41.640]  uh well not a little but you know and so anyway there was an incident and they
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.440]  needed to search the house I'm not gonna discuss the incident because it's still
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:48.480]  in court and I'm not allowed to but there's an incident and I can but I can
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:52.880]  talk about my involvement because I was clear there's an incident and um they
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.640]  searched the house and they saw you know that the don't try only flags and then
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:04.440]  the join or die flags and and we had our state flags up and um and we had uh you
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:09.440]  know a copy the Constitution hanging oh they thought they thought I'm not I'm
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.880]  not kidding I didn't you know I I was a little skeptical about some of the things
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.680]  you said about it I'm sure there were some isolated incidents but when it
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.760]  happened to me who it it struck it cut deep and especially since I was a
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:23.240]  soldier I couldn't believe it so they were here you are swearing an oath to a
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:29.360]  Constitution and you like your state and and and you're proud of the founding
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:34.800]  flags of this country and they thought they'd found Al Qaeda I guess that I
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.800]  you'd think because they do they they they rolled in hard like we used to
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:43.600]  roll into some of the houses in Iraq and I invited them into my house like I
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:48.320]  signed the you know the release to search the house and and um at least my
[01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:52.040]  part of the house is the expectation of privacy clauses for the other individuals
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:57.120]  that were paying rent but um they uh yeah they saw these flags they were
[01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.160]  taking pictures of everything they they saw the the flood the state flag of
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.360]  Maryland they were like why do you have a German flag hanging in your room and
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:08.960]  I'm like that's not a German flag and now this is the FBI you think the guy
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:12.400]  would have you know at least work near Maryland at some point in his career and
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.040]  and I was like that's that's a flag of Maryland and he's like is it and I'm
[01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.200]  like of course no you're in a file is having a German flag but see this is
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:25.160]  what America's all about the borders are wide open but citizens that are truly
[01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:28.960]  patriotic you're the enemy because the globalists are here to get rid of the
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.360]  Republic they are the real traders so of course if they see somebody that knows
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.840]  the score their minions have been trained you're the enemy right and I had
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:43.840]  um I had all these books about um continuity the um not continuity
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:47.640]  of government uh u.s. government and uh like basically textbooks and I was
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:51.760]  reading about like what are our students are currently no no no there's
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.240]  nothing worse than actually being informed oh I bet they got some book
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:59.840]  reading though they found those oh wait till I get to the firearms and uh yeah
[01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.280]  they they they did not like the books they were they were accusing me of the
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.120]  books and I'm like hey like you know freedom of the press like I can read
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.960]  whatever I want and only it's not how to blow up American soldiers like then I
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:15.400]  could understand you'd have a problem and they they were just freaking out and
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:21.960]  um and uh and then uh I had a couple of um firearms in my room you know because

[01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:16.680]  there's a war on for your mind if you just joined us we had a caller John from
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:21.080]  North Carolina and I got his name and number I I might even have him on as a
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:26.400]  guest in the future if he gives us the documentation of the story he told but
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:31.960]  he described how you know he's in the army off base and you know they're all
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:37.640]  you know together off base living in a house you know pooling the resources
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.600]  running it as most military does and the first thing you want to do is get off
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.200]  base yes you can have your own place and they rated them for guns and they were
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:54.880]  legal guns and they had the cold pepper minute man flag don't tread on me which
[01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:59.360]  the Marine Corps their favorite and the army some of their units have it I mean
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:03.880]  what do you think the military is gonna have I mean if you go back to even 50
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.920]  years ago at Fort Benning Georgia I've seen photographs of that flag flying in
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:14.120]  special forces I know that it was one of the favorite flags in fact a joint
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:19.600]  chiefs of staff up until just a few decades ago had it in their war room so
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.800]  you've got this pure piece of Americana it's funny he mentioned it I'm wearing it
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:31.240]  today info wars.com you know we sell one with a Thomas Jefferson quote on the
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:36.760]  back talking about the Tree of Liberty being watered with the blood of
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:42.960]  tyrants as well as patriots and they come into his house and the head army
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:47.880]  investigator a woman was hyperventilating basically you know going
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:52.400]  oh my gosh they've got you know cold pepper flags they've got firearms these
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.920]  are obviously illegal and he said earlier you know obviously they weren't
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:00.040]  and the whole case got dropped and here they come and I see those reports all
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.240]  the time were generally it's an old man in a suburb cleaning his guns in his
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:09.560]  garage and the cops come and that it'll say Mr. Johnson was arrested for an
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:13.320]  arsenal and then a week later you notice that he's released because there's no
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:18.880]  law saying what an arsenal is but he had three rifles a handgun and a thousand
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:26.560]  rounds of ammo if that's an arsenal folks I've probably got 15 or more guns I
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.880]  mean I love them I got guns my dad gave me grandpa gave me people die they pass
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:36.720]  them down I mean I like guns people have more than that it's a good investment
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.760]  about to go to Webster Tarple here in a moment I just wanted to finish with with
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:45.000]  with what John was talking about but in my film road to tyranny I don't just
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.680]  have FEMA training police that anybody who likes the founding fathers is a
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:53.520]  terrorist the founding fathers are bad anybody that talks about freedoms bad I
[01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:59.200]  have the training manuals video of it I have Abby Newman in Virginia no criminal
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.840]  record Navy veteran and they pull her over but the checkpoint and she says
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.760]  well you've got to have a reason broad daylight checkpoint on the little farm
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:11.480]  road there's cars all lined up they're searching them she says you can't search
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.440]  my car and they say get out we'll do whatever we want and they find a
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:19.680]  Harrison Ford Patriot Games VHS well then the hyperventilating starts the
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:24.280]  word Patriot Harrison Ford anything associated with liberty they start
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:29.480]  getting scared they pop the trunk and they go it's on video ought to play it
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:35.600]  and they go sir and the sergeant runs over he's like my god I literally I
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:40.880]  cannot believe it and you thought they found a dead child pocket Constitution
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:46.760]  the one we put free in all our orders I mean Declaration of Independence
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:51.520]  Constitution Bellarites what these guys swore enough to and they go I can't
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:56.320]  believe it is it legal to have this serge he's like I don't know but Lord
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:03.880]  call in this paraphernalia and they just sit there in fear I mean as if they have
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:10.760]  found Satan in the trunk these are grown men with a irrational fear impregnated
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:15.160]  in them because they're told impregnated in their minds they're told in drill
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:20.320]  out for drill they want to kill you officers they like George Washington and
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:24.320]  and they're like George Washington evil I mean I have the video of this this is
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:28.280]  in road to tyranny it's free online you get the DVD from us if you want it higher
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:32.760]  quality and and and they are just no wonder they won't hire a police with
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:37.400]  over a hundred IQ anywhere in the US I mean these guys they teach them this
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:41.440]  Pavlovian like telling a three-year-old you know do what you say or the monsters
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.840]  are gonna get you I mean they are and so he was describing the same thing where
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:54.280]  she's just like we found the terrorist and these are guys in the
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:59.080]  military now remember the number one threat Homeland Security is taught this
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:02.080]  came out the Mayak and Homeland Security reports of now two years ago is
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:07.080]  veterans returning veterans are hated they're put on the no-gun buy list
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:11.200]  outside of law they go and try to buy guns suddenly can't hundreds of thousands
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:15.400]  of them started with Clinton and you are hated so so remember that and cops
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.600]  you're hated too in the future police stages like under Hitler and Stalin when
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:23.080]  they're done with you they're gonna set you up as well so you better understand
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.400]  this is the cult mentality of the globalist to teach police to teach
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:34.240]  military to teach them that anybody who is a true American and knows what this
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:41.800]  country's about I mean I have cops they police hyperventilating in fear like a
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.400]  little old lady that opens the back door and there's a rattlesnake you know on
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:49.600]  the back porch they act like they found a rattlesnake in the back of the car and
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:56.760]  they go ahead and take her to jail they they grab her and she says oh like she
[01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:01.000]  scared she doesn't touch him and they go resisting and they're all like we got
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.800]  her we and so they went ahead and framed her on their own squad car video
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.560]  I don't like the new video out of Chicago where the guys in a wheelchair they
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:13.520]  say get up he says I can't and so they just grab him taking two men slam his
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:18.320]  head repeatedly in the concrete blood is spraying out and the cops put out a
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:21.880]  press release the day after the video came out NBC News and said he fell and
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:26.440]  hit his head I mean on video they're bouncing his head on the ground like a
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:36.560]  like a basketball and then say he fell and hit his head see it's all about their
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:40.760]  wolves we're sheep savage and and all cops aren't like this but they're trying
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.240]  to convert to that now I'm gonna shut up and go to Webster Griffin Tarpley but I
[01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.760]  wanted to finish up with what that gentleman was bringing up there a bunch
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:52.520]  of hyperventilating ninnies who are terrorist hunters he said they rolled in
[01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:56.080]  like we were like we'd roll in in Baghdad well you that's what the training's
[01:14:56.080 --> 01:15:01.200]  all for Bubba so you can come back here and roll in on the American people see
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.760]  it's al-qaeda over there it's patriots over here are the white al-qaeda
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:10.000]  according to them Webster Griffin Tarpley is an incisive critic of the
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.800]  Anglo-American hegemony and activist and historian best known for his book
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.560]  George Bush the unauthorized biography he's written several books on Obama the
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:22.640]  unauthorized biography partly.net we've got him on for the rest of the hour we'll
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:26.480]  also get to a smattering of your calls and whatever issue they are Mike, Mary,
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.800]  Tony, Richard, James, I'll get to you Jerome Corsi coming up on the latest
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.600]  birther issues we'll get Tarpley's take on that as well but Webster you wrote
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.000]  this key article US and Pakistan near open war you've had the US helicopter
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.600]  attack inside Pakistan after they've been lauding thing last week these
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:49.760]  al-caida commandos attacking this base yesterday we've got Pakistan openly in
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:55.800]  their major papers saying yes al-qaeda is CIA run now Pakistan's running to China
[01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.560]  and Russia Hamid Ghul's come on the former head of Pakistani intelligence
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:04.920]  basically concurred with what you're saying here any attack on Pakistan will
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:09.320]  be construed as an attack on China the Chinese government has now said this is
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:12.960]  what you talked about six months ago on this show as where you saw the next
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:17.320]  flare-up happening in the Brzezinski model dr. Tarpley we're going to break
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:20.600]  in four minutes you've got the floor break down what's happening well thank
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:24.760]  you Alex I guess the the current situation is the following the US and
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.600]  Pakistan are moving towards an open shooting war there has long been a
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:33.720]  latent war a war going on at a very low level but this is now escalating towards
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:38.600]  something much bigger and more visible and it has to do with this insistence of
[01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.320]  Obama and his man on the scene now Grossman the guy who replaced Holbrook
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.800]  the regional envoy that they can violate the Pakistani border anytime they want
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.840]  to without consulting or even informing the Pakistani government they can make
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:57.480]  these unauthorized raids all on the model of this bin Laden stunt which I
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:02.200]  guess we've amply established now is a complete fraud from beginning to end so
[01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:06.080]  the big news though is that Pakistan does not stand alone and that behind
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.760]  Pakistan which is already a nuclear power you've got China and with China
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:14.680]  you're talking about intercontinental ballistic missiles with hydrogen bomb
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:19.560]  warheads you're also talking about two to three trillion dollars worth of US
[01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:23.000]  securities that could be used as a strategic weapon in its own right if
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:29.160]  things got really really extreme the news is according to the Times of India
[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:34.700]  that the Chinese have issued this ultimatum they did it in a typical low-key
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:39.760]  rather polite Chinese way it was done privately it was done during the US
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:44.680]  Chinese strategic dialogue here in Washington two weeks ago would have
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:50.320]  been delivered by Vice Prime Minister Wang Qishan and it essentially was the
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:55.760]  Chinese saying to the United States any attack by the United States on Pakistan
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:01.240]  would be construed as an attack on China so if you attack Pakistan you're
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:05.880]  attacking China you follow with Islamabad you've got grief with with
[01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.240]  Beijing and that is a language of ultimatum that we have not heard the
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:14.640]  last time I can find that anybody issued an ultimatum to the United States was
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:21.160]  Khrushchev in 1961 the Soviet leader during the Cuban missile crisis and
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:25.760]  during the Berlin crisis which was when this was the ultimatum was get out of
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:31.480]  Berlin in six months or else something this is but is much more specific it's
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:36.000]  quite quite unusual for the US to be on the receiving end in public and
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:42.320]  officially the Chinese Foreign Ministry said last Thursday that everyone must
[01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:49.280]  and that's must respect the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Pakistan
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:53.480]  so don't attack them and don't try to break them up and break them up is what
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:59.120]  the United States is doing as a token of the seriousness of the China-Pakistan
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:04.160]  alliance when the Pakistani Prime Minister Gilani visited Beijing last
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.800]  week he was given a rather rather imposing gift he was given 50 that's
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:17.760]  five zero of the most modern Chinese jet fighter aircraft this is the JF-17 and
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.400]  he was given 50 of them for free and right away so essentially enough to
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:27.120]  staff a whole air fleet this is an ultra gigantic escalation we're gonna come
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:30.720]  back Webster you will continue to have the floor to break down with the
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.800]  precision that only you can deliver and I mean that because Webster six months
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:38.920]  ago laid all this out exactly how it would unfold the color revolutions in
[01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:42.280]  the Middle East I mean go back and watch those shows listen to those shows
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:48.000]  they're all archived at prisonplanet.tv nobody's got a grasp on the geopolitical

[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:43.680]  okay Webster Griffin Tarpley China their government as you mentioned this week
[01:24:43.680 --> 01:24:48.000]  and last week put out official statements quote an attack on Packers
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:52.720]  Stanley be construed as an attack on China China made good even when they
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:57.060]  didn't have nuclear weapons during the Korean War of to ready to have war full
[01:24:57.060 --> 01:25:00.760]  war with the US they were in North Korea killed tens of thousands of our
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.520]  troops China is well known by every geopolitical strategist I want to see if
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:09.000]  you agree that if they tell you that they're going to do something they will
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.440]  do it and they are not to be messed with and they see this in their sphere of
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:18.600]  influence what does this signify that we have these cold wars that are really
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:23.360]  hot under the name of humanitarian bombings and Libya Pakistan the
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:27.000]  Pakistanis now in their major papers and the head of their Pakistani
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.800]  intelligence the current head coming out and saying yes the bin Laden thing has
[01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:36.720]  meant to frame us yes the West is running al-qaeda inside here to try to
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:40.920]  blame it on our government to start a war I mean I don't think folks understand
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:47.160]  this isn't Iraq or even Iran this is a nuclear power that fought India with
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.840]  three-to-one superiority to a standstill these people will fight are highly
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:57.440]  motivated tarp Lee I think it's an example of you the use of irregular
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:03.640]  warfare guerrilla warfare or terrorism beneath the nuclear threshold that the
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:08.080]  problem the United the imperialists who run this country have always had with
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:12.480]  Pakistan is that they can't attack Pakistan directly because as you say
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.760]  it's a nuclear power you can't have a direct military attack they can they
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:21.320]  can respond so what you've got to do is this subversion terrorism guerrilla
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:26.280]  warfare irregular warfare below the nuclear threshold they think but of
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:30.560]  course the problem is that it always threatens to jump up above the nuclear
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:34.800]  threshold it's also worth remembering the way the United States got in there
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:40.280]  was by an ultimatum to Pakistan this was in September October 2001 right right
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:45.080]  after 9-11 Bush called up the the president of Pakistan time Musharraf and
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:51.000]  said guess what if you don't let us use your country for transit into Afghanistan
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.880]  we will bomb you and Musharraf said okay fine you can come in the US was not
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:01.680]  invited they basically invaded Pakistan at that time as well as Afghanistan so
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.440]  what you've got now is a pattern where the US according to the British press
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:13.400]  the the United States the CIA plus the Indians the RAW the raw the research and
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:18.880]  analysis wing plus the Mossad have created their own fake counter gang
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:24.600]  Taliban inside Pakistan so it's something that looks like that the
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:29.480]  Taliban it sounds and by the way at the Mumbai attack what three years ago it
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:33.080]  later came out in the Chicago Tribune even mainstream papers that it was true
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:38.960]  a CIA operative commanded the so-called people attacking and the only Patsy they
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:43.600]  grabbed this was an AP was on three different hallucinogens and didn't know
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:47.400]  who he was and the head of Indian intelligence said that the West did it
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:53.040]  but then he was killed that same day so so that was a black up yes and that guy
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.480]  David Headley has just been on on CBS Evening News last night he's
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:01.280]  testifying at a trial where he goes through this whole spiel the the
[01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:07.320]  Pakistanis did it the ISI did it and this is a DEA CIA agent informant
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:12.000]  whatever he is telling you all these things it's crazy but the the
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.920]  Taliban counter gang now what do they do you have to look at the pattern of
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:23.240]  terrorism inside Pakistan is dictated by a by a military agenda for example they
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:28.800]  kill a Saudi diplomat when you kill a Saudi diplomat in Pakistan you're
[01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:35.040]  attacking that Saudi Pakistan axis that was set up by Prince Bondar during his
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:40.040]  visit to Pakistan at the end of March they set up this mutual assistance pact
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:45.320]  basically if the US tries to overthrow the Saudi royal family with a color
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:50.200]  revolution or a push the Pakistanis will send a division of troops to put
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:54.240]  down the color rebellion and the other thing is if the United States threatens
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:59.560]  the Saudis and says here do what we say or we will feed you to the Iranians at
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:04.240]  that point that the Saudis can invoke the Pakistani nuclear umbrella so this is
[01:29:04.240 --> 01:29:09.600]  one of the reasons the United States is so eager to get these Pakistani
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:15.000]  nukes are destroyed or else seized by the US so if you go after a diplomat
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.440]  you're attacking that axis here the big one just in the last couple of days
[01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:23.840]  after I wrote this article there's a big attack on the Faisal Air Force base
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:29.240]  in South Pakistan near the ocean now that happened yesterday stay there we're

[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:06.680]  Alex we now take you live to the central Texas Command Center in the heart of the
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:14.000]  resistance you're listening to the Alex Jones show by the way there's several
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:21.640]  new YouTube special video reports get a look at one of our new studios we've
[01:33:21.640 --> 01:33:29.920]  built over in the new building next door at info wars dot com and it is titled
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:36.560]  TSA launches groping at high school proms other public places key report
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:41.560]  terrorists may strike anywhere so security goons must be everywhere or so the
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:45.400]  logic goes and that's like a new New York law that's been introduced to have all
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:50.560]  the maids under law where panic buttons because men might rape them in any minute
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:55.440]  so under that logic if if any house in your city ever gets broken into well
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:59.760]  then we must have government security guards in every house and actually in
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:02.520]  England they're actually talking about trying to have cameras in all homes the
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.240]  Houston police chief did that a few years ago I mean it's this idea of we're
[01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:11.560]  taking over every facet of your life to keep you safe meanwhile this year so far
[01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:18.680]  how many people have died from tornadoes Heartland devastation the latest in the
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:27.280]  last two days 116 dead that hospital smashed x-rays blown 70 miles just
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:35.760]  absolutely incredible nearly 500 twisted deaths this year more dangerous days
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:42.760]  ahead we're gonna go back to Webster here in just a moment but I just wanted to
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:49.680]  point out here that government can't keep you safe and won't keep you safe look
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:52.520]  at Katrina look at all these other instances when they tell you they're
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.200]  doing something to keep you safe it's a joke it's now come out in the news that
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:00.000]  Texas for decades knew there were high levels of radioactive isotopes in the
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.720]  water and consciously covered it up well no kidding they add it one of the ways
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:10.120]  you get it through the fluoride because they're mining it out of phosphate
[01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:15.560]  mines that have high levels of radioactive isotopes it's incredible they
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:20.920]  don't care about you okay it's that simple and it's so crazy to try to tell
[01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:23.600]  you they're going to protect you and that you know they have all these
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:26.960]  systems to protect you going back to Webster continue with this build up

[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:13.880]  Tarpley doctor of history is also an economist you broke down six months ago
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:17.360]  I looked it up and we wrote articles at the time about it that the next target
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:22.880]  would be Pakistan with these with these secret armies unconventional warfare you
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:27.600]  were getting up to the attack on this secret airbase by Al Qaeda very
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:32.160]  professional going in now we've been hearing our military our military run
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:35.960]  by the globalist saying they were planning to maybe go into these bases
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:40.960]  and try to get nukes is this a probe to test security by the Al Qaeda forces
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:46.080]  that really work for the West we'll continue along that line Webster please
[01:37:46.080 --> 01:37:50.400]  continue well the the most recent event therefore is this attack on the Faisal
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:55.880]  Air Force Base which is also a naval air station in southern Pakistan it's as
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:38:00.320]  far away from the Taliban homeland as you can get and the targets that were
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:06.480]  specifically selected were these Orion anti-submarine aircraft which seemed to
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:12.560]  be therefore the incident seems to be designed to blind the Pakistanis in
[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:17.520]  terms of anti-submarine warfare so that would mean US submarines for example
[01:38:17.520 --> 01:38:22.760]  firing cruise missiles while submerged or Indian submarines firing cruise
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:27.320]  missiles or other things while submerged could be now you have an easier time in
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:31.720]  getting close to the to the the Pakistani coast so you look at what is
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:37.560]  supposed to be sort of blind terrorist actions by Taliban guerrilla fighters
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:41.120]  operating at a very low level of intelligence and it seems like the
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:45.600]  target selection procedure rather mirrors the need of a strategic attack
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:51.560]  against Pakistan so therefore if we look at it there's a plan revealed by Fox
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:56.960]  News back in 2009 and now repeated in the London Sunday Express this past
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:02.880]  Sunday that the Joint Special Operations Command when commanded by General
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:09.040]  Stanley McChrystal created this plan to seize the Pakistani nuclear forces the
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:15.720]  Pakistanis allegedly have 80 intermediate range ballistic missiles at this
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:21.680]  Sargodha Air Force Base this is sort of in the north north central part of the
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:25.960]  country not so far from about about whether with a pseudo bin Laden was
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:30.880]  supposedly finished off but the 80 nuclear missiles are there plus the F-16s
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:36.480]  that can carry nuclear bombs so the entire plan revolves around a raid
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:42.160]  right a lightning commando attack and assault with with the fields and so
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:48.560]  forth on this nuclear complex and the idea then go in quickly and disable the
[01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:52.840]  Pakistani nuclear weapons the British say through the Sunday Express that
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:58.160]  they're also part of it so it would be a joint US British raid into Pakistan to
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:02.720]  try to to seize and destroy these nuclear forces now that would mean that
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:06.960]  Pakistan would become relatively defenseless against an attack by India
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:11.680]  in the background this whole time in May there has been a special drill going
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:17.720]  on of one of the three Indian assault armies and it's a Blitzkrieg drill
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:23.360]  nuclear bacteriological and chemical that's going on in the far desert this
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:27.280]  is an area called North Rajasthan and I'm afraid you're gonna have to get as
[01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:32.080]  familiar with the geography of Pakistan and India as we've gotten with Iraq over
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:36.440]  the years so this is a this is a drill that would be designed to cut Pakistan
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:41.200]  in half in case of war and if the Pakistanis don't have nuclear forces
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:46.160]  they they can't defend themselves that seems to be what all of this revolves
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:51.200]  around now the scenario that has been developed is this it reminds us of this
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:57.560]  guy Ray Davis right the CIA contractor who was accused by the Pakistanis of
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:02.120]  killing two of their ISI agents and was then expelled after the State Department
[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:07.320]  screened bloody murder for weeks about this guy his task according to the
[01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:12.200]  Pakistani media also according to Russian reports people like this working
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:17.480]  for the CIA and there are 7,000 of them in Pakistan most of them unknown to the
[01:41:17.480 --> 01:41:24.160]  government what they're up to right now is getting control of atomic materials
[01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:28.800]  like nuclear waste stuff for a radiological dirty bomb or chemical or
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:34.200]  bacteriological biological and transferring those into the hands of
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:38.800]  the Taliban which could very well mean this Taliban counter gang that we've
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:43.480]  been talking about this pseudo Taliban created by the US the Indians and the
[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:49.840]  Israelis and then attacking a US post attacking something say in Afghanistan
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:54.440]  on that side of the border that would then be the pretext to say aha you
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:58.520]  Pakistanis are incapable of providing the security for your nuclear forces
[01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:04.000]  therefore we the US the British and others are going to seize them and that
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.520]  was the that was the yeah that's the scenario that was the attempt a month
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:12.160]  ago again to claim that the stuff's leaking out and being stolen and given
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:16.520]  to the L CIA to people now they're saying oh look Taliban is trying to get in to
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:20.840]  steal it we've now got to invade or threaten you to hand it over to us
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:26.360]  because you can't be trusted now here's the big shift I'm seeing Pakistan has
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:30.520]  gone from being you know basically going under the 10-year-old deal or 9-year-old
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:36.040]  deal that Perez Musharraf the dictator the admitted Western puppet put into
[01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:40.480]  place and the old puppet was brought back Benazir Budo she didn't play ball
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:46.480]  so she was executed in the street by Cheney connected people according to
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:54.160]  Pakistani intelligence now this is ongoing and this signifies the fact
[01:42:54.160 --> 01:42:59.480]  that Pakistan now realizes they're slated to be broken up regardless so
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:02.680]  they're desperately running to people they haven't been friendly with the
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:07.120]  Chinese to some extent the Russians that they really haven't been friendly
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:12.880]  with and so this signifies a massive program of destabilization has been
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:19.320]  executed you dovetail that with this incredible announcement this keeps
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:23.080]  happening Associated Press and of course they don't want Ahmed Denizide to look
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:28.160]  weak so the government's lying obviously blast hits Iranian refinery as
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:35.880]  Ahmed Denizide visits and so right as he arrives the plant blows up an explosion
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:41.800]  blamed on gas leak but Bush in 2008 put out a press release or 2007 admitting
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:47.480]  that they've got groups and special forces inside they're doing this that's
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:52.720]  policy and an explosion blamed on a gas leak rocked Iran's largest refinery on
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:56.600]  Tuesday around the time of a visit to the plant by President Machmoudat
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:44:01.640]  Denizide Iranian media reported that up to two people were killed the blast
[01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:06.280]  occurred just before Ahmed Denizide was to inaugurate an expansion project of
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:12.040]  the 400,000 barrel per day and notice they just signed a deal Iran did with
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:17.760]  Iraq for this natural gas and uh-uh no you're not it's gonna blow up and we'll
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:21.960]  do it while Ahmed Denizide's there you dovetail that I mean this is this soft
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:28.280]  kill low intensity warfare unconventional commando type stuff where
[01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:31.640]  they're really trying to start World War three right now that is the banks
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:35.400]  that have hijacked this country Libya British attack helicopters to be
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:40.040]  deployed seen as the next step to ground invasion EU lines up resolution to
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.640]  start ground invasion that they promised they wouldn't do a NATO hits
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:49.320]  Tripoli US says rebels can open office bombing begins of their shipyards eight
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:56.240]  eight warships sunk two days ago I mean this is going into high gear Webster I
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:59.880]  mean I mean are they are they launching some type of what I mean this this is
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:06.200]  scary I think it did shows that the the US British ruling elite has gone
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:10.800]  collectively insane and that they're in a war psychosis they're also in an
[01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:15.440]  austerity psychosis they're obsessed with the idea that the that the dollar and
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:20.320]  all of their derivatives are going down the drain and they're in a flight
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:24.760]  forward so this is a time of of tremendous irrationality the problem we
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:30.440]  have is that the general public remains unaware of most of these very very
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:35.040]  shocking and very very disturbing and scary events that primarily because the
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:40.600]  entire left opposition so-called peace movement and related people foundation
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:45.720]  funded in particular have essentially given up on opposing Obama they're
[01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:51.400]  they're not opposing their cheerleading wars in webster I mean let's
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:57.040]  let's back off from this for a moment look clearly it's the old thing of
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:01.120]  ramming the branch Davidian compounds saying come out where your friends and
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:04.360]  the Davidians run out and the flare footage shows the special forces
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:08.280]  shooting him or you watch a Hollywood movie like Mars the tax you know which is
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:12.360]  a joke on the Pentagon an archetype with the aliens running around saying don't
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:16.160]  run where your friends and the humans come out of their houses and the aliens
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:21.200]  laugh and shoot them Obama comes out and says where your friends Israel give
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.600]  back the land of the Palestinians and then a day later says look it was all
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:29.760]  just a Psyop they're saying don't run we are your friends Netanyahu's smiling
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:33.600]  about all this it's total theater as they launch the disintegration of the
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:36.400]  Middle East I mean this is hellish what they're doing
[01:46:36.400 --> 01:46:41.720]  on the other hand there is a pushback on June 15th there will be the meeting of
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:46.680]  the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and this of course is Russia China and the
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:53.640]  five Central Asian former Soviet Republics there ex-Soviet space and it's
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:47:01.760]  also got Iran and India as observers so if we can say behind Pakistan there now
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:07.400]  stands China we've also had signals from Russia Medvedev who is the soft line
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:11.680]  he's the weak side of the Russian establishment in his press conference
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:16.960]  last week Medvedev's line was we face a new cold war with the United States
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:21.320]  because of Obama's insistence on building the anti-ballistic missile
[01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:25.840]  systems in Romania Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe it's a new cold war
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:29.000]  and notice Obama said a year ago they weren't going to build the missiles it's
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.120]  all don't run where your friends and you lower your guard and they stab you he
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:38.200]  lied I guess that guy was right the one who shouted it out so we also president
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:42.400]  who of China in in meeting with some journalists looking forward to this
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.360]  meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization at the middle of next month
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:52.880]  he said our relations Chinese relations with Russia are at an all-time high they
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:58.560]  have never been better so behind Pakistan stands China behind China stands
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:02.360]  Russia that's pretty much the the breakdown but also don't forget this
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:07.480]  idea of the Pakistan Saudi alliance that is I think very real that's the
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:12.000]  it's the cause that the immediate reason why this is happening right now in this
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:18.560]  time frame and Bondar's Saudi diplomacy with Putin so it's beginning to coalesce
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:23.560]  into a coherent block of opposition I would appeal once again to India
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:29.160]  India is a very very ill-advised to stay in this US India nuclear deal it
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:33.560]  simply makes India into cannon fodder it makes India into the expendable
[01:48:33.560 --> 01:48:39.040]  continental dagger of the US sure a large land power to be used against China
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:42.640]  Russia and the globalist wreck them even more economically in the process and
[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:46.200]  then they go into more debt and the parasitic bankers get America more into
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.960]  debt and bankrupt us more but we get patriotic and this new giant war the
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:53.320]  Rand Corporation said they needed three years ago in that very area to quote
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.680]  get their new world order now we're not worried about the global bankers looting
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:01.120]  us because we're all patriotic as World War three has started now how do you see
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:07.640]  this program going what's the globalist next move then as they gallop for
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:14.240]  forward into this conflagration well they're very well ill-advised to do so
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:17.480]  right one of the ways you can tell they're really crazy is they want to
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:22.080]  attack at Pakistan even when their supply line goes through Pakistan the
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:27.440]  whole invading force inside Afghanistan depends on this port of Karachi to
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:32.280]  Khyber Pass a thousand mile land corridor which goes right through the
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:37.080]  middle of Pakistan and the Pakistani Parliament unanimously voted stop your
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:42.640]  predator drone attacks or we are going to cut that supply line for you now in
[01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:49.720]  terms of what's gonna happen again the scenario terror events that are directed
[01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:55.400]  against us forces or even against the Pakistanis themselves would be used as
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:00.440]  a pretext for Obama to come out and say with his unbelievable hypocrisy and
[01:50:00.440 --> 01:50:06.640]  and condescension you could say we see that these Pakistanis are incapable of
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:11.640]  maintaining the security of their nuclear forces therefore we're going to help
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:16.280]  them we're going to give them assistance and I've ordered the joint special
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:21.480]  operations command and the specific group is called task force orange task force
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:26.280]  orange would be that that group that did that bin Laden caper whatever that and
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:30.600]  so the invasion the invasion and occupation of the Pakistani bases will
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:34.920]  be don't run we're your friends your friends anybody says don't occupy us
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:40.160]  how dare the Pakistanis don't let us occupy them those savages oh but of
[01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:44.800]  course it's the most people in the world don't believe this anymore it would be
[01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:50.160]  we'd be good if the the SEO or people like this came out and and denounced this

[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:37.280]  telling only lies but my dreams you know I'm just a guy that lives in Austin
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:42.320]  Texas I got three wonderful children I love America our country's been an
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:47.280]  engine of good really until the 1960s and I know Tarpley's done analysis and
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:51.960]  agrees with that and we've gone from being this engine of good to really being
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:56.840]  the heart of this corrupt world government involved in just such
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:03.160]  duplicitous evil and it's all being done in our name and now our ally Pakistan
[01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:07.600]  their own governments had to come out and say Al Qaeda's run by you you're staging
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:12.320]  and all stop it don't attack us and China is standing by to have nuclear war
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:17.720]  with you if you try and we've got nukes and this is a big deal Webster to have
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:22.240]  the Chinese government come out and say an attack on Pakistan's an attack on us
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:25.640]  and a lot of good old boys are kind of like well let's get in the war that makes
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:30.480]  me feel manly ladies and gentlemen the Chinese have a billion four hundred
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:34.960]  million people they got thousands of nukes the traders that run our country
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:40.160]  have handed over our infrastructure to them rush is not playing games and look
[01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:44.360]  Russia is not on our border trying to get Mexico to attack us I mean the point
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:48.040]  is this isn't our government that's doing this this is this corporate elite
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:51.960]  and it's coming to a head I mean Webster there's no doubt they just tried to kill
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:55.360]  Ahmed Denigy blowing up this power plant while he was at it this gas plant
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:56:00.680]  they're now saying ground forces for Libya attack helicopters I mean can't
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:05.880]  folks see this is a giant Brzezinski in global destabilization program being
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:11.600]  launched well I have the idea that if you go back to the beginning that the
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:16.600]  time right before World War one you see something similar remember the Sarajevo
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:22.000]  assassinations were at the end of June of 1914 the war didn't really get going
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:28.360]  until the first week of August so you got this whole month of July 1914 and if
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:33.800]  you look at the literary materials that have come down to us from that time you
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:38.440]  see that European public opinion was in a dream it was in a trance it was in a
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:45.240]  an elegiac idyllic mood they probably sensed subconsciously that something
[01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:49.840]  horrendous was about to happen but this had not yet become conscious for a lot
[01:56:49.840 --> 01:56:54.200]  of people you look at the situation right now we're closer to a general war
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:56:59.480]  than we've been I guess since about 2007 since the high point of Bush Cheney
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:04.560]  and the rogue B-52 and the Kenny Bunkport warning at that time but right now
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:08.920]  we've got the differences we don't have a peace movement we don't have any
[01:57:08.920 --> 01:57:14.920]  opposition the people who used to oppose war there is their busy denouncing
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:19.600]  Gaddafi and supporting the attack on Libya or they're out there saying Obama
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:23.680]  is a better war monger than Bush and Cheney he's more effective he brings
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:30.120]  home the the you know he gets his man so this is a terrible situation so those
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:33.840]  of us who can understand this and your listeners in particular have to do
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:38.000]  everything possible to wake up public opinion in the United States we are
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:42.560]  drifting towards some kind of general war some kind of horrendous incident
[01:57:42.560 --> 01:57:47.560]  and we've got this lunatic ruling class we've got a bunch of incompetent
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:53.680]  bumbling utopian the people they're perfectly incompetent they they're not
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:58.000]  in a position to run the affairs of this country and unfortunately there's no
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.240]  visible organized alternative but at least the idea that the situation in
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:07.360]  the world's strategic sense is more serious more threatening than it has
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:11.800]  been in the past three or four years this idea we have to get across and above
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:18.120]  all don't believe false flag stories when it's pinned on Pakistan or so-called
[01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:22.640]  al-Qaeda but with the idea that that's really Pakistan yeah why on earth would
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:27.120]  Pakistan or anybody else carry out a 9-11 knowing that they would then be
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:30.720]  invaded and killed and overthrown it's like why would somebody jump in front
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:34.920]  of a truck it doesn't make sense right look at how they invaded Iraq saying
[01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:38.600]  they were involved in 9-11 Webster let's shift gears and get into Dominique
[01:58:38.600 --> 01:58:51.400]  Strauss con you are listening to GCN visit GCN live calm today a very wealthy
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:56.680]  US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:59:01.000]  America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything about our lives
[01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.000]  the way you shop travel invest educate your children and even how you take

[01:59:08.360 --> 01:59:12.760]  predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you see he
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:16.440]  predicted the collapse of GM Danny May Freddie Mac and America's biggest

[02:00:00.840 --> 02:00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:20.000]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:29.240]  Alex Jones there's a reason old-timers built storm sellers in the Midwest and
[02:00:29.240 --> 02:00:35.000]  each of any other area of tornadoes 500 deaths this year so far 116 dead in
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:40.360]  Joplin deadliest in half a century Obama says he'll get around to visiting on
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:46.600]  Sunday and the storm track it's up at dredgerport.com also get a link to
[02:00:46.600 --> 02:00:53.000]  storm track up on info wars.com live alert where it's moving towards a
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.320]  Minneapolis liquor store got hit and then got looted just a lot of bizarre
[02:00:58.320 --> 02:01:01.800]  news coming out on that front that preacher that said the world would end
[02:01:01.800 --> 02:01:08.520]  last Saturday he didn't mean May 21st he meant October 21st this guy's got to be
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:13.600]  got to be getting paid for this stuff I mean this is just ridiculous Webster
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:17.280]  finishing up what do you think of the Dominique Strauss con I mean I'm no
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:23.960]  fan of the globalist I'm no fan of this guy but more and more they released
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:28.280]  Sarkozy's top spin doctor and campaign people released on Twitter before he was
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:32.880]  even arrested the police had said they had the DNA evidence or that been leaked
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:39.400]  now it's admitted they don't have DNA evidence con I know it said the end of
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:43.160]  the dollar was near I mean what's going on here from your intel it is the CIA
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:47.000]  attack on the euro and we need to remember that all last year all of
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:53.720]  2010 was consumed with the US the CIA Goldman Sachs this idea dinner at
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:57.400]  Monès Crespi and Hart that was reported in the Wall Street Journal the
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:01.560]  attack on the euro you can't make the dollar look good but what you can do is
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:05.960]  make the euro look very very bad you can attack Greece you can attack Portugal
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:11.600]  Ireland Spain other countries you can use credit default swaps for economic
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:18.320]  warfare try to export the depression from the US to to Europe so Strauss con
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:23.920]  now he's the head of the IMF he's why he wants to be president of France so his
[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:29.360]  task was to keep the euro together until he could become president of France
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:34.080]  minimally that that would mean something that the the US Wall Street and
[02:02:34.080 --> 02:02:38.840]  of course Wall Street runs the CIA couldn't accept so they had to launch
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:43.600]  some kind of an attack what it shows by the way is the desperation of imperialism
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:49.000]  they're knocking over assets that they've used for 10 20 30 years right they
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.720]  they put 15 years of work into building the bin Laden myth now they announce these
[02:02:53.720 --> 02:02:58.680]  debt they have Mubarak in power for 30 years then they decide to overthrow him
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:03.400]  the power-sharing deal on the International Monetary Fund is really
[02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:08.920]  about 60 years old 60 to 65 years old it's that traditionally the head of the
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:14.600]  World Bank is from the US and the head of the IMF is from Europe and Europe has
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:19.520]  meant about half of the time I think we've had four French bosses of the IMF
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:25.120]  one German so that's about half of the almost half of the 12 IMF heads you've
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:32.000]  also had people from from countries like the the Dutch or or Sweden or other
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  places but generally it's it's intended to gravitate toward France Germany the
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.520]  two leading countries on the on the continent so that's a power-sharing
[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:43.920]  agreement that basically says we're going to merge the old European
[02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:48.400]  imperialism's with this Anglo-American as you said several years ago this melt
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:52.400]  down on the global financial system instituted by the mega banks they
[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:57.720]  intend to come out on the end to completely dominant and and so that
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:03.960]  this this upheaval would would would be purposefully accelerated during this
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:07.720]  period and we're entering this incredible period of dangerous change but
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:12.800]  it also shows it's really not globalism it's really Anglo-American US British
[02:04:12.800 --> 02:04:17.080]  imperialism there's no place at the table for anybody who's going to represent
[02:04:17.080 --> 02:04:21.720]  a French interest or a German interest or a European interest first it was
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:26.600]  going to be stop with the Europeans now get a third world puppet get somebody
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:30.720]  from the developing sector get some British agent from someplace in Africa
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:34.920]  or something like this now it seems to be this woman lagarde and the guard is
[02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:39.080]  the most the most Britishized Americanized in the whole French
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:43.000]  government if Strascon was lonely he could have called up the earlier

[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:27.960]  and and dr. course he is always very careful and so when he writes a book
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:32.720]  saying where's the birth certificate by the way available at info wars.com if
[02:09:32.720 --> 02:09:36.800]  folks want to get it excellent hard copy with all the exhibits and documents you
[02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:40.480]  find out this guy isn't who he says he is he's covering up his history they
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:44.360]  released that other birth certificate receipt said that was the long form
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:48.720]  nothing else existed governor abacromby couldn't find it when he went into the
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:52.920]  stacks and tried to then magically it appeared then breaking here last Friday
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:58.600]  dr. course he went over the fact that he believes he knows who did it and then
[02:09:58.600 --> 02:10:04.140]  now he's going to move to file criminal charges and that news is up on
[02:10:04.140 --> 02:10:09.520]  prisonplanet.com today and Paul Joseph Watson's article it's also info wars.com
[02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:14.200]  and worldnet daily.com he sent me the actual Kenyan government documents
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:19.240]  where they admit that they can't find it and appears the record has been altered
[02:10:19.240 --> 02:10:23.720]  or removed yeah he went to Kenya of course to start ferreting out this
[02:10:23.720 --> 02:10:28.600]  information and when he comes out and says this is a fake it's been altered
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:31.560]  our people looked at it we had other experts look at it it's been altered
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:36.200]  again I've not been a big birther I've had other issues to cover but we we've
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:39.760]  spent time looking at it over the years because they spent over $2 million at
[02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:44.920]  the White House blocking releasing what they've now released now in we're gonna
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:47.880]  go over all the latest news with dr. coursey for the balance of the hour but
[02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:54.440]  before we go there last week on this radio broadcast he called out Donald
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:58.800]  Trump who's a big democratic contributor big eminent domain supporter
[02:10:58.800 --> 02:11:03.960]  socialist health care supporter as Lou Rockwell and others have pointed out if
[02:11:03.960 --> 02:11:08.960]  this guy's a conservative you know the seediness of the penny stocks the
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:13.480]  seediness of the casinos I mean we might as well hire well I'm not going to get
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:19.520]  into it the point is that Donald Trump is a joke and with all his slick salesmen
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:22.920]  talk America's like we like him conservatives a lot of them we want
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:27.400]  him he did this birth certificate thing he brought it to a head then he kind of
[02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:31.400]  floundered around and acted embarrassed then he came out and did a bunch of
[02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:36.840]  cussing tirades he's never done before tailored to discredit and then magically
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:42.280]  he gets the $60 million NBC re-up contract with bailout money from Bush
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:48.960]  than Obama going to NBC that's on record so of course he calls him out boldly
[02:11:48.960 --> 02:11:53.200]  well Donald the Donald had called him twice wanting the book before it was
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:59.120]  published he got it to him we wonder where that went and now he's got all his
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:04.080]  casino deals in Chicago and roms their man in Chicago and so of course he calls
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:09.800]  this out well the Donald called him today this is breaking here the Donald
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:16.680]  called today the Donald's concerned dr. Corsi thank you for joining us please
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:21.680]  reveal to us your discussion with the Donald yes Alex is in fact he I just got
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:26.960]  off the phone with him a few minutes ago Donald Trump called today and of course
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:30.640]  he as usual is pumping me for information he wants very much to know
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:36.120]  what I'm doing next and I said well you know Donald we published an article in
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:41.040]  World that Daily you should have seen it about how the Kenyan government
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:46.520]  searched for 1961 birth records and determined that 1961 birth records were
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:51.680]  criminally tampered to destroy evidence of Obama's birth he said why didn't see
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:54.600]  that so we'll do your people I'll send it to you so that's all right I'll look
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:59.360]  for it I mean he is completely uninterested except to know you know
[02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:05.560]  what I'm doing what's next I indicated Donald Trump and this may be breaking
[02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:12.960]  news to the now the criminal charges we're working with a top expert in
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:18.040]  scanners worldwide expert who is not preparing will be reporting on it and
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:22.000]  WND we're on that daily hopefully the end of the week maybe Monday or Tuesday at
[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:27.280]  the latest I criminal charges are going to be filed criminal complaints filed
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:33.800]  with the FBI are charging that the long form birth certificate released by the
[02:13:33.800 --> 02:13:40.240]  White House on April 27th is fraudulent and I've been working back and forth
[02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:44.120]  with the expert on that I've read the charges they're very credible they're
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:49.080]  gonna be very difficult to answer I told Donald Trump that's coming so Trump you
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:51.920]  know if he's feeding information to the White House he certainly knows what I'm
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:55.480]  doing and I'm not hesitating to tell him I'm happy to let the White House know
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:59.440]  what I'm doing I published where is the birth certificate with that title
[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:03.880]  hoping I could get the White House so frightened that they would release this
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:08.280]  long form birth certificate which they did the president has now endorsed his
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:12.400]  own involvement in the chain of evidence saying he's had his attorney out to get
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:15.760]  it coming down to the White House press room and saying this is my birth
[02:14:15.760 --> 02:14:20.720]  certificate now the administration rises and falls on the authenticity of that
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:24.760]  document but Donald Trump I think I told Donald I said look Donald if you
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:30.440]  want to be credible here I mean told him basically he didn't accuse me or you
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:33.960]  know badger me for saying that I thought he was working with the Obama
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:37.600]  White House but I said told him I'll direct you know if you don't want people
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:41.760]  to be suspect Donald what role you're playing in this then get out there get
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:47.600]  out there vocally question the document say you want forensic testing of the
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:53.560]  original paper long form documents as in the vault of the Hawaii Department of
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:57.520]  Health say you want the doctors and Claire's records released the event on
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:15:01.560]  them was a patient and say you want the records of Coppulani Hospital released
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.840]  so we can see if and on them was ever there family changed their tune it was
[02:15:05.840 --> 02:15:09.640]  originally the problem was supposed to be born at Queens Hospital now it's
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:12.280]  Coppulani let's see the patient records for and on them
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:16.360]  Trump didn't seem interested in any of that he was very interested in knowing
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:20.680]  what I was up to next all right I want to pump you on the Trump issue because we
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:25.800]  can get some key intel out of that but for internet viewers at prisonplanet.tv
[02:15:25.800 --> 02:15:30.400]  this is all linked up in your world that daily story also Paul Joseph Watson
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:34.080]  story at prisonplanet.com if radio listeners want to see it but for
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:38.860]  prisonplanet.tv viewers I'll show folks a document cam shot here is one of
[02:15:38.860 --> 02:15:42.760]  several documents that you sent to me a few days ago now your reports out today
[02:15:42.760 --> 02:15:47.880]  Republic of Kenya office of the vice president ministry of state for
[02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:53.160]  immigration and registration of persons this is the classified document you got
[02:15:53.160 --> 02:15:58.120]  them to release and it says however there is no evidence within our records
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:02.720]  that supports this position the information we in the ministry have is
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:10.000]  that some documents have been removed by unknown persons at unknown dates or are
[02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:16.320]  missing from birth registry records thus denting the prospects of uncovering
[02:16:16.320 --> 02:16:21.480]  the facts of this matter so it goes on that they're saying that numerous
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:25.560]  intelligence reports have suggested he might have been born in Mombasa the
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:33.040]  president Obama at the lady Greg maternity wing of the Coast Provincial
[02:16:33.040 --> 02:16:36.360]  General Hospital and they go on on the letterhead of the government with the
[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:40.800]  phone numbers there and say that it's been removed it's been tampered with
[02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:45.480]  criminally criminally they go on to say it's criminal so this is a pretty
[02:16:45.480 --> 02:16:53.600]  powerful smoking gun here and then if if I was Donald Trump and you went on this
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:58.680]  big syndicated radio show and drop the bombshell and it was read by millions
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:03.280]  of people all over the web our stories our videos I went completely viral with
[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:07.080]  that interview with you last week and then Donald Trump calls you up Tuesday
[02:17:07.080 --> 02:17:12.040]  and and if I was innocent and you were saying that I worked for the president
[02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:15.760]  and I was Donald Trump or that I was conduiting info months ago when you gave
[02:17:15.760 --> 02:17:22.080]  me the book if I was Donald Trump I'd say coursey how dare you pal or if I was
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:27.520]  guilty I would just you know ignore it or if I was innocent I'd probably ignore
[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:30.320]  it I mean those are the different things you would do you wouldn't call up and
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:34.720]  just pump for more info and be nice that's a pretty creepy phone call you
[02:17:34.720 --> 02:17:39.320]  got can you describe what Donald Trump said to you how long the conversation
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:44.280]  was how he behaved well the conversation lasts about 15 minutes and Donald
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:50.040]  Trump was friendly he was having he said did not confront me aggressively that I
[02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:54.560]  said I think he's working for the Obama White House I've been out there on your
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:17:58.920]  show Alex very publicly about that and Trump was saying well you know and I
[02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:03.320]  told Trump was his purpose the call was he want to know what I was doing what
[02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:08.560]  was next the story gonna get any traction I told him about the documents
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:12.720]  from Kenya that we've been publishing in world net daily the documents I was
[02:18:12.720 --> 02:18:18.440]  there in Kenyan 2008 I've continued to receive documents from Kenyan sources you
[02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:21.760]  see some of them right now you're reporting on them we've reported well
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:27.640]  that daily criminal tampering of birth records in 1961 birth records in Kenya
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:33.240]  to disguise or remove Barack Obama's birth records in Kenya I thought that was
[02:18:33.240 --> 02:18:38.320]  explosive story Trump was a real interested in it I told him where the
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:43.600]  criminal charges are going to be filed with the FBI by a top expert again
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:47.600]  Trump was interested in that but he said to him you know he went back and
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:51.040]  forth and said well I said which mr. Trump are you going to get back into the
[02:18:51.040 --> 02:18:55.600]  story I told him said people are saying you know you got this big payoff from
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:19:00.160]  NBC it sure looks like you dropped out over that payoff in relationship with
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:04.520]  the White House and Trump said well you know even when you're as rich as I am
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:10.280]  at 60 million dollars times 220 million dollars is a chump change so I
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:13.400]  understand that mr. Trump nobody's offered me 120 million dollars recently
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:17.200]  but you can understand where a lot of people think that compromises your
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:22.840]  position maybe why you dropped out so I didn't drop out I said that the
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:26.640]  documents I still want those documents are real if mr. Trump if you're not out
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:32.520]  there aggressively demanding that these documents be authenticated

[02:24:00.760 --> 02:24:10.200]  all right going right back to dr. Jerome Corsi author of the book where's the
[02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:15.440]  birth certificate you know you look at Donald Trump and you study how media
[02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:22.600]  works we had this stewing birther movement gaining steam every month the
[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:26.760]  polls going up and up and up to where a majority of Americans Republicans and
[02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:31.440]  Democrats questioned his providence and that was a big problem so Trump comes
[02:24:31.440 --> 02:24:36.120]  out builds it to a head and then right as it comes to a head there's the big
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:41.120]  media spectacular to discredit the whole thing and then we saw the next big
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:46.680]  stunt a few weeks later to then wipe that controversy off the map Obama
[02:24:46.680 --> 02:24:53.480]  daringly gets usama bin Laden he's he's he's just so wonderful and then that
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:59.640]  launches the next phase of of starting a war with Pakistan and the fact that
[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:03.960]  Trump comes out and says Ron Paul can't win and look at these Republicans
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:07.000]  they're pathetic and the fact that he's given two to one to Democrats and
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:11.880]  hangs out in New York with Bloomberg and Schumer I mean it's so obvious that
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:16.800]  this guy from my perspective is a ringer and you've got this government money
[02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:22.160]  going to NBC and then right into Trump's pocket and that ridiculous preening
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:28.160]  peacock show the apprentice and and and then he's on the phone with you wanting
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:33.240]  to know what you're gonna do next very bizarre Jerome Corsi I mean if you're
[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:38.240]  a discredited cook and and and he's been discredited you think he would be
[02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:42.240]  fighting to continue to expose but instead he wants to lay there like a
[02:25:42.240 --> 02:25:47.640]  possum well I said Trump today on the telephone I said look get involved if you
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:52.640]  want people to believe that you know you're still on the side of disbelieving
[02:25:52.640 --> 02:25:57.800]  disbelieving Obama then ask for authentication we we have nobody seen
[02:25:57.800 --> 02:26:01.200]  the original document a court of law the best evidence would not be this
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:05.640]  electronic birth certificate the White House released electronic birth
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:11.120]  certificates didn't even exist in 1961 the best evidence is in the vault in the
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:14.280]  Department of Health of Hawaii the original birth certificate if it exists
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:18.840]  and we can't see that we can't get a subjected to forensic analysis that
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:24.120]  Mr. Trump pressed that case he seemed uninterested he said you know if it got
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:29.240]  to be an issue again he would jump back in I said well Mr. Trump jump back in
[02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:33.640]  now and you know you tell what do you have any means for your media supporting
[02:26:33.640 --> 02:26:37.200]  it that I you know as far as I'm concerned with Trump I've run these
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:41.000]  campaigns before when I did unfit for command with John O'Deal this would both
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:46.680]  bet published by myself Abomination 2008 it was number one best dollar for a
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:50.840]  month didn't have a lot of support then New York Times ran a front page article
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:55.800]  blasting the book I said I'm not counting on any main mainstream media and
[02:26:55.800 --> 02:26:59.200]  I'm not getting I'm not expecting to get invited to the White House Christmas
[02:26:59.200 --> 02:27:02.800]  Party but if it's Trump neither should you be expecting to get invited at the
[02:27:02.800 --> 02:27:06.360]  White House Christmas Party get out there and pound this issue if you want
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:11.480]  people to believe that you're really on the side of wanting the truth and asking
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:14.920]  for where's the birth certificate go on the record you don't believe that this
[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:18.680]  is legitimate say it's a fraud he wouldn't do it he was not
[02:27:18.680 --> 02:27:29.040]  unenthusiastic and not responsible I made those suggestions well said for me
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:34.520]  the biggest piece of evidence here and I know as a jerk so Alex he asked me to
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:38.480]  call him before we made our next move so he'd know what we were doing I mean the
[02:27:38.480 --> 02:27:43.640]  whole call was what are you up to and please tell me first before you do it
[02:27:43.640 --> 02:27:48.200]  now I mean I'm happy to talk to Trump I'm happy to tell him what I'm doing did
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:52.160]  he comment on the fact that you that you've called him out no he never made
[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:57.520]  a comment about it didn't say a word but you brought that up to him why I didn't
[02:27:57.520 --> 02:28:01.760]  say I'm out there saying it I made the charge to him I said Mr. Trump if you
[02:28:01.760 --> 02:28:05.360]  don't get out of Donald really what kind of a person they base it at this point
[02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:10.640]  that Donald look if you don't get out there and start doing this nobody's
[02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:15.560]  gonna believe that you're really opposing Obama looks like you're
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:22.000]  supporting Obama and I told him that even with I was all in Fox News I believe
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:26.520]  was yesterday Trump is saying attacking the Republican candidate saying he's
[02:28:26.520 --> 02:28:32.040]  gonna get back in the race if the other Republicans keep who's such lousy
[02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:36.160]  candidates I said that sounds like Obama's line are you feeding Obama's
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:40.400]  line to the American people or well they are lousy candidate I said look if you
[02:28:40.400 --> 02:28:43.320]  don't attack the other Republicans you're not gonna get anywhere convincing
[02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:46.800]  people that you want to run as the Republican Trump said well should I run
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:50.680]  as an independent I said this Trump if you run as an independent you're gonna
[02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:55.600]  100% convince everybody that you're you know you're in cohoots with Obama
[02:28:55.600 --> 02:29:01.560]  trying to split the vote of the Republicans so that the Obama wins look
[02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:07.160]  that casino owner that that good old boy good fella knows exactly of course
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:11.560]  exactly what he's doing now now this was a short segment long segment coming up
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:15.920]  and I want to preface this question now and then come back and have you answer
[02:29:15.920 --> 02:29:21.600]  it for me I think one of the biggest pieces of evidence you've got of this
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:25.600]  being fraud is not just the Kenyan government saying their records were
[02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:30.000]  tampered with criminally and expunged on Obama and that their intelligence
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:34.280]  agency does have intel that he was born there bigger than that is that you were
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:39.880]  told three weeks before by a source inside the government of Hawaii that it
[02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:44.520]  wasn't there now it's there and you say you have the email evidence with with
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:49.200]  with Joseph Farrah telling him that that's not giving up a source you need
[02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:53.600]  to release all that will be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the

[02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:43.160]  answer my big question is I want to recap it for folks that just joined us
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:49.640]  dr. course see where are you guys at world net daily Joseph Farah where is
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:57.320]  wnd.com with the economic warfare attack that the White House mouthpiece
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:02.000]  Esquire put out saying the book had been recalled Farah had said it was all lies
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:05.120]  and discredited and that everybody should send their books back and you'd
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:09.320]  give them their retail price back that would bankrupt you guys to try to create
[02:37:09.320 --> 02:37:13.200]  a run on the bookstores of people demanding their money back so they pull
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:18.760]  the book how badly economically has it hurt you guys I mean it was a number
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:23.280]  one New York Times bestseller before it came out how much damage has this done
[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:28.200]  to the book well I think first of all if the attack was vicious by Esquire it
[02:37:28.200 --> 02:37:31.960]  was intended to destroy the marketing at the book in the first hour the
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:38.480]  Esquire later said it's satire and you know wasn't very funny and certainly
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:42.840]  didn't appear as that tired appeared as a news story you could reasonably read it
[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:48.360]  and have been fooled by it some radio host that interviewed me were fooled by
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:53.000]  it started out their interviews asking why we pulled the book I'll look at it
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:57.960]  worse we're the deal is going to sue Esquire Joseph as announced that also the
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:38:01.640]  economic damage had to have been important and severe certainly the
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:05.800]  intent to damage was important and severe a world in the daily of do just
[02:38:05.800 --> 02:38:10.200]  find the book is telling but we had to scramble very hard to reestablish the
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:14.640]  market and to reassure distributors that the book had not been pulled the
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:18.440]  book is alive and well it's out there everywhere in bookstores all the
[02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:23.960]  electronic outlets it's telling the book I still rated on Amazon content take a
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:28.200]  look it's outactive all through the market and it was a vicious attack by
[02:38:28.200 --> 02:38:33.320]  Esquire aimed at you know I guess projecting what the White House wanted
[02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:36.880]  to believe what was true I think the White House hoped the book would be
[02:38:36.880 --> 02:38:40.760]  withdrawn but I published this book with Joseph Perak as I knew he had the
[02:38:40.760 --> 02:38:45.440]  courage to keep the book out there a mainstream media publisher one of the
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:48.960]  big publishing houses that I published with big publishing houses before
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:53.360]  White House might have intimidated them by calling up and you know threatening
[02:38:53.360 --> 02:38:57.920]  not to give them access to authors or whatever to get a major publishing house
[02:38:57.920 --> 02:39:01.680]  to withdraw the book but this case I knew there was no chance that would
[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:06.560]  happen Joseph Perak was as resolute as I am that the book is true we still want
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:10.040]  to know where the birth certificate is and we're taking every possible step to
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:15.200]  demonstrate Obama was not born in Hawaii he was born in Kenya I'm convinced of that
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:19.800]  now and here you've got a situation where the birth certificate released by
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:23.640]  the White House is a fraudulent document which means criminal fraud was
[02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:28.440]  created committed in the White House President Obama is personally identified
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:32.160]  in the chain of evidence that he sent his lawyer out to get this document
[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:36.280]  President Obama showed up in the White House press room to say here the
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:40.480]  document is he's correctly involved in the chain of evidence and the White
[02:39:40.480 --> 02:39:44.560]  House the future of the Obama presidency will depend on that of that
[02:39:44.560 --> 02:39:48.960]  document remaining authentic if it's proved as I believe it will be the
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:52.800]  documents fraudulent it's hard to see how the Obama administration will remain
[02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:58.720]  in office well this is only getting bigger and people don't buy anything that
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:04.720]  the White House puts out there and I know you're under such attack Jerome but
[02:40:04.720 --> 02:40:09.360]  you normally will tell folks what your dead reckoning says but isn't it
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:14.160]  suspicious that right on the heels of them with the stunt birth certificate
[02:40:14.160 --> 02:40:18.840]  that is as phony as a three dollar bill and then you're coming out with the
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:23.200]  evidence they're gonna file these criminal charges that then magically they
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:28.360]  kill Osama bin Laden but then the helicopter blows up and eyewitnesses in
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:32.560]  Pakistan on national Pakistani TV say the seals got on the helicopter and it
[02:40:32.560 --> 02:40:36.520]  blew up that it didn't blow up once on the ground it blew up as they took off
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:41.040]  I mean that's this whole thing you can just see the scripting in the White
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:44.240]  House lying saying they were in the situation room watching the raid
[02:40:44.240 --> 02:40:49.160]  Hillary covering her mouth they admit that was fake they admit bin Laden didn't
[02:40:49.160 --> 02:40:55.280]  fight back didn't use his wife throw the body in the sea within minutes they
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:41:00.600]  said we have the DNA proof it takes days to do it I mean doc do you not have some
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:03.400]  suspicions there you're not gonna cross that bridge well I just haven't gone
[02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:07.360]  into the OBL situation I've got my hands full with the birth certificate if you
[02:41:07.360 --> 02:41:12.360]  but you know what I'm gonna comment on is that here for three years
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:18.240]  Obama spent a couple million dollars with lawyers he even moved his lawyer
[02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:24.240]  from Perkins Coy into the White House to be his White House counsel and that to
[02:41:24.240 --> 02:41:29.280]  be his very suspicious fighting the release of this birth certificate and
[02:41:29.280 --> 02:41:33.800]  then a book is gonna be published so if this event document was available three
[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:38.840]  years ago why did we have to go through all this nonsense about the
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:43.640]  certification of live birth but the short form the attorney Robert Bauer
[02:41:43.640 --> 02:41:49.720]  together with Anita Donn his wife it was the attack dog again Fox and anyone
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:54.600]  any other media that dared to raise questions about the Obama administration
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:59.040]  they're now paid by the White House I need it done it's gone ours still there
[02:41:59.040 --> 02:42:04.120]  under the government payroll defending Obama in eligibility cases and suddenly
[02:42:04.120 --> 02:42:08.960]  this document miraculously appears long form birth certificate the Abercrombie
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:14.000]  the governor in Hawaii said wasn't there about six weeks ago he couldn't find it
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:19.880]  well that's where to go to the comment you asked about Alex before the break I
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:25.880]  got a call from one of my top intelligent sources in Hawaii that warned me
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:31.520]  that the document had been forged and inserted into the long book at Hawaii
[02:42:31.520 --> 02:42:39.440]  fact a person who was very connected in the department went in related to the
[02:42:39.440 --> 02:42:42.720]  department let's say didn't work for the apartment but a source that they've
[02:42:42.720 --> 02:42:47.320]  married to the department went in and read us the document I knew it was
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:51.960]  Konfiolani Hospital I knew was doctor I think the doctor was named I didn't know
[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:55.600]  doctors think Claire's name the person that went in and read it was so frightened
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:42:59.800]  by what was being I ran out of there about as fast as they could but enough
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:03.520]  information came forward that we knew the document had been forged let me stop
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:07.680]  you this is such a big deal that I want to put the question back out there and
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:12.800]  I'm I like to type a talk show host unless I really am you know a shocked but
[02:43:12.800 --> 02:43:15.840]  already knew about this info so I'm not shocked I've already you know had the
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:21.240]  revelation who'll ooh ah now listen up this is big folks understand the magnitude
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:25.680]  of this but but all of that is a prerequisite here you're somebody who's
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:29.440]  always very careful about what you say and do going back for decades you're
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:32.320]  somebody who really does do the research you're coming out saying there's no
[02:43:32.320 --> 02:43:36.840]  doubt it's fraudulent you're going forward saying you're gonna attempt to
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:41.280]  file criminal charges on this and you revealed here for the first time last
[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:46.480]  week that you have a source who three weeks before the president went public
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:51.400]  went in was able to see it and said it wasn't there before your source inside
[02:43:51.400 --> 02:43:57.840]  your mole it's been added now you have the emails with Farah proving that these
[02:43:57.840 --> 02:44:01.360]  discussions went on you can't give up the source but you've got the proof with
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:05.800]  your Farah emails and Farah says what do we do and you say let's go ahead with it
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:10.600]  this is exactly what we want Joe we've got him now now I'm paraphrasing what you
[02:44:10.600 --> 02:44:15.280]  said last week take your time walk through exactly what happened three weeks
[02:44:15.280 --> 02:44:20.600]  before Obama released the latest long-form supposed final real birth
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:24.760]  certificate and what the new intelligence source well the new
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:28.600]  information that the intelligence source is giving you because folks I mean what
[02:44:28.600 --> 02:44:32.320]  what doctor course he's saying here you know they could have a grand jury come
[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:35.640]  after him he could be pulled into court he could be forced to release this he
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:40.920]  wouldn't be doing this right now if this wasn't true and going on so I hope you
[02:44:40.920 --> 02:44:45.160]  understand we're now entering the realm of total proof not just that he fought it
[02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:48.560]  for three years with two million move the lawyer into the White House who was
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:53.160]  fighting it stonewalling saying with his operatives mr. Maddow and mr.
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:57.480]  slime ball that that this is the birth certificate two and a half years ago I
[02:44:57.480 --> 02:45:03.160]  mean you just desperate activity on their side the thing stinks to high heaven
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:08.080]  the Republic of Kenya classified document released that yes the Obama
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:11.720]  records have criminally been removed there's evidence he was born in Mombasa
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:16.040]  I mean here it is he's releasing it course he wouldn't be doing this now if
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:22.200]  he didn't 100% think he had the bona fide so slowly go over your mole inside as
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:25.880]  much as you can give us and when are you gonna have a Farah come out and
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:29.120]  substantiate this verbally swear to it publicly I believe you would you would
[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:32.840]  be doing this well I did even more than that I give you the exact
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:39.120]  chronology it was just before February 24th I got a call from my source in
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:44.480]  Hawaii and said that someone had gone into the log book a very trusted bowl
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:50.680]  and the long-form birth certificate for Obama had suddenly appeared and was
[02:45:50.680 --> 02:45:55.200]  inserted in the book read it enough to know that Kapilani Hospital was
[02:45:55.200 --> 02:46:00.040]  identified as the hospital knew a doctor was listed didn't couldn't in a time
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:04.040]  where it was too scared to get the name of the doctor now in February 24th I'm
[02:46:04.040 --> 02:46:08.880]  looking at it right now I drafted an article it's date stamped February 24th
[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:13.840]  at my computer I can send it to you Alex's proof the article was written
[02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:19.280]  says W&D warned to block possible future release of fraudulent Obama birth
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:24.720]  record and this is this is February 24th it's date stamped this way in my
[02:46:24.720 --> 02:46:29.240]  Microsoft Word file you even wrote a story that you didn't release we didn't
[02:46:29.240 --> 02:46:33.720]  we decided not to release it because we it decided we hoped the White House would
[02:46:33.720 --> 02:46:38.080]  release this document so we named the book where's the birth certificate to
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:41.600]  try to frighten the White House I knew the White House could not tolerate if
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:45.960]  anybody read this book people read this book Obama and their hopes that they had
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:51.080]  released it was falling through and so you forced them out in the open yeah and
[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:56.160]  we and I knew that Joseph said we're not gonna publish this story tipping them
[02:46:56.160 --> 02:47:00.920]  off that we know a fake document is now been created let's get them to release

[02:47:24.080 --> 02:47:28.040]  point the fact that you that's the proof that you knew this was going on
[02:47:28.040 --> 02:47:33.840]  before it happened man this is the story is world that daily has been warned that
[02:47:33.840 --> 02:47:38.040]  certain government officials in Hawaii have been contemplating releasing
[02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:44.480]  fraudulent Obama birth record that WDND knows it has in its possession
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:48.640]  information that will be able to prove the forgery we had information will
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:52.560]  prove the forgery even when I wrote this February 24th unbelievable I knew that
[02:47:52.560 --> 02:47:55.720]  we're gonna release it I knew we could prove it was a forgery unbelievable and
[02:47:55.720 --> 02:48:00.480]  we and we didn't publish this article because we didn't want to tip off the
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:03.360]  White House but we knew that we're gonna release the fraudulent document that we
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:10.680]  could prove it was a forgery I'll send you the article well we need to absolutely
[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:14.320]  if you send it to us I'll have one of my writers do a report on it right now and
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:18.240]  then you can follow up or vice versa I don't care but for me and I'm asking you
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:22.800]  if you agree Dr. Corsi that is such incredible proof right that you had the
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:29.840]  intel inside and and that you knew it was coming just a few weeks before and
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:34.920]  had this article ready I think you should write a breakdown explaining why
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:41.240]  you guys didn't really sit let me read you well what else I wrote the other
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:45.200]  originally they were planning to release the fraudulent birth certificate in the
[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:49.880]  run-up to the 2012 presidential election we took away one of their October
[02:48:49.880 --> 02:48:54.440]  surprises Joseph and I said let's make this book where's the birth certificate
[02:48:54.440 --> 02:48:58.720]  so explosive that they have to release this now I want to reach you these two
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:03.480]  paragraphs quickly well that daily confidential source further warned that
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:06.840]  any fraudulent Obama birth record originating in Hawaii will be
[02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:10.880]  sufficiently expert but the forgery can only be detected by forensic
[02:49:10.880 --> 02:49:15.640]  examination of the original possibly not from digitized copies or photographs
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:19.280]  circulated at the forgery on the internet it turned out that the forgery was
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:23.320]  much poorer than we thought it would be and we have enough even with the
[02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:27.360]  digitized copy the White House release on the website to prove it's the forgery
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:30.720]  the next paragraph will not really cannot release the identity of the
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:39.160]  confidential source without risking the person's life unbelievable now again
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:43.520]  read us for those that have not seen the unpublished a report that you had
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:47.760]  ready but Farrah and you decided not to release show that you could catch them
[02:49:47.760 --> 02:49:51.320]  with their pants down read us that headline and as much of the story as
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:57.040]  you can to it said will not daily warned to block possible future release of
[02:49:57.040 --> 02:50:03.680]  fraudulent Obama birth record and world that daily has been warned that
[02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:07.400]  certain government officials in Hawaii have been contemplating releasing
[02:50:07.400 --> 02:50:12.800]  fraudulent Obama birth record and that world that daily hasn't as possession
[02:50:12.800 --> 02:50:18.800]  information that will be able to prove the forgery according to a top level
[02:50:18.800 --> 02:50:22.600]  world that daily confidential source with access to officials within the
[02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:26.760]  Hawaiian government the long-form birth certificate issued to the Nordic twins
[02:50:26.760 --> 02:50:31.560]  one day after the Obama Barack Obama was born create a barrier for anyone
[02:50:31.560 --> 02:50:37.640]  attempting to produce the fraudulent long-form copy Ali only our copy of
[02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:42.080]  Lonnie hospital-generated birth certificate for Obama what I'm referring
[02:50:42.080 --> 02:50:47.400]  to there is we knew that they were going to continue this document is 10641 and
[02:50:47.400 --> 02:50:52.800]  the birthday which was registered August 8 three days later the Nordic twins
[02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:58.720]  were registered August 11 they were 10637 and 10638 from the time of the
[02:50:58.720 --> 02:51:02.360]  certificate of live birth the torture picked the wrong number they've been
[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:05.600]  locked into that to the beginning and what my source of the why he said is
[02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:11.040]  press the Nordic numbers because that shows that anything fraudulent that the
[02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:15.720]  old Obama administration releases is the long-form birth certificate as long as
[02:51:15.720 --> 02:51:20.360]  it's got the original 10641 on it is a fraudulent document for those that don't
[02:51:20.360 --> 02:51:24.360]  know that was a big old-fashioned numbering machine of that numbering
[02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:29.480]  machine well those baits automatic machines that incremented by one and I
[02:51:29.480 --> 02:51:35.800]  have the 1955 article from Charles Bennett who is the guy who created he
[02:51:35.800 --> 02:51:39.680]  was ready with the our register general of Hawaii's Department of Health he
[02:51:39.680 --> 02:51:45.200]  created the system of birth certificate the article specifies that the birth
[02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:49.720]  certificates were numbered immediately after the registrar general
[02:51:49.720 --> 02:51:55.200]  stamped it it went into the books with the number he stamped as impossible for
[02:51:55.200 --> 02:51:59.120]  a birth certificate that was registered three days earlier to have a higher
[02:51:59.120 --> 02:52:03.480]  number as a birth certificate says birth certificates registered three days
[02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:11.880]  later well I'm just speechless right now and not only did you write this three
[02:52:11.880 --> 02:52:16.840]  weeks before Obama released the birth certificate you called everything in the
[02:52:16.840 --> 02:52:20.680]  article that was unpublished what happened this is incredible we had we
[02:52:20.680 --> 02:52:26.320]  had the document read to us from within the vault and in Hawaii the person went
[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:29.760]  in and read the article and we knew what it was on the document because it was
[02:52:29.760 --> 02:52:33.800]  read to it and correct me if I'm wrong but this is the absolute key your same
[02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:39.240]  mole previously had said it's not there but now they call you and they go
[02:52:39.240 --> 02:52:42.880]  suddenly it's there that's what we've been told when whatever crime he was
[02:52:42.880 --> 02:52:47.160]  looking that it didn't exist and then it suddenly existed and that's confirmed
[02:52:47.160 --> 02:52:50.360]  by Abakrambi thinking he's off record with the reporter who kept the
[02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:54.520]  recorder going and just added it as a footnote in his article that Abakrambi
[02:52:54.520 --> 02:52:58.240]  said yeah we thought it'd be there it's not and I think it's equally important
[02:52:58.240 --> 02:53:02.760]  what we've released you've got the Kenyan documents there Kenyan government
[02:53:02.760 --> 02:53:09.040]  stationary like they grandma Sarah has been saying for years Obama was born in
[02:53:09.040 --> 02:53:12.680]  Kenya the Kenyan government took it seriously Kenyan government determined
[02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:18.520]  1961 birth records in Kenya were criminally altered so as to erased
[02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:22.920]  Barack Obama's birth certificate record and to disguise the fact that they'd
[02:53:22.920 --> 02:53:26.640]  ever been there I'm gonna say this reported you've got the second document
[02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:32.560]  the Kenyan government even told that to ran in Berger our ambassador in Kenya
[02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:38.080]  under George W. Bush was inquiring about Obama's birth certificate George Bush
[02:53:38.080 --> 02:53:44.320]  administration had reason to think Obama was born in Kenya not just recently it
[02:53:44.320 --> 02:53:50.320]  goes back to George W. Bush inquiring through ran in Berger to the Kenyan
[02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:54.280]  government as to whether Obama was born there the Kenyan government sending
[02:53:54.280 --> 02:53:58.280]  back a response to the formally to read those are documents you've got in your
[02:53:58.280 --> 02:54:03.960]  hand saying we don't have Obama's birth record but we have reason to think it
[02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:09.960]  was criminally destroyed yeah here's the request from the US ambassador for
[02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:13.880]  president George W. Bush on birth records for Senator Barack Hussein
[02:54:13.880 --> 02:54:19.080]  Obama now we're learning that this was being taken so seriously even then that
[02:54:19.080 --> 02:54:22.800]  the Republican leadership the president was looking at it here's the other
[02:54:22.800 --> 02:54:27.400]  document when they went to try to find it it had been criminally removed I mean
[02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:33.080]  when you look at this no one knowing this was going on would not release the
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:37.520]  long form instead spend two million dollars move the lawyer that's on the
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:42.080]  case into the White House they've been haunted by this they've been terrorized
[02:54:42.080 --> 02:54:49.560]  instead they have that that joke that fraud slimeball Matthews Mr. Maddow all
[02:54:49.560 --> 02:54:56.480]  of them I mean Rachel Maddow sorry get up there and and and and say this is the
[02:54:56.480 --> 02:55:00.560]  birth certificate there's no such thing as a long form insulting Americans
[02:55:00.560 --> 02:55:04.440]  intelligence then we get the long form it looks like it was made in Crayola and
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:10.880]  then now oh my I mean this is so huge Dr. Corsi it is huge yeah you know I've
[02:55:10.880 --> 02:55:16.080]  been I've had sources in Kenya continuing to the day I've had sources in
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:19.720]  Hawaii I've hired private and guest investigators I've been working with
[02:55:19.720 --> 02:55:24.280]  intelligence experts on the island in Hawaii I've been given the inside track
[02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:29.120]  on the story from the very beginning and now even you've got the immigration
[02:55:29.120 --> 02:55:33.360]  naturalization service file on Barack Obama senior verifying what I've said
[02:55:33.360 --> 02:55:37.160]  from the beginning and that was they never were married it was a sham
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:43.720]  marriage from the beginning and Dunham had been a frequenting bill letter or
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:50.400]  bar on Hotel Street and Honolulu she got pregnant she wanted Barack Obama to
[02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:54.200]  be the father Barack Obama wasn't interested and Dunham flew off by
[02:55:54.200 --> 02:55:58.080]  herself to convince the family in Kenya she should be the princess that's the
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:02.280]  incredible and then Harvard comes out and confirms it the State Department
[02:56:02.280 --> 02:56:07.080]  confirms that all these wives fake marriages babies everywhere I mean any
[02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:11.520]  moron that's what they say in Kenya Obama looks nothing like his daddy and
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:15.920]  and also you've got the the immigration naturalization service files
[02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:22.200]  rejected Obama's marriage to Anne Dunham as grounds on which he could be
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:25.320]  extending his stay in the United States because it was a sham marriage they
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:29.160]  couldn't find the marriage certificates like I can't the two never lived
[02:56:29.160 --> 02:56:33.120]  together like I pointed out even the birth announcement with the grandparents
[02:56:33.120 --> 02:56:38.440]  birth announcement and they weren't entirely convinced the baby was Obama
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:43.720]  seniors to begin with doc we're almost out of time you would not put yourselves
[02:56:43.720 --> 02:56:50.040]  out on a limb obviously if you were lying they would try to trump something
[02:56:50.040 --> 02:56:54.720]  up the White House has already arrested members of the press for whistle-blowing
[02:56:54.720 --> 02:56:59.120]  now calling it espionage you you are in danger you are politically being
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:02.480]  assassinated they're trying to assassinate your character they're
[02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:06.200]  pulling out all the stops through their surrogates with dirty tricks to destroy
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:12.200]  the book they are acting like people who are 100% guilty then you any
[02:57:12.200 --> 02:57:16.800]  examination of the evidence shows that they've been covering up and are desperate

[03:01:20.320 --> 03:01:25.520]  take a week or two I'm telling you this is so big you better not get on any
[03:01:25.520 --> 03:01:30.440]  airplanes and I hope that forger expert is being safe because I believe you and
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:34.640]  I also will tell you I think you're in danger are you watching your back well
[03:01:34.640 --> 03:01:39.800]  I mean I'm an investigative reporter I've you know I took on some very big
[03:01:39.800 --> 03:01:45.400]  stories before I'm good for command in football story I think by being public
[03:01:45.400 --> 03:01:51.280]  is the best defense I can have and I'm taking reasonably prudent steps but
[03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:54.720]  probably right now if I fell down the stairs people would suspect it was the
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:02:01.080]  White House that's probably the best way I could be safe absolutely finishing up
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:04.400]  as you got cut off by the break what's the time frame on the criminal charges
[03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:08.880]  criminal charges are going to be filed I talked to the expert preparing the
[03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:14.080]  charges today they're going to be filed he was going to call the FBI I've got
[03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:19.280]  one call to make to a top former FBI official let's know it's coming and
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:24.840]  then the charges will actually be mailed into the FBI probably tomorrow and I'll
[03:02:24.840 --> 03:02:29.360]  write about it publishes in WorldNet daily Thursday Friday or Monday
[03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:34.080]  depending I've been I've had as many as you know 10 15 radio shows a day so it's
[03:02:34.080 --> 03:02:38.160]  been a very very busy schedule and Alex I'm giving you material no one else is
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:45.400]  getting well we appreciate that Dr. Corsi in closing clearly if the Bush
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:49.040]  administration now confirming the Kenyan government was looking into this they
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:52.280]  know something's going on and the Kenyan government said to looks like
[03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:56.640]  something's going on here stuff's been covered up you've got another document
[03:02:56.640 --> 03:02:59.520]  confirming that from the Kenyan government from their State Department
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:04.600]  this is so big what about the blackmail issue isn't it a national security issue
[03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:08.560]  to bring this out so that Obama can't be blackmailed anymore I mean undoubtedly
[03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:12.560]  he's being blackmailed well I think I think you know the problem with any
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:17.640]  president who doesn't tell the truth is the blackmail potential is there you
[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:23.160]  know I was in Israel doing why is real can't wait I met with two former heads
[03:03:23.160 --> 03:03:27.480]  of the Mossad Mossad has investigated Obama's background as well every
[03:03:27.480 --> 03:03:30.840]  intelligence agency I believe in the world has investigated Obama's background
[03:03:30.840 --> 03:03:36.600]  I think they found what I found he wasn't born in Hawaii is likely I think
[03:03:36.600 --> 03:03:43.520]  100% now born in Kenya Kenyan government even confirms a birth record in 61
[03:03:43.520 --> 03:03:50.720]  were criminally altered in order to hide the evidence of Obama's birth or what
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:53.960]  more do you need are you hinting at former heads the actual birth
[03:03:53.960 --> 03:03:56.760]  certificate in Kenya because it's been destroyed that's what the Kenyan
[03:03:56.760 --> 03:04:01.000]  government is telling Ambassador Rannenberger incredible directly for
[03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:06.600]  George Bush in closing are you hinting that the Israeli intelligence former
[03:04:06.600 --> 03:04:13.960]  heads told you in Israel that that they're suspicious let's just not answer
[03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:19.960]  that question that's really a little bit too much but I the I have a thorough
[03:04:19.960 --> 03:04:24.320]  discussion with couple former heads of the thought about this issue and look
[03:04:24.320 --> 03:04:29.400]  let me say that every intelligence agency in the world has been looking to do
[03:04:29.400 --> 03:04:33.880]  Obama's birth circumstances and Americans have just got to realize that I think
[03:04:33.880 --> 03:04:37.000]  they found what I found well imagine what those governments can do with this
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:40.320]  information Dr. Korsy I'll say bye to you during the break appreciate you
[03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:44.160]  giving us an hour I know you're giving other shows 10 15 minutes and he's

[03:04:49.320 --> 03:04:53.360]  daily article that they decided to not go with so they could smoke Obama out of
[03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:57.000]  his rat's nest by committing himself to this document we'll cover more of this
