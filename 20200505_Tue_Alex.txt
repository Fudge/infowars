[00:00.000 --> 00:29.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday, May 5th, 2020 Global Transmission 181 days out.
[00:29.000 --> 00:37.000]  From the election, and if you think the COVID-19 globalist hysteria is the only weapon being launched against the United States.
[00:37.000 --> 00:45.000]  Think again, they've got more tricks up their sleeves, but already the world by every metric is entering the greatest depression in history.
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  There's no turning back from that now.
[00:48.000 --> 01:03.000]  The only question is, how bad will it get? I kind of slid into my chair as the music was already rolling here because we've got several guests in studio and a bunch of documentation and research that I was doing right up until the moment.
[01:03.000 --> 01:10.000]  Again, I slid into here like I was coming in fast to home plate.
[01:10.000 --> 01:13.000]  It's all crystallized. It's all completely clear now.
[01:13.000 --> 01:22.000]  We're inside the New World Order and it just gets more dystopic from here until we start resisting and not complying and exposing what's really happening.
[01:22.000 --> 01:32.000]  But there are now hundreds of doctors and nurses in the U.S. and the U.K. and Europe that have come out and said,
[01:32.000 --> 01:50.000]  we're ordered to say when somebody gets hit by a car or dies of cancer, when we test them and we find the genetic material of ever having a coronavirus, which everybody has, to say they died of coronavirus, that's now confirmed.
[01:50.000 --> 02:05.000]  And so when anybody does get a respiratory problem or get sick, there's a total panic, they get scared, they run into the hospital, they innovate them and they kill your ass because you don't need to be on a respirator and they just pump your lungs up,
[02:05.000 --> 02:07.000]  chain your ass down and kill you.
[02:07.000 --> 02:11.000]  And that's because the hospitals are following what they're told to do.
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  They've tested the bioethics boards.
[02:13.000 --> 02:20.000]  And for those that don't know what bioethics boards are, we're going to talk about it coming up with the David Knight in studio later.
[02:20.000 --> 02:32.000]  But David Knight, six years ago, had, when he was filling in for me one day, was on my show, he had a guest on, several guests that were nurses that contacted him and showed their documentation.
[02:32.000 --> 02:50.000]  And I'm really pushing to get those nurses back on or other nurses or have a medical whistleblower hotline that I guess we'll launch an email today to talk about COVID right now and expose that, but also how the pediatric nurses, the preemie nurses with the premature babies
[02:50.000 --> 03:01.000]  would get respirators ready when the bioethics board at the hospital would order them to inoculate two pound, three pound babies, almost all of them would die.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  So the nurses would then say, we're going to keep them alive and battle the respirators.
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  And the bioethics board would just say, hey, just get rid of them.
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  And so that's what this is, is eugenics.
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  And that's what's being carried out.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  And people hear me tell a story like that.
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  It sounds otherworldly, but that's actually come out in the news.
[03:18.000 --> 03:23.000]  Up till about 10 years ago, you didn't give a pregnant woman vaccines that said on the inserts, don't do it.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  You didn't give somebody that was already sick of vaccine and can kill you.
[03:26.000 --> 03:36.000]  That's just known fact, not debatable, but the vaccine companies doubled down their population control and said, we're just going to do it one way or the other.
[03:36.000 --> 03:45.000]  Well, Michael Savage, who is a doctor, came out and said he will not be taking the COVID-19 vaccine and that it's very, very dangerous.
[03:45.000 --> 03:46.000]  And I concur with him as well.
[03:46.000 --> 03:48.000]  He goes over the reasons for that.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  So we've got a clip of that coming up as well.
[03:52.000 --> 04:04.000]  We're going to have David Knight in studio with us coming up at the bottom of the hour to go over the graphs, the numbers, the facts, the research and showing that they have absolutely lied.
[04:04.000 --> 04:17.000]  All these major graphs, all these major institutions have been 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, thousands of percentage points higher in death rate than what they said.
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  But you read the news, you think it's the end of the world and you see this COVID-19 thing bouncing along at the bottom.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  That's because they're attributing almost all the deaths to COVID-19.
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.000]  So if you look at it, it's a regular daily death rate in each of these countries, but they're just contributing all the deaths to it.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  We now know it is an ultramassive hoax.
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.000]  There is a real virus out there.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  It does hurt and kill some people.
[04:41.000 --> 04:48.000]  But the reason it's man-made is it's patented and owned by the globalists so they can control the rollout of the control grid.
[04:48.000 --> 05:12.000]  Meanwhile, the third world is now collapsing into absolute hell on earth and 135 million people are set to starve to death in the next year, according to the United Nations.
[05:19.000 --> 05:24.000]  And there's another innovation.
[05:24.000 --> 05:26.000]  It's the spray cap.
[05:26.000 --> 05:34.000]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo, but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it right in your eyes.
[05:40.000 --> 05:42.000]  But I just love it.
[05:42.000 --> 05:44.000]  Personally, it has something that's a moisturizer as well.
[05:44.000 --> 05:53.000]  So, this is a real innovation. I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out. It smells great.
[05:53.000 --> 06:22.000]  It's so refreshing. This is a big winner.
[06:22.000 --> 06:31.000]  Tuesday, May 5th, the year 2020, 181 days out from the historic election.
[06:31.000 --> 06:50.000]  We're going to have, they've been night in studio to lay out a large spectrum of official graphs put out by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, by the Royal Society over in England.
[06:50.000 --> 07:10.000]  All of them giant, complete frauds because they're lying on purpose in a systematic way to create as much fear and control as possible and to force a forced inoculation as early as 2020.
[07:10.000 --> 07:28.000]  By using it in all of the globalist controlled areas of the world to absolutely crack down on the public, Macron has announced permanent limits for French citizens saying you are now under permanent martial law.
[07:28.000 --> 07:41.000]  French citizens are being arrested who even try to walk their dogs, but the Muslims control most of the major cities and are allowed to walk free as if they were God incarnate.
[07:41.000 --> 08:10.000]  Meanwhile, we're facing the record economic implosion in history and we're only a few months into this and the blue cities and blue states are announcing they're never opening until America completely collapses. They're going to stay semi-closed to the election and then use every new death from supposed COVID-19 to hoard $39,000 into their war chest.
[08:10.000 --> 08:35.000]  And we've definitely cracked the code on what is going on. We now know. There are two different types of test. They admit that both tests don't work. That's on record because one test for the antibodies, but if you have the antibodies for any coronavirus, then it tests positive.
[08:35.000 --> 08:55.000]  And the other test for material left over remnants from a fight with a coronavirus. And that's the majority of the tests that are being done. And on record, anyone that's had a coronavirus infection, the average is in 10 years, but sometimes you don't show positive after five years.
[08:55.000 --> 09:12.000]  Sometimes you show positive 15, 20 years for any type of cold. If you've had a cold in the last decade, you will show up positive for coronavirus. And then if you die in a car wreck or even a shark attack, there's now saying that's not a joke.
[09:12.000 --> 09:25.000]  Or you die in a plane crash or you die of cancer or you die of pneumonia from some other pneumonia. You will be counted as COVID-19. That's why they've got the graphs. We'll be going over at the bottom of the hour.
[09:25.000 --> 09:46.000]  Suddenly all the deaths from flu and the deaths from cancer and heart attacks, those have all gone down in the graphs and the exact same amount cut off that graph put over on COVID-19 because the hospitals get $39,000 to begin with $39,000 to begin with.
[09:46.000 --> 10:02.000]  I decided to do some digging last night this morning and the other money they get. When you treat COVID patients, period, the hospital gets, depending on its size, between $190,000 and $10 million. And it just goes on and on and on.
[10:02.000 --> 10:12.000]  So that's why they said close up shop. We're a COVID business now. And imagine all the old people suddenly dying in the nursing homes, family not allowed to see what's happening.
[10:12.000 --> 10:23.000]  Now they're prisons. Now they're eugenics death camps. And notice it's the blue cities and the blue states that have perfected the corruption where you see almost all the deaths.
[10:23.000 --> 10:36.000]  Because that's where you've got hospitals where you've got order followers who were very stupid with a few doctors in the bioethics board on top, like Governor Northam, who used to run the baby harvesting program in Virginia.
[10:36.000 --> 10:44.000]  That's why I went on TV and said, we don't need law enforcement and government involved. It's between the doctors and the mother. Notice he doesn't say father.
[10:44.000 --> 10:55.000]  And if the mother decides to terminate and not resuscitate, that's a technical term, the baby's alive and fine, then we keep them comfortable while they harvest the organs.
[10:55.000 --> 11:06.000]  Keep them alive sometimes two weeks. Have a special ward. Okay, we took care of your baby. It's gone now. It's an award. They wait till the orders come in for the organs. Keep them comfortable.
[11:06.000 --> 11:12.000]  And those nurses are making half million a piece because they are carrying out Nazi operations.
[11:12.000 --> 11:23.000]  Now, I know this all sounds shocking, ladies and gentlemen, but remember Austin, Texas, Dallas, Texas, Chicago, Illinois, New York City, Los Angeles, California.
[11:23.000 --> 11:32.000]  Remember all the 60 minutes pieces? There were five or six of them in the 90s about them caught killing patients for their organs.
[11:32.000 --> 11:40.000]  A guy would go in from a car wreck talking, but he was healthy and they happen to have somebody that wanted that liver. Yoas did.
[11:40.000 --> 11:55.000]  So we're going to find the interview and re-air it. And we're going to get these nurses back on that six years ago, we had nurses on who, again, said that they were keeping the babies in the premium area alive.
[11:55.000 --> 12:04.000]  But then the bioethics board, that's the eugenics board, would order them to be vaccinated when they were three pounds or whatever, and almost all of them would stop breathing or dying or have convulsions.
[12:04.000 --> 12:12.000]  They knew how to give them Benadryl. They knew how to, you know, because it's quick enough, you know, being attacked by a killer hornet.
[12:12.000 --> 12:22.000]  And they would put them on a respirator and save them. And the hospitals are like, don't you do that anymore?
[12:22.000 --> 12:29.000]  Remember the Bayer Pharmaceutical got caught in the 90s shipping out to millions HIV tainted drugs and with hepatitis.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  And it came out in court documents. They said, well, we don't need these hemophiliacs anyways.
[12:34.000 --> 12:53.000]  So until you realize the horror of the big pharma complex and how evil it is and how it comes out of the eugenicists and how U.S. big pharma and British pharma created Hitler and created IBM and credit it all until you realize who they are, you don't have any hope.
[12:53.000 --> 12:59.000]  You think they stopped with injecting black people and Tuskegee with syphilis? Everybody knows about that.
[12:59.000 --> 13:12.000]  That's the tip of the iceberg, ladies and gentlemen. Now, the average doctor or nurse is a good person. That's why by the thousands, they're all over the place saying, hey, this is terrible.
[13:12.000 --> 13:20.000]  We're killing people. It's a lie. And what does YouTube do? They ban them. They block them.
[13:20.000 --> 13:28.000]  Peter Sinai comes out and says, Trump's right. This is a light treatment. We told them about it. They ban them because they're not John Hopkins.
[13:28.000 --> 13:41.000]  That with the U.N. Ability Bill and the Gates Foundation, with the Ford Foundation, Rockefeller Foundation, that event 201 in October of last year, which was a coronavirus 65 million dead total martial law.
[13:41.000 --> 13:54.000]  Because you can get arrested if you're Bill Gates, if you're openly launching this op. So you have a drill. You have the drill while you're commanding the op. Everybody just knows, oh, let's run the op.
[13:54.000 --> 14:03.000]  It's a drill. And then it's the exact operation. So we were on the phone. Oh, just checking in on your tabletop. How is that going? And everyone's drilled and prepared.
[14:03.000 --> 14:15.000]  That's why they had drills on 911 and drills in Oklahoma City and drills so the criminal groups can bootleg the operation during the drill.
[14:15.000 --> 14:21.000]  We're going to go to break and come back and talk about more of this. But now you're seeing they told you, oh, it's just two weeks.
[14:21.000 --> 14:27.000]  Governor Newsom said, and once he had you in the trap, he says, hey, it's going to be years.
[14:27.000 --> 14:38.000]  Now, as I go to break, I want to encourage listeners to just on a regular basis, protect your body, beef up your defenses and be a healthy person.
[14:38.000 --> 14:49.000]  There's a lot of crazy stuff going on there and all these people inside are incubating all these, you know, things that are petri dishes to then absolutely cause unbelievable outbreaks.
[14:49.000 --> 15:01.000]  So I personally am getting as much sun as possible. I personally am taking as much vitamin D3 as possible. I personally am taking a lot of zinc and I'm taking a lot of X2, deep earth, clean iodine.
[15:01.000 --> 15:10.000]  That's back in stock after months of being gone. 50% off. Real Redbill, Real Redbill Plus is shelling out, but I've still got it at 50% off.
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  It's got the zinc, but all the other vitamins and minerals in the preglonone. That's an adult formula.
[15:14.000 --> 15:22.000]  One mineral fusion is back in stock, still 50% off. And it's got, that's for adults and children. It's fruit punch flavored, so it really gets absorbed well.
[15:22.000 --> 15:30.000]  And we also have krill oil back in stock. And if you don't know what krill oil does, we'll just research it for yourself.
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  Also, bodies, our ultimate tumor formula is selling out. Despite all that, everything's 50% off.
[15:35.000 --> 15:41.000]  I said I wasn't going to do that this year. I did in the first few months because of all this, almost all of our products are 50% off.
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  And I want to encourage you to get them while you still can, because the chain reaction and the economy have not turned back soon.
[15:46.000 --> 15:51.000]  I mean, the supply chain completely breaks down, not just with meat. Like we told you 12 weeks ago, what happened?
[15:51.000 --> 15:57.000]  Now it's all going to unravel. We must turn back soon or it's too late.
[15:57.000 --> 16:04.000]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy used by half.
[16:04.000 --> 16:14.000]  And the United States wouldn't sign on to it. So guess what happened? Along came COVID-19 and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[16:14.000 --> 16:25.000]  And that means you're going to be poor now and under his control. And of course, with the medical tyranny comes the force inoculations, a eke microchip that comes with the vaccine and so much more.
[16:25.000 --> 16:30.000]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[16:30.000 --> 16:35.000]  So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[16:35.000 --> 16:39.000]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long, women own their bodies.
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.000]  Now say you don't own your body and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  And if you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home, mark the beast.
[16:47.000 --> 16:54.000]  Oh, and guess what? Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates and are a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face.
[16:54.000 --> 16:56.000]  They hate you and your family.
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.000]  How do you put a people under house arrest? How do you put them under siege?
[17:00.000 --> 17:15.000]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist deep state and then had China release to then take down the populist president and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[17:15.000 --> 17:33.000]  Bill Ma or even admitted it. Man, I hope we have a depression. Now they've tailored the whole thing with the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed along with the help of the blue cities and blue states all the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[17:33.000 --> 17:40.000]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us. But as for me, I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it.
[17:40.000 --> 17:46.000]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keep everybody safe. But that's not what they're doing.
[17:46.000 --> 18:11.000]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health, our whole world and committing millions of third world people to death.
[18:16.000 --> 18:26.000]  Live from the global stronghold Austin from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.000]  Okay, I'm going to lay the heavy facts on you right now.
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.000]  Next segment. You see my folder of research. David Knight's going to be in here as well.
[18:35.000 --> 18:44.000]  We're going to show you devastating proof that every model put out has been a conscious fraud by design scientifically.
[18:44.000 --> 18:49.000]  And of course, we predicted they would tell you, oh, two years for a vaccine to make you beg for it.
[18:49.000 --> 18:55.000]  And then, oh, only a year and a half and only eight months. Oh, actually, we may have one in two or three months.
[18:55.000 --> 18:59.000]  They're now saying it's all been war game.
[18:59.000 --> 19:07.000]  But if you don't read the Rockefeller Foundation and the Carnegie Foundation and the WHO, and if you don't watch 20 hour symposiums in Switzerland,
[19:07.000 --> 19:15.000]  by the WHO, you don't know this. Well, guess what? I'm obsessed with it. I do know.
[19:15.000 --> 19:23.000]  And we can stop these criminals, but you got to admit they're criminals and you got to stop submitting.
[19:23.000 --> 19:27.000]  Now, let's lay it out.
[19:27.000 --> 19:32.000]  The big question is, will there be a second wave in the fall and in the winter?
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  100% because it gives the globalist power.
[19:37.000 --> 19:43.000]  It gives them control of the economy. It helps them bring in the casual society and the post human robot society.
[19:43.000 --> 19:50.000]  This is communist China beta beta testing in 2018, their casual society social credit score.
[19:50.000 --> 19:56.000]  It went operational this year. They're now operational. We're going into beta.
[19:56.000 --> 20:03.000]  The federal government, state governments, local governments, universities are all testing the social credit score that was already ready,
[20:03.000 --> 20:07.000]  developed by Walmart and MIT, given the communist China for testing.
[20:07.000 --> 20:13.000]  Now, Walmart suddenly has monitors up showing that scanning your face and social distancing.
[20:13.000 --> 20:21.000]  Then it matches your ID when you buy products itself checkout and is enrolling you in the system involuntarily.
[20:21.000 --> 20:29.000]  It's all here. It's the rollout. It's the revolution. It's the takeover.
[20:29.000 --> 20:34.000]  So let's talk about what's really going to happen.
[20:34.000 --> 20:43.000]  If you want to release a weapon, it's got to kill some people just like the common cold, but you need to own it.
[20:43.000 --> 20:54.000]  It needs to be patented so you can already have the DNA virus, non RNA system set up, which they have.
[20:54.000 --> 21:00.000]  This is a total rollout. Gates is funding publicly seven vaccines right now.
[21:00.000 --> 21:08.000]  They have special ones for each region. You're just going to get sterilized by this and have cancer viruses implanted in you.
[21:08.000 --> 21:13.000]  That's bad enough. But if you're in Africa, oh, you're dead.
[21:13.000 --> 21:19.000]  But let's continue seven special vaccines, depending on your region.
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  This is a mass test, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  You don't understand I'm risking my life telling you all this, but it doesn't matter because we're all dead anyways.
[21:27.000 --> 21:30.000]  If we don't stand up against this, we're going to be soft killed.
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  And then it won't matter when it all comes out.
[21:32.000 --> 21:41.000]  We've got cancer in five years, 10 years, or suddenly we're infertile because it'll just be, oh, we don't know why that happened.
[21:41.000 --> 21:44.000]  This is their plan. This is their admission.
[21:44.000 --> 21:49.000]  So all of us have coronaviruses in us. All of us have had the common cold.
[21:49.000 --> 21:50.000]  That's what coronaviruses are.
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.000]  Corona for crown around the sun. Crown comes from the ring around the sun.
[21:55.000 --> 22:04.000]  From sun worship, they would take a crown and then that's where you get those Egyptian crowns and then European crowns and all the rest of it.
[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  It means the ring or fire.
[22:06.000 --> 22:10.000]  The ring of fire, just like the Johnny Cash song.
[22:10.000 --> 22:16.000]  I went down, down, down to burn and ring of fire and it burns, burns, burns.
[22:16.000 --> 22:19.000]  The ring of fire, the ring of fire.
[22:19.000 --> 22:30.000]  That's why in 2012, they had a coronavirus killing the earth children and the Grim Reaper taking them up to heaven in that bizarre occult ritual at the Olympics.
[22:30.000 --> 22:38.000]  Because they always, so many times I read, the ultimate bio weapon would be a weaponized airborne cold.
[22:38.000 --> 22:40.000]  But see, coronaviruses are in you. They're everywhere.
[22:40.000 --> 22:41.000]  Most of them are harmless.
[22:41.000 --> 22:47.000]  Every couple thousand mutations I was reading, there might be one that actually makes you sick.
[22:47.000 --> 22:51.000]  That's when you're run down and you don't have enough zinc and enough vitamin D3 on record.
[22:51.000 --> 22:54.000]  The NIH says that, but that's on the NIH website.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  Not what Fauci says out of his mouth because they don't want you protected.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  They want you desperate.
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  They don't want you to know you can get D3 for free from the sun.
[23:01.000 --> 23:05.000]  No need to buy our winter sun, by the way, that's about to sell out.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  Newsom says don't go to the beaches.
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  They all say France.
[23:08.000 --> 23:09.000]  Don't go to the beaches.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  Helicopters patrolling the beaches.
[23:11.000 --> 23:15.000]  New York City cops pulling guns on people and tackling them because they're the heroes.
[23:15.000 --> 23:22.000]  They're going to show you to stay in your house, to stay in that apartment building with recirculated air and to get sick.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  They need more death.
[23:24.000 --> 23:31.000]  Of course, the average officer doesn't know that when he's knocking some kid's teeth out on the pavement and punching him in the head.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  He's doing it for his own good.
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  You can be a carrier.
[23:34.000 --> 23:36.000]  Oh, none of you can be trusted.
[23:36.000 --> 23:43.000]  But the medical workers, they can all be trusted when they get $39,000 for each extra person with COVID-19.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  Even more when they die.
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  There's a bounty now.
[23:47.000 --> 23:50.000]  It's now valuable to say you've got it.
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  And the coroners admit we're just told, put it on there.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  The medical examiners, the doctors, we're just told to say it.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  We've got a couple new clips when we come back.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  We'll play for you.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  But this is the mind control.
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  So all of us have it in us.
[24:05.000 --> 24:08.000]  So now all of us are suspect.
[24:08.000 --> 24:09.000]  All of us are bad.
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  And now they're saying, oh, even if you've had the vaccine, it's going to come back.
[24:12.000 --> 24:15.000]  There's going to be new versions, so the vaccine won't even work.
[24:15.000 --> 24:18.000]  And oh, even if you have the antibodies, that's not good enough.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  See, nothing's good enough now because everyone's bad.
[24:21.000 --> 24:28.000]  Remember, the carbon tax states that all carbon is bad and that water vapor is bad coming out of our power plants.
[24:28.000 --> 24:29.000]  China's are totally dirty.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  Ours are totally clean.
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  So they mentioned carbon dioxide as a pollutant.
[24:34.000 --> 24:35.000]  What do you exhale?
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  What do plants breathe?
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  Carbon dioxide.
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.000]  Your carbon is bad.
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  Well, your coronavirus is bad.
[24:41.000 --> 24:47.000]  You pick something everybody's got to teach you that you're non-essential.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  The human economy has to stand down.
[24:50.000 --> 25:03.000]  So the robot 5G globalist economy that they control that's autonomous, that they program and will follow their orders, takes over, and is in prisoners, is our jail guards.
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  But they'll deliver us medicine and food.
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.000]  And that's why you heard Jeff Bezos getting everybody ready.
[25:09.000 --> 25:19.000]  He's going to have these hundred story buildings with hives of tens of thousands of drones that come out and they deliver your food and they take you things and you...
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  If you're not allowed to leave.
[25:21.000 --> 25:27.000]  So they teach British children 10 years ago in little TV programs they show in the elementary schools about mega-opolis.
[25:27.000 --> 25:28.000]  Look it up on YouTube.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  It's still there and it's like, you're not allowed to leave your house without a special card.
[25:32.000 --> 25:37.000]  You only get meat once a year and little robots are your friends and make sure you behave.
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  But if you don't, you can be carrying a virus.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  They're going to have to kill you.
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.000]  And they even have shows in Canada now with their health minister saying, looking like a robot.
[25:47.000 --> 25:48.000]  It's crazy.
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.000]  It's at the end of Paul Watson's latest video, COVID-1984, where she looks up at a science fiction.
[25:54.000 --> 26:00.000]  She goes, everyone will have bracelets and vaccines to be able to leave and travel or to be on the streets.
[26:00.000 --> 26:07.000]  And then it cuts to checkpoints leaving the city will take you to emergency government camps if you've refused the vaccine.
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  And it's just all dystopia, dystopia.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  Instead of denying it now, they're just throwing it all completely in your face with pleasure.
[26:16.000 --> 26:23.000]  The end of human civilization, a total avalanche collapse of human systems.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  Because humans are dirty.
[26:25.000 --> 26:26.000]  Humans are bad.
[26:26.000 --> 26:31.000]  Humans can't work 24 hours a day like a robot bulldozer or a robot helicopter.
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.000]  But again, it's all about making you not essential, not essential.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  You're being taught instead of us saying, hey, we're humans.
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  We want a human world built for us by us.
[26:41.000 --> 26:42.000]  We're being taught, oh, you're bad for the earth.
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  No, no, no.
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  The elites are going to teach you that you're obsolete and then make you obsolete.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  So then they can release the real bio weapons and kill your ass.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.000]  And the robots will go in, clean you out of your houses where you children in place and load you into trash trucks.
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  We'll be right back.
[26:55.000 --> 27:03.000]  Globalism is all about making the nation state and the population itself obsolete, non essential.
[27:03.000 --> 27:12.000]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States
[27:12.000 --> 27:16.000]  has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[27:16.000 --> 27:22.000]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out,
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  they can simply look at us and say, because again, you are not essential.
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  We can be told to stay on our houses.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  And after all, shut up.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways.
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.000]  It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.000]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[27:49.000 --> 27:55.000]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[27:55.000 --> 28:05.000]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[28:05.000 --> 28:10.000]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date,
[28:10.000 --> 28:21.000]  super male vitality, specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses,
[28:26.000 --> 28:32.000]  and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[28:32.000 --> 28:33.000]  Yes.
[28:33.000 --> 28:38.000]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology,
[28:38.000 --> 28:45.000]  working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[28:45.000 --> 28:46.000]  So what are you waiting for?
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  Never been a better time than right now.
[28:50.000 --> 28:55.000]  Super male vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.000]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight.
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.000]  If other human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying,
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  if you don't spread the word, if you don't buy the products to fund our operation,
[29:05.000 --> 29:08.000]  the dog doesn't hunt, but you get that.
[29:08.000 --> 29:09.000]  You are patriots.
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  You are people that live and work in the real world of erase color and create and understand what's happening.
[29:14.000 --> 29:17.000]  And that's why when you call in and thank me for what I've done, it's really a sick joke.
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  Thank you for what you've done.
[29:19.000 --> 29:20.000]  We're all of this together.
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  We believe in the rights of the unborn.
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.000]  We believe in families.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  We believe in the right to self-defense.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.000]  We believe in capitalism and America and Jesus Christ, number one.
[29:28.000 --> 29:30.000]  And we believe in free speech.
[29:30.000 --> 29:35.000]  And so the fact that you shopped with us and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  does everything in the world.
[29:37.000 --> 29:40.000]  That's why I salute you and I thank you continually,
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.000]  because the globalists thought they'd have this whole planet sewn up by now.
[29:43.000 --> 29:45.000]  They thought they'd be in charge.
[29:45.000 --> 29:50.000]  They thought they would have won, but they didn't count on you and I and others coming together.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  So God bless you all.
[29:52.000 --> 29:57.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.000]  We're going to be showing you graphs and documents and reports directly
[30:27.000 --> 30:32.000]  from the supposed most prestigious scientific institutes that told us
[30:32.000 --> 30:35.000]  we'd have 5 million dead, 2 million dead in America.
[30:35.000 --> 30:41.000]  And then now they're telling us, oh, well, it doesn't matter if it's, you know, only 70,000.
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  It's going to go forever.
[30:43.000 --> 30:45.000]  And you can't ever leave America.
[30:45.000 --> 30:52.000]  And life, as you know, it is over and only robots can take control of you and run your life.
[30:52.000 --> 30:58.000]  And then at the start of the next hour, we've got a compilation of medical doctors and scientists
[30:58.000 --> 31:05.000]  and others coming out and nurses and saying, we're being ordered with people that haven't even tested
[31:05.000 --> 31:10.000]  for COVID to say they died of COVID because the hospital gets an extra 39.
[31:10.000 --> 31:18.000]  But it's a lot worse than that. Small clinics get 140, $190,000 for just saying they'll treat COVID patients.
[31:18.000 --> 31:20.000]  Big hospitals, tens of millions.
[31:20.000 --> 31:26.000]  It's all incentivized and was all pre-programmed and ready by the global bioethics boards.
[31:26.000 --> 31:32.000]  That again, are the same bioethics boards now that say, oh, it's okay to keep babies alive and harvest their organs.
[31:32.000 --> 31:36.000]  Because the bioethics board says that child is going to die of COVID.
[31:36.000 --> 31:43.000]  So even though it's breathing, if we're not going to decide to keep it alive, we call that non-resuscitation.
[31:43.000 --> 31:44.000]  It's a technical term.
[31:44.000 --> 31:47.000]  You think resuscitation means somebody stopped breathing.
[31:47.000 --> 31:51.000]  You perform CPR, do the paddles, defibrillate.
[31:51.000 --> 31:56.000]  No, it's a legal term that they now take them out of the dead zone, the phantom zone,
[31:56.000 --> 32:00.000]  and so they can live because the doctor and the mother decide.
[32:00.000 --> 32:03.000]  And then they, quote, keep them comfortable till they die.
[32:03.000 --> 32:06.000]  And that many times harvest the organs.
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  Mama might as well get paid the money for the organs.
[32:08.000 --> 32:12.000]  After all, she grew the little pot pocket that they think is not a human.
[32:12.000 --> 32:19.000]  So David Knight, who is, again, a host of the David Knight Show, 8 a.m. weekdays, engineer, great patriot, filmmaker.
[32:19.000 --> 32:20.000]  Here we are.
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  And I want to walk through these statistics.
[32:22.000 --> 32:23.000]  I want to go over these numbers.
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  I want everybody to tell their friends and family neighbors, however you're watching or listening.
[32:26.000 --> 32:34.000]  Everybody tune in right now to band.video, tune into infowars.com, forward slash show.
[32:34.000 --> 32:35.000]  It takes you right for life.
[32:35.000 --> 32:36.000]  Each share that.
[32:36.000 --> 32:38.000]  That's how we cause the chain reaction that shakes the world.
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  We'll get into statistics next segment.
[32:40.000 --> 32:47.000]  But just looking at coronavirus, 13 year old with COVID-19 died alone without his family around him.
[32:47.000 --> 32:50.000]  Friends say they do whatever they want now in secret.
[32:50.000 --> 32:51.000]  Now it's not just babies.
[32:51.000 --> 32:52.000]  They're going to kill.
[32:52.000 --> 32:53.000]  Now it's adults.
[32:53.000 --> 32:56.000]  Doctors are incentivized as COVID-19 on death certificates.
[32:56.000 --> 33:00.000]  Even USA Today confirmed that this is not an opinion.
[33:00.000 --> 33:04.000]  Mass death in nursing homes turns out that that's a cash cow.
[33:04.000 --> 33:05.000]  It's LA Times admits this.
[33:05.000 --> 33:07.000]  This is all been actuaried out.
[33:07.000 --> 33:12.000]  And this is the bioethics boards, the big corporations with the death panels going operational David Knight.
[33:12.000 --> 33:17.000]  You know, Alex, you talked about that, that 13 year old who died with COVID-19.
[33:17.000 --> 33:22.000]  Now there was a story that was out last week, end of the week.
[33:22.000 --> 33:27.000]  And they were talking about a young child who basically died and came back to life.
[33:27.000 --> 33:29.000]  And they said, died from coronavirus.
[33:29.000 --> 33:34.000]  And I said, well, you know, I woke up and they told me that I had coronavirus and in the process of that article.
[33:34.000 --> 33:35.000]  And I don't know about this 13 year old.
[33:35.000 --> 33:36.000]  I haven't read that one.
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.000]  But the other one where they say they died and they came back to life.
[33:39.000 --> 33:48.000]  If you read that article buried in the article, they say, well, you know, we typically see with these young patients because we're not seeing reports from Europe and other places.
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  We got essentially zero deaths from young people.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  It's typically people have multiple conditions.
[33:53.000 --> 34:03.000]  People who are elderly, they said, we typically see some really strange symptoms that are not characteristic for coronavirus exhibiting in these young kids who get it and who die from it.
[34:03.000 --> 34:07.000]  And it was really strange because this child didn't have any COVID-19 symptoms.
[34:07.000 --> 34:16.000]  And then in the article, Alex, they don't say what it was, but they say this child also had another virus, but they don't say what that virus was.
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.000]  But they attribute it to COVID-19.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  The press does it. The CDC does it.
[34:21.000 --> 34:29.000]  First, they begin by saying, well, if you come in, you got respiratory issues and no matter how many other issues you've got, you may be in stage four lung cancer.
[34:29.000 --> 34:34.000]  But if we find that you've got COVID-19, we're going to cause that, call that the underlying cause of death.
[34:34.000 --> 34:36.000]  But then they added that and we're not even going to test.
[34:36.000 --> 34:37.000]  We're talking about the next segment.
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.000]  We now know this.
[34:38.000 --> 34:39.000]  We're going to put it together.
[34:39.000 --> 34:40.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[34:40.000 --> 34:41.000]  Everybody already knows this.
[34:41.000 --> 34:48.000]  Everybody I talked to is freaking out saying, oh my God, all the models were wrong and they're saying the lockdown is even worse now.
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.000]  And they know there's a global depression.
[34:50.000 --> 34:52.000]  People now understand that the trap has closed.
[34:52.000 --> 34:56.000]  Americans were willing to go along with this because they believed it might help somebody.
[34:56.000 --> 35:00.000]  Now that they know it's overall a giant hoax and a power grab, they're getting really pissed.
[35:00.000 --> 35:02.000]  What do you think people need to do?
[35:02.000 --> 35:03.000]  What does Trump need to do?
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.000]  Well, let me tell you what.
[35:04.000 --> 35:10.000]  Trump's got to get rid of Fauci and he's got to get rid of Berks because they're the people who are scaring the population.
[35:10.000 --> 35:17.000]  The next phase of this, Alex, we can talk about what's happened in the past, but let me tell you what's happening right now and going to happen in the future with this data.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  The lockdown, total depression.
[35:19.000 --> 35:22.000]  Phase two is, you know, the air comes back.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  We're going to have the return of the virus.
[35:24.000 --> 35:31.000]  And they already said before anything opened up here in Texas, for example, when Abbott said, well, we're going to let people open up 25, 50 percent.
[35:31.000 --> 35:34.000]  But they said, already look, we've had a spike.
[35:34.000 --> 35:41.000]  Now, what they're telling everybody, what they're preparing everybody for is the new narrative is going to be, see, you opened up and now everybody is dying.
[35:41.000 --> 35:48.000]  So we've got to lock you down hard and we've got to keep you locked down. Harvard and Facebook and all these people saying we're not going to have any meetings.
[35:48.000 --> 35:52.000]  We're not going to have any classrooms that go 2021, 2022, depending on the institution.
[35:52.000 --> 35:54.000]  They want to keep everything locked down.
[35:54.000 --> 36:00.000]  You just had all these globalist groups are openly saying with big tech and Harvard, oh, we're never opening up.
[36:00.000 --> 36:01.000]  And then that sets the precedent.
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  Well, they're never opening up because communist China set the precedent.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  But notice communist China is opened up.
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.000]  This is psychotic.
[36:08.000 --> 36:17.000]  Yeah. And so this is the West dying and shutting down and causing tens of millions of deaths worldwide because when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[36:17.000 --> 36:25.000]  Literally over saying anyone that has any type of genetic material from any cold virus is, you know, is now an evil person.
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  I mean, this is a very well planned operation.
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.000]  They're not going to go back and defend their statistics, which basically are collapsed lies.
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.000]  Now, instead, they're going to come up with new lies and they're going to push a new agenda of fear.
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  And this is the second stage, Alex.
[36:39.000 --> 36:42.000]  And the first stage, they had everybody afraid and sheltering in their house.
[36:42.000 --> 36:45.000]  OCD, obsessive compulsive.
[36:45.000 --> 36:46.000]  We're afraid of germs everywhere.
[36:46.000 --> 36:58.000]  The next phase is to attack the people who are taking back their jobs, taking back their liberty, calling them terrorists saying you're threatening our lives because we've got statistics that show this is now gone up.
[36:58.000 --> 37:01.000]  That's the next phase is saying people that march on the Capitol are Nazis and terrorists.
[37:01.000 --> 37:02.000]  That's right.
[37:02.000 --> 37:04.000]  People that don't wear their mask or terrorist.
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.000]  Even though the governor said we can't make you wear mask in Texas, I go in stores, they say, get out of here, get out of here.
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  And I'm like, hey, you understand that it's incredibly rare to even die from this.
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  They don't know they're ignorant.
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  They love it.
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  They love getting into it, even though their whole future is being destroyed by evil globalists.
[37:20.000 --> 37:22.000]  They just, it's just another SJW thing.
[37:22.000 --> 37:23.000]  Yeah.
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.000]  Oh, yeah.
[37:24.000 --> 37:30.000]  When you look at the beginning of this, they took the same approach that they took to mandatory vaccines.
[37:30.000 --> 37:32.000]  The same approach they took to gun control.
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.000]  We've got two dozen people that have been shot in a single shooting.
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  So we're going to take guns from millions of people.
[37:37.000 --> 37:38.000]  Canada's just did that.
[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  Canada's been in the hospital.
[37:39.000 --> 37:40.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[37:40.000 --> 37:43.000]  And they did the same thing with mandatory vaccines.
[37:43.000 --> 37:50.000]  We had in the beginning of this year and also last year, we got a couple of incidents where somebody flew into LAX, they had measles.
[37:50.000 --> 37:52.000]  So we quarantined 300 people.
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  Now nobody died, but they quarantined everybody.
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  They use this last year to start imposing mandatory law.
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  They're making almost no one ever dies of measles.
[37:59.000 --> 38:00.000]  That's right.
[38:00.000 --> 38:01.000]  That's right.
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  Again, everybody my age has already had it.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  So we've got real immunity to it.
[38:05.000 --> 38:10.000]  What they're doing is, is they're teaching everyone to be hysterical and to be mentally ill and to be neurotic.
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  That's right.
[38:11.000 --> 38:16.000]  And like Fauci said, imagine if aliens landed and they said, humans may no longer shake hands.
[38:16.000 --> 38:23.000]  You see headlines in England that the police with binoculars see a husband and wife kissing in their house and come and arrest them.
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  Yeah.
[38:24.000 --> 38:30.000]  Nigel Farage went down and showed the immigrant boats coming in and talked to locals about the invasion of Muslims
[38:30.000 --> 38:34.000]  and how, you know, 100,000 people are flying in a week right now to England.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  The police came to his house.
[38:36.000 --> 38:40.000]  So people can fly in to England all day.
[38:40.000 --> 38:41.000]  Okay.
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  From all the world.
[38:42.000 --> 38:47.000]  But if a member of parliament, a member of the EU parliament, a guy that could be prime minister, the main advisor to the prime minister,
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  he goes and shows the Muslim invasion.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  The police come to his house.
[38:51.000 --> 38:52.000]  We catch you kissing your wife.
[38:52.000 --> 38:53.000]  You're going to jail.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  Imagine 1984.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  You were allowed to kiss your wife in Islamic States.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  You're allowed to kiss your wife.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  This is a total anti-human cult.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  Like these people are space aliens.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  You asked what President Trump needs to do.
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  It's absolutely personal as policy.
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.000]  That's the axiom.
[39:08.000 --> 39:09.000]  It's absolutely true.
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.000]  The policy is being set by Fauci and by Berks because they're allowed to stay there.
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  They've been there for decades and they've got to get rid of them.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  And the policy is the Rockefeller Institute.
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  That's right.
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  Is, is event 201 is bill amount of gates.
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  I mean, it's a fact.
[39:21.000 --> 39:28.000]  But the danger here, Alex, is that, you know, as they throw these ideas out and as they continue to stand there and gas light and panic,
[39:28.000 --> 39:30.000]  the public, they're going to be afraid to come.
[39:30.000 --> 39:35.000]  Even if the business is open, they're going to be afraid to come out and go to the businesses in Georgia.
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  The guy opened up and said, hey, we thought we'd have 10% of the business.
[39:38.000 --> 39:39.000]  We only had two people the entire weekend.
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.000]  And that's because people have been buffaloed.
[39:42.000 --> 39:43.000]  They've been panicked.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  But all the big box stores, they're all open.
[39:45.000 --> 39:46.000]  That's right.
[39:46.000 --> 39:47.000]  It's socially okay to go there.
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  I tell you, shopping at big stores now is death.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  We'll be right back with the statistics.
[39:51.000 --> 40:03.000]  When one studies history and human nature, you learn very quickly that rugged individualism and people to think for themselves,
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  build free societies, innovate to amazing things.
[40:07.000 --> 40:15.000]  But those that love to grovel, those that love to be subservient, those that love to comply and think that it's a virtue,
[40:15.000 --> 40:21.000]  they create stagnation, corruption, tyranny, and then finally collapse.
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  And the world is now being tested.
[40:25.000 --> 40:31.000]  And we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole lives believing
[40:31.000 --> 40:37.000]  if they just submit down a bigger way, somehow they'll create a heavenly future.
[40:37.000 --> 40:47.000]  But the technocrats running the global system are oppressive at anti-human and are psychotic and are building an anti-human future.
[40:47.000 --> 40:53.000]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder on your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  What are champions made of?
[40:58.000 --> 41:07.000]  Here's a man who can show you.
[41:07.000 --> 41:33.000]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine is the info or store hotline.
[41:33.000 --> 41:40.000]  Info or store dot com is simply the best. Info or store dot com beats out all the rest.
[41:40.000 --> 41:47.000]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine is the info or store hotline.
[41:47.000 --> 41:55.000]  Triple eight, two five, three, three, one, three, nine is the info or store hotline.
[41:55.000 --> 42:03.000]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion people, extra 500 million,
[42:03.000 --> 42:10.000]  are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown.
[42:10.000 --> 42:15.000]  That is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19
[42:15.000 --> 42:25.000]  and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society,
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  create a depression and forcibly inoculate everybody. This is insane.
[42:28.000 --> 42:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over. You need to get prepared now.
[42:32.000 --> 42:37.000]  You need to get high quality, storeable food now back in stock at infoorstore.com
[42:37.000 --> 42:41.000]  and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[42:41.000 --> 42:47.000]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people and to send you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[42:47.000 --> 42:53.000]  This is beyond 1984. The tyranny of the dual orders here. Get prepared now and spread the word in the info war.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[42:55.000 --> 43:00.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars can now offer high quality, storeable food again.
[43:00.000 --> 43:06.000]  Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago and they told people they had food.
[43:06.000 --> 43:13.000]  Most folks who never would deliver their food. Well, when our sponsors food began to run short,
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.000]  they just spent sales, so they opened more factories and secured more food.
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  So the eager orders in right now, they can take new orders and get it to you quickly.
[43:23.000 --> 43:32.000]  You'll probably have to suspend orders very, very soon again because the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution, farming, you name it.
[43:32.000 --> 43:37.000]  The mainstream news, the food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen.
[43:37.000 --> 43:44.000]  If Trump could turn the economy back on and rest control of our system away from the globalist, things may be okay,
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  but it looks like it's going to get very, very rough.
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.000]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure the number one thing you need.
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  High quality, storeable food ready to get to you and your family now.
[43:53.000 --> 44:06.000]  Get your orders in at 4store.com.
[44:06.000 --> 44:23.000]  I'm Alex Jones in studio with my co-host, David Knight. We're about to start getting into statistics and numbers.
[44:23.000 --> 44:29.000]  At the start of the next hour, we're going to have a compilation, just a small portion of doctors and nurses saying we're basically incentivized.
[44:29.000 --> 44:38.000]  We ordered, we're paid to put COVID-19 into the books, even if somebody hasn't been tested, even if somebody hasn't had it.
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  The funeral homes are saying that as well.
[44:40.000 --> 44:52.000]  Project Veritas has exposed that this is a criminal action set up by Fauci, set up by the NIH, all pre-programmed for years with the Rockefeller Foundation, with Bill Gates.
[44:52.000 --> 44:57.000]  Here's this one clip of what's coming up, Dr. Scott Jensen on Fox News talking about it.
[44:57.000 --> 45:04.000]  Right now, Medicare has determined that if you have a COVID-19 admission to the hospital, you'll get paid $13,000.
[45:04.000 --> 45:11.000]  If that COVID-19 patient goes on a ventilator, you get $39,000, three times as much.
[45:11.000 --> 45:18.000]  Nobody can tell me after 35 years in the world of medicine that sometimes those kinds of things impact on what we do.
[45:18.000 --> 45:24.000]  And it absolutely does. A bounty on doing this. And doctors come out and say the ventilators are killing people.
[45:24.000 --> 45:29.000]  But oh, we need more ventilators because it's all in the blue states. Blue states are dangerous.
[45:29.000 --> 45:33.000]  80 to 90% of people who put on invasive ventilators are dying from this.
[45:33.000 --> 45:40.000]  And I had a clip that was put up by a guy who had 21 years experience as a respiratory therapist.
[45:40.000 --> 45:45.000]  And he said, look behind me. On this side of the room, I've got invasive ventilators.
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  On this side, we have non-invasive ventilators. He goes, I've never seen anything like this in the past.
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.000]  We have somebody comes in with respiratory illness. First, we give them the non-invasive ventilators.
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  We're told you don't do that. You wait until they get very sick.
[45:57.000 --> 46:02.000]  And then he goes, because we can't test them for COVID-19 because they're so backed up on processing the tests.
[46:02.000 --> 46:06.000]  You send it away weeks before you get it back. So he goes, we wait until they get really sick.
[46:06.000 --> 46:10.000]  And then we put them on the invasive ventilators. Alex, you add up those numbers that were just given to us.
[46:10.000 --> 46:16.000]  $13,000, $39,000, $13,000 for diagnosing them as COVID-19, presuming even.
[46:16.000 --> 46:21.000]  And then $39,000 for putting them on the ventilator. That adds up to $52,000.
[46:21.000 --> 46:30.000]  That's the average ventilator cost is $50,000. So they paid for the ventilator with just one COVID diagnosed patient put on that invasive ventilator.
[46:30.000 --> 46:37.000]  They paid for it with a $2,000 profit. Plus they can charge them per day for the usage, plus all the doctor's fees and so forth.
[46:37.000 --> 46:45.000]  And the hospitals, you know, the other part of this incentive is the hospitals are going out of business because they don't have enough COVID patients.
[46:45.000 --> 46:50.000]  And they've been prohibited from seeing the other patients. So that's why you see all these.
[46:50.000 --> 47:00.000]  This is designed to bankrupt healthcare, to bankrupt states and have a globalist Marshall plan that reorganizes everything with robots and more third world labor.
[47:00.000 --> 47:07.000]  How do I know? Well, it's the global plan. But Bloomberg came out with a plan, more foreigners and robots to save us.
[47:07.000 --> 47:08.000]  David, how surprising.
[47:08.000 --> 47:13.000]  Well, think about the robot part of it. OK, we keep seeing people saying, well, here's what the new normal is going to look like.
[47:13.000 --> 47:18.000]  You're going to have robots that are going to help you with healthcare. We're going to have robots that are going to come in and sterilize the place.
[47:18.000 --> 47:22.000]  We're going to have robots cooking your food, robots delivering your food on and on.
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  Because humans are obsolete. We can't go out unless we're in a space suit.
[47:25.000 --> 47:30.000]  Remember that image last year we had of the human on Earth in a space suit? We can pull up the article now.
[47:30.000 --> 47:35.000]  They say you need a space suit to go to a club. And this all sounds crazy. The general public is submitting.
[47:35.000 --> 47:43.000]  If they came out and said, we've got a shortage of space suits. Oh, I want those. And people would wear them.
[47:43.000 --> 47:51.000]  This is serious. Let's start getting into the statistics here. And we'll do this next hour to really get into them.
[47:51.000 --> 47:54.000]  We're going to have Robert Barnes in here who's been doing a great job breaking that down.
[47:54.000 --> 48:01.000]  Well, we can talk about this a couple of different ways. And again, we can go back and we look at the projections from the IMHE,
[48:01.000 --> 48:07.000]  which is a Washington University. Murphy is the guy who was directing it. He created the model.
[48:07.000 --> 48:13.000]  That university is getting, and that institute is getting funding from the Gates Foundation.
[48:13.000 --> 48:16.000]  And so they were the ones that everybody was relying on at the beginning.
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  Basically, his models that were coming out of the IMHE and also out of the Imperial College of London.
[48:20.000 --> 48:28.000]  And it was the Imperial College of London that scared the Trump administration into going with the Fauci recommendations and so forth.
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.000]  And again, the same institutes and groups and universities have told us all ice caps gone by 2013, all ice caps gone by 2017.
[48:35.000 --> 48:42.000]  They're bigger than they've ever been. None of it's ever real because they put the data they want in for the answer to scare you knowing you won't remember later.
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  But every one of those big bell curves you saw were crap. Let's get into them.
[48:46.000 --> 48:51.000]  Well, you know, when you talk about the IMHE, they had projections for things like hospital beds.
[48:51.000 --> 48:57.000]  And remember, that's what this is all about. They were saying, you know, we've got the bell shaped curve, the FAR's law that goes back to the 1840s.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  And you can't go outside because the hospitals were overwhelmed.
[49:00.000 --> 49:02.000]  Well, now they're not overwhelmed. You still can't go outside.
[49:02.000 --> 49:06.000]  This is going to spread so quickly that we won't have the hospital capacity and everybody's going to die.
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  So what they did was they locked everybody down and that's not what they did in Sweden.
[49:10.000 --> 49:15.000]  And that's not what happened. But that was what we were told. And we were told that we had limited number of hospital beds.
[49:15.000 --> 49:18.000]  But Sweden and Brazil didn't do this and they fared way better than us.
[49:18.000 --> 49:21.000]  That's right. They projected the number of hospital beds that they were going to need.
[49:21.000 --> 49:30.000]  That number was off anywhere from a factor of 10 in Washington state where they came up with this model to a factor of 9 in Texas.
[49:30.000 --> 49:39.000]  The closest they got was by overstating it by twice as many hospital beds that they would need and some of the interstates because they had not protected that it would be that high there.
[49:39.000 --> 49:43.000]  But they were off by a factor of 2000 to 1000% on hospital beds.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  When it came to ventilators, it was even worse.
[49:45.000 --> 49:49.000]  With ventilators, they overestimated it by a factor of 40.
[49:49.000 --> 49:56.000]  So you remember all this whining from Cuomo about how, hey, I got 400 ventilators and, you know, Trump, I need 30,000.
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.000]  Why don't we do that? I've got to have 30,000. Well, he didn't need even the 400 that he got.
[50:00.000 --> 50:10.000]  And when they came back to him shortly after that, he said, well, you know, they're in storage somewhere, you know, and now they're dumping these things off because even though they can make money off of this,
[50:10.000 --> 50:13.000]  they don't have enough patients to make this work for them.
[50:13.000 --> 50:17.000]  So we look at what is happening and most of this being focused out of New York.
[50:17.000 --> 50:22.000]  New York has 52% of all the COVID-19 deaths in America.
[50:22.000 --> 50:28.000]  And if you take a look, you combine 41 states together, they have only 21% of the COVID-19 deaths.
[50:28.000 --> 50:32.000]  Why is this happening so much? Why is it so focused in New York?
[50:32.000 --> 50:35.000]  Because it's a mafia running it, killing people and getting the money.
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  Well, that's true. I mean, we've got a lot of different things.
[50:37.000 --> 50:41.000]  I mean, again, they're contacting them together. They're not getting the sun.
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  They've got the subway that's there, you know, that they're going to clean whether they need to or not.
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  They said at the beginning, we're going to clean it every 72 hours.
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  We have about 4 million people come through every 72 hours.
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.000]  So every 4 millionth person, we're going to clean the car.
[50:54.000 --> 51:00.000]  Well, that's a big one, though, here, where they take heart disease, cancer, accident strokes, Alzheimer's flu,
[51:00.000 --> 51:07.000]  and they move it over to COVID. They confirm even Fauci and Scarf Lady admit this.
[51:07.000 --> 51:10.000]  It's a giant fraud in the end.
[51:10.000 --> 51:15.000]  And now the same guy with the graph way down there, you know, 10, 20, 30 times lower than what they said,
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  depending on the graph, they're like, oh, but look, it's spiking.
[51:17.000 --> 51:23.000]  Oh, it's like, it's like molehills. And again, they're contributing most deaths that aren't that to it.
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  Admitting it, this is a gigantic criminal fraud.
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  Talk about a paper tiger.
[51:27.000 --> 51:30.000]  Well, they came out and said that COVID-19 is the number one cause of death.
[51:30.000 --> 51:34.000]  You notice that you had a radical decrease in heart attacks.
[51:34.000 --> 51:37.000]  And there's one doctor I talked about said, what? Nobody's dying from heart attacks anymore.
[51:37.000 --> 51:41.000]  Nobody's dying from influenza. Nobody's dying from these other respiratory disease.
[51:41.000 --> 51:42.000]  And then they admitted.
[51:42.000 --> 51:45.000]  No, we're saying, tell people the two different types of tests,
[51:45.000 --> 51:50.000]  because one has the genetic material, not just the antibodies, that you've had a past fight with the coronavirus.
[51:50.000 --> 51:53.000]  And that's what I've read in the scientific journals is, that's why almost all of it's a false positive,
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  because you can't tell what there was between the virus.
[51:55.000 --> 52:00.000]  And so that's why it's the perfect thing for fear, because as they take the meat pack and plant,
[52:00.000 --> 52:03.000]  where they tested a couple thousand people, I covered this yesterday,
[52:03.000 --> 52:09.000]  and 300 plus were tested positive, all asymptomatic, meaning no symptoms.
[52:09.000 --> 52:14.000]  My God, it's so deadly. 300 plus people have it. Nobody even got a damn fever.
[52:14.000 --> 52:17.000]  That's right. And they find that in the prisons as well, when they go into the prison.
[52:17.000 --> 52:22.000]  So why are we shutting down our economy over disease that people don't even realize that they've got,
[52:22.000 --> 52:23.000]  because they're asymptomatic?
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.000]  And, you know, at the very beginning of this, I had on John Rappaport,
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.000]  because this isn't our first rodeo with pandemics. It's certainly not his.
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  I mean, he's covered these types of things over and over again.
[52:32.000 --> 52:36.000]  And Fauci has been there since 1985 in this very position.
[52:36.000 --> 52:38.000]  And, of course, Alex, he was there.
[52:38.000 --> 52:40.000]  Coincidentally, I just throw this in as an aside.
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  He was there in 1985.
[52:42.000 --> 52:46.000]  1986 was when they gave immunity to the vaccine companies and said,
[52:46.000 --> 52:47.000]  you can't be sued for any of these.
[52:47.000 --> 52:50.000]  Oh, yeah, this guy's above Bill Gates when it comes to rolling this out.
[52:50.000 --> 52:51.000]  Gates is the kingpin.
[52:51.000 --> 52:54.000]  When we come back, we're going to hear what Michael Savage had to say.
[52:54.000 --> 52:57.000]  You have to scratch the surface on statistics.
[52:57.000 --> 53:01.000]  We've got a compilation clip of doctors and others saying it's all a giant fraud.
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  But remember, YouTube's head just came out and said,
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  we don't care what our basement dwellers think.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  This is on infowords.com.
[53:08.000 --> 53:09.000]  It's a quote.
[53:09.000 --> 53:10.000]  We don't care.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  We're going to crush your unauthoritative content.
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  We're only going to listen to doctors.
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.000]  But it's actually medical doctors that are blocking and banning
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  that don't go along with Fauci and the total fraud.
[53:19.000 --> 53:20.000]  There it is.
[53:20.000 --> 53:24.000]  YouTube's chief product officer insults his own users as basement dwelling idiots.
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  That is the pride that goes before the fall.
[53:28.000 --> 53:29.000]  First, let me just throw this in.
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  We have great products that you need.
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  And we need funding to be able to just stay on the air.
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  I can't get into all the things that are going on,
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  but you know we're under mega attack.
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.000]  When you buy products here, you see how we stand in the face of evil
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  because of your commitment to support us.
[53:43.000 --> 53:46.000]  And now as you see everybody being banned, everybody being shut down,
[53:46.000 --> 53:49.000]  as you see Candace Owens getting blocked.
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  And as you see David Ike being banned, they're going to ban everybody.
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.000]  They now say they took Pentagon programs that Democrats are using,
[53:55.000 --> 53:59.000]  Pentagon programs to censor the Internet with AI of quote,
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  you know, anti-government disinfo.
[54:01.000 --> 54:04.000]  But you can overpower with your word of mouth telling folks about
[54:04.000 --> 54:10.000]  infowars.com forward slash show, ban.video, newswars.com forward slash show.
[54:10.000 --> 54:12.000]  And explain to people that the truth is still on the air
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  and you can get high quality, highest in fish oil,
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  highest in krill oil back in stock, 50% off.
[54:18.000 --> 54:21.000]  You can get high quality vitamin mineral fusion, 50% off.
[54:21.000 --> 54:25.000]  You can get real red pill plus 50% off, you know, it's going to sell out.
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  And we've still got affordable food available.
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  But let me tell you, you see the shortage is starting.
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  They may have to hit pause again on taking new orders,
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  get your orders in now while you still can at infowars.com.
[54:34.000 --> 54:38.000]  But whatever you do, pray for a global awakening and pray for info wars
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  and pray for yourself and your family.
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  We'll be right back to the second hour.
[54:44.000 --> 54:47.000]  Look, the globalists are Satanists, all right?
[54:47.000 --> 54:52.000]  Lord Rothschild recently posed at a gallery of art
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  worshipping the devil and praising Lucifer.
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  You cannot make this up.
[54:57.000 --> 54:58.000]  They flaunt it in our face.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  That's what environmentalism is.
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.000]  It's about having an anti-human future and having people live in a subsistence,
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  futile, serf state.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  That's what they want.
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.000]  These people that have stolen the planet are worth trillions of dollars.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  Do not want you having a good life.
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  They know you're having fun.
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  They know you have a great wife, a great husband,
[55:16.000 --> 55:17.000]  great children.
[55:17.000 --> 55:18.000]  They hate your guts.
[55:18.000 --> 55:21.000]  They are the most horrible, evil people on the planet.
[55:21.000 --> 55:27.000]  They openly fund racism, war, degeneracy, pedophilia, everything else.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  Imagine the most horrible thing in the universe
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  and then imagine it doubled, tripled, quadrupled.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  And being gullible and being domesticated
[55:34.000 --> 55:37.000]  just makes them rise up and attack you harder.
[55:37.000 --> 55:40.000]  And they're the ones that launched this whole attack on the planet
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.000]  and they are the enemy of humanity and need to be stood up against.
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  I'm always excited about InfoWar's live products.
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  They're amazing.
[55:48.000 --> 55:49.000]  They're cutting-edge.
[55:49.000 --> 55:50.000]  You love them. I love them.
[55:50.000 --> 55:53.000]  And they fund the InfoWar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  But we have come up with a new product.
[55:56.000 --> 56:00.000]  Over a year in development, that is amazing.
[56:00.000 --> 56:04.000]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  with organic essential oils on top of it.
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  And there's another innovation.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  It's the spray cap.
[56:12.000 --> 56:16.000]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross, goo,
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.000]  I like to put it on my hands, rub a little bit on my face.
[56:23.000 --> 56:26.000]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it around your eyes.
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  But I just love it.
[56:27.000 --> 56:30.000]  Personally, it has something that's a moisturizer as well.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  So, this is a real innovation.
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  that actually has essential oil in it,
[56:37.000 --> 56:40.000]  so it doesn't dry you out and smells great.
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.000]  Like so refreshing, this is a big winner.
[57:10.000 --> 57:15.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  And you hear the franticness in my voice.
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  You hear the franticness in David Knight's voice.
[57:19.000 --> 57:23.000]  I've known David nine years, even before he worked here
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  and is aware of his filmmaking.
[57:25.000 --> 57:28.000]  This is like watching your neighbors get robbed and raped,
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  and then now they're coming to your house to rape you
[57:30.000 --> 57:31.000]  and you're tied up.
[57:31.000 --> 57:35.000]  Or it's like watching, let's say you're an amateur astronomer
[57:35.000 --> 57:39.000]  and you see this planetoid coming towards the earth
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  and you call it the local observatory
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  and they go, you're a conspiracy terrorist.
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  And suddenly hundreds of you and your neighbors,
[57:45.000 --> 57:46.000]  as it gets closer over the next few months,
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  watch this thing getting bigger.
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  And finally, it's as big as the moon,
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  and the news goes, this is our friends.
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  Everything's great, prepared to meet Valhalla,
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  and the earth blows up.
[57:56.000 --> 58:00.000]  I mean, we're just watching this train wreck in slow motion
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  and it's all lies and all evil.
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  And they say it's a two-week martial law
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  and then it's a two-month and it's a two-year
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  and the robots will control you.
[58:08.000 --> 58:11.000]  I mean, we're just waking up in a science fiction nightmare.
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  Yeah, and they keep going back to experts.
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  And, you know, Robert Barnes is going to be joining us.
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  He's a lawyer, you know, and every trial,
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  you've got expert testimony on both sides.
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  These guys have, on each side,
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  they've got impeccable credentials,
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  and yet they're typically telling the jury
[58:25.000 --> 58:26.000]  two different stories.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  And so you have to be able to make up your mind
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  and they don't want you to be able to make up your mind.
[58:30.000 --> 58:33.000]  They want to shut down anybody that opposes
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  their carefully crafted narrative
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  that says the same thing every single time.
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  And that's why Alex is so important
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  for Trump to get rid of Fauci and Birx
[58:41.000 --> 58:43.000]  because they're the ones
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  that are the seminal disinformation agent.
[58:45.000 --> 58:48.000]  And this would be so easy in cross-examination
[58:48.000 --> 58:50.000]  to tear both of them into...
[58:50.000 --> 58:52.000]  You know what? Because they both work for Gates.
[58:52.000 --> 58:54.000]  They've both gotten hundreds of millions from him.
[58:54.000 --> 58:56.000]  They've both been proven to be total liars.
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.000]  And they've seized control of our civilization.
[58:59.000 --> 59:01.000]  Yeah, you just looked at that little episode last week
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  about Rem Desivir, right?
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  This drug, which is a...
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  Yeah, it's been around for a very long time.
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  They tried to use it with AIDS and Ebola.
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  And it might help 10%.
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  Yeah, well, I mean, the bottom line is
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  they had a China study that was
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  accidentally put up by the WHO
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  and then immediately pulled down and said,
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  don't put that up because it showed...
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  Yeah, they showed that it was actually slightly worse.
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  It was not statistically significant,
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  but then neither was the study that was being worked on
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  by Fauci at the NIH,
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  which he put out, and then he said,
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  this is now the standard of care.
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  There's a slight increase
[59:35.000 --> 59:37.000]  in survivability with these...
[59:37.000 --> 59:39.000]  Yeah, less than 10%.
[59:39.000 --> 59:41.000]  We're going to go to break with Michael Sabich
[59:41.000 --> 59:43.000]  talking about this, who is a doctor.
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.000]  And then we are going to come back with Robert Barnes.
[59:45.000 --> 59:47.000]  At the start of the next segment,
[59:47.000 --> 59:49.000]  we're going to play just a compilation
[59:49.000 --> 59:51.000]  of doctors and others in the medical field
[59:51.000 --> 59:53.000]  saying we're being paid to do this.
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  We're being ordered to lie. It's very powerful.
[59:55.000 --> 59:57.000]  Whatever you tell friends and family, tune in now.
[59:57.000 --> 59:59.000]  We're going to destroy this fraud while there's still time.
[59:59.000 --> 1:00:01.000]  Stay with us. Here's Michael Sabich.
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:03.000]  Don't you want out of this nightmare
[1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  that we're all in?
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:07.000]  Well, you're not going to get out of it too soon.
[1:00:07.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  Would you take a COVID vaccine
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  if they come up with it? I wouldn't.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  I would retreat to the hills
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  and join a militia before I would take a COVID vaccine,
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  and I'll tell you why.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  You know, I asked that yesterday. I went back on Twitter.
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  I figured the trolls would
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  have died by now, but of course
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  I don't read it anymore. Others now read it.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  I just post, let the others read it.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  I posted something simple.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  COVID vaccine.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  I will refuse to take it.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  It will be ineffective and dangerous.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  There are now 20 to 30 known mutations.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  I have never taken a flu shot.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  And I will refuse to take a COVID vaccine.
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  I said, if the government makes it mandatory,
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  what would you do?
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  Well, I received a very enormous,
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  a huge, huge, huge reply and response.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  One of the highest
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  response rates of all of my tweets
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  for years now.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  And I can ask you the same thing.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  And I was going to talk
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  about the difference between a vaccine
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  and a drug. I mean, you're hearing a lot
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  about Remdesivir, right?
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Listen to me, folks.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  The drug failed
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  its trials about a week and a half ago.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  Then suddenly
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  it's approved by the FDA.
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  How did that happen?
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  How did Remdesivir,
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  an experimental drug
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  that appears to help some elderly
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  coronavirus patients recover faster?
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  Yeah, well, so it's sunlight.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  So would a vitamin C pill.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  So would vitamin A.
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  Appears to help some coronavirus patients
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  could bank upwards of $2 billion
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  for the treatment according to a new report.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  It's going to cost
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  about $4,500 a dose.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  And Uncle Donal will pay for it.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  Who's going to pay for it?
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  You?
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  Stay with us.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  This is our best selling overall
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  for me.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  And I've told listeners
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  at the end of last year
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  that we can't sell products
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  at 50% off anymore
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  because there's not enough markup
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  in them to fund our operations.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  But because of what's happening
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  and going on in the world right now,
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  I really want everybody
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  who hasn't used or tried
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  or enjoyed the benefits
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  of DNA Force Plus
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  to have DNA Force Plus
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  for yourself and your family.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  DNA Force Plus now
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  50% off.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  We're now in hour number two
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  on this Tuesday, May 5th, 2020
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  transmission. I have David Knight
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  and Robert Barnes both in studio.
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. We're going to destroy
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  the next hour, the giant hoax
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  that has covered 19 and the real fact
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  that it's not
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  COVID that's causing the world collapse
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  and 125 million now starving
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  to death according to the UN.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  It is the panic and the martial law clamped down
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  by the globalist deep state
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  that is causing the death.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  The fear is what we have to fear
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  as Franklin Delano Roosevelt said
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  here is a short compilation
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  of doctors and other medical workers
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  on record exposing the criminal activity.
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  You're saying there is a massive
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  pressure to artificially
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  isolate the number of COVID-19 cases.
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  Yeah, I have directly been told
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  to if a patient has fever
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  and cough or anything similar
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  to put this COVID-like diagnosis
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  on the chart. Right now, Medicare
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  has determined that if you have a COVID-19
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  admission to the hospital
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  you'll get paid $13,000.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  If that COVID-19 patient
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  goes on a ventilator, you get $39,000.
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  Three times as much.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  Nobody can tell me
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  after 35 years in the world of medicine
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  that sometimes those kinds
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  of things impact on what we do.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  What proof would you have
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  that you could show that you have been pressured
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  to inflate the number of COVID-19 cases?
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  So I have an email from
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  my medical director and I'm going to cover her name
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  because I really like her actually
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  and she's kind of between a rock and a hard place
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  just like me but
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  I have my email right here. It's to all the providers
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  in the ER and it states
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  what codes we need to put
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  and it specifically says
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  this can help cover the hospital ER bills.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  So we want to make sure we code them correctly.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  The actual cause of death
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  was not COVID but it's
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  being reported as
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  one of the disease processes and being added
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  to the death list when they died
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  from COPD.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  They had COVID. COVID didn't kill them.
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  25 years of tobacco use killed them.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  There is funding available for patients
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  who are uninsured or
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  underinsured who pursue care for possible
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  or diagnosed COVID-19.
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  This can help cover hospital
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  slash ER bills.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  So we want to make sure we code them correctly.
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  As you may know, a special
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  exemption has been made to allow for a presumptive
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis.
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  Honestly
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  is my core and I think it's important
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  that everybody knows the facts
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  and what hospitals
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  are going through right now. We're going through low
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  volumes and
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  inflating or embellishing
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  a little bit on the charts
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  just so we get funded because this
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  Putting COVID on a lot of
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  death certificates because
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  people that are going to their hospital
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  or any kind of respiratory
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  distress
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  and respiratory problems,
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  pneumonia, the flu
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  the flu like symptoms lead into
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  the COVID-19.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  To be honest with you
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000]  all of the death certificates
[1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  they're right in cold, we don't hold the death certificates
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  for that I had a positive test where they didn't
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:03.000]  so
[1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  I think
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  again, this is my personal opinion
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  I think like the mayor in our city
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  they look for federal funding and the more they put
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:13.000]  COVID on the death certificates
[1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:15.000]  the more they can ask for federal funds
[1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:17.000]  so I think it's political.
[1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  To me, all you're doing
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:21.000]  you're paying is the statistics
[1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:23.000]  you know
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  you're putting people on that have COVID-19
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  if they didn't have it, you're making the death rate
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  for New York City a lot higher than it should be.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  I had one that was
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  autopsy because
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  it was furious
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  and
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  apparently
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  and I was
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  Supreme Court justices but the Supreme Court
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  justice was related to the sampling
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  and
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  if I know my sister died of COVID-19
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  she said
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  we had all hotness and
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  they did suction her
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  for suction because they had to get her to swallow
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  and
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  by the way
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  they stepped COVID-19 on
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  death certificates
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  and Supreme Court justice
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  whoever
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  acted the hospital
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  they did an independent autopsy
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  of COVID-19
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  that's how my mom's dad died
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  they think he had strokes
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  and he forgot how to swallow
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  I go see him at the nursing home
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  he begged me to take him home
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  he said he had medical issues
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  I have nightmares about that still
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  so they are going in
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  and harvesting in all the evil blue states
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  and it's true red states are
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  we become super satanic as well but
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  we're like a hamburger that's half cooked
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  the blue states are done
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  Sodom and Gomorrah blushes at these people
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  and they are
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  telling the nurses how to kill these people
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  and most of the nurses aren't bad they just follow orders
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  I've talked to a lot of them without them on air
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  you heard that lady though that nurse
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  she's a doctor
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  and the nurses doctors are being told
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  you are to do this
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  because we're going bankrupt
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  they shut the hospital down
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  and say you can only take these
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  well then if you're only allowed
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  to say eat salmon
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  and you're out in the ocean
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  and we're going to call every fish to catch a salmon
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  and so everybody that comes in there is COVID-19
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  you're only allowed to eat beef
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  you're starving to death you're going to call that dog beef
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  and
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  again now they're going to say I want to eat dogs folks
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  that's an allegory
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  Robert Barnes constitutional lawyers here
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  you've done a great job
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  breaking all this down you were debating Scott Adams last night
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  sounds like he pretty much agrees with you now that we've been lied to so much
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  maybe he's wrong
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  sounds like he was back peddling
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  cross examining this it should be really easy
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  with Fauci and these people being 100% wrong
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  on purpose what's the big picture
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  then we'll come back with you and David Knife the rest of the hour
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  and dig into the statistics and information
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  I mean the big picture is that
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  for example with hospitals what they did
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  is they created a trifecta
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  in essence of issues
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  for them to inflate the death numbers
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  so first you deprive the hospitals
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  of all of their regular revenue
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  so all the elective procedures cancelled
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  all the other procedures cancelled
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  all of those components gone
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  the net effect of that is they're put into a position
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  where they're losing billions of dollars a day
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  at hospitals all across the country
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  hospitals are extreme under capacity
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  this means they're desperate for cash
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  that if in fact you go into a situation
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  where you list someone
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  as their cause of death as being COVID-19
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  then you will get a greater rate of reimbursement
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  in addition if you use
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  forms of care like ventilators
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  and other kinds of care that have not turned out to be
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  particularly productive or beneficial
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  by the original initial data reports
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  then you get even more money
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  as you saw from the report just broadcast
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  so step one remove their ability to fund it
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  step two
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  give them major incentives in order to
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  to capitalize upon it
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  and then on step three
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  you created the CDC create the situation
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  that normally if you
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  do the data in such a way
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  that you are falsifying
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  or exaggerating information
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  it's called Medicare false billing, Medicaid false billing
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  normally you could be subject to
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  potential criminal penalties and criminal punishment
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  however in this context
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  you're put into a position where
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  if you the CDC says don't worry
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  any listing of COVID-19 deaths is going to be
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  legally okay
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  you're going to be legally immune
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  even if the person didn't test for it
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  even if you're simply assuming they had
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  and you read my mind that's where Gates and all them are going
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  is a global Marshall plan
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  indemnifying all medical systems
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  forever and now they can really start
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  committing the crimes and the good doctors and nurses
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  can be pushed out
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  oh exactly I mean medical deaths kill more people than the flu
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  every single year from medical negligence just alone
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  so the whole key to all of this
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  is to be able to remove
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  the degree of liability and to create all the incentives
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  and in fact make it almost necessary
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  to make it in fact do care
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  if you're a hospital administrator
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  you better be listing lots of COVID-19 deaths
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  in order for your hospital to say financially afloat
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  that's what they've created
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  the system where you're immune from exaggerating
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  the COVID-19 deaths
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  you're incentivized and rewarded for doing it
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  and you're put into a position where it's almost financially necessary
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  to do so
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  and that triplicate effect creates a situation
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  like what we have with vaccines
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  you're creating immunity
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  effective immunity for anything that goes wrong
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  with vaccines
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  so people may remember the 1976 last pandemic
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  induced rushed vaccine
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  in the United States
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  the pandemic didn't kill nearly as many people
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  or harm as nearly as many people as the vaccine
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  did that they rushed into service
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  through the CDC
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  and by the way everything you're saying is historical facts
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  so how do we respond to a criminal
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  conspiracy of this magnitude
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  this whole thing has been cooked up top down directed
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  by Bill Gates
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  he's been immunified on a planetary level
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  by the WHO funded by
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  the Robert Barron multinational foundations
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  directed by Bill Gates on record
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  well you have it
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  you look at what Bill Gates has done for years
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  he's obsessed with overpopulation
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  he believes the solution overpopulation
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  is mass vaccinations
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  and he believes the way to get mass vaccinations
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  implicitly is pandemics
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  that pandemics will induce mass compliance
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  with mass vaccines
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  particularly rushed vaccines
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  and especially rushed vaccines
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  related to influenza and coronavirus
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  where they've had notorious lack of success
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  compared to other vaccines and other medical areas
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  so he needs the public
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  to embrace vaccines
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  and he's been talking about pandemics as a means to do it
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  and while he helped take over the World Health Organization
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  one of the criticisms
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  even in publications like Politico
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  was that he was helping defund effective pandemic response
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  while doing so
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  so what you're seeing is a coordinated effort
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  mass vaccinations for the world
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  that's right even Politico said my god Gates took it over
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  and is cutting real pandemic response
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  because he wants mass death folks
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  and no one would ever believe the guy running
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  the mass death is the guy running it
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  who's on all the TV channels as your savior
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  like he's the new president we'll be right back with David nice response
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  and the statistics stay with us
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  serving with Info Wars
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  is a great honor
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  but I still need my morning coffee
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  and luckily

[1:13:45.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  at infowarstore.com
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  welcome back I'm your host Alex Jones
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  we've got constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  with that engineer and talk show host
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  to my right right here
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  and we are about to lay out the statistics
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  the facts we were kind of doing some 35,000 foot view here
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  we'll play it next segment
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  but Bill Gates has said
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  he wants liability protection for the whole medical field
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  the whole thing as long as they go under
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  his system of global bioethics
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  that the UN is pushing
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  well now there's no more Hippocratic oaths
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  you can do whatever you want
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  this is really the globalist choosing
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  the medical system as the way to roll out their tyranny
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  I'm not surprised the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  first launched their tyranny through the medical system
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  oh yeah and what we're talking about here is a technocracy
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  and this is something that's pushed very heavily
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  early part of the 20th century
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  HG Wells and others
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  yeah exactly these people
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  they know better than you
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  they don't want you having a say so about this
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  they're going to tell you what's in your best interest
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  and you've probably seen the movie
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  Raymond Massey
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  they did it in the 1930s
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  where they're coming down
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  they're lecturing everybody what they're going to
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  that's things to come
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  yeah exactly thanks to come
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  and it was based on shape of things to come
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  by the book by HG Wells
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  but that's exactly what this is
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  I mean Bill Gates is not a doctor
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  why are we taking orders from him
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  and the reality is that as Robert Barnes is pointing out
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  they're getting immunity for this
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  he wants to vaccinate billions of people
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  worldwide they've already
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  they're pushing immunization
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  agenda 2030
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  so they want to have by 2030
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  everywhere every age
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  and what they didn't add is every vaccine
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  possible that they can think of
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  but those first three are part of their agenda
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  and the president without any liability
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  exactly
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  and they're openly admitting
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  that it's going to hurt you
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  before they denied that
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  but last December the UN came out
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  and said yeah vaccines are untested
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  they are killing people
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  I guess they did that just to stop denying it
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  and just say we're still going to do it
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  for example in Oregon
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  they've had 104 deaths in Oregon
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  they say from coronavirus
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  the governor there Kate Brown
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  has just extended the lockdown to July the 6
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  now this is in a state of 4 million people
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  104 deaths
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  every death has to be reacted to
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  they have to shut down the entire economy
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  but if you have 104 people die from
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  or have adverse reactions to vaccines
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  get paralyzed or whatever
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  we're not going to stop that
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  we're going to keep going with the vaccination program
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:35.000]  yeah Gates says 700,000 will die
[1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  or get sick but that's okay
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  because again if we save a few thousand people
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  but 10 million die in Africa
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  well there's too many black people right wink wink
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  that's the little thing
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  Robert you were talking about how they incentivize this
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  they basically shut down the ability
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:51.000]  to make money and then say
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  but then we've got a program here if you diagnose them
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  with COVID-19 and then you get immunity
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  I just played a clip yesterday
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  from a nurse in North Carolina
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.000]  we opened North Carolina she said look
[1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  we're at 16 percent
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:05.000]  occupancy
[1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  she said we're exhausted
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000]  typically in flu season we're usually running
[1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:11.000]  about 110 percent I just got another
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  message from my supervisor asking
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.000]  if I want to take this shift off because they don't need me
[1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  get that clip
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:19.000]  during the break or have Travis if he's here get it
[1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  because I saw that on the show
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  and so let's raise this point
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  remember in the last three months everybody would go out
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  they go this hospital's covered everybody's
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  dead and then they'd go there no one would be
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  there so the next day they'd be like 10 guys
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  in hazmat suits
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  and it would turn out they were employees staging events
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  we would say that and we'd get the platform
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  to others would it turns out it was all fake
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:41.000]  photo ops and they were empty
[1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  they were trying to drum up people who thought they had COVID
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  to come because the hospital was going
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  bankrupt you know what the hospital's not even in on it
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  they order them to close except for COVID
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  everybody's going bankrupt nobody's
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:53.000]  have been and they go okay go out and claim
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  and they get the local news to come say we're
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  all dying so anybody with a cough get scared
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  they run a tube down your neck
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:01.000]  kill your ass and they get all the money
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  no doubt and I think the longer term
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  objective is ultimately a triple
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:07.000]  effect of you're going to end up with a quantum
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  tattoo to give you the vaccine treatment
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  a digital certificate
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  to test and trace you and then ultimately
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  probably a digital currency
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  that's controlled by the government it's also going to be
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  chip and the evidence that Bill Gates is connected
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  to this is he has patents on all three
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:23.000]  so it's they admit that
[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  major universities are now rolling out the social credit score
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  this is the cover for the whole thing
[1:18:27.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  well that's what testing and tracing
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  really is it's just another variation
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  of a Chinese social credit score system
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  you're even seeing them use that the Chinese
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  social credit like constant
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  surveillance state methodologies you're seeing
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  MIT and other people talk about it being used
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  now for testing and tracing
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  COVID-19 it's being done
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  exactly and it's going to continue to be
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.000]  done and the apps are going to be part of the process
[1:18:49.000 --> 1:18:51.000]  oh and now those are just for everybody
[1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  when you're talking about the tracing
[1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  aspect of this geospatial intelligence
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:57.000]  the fastest growing part of our intelligence
[1:18:57.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  community began like back in the 1990s
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.000]  and that's where James Clapper
[1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.000]  has basically spent most of his time
[1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  I've been talking about how they created this
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  with DARPA funding the
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:09.000]  the CIA came out with its own venture capital firm
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  in the late 1990s when the internet
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  became practical that's when
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  they started funding these different corporations like Google
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:17.000]  and so forth now we've got articles coming
[1:19:17.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  out where Eric Schmidt is saying well I've got
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  my own venture capital firm and he got his
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  very first funding was from DARPA
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  and now he's back to run the
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  AI and run the automated
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  killer robots and so forth and then you've got
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  exactly and now also at the same time
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  you're seeing the crystal and these other people
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  with this
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  disinfo whatever they called it
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  I forget I reported this morning but
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000]  the bottom line is that they're going in
[1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  and they're doing they're looking
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  at the political beliefs of people and mapping
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  them out and also that's what this has been
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  about always from the very beginning
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  but now they're saying we got to do this
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:53.000]  to oppose Trump and by the way Schmidt knew
[1:19:53.000 --> 1:19:55.000]  the rollout now he's already gotten the control
[1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  grid in place now he's back to DARPA and the Pentagon
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  to bring out the killer robots
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  because now they're going to be on the streets
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:03.000]  folks and this is just an absolute nightmare
[1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  and the evidentiary bridge for all this
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  comes back to if you look at what everybody
[1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:09.000]  was saying including Fauci in January
[1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:11.000]  in February they were saying this is not a big
[1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:13.000]  problem you don't have to worry about it he even
[1:20:13.000 --> 1:20:15.000]  put out a report that was published in the New England Journal
[1:20:15.000 --> 1:20:17.000]  of Medicine that said it's probably going to
[1:20:17.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  be a severe flu maybe double this
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:21.000]  he wanted China to be able to buy up all the emergency gear
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.000]  and have us all lackadaisical so he could
[1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  blame Trump he was and we said at the time
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  he's setting Trump up so Trump
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  doesn't think there's a problem to think later say oh look
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  Trump didn't respond and then
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.000]  keep Trump in the track trap once Trump
[1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  over responded and the key bridge of the
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  transition of everybody's sudden change of public
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  mind is the Bill Gates driven models
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  out of the Imperial College in IMAG
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  and those are the ones that exaggerated
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  the risk and those were the ones that said
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:47.000]  hey the only solution are things that we've
[1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  never done before as an actual solution
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  these the idea that a mass house
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  arrest was a good idea shows up
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  nowhere in the medical literature
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  prior to those models coming out this is
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  martial law and it's all based on keeping the
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  hospitals open for the COVID-19
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:03.000]  and then immediately we
[1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:05.000]  expose that's a fraud but three months
[1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  later it's out of control
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  that isn't the key to this David and we'll
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:11.000]  come back to Barnes
[1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  exposing the providence
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  of the event 201
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  operation lockstep
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:19.000]  the drills they did in the last
[1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  10 years preparing this that they had it
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  pre-programmed for their takeover I mean
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  the very group that stands to gain
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.000]  and set up global government and have
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  propped up the Chinese are defending China
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  Gates is defending China while attacking
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  Trump through his surrogates I mean Trump's
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.000]  not stupid he's got to know what's going on
[1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:37.000]  they're all saying you've got to follow the China model
[1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:39.000]  and as you point out this has been going on for a long time
[1:21:39.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  we were talking about geospatial intelligence
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:43.000]  how they weaponize that
[1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:45.000]  how they use it as like a rope a dope to get
[1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  people to come in now they're saying now we got
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:49.000]  to track everything that you do but there's also
[1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.000]  I would throw in something else here there's
[1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  also the financial situation
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:55.000]  we've got this massive bubble that's been
[1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  building for over 10 years since the 2008
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.000]  crisis and they
[1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  really ramp that up in the fall
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000]  with a repo market people most people don't know
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  what that is it doesn't really matter just that they pour
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  trillions of dollars into it all of these
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:09.000]  central banks when you look at what is happening
[1:22:09.000 --> 1:22:11.000]  this is about to blow up in their face and just like
[1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  we talked about how they wanted to set up
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:15.000]  the robotic situation universal
[1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000]  basic income lock people
[1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:19.000]  in place with you in 20 they've got to make you dependent
[1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:21.000]  they're ending the human economy exactly they've
[1:22:21.000 --> 1:22:23.000]  got to make sure they've got the virus
[1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:25.000]  blew up the financial system not
[1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:27.000]  the bankers I think that's exactly
[1:22:27.000 --> 1:22:29.000]  it's the financial reset it's the takeover
[1:22:29.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  yeah it's the next level this is the leveling
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  of the old human system
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.000]  it's bringing in the new one by the very same
[1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  criminals and then teaching you to be under lockdown
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  to robot control that you're non-essential
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  tell everyone you know tune in now this is
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:43.000]  an epic transmission the power
[1:22:43.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  as a human that you still have is incredible
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:47.000]  but you must use it spread
[1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  the word you are the Paul Revere's
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:51.000]  ten weeks ago I began
[1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:53.000]  to tell listeners that they needed to get high quality
[1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:55.000]  storeable food not because of the
[1:22:55.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  virus but because of the crises
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  and the economic shutdown it
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.000]  would cause because the globe was planning
[1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  to hold America hostage and run a blockade
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  through the blue cities and blue
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  states now that prediction has come
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  true because the globalist
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  are running an operation it's not
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  predictions we have
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  their battle plans so
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  going back more than eight weeks to go
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  all major storeable food companies were sold
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.000]  out except my patreon supply because
[1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  they're the biggest of a preposition
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  but it got to the point they had so many orders
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:27.000]  coming in that they wouldn't be
[1:23:27.000 --> 1:23:29.000]  able to fulfill them in a timely manner they stopped
[1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  taking orders till they got caught back up
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:33.000]  well now they're caught back up they got
[1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  high quality storeable food in stock
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:37.000]  ready to be packaged and shipped to you
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  get your orders in now at
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  infowarstore.com to go right
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  at the head of the queue to get delivered to you
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  as fast as possible and from the employer
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  your storeable food now at infowarstore.com
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:17.000]  and now that we're inside the cage
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  it's going to move very very quickly
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  into its in game
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:23.000]  submission to this
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.000]  is a form of living death
[1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  and committing the next generation
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  and our own generation
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  to a living hell that
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  cannot be imagined
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  until you're actually experiencing this
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  this is your dignity your soul
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:39.000]  your future being poured inside out
[1:24:39.000 --> 1:24:41.000]  this is a scientific
[1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  dictatorship taking full control
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  of humanity
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  for its own selfless disgusting power trip
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  when it comes to
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  regaining energy during the day
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  convenience is key
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  share coffee, candy
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  and other highly sugar filled drinks
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  can give you a short boost
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  but the crash always follows
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:03.000]  that's why we created
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  a mixable energy formula
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:07.000]  to take on the go when you need a little help
[1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  turbo force
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:11.000]  similar to other mix in energy packets
[1:25:11.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  turbo force from info wars life
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:15.000]  utilizes vitamins
[1:25:15.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  amino acids
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  and extracts used for hundreds of years
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:21.000]  across the world
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  to provide focus, clarity
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  and a boost of energy when you need it
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:27.000]  turbo force is certainly
[1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  a force to be reckoned with
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  for portable, affordable
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  and tasty energy
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  and speaking of affordable
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:37.000]  you can even try turbo force for a limited time
[1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000]  at an incredible 40% off
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  don't wait till it's out of stock again
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  and get turbo force right now
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  only at infowarstore.com
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  welcome back
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  I'm Alex Jones your host
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  in the third and fourth hour today
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  I'm going to be hosting and I'm going to take your phone calls
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:21.000]  and I'm going to take calls from
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  medical personnel
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  doctors, nurses, hospital workers
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  you agree with this, you disagree with this
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  you want to get into vaccines, you want to get into premium babies
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:31.000]  you get the ventilators ready for
[1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:33.000]  we've had those guests on before
[1:26:33.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  we're going to be covering all of that
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  for medical workers
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  or families who have direct
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  COVID-19 stories
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  you think they did a great job, you think it's totally real
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  you love Bill Gates
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:47.000]  you hate Bill Gates, we're going to open the phones up
[1:26:47.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  uncensored as long as you're on that topic
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  in the third and fourth hour today
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  now long before COVID-19 came along
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:55.000]  we've been selling
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  ultimate krill oil
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:59.000]  and I can tell you folks this is the highest grade
[1:26:59.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  best krill oil
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:03.000]  that we could find in the market
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:05.000]  people take this, do an overhead shot if we can
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  and they cannot
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  believe what it does
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  for their health, their stamina, their libido
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  their energy
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  the globalists don't want you to know what mother nature
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  can do for you
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:19.000]  but this is the highest grade
[1:27:19.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  that we can find
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  and again most of them are just crap
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:25.000]  they're not even really the krill oil
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  it's just a bunch of krill parts still really good for you
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  this is the highest grade out there
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  this is what I take
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  and when I forget to take this before I go to bed at night
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  I really, really regret it
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  I take these every night when I go to sleep
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  and it's
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  back in stock for being sold out for months
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  I bought double the amount this time
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  because I know you really wanted it
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  but I also cut the price
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  by 50%
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  and this is one of those products where we don't make a lot of profit on it
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:53.000]  when I do that
[1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  because this is very expensive
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  for us to get in fact
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  the cost we have for this is what
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  a normal bottle of krill oil
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  cost on the store shelves
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  which we're paying for this
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  to get it to you it is
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:09.000]  the ultimate krill oil
[1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:11.000]  and what it does for your body is just absolutely
[1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.000]  amazing
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  and it funds this operation which is also really powerful
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.000]  obviously in the face of what's happening
[1:28:17.000 --> 1:28:19.000]  there's almost no other
[1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  media outlets like this left
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  and I don't take pleasure in that
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  I'm like oh we're last man standing
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:27.000]  that makes us then even more of a target
[1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  to be bombed or shot up or you know
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  put in prison and believe me we're in the end game
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  so they are very very serious
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.000]  and I'm not trying to be dramatic here
[1:28:35.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  it's just that the new world order has click shut
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  we're in it but now our credibility
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  your credibility has gone way up
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  and people need leadership in your area
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  so when you purchase products at m4sword.com
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  you are funding
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  an operation that is one of a kind
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  remember two years ago
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  we got totally banned all over
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  people said how are you taking it how are you feeling
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:57.000]  I said this is the opening salvo
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:28:59.000]  they're going to ban everybody ahead of a global takeover
[1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:01.000]  a bio weapons release
[1:29:01.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  they want to roll in the AI system it's already here
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:05.000]  the AI revolution has been prepared they need a big event
[1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:07.000]  because they were saying they'd have a big event
[1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  and they were saying they'd use a virus
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  I was saying they're going to use a virus
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  I didn't think of this in a crystal ball
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:15.000]  I didn't stare into a crystal ball
[1:29:15.000 --> 1:29:17.000]  or into David Knight's glasses case and go
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  oh ooga booga tell me oh I see a virus
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:21.000]  I see a world government
[1:29:21.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  I see a robot takeover
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  they dug up videos of us five years ago laying
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  all this out we're going to be airing tomorrow
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  we'll go how did you do this because I was
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  reading the white paper so again
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:33.000]  get your krill oil get your x2
[1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  get your x3
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  get your lung cleanse
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  get your essential oil
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  hand sanitizers while you still can
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  because I don't know how long and fours will be here frankly
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  get your 5g kills
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  new t-shirts get the new limited edition
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:49.000]  space 4 shirts there's so much there
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  and it lets us move to the future without your funding
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:53.000]  we wouldn't be here we've had to build our own infrastructure
[1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  our own band with millions and millions
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  of dollars extra every year we've had to spend
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:29:59.000]  millions of dollars a year battling
[1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:01.000]  huge leftist
[1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  law firms with dirty tricks
[1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:05.000]  and sabotage and behind the scene
[1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:07.000]  stuff that's out of a movie
[1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:09.000]  I mean it's a movie on top of a movie on top of a movie
[1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  and it's reality
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:13.000]  folks so thanks for keeping us in the game
[1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:15.000]  we're in this together you are the info war
[1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:17.000]  get storeable food orders in
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:19.000]  they may have to pause orders again your orders in
[1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  you get them but if they get too many orders which is about
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:23.000]  to happen they're going to pause orders again
[1:30:23.000 --> 1:30:25.000]  they may have storeable food but whatever you do
[1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  spread the word about the broadcast
[1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  okay who was going last and let's start
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  getting into statistics
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  there's an interesting story Alex
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:35.000]  I did this a couple of weeks ago
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  I compared the cruise ship the famous cruise ship
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:39.000]  that was at the beginning of all this the diamond princess
[1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  and they got people very alarmed about that
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:43.000]  and then compared
[1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:45.000]  what we just found out about the USS
[1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  Theodore Roosevelt
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  and this is about a week ago that I did this because
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  I finally got to resolution on both of those
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:53.000]  and so let's take a look at those
[1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:55.000]  because we've got a closed system there
[1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:57.000]  and I think it's very informative when we look at this
[1:30:57.000 --> 1:30:59.000]  because when you talk about the
[1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  you've got two real laboratories
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:03.000]  you've got a carrier
[1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  and we're not talking about that in terms of the disease
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:07.000]  but you got an aircraft carrier
[1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  the Theodore Roosevelt it's got about just under
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  5,000 people there 4,885
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:13.000]  soldiers there
[1:31:13.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  and then you've got a cruise ship
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:17.000]  it's got a little over 4,000 crew and
[1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:19.000]  passengers and most of the passengers
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  are elderly
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:23.000]  they're not in that greatest shape
[1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  if you've ever been on a cruise you know what I'm talking about
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  and so they're kind of leading sedentary lives
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  they trend to being older
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  and they're eating at buffets all the time
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  before this happens
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  what happened with the diamond princess
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.000]  that cruise ship that was stuck off the coast
[1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:39.000]  of Japan for quite a while
[1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  well they had about 4,000 people
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:43.000]  they had a little over 600 of those people
[1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  that tested positive for COVID-19
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:47.000]  just under 400
[1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  of those people had no symptoms whatsoever
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:51.000]  asymptomatic
[1:31:51.000 --> 1:31:53.000]  exactly and so when you look at the
[1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:55.000]  and then eventually you had 12 people
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  who died on that ship
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  so that death rate is about 0.3%
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  which is a little bit higher
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:03.000]  but still within the range a statistical range
[1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:05.000]  of what you would expect from the flu
[1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  even on that cruise ship
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  even with an elderly sedentary
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  population on the shield laboratory
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:13.000]  exactly and it was so bad
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  think about this it was so bad
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  an infectious disease doctor
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:19.000]  who went on board and he said
[1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  I was scared to death because at this point in time
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  we didn't know how fatal this disease was
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  he said I've been to Africa
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  during the Ebola situation
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  and the quarantine procedures
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  here on this ship were so bad
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:33.000]  that I've never been more afraid in my life
[1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  and so it wasn't really contained
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:37.000]  you had elderly people and so forth
[1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:39.000]  it's a worst case scenario laboratory
[1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:41.000]  exactly
[1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  even without good quarantine
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  you had people who tested positive
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:47.000]  only about half of those about 7%
[1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  were asymptomatic
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  and you had a 0.3% death
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  now on the aircraft carrier
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:55.000]  you have just under 5,000 people
[1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:57.000]  you had 840 people
[1:32:57.000 --> 1:32:59.000]  tested positive
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:01.000]  on the aircraft carrier
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:03.000]  you only had 9 people get sick enough
[1:33:03.000 --> 1:33:05.000]  to be treated in the hospital
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:07.000]  5,009
[1:33:07.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  had to go to the hospital
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:11.000]  but as we pulled the meatpacking plant
[1:33:11.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  and added none of them sick
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:15.000]  and you had one sailor who died
[1:33:15.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  out of that
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:19.000]  so you got 9 people
[1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:21.000]  out of just about 5,000 people
[1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:23.000]  4,885
[1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:25.000]  that got sick enough to be hospitalized
[1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:27.000]  so that's 0.1%
[1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  who got sick
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:31.000]  not who died but who got sick
[1:33:31.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  you had one sailor who died
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:35.000]  so that's 0.02% who died
[1:33:35.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  because it's a healthier population
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  a younger population
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  overall
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  through the United States and we saw this first in Italy
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  as before this was
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  put in as a lockdown
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:49.000]  we were already getting numbers out of Italy
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  that showed that
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  almost everybody
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  had 98% of the people
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:33:57.000]  who had died
[1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:59.000]  had already identified
[1:33:59.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  multiple co-morbidities
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  the majority had 3
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  85
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:07.000]  it was 80.3 years
[1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  the first report the next one it was
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:11.000]  79.5 years
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  and when you look at what's happening here in the United States
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:15.000]  about 45% of the people who have died
[1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  are beyond
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:19.000]  the life expectancy here in the United States
[1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  they're just taking regular old people
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  that died
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:25.000]  it's like having a brown leaf hanging on a tree
[1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  when the winter comes
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:29.000]  and then the wind blows it away
[1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:31.000]  but you say oh no it was a young leaf
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  it just fell off because it's diseased
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  we had Kenny Rogers who died in the midst of all this
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:37.000]  COVID-19
[1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:39.000]  he was 83 years old
[1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  they said he died of natural causes which is typically what happens
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:43.000]  when you've got somebody who is elderly
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  you've got a lot of different health issues
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  they just say well natural causes
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:49.000]  they typically don't ascertain with any detail
[1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  what the cause of death is
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:53.000]  and we understand that when you get past life expectancy
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  that's what happens to all of us
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  it's a tragedy that Kenny Rogers died
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  we all know who Kenny Rogers is
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000]  every one of these deaths are a tragedy
[1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  but they're not expected
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  it's conclusive
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:07.000]  that it is absolutely overall a hoax
[1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:09.000]  it's a bad cold
[1:35:09.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  then why is it genetically engineered
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  why did it come out of Wuhan
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  what was the point of that
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  until you realize the only way to patent something
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  is if it's a chimera
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:21.000]  because if it's a regular cold virus
[1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  people are going to say hey it's going to mutate
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.000]  there's no reason to get a vaccine
[1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  that's the main reason
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  I want to ask you both why is it a chimera
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  why is it man-made
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:33.000]  there's no reason behind that
[1:35:33.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  we have to speculate on that
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  because that's to understand the next phase
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  and then look at the big enchilada
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  what David and Barnes just mentioned
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:43.000]  the UN admits
[1:35:43.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  the same group running all this
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  that 135 million people are dying
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  so the UN is killing those people
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  the America that we've known and loved
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.000]  the America that was the land of the free home of the brave
[1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  is dying right now
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  and everything our enemies are doing
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.000]  is about domesticating us
[1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  making us dependent on them
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:03.000]  the food shortages have begun
[1:36:03.000 --> 1:36:05.000]  the depression is going to be long
[1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  and very very serious
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.000]  in fact it's probably too late now to even turn back
[1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  Trump tried to stop it
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  but the mainstream media working with the triacoms blocked it
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.000]  that's why you and myself and everybody else
[1:36:15.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  has to get prepared now
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  do not wait
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.000]  it's not about the virus, it's about the economic chaos
[1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:23.000]  it's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year
[1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  get your high quality swarble foods
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:27.000]  and then forward shore.com
[1:36:27.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  for a limited time the food supply is
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  running out there are major shortages
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  this is a globalist
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  siege, a globalist lockdown
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:37.000]  globalist terrorism
[1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.000]  but we the people, the patriots have to be prepared
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.000]  we've already been proven right about prepping
[1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  so far, we'll get ready to be really proven right
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  get your swarble foods now

[1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:19.000]  and then roll out the robot takeover
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:21.000]  this is just
[1:37:21.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  the beta test
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:25.000]  China is moving out of beta
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000]  and into operational control
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  in just a few years we will be under
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:31.000]  full globalist control
[1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  forced inoculations, total surveillance
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  we're all being taught that we are obsolete
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  the term they use is
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:39.000]  non-essential
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:41.000]  this is not some dystopian
[1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:43.000]  novel, this is reality
[1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  this is the new world order
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  this is Satanism
[1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:51.000]  globalism is all about
[1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  making the nation state and the population itself
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  obsolete
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  non-essential
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:59.000]  that's why they position it
[1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  with economic tariffs, taxes and controls
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:03.000]  to where family farms
[1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  and industry that's based in the United States
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.000]  has to shut down
[1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  or be part of a large corporate conglomerate
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:11.000]  that's part of making us obsolete
[1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  so that as the
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  human world is phased out
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  they can simply look at us and say
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  because again, you are non-essential
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  that's what the robots
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:23.000]  and all of this is about
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  it's about setting it up where we're no longer
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:27.000]  in charge of our lives
[1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  we can be told to stay on our houses
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  and after all, shut up
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  this world doesn't belong to people anyways
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.000]  it belongs to the new AI gods
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000]  the rich elitists that emerge with machines
[1:38:37.000 --> 1:38:39.000]  yeah, that sounds completely insane doesn't it
[1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  that's actually the public plan
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:43.000]  they're pushing
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  these people are completely psychotic
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:39:13.000]  and make Hitler look like a choir boy
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  gross, you goo
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  but it's high quality
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.000]  it aerosolizes it in a really great way
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  I like to put it on my hands
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  rub a little bit on my face
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.000]  it's got organic alcohol in it so spray it around your eyes
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  but I just love it
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.000]  personally it's something that's a moisturizer as well
[1:39:33.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  so, this is a real innovation
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.000]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out
[1:39:37.000 --> 1:39:39.000]  with a hand sanitizer
[1:39:39.000 --> 1:39:41.000]  that actually has essential oil in it
[1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  so it doesn't dry you out, it smells great
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:45.000]  it's so refreshing
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:47.000]  this is a big winner
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.000]  welcome back to what is the most important topic
[1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.000]  in the world, here on the planet of the humans
[1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:11.000]  we see total censorship
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.000]  of everybody
[1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.000]  now, Michael Morkman with a movie
[1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:17.000]  when I can't stand the guy
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:19.000]  and I actually read the review of it
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  and then read the synopsis, I want to see it
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:23.000]  planet of the humans
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:25.000]  and he said man, the windmills and the solar panels
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:27.000]  all of which have been set up as a scam
[1:40:27.000 --> 1:40:29.000]  when there's all these real sustainable farms
[1:40:29.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  and the people are doing that would actually help humanity
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  and I actually agree with those ideas
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  and they've banded off a bunch of platforms
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000]  because he exposed the scam
[1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.000]  which I've always said, I care about the earth
[1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  I care, I want to innovate things
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  I want to get away from dirty things
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  but what they're doing doesn't, it collapses
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:47.000]  civilization
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  but that's another topic
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  the mass censorship that's come along with this
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:53.000]  had to be in place beforehand
[1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  because when you've got Fauci
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  running the coronavirus program
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:40:59.000]  for the last 10 years before Trump got in
[1:40:59.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  8 years with Obama, that's on record
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  big scandal in 2015
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:05.000]  it's made illegal to create a game of function
[1:41:05.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  this is given to the Wuhan lab
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:09.000]  University of Texas is involved
[1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  Chapel Hills involved
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  I'm from Texas, you're from North Carolina
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  just down the street from us
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:17.000]  all of this is going on and it's like
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  it's ridiculous how red handed
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  it's like coming home and there's 10 dudes in bed
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:23.000]  with your wife and they say nothing's going on
[1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  they're all butt naked and piled on top of her
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:29.000]  this is ridiculous
[1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  how crazy it is
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000]  I was asking you both during the break
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000]  why is it man made
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  but then not that deadly
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  and you had the truthful, perfect
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  out of the park answer, Robert Barnes repeat that
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  please
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.000]  sure, so I mean if you're going to create
[1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.000]  a bio weapon that is in fact
[1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  intended to induce fear more than it is
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:49.000]  intended to actually kill population
[1:41:49.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  then the way you would do so
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  is you would manufacture it
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:55.000]  because you want to make sure it's controlled
[1:41:55.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  and controllable
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  the reason why bio weapons have generally not
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  been used is because they're uncontrollable
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000]  so you may release it and then kill your own
[1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  population, kill yourself in the process
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:07.000]  exactly, you can't
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  the reason why there is bio weapon research
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  is because
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.000]  in large part they're trying to find
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:15.000]  controllable biological weapons
[1:42:15.000 --> 1:42:17.000]  and that's why they stopped using chemical weapons
[1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  in World War I because the Germans
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  would use it and Hitler got hit with this
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  it would blow back most of the time
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  exactly, it creates uncontrolled risk
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  so the risk of what they were, I've always been looking for
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  is how can we have a controlled weapon
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  a predictable weapon, a controllable
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:33.000]  weapon and that's what a real bio weapon is
[1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  so when you see indicia of control
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  and one of the reasons why people suspected
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:39.000]  this had to have some man-made
[1:42:39.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  component, aside from reports
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  of various doctors and other people looking at it
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:45.000]  seeing that indicia of it, others contradicting that
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  and so they weren't in agreement
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.000]  was the things like who it killed
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.000]  how it killed, when it killed
[1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:53.000]  it showed signs of being
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  a manufactured biological weapon
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  because it disproportionately
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:59.000]  targeted certain populations in ways that viruses
[1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:01.000]  don't have
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  that specific demographic profile typically
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  also tended to target immigrant populations
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:07.000]  African populations, you look at who it is
[1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  Bill Gates obsesses over, he obsesses over
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:11.000]  Africans having too many kids
[1:43:11.000 --> 1:43:13.000]  more than any of them
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:15.000]  and notice he's tailoring right now
[1:43:15.000 --> 1:43:17.000]  seven vaccines for different regions
[1:43:17.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  yes, yes, exactly
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  and there's no question his target here is Africa
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  his target's been Africa, he said so
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  openly, bluntly, he said look
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  look at these poor countries that have too many kids
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:29.000]  they've really got to reduce the population
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:31.000]  and he constantly points to Africa as part of it
[1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  but he sold himself as doing all this
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.000]  in public health, he was there to cure malaria
[1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  he was there to prevent smallpox
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  he was there to help little children
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  not in fact a goal and obsession
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:43.000]  of reducing the number of people that live
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:45.000]  in that region and area because
[1:43:45.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  it was crazy as he's on record heading up the biggest
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  depopulation group and giving speeches
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.000]  about getting rid of people but now he's like
[1:43:51.000 --> 1:43:53.000]  I don't want anyone to die, take my shot
[1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:55.000]  I mean it's ridiculous David Knight
[1:43:55.000 --> 1:43:57.000]  look at these bioweapons and this is the bottom
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:43:59.000]  line here, we've got to get upset
[1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  about the fact that our government
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  is funding bioweapon research
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:05.000]  we've got to get upset about the fact that we have
[1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  hundreds of labs all over the place and when this stuff broke out
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  back in 2013-2014
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.000]  you had an outbreak
[1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.000]  in one of the labs
[1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  the national primate lab down in Tulane
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:17.000]  you had a bacteria that had been
[1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:19.000]  brought in, weaponized with gain of function
[1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:21.000]  research, got out of the biosafety level lab
[1:44:21.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  there, you had Allison Young
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:25.000]  at USA Today did a series of articles
[1:44:25.000 --> 1:44:27.000]  exposing accidents
[1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:29.000]  and careless behavior all across
[1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:31.000]  the board with these various CDC labs
[1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  and other ones and they were calling for this to be
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  shut down, that's one of the reasons why they put
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  the temporary moratorium on the NIH
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  which Fauci and Francis Collins of the NIH
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:41.000]  ignored
[1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  by the way I want listeners to know
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:45.000]  we're not just up here finishing each other's sentences
[1:44:45.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  out of the clear blue sky, we're all talking about
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  real stuff like the crews in there just searching
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:51.000]  Bill Gates, they just pulled up the Guardian
[1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.000]  what was it 10 years ago going
[1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:55.000]  I'm really worried about the African boom
[1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  we need to kill them, I mean it's like
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:44:59.000]  oh kill the black people
[1:44:59.000 --> 1:45:01.000]  and again folks you industrialize them
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:03.000]  you build them up, they'll have two kids like everybody else
[1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:05.000]  yes some areas are overpopulated
[1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:07.000]  you sure as hell don't shoot them up with vaccines
[1:45:07.000 --> 1:45:09.000]  that give them all sorts of diseases
[1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:11.000]  which he's been caught doing
[1:45:11.000 --> 1:45:13.000]  I mean you can't do that
[1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  that's right, yeah you look at what they're doing
[1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  there's USA Today, CDC keeps
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.000]  secrets and mishaps with deadly germs
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:21.000]  and look, not all the scientists are bad as you said
[1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  in 2004
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  they were the ones that made it illegal
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:27.000]  in 2005 with these damn
[1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:29.000]  Chimera, Chimera coronavirus
[1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  is shipped to Wuhan and now it's been released
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  when the data was
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  released from the UNC Chapel Hill experiment
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:37.000]  in 2015
[1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.000]  it was supposed to have stopped in 2014
[1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000]  you had
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  scientists and ethicists across the board
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  condemning that
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.000]  Francis Collins said okay we're going to do it
[1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:49.000]  but the left doesn't
[1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  different places that he continued to do it
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  they funded it in China at the same time
[1:45:53.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  so why isn't Fauci taken out of office
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:57.000]  he needs to be out of office
[1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:59.000]  this is a guy who is funding bioweapon research
[1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:01.000]  and what we're going to do
[1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  let's go further
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:05.000]  I legitimately don't want to kill the Muslims
[1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  and the Asians and the black folks and the Latin Americans
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:09.000]  okay I love all humans, love all babies
[1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:11.000]  the left goes down, brain washes them
[1:46:11.000 --> 1:46:13.000]  the UN implodes their economies on record
[1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:15.000]  devalues their currencies, all these success story countries
[1:46:15.000 --> 1:46:17.000]  devalues them
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:19.000]  then turns it into hell, then uses the third world
[1:46:19.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  as weapons to come here to be under leftist control
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:23.000]  okay I say we control that
[1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  we build those folks up, if we can't we build a wall
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:27.000]  we sure as hell don't kill their ass
[1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  and all go further
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:31.000]  the average leftist goes oh there are too many people
[1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  they're not really leftists, they're eugenicists
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  you know that, the average health department workers at Nazi
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  they can be black, they go yeah there's too many black people
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:39.000]  everybody's seen the videos of black abortion
[1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  and stuff going ah you want to kill them nappy head kids
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:43.000]  I mean it's a real hate
[1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  and so my issue is hey America
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:47.000]  you're all for killing the Africans
[1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  now you're going to be locked up
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:51.000]  the robots are coming for you no matter what color you are
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:53.000]  you can't get away with killing the black people
[1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  and the Latin Americans
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.000]  and the Asians and not have them kill your ass
[1:46:57.000 --> 1:46:59.000]  Bill Gates wants you dead
[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:01.000]  if you've got blonde hair and blue eyes
[1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  they say it's a post human world coming
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:05.000]  do you think Satan has you do a deal with him
[1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:07.000]  where you sign on to killing the brown people
[1:47:07.000 --> 1:47:09.000]  and your ass doesn't get killed
[1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:11.000]  and that's what I said last week in the rant
[1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  because society collapses
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:15.000]  people are going to start eating each other
[1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:17.000]  and I made the do you like the
[1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  modest proposal statement about
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:21.000]  eating the Irish children
[1:47:21.000 --> 1:47:23.000]  now they've got articles out of them saying
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:25.000]  eat Irish children it's the ignorance of the public
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  I know I'm ranting go ahead sorry
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  well we're not worried that you're going to eat us Alex
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:31.000]  that's why we're here but look
[1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  when you talk about genocide
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  the public is so dumb they don't even know who Jonathan Swift is
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  oh I know when you talk about genocide
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  they're not going to do this as you pointed out Robert
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  with the things holding back on
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000]  bioweapons is you put out a virus
[1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:45.000]  that everybody can catch it could kill everybody
[1:47:45.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  unless you could make it DNA specific
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  they're trying to do that they haven't done that yet
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  however they do have the ability
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  if they can put out a virus and scare people
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  they can make sure that
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  they can inject you with something
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  that is going to have a slow kill aspect to it
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  this is what we have to be concerned about
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000]  tell them they had female
[1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:05.000]  hormones in the tetanus shot causing an autoimmune response
[1:48:05.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  to the hormone sterilizing the woman
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  the second trimester every time causing an autoabort
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:11.000]  you've got
[1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  other system they put cancer viruses in
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  that are age related that then
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.000]  trigger and start replicating once hormone levels go down
[1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  so kind of a carousel locus run
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  kill you about 55 this is all that it's done
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  and then they've got that's ancient stuff
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  50 years old now they've got more advanced stuff
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  well look at what happened you talked about Africa
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:29.000]  look at what happened in India that was where Bill Gates
[1:48:29.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  was very active with polio vaccine
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  they stopped that HPV vaccine
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  because how many hundreds of thousands got polio
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  oh yeah it was about 450,000
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:39.000]  but because the WHO said it's eradicated it's polio like
[1:48:39.000 --> 1:48:41.000]  yeah
[1:48:41.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  it's like if I shoot you in the head with 357 magnum
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:45.000]  and I go oh it's not 357 magnum
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  those are outlawed
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  I just shot you with a projectile
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  and if they test me with COVID positive
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  then that would be I died from COVID-19
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  and so the head shot
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  I know I'm ranting I want to come back with both of you guys
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  and get into statistics another point you want to make
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:01.000]  and get into the depopulation area
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  but I want to make a really huge statement here right now
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  and I want to really sink in we say a lot of big things
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  and we're frantic because this is so real folks
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:11.000]  COVID-19
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  is set to be the most
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:15.000]  devastating virus in human history
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  it is going to kill more people
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  than any virus has ever killed in human history
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  and it's not because it's deadly
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  it's because the panic and the shutdown it's causing
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  is going to starve 135 million people
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:27.000]  a year
[1:49:27.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  and the very UN that helped launch this
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:31.000]  then wants to get your money to try to feed those people
[1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  they're never going to feed them
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:35.000]  and I'm sure the head of the world food program
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  actually sounds like a good guy like he means what he says
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:39.000]  he's showing you real people starving
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  but saying COVID caused it no the panic caused it
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  so COVID-19
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  is going to kill 100 plus million people
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  an economist are saying if it brings down the world economy
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:49.000]  for a decade it could be up to a billion people
[1:49:49.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  that end up starving to death
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:53.000]  ladies and gentlemen these are real numbers
[1:49:53.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  this is not a joke
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.000]  if you're a radio listener you don't see them throwing up
[1:49:57.000 --> 1:49:59.000]  AP Reuters all this
[1:49:59.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  they're numbers I've studied it
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  Ward Monk has done big actuaries
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:05.000]  he's a big mathematician
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:07.000]  he estimated a 50% carbon tax cut
[1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  we did the math back in 2015
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:11.000]  over a decade would cause over 1 billion people
[1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.000]  to starve to death
[1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  just Bill Gates in the UN getting
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  DDT and other stuff
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  banned in Africa has caused about a half million people to die
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  they banned hydroxychloroquine
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  in Africa to cause mass death
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  these people are slaughtering everywhere
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000]  meanwhile the average African
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  brainwashed that the average white guy on the street
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  wants to kill him it's all BS
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:33.000]  it's the globalists are coming after all of us
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:35.000]  we must unite or die
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  how do you put a people under house arrest
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  how do you put them under siege
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  well you tell them you're protecting them
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  from a virus that you yourself cooked up
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  with the globalist deep state
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  and then had China release
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:51.000]  to then take down the populist president
[1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  and those pesky American people
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  that have become too uppity
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  Bill Maher even admitted it
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  man I hope we have a depression
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  now they've tailored the whole thing
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.000]  with the big corporations
[1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  and the media are going to keep
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  the country closed along with the help
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  of the blue cities and blue states
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  all the time blaming Trump
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:13.000]  and capitalism and Americanism
[1:51:13.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  for the depression it creates
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  if America is that stupid we deserve
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  what happens to us but as for me
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it
[1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  it's all the nanny state and the peer pressure
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.000]  that they're the good people keeping everybody safe
[1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  but that's not what they're doing
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  they are pulling America up by its roots
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:31.000]  and irrevocably damaging
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:33.000]  our savings our health
[1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.000]  our whole world and committing millions
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  of third world people to death and all of a sudden the trap snaps in their inside
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  and the communist Chinese have been our teachers
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  and big tech has been our controllers
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:09.000]  we're all being introduced now
[1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  the digital straight jacket
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:13.000]  that depends on us complying with it
[1:52:13.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  and depends on us all
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  pinpecking each other
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:19.000]  into submission
[1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:21.000]  but for all of you out there
[1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:23.000]  that have decided to go along with this
[1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  mark your calendars down
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  and then in a few months a few years look at the world
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  remember you did this
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  you were the prisoners
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  you were the slaves you were the people
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  that crouched down and licked the hand to fed you
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:37.000]  as for me give me liberty
[1:52:37.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  or give me death
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  you are either with humanity or against it
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  Robert Barnes, David Nider here with me
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:09.000]  it's the Alex Jones show
[1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  I'm going to go through another two segments
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  and I'm going to help the phones up and take your calls
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  and I get really emotional
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  because I intellectually look at all this stuff
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:19.000]  and it's like a public science fiction
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  nightmare horror movie
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  and exactly our analysis is now unfolding
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  what other agendas does this serve
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:27.000]  Robert Barnes
[1:53:27.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  well I think it serves
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  you're seeing a massive reallocation
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  of wealth and power throughout the western world
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  so it's not only a massive reallocation
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  of power in governors and mayors
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  and county officials
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  asserting extraordinary degrees
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  and loving it
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  absolutely these are like edicts from old dukes
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  just saying hey I'm going to do this thing today
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  I'm going to do this
[1:53:49.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  they're lords now
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.000]  and increasingly irrational by everyone's admission
[1:53:53.000 --> 1:53:55.000]  when you're closing down people from swimming
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:57.000]  by themselves at a public beach
[1:53:57.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  in the open sunshine heat and humidity
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  and open air where everybody agrees
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  as the lowest risk of transmission of the virus
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  then it's simply a power grab
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  in the name of power
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  and seeing how much you can get away with it
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  this is a Milgram experiment
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:13.000]  for the entire civilization of the western world
[1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:15.000]  this is a giant Milgram experiment
[1:54:15.000 --> 1:54:17.000]  absolutely an incredible power reallocation
[1:54:17.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  redistribution from ordinary people to the
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:21.000]  elites but at the same time
[1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  we're seeing a massive economic reallocation
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  of wealth and influence
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  most of it off the books and outside the public eye
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:29.000]  through the Federal Reserve
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  which has spent more money in the last six months
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  printed more and six weeks
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  printed more money in the last six weeks
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  than all of the congress stimulus combined
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  over two and a half trillion dollars
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  and they say they will continue to print
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  as long and as much and as often as they want
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  and they're shifting power from little
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  there's a reason why Walmart's open
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  and your local shop isn't
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:51.000]  while the big grocery store is open
[1:54:51.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  and your little grocer isn't
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  while the big stores are open and the little stores are not
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:57.000]  for whatever you're buying
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:54:59.000]  whether it's hardware, whether it's food
[1:54:59.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  and is this not the ultimate class system
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  where big boxes stay open
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  little boxes don't
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:07.000]  like rollerball
[1:55:07.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  Oh yeah, absolutely
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  when we look at this George Gilder
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  in his book Life After Google
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  and of course George Gilder has been very prescient about
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  anticipating the
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  advent of the smartphone and so forth
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  and he's hoping that
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  Google is going to go away, I hope he's right
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.000]  but he calls these people neo-Marxists
[1:55:25.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  and let's understand
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  it's essential for the Marxists to shut down
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  the middle class and that's what you're talking about Robert
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:33.000]  shutting down
[1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  the different part of the middle class
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  the people who are the risk takers
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  the hard workers that making them
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:41.000]  instantly turning them into beggars
[1:55:41.000 --> 1:55:43.000]  I have story after story I covered this morning
[1:55:43.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  about people who have small businesses
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  and they said look we applied for the loans
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  but there's nothing there
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  the answer is from now on we can't do business
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  with big corporations
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  if they're globalist the average middle class
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  person has to stop going around
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  this is a playground, it's now war
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  and if you look at the agendas that are here
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:03.000]  we've seen which also the UN
[1:56:03.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  2030 agenda because it was a green agenda
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  it was based on the anti-human takeover
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  so look at all the stuff that we've had there
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  first the democrats are getting upset
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  with AOC because she was basically tipping
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  their hand at where they were going
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  we've got to stop people from flying on airplanes
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  we've got to keep
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  and all of them have been saying we've got to keep the oil on the ground
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  well they're not keeping it on the ground now they're keeping it
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  in ships loading around everywhere
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  and paying to take it off their hands
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:29.000]  but look at this, we're cutting down the meat
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  we're flipping the airline
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:33.000]  from being able to fly energy in the ground
[1:56:33.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  we've now got biometric surveillance
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  which was also on their list
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  which was already in place, they just flipped the switch
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  exactly and I think that this is a big part about
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  why this special number is six feet
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  I mean we talk about
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  we've seen all the pictures about how
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  oh look, if one person in Walmart sneezes
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  you're all going to get sick right
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  and yet six feet is somehow the magic number
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  let me tell you what, that six feet I think is there
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:57.000]  because they want to be able to do biometric surveillance
[1:56:57.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  they force you to wear a mask
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  so it's biometric surveillance
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  they want to know when you go to the checkout
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  then they can match you with that card
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  that's right, geospatial intelligence
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:09.000]  they also, part of that is
[1:57:09.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  activity-based intelligence
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  human domain analytics so they can master
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  the human domain, remember Jade Helm
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:17.000]  that was the motto, mastering the human domain
[1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  that's right, they've got the AI all fired up
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  and testing right now
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  so you've got all this stuff, surveillance, social credits
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  and then you get into the city and how people live
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:27.000]  smart cities, sidewalk labs that Google has
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  all of this is being rolled in
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  all at once
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  you have done well
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:35.000]  soon
[1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  soon there will all be a dark control
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  the great computer in the sky
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  hold it right back ladies and gentlemen
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  how do we stop it, we'll talk about that
[1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:13.000]  it's time to understand that
[1:58:13.000 --> 1:58:15.000]  everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[1:58:15.000 --> 1:58:17.000]  and everything you warned your friends and family about
[1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  is around to be true
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:21.000]  so it's now that your credibility is way up
[1:58:21.000 --> 1:58:23.000]  the power structures are to silence
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.000]  those of us that they can
[1:58:25.000 --> 1:58:27.000]  but it's up to all of us
[1:58:27.000 --> 1:58:29.000]  to not let them silence any of us
[1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:31.000]  we have the power
[1:58:31.000 --> 1:58:33.000]  but the sun is setting on humanity
[1:58:33.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  and setting on free speech
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:37.000]  we have to make sure
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:39.000]  that we fight hard right now
[1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:41.000]  make sure that long dark night doesn't come
[1:58:41.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  so be the polar bears you are
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  all right folks we're here with
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:14.000]  Robert Barnes constitutional lawyer David Knight
[1:59:14.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  who hosts the weekday morning A&M David Knight show here
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:18.000]  on the info wars people's pro-human network
[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  and I'm your host Alex Jones
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  I intend to start at the bottom of the hour
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  for an hour and a half take your calls
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  on any subject you wish
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:28.000]  first-time callers, long-time callers
[1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:30.000]  on this live Tuesday edition 877-789
[1:59:30.000 --> 1:59:32.000]  Alex 877-789-2539
[1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.000]  877-789-2539
[1:59:34.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  but
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  oh you know what I just misspoke
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:40.000]  as I said earlier
[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  in the first hour none of this is scripted
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  I just one of the producers had the idea
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  I talked about it taking calls
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:48.000]  of medical personnel doctors
[1:59:48.000 --> 1:59:50.000]  first responders with their COVID-19
[1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:52.000]  positive stories
[1:59:52.000 --> 1:59:54.000]  horror stories do you agree do you disagree
[1:59:54.000 --> 1:59:56.000]  I played the clip of the doctors earlier
[1:59:56.000 --> 1:59:58.000]  and nurses saying they're
[1:59:58.000 --> 2:00:00.000]  you know paid to lie
[2:00:00.000 --> 2:00:02.000]  and say that people have COVID-19
[2:00:02.000 --> 2:00:04.000]  when they don't inflate the numbers
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:06.000]  just incredible clip
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:08.000]  so in the first round of calls or so
[2:00:08.000 --> 2:00:10.000]  we will take calls
[2:00:10.000 --> 2:00:12.000]  from medical workers
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:14.000]  and from doctors and nurses and people like that
[2:00:14.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  so and then later into the fourth hour
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  we'll take regular calls
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  from everybody but only medical workers
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  only folks calling at the bottom of the hour
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  877-789-2539
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  with your whistleblower stories
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  or maybe you love what's going on and you disagree with me
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  love to hear from you
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  I was asking you Barnes and Knight
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  during the break what's the silver
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  lining here this is really waking up
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  a lot of people I know that used to make fun of me
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  it's I've got some family that doesn't think it's that serious
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  now they're totally pissed to understand
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  what's going on and I really
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  see they're being a big backlash
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  you were seeing the vaccines and more
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  exactly I mean we're in America where swimming
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  is a crime surfing is a crime paddle boarding
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  is a crime playing t-ball with your daughter
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  is a crime going out on a walk on the street
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  is a crime the
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  to the degree that we have underground
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  hair cutters that they're doing
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  you know doing stings on
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  I mean who imagined I've been getting underground hair cuts
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  exactly it's the new black market activity
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  who's the best salon person you can
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  get for your haircut we couldn't even
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  even imagine that America
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  two months ago so the people
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  that have been saying for a long time that
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  the power grabbers will use any pretext
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  to grab power and the particular a virus
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  may be a means to do so that
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  in ways that terrorism in this fear of it
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  and the foreign enemy in the fear of it
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  and crime in the fear of it could not induce
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  mass forfeiture of civil rights
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  and civil liberties has overnight
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  led people to forfeit their civil
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  liberties in the fearful nature
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  of scary virus sure and let's roll that footage
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  of just for two days ago New York police
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  grabbing a man slamming
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  his head in the concrete jumping on his head
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  because he wasn't doing
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  social distancing this is terrorism
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  this is just insane tazering
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  people I guess exactly
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  he's walking around with a tazer they take down one guy
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  and one guy's just pointing out hey what's going on here
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  and this cop decides
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  that this individual is also not social distancing
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  so he takes him down
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  starts punching him all he was doing was not
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  social distancing in the face punches him in the stomach
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  exactly drags him up
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  and as Americans
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  witness this there's more Americans
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  realizing one a lot of law enforcement
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  unfortunately will just do what the state tells
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  them to do even when it's irrational there's been
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  a lot of honorable law enforcement across the
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  country say that they would have
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  mainly in the midwest and the south
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  and rural areas what the hell's
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  wrong with blue cities man
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  well because they've been told that unless they behave
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  correctly with the political powers that be
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  they will be targets themselves so there's a lot
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  of corruption in the legal and prosecutorial
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  processes in these big cities I mean that cop
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  literally just assaulted that guy
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  I mean with deadly force
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  and jumped on top of him and now they're going to go
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  further and arrest him and what's fascinating is look at
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  this this would normally
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  the left would have this all over the place
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  the number one story in the country exactly it would be a
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  Black Lives Matter story it would be a major
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  civil rights, civil liberty story, ACLU story
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  all of them are almost completely
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  mute and silent about this but I think
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  that's what's waking up more and more people
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  waking up people to the fact that the perception
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  of vaccines is radically changing
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  because as they see you know vaccines were supposed
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  to be what cured smallpox so they had this
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  wonderful voodoo reputation and no one was
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  supposed to second guess whether there's any safety
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  look at that he does a jujitsu move
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  starts punching him in the face full power
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  that cop literally just assaulted that guy
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  we're going what the hell man I'm just walking around
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  exactly they precise the cop
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  comes to him too exactly
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  and all he was doing was seeing that
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:32.000]  someone else was being brutalized
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  for social distancing and these are social
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  distancing arrest to their credit the New York
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  Police Department today came out and said
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  we need to get out of the social
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  distancing arrest business but that's what you're
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  seeing you're seeing more you're seeing ordinary police
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  officers resist the unconstitutional
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  orders of their bosses and superiors
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  you're seeing ordinary people re-examine why
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  is there immunity for vaccines shouldn't we
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  be concerned with safety related to new
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  vaccines I agree and we'll have to do a whole other segment
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  of this talk want to keep hearing from you guys but let's
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  test you queue up the
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  crazy Chicago
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  mayor who's mirroring all these other virtues
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  signalers that you're a criminal
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  if you're outside we're going to take you to jail so
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  she's trying to bring us to the Spanish
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  model where they've been locked up for two months
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  and they're seeing the biggest spikes because
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  people are locked up indoors full of anxiety
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  and their studies show
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  that if you get locked up indoors and you think
[2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:22.000]  you're going to get sick you will get sick
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  because your body will have an autoimmune response
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:26.000]  it's called psychosomatic
[2:04:26.000 --> 2:04:28.000]  and that's what's happening and then don't
[2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.000]  worry then they take you down there stick
[2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:32.000]  a tube down your lungs and then pump
[2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  them full air till they pop and you die
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:36.000]  the medical doctors have said that's the truth so let's
[2:04:36.000 --> 2:04:38.000]  hear from her here she is
[2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:40.000]  now I direct to Superintendent Brown
[2:04:40.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  to order all police
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  districts to give special attention
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:46.000]  to these parties
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  and this is how it's going to be
[2:04:48.000 --> 2:04:50.000]  we will shut you down
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:52.000]  I'm going to start this over because this is Admiral
[2:04:52.000 --> 2:04:54.000]  Ackbar folks it's a trap
[2:04:54.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  let's go ahead and hear from Admiral Ackbar
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:04:58.000]  sorry start it over
[2:04:58.000 --> 2:05:00.000]  I direct to Superintendent Brown
[2:05:00.000 --> 2:05:02.000]  to order all police districts
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:04.000]  to give special attention to these parties
[2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:06.000]  and this is how it's going to be
[2:05:06.000 --> 2:05:08.000]  we will shut you down
[2:05:08.000 --> 2:05:10.000]  we will cite you
[2:05:10.000 --> 2:05:12.000]  and if we need to we will arrest you
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:14.000]  and we will take you to jail
[2:05:14.000 --> 2:05:16.000]  period
[2:05:16.000 --> 2:05:18.000]  there should be nothing unambiguous
[2:05:18.000 --> 2:05:20.000]  about that
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:22.000]  don't make us treat you like a criminal
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:24.000]  but if you act like a criminal
[2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:26.000]  and you violate the law
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  and you refuse to do what is
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:30.000]  necessary to save lives in the city
[2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:32.000]  in the middle of a pandemic
[2:05:32.000 --> 2:05:34.000]  we will take you to jail
[2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  period you talk about
[2:05:36.000 --> 2:05:38.000]  I mean you talk about it absolutely
[2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:40.000]  out of control
[2:05:40.000 --> 2:05:42.000]  nanny state when did you
[2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:44.000]  get Admiral Ackbar become our controller
[2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.000]  the dangerous thing about this
[2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:48.000]  is that
[2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:50.000]  we're at the second wave here
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:52.000]  and the second wave just as you heard her say
[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  don't make us do this you're threatening our lives
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  and this is the next step
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:05:58.000]  we're terrorists
[2:05:58.000 --> 2:06:00.000]  how dare you you stay in your damn house
[2:06:00.000 --> 2:06:02.000]  you don't open your business house
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  we're warranted to do anything that we do
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  you know Alex I talked to you
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  yesterday was the 50th anniversary of Kent State
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  what happened at Kent State
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  some people who were not really experienced
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:14.000]  at National Guard they panic
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  or whatever firing in the crowd and they kill four students
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  now what's going to happen
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  now is here we are 50 years later
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  and instead of a bunch
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  of spoiled college students you've got
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  business owners who are out there
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  writing against that stuff or demonstrating against this stuff
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  and what they have in common
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  is that these students
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  realize that they were lied to
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  nixon said he was going to stop the war
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  instead he escalated it with a secret war
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  we realize we've been lied to
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  we realize that our lives are at stake
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  these people are going to be sent off to Vietnam
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  to die for a political agenda based on a lie
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  but now you've got people middle
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  class middle age business owners
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  who are out there and instead of a bunch of amateur
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  National Guard troops
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  you've got the militarized police who've been told
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  that they can shoot first
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  if they're fearful
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  they'll have their backs covered
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  and this is going to start a revolution
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  we're going to have to have people at
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  the same level
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  we're not acting tough up here
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  I'm just telling the veterans everybody are just ready
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  they're tired of it
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  they've tried to fix things peacefully
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  we've really put up a lot of crap
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  we've been censored everything else
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  and people are just really getting serious
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  I think the solution Alex
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  is we've got to have constitutional shares
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  we've got to have constitutional mayors
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  councilmen and so forth
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  it's got to be done at the local level
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  you've got sanctuary cities
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  and then see
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  better numbers like Brazil
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  and Sweden that didn't do all this
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  and have the lowest numbers
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  and where we say we're still red blooded
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  we call it America zones
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  hey this is still America
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  you go to your blue cesspit with the homeless
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  and the needles and the perverts and the pedophiles
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  and you go there and you fail
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  but they're trying to suck us all down
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  and do an American bankruptcy
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  to bail their blue cesspits out
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  that's right when we talk about Posse Comitatis
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  you've got the Posse community
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  you've got the Posse gets behind the sheriff
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  when there's a necessity to do that
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  and we've got a lot of constitutional sheriffs
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:12.000]  who say look, I'm not going to arrest somebody
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  is it Posse the people in Latin?
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  Posse is power, Comitatis is the community
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  so it's the power of the community
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  that's where we can stop this
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  that's the only place we can stop this
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  is state governments who can't count on that
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  if the left wants to rally their mob
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  to destroy America, we'll rally the American people
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  and they know it
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  but we want to be careful and not be violent about it
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  because you talked about that, they want to trigger something like
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  Michigan and I understand why they did it
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  but they're trying to say they're all Nazis
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  for saying that she's a Nazi that meant to the governor
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  that woman looks totally psychotic
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  oh, scarier, her or Admiral Ackbar
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  Cobra is now in command of you and your family
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  we've got drones and other systems to ensure the safety of the public
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  so we can now release the weapon
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  but without the loving liberal media
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  scaring you of the submission
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  and the corporate press
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  worshiping corporations
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  we've got down all access
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  as well as blue city governors and mayors
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  we would never have been able to give you the depression
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:39.000]  that will destroy your future forever
[2:09:39.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  and starve the third world

[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:17.000]  building since the Magna Carta
[2:11:17.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  we have a free open society and now
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  it's all falling in a matter of months
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:29.000]  but there's always a counter-offensive
[2:11:29.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  and as long as we're here exposing what's happening
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:35.000]  there's going to be major backlash
[2:11:35.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  and David, you were warning that
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  they're trying to cause a revolution
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  but how does a revolution need to look
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  we don't want it to be violent because they really want to use it to trigger something bigger
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:49.000]  but as Churchill said there may be a time when there's no choice
[2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  back in 2017, October 2017
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:55.000]  they had the big representatives
[2:11:55.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  from the social media companies
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:01.000]  Facebook, Twitter, Google, and so forth
[2:12:01.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  after they left, however, they had a guy
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  who's worked for a long time with the military industrial complex
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  both in the military and private contractors
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  he got up and he said, this is a civil war
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  it's already started, it's starting with words
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:19.000]  and we have to silence the cannons on social media
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  and what we're looking at, Alex, is really an information war
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:25.000]  people are begging because you've got a controlled press
[2:12:25.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  because you've got CNN, Fox, MSNBC
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  pushing this panic
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  that's coming out of the mouth of Fauci and Birx and so forth
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:37.000]  well, print that, look, former FBI agent says
[2:12:37.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  tech companies must silence sources of rebellion, print that
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  that's the article we're talking about
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  and yesterday, I've talked about this many, many times
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:49.000]  socialist workers or whatever, they picked up on that
[2:12:49.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  and Caitlyn Johnstone picked up on it again yesterday
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:55.000]  I said, yeah, remember how many times I've talked about this?
[2:12:55.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  and the wake up, because it was eight months later
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:01.000]  nine months later that they shut down the cannon on social media
[2:13:01.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  Alex Jones, they did that nine months later
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:07.000]  and now the very same people on arrest me, we can't get into it yet
[2:13:07.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  but they're now planning my arrest
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:13.000]  just like they did at Concord and Lexington, they came for the cannons
[2:13:13.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  not just the guns, they came for the cannons at Goliad, Santa Ana
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:19.000]  and so forth, and they came for the cannons of social media
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  and of free speech, your ability to be able to
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:25.000]  pass along with comment what you think, right or wrong
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  as well as the independent free press, and so they understand
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:31.000]  this is an information war, they understand they were losing it
[2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  so basically they pulled the plug on free speech
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:37.000]  and this is why the public is buying into this narrative
[2:13:37.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  that's the only thing that they're hearing, they're absolutely panicked about this
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:43.000]  and that's why we've all got to hit the streets, I have an article here
[2:13:43.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  guys pull it up because I was unable to find it, I saw it this morning
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:49.000]  where the Democrats have been given a AI system
[2:13:49.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  the Pentagon developed to fight, quote, disinfo
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:55.000]  for the election, and it's actually attacking the president
[2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  and us, and they admit that, and it's actually
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  run by Snopes and George Soros, so taxpayer
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  weaponized AI is run by a former
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:07.000]  US general against the American people, there it is
[2:14:07.000 --> 2:14:10.000]  right, Democrats using Pentagon funded AI system
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  to target pro-Trump narratives online, holy hell
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  that's illegal, and it's funded by DARPA
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:19.000]  but here's the other part of this that I don't see anybody talking about
[2:14:19.000 --> 2:14:22.000]  Microsoft is at the center of
[2:14:22.000 --> 2:14:25.000]  this speech control and also election control
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:28.000]  this is one way that they're controlling it by saying well we're going to control what people are
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:31.000]  saying out there and we're going to start mapping out the
[2:14:31.000 --> 2:14:34.000]  different political beliefs of people and shut that down
[2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:37.000]  far beyond that, election guard is
[2:14:37.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  something that was also funded by DARPA through
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:43.000]  Microsoft, they're going to have DARPA counting
[2:14:43.000 --> 2:14:46.000]  the votes after Microsoft has put out
[2:14:46.000 --> 2:14:49.000]  News Guard to tell you don't listen to this
[2:14:49.000 --> 2:14:52.000]  so there's fast company, that's mainstream news folks, so
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:56.000]  I think Trump's being blindsided by this, it came out a week ago that he was screaming at his campaign chairman
[2:14:56.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  campaign manager saying what the hell's your problem
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  I don't think Trump gets this, and I don't know with
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:05.000]  these days, how he can, this is out of control
[2:15:05.000 --> 2:15:08.000]  it's not even the whole government, it's left this deep
[2:15:08.000 --> 2:15:11.000]  status like Brennan and Clapper are still in control of all this
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:14.000]  and now they can't silence info or is there a piss that the listeners are spreading the word
[2:15:14.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  so now they want us arrested
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:20.000]  think about this, I've been talking about this for a couple of years, election guard
[2:15:20.000 --> 2:15:23.000]  news guard stuff and I said look, they've already demonstrated
[2:15:23.000 --> 2:15:26.000]  how easy it is to hack into these electronic voting machines
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:29.000]  I mean the first electronic voting machines are Smartmatic down in
[2:15:29.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  Venezuela, Hugo Chavez's friends created it so they could keep him in
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:35.000]  office, they exported that to a lot of Central
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  and South American countries to the Philippines, they rigged elections there
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:41.000]  they brought some of that stuff into the US, we have seen
[2:15:41.000 --> 2:15:44.000]  for decades, we've seen electronic machines, you have a
[2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:47.000]  you know, a community college professor come in with a couple of computer science
[2:15:47.000 --> 2:15:50.000]  students and say look, we can stick this thumb drive in there
[2:15:50.000 --> 2:15:53.000]  we can flip all the votes and we can erase it, so now we get to the point
[2:15:53.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  where all this is happening and you've got
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:15:59.000]  the black hat conferences and DEF CON that are happening
[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:02.000]  in Vegas and they say look, we're going to show you how vulnerable
[2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:05.000]  the election system is and
[2:16:05.000 --> 2:16:08.000]  we can have some kids, all of them under the age of 15
[2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:11.000]  we've got 30 of them going to come in and we've got a replica of the state election
[2:16:11.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  boards and they come in and they hack it
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  and every one of them except two were able to hack it
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:20.000]  yeah folks, you've got to hit the streets outside cyberspace
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  and just be activists everywhere, in closing
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  what are your thoughts on the points you'd like to make?
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:29.000]  Well I remember when I was a kid I met the greatest election predictor I'd ever met
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  from a little town in Grundy County, Tennessee
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:35.000]  who explained how he could predict within a tenth of a percentage point
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:38.000]  what the results were going to be in various elections and I was like how do you do that
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:41.000]  and he said well Bobby, it's not who votes that matters, it's who counts the votes
[2:16:41.000 --> 2:16:44.000]  who matters and that's the oldest logic in the world
[2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:47.000]  and is it a coincidence that Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates
[2:16:47.000 --> 2:16:50.000]  is involved in these other aspects
[2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:53.000]  of health AI technology and election ballot counting in the future
[2:16:53.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  you're talking about a billionaire who while people were paying attention to the Koch brothers
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:16:59.000]  paying attention to George Soros
[2:16:59.000 --> 2:17:02.000]  slipped in under the limelight
[2:17:02.000 --> 2:17:05.000]  seized control of public health authorities all around the world
[2:17:05.000 --> 2:17:08.000]  corrupted the institutional influences of universities, academy
[2:17:08.000 --> 2:17:11.000]  and public health alike to the degree that even publications like Politico
[2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:14.000]  were talking about it two years ago
[2:17:14.000 --> 2:17:17.000]  the scope and scale and severity of what was taking place
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:20.000]  to see what a presidency or a world empire government
[2:17:20.000 --> 2:17:23.000]  by someone like Bill Gates would look like and it is not a pretty look
[2:17:23.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  and so I think it's what we face today
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:29.000]  is unprecedented and unparalleled in American history
[2:17:29.000 --> 2:17:32.000]  since at least 1776
[2:17:32.000 --> 2:17:35.000]  and by the way Barnes, are we kidding about how the deep stage is making a move on in force
[2:17:35.000 --> 2:17:37.000]  we can't get into it yet
[2:17:37.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  there's no doubt about it whatsoever what you saw was an inside takeout
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:43.000]  of General Flynn by the inside and we're seeing now
[2:17:43.000 --> 2:17:46.000]  all the scales of corruption they went to in that that's being uncovered and discovered
[2:17:46.000 --> 2:17:49.000]  but they took out General Flynn to make President Trump vulnerable
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  so that he had none of the white hats around him that he needed
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  at times exactly like this
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:58.000]  Russia gate doesn't happen if they are unable to take out General Flynn
[2:17:58.000 --> 2:18:01.000]  Ukraine gate and impeachment gate doesn't happen except for their success
[2:18:01.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  because he was going to kick all the operatives out
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  and he was going to bring all the white hats in
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:10.000]  I represented some of those other white hats that got targeted by Mueller
[2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:13.000]  so now what's the deep state up to
[2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:16.000]  about the dissident voices an institutional narrative doesn't work
[2:18:16.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  unless it's gated and you need gatekeepers to keep out
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  the wrong voices so they need to take certain key voices
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  primarily infowars kick them out of the narrative
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:28.000]  Arrest Roger Stone exactly and in the process
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:31.000]  in the time frame continue to target them for political harassment
[2:18:31.000 --> 2:18:34.000]  legal harassment every other form of harassment publicize
[2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  false news stories hide true news stories
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:40.000]  to have this continuous campaign because infowars keeps managing to jump over that gate
[2:18:40.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  and get back in and undermine the institutional narrative
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:46.000]  so the big powers of institution the gatekeepers have to come
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  and escalate the attacks on infowars and those who personify it
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:18:52.000]  we're not complaining we chose this battle we want listeners to know
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:55.000]  we're really soldiers for our future your future
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:58.000]  and we're not backing down we're committed to this but soon we'll be able to talk about it
[2:18:58.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  but it's pretty heavy stuff
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:03.000]  oh no doubt it's extraordinary it's the most expansive extensive targeting
[2:19:03.000 --> 2:19:06.000]  of any organization within the free press
[2:19:06.000 --> 2:19:09.000]  in American history period from a political perspective
[2:19:09.000 --> 2:19:12.000]  from a press perspective from a legal perspective
[2:19:12.000 --> 2:19:14.000]  there is simply no parallel or precedent to it
[2:19:14.000 --> 2:19:16.000]  well Martin Luther King got harassed this much
[2:19:16.000 --> 2:19:19.000]  oh yes within I'm talking about the press
[2:19:19.000 --> 2:19:22.000]  so we've seen other exactly there have been political leaders
[2:19:22.000 --> 2:19:24.000]  Medgar Evers, Martin Luther King, civil rights leaders
[2:19:24.000 --> 2:19:27.000]  the great revolutionaries got this kind of stuff
[2:19:27.000 --> 2:19:29.000]  oh absolutely a whole bunch of journalists independent writers
[2:19:29.000 --> 2:19:31.000]  independent thinkers independent political leaders
[2:19:31.000 --> 2:19:33.000]  you're saying for a press organization you're right this is the biggest
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:37.000]  completely there's no press organization that's been harassed and targeted more than infowars
[2:19:37.000 --> 2:19:39.000]  and the reason is not because they're afraid of falsehood
[2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:41.000]  it's because they're afraid of truth
[2:19:41.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  gentlemen both of you amazing job
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:46.000]  hiding in plain view politico the associated press
[2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:49.000]  you name it admit that a half a billion people
[2:19:49.000 --> 2:19:54.000]  extra 500 million are now at the subsistence starvation level
[2:19:54.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  on top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:01.000]  that is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world
[2:20:01.000 --> 2:20:04.000]  caused by COVID-19 and the very people that cooked it up
[2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:07.000]  and gave it to the chai comms at the world health organization
[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:11.000]  with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation
[2:20:11.000 --> 2:20:13.000]  to shut down society, create a depression
[2:20:13.000 --> 2:20:15.000]  and forcibly inoculate everybody this is insane
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:18.000]  ladies and gentlemen if they succeed it's over
[2:20:18.000 --> 2:20:21.000]  you need to get prepared now you need to get high quality storeable food
[2:20:21.000 --> 2:20:24.000]  now back in stock at infowarstore.com
[2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  big tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:34.000]  and to send you can't even challenge verbally social distancing
[2:20:34.000 --> 2:20:38.000]  this is beyond 1984 the tyranny of the dual orders here
[2:20:38.000 --> 2:20:41.000]  get prepared now and spread the word in the info war
[2:20:41.000 --> 2:20:44.000]  you are the paul reveres
[2:20:44.000 --> 2:20:50.000]  now that this UN global government chai comm billable indicates medical tyranny
[2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  has seen how far they can push it now
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:56.000]  we just lapped it up like poison
[2:20:56.000 --> 2:21:01.000]  you know now they are going to launch more bio attacks and even more hardcore
[2:21:01.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  this early one does kill people but see it's a virus billable indicates own
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:12.000]  it's a virus that's novel from others so they can give you a vaccine
[2:21:12.000 --> 2:21:15.000]  see a regular cold or flu virus you really can't do a vaccine for
[2:21:15.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  because it's always mutated but see because this is a chimera and lab made
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:23.000]  they can have a speciality
[2:21:23.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  so it's a whole giant franchise they can fill the rich off of it
[2:21:26.000 --> 2:21:28.000]  they can surveil everybody
[2:21:28.000 --> 2:21:30.000]  everybody gets to become a suspect
[2:21:30.000 --> 2:21:32.000]  and now when you would have low numbers of death it doesn't matter
[2:21:32.000 --> 2:21:35.000]  because they make a huge spectacle out of it
[2:21:35.000 --> 2:21:37.000]  you watch next year with the flu
[2:21:37.000 --> 2:21:39.000]  it'll even be bigger as well
[2:21:39.000 --> 2:21:42.000]  this is what they've done to us because we're a bunch of domesticated idiots
[2:21:44.000 --> 2:21:47.000]  well communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:50.000]  that would cut their energy used by half
[2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:53.000]  and the United States wouldn't sign on to it
[2:21:53.000 --> 2:21:56.000]  so guess what happened along came COVID-19
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:22:01.000]  and Bill Gates is celebrating saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half
[2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  and that means you're going to be poor now and under his control
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:08.000]  and of course with the medical tyranny comes the force inoculations
[2:22:08.000 --> 2:22:12.000]  a eek microchip that comes with the vaccine and so much more
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:17.000]  and Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it
[2:22:17.000 --> 2:22:20.000]  so remember folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family
[2:22:20.000 --> 2:22:22.000]  and destroy your basic rights
[2:22:22.000 --> 2:22:25.000]  the same left that says kill babies all day long
[2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:26.000]  women own their bodies
[2:22:26.000 --> 2:22:28.000]  now say you don't own your body
[2:22:28.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:33.000]  and if you don't submit you can't buy or sell or leave your home
[2:22:33.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  mark the beast
[2:22:34.000 --> 2:22:35.000]  oh and guess what
[2:22:35.000 --> 2:22:37.000]  Jeffrey Epstein and all these people
[2:22:37.000 --> 2:22:38.000]  hang out together with Bill Gates
[2:22:38.000 --> 2:22:41.000]  and are a bunch of dirty devil worshipers in your face
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:43.000]  they hate you and your family
[2:22:43.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:22:59.000]  all right I'm going to go to your phone calls
[2:22:59.000 --> 2:23:02.000]  John and Phil and Jason and Tori and Rosa
[2:23:02.000 --> 2:23:05.000]  nurses, doctors, family of nurses and doctors
[2:23:05.000 --> 2:23:07.000]  with a lot of amazing stories
[2:23:07.000 --> 2:23:08.000]  I can see they're on the board
[2:23:08.000 --> 2:23:11.000]  the number of other doctors, other nurses, other medical workers
[2:23:11.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  other family members that want to give
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:15.000]  your take on COVID-19
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:16.000]  we're going to go to you in just a few minutes
[2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:18.000]  877-789-2539
[2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:22.000]  877-789-2539
[2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:25.000]  David Knight wanted to finish a point
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:26.000]  post the David Knight show
[2:23:26.000 --> 2:23:27.000]  weekday mornings
[2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  8 a.m. to 11 a.m. right before I come on
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:32.000]  here on the Info Wars pre-speech pro-human network
[2:23:32.000 --> 2:23:34.000]  and of course Robert Barnes is doing a special show
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:35.000]  for a while longer
[2:23:35.000 --> 2:23:37.000]  that is called American Countdown
[2:23:37.000 --> 2:23:39.000]  from 7 to 9 p.m. each evening
[2:23:39.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  on the TV and radio satellites
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:23:43.000]  and at infowars.com and Bandai video
[2:23:43.000 --> 2:23:45.000]  but David we're getting into the A.I. and Microsoft takeover
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:46.000]  the voting machines
[2:23:46.000 --> 2:23:49.000]  and now you can't even be there to see what happened
[2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.000]  so it makes it even easier when nobody's at the voting booth
[2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:53.000]  to take control
[2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:56.000]  that's right I was laying out how this originated
[2:23:56.000 --> 2:23:59.000]  down in Venezuela with Hugo Chavez
[2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:02.000]  and the fact that we're very concerned about the integrity of the elections
[2:24:02.000 --> 2:24:04.000]  how easy it is to hack this
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  but it's the connection to Bill Gates
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:08.000]  it's the connection of Microsoft to DARPA
[2:24:08.000 --> 2:24:11.000]  if we go back and we look at the Ed Snowden slides
[2:24:11.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  it showed that in the prism program
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:16.000]  the very first corporation to jump in there in 2007 was Microsoft
[2:24:16.000 --> 2:24:18.000]  but here we are Alex
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:21.000]  and as they've been laying the foundation for election guard
[2:24:21.000 --> 2:24:23.000]  where DARPA is going to count the votes
[2:24:23.000 --> 2:24:25.000]  and we've had these probes
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:27.000]  that it turned out it was coming from the Obama
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:29.000]  Department of Homeland Security probes
[2:24:29.000 --> 2:24:31.000]  and the state boards of elections
[2:24:31.000 --> 2:24:34.000]  we saw that it was very easy to hack those models and so forth
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:36.000]  now here we are low and behold
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:38.000]  because of the coronavirus
[2:24:38.000 --> 2:24:40.000]  we have to have electronic voting
[2:24:40.000 --> 2:24:43.000]  they're saying I don't think you're going to be allowed to do in-face voting
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:45.000]  you're going to have to do it through your smart phone
[2:24:45.000 --> 2:24:47.000]  you're going to have to do it online or something like that
[2:24:47.000 --> 2:24:50.000]  and it is the perfect summary
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:52.000]  of everything that's been laid out
[2:24:52.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  how it all comes together with DARPA
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:24:56.000]  you can still fly on the airplanes, you can still go to the store
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:58.000]  and again this six degrees of separation
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  comes from just the theory of six degrees of separation
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  of social distancing
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:05.000]  and it's a psychological system of control
[2:25:05.000 --> 2:25:07.000]  and it just so happens to be
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:10.000]  a foot is six inches and six inches
[2:25:10.000 --> 2:25:12.000]  and of course this is six, six, six, six
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:14.000]  to get into the six degrees of separation
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:17.000]  it's more a bunch of occultic globalist garbage
[2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:19.000]  Heathrow Boss says social distancing
[2:25:19.000 --> 2:25:21.000]  will never work at airports
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  it'll end buses, it'll end everything
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:24.000]  but that's the idea
[2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.000]  Fauci says stop shaking hands
[2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:27.000]  this is just a revolution
[2:25:27.000 --> 2:25:29.000]  an ending human society
[2:25:29.000 --> 2:25:31.000]  forcing us all into their globalist society
[2:25:31.000 --> 2:25:32.000]  yeah you're absolutely right
[2:25:32.000 --> 2:25:34.000]  it's going to be a total nightmare
[2:25:34.000 --> 2:25:36.000]  if planes can survive
[2:25:36.000 --> 2:25:38.000]  they're saying you've got to get there four hours early
[2:25:38.000 --> 2:25:40.000]  and you've got to go to the gate
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:41.000]  but you've got to get there
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:42.000]  you can't hang around the gate
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:43.000]  where are you going to hang around?
[2:25:43.000 --> 2:25:45.000]  if you've got to stay six feet apart from everybody
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:47.000]  well that's what Heathrow said
[2:25:47.000 --> 2:25:50.000]  they said it would make the line several miles long
[2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:52.000]  yeah exactly
[2:25:52.000 --> 2:25:54.000]  and it's going to make it impossible for people
[2:25:54.000 --> 2:25:55.000]  to actually get on a plane
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  because it has to be in close quarters
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:25:59.000]  and we've always had germs around
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:01.000]  well people are being caught they're bad
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:03.000]  they're being caught they're dirty
[2:26:03.000 --> 2:26:05.000]  right and they're embracing that
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:07.000]  and they don't want to be around humans
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:08.000]  and that's what we've got to fight
[2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:10.000]  and that's why we have to fight it
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:12.000]  by organizing together at the community level
[2:26:12.000 --> 2:26:14.000]  we have to make sure that they don't impose
[2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  they're now using the term social bubble
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.000]  you know we've got to end these social bubbles
[2:26:18.000 --> 2:26:20.000]  well the bubble boy and let's go further
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:22.000]  Malthus 250 years ago
[2:26:22.000 --> 2:26:24.000]  who had the first big theories on this said
[2:26:24.000 --> 2:26:26.000]  heard the poor into small cities
[2:26:26.000 --> 2:26:28.000]  so they all die of the pestilence
[2:26:28.000 --> 2:26:29.000]  so that the earth will be clean
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:32.000]  and the elite can enjoy the beauties of nature
[2:26:32.000 --> 2:26:33.000]  it goes back to Plato saying
[2:26:33.000 --> 2:26:35.000]  the poor are crushing the breast of mother earth
[2:26:35.000 --> 2:26:36.000]  let's kill them
[2:26:36.000 --> 2:26:37.000]  David Knight thank you so much
[2:26:37.000 --> 2:26:38.000]  thank you so much
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:40.000]  all right folks I'm going to play a short clip
[2:26:40.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  of doctors and medical workers saying it's all a hoax
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:44.000]  that they're running a scam
[2:26:44.000 --> 2:26:46.000]  and they're going right to your calls
[2:26:46.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  for the balance of the transmission
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:48.000]  so please stay there
[2:26:48.000 --> 2:26:50.000]  we're going to be going to John
[2:26:50.000 --> 2:26:52.000]  and Tori and others here in just a moment
[2:26:52.000 --> 2:26:54.000]  but here's the report
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:56.000]  you're saying there is a massive pressure
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:59.000]  to artificially inflate the number of COVID-19 cases
[2:26:59.000 --> 2:27:02.000]  yeah I have directly been told to
[2:27:02.000 --> 2:27:05.000]  if a patient has fever and cough or anything similar
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:08.000]  to put this COVID-like diagnosis on the chart
[2:27:08.000 --> 2:27:10.000]  right now Medicare has determined
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  that if you have a COVID-19 admission to the hospital
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:15.000]  you'll get paid $13,000
[2:27:15.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  if that COVID-19 patient goes on a ventilator
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  you get $39,000
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:22.000]  three times as much
[2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:26.000]  nobody can tell me after 35 years in the world of medicine
[2:27:26.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  that sometimes those kinds of things impact on what we do
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:31.000]  what proof would you have
[2:27:31.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  that you could show that you have been pressured
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  to inflate the number of COVID-19 cases
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  so I have an email from my medical director
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  and I'm going to cover her name
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:41.000]  because I really like her actually
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:44.000]  and she's kind of between a rock and a hard place
[2:27:44.000 --> 2:27:46.000]  just like me but I have my email right here
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:48.000]  it's to all the providers in the ER
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:51.000]  and it states what codes we need to put
[2:27:51.000 --> 2:27:53.000]  and it specifically says
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  this can help cover the hospital ER bills
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:27:58.000]  so we want to make sure we code them correctly
[2:27:58.000 --> 2:28:01.000]  the actual cause of death was not COVID
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:04.000]  but it's being reported as one of the disease processes
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:06.000]  and being added to the death list
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  when they died from COPD
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:11.000]  they had COVID, COVID didn't kill them
[2:28:11.000 --> 2:28:13.000]  25 years of tobacco use killed them
[2:28:13.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  there is funding available for patients
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:18.000]  who are uninsured or underinsured
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:21.000]  who pursue care for possible or diagnosed COVID-19
[2:28:21.000 --> 2:28:23.000]  this can help cover hospital
[2:28:23.000 --> 2:28:25.000]  slash ER bills
[2:28:25.000 --> 2:28:27.000]  so we want to make sure we code them correctly
[2:28:27.000 --> 2:28:29.000]  as you may know a special exemption
[2:28:29.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  has been made to allow for a presumptive
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:34.000]  or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:36.000]  honesty is my core
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:39.000]  and I think it's important that everybody knows the facts
[2:28:39.000 --> 2:28:42.000]  and what hospitals are going through right now
[2:28:42.000 --> 2:28:44.000]  we're going through low volumes
[2:28:44.000 --> 2:28:46.000]  and you know inflating
[2:28:46.000 --> 2:28:49.000]  or embellishing a little bit on the charts
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:51.000]  just so we get funded because this
[2:28:51.000 --> 2:28:54.000]  putting COVID on a lot of death tickets
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:56.000]  because people that are going to their hospital
[2:28:56.000 --> 2:29:00.000]  or any kind of respiratory distress
[2:29:00.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  and respiratory problems
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:05.000]  pneumonia, the flu
[2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:09.000]  the flu like symptoms lead into the COVID-19
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:11.000]  to be honest with you
[2:29:11.000 --> 2:29:14.000]  all of the deaths that we get there right in COVID
[2:29:14.000 --> 2:29:16.000]  all of the deaths that we get
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:19.000]  are positive tests whether they didn't
[2:29:19.000 --> 2:29:22.000]  so I think again this is my personal opinion
[2:29:22.000 --> 2:29:24.000]  I think like the main one in our city
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:26.000]  they're looking for federal funding
[2:29:26.000 --> 2:29:28.000]  and the more they put COVID on a death certificate
[2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:30.000]  the more they can ask for federal funds
[2:29:30.000 --> 2:29:33.000]  so I think it's political
[2:29:33.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  to me all you're doing is you're paying the statistics
[2:29:37.000 --> 2:29:41.000]  you know you're putting people on that have COVID-19
[2:29:41.000 --> 2:29:42.000]  if they didn't have it
[2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:44.000]  you're making the death rate for New York City
[2:29:44.000 --> 2:29:46.000]  a lot higher than it should be
[2:29:46.000 --> 2:29:48.000]  I had one that was autopsy
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:52.000]  because it was furious
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:55.000]  and he apparently
[2:29:55.000 --> 2:29:58.000]  and I was told that Supreme Court justices
[2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:00.000]  but the Supreme Court justices
[2:30:00.000 --> 2:30:02.000]  was related to the sampling
[2:30:02.000 --> 2:30:05.000]  and if you find out my sister didn't die
[2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:06.000]  of COVID-19
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:09.000]  he said he had Alzheimer's
[2:30:09.000 --> 2:30:12.000]  and they didn't suction her
[2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:15.000]  they had to suction her because they had to get her to swallow
[2:30:15.000 --> 2:30:19.000]  and right away they stepped COVID-19 on her
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:21.000]  death certificate
[2:30:21.000 --> 2:30:23.000]  and there's Supreme Court justices
[2:30:23.000 --> 2:30:27.000]  whoever didn't act in the hospital
[2:30:27.000 --> 2:30:29.000]  they didn't depend on all the time
[2:30:29.000 --> 2:30:31.000]  to make things out of COVID-19
[2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:34.000]  this is a well thought out takeover plan
[2:30:34.000 --> 2:30:36.000]  with the average person on the ground
[2:30:36.000 --> 2:30:38.000]  whether they're in Spain, England, Australia
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:39.000]  the United States or Canada
[2:30:39.000 --> 2:30:40.000]  there's a nurse or a doctor
[2:30:40.000 --> 2:30:41.000]  and suddenly there's no business there
[2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:43.000]  and they go well just code all these people
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:45.000]  as COVID-19
[2:30:45.000 --> 2:30:46.000]  alright, I'm going to go to break
[2:30:46.000 --> 2:30:47.000]  because I don't want to keep people short
[2:30:47.000 --> 2:30:49.000]  that I promise we're going to take
[2:30:49.000 --> 2:30:50.000]  four or five of these calls next segment
[2:30:50.000 --> 2:30:52.000]  we're going to get to everybody
[2:30:52.000 --> 2:30:55.000]  Tori's a medical worker, delivers supplies
[2:30:55.000 --> 2:30:58.000]  John's a medical worker, healthcare companies
[2:30:58.000 --> 2:31:01.000]  John's pharmacy worker on vaccines COVID-19
[2:31:01.000 --> 2:31:04.000]  Phil, wife is a doctor, hospital lack of COVID-19 patients
[2:31:04.000 --> 2:31:07.000]  Jason, mother-in-law is a doctor at hospital
[2:31:07.000 --> 2:31:09.000]  says no surge
[2:31:09.000 --> 2:31:11.000]  grandmother died, tested negative
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:13.000]  still COVID
[2:31:13.000 --> 2:31:14.000]  I mean these are incredible
[2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:15.000]  these are on screen calls
[2:31:15.000 --> 2:31:16.000]  I mean we ask what you're calling about
[2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:18.000]  but we're just not telling you what to say
[2:31:18.000 --> 2:31:20.000]  Rosa, mom is a nurse
[2:31:20.000 --> 2:31:21.000]  was laid off due to lack of patients
[2:31:21.000 --> 2:31:24.000]  we're going to talk to all of you when we come back
[2:31:24.000 --> 2:31:25.000]  and I'm just going to get this plug in now
[2:31:25.000 --> 2:31:28.000]  so I don't have to do it in the next segment
[2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:31.000]  I cannot stress to you how surreal it is here
[2:31:31.000 --> 2:31:33.000]  the tyranny we're under at Info Wars
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:36.000]  that I'm not able to get into yet
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:38.000]  added to everything else going on
[2:31:38.000 --> 2:31:40.000]  this country is hanging by a thread
[2:31:40.000 --> 2:31:41.000]  and so is the whole planet
[2:31:41.000 --> 2:31:43.000]  this is a decades long plan takeover
[2:31:43.000 --> 2:31:44.000]  everybody knows that
[2:31:44.000 --> 2:31:46.000]  the people running it are absolute criminals
[2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:47.000]  Trump is totally surrounded
[2:31:47.000 --> 2:31:49.000]  he's trying to battle out of it
[2:31:49.000 --> 2:31:50.000]  but the public is so cowardly
[2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:52.000]  when he tried to get us not to be afraid
[2:31:52.000 --> 2:31:54.000]  we just love getting afraid
[2:31:54.000 --> 2:31:55.000]  well you better be afraid
[2:31:55.000 --> 2:31:57.000]  of the end of human civilization
[2:31:57.000 --> 2:31:58.000]  because nobody's going back to the stores
[2:31:58.000 --> 2:32:01.000]  this depression is going to be the worst thing you've ever saw
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:03.000]  and now they're announcing youth cores
[2:32:03.000 --> 2:32:05.000]  they're going to come around spot tracing you at your house
[2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:07.000]  they're announcing gun confiscation
[2:32:07.000 --> 2:32:08.000]  in Canada
[2:32:08.000 --> 2:32:10.000]  they're making their move on every agenda
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:12.000]  Texas I love my state very shameful
[2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:14.000]  a bar opened in west Texas
[2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:16.000]  saying we're going bankrupt
[2:32:16.000 --> 2:32:18.000]  they sit in an armored tank and arrest them
[2:32:18.000 --> 2:32:20.000]  okay so I mean there's a lot of people
[2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:21.000]  are just crazy
[2:32:21.000 --> 2:32:23.000]  and they want to grandstand with their power
[2:32:23.000 --> 2:32:25.000]  well I guarantee you those cops
[2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:26.000]  when this is all over their families
[2:32:26.000 --> 2:32:27.000]  are going to be bankrupted
[2:32:27.000 --> 2:32:28.000]  they're going to be on the street
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:29.000]  and they're going to think back
[2:32:29.000 --> 2:32:31.000]  and wish they hadn't acted like this
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:33.000]  but that's just how it is
[2:32:33.000 --> 2:32:36.000]  we're a nation of compliant cowards
[2:32:36.000 --> 2:32:38.000]  our founding fathers would not recognize us today
[2:32:38.000 --> 2:33:07.000]  well they're right back today with us
[2:33:08.000 --> 2:33:11.000]  three hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group
[2:33:11.000 --> 2:33:13.000]  and all you guys talking about living defense
[2:33:13.000 --> 2:33:14.000]  let me tell you something man
[2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:16.000]  I had an internal digestive problem
[2:33:16.000 --> 2:33:19.000]  and I stumbled with it for about five or six years
[2:33:19.000 --> 2:33:21.000]  and the doctors they tried every time
[2:33:21.000 --> 2:33:22.000]  nobody could figure out what it is
[2:33:22.000 --> 2:33:24.000]  and then every day when I kept hearing you
[2:33:24.000 --> 2:33:26.000]  and Dr. Group and those commercials
[2:33:26.000 --> 2:33:27.000]  I said you know what I'm going to get me
[2:33:27.000 --> 2:33:28.000]  some of that freaking living defense
[2:33:28.000 --> 2:33:30.000]  now I wasn't supposed to have any nutritional
[2:33:30.000 --> 2:33:32.000]  because they don't want you to have that stuff
[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:33.000]  but I ordered it, it shipped to me
[2:33:33.000 --> 2:33:35.000]  I got it, I hid it from the nurses
[2:33:35.000 --> 2:33:36.000]  I started taking it man
[2:33:36.000 --> 2:33:38.000]  that stuff changed my life
[2:33:38.000 --> 2:33:39.000]  it saved my life
[2:33:39.000 --> 2:33:42.000]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life
[2:33:42.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  and I'm here to tell you
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:45.000]  I don't need you to thank me
[2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:46.000]  and tell me I've done a good job
[2:33:46.000 --> 2:33:48.000]  I've done nothing but my duty
[2:33:48.000 --> 2:33:51.000]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum
[2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.000]  coming after innocent people
[2:33:53.000 --> 2:33:56.000]  and I've been fighting them for 13 years
[2:33:56.000 --> 2:33:59.000]  and I'll never stop while I'm drawing breath
[2:33:59.000 --> 2:34:01.000]  for 26 years
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:03.000]  Alex Jones and InfoWars
[2:34:03.000 --> 2:34:05.000]  have been sounding the alarm
[2:34:05.000 --> 2:34:07.000]  for patriots worldwide
[2:34:07.000 --> 2:34:11.000]  waking people up to the new world order
[2:34:11.000 --> 2:34:13.000]  Bohemian Grove
[2:34:13.000 --> 2:34:15.000]  the American deep state
[2:34:15.000 --> 2:34:18.000]  the rise of communist China
[2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:21.000]  the plan for global depopulation
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:24.000]  and global elite pedophiles
[2:34:24.000 --> 2:34:26.000]  who pray off of our young
[2:34:26.000 --> 2:34:29.000]  the enemy has done their best to destroy us
[2:34:29.000 --> 2:34:31.000]  but because of your support
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:33.000]  our fight continues
[2:34:33.000 --> 2:34:35.000]  join us, support the InfoWars
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:38.000]  and together we will slay the dragon
[2:34:38.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  keep fighting Alex, you're the gladiator
[2:34:43.000 --> 2:34:44.000]  Ladies and gentlemen
[2:34:44.000 --> 2:34:46.000]  InfoWars can now offer high quality
[2:34:46.000 --> 2:34:48.000]  storable food again
[2:34:48.000 --> 2:34:50.000]  other manufacturers were sold out
[2:34:50.000 --> 2:34:52.000]  eight weeks ago
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:54.000]  and they told people they had food
[2:34:54.000 --> 2:34:56.000]  most folks who never were delivered their food
[2:34:56.000 --> 2:34:59.000]  well when our sponsors
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:01.000]  food began to run short
[2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  they just spent it's sales
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:04.000]  they opened more factories
[2:35:04.000 --> 2:35:06.000]  and secured more food
[2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  so if you eat your orders in
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:08.000]  or right now
[2:35:08.000 --> 2:35:09.000]  they can take new orders
[2:35:09.000 --> 2:35:11.000]  and get it to you quickly
[2:35:11.000 --> 2:35:13.000]  they'll probably have to suspend orders
[2:35:13.000 --> 2:35:14.000]  very very soon again
[2:35:14.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  because the lockdown of the economy
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:18.000]  is killing food distribution
[2:35:18.000 --> 2:35:20.000]  farming you name it
[2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:21.000]  and now it's mainstream news
[2:35:21.000 --> 2:35:23.000]  the food shortages and delivery
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:25.000]  are already starting to happen
[2:35:25.000 --> 2:35:27.000]  if Trump can turn the economy back on
[2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.000]  and rest control of our system
[2:35:29.000 --> 2:35:31.000]  away from the globalist
[2:35:31.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  things may be okay
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:33.000]  but it looks like
[2:35:33.000 --> 2:35:34.000]  it's going to get very very rough
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:35.000]  so again ladies and gentlemen
[2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:37.000]  now is the time to secure the number one thing you need
[2:35:37.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  high quality storable food
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.000]  ready to get to you and your family now

[2:36:41.000 --> 2:36:44.000]  That's infowarstore.com
[2:36:44.000 --> 2:36:49.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:05.000]  Live from the info war store
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:09.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies,
[2:37:09.000 --> 2:37:11.000]  foreign and domestic
[2:37:11.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  It's Alex Jones live from Austin, Texas
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:20.000]  Broadcasting worldwide from the infowars.com studios
[2:37:23.000 --> 2:37:25.000]  Always faithful to a free human future
[2:37:25.000 --> 2:37:27.000]  Always faithful to the unborn
[2:37:27.000 --> 2:37:31.000]  Always faithful to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:34.000]  I'm Alex Jones your host and this is the info war
[2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:39.000]  Well we know that
[2:37:39.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  We are witnessing the takeover of civilization and a collapse that will kill 135 million people the UN says in the next year
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:51.000]  But it doesn't matter if that's 130 something times what will die of COVID-19
[2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:55.000]  Even if you believe the inflated numbers because it's the right thing to do
[2:37:55.000 --> 2:37:58.000]  So COVID-19 is the most deadly virus in human history
[2:37:58.000 --> 2:38:02.000]  Not because it kills people but because it shuts off economies that starve them to death
[2:38:02.000 --> 2:38:08.000]  Well let's go to John in Tennessee thanks for holding medical worker health care companies and financials
[2:38:08.000 --> 2:38:11.000]  That's what you want to talk about thanks for calling thanks for holding
[2:38:11.000 --> 2:38:12.000]  Hey can you hear me?
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:13.000]  Yes sir
[2:38:13.000 --> 2:38:21.000]  Hey it's my second call I called in back about the impeachment back when that was going on
[2:38:21.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  Just glad you're still on the air and I wanted to bring something up I just I noticed you're still there
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:30.000]  I sure am brother
[2:38:30.000 --> 2:38:37.000]  Oh hey I just wanted to bring something up I'm glad you're on the air because you bring up things that people usually don't really hear about
[2:38:37.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  At least that's what I get out of your show a lot of times and there's something going on at the company where I work at
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:53.000]  It seems innocent on the surface but we might want to watch out like what this could actually turn into later
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:39:01.000]  And it's being used the COVID-19 is being used to bring attention to this
[2:39:01.000 --> 2:39:06.000]  Trying to bring all the health records together and make them public on Google cloud
[2:39:06.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  If you go to onboarding.nationalresponseportal.com
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:15.000]  The company I work with teamed up with Google cloud and data
[2:39:15.000 --> 2:39:22.000]  Oh sir absolutely they're unifying under Google everybody's health records that came out last year ahead of this happening
[2:39:22.000 --> 2:39:26.000]  So they confuse it all on the smartphones and track everybody in live time
[2:39:26.000 --> 2:39:31.000]  They're going to use the medical crisis here to force the global ID to buy and sell
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:37.000]  In China they use Alibaba that most people already had to buy and sell to already have their data
[2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:44.000]  So you're absolutely right and Google is running this and we warned of this last year that Google's getting all of your health records in live time
[2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:53.000]  I mean it seems pretty innocent I did the research on it the schema doesn't include anything that's really identifiable yet
[2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:56.000]  So I don't know how that's going to change
[2:39:56.000 --> 2:40:01.000]  Well that's what they tell you sir just like they tell you when your location thing is turned off it's off it's never off
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  Google is a total criminal organization
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:12.000]  Well they did include a schema if you read that write up on the response page
[2:40:12.000 --> 2:40:18.000]  That you have to provide the data in a certain format and it's absent of anything that's identifiable
[2:40:18.000 --> 2:40:24.000]  They're just saying it's metadata you can't identify somebody by their temperature really
[2:40:24.000 --> 2:40:31.000]  But they they're identifying it according to people that have been patients and their location so they can then contact trace that
[2:40:31.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  Right that's true
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:39.000]  Look I sat there in Congress when Sundar Pachai says we've never tracked one person ever
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  And we don't track I mean they just lie they're the biggest liars the planet's ever seen brother
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:48.000]  Change right that's what you have to agree to that's going to change
[2:40:48.000 --> 2:40:51.000]  Absolutely I appreciate your call John God bless
[2:40:51.000 --> 2:40:54.000]  Tori in Arizona
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:40:56.000]  Tori you're on the air welcome
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:58.000]  Hey Alex for taking my call
[2:40:58.000 --> 2:40:59.000]  Thank you
[2:40:59.000 --> 2:41:07.000]  I got your mask yesterday I've been wearing a paper one for the last two weeks it was awful so I'm glad I got the paperware's mask
[2:41:07.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  Very comfortable works really good
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:13.000]  Oh you can spread the word while they're forcing you to do it
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:20.000]  Oh yeah absolutely I'm getting look no one's done anything yet but if someone wants to pop off to me I got a few lines from
[2:41:20.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  Medical worker and deliver supplies tell us about that
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  Yeah I deliver anything from medicine to stress to gowns, blood, masks, you name it
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:39.000]  Every night I deliver meds to the ICU at four West Valley hospitals and I've been doing this for seven years
[2:41:39.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  I've never delivered this little of meds to the ICU
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:53.000]  I'm delivering these things called TPMs they're for unconscious people and pretty much every day since they're unconscious they need to get their nutrients
[2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  I deliver these and I'm delivering next to nothing
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  Last week two hospitals had zero which I would assume meant that the ICUs were empty
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:10.000]  Well you remember all the videos over the months of them empty the local news would say they're full death body bags and you'd go there no one would be there and they'd try to arrest people that came
[2:42:10.000 --> 2:42:20.000]  But now it's confirmed British hospitals are four times more empty US hospitals are three times more empty than ever before that's the official numbers now
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  And I'm not saying that some medical workers aren't heroes or it isn't a tough job for EMTs and stuff or that's being a surgeon or nurses and heart
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:33.000]  The point is is that this whole COVID thing saying everyone's a hero because they're overwhelmed and there's all this death
[2:42:33.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  I have family that works in one of the biggest VA hospitals they say it's dead
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:46.000]  They're again they're watching TV and drinking vodka and the nurses are having sex with each other and that's it and of course now that's all confirmed
[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:49.000]  Where do you think this is going?
[2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  I think that they want total control I think people are dumbed down from SSRIs, marijuana, alcohol
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:05.000]  I've been on SSRIs since I was ten years old I had one of those moms that wanted to try every type of drug on me because I didn't do anything
[2:43:05.000 --> 2:43:09.000]  Because that's what a good mommy does to her son it's a feminist thing yeah
[2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:13.000]  Now feminists cut their son's testicles off but yeah
[2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:16.000]  You're lucky you weren't born under the modern feminists
[2:43:16.000 --> 2:43:22.000]  I'll leave it at this I know someone very close to me in Houston who's a nurse
[2:43:22.000 --> 2:43:29.000]  And all the time lesbian couples come in and demand their three four five year old sons have their balls chopped off and the hospitals refuse
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:34.000]  But they're there they go why they want those testicles as a symbol of a ritual of power
[2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:44.000]  Yeah today the pills mess you up they numb you out don't feel any anger any sadness pretty much just go with the flow
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:52.000]  I could take them those pills about six weeks ago and I'm always starting to feel alive and you can feel all the emotion instead of just happiness
[2:43:52.000 --> 2:43:55.000]  Just feel high all the time and they're on those pills
[2:43:55.000 --> 2:43:58.000]  Well God bless you brother I appreciate your call
[2:43:58.000 --> 2:44:04.000]  Let's talk to Rosa in Indiana mom's a nurse to tell us what's happening
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:06.000]  Hey Alex hey how you guys doing
[2:44:06.000 --> 2:44:09.000]  I'm pretty freaked out it's all coming true
[2:44:09.000 --> 2:44:16.000]  Oh yeah you're the only one my mom finally just got red tilde or whatever you want to call it
[2:44:16.000 --> 2:44:22.000]  She was working at the ER for about 20 years and she was laid off about three weeks ago
[2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:26.000]  And they specifically moved her into a coding department
[2:44:26.000 --> 2:44:34.000]  So they laid her off from the ER and now all she does is send them and I'd like to back up a doctor's office and do coding
[2:44:34.000 --> 2:44:38.000]  And for coding she does the billing for people that don't know
[2:44:38.000 --> 2:44:47.000]  Yeah she's in charge now of taking direction from the ER and then how to code these patients who have died
[2:44:47.000 --> 2:44:52.000]  And is she saying that they're doing it fairly or are they listing anybody
[2:44:52.000 --> 2:45:00.000]  No they're intentionally as long as they test positive no matter what they passed away from
[2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  It is to be listed as COVID-19
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:07.000]  Well they've confirmed that even if you've died of a shark attack
[2:45:07.000 --> 2:45:12.000]  They've said this in the press conferences at the national level if you've died of a shark attack
[2:45:12.000 --> 2:45:15.000]  If a shark bit your leg off the hospital will test you for that
[2:45:15.000 --> 2:45:20.000]  Because if you die they get the extra $39,000 and the extra $13,000
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:25.000]  Oh yeah and then we had another reality check because since she's aware of what's going on now
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:32.000]  My uncle went into the hospital two weeks ago and he had an infected boil under his arm
[2:45:32.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  And they told him that it was septic
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:38.000]  Well they started giving him antibiotics he started feeling better
[2:45:38.000 --> 2:45:43.000]  He was getting better and then three days in there they said oh well we need to ventilate him
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:47.000]  Because if it gets all the way into his bloodstream he could die
[2:45:47.000 --> 2:45:50.000]  My mom said absolutely not I've seen what you guys are doing
[2:45:50.000 --> 2:45:55.000]  I want my brother taken out of here immediately after they drained the boil
[2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:58.000]  And he has recovered just fine
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  Wow that's a close brush with death because they say 90% of the people that are
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:07.000]  You ended up getting a snake down and dying because they're destroying the lungs
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  If they don't need it according to the medical doctors and they would have gotten $39,000 to kill him
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:18.000]  Yeah and that's why we got him out of there I mean we thought we it was like it was a fight
[2:46:18.000 --> 2:46:21.000]  Well listen you're doing the right thing Rosa you've got to call in to C-SPAN
[2:46:21.000 --> 2:46:24.000]  You've got to call the White House you've got to call local talk radio
[2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:27.000]  You've got to get your mom involved you've got to save people
[2:46:27.000 --> 2:46:31.000]  Your family got out of this but they're going to kill a lot of people including children
[2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:35.000]  Children going in that have respiratory problems they're killing them right now
[2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:38.000]  Because they're desperate for numbers of dead kids
[2:46:38.000 --> 2:46:43.000]  I've called in to Rush I've called in to Glenn trying to let these things be known
[2:46:43.000 --> 2:46:47.000]  It's absolutely crazy because I actually called in I'm a first time caller
[2:46:47.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  I actually called in for something completely different question
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:54.000]  But then I was told you guys needed information about the hospital
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:46:58.000]  And I'm like oh well my mom was a nurse and she's laid off and now she's specifically
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:01.000]  Wow so you called in about something different and we said no we're just taking calls on this
[2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:05.000]  Wow you're a beautiful person and I want you to keep it up
[2:47:05.000 --> 2:47:09.000]  We need you the human intelligence Rosie you are Paul Revere
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:12.000]  You know how powerful you are everything we are rides on you Rosa
[2:47:12.000 --> 2:47:16.000]  Everything I love you God bless you
[2:47:16.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  I cannot believe this see my dad worked in the medical field
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:24.000]  The doctor and he managed a whole bunch of stuff and he did it cleanly and good
[2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:31.000]  He told me man that it's these evil company owners that try to get doctors and nurses to do evil stuff
[2:47:31.000 --> 2:47:35.000]  Look the globalists are Satanists all right
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:43.000]  Lawrence Rothschild recently posed at a gallery of art worshipping the devil and praising Lucifer
[2:47:43.000 --> 2:47:46.000]  You cannot make this up they flaunt it in our face
[2:47:46.000 --> 2:47:49.000]  That's what environmentalism is it's about having an anti-human future
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:53.000]  And having people live in a subsistence feudal served state
[2:47:53.000 --> 2:47:58.000]  That's what they want these people that have stolen the planet are worth trillions of dollars
[2:47:58.000 --> 2:48:02.000]  Do not want you having a good life they know you're having fun
[2:48:02.000 --> 2:48:06.000]  They know you have a great wife a great husband great children they hate your guts
[2:48:06.000 --> 2:48:15.000]  They are the most horrible evil people on the planet they openly fund racism war degeneracy pedophilia everything else
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:20.000]  Imagine the most horrible thing in the universe and then imagine it doubled tripled quadrupled
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:25.000]  And being gullible and being domesticated just makes them rise up and attack you harder
[2:48:25.000 --> 2:48:31.000]  And they're the ones that launched this whole attack on the planet and they are the enemy of humanity and need to be stood up against
[2:48:55.000 --> 2:49:00.000]  At the end the globalists admit they're building a post human world
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:06.000]  And now that we're inside the cage it's going to move very very quickly into its in game
[2:49:06.000 --> 2:49:20.000]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this
[2:49:20.000 --> 2:49:25.000]  This is your dignity your soul your future being poured inside out
[2:49:25.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity for its own selfless disgusting power trip
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:50:02.000]  These are some pretty walled phone calls and we're just taking them if you think COVID-19 is super real in the end of the world and you love the response you love Fauci
[2:50:02.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  You love the Wuhan lab you love Gigi Ping you're welcome to call 877-789-2539
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:12.000]  But this country is in a civil war with Chai Kong globalist fifth column
[2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:21.000]  You know I haven't said that in a long time now that's coming out the president's saying and the president's pragmatic he loves America he loves free market
[2:50:21.000 --> 2:50:29.000]  He doesn't like seeing us get screwed over for no reason but he keeps thinking he can fix things just playing patty cake with these folks you can't
[2:50:29.000 --> 2:50:32.000]  You know they launched this on purpose folks
[2:50:32.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  Alright next segment Joe's in Ohio this is a short segment grandmother died tested negative still cold COVID death we'll go to Joe in a moment
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:45.000]  We got Phil and Jason and John and Josh and everybody else
[2:50:45.000 --> 2:50:50.000]  Let's talk to Josh in Arizona Josh thanks for holding her on the air
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  Hey Alex hey how you doing thanks for let me state my
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:05.000]  Well hey most talk shows make you kiss their butt I appreciate you calling and being a listener Josh so thank you go ahead don't put the cart before the horse my friend
[2:51:05.000 --> 2:51:12.000]  Love you guys hey I appreciate it so my stepfather 86 years old chronic diabetes
[2:51:12.000 --> 2:51:24.000]  He had he was suffering from heart failure due to pneumonia he had chronic pneumonia he'd been in another hospital for months prior to the quote unquote pandemic
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:35.000]  In fact just two weeks earlier and they had tested him as and he came back negative for Corona he never left the house after that
[2:51:35.000 --> 2:51:43.000]  Okay so he he was having difficulty breathing and you know so I called the hospital
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:55.000]  We they take him in and he had heart failure he had water on the lungs and just you know a lot of problems 86 years old foot rotting off from diabetes
[2:51:55.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  Every I mean everything you could imagine it was his time to go
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  It was it was he was one of my best friends and I loved him but you know I the right I could see the writing on the wall
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:08.000]  Yeah he was having to meet the Lord
[2:52:08.000 --> 2:52:19.000]  Yeah yeah so I take him to the hospital Alex and at the front there's like this hint okay there's a guy out there with a smock on and some gloves
[2:52:19.000 --> 2:52:33.000]  No mask he greets us he takes he takes my stepfather's temperature and call somebody else out they you know it's like this theater it's that's the perfect word for it
[2:52:33.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  I've heard you use it before it was like this theater to create this perception that in fact this guy could be like you know the contagion right
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:54.000]  So they take him they admit him I keep they won't let family or visitors into the hospital and so I'm locked out but they just let me go
[2:52:54.000 --> 2:53:05.000]  If this guy is you know a risk factor to their hospital and the community why would they I took him to the hospital why would they just let me go
[2:53:05.000 --> 2:53:09.000]  Well anyways you know without testing me without you know
[2:53:09.000 --> 2:53:21.000]  On the end of the claim he had coronavirus right right so at the end you know right four days later he he finally passed away but he was put on comfort care and all this stuff
[2:53:21.000 --> 2:53:30.000]  And it wasn't heart failure it wasn't the chronic diabetes it wasn't the pneumonia it wasn't any of that it was coronavirus
[2:53:30.000 --> 2:53:38.000]  Of course it was and that's what they admit they do Fauci and them don't even deny they're doing it so then most of these numbers are people that were already dying
[2:53:38.000 --> 2:53:47.000]  And then most of the time they admit they didn't even really test positive because the main test they use only means that you've had a corona virus not COVID-19
[2:53:47.000 --> 2:53:55.000]  But the same family sometime in the last decade just think about how they're executing this giant fraud in front of everyone
[2:53:55.000 --> 2:54:04.000]  Yeah yeah and and locking everyone out of the hospital like you know you couldn't see him from behind glass you couldn't you couldn't communicate with him
[2:54:04.000 --> 2:54:09.000]  Did they snake a ventilator down him to get that extra 39 grand?
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:20.000]  Alex they I don't I my mom had power of attorney so she declined the intubation
[2:54:20.000 --> 2:54:26.000]  Well good that didn't get that money well I'm sad to hear that he went but you will see him again my friend and I'm glad you told your story
[2:54:26.000 --> 2:54:32.000]  More people can tell their story and not just here where we're kind of preaching to the choir you need to tell your story everywhere
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:40.000]  God bless you and folks another way to not just preach the choir everyone you know about info wars.com forward slash show and band on video spread the truth you are Paul Revere
[2:54:40.000 --> 2:54:49.000]  I'm always excited about info wars life products they're amazing they're cutting edge you love them I love them and they find the info war in the face of the globalist onslaught
[2:54:49.000 --> 2:55:03.000]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing the only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it
[2:55:03.000 --> 2:55:19.000]  And there's another innovation it's the spray cap it doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick gross goo but it's high quality and aerosolizes it in a really great way I like to put it on my hands rub a little bit on my face
[2:55:19.000 --> 2:55:26.000]  It's got organic alcohol in it so spray it right in your eyes but I just love it personally has something that's a moisturizer as well
[2:55:26.000 --> 2:55:35.000]  So this is a real innovation I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out and smells great
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:39.000]  It's so refreshing this is a big winner
[2:55:39.000 --> 2:55:41.000]  You
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:59.000]  You found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:13.000]  You
[2:56:30.000 --> 2:56:36.000]  Tuesday may fit transmission and this is the reality of what's unfolding
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:48.000]  This is the globalist takeover it is a product of an open free society that it creates decadence and then corruption and then tyranny and then collapse
[2:56:48.000 --> 2:56:56.000]  And we go in this cycle but the globalist openly say that they're going to use robots and other techniques of social conditioning to make sure when we collapse this time
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  Humanity never rises again and out of this a new civilization the post human civilization the silicon civilization rises this is the actual cult of the globalist it's public
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  And people ask how did I predict all this because they admit that that is their plan
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  In fact I saved a screenshot on my phone I'm at the sentence of the producers saw this weekend of a new movie out where the guy has his consciousness put into a computer and then it's wonderful once he does it
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:42.000]  I mean this is all just absolutely sick folks it's not going to be your consciousness you're going to be killed with the AI would have recorded your every move how you talk your voice print what you do to where then the avatar that will be in the computer will be able to fool your family
[2:57:42.000 --> 2:58:01.000]  Then the computer will have a relationship with you and your family and it's just the next level of fraud yeah here it is what's the show called upload and so he's sick he's dying but it's okay because the digital afterlife and of course you have to die when they do the upload
[2:58:01.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  You can't live for some reason just like in the movie avatar he dies when his body's transferred the other life you're just transferring all the thoughts there's not a soul there well then why couldn't you just transfer it but then once he uploads everything is wonderful he can just do whatever he wants
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:47.000]  This is what they're selling us they're gonna lock us in our houses tell us we can't leave but say don't worry you can do all this new amazing stuff just leave the real world to the globalist and then they can trick you when you're in this hologram agreeing to sign on to the paperwork so that your carbon footprint will be reduced to actually go digital and get rid of your body and they'll cheer you and you'll be a celebrity and you'll be 100 feet tall at the football game those that do it
[2:58:47.000 --> 2:58:57.000]  This is a pure seduction it's an absolute lie everything these people tell you is a lie but right now let's go to your phone calls
[2:58:57.000 --> 2:59:05.000]  Let's go to Joe in Ohio Joe grandmother died tested negative still told COVID death tell us about that
[2:59:05.000 --> 2:59:07.000]  Hey Alex how you doing
[2:59:07.000 --> 2:59:12.000]  Man I'm watching the whole market to be satanic seduction unfolds pretty scary
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:26.000]  Yeah it's pretty unfortunate hey listen my 96 year old grandmother had pneumonia up in Michigan so she's in the hospital last week and five you know not one five negative COVID-19 test
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:35.000]  My uncle was up there and he's like you know if it's negative why are you still calling it COVID-19 and he's like well she has symptoms
[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:43.000]  You know she's 90 since she was old she had no cough no fever and she had pneumonia that was probably brought on from a compression fracture
[2:59:43.000 --> 2:59:49.000]  She probably couldn't take deep breaths anyway she passed away Friday and they started giving her morphine
[2:59:49.000 --> 2:59:50.000]  Sorry to hear that brother
[2:59:50.000 --> 3:00:01.000]  Yeah thanks Alex so you know about the evening she passed but you know it's a shame she had six kids not one person up there to hold her hand you know at the very end
[3:00:01.000 --> 3:00:07.000]  Oh that's so evil yet it's so satanic to not let your family be there show this evil medical system can do whatever it wants
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:13.000]  Oh yeah and then they still say well it's pneumonia but it's caused by COVID-19 I'm just like what a joke
[3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:22.000]  So they got these half-hearted measures for the funeral this Friday we've got to go up to Nazi Michigan and
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  Well another reason I want you there and a lot of times they're going to start stealing the organs man
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  Well they're converting through peer pressure in the hospitals to just absolute pure evil
[3:00:31.000 --> 3:00:32.000]  Oh yeah
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:41.000]  And now they've all been corrupted miscoding COVID-19 all the FBI's got to do in going to any hospital ask a few questions they'll all roll over piss on themselves
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:45.000]  And do whatever they're told into the future this is a design corruption
[3:00:45.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  For sure and what's funny when I was waiting online for you I was going through some emails and I had one from LabCorp and they're offering their new test
[3:00:53.000 --> 3:01:00.000]  You know but it's the test or antibodies and like you know I told my wife I said hell you probably have that you were sick back in February
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  But remember most they admit that there's a whole bunch of companies that have read up on this
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:11.000]  Even with the antibodies it's a false positive most of the time because if you've had the coronavirus in the last decade or so
[3:01:11.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  You understand you will show antibodies because it's the same family does that make sense
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  I mean those tests don't tell you the exact type of coronavirus there's already 30 plus mutations confirmed in the U.S. alone
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:24.000]  50 in Europe I mean it's pure pure BS
[3:01:24.000 --> 3:01:31.000]  Hey you think this is what I think I think they're really they want to roll out more tests but they'll find that these people have these antibodies
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:34.000]  Just more excuse to shut down slow down
[3:01:34.000 --> 3:01:40.000]  Exactly and again that's why Trump has to go oh there'll be more deaths now because they're not anybody dies of anything
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  They're going to be COVID from now on the hospital is going to get all that money they have incentivized the fraud
[3:01:45.000 --> 3:01:48.000]  God bless your brother sorry about your grandmother thank you Joe
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  Let's talk to Jason in Connecticut then Christina Amy and John Jason go ahead thank you for calling
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  Oh you're welcome hi Alex I'm a longtime listener since about 2003 and you need to get Austin Steinbart QAnon on the show
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:10.000]  You know a few weeks back you announced that QAnon will come on the show and Austin Steinbart is Q
[3:02:10.000 --> 3:02:16.000]  He's a DIA agent and he was arrested by the FBI last month just like they did
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:24.000]  You know they're trying to railroad him like General Flynn QAnon is a real military intelligence project and Austin Steinbart is Q
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:32.000]  And he needs the overwhelming Democratic mandate to arrest the deep state so you could email Q Team staff
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  Jason Jason Jason I know the Q thing says it's okay to lie and stuff like that I don't believe that
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:45.000]  And I'm not saying some people that like Q aren't doing some good work and it's fun to follow breadcrumbs and do all that stuff
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:50.000]  And I said I was thinking about exposing the original guys that put it out and they got hijacked
[3:02:50.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  But I haven't done that yet I'm still thinking about it you know one of the guys has been promoting Bill Gates and stuff
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  But you said you called in about mother-in-law is doctor at hospital no surge is that a you have a real mother-in-law is that real Jason
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  Yes my mother-in-law is a doctor at a hospital and there really is no surge I mean I think out of the hundreds of patients you've seen
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  One person tested positive but I don't really believe the test I mean I think everyone has COVID it's just it's just a BS to basically get that $39,000
[3:03:23.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  No I agree with you Jason but what does your mother-in-law think it is
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  Well my mother-in-law thinks she's obviously going along with the brainwashing I'm not knowing what to think when they lie to you so brazenly
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  So but you definitely need to get Austin Steinbart Q and on on the show and I think that's going to be the biggest show bigger than your Joe Rogan show
[3:03:44.000 --> 3:03:56.000]  Because once you hear what Austin Steinbart has to say I'm pretty sure you guys will be locked up together because a lot of things that he says is things that I've heard you say over the 15 years that I've listened to you
[3:03:56.000 --> 3:04:04.000]  He's 29 years old he's locked down right now he has a flip phone I could get you in direct contact with him on your show
[3:04:04.000 --> 3:04:18.000]  Listen I appreciate your call man you know that's the thing about this Q deal is that is that anybody can say they're this or they can say they're that because people love something that's nebulous and something that can't be proven
[3:04:18.000 --> 3:04:32.000]  And then no one cares about Fauci confirmed running the Wuhan Bioweapons COVID-19 program that's like confirmed and no one even cares
[3:04:32.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  And then these people nebulously tell you I'm this is happening to me or that's happening to me and it's just I just okay great Q's all real it's great to do it something that's just not me
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:56.000]  Okay I just am not involved in it I went out to one of the rallies the other day here in Austin to open things up and there was like five or six guys in Q-shirts they were just looking at me it's been like they're like they're like God's here Q's above that
[3:04:56.000 --> 3:05:16.000]  And it's like you know meanwhile one of the guys that started the Q day was a Trump campaign person in the White House and another one was in US intelligence and they did it as something to try to be able to put dirt out on Hillary and people and not get in trouble like I got in trouble doing
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:29.000]  And then it got out of control and then it got taken away from them and I've got to give those guys I've had a lot going on since then a chance to come out and talk about it but at the end of the day it's not really that important
[3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:39.000]  It's just maniac level folks I'm going to come back and I'm going to take your phone calls on what's really happening to martial law
[3:05:39.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think even if it ends up hurting me short term I believe in God and I believe in the long run
[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:51.000]  It'll end up being better for myself than everybody else in this world we live together in
[3:05:51.000 --> 3:05:57.000]  I understand what comes around goes around and you read what you saw and I live that and I fundamentally at a cellular level understand it
[3:05:57.000 --> 3:06:05.000]  Now if I would have hiked up the virus was going to kill 3, 4, 5 million people like the UN did I would have sold five times more supplements
[3:06:05.000 --> 3:06:13.000]  But you know what I didn't do that but I said on a routine basis regardless people are vitamin D deficient people are deficient
[3:06:13.000 --> 3:06:17.000]  I had died and so many other issues you need those products regardless
[3:06:17.000 --> 3:06:25.000]  So when we started selling out of vitamin mineral fusion all the other products I cut the prices from 30% off to 60% off
[3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:32.000]  Because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their bodies defenses
[3:06:32.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  But now I'm telling you with the economic crisis going on get your storable food now
[3:06:37.000 --> 3:06:42.000]  How do you put a people under house arrest? How do you put them under siege?
[3:06:42.000 --> 3:06:51.000]  Well you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist deep state and then had China release
[3:06:51.000 --> 3:06:57.000]  To then take down the populist president and those pesky American people that have become too uppity
[3:06:57.000 --> 3:07:02.000]  Bill Ma or even admitted it man I hope we have a depression and now they've tailored the whole thing
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:09.000]  Where the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed along with the help of the blue cities and blue states
[3:07:09.000 --> 3:07:15.000]  All the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates
[3:07:15.000 --> 3:07:22.000]  If America is that stupid we deserve what happens to us but as for me I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it
[3:07:22.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody safe but that's not what they're doing
[3:07:28.000 --> 3:07:53.000]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings our health our whole world and committing millions of third world people to death
[3:07:58.000 --> 3:08:13.000]  You know I mean I could tell you who first started the whole Q thing and I'm so close to doing it but I just I've gotten busy
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:18.000]  And I should have called up a couple of these guys but I don't want to get one of them in trouble
[3:08:18.000 --> 3:08:27.000]  I don't get any of them in trouble they're not bad guys because they're not what Q is today but it wouldn't matter even if I had released who it was
[3:08:27.000 --> 3:08:34.000]  I don't want to believe the truth people that are into that kind of stuff they just want to believe fantasy lands
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:42.000]  And so okay trust the plan as we all go they all go
[3:08:42.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  Meanwhile it's the patriots getting overrun and attacked and harassed and you've still got the Justice Department full of Clinton operatives and Obama operatives
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:09:01.000]  We're talking about 135 million people starving to death now, we're talking about the world government, we're talking about the shutdown of small businesses
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  We're talking about people submitting to all this tyranny and how dangerous it is
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Pennsylvania thanks for holding a pharmacy worker on vaccines and COVID-19 thank you for calling sir
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:17.000]  Hey Alex I got a question for you
[3:09:17.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  Yes sir
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:23.000]  What are you waiting for? What are you scared of? Listen I'm a supporter of you man
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:25.000]  But here's the thing think about it like this
[3:09:25.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  Every 30 million people out of work everybody's sitting around let's rally
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  Hold a rally in Washington DC you'll get six people put a call out make it in June
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  Tell them we're going to come rally we're going to group up we need to mobilize Alex
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  Sir I agree I mean listen we've called for demonstrations all over the country and I've had a bunch of demonstrations here in Austin and they tried to take my kids
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:53.000]  I mean I put my money where my mouth is
[3:09:53.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  We were the first to demonstrate out there back when nobody was demonstrating and so you say what am I waiting for
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  I mean we set up info wars and you guys have supported us and I work seven days a week and I mean what am I supposed to do
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:13.000]  Brother you are you're a Paul Revere but listen I'm just trying to give you an idea
[3:10:13.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  Dude if we could just monthly organize it and come together
[3:10:18.000 --> 3:10:26.000]  You know everybody thinks if you go to the mall and you get 10,000 20,000 30,000 people there that he gets on the news they just ignore it
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:35.000]  Now if everyone just didn't wait and everyone traveled to DC pick a time next week next month tomorrow and you went there and you bullhorned the White House
[3:10:35.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  They actually hear you I've gone and done it and it gets on the news
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:45.000]  First time I did it they had a Twitter was there and they all thought that I must have been tipped up in the White House
[3:10:45.000 --> 3:10:51.000]  No I just I was planning on the next day we were sitting down to eat at Trump Hotel and I said I feel a disturbance in the force
[3:10:51.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  Let's go to the White House now
[3:10:54.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  I just said we were already ordering food I said let's go now
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:03.000]  I was going to eat food take a shower we just flown in I was hungry I was going to go the next day
[3:11:03.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  And I we drove and I bullhorned and it went on Fox News singing and they're like Alex Jones is here he knows their meeting
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:14.000]  And you know Trump all heard it and everything else because everybody else bullhorn is like at the crowd or they aim that bullhorn up
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:21.000]  I love the old man he aims it up he likes to do that nobody hears that you got to aim it right on straight at a building and it bounces off of it
[3:11:21.000 --> 3:11:25.000]  And I laid it all out and Trump heard about it well what if people did that every day
[3:11:25.000 --> 3:11:32.000]  What if you and your church got the thing it needs to be every day out there and then you get on the news and then it has an effect
[3:11:32.000 --> 3:11:36.000]  So I've done it I've done a bunch of stuff and I'm not saying I won't do it
[3:11:36.000 --> 3:11:41.000]  But I've got a lot of things organized here a lot of things we're trying to do
[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:47.000]  And but I mean I think that's a good idea I'm just saying going to the mall
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  And having an event no one watches it does that makes everybody saw Martin Luther King do it the media covered that most those events don't get covered did you know that
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  No that's true now can you please just let me tell I love you I said
[3:11:59.000 --> 3:12:03.000]  I mean you need to say what am I waiting for and I'm not waiting for anything but you go ahead
[3:12:03.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  I've posed a hypothetical question I'm trying to have a dialogue with no it's okay go ahead man I love you man
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  I'm not saying that I'm just talking about everybody ought to go on their own pilgrimage but I'm sorry but notice Congress is closed
[3:12:15.000 --> 3:12:20.000]  They're not supposed to go see your representatives now this is all their takeover this is martial law it's all it is go ahead
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:24.000]  Okay listen but it's seriously though
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:27.000]  We don't need to preface it anymore just tell me tell me say it
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:29.000]  I have a couple questions I have a couple questions
[3:12:29.000 --> 3:12:37.000]  Who owns Google who owns Microsoft who owns Oracle you know the owners of them that'll that'll really gauge to me how well you know what's going on
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:41.000]  Either you know it completely or you're being intellectually dishonest with your listeners
[3:12:41.000 --> 3:12:50.000]  This is a one-on-one ship I appreciate your call and yeah I mean I know who the owners of it are we go down the line from Eric Schmidt to Sergey Brin
[3:12:50.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  And I mean all the rest of them my memory isn't what it used to be but I mean I know about the Google board I know that Alphabet sits on top of it
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  I know that Schmidt's gone back to you know bring the Pentagon up to speed on AI war systems and all the rest of it
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:10.000]  And so that's basically it I mean I've been covering Google since its inception but I'm intellectually dishonest I'm best at by you
[3:13:10.000 --> 3:13:16.000]  I need to step up I need you more and I need to know the whole board of Google for you right now that's constantly changing
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:23.000]  Another front man is Sundar Pachai heads up Google right now and he's a part owner of it as well he's worth two billion dollars
[3:13:23.000 --> 3:13:31.000]  Okay let's go ahead and talk to Christina in New York brother is a doctor go ahead
[3:13:31.000 --> 3:13:39.000]  Hi Alex I'm a long time listener I've spoken to you before I've called in I'm calling in today I have a brother and a sister-in-law who work in Pennsylvania
[3:13:39.000 --> 3:13:48.000]  Two hospitalers they both were on the COVID floor they both said they had nothing close to what we saw in New York nothing close
[3:13:48.000 --> 3:14:00.000]  They had patients that came in were treated and sent home but just today and last week there's a new announcement of a Kawasaki virus that is hitting children
[3:14:00.000 --> 3:14:07.000]  And they're saying that it's linked to COVID-19 so they weren't happy going after our elderly and killing them off
[3:14:07.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  But now they're going to hit the kids to keep everybody's submission and I want you to look into this I waited all day to call you
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:17.000]  Because I know that you will find out what is going on
[3:14:17.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  I saw the article about the new mystery illness that hits children and you lock children up when they're supposed to be outside you lock a dog up it's going to get sick
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:32.000]  You lock a Labrador Traveller up inside for months it's going to get sick and there it is Kawasaki disease the latest weird illness from coronavirus
[3:14:32.000 --> 3:14:42.000]  So yes first there was the weird loss of smell and taste associated with COVID-19 infections then there was COVID-19 toes now there is particular rashes
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:50.000]  Now we have another unusual syndrome causing illnesses in children and Kawasaki disease many of the rashes have been thought to be to vasolitis or blood vessel inflammation
[3:14:50.000 --> 3:14:58.000]  How about 5G if it's known actually in studies to cause vasolitis look it up and it creates a type of gaseous chain reaction inside the body
[3:14:58.000 --> 3:15:01.000]  What do you think is going on here Christina?
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:09.000]  In Britain in Italy where my daughter is right now in lockdown with my two grandchildren and in Spain now it hit New York
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:16.000]  So what are they going to do roll out something to attack all the children now because this is not enough it's not enough
[3:15:16.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  I don't see where I don't see how we can stay like this in lockdown and let these demons get rid of get get get away with this this is a nightmare
[3:15:24.000 --> 3:15:28.000]  It's a nightmare what they're doing to our country and to our world
[3:15:28.000 --> 3:15:31.000]  I just can't imagine what we're going to do
[3:15:31.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  Well they're teaching us to just be constantly scared of everything and then they know they lock you up you're going to get super sick people need vitamin D3
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:44.000]  So if you're locked up inside you need vitamin D3 if you go outside and get 30 minutes of sun couple times a week you're A-OK
[3:15:44.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  Christina I hear you say your brother's a doctor New York data is BS tell us about that
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:56.000]  Well he's in Pennsylvania they're both there in Pennsylvania two different hospitals the Lenova and Einstein
[3:15:56.000 --> 3:16:03.000]  And they said that they didn't see as many cases at all they were seeing some there were people coming in with different things
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:10.000]  But likely again people had other problems it wasn't it wasn't this kill spree you know what I mean people
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:16.000]  Exactly well they're taking all the regular deaths and putting it on for the COVID-19 stack that's on record
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:21.000]  But New York City is run by by demons literally
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:27.000]  I hear you and that's why they're doing all these scams so beware and get out of Babylon the exodus of New York's accelerated
[3:16:27.000 --> 3:16:33.000]  There's a lot of great people there but it's run by demons as you said God bless you Christina chase Karen and Melissa
[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:37.000]  We're going right to your calls in t-minus four minutes
[3:16:37.000 --> 3:16:52.000]  It was only four months ago that I warned President Trump and the American people that Cobra would never stand for you resisting our takeover
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:59.000]  There is no limit to which we will not stop to make you bow via the fear that is innate in your hearts
[3:16:59.000 --> 3:17:11.000]  It was I the leader of Cobra that foresaw your inner cowardice and how much you would enjoy watching Netflix and wearing masks and gloves when you went out
[3:17:11.000 --> 3:17:15.000]  To feel all important like you were in a war
[3:17:15.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  With the real time that of Cobra was always the billions of people at the edge of starvation
[3:17:22.000 --> 3:17:29.000]  Who about dying at the tune of over a million people every three weeks
[3:17:29.000 --> 3:17:31.000]  Cobra thanks you for what you've done
[3:17:31.000 --> 3:17:36.000]  Continue the lockdowns while I depopulate the planet
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:37.000]  Hail Cobra
[3:17:37.000 --> 3:17:48.000]  Hiding in plain view Politico the Associated Press you name it admit that half a billion people extra 500 million are now at the subsistence starvation level
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:52.000]  On top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown
[3:17:52.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  That is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:18:07.000]  And the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the chai comms at the World Health Organization with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society
[3:18:07.000 --> 3:18:10.000]  Create a depression and forcibly inoculate everybody this is insane
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen they succeed it's over
[3:18:13.000 --> 3:18:19.000]  You need to get prepared now you need to get high quality storeable food now back in stock at infowarstore.com
[3:18:19.000 --> 3:18:23.000]  And you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere
[3:18:23.000 --> 3:18:29.000]  Big tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people and to send you can't even challenge verbally social distancing
[3:18:29.000 --> 3:18:35.000]  This is beyond 1984 the tyranny of the dual orders here get prepared now and spread the word in the info war
[3:18:35.000 --> 3:18:37.000]  You are the Paul Revere's
[3:18:37.000 --> 3:18:43.000]  Make a friend with death it's a saying so old that no one knows who first said it
[3:18:43.000 --> 3:18:49.000]  Every culture has their own way of memorializing that simple statement
[3:18:49.000 --> 3:18:55.000]  But you don't want to make a friend of the death of civilization and the death of the human species
[3:18:55.000 --> 3:19:00.000]  The moment of truth is now here we are facing the post human era
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:09.000]  And I've been warning you for many years they would use a global viral crisis to click put us in the cage and then roll out the robot takeover
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:16.000]  This is just the beta test China is moving out of beta and into operational control
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:23.000]  In just a few years we will be under full globalist control forced inoculations total surveillance
[3:19:23.000 --> 3:19:29.000]  We're all being taught that we are obsolete the term they use is non essential
[3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:37.000]  This is not some dystopian novel this is reality this is the new world order this is Satanism
[3:19:59.000 --> 3:20:07.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:17.000]  You know I'm tempted
[3:20:19.000 --> 3:20:26.000]  Because I already knew this stuff and I've done the research back at the time and I've talked to a few of the people who are in the White House
[3:20:26.000 --> 3:20:34.000]  And one of them is like can you believe Q's attacking me now it's been taken away from us by some bad operatives
[3:20:34.000 --> 3:20:40.000]  And how ridiculous it is that they're you know attacking this one individual saying he's bad
[3:20:40.000 --> 3:20:45.000]  When that person was involved intellectually in hatching the whole cube plot
[3:20:45.000 --> 3:20:54.000]  Because again everybody saw the success we had exposing Hillary Clinton and the spirit cooking and how we boosted the WikiLeaks information once it was out
[3:20:54.000 --> 3:20:58.000]  Info Wars was very successful with that information
[3:20:58.000 --> 3:21:04.000]  Back when Drudge Report was different and was boosting it as well helping get Trump in
[3:21:07.000 --> 3:21:18.000]  And then to just watch Q turn into this societal phenomenon of just average folks thinking they're talking to Trump or something
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:25.000]  And just being off in La La Land I'm not even against the people that want to believe it at all and get into it
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  It's just that it's esoteric to like go off codes and you know connect the dot things when we have it all out in the open in front of us
[3:21:40.000 --> 3:21:49.000]  It's the world government the New World Order event 201 lockstep the fact that all the bell curves were wrong
[3:21:49.000 --> 3:21:55.000]  And it was you know a micron of what it really was and they're killing people for the coding
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:22:04.000]  That's real stuff so much real stuff that I can't even wrap my head around how suddenly we're inside the New World Order
[3:22:04.000 --> 3:22:12.000]  And just all the stuff about sessions is good and they're gonna arrest everybody and stick with the plan and
[3:22:12.000 --> 3:22:17.000]  Meanwhile there's a real civil war going on in the government and Trump's barely hanging on
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:25.000]  And they've got the FBI elements that work for the Democrats still because just departments both groups
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:34.000]  Out engaged and co until pro and out engaged in plans to try to set up from supporters ahead of the election very soon
[3:22:34.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  I live in the real world and so and I talked to the real serious people and so that's why to see kind of a
[3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:49.000]  It'd be like if I was really on Wall Street really buying and selling companies and businesses at a billionaire level
[3:22:49.000 --> 3:22:55.000]  And then I saw kids playing on a monopoly board and they walked over to me and said hey buddy you're not for real
[3:22:55.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  It's just it's like obscene and it just slips into this whole world of you know delusional stuff
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:14.000]  And you know oh well these people with cues say this about Alex Jones and it'll be the most outlandish made up stuff
[3:23:14.000 --> 3:23:19.000]  And so I'm done talking about it people calling about it they want to ask me about it I don't even think you know what
[3:23:19.000 --> 3:23:24.000]  The Q people don't even need to know who Q is fine okay you don't believe me anyway so I'm not going to tell you
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:30.000]  All right how's that sound all right I'll live here in the real world where I pay real consequences for what I do
[3:23:30.000 --> 3:23:38.000]  And I'll keep moving forward you know I'll have dozens of people send me a video a month ago
[3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:45.000]  And look the Q person says that now China's the enemy and there's a fifth column in America
[3:23:45.000 --> 3:23:54.000]  And I'm just like and what the hell does that mean I mean I'm not in competition with this stuff
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:24:00.000]  We pioneered exposing all of this and I want everybody to adopt this information
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:06.000]  I want to defeat the new order I don't territorialize this stuff but that's what a lot of the Q movement pimps
[3:24:06.000 --> 3:24:11.000]  That kind of spread the bread comes around and stuff and manipulate audiences thinking they're getting some magical esoteric thing
[3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:19.000]  That's what Satanism is where you join these cults believing you're going to get the secret knowledge by doing more and more what they say
[3:24:19.000 --> 3:24:25.000]  And the secret knowledge is they know how to manipulate you with secret knowledge the secret knowledge is how to manipulate you
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:31.000]  I'm trying to expose the secret knowledge of how you're manipulated to stop it there's the knowledge of good and the knowledge of evil
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  Now we're all falling and falling short of the glory of God
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:42.000]  But I know the knowledge of good it's systems that work that are truthful that make sense that are wholesome and that are transparent
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:52.000]  Those are the systems of God the systems of evil are systems that are parasitic and feed on things and build destruction and build collapse
[3:24:52.000 --> 3:24:59.000]  But that the magicians feed off of of course they themselves and the Faustian bargain are then destroyed in the end
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:05.000]  So I don't want to be part of the Faustian operations I don't want to be part of Machiavellian cloak and dagger
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:11.000]  My power is being out in the open and being very very honest about what I say and what I do
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:17.000]  Except when I engage in satire which is a great form of truth but people have to be smart to understand it and of course the audience gets it
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:25.000]  But the enemy takes it out of context edits it and then you know at first it seems like we're losing with satire
[3:25:25.000 --> 3:25:29.000]  But then it always boomerangs around and as he makes us even stronger in the end
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:37.000]  Now the final segment is coming up I'm going to go to Melissa who's a medical worker laid off and then Karen, general caller, father in and out of hospitals
[3:25:37.000 --> 3:25:43.000]  Chase, security, IT for hospitals, COVID-19 patients, in fact we'll go to him first he's actually the longest holding
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:48.000]  And then Phil let me just say this again real world
[3:25:48.000 --> 3:25:52.000]  Alex Jones is my name I'm not Bill Hicks that's a thing on the internet
[3:25:52.000 --> 3:26:00.000]  When you order something from us unless you order on like a Friday or Saturday it shipped out the next day
[3:26:00.000 --> 3:26:04.000]  When you order storeable food from us it gets packaged it's high quality you get it
[3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:15.000]  When you order our organic three different scent essential oil hand sanitizer you actually get it quickly it's actually high quality
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  I'm a real person I pay the taxes I go out the street and I want to thank our listeners for all their support because that's what's kept us in this position
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:41.000]  We were supposed to already be off the air and by the grace of God we were kept on air last year and I mortgaged my house this year to be able to buy product to go through the rest of the year or at least part of the year
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:54.000]  And we did have some big sales obviously because people are scouring internet for good things during this whole crisis and that put us with a little bit of funding into the end of the year
[3:26:54.000 --> 3:26:59.000]  And so God keeps providing like the widows might be run out and then all of a sudden something happens we get more money
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  But I really don't want to be in that position I want to be able to make some expansions to some really serious stuff we need to do
[3:27:04.000 --> 3:27:11.000]  So again you need fish oil you need krill oil it's back in stock 50% off it's amazing you need X2 but sold out for months
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  The best iodine you're going to find out there just a building block of everything it's so amazing
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:24.000]  Research iodine in the current situation research zinc in the current situation the real red pill real red pill plus it's going to probably be sold out in about a month
[3:27:24.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  We're still keeping the discount of 50% off because I want you to get it
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:34.000]  We also have vaso beats that's concentrated meat extract everybody knows what that does for you how it creates nitrous oxide in the body
[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:38.000]  But I would also say just get your storeable food now
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  Now it's more urgent than it was 12 weeks ago when I told people don't order food for the virus order food for the lockdown the collapse they're going to keep it locked down
[3:27:47.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  It's not going to be two weeks if you put up with it will be forever this is a post human takeover these are very evil people position you Genesis
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  This is a new type of war and your fear and demanding to be locked down is why Trump can't get you out of it because you will get yourself out of it
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:11.000]  But for economic war for them taking out Trump in case we fail and I give it about a 30% chance we're going to fail in this round
[3:28:11.000 --> 3:28:20.000]  You need to get your storeable food and it'll be very evident two three four months just how serious things are there's still time for you to get your orders in
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  And get the storeable food that way you get some of its quality that lasts a long time it's a backup you can store a backup you can bury it sealed these big plastic containers inside sealed bags on top of that
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  And then that's a backup an important thing you've got ready for you put it in the attic put it wherever take care of your neighbors it's high quality last 25 years
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:51.000]  And then that money comes in here to keep us in position in case all the supplies run out literally God let it on my heart you call it my subconscious but I believe in God just whatever it's been on my mind
[3:28:51.000 --> 3:29:02.000]  Hey Jones you don't like to really scare people you like to be optimistic but I'm like thinking we better just sell out of everything we've got and just have the war chest to go on because supply chains are breaking down
[3:29:02.000 --> 3:29:11.000]  And we're already from vitamin and mineral and supplement suppliers that are like already having trouble getting the supplies from around the United States we don't get it from China
[3:29:11.000 --> 3:29:18.000]  And they're already saying things are shutting down they may not be able to supply us and so they may not even take our money to reorder products we have everything in stock right now
[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:25.000]  Chips next day unless it's the food that that's get packaged and get out to you but I'm just telling you you need to understand we're not in regular times anymore
[3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  Everything's accelerating everything's contracting you need to get prepared now while supporting the info war whatever you do pray for info wars and spread the word about the transmission
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:47.000]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight if other human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying if you don't spread the word if you don't buy the products to fund our operation the dog doesn't hunt
[3:29:47.000 --> 3:29:58.000]  But you get that you are patriots you are people that live and work in the real world of a race color create and understand what's happening and that's why when you call in and thank me for what I've done it's really a sick joke
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:09.000]  Thank you for what you've done we're all of this together we believe in the rights of the unborn we believe in families we believe in the right to self-defense we believe in capitalism and America and Jesus Christ number one
[3:30:09.000 --> 3:30:18.000]  And we believe in free speech and so the fact that you shop with us and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing does everything in the world
[3:30:18.000 --> 3:30:32.000]  That's why I salute you and I thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have this whole planet sewn up by now they thought they'd be in charge they thought they would have won but they didn't count on you and I and others coming together so God bless you all
[3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:48.000]  Authoritarians across the planet want the power to be able to tell you to stay in your houses and don't leave and only go where they tell you to go it's called martial law it's called living in the authoritarian country
[3:30:48.000 --> 3:31:02.000]  Everybody knows that everybody understands that and the Democrats have now shown their hands with the deep state saying we're going to listen to Fauci and the World Health Organization who've done nothing but put out all this fake disinformation so far
[3:31:02.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  We're not going to listen to the president we're not going to listen to Congress but then all these other corporations are going to work in tandem with big tech to surveil and control and keep things shut down
[3:31:13.000 --> 3:31:30.000]  This is economic warfare and I know everybody understands that public with the president and others need to develop a plan to understand that this is a global corporate civil war and that we're being held hostage and this is a mutiny against our country by globalist forces
[3:31:30.000 --> 3:31:35.000]  Only understanding the reality and the magnitude of that gives us any chance of defeating it
[3:31:35.000 --> 3:31:47.000]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins, there are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us
[3:31:47.000 --> 3:31:52.000]  We may not be able to stop breathing but we can control what's in the air we breathe

[3:32:56.000 --> 3:33:03.000]  The globalists are running an operation, it's not predictions, we have their battle plans
[3:33:03.000 --> 3:33:10.000]  Going back more than eight weeks ago all major storeable food companies were sold out except my Patreon supply because they're the biggest and more preposition
[3:33:10.000 --> 3:33:16.000]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner
[3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:19.000]  They stopped taking orders till they got caught back up
[3:33:19.000 --> 3:33:26.000]  Now they're caught back up, they've got high quality storeable food in stock, ready to be packaged and shipped to you, get your orders in now
[3:33:26.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  At infohorsestore.com to go right at the head of the queue and get delivered to you as fast as possible and from the employer
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  Get your storeable food down at infohorsestore.com
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  One way or another the truth about this hoax is coming out
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:12.000]  Some of the new stories breaking at infohorsestore.com
[3:34:12.000 --> 3:34:18.000]  Zoomers, Peter Pants and sick new social media challenge, this is just the left going completely insane
[3:34:18.000 --> 3:34:23.000]  Mexican judge releases cartel boss who ordered hit on Breitbart, Texas writer
[3:34:23.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  I haven't even gotten into the couple guys from the special forces group
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:36.000]  Formerly trying to go in with another couple dozen people until Chavez are kidnapping
[3:34:36.000 --> 3:34:44.000]  Those people had a lot of balls, the CIA met with them supposedly in Jamaica and tried to talk them into not doing it
[3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:49.000]  And probably tattled on them, but that's a whole other fiasco right there
[3:34:49.000 --> 3:34:57.000]  Those guys have a lot of courage to have done that because Hugo Chavez has caused hundreds of thousands to starve to death
[3:34:57.000 --> 3:35:01.000]  Taking more of the richest countries in the world and absolutely destroyed it
[3:35:01.000 --> 3:35:06.000]  Let's jam in four calls before this hour ends and the war room starts though in Shroyer
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:12.000]  Let's talk to Chase in Missouri, so security IT for hospitals on COVID-19 patients data, go ahead sir
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:19.000]  I'm going to get through these two things. I know they've been discussed a lot. The Q things that give hard dates on when stuff's supposed to happen
[3:35:19.000 --> 3:35:27.000]  They're wrong every time. Two, I've talked to directors of major hospitals here in St. Louis about how many people have actually tested positive for COVID-19
[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:32.000]  In confidence they've told me usually less than it does in hundreds and hundreds
[3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:41.000]  It's not over a thousand of coming to get tested, but I wanted to ask you something Alex because I've heard you a few times recently
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:47.000]  Something about you're under an NDA non-disclosure agreement
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:51.000]  Something about like behind the scenes you can't tell us and really
[3:35:51.000 --> 3:35:59.000]  Well yeah, as a journalist I can sit there and have people bring me information about the Vegas attack and I started NDA on that
[3:35:59.000 --> 3:36:05.000]  Or if globalists wanted to meet with me and it's not a crime they're talking about then I'm not going to violate the NDA because I want that information
[3:36:05.000 --> 3:36:09.000]  But yeah, no, the globalists have tried to get me to join them
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  Oh definitely, I'm just saying if this is kind of where we're at the end here with the NDA stuff
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:19.000]  My question is kind of what are you waiting for?
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:24.000]  People don't even care. I can sit there and give them Noah's Ark. They don't give a damn. Here's the deal
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:30.000]  A journalist, I'm a pundit, I'm a father, I'm a talk show host, I'm a patriot
[3:36:30.000 --> 3:36:34.000]  But if I end up meeting with somebody, what my representatives does
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:39.000]  And they're just simply trying to get me to join them or whatever
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:42.000]  And that's a private meeting. I'm not going to say who did it
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  I mean, Henry Kissinger, the head of the Kissinger group, tried to hire me in front of John Harmon
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  And didn't have me sign an NDAA so he's right there and heard it
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  I mean, nobody cares. Okay, head of the Kissinger group, Rob Cobb tried to get me to join the New World Order
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:01.000]  It means nothing. No one cares. No one wants real meat and potatoes, man
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  We're real quick here. So, you know, you've laid out a lot of the names of who these people are
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  And I'm not saying anybody should do anything, but, you know, you've got a little bit of net worth, you know, with everything you've done
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  Not really
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:21.000]  Why don't you, you know, put some people together and we actually, you know, eliminate the
[3:37:21.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  Okay, I appreciate your call. I love everybody always calls me and says we need to kill people
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:31.000]  Globalists are killing the third world by cutting off the food supply and it needs to stop
[3:37:31.000 --> 3:37:35.000]  And you've got a fifth column run by foreign intelligence operations and things have gotten so bad
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:40.000]  I've said the president needs to look at foreign Chinese agents here committing crimes
[3:37:40.000 --> 3:37:45.000]  They need to be gone after by the executive branch and that's constitutional
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:49.000]  Okay, I'm not here like some secret agent
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:53.000]  I go home and take care of my four children at night and I work all the time
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:57.000]  So I keep getting these calls saying I need to do this. I need to do that
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  And everything I say is transparent. It's all out in the open. Okay, so I'm not going to go there
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  By the way, you've got even worse people underneath these globalists
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  You have to defeat their systems. You have to defeat their ideas. You don't defeat it by
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:18.000]  In fact, the last thing I want is something to happen to Bill Gates or any of them because it'll turn them into martyrs
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:23.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call. Melissa in Ohio, thanks for holding her on the air
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:25.000]  Hello, Mr. Jones
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:26.000]  Hi
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:33.000]  Hi. Yes, I am one of the healthcare workers who's been laid off because actually my job has been furloughed
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  Because of, I guess you could say, the coronavirus
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  Things are really slow in the hospitals right now and
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  You know, the patients that come to me, I work in a lab in a hospital around here
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:56.000]  And the patients that come in, they are always asking, you know, is it really busy there?
[3:38:56.000 --> 3:39:01.000]  I bet you guys are running crazy and it's like, no, we are not very busy at all
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  The hospitals around us are pretty much dead. That's why they're furloughed
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:09.000]  You remember just a few months ago we were conspiracy theorists though?
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, and the patients are surprised, I tell them, I'm like, don't listen to the media
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:22.000]  They are just trying to make us scared and try to make, you know, give us fear
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:32.000]  But, yeah, we're, I'm one of the few that are in the hospital that are telling people, you know, it's a hoax
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  They're just doing this to us to get us our fear up and to make us stay home and to not come out
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  And to be scared of it and I'm constantly telling my patients, don't listen to them
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  They're not right. They're lying to us. You really think the media loves and cares about us?
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:54.000]  And now a bar tries to reopen in West Texas and they send an armored giant tank
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  They need to vote that local sheriff and that government out
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:00.000]  And man, what you're doing is amazing and I know a lot of healthcare workers that are heroes
[3:40:00.000 --> 3:40:02.000]  They have really tough jobs when you do have a busy day
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  It's very stressful watching people die and going through all this stuff
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:10.000]  But then, meanwhile, to say that they're heroes for going along with the stand down
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:12.000]  Well, that is absolute fraud
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  God bless you and I appreciate your call, Melissa, great points
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:18.000]  Karen in Kansas, thanks for holding her on the ear
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  Hi Alex, I'm a second time caller, I called in 2013 and now again
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:25.000]  I'm trying to wake a lot of people up
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  I just want to know what we're going to do here with our health and the future
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:38.000]  My dad, Orange County, California, he's 83, passed away a few months ago
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  He was a Marine, he had his business for 58 years, he had brain surgery
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:44.000]  January 4th of 2019
[3:40:44.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  He's been in and out of hospital, assisted living
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:53.000]  The bottom line, I saw how they treated my father, my family
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:40:55.000]  They don't like you to question authority
[3:40:55.000 --> 3:40:58.000]  The people that help them, there are a few good people
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  But in general, a lot of them don't speak English
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:04.000]  And what are we going to do?
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  I mean, my dad, I got him out last year in August, took him home
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:13.000]  He, and he passed away the day after my birthday, January 2nd this year
[3:41:13.000 --> 3:41:14.000]  But what are we going to do?
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  I mean, I can't imagine not being able to visit him in assisted living
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:19.000]  He was in three assisted living
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  You question how they're taking care of them and now you can't even see your loved one
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:27.000]  What are we going to do? What are we going to do for our future?
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  Well, you're right, this is the ultimate takeover plan
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  Where you're all surveilled, your medical records are public
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  The regular cold virus now makes everyone susceptible, makes everybody a suspect
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  World governments here, they can ban travel, lock you in your house
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:49.000]  In places that are already under tyranny, like Spain, people have been locked up for two months
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:51.000]  Can't even leave to go to the grocery store
[3:41:51.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  It is hell on earth, Paul Watts' parents live in Spain
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  They can go once a week to the grocery store, only one person
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  And they're not allowed out more than five minutes per day
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:06.000]  They don't even let your dog use the bathroom outside you, but throw it out the window
[3:42:06.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  I mean, this is just seeing what they can do
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  France has now announced permanent tyranny, Macron at a 20% approval rating
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  Now he's a dictator
[3:42:14.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  Now look at this headline, Austria police may intervene if they see people kissing
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  Six degrees of separation is nothing but an occultic term
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:27.000]  That then got put in a white paper in 1929, and it adds up to 666
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  That's Wikipedia, can't make all this up
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:31.000]  Look at this, look at this crap
[3:42:31.000 --> 3:42:35.000]  I mean, these people know what they're doing, man, it's all insane
[3:42:35.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  What else do you think is going on, Karen?
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  Well, there is not a lot of truckers for food
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:49.000]  I've noticed that in middle America, that's kind of scary
[3:42:49.000 --> 3:42:53.000]  And there's just a lot of foreigners that don't speak English
[3:42:53.000 --> 3:42:56.000]  I mean, there's a lot of infiltration
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:42:58.000]  I don't know, I just think there's...
[3:42:58.000 --> 3:43:00.000]  I mean, the country is completely overrun
[3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:03.000]  The third world's collapsing, we're now being collapsed down
[3:43:03.000 --> 3:43:07.000]  Imagine the World Trade Centers, and the top floors start collapsing
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:09.000]  And this goes...
[3:43:09.000 --> 3:43:11.000]  And imagine the third world on bottom just...
[3:43:11.000 --> 3:43:16.000]  Again, when the first world collapses, the third world dies, and then we die
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:22.000]  And that's why I did the allegory, the analogy of Jonathan Swift and the modest proposal
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:25.000]  God bless you, and I really appreciate your call, Karen
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:29.000]  I'm sorry to fill, I got a lot of calls today, I think we did a pretty good job today
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:33.000]  Great job, the crew, Owen Schreuer is coming up, loaded for bear as usual
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:37.000]  I just cannot harp on this enough, you see how crazy things are
[3:43:37.000 --> 3:43:39.000]  You see how it just gets worse and worse
[3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:42.000]  Submission to this only means they get worse
[3:43:42.000 --> 3:43:45.000]  And the more we stand down, the more they tighten the news
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:47.000]  The more they put the handcuffs on us
[3:43:47.000 --> 3:43:51.000]  Governor Newsom is a psychotic demon monster, all of them are
[3:43:51.000 --> 3:43:55.000]  They want power, they want to bankrupt things to make you dependent
[3:43:55.000 --> 3:44:00.000]  And they're making their move, and Trump tried to keep things open, but everybody panicked
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:03.000]  So he shut it down, now he's trying to open their attack on him
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:07.000]  Stand with President Trump, stand with America, and realize we're at war with China
[3:44:07.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  And the Globalist, the Democratic Party, is a Communist Chinese fifth column
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:14.000]  And whatever you do, realize the archive of this live show will be at Band-Aut Video
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:17.000]  With amazing videos and all the infrastructure you built
[3:44:17.000 --> 3:44:20.000]  So use this infrastructure, we're not supposed to be on air now
[3:44:20.000 --> 3:44:23.000]  We were supposed to be off air when they launched this, but we're still here
[3:44:23.000 --> 3:44:30.000]  That's why they're trying to get ready to go to active measures against us
