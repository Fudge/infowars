[00:00.000 --> 00:28.820]  Well, it's official Donald Trump is President 45 and he'll be seated if he's not assassinated
[00:28.820 --> 00:35.680]  or in World War 3 in 30 days we're now just 30 days out from the historic inauguration
[00:35.680 --> 00:40.360]  but we're still gonna keep counting down because we saw the Russian ambassador to Turkey gun
[00:40.360 --> 00:46.160]  down in an art exhibit by a Turkish police officer screaming Allah Akbar but of course
[00:46.160 --> 00:52.400]  this has nothing to do with Islam as usual just like the 89 dead and niece and the 400
[00:52.400 --> 00:58.360]  plus wounded that attack in July and now of course we have the new attack in Berlin 12
[00:58.360 --> 01:06.120]  dead more than 70 people injured many of them in critical condition and first we heard
[01:06.120 --> 01:09.760]  was a self-driving truck but they don't make one for that company and then we heard it
[01:09.760 --> 01:17.120]  was a young Pakistani illegal immigrant or what's the term they use for migrants and
[01:17.120 --> 01:22.760]  now they're saying they don't know who so the media is calling it a truck attack and
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.840]  of course a month or so ago in Ohio we were told that the Somali stabbing nine people
[01:27.840 --> 01:33.280]  trying to run folks over was not Islamic even though he pledged allegiance to ISIS and
[01:33.280 --> 01:39.800]  Al Qaeda and was here illegally as usual Obama came out and lectured everyone that we should
[01:39.800 --> 01:44.840]  not criticize Islam there aren't many Muslim countries where they let Christians or Jews
[01:44.840 --> 01:48.160]  or anybody else live in peace there aren't many Muslim countries where women don't have
[01:48.160 --> 01:54.400]  to wear bags over their heads there aren't many Muslim countries where the Muslims live
[01:54.400 --> 01:57.820]  in peace with each other my God I don't want to be at war with the Muslims I was against
[01:57.820 --> 02:03.640]  the Iraq war I was against toppling Saddam who was one of the only secular people in
[02:03.640 --> 02:10.760]  the region and our government as usual trying to overthrow Assad who is secular and where
[02:10.760 --> 02:15.160]  Jews and Christians and people could live and non-radical Muslims all whites some of
[02:15.160 --> 02:21.760]  the Shiites that's not the case now our government as usual is allied with radical orthodox Islam
[02:21.760 --> 02:30.360]  orthodox Wahhabist Islam and why is that because Saudi Arabia sits on top of Mecca Saudi Arabia
[02:30.360 --> 02:35.800]  the modern country carved out of the Bedouin lands is what British intelligence put in
[02:35.800 --> 02:41.240]  charge of the region you know Lawrence of Arabia and it's the most radical oppressive
[02:41.240 --> 02:48.360]  form of it and it's taking over all of Islam whether historically golden arrows of Islam
[02:48.360 --> 02:55.280]  when it wasn't expansionist when it wasn't arts and sciences yes but just ask Constantinople
[02:55.280 --> 03:00.760]  and the Byzantine Empire what was left the Roman Empire about Islam they'll tell you
[03:00.760 --> 03:09.720]  that blue mosque there in Turkey formerly formerly of course Constantinople is now
[03:09.720 --> 03:17.360]  Istanbul and the men were all killed women were put into sex slavery of course the men
[03:17.360 --> 03:22.840]  were all killed slowly put in as galley slaves but again that's the religion of peace I'm
[03:22.840 --> 03:30.800]  cursed with knowing a little bit of history and so now we have the latest vicious Allah
[03:30.800 --> 03:34.840]  Akbar attack and the media is doing everything it can to cover it up and we're hearing that
[03:34.840 --> 03:39.360]  this is Merkel's fault we have German ministers coming out the parliament saying it's Merkel's
[03:39.360 --> 03:44.640]  fault why if you were in the Netherlands and you were a member of the parliament and said
[03:44.640 --> 03:50.160]  that you'd be arrested and indicted and convicted like we just saw a few weeks ago we're gonna
[03:50.160 --> 03:56.680]  be breaking that down as well today because the social engineers admit they're bringing
[03:56.680 --> 04:03.680]  in millions and millions and millions of Muslims from radical third world hell holes who are
[04:03.680 --> 04:11.720]  completely incompatible with Western civilization to make us then conform to it and change our
[04:11.720 --> 04:17.200]  laws so we don't stir them up and then we have to ban our free speech could we bring
[04:17.200 --> 04:24.160]  courage here got courage historically integrate could we bring Iraqis here 30 40 years ago
[04:24.160 --> 04:27.960]  that would integrate yes but now radical groups are taking over Iraq that's not really the
[04:27.960 --> 04:35.360]  case do Somalis end up attacking and murdering yes the Saudi Arabians end up doing that yes
[04:35.360 --> 04:41.440]  I mean folks if you preach the gospel on the streets of Riyadh Saudi Arabia you get multiple
[04:41.440 --> 04:49.440]  years in prison the next time you get executed oh and if you're gay you're dead but see I'm
[04:49.440 --> 04:54.040]  a right wing extremist because I don't want to accept people that are completely intolerant
[04:54.040 --> 05:01.520]  and chain women up like dogs we'll be back look at this nonsense from Darlene Superville
[05:01.520 --> 05:07.000]  of the Associated Press headline reads Trump blames terrorists for killing in Turkey Trump
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.520]  on Monday experienced what life will be like as president as he condemned separate deadly
[05:11.520 --> 05:15.720]  incidents against a Russian diplomat and shoppers at a German Christmas market blaming Islamic
[05:15.720 --> 05:20.920]  terrorism in both instances finally a president who calls it like it is but wait that's not
[05:20.920 --> 05:26.280]  how Darlene feels she says he offered no support for his claims that terrorists were responsible
[05:26.280 --> 05:31.760]  for the carnage what what what what world are you living in Darlene the shooter literally
[05:31.760 --> 05:37.160]  said Allah who Akbar and said he did this for jihad and what other incidents do we know of
[05:37.160 --> 05:41.760]  where crowds of people are run over by a truck if a hundred and twenty people were in a burning
[05:41.760 --> 05:45.760]  building and Trump saved a hundred nineteen of them Darlene would write a story saying
[05:45.760 --> 05:49.840]  Trump kills one in structure fire this is just like when they scolded Trump for referencing
[05:49.840 --> 05:55.000]  a bomb in New York back in September well he was right then and he is right now sorry

[08:04.320 --> 08:12.200]  on her way to work one morning down the path along the lake a tender hearted woman saw
[08:12.200 --> 08:21.040]  a poor half frozen snake his pretty colored skin had been all frosted with a dew oh well

[09:58.280 --> 10:08.280]  30 days until Donald J. Trump will be seated as the 45th president of the United States
[10:08.280 --> 10:15.760]  of America I'm Alex Jones your host the globalists are pulling out every stop they can to plunge
[10:15.760 --> 10:21.960]  the world into war cause civil unrest here in the United States and to raise interest
[10:21.960 --> 10:28.680]  rates to begin to plunge and to disintegrate the trump exuberance that we're seeing in
[10:28.680 --> 10:34.960]  the economy back in to the doldrums so the globalists the rent seekers can try to fully
[10:34.960 --> 10:42.200]  suffocate the economy and complete our journey into modern serfdom I'm your host Alex Jones
[10:42.200 --> 10:52.240]  thank you for joining us on this Tuesday 20th day of December 2016 worldwide transmission
[10:52.240 --> 10:58.960]  I was on national Russian television this morning and I was talking to some of the top
[10:58.960 --> 11:04.680]  intellectuals in Russia on the broadcast some of the people that advised Vladimir Putin
[11:04.680 --> 11:09.920]  and we were discussing the fact that the globalists are eugenicists establishing a planetary
[11:09.920 --> 11:15.480]  government they're playing nation states off against each other and trying to kill prosperity
[11:15.480 --> 11:19.880]  so that they can dictate the terms of human surrender to the populations how they're
[11:19.880 --> 11:25.920]  racing to put robots in and put AI in and all of our homes surveilling us selling it
[11:25.920 --> 11:30.920]  to us via Trojan horse systems and how the United States Russia Japan and the rest of
[11:30.920 --> 11:38.680]  the world must link up together try to free communist China and to try to empower humanity
[11:38.680 --> 11:45.200]  and to build a renaissance culture based on a world designed for humans and a world designed
[11:45.200 --> 11:52.400]  on having true environmentalism and defeating globalism that is based on fake environmentalism
[11:52.400 --> 11:59.640]  and eugenics and the Russians and the top intellectuals around the world now understand
[11:59.640 --> 12:05.000]  the true globalist blueprint it's now out there it's now safe to talk about it it's
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.680]  now accepted in intellectual circles and that is the beginning of the end of the eugenics
[12:09.680 --> 12:18.840]  based New World Order that Adolf Alois Hitler was only a small bad son spinoff of our analysis
[12:18.840 --> 12:23.440]  is dead on it's been transmitted the signals already been released you can kill me now
[12:23.440 --> 12:30.440]  you won't stop any of it and I don't want to give myself more than credit I'm due we
[12:30.440 --> 12:36.480]  were the detonators taking information that was in academic circles that the globalist
[12:36.480 --> 12:41.360]  were arrogant about believing the public was too stupid to even read it or care we popularized
[12:41.360 --> 12:47.680]  it and rammed it out there into the open and the people are now learning about the New
[12:47.680 --> 12:51.240]  World Order they're learning about globalism they're learning about its operating system
[12:51.240 --> 12:57.520]  how it takes over countries and then what its end game is and once you find out about
[12:57.520 --> 13:03.120]  the end game you're living in a real science fiction nightmare dystopia that's taking
[13:03.120 --> 13:10.320]  place in the middle of this incredibly exciting wondrous opportunity filled world of wonder
[13:10.320 --> 13:19.840]  so it's a paradox and we're now discovering it's the best of times the worst of times
[13:19.840 --> 13:30.240]  together and that the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray now obviously we have
[13:30.240 --> 13:35.600]  the Russian ambassador killed the Russians have come out the Turks have come out saying
[13:35.600 --> 13:42.360]  this is not state sponsored by them that this is NATO just like World War one trying to
[13:42.360 --> 13:49.760]  kick off a major war another Russian ambassador was assassinated at his home yesterday that
[13:49.760 --> 13:53.880]  may have been they're saying somebody finding somebody in the bed but somebody shouldn't
[13:53.880 --> 13:59.120]  be that's not confirmed that's just what is being said coincidence probably not things
[13:59.120 --> 14:05.280]  happen in politics to quote Edward Mandel house you can bet they were playing that way
[14:05.280 --> 14:14.200]  so there is a lot going on public executions of Russian ambassadors private executions
[14:14.200 --> 14:19.840]  and if you're a TV viewer we just go where the nose where the news is we're not trying
[14:19.840 --> 14:25.160]  to be sensational we're not trying to be shock jocks reality is sensational so maybe once
[14:25.160 --> 14:30.680]  a month you see death and carnage and explosions on the show if you're watching and not a listener
[14:30.680 --> 14:35.960]  but we are showing you the video they've expunged off the web of niece in July where 80 plus
[14:35.960 --> 14:42.000]  people were run over including small children it's nothing compared to the video games like
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.880]  grand theft auto and the rest of it but notice they want you to see simulated violence much
[14:47.880 --> 14:52.280]  more graphically but they don't want you to see a truck from 200 yards away running over
[14:52.280 --> 14:56.960]  people because then it's real and then you might want to do something about it so viewer
[14:56.960 --> 15:02.800]  discretion is advised but notice you can see all the simulated murder and death they can
[15:02.800 --> 15:08.040]  show it to even PG crowds at night at seven o'clock during the dinner hour but they don't
[15:08.040 --> 15:14.720]  want us to show you what Islamic terror is doing all over this world well we're going
[15:14.720 --> 15:23.120]  to show it and if people try to censor it on Facebook or on Google platforms like YouTube
[15:23.120 --> 15:28.840]  that's why people are leaving you in droves and watching the raw feeds at info wars dot
[15:28.840 --> 15:35.480]  com info wars dot com forward slash show so they can see what the establishment doesn't
[15:35.480 --> 15:41.400]  want you to see do we show simulated violence no we don't show it but we show you in documentary
[15:41.400 --> 15:48.120]  format which quite frankly we can even show you on FCC TV stations that we're on and you
[15:48.120 --> 15:55.720]  know how we were able to do that and get around the quote profanity or or or you know violence
[15:55.720 --> 16:01.200]  clauses that are out there you know the indecency clauses because it's documentary format you
[16:01.200 --> 16:05.560]  never watch PBS when you're a kid and there's cuss words and there's blood and there's death
[16:05.560 --> 16:10.480]  and you see executions in you know Vietnam or something for the Vietnam War and you
[16:10.480 --> 16:15.160]  ask how am I seeing this this isn't on regular broadcast TV well how did Walker Cronkite
[16:15.160 --> 16:20.680]  show naked kids running around who've been napalmed with their skin hanging off at six
[16:20.680 --> 16:25.800]  o'clock at night because it's real you're not supposed to show a bunch of simulated
[16:25.800 --> 16:30.920]  murder and death because it makes light of it you're supposed to show the real death so
[16:30.920 --> 16:38.200]  people get sick and don't want it and do something about it everything's asked backwards Walter
[16:38.200 --> 16:43.720]  Cronkite could show you naked little kids running down the street with their skin hanging
[16:43.720 --> 16:53.400]  off their backs and arms burn off like melted wax and it ended the war that we shouldn't
[16:53.400 --> 17:02.880]  have been involved in a big profiteering operation Ho Chi Minh tried to work with the U.S. tried
[17:02.880 --> 17:08.680]  to bring us in he was enemies of the Japanese during World War II he was our ally the globalist
[17:08.680 --> 17:13.200]  didn't want that they wanted a new war to pump hundreds of billions in so LBJ could
[17:13.200 --> 17:18.520]  get rich and others could so you know the rest of history but that itself is side issue
[17:18.520 --> 17:22.360]  just like the El Castro was CIA you tell the average dummy yuppie that they don't even
[17:22.360 --> 17:27.760]  know it he was a communist not CIA really he was installed then he turned against them
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.200]  more blowback or is it really blowback or are the globalist destabilizing companies
[17:32.200 --> 17:38.760]  on purpose that's in the WikiLeaks they put the Arab Spring in on purpose to destroy secularism
[17:38.760 --> 17:43.880]  to destroy industry you know where Europe for 30 years has been vacationing because it's
[17:43.880 --> 17:47.680]  cheap and it's beautiful and it's pristine and it's amazing and there's Roman ruins
[17:47.680 --> 17:57.560]  everywhere let's get this network break this is too important do you know Syria there's
[17:57.560 --> 18:04.120]  no tourism now to Syria almost six years after the West started a civil war there using
[18:04.120 --> 18:10.160]  jihadis to go in and murder Christians and basically anybody else that didn't submit
[18:10.160 --> 18:16.840]  to them and then they have TV movies on Netflix about how great the people are in Aleppo and
[18:16.840 --> 18:22.680]  how they're fighting the evil Assad all made up crap and they have HBO specials about
[18:22.680 --> 18:28.560]  Saddam what a big monster he is and of course the CIA now has to admit oh he actually wasn't
[18:28.560 --> 18:33.840]  for Al Qaeda he fought them when he was interrogated he said I'm CIA why have you done this to me
[18:33.840 --> 18:38.160]  why'd you tell me to attack Iran and then tell me to invade Kuwait and then set me up and
[18:38.160 --> 18:43.360]  do all that they said we're not releasing you we're handing over the Shiites they're
[18:43.360 --> 18:49.960]  gonna hang your ass all that came out this week in the Daily Mail you're not gonna hear
[18:49.960 --> 18:55.040]  about it here in the United States so that's what's going on in this country ladies and
[18:55.040 --> 19:01.160]  gentlemen that's who runs this nation and that's how dumb they think we are but there's
[19:01.160 --> 19:05.440]  a rebellion throughout the government that's why you see a high-level CIA interrogator
[19:05.440 --> 19:09.520]  come out and say he spent weeks with Saddam and the headline is everything we were told
[19:09.520 --> 19:17.880]  about him wasn't true and Bush was dumb Bush wasn't dumb they were getting rid of an old
[19:17.880 --> 19:22.760]  policy from the 50s to put secular governments in the Middle East and try to bring them into
[19:22.760 --> 19:29.680]  the industrialized age that was set up by Eisenhower and by the 80s and the late 80s
[19:29.680 --> 19:39.440]  they decided to reverse that entire program let's not put a Russian headline up they'll
[19:39.440 --> 19:43.960]  say it's propaganda let's put the Daily Mail up or some US papers that had the CIA interrogator
[19:43.960 --> 19:50.120]  breaking it all down of course you all heard that here 20 years ago on this broadcast because
[19:50.120 --> 19:53.800]  none of it was a secret that he was hired when he was an army captain when he was 20
[19:53.800 --> 19:57.720]  something years old and sent to Cairo in the late 50s to be trained for two years by the
[19:57.720 --> 20:04.160]  CIA or that he was wounded trying to assassinate the communist leader then they pressured the
[20:04.160 --> 20:10.120]  bathist in 69 to put him in as the head of security where they keep overthrowing the government
[20:10.120 --> 20:18.080]  later in 1979 they put Saddam into power and then told him to attack and gave him the weather
[20:18.080 --> 20:26.920]  reports and all the systems on how to deliver the mustard gas I'm not lionizing Saddam Hussein
[20:26.920 --> 20:32.120]  just that guy compared to the Saudi Arabians as an angel 60% of the college graduates women
[20:32.120 --> 20:37.200]  nobody wearing burkas rock and roll music on playboy on the store shelves that's what
[20:37.200 --> 20:42.000]  he did in the Middle East so much so that Europeans and Russians were going there right
[20:42.000 --> 20:50.560]  through the 80s the vacation not anymore blew the whole thing up because there's a new policy
[20:50.560 --> 20:58.680]  destabilize destroy overturn countries ruin them and turn them over to the Saudi Arabians
[20:58.680 --> 21:05.160]  that keep giant slave brothels oh but they called them harem so it's cute yeah you get
[21:05.160 --> 21:09.040]  talking to me in a cocktail waitress and Saudi Arabia at some military base or something
[21:09.040 --> 21:12.800]  you get off the base you're never seen again but that's okay because you're a woman and
[21:12.800 --> 21:18.040]  you're not going to hear one word out of Gloria Steinem about it because she's the establishment
[21:18.040 --> 21:21.960]  woman just teaching men and women how to fight with each other and teaching women you can't
[21:21.960 --> 21:28.880]  have a man the states your man I've got articles today about women saying just have an abortion
[21:28.880 --> 21:37.040]  to prove you're a feminist it's so sexy but I digress coming up today this year we've
[21:37.040 --> 21:43.040]  seen multiple truck attacks the guy tried to ram folks in Ohio State and stab nine people
[21:43.040 --> 21:48.920]  but the local trendy said he was black so it was wrong that the white officer shot him
[21:48.920 --> 21:54.440]  even though he was running at him with a butcher knife and of course it was a Christmas party
[21:54.440 --> 21:59.360]  in San Bernardino where he went and killed his co-workers with his wife screaming Allah
[21:59.360 --> 22:08.680]  Akbar but that's okay again because it has nothing to do with Islam it never does we're
[22:08.680 --> 22:14.120]  going to break down the Russians and the holy stabilization program I told you last week
[22:14.120 --> 22:19.160]  look for them to start wars and provocations in Syria I have that from my sources are trying
[22:19.160 --> 22:25.440]  to kick off a major war between Turkey and Syria right now they can then basically call
[22:25.440 --> 22:32.040]  in US forces so that they can start bombing because our military on the ground is refusing
[22:32.040 --> 22:36.520]  to he told you that five years ago came out this year Cyhurst came on the show and said
[22:36.520 --> 22:41.680]  yes it's true what you said four years ago five years ago our military the articles
[22:41.680 --> 22:48.880]  called military to military has refused to back the backing of ISIS slash Al Qaeda for
[22:48.880 --> 22:55.960]  Obama and General Dempsey or the head of the Joint Chiefs went and told Obama that night
[22:55.960 --> 23:00.200]  three plus years ago we're not going to be part of this air campaign the military is
[23:00.200 --> 23:05.480]  going to mutiny what a historical event our military refusing and they continue with Wiki
[23:05.480 --> 23:09.920]  leaks to leak the criminality the Democratic Party and the Republican establishment to
[23:09.920 --> 23:15.720]  expose the activity in an American counter coup against the globalists that have hijacked
[23:15.720 --> 23:21.800]  this nation and the Russians now and the Europeans now all know the real score and they know
[23:21.800 --> 23:26.520]  they're occupied by mega banks and all over the world countries every time they have a
[23:26.520 --> 23:38.560]  vote Italy two weeks ago the UK four months ago the United States five weeks ago Iceland
[23:38.560 --> 23:46.320]  four years ago Catalonia this year everybody's pulling out Brazil's trying to pull out of
[23:46.320 --> 23:50.600]  these big central banks that just make up debt make up money and signed countries on
[23:50.600 --> 23:55.200]  to a billion dollar loan like Nigeria and 40 years later they've paid back a hundred
[23:55.200 --> 24:02.200]  billion plus on one loan that makes loan sharks and payday loan people look like look like
[24:02.200 --> 24:08.640]  anti-usery angels people want prosperity we know in the industrialized age we should be
[24:08.640 --> 24:12.920]  working three days a week and living like kings they were being told the more robots
[24:12.920 --> 24:17.240]  and more automation there is the more we've got to work it's all been actuaried and all
[24:17.240 --> 24:24.880]  set up to make us as poor and stupid as possible and it's called agenda 21 and it's all right
[24:24.880 --> 24:29.680]  there you can't have a car you can't have an air conditioner Obama said as he walked
[24:29.680 --> 24:38.960]  off a jumbo jet and he called the Africans hypocrisy writ large and Mr. Wilders over
[24:38.960 --> 24:46.320]  there a member of the Dutch parliament I had in a lot of the polls and he runs for president
[24:46.320 --> 24:50.560]  panel of three judges ruled the freedom party leaders comments in a post-election speech
[24:50.560 --> 24:56.040]  of 2014 were demeaning and thereby insulting towards Moroccan population when he said
[24:56.040 --> 25:01.080]  we're bringing in these Moroccans and a lot of mccrevenals yeah what they've got court
[25:01.080 --> 25:07.360]  cases going on against Marine Le Pen who's leading a lot of polls for president in France
[25:07.360 --> 25:12.800]  because she said we haven't faced such a threat to our sovereignty since the Nazis in World
[25:12.800 --> 25:22.360]  War two yeah I'd say so Islam conquered Spain Islam sure conquered what's Turkey today Islam
[25:22.360 --> 25:29.000]  went all the way into Poland that's why the Polish and Romanian Hungarian girls got those
[25:29.000 --> 25:36.520]  those those sexy eyes because there was a lot of raping went on and a lot of killing the
[25:36.520 --> 25:42.800]  men got put on slave galleys but again it's fun to get put on a slave galley and and and
[25:42.800 --> 25:48.080]  have everybody killed but the women because it's Islam so it's okay it's okay to have
[25:48.080 --> 25:55.520]  the imams had imam and Israel in Jerusalem and all the other big imams openly I mean
[25:55.520 --> 26:06.420]  it's like a cartoon or anything like rock rock rock like sounds like Klingon rock rock
[26:06.420 --> 26:10.720]  and you like you are weak Americans you are weak Europeans your weather ours we will take
[26:10.720 --> 26:17.260]  But before we kill you first, you pigs, eh.
[26:17.260 --> 26:20.960]  All the weird, trendy liberals, we played the different UN ads, they run in Germany
[26:20.960 --> 26:25.480]  where it shows the German music star dancing around going, I wear the hajib, I love it,
[26:25.480 --> 26:30.200]  you wear it too, we submit, they be nice.
[26:30.200 --> 26:34.080]  You bring in something incompatible to a free society.
[26:34.080 --> 26:40.040]  The bastion of liberty to the West has emancipated the slaves, freed the women, all of it, the
[26:40.040 --> 26:41.040]  West.
[26:41.040 --> 26:47.120]  Demonize it, bring in folks that created the African slave trade, and then get the black
[26:47.120 --> 26:51.120]  folks to all become black Muslims and actually join the group that basically invented the
[26:51.120 --> 26:52.120]  modern slave trade.
[26:52.120 --> 26:54.960]  I mean, that's genius, isn't it?
[26:54.960 --> 26:57.480]  And then when you don't want to embrace that, they call you anti-Islam.
[26:57.480 --> 27:02.560]  Well, I'm anti-Nazi, I think the Nazi culture was bad, I'm anti-Aztec where they would
[27:02.560 --> 27:05.480]  sacrifice people every single day and cut their hearts out.
[27:05.480 --> 27:11.760]  Oh, it's just a culture, well, then the Nazis are just a culture, no, it's not just a culture.
[27:11.760 --> 27:15.360]  Oh, was Genghis Khan just a culture where they'd ride through and murder everyone but
[27:15.360 --> 27:20.560]  again the women and just come through your town and kill everybody and stick you on poles
[27:20.560 --> 27:25.360]  and slit your throat and drag you behind their chariots or drag you behind their horses?
[27:25.360 --> 27:29.720]  Oh, it's just a culture, it's just a culture.
[27:29.720 --> 27:34.400]  No one should have any culture, just give up your culture.
[27:34.400 --> 27:40.080]  Use the Muslims how it is, hundreds of thousands of Muslims killed every year by Muslims.
[27:40.080 --> 27:46.200]  I want to reform Islam like we reformed Christianity.
[27:46.200 --> 27:48.840]  Christianity did a lot of barbarous things in the name of Christianity.
[27:48.840 --> 27:51.520]  Let's just admit the inquisitions weren't good.
[27:51.520 --> 27:55.240]  Let's just admit if people didn't convert to Christianity in some parts of the world,
[27:55.240 --> 27:56.800]  people were put to the sword.
[27:56.800 --> 28:00.800]  Islam's way worse than that, completely out of control and everyone's supposed to tip
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.560]  toe around it and kiss its big fat stinking butt and then everything's going to be okay.
[28:05.560 --> 28:07.880]  It's not going to be okay.
[28:07.880 --> 28:14.680]  Here, put it behind me, the truck of peace that has nothing to do with Islam, running
[28:14.680 --> 28:20.320]  over people and if you talk about it, they have the former Stasi hired, you can't make
[28:20.320 --> 28:25.280]  that up in Germany to kick you off Facebook or fine or fee you and the police come to
[28:25.280 --> 28:26.360]  your house.
[28:26.360 --> 28:30.240]  And then from Sweden to Germany to the Netherlands, the police are told make it up when women
[28:30.240 --> 28:36.920]  get raped in mass and say Swedes or Dutch or Germans did it and they actually get caught
[28:36.920 --> 28:40.800]  doing it.
[28:40.800 --> 28:48.640]  All this middle patient cuckolding, this middle patient, Harry Carey commit suicide as a culture.
[28:48.640 --> 28:55.120]  This death wish, this weird sniveling, let's kill ourselves culture.
[28:55.120 --> 28:59.320]  Let's hate ourselves culture and the weird socialists left us in competition with the
[28:59.320 --> 29:04.120]  West and the engine of liberty and the engine of prosperity, pissed that collectivism can't
[29:04.120 --> 29:09.640]  compete with it, so collectivism is now hijacked it, milking it and then wants to gut the engine
[29:09.640 --> 29:14.160]  of freedom because they feel so weak next to it.
[29:14.160 --> 29:18.400]  Imagine the globalists and the socialists have got the whole West, it's theirs now.
[29:18.400 --> 29:23.280]  They want to gut it, burn it to the ground and then bring in a bunch of third world cavemen
[29:23.280 --> 29:28.160]  that keep women with chains and wear hoods over their heads in like freaking space aliens
[29:28.160 --> 29:32.880]  or something to conquer us and then just run around pissing all over everything in some
[29:32.880 --> 29:38.600]  giant territory marking event.
[29:38.600 --> 29:44.160]  I mean, whoa, what a group of freaks, what a group of middle patients who again, mommy
[29:44.160 --> 29:47.400]  and daddy gave them everything, they're the most spoiled people on earth, the modern
[29:47.400 --> 29:51.400]  trending and they just want to blow everything up and crap all over it as soon as possible.
[29:51.400 --> 29:59.360]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[29:59.360 --> 30:04.560]  Look at this nonsense from Darlene Superville of the Associated Press, headline reads, Trump
[30:04.560 --> 30:08.960]  blames terrorists for killing in Turkey, Trump on Monday experienced what life will be like
[30:08.960 --> 30:13.040]  as president as he condemned separate deadly incidents against a Russian diplomat and
[30:13.040 --> 30:18.120]  shoppers at a German Christmas market, blaming Islamic terrorism in both instances, finally
[30:18.120 --> 30:20.080]  a president who calls it like it is.
[30:20.080 --> 30:24.840]  But wait, that's not how Darlene feels, she says he offered no support for his claims
[30:24.840 --> 30:28.680]  that terrorists were responsible for the carnage.
[30:28.680 --> 30:30.920]  What world are you living in Darlene?
[30:30.920 --> 30:35.880]  The shooter literally said Allahu Akbar and said he did this for Jihad and what other
[30:35.880 --> 30:40.000]  incidents do we know of where crowds of people are run over by a truck?
[30:40.000 --> 30:45.080]  If 120 people were in a burning building and Trump saved 119 of them, Darlene would write
[30:45.080 --> 30:47.760]  a story saying Trump kills one in structure fire.
[30:47.760 --> 30:51.640]  This is just like when they scolded Trump for referencing a bomb in New York back in
[30:51.640 --> 30:52.640]  September.
[30:52.640 --> 30:54.760]  Well, he was right then and he is right now.

[33:21.920 --> 33:40.880]  This is Alex Jones.
[33:40.880 --> 33:48.840]  We got advice here doing a documentary on HBO and he's one of their only libertarian
[33:48.840 --> 33:52.120]  producers, seems like a pretty fair fella, and he was saying during the break he goes
[33:52.120 --> 33:53.960]  why destabilize the Middle East?
[33:53.960 --> 34:00.000]  Well Wesley Clark about six, seven years ago came out and there's two different interviews.
[34:00.000 --> 34:03.040]  One was about eight years ago and one was about seven years ago.
[34:03.040 --> 34:04.540]  Two different TV interviews.
[34:04.540 --> 34:08.560]  We've played it probably 500 times I'm seriously but I guess we could play it again and he
[34:08.560 --> 34:17.080]  says listen I was at the Pentagon shortly after I left in 2001 and they had all these
[34:17.080 --> 34:21.200]  battle plans on the wall, the next seven countries in the Middle East and North Africa to take
[34:21.200 --> 34:28.020]  out and the plan was to use basically the jihadis to do it and then to come in and then
[34:28.020 --> 34:32.960]  clean it up later if that ever was even done and the plan is population reduction, population
[34:32.960 --> 34:38.200]  control and so we are doing horrible things to the people in the Middle East.
[34:38.200 --> 34:39.200]  Let's be clear.
[34:39.200 --> 34:42.080]  People say well you're against wars, you know you say you don't want to invade the Middle
[34:42.080 --> 34:45.600]  East and you say that all the Muslims aren't bad but then you're demonizing Islam, Alex
[34:45.600 --> 34:46.600]  what's the point?
[34:46.600 --> 34:48.240]  It's more sophisticated than that.
[34:48.240 --> 34:52.240]  Why do you think Hamid Ghul before he died, the former head of Pakistani intelligence,
[34:52.240 --> 34:56.960]  the guy that basically defeated the Russians in Afghanistan in the 80s was Reagan?
[34:56.960 --> 35:00.200]  Why do you think he would come on the show even though I was critical of a lot of Islam?
[35:00.200 --> 35:03.520]  Because he knew that I was actually covering the fact that the Islamic countries are being
[35:03.520 --> 35:09.120]  set up for destruction long term but the West is being set up for destruction as well as
[35:09.120 --> 35:11.960]  the globalist play us off against each other.
[35:11.960 --> 35:17.360]  You bring them in, they attack, they kill, then the media says and the government says
[35:17.360 --> 35:23.000]  we've got to conform and not stir up Islam, we've got to pass anti free speech laws so
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.400]  you don't cause them to attack us.
[35:25.400 --> 35:27.560]  They call it incitement.
[35:27.560 --> 35:34.960]  Well how did they convict Gert Wilders, member of parliament, way up in the polls, could
[35:34.960 --> 35:37.800]  end up being their new leader?
[35:37.800 --> 35:41.800]  They say he's inciting, he's being mean racially and they're saying the same thing
[35:41.800 --> 35:46.200]  here now that they're telling German women, don't wear short skirts, you've got to conform
[35:46.200 --> 35:48.000]  to Islam now.
[35:48.000 --> 35:53.040]  They're installing mayors and major leaders of German cities, the Secretary of State of
[35:53.040 --> 35:58.440]  the State of Berlin, that's how German is, it's little states, not counties.
[35:58.440 --> 36:04.200]  She is a woman who doesn't wear a hajib or a burqa but she says women should and gets
[36:04.200 --> 36:10.560]  up on TV and calls for Sharia law in Germany and again one of the few things I was wrong
[36:10.560 --> 36:14.920]  about is 10 years ago I'd hear all this talk about a new caliphate, a new Sharia law take
[36:14.920 --> 36:16.720]  over and I'd roll my eyes.
[36:16.720 --> 36:20.520]  I'd say you right-wingers, you are really pushing garbage, there's no way the liberal
[36:20.520 --> 36:25.040]  west will bring all this in and let these people actually dictate to us but we don't
[36:25.040 --> 36:31.160]  need to be in the Middle East stirring it all up and throwing out Saddam to put Wahhabist
[36:31.160 --> 36:35.200]  in control when it's Saudi Arabia that was clearly more involved than 9-11 than anybody
[36:35.200 --> 36:39.280]  else and Saddam's their enemy.
[36:39.280 --> 36:47.920]  And look where we are now, so it's a serious situation when the ambassador to Turkey gets
[36:47.920 --> 36:53.880]  killed from Russia, another ambassador, another diplomat gets killed in Moscow, Putin's best
[36:53.880 --> 36:59.480]  buddy and driver gets killed in a CIA style yet or they ran into him with a big truck,
[36:59.480 --> 37:08.680]  it's a favorite way to get you, a reinforced truck, you've got all of this happening, you've
[37:08.680 --> 37:14.400]  got all of this unfolding and clearly this was all a highly scripted prepared event,
[37:14.400 --> 37:16.320]  the killing was real.
[37:16.320 --> 37:19.720]  Notice the art that's hanging right behind him when he gets killed at this government-sponsored
[37:19.720 --> 37:26.760]  art show, it's a cannon pointed right at you, it's a message to everybody, this is a message
[37:26.760 --> 37:32.120]  to Russia, we can script anything we want, we will kill you in front of everybody, that
[37:32.120 --> 37:39.000]  is a direct message like wrapping two fish in a body armor of Luka Bratsi and the godfather,
[37:39.000 --> 37:45.400]  sleeps with the fishes, it's like telling everybody there'll be no autopsy when it's
[37:45.400 --> 37:50.720]  first announced that Scalia died a few hours ago and then having him be part of some secret
[37:50.720 --> 37:53.960]  society meeting and telling you he was part of it and then saying he was found with a
[37:53.960 --> 38:00.920]  pillow on his face, that was a message, you get in line, other Supreme Court justices
[38:00.920 --> 38:07.160]  are your dead, by the way I have that from Supreme Court justices, that I'm absolutely
[38:07.160 --> 38:15.880]  right about the death threats, but see the whole takeover failed, didn't it and now who
[38:15.880 --> 38:20.280]  gets to talk to the president, who gets to talk to the Supreme Court justices, Matt
[38:20.280 --> 38:29.720]  Drudge, Alex Jones and it totally is pissing them off 30 days out, they will do anything
[38:29.720 --> 38:37.680]  including starting wars, assassinating Trump, you name it, they will do anything they can
[38:37.680 --> 38:41.760]  because I don't get up here and brag about the fact that we've now become the talking
[38:41.760 --> 38:47.080]  points memo for the intelligence agencies, for the military, for the president-elect
[38:47.080 --> 38:54.240]  and it's not because we just made all this up and they hear it and then believe it, they
[38:54.240 --> 39:01.880]  already know this and more, they just can't release classified information so they say
[39:01.880 --> 39:08.840]  listen to Alex Jones, he knows what's going on and I'm not given classified information
[39:08.840 --> 39:13.160]  most of the time over the years, certainly not from the sources I just mentioned, I
[39:13.160 --> 39:19.000]  already know how it works, I've reverse engineered the whole thing and we've got a better handle
[39:19.000 --> 39:24.960]  on how this works than pretty much anybody who's public, are there analysts that know
[39:24.960 --> 39:29.080]  more than I do, absolutely, are there all sorts of people smarter than I'm, yes but
[39:29.080 --> 39:34.000]  nobody went and built a media operation to talk about it, so I want listeners to understand
[39:34.000 --> 39:39.640]  you're not getting my opinion here, you're not getting speculation 95% of the time, when
[39:39.640 --> 39:47.940]  I'm speculating I'm very clear about the fact that we're speculating and I make a demarcation
[39:47.940 --> 39:53.800]  line on that fact, but are jihadis stabbing and shooting and murdering and attacking
[39:53.800 --> 39:58.440]  military bases and attacking Christmas parties and attacking Army Navy Marine Corps recruiting
[39:58.440 --> 40:04.720]  centers and attacking public schools and colleges and police officers, none of us even know
[40:04.720 --> 40:09.760]  the names of the record number of cops killed the last year, it's not a butt-kissing operation
[40:09.760 --> 40:14.400]  of the police but that's my front line, that's my country, whether my country is perfect
[40:14.400 --> 40:19.600]  or not, outside globalist forces that overthrew Ukraine with anti-police riots three years
[40:19.600 --> 40:25.400]  ago are trying to cause an anti-police riot in this country as a grassroots revolution
[40:25.400 --> 40:33.040]  to destabilize local government so there can be a federal emergency, but the whole Soros
[40:33.040 --> 40:37.520]  operation that worked in the Middle East that worked in Eastern Europe isn't working here
[40:37.520 --> 40:45.280]  because we knew what your plan was and they've been exposing it before you ever did it here,
[40:45.280 --> 40:51.000]  we know you run the same type of operations, we know who you are, we're watching you and
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.640]  you say well we're watching you and we'll get you, we already know that dumbass, fill
[40:55.640 --> 41:03.080]  your hand, I love how they threaten us all the time, behind the scenes, officially threatening
[41:03.080 --> 41:08.480]  us, demonizing, saying one more thing, one more thing Jones, one more time, back off,
[41:08.480 --> 41:14.920]  back off, back off, I already know your killers, I already know your scum, that's why I'm fighting
[41:14.920 --> 41:20.680]  you and risking my life, because you death threat me, because you attack me, because
[41:20.680 --> 41:25.680]  you demonize this country and try to destroy it and hurt poor people, you're in a death
[41:25.680 --> 41:34.600]  battle now, you're in a death battle new world order, we know, you're in one with us, comprender,
[41:34.600 --> 41:42.120]  comprehend it, you're in a death battle, we don't care what you say, what you do, how
[41:42.120 --> 41:48.160]  you lie, what wars you start, we're coming for you, because you won't get off of us,
[41:48.160 --> 41:54.440]  you're sitting on our chest suffocating us and we are flailing instinctively, we're
[41:54.440 --> 41:59.800]  rising, we're getting you off our back right now, we've just pulled you off our back, we've
[41:59.800 --> 42:03.760]  got you in our hands, you're snapping, you're clawing, you're biting, you're trying to get
[42:03.760 --> 42:08.920]  loose and we're just flipping the switch going, we're never turning loose, we're never turning
[42:08.920 --> 42:14.720]  loose and inexorably, inexorably politically, we're not looking for vengeance, but politically
[42:14.720 --> 42:22.360]  you feel our hands now, as you claw and as our arms bleed, just wrap our hands around
[42:22.360 --> 42:34.280]  your evil, crooked, stinking, wart-covered, scruffulous, dripping neck and you can feel
[42:34.280 --> 42:41.720]  it, don't you, the oxygen leaving your brain, the panic as we bear down on you, for America,
[42:41.720 --> 42:47.080]  for the children, for innocence, you feel it, don't you, you wanted to dominate us, now
[42:47.080 --> 42:54.480]  you get destroyed, it doesn't matter what happens to the missiles that slam into your
[42:54.480 --> 43:03.640]  ass, I'm a weapon, I'm made to be thrown at you, if I make it through this, I'll just
[43:03.640 --> 43:12.080]  be old and die, an old man's death in my sleep, why not die the real fight with a sword in
[43:12.080 --> 43:16.720]  my hand while I'm still young and strong, selfish pardon me doesn't want that, I don't
[43:16.720 --> 43:21.160]  have any death wish, I want to live forever, if I ever supposedly commit suicide you know
[43:21.160 --> 43:27.800]  it's a lie, but I'm not afraid, I've stepped into destiny against you and so is the rest
[43:27.800 --> 43:33.360]  of humanity now, stepping into destiny, now let me get into the news and a bunch of clips
[43:33.360 --> 43:37.920]  because Roger Stone has been working, I'm talking 20 hours a day finishing this big
[43:37.920 --> 43:41.120]  book, he was going to be on today, he's under the weather, I'm going to try to get him on
[43:41.120 --> 43:45.360]  tomorrow, but we do have some other guests joining us, today I'll tell you about coming
[43:45.360 --> 43:51.160]  up in the next segment, but let me just go ahead and start breaking down the news here,
[43:51.160 --> 43:55.120]  we just saw an exercise in media control, they use these events as a laboratory as a
[43:55.120 --> 44:01.760]  test case on how to first say it was a driverless car or no one was seen in it or we don't know
[44:01.760 --> 44:06.280]  who did it or maybe it was an accident, but now they would do that before for days or
[44:06.280 --> 44:10.040]  even weeks, Shane Shamburn and I know it wasn't a terror attack, then the FBI came out and
[44:10.040 --> 44:13.040]  they were ordered to lie about it, they were also ordered to stand down and not go after
[44:13.040 --> 44:21.480]  the guy, imagine being at a Christmas party with your fellow office folks, some are atheists,
[44:21.480 --> 44:27.040]  some are Christians, some are Jews and the Islamists admittedly sought out the folks
[44:27.040 --> 44:32.520]  they killed, Shamburn and Nino at the office party at the health department, Jews and Christians
[44:32.520 --> 44:38.240]  and they killed them and they said it's not a racial component to Islam, but we're always
[44:38.240 --> 44:45.800]  continuing to see that there is an anti-Jew anti-Christian sentiment and it's all the
[44:45.800 --> 44:50.520]  big cause celeb in the leftist movement to be anti-Semitic, I just see Israel as a very
[44:50.520 --> 44:57.240]  diverse group and don't sit there and put labels on it, but again all the race baiting,
[44:57.240 --> 45:02.280]  all the race pushing by the left is really sick folks and it's everything they claim
[45:02.280 --> 45:10.000]  they're trying to fight back against, that's what's so disgusting about it, but meanwhile
[45:10.000 --> 45:18.440]  we have this horrific event taking place in Berlin with 12 people dead, I want to play
[45:18.440 --> 45:24.600]  a report by Paul Joseph Watson that's up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com that needs
[45:24.600 --> 45:29.760]  to go viral, Russian ambassador shot dead what they're not telling you, that's coming
[45:29.760 --> 45:34.200]  up later in the broadcast, we're going to air the truth about Berlin Christmas market
[45:34.200 --> 45:36.960]  attack.
[45:36.960 --> 45:41.640]  Now we now have the media coming out saying it's the fault of right wingers, they weren't
[45:41.640 --> 45:47.000]  inclusive enough of Islam and that's why this happened, here's the report.
[45:47.000 --> 45:51.960]  How many trucks need to be plowed through innocent people before we acknowledge that
[45:51.960 --> 45:58.000]  Islam is not a religion of peace, but this is just a truck crash say CNN, not an attack
[45:58.000 --> 46:04.000]  and definitely nothing to do with Islam, while according to the BBC, a lorry was to blame
[46:04.000 --> 46:09.240]  for the attack, give me a break, how many terror attacks do we need to see in Germany
[46:09.240 --> 46:15.520]  before Angela Merkel reverses her disastrous open door migrant policy, this wasn't hard
[46:15.520 --> 46:20.680]  to predict, I said nearly a month ago that Christmas markets in Europe would be attacked,
[46:20.680 --> 46:26.080]  this is an attack on Christianity itself, so what's Germany going to do about it?
[46:26.080 --> 46:32.520]  When trucks erect barriers around everything, how about not importing terrorists, just last
[46:32.520 --> 46:38.160]  week a 12 year old ISIS supporting boy tried to bomb a Christmas market in Germany, Germany
[46:38.160 --> 46:44.040]  suffered Islamic terror attacks throughout the summer, all this after around 1.5 million
[46:44.040 --> 46:50.760]  almost entirely Muslim migrants arrived in the country, is that just a coincidence, multiculturalism
[46:50.760 --> 46:56.840]  has clearly failed and now poses a direct threat to the German people, but for the past 18
[46:56.840 --> 47:11.600]  months, the German government has been brainwashing its people to accept multiculturalism.
[47:11.600 --> 47:17.240]  While Christmas songs at Christmas markets in Germany broadcast live on television, get
[47:17.240 --> 47:30.920]  Islamic makeovers, but in advance of next year's election, Angela Merkel still enjoys
[47:30.920 --> 47:37.200]  support from the majority of the German people, despite her saying there will be no cap on
[47:37.200 --> 47:42.880]  Muslim refugees flooding into the country, 402,000 extra crimes committed by migrants
[47:42.880 --> 47:49.640]  since last year, mass molestations of women, rapes and murders occurring on a regular basis.
[47:49.640 --> 47:54.320]  Multiculturalism has clearly failed, but the majority of Germans still have their heads
[47:54.320 --> 47:59.560]  stuck in the sand, what's it going to take, how many innocent men, women and children
[47:59.560 --> 48:05.040]  need to be slaughtered in the streets before we address the root cause, you're not going
[48:05.040 --> 48:12.800]  to prevent this by banning the burqa, stop importing terrorists, that's how you prevent
[48:12.800 --> 48:19.240]  it, stop importing an ideology that ghettoizes and then becomes a wellspring for other terrorists.
[48:19.240 --> 48:23.520]  We condemn the attacks in Ankara, Berlin and Zurich, however we also condemn the Islamophobia
[48:23.520 --> 48:26.520]  it brings along, terrorism has no religion.
[48:26.520 --> 48:31.560]  That's what I'm talking about, that attitude is why Germany is in serious trouble, the
[48:31.560 --> 48:38.800]  main suspect in the attack is either from Pakistan or Afghanistan, Pakistan is 98%
[48:38.800 --> 48:46.280]  Muslim, Afghanistan is 99% Muslim, some kind of connection there, can't quite put my finger
[48:46.280 --> 48:52.280]  on it, you're not going to stop this by waffling on about Islamophobia, blaming a truck or
[48:52.280 --> 48:57.600]  any other kind of Stockholm syndrome, ostrich behavior, you're going to stop it by not
[48:57.600 --> 49:03.640]  importing a terrorist ideology and if Angela Merkel refuses to do that, then she needs to
[49:03.640 --> 49:11.280]  resign now and step aside for somebody who will.
[49:11.280 --> 49:16.880]  That powerful report is on infowars.com, I'm going to retweet that right now, another
[49:16.880 --> 49:21.400]  one of those reports coming up that's just as informative, for those that don't know,
[49:21.400 --> 49:26.560]  they don't allow you in at least 13 Islamic countries to be anything but a Muslim if
[49:26.560 --> 49:29.280]  you live there, okay?
[49:29.280 --> 49:36.720]  So it's the most backwards, intolerant garbage in the world except for North Korea, where
[49:36.720 --> 49:41.240]  they keep most humans as basically like barnyard animals, but it's okay because it has democratic
[49:41.240 --> 49:46.120]  in its name and it's real liberal and they've got all these weird restaurants all over where
[49:46.120 --> 49:51.520]  liberals go and celebrate Mao and all this crap, I mean people are freaks man, your parents
[49:51.520 --> 49:56.400]  spoiled you so bad that you want to just overturn it all, you're wanting somebody to set you
[49:56.400 --> 49:58.040]  straight, it's like criminology.
[49:58.040 --> 50:02.960]  When psychopaths get away with killing, they start getting sloppier and sloppier and sending
[50:02.960 --> 50:06.880]  notes to the cops and trying to get caught, well the average trendy in this spoiled rotten
[50:06.880 --> 50:13.080]  country is just begging reality to slap them upside the face as they beg to overturn the
[50:13.080 --> 50:17.720]  First Amendment, as they beg to overturn the alt-right media, as they openly call, I played
[50:17.720 --> 50:23.760]  this last week on every major network on cable, even Fox calls for shutting me up and then
[50:23.760 --> 50:29.080]  play edited tapes of stuff out of context, I'm like Hillary's behind the mass murder
[50:29.080 --> 50:32.760]  personally under logs when she orders it, murder of Christians and raping and killing
[50:32.760 --> 50:38.760]  of kids in Syria, they cut the Syria off and cut the saying she's murdering people in a
[50:38.760 --> 50:44.960]  pizza place, I mean this is how they deceive people and it's why they don't have any support,
[50:44.960 --> 50:49.560]  so good luck banning, it's good luck trying to shut us down, now I want to get more into
[50:49.560 --> 50:54.640]  this when we come back, also what's happening in Turkey and Syria, because in the next thirty
[50:54.640 --> 50:59.840]  days Obama's going to try to start a big war with Russia, stay with us.

[52:27.640 --> 52:33.760]  this is not dinner table conversation but here goes anyway, one world way solved my irregularity,
[52:33.760 --> 52:37.400]  I've been plagued with constipation for years and I thought it would be that way for the
[52:37.400 --> 52:42.880]  rest of my life, three weeks on one world way set me on a new path, that was five months
[52:42.880 --> 52:47.640]  ago and I haven't been irregular since, will it work the same way for you, I don't know,
[52:47.640 --> 52:48.640]  it worked for me.

[53:57.080 --> 54:04.320]  You know, I was just thinking, we normally have a Christmas tree in studio just to be
[54:04.320 --> 54:09.200]  politically incorrect because we live in such a free country that the bizarre, fake fascist
[54:09.200 --> 54:14.400]  left, the opposite of real liberals, are trying to bully people and not even say happy holidays
[54:14.400 --> 54:16.160]  now, they're saying that can be offensive.
[54:16.160 --> 54:20.600]  How about you trying to restrict my free speeches offensive and try to tell kids all over the
[54:20.600 --> 54:23.120]  country don't hand out Christmas cards at school.
[54:23.120 --> 54:26.280]  You can do whatever you want, we're not supposed to have a state-sponsored religion, which
[54:26.280 --> 54:28.840]  I'm all for.
[54:28.840 --> 54:31.880]  That's what Thomas Jefferson talked about.
[54:31.880 --> 54:37.200]  There shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof.
[54:37.200 --> 54:38.680]  That's how the first one begins.
[54:38.680 --> 54:44.680]  Well, Islam wants to come in and impose its Sharia law, which is the opposite of the Constitution.
[54:44.680 --> 54:48.640]  And I know Muslims were brought up in this and it's your heritage and you love it and
[54:48.640 --> 54:50.080]  everything, here's the deal.
[54:50.080 --> 54:54.880]  I'm not going to submit to the will of the Saudi Arabian version of Islam.
[54:54.880 --> 54:57.000]  It ain't going to happen.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  I don't move to Saudi Arabia.
[54:59.000 --> 55:03.480]  If you're going to move here, you understand, you're not going to make me adopted.
[55:03.480 --> 55:05.320]  It's not happening over my dead body.
[55:05.320 --> 55:06.320]  And I get it.
[55:06.320 --> 55:07.320]  That's the idea.
[55:07.320 --> 55:08.320]  Like, well, then we're going to kill you.
[55:08.320 --> 55:09.320]  I understand.
[55:09.320 --> 55:10.560]  I know, you're the best.
[55:10.560 --> 55:13.920]  You're going to conquest me and stop killing each other all day then.
[55:13.920 --> 55:16.120]  What's your problem?
[55:16.120 --> 55:22.680]  But you think about Christmas and a bunch of French out at their national holiday, therefore
[55:22.680 --> 55:27.800]  of the July, they get run over, they get killed.
[55:27.800 --> 55:31.120]  Four kids running, mommy being run over, they're being run over.
[55:31.120 --> 55:32.120]  It's all for the Jihad.
[55:32.120 --> 55:33.760]  The media tries to cover it up.
[55:33.760 --> 55:37.840]  Now a bunch of people killed in Germany at a Christmas event, ran over a bunch of Christmas
[55:37.840 --> 55:42.060]  trees, plowed over a bunch of people because the Christmas carols and the Christianity
[55:42.060 --> 55:51.600]  and the music mixed with the Germanic cannon bomb, just they couldn't handle it.
[55:51.600 --> 55:54.920]  And now the cover up ensues.
[55:54.920 --> 55:59.800]  Yes, let's play this clip of the religion of peace executing the Russian ambassador
[55:59.800 --> 56:03.240]  yesterday and screaming Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar.
[56:03.240 --> 56:04.240]  Here it is.
[56:04.240 --> 56:31.360]  Again, let's play that one more time, there's some jitters in that video, but let's play
[56:31.360 --> 56:42.360]  it with audio.
[56:42.360 --> 56:47.080]  Is that us as we read download that or is that only original video that jitters, people
[56:47.080 --> 56:52.360]  think I'm editing it, the original video, well I'd be jittery too if somebody was shooting
[56:52.360 --> 56:53.360]  at me.
[56:53.360 --> 56:57.280]  So this is what's going on and this is a religion where people are just happy to just
[56:57.280 --> 57:01.200]  run around and just shoot people on TV, do whatever, because it's honored, it's like
[57:01.200 --> 57:03.320]  a rock star.
[57:03.320 --> 57:06.360]  You know Obama obviously, the Saudi Arabia has given chemical weapons a few years ago
[57:06.360 --> 57:11.600]  to the jihadis to attack and blame Assad, but they couldn't help it.
[57:11.600 --> 57:18.440]  They wanted to scream Allah Akbar and show themselves launching the big chemical attacks
[57:18.440 --> 57:23.760]  via mortars and so that's why it didn't work and even the UN had to admit that the jihadis
[57:23.760 --> 57:29.840]  launched the chemical attack, not Assad, so see this is how you're like winning the Oscar
[57:29.840 --> 57:34.240]  is killing somebody live on TV, this is the culture of lunaticness.
[57:34.240 --> 57:37.920]  Before I go any further, since last Friday we've had massive denial of service, bought
[57:37.920 --> 57:42.720]  attacks, they didn't get into the servers, the servers are safe, they're fine, they're
[57:42.720 --> 57:43.720]  good.
[57:43.720 --> 57:47.360]  We've got the same folks that do the servers for Mastercard and Visa, but they were able
[57:47.360 --> 57:51.080]  to shut down Info Wars again last night for a few hours, they tried to shut the shopping
[57:51.080 --> 57:55.840]  cart in for a store down, but despite that people have supported us, taken advantage
[57:55.840 --> 58:01.000]  of the free shipping, taken advantage of the 50% off, colloidal silver, 33% off brain force,
[58:01.000 --> 58:06.040]  that's the big huge special right now, not 20% more in the Neutropic bottle when you
[58:06.040 --> 58:08.040]  order it.
[58:08.040 --> 58:12.640]  Other great products like vitamin B12 of the organic type, methylcobalamin, massively
[58:12.640 --> 58:18.400]  absorbable under the tongue, folks are into drugs, I don't know why, I'm into supplements.
[58:18.400 --> 58:22.480]  Still supplements are game changing and amazing, so I've got so much energy, huge specials
[58:22.480 --> 58:29.640]  running right now, InfoWarsLife.com is the supplement page, InfoWarsStore.com is the
[58:29.640 --> 58:33.720]  umbrella site, I want to thank you all for your support, you can still order today and
[58:33.720 --> 58:38.200]  get it before Christmas in the lower 48, we'll be back for the second hour, we'll tell you
[58:38.200 --> 58:39.760]  about the guests that are coming up, stay with us.
[58:39.760 --> 58:49.200]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.200 --> 58:55.040]  Introducing vitamin mineral fusion from InfoWarsLife.com, we have worked for years with our chemists
[58:55.040 --> 58:59.480]  and scientists to create the most powerful and affordable, great tasting multivitamin
[58:59.480 --> 59:05.600]  formula available, the all new vitamin mineral fusion drink mix at InfoWarsLife.com is loaded
[59:05.600 --> 59:11.400]  with a full month supply of essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids that your body absolutely
[59:11.400 --> 59:12.400]  needs.
[59:12.400 --> 59:16.640]  In the history of InfoWarsLife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival
[59:16.640 --> 59:22.240]  Shield X2, Super Metal Vitality and so many others, but I am most proud of the product
[59:22.240 --> 59:26.880]  we're now launching today, with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing
[59:26.880 --> 59:29.720]  process designed for maximized effects.
[59:29.720 --> 59:34.880]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products, the ingredients
[59:34.880 --> 59:41.280]  in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[59:41.280 --> 59:46.800]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure, at InfoWarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion.
[59:46.800 --> 59:51.680]  Take action now before we sell out.
[59:51.680 --> 1:00:13.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:13.360 --> 1:00:37.560]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:37.560 --> 1:00:46.360]  Your leftist brainwashing, this German arena barana music would be called Nazi or it would
[1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:53.680]  be called cultural expropriation.
[1:00:53.680 --> 1:00:59.400]  Everything's a thought crime, every word, every new vocabulary they give you will then
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:04.520]  be made obsolete within the month or within the year so that they can sit in the place
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:08.800]  of arbitrating what words can be used, what culture can be adopted.
[1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:14.120]  That's why it starts with something simple like don't call us homosexual, that scientific
[1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:19.000]  term like heterosexual hurts us, call it straight, call it gay.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:23.160]  You go okay, I want to be nice, you're gay, you're happy, you can expropriate words now
[1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:30.520]  and basically without even going to court just change scientific terms.
[1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:35.280]  And then now, don't say you have a mother and father, some people don't have that.
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:38.560]  Don't say brown paper bag, that hurts people's feelings, that's racist.
[1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:44.280]  No one ever said it was racist but we say it is so you can't use that term now.
[1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:48.440]  And by the way, don't say this is an Islamic attack, that only encourages more of the attacks.
[1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:52.200]  We're going to arrest you if you say this was Islam.
[1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:54.880]  We've hired former Stasi to do it.
[1:01:54.880 --> 1:02:01.320]  I mean, it's like they think the public has collective amnesia, it's our job to expose
[1:02:01.320 --> 1:02:10.200]  the fact that this is a cult, multiculturalism is about bringing in all these other people
[1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:14.760]  who are just people, they act just like people, act like white people, act like black people,
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:15.760]  humans act the same.
[1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:21.000]  Then they program the minorities to be race based.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:25.640]  It's incredible, absolutely amazing.
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:30.400]  Now we're going to, after the break, get some guests on the broadcast.
[1:02:30.400 --> 1:02:34.680]  We have quite a few today, Gerald Salente is coming up at the bottom of the hour to give
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:39.160]  us his breakdown of what we've seen in the year past and what's coming up in the future.
[1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:42.480]  We've got Roger Stone popping in, he's decided to rally and come on for about 10 minutes
[1:02:42.480 --> 1:02:46.920]  even though he's got a cold or is under the weather from not sleeping as much as he should.
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:51.040]  He's been working this book, he's been working 18 to 20 hours a day in the last few weeks.
[1:02:51.040 --> 1:03:01.160]  And then we've got Paul Joseph Watson scheduled to be hosting the fourth hour today from London,
[1:03:01.160 --> 1:03:02.160]  England.
[1:03:02.160 --> 1:03:06.640]  He's got some guests joining him as well, so you don't want to miss all of the rest of
[1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:10.680]  the three hours that are laid out before us.
[1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:16.280]  Now I need to take a breath there and just sit back and think about what we've just witnessed.
[1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:27.640]  I have really not spent any time so far talking about the fact that we have seen Donald J.
[1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:34.880]  Trump come from way behind to get the nomination, despite the fact they tried to steal that
[1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:40.660]  outrageously, to becoming president-elect and then now the last five weeks of total
[1:03:40.660 --> 1:03:45.200]  hysteria trying to stop that and trying to have recounts that only got him more votes
[1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:51.680]  and trying to then launch wars and other diversions and trying to say there's a terror attack
[1:03:51.680 --> 1:04:02.560]  at his fault and then saying that again the electors shouldn't go for him.
[1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:10.440]  Despite all that he got what, 303 electors of the 270 needed and they had a bunch of
[1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:13.080]  electors actually go against Hillary.
[1:04:13.080 --> 1:04:18.360]  More electors went against Hillary, even though no one promoted that, than went against Trump
[1:04:18.360 --> 1:04:26.040]  so it actually backfired in another incredibly repudiating reversal and just showing people
[1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:29.040]  don't want her.
[1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:32.600]  And I'm glad it was Bernie Sanders people that realized they stole the nomination from
[1:04:32.600 --> 1:04:39.000]  him that said you know what, we're going to be faithless for you because you were faithless
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.240]  and stole this.
[1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:46.000]  We lost four in Washington state alone.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:49.120]  So that's all coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:53.640]  We've got video and audio of them getting hysterical and crying and screaming when they're, when
[1:04:53.640 --> 1:04:59.160]  they're goddess, the arrogant, stumbling tyrant failed.
[1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:03.040]  Facebook, Twitter and Google have now been sued by families of the victims of the Orlando
[1:05:03.040 --> 1:05:04.280]  nightclub shootings.
[1:05:04.280 --> 1:05:08.360]  The families of three victims are teaming up and suing the platforms for allegedly providing
[1:05:08.360 --> 1:05:10.640]  material support to the Islamic state.
[1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:14.960]  We have been reporting on ISIS or radical Islam's use of these social network platforms
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:19.080]  to recruit and spread its propaganda, mostly in the light of the hypocritical sense that
[1:05:19.080 --> 1:05:23.320]  you can be centered on Facebook or Twitter for being a conservative, sharing infowars
[1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:26.600]  links, speaking bad about Obama or being a Trump supporter.
[1:05:26.600 --> 1:05:31.440]  But somehow, magically, radical Islamic terror groups have managed to continue their usage
[1:05:31.440 --> 1:05:32.800]  of these platforms.
[1:05:32.800 --> 1:05:37.040]  But perhaps now for these double standard hypocritical companies, the chickens are coming
[1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:42.160]  home to roost, as the lawsuit is now making its way to a federal court in eastern Michigan.
[1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:44.560]  This isn't the first time these companies have been sued.
[1:05:44.560 --> 1:05:48.640]  In June, the family of a victim of the Paris attacks sued Facebook, Twitter and Google
[1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:53.440]  for the same reason, allowing a terrorist group to radicalize people on their platform
[1:05:53.440 --> 1:05:55.840]  who eventually carry out deadly attacks.
[1:05:55.840 --> 1:05:59.200]  This is Owen Troyer for Infowars.com.

[1:08:24.440 --> 1:08:33.320]  Now, everybody knows that I'm obsessed with how the global social engineers are able to
[1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:35.880]  set the parameters and label things.
[1:08:35.880 --> 1:08:39.680]  They call themselves progressives, they call themselves liberals.
[1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:45.020]  Then when they're in opposition to what libertarians and patriots want, they say, oh, you're right
[1:08:45.020 --> 1:08:51.320]  wing extremist, and then they couple everybody else onto the horrible agenda being carried
[1:08:51.320 --> 1:08:55.800]  out by the fake establishment, blue blood, robber baron republicans.
[1:08:55.800 --> 1:09:02.840]  But then in real policy, the democrats and republicans carry out the globalism, carry
[1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:09.040]  out the modern imperialism, carry out the modern oppression, and then respectively point fingers
[1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:11.440]  at each other and say everybody does it.
[1:09:11.440 --> 1:09:16.780]  Well, Carol Quigley wrote Tragedy and Hope in the 60s for the CIA because their own section
[1:09:16.780 --> 1:09:23.600]  chiefs couldn't understand why they were funding communist, socialist, and fascist as well
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:27.920]  as just run-of-the-mill dictators instead of promoting liberty.
[1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:32.360]  They were changing over from the Eisenhower policy of trying to put good governments
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:38.320]  in, which is bad enough because you see where it goes, to putting bad governments in.
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:42.720]  And Quigley in the book, which we sell by the way in hardcover, it's back in print,
[1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:47.800]  1,100 pages, wasn't meant for the general public, there were lawsuits over it, but because
[1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:51.960]  the government paid for it, it went into open domain.
[1:09:51.960 --> 1:09:56.280]  When first only a few copies were out there that got leaked, they tried to deny it was
[1:09:56.280 --> 1:10:03.600]  real in the early 70s, folks, there was a whole controversy over this book, 1,100 pages,
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:11.400]  you read it, it's a blueprint, a owner's manual, an operator's manual on how to run full-spectrum
[1:10:11.400 --> 1:10:17.720]  political dominance, but at the end, it's all command and control, and it's anti-free
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:22.640]  market and wants monopolies, oligopolies, Brzezinski's written books that are public
[1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:28.040]  admitting it all as well, but those are public.
[1:10:28.040 --> 1:10:32.840]  And so that's why they're bringing in Islam because it's not compatible.
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:38.360]  And so the leftist who hate the states and who hate the electoral college and who, you
[1:10:38.360 --> 1:10:43.320]  know, all this other garbage, suddenly love it and love the states and said be faithless
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:44.320]  electors.
[1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:53.600]  Well, Hillary Clinton lost more electors than Trump did, in fact, I did the math yesterday.
[1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:57.160]  The issue was, even in states where people are allowed to be faithless, they just ignored
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:02.920]  them, arrested them, drug them out, you name it, imagine if Trump people did that.
[1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:09.280]  Turns out, I counted these up last night, Hillary lost more than 30 electors.
[1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:13.840]  Trump just lost a few, incredible.
[1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:17.520]  So Hillary lost four in Washington.
[1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:21.600]  The reason that's so important, that's where the four stuck.
[1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:23.320]  They went to Bernie Sanders.
[1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:27.120]  In other places, they just ignored it and it was not even in the news or it was mentioned.
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:31.720]  Well, this group of seven or this group of four or this group of 10 or this group of
[1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:37.040]  two tried to vote against, but weren't allowed, the police took them out.
[1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:43.080]  So I sat there before I shot a live video on Facebook last night and I tally him up.
[1:11:43.080 --> 1:11:45.960]  So there's also mainstream news articles that also admitted it.
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:51.600]  They're like, yeah, Hillary was rebuffed or Hillary lost more than Trump.
[1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:55.320]  So imagine they're advertising, they're writing thousands of letters to each elector who's
[1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:56.320]  Republican.
[1:11:56.320 --> 1:12:00.840]  They're doing, they have Hollywood stars saying, do this, do this, do this, do this.
[1:12:00.840 --> 1:12:07.360]  And they get rebuked because Hillary, Joe Biden had to go out on the trail and say,
[1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:13.680]  I know you don't like Hillary, I know you like Sanders, but man, Donald Trump's evil
[1:12:13.680 --> 1:12:19.600]  and record numbers of Reagan Democrats, black and white and Hispanic, those type of folks
[1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:25.240]  went and they voted for Trump, the same people that voted for Obama hoping for change.
[1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:30.360]  And if Trump doesn't deliver or die trying, he'll be more hated than Obama because people
[1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:33.000]  weren't sure, but gave Obama a chance.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:38.120]  I didn't like McCain myself, so I was like, I'm pretty much neutral, except McCain claims
[1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:41.440]  he's less anti-gun, so I got to go McCain, but I didn't vote for him.
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:43.760]  I just said, we're gonna see what happens.
[1:12:43.760 --> 1:12:45.880]  And boy, Obama was worse than I thought.
[1:12:45.880 --> 1:12:52.120]  I hated the Republicans so much that one of the few times I was wrong in my life, I didn't
[1:12:52.120 --> 1:12:53.120]  support McCain.
[1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:54.720]  And of course he was meant to lose.
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:59.440]  So it was like a Don King boxing match, they say, you know, reportedly, allegedly, sometimes,
[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:01.840]  you know, both boxers kind of know what's going on.
[1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:02.840]  Who knows?
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:04.720]  The point is, in that case, we knew the fix was in.
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:07.840]  So I said, hey, the fix is in, it doesn't matter, he's the new Messiah, we'll see what
[1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:08.840]  happens.
[1:13:08.840 --> 1:13:11.280]  But boy, the racial division, all of it.
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:19.240]  So you've got these whining babies in Wisconsin, wailing and freaking out.
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:21.240]  Here it is.
[1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:24.720]  Thank you tellers for telling the votes.
[1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:26.880]  The votes are 10 votes.
[1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:28.880]  Donald J. Trump.
[1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:58.320]  www.Google.com
[1:13:58.320 --> 1:14:10.120]  don't do this. This is begging for Hillary. This is begging for Hillary. Who launches
[1:14:10.120 --> 1:14:14.440]  all these wars, steals the donation money from the Haitians, is involved in all this
[1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:24.480]  corruption. And they're saying shame, shame, shame, shame on you. And then they go on and
[1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:31.120]  choose the electors also for Mr. Pence. Now, Vice President Pence, elect, but about to
[1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:35.480]  be president in 30 days. You think these desperate people are going to stop? Now, notice they
[1:14:35.480 --> 1:14:45.880]  blamed the racist and they blamed the homophobes. Now, your Russian agents, if you support Trump,
[1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:50.240]  you want World War III, even though most analysts and historians on the left and right say,
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:55.600]  no, no, Hillary would push us towards World War III. Trump's a businessman. He wants to
[1:14:55.600 --> 1:15:00.760]  win-win. He doesn't want austerity. He doesn't want eugenics. He doesn't want World War III.
[1:15:00.760 --> 1:15:05.360]  That's what the whole Devo system is. They're ultra-rich. You're poor. They end competition.
[1:15:05.360 --> 1:15:12.000]  They sew up the whole world. They're diplomatically immune above the law tax exempt. Globalism
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:17.440]  is the new royalty and you only operate through license, through licensure to them and administrative
[1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:22.960]  law. That's what the world government is. Read the white papers. And because I have
[1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:28.480]  read their white papers, I've been contacted and I've been offered jobs with them. How's
[1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:35.120]  3 million sound? How's 10 million sound? And I even had Rothkoff, head of the Kissinger
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:39.800]  Group at the time, come on the show. He knew who I was and John Herman heard during the
[1:15:39.800 --> 1:15:43.520]  breaks. He all said on air, Alex, come to New York, meet with us. You're the leader of
[1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:46.760]  your group. You're going to be the leader of the opposition. Just work with us. It's
[1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:52.280]  a good plan. World government's good. Alex, come on. I just had to get out of here. You're
[1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:57.160]  just not sensible. They just have this confidence that if we're the good guys, we run things
[1:15:57.160 --> 1:16:02.600]  we're taking over. You said it on air. You said it off air. Yeah, there's a world government.
[1:16:02.600 --> 1:16:09.320]  Join it, Alex. And I've had people bigger than Rothkoff. And I wear a journalistic hat,
[1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:15.040]  so I'm in a meeting with somebody. It's off record unless they talk about criminal stuff.
[1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:18.720]  And they just say, Alex, the public's a bunch of dumb scum. They don't want your help. They're
[1:16:18.720 --> 1:16:24.120]  going to adapt to be slaves, not the other way around. They're going to tear you apart.
[1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:27.800]  You just need to join us. And I say, why are you saying I should join you? Well, you get
[1:16:27.800 --> 1:16:33.440]  it. You read our documents. You care. You understand the plan. You should join us. And I'm up bragging
[1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:37.440]  that you can see their forethought that they were trying to hire me. And I'm sure they
[1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:44.440]  hire a lot of folks that they see as up-and-comers. 19 years ago, the offer started. Smoking
[1:16:44.440 --> 1:16:49.080]  small networks, big networks, the biggest networks, then other deals, TV deals, movie
[1:16:49.080 --> 1:16:53.640]  deals. And they look at me and they go, you don't want $10 million book deals, the best
[1:16:53.640 --> 1:16:59.600]  looking women, and movie deals. Guaranteed movie deals. You're going to be a movie star.
[1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:06.920]  You got the talent. You got it all. No, I don't want it. Alex, $10 million is more than I
[1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:10.400]  make. Now I got a bunch of stuff. This is a conversation with presidents of things. You
[1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:16.920]  don't want $10 million. No, I don't want $10 million. But see, the general public hasn't
[1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:22.400]  experienced these things. They don't know, but they're now learning via the WikiLeaks.
[1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:28.440]  Now let me continue. Let's go to this next one. Liberal losers who, again, aren't liberals
[1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:35.480]  cry and complain. We just played that. Clinton supporters, racism, Russia, why we lost CNN.
[1:17:35.480 --> 1:17:41.880]  So it's this compilation of Russia, racist, homophobes, everything but them, everything
[1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:45.480]  but Hillary being a crook, everything that we're sick of the Clinton name, everything
[1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:52.160]  that we want change. That's why the same white Midwest elected Obama, who you now call racist,
[1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:53.480]  it's made up crap.
[1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:58.120]  And then we come back. I'm going to tell you about the real discussions going on in white
[1:17:58.120 --> 1:18:02.440]  America. I'm going to let you in on the real secret what's going on in white America. You
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:08.560]  going to hear it on the other side? But first, let's go out to the break. Let's clip.
[1:18:08.560 --> 1:18:19.200]  As the weeks went by, that deep sense of sadness and loss gave way to a tremendous, tremendous
[1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:25.400]  anger as we realized from all the news is coming out that this election was stolen
[1:18:25.400 --> 1:18:27.440]  from the American people by Russia.
[1:18:27.440 --> 1:18:30.280]  What evidence do you have that Russia stole the election?
[1:18:30.280 --> 1:18:36.040]  There was information from the CIA saying that Russia was meddling in the election.
[1:18:36.040 --> 1:18:37.040]  We're saying one of them got Congress.
[1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:39.920]  But what evidence do you have that it swayed the outcome?
[1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:44.760]  The hacking that the Russian government did of the DNC emails provided.
[1:18:44.760 --> 1:18:49.880]  They used the term hack to mean political hack influence in the media. Okay, that's,
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:53.720]  it's all been disproven. The head of all intelligence has come out and said it's all
[1:18:53.720 --> 1:18:57.840]  bull. But the Chinese and the Saudi Arabians were openly involved bragging about it. And
[1:18:57.840 --> 1:19:02.520]  look how helpless these women look. You think folks like this built this country? They've
[1:19:02.520 --> 1:19:08.160]  created these soft bureaucrat types that are in law all in. Here they are.
[1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:14.920]  That the Russian government did of the DNC emails provided an endless supply of negative
[1:19:14.920 --> 1:19:17.520]  commentary in the news about Hillary.
[1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:24.320]  How many people think that Russia swayed the outcome of this race? Had it not been for
[1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:27.720]  Russia, Hillary Clinton would have won.
[1:19:27.720 --> 1:19:32.720]  You know what, we're going to come back and play the rest. Folks, this is so ass of mine.
[1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:38.440]  The entire mainstream media admitted they had no qualms about lying about Trump. Totally
[1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:45.480]  negative deception, coordinating with the wine house, coordinating with everybody. And then
[1:19:45.480 --> 1:19:50.560]  they changed the subject off the WikiLeaks to claiming Russia did it with no evidence.
[1:19:50.560 --> 1:19:56.600]  I mean, it is just ridiculous. You didn't vote against Hillary. No, the Russians mind
[1:19:56.600 --> 1:19:59.800]  controlled you.
[1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:03.920]  Winter has just begun and are you already tired of being cold? How would you like to

[1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:12.760]  When I ran out, I decided to try other brands.
[1:22:12.760 --> 1:22:15.760]  I spent eight months and could not find a replacement.
[1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:21.400]  I went through tons of brands, types and flavors and almost all of them tasted unnatural and
[1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:22.400]  not pleasant.
[1:22:22.400 --> 1:22:26.320]  When it all boiled down, I came right back to One World Way.
[1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:32.000]  I buy the cost effective five pound container and my family craves their One World Way too.
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:37.640]  I look forward to and enjoy having my One World Way and feel great after I drink it.

[1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:45.360]  entire month.
[1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:47.480]  Online at PowerPrepper.com.
[1:23:47.480 --> 1:23:49.680]  That's PowerPrepper.com.
[1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:50.680]  Experience the new manna difference.
[1:23:50.680 --> 1:24:03.480]  American man, food storage, I love to eat, yum!
[1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:09.480]  Thirty days from now on Friday, January 20th, 2016, the 45th president of the United States
[1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:14.800]  will be sworn in and inaugurated and if you don't think they're going to not cause riots
[1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:18.240]  and all sorts of attacks, I think you're living on another planet.
[1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:20.840]  I should open the phones up and ask callers.
[1:24:20.840 --> 1:24:24.600]  I always love to crowdsource your views, it's always amazing.
[1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:26.200]  On how do you think they're going to try to disrupt it now?
[1:24:26.200 --> 1:24:31.680]  They failed in stealing the nomination, they failed trying to steal the general election,
[1:24:31.680 --> 1:24:35.160]  they failed with their fake recounts, they gave more votes to the Trump, they failed with
[1:24:35.160 --> 1:24:39.560]  the unseeding of the electors.
[1:24:39.560 --> 1:24:45.840]  Some say there could still be some manipulation up until the 6th or so when they're announced,
[1:24:45.840 --> 1:24:49.080]  but there could be something happening in Congress, but I don't really see that happening
[1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:50.080]  now.
[1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:55.480]  I told you they were going to try them, but now I feel better about the process, like
[1:24:55.480 --> 1:25:00.440]  we've gotten out of the woods, but I feel like something's over the hill.
[1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:01.440]  What do you think?
[1:25:01.440 --> 1:25:05.000]  In fact, I'm going to open the phones up to take calls on this subject when Salente joins.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:11.320]  It's just to pop in with your quick comment, 800-25 at 99-231, 800-25 at 99-231.
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:20.640]  Now, I got cut off getting into the butt-hurtness of the liberals in a focus group on CNN, while
[1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:24.120]  these focus groups have turned out to be fake with Democratic operatives, but it's all these
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:27.160]  women that are just shocked the Russians took over.
[1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:34.320]  It's all been discredited, it's all bull, but it changes the subject from the WikiLeaks.
[1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:36.960]  It's so ridiculous.
[1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:42.040]  Talk about a conspiracy theory, it was U.S. intelligence linked the information.
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:47.400]  It was U.S. intelligence linked up with the Russians and gave intel on helping kill ISIS.
[1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:54.120]  Our military told Obama three-plus years ago, it stops now, and I told you that was historical.
[1:25:54.120 --> 1:25:56.320]  There's already been a soft coup against the globalist.
[1:25:56.320 --> 1:25:58.480]  The globalist took over the country through fraud.
[1:25:58.480 --> 1:26:06.160]  There was a soft coup because the Internet News, not just us, was able to get the information
[1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:08.200]  into the troops.
[1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:12.720]  Pat Riley was on a plane yesterday, back from taking some time off with his wife in Sedona,
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:18.400]  Arizona, and as they landed, the news was coming out that there had been this latest
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:25.040]  truck attack in Berlin, killing a bunch of people, it's now 12 people, more in critical
[1:26:25.040 --> 1:26:29.600]  condition, 60-plus injured, and he started watching people sitting beside him in front
[1:26:29.600 --> 1:26:30.600]  of him.
[1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:34.240]  Clearly, a military guy went to info wars, it wasn't updated yet, 30 minutes after,
[1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:40.160]  and then he watched the guy go to drudge, and then he's walking down the hall, he watches
[1:26:40.160 --> 1:26:45.680]  somebody go to Fox, it's not there, he watches them go to info wars, and then he watches
[1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:46.680]  them go to drudge.
[1:26:46.680 --> 1:26:52.400]  I mean, there it is, right there, of course, drudge had it within two minutes.
[1:26:52.400 --> 1:27:03.240]  I was sitting there shooting a video at home, and already on the niche situation, and part
[1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:07.440]  two, what happened in Berlin, and then the news came in that he got in the 270.
[1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:13.720]  Sure enough, I went to drudge, and drudge had it, and I called up the great crew, that's
[1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:18.200]  why we need a few more staff, and said, hey, post this article, it's kind of that in-between
[1:27:18.200 --> 1:27:22.520]  time at like five o'clock, or so is when people are going off to shift, and there's not really
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:26.760]  anybody at night who's on, unless this crew just decides to work 18 hours a day, I need
[1:27:26.760 --> 1:27:30.800]  four or five more writers, more posters, more analysts, I need more camera people, I need
[1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:31.800]  it now.
[1:27:31.800 --> 1:27:35.200]  That's why we have free shipping, sure why, to try to get enough volume to pay the bills
[1:27:35.200 --> 1:27:36.200]  around here.
[1:27:36.200 --> 1:27:39.600]  People respond to discounts, the products are already discounted generally, but we lower
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:44.320]  the prices, like 33% off on brain force, 20% more now on each bottle, that's basically
[1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:45.320]  a lost leader.
[1:27:45.320 --> 1:27:50.040]  50% off on colloidal silver, 9.95 right now, and free shipping, sign up for auto-ship the
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:55.080]  additional 10% off, we're extending it throughout the week, we try to make back the capital,
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:59.280]  we were budgeting on being able to hire the new crew in the new year, and be able to expand,
[1:27:59.280 --> 1:28:05.920]  and listeners have made up most of the shortfall from the hackers blocking out, and blacking
[1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:13.200]  out infowars.com, infowarsstore.com, again, the sites weren't hacked in the traditional
[1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:18.640]  sense of gotten into, they were just blocked with massive denial of service attacks, DDoS
[1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:22.880]  attacks, robot attacks, and so now they're back up for now, thank you for your support
[1:28:22.880 --> 1:28:26.120]  if you were unable to order, or there's more products you want to get, or you want to support
[1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:36.520]  the first amendment, infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or always you can call toll-free, 247-888-2533-139.
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:44.640]  Let's go out to break the rest of the CNN disinformation network with these poor Democrat
[1:28:44.640 --> 1:28:47.640]  voters.
[1:28:47.640 --> 1:28:53.640]  The hacking that the Russian government did of the DNC emails provided an endless supply
[1:28:53.640 --> 1:28:57.660]  of negative commentary in the news about Hillary.
[1:28:57.660 --> 1:29:05.280]  How many people think that Russia swayed the outcome of this race had it not been for Russia,
[1:29:05.280 --> 1:29:08.120]  Hillary Clinton would have won?
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:09.120]  You agree with that?
[1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:10.120]  I don't know.
[1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:12.240]  Well, we don't know yet.
[1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:18.200]  But for months and months and months, all of the American voters were swayed by what
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:20.760]  they heard and saw in the news.
[1:29:20.760 --> 1:29:24.960]  The other thing I thought was a big factor is the fake news on Facebook.
[1:29:24.960 --> 1:29:28.600]  Well, which, what fake news story cost her the election?
[1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:32.800]  The fake news and the Russia stuff were very connected because a lot of the fake news came
[1:29:32.800 --> 1:29:35.480]  out of people's interpretation of the leaks.
[1:29:35.480 --> 1:29:41.400]  A lot of the late deciding voters broke for Trump and the Comey email.
[1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:44.560]  It sort of seemed to line up in terms of timing with the Comey email.
[1:29:44.560 --> 1:29:49.000]  What I don't hear you saying is putting in a responsibility on her campaign.
[1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  What percentage?
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:51.560]  We're in the vampires on the run.
[1:29:51.560 --> 1:29:52.560]  They'll be back.
[1:29:52.560 --> 1:29:55.400]  Alex Jones at LJC radio network.
[1:29:55.400 --> 1:30:03.080]  Facebook, Twitter and Google have now been sued by families of the victims of the Orlando
[1:30:03.080 --> 1:30:04.360]  nightclub shootings.
[1:30:04.360 --> 1:30:08.400]  The families of three victims are teaming up and suing the platforms for allegedly providing
[1:30:08.400 --> 1:30:10.720]  material support to the Islamic State.
[1:30:10.720 --> 1:30:15.040]  We have been reporting on ISIS or radical Islam's use of these social network platforms
[1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:19.120]  to recruit and spread its propaganda, mostly in the light of the hypocritical sense that
[1:30:19.120 --> 1:30:21.160]  that you can be centered on Facebook or Twitter
[1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:23.800]  for being a conservative, sharing infowars links,
[1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:26.560]  speaking bad about Obama, or being a Trump supporter.
[1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:29.840]  But somehow, magically, radical Islamic terror groups
[1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:32.780]  have managed to continue their usage of these platforms.
[1:30:32.780 --> 1:30:34.860]  But perhaps now, for these double standard
[1:30:34.860 --> 1:30:38.120]  hypocritical companies, the chickens are coming home to roost,
[1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:40.040]  as the lawsuit is now making its way
[1:30:40.040 --> 1:30:42.160]  to a federal court in eastern Michigan.
[1:30:42.160 --> 1:30:44.560]  This isn't the first time these companies have been sued.
[1:30:44.560 --> 1:30:47.240]  In June, the family of a victim of the Paris attacks
[1:30:47.240 --> 1:30:49.880]  sued Facebook, Twitter, and Google for the same reason,
[1:30:49.880 --> 1:30:52.520]  allowing a terrorist group to radicalize people
[1:30:52.520 --> 1:30:55.800]  on their platform, who eventually carry out deadly attacks.
[1:30:55.800 --> 1:30:58.840]  This is Owen Troyer for infowars.com.
[1:30:58.840 --> 1:30:59.640]  Hey, everyone.
[1:30:59.640 --> 1:31:01.960]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[1:31:01.960 --> 1:31:03.680]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[1:31:03.680 --> 1:31:05.800]  to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[1:31:05.800 --> 1:31:07.840]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:09.800]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care,
[1:31:09.800 --> 1:31:13.560]  nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country,
[1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:15.800]  obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease,
[1:31:15.800 --> 1:31:18.000]  and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:19.440]  One out of three or four people is
[1:31:19.440 --> 1:31:20.920]  dealing with some kind of health challenge,
[1:31:20.920 --> 1:31:22.840]  and everyone knows at least one person
[1:31:22.840 --> 1:31:24.560]  with a degenerative disease.
[1:31:24.560 --> 1:31:26.120]  If you're dealing with a health challenge,
[1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:27.760]  or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor
[1:31:27.760 --> 1:31:30.600]  and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way
[1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:32.640]  to incorporate nutritional raw materials
[1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:35.000]  into your day-to-day lives to guarantee
[1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.520]  that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90
[1:31:37.520 --> 1:31:40.080]  essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids
[1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:41.880]  that needs to do its healing work,
[1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:45.320]  you need to check out infowarsteam.com.
[1:31:45.320 --> 1:31:47.320]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.
[1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:49.760]  Head over to infowarsteam.com.
[1:31:49.760 --> 1:31:51.560]  Your body will be very grateful.
[1:31:51.560 --> 1:31:54.640]  On the web at infowarsteam.com.
[1:31:54.640 --> 1:31:58.560]  That's infowarsteam.com.
[1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:01.400]  We have the new product at infowarslife.com,
[1:32:01.400 --> 1:32:03.040]  BioTrue Selenium.
[1:32:03.040 --> 1:32:06.120]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium.
[1:32:06.120 --> 1:32:08.640]  And just recently, we were able to source
[1:32:08.640 --> 1:32:12.560]  a certified organic bioavailable selenium
[1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:14.160]  from Mustard Seed Extract.
[1:32:14.160 --> 1:32:16.000]  When you take selenium in the body,
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:18.520]  it actually benefits the detoxification systems
[1:32:18.520 --> 1:32:19.200]  in your body.
[1:32:19.200 --> 1:32:21.720]  It helps balance the thyroid gland.
[1:32:21.720 --> 1:32:23.400]  It helps detoxify.
[1:32:23.400 --> 1:32:26.320]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:28.360]  The highest concentration of selenium
[1:32:28.360 --> 1:32:30.120]  is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually
[1:32:30.120 --> 1:32:31.160]  used all over the body.
[1:32:31.160 --> 1:32:34.360]  As a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body
[1:32:34.360 --> 1:32:37.360]  that are directly dependent upon selenium.
[1:32:37.360 --> 1:32:41.160]  So it really is a all-around nutrient
[1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:42.760]  that everybody really needs.
[1:32:42.760 --> 1:32:44.440]  I'm taking it now every day.
[1:32:44.440 --> 1:32:45.360]  This is so key.
[1:32:45.360 --> 1:32:48.800]  BioTrue Selenium is the product, the best selenium
[1:32:48.800 --> 1:32:49.720]  that we could bring you.
[1:32:49.720 --> 1:32:51.920]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price.
[1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:54.440]  Exclusively available at infowarslife.com
[1:32:54.440 --> 1:32:57.040]  or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three,
[1:32:57.040 --> 1:32:59.760]  one-three-nine.
[1:32:59.760 --> 1:33:06.880]  I've got a tiger in my tail that's playing the scene.
[1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:10.800]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[1:33:10.800 --> 1:33:13.040]  He never gives up.
[1:33:13.040 --> 1:33:16.400]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep
[1:33:16.400 --> 1:33:21.400]  in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[1:33:21.400 --> 1:33:23.880]  Well, I thought today I met you.
[1:33:23.880 --> 1:33:31.200]  You were me as a lamb, just to kind of fit my dream plan.
[1:33:31.200 --> 1:33:35.640]  Monday through Friday from 11 AM, 3 PM central, we're here.
[1:33:35.640 --> 1:33:38.680]  And I've got to just settle down because this type of news
[1:33:38.680 --> 1:33:40.280]  drives me crazy.
[1:33:40.280 --> 1:33:43.440]  To witness niece this summer, to witness
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:47.440]  Berlin as an 18-wheeler runs over men, women, and children,
[1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:49.520]  and to watch the media be apologists
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:52.120]  and to cover up for orthodox Islam,
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:56.000]  and to know they knew bringing in millions of military age
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:59.920]  men from war-torn areas where their cult is so out of control,
[1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:03.360]  they're constantly all killing each other.
[1:34:03.360 --> 1:34:05.520]  I mean, I don't want to be in a Jim Jones cult.
[1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:07.240]  I don't want to be in the Islamic cult.
[1:34:07.240 --> 1:34:10.400]  I don't want to go to Arkansas with snake handlers
[1:34:10.400 --> 1:34:11.720]  and roll around either.
[1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:13.880]  I mean, I just don't like cults.
[1:34:13.880 --> 1:34:17.080]  And I know a cult when I'm looking at one.
[1:34:17.080 --> 1:34:21.840]  And the brand of Islam coming out of Saudi Arabia's rear end
[1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:24.880]  that's sprayed all over Europe and the rest of the world
[1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:27.400]  is a cult.
[1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:30.320]  The only other freakier, weirder one is North Korea.
[1:34:30.320 --> 1:34:33.680]  And I've decided which one's worse, quite frankly.
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:34.960]  And I can make that judgment.
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:38.280]  North Korea is frickin' crazy.
[1:34:38.280 --> 1:34:41.560]  A hereditary dictator that executes family members
[1:34:41.560 --> 1:34:45.360]  with mortar fire, with three days of screaming and crying
[1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:48.280]  and worshiping him when he walks around or his dad dies.
[1:34:48.280 --> 1:34:50.920]  I mean, the only time I see this is when Hillary lost.
[1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:51.920]  It was the same.
[1:34:51.920 --> 1:34:57.360]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
[1:34:57.360 --> 1:34:58.600]  Trump's going to cut our taxes.
[1:34:58.600 --> 1:35:01.600]  Ah, ah, ah, he's going to murder the gay people.
[1:35:01.600 --> 1:35:03.520]  And the right wing was like, oh, this is wonderful.
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:04.520]  We're going to vote for Trump.
[1:35:04.520 --> 1:35:06.560]  Ah, he's got rainbow flags at the convention.
[1:35:06.560 --> 1:35:08.080]  Nobody's ever done that.
[1:35:08.080 --> 1:35:10.120]  He's saying up there, be nice to all the gay people.
[1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:12.320]  Now some of the right wing's like, he's not anti-gay.
[1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:13.120]  What are we going to do?
[1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:14.000]  He lied to us.
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.320]  He never said that.
[1:35:16.320 --> 1:35:18.920]  I mean, I love how the right wing was buying all the left wing's
[1:35:18.920 --> 1:35:20.600]  lies, too, about Trump.
[1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:23.120]  And then the left spinster goes, oh, he conjures.
[1:35:23.120 --> 1:35:24.840]  See, he made you think he was right wing.
[1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:26.160]  No, he didn't.
[1:35:26.160 --> 1:35:29.880]  He's nationalistic.
[1:35:29.880 --> 1:35:33.720]  He's kind of strong manny.
[1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:37.280]  But compared to globalists trying to destroy the country,
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:40.400]  I'll take Trump any day.
[1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:41.800]  I mean, he does radical stuff like those
[1:35:41.800 --> 1:35:43.320]  and gives speeches by Christmas trees
[1:35:43.320 --> 1:35:44.520]  and says, Merry Christmas.
[1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:46.200]  What type of culture we in more of the president
[1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:47.200]  can't say Merry Christmas?
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:50.280]  And the media's like, boy, that was extreme.
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:53.400]  What next?
[1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:55.880]  Carol Salente joins us until the end of the hour.
[1:35:55.880 --> 1:35:58.040]  Then we have Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL expert
[1:35:58.040 --> 1:36:01.200]  on the jihad attack and the Tet 2 soft offensive
[1:36:01.200 --> 1:36:02.960]  by Islam we're seeing.
[1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:05.240]  Obviously, we're going to talk about the cold-blooded
[1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:07.200]  execution of the Russian ambassador to Turkey,
[1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:10.320]  which Russia says is a false flag.
[1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:11.800]  Here it is.
[1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:13.120]  Ambassador assassination.
[1:36:13.120 --> 1:36:14.840]  Russian officials blame NATO.
[1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:17.320]  Turks blame Gulan.
[1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:20.440]  Russian MP blames NATO conspiracy for killing of ambassador
[1:36:20.440 --> 1:36:21.280]  in Turkey.
[1:36:21.280 --> 1:36:22.240]  That's out of the independent.
[1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:24.360]  Yeah, it calls it a false flag.
[1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:26.360]  Both of those terms are now in the vernacular
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:28.120]  in the nomenclature.
[1:36:28.120 --> 1:36:29.680]  Putin, Russian ambassador to murder,
[1:36:29.680 --> 1:36:32.080]  aimed at undermining Syria, peace process.
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:33.960]  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[1:36:33.960 --> 1:36:36.280]  Russian officials, highly likely ambassador,
[1:36:36.280 --> 1:36:38.560]  assassination of NATO, false flag.
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:39.720]  That's infowars.com.
[1:36:39.720 --> 1:36:43.640]  We actually get what the Russians said.
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:46.160]  Continuing, Russian diplomat found
[1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:48.200]  dead from a gunshot wound at home just hours
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:53.000]  after ambassador killed at art exhibition.
[1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:54.560]  And Obama said, we will counter Russia
[1:36:54.560 --> 1:36:56.600]  at the time of our choosing.
[1:36:56.600 --> 1:36:57.800]  That's what you're seeing.
[1:36:57.800 --> 1:36:59.920]  A lot of Russian intelligence operas,
[1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:03.360]  including the head of intelligence, has been killed.
[1:37:03.360 --> 1:37:05.000]  They're really trying to start a war with Russia.
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:07.920]  Now, good way to do that, start killing Putin's drivers,
[1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:10.520]  start killing the ambassadors, start killing members of the media,
[1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:11.600]  then blame it on Putin.
[1:37:11.600 --> 1:37:13.240]  Not saying Putin's an angel by any means,
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:15.800]  but he's not expanding.
[1:37:15.800 --> 1:37:19.280]  He's trying to stabilize Russia, which they don't like.
[1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:20.560]  They were strong like China.
[1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:23.360]  They'd be bullying us like they're doing.
[1:37:23.360 --> 1:37:26.160]  So that's some of what we've got to break down.
[1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:27.440]  There is so much to go over.
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:29.560]  Gerald Salentes, one of the top trends forecasters
[1:37:29.560 --> 1:37:32.200]  in the world, best-selling author,
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:33.520]  one of my favorite guys to interview,
[1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:35.400]  and one of the audience's favorite guest.
[1:37:35.400 --> 1:37:37.160]  I appreciate him coming on on short notice today.
[1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:38.680]  I just wanted to get him to respond
[1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:41.240]  to all those trendsresearch.com.
[1:37:41.240 --> 1:37:43.720]  Gerald, I gotta say, you look very, very sharp today.
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:47.360]  You always look sharp, but I really, really, really like that style.
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:49.520]  You're kicking today, my friend.
[1:37:49.520 --> 1:37:50.760]  Where would you like to begin?
[1:37:50.760 --> 1:37:54.000]  I mean, what we're seeing with Trump being seated,
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.160]  if they're this desperate, where are they going?
[1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:59.760]  The ambassadorship, the latest jihad attack?
[1:38:01.640 --> 1:38:03.800]  Here's what I like to start.
[1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:06.200]  I like to start with Bill Clinton yesterday.
[1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:13.280]  Trump knows how to get angry white men to vote for him.
[1:38:13.280 --> 1:38:14.920]  I guess maybe he said that, you know,
[1:38:14.920 --> 1:38:17.640]  Bill Clinton's smoke, but he didn't inhale.
[1:38:17.640 --> 1:38:22.640]  Maybe he inhaled because this is from the trends journal,
[1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:26.720]  The Current Issue, when we reviewed the election.
[1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:34.480]  Trump received about the same number of white male votes
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:39.240]  as did Mitt Romney in 2012.
[1:38:39.240 --> 1:38:43.840]  So Bill, that's why you got the name Slick Willy,
[1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:47.080]  because you and the rest of the prostitute media
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:49.520]  are putting out this lie.
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:51.000]  Here are the facts.
[1:38:51.000 --> 1:38:55.280]  They're all outlined in the trends journal, which you have.
[1:38:55.280 --> 1:39:00.280]  Remember, Trump got the same amount of white male voters
[1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:05.120]  as did Mitt Romney in 2012.
[1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:08.120]  We go on to say, despite Hillary Clinton
[1:39:08.120 --> 1:39:13.120]  playing the first woman to be elected president gender card,
[1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:17.920]  she received two million fewer votes from women
[1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:21.560]  than Obama did in 2012.
[1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:23.280]  I'm mentioning this, Alex,
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:25.840]  because everybody's playing that stupid.
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:28.520]  The facts are the very same people
[1:39:28.520 --> 1:39:30.800]  that elected Obama elected Trump.
[1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:31.640]  They want change.
[1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:32.800]  They want a good economy.
[1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:34.600]  They don't want World War III.
[1:39:34.600 --> 1:39:35.520]  You got it.
[1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:37.520]  So, but they're sending the propaganda
[1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:39.120]  that the Russians did it.
[1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:42.760]  Because maybe, you know, it wasn't the Russians,
[1:39:42.760 --> 1:39:45.680]  because if the Russians only had Clinton,
[1:39:45.680 --> 1:39:49.840]  how come the Democrats got creamed in the house,
[1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:53.880]  lost the Senate, lost the state houses across the country?
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:58.080]  Biggest state loss ever, 900 state seats lost.
[1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:00.920]  Right, had nothing to do with the Russians.
[1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:04.320]  It had to do with the trader in chief,
[1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:06.440]  the guy that went around in campaign.
[1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:08.560]  Wait a minute, I burned my toast this morning
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:11.000]  and the dog ate my homework back in fifth grade.
[1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.760]  You're saying that wasn't the riskies?
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:16.880]  Again, it was the trader in chief, Obama,
[1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:19.280]  who lied his way into the office,
[1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:22.440]  campaigned more than any other sitting president
[1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:24.520]  in modern history for Clinton,
[1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:27.960]  going around the country with that arrogant attitude
[1:40:27.960 --> 1:40:31.600]  about, hey, folks, folks, you want to keep my,
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:33.160]  you want to keep my folks,
[1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:35.320]  you want to keep my legacy alive?
[1:40:35.320 --> 1:40:37.680]  This is what they said to his legacy
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:41.000]  at the Senate, in the house, in all the legislatures.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:43.240]  It had, again, those are the facts,
[1:40:43.240 --> 1:40:45.520]  so the people want to talk to Russian crap
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:47.640]  and they want to talk about white male votes
[1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:49.200]  just got rid of that one,
[1:40:49.200 --> 1:40:51.360]  because here's another number, remember,
[1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:56.360]  two million women fewer voters than Obama in 2012.
[1:40:57.160 --> 1:41:02.160]  More importantly, just 30% of eligible women
[1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:04.800]  cast their ballots for Clinton,
[1:41:04.800 --> 1:41:09.360]  compared to 47% who did not vote.
[1:41:09.360 --> 1:41:10.920]  Nothing to do with the Russians
[1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:14.320]  and she's played the gender card and the women said,
[1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:16.040]  because you saw the polls,
[1:41:16.040 --> 1:41:19.600]  60% of the people that went to the polls
[1:41:19.600 --> 1:41:24.160]  thought that Clinton was untrustworthy and dishonest.
[1:41:24.160 --> 1:41:25.240]  And by the way, let's go further,
[1:41:25.240 --> 1:41:27.360]  because I'm here going off their own mainline polls.
[1:41:27.360 --> 1:41:31.040]  They've been proven to add 7, 9, 12, 14, 15,
[1:41:31.040 --> 1:41:33.720]  on average about nine points more for Hillary
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:36.520]  in all these polls, not just popularity polls,
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:39.800]  not just voting polls, but all these indexes,
[1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:41.640]  they've also been caught currently
[1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:43.240]  trying to hold down Trump's polls,
[1:41:43.240 --> 1:41:44.920]  even though they're actually rising.
[1:41:44.920 --> 1:41:48.000]  So the truth is, wasn't this a total repudiation
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.720]  of the mainstream media's credibility, which AP admits,
[1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:54.760]  was it 6% pre-election, might even be negative now?
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:57.920]  It might be, here, again, these are the facts
[1:41:57.920 --> 1:42:00.240]  because everybody's glossing over it
[1:42:00.240 --> 1:42:03.400]  and they give slick Willie Clinton all this coverage.
[1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:04.920]  Sure, sure, so how do we counter the claim
[1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:07.560]  that it's a white lash, another attempt to race bait?
[1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:08.640]  What do we do?
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:11.680]  Right, but again, you keep doing what we're doing,
[1:42:11.680 --> 1:42:13.800]  but again, here's the race bait card,
[1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:15.320]  you ready for this one?
[1:42:15.320 --> 1:42:18.720]  Two million, some two million black voters
[1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:22.560]  who cast ballots for Obama in 2012,
[1:42:23.560 --> 1:42:25.480]  they didn't cast ballots for Clinton.
[1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:29.440]  So it has nothing to do with the Russians,
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:30.600]  it has to do with who they are.
[1:42:30.600 --> 1:42:32.240]  So what do we do?
[1:42:32.240 --> 1:42:36.680]  What we do is we have to keep calling out the fake media
[1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:39.480]  because as soon as Trump got elected,
[1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:42.360]  the first day in USA Today,
[1:42:42.360 --> 1:42:44.680]  how could a sitting president,
[1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:47.200]  who has 74 lawsuits against him,
[1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:50.560]  go into the White House, a words to that effect?
[1:42:50.560 --> 1:42:55.560]  This was the coverage after Obama won.
[1:42:58.600 --> 1:42:59.920]  Look at the coverage.
[1:42:59.920 --> 1:43:03.000]  And for radio listeners, it's the New Yorker with,
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:03.960]  because most of our audience is radio,
[1:43:03.960 --> 1:43:05.200]  we gotta remind folks of that.
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:08.400]  It's Obama is George Washington, it's all positive.
[1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:10.920]  Obama's loving, he's good, he's an angel.
[1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:13.720]  And now the coverage is Trump's a demon.
[1:43:13.720 --> 1:43:16.440]  That's it, look at the hypocrisy of the media.
[1:43:16.440 --> 1:43:20.600]  I think maybe now, maybe Obama's gonna play Hamilton, huh?
[1:43:20.600 --> 1:43:23.640]  Yeah, he could probably pull that off, got the wig.
[1:43:23.640 --> 1:43:24.480]  Yeah.
[1:43:24.480 --> 1:43:26.200]  But wait, Gerald, I've got this super secret photo
[1:43:26.200 --> 1:43:27.600]  of the CIA released to Obama,
[1:43:27.600 --> 1:43:28.880]  we're now releasing it, it's on screen
[1:43:28.880 --> 1:43:31.800]  for TV viewers, infowars.com, folks, last show.
[1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:33.520]  Democrats got this secret photo
[1:43:33.520 --> 1:43:35.360]  of a room full of Russian hackers
[1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:36.440]  the day before the election.
[1:43:36.440 --> 1:43:38.520]  It's actually 50,000 Trump supporters
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:41.440]  filling a 50,000 person stadium.
[1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:44.360]  But that was all Russian hackers, Gerald.
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:48.360]  Yeah, this is the hypocrisy of the media.
[1:43:48.360 --> 1:43:50.800]  This is the New York Magazine.
[1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:55.800]  All knew the truly radical politics of Barack Obama.
[1:43:57.280 --> 1:44:01.680]  Look at the hypocrisy of what the media did then
[1:44:01.680 --> 1:44:04.000]  and what they're doing now.
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:08.560]  So as we see it, this is going to be
[1:44:08.560 --> 1:44:12.440]  one of the biggest changes that we have going to witness
[1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:15.840]  in our lifetimes as far as politics.
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:18.120]  I wanna put this into perspective,
[1:44:18.120 --> 1:44:19.760]  because we just heard for what,
[1:44:19.760 --> 1:44:23.280]  a week and a half, watch out for the Electoral College.
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:26.640]  You've been covering it, we don't need to go into the details.
[1:44:26.640 --> 1:44:29.240]  They did that for a week and a half,
[1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:31.800]  but two weeks has been, the Russians are coming,
[1:44:31.800 --> 1:44:33.760]  the Russians are coming.
[1:44:33.760 --> 1:44:38.760]  Come January 20th, none of this is going to be important.
[1:44:38.880 --> 1:44:42.640]  A whole new direction is going to take place.
[1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:45.720]  Yes, it is going to be crying by the little liberals.
[1:44:45.720 --> 1:44:47.280]  You're not going to count.
[1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:50.360]  I have never been more positive
[1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:53.920]  and I've been on your show for a decade or at least.
[1:44:55.200 --> 1:44:57.080]  I looked it up about 12 years.
[1:44:57.080 --> 1:44:59.720]  Yeah, and people would say,
[1:44:59.720 --> 1:45:02.400]  oh, that's so lengthy, he's a gloom and doomer.
[1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:04.640]  I was a gloom and doomer when the facts were there
[1:45:04.640 --> 1:45:07.640]  because here's the facts, why did Trump win?
[1:45:07.640 --> 1:45:10.120]  We said why back in May?
[1:45:10.120 --> 1:45:12.280]  It's the economy, stupid.
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:14.960]  Since Obama's been in, 95% of the wealth
[1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:16.680]  has gone to the 1%.
[1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:18.120]  So yes, that's why I'm negative.
[1:45:18.120 --> 1:45:19.160]  And by the way, let me just say this
[1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:20.560]  because I'm on the same page.
[1:45:20.560 --> 1:45:23.120]  Just because of optimism, suddenly restaurants are up,
[1:45:23.120 --> 1:45:25.280]  suddenly small shops are getting more business.
[1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:27.240]  Over a trillion's been added to the stock market.
[1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:29.400]  He's already bringing back all these massive jobs
[1:45:29.400 --> 1:45:30.480]  just on the confidence.
[1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:33.400]  It makes the world confident about us
[1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:35.600]  instead of just poo-pooing that we could ever have a future.
[1:45:35.600 --> 1:45:38.640]  We're America, that's still sexy all over the world.
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:40.520]  People want America to come back.
[1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:42.200]  They want America to be successful.
[1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:45.520]  They want the old America that people really did trust
[1:45:45.520 --> 1:45:47.640]  and really did like that you've been talking about.
[1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:49.560]  So people say, oh, Alex,
[1:45:49.560 --> 1:45:51.760]  I thought the government's all evil, suddenly you love it.
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:53.920]  No, I'm saying we've got a shot
[1:45:53.920 --> 1:45:56.200]  at trying to make it better again
[1:45:56.200 --> 1:45:58.320]  and not being the legion of doom.
[1:45:58.320 --> 1:45:59.760]  And it's very, very exciting
[1:45:59.760 --> 1:46:01.400]  and Trump is already delivering,
[1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:04.480]  but he's riding a wave that you predicted two years ago,
[1:46:04.480 --> 1:46:06.880]  three years ago, it was more than that.
[1:46:06.880 --> 1:46:08.640]  How many years ago was it you put out a special issue
[1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:12.440]  on nationalism, globalism and crisis in the next few years?
[1:46:12.440 --> 1:46:14.160]  And I'll be honest, Gerald, I said on air,
[1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:15.280]  I hope you're right
[1:46:15.280 --> 1:46:17.320]  because I thought you were being too optimistic.
[1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:20.320]  You saw it coming, who else saw it coming?
[1:46:20.320 --> 1:46:22.160]  There was a few others.
[1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:25.200]  Oh, the former head of Black Ops
[1:46:25.200 --> 1:46:27.520]  for the, well, really CIA, not just State Department,
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:30.320]  but Steve Pachinic saw it coming five years ago.
[1:46:30.320 --> 1:46:32.240]  How did you see that coming?
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:34.360]  Well, again, because of why the elections
[1:46:34.360 --> 1:46:35.560]  are going on around the world,
[1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:36.920]  the people have fed up with the elite.
[1:46:36.920 --> 1:46:38.280]  Yeah, but you saw it before it happened.
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:39.120]  Yeah, it happened.
[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:40.680]  How many years ago was that?
[1:46:40.680 --> 1:46:42.800]  Oh, thanks, but that's how it worked, you know?
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:45.480]  So we try to look beyond what the people are saying
[1:46:45.480 --> 1:46:46.880]  and what they're feeling.
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:49.520]  So going back to what you were just saying,
[1:46:49.520 --> 1:46:51.640]  it's one of our top trends.
[1:46:51.640 --> 1:46:53.680]  Think of Trump's campaign slogan
[1:46:53.680 --> 1:46:56.760]  and why we are optimistic about the future.
[1:46:56.760 --> 1:46:59.480]  Make America great again.
[1:46:59.480 --> 1:47:02.480]  So one of our trends are true nostalgia.
[1:47:02.480 --> 1:47:04.400]  When was again?
[1:47:04.400 --> 1:47:06.880]  Look at the difference, for example.
[1:47:06.880 --> 1:47:08.880]  You know, as I mentioned to you on your show,
[1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:11.440]  it wasn't that only Clinton got beat.
[1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:14.040]  We saw Obama got beaten,
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:16.240]  major media got beaten by Trump,
[1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:17.960]  the rappers got beaten beyond,
[1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:20.520]  say the entertainment industry, Hollywood,
[1:47:20.520 --> 1:47:22.160]  Silicon Valley. They threw everything
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:24.960]  they could against us and they lost.
[1:47:24.960 --> 1:47:25.800]  That's right.
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:26.640]  They lost.
[1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:28.120]  Silicon Valley lost.
[1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:30.280]  Now let's take Silicon Valley
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:32.800]  with that arrogant attitude that they have.
[1:47:32.800 --> 1:47:36.200]  They know best, one thinking mind.
[1:47:36.200 --> 1:47:37.840]  Look at the way they dress.
[1:47:37.840 --> 1:47:39.280]  Look at that sucker burger.
[1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:42.320]  He shows up all the time in a T-shirt.
[1:47:42.320 --> 1:47:45.200]  Look at the way the Trump children dress.
[1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:47.840]  Look at the way Trump puts out things.
[1:47:47.840 --> 1:47:50.560]  Go back to make America great again.
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:52.280]  Think of true nostalgia.
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:54.760]  Whether you want to make it up in your mind,
[1:47:54.760 --> 1:47:55.840]  however you want to bring it down.
[1:47:55.840 --> 1:47:58.160]  The 1950s, 2.0.
[1:47:58.160 --> 1:48:00.000]  Or whatever you want it to be,
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:02.080]  elegance, grace and style.
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:03.280]  And you've always obsessed on
[1:48:03.280 --> 1:48:04.880]  if people don't dress nice
[1:48:04.880 --> 1:48:06.160]  and they don't care about their own environment,
[1:48:06.160 --> 1:48:07.000]  they don't care about you.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:07.840]  And you're right.
[1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:11.320]  The sloppishness, well they declassified the CIA
[1:48:11.320 --> 1:48:12.160]  in the 50s and 60s,
[1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:14.280]  put out ugly art and ugly architecture
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:16.520]  to make us feel small and depressed.
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:17.640]  That's declassified.
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:18.840]  You've always harped on this
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:19.960]  and now it's all admitted.
[1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:21.400]  That's a good point.
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:24.560]  And now you have Trump presenting it.
[1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:25.920]  Look at his daughters.
[1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:26.960]  Look at his sons.
[1:48:26.960 --> 1:48:29.360]  Look at the way they show up.
[1:48:29.360 --> 1:48:30.680]  They're not like,
[1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:33.280]  what I'm saying is for people
[1:48:33.280 --> 1:48:36.040]  that want to become entreprenuers,
[1:48:36.040 --> 1:48:37.880]  seize the moment.
[1:48:37.880 --> 1:48:39.040]  Make it new.
[1:48:39.040 --> 1:48:40.080]  Make it old.
[1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:41.440]  Retrofit it.
[1:48:41.440 --> 1:48:42.400]  Do whatever you want to do.
[1:48:42.400 --> 1:48:43.240]  It's energy.
[1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:45.000]  It's a spirit we need.
[1:48:45.000 --> 1:48:47.880]  Exactly, and that's what he's bringing back.
[1:48:47.880 --> 1:48:49.840]  But he's not talking about it.
[1:48:49.840 --> 1:48:51.520]  It's what he does.
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:52.760]  And a number of the people
[1:48:52.760 --> 1:48:54.640]  that he's bringing on with them
[1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:57.600]  live at that kind of lifestyle.
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:49:00.720]  So what we're saying as trend forecasters
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:02.040]  is for the people listening,
[1:49:02.040 --> 1:49:03.920]  for the people that want to move ahead,
[1:49:03.920 --> 1:49:05.720]  seize on what he's doing.
[1:49:05.720 --> 1:49:07.320]  Play the Trump card.
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:08.720]  So for example,
[1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:11.000]  let's say you want to make sneakers.
[1:49:11.000 --> 1:49:12.920]  Play the Trump card.
[1:49:12.920 --> 1:49:15.160]  Come out made with pride in America,
[1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:16.680]  use your footwear, whatever,
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:19.920]  and then start running ads up where Nike is.
[1:49:19.920 --> 1:49:22.000]  If everybody piggybacks on that,
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:23.320]  you'll have market dominance
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:25.560]  in just a couple of years, exactly.
[1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:27.680]  I mean, people ask why my show's so successful.
[1:49:27.680 --> 1:49:29.040]  People want Americana.
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:29.880]  They want success.
[1:49:29.880 --> 1:49:31.120]  And if you believe in it,
[1:49:31.120 --> 1:49:32.200]  humans can do anything.
[1:49:32.200 --> 1:49:33.360]  It's about confidence.
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:35.560]  And globalism was about austerity.
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:36.400]  We're poor.
[1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:37.440]  It's all over.
[1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:38.360]  Submit to it.
[1:49:38.360 --> 1:49:39.240]  Go away.
[1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:40.440]  You've got to be poor.
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:43.320]  I mean, it ought to be easy for us to beat these people
[1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:44.680]  if we simply deliver.
[1:49:44.680 --> 1:49:46.680]  And again, here's the problem.
[1:49:46.680 --> 1:49:47.520]  You're right about all this.
[1:49:47.520 --> 1:49:48.800]  I agree with you.
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:50.880]  A huge renaissance is coming back worldwide,
[1:49:50.880 --> 1:49:51.720]  not just Trump.
[1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:53.280]  He's just riding the wave.
[1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:55.240]  The globalists are going to strike back, Gerald.
[1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:56.520]  Look at their hysteria.
[1:49:56.520 --> 1:49:57.960]  I'm concerned in the next 30 days.
[1:49:57.960 --> 1:49:58.800]  What do you think?
[1:49:59.720 --> 1:50:01.080]  You know, as I said,
[1:50:01.080 --> 1:50:03.320]  the next 30 days are important.
[1:50:03.320 --> 1:50:06.520]  But once Trump gets in the whole scenario,
[1:50:06.520 --> 1:50:09.920]  what we're hearing now of all this worthless fake news
[1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:11.240]  is going to go away.
[1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:14.160]  But I want to make one point about playing the Trump card.
[1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:15.680]  If you look what Trump did,
[1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:19.520]  the first thing he did during the campaign,
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:21.400]  he took out the top guy.
[1:50:21.400 --> 1:50:23.520]  He went over to George Bush,
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:25.040]  put his hand on his shoulder,
[1:50:25.040 --> 1:50:26.040]  on National Tellers,
[1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:27.160]  yeah, you're a nice guy,
[1:50:27.160 --> 1:50:28.480]  but you really don't have it.
[1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:30.840]  Well, he knocked out one top guy after another.
[1:50:30.840 --> 1:50:33.960]  So when you're making pride with America products,
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:35.560]  you're going to make footwear,
[1:50:35.560 --> 1:50:37.960]  start running ads up in Oregon
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:41.960]  and say, hey, Phil Knight, the guy with Nike over there.
[1:50:41.960 --> 1:50:43.600]  What are you getting your shoes made
[1:50:43.600 --> 1:50:46.160]  from slave labor workers over there,
[1:50:46.160 --> 1:50:48.040]  bringing them back to America?
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:49.920]  Just like he's shaming Boeing
[1:50:49.920 --> 1:50:51.560]  to moving a lot of Boeing back.
[1:50:51.560 --> 1:50:52.400]  Exactly.
[1:50:52.400 --> 1:50:54.920]  He's using that bully pulpit.
[1:50:54.920 --> 1:50:56.840]  And that's what he's supposed to do.
[1:50:56.840 --> 1:51:00.560]  Notice Obama said, oh, what do you have some magic wand?
[1:51:00.560 --> 1:51:03.920]  And of course he did end up having a magic wand, didn't he?
[1:51:03.920 --> 1:51:06.080]  We got to keep the show clean.
[1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:08.160]  No, but what I'm saying is exactly,
[1:51:08.160 --> 1:51:10.960]  I'm saying the magic wand is common sense,
[1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:14.400]  saying, hey, if China's got a 15% lower tax than we do,
[1:51:14.400 --> 1:51:15.760]  we've got to lower to that level,
[1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:17.320]  and then boom, the jobs come right back.
[1:51:17.320 --> 1:51:18.760]  This is not rocket science.
[1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:21.560]  Yeah, but what I'm saying is to the entreprenure,
[1:51:21.560 --> 1:51:23.480]  to play the Trump card,
[1:51:23.480 --> 1:51:25.960]  you start going after the people
[1:51:25.960 --> 1:51:28.960]  that are importing all these crappy products,
[1:51:28.960 --> 1:51:31.000]  marking them up and becoming billionaires.
[1:51:31.000 --> 1:51:31.840]  I agree, I agree.
[1:51:31.840 --> 1:51:34.160]  I mean, the plan was in the last few decades,
[1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:35.440]  we just sell out America.
[1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:37.120]  Now the attitude is we're coming back,
[1:51:37.120 --> 1:51:38.640]  so it's that idea.
[1:51:38.640 --> 1:51:41.520]  Exactly, so we're saying to people
[1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:44.600]  to seize on the opportunity.
[1:51:44.600 --> 1:51:47.600]  It's there, and Trump is showing it.
[1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:50.000]  How do they say that in Latin, Carpe Diem?
[1:51:51.280 --> 1:51:54.160]  Yeah, seize the moment.
[1:51:54.160 --> 1:51:56.400]  All right, now let me, as I skip the break,
[1:51:56.400 --> 1:51:58.160]  I wanna take a few calls here and get their ideas
[1:51:58.160 --> 1:52:00.520]  on how they think they may try to overthrow Trump
[1:52:00.520 --> 1:52:01.440]  before even it's in.
[1:52:01.440 --> 1:52:02.640]  Look at all they've done.
[1:52:02.640 --> 1:52:05.000]  Past behavior is the greatest indicator of future
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.080]  performance or behavior.
[1:52:07.080 --> 1:52:09.440]  But I wanna just cover a few other little tidbits quickly,
[1:52:09.440 --> 1:52:10.440]  boom, boom, boom with you,
[1:52:10.440 --> 1:52:11.240]  from The Trends Journal,
[1:52:11.240 --> 1:52:13.840]  Gerald Salinde, TrendsResearch.com.
[1:52:13.840 --> 1:52:14.880]  What about the Fed?
[1:52:14.880 --> 1:52:17.040]  Obviously, they've kept interest rates low forever,
[1:52:17.040 --> 1:52:19.520]  but if they raise them, it's a problem if you do,
[1:52:19.520 --> 1:52:20.360]  it's a problem if you don't.
[1:52:20.360 --> 1:52:23.200]  But suddenly, because the economy heats up
[1:52:23.200 --> 1:52:24.360]  because of confidence with Trump,
[1:52:24.360 --> 1:52:25.960]  it's still in bad trouble,
[1:52:25.960 --> 1:52:27.440]  suddenly they wanna raise them.
[1:52:27.440 --> 1:52:29.040]  What do you make of that?
[1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:31.160]  I think they're gonna raise them.
[1:52:31.160 --> 1:52:33.600]  The forecasts are now maybe two times more.
[1:52:33.600 --> 1:52:35.080]  And they have to come up.
[1:52:35.080 --> 1:52:37.120]  It's going to, what it's going to do,
[1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:40.520]  it's going to hurt them mostly the foreign countries
[1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:42.320]  because they borrowed all that money,
[1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:44.720]  the emerging markets, particularly China,
[1:52:44.720 --> 1:52:46.680]  in cheap dollars.
[1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:49.200]  So now they have to pay them back in dollars,
[1:52:49.200 --> 1:52:51.000]  but their currencies are going down.
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:52.680]  And now notice the dollar's strong again.
[1:52:52.680 --> 1:52:56.120]  It's like a magic switch got thrown when Trump got elected.
[1:52:56.120 --> 1:52:57.280]  Because I guess it's signaled,
[1:52:57.280 --> 1:52:59.400]  we're not laying down anymore?
[1:52:59.400 --> 1:53:00.240]  Yes.
[1:53:00.240 --> 1:53:01.480]  And again, look at the people
[1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:03.840]  he's bringing in for negotiating.
[1:53:03.840 --> 1:53:07.840]  Whether it's Wilbur Ross, Mnuchin, Tillerson,
[1:53:07.840 --> 1:53:11.120]  I mean, these guys, look at the experience that they have.
[1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:12.840]  Yeah, yeah, folks are saying, oh, more rich people.
[1:53:12.840 --> 1:53:14.480]  It's not rich people that stole the money
[1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:16.000]  at hedge funds or whatever.
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:17.760]  It's people that actually are the best salesman
[1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:20.520]  in the world that have connections everywhere.
[1:53:20.520 --> 1:53:23.880]  I mean, they say Rex Tillerson is the genius choice.
[1:53:23.880 --> 1:53:28.680]  Again, if they do what they did for their businesses,
[1:53:28.680 --> 1:53:31.520]  but we the people, this is the kind of guy
[1:53:31.520 --> 1:53:33.280]  I would want to hire.
[1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:35.400]  And when all that they have,
[1:53:35.400 --> 1:53:38.560]  they would hire more lawyers that never did anything.
[1:53:38.560 --> 1:53:39.400]  Yeah, right.
[1:53:39.400 --> 1:53:40.680]  Or a politician.
[1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:43.760]  By the way, I think politicians should be banned
[1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:45.400]  from running for office.
[1:53:45.400 --> 1:53:47.040]  These people never work today in their lives.
[1:53:47.040 --> 1:53:48.120]  By the way, guess what Rex Tillerson is?
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:48.960]  He's an engineer.
[1:53:48.960 --> 1:53:49.800]  That's it.
[1:53:49.800 --> 1:53:51.840]  He started in Texas at oil wells.
[1:53:51.840 --> 1:53:54.080]  Now he runs one of the biggest corporations in the world.
[1:53:54.080 --> 1:53:56.000]  Everybody loves him all over the planet.
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:57.520]  And they are so scared right now
[1:53:57.520 --> 1:53:59.440]  because they know what this lineup means.
[1:53:59.440 --> 1:54:04.040]  Trump is about to just absolutely dominate
[1:54:04.040 --> 1:54:05.000]  bringing jobs back.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:07.120]  And again, that's the plan that I was told about
[1:54:07.120 --> 1:54:09.280]  even beforehand, which is pretty much the Americana plan.
[1:54:09.280 --> 1:54:12.400]  But now it's in, of course, in the whole plan
[1:54:12.400 --> 1:54:14.760]  that was put out in the Hollywood Reporter article
[1:54:14.760 --> 1:54:16.640]  with Stephen Bannon, the chief advisor.
[1:54:16.640 --> 1:54:18.360]  They know the leftist plan to make everybody poor
[1:54:18.360 --> 1:54:19.200]  to control them.
[1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:21.120]  They plan to bring in so much wealth
[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:23.960]  that even the poorest people see such big results
[1:54:23.960 --> 1:54:26.640]  that they basically turn against collectivism forever.
[1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:29.080]  They're attempting to kill communism
[1:54:29.080 --> 1:54:31.920]  but actually deliver the plan at the end of linen
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:33.680]  of the state withering away.
[1:54:33.680 --> 1:54:36.240]  Did you, I mean, that's pretty hardcore.
[1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:38.520]  Alex, this is the time for America
[1:54:38.520 --> 1:54:41.600]  to become a self-sustaining economy
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:45.360]  with 320 million people strong.
[1:54:45.360 --> 1:54:50.360]  We can, 98% of all the clothes we bring into this country
[1:54:50.360 --> 1:54:53.360]  is manufactured overseas.
[1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:56.760]  You and people say, well, you can't do manufacturing.
[1:54:56.760 --> 1:55:00.000]  Oh yeah, I think there's this country called Germany
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:03.800]  and about 25% of their GDP or their amounts
[1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:08.800]  is from manufacturing and only 11, 12% in the United States.
[1:55:08.880 --> 1:55:11.080]  Oh, they can do it, we can't.
[1:55:11.080 --> 1:55:13.360]  Oh, and those manufacturing jobs
[1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:15.840]  pay so much higher wages.
[1:55:15.840 --> 1:55:19.680]  So what I'm saying is that everybody out there
[1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:22.920]  that wants to take your life into your own hands
[1:55:22.920 --> 1:55:25.960]  if you believe you have the skills and the products,
[1:55:25.960 --> 1:55:27.280]  now is the time.
[1:55:27.280 --> 1:55:29.320]  And Gerald, what you're saying is so powerful.
[1:55:29.320 --> 1:55:30.280]  What you're saying is so powerful.
[1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:32.480]  Forget Trump, whether he delivers or not,
[1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:34.400]  we can deliver with the whole message.
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:37.600]  Gerald's been preaching forever, that's pure Americana
[1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:39.840]  and Gerald's been preaching it for 20 plus years.
[1:55:39.840 --> 1:55:41.720]  We're going back to Gerald and a few of your calls
[1:55:41.720 --> 1:55:44.880]  from Andrew, Jeremy, Trevor, Jesse, Justin and others.
[1:55:44.880 --> 1:55:46.840]  But before we do, remember today is the last day
[1:55:46.840 --> 1:55:48.880]  in the lower 48, because now the Puzzle Service
[1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:52.200]  can deliver by Saturday today to get stuff before Christmas.
[1:55:52.200 --> 1:55:53.560]  We've been hacked, we've been attacked,
[1:55:53.560 --> 1:55:55.960]  we need the funds, but we've got great discounts,
[1:55:55.960 --> 1:55:59.200]  free shipping store-wide, up to 50% off,
[1:55:59.200 --> 1:56:02.400]  a lot of the items like colloidal silver
[1:56:02.400 --> 1:56:03.480]  and other great products.
[1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:07.960]  We do have, of course, the Made in America toothpaste
[1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:09.240]  with the colloidal silver.
[1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:12.960]  And of course, it's also got the iodine in it.
[1:56:12.960 --> 1:56:15.120]  We've lowered the price back down to 9.95
[1:56:15.120 --> 1:56:16.720]  because folks liked it so much at that.
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:19.000]  But we have it where you can also support us
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:22.360]  and get it for 14.95 and help fund the operation.
[1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:23.760]  But it really is special.
[1:56:23.760 --> 1:56:25.080]  Toothpaste, it's amazing.
[1:56:25.080 --> 1:56:27.720]  Developed by my dad, I retired a dentist and oral surgeon.
[1:56:27.720 --> 1:56:30.320]  Nobody else has got it with colloidal silver and the iodine.
[1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:31.160]  It's amazing.
[1:56:31.160 --> 1:56:32.720]  It turns blue, it goes from white to blue
[1:56:32.720 --> 1:56:34.680]  because real iodine isn't red, it's blue,
[1:56:34.680 --> 1:56:36.560]  and it turns blue in the oxygen.
[1:56:36.560 --> 1:56:37.400]  It's amazing.
[1:56:37.400 --> 1:56:40.360]  M4Wars, store.com, M4Wars, life.com are called
[1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:43.680]  toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:45.320]  If the store is blocked because of massive
[1:56:45.320 --> 1:56:47.280]  Communist Chinese hack attacks,
[1:56:47.280 --> 1:56:51.040]  you can always call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[1:56:51.040 --> 1:56:52.800]  Let's jam in some calls here.
[1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:55.200]  Andrew, what do you think about all they've
[1:56:55.200 --> 1:56:56.600]  got to try to block Trump?
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:56:58.600]  Will they try to pull something now
[1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:01.320]  in the last 30 days before he's president?
[1:57:01.320 --> 1:57:02.160]  Hello?
[1:57:02.160 --> 1:57:03.280]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:04.120]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[1:57:04.120 --> 1:57:07.320]  This is a real honor to talk to you and Mr. Salente.
[1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:08.960]  I just wanted to ask you,
[1:57:09.880 --> 1:57:12.280]  do you think they're gonna try and use this thing
[1:57:12.280 --> 1:57:16.320]  with Russia to start a war and get in martial law
[1:57:16.320 --> 1:57:18.840]  or is this kind of like a hostage taker
[1:57:18.840 --> 1:57:21.360]  pointing a gun at their own head and be like, oh, shoot.
[1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:23.640]  Well, sure, I mean, that's a great question.
[1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:25.240]  I mean, don't you think, that's what the Russians think,
[1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:26.320]  that's what everybody else thinks,
[1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:28.920]  that this whole assassination of the Russian ambassador
[1:57:28.920 --> 1:57:31.240]  is trying to stir up something in the last 30 days
[1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:32.080]  with Russia?
[1:57:32.960 --> 1:57:34.560]  Well, it is.
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:37.360]  And but people that are concerned about a coup,
[1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:39.720]  we talked about the people that Trump brought in
[1:57:39.720 --> 1:57:41.640]  on the economic end.
[1:57:41.640 --> 1:57:44.200]  How about all the generals he brought in?
[1:57:44.200 --> 1:57:47.480]  I think that they're planning ahead of time
[1:57:47.480 --> 1:57:51.080]  and being proactive in his choices,
[1:57:51.080 --> 1:57:54.960]  just in case they try to do something
[1:57:54.960 --> 1:57:58.520]  to disrupt him being, getting into office
[1:57:58.520 --> 1:57:59.800]  or trying to get him out.
[1:57:59.800 --> 1:58:00.880]  This isn't boasting.
[1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:03.080]  I'm gonna just tell the fake left
[1:58:03.080 --> 1:58:04.600]  and all you guys wanna have some civil war
[1:58:04.600 --> 1:58:06.880]  and you got the top killers out running around stuff.
[1:58:06.880 --> 1:58:09.160]  If you really try martial law,
[1:58:09.160 --> 1:58:13.040]  I mean, the entire military is just waiting, just waiting.
[1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:15.320]  And then you're gonna be in a lot of trouble.
[1:58:15.320 --> 1:58:17.800]  And I guess that's what Gerald's getting at, right, Gerald?
[1:58:17.800 --> 1:58:20.840]  Yeah, look at the people that he's picked and his cabinet.
[1:58:20.840 --> 1:58:22.720]  You got all these generals
[1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:25.160]  and you have guys that really know the score.
[1:58:25.160 --> 1:58:26.680]  That's right, Andrew.
[1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:27.520]  Yeah, they're pretty freaked out.
[1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:28.760]  They know all those generals are listeners.
[1:58:28.760 --> 1:58:31.320]  I mean, not just Flynn, folks.
[1:58:31.320 --> 1:58:33.080]  Andrew, we appreciate your call.

[1:59:51.400 --> 1:59:54.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:59:54.480 --> 2:00:21.160]  We got to get him back up for a full hour.
[2:00:21.160 --> 2:00:24.480]  I know that he's going to be co-hosting some in January,
[2:00:24.480 --> 2:00:29.840]  when I am taking an absolutely mandatory workstation.
[2:00:29.840 --> 2:00:31.000]  You are the resistance.
[2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:32.680]  Oh, my god, I can interrupt my own interest.
[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:36.720]  From Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:37.600]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:37.600 --> 2:00:38.520]  Roger Jones coming up.
[2:00:38.520 --> 2:00:39.480]  Matt Bracken's coming up.
[2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:41.960]  Paul Watson hosts the fourth hour from London.
[2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:43.400]  Such an important hour, because you
[2:00:43.400 --> 2:00:45.720]  get a lot of the news in that hour, not just my babble.
[2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:48.880]  David Knight and others host it.
[2:00:48.880 --> 2:00:50.600]  I want to go to more calls here.
[2:00:50.600 --> 2:00:53.160]  Let's talk to Jeremy in Texas.
[2:00:53.160 --> 2:00:54.400]  What do you think's coming next?
[2:00:54.400 --> 2:00:58.440]  Is a distraction or a way to try to derail Trump?
[2:00:58.440 --> 2:01:00.720]  Alex, I think ultimately the Federal Reserve
[2:01:00.720 --> 2:01:02.200]  is going to dump the dollar.
[2:01:02.200 --> 2:01:07.600]  I believe the recent DDS, DDoS attack on Infowars,
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:09.760]  was a shot heard around the world.
[2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:13.000]  And it is a warning shot to warn everybody
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:16.120]  that we can, in effect, shut down the American grid
[2:01:16.120 --> 2:01:19.280]  with a DDoS attack.
[2:01:19.280 --> 2:01:22.120]  That's what I'm thinking in a nutshell.
[2:01:22.120 --> 2:01:28.000]  And it really comes down to the economic power shifting.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.720]  I believe that the elite want to bring over
[2:01:30.720 --> 2:01:31.920]  to have a chaos naturally.
[2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:34.320]  So they've lost total control.
[2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:36.360]  And they want to hedge everything on chaos.
[2:01:36.360 --> 2:01:39.760]  In fact, FEMA and NASA have been meeting recently
[2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:43.360]  in Southern California over potential asteroid strikes.
[2:01:43.360 --> 2:01:45.080]  Oh, they're saying a huge earthquakes way
[2:01:45.080 --> 2:01:46.040]  over doing California.
[2:01:46.040 --> 2:01:48.360]  It's hit everywhere on the great Ring of Fire,
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:49.480]  except there.
[2:01:49.480 --> 2:01:52.520]  It's supposed to be like an 8 or a 7.8 next time it hits.
[2:01:52.520 --> 2:01:53.400]  It's estimated.
[2:01:53.400 --> 2:01:54.960]  But you know, you're right.
[2:01:54.960 --> 2:01:56.960]  They're betting everything on chaos.
[2:01:56.960 --> 2:01:59.680]  But the momentum is against them.
[2:01:59.680 --> 2:02:01.960]  I appreciate your call.
[2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:05.200]  By the way, folks, Infowars is in the top 100 websites
[2:02:05.200 --> 2:02:06.440]  in the world.
[2:02:06.440 --> 2:02:08.680]  The issue is we have one of the biggest companies
[2:02:08.680 --> 2:02:09.040]  in the world.
[2:02:09.040 --> 2:02:10.640]  Does MasterCard Visa, you name it?
[2:02:10.640 --> 2:02:12.040]  They said, don't worry.
[2:02:12.040 --> 2:02:15.080]  We flipped on systems that state sponsors will
[2:02:15.080 --> 2:02:16.040]  have trouble bringing down.
[2:02:16.040 --> 2:02:17.320]  Well, they brought it down again.
[2:02:17.320 --> 2:02:21.120]  So it was sophisticated, massive, quadruple-pronged,
[2:02:21.120 --> 2:02:22.160]  and went over four days.
[2:02:22.160 --> 2:02:24.400]  And I'm sure I'll hit again.
[2:02:24.400 --> 2:02:26.200]  Gerald Salente.
[2:02:26.200 --> 2:02:28.200]  Yes, and I want to urge everybody
[2:02:28.200 --> 2:02:32.720]  listening to support Infowars by the products
[2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:33.600]  that they're selling.
[2:02:33.600 --> 2:02:34.680]  They're made in America.
[2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:37.120]  They're made with quality and pride.
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:39.760]  And the major media is doing everything
[2:02:39.760 --> 2:02:43.160]  they can to sell this lie of fake news
[2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:45.920]  when they are the greatest purveyors of it.
[2:02:45.920 --> 2:02:49.040]  So really, put your money where your mind is
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:52.720]  and make this happen, because now is our time.
[2:02:52.720 --> 2:02:55.280]  And as someone once said, it does not
[2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:59.240]  take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless
[2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:03.080]  minority, keen on setting brush fires of freedom
[2:03:03.080 --> 2:03:05.920]  in the minds of men, Samuel Adams.
[2:03:05.920 --> 2:03:07.760]  So everyone out there, do what you can
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:12.600]  to make all this happen, because the negatives are there.
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:13.560]  Eliminate them.
[2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:16.200]  Let's hit the positives, and the positives
[2:03:16.200 --> 2:03:17.600]  are we the people.
[2:03:17.600 --> 2:03:19.840]  And now has never been a better time.
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:21.680]  As for the dollar, I think it's going
[2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:23.680]  to continue to get stronger.
[2:03:23.680 --> 2:03:26.120]  You look at the yuan, this is where
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:28.040]  I disagree with Trump, by the way.
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:30.880]  The Chinese are not devaluing their currency.
[2:03:30.880 --> 2:03:33.480]  You're doing everything they can trying to prop it up.
[2:03:33.480 --> 2:03:36.160]  They just had $70 billion worth of outflows.
[2:03:36.160 --> 2:03:38.440]  Well, I mean, I agree, but it's still a paradox,
[2:03:38.440 --> 2:03:41.000]  is when it goes low, it still hurts our manufacturing.
[2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:43.800]  But they've so overprinted that it's kind of a, it's damn
[2:03:43.800 --> 2:03:45.600]  of you, damn it, we don't, but I think you're right.
[2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:47.480]  Real quick, Trevor in Wyoming, I know this is a question
[2:03:47.480 --> 2:03:48.320]  you don't want.
[2:03:48.320 --> 2:03:50.280]  What's your question or comment for Jelsa Lente?
[2:03:50.280 --> 2:03:52.480]  Go ahead, Trevor.
[2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:56.000]  It would be about China stockpiling silver and gold
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:04:04.280]  over the past decade into that same line of thinking is,
[2:04:04.280 --> 2:04:08.280]  if they do crash global markets, will they then
[2:04:08.280 --> 2:04:10.360]  go to the gold or silverback currency
[2:04:10.360 --> 2:04:14.320]  that being that China and India have been buying it up,
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:17.840]  that they're ultimately going to hold the lion's share.
[2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:20.280]  And we're almost out of time.
[2:04:20.280 --> 2:04:21.840]  Started to get you guys in short.
[2:04:21.840 --> 2:04:23.680]  Real quick, Gerald, answer to that.
[2:04:23.680 --> 2:04:27.320]  Yeah, well, again, China's reserve currencies are down 20%.
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:31.520]  If the people are buying gold, they've driven Bitcoin up 34%.
[2:04:31.520 --> 2:04:34.960]  So you go to where there's India, China, they all want gold,
[2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:38.240]  but the governments are trying to stop them from buying it
[2:04:38.240 --> 2:04:41.000]  because they know how worthless their currencies are.
[2:04:41.000 --> 2:04:43.400]  But regardless, they'll be ups and downs.
[2:04:43.400 --> 2:04:46.600]  But the long term, we still see gold as a safe haven.
[2:04:46.600 --> 2:04:49.240]  And China and India is the biggest buyer.
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:51.040]  It's definitely an interesting time
[2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:52.080]  because of Chinese proverb.
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:54.840]  Thank you, Gerald Salente, friendsresearch.com.
[2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:58.960]  Stay with us, Roger Stone, straight ahead.
[2:04:58.960 --> 2:05:01.480]  Look at this nonsense from Darlene Superville
[2:05:01.480 --> 2:05:03.000]  of the Associated Press.
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:06.600]  Headline reads, Trump blames terrorist for killing in Turkey.
[2:05:06.600 --> 2:05:09.400]  Trump, on Monday, experienced what life will be like as president
[2:05:09.400 --> 2:05:11.320]  as he condemned separate deadly incidents
[2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:13.360]  against a Russian diplomat and shoppers
[2:05:13.360 --> 2:05:16.160]  at a German Christmas market, blaming Islamic terrorism
[2:05:16.160 --> 2:05:17.400]  in both instances.
[2:05:17.400 --> 2:05:19.760]  Finally, a president who calls it like it is.
[2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:22.000]  But wait, that's not how Darlene feels.
[2:05:22.000 --> 2:05:24.680]  She says he offered no support for his claims
[2:05:24.680 --> 2:05:27.120]  that terrorists were responsible for the carnage.
[2:05:27.120 --> 2:05:28.200]  What was what?
[2:05:28.200 --> 2:05:30.640]  What world are you living in, Darlene?
[2:05:30.640 --> 2:05:33.160]  The shooter literally said Allahu Akbar
[2:05:33.160 --> 2:05:34.960]  and said he did this for Jihad.
[2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:37.040]  And what other incidents do we know of
[2:05:37.040 --> 2:05:39.680]  where crowds of people are run over by a truck?
[2:05:39.680 --> 2:05:42.080]  If 120 people were in a burning building
[2:05:42.080 --> 2:05:44.120]  and Trump saved 119 of them,
[2:05:44.120 --> 2:05:45.640]  Darlene would write a story saying
[2:05:45.640 --> 2:05:47.440]  Trump kills one in structure fire.
[2:05:47.440 --> 2:05:49.120]  This is just like when they scolded Trump
[2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:52.040]  for referencing a bomb in New York back in September.
[2:05:52.040 --> 2:05:54.440]  Well, he was right then and he is right now.
[2:05:54.440 --> 2:05:55.600]  Sorry, Darlene.
[2:05:55.600 --> 2:05:58.960]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com.
[2:05:58.960 --> 2:06:01.160]  I am very proud to announce the introduction
[2:06:01.160 --> 2:06:06.160]  of the highest quality infowars biome defense probiotic.
[2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:09.480]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum
[2:06:09.480 --> 2:06:14.480]  of high quality known probiotics that have been proven
[2:06:14.640 --> 2:06:17.880]  to improve overall digestion and health
[2:06:17.880 --> 2:06:20.600]  and detoxification in the body.
[2:06:20.600 --> 2:06:24.000]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.760]  live and active cultures from over 23
[2:06:26.760 --> 2:06:29.560]  different probiotic strains that are known
[2:06:29.560 --> 2:06:32.400]  to support digestion and intestinal function.
[2:06:32.400 --> 2:06:34.680]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able
[2:06:34.680 --> 2:06:39.160]  to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:41.640]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength
[2:06:41.640 --> 2:06:44.800]  or regular strength at infowarslife.com today
[2:06:44.800 --> 2:06:48.240]  and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[2:06:48.240 --> 2:06:50.000]  We've been testing this formula for years,
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:52.480]  but this is the limited first round of the public.
[2:06:52.480 --> 2:06:54.240]  So please take advantage of it today,
[2:06:54.240 --> 2:06:56.760]  support your own health and support the info war.
[2:06:56.760 --> 2:07:00.120]  We're selling a product DNA force
[2:07:00.120 --> 2:07:03.400]  that is the very best nutraceutical
[2:07:03.400 --> 2:07:05.360]  that we can produce about a group
[2:07:05.360 --> 2:07:08.040]  you took years for you to develop DNA force for us.
[2:07:08.040 --> 2:07:10.000]  It's been something that I've been working on
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:11.080]  for a long time, Alex,
[2:07:11.080 --> 2:07:13.680]  because I think it's very, very important.
[2:07:13.680 --> 2:07:16.960]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates,
[2:07:16.960 --> 2:07:19.800]  we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:23.040]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes.
[2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:24.760]  But when it runs out, you start dying.
[2:07:24.760 --> 2:07:27.680]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175
[2:07:27.680 --> 2:07:29.000]  different clinical trials.
[2:07:29.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:33.640]  It works like an antioxidant.
[2:07:33.640 --> 2:07:37.080]  It works to repair nerve growth factor.
[2:07:37.080 --> 2:07:39.680]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount.
[2:07:39.680 --> 2:07:40.760]  It's in powder form.
[2:07:40.760 --> 2:07:43.520]  We have so many five-star reviews.
[2:07:43.520 --> 2:07:46.160]  I take this, this is the product that I take.
[2:07:46.160 --> 2:07:48.840]  infowarslife.com and the profit we make,
[2:07:48.840 --> 2:07:50.800]  we fight the global, we fight the new world order.

[2:07:57.680 --> 2:08:22.960]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:08:22.960 --> 2:08:30.520]  You know what, I don't care anymore.
[2:08:30.520 --> 2:08:32.800]  I got lots of friends because they read the newspapers
[2:08:32.800 --> 2:08:34.360]  and the newspapers are the enemy.
[2:08:34.360 --> 2:08:35.720]  So the newspapers are attacking me.
[2:08:35.720 --> 2:08:38.080]  I must be a good guy.
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:42.480]  That's how little power the establishment has.
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:44.560]  The only power they have is to endorse you
[2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:47.160]  and then the public will turn against you.
[2:08:47.160 --> 2:08:48.840]  Donald Trump has learned that.
[2:08:48.840 --> 2:08:50.040]  We've all learned that.
[2:08:50.040 --> 2:08:51.960]  We've seen the entire media establishment
[2:08:51.960 --> 2:08:53.440]  do everything they could to defeat Trump,
[2:08:53.440 --> 2:08:56.160]  to lie about him, to call him racist, to homophobe,
[2:08:56.160 --> 2:09:00.760]  then a Russian agent, a rapist, all of it fake.
[2:09:00.760 --> 2:09:06.280]  And now he got the 270, well-passed at 300 plus
[2:09:06.280 --> 2:09:09.200]  with the electors yesterday.
[2:09:09.200 --> 2:09:13.000]  We're 30 days out from the January 20th Friday event
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:14.800]  that'll happen in D.C.
[2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:18.200]  And my question is, what will they try to pull now
[2:09:18.200 --> 2:09:21.680]  or what to look for now from the man,
[2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:24.040]  Roger Stone, former head of the Trump campaign
[2:09:24.040 --> 2:09:26.480]  and obviously good friends with Trump,
[2:09:26.480 --> 2:09:29.560]  former wingman of Trump, who never tells anything.
[2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:33.280]  Trump told us, just tells us what we should look for
[2:09:33.280 --> 2:09:35.800]  coming up in the future.
[2:09:35.800 --> 2:09:37.520]  So he's with us for one segment.
[2:09:37.520 --> 2:09:39.080]  He's been upriding.
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:40.600]  He's a little bit under the weather,
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:43.040]  but he's here to celebrate with a victory lap
[2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:45.200]  the fact that we got the election
[2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:47.120]  and now he's gotten the delegates
[2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:48.880]  and all the sabotage failed.
[2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:50.960]  So congratulations, Roger Stone
[2:09:50.960 --> 2:09:53.680]  and also to all the listeners for taking action.
[2:09:53.680 --> 2:09:56.400]  We're the winners in the uphill battle
[2:09:56.400 --> 2:09:58.400]  in the election of the century.
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:02.680]  Alex, it's great to be with you today.
[2:10:02.680 --> 2:10:05.720]  I got a little bout of food poisoning,
[2:10:05.720 --> 2:10:08.920]  but delighted to say that I have rallied.
[2:10:08.920 --> 2:10:11.200]  As you know, I'm kind of hunkered down
[2:10:11.200 --> 2:10:13.640]  trying to finish the manuscript for my book,
[2:10:13.640 --> 2:10:16.120]  the making of the president 2016,
[2:10:16.120 --> 2:10:19.600]  how Donald Trump orchestrated an American Revolution.
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:22.160]  But you're exactly right.
[2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:25.440]  The coup d'etat has fizzled.
[2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:28.360]  All that sermon rang about the electors
[2:10:28.360 --> 2:10:32.120]  and the harping on the popular vote,
[2:10:32.120 --> 2:10:37.120]  then the completely phony 3.5 million dollar recount
[2:10:38.200 --> 2:10:40.720]  in Wisconsin, which produced nothing
[2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:43.080]  but a slight gain for Donald Trump.
[2:10:43.080 --> 2:10:45.560]  And then there was this assault on the electors.
[2:10:45.560 --> 2:10:49.680]  Electors threatened with murder, threatened with violence,
[2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:51.520]  threatened to be destroyed,
[2:10:51.520 --> 2:10:53.720]  and they picked up one electorate.
[2:10:53.720 --> 2:10:57.040]  So the score is, I would say,
[2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:00.760]  David Brock is now zero for two.
[2:11:00.760 --> 2:11:02.800]  And if I were George Soros,
[2:11:02.800 --> 2:11:07.000]  and I had laid out $300, $400 million,
[2:11:07.000 --> 2:11:09.120]  I would want my money back.
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:11.280]  You know, I don't normally make fun of people's appearances,
[2:11:11.280 --> 2:11:14.320]  but he looks like some kind of weird poodle dog or something.
[2:11:14.320 --> 2:11:16.280]  With that fake Einstein hair,
[2:11:16.280 --> 2:11:20.720]  he just looks like the biggest phony intellectual dumbass
[2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:21.880]  the world has ever seen.
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:23.880]  This is a supposed brainiac.
[2:11:23.880 --> 2:11:25.400]  I mean, the guy's a complete joke.
[2:11:25.400 --> 2:11:28.360]  He thought demonizing Trump with Alex Jones
[2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:30.480]  would make people turn against Trump
[2:11:30.480 --> 2:11:34.640]  when all it did was give Trump that allure
[2:11:34.640 --> 2:11:36.880]  of true revolutionary sexiness.
[2:11:37.760 --> 2:11:40.120]  Yeah, it was an entire miscalculation.
[2:11:40.120 --> 2:11:42.680]  Somehow the idea that if you smeared Roger Stone,
[2:11:42.680 --> 2:11:44.600]  if you smeared Alex Jones,
[2:11:44.600 --> 2:11:48.240]  if you smeared the other so-called deplorables,
[2:11:48.240 --> 2:11:49.920]  that that would elect Hillary Clinton
[2:11:49.920 --> 2:11:52.840]  and erase her various warts and blemishes,
[2:11:52.840 --> 2:11:55.840]  which are obviously quite substantial.
[2:11:55.840 --> 2:11:57.400]  And they thought kicking you
[2:11:57.400 --> 2:11:59.520]  in their internal memos and video that we've caught,
[2:11:59.520 --> 2:12:03.520]  the MVP of Fox seeing an MSNBC officially banned
[2:12:03.520 --> 2:12:04.960]  the last year and a half,
[2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:07.320]  that only made you focus on the new media more
[2:12:07.320 --> 2:12:09.280]  and made you even bigger.
[2:12:09.280 --> 2:12:10.840]  So it's so funny.
[2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:13.400]  They thought they took you out of the game.
[2:12:13.400 --> 2:12:15.080]  Well, on the irony here now, Alex,
[2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:18.440]  is that we're fighting over so-called fake news
[2:12:18.440 --> 2:12:20.360]  because I've been subjected to fake news
[2:12:20.360 --> 2:12:22.440]  three times in the last week.
[2:12:22.440 --> 2:12:25.800]  First, John Podesta wrote in the Washington Post
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:29.760]  that I tipped Donald Trump off to Russian hacking
[2:12:29.760 --> 2:12:34.400]  by WikiLeaks, a total and complete falsehood.
[2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:39.160]  Then the White House press secretary attacked me by name,
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:42.880]  suggesting yet again that I told Donald Trump
[2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:45.560]  in advance of some Russian hacking.
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:47.080]  That's twice.
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:50.720]  And now, frankly, with some fulfillment,
[2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:54.800]  political facts comes forward and they admit yesterday,
[2:12:54.800 --> 2:12:58.360]  no evidence whatsoever of Russian hacking.
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:13:00.720]  Now, that's the fake news.
[2:13:00.720 --> 2:13:02.080]  We are the real news,
[2:13:02.080 --> 2:13:05.320]  which is why I urge people to go to the Info War site
[2:13:05.320 --> 2:13:09.120]  and sign the petition now to make sure
[2:13:09.120 --> 2:13:11.800]  the president understands we don't need
[2:13:11.800 --> 2:13:16.800]  a civilian censorship board secretly run by the CIA
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:20.400]  to decide what is and is not real news.
[2:13:20.400 --> 2:13:22.520]  And by the way, I need to call ban
[2:13:22.520 --> 2:13:23.600]  and the people have been too busy.
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:27.600]  We've mailed the 100,000 signatures that we printed up
[2:13:27.600 --> 2:13:30.960]  so that they physically see them to Trump Tower.
[2:13:30.960 --> 2:13:32.480]  So I hope that isn't taken as a giant,
[2:13:32.480 --> 2:13:33.440]  you know what, the punch bowl,
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:35.640]  but obviously Trump wants to support the free speech
[2:13:35.640 --> 2:13:37.880]  and the independent media that helped get him elected.
[2:13:37.880 --> 2:13:40.360]  We're also gonna then mail it on to Congress
[2:13:40.360 --> 2:13:42.000]  and onto the Congress folks.
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:44.200]  Obviously, it's a stunt to show what's happened,
[2:13:44.200 --> 2:13:45.920]  but people can sign the next wave of the petition
[2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:47.200]  that we're gonna deliver as well
[2:13:47.200 --> 2:13:49.360]  at infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:50.280]  There's the main newsletter
[2:13:50.280 --> 2:13:53.920]  and there's also the free speech coalition we founded.
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:57.280]  But wow, so they graduated from getting caught lying
[2:13:57.280 --> 2:14:00.280]  and having no credibility to openly wanting to shut us up.
[2:14:00.280 --> 2:14:02.520]  And even Matt Taibbi of the Rolling Stones said,
[2:14:02.520 --> 2:14:03.760]  this is worse than McCarthy.
[2:14:03.760 --> 2:14:05.240]  I mean, these people are crazy.
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:07.800]  How do you expect this to play out, Roger?
[2:14:07.800 --> 2:14:09.320]  Yeah, no, Alex is exactly right.
[2:14:09.320 --> 2:14:11.040]  This is the new McCarthyism.
[2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:15.120]  In other words, if you are not for war over Syria,
[2:14:15.120 --> 2:14:17.000]  presumably with the Russians,
[2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:20.120]  then you must be a traitor to the country that you love.
[2:14:20.120 --> 2:14:23.360]  You must be a spy for Putin.
[2:14:23.360 --> 2:14:24.840]  It's ironic, is it not,
[2:14:24.840 --> 2:14:27.800]  that their whole meme was exactly the same
[2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:31.680]  before the election as it is after the election.
[2:14:31.680 --> 2:14:36.680]  You can go back to back Washington post analysis pieces
[2:14:36.680 --> 2:14:38.400]  before the election.
[2:14:38.400 --> 2:14:41.160]  Podesta says, stone is a Soviet spy.
[2:14:41.160 --> 2:14:43.760]  After the election, he essentially says,
[2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:45.520]  stone is a Soviet spy.
[2:14:45.520 --> 2:14:48.040]  It was a lie then, it's a lie now.
[2:14:48.040 --> 2:14:49.520]  The great part though, no one buys it.
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:50.760]  It's a huge joke.
[2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:52.600]  All of the internet, the memes are incredible.
[2:14:52.600 --> 2:14:55.000]  No one buys it, no one.
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:15:00.000]  No one though is worse than John Brennan, the CIA director.
[2:15:00.000 --> 2:15:03.680]  First of all, I believe that he is an Islamic sympathizer.
[2:15:03.680 --> 2:15:07.240]  I think that he has been a great proponent
[2:15:07.240 --> 2:15:08.960]  of the Muslim brotherhood.
[2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:11.240]  He refused to use a Bible to be sworn in
[2:15:11.240 --> 2:15:14.200]  to his august office.
[2:15:14.200 --> 2:15:15.960]  Many people in intelligence believe
[2:15:15.960 --> 2:15:19.720]  that he has himself converted to Wahhabism.
[2:15:19.720 --> 2:15:21.720]  By the way, he was also predicting
[2:15:21.720 --> 2:15:24.160]  that the Russians would hack the election
[2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:25.760]  before the election.
[2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:27.760]  Now he's saying it again.
[2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:29.640]  That's because Clapper and these others,
[2:15:29.640 --> 2:15:32.600]  Dr. James Clapper, who runs Defense Intelligence,
[2:15:32.600 --> 2:15:35.200]  pointed out that the CIA had no evidence.
[2:15:35.200 --> 2:15:37.160]  That's why Brennan had to jump back in and said,
[2:15:37.160 --> 2:15:39.800]  oh yes we do, but he doesn't.
[2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:41.120]  He needs to go.
[2:15:41.120 --> 2:15:45.080]  The instant Donald Trump is elected, he needs to go.
[2:15:45.080 --> 2:15:46.200]  Well, absolutely.
[2:15:46.200 --> 2:15:48.400]  He is gonna be gone, gone, gone.
[2:15:48.400 --> 2:15:49.840]  In the time we have, I want you to rest
[2:15:49.840 --> 2:15:51.640]  and get back to the book.
[2:15:51.640 --> 2:15:54.280]  But looking at this, obviously what else
[2:15:54.280 --> 2:15:58.200]  do you think some Podesta's 45s rate our screen?
[2:15:58.200 --> 2:16:00.680]  What are other big issues we've got to look out for
[2:16:00.680 --> 2:16:02.400]  as far as appointments?
[2:16:02.400 --> 2:16:04.200]  Other dirty tricks you think they might pull
[2:16:04.200 --> 2:16:05.680]  to keep him from getting in there?
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:08.480]  Obviously they're gonna want a bunch of hysteria
[2:16:08.480 --> 2:16:11.440]  at the inauguration, but it seems like American people,
[2:16:11.440 --> 2:16:13.120]  as his poll numbers only go up,
[2:16:13.120 --> 2:16:15.520]  get now how pathetic all this is.
[2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:17.760]  Well, two things, Alex.
[2:16:17.760 --> 2:16:20.000]  One, a major story in New York Magazine
[2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:24.160]  on the case for impeachment of Donald Trump.
[2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:26.000]  Now I guess that this is an admission
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.760]  that they're not going to stop his being sworn in.
[2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:32.320]  So therefore the drumbeat for impeachment
[2:16:32.320 --> 2:16:37.320]  over some imagined or manufactured ethical issues
[2:16:37.480 --> 2:16:39.960]  appears to me to be a foil.
[2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:44.960]  We also now have a claim of Trump saying racially
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:50.320]  and appropriate things prior to an apprentice taping.
[2:16:50.320 --> 2:16:52.680]  Let's wait and see if there really is a tape.
[2:16:52.680 --> 2:16:57.120]  We heard this canard before during the election,
[2:16:57.120 --> 2:16:58.960]  but they're going to continue to try
[2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:02.320]  to delegitimize Trump in any way possible.
[2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:03.920]  Sure, and it's not vindictiveness.
[2:17:03.920 --> 2:17:06.440]  He's got to go on the offense against the Clintons
[2:17:06.440 --> 2:17:08.080]  and all the people that really got money from Russia.
[2:17:08.080 --> 2:17:09.280]  Are they're never going to stop?
[2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:10.760]  I mean, the thing is he can't just be nice.
[2:17:10.760 --> 2:17:12.760]  They're not going to go away.
[2:17:12.760 --> 2:17:17.760]  Well, plus at the same time, we have our internal battles.
[2:17:17.760 --> 2:17:20.440]  So I read a piece that astounded me in Newsmax
[2:17:20.440 --> 2:17:23.600]  the other day that the chairman of the council
[2:17:23.600 --> 2:17:26.200]  on foreign relations, Richard Haas,
[2:17:26.200 --> 2:17:28.720]  was destined to be the number two man
[2:17:28.720 --> 2:17:30.960]  at the Trump State Department.
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:34.440]  Let me just say for the record, don't bet the ranch.
[2:17:36.120 --> 2:17:37.720]  And you've said that about Romney as well.
[2:17:37.720 --> 2:17:40.360]  I know you just imagined it yourself.
[2:17:40.360 --> 2:17:41.880]  Trump was never toying with him
[2:17:41.880 --> 2:17:43.360]  with like a cat with a mouth.
[2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:45.200]  I love the photo of him at Trump Tower
[2:17:45.200 --> 2:17:47.320]  though having dinner with Priebus and Romney.
[2:17:47.320 --> 2:17:49.840]  And he looks like the cat that just ate the canary
[2:17:49.840 --> 2:17:52.960]  that have a very cat-like face on Trump.
[2:17:52.960 --> 2:17:55.240]  I just, Alex, I have an instinctual belief
[2:17:55.240 --> 2:17:58.200]  that Richard Haas is not going to get this job
[2:17:58.200 --> 2:18:00.840]  and that Donald Trump is not going to elevate
[2:18:00.840 --> 2:18:03.760]  the head of the CFR to anything.
[2:18:03.760 --> 2:18:07.600]  You know, when I spoke to him last, I can divulge this.
[2:18:07.600 --> 2:18:10.600]  I said to him, you've got an awful lot of guys
[2:18:10.600 --> 2:18:12.640]  from Goldman Sachs.
[2:18:12.640 --> 2:18:14.200]  And he said, yeah, you know why?
[2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:16.840]  They're really, really smart guys.
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:19.160]  But if anybody doesn't think I'm making policy
[2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:20.400]  and they're carrying it out,
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:23.400]  they don't understand why I hired them.
[2:18:23.400 --> 2:18:24.240]  So-
[2:18:24.240 --> 2:18:25.080]  Are you breaking out here?
[2:18:25.080 --> 2:18:26.360]  That is major news.
[2:18:26.360 --> 2:18:28.480]  Yeah, this is, he's in charge here.
[2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:29.840]  There's no question about it.
[2:18:29.840 --> 2:18:33.800]  And he is seeking out extraordinarily capable people.
[2:18:33.800 --> 2:18:36.600]  Nobody ever said the guys at Goldman are dumb.
[2:18:36.600 --> 2:18:39.360]  They had made billions for their clients.
[2:18:39.360 --> 2:18:40.680]  Trillions, trillions.
[2:18:40.680 --> 2:18:43.240]  But the agenda is very clearly Trump's.
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:45.040]  Let's add to this.
[2:18:45.040 --> 2:18:46.880]  You know, I gave the analogy in the media
[2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:48.200]  made jokes about it saying,
[2:18:48.200 --> 2:18:50.360]  Alex Jones is worried about Trump and goblins.
[2:18:50.360 --> 2:18:52.080]  No, I said, let's say he's in Lord of the Rings
[2:18:52.080 --> 2:18:54.000]  and he's got to go into a goblin's nest.
[2:18:54.000 --> 2:18:57.080]  There's a kind of a goblin aid like Gollum
[2:18:57.080 --> 2:18:58.080]  that's going to lead him in.
[2:18:58.080 --> 2:19:00.680]  It doesn't mean that he gets in bed with a goblin.
[2:19:00.680 --> 2:19:01.960]  Doesn't mean he marries a goblin
[2:19:01.960 --> 2:19:03.400]  or has babies with goblins.
[2:19:03.400 --> 2:19:05.000]  He's going to have to have some rents,
[2:19:05.000 --> 2:19:07.280]  prebuses, golem-like creatures
[2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:10.280]  and other goblin-like creatures that are from Mordor
[2:19:10.280 --> 2:19:12.520]  that are going to have to lead him around and show him
[2:19:12.520 --> 2:19:15.040]  how to get stuff done, where the keys are,
[2:19:15.040 --> 2:19:17.880]  where the torches are, you know, how to get stuff done.
[2:19:17.880 --> 2:19:19.680]  And so that's what we see and we see him now
[2:19:19.680 --> 2:19:23.400]  delivering on his agenda and bringing in outsiders
[2:19:23.400 --> 2:19:26.440]  like Rex Tillerson, who is from the corporate world,
[2:19:26.440 --> 2:19:28.640]  getting stuff done from the real world,
[2:19:28.640 --> 2:19:30.040]  not the fictional world.
[2:19:30.040 --> 2:19:32.840]  And that's really scaring the power structure.
[2:19:32.840 --> 2:19:36.280]  No, I think Trump is intent on recruiting men and women
[2:19:36.280 --> 2:19:38.960]  whose focus has been making a profit
[2:19:38.960 --> 2:19:42.160]  for their business or for their customers.
[2:19:42.160 --> 2:19:44.240]  Someone who is bottom line oriented
[2:19:44.240 --> 2:19:46.200]  because of course, no one in government
[2:19:46.200 --> 2:19:47.680]  cares about the bottom line.
[2:19:47.680 --> 2:19:48.520]  Ever.
[2:19:48.520 --> 2:19:49.640]  Let's expand on this in a few minutes.
[2:19:49.640 --> 2:19:50.920]  We have left with Roger Stone,
[2:19:50.920 --> 2:19:52.520]  who is writing his epic book.
[2:19:52.520 --> 2:19:54.680]  I've already ordered 10,000 of them.
[2:19:54.680 --> 2:19:55.520]  That's how big.
[2:19:55.520 --> 2:19:56.640]  I think this book's going to be, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:19:56.640 --> 2:19:59.160]  we normally order like 500 of a book, okay?
[2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:00.520]  So this is going to be huge.
[2:20:00.520 --> 2:20:02.480]  Believe me, I've already been able to see some of it.
[2:20:02.480 --> 2:20:04.520]  It's going to be total inside baseball.
[2:20:04.520 --> 2:20:05.760]  Stephard, I can learn anywhere else.
[2:20:05.760 --> 2:20:07.440]  And he's only finishing it the next week or so.
[2:20:07.440 --> 2:20:09.160]  So you'll get right up until now.
[2:20:09.160 --> 2:20:11.720]  Now, obviously you've talked quite a bit to POTUS
[2:20:11.720 --> 2:20:13.080]  and I'll just leave it at that.
[2:20:13.080 --> 2:20:15.400]  Our president-elect, 45.
[2:20:15.400 --> 2:20:17.120]  What else can you impart to folks?
[2:20:17.120 --> 2:20:18.600]  Because that's, I have vice here.
[2:20:18.600 --> 2:20:20.040]  They've asked me twice.
[2:20:20.040 --> 2:20:21.200]  What about Goldman Sachs?
[2:20:21.200 --> 2:20:22.200]  What about Goldman Sachs?
[2:20:22.200 --> 2:20:23.320]  You say Goldman Sachs is bad.
[2:20:23.320 --> 2:20:25.800]  I say, wait, I have no me-prins on.
[2:20:25.800 --> 2:20:28.520]  As far as managing director, she exposes the globalists.
[2:20:28.520 --> 2:20:29.920]  They get the brightest people.
[2:20:29.920 --> 2:20:32.280]  It's the biggest brokerage bank,
[2:20:32.280 --> 2:20:34.880]  state-loaning bank in the world.
[2:20:34.880 --> 2:20:37.400]  Obviously, they've got the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[2:20:37.400 --> 2:20:42.200]  I don't like the heads of it, like Corzine and others,
[2:20:42.200 --> 2:20:44.840]  giving to gun control, giving to carbon taxes.
[2:20:44.840 --> 2:20:47.920]  I'd love to have Trump make them reform themselves,
[2:20:47.920 --> 2:20:49.760]  which the president could do.
[2:20:49.760 --> 2:20:52.120]  Obviously, if you're gonna get the top banking people,
[2:20:52.120 --> 2:20:55.600]  that's who you get to then make them carry out his will
[2:20:55.600 --> 2:20:57.240]  to make America great again.
[2:20:57.240 --> 2:20:59.440]  Now, if I see gun control or globalism,
[2:20:59.440 --> 2:21:00.800]  then I'm gonna go completely crazy.
[2:21:00.800 --> 2:21:02.880]  But so far we don't and you just,
[2:21:02.880 --> 2:21:04.920]  you haven't even told me that and that's amazing,
[2:21:04.920 --> 2:21:08.040]  this new info that he explained himself on that saying,
[2:21:08.040 --> 2:21:09.520]  they're gonna do my will.
[2:21:09.520 --> 2:21:11.040]  They're gonna carry out my agenda.
[2:21:11.040 --> 2:21:13.000]  So please elaborate.
[2:21:13.000 --> 2:21:15.880]  Well, Trump has throughout his entire career
[2:21:15.880 --> 2:21:17.600]  been a very good judge of character
[2:21:17.600 --> 2:21:21.120]  and selected exemplary people to work for him.
[2:21:21.120 --> 2:21:23.400]  And then he backs them up and gives them their head.
[2:21:23.400 --> 2:21:26.320]  This is the way he's always operated in business
[2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:28.360]  and it's worked very well for him.
[2:21:28.360 --> 2:21:31.360]  At the same time, making it clear that the agenda is his,
[2:21:31.360 --> 2:21:33.760]  that the objectives are his.
[2:21:33.760 --> 2:21:37.720]  And I think that's exactly what we have here.
[2:21:37.720 --> 2:21:41.320]  Meanwhile, he is now in Palm Beach,
[2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:44.720]  playing a little golf, getting some well-deserved R&R,
[2:21:44.720 --> 2:21:47.000]  but still working every day.
[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:50.560]  He is, I think was really pumped up about his trip
[2:21:50.560 --> 2:21:54.200]  to Alabama and the terrific outpouring there.
[2:21:54.200 --> 2:21:58.280]  We are looking at the inaugural with some excitement.
[2:21:58.280 --> 2:21:59.920]  You know, I don't know if you know this, Alex,
[2:21:59.920 --> 2:22:04.840]  but the deplorable, which was originally scheduled
[2:22:04.840 --> 2:22:07.720]  for the Clarendon Ballroom in Roslyn, Virginia.
[2:22:07.720 --> 2:22:10.360]  It got canceled and they would have copies of the fact.
[2:22:10.360 --> 2:22:15.360]  It has now been resurrected at the National Press Club,
[2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:17.800]  a larger and better venue.
[2:22:17.800 --> 2:22:20.160]  We can accommodate a thousand people.
[2:22:20.160 --> 2:22:22.160]  I will definitely be there.
[2:22:22.160 --> 2:22:24.240]  Alex, I'm inviting you.
[2:22:24.240 --> 2:22:25.440]  This is where the Patriots-
[2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:26.840]  I know, I wasn't gonna go.
[2:22:26.840 --> 2:22:28.840]  I kind of decided a week ago not to go
[2:22:28.840 --> 2:22:32.040]  just because it's just, I like to be in Texas.
[2:22:32.040 --> 2:22:33.240]  I like to be separate from DC,
[2:22:33.240 --> 2:22:35.320]  but I think I've gotta go to the deplorable.
[2:22:35.320 --> 2:22:36.480]  I know I've been invited to some other,
[2:22:36.480 --> 2:22:37.600]  obviously big functions,
[2:22:37.600 --> 2:22:39.520]  but my place would be out there in the crowds,
[2:22:39.520 --> 2:22:40.360]  battling the Communists,
[2:22:40.360 --> 2:22:41.480]  but I gotta be honest with you,
[2:22:41.480 --> 2:22:42.920]  I get sick of battling the Communists.
[2:22:42.920 --> 2:22:44.480]  You know what I mean?
[2:22:44.480 --> 2:22:47.920]  Well, there's something to be said for, you know,
[2:22:47.920 --> 2:22:50.640]  camaraderie with your fellow Patriots,
[2:22:50.640 --> 2:22:52.360]  because those are the Patriots.
[2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:55.280]  Absolutely, and there are some lovely Patriots as well.
[2:22:55.280 --> 2:22:58.000]  And those who've been in the vanguard of the Trump campaign
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:22:59.320]  will be at the deplorable,
[2:22:59.320 --> 2:23:02.960]  because we can't afford the $25,000 a ticket,
[2:23:02.960 --> 2:23:05.320]  events for the inaugural committee.
[2:23:05.320 --> 2:23:09.000]  So this is really the people's inaugural event.
[2:23:09.000 --> 2:23:09.840]  And if we're fortunate,
[2:23:09.840 --> 2:23:12.400]  some members of the Trump family may drop by.
[2:23:12.400 --> 2:23:14.000]  So I really urge you to make it.
[2:23:14.000 --> 2:23:15.560]  Now, I'm gonna be there, Roger, and I'm gonna be there,
[2:23:15.560 --> 2:23:18.120]  but I was gonna try to leave folks in suspense,
[2:23:18.120 --> 2:23:19.720]  but I just can't miss it.
[2:23:20.880 --> 2:23:22.520]  Now, I'm gonna let you go.
[2:23:22.520 --> 2:23:23.400]  I appreciate your time.
[2:23:23.400 --> 2:23:24.240]  Get some rest.
[2:23:24.240 --> 2:23:25.960]  I mean, I know you're texting me at 4 a.m.
[2:23:25.960 --> 2:23:27.520]  and you're texting me at 6 a.m.
[2:23:27.520 --> 2:23:30.040]  and you're working like 20 hours a day, 18 hours a day.
[2:23:30.040 --> 2:23:32.400]  How soon do the big books done?
[2:23:32.400 --> 2:23:36.120]  Well, I'm supposed to turn in a manuscript on Christmas.
[2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:37.880]  Then I've gotta do some editing
[2:23:37.880 --> 2:23:42.280]  with an idea to get it out the door by January 1st.
[2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:45.040]  Realistically, I would like to make it for the inauguration.
[2:23:45.040 --> 2:23:46.920]  That's what it's currently scheduled.
[2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:50.760]  Still shooting for that, but remains to be seen.
[2:23:50.760 --> 2:23:52.800]  I just would like to be first.
[2:23:52.800 --> 2:23:55.120]  This book will be historic.
[2:23:55.120 --> 2:23:57.640]  You're gonna learn things you cannot learn anywhere else
[2:23:57.640 --> 2:24:00.560]  about what really happened here.
[2:24:00.560 --> 2:24:03.560]  And this book will be popular with some people
[2:24:03.560 --> 2:24:05.720]  and not so popular with others.
[2:24:05.720 --> 2:24:07.640]  I don't wanna mention any names.
[2:24:07.640 --> 2:24:09.840]  I'm a Podesta, but there are people
[2:24:09.840 --> 2:24:12.920]  who aren't gonna like this book, Ted Cruz.
[2:24:12.920 --> 2:24:13.880]  And then there's some people
[2:24:13.880 --> 2:24:16.760]  who are gonna hate this book, Huma Abedin.
[2:24:16.760 --> 2:24:18.120]  So stay tuned.
[2:24:19.640 --> 2:24:21.560]  All right, and you always got such breaking news.
[2:24:21.560 --> 2:24:22.560]  We're going to Matt Bracken here
[2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:24.680]  on the Islamic attacks in Europe and more,
[2:24:24.680 --> 2:24:28.040]  but you've always got such other big, juicy exclusives.
[2:24:28.040 --> 2:24:30.440]  Any other juicy exclusives for us?
[2:24:30.440 --> 2:24:32.320]  I'm going back to the boards here, Alex,
[2:24:32.320 --> 2:24:33.840]  and do some writing,
[2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:35.520]  but there'll be plenty of revelations
[2:24:35.520 --> 2:24:36.680]  in the making of the president.
[2:24:36.680 --> 2:24:39.760]  And I thank you for ordering 10,000 copies.
[2:24:39.760 --> 2:24:41.440]  And I'm like, we're live and I'm not going to break.
[2:24:41.440 --> 2:24:42.760]  So I won't be able to talk to you until tonight.
[2:24:42.760 --> 2:24:44.160]  You'll probably be sleeping.
[2:24:44.160 --> 2:24:46.840]  Are we still planning on what we're planning next week?
[2:24:46.840 --> 2:24:49.400]  We are, and I will be with you tomorrow,
[2:24:49.400 --> 2:24:51.000]  I think in two segments.
[2:24:51.000 --> 2:24:52.480]  So I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:53.320]  All right, we'll talk then.
[2:24:53.320 --> 2:24:55.480]  Thank you, I'll see you back.
[2:24:55.480 --> 2:24:57.320]  Lots of stuff going on behind the scenes.
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:25:00.320]  All right, there goes Roger Stone from StoneCultury.com.
[2:25:00.320 --> 2:25:02.040]  We're getting Matt Bracken on the line right now.
[2:25:02.040 --> 2:25:03.080]  Be a video Skype as well
[2:25:03.080 --> 2:25:05.600]  to get some more hardcore Islamic attack news
[2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:07.840]  and smore your phone calls for Danny and Ryan and Amy
[2:25:07.840 --> 2:25:11.000]  and Rebecca and Rich and folks that are patiently holding.
[2:25:11.000 --> 2:25:12.640]  Briefly, I get so carried away.
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:14.240]  I don't even plug my sponsors.
[2:25:14.240 --> 2:25:16.880]  I want to plug, so this is for science and American,
[2:25:16.880 --> 2:25:19.800]  but I need to get the copy on that great folks as well.
[2:25:19.800 --> 2:25:23.560]  But we also fund ourselves independently here internally.
[2:25:23.560 --> 2:25:25.920]  And we bring in a lot more revenue when we discount stuff.
[2:25:25.920 --> 2:25:28.880]  That's why I already try to price stuff
[2:25:28.880 --> 2:25:30.200]  without a huge amount of profits.
[2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:31.200]  It's not that profits bad,
[2:25:31.200 --> 2:25:33.160]  but I want you to get a good value at a good price.
[2:25:33.160 --> 2:25:36.800]  So it's competitive, it's high quality,
[2:25:36.800 --> 2:25:40.400]  and so you get a big effect.
[2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:42.440]  So that's why we're doing this.
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:44.880]  And I just want to encourage all of you
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:48.200]  to take advantage of nutraceuticals
[2:25:48.200 --> 2:25:49.840]  that have changed my life
[2:25:49.840 --> 2:25:50.920]  and are just simply amazing.
[2:25:50.920 --> 2:25:53.200]  X2, having the good iodine in my body
[2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:55.280]  has totally changed my life.
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:25:58.240]  Having supermilvitality has completely changed it.
[2:25:58.240 --> 2:26:00.440]  The stem of the libido, the energy,
[2:26:00.440 --> 2:26:04.480]  the parasite cleanse, natural defense,
[2:26:04.480 --> 2:26:07.120]  the other products, the oxy powder, all of it
[2:26:07.120 --> 2:26:08.840]  are just the very best products out there.
[2:26:08.840 --> 2:26:11.160]  We go out and private label the already best products,
[2:26:11.160 --> 2:26:13.520]  best sellers out there that are the highest quality
[2:26:13.520 --> 2:26:14.360]  and then discount them.
[2:26:14.360 --> 2:26:17.080]  Or we go out and develop our own systems like DNA force,
[2:26:17.080 --> 2:26:19.440]  lung cleanse, and so many other products.
[2:26:19.440 --> 2:26:22.600]  Secret 12, biome defense are incredible.
[2:26:22.600 --> 2:26:24.240]  I mean, it's the very best.
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:26.920]  We have it in 250 billion cultures
[2:26:26.920 --> 2:26:31.760]  and 250 and 500 billion cultures,
[2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:35.080]  two different bottle sizes at infowarslife.com,
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:39.200]  prostaguard, just all of it, bone joint support,
[2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:42.120]  infowarslife.com, free shipping,
[2:26:42.120 --> 2:26:46.080]  50 to 30% off across the store.
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:49.200]  Hillary for President 2017 with George Soros as a goblin,
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:51.160]  saying to port him on the back.
[2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:54.280]  We've almost sold out of the Trump as my president red shirt.
[2:26:54.280 --> 2:26:56.040]  We've also got the new shirt,
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:26:59.160]  a public defense force, citizen press shirts.
[2:26:59.160 --> 2:27:01.160]  I haven't even talked about those new shirts
[2:27:01.160 --> 2:27:03.480]  that just came in and so much more.
[2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:06.080]  We have an entire Made in America line of apparel
[2:27:07.120 --> 2:27:09.640]  where it costs us like $10 to $15 a shirt
[2:27:09.640 --> 2:27:12.320]  that we sell for 25 or I can just pay for $3
[2:27:12.320 --> 2:27:15.360]  from a shirt from Mexico and sell it for 15 or 9.95.
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:17.600]  I mean, people just choose the stuff from Mexico
[2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:18.800]  or wherever, that's fine.
[2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:23.000]  We give you the choice, infowarsstore.com
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:26.880]  or call toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[2:27:26.880 --> 2:27:29.840]  That's triple eight, 253-3139.
[2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:34.160]  And again, my friends, we're under attack.
[2:27:34.160 --> 2:27:36.160]  A lot of folks would bitch and complain about it.
[2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:38.200]  I'm very proud of the fact that we have
[2:27:38.200 --> 2:27:40.200]  the entire state-run media attacking us,
[2:27:40.200 --> 2:27:41.680]  foreign media attacking us,
[2:27:41.680 --> 2:27:43.800]  the EU saying shut us down and block us,
[2:27:43.800 --> 2:27:45.840]  the communist Chinese attacking us.
[2:27:45.840 --> 2:27:47.560]  I mean, this is epic, this is legendary.
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:50.640]  We've gone from being huge to just gigantor
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:52.520]  in our footprint of resistance.
[2:27:52.520 --> 2:27:54.640]  We're still a tiny organization.
[2:27:54.640 --> 2:27:56.840]  The amount of funding we bring in for an organization
[2:27:56.840 --> 2:27:59.960]  this powerful is small.
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:02.480]  We're huge successes at reaching people,
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:05.320]  gigantic failures at raising capital.
[2:28:05.320 --> 2:28:07.880]  But we're still kings of raising capital
[2:28:09.440 --> 2:28:11.600]  in a system where the big corporations
[2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:15.280]  don't give sponsorship to anybody that supports freedom,
[2:28:15.280 --> 2:28:17.960]  that supports justice, that supports sovereignty,
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:20.440]  and who isn't quite frankly evil.
[2:28:20.440 --> 2:28:23.840]  So we direct sale products to you
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:25.920]  because we couldn't expand just off
[2:28:25.920 --> 2:28:27.480]  the small sponsors we had.
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:29.920]  I'm also very picky about sponsors.
[2:28:29.920 --> 2:28:34.000]  So again, we've been direct selling videos, books, things
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:37.040]  that I've produced and written for 20 years.
[2:28:37.040 --> 2:28:39.320]  But I've moved into other great products and things
[2:28:39.320 --> 2:28:41.320]  and we've really created a model here
[2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:43.480]  that everybody else is trying to copy.
[2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:46.800]  And I'm not bragging, that's the most sincere form of flattery.
[2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:51.600]  I was on national, private, Russian, libertarian TV
[2:28:51.600 --> 2:28:54.000]  that's on all over Russia with 40 million viewers a day
[2:28:54.000 --> 2:28:55.800]  today for an hour.
[2:28:55.800 --> 2:28:57.880]  And I was realizing when I was on the show
[2:28:57.880 --> 2:29:00.240]  that was like famous Russians were on the show,
[2:29:00.240 --> 2:29:02.280]  like advisors to Putin, you name it.
[2:29:02.280 --> 2:29:05.160]  And I was sitting there going, oh yeah, I know these guys.
[2:29:05.160 --> 2:29:07.760]  And they were there thanking me for the model
[2:29:07.760 --> 2:29:10.960]  and thanking me for changing the world paradigm.
[2:29:10.960 --> 2:29:14.600]  And it wasn't about my ego, but it was surreal to go,
[2:29:14.600 --> 2:29:16.000]  I better do a better job.
[2:29:16.000 --> 2:29:17.760]  Because see, I hate people thanking me
[2:29:17.760 --> 2:29:20.000]  because I'm sitting here thinking how I stumble,
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:22.480]  how I jibber, how I get obnoxious, how I...
[2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:23.960]  But people see the sincerity.
[2:29:23.960 --> 2:29:27.480]  And for whatever reason, we're kicking butt globally.
[2:29:27.480 --> 2:29:29.840]  This message, 1776 worldwide,
[2:29:29.840 --> 2:29:32.160]  is it about America and some conquest of other countries?
[2:29:32.160 --> 2:29:34.520]  It's about an idea of the renaissance
[2:29:34.520 --> 2:29:37.280]  that came out of America going global
[2:29:37.280 --> 2:29:39.280]  to defeat collectivism.
[2:29:39.280 --> 2:29:40.320]  Say what you want about America.
[2:29:40.320 --> 2:29:44.080]  We are the kings of free market renaissance in our heyday.
[2:29:44.080 --> 2:29:47.040]  We want to bring that back because it's back to the future.
[2:29:48.000 --> 2:29:51.840]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[2:29:51.840 --> 2:29:54.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:29:59.120 --> 2:30:01.280]  Facebook, Twitter and Google have now been sued
[2:30:01.280 --> 2:30:04.240]  by families of the victims of the Orlando nightclub shootings.
[2:30:04.240 --> 2:30:06.160]  The families of three victims are teaming up
[2:30:06.160 --> 2:30:08.400]  and suing the platforms for allegedly providing
[2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:10.560]  material support to the Islamic State.
[2:30:10.560 --> 2:30:13.160]  We have been reporting on ISIS or radical Islam's
[2:30:13.160 --> 2:30:15.040]  use of these social network platforms
[2:30:15.040 --> 2:30:17.000]  to recruit and spread its propaganda,
[2:30:17.000 --> 2:30:18.960]  mostly in the light of the hypocritical sense
[2:30:18.960 --> 2:30:21.080]  that you can be centered on Facebook or Twitter
[2:30:21.080 --> 2:30:23.720]  for being a conservative, sharing infowars links,
[2:30:23.720 --> 2:30:26.480]  speaking bad about Obama, or being a trough supporter.
[2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:29.760]  But somehow, magically, radical Islamic terror groups
[2:30:29.760 --> 2:30:32.680]  have managed to continue their usage of these platforms.
[2:30:32.680 --> 2:30:34.800]  But perhaps now, for these double standard
[2:30:34.800 --> 2:30:38.040]  hypocritical companies, the chickens are coming home to roost,
[2:30:38.040 --> 2:30:39.960]  as the lawsuit is now making its way
[2:30:39.960 --> 2:30:42.080]  to a federal court in eastern Michigan.
[2:30:42.080 --> 2:30:44.480]  This isn't the first time these companies have been sued.
[2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:47.160]  In June, the family of a victim of the Paris attacks
[2:30:47.160 --> 2:30:49.800]  sued Facebook, Twitter and Google for the same reason,
[2:30:49.800 --> 2:30:52.440]  allowing a terrorist group to radicalize people
[2:30:52.440 --> 2:30:55.720]  on their platform who eventually carry out deadly attacks.
[2:30:55.720 --> 2:30:58.880]  This is Owen Troyer for infowars.com.
[2:30:58.880 --> 2:31:00.120]  More than two years ago,
[2:31:00.120 --> 2:31:02.840]  Infowars first told you about our research
[2:31:02.840 --> 2:31:05.360]  into what has been called the iodine conspiracy.
[2:31:05.360 --> 2:31:07.960]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[2:31:07.960 --> 2:31:10.800]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ,
[2:31:10.800 --> 2:31:13.800]  and how the government knowingly started taking iodine
[2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:15.680]  out of the food and adding fluoride,
[2:31:15.680 --> 2:31:18.360]  the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[2:31:18.360 --> 2:31:20.120]  They took the good halogen out
[2:31:20.120 --> 2:31:22.040]  and put the deadly halogen in.
[2:31:22.040 --> 2:31:24.040]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened,
[2:31:24.040 --> 2:31:25.760]  as it still is worsening today,
[2:31:25.760 --> 2:31:28.920]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[2:31:28.920 --> 2:31:33.000]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:36.200]  concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[2:31:36.200 --> 2:31:38.320]  which many experts are now saying
[2:31:38.320 --> 2:31:41.880]  could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[2:31:41.880 --> 2:31:43.720]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[2:31:43.720 --> 2:31:45.200]  This is the real deal, folks,
[2:31:45.200 --> 2:31:47.960]  and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view,
[2:31:47.960 --> 2:31:50.000]  to any optimum health regimen.
[2:31:50.000 --> 2:31:54.320]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at infowarslife.com,

[2:32:01.240 --> 2:32:02.840]  It's like lightning in a bottle.
[2:32:02.840 --> 2:32:05.320]  We all have days in which we just can't seem to perform
[2:32:05.320 --> 2:32:06.680]  at the level we'd like to.
[2:32:06.680 --> 2:32:08.560]  Infowarslife Secret 12 is designed

[2:32:13.560 --> 2:32:14.680]  of vitamin B12.
[2:32:14.680 --> 2:32:16.240]  Proper vitamin and nutrient intake
[2:32:16.240 --> 2:32:19.640]  is essential to keep your body functioning at optimum levels.
[2:32:19.640 --> 2:32:22.440]  The reality is, it's hard to take in the proper amount
[2:32:22.440 --> 2:32:25.400]  of vitamins we need each day with our modern diets.
[2:32:25.400 --> 2:32:28.200]  Secret 12 by Infowarslife is an easy way
[2:32:28.200 --> 2:32:30.880]  to naturally upgrade your vitamin B12 intake
[2:32:30.880 --> 2:32:33.200]  and support your body's natural systems.
[2:32:33.200 --> 2:32:37.960]  It pairs two forms of vitamin B12 into one explosive formula.
[2:32:37.960 --> 2:32:40.160]  Vitamin B12 supports healthy energy levels
[2:32:40.160 --> 2:32:41.600]  through red blood cell formation
[2:32:41.600 --> 2:32:43.880]  and aiding in the body's natural processes,
[2:32:43.880 --> 2:32:46.960]  but it also assists with many other functions of the body.
[2:32:46.960 --> 2:32:48.680]  Electrify your mind and body
[2:32:48.680 --> 2:32:50.480]  and take your health to the next level.

[2:32:56.680 --> 2:33:01.680]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center
[2:33:01.680 --> 2:33:04.680]  in the heart of the resistance.
[2:33:04.680 --> 2:33:06.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:33:08.680 --> 2:33:11.680]  Yep, but through the storm, he'd come out on the other side.
[2:33:11.680 --> 2:33:12.680]  Blood on her hands.
[2:33:12.680 --> 2:33:14.680]  Drudge always knows how to boil it down.
[2:33:14.680 --> 2:33:16.680]  Berlin Market Massacre.
[2:33:16.680 --> 2:33:18.680]  It's been a long, long time.
[2:33:18.680 --> 2:33:20.680]  It's been a long, long time.
[2:33:20.680 --> 2:33:22.680]  It's been a long, long time.
[2:33:22.680 --> 2:33:24.680]  It's been a long, long time.
[2:33:24.680 --> 2:33:26.680]  Berlin Market Massacre.
[2:33:26.680 --> 2:33:29.680]  Ex-Nazi airport becomes refugee camp.
[2:33:29.680 --> 2:33:32.680]  This is war, says member of their parliament,
[2:33:32.680 --> 2:33:34.680]  says they're under Islamic attack,
[2:33:34.680 --> 2:33:38.680]  but we see the leading candidate in the polls
[2:33:38.680 --> 2:33:41.680]  for the new president or prime minister of the Netherlands
[2:33:41.680 --> 2:33:43.680]  being convicted.
[2:33:43.680 --> 2:33:44.680]  What was it, two weeks ago?
[2:33:44.680 --> 2:33:46.680]  Grit Wilders for simply saying,
[2:33:46.680 --> 2:33:48.680]  bringing in these Moroccans and people,
[2:33:48.680 --> 2:33:50.680]  the crime rate's going up.
[2:33:50.680 --> 2:33:52.680]  They've ordered in the Netherlands,
[2:33:52.680 --> 2:33:55.680]  Sweden, and in Deutschland
[2:33:55.680 --> 2:33:57.680]  to cover up crime statistics
[2:33:57.680 --> 2:34:01.680]  that almost all rapes are by the Islamists.
[2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:03.680]  Because in their culture,
[2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:05.680]  if a woman's not covered up,
[2:34:05.680 --> 2:34:06.680]  they're fair game.
[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:09.680]  Then if you rape her, she goes to prison.
[2:34:09.680 --> 2:34:12.680]  Again, this is everything that Matt Bracken
[2:34:12.680 --> 2:34:14.680]  has predicted.
[2:34:14.680 --> 2:34:16.680]  If you go to infowars.com,
[2:34:16.680 --> 2:34:18.680]  we have Paul Watson's boil down and breakdown of this.
[2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:20.680]  Now notice, first they said it was just a truck.
[2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:22.680]  It was an accident running over Christmas trees
[2:34:22.680 --> 2:34:25.680]  and 60-something people, critical and 12 dead.
[2:34:25.680 --> 2:34:28.680]  We had 80-something dead and niece and hundreds injured.
[2:34:28.680 --> 2:34:30.680]  They tried to cover that up as well.
[2:34:30.680 --> 2:34:33.680]  Like San Bernardino shooting people in front of the Christmas tree.
[2:34:33.680 --> 2:34:35.680]  The husband and wife, the FBI knew,
[2:34:35.680 --> 2:34:37.680]  was ordered to stand down two years before.
[2:34:37.680 --> 2:34:39.680]  They were going to the Middle East,
[2:34:39.680 --> 2:34:41.680]  going to Saudi Arabia,
[2:34:41.680 --> 2:34:43.680]  going to Pakistan for training.
[2:34:43.680 --> 2:34:45.680]  It's incredible.
[2:34:45.680 --> 2:34:47.680]  You go to Pakistan for training,
[2:34:47.680 --> 2:34:49.680]  you're a jihadi, you're on your Facebook,
[2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:51.680]  and the guy says,
[2:34:51.680 --> 2:34:53.680]  we're going to kick your ass out of the country.
[2:34:53.680 --> 2:34:55.680]  If you weren't natural born,
[2:34:55.680 --> 2:34:57.680]  I think we should strip your citizenship.
[2:34:57.680 --> 2:34:59.680]  You're a jihadi anchor, baby.
[2:34:59.680 --> 2:35:01.680]  We want to throw you and your family out of here
[2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:03.680]  back to one of the hell holes you came from
[2:35:03.680 --> 2:35:05.680]  where you're all killing each other.
[2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:07.680]  I am sick of this.
[2:35:07.680 --> 2:35:10.680]  Political correctness is not a suicide pact.
[2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:12.680]  So while Bracken's talking,
[2:35:12.680 --> 2:35:14.680]  we're going to show you what the media doesn't want you to see.
[2:35:14.680 --> 2:35:16.680]  Oh, they'll show you fake violence
[2:35:16.680 --> 2:35:18.680]  or occasional rare right wing violence all day.
[2:35:18.680 --> 2:35:20.680]  They don't want you to see these lamas
[2:35:20.680 --> 2:35:22.680]  running over people with trucks and all the rest of it.
[2:35:22.680 --> 2:35:24.680]  Just like this guy up in Ohio tried.
[2:35:24.680 --> 2:35:27.680]  When the cops shot him with the Somali stabbing people,
[2:35:27.680 --> 2:35:29.680]  the media said it was racist.
[2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:33.680]  So CNN called the act of care a truck crash again yesterday.
[2:35:33.680 --> 2:35:35.680]  That was going on.
[2:35:35.680 --> 2:35:38.680]  Berlin truck attacker identified a 23-year-old Pakistani refugee
[2:35:38.680 --> 2:35:40.680]  they found with blood all over him.
[2:35:40.680 --> 2:35:42.680]  But now they say they don't think it's him in the release thing.
[2:35:42.680 --> 2:35:44.680]  Because I guess it bring down Merkel.
[2:35:44.680 --> 2:35:46.680]  So there'll be a catch and release thing now.
[2:35:46.680 --> 2:35:48.680]  That's 100% guilty.
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:50.680]  That's just who the witnesses said and everybody and he's all bloody.
[2:35:50.680 --> 2:35:52.680]  And reportedly they said pulled out of the truck.
[2:35:52.680 --> 2:35:53.680]  But you know what?
[2:35:53.680 --> 2:35:55.680]  I'm sure the truck's megatron.
[2:35:55.680 --> 2:35:57.680]  It did it on its own.
[2:35:57.680 --> 2:35:59.680]  How low can you go?
[2:35:59.680 --> 2:36:02.680]  Ukrainian PM calls Russian ambassador's murder a hero.
[2:36:02.680 --> 2:36:05.680]  That's who Soros is installed in the Ukraine.
[2:36:05.680 --> 2:36:08.680]  CNN again responds to Islamic terror attack in Merlin
[2:36:08.680 --> 2:36:10.680]  by blaming conservatives.
[2:36:10.680 --> 2:36:12.680]  We didn't kiss their butts enough.
[2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:14.680]  We told them not to poop in the pool.
[2:36:14.680 --> 2:36:16.680]  These are Merkel's deaths.
[2:36:16.680 --> 2:36:20.680]  German MEP blames chancellor for refugee attack.
[2:36:20.680 --> 2:36:22.680]  Fake news.
[2:36:22.680 --> 2:36:25.680]  New York Times claims self-driving truck kills nine in Berlin.
[2:36:25.680 --> 2:36:26.680]  Yeah.
[2:36:26.680 --> 2:36:28.680]  Even though it wasn't true.
[2:36:28.680 --> 2:36:30.680]  They just make crap up.
[2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:32.680]  This is the enemy media.
[2:36:32.680 --> 2:36:36.680]  Merkel's open-door policy blame for Berlin truck attack.
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:38.680]  German state minister, we're in a state of war.
[2:36:38.680 --> 2:36:41.680]  The interim minister of the German state of Sarland
[2:36:41.680 --> 2:36:44.680]  said Tuesday Germany is in a state of war after a manned rubber truck
[2:36:44.680 --> 2:36:47.680]  do a crowd in Berlin Christmas market killing 12 people
[2:36:47.680 --> 2:36:49.680]  and injuring 48 and suspected terrorist attack.
[2:36:49.680 --> 2:36:53.680]  Beautiful carols, beautiful lights, beautiful trees.
[2:36:53.680 --> 2:36:56.680]  A cultural event running over people.
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:37:01.680]  And oh my gosh, the left Obama came out after the Ohio attack
[2:37:01.680 --> 2:37:02.680]  and said don't blame Islam.
[2:37:02.680 --> 2:37:04.680]  You don't blame a Somali who was here illegally
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:07.680]  who pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[2:37:07.680 --> 2:37:09.680]  Why do they hate us so much?
[2:37:09.680 --> 2:37:11.680]  Why is the left allied with them?
[2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:13.680]  And now that Trump got the electors.
[2:37:13.680 --> 2:37:16.680]  303 yesterday, 270 needed.
[2:37:16.680 --> 2:37:19.680]  More people went against Hillary than went against him.
[2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:20.680]  Notice how it backfired.
[2:37:20.680 --> 2:37:22.680]  Another repudiation of these people, they don't care.
[2:37:22.680 --> 2:37:24.680]  I don't think they're going away.
[2:37:24.680 --> 2:37:26.680]  I think they're going to plan something else.
[2:37:26.680 --> 2:37:29.680]  Let's get Matt Bracken's take on all this former Navy SEAL
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:32.680]  best-selling author who I didn't even know about
[2:37:32.680 --> 2:37:33.680]  until about a year and a half ago
[2:37:33.680 --> 2:37:35.680]  who got highly recommended by some of my Pentagon sources.
[2:37:35.680 --> 2:37:37.680]  And by the way, I can pick the phone up
[2:37:37.680 --> 2:37:40.680]  and call current high-level CIA, current Pentagon.
[2:37:40.680 --> 2:37:43.680]  I can pick up the phone and I'm not going to brag here.
[2:37:43.680 --> 2:37:44.680]  The media goes crazy with it.
[2:37:44.680 --> 2:37:45.680]  Everybody knows who I can talk to.
[2:37:45.680 --> 2:37:47.680]  Who I do talk to.
[2:37:47.680 --> 2:37:48.680]  Okay?
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:50.680]  And let's just say the reason that they talk to me
[2:37:50.680 --> 2:37:52.680]  is because they know who I talk to.
[2:37:52.680 --> 2:37:54.680]  And I've just been basically told that I've been adopted
[2:37:54.680 --> 2:37:56.680]  as a mouthpiece of what's really going on.
[2:37:56.680 --> 2:37:57.680]  I'm not told what to say.
[2:37:57.680 --> 2:37:59.680]  I know what's going on.
[2:37:59.680 --> 2:38:00.680]  Okay?
[2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:01.680]  I'm not bragging.
[2:38:01.680 --> 2:38:02.680]  I'm telling the listeners, you need to understand,
[2:38:02.680 --> 2:38:05.680]  the good news is we'd already be in martial law
[2:38:05.680 --> 2:38:08.680]  that wasn't for about 90% of the military being awake.
[2:38:08.680 --> 2:38:10.680]  And Trump, you know, has put all these generals in
[2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:13.680]  knowing they're planning a coup once he gets in there before.
[2:38:13.680 --> 2:38:15.680]  So people are going to say,
[2:38:15.680 --> 2:38:17.680]  oh, you're going to back fascism by Trump?
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:19.680]  Well, if they try to blow up the White House or something
[2:38:19.680 --> 2:38:21.680]  and he arrests a bunch of people, that's not fascism.
[2:38:21.680 --> 2:38:24.680]  We have the tyranny in our country.
[2:38:24.680 --> 2:38:25.680]  We're going to have to remove it.
[2:38:25.680 --> 2:38:28.680]  I don't want to arrest thousands of these people,
[2:38:28.680 --> 2:38:29.680]  but they're seditious.
[2:38:29.680 --> 2:38:30.680]  They're not going to stop.
[2:38:30.680 --> 2:38:32.680]  They're calling for killing the president-elect.
[2:38:32.680 --> 2:38:34.680]  I say arrest every damn one of them
[2:38:34.680 --> 2:38:35.680]  and charge them.
[2:38:35.680 --> 2:38:37.680]  If I called for killing the president, they'd arrest me,
[2:38:37.680 --> 2:38:38.680]  and they should.
[2:38:38.680 --> 2:38:42.680]  Matt Bracken, I mean, people need to understand from my view,
[2:38:42.680 --> 2:38:44.680]  we're in the middle of a civil war still.
[2:38:44.680 --> 2:38:45.680]  What do you say?
[2:38:45.680 --> 2:38:46.680]  Definitely.
[2:38:46.680 --> 2:38:47.680]  And it's a dangerous time.
[2:38:47.680 --> 2:38:50.680]  We did hold off their electoral coup.
[2:38:50.680 --> 2:38:52.680]  It even blew back when Hillary,
[2:38:52.680 --> 2:38:55.680]  where she lost more electoral votes than Trump did.
[2:38:55.680 --> 2:38:57.680]  But they won't give up.
[2:38:57.680 --> 2:38:58.680]  They never quit.
[2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:01.680]  You know, this is the red-green alliance.
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:04.680]  This is Islam in the left, a lie against civilization.
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:07.680]  We see it starkly in Germany.
[2:39:07.680 --> 2:39:11.680]  Even now, you know, they are afraid to name what it is,
[2:39:11.680 --> 2:39:13.680]  which is Islamic terror.
[2:39:13.680 --> 2:39:15.680]  Something that all Muslims need to know,
[2:39:15.680 --> 2:39:18.680]  all the quote-unquote moderate Muslims.
[2:39:18.680 --> 2:39:22.680]  People aren't stupid, even though the mainstream media portrayals
[2:39:22.680 --> 2:39:25.680]  might make it sound like we're blind and stupid.
[2:39:25.680 --> 2:39:28.680]  We understand there's no protesting going on.
[2:39:28.680 --> 2:39:31.680]  Millions come out to protest against Muhammad cartoons.
[2:39:31.680 --> 2:39:34.680]  They don't come out to protest against slaughter in the streets.
[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:36.680]  And the way that I look at it,
[2:39:36.680 --> 2:39:39.680]  the only difference between the moderate Muslims
[2:39:39.680 --> 2:39:42.680]  and the radical Muslims is that the moderate Muslims
[2:39:42.680 --> 2:39:45.680]  are just demographically planning to take over
[2:39:45.680 --> 2:39:49.680]  as the radicals, you know, are sort of the bad cop
[2:39:49.680 --> 2:39:52.680]  in a ongoing good cop-bad cop routine.
[2:39:52.680 --> 2:39:54.680]  The bad cops are blowing up buildings
[2:39:54.680 --> 2:39:57.680]  or, you know, driving over people with trucks.
[2:39:57.680 --> 2:40:01.680]  And then we're told, don't make the good Muslims mad.
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:03.680]  Just give them a little bit more.
[2:40:03.680 --> 2:40:06.680]  So what we're seeing now is the extinguishing of Christianity in Europe.
[2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:10.680]  You think there are going to be these Christmas festivals in Europe outside anymore?
[2:40:10.680 --> 2:40:15.680]  And notice the leftists are all trying to sue and ban Christmas trees.
[2:40:15.680 --> 2:40:17.680]  They say don't even hand out Christmas cards, which is your first amendment.
[2:40:17.680 --> 2:40:20.680]  They're now saying don't even use holiday in the colleges.
[2:40:20.680 --> 2:40:23.680]  The left is synced up trying to extinct Christianity.
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:27.680]  Well, this is, and this is the meaning of Islam.
[2:40:27.680 --> 2:40:29.680]  It's not peace, it's submission.
[2:40:29.680 --> 2:40:31.680]  Islam means submission.
[2:40:31.680 --> 2:40:33.680]  You'll get peace, theoretically,
[2:40:33.680 --> 2:40:36.680]  after the entire world has submitted to Islam,
[2:40:36.680 --> 2:40:38.680]  which I don't plan to do.
[2:40:38.680 --> 2:40:41.680]  You know, the other attack, though, I would like to mention a minute,
[2:40:41.680 --> 2:40:45.680]  the other attack in anchor of the policeman in his suit
[2:40:45.680 --> 2:40:48.680]  with his ID and his, you know, service pistol,
[2:40:48.680 --> 2:40:51.680]  I think that's got the elites way more freaked out
[2:40:51.680 --> 2:40:55.680]  than what happened at the Christmas fair in Berlin.
[2:40:55.680 --> 2:40:58.680]  Well, Russia thinks it's a false flag to try to,
[2:40:58.680 --> 2:41:00.680]  and my word from a high-level Pentagon source last week,
[2:41:00.680 --> 2:41:01.680]  and I went with it on air,
[2:41:01.680 --> 2:41:05.680]  is they're going to try to escalate the Syria thing before Obama leaves
[2:41:05.680 --> 2:41:07.680]  and that really try to start a bombing war against Russia.
[2:41:07.680 --> 2:41:09.680]  They're hoping they retaliate.
[2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:11.680]  The word is, and Russia said this,
[2:41:11.680 --> 2:41:13.680]  they're going to lay back and wait till Trump gets in.
[2:41:13.680 --> 2:41:15.680]  What's your intel?
[2:41:15.680 --> 2:41:19.680]  Well, I just want to continue on this thought about this assassin
[2:41:19.680 --> 2:41:21.680]  that's up on the screen right now.
[2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:23.680]  When the elites are worried,
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:25.680]  they're not worried about us getting run over in streets
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:27.680]  or blown up in a cafe.
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:28.680]  They could care less.
[2:41:28.680 --> 2:41:29.680]  We're the peasants.
[2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:31.680]  We're outside of the green zone.
[2:41:31.680 --> 2:41:35.680]  You know, we're living out in the hinterland in the Westworld.
[2:41:35.680 --> 2:41:38.680]  They're living inside of the protected perimeter.
[2:41:38.680 --> 2:41:41.680]  So when somebody in a suit and tie with a clean-shaven face
[2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:46.680]  walks up and shoots a Tier 1 ambassador in the head,
[2:41:46.680 --> 2:41:47.680]  that gets their attention.
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:49.680]  I'll call people's attention.
[2:41:49.680 --> 2:41:53.680]  Also, back to previous assassinations by security.
[2:41:53.680 --> 2:41:57.680]  Indira Gandhi was killed by a security guard.
[2:41:57.680 --> 2:41:59.680]  Anwar Sadat was killed by soldiers
[2:41:59.680 --> 2:42:02.680]  and jumped out of a truck during a pass-in review.
[2:42:02.680 --> 2:42:05.680]  So the elites, they start to freak out
[2:42:05.680 --> 2:42:07.680]  when they see their own security agents
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:09.680]  assassinating them from behind
[2:42:09.680 --> 2:42:11.680]  because they're all surrounded by security
[2:42:11.680 --> 2:42:12.680]  that they think they can cross.
[2:42:12.680 --> 2:42:13.680]  Well, sure.
[2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:14.680]  I mean, it's normally your security.
[2:42:14.680 --> 2:42:15.680]  People always ask, why don't you get security?
[2:42:15.680 --> 2:42:17.680]  And I said, it's usually your security that kills you.
[2:42:17.680 --> 2:42:19.680]  That's what people contract with to kill you.
[2:42:19.680 --> 2:42:23.680]  Yeah, and it's, yeah, they're not in all cases,
[2:42:23.680 --> 2:42:26.680]  but I mean, they are susceptible to being paid
[2:42:26.680 --> 2:42:27.680]  by the highest bidder.
[2:42:27.680 --> 2:42:28.680]  Well, look at R.F.K.
[2:42:28.680 --> 2:42:31.680]  I mean, that was when security killed him there in L.A., absolutely.
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:34.680]  But what do you think the overall message is?
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:37.680]  I mean, the jihadis, I guess, I mean, as you said,
[2:42:37.680 --> 2:42:39.680]  they're testing Merkel and others to make sure
[2:42:39.680 --> 2:42:41.680]  they sit there and cover up its Islam.
[2:42:41.680 --> 2:42:43.680]  That's part of their deal.
[2:42:43.680 --> 2:42:46.680]  Right. Well, if Merkel doesn't resign now,
[2:42:46.680 --> 2:42:48.680]  obviously she's never going to resign.
[2:42:48.680 --> 2:42:52.680]  If she's reelected, then put a fork in Germany.
[2:42:52.680 --> 2:42:54.680]  And as Germany goes, Europe goes.
[2:42:54.680 --> 2:42:57.680]  I read something for Gates of Vienna last year
[2:42:57.680 --> 2:42:59.680]  about hybrid vigor.
[2:42:59.680 --> 2:43:02.680]  I don't worry about Germans,
[2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:05.680]  but I worry a lot about Islamized Germans,
[2:43:05.680 --> 2:43:06.680]  super Germans.
[2:43:06.680 --> 2:43:10.680]  It was the burbers of Morocco that invaded Spain
[2:43:10.680 --> 2:43:14.680]  after they were Islamized and had that convert zeal.
[2:43:14.680 --> 2:43:16.680]  It wasn't the skinny little desert Arabs.
[2:43:16.680 --> 2:43:20.680]  It was the burbers of Morocco after they had become Islamized.
[2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:23.680]  I fear what will happen when Germans are Islamized.
[2:43:23.680 --> 2:43:25.680]  You know, and all of these German lesbians
[2:43:25.680 --> 2:43:29.680]  are suddenly having five or six children like it or not
[2:43:29.680 --> 2:43:31.680]  that are going to be raised to Muslim.
[2:43:31.680 --> 2:43:33.680]  In one or two generations,
[2:43:33.680 --> 2:43:35.680]  Germany could become a powerhouse of Europe
[2:43:35.680 --> 2:43:37.680]  in a very bad way.
[2:43:37.680 --> 2:43:40.680]  Oh, by the way, Islam, I mean, we've got top imams saying
[2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:42.680]  we're going to take the women.
[2:43:42.680 --> 2:43:44.680]  We're going to make our new super Islam people.
[2:43:44.680 --> 2:43:45.680]  Ha, ha, ha, the men are pigs.
[2:43:45.680 --> 2:43:47.680]  They're cowards. They give us their women.
[2:43:47.680 --> 2:43:49.680]  I mean, they're so fucking arrogant.
[2:43:49.680 --> 2:43:52.680]  Right. But there are heroes in Europe like Gert Wilders.
[2:43:52.680 --> 2:43:56.680]  And, you know, he is very similar to Trump in this respect.
[2:43:56.680 --> 2:43:59.680]  He understands the media jujitsu.
[2:43:59.680 --> 2:44:01.680]  A year ago, people thought Trump was an idiot
[2:44:01.680 --> 2:44:05.680]  for, you know, going face to face with the mainstream media
[2:44:05.680 --> 2:44:07.680]  in ways that weren't flattering to him.
[2:44:07.680 --> 2:44:10.680]  You know, putting out tweets that people said were stupid
[2:44:10.680 --> 2:44:11.680]  or blunders.
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:13.680]  But he was appealing to Joe Blukoller.
[2:44:13.680 --> 2:44:15.680]  He was appealing to middle America.
[2:44:15.680 --> 2:44:17.680]  And Gert Wilders is doing the same thing.
[2:44:17.680 --> 2:44:22.680]  So when these left-wing politicized judges in Holland
[2:44:22.680 --> 2:44:26.680]  convict Gert Wilders of saying nasty things about Moroccans,
[2:44:26.680 --> 2:44:28.680]  that just makes him more popular.
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:32.680]  So he's understanding this populist jujitsu
[2:44:32.680 --> 2:44:35.680]  the way that Trump did, the way that the left in this country
[2:44:35.680 --> 2:44:37.680]  is still trying to figure out.
[2:44:37.680 --> 2:44:40.680]  They're still trying to, you know, go back to the old playbook,
[2:44:40.680 --> 2:44:43.680]  let's blame it on the Russians or blame it on fake news.
[2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:45.680]  They still don't know what's hitting them.
[2:44:45.680 --> 2:44:47.680]  So there's still a lot of room out here
[2:44:47.680 --> 2:44:49.680]  for the populist jujitsu experts.
[2:44:49.680 --> 2:44:53.680]  And I hope the best for Wilders in Holland
[2:44:53.680 --> 2:44:57.680]  I think his election is in March, February or March.
[2:44:57.680 --> 2:45:00.680]  So we should see a very interesting 2017.
[2:45:00.680 --> 2:45:03.680]  And remember also, in Germany and across Europe,
[2:45:03.680 --> 2:45:06.680]  it's only because of the luck and incompetence
[2:45:06.680 --> 2:45:07.680]  on the part of these terrorists
[2:45:07.680 --> 2:45:10.680]  that there aren't attacks like last night, weekly.
[2:45:10.680 --> 2:45:12.680]  And there was a 12-year-old about a week ago
[2:45:12.680 --> 2:45:15.680]  who was trying to take a nail bomb into another festival.
[2:45:15.680 --> 2:45:17.680]  You know, if that had gone off,
[2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:19.680]  it would have been another mass process.
[2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:22.680]  I was told by sources a year ago, it was Christmas again,
[2:45:22.680 --> 2:45:24.680]  and then also about six months ago,
[2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:28.680]  oh, the Germans keep busting them with big plastic explosive bombs
[2:45:28.680 --> 2:45:30.680]  that somebody's giving them in ambulances
[2:45:30.680 --> 2:45:32.680]  instead of trying to get them into sporting events
[2:45:32.680 --> 2:45:34.680]  to blow up a whole crowd.
[2:45:34.680 --> 2:45:36.680]  And sure enough, then it came out in the news
[2:45:36.680 --> 2:45:39.680]  that they've busted other ones trying to blow up soccer events.
[2:45:39.680 --> 2:45:41.680]  So, man...
[2:45:41.680 --> 2:45:44.680]  Yeah, they're trying to...
[2:45:44.680 --> 2:45:46.680]  When they owned Mosul,
[2:45:46.680 --> 2:45:51.680]  they had a university in an oil region in northern Iraq.
[2:45:51.680 --> 2:45:53.680]  And for a couple of years,
[2:45:53.680 --> 2:46:00.680]  they were churning out university laboratory-level chemists
[2:46:00.680 --> 2:46:02.680]  trained in just one thing,
[2:46:02.680 --> 2:46:07.680]  making the peroxide explosive
[2:46:07.680 --> 2:46:11.680]  so that they can then go to Europe and become teachers.
[2:46:11.680 --> 2:46:19.680]  If you know how to make the try peroxide formula,
[2:46:19.680 --> 2:46:21.680]  all you need to do is buy bulk stuff
[2:46:21.680 --> 2:46:23.680]  that you can buy at cosmetology stores
[2:46:23.680 --> 2:46:25.680]  and supermarkets and so forth,
[2:46:25.680 --> 2:46:28.680]  and you can make something as powerful as C4.
[2:46:28.680 --> 2:46:31.680]  That's what blew up the bus in the subway in London.
[2:46:31.680 --> 2:46:33.680]  And the train in Madrid. It's very powerful.
[2:46:33.680 --> 2:46:35.680]  It doesn't have a great shelf life.
[2:46:35.680 --> 2:46:38.680]  It's hard to work with, but it's extremely powerful.
[2:46:38.680 --> 2:46:41.680]  And they've got now dozens, if not hundreds,
[2:46:41.680 --> 2:46:43.680]  of these chemists in Europe.
[2:46:43.680 --> 2:46:45.680]  Let me ask you this question.
[2:46:45.680 --> 2:46:47.680]  What is the master plan of the left
[2:46:47.680 --> 2:46:49.680]  to bring in 5 million of these people in Europe,
[2:46:49.680 --> 2:46:52.680]  or not vet them, get them in as sleeper cells?
[2:46:52.680 --> 2:46:55.680]  Because from my study, they don't totally control the Islamists.
[2:46:55.680 --> 2:46:59.680]  They have some control through rogue groups in MI6,
[2:46:59.680 --> 2:47:01.680]  the Israelis, and the CIA.
[2:47:01.680 --> 2:47:04.680]  Well, I think that they're evil, of course.
[2:47:04.680 --> 2:47:07.680]  But the more naive ones might think
[2:47:07.680 --> 2:47:10.680]  that they're going to just ride the tiger of Islam
[2:47:10.680 --> 2:47:14.680]  and then in the wreckage of Europe, establish communism.
[2:47:14.680 --> 2:47:17.680]  Sure. They're just taking money from Saudi Arabia now
[2:47:17.680 --> 2:47:19.680]  because they can live in a bigger apartment
[2:47:19.680 --> 2:47:21.680]  or drive a Ferrari.
[2:47:21.680 --> 2:47:23.680]  The better example, the better paradigm,
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:25.680]  is Carlos de Jackal,
[2:47:25.680 --> 2:47:29.680]  who actually wrote a biography from his prison in France
[2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:31.680]  where he is converted to Islam.
[2:47:31.680 --> 2:47:35.680]  He was a communist, Bader Meinhoff type guy in the 60s and 70s.
[2:47:35.680 --> 2:47:37.680]  He converted to Islam,
[2:47:37.680 --> 2:47:40.680]  and he actually wrote a letter to President Obama,
[2:47:40.680 --> 2:47:42.680]  which was published, which is pretty amazing,
[2:47:42.680 --> 2:47:46.680]  saying that only an alliance between
[2:47:46.680 --> 2:47:49.680]  the left and Islam will ever be powerful enough
[2:47:49.680 --> 2:47:51.680]  to destroy capitalism and the West.
[2:47:51.680 --> 2:47:52.680]  Sure. Let's be clear.
[2:47:52.680 --> 2:47:54.680]  The left hates their smartphones, their money,
[2:47:54.680 --> 2:47:56.680]  their great medicine, everything so much,
[2:47:56.680 --> 2:47:58.680]  and they love wearing Shegwavarra shirts,
[2:47:58.680 --> 2:48:00.680]  so much that they would ally with something
[2:48:00.680 --> 2:48:02.680]  that literally keeps women as animals,
[2:48:02.680 --> 2:48:06.680]  all because they have some weird hate of the West
[2:48:06.680 --> 2:48:09.680]  and so the mental illness that was implanted in them,
[2:48:09.680 --> 2:48:11.680]  where the hell does this come from?
[2:48:11.680 --> 2:48:14.680]  But when it gets to, you know,
[2:48:14.680 --> 2:48:17.680]  not cutting time, when it gets to head shopping time,
[2:48:17.680 --> 2:48:20.680]  history shows conclusively that these guys,
[2:48:20.680 --> 2:48:23.680]  like Carlos de Jackal, they take the easy way
[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:24.680]  and convert to Islam.
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:27.680]  Because remember, if you're a totalitarian bastard
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:30.680]  and you're a man, Islam's not a bad deal.
[2:48:30.680 --> 2:48:34.680]  You get to beat your old lady, you get to rape children,
[2:48:34.680 --> 2:48:39.680]  marry your cousin's daughter who's 13 years old,
[2:48:39.680 --> 2:48:41.680]  and beat her if she doesn't put out.
[2:48:41.680 --> 2:48:46.680]  I mean, for an evil man, Islam is a pretty easy conversion
[2:48:46.680 --> 2:48:48.680]  from being an evil communist.
[2:48:48.680 --> 2:48:51.680]  Now, the Kami women, they're the ones that are going to wake up
[2:48:51.680 --> 2:48:53.680]  in a burqa wondering what the heck happened to them.
[2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:56.680]  You know, these German women that aren't making babies
[2:48:56.680 --> 2:48:58.680]  will be making babies whether they like it or not
[2:48:58.680 --> 2:49:01.680]  if, you know, when Islam succeeds with their,
[2:49:01.680 --> 2:49:05.680]  you know, five babies per woman birth rate
[2:49:05.680 --> 2:49:07.680]  compared to 1.1, which is a free place.
[2:49:07.680 --> 2:49:10.680]  I know. How did the West teach suicide to its people?
[2:49:10.680 --> 2:49:12.680]  It's just crazy to watch.
[2:49:12.680 --> 2:49:16.680]  Yeah, you have to go back to Antonio Gramsci
[2:49:16.680 --> 2:49:21.680]  and the Frankfurt group and the, who are the guys in England,
[2:49:21.680 --> 2:49:25.680]  the, anyway, the communists of the early 20th century.
[2:49:25.680 --> 2:49:27.680]  The Fabians, socialists, all of them.
[2:49:27.680 --> 2:49:30.680]  The Fabians, it's going to be the long march
[2:49:30.680 --> 2:49:32.680]  through the institutions.
[2:49:32.680 --> 2:49:33.680]  That was the way that worked.
[2:49:33.680 --> 2:49:34.680]  No, they said it and they've conquered us
[2:49:34.680 --> 2:49:36.680]  and now they just want to, the weird thing is,
[2:49:36.680 --> 2:49:38.680]  they took over, they run everything.
[2:49:38.680 --> 2:49:41.680]  Why would they want to then blow it up?
[2:49:41.680 --> 2:49:44.680]  Well, they thought that they could establish communism,
[2:49:44.680 --> 2:49:49.680]  but as communism has been defeated and pushed back,
[2:49:49.680 --> 2:49:53.680]  the only thing that they've got left is this alliance with Islam.
[2:49:53.680 --> 2:49:57.680]  And this is, you know, a word of warning to women.
[2:49:57.680 --> 2:50:01.680]  The men who preach communism and pivot to Islam
[2:50:01.680 --> 2:50:05.680]  aren't going to see a big decrease in their lifestyle.
[2:50:05.680 --> 2:50:08.680]  They may have two or three women after that.
[2:50:08.680 --> 2:50:13.680]  The women who think that they're going to stick with communism
[2:50:13.680 --> 2:50:15.680]  are the real fools in this,
[2:50:15.680 --> 2:50:16.680]  because they're going to wind up in a harem
[2:50:16.680 --> 2:50:20.680]  wearing a burqa, having five babies, like it or not.
[2:50:20.680 --> 2:50:21.680]  I know, it's so crazy.
[2:50:21.680 --> 2:50:23.680]  They'll only be allowed out if you're a piranha
[2:50:23.680 --> 2:50:25.680]  that worships it and helps keep the other women in line.
[2:50:25.680 --> 2:50:27.680]  You'll be kind of the house slave.
[2:50:27.680 --> 2:50:29.680]  We're going to break, come back, take a few final calls
[2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:31.680]  and then five minutes to the next hour, a few calls
[2:50:31.680 --> 2:50:32.680]  and hand them a ton of Paul Watson.
[2:50:32.680 --> 2:50:37.680]  And I said earlier, I'll get into the big, you know, white man's guilt secret.
[2:50:37.680 --> 2:50:38.680]  They're spending this whole thing like,
[2:50:38.680 --> 2:50:40.680]  oh, minorities, it's your time to take over America
[2:50:40.680 --> 2:50:42.680]  and you've got to be communists now or socialists.
[2:50:42.680 --> 2:50:43.680]  That's how you're rebellious.
[2:50:43.680 --> 2:50:44.680]  It's your country.
[2:50:44.680 --> 2:50:48.680]  Don't you want free market right in self-defense family?
[2:50:48.680 --> 2:50:49.680]  The globalists hate you.
[2:50:49.680 --> 2:50:50.680]  Adopt free market.
[2:50:50.680 --> 2:50:51.680]  Be wealthy.
[2:50:51.680 --> 2:50:52.680]  Be successful.
[2:50:52.680 --> 2:50:55.680]  Don't buy into the globalist paradigm.
[2:50:55.680 --> 2:50:58.680]  It's so incredible.

[2:51:41.680 --> 2:51:44.680]  When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag.

[2:52:05.680 --> 2:52:10.680]  A gift that provides a great foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[2:52:10.680 --> 2:52:18.680]  A big Berkey water filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals, chlorine, fluoride, pesticides, and herbicides, VOCs, and more.
[2:52:18.680 --> 2:52:23.680]  Best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[2:52:23.680 --> 2:52:27.680]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require,
[2:52:27.680 --> 2:52:32.680]  and are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water.

[2:52:57.680 --> 2:53:00.680]  Taking turmeric is good, but there's a problem with it.
[2:53:00.680 --> 2:53:06.680]  The active ingredient in turmeric, known as curcumin, is poorly absorbed into the cells due to its large particle size.
[2:53:06.680 --> 2:53:10.680]  But now, one planet nutrition has the answer for this powerful anti-inflammatory.

[2:54:01.680 --> 2:54:04.680]  Alright, we have two more segments left and Paul Watts has taken over from London, England.
[2:54:04.680 --> 2:54:05.680]  I just want to say this.
[2:54:05.680 --> 2:54:09.680]  The real discussion going on with white people that I know that are successful in business and life,
[2:54:09.680 --> 2:54:12.680]  most of them are married to somebody of another quote, race, just a human race.
[2:54:12.680 --> 2:54:18.680]  And a lot of them are, you know, whites are now 16th or 17th in mobility economically.
[2:54:18.680 --> 2:54:21.680]  Certainly you can say things were geared towards whites 50 years ago or whatever.
[2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:25.680]  But most white folks have gotten spoiled or their kids are spoiled.
[2:54:25.680 --> 2:54:27.680]  That's why we're not upwardly mobile.
[2:54:27.680 --> 2:54:33.680]  It's, you know, Christian Lebanese or Chinese or whatever that you see at the top of the chart.
[2:54:33.680 --> 2:54:37.680]  But they sell this idea that white people existing is why you're poor
[2:54:37.680 --> 2:54:41.680]  instead of wanting to find out why there was so much wealth and get involved in free market.
[2:54:41.680 --> 2:54:45.680]  And that's the establishment wanting a permanent underclass.
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:47.680]  And they write white papers on it, they admit it.
[2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:51.680]  And that's what's so dashardly about this is they claim they want you to be successful,
[2:54:51.680 --> 2:54:53.680]  but they really just want to control you.
[2:54:53.680 --> 2:54:57.680]  And so now the discussions are, well, the white people didn't have kids and aborted all their kids.
[2:54:57.680 --> 2:55:00.680]  We really all need to really try, even though we're not in power,
[2:55:00.680 --> 2:55:06.680]  to try to educate people from the third world that never had this so the Americana future can go on.
[2:55:06.680 --> 2:55:08.680]  Because people always want to pass something on.
[2:55:08.680 --> 2:55:12.680]  It's like these, the allegory of a fiction, you know, the Grand Torino,
[2:55:12.680 --> 2:55:13.680]  he didn't like his family.
[2:55:13.680 --> 2:55:14.680]  So he, they're all spoiled rotten brats.
[2:55:14.680 --> 2:55:18.680]  So he, you know, gives his car away, you know, you know, to the kid he liked next door.
[2:55:18.680 --> 2:55:20.680]  And, you know, it's kind of that way.
[2:55:20.680 --> 2:55:22.680]  You can inherit the West if you want it.
[2:55:22.680 --> 2:55:24.680]  But my God, let's not give it to radical Islam.
[2:55:24.680 --> 2:55:26.680]  Matt Bracken is our guest.
[2:55:26.680 --> 2:55:30.680]  We should also probably give you his website as well.
[2:55:30.680 --> 2:55:32.680]  Enemiesfarnedomestic.com.
[2:55:32.680 --> 2:55:37.680]  The Gates of Vienna also is another great site that his work appears on to find his books.
[2:55:37.680 --> 2:55:43.680]  Ryan in Wyoming, thanks for holding her on the air.
[2:55:43.680 --> 2:55:53.680]  First of all, I just wanted to say, I believe the answer is sovereign men and women and sovereign households becoming self.
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:54.680]  Self-sufficient.
[2:55:54.680 --> 2:56:00.680]  And your store, your product, X2 water filters, everybody needs to get them.
[2:56:00.680 --> 2:56:05.680]  The point I wanted to bring up was the Tet 2 offensive.
[2:56:05.680 --> 2:56:10.680]  In December of 2015, there were hundreds of propane tanks that were stolen.
[2:56:10.680 --> 2:56:16.680]  Also at the same time, there were hundreds of cell phones that were sold.
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:20.680]  And I just wanted to get Mr. Bracken's and-
[2:56:20.680 --> 2:56:21.680]  Well, sure.
[2:56:21.680 --> 2:56:28.680]  Clearly there are jihad bases all over the country as sleeper cells that I guess the left can just give its nod and they'll start blowing stuff up.
[2:56:28.680 --> 2:56:31.680]  It's like the secret army that they bring in martial law afterwards.
[2:56:31.680 --> 2:56:33.680]  But if Obama's going to do that, he's got 30 days.
[2:56:33.680 --> 2:56:34.680]  Thank you for the call.
[2:56:34.680 --> 2:56:35.680]  That's my point, Ryan.
[2:56:35.680 --> 2:56:37.680]  Mr. Bracken, what do you say to that?
[2:56:37.680 --> 2:56:41.680]  Well, it can't rule anything out in terms of that timing.
[2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:51.680]  But if an attack of sufficient magnitude happens even under President Trump, it really wouldn't be that much of a different outcome.
[2:56:51.680 --> 2:57:03.680]  If there's, say, a grid attack, even just a simple kinetic rifle attack against enough power substations, putting this country into a grid down scenario is going to be ugly no matter who's in charge.
[2:57:03.680 --> 2:57:05.680]  Same thing with crashing the economy.
[2:57:05.680 --> 2:57:11.680]  Some kind of a cyber attack that tanks out our banking system, you know, destroys the EBT system.
[2:57:11.680 --> 2:57:15.680]  It wouldn't matter if Thomas Jefferson or George Washington are in charge.
[2:57:15.680 --> 2:57:20.680]  There's not going to be an easy solution if the lights go out and our cities explode.
[2:57:20.680 --> 2:57:26.680]  And Soros has doubled the amount of money to domestic destabilization operations showing they're planning something big.
[2:57:26.680 --> 2:57:27.680]  Right.
[2:57:27.680 --> 2:57:29.680]  And the media is going to continue to be their cheerleader.
[2:57:29.680 --> 2:57:39.680]  I've been watching the media and the only time that you see anything like a hate crime is, are these fake hoaxes, the hoaxes, you know, the hijab babes that always turn out to be hoaxes.
[2:57:39.680 --> 2:57:43.680]  I mean, every case of Islamists being attacked in America turns out to be fake.
[2:57:43.680 --> 2:57:45.680]  But the media never shows that at all.
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:49.680]  Instead, they'll show some, you know, frat brother alleged incident.
[2:57:49.680 --> 2:57:51.680]  The attacks on Islam at record levels.
[2:57:51.680 --> 2:57:52.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:57:52.680 --> 2:57:53.680]  It's totally sick.
[2:57:53.680 --> 2:57:56.680]  Well, they've been apologizing for the latest Jihad attack.
[2:57:56.680 --> 2:57:59.680]  But the thing is, their power is slipping.
[2:57:59.680 --> 2:58:01.680]  And, you know, Drudge is right.
[2:58:01.680 --> 2:58:03.680]  You are right.
[2:58:03.680 --> 2:58:05.680]  Other other people talking about this are right.
[2:58:05.680 --> 2:58:07.680]  The media is a song, Julian Assange.
[2:58:07.680 --> 2:58:08.680]  He's certainly right.
[2:58:08.680 --> 2:58:09.680]  He says they have less and less credit.
[2:58:09.680 --> 2:58:11.680]  I mean, they just have no pertinence.
[2:58:11.680 --> 2:58:12.680]  They just aren't even on the radar.
[2:58:12.680 --> 2:58:13.680]  No, that's right.
[2:58:13.680 --> 2:58:16.680]  You're your your star is rising and theirs is slipping.
[2:58:16.680 --> 2:58:17.680]  They just don't.
[2:58:17.680 --> 2:58:19.680]  It's a fun start to be rising, but we're doing our duty.
[2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:21.680]  It's the audience spreading the word, spreading the videos.
[2:58:21.680 --> 2:58:25.680]  People now realize, I mean, look, the globalist painted total takeover of the country and basically reeducation.
[2:58:25.680 --> 2:58:27.680]  Telling us what words to use.
[2:58:27.680 --> 2:58:29.680]  So, of course, there was a resistance to that.
[2:58:29.680 --> 2:58:35.680]  And now, if the if the if the controllers want to go to the next level, my God, they're going to get their ass stomped.
[2:58:35.680 --> 2:58:39.680]  Back in 70 seconds, we're going to talk to a couple more callers here.
[2:58:39.680 --> 2:58:41.680]  Adam in New York and others with Matt Brack.
[2:58:41.680 --> 2:58:44.680]  And then Paul Watson takes over from London.
[2:58:44.680 --> 2:58:48.680]  Radio Network.
[2:58:48.680 --> 2:58:49.680]  Not a group.
[2:58:49.680 --> 2:58:50.680]  You developed living defense for us.
[2:58:50.680 --> 2:58:51.680]  It took you over a year to do it.
[2:58:51.680 --> 2:58:52.680]  Why is this so good?
[2:58:52.680 --> 2:58:57.680]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[2:58:57.680 --> 2:59:03.680]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[2:59:03.680 --> 2:59:11.680]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[2:59:11.680 --> 2:59:17.680]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[2:59:17.680 --> 2:59:19.680]  These are all parasites.
[2:59:19.680 --> 2:59:21.680]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[2:59:21.680 --> 2:59:22.680]  You have the neem in there.
[2:59:22.680 --> 2:59:25.680]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[2:59:25.680 --> 2:59:29.680]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[2:59:29.680 --> 2:59:32.680]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[2:59:32.680 --> 2:59:33.680]  It just came back in yesterday.
[2:59:33.680 --> 2:59:35.680]  Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[2:59:35.680 --> 2:59:36.680]  And folks, you can't lose.
[2:59:36.680 --> 2:59:38.680]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[2:59:38.680 --> 2:59:42.680]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[2:59:42.680 --> 2:59:44.680]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[2:59:44.680 --> 2:59:47.680]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[2:59:47.680 --> 2:59:52.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:00:17.680 --> 3:00:30.680]  All right, Adam, you're on the air with Matt Bracken.
[3:00:30.680 --> 3:00:31.680]  Welcome, my friend.
[3:00:31.680 --> 3:00:32.680]  Go ahead.
[3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:33.680]  Hi, Alex.
[3:00:33.680 --> 3:00:36.680]  Thanks for taking my call.
[3:00:36.680 --> 3:00:41.680]  Pretty much my main concern is with Obama, the transfer of power.
[3:00:41.680 --> 3:00:50.680]  I was wondering if you think he'll try to engineer a situation where, you know, he's got to make the excuse that he can't handle our power.
[3:00:50.680 --> 3:00:55.680]  I don't know if that would be worth Russia or Syria, some sort of economic.
[3:00:55.680 --> 3:00:57.680]  We're already trying to start an impeachment.
[3:00:57.680 --> 3:01:00.680]  And they've got the Republican establishment wanting to do that as well.
[3:01:00.680 --> 3:01:03.680]  So Trump's got to just race to get as much prosperity back into the country as he can.
[3:01:03.680 --> 3:01:07.680]  But he's in a race against global economic meltdown that was already beginning.
[3:01:07.680 --> 3:01:10.680]  So Matt, you got any comments on that?
[3:01:10.680 --> 3:01:11.680]  I'm not exactly right.
[3:01:11.680 --> 3:01:14.680]  I mean, I can't say more than what you just said.
[3:01:14.680 --> 3:01:18.680]  Prosperity is the best propaganda, for sure.
[3:01:18.680 --> 3:01:21.680]  Like what I was watching Salenti before, he's absolutely right.
[3:01:21.680 --> 3:01:24.680]  Nothing's going to breed success like economic success.
[3:01:24.680 --> 3:01:31.680]  The problem is, you know, that the takedown could be at a global scale and even Donald Trump.
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:38.680]  And no matter who's in charge, no matter what his great policies are, if there's a global economic crash, Trump will be called the Hoover.
[3:01:38.680 --> 3:01:43.680]  You know, the person that brought on the crash and Obama will be the wise man.
[3:01:43.680 --> 3:01:47.680]  That's why it's important to let Soros and the globalists and all of them know the Davos crew.
[3:01:47.680 --> 3:01:48.680]  We're watching you.
[3:01:48.680 --> 3:01:49.680]  We know your tricks.
[3:01:49.680 --> 3:01:51.680]  You're going to be held accountable.
[3:01:51.680 --> 3:01:54.680]  Don't think you're going to run off during New Zealand during some civil war.
[3:01:54.680 --> 3:01:58.680]  We're going to make sure that you get in serious trouble.
[3:01:58.680 --> 3:02:03.680]  Yeah, and as far as some trick where Obama ends up staying in declaring martial law,
[3:02:03.680 --> 3:02:06.680]  I think that's completely out the door now at this point.
[3:02:06.680 --> 3:02:15.680]  And this is one of the things that I, by Trump acting so presidential, so early, for example, you know, with the carrier.
[3:02:15.680 --> 3:02:16.680]  It's never been done before.
[3:02:16.680 --> 3:02:17.680]  Right.
[3:02:17.680 --> 3:02:20.680]  And well, he's already, in a sense, the virtual president.
[3:02:20.680 --> 3:02:24.680]  So anything that happens now, let's say a truck bomb goes off right during the inauguration.
[3:02:24.680 --> 3:02:26.680]  You know, it won't stop it.
[3:02:26.680 --> 3:02:29.680]  He's going to be in, you know, if the White House is blowing up.
[3:02:29.680 --> 3:02:32.680]  Even if they kill him, it's only going to supercharge Americana.
[3:02:32.680 --> 3:02:34.680]  And by the way, he's very fatalistic in a good way.
[3:02:34.680 --> 3:02:36.680]  He's very cheerful about all this.
[3:02:36.680 --> 3:02:38.680]  He's ready to, he's not even scared.
[3:02:38.680 --> 3:02:40.680]  No, I mean, and he does need this.
[3:02:40.680 --> 3:02:42.680]  You know, that's the thing that I come back to.
[3:02:42.680 --> 3:02:45.680]  He's not a power mad money grubber like the Clintons.
[3:02:45.680 --> 3:02:49.680]  You know, it came out of the, you know, of the wherever they came from.
[3:02:49.680 --> 3:02:56.680]  Hillary's reportedly basically dying and she's still money-grubbing six days a week going around money-grubbing for herself.
[3:02:56.680 --> 3:03:01.680]  She's got hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of Swiss bank accounts, reportedly, and she's money-grubbing.
[3:03:01.680 --> 3:03:09.680]  Donald Trump could have set up trusts where all of his grandchildren for the next, you know, six generations would be millionaires.
[3:03:09.680 --> 3:03:11.680]  He could have retired to an island with-
[3:03:11.680 --> 3:03:14.680]  But he risked everything on restoring the Republic.
[3:03:14.680 --> 3:03:21.680]  Including knowing that there were going to be some very disgraceful skeletons that had to fall out of the closet like the Billy Bush thing.
[3:03:21.680 --> 3:03:24.680]  He knew that was going to happen. He knew he was going to get slimed.
[3:03:24.680 --> 3:03:26.680]  So it took a lot of guts.
[3:03:26.680 --> 3:03:30.680]  People with a lot of skeletons in their closets, you know, people say, why don't you run for office?
[3:03:30.680 --> 3:03:33.680]  Skeletons, too many skeletons.
[3:03:33.680 --> 3:03:40.680]  So it takes a lot of guts for a guy like Donald Trump to actually do this and knowing he's going to take all the slings and arrows.
[3:03:40.680 --> 3:03:42.680]  So I do respect and admire him greatly.
[3:03:42.680 --> 3:03:47.680]  Absolutely. All right. I'm out of time to Ben and Danny and Jesse and WC.
[3:03:47.680 --> 3:03:52.680]  I really appreciate the callers holding. I love you to death. We're going to be back tomorrow live and a lot more.
[3:03:52.680 --> 3:03:54.680]  Paul Watson's about to take over.
[3:03:54.680 --> 3:04:00.680]  But hey, he is now president-elect and he's gotten the electoral college. They tried to block it.
[3:04:00.680 --> 3:04:05.680]  This is an incredible time. And all I can say is have a great Christmas and New Year.
[3:04:05.680 --> 3:04:07.680]  Mr. Bracken, we want to thank you for all you do.
[3:04:07.680 --> 3:04:08.680]  Thank you.
[3:04:08.680 --> 3:04:12.680]  N.A.S. foreign and domestic.com. I expect to see probably more of these attacks, don't you?
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:18.680]  Absolutely. No doubt. And possibly even attacks from the left at the inauguration.
[3:04:18.680 --> 3:04:27.680]  Can you imagine getting in a country that brought you into the solemn secret, gave you food, gave you money, and then you'd line up an 18-wheeler and run over men, women, and kids?
[3:04:27.680 --> 3:04:35.680]  Well, I understand the Islamic motivation, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see like a left-wing, weather underground kind of reaction at this point.
[3:04:35.680 --> 3:04:44.680]  You know, the William Ayers type of a thing. I wouldn't be surprised to see, for example, drones being used to attack the inauguration parade.
[3:04:44.680 --> 3:04:45.680]  Very easy.
[3:04:45.680 --> 3:04:51.680]  And also, I think making themselves victims, I think of false flags in the wind. We've got to all watch that. Thank you, Matt Bracken.
[3:04:51.680 --> 3:05:16.680]  Nobody be violent on our side, folks. Do not. Be like Gandhi. I'm going to come introduce Paul Watts and stay with us.
[3:05:16.680 --> 3:05:21.680]  Finally, a president who calls it like it is. But wait, that's not how Darlene feels.
[3:05:21.680 --> 3:05:26.680]  She says he offered no support for his claims that terrorists were responsible for the carnage.
[3:05:26.680 --> 3:05:27.680]  What? What? What?
[3:05:27.680 --> 3:05:29.680]  What world are you living in, Darlene?
[3:05:29.680 --> 3:05:34.680]  The shooter literally said Allahu Akbar and said he did this for Jihad.
[3:05:34.680 --> 3:05:39.680]  And what other incidents do we know of where crowds of people are run over by a truck?
[3:05:39.680 --> 3:05:47.680]  If 120 people were in a burning building and Trump saved 119 of them, Darlene would write a story saying Trump kills one in structure fire.
[3:05:47.680 --> 3:05:51.680]  This is just like when they scolded Trump for referencing a bomb in New York back in September.
[3:05:51.680 --> 3:05:54.680]  Well, he was right then and he is right now.
[3:05:54.680 --> 3:06:20.680]  Sorry, Darlene. This is Owen Shroyer for Infowars.com.

[3:07:35.680 --> 3:07:37.680]  The general public doesn't.
[3:07:37.680 --> 3:07:41.680]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.

[3:07:45.680 --> 3:07:51.680]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[3:08:27.680 --> 3:08:28.680]  We're having a huge effect.
[3:08:28.680 --> 3:08:30.680]  Paul Watson has taken over as we speak.
[3:08:30.680 --> 3:08:41.680]  I wanted to play this clip of the Russian news talking about the fact that Putin, Russian ambassador's murder, is a provocation aimed at undermining Syrian peace process.
[3:08:41.680 --> 3:08:43.680]  Very powerful report.
[3:08:43.680 --> 3:08:47.680]  Paul filed on this, breaking it down, that's at Infowars.com.
[3:08:47.680 --> 3:08:50.680]  But here is that report.
[3:08:50.680 --> 3:09:01.680]  Russian ambassador Andrei Kolov was shot dead in a horrific attack in Turkey by a terrorist, upset that Russia had just wiped out Jihadist rebels Al Qaeda and ISIS in Aleppo.
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:11.680]  The gunman, a 22-year-old Turkish police officer, confirmed that he was a member of the Religion of Peace by yelling Allah Akbar twice, immediately after the shooting.
[3:09:11.680 --> 3:09:13.680]  Allah Akbar!
[3:09:13.680 --> 3:09:17.680]  He also pledged allegiance to Mohammed in his jihad.
[3:09:17.680 --> 3:09:26.680]  Nothing to do with Islam, then. Reports are circulating that Barack Obama immediately ordered weapons to be delivered to the moderate terrorist who shot the ambassador.
[3:09:26.680 --> 3:09:29.680]  That's what they're actually doing now, escalating the war in Syria.
[3:09:29.680 --> 3:09:33.680]  Now, that's just the intro to the Russian ambassador shot dead, what they're not telling you.
[3:09:33.680 --> 3:09:36.680]  Here is the clip from RT that I was mentioning.
[3:09:36.680 --> 3:09:42.680]  Putin, Russian ambassador's murder is a provocation aimed at undermining Syrian peace process.
[3:09:42.680 --> 3:10:02.680]  This murder is clearly a provocation aimed at undermining the improvement and the normalization of the Russian-Turkish relations, as well as at undermining the peace process in Syria,
[3:10:02.680 --> 3:10:13.680]  promoted by Russia, Turkey, Iran, and other countries interested in settling this conflict in Syria.
[3:10:13.680 --> 3:10:24.680]  The only response we should offer to this murder is stepping up our fight against terror, and the criminals will feel the heat.
[3:10:24.680 --> 3:10:43.680]  The Russian investigative committee has already launched an investigation into this killing. It's been tasked with forming a working group which will have to fly to Ankara and join its Turkish colleagues in the investigating this murder.
[3:10:43.680 --> 3:10:51.680]  This is something we agreed on in my telephone conversation with the Turkish president just now. We have to know who organized the killing.
[3:10:51.680 --> 3:10:52.680]  That's good.
[3:10:52.680 --> 3:10:54.680]  Thank you very much.
[3:11:23.680 --> 3:11:28.680]  Host the show, writes articles, it does research, battles on Twitter and Facebook.
[3:11:28.680 --> 3:11:31.680]  So much happening, but I've got to tell you, it happened.
[3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:39.680]  We've got Trump now basically securing the electoral votes he needs, getting the electoral college to follow its duty.
[3:11:39.680 --> 3:11:43.680]  Now the media is calling it the anointing of him as if he's not elected.
[3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:53.680]  Do you expect them to back off now or only intensify their operations because the parallels to World War One trying to start a larger conflict and the fact that the Russians think NATO is behind this?
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:57.680]  I absolutely agree. That's who benefits Kibono.
[3:11:57.680 --> 3:12:04.680]  Well, you asked if we're going to back off. They've tried five different things, Alex. They've tried the recount. They've tried the riots.
[3:12:04.680 --> 3:12:10.680]  They've tried voter intimidation, threatening the electors. They've tried the fake news narrative. They've tried the Russian hacking narrative.
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:13.680]  Every single one of those five schemes has failed.
[3:12:13.680 --> 3:12:19.680]  You would think by this point they would give up and get tired of miserably failing, but they haven't.
[3:12:19.680 --> 3:12:22.680]  You look at Michael Moore's tweets last night, Alex, this is his tweet.
[3:12:22.680 --> 3:12:25.680]  He's not president for four and a half weeks.
[3:12:25.680 --> 3:12:33.680]  Next idea, and then in another tweet he's talking about Trump is not president until 12 noon on January 20th, will continue to fight.
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:37.680]  So even though they had the electoral vote, they're still not done.
[3:12:37.680 --> 3:12:42.680]  They're still desperate to sabotage this democratic election any way possible.
[3:12:42.680 --> 3:12:48.680]  While saying everywhere before when Trump was afraid they were going to try to steal it, which they tried to, look out, they're going to try to steal it.
[3:12:48.680 --> 3:12:52.680]  They said there's no such thing. It's never existed, but in the same breath, but everybody's hacking.
[3:12:52.680 --> 3:12:55.680]  The Russians are taking over. We've got to federalize and keep it safe.
[3:12:55.680 --> 3:13:02.680]  And now five states are coming out saying the feds were hacking into their computers trying to flip it to Hillary.
[3:13:02.680 --> 3:13:12.680]  I mean, this is incredible. And Bev Harris, the big liberal who's totally trustworthy, who exposed the 2000 debacle, has come out and said they tried to steal it from Trump.
[3:13:12.680 --> 3:13:18.680]  The Russian has an HBO documentary. So the fact is the Democrats are trying to steal this. Do you think they'll give up?
[3:13:18.680 --> 3:13:21.680]  Are they out of bullets? What do they do?
[3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:25.680]  Well, they might be figuratively out of bullets, but maybe not literally.
[3:13:25.680 --> 3:13:31.680]  The media has pushed this hysterical narrative that Trump represents a threat to the world for the past six to eight months.
[3:13:31.680 --> 3:13:34.680]  They've already been several assassination attempts on Trump.
[3:13:34.680 --> 3:13:36.680]  And I wouldn't be surprised to see another one.
[3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:40.680]  And that will be the media's fake news that radicalizes that shooter.
[3:13:40.680 --> 3:13:42.680]  If that happens, that's a very real threat.
[3:13:42.680 --> 3:13:45.680]  But on top of Michael Moore, Alex, you'll like this.
[3:13:45.680 --> 3:13:56.680]  Glenn Beck is trending at the top of Twitter right now because he's announced an alliance with the far left Samantha Bee Comedy Central woman to fight Trumpism.
[3:13:56.680 --> 3:14:06.680]  So this is the guy, Alex, who is notorious, has made a speciality out of stabbing authentic grassroots political movements in the back.
[3:14:06.680 --> 3:14:14.680]  I told people six years ago he was a Trojan horse, an actor, a globalist, democratic operative, excited from inside people.
[3:14:14.680 --> 3:14:18.680]  Now it's completely proven he is the Judas Iscariot, the Benedict Arnold.
[3:14:18.680 --> 3:14:23.680]  He goes on the news and says conservatives are fake. We're frauds. It's all a scam.
[3:14:23.680 --> 3:14:29.680]  But they have these real fake news channels go on NPR and speak for me and go, here's how Alex does it.
[3:14:29.680 --> 3:14:36.680]  So that's all he's got now is going on these shows and groveling and begging for mainstream shows.
[3:14:36.680 --> 3:14:42.680]  I mean, this guy is worse than I ever thought. Whoa.
[3:14:42.680 --> 3:14:49.680]  That's exactly what it is. He was sat there with a groveling eating cake and talking about how much they have in common.
[3:14:49.680 --> 3:14:53.680]  He knew they were going to install Hillary. He thought that for sure. He probably bet on the good horse.
[3:14:53.680 --> 3:14:57.680]  He knew net censorship was coming. Drugs was told this too, but came and warned people here.
[3:14:57.680 --> 3:15:01.680]  He was told that they were going to censor. He decided to roll over.
[3:15:01.680 --> 3:15:05.680]  He was told they were going to shut down the independent press. He was told they were coming after the alt-right.
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:11.680]  He was told Facebook was going to do this. So he went and met on his belly like a snake crawling to Zuckerberg.
[3:15:11.680 --> 3:15:15.680]  Remember that? And so he's chosen to shoot you.
[3:15:15.680 --> 3:15:22.680]  You join with Sauron. Yeah, because he stabs authentic grassroots political movements in the back.
[3:15:22.680 --> 3:15:24.680]  That's what he does. He did it in 2007.
[3:15:24.680 --> 3:15:30.680]  It implied that Ron Paul supporters were domestic terrorists in 2012 when Ron Paul ran again.
[3:15:30.680 --> 3:15:33.680]  He compared Ron Paul to Osama bin Laden.
[3:15:33.680 --> 3:15:38.680]  This is a guy who stabs authentic grassroots political movements in the back.
[3:15:38.680 --> 3:15:43.680]  Now, Ron Paul was a lot less on a lower scale than Trump, but same rule applies.
[3:15:43.680 --> 3:15:45.680]  An authentic grassroots political group.
[3:15:45.680 --> 3:15:49.680]  We know that Glenn Beck is literally the biggest scumbag in America,
[3:15:49.680 --> 3:15:55.680]  because at least more of the six bodyguards that says we can't have guns is open about his hate of this country.
[3:15:55.680 --> 3:16:02.680]  When you're dealing with somebody like Beck, you are dealing with the ultimate phony, the ultimate psychopath.
[3:16:02.680 --> 3:16:05.680]  That's why he always acts nice and sweet and cute, because they don't know how to act like that.
[3:16:05.680 --> 3:16:09.680]  So they put on this fake deal like, look, I've got a puppy. I've got candy.
[3:16:09.680 --> 3:16:14.680]  I mean, he is the creepiest guy in those sweaters. He wears to all look kind of wimpy on purpose.
[3:16:14.680 --> 3:16:18.680]  I mean, this guy is a predator. Paul, I'm handing the baton to you. We salute you.
[3:16:18.680 --> 3:16:21.680]  Have a fabulous Christmas coming up, my friend.
[3:16:21.680 --> 3:16:22.680]  Okay. Thanks, Alex.
[3:16:22.680 --> 3:16:28.680]  And continuing on that same vein, we've got an article out of the Daily Beast here, which I'll get on to read some of.
[3:16:28.680 --> 3:16:34.680]  But basically, Glenn Beck met up for this little cute seven minute YouTube video with Samantha Bee,
[3:16:34.680 --> 3:16:40.680]  the far left comedy central comedian. And basically, they held hands.
[3:16:40.680 --> 3:16:43.680]  They shared a cake. They talked about what they had in common.
[3:16:43.680 --> 3:16:50.680]  They talked about forming an alliance, again, to sabotage Donald Trump, to fight Trumpism.
[3:16:50.680 --> 3:16:56.680]  Went into a whole dialogue about how he's going to destroy freedom of the press.
[3:16:56.680 --> 3:16:59.680]  He's going to kill the First Amendment, again, complete hysteria.
[3:16:59.680 --> 3:17:02.680]  The media's been pushing it for months. We know it's false.
[3:17:02.680 --> 3:17:10.680]  But again, this is a guy who is notorious for stabbing grassroots, authentic political movements in the back.
[3:17:10.680 --> 3:17:15.680]  You had the Ron Paul movement, 2007. He got on CNN.
[3:17:15.680 --> 3:17:17.680]  Remember, that's when he was back on CNN.
[3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:20.680]  Said that basically Ron Paul supporters were terrorists.
[3:17:20.680 --> 3:17:24.680]  That's what he implied, and that the army should be used against them.
[3:17:24.680 --> 3:17:28.680]  Fast forward to 2012, Ron Paul running for president again.
[3:17:28.680 --> 3:17:32.680]  He said that Ron Paul was like Osama bin Laden.
[3:17:32.680 --> 3:17:36.680]  Okay, so now you've got the Trump movement, which is an authentic grassroots political movement,
[3:17:36.680 --> 3:17:40.680]  albeit on a larger scale than the Ron Paul movement, but same rule applies.
[3:17:40.680 --> 3:17:43.680]  Again, stabbing it in the back.
[3:17:43.680 --> 3:17:50.680]  At the cost of his own audience, remember, he featured the grass before from theblaze.com.
[3:17:50.680 --> 3:17:57.680]  Their traffic since April, May, June of this year is completely falling off a cliff.
[3:17:57.680 --> 3:18:02.680]  Because none of what he is saying resonates with any of his audience,
[3:18:02.680 --> 3:18:10.680]  which is why, as Alex has said, he's had to worm himself in with people like Zuckerberg with people on the far left.
[3:18:10.680 --> 3:18:17.680]  Remember, this is a guy who wrote an op-ed for the New York Times saying how great Black Lives Matter was.
[3:18:17.680 --> 3:18:23.680]  This is a movement, Black Lives Matter, whose ideological guru, the name, the woman,
[3:18:23.680 --> 3:18:27.680]  they chant her name at every single rally, it's Arthur Shakur,
[3:18:27.680 --> 3:18:32.680]  who is a convicted cop killer on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list.
[3:18:32.680 --> 3:18:36.680]  Okay, that's your ideological guru of Black Lives Matter.
[3:18:36.680 --> 3:18:42.680]  This is a group whose extremist violent rhetoric has caused terrorist attacks that have killed police officers.
[3:18:42.680 --> 3:18:47.680]  But Glenn Beck comes out and says, no, it's a perfectly rational, reasonable movement.
[3:18:47.680 --> 3:18:49.680]  We need to build bridges with it.
[3:18:49.680 --> 3:18:54.680]  I think we need to build bridges with the Klan or with Dylan Roof.
[3:18:54.680 --> 3:18:58.680]  I mean, that's the equivalent. It's caused violence. It's caused bloodshed.
[3:18:58.680 --> 3:19:02.680]  And then Trump gets up with Samantha Bee for this cute seven-minute video,
[3:19:02.680 --> 3:19:08.680]  and they have a meeting of the minds and they eat cake and talk about how bad Donald Trump is.
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:13.680]  It's absolutely sickening, but again, no surprise given, Glenn Beck's history.
[3:19:13.680 --> 3:19:15.680]  But again, absolutely shocking.
[3:19:15.680 --> 3:19:20.680]  In the next segment or after the next segment, we're going to talk to Annabelle Schunker about what's taking place in Germany.
[3:19:20.680 --> 3:19:22.680]  She's on the ground there. She's a journalist.
[3:19:22.680 --> 3:19:26.680]  We have ISIS who have just come out and claimed responsibility.
[3:19:26.680 --> 3:19:30.680]  The Islamic State said an Islamic State soldier carried out the attack.
[3:19:30.680 --> 3:19:32.680]  So I guess that's nothing to do with Islam.
[3:19:32.680 --> 3:19:37.680]  Of course, today we had the development that the Pakistani refugee, they initially arrested.
[3:19:37.680 --> 3:19:40.680]  They're now saying it's not him. He had nothing to do with the attack.
[3:19:40.680 --> 3:19:48.680]  Is that part of the cover-up? If not, then we still have an armed terrorist on the run in Germany.
[3:19:48.680 --> 3:19:51.680]  But ISIS has claimed responsibility for that attack.
[3:19:51.680 --> 3:20:14.680]  We'll be back with more news on the Alex Jones show live. Don't go away.

[3:26:17.680 --> 3:26:25.680]  Now, I'm going to talk about the Berlin truck attack as CNN called it. Again, the truck just drove into a Christmas market of its own accord.
[3:26:25.680 --> 3:26:32.680]  There was no ideology behind it whatsoever. We're going to get into that in the next segment with our guest who is on the ground in Germany.
[3:26:32.680 --> 3:26:43.680]  But with all that was going on yesterday, we were unable, I was unable at least to properly focus on the delicious outcome of the electoral voting.
[3:26:43.680 --> 3:26:52.680]  When for weeks and weeks you had this hysterical campaign by the likes of Michael Moore, by C-rate celebrities in Hollywood,
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:27:02.680]  remember they came out with that video immediately before, by Hillary Clinton supporters who deluged Republican electors with thousands upon thousands of emails,
[3:27:02.680 --> 3:27:12.680]  letters, phone calls, of course, many death threats along with it because they're tolerant liberals, all to try and make them change their mind and not vote for Donald Trump.
[3:27:12.680 --> 3:27:20.680]  Well, what happened yesterday? Okay, two electors in Texas changed their mind and didn't vote for Donald Trump.
[3:27:20.680 --> 3:27:31.680]  Two, five electors didn't vote for Hillary Clinton. That's right. Five electors abandoned Hillary Clinton and three more.
[3:27:31.680 --> 3:27:37.680]  This is what the media won't admit. Three more tried to defect. They were replaced.
[3:27:37.680 --> 3:27:48.680]  So in total, you had eight electors try to abandon Hillary Clinton and not vote for Hillary in the electoral vote compared to just two for Donald Trump.
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:28:00.680]  After a week's long campaign of harassment, intimidation, death threats, celebrities coming out with this ridiculous YouTube videos trying to get Republicans to change their mind.
[3:28:00.680 --> 3:28:10.680]  As I predicted before this happened, all this harassment, all these letters only made Republican electors more determined to vote for Trump.
[3:28:10.680 --> 3:28:21.680]  It actually had the opposite effect. So much failed from the left. The recount failed. The riots failed. Threatening the electors failed.
[3:28:21.680 --> 3:28:30.680]  The fake news narrative failed. Russian hacking failed. They failed again and again and again and they're going to continue to fail.
[3:28:30.680 --> 3:28:37.680]  So again, Hillary Clinton lost more electors than any politician in the last 100 years.
[3:28:37.680 --> 3:28:47.680]  Not since 1912 has a candidate lost more electors. Let that sink in. Again, absolutely delicious.
[3:28:47.680 --> 3:28:55.680]  But again, you've got Michael Moore coming out today and saying, we're not done. They're not bored of failing yet.
[3:28:55.680 --> 3:29:01.680]  They're going to continue to fail. They're going to try and pull off something. God knows what.
[3:29:01.680 --> 3:29:10.680]  Between now and January 20th, Michael Moore tweeted last night after the electoral vote, well, he's not president for four and a half weeks.
[3:29:10.680 --> 3:29:19.680]  Next idea. Well, here's an idea, Michael. Why don't you take a look in the mirror? Why don't you ask yourselves why you lost?
[3:29:19.680 --> 3:29:28.680]  You know, have a little bit of self-reflection. Why don't you stop trying to sabotage a Democratic election? How's that for an idea?
[3:29:28.680 --> 3:29:39.680]  But no, they're so pleased with themselves for failing five times consecutively that they're going to continue to try to fail again and again.
[3:29:39.680 --> 3:29:58.680]  And Donald Trump is going to win again and again and again. We'll be back with our guest in the next segment. Stay tuned.
[3:30:10.680 --> 3:30:16.680]  We have been reporting on ISIS or radical Islam's use of these social network platforms to recruit and spread its propaganda.
[3:30:16.680 --> 3:30:26.680]  Mostly in the light of the hypocritical sense that you can be centered on Facebook or Twitter for being a conservative, sharing infowars' links, speaking bad about Obama, or being a Trump supporter.
[3:30:26.680 --> 3:30:32.680]  But somehow, magically, radical Islamic terror groups have managed to continue their usage of these platforms.
[3:30:32.680 --> 3:30:41.680]  But perhaps now, for these double-standard hypocritical companies, the chickens are coming home to roost, as the lawsuit is now making its way to a federal court in eastern Michigan.
[3:30:41.680 --> 3:30:55.680]  This isn't the first time these companies have been sued. In June, the family of a victim of the Paris attacks sued Facebook, Twitter, and Google for the same reason, allowing a terrorist group to radicalize people on their platform who eventually carry out deadly attacks.
[3:30:55.680 --> 3:30:58.680]  This is Owen Troyer for Infowars.com.

[3:33:28.680 --> 3:33:46.680]  ISIS has claimed responsibility for the devastating terror attack in Berlin yesterday of course. The horrible site of a truck having been driven through a Christmas market, at least 12 people dead, dozens more injured. The suspect, as of this moment, is still on the run.
[3:33:46.680 --> 3:34:07.680]  They arrested a Pakistani refugee, then claimed that he had nothing to do with the attack. So an armed terrorist still on the run in Berlin. As we discuss again, moving towards New Year's Eve, we know what happened in Cologne last year, the impact of the mass migrant policy that Angela Merkel has overseen in Germany.
[3:34:07.680 --> 3:34:17.680]  And to discuss that, we are talking to Annabel Schonker, who is a model and journalist there in Germany. Annabel, welcome to the show.
[3:34:17.680 --> 3:34:20.680]  Hi, Paul. How are you? Good to have you on.
[3:34:20.680 --> 3:34:36.680]  Now, of course, you've been covering this. You're there on the ground. First, I just want to get your general reaction to what happened yesterday in Berlin. How did you find out about this horrible attack and what were your initial thoughts when you saw this happen?
[3:34:36.680 --> 3:34:56.680]  My first thought was just, this is a terrorist attack. To me, it was totally clear what happened in this moment, because it remembers me of what happened in East, for example. And so it was really clear what happened. It was just a matter of time, I think.
[3:34:56.680 --> 3:35:10.680]  No, no, we had a CNN speculating for what seemed like ours, whether it was an accident, it seemed like they were hoping that it was obviously, as you said, identical to Nice. Now, Islamic State has claimed responsibility.
[3:35:10.680 --> 3:35:27.680]  But of course, this comes after Germany has imported 1.5 million mostly Muslim migrants over the past 18 months. Numerous migrants involved in the mass molestation in Cologne, rapes of German women.
[3:35:27.680 --> 3:35:44.680]  Of course, we had the migrant who tried to blow himself up outside a music festival earlier in the summer, several other incidents. They're saying that the migrant numbers coming into Germany have now dropped off, that there's only 300,000 migrants a year coming into Germany.
[3:35:44.680 --> 3:36:00.680]  Right, that's a small number. You live in Germany, you've experienced the impact that this migrant influx has had. In what ways has life for Germans changed since Angela Merkel opened the door to this migrant influx?
[3:36:00.680 --> 3:36:18.680]  Germany has totally changed. I have to say, I talk a lot with other women. For example, they write me mails the whole day. They are scared of going out. They ask themselves what to wear when they go out.
[3:36:18.680 --> 3:36:33.680]  And yeah, especially the life of the women in Germany has totally changed. And after this terrorist attack in Berlin now, I think the life of all people will be changed.
[3:36:33.680 --> 3:36:48.680]  I mean, I visited Dresden back in the summer and there was a migrant camp located nearby and you could see that there was a group of migrants. Again, the locals were complaining about drug dealing. I saw them with my own eyes harassing women.
[3:36:48.680 --> 3:37:01.680]  So you've experienced that too, have you? I mean, I receive emails from German women basically every week complaining about their treatment. So you're saying you no longer feel safe walking the streets at night in Germany, correct?
[3:37:01.680 --> 3:37:26.680]  Yeah, this is correct. After Cologne, my first step was to buy me, yeah, don't know the English word, I think pepper spray and kind of alarm for my bag. And yeah, this was the first step and I know many women who did the same.
[3:37:26.680 --> 3:37:39.680]  No, I mean, exactly. You've got sales of quote non-lethal weapons in Germany flying off the shelves. They can't get the stock in quick enough. And that is because as you said, you've got incidents like Cologne last year, also Hamburg as well.
[3:37:39.680 --> 3:38:07.680]  Meanwhile, you've got the mayor of Cologne saying, keep the rapist at arm's length. Like that's any way reasonable kind of advice to women. This year in Cologne, you have a huge police operation, again, at taxpayer expense. And according to what I read about this, the German police, the special officers in Cologne are going to talk to the victims of sexual assault after the attack.
[3:38:07.680 --> 3:38:26.680]  So they're not even going to try and prevent the attack. They acknowledge that they can't prevent the attacks. They're just going to console people afterwards. I mean, do you envisage more sexual assaults in Cologne or New Year's Eve in these other German cities? Do you think that's going to happen again this year?
[3:38:26.680 --> 3:38:53.680]  I don't know. I think in Cologne, it's not going to happen because I think it will be the safest place in Germany on this New Year's Eve. So I don't think this would happen again in Cologne, but I'm sure it will happen in other towns, maybe smaller towns. Yeah, that would be so, yeah.
[3:38:53.680 --> 3:39:08.680]  And of course, we know there was a huge cover up in the media in the first few days of that. They refused to report on it. But we have Angela Merkel. Now, this is what confuses me whenever I read about Angela Merkel, because we see all these horrible stories coming out of Germany.
[3:39:08.680 --> 3:39:27.680]  And yet, according to the latest polls, Angela Merkel still has the support of the majority of the German people. So it was 56% supported her in the next election. She still maintains strong support from the German people despite all this.
[3:39:27.680 --> 3:39:35.680]  So why, after everything that's happened, Annabelle, is Angela Merkel still popular in Germany?
[3:39:35.680 --> 3:39:44.680]  That's a really good question. I don't know the exact answer. I'm asking myself this question all the time.
[3:39:44.680 --> 3:40:06.680]  This country is just crazy, I think. It's a lot about, yeah, the people have high moral standards and they talk about humanism and, yeah, about that we are guilty in a way and have to give something back to the people.
[3:40:06.680 --> 3:40:24.680]  And this is the mood which inspires these people to help the refugees, no matter what, and to support Angela Merkel.
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:42.680]  And I mean, that's something that we often can't grasp in different countries is how deeply ingrained is that kind of World War Two Hitler guilt? I mean, of course, because that's what's driving a lot of people, but it's driving younger people still to adopt these suicidal leftist worldviews in Germany.
[3:40:42.680 --> 3:40:56.680]  So is that kind of collective guilt ingrained into the German people at a young age? Is it at the educational, at the school level, that they have to be guilty about Hitler and World War Two? Is that actually in the schooling?
[3:40:56.680 --> 3:41:23.680]  Yeah, this is indeed in the schooling. It's, yeah, about education. And I think it's also, it's not only the World War Two, it's, yeah, new topics like the Third World and, yeah, what we have done to the Third World and things like that.
[3:41:23.680 --> 3:41:41.680]  And, yeah, it's a mixture of both things, the World War Two and these Third World things and war in Syria and Iraq and Afghanistan and all these stuff together, yeah.
[3:41:41.680 --> 3:41:59.680]  And I mean, it's so bad at this point. There's quite a famous video which I put up on Twitter earlier today of Angela Merkel. She's at a public event. One of her other, I think it's one of her ministers hands her a German flag and she kind of shakes her head and says, no, no, no, no.
[3:41:59.680 --> 3:42:13.680]  And then hands the German flag to somebody else. She didn't even want to be seen on stage with a German flag, the flag of her own country. There's also a video of, you know, people go on marches on protests.
[3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:21.680]  They wave the German flag. The police say you can't wave the German flag. It might offend somebody. It might stir up trouble.
[3:42:21.680 --> 3:42:34.680]  But how bad is the situation in Germany where your own flag is now seen as offensive and can't even be shown in public and your own Chancellor is ashamed of her own flag.
[3:42:34.680 --> 3:43:02.680]  This is so typical German. Yeah, the people have such a problem with patriotism and to be proud of their own country. And this is a big problem in Germany and it's also a big problem in case of integration of refugees and migrants because of the fact
[3:43:02.680 --> 3:43:23.680]  that we are ashamed of our own identity of our own country. And yeah, this is not very attractive for migrants to identify with people of a country who are ashamed of their own national identity.
[3:43:23.680 --> 3:43:32.680]  Exactly. And you saw you saw the video that we just played of Merkel ashamed of her own flag. You also have something else that I've noticed and I included this in my recent video.
[3:43:32.680 --> 3:43:43.680]  You have government commercials on television in Germany where it's a blonde German woman saying how wonderful hijabs are and that Germans need to embrace multiculturalism.
[3:43:43.680 --> 3:43:53.680]  You have Christmas markets, much like the one that was just attacked by an Islamic terrorist where they have Christmas songs is lamified.
[3:43:53.680 --> 3:44:01.680]  They take original Christian songs is lamify them like Muslim migrants sing them. They broadcast this live on television.
[3:44:01.680 --> 3:44:16.680]  I mean, you talked about the schooling, the education in terms of culture, in terms of television. Do you see this in the culture where they're forcing indoctrinating people to kind of accept this idea that they have to integrate with the migrants,
[3:44:16.680 --> 3:44:21.680]  not that the migrants have to integrate into Germany. Have you seen that in the culture?
[3:44:21.680 --> 3:44:34.680]  Yeah, it's all about cultural relativism in Germany. You have this in school. You have this at university. It's the whole.
[3:44:34.680 --> 3:44:53.680]  It's the topic of overall cultural relativism and you have to tolerate the culture, the culture of the migrants, of people who wear a hijab and stuff like that.
[3:44:53.680 --> 3:45:10.680]  But the problem is they don't tolerate other than our culture. And yeah, this is the problem because we are not proud enough to protect our own identity.
[3:45:10.680 --> 3:45:25.680]  I mean, that's when it's a problem when you're asked to tolerate a culture which at its very root is barbaric, is regressive, is itself intolerant in a supposedly liberal tolerant society, you're being asked to tolerate that makes absolutely no sense.
[3:45:25.680 --> 3:45:39.680]  The other thing that shocked me about Germany, of course, you had the head of the Green Party, Stephanie von Berg come out last year and she celebrated the fact that Germans, native Germans will be a minority
[3:45:39.680 --> 3:45:50.680]  in their own cities within 30 years. She got up in front of the parliament and celebrated that fact because it would prove right wingers wrong.
[3:45:50.680 --> 3:46:06.680]  So they're talking about the demographic suicide of the German people just to prove a point. I mean, Annabelle, do you think that they're doing that just for political power so they can have all these migrants come in and vote for left wing parties?
[3:46:06.680 --> 3:46:12.680]  Or is there something more to that demographic suicide of the German people?
[3:46:12.680 --> 3:46:39.680]  It's definitely something more because members of the Green Party or a lot of members of the Green Party in Germany are something that we call anti-Deutsche, anti-Germans. This is some kind of ideology of people who really hate Germany and the German identity
[3:46:39.680 --> 3:46:50.680]  and who are quite happy if we delete ourselves from the world.
[3:46:50.680 --> 3:47:04.680]  It's amazing. Now, on top of this, we've got Facebook, Twitter, other social media websites, not only censoring people. In fact, the German government demanded that Facebook delete certain content within 24 hours,
[3:47:04.680 --> 3:47:15.680]  or they would find the company and they would find Facebook. You were censored on Facebook recently in relation to this migrant crisis. Tell us what happened.
[3:47:15.680 --> 3:47:37.680]  I was blocked from Facebook for about 30 days because of posting a mail I got from a migrant person who offended me in a real bad way.
[3:47:37.680 --> 3:47:54.680]  He said to me, I really need the punk, punk, punk cock in me. I posted this mail and got blocked from Facebook for 30 days.
[3:47:54.680 --> 3:48:08.680]  Basically, you were sexually harassed, at least on message, by one of these migrants. That is harassment according to Facebook's own policies. You posted that image on Facebook and said, look, I'm being harassed by this individual and he wasn't banned.
[3:48:08.680 --> 3:48:23.680]  You were banned. That gives you an insight into how Facebook is treating this. Now, as we know that the Stasi is involved, former Stasi official, involved with censorship with Facebook and with the German government. Absolutely amazing.
[3:48:23.680 --> 3:48:31.680]  And now Germans are getting home visits from the police if they criticise the migrant policy in their own country. It's absolutely frightening.
[3:48:31.680 --> 3:48:45.680]  Where do you see this going, Annabelle? Do you think Merkel will be forced to change her policy? Will she be elected in the election next year? Is it the end for Angela Merkel or do you think this will continue to get worse?
[3:48:45.680 --> 3:49:03.680]  It's not the end of Angela Merkel. As you said, as you already said, the Germans still vote for Angela Merkel and I'm pretty sure that they will vote for her in the next elections in 2017.
[3:49:03.680 --> 3:49:14.680]  So nothing will change and this is the big problem for all the people here who criticise Angela Merkel's policy.
[3:49:14.680 --> 3:49:24.680]  It's absolutely amazing. I mean, I thought Sweden would be the first European country to really have its back broken, but Germany is certainly providing stiff competition.
[3:49:24.680 --> 3:49:31.680]  Just here in the final minute, Annabelle, tell people where they can find you on Twitter and how they can read your articles.
[3:49:31.680 --> 3:49:45.680]  They can read my articles on Thierry's Einblick and also on Huffington Post. The English translations are coming up on my website, Annabelle Schunke.com.
[3:49:45.680 --> 3:49:53.680]  You can find me also on Twitter, Any Rockstar and on Facebook, Annabelle Schunke.
[3:49:53.680 --> 3:50:02.680]  OK, and I'll be sure to link to those pages when this interview goes up on YouTube. Journalist for Huffington Post and other outlets, Annabelle Schunke.
[3:50:02.680 --> 3:50:04.680]  Thanks for joining us today.
[3:50:04.680 --> 3:50:06.680]  Thanks, Paul.
[3:50:06.680 --> 3:50:16.680]  Thank you. Take care. There goes Annabelle Schunke from Germany and again, ISIS is now playing responsibility for yesterday's attack in Berlin.
[3:50:16.680 --> 3:50:24.680]  Of course, now they're building barriers around every single Christmas market in Berlin, not building barriers around their own border.
[3:50:24.680 --> 3:50:31.680]  In fact, not even enforcing their own border laws, 300,000 migrants still coming in.
[3:50:31.680 --> 3:50:38.680]  At first they were saying, yes, it's been 1.5 million migrants over the past 18 months, but it's dropping off.
[3:50:38.680 --> 3:50:44.680]  We're scaling back the policy, only going to be 300,000 every single year now.
[3:50:44.680 --> 3:50:51.680]  And that is the total immigration into the UK every year. Germany is doing it just on that one level alone.
[3:50:51.680 --> 3:51:19.680]  We'll be back with the final segment of the Alex Jumshoff's The Break. Don't go away.
[3:51:19.680 --> 3:51:27.680]  Extendivite slowly chelates the metals away from the liver so it can dispose of what was meant to be a harmless process for oxide.

[3:55:58.680 --> 3:56:03.680]  Infowarslife.com. The Daily Express reports,
[3:56:03.680 --> 3:56:08.680]  Nativity scene removed over fears it will offend town's four Muslims.
[3:56:08.680 --> 3:56:22.680]  This is in Belgium. If this came out of Molenbeek in Belgium, which is in Islamic ghetto, maybe it would make more sense, but this is a town in Belgium which has a population of just four Muslims,
[3:56:22.680 --> 3:56:32.680]  and town chiefs allegedly refused to include a traditional festive display in Hallsbeek, Belgium, over fears it could upset a member of the miniscule Muslim population.
[3:56:32.680 --> 3:56:39.680]  So it was a Christmas tree, God forbid, can't say Merry Christmas, you can't even say Happy Holidays anymore.
[3:56:39.680 --> 3:56:47.680]  A university, Texas women's university band saying Happy Holidays because even that wasn't politically correct enough.
[3:56:47.680 --> 3:56:53.680]  But this was a Christmas tree and a model of baby Jesus in a manger in the center of town.
[3:56:53.680 --> 3:57:04.680]  And because some local politicians thought that it might offend the four Muslims who live there, quote, too provocative for them, they decided to remove it.
[3:57:04.680 --> 3:57:12.680]  In many cases, you find that these Muslims don't even care, it's politicians getting offended on behalf of other people.
[3:57:12.680 --> 3:57:25.680]  In fact, they had a shop in Islington London not far from me, which was called Very British, and they sold all these nice little items made in Britain, you know, with the Union Jack flag.
[3:57:25.680 --> 3:57:34.680]  The locals didn't like it. They wanted it shut down because it was racist to call a shop British and sell things made in Britain.
[3:57:34.680 --> 3:57:45.680]  Meanwhile, in the same area of London, you have Romanian shops that say Romanian shop on the front, you have Polish shops, you have Islamic shops.
[3:57:45.680 --> 3:57:51.680]  You've literally got Islamic bookstores, halal butchers, every three shops down the road.
[3:57:51.680 --> 3:58:05.680]  But God forbid, if you try to have a British shop in Britain, that's racist and you will be shut down, just to exemplify some of the political correctness that we're dealing with right now in this country.
[3:58:05.680 --> 3:58:28.680]  German ministers turn on Angela Merkel amid call for martial law after Berlin. At last, some ministers, some of her allies are coming forward and saying, surely after 1.5 million migrants, after Cologne, Hamburg, numerous sexual assaults, rapes, murders, surely it's time to take a look at this disastrous red carpet migrant policy.
[3:58:28.680 --> 3:58:37.680]  That's going to wrap it up for the show, Infowars Nightly News coming up. Alex will be back with the main show tomorrow. Thanks for tuning in. BreakinNewsInfoWars.com.
