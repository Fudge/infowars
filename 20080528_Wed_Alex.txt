[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:09.000 --> 00:16.000]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:16.000 --> 00:22.000]  Very important broadcast lined up for you today on this live Wednesday edition, the 28th
[00:22.000 --> 00:33.000]  of May, 2008. I rarely go to the shopping mall, but I wanted a clock radio with sharper
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  image. And so I went over to the mall and I walk into the mall and playing over the mall
[00:40.000 --> 00:46.000]  speaker system is the flowbots. And I thought, man, that's interesting. We set them up for
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  the show last week and they're scheduled on the road to be joining us today, coming up
[00:52.000 --> 00:58.000]  later in the broadcast. They have songs with titles like There's a War on for Your Mind
[00:58.000 --> 01:05.000]  and talking about Fighting the New World Order. Very interesting. I know the founder of it
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  is from Texas, but my producer hasn't asked them whether we influenced him or not. We'll
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  find out, but going over the lyrics is just amazing. If they weren't influenced by the
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  show, they were influenced by somebody who was influenced by this radio show. But we
[01:19.000 --> 01:28.000]  will certainly find out coming up, ladies and gentlemen, here in just a few minutes
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  at the bottom of the hour. In the meantime, let me tell you about some of the other guests
[01:33.000 --> 01:47.000]  coming up on the show today. MC Johnny Five, founder of the Flowbots in 30 Minutes, Rex
[01:47.000 --> 01:55.000]  Stevens, who works in the education system in Texas. He'll be going over how if you fall
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  asleep, you are criminally charged. If you are late to class three times, you're criminally
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  charged, though there's no law. That's not an absence. Doesn't matter. The government's
[02:03.000 --> 02:08.000]  lawless. Jim Tucker will be popping in as we accelerate towards Bilderberg next Thursday
[02:08.000 --> 02:14.000]  and Friday. I'll be on site in Chantilly, Virginia for that. And then economist, corporate
[02:14.000 --> 02:22.000]  analyst, Charles Carlson in the fourth hour on the economy today. So that's a run down
[02:22.000 --> 02:31.000]  coming up. In news, the media is reporting there's a big exclusive Scott McClellan, son
[02:31.000 --> 02:42.000]  of the little corrupt corporate profiteer, Ms. Strayhorn. She's had like 10 husbands
[02:42.000 --> 02:49.000]  always forget her new name. It's a new every few months. He has come out and said that
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  President Bush was a propagandist. It was all lies. They knew it was all lies. And they're
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  acting like, you know, this is an allegation he's making. We have the White House memos.
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  We have the Downing Street memos. We have the CIA assessments. We know they premeditatedly
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  lied. When is the government not lying? When is Hillary not saying that she was shot at
[03:11.000 --> 03:18.000]  in hardcore combat in Bosnia? When is Barack Obama saying his grandfather liberated Auschwitz,
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  which was liberated by the Russians, by the way, or then it was his uncle and then it was
[03:22.000 --> 03:28.000]  all a lie. And Ronald Reagan said that too when he was never in combat. I mean, they
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  lie, lie, lie, lie. We have a group of liars that run our society. They do what they want
[03:34.000 --> 03:43.000]  when they want. And now they've gotten so greedy they're taking everything. And all their lies
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.000]  are compartmentalized. I mean, the government's been caught in millions of lies committing
[03:47.000 --> 03:52.000]  all these crimes, doing everything you can imagine, every sector of it. But still we
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  say all the government's not tyrannical and don't bash the police. The police are just
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  the power arm of the crooks that run things. And now they're getting more and more corrupt
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  and more and more militarized and arrogant and hateful. And we're in deep trouble, ladies
[04:09.000 --> 04:16.000]  and gentlemen. I mean, let me give you the cops a news flash. You're drinking the poison,
[04:16.000 --> 04:24.000]  water, your kids are taking the mercury shots. You're having your dollar devalued. You're
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  in the same boat as us. There's also talk of cocaine and Bush in McClellan's new information.
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.000]  I mean, folks, I won't even talk about this stuff because there's a few things that will
[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000]  have them send a hit team down here. But it's well known all over Texas where Bush is
[04:39.000 --> 04:46.000]  partying. But this guy is a, he would go to party so coked up, so drunk that he had to
[04:46.000 --> 04:54.000]  be carried out every night. I mean, this is who Bush is. We'll be right back.
[04:54.000 --> 05:02.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful
[05:02.000 --> 05:09.000]  world government. It's known as the builder bird. But their objective being world domination.
[05:09.000 --> 05:14.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world
[05:14.000 --> 05:23.000]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[05:23.000 --> 05:29.000]  in history, the elites plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  that drives the entire new world order agenda. Build America is making great progress for
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  the world government. Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the
[05:37.000 --> 05:41.000]  money they need. They're after power. That's their affidavit. Order in game on DVD at

[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  Stevens Group. Let's get real. Flower is already being rationed. Prices on food are getting
[05:59.000 --> 06:04.000]  so high warehouses are installing security systems and guards. You can expect soon to
[06:04.000 --> 06:10.000]  see criminal activity in food. We're all in a foot race as to whether the food will become
[06:10.000 --> 06:15.000]  so expensive we can't afford it or there will be no food at any price. We can't grow
[06:15.000 --> 06:20.000]  enough of our own food even with genetically altered trash. It will give you the opportunity
[06:20.000 --> 06:26.000]  to eat perfectly engineered food. They think God didn't get it right so Monsanto had to
[06:26.000 --> 06:31.000]  step in. If you think it's a little bit crazy to put in a supply of food, it's okay. We
[06:31.000 --> 06:42.000]  won't tell. Call 800-409-5633 on the web eFoodsDirect.com. That's 800-409-5633. It may be a
[06:42.000 --> 06:52.000]  little bit crazy. That's okay. Because there is no such thing as a little bit dead.

[07:53.000 --> 08:15.000]  I can ride my bike with no handlebars. No handlebars. No handlebars. I can ride my bike
[08:15.000 --> 08:23.000]  with no handlebars. No handlebars. No handlebars. Look at me. Look at me. Hands in the air like
[08:23.000 --> 08:28.000]  it's good to be alive. And I'm a famous rapper. Even when the past are all crooked-y. I can
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  show you how to do-si-do. I can show you how to scratch a record. I can take apart the
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  remote control. But I can almost put it back together. I can tie a knot in a cherry stem.
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  I can tell you about Lee Ferrickson. I know all the words today. Colores and I'm proud
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  to be an American. Me and my friends are platypus. Me and my friend made a comic book. And
[08:44.000 --> 08:49.000]  guess how long it took? I can't do anything that I want. Cause look I can keep rhythm with
[08:49.000 --> 08:57.000]  no metronome. No metronome. No metronome. And I can see your face on the telephone.
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.000]  On the telephone. On the telephone. Look at me. Look at me. Just call to say that it's
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  good to be alive. In such a small world I'm all curled up with a book to read. I can make
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  money open up a thrift store. I can make a living of a magazine. I can design an engine
[09:12.000 --> 09:17.000]  64 miles to a gallon of gasoline. I can make new antibiotics. I can make computers survive
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  aquatic conditions. I know how to run the business. And I can make you want to buy a product. Movers,
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  shakers, and producers. Me and my friends understand the future. I see the strings that control
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  the system. I can do anything with no assistance. Cause I can lead a nation with a microphone.
[09:30.000 --> 09:38.000]  With a microphone. With a microphone. And I can split the atom of a molecule. Of a
[09:38.000 --> 09:45.000]  molecule. Of a molecule.
[10:08.000 --> 10:15.000]  Look at me. Look at me. Driving and I won't stop. And I feel so good to be alive and on top.
[10:15.000 --> 10:23.000]  My reach is global. My power is secure. My cars is noble. My power is pure. I can hand out a million
[10:23.000 --> 10:28.000]  vaccinations. So let them all die in exasperation. Have them all healed from lacerations. Have them all killed
[10:28.000 --> 10:33.000]  by assassination. I can make anybody go to prison. Just because I don't like them. And I can do anything
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  with no permission. I have it all under my command. Cause I can guide a missile by satellite. By
[10:39.000 --> 10:47.000]  satellite. By satellite. And I can hit a target through a telescope. Through a telescope. Through
[10:47.000 --> 10:57.000]  a telescope. And I can end the planet in a holocaust. In a holocaust. In a holocaust. In a holocaust.
[10:57.000 --> 11:04.000]  They're scheduled to be on with us later. You never know what these bands will be on the road.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  You know what's amazing? Universal is putting this out. And I got approached by Universal
[11:10.000 --> 11:18.000]  about 6 months ago. Wanted to put all my films out. And I just said no. Because I don't trust him.
[11:18.000 --> 11:23.000]  But they're putting this out. And that shows they're just caving in to the Anti New World Order
[11:23.000 --> 11:29.880]  New World Order sentiment because it is viral. It is, it is what the people are waking up to
[11:29.880 --> 11:35.800]  everywhere. This song, by the way, is number one on multiple charts right now and it just came out
[11:35.800 --> 11:41.800]  three weeks ago and they got a bunch of other anti-New World Order music and it shows the
[11:41.800 --> 11:46.840]  face scanning cameras, the riot police, all of it, how they're poisoning you with the vaccines,
[11:46.840 --> 11:52.200]  put out by Universal. Maybe I should have rethought that Universal contract, but all those other
[11:52.200 --> 11:56.280]  talk show hosts that hate my guts and are jealous of me, eat your heart out. You'd love to have
[11:56.280 --> 11:59.880]  Universal offering you that, wouldn't you? But see, that's rock and roll, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:59.880 --> 12:06.680]  Alex Jones says no because I am not going to be under anybody's control, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:06.680 --> 12:12.760]  I'm going to do what I'm doing and I'm going to continue my work and I am not going to ever stop.
[12:12.760 --> 12:22.760]  But very, very interesting to see Universal put that out, but I know they've got a label
[12:22.760 --> 12:26.520]  that is doing that now and it's basically all anti-New World Order films,
[12:27.160 --> 12:34.920]  music, because that's the future. I mean, they cannot resist it. Scott McClellan has come out
[12:34.920 --> 12:37.960]  and admitted a whole bunch of stuff, a whole bunch of criminal activities, but the Bush
[12:37.960 --> 12:43.080]  administration is claiming he didn't know. Those are rats leaving the sinking ship. The
[12:43.080 --> 12:47.960]  New World Order itself is attempting to claim that Bush did all of this on his own. You see,
[12:47.960 --> 12:55.240]  Bush had memos written, ordering the military to sexually torture small children,
[12:56.200 --> 13:03.000]  and I'll say this every day. I can't get over it. It's not fun being right when you're talking about
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.280]  a potential Holocaust. It's not, and it is a Holocaust in Iraq, but potential here,
[13:08.280 --> 13:16.040]  it's not fun standing up against hardcore killers who enjoy it. It's not fun being right all the
[13:16.040 --> 13:22.600]  time. It's not fun knowing what's really happening. It's not fun realizing that these people are
[13:23.480 --> 13:29.480]  from another world psychologically, mentally, spiritually. I mean, they really do put
[13:29.480 --> 13:37.240]  sterilization compounds in your water and your food in the air. They really do put toxic
[13:37.240 --> 13:42.120]  poisons in your water in the air. They really did know in the forties when they started it
[13:42.120 --> 13:50.040]  that it was going to hurt you, and it came out in Congress. They did it anyways. We really are
[13:50.840 --> 13:59.000]  dumbed down and blunted and endowed. This really is happening, and they get these poor guys out
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.880]  of the military who even, meanwhile, they send them through federalized police academies,
[14:03.880 --> 14:07.800]  federalized standardized training. They put them out on our streets. They condition them that if
[14:07.800 --> 14:12.200]  we talk back, Taser has beat us. You can put anybody in prison you want just because you don't
[14:12.200 --> 14:18.600]  like them like the flowbots say, but you don't understand, Bubba. You don't understand, sister,
[14:19.400 --> 14:27.480]  that you are under the very same attack we're under. You see, the curtain is falling on the
[14:27.480 --> 14:33.640]  United States. The curtain is falling on our currency. It's falling on our jobs. It's falling
[14:33.640 --> 14:40.840]  on our IQs. It's falling on our health. We are in the grip of genius psychopath scientist
[14:41.560 --> 14:48.280]  who had been contracted for at least 100 years to set up this society by the ruling elite.
[14:48.280 --> 14:52.120]  100 years ago, Europe and the U.S. had been captured by the private banking establishment,
[14:52.120 --> 14:58.600]  and between 150 years ago and 85 years ago, if you want to get technical, but they had pretty
[14:58.600 --> 15:03.000]  much control 100 years ago in this country, total control 100 in Europe, and they were smart. They
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.560]  said, listen, we've studied other elites, how they only usually stay in power a few hundred years,
[15:08.200 --> 15:12.680]  maximum. We want our family dynasties to never be kicked out of power. How do we do it? And they
[15:12.680 --> 15:19.000]  went into the top universities that they were already financing in England, in Germany, predominantly,
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.960]  somewhat in the U.S. and Russia, and they said, we want you to figure out how people operate,
[15:23.960 --> 15:28.920]  how they tick. They already had manuals on it going back to Caesar, and before that, Nebuchadnezzar,
[15:28.920 --> 15:36.920]  you know, had Sanskrit, you know, on how to do it, hieroglyphs, basic ones, and they said,
[15:36.920 --> 15:44.440]  we want you to codify the final revolution, total full spectrum dominance of the human species.
[15:44.440 --> 15:50.680]  We want to know how it all works, how to control them, and finally how to kill the majority of them.
[15:51.400 --> 15:56.280]  And they said, well, we'll have wars, we'll have famine, we'll have staged events, we'll sterilize,
[15:56.280 --> 16:00.200]  and people said, well, they didn't do a very good job. We've gone from a billion people 100
[16:00.200 --> 16:06.200]  years ago to six and a half. Well, yeah. But the point is, is that they sure as hell have been
[16:06.200 --> 16:11.240]  killing us and waging war on us, and then now they've gotten it finally honed down. Listen,
[16:11.240 --> 16:17.560]  I'm not joking around with you people in government. You understand I am putting my whole life on the
[16:17.560 --> 16:31.640]  line. I've done my homework. I know what I'm talking about. Dear God, please listen to me.
[16:34.840 --> 16:40.280]  Get past your mindless power trips in CPS or the police department or the sheriff's department
[16:40.280 --> 16:47.080]  or the bureaucrats or the engineers of this thing. The Washington Post Sunday had a front page story
[16:47.080 --> 16:52.040]  admitting the Bilderbergs run the world. Like what was the exact headline? It was something like
[16:52.040 --> 16:56.360]  They Rule. I covered it yesterday. I just can't handle it anymore.
[16:59.080 --> 17:04.840]  The South American Union was just founded last week, and I was on two talk radio interviews
[17:04.840 --> 17:09.160]  this morning, and one of the shows was saying I was making it up that that didn't exist when it was
[17:09.160 --> 17:16.840]  in AP and BBC. They have preconditioned you to deny. They told you, you know, when you see this,
[17:16.840 --> 17:23.080]  this come, it doesn't exist. It's kind of like telling some guard at an ancient gate at a citadel
[17:23.080 --> 17:37.320]  or a keep, a fortress, a castle, a stronghold, a Bastille. It's like coming to them and saying,
[17:37.320 --> 17:44.280]  now when you see big siege engines rolling up and enemy armies and well, first, if you see smoke on
[17:44.280 --> 17:50.200]  the horizon in dust, dust doesn't exist. And then if you see the siege engines come over the hill
[17:50.200 --> 17:55.400]  and the enemies campfires, those don't exist. And when you see them with a battering ram hitting
[17:55.400 --> 18:00.840]  your front gates, I mean, you know, they sat down the castle guard and they told them it doesn't
[18:00.840 --> 18:06.040]  exist. And so now they're ramming our front gate. It's splintering. We've got enemies within the
[18:06.040 --> 18:11.960]  gates, stabbing the guards, opening the front gates. This huge horde is pouring in and you're
[18:11.960 --> 18:18.680]  still standing around saying, well, they, the media says it doesn't exist. Dear God.
[18:20.680 --> 18:29.320]  You know, I had some woman fax me. They were actually too ignorant to find my fax number,
[18:29.320 --> 18:39.160]  even though it's online or my email, they sent it to the Genesis and it says this. Listen to this.
[18:42.440 --> 18:46.760]  Somewhere I see you're connected to the Alex Jones show. I can't find address for him.
[18:46.760 --> 18:51.320]  He has a right to his opinion. Listen to this is double thing. I could spend 10 hours just on this,
[18:51.320 --> 18:56.760]  this, this letter. He has a right to his opinion. They go on to say I don't. But when he has young
[18:56.760 --> 19:03.000]  global listeners that are running their children's health and could lead to death, see they're running
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.800]  their child's health, the government needs to, it has to stop. I have a granddaughter born with
[19:07.800 --> 19:13.480]  immune system deficiency. She has to be protected. Oh, they love all these new immune system
[19:13.480 --> 19:17.560]  designations they give so they can kill you with the drugs. However, her parents say Alex Jones
[19:19.880 --> 19:25.160]  says shots cause autism, et cetera. No, Alex Jones doesn't say thousands of studies and the
[19:25.160 --> 19:28.840]  government now admits it. I'm going to come back and finish this. Then she threatens me and says
[19:29.880 --> 19:34.040]  that she's coming after me and the child dies. Hey, I don't make you do anything. I'm not the
[19:34.040 --> 19:40.280]  government. Okay. I'm just going to tell you that I don't vaccinate my children. You twit.
[19:40.280 --> 19:45.800]  Don't you threaten me. You scumbag anti-American filth. We'll be right back. I'm trying to save
[19:45.800 --> 19:58.760]  people's lives. Stay with us. Do you know the truth about cancer treatments? Do you realize that with

[20:03.960 --> 20:09.960]  mostly fighting to survive the treatment. Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning,
[20:09.960 --> 20:16.920]  and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary? But now it's cancer's turn
[20:16.920 --> 20:23.400]  to die with lace med inks, patented methodology. Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging
[20:23.400 --> 20:29.480]  radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse

[21:57.640 --> 22:03.800]  from the industrial age to the space age, gold has weathered the test of time. For 6,000 years,
[22:03.800 --> 22:08.200]  gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth. According to the World Gold Council in the U.S.
[22:08.200 --> 22:13.800]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high. The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the
[22:13.800 --> 22:19.800]  common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day. Midas Resources is

[22:52.440 --> 22:57.720]  Hi, this is Alex Jones and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline. It's no secret
[22:57.720 --> 23:02.120]  that gasoline quality is poor even though we're paying record prices at the pump. I have run
[23:02.120 --> 23:07.720]  across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas mileage. Instead of paying
[23:07.720 --> 23:13.000]  a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a complete fuel system treatment
[23:13.000 --> 23:19.240]  cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage and only one tank full. Protect an engine
[23:19.240 --> 23:24.200]  treatment not only reduces friction but it extends the life of your engine. Let's face it, with the
[23:24.200 --> 23:29.000]  high price of gasoline it's time to take action. Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for
[23:29.000 --> 23:35.720]  only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment which is a $12.95 value free. Call triple eight,
[23:35.720 --> 23:44.280]  use SFR1. That number again is triple eight, use SFR1 or check them out online at oilcompanysecret.com.
[23:44.280 --> 23:52.280]  That's oilcompanysecret.com. Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back and it's safe for all cars. Act now.
[24:32.520 --> 24:37.880]  Lobot scheduled to be joining us. Got a number one song out. Just exploded out of nowhere,
[24:37.880 --> 24:47.640]  anti-New World Order music. Got songs like Rise. We are winning. There's a war on for your mind.
[24:50.440 --> 24:59.480]  Okay, let's go ahead and get into this facts that Genesis got from this lady. It says,
[24:59.480 --> 25:05.480]  so where can I see your connection to Alex Jones show? I can't find address for him.
[25:05.480 --> 25:10.120]  He has a right to his opinion, but when he has young gullible listeners that are running their
[25:10.120 --> 25:15.160]  children's health and could lead to death, it has to stop. I have a granddaughter born with
[25:15.160 --> 25:21.160]  immune system deficiency. She has to be protected. However, her parents say Alex Jones says shots
[25:21.160 --> 25:28.040]  cause autism, etc. Well, according to her doctor, if she gets measles or any other childhood disease,
[25:28.040 --> 25:34.600]  she could die and I would hold you and Alex Jones responsible for murder. She can't have my
[25:34.600 --> 25:42.200]  free speech cause I'm murdering people now. We have all been drinking water for hundreds of years
[25:42.200 --> 25:46.520]  actually for our human development of the species, man. We've not just started drinking water hundreds
[25:46.520 --> 25:51.160]  of years ago. We have all been drinking water for hundreds of years and we have not died. Yeah,
[25:51.160 --> 25:56.360]  but they haven't been adding high levels of sodium fluoride that attacks every organ and retards
[25:56.360 --> 26:01.160]  in hundreds of the studies. Thousands show IQ reductions, but hundreds. The average is about
[26:01.160 --> 26:06.520]  a 20 point reduction in the average. Homosapien sapien from about one part per million over a
[26:06.520 --> 26:13.720]  five year period during brain development. So I'm not saying humans shouldn't drink water idiot.
[26:13.720 --> 26:19.800]  I'm saying they shouldn't drink it that's had sodium fluoride and estrogen and prozac added to it.
[26:19.800 --> 26:25.080]  And yes, in Dallas and other cities, it's been in the news that it's higher than it should be just
[26:25.080 --> 26:30.200]  from sewage leakage and it's being found in water supplies that are not connected in any way to
[26:30.200 --> 26:36.120]  in any way to sewage. You understand? It's being added dumbass. Excuse me. I'm sorry, folks. I
[26:36.120 --> 26:43.000]  apologize. This is a family show. I need to control myself. I just I'm trying to save you, you idiot.
[26:45.400 --> 26:49.560]  And you threaten me. They threaten me at the end with murder charges basically.
[26:51.880 --> 26:54.440]  I will hold you and Alex Jones responsible for murder.
[26:55.880 --> 27:00.040]  We have all been drinking water for hundreds of years and have not died. How stupid to say
[27:00.040 --> 27:07.160]  our government is killing us with poison water. God help you fool. We all know Bush is a moron who
[27:07.160 --> 27:11.000]  has ruined the world. So they throw in like this is some left right thing. Hey, Bush doesn't run
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.320]  anything lady. But each person is responsible for their own lives. That's right. I got my free speech.
[27:19.160 --> 27:25.960]  And where else in what country can one say what they feel like saying about government
[27:25.960 --> 27:30.040]  and not pay a penalty? Well, they're trying to get rid of our free speech. I saw like
[27:30.040 --> 27:33.800]  five more videos last night of cops pulling people with romp ball signs on street corners
[27:33.800 --> 27:36.760]  saying you're not allowed to do this. And they go, why? And I go, they go, there's,
[27:37.400 --> 27:41.480]  I mean, you can have tax preparers out advertising dressed up in Statue of Liberty. You can have
[27:41.480 --> 27:46.520]  anybody with sandwich board signs advertising hamburger places, but they pull up and say,
[27:46.520 --> 27:51.080]  no, you don't have free speech. The cop goes just like you can have a gun at your house,
[27:51.080 --> 27:54.360]  but I can have one on the street and you can't, which by the way, you can on the street,
[27:54.360 --> 27:57.480]  the cops is all arrest you if you have a gun out here. Just like I'm going to arrest you if
[27:57.480 --> 28:01.800]  you don't leave with that sign. See, I mean, well, why could we have a sign out before,
[28:01.800 --> 28:05.880]  but now we can't because we're turning into a police state because our freedoms are being
[28:05.880 --> 28:10.840]  destroyed and your criminals, when you do that, and they don't care how many lawsuits they lose,
[28:10.840 --> 28:14.920]  the cops keep doing it because they've been ordered to. And where else in what country can
[28:14.920 --> 28:18.200]  one say what they feel like about saying about the government not pay a penalty for it?
[28:18.200 --> 28:25.400]  Opinion is one thing, but for this guy, and it goes on, he has to stop telling people not to
[28:25.400 --> 28:28.840]  give kids shots. He's going to have a lot of dead kids on his conscience.
[28:31.640 --> 28:37.160]  Mrs. Stone, I'll leave her first name out of it. Mrs. Stone, listen,
[28:39.240 --> 28:43.080]  it is admitted that we've gone from one in 25,000 autistic children
[28:43.080 --> 28:48.920]  two decades ago to one in 68. That was three years ago. The new numbers came out last year,
[28:48.920 --> 28:55.480]  one in 86. And it isn't overreporting of autistic like brain abnormalities and
[28:55.480 --> 29:00.120]  neurological problems. I try, I've taken my children about one movie a year. I took them
[29:00.120 --> 29:05.560]  to see Ratatouille and that I'm telling you, there were probably 200 people in the theater and
[29:05.560 --> 29:12.440]  30 of them were autistic. And I mean, huge wings of every school now just filled with them.
[29:12.440 --> 29:16.360]  And the government admits they finally had their own documents came out in 2000,
[29:16.360 --> 29:21.720]  where they covered it up. They know it causes it. They put it in there on purpose. Now,
[29:21.720 --> 29:27.160]  does your corner doctor do that? They don't know. Okay, this is called eugenics. It's in the eugenics
[29:27.160 --> 29:33.160]  documents. It's in my film end game. They put it in there to hurt you. Now the average person only
[29:33.160 --> 29:40.120]  gets a certain IQ reduction, but with some boys, their blood brain barrier isn't strong. It burns
[29:40.120 --> 29:49.000]  right through in each of the brain. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the
[29:49.000 --> 30:01.240]  GCN radio network. It is a big idea, a new world order. In the near future, earth is dominated

[30:14.360 --> 30:24.040]  order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history,

[31:52.440 --> 31:58.280]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine. Did you know that Congress and President Bush
[31:59.080 --> 32:05.480]  will not close the border with Mexico? Why is this? Many Congress people know the plan for
[32:05.480 --> 32:11.400]  the North American community that will merge the United States, Canada and Mexico into one of the
[32:11.400 --> 32:18.600]  10 global groupings of nations to form a one-world government. This is also why sanctuary cities
[32:18.600 --> 32:25.320]  have been established for illegal felons called aliens. Make no mistake about it. It's an invasion
[32:25.320 --> 32:31.880]  of America without a shot being fired. We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening
[32:31.880 --> 32:37.960]  while offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine. Just call
[32:37.960 --> 32:49.960]  our toll free number 1-800-516-8736. That's 1-800-516-8736.
[33:07.960 --> 33:37.400]  That's amazing music. I've been listening to the whole album on iTunes for the last couple weeks.
[33:38.280 --> 33:41.720]  I love the issues they talk about. A war on for your mind is one track.
[33:43.240 --> 33:50.440]  Rising, rise, we are winning. That's the type of things they talk about. We've got the founder
[33:50.440 --> 33:56.120]  of the FlowBots, Johnny Five on with us. The other MC is Briar Rabbit. Please don't throw me in the
[33:56.120 --> 34:01.160]  Briar patch. They are out on the road loading on the turbos right now. He joins us from a parking
[34:01.160 --> 34:06.040]  lot out there. We appreciate Johnny Five coming on the show with us. Johnny, congratulations
[34:06.040 --> 34:12.920]  on your songs soaring to the top of the charts. Thank you so much. Our heads are still reeling
[34:12.920 --> 34:18.040]  from this chart to believe it's actually happening. You've really exploded. Tell us a little bit
[34:18.040 --> 34:24.120]  about your band, how long it's been around, and what really motivates the lyrics and the powerful
[34:24.120 --> 34:31.960]  mix of different styles of music that people are really enjoying. Absolutely. We started in
[34:31.960 --> 34:37.320]  January of 2005, so a little over three years old. We've just been working really hard those whole
[34:37.320 --> 34:42.920]  three years. First of all, just to blend a few different musical styles. The six of us are all
[34:42.920 --> 34:47.400]  coming from different perspectives musically. We have two MCs and we have a viola player,
[34:49.080 --> 34:54.280]  guitar player, really funk influenced, and then bass and drums influenced by a lot of bands like
[34:54.280 --> 35:00.440]  Tool and the Chili Peppers. We take from a lot of different musical genres and try to cook up
[35:00.440 --> 35:04.440]  something that everyone's going to enjoy. I was talking to you during the break and you said you
[35:04.440 --> 35:09.720]  had heard of Info Wars, but you didn't know that much about it. Particularly, I'm just wondering
[35:09.720 --> 35:17.560]  because I love all the nomenclature you guys are using about truth rising and terms like resistance
[35:17.560 --> 35:24.360]  is spreading, victory is assured. If you just fight back and stand up and you're talking about this
[35:24.360 --> 35:32.600]  whole global system, what formed your political and socioeconomic perspective? What basically
[35:32.600 --> 35:39.400]  molded you, Johnny Five? I can kind of speak personally. I grew up in a church that was
[35:39.400 --> 35:44.920]  real connected to social justice, and it wasn't until years later that I realized how much that
[35:44.920 --> 35:48.360]  had influenced me. But this is a church that's inclusive, it's welcoming of all people of all
[35:48.360 --> 35:53.240]  orientations. It had folks who had been refugees, who were staying there in the church,
[35:53.240 --> 35:58.200]  in the 80s. That whole backdrop was just there as I was growing up. I think that's really what
[35:58.200 --> 36:05.800]  influenced it, the sense that that's what our call is to do in our lifetimes, is to speak up
[36:05.800 --> 36:12.280]  for those who are poor and oppressed in those types of situations. I think in college, it grew
[36:12.280 --> 36:18.120]  legs. Some of those impulses led me to be in Seattle for the World Trade Organization protests,
[36:18.120 --> 36:23.000]  and that was a reformative experience too. And then in more recent years, just working with
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.240]  different community organizations that are trying to implement things on a more neighborhood,
[36:27.240 --> 36:32.600]  local level. That's really what I think my heart is now on. Each person being able to do something,
[36:32.600 --> 36:37.000]  regardless of what's happening systemically, making the community stronger, making ourselves
[36:37.000 --> 36:42.040]  stronger as individuals in our relationships helps us fight some of the larger battles and
[36:42.040 --> 36:46.760]  think through and talk about some of the larger issues. Who came up with that song title, War
[36:46.760 --> 36:52.120]  on for your mind? There's a war on for your mind. Well, the concept of that was Breva Abbott's, the
[36:52.120 --> 36:57.080]  idea that let's make an album called Fight with Swools. He saw this World War II propaganda
[36:57.080 --> 37:03.560]  poster that said Fight with Swools, and the idea was use your industrial skills to contribute to
[37:03.560 --> 37:07.320]  the war effort. He thought, what is the war that's happening today? And of course, this is
[37:08.200 --> 37:13.400]  further towards the ending of the Iraq war, and it really is this kind of war propaganda,
[37:13.400 --> 37:16.840]  war culture that we're being inundated with. And he thought, you know, that that's the war
[37:16.840 --> 37:21.320]  right now that we need to fight is this war for our minds. We're kind of free thought.
[37:21.320 --> 37:25.960]  And so that was, that was, that was his imagery and his concept. And then we formed the album around
[37:25.960 --> 37:32.680]  that. Well, it's amazing. Maybe we can have Breva Abbott on the show sometime. Tell us,
[37:33.640 --> 37:39.240]  tell us where you're from, Johnny Five. I was born in Dallas, Texas, and was in
[37:39.240 --> 37:45.000]  Nackadoches for a brief stint, and then came up here to Denver, Colorado, lives here the rest of my life, except for about seven years in Rhode Island.
[37:46.520 --> 37:53.560]  And so I'm from, from Denver, basically. That's just amazing. I mean, your band,
[37:53.560 --> 37:56.840]  I'd never heard of it until a few weeks ago, I guess everybody else. I mean, most people
[37:56.840 --> 38:02.920]  hadn't either. I mean, it's really taken off. I know that quite a few of your songs are going
[38:02.920 --> 38:06.680]  up the charts right now. In fact, I'm rarely at the shopping mall, but I was there last night,
[38:06.680 --> 38:11.160]  and I'm walking along and I'm listening to the flowbots over the mall speaker system.
[38:11.160 --> 38:16.920]  I wonder how the establishment is, is, and I believe Universal's putting you guys out.
[38:16.920 --> 38:21.480]  I wonder how they're meshing with your anti-establishment message.
[38:22.520 --> 38:26.840]  Well, this is a thing that's really interesting for me. You know, I don't know if I would quite,
[38:26.840 --> 38:30.680]  I don't have a lot of anti-establishment sort of feel to it, but I think when it comes to that,
[38:30.680 --> 38:36.040]  we're pushing for certain things. And, you know, personally, one thing I'm really trying to push
[38:36.040 --> 38:41.320]  for in the album is non-violence, and non-violence not just as the absence of violence, but really
[38:41.320 --> 38:47.080]  as an active force in society. And especially right now with sort of public sentiment turning
[38:47.080 --> 38:52.680]  completely against the war, I don't really feel like there's a, I mean, I feel like a whole
[38:52.680 --> 38:58.360]  lot of people are on the same page. And what, you know, the to-do items right now, the checklist
[38:58.360 --> 39:03.320]  right now is about galvanizing this all into a direction so that we kind of come to a full,
[39:03.320 --> 39:07.560]  complete consensus, you know, publicly and as a nation, that this was a bad idea, and we need
[39:07.560 --> 39:11.640]  to find new ways so this mistake does not get repeated. And so I think you're seeing that
[39:11.640 --> 39:16.600]  with the election, you're seeing that with, you know, go for change and all that messaging and
[39:16.600 --> 39:20.920]  that response. And I think that's what a lot of what our music is about, just saying, you know what?
[39:22.120 --> 39:25.640]  You know, we're going to use whatever platforms we can find. If Universal Music Group
[39:25.640 --> 39:29.640]  is going to support us in this effort, that's great. That's more people we can reach.
[39:29.640 --> 39:34.280]  And, you know, we have a nonprofit organization that also helps back this up with an infrastructure
[39:34.280 --> 39:40.840]  that we're creating right now. Well, I got to tell you that I am just very impressed
[39:41.720 --> 39:46.600]  with what the FlowBots is doing. Break down some of the titles of the tracks and,
[39:46.600 --> 39:51.800]  I mean, really the message of some of the other tracks, not just the handlebar song or the others
[39:51.800 --> 39:58.040]  like War On for your mind. You said, where did they come from? Yeah, I mean, you know, you're
[39:58.040 --> 40:02.520]  saying, well, there's somewhat, not even political, but a social message. But I mean, this is a really
[40:02.520 --> 40:07.800]  strong message. Tell us about the animation that we see in the handlebar song. Who did that? That's
[40:07.800 --> 40:13.240]  just amazing. Yeah, sure. That was a group called Dirty UK. And, you know, Universal actually, you
[40:13.240 --> 40:16.440]  know, fielded several treatments. And we took a look at the different treatments, the different
[40:16.440 --> 40:20.600]  groups that put forth. And, yeah, that was only like the most. It's sort of, it's, you know,
[40:20.600 --> 40:26.520]  cane-enabled, sort of moderate retelling. And then we worked, they worked pretty independently.
[40:26.520 --> 40:30.120]  But we gave them some input along the way. And one thing that was real important to us is that
[40:30.120 --> 40:35.720]  neither side, you know, this is a story. This is a story that is ultimately a tragedy, because
[40:35.720 --> 40:41.960]  these two brothers end up, you know, on opposite sides of these kind of human-created divisions.
[40:41.960 --> 40:46.920]  And then they, you know, there's violence at the end. No one kills the other. But we were really
[40:46.920 --> 40:51.960]  trying to show at the end that it wasn't, you know, good versus bad. You see the remorse on the side
[40:51.960 --> 40:57.800]  of the quote-unquote bad, you know, bad guys. And then you see on the same token, the hostility and
[40:57.800 --> 41:02.760]  violence that comes from the quote-unquote good side. We're talking to M.C. Johnny Fye from the
[41:02.760 --> 41:07.240]  Flowbots, a bunch of their songs shooting up the charts, the top of the charts, handlebars,
[41:07.240 --> 41:12.920]  of course, the most popular. Getting into the war. I mean, we've been there five plus years. We
[41:12.920 --> 41:17.720]  know they brought us there on lives. We know that the White House has been caught trying to stage
[41:17.720 --> 41:24.840]  a U.N. plane shootdowns to start more wars. Now they want to go into Iran. Give me Johnny Fye from
[41:24.840 --> 41:30.680]  the Flowbots' take on the war internationally, but also the police state here domestically.
[41:32.360 --> 41:36.920]  Sure. You know, I want to give the caveat that one thing that's happened, I've also been working
[41:36.920 --> 41:40.920]  in schools the last few years, and I spent so much time either at the school in the day or doing
[41:40.920 --> 41:45.240]  rehearsals at night that I am a little more, I'm a little out of touch as far as the fine details
[41:45.240 --> 41:49.480]  on a lot of this. But, I mean, you know, we have a song in Iraq where we try to just paint two
[41:49.480 --> 41:55.720]  pictures. In 2003, me and millions of other people around the globe organizing before anything
[41:55.720 --> 42:00.440]  had happened saying, this is a mistake. Do not do this. Here's what will happen. They did it,
[42:00.440 --> 42:03.880]  and then it happened. So, and now people are saying, what do we do now? What do we do now? The
[42:03.880 --> 42:07.800]  question is, what do we do now? Well, there has to be accountability. There has to be, you know,
[42:07.800 --> 42:12.120]  if this is a time where it's worthwhile to say, we told you so. This is exactly what happened,
[42:12.120 --> 42:15.640]  and this is exactly why we opposed it, and you did it. So, where's the accountability?
[42:15.640 --> 42:19.080]  Third graders have accountability in their classrooms. You know, if they do something wrong,
[42:19.080 --> 42:23.320]  they're held responsible for it. So, even though it's politically unpopular, I would love to see
[42:23.320 --> 42:28.920]  impeachment. I would love to see something where we make a statement as a country to ourselves and
[42:28.920 --> 42:32.600]  the rest of the world, that this is, that we made a mistake and we admit it. And I think maybe the
[42:32.600 --> 42:37.960]  closest thing we'll get is the election, that's sort of a referendum on that. But I also am really
[42:37.960 --> 42:41.000]  worried about it. I've just seen some recent headlines, I haven't even gotten to read the
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.760]  article, that there's- Yeah, Israel, people inside the White House, two U.S. senators,
[42:46.760 --> 42:51.480]  they're talking about how the war is on in the next few months, a huge bombardment of a country
[42:51.480 --> 42:56.760]  who has no news. But Feinstein and one other, I think Feinstein was one of them. Yes, yes,
[42:56.760 --> 43:01.480]  Feinstein and one other, one Republican, one Democrat, and on top of all this, that was in
[43:01.480 --> 43:08.360]  the Asia times and then in Reuters. But on top of that, we have all this talk about how there's
[43:08.360 --> 43:12.600]  going to be terrorism here and the military is going to be policing the American people.
[43:12.600 --> 43:17.560]  Do you ever question, you know, what's behind this terrorism and how it's been used to take
[43:17.560 --> 43:23.080]  our liberties? You know, I do ask those questions and I need some of the research, I need to watch
[43:23.080 --> 43:28.520]  some of the films. You know, I am familiar with just the Northwoods, Operation Northwoods.
[43:28.520 --> 43:33.160]  Oh, you've heard of Operation Northwoods? Yeah, Northwoods, I'm sorry. And this is also if I
[43:33.160 --> 43:37.800]  need to, you know, brush it more on. But I know the project for New American Century quotes around,
[43:37.800 --> 43:41.400]  you know, what we need is New Pearl Harbor. So, you know, I'm aware of that and
[43:42.600 --> 43:46.840]  and, you know, that's something I need to do more research on. But the bottom line is that
[43:48.200 --> 43:52.600]  we have to figure out how to prevent the next war. And if they're moving towards Iran right now,
[43:52.600 --> 43:55.880]  you know, we need to look at 2002 and 2003 and what worked and what we could have
[43:55.880 --> 43:59.880]  stepped up or we could have escalated. I think more direct action, more people, you know,
[43:59.880 --> 44:04.200]  doing kind of like what they did in San Francisco, but in advance, try to actually
[44:04.200 --> 44:09.480]  physically block the implementation of. Well, I covered Seattle too, and I'm glad you were there.
[44:09.480 --> 44:14.760]  But did you know that the police actually hired provocateurs and then housed them and that they
[44:14.760 --> 44:19.240]  staged some riots and then attacked the peaceful protesters? You were there. I mean, that's an
[44:19.240 --> 44:24.680]  example of a provocateur. And now it's been in the major Canadian papers and the police admit
[44:24.680 --> 44:29.800]  they dressed up to make the other protesters look bad and attack police so they could then attack
[44:29.800 --> 44:34.760]  the peaceful demonstrators just a few months ago up in Ottawa and Montabello. Did you hear about that?
[44:35.560 --> 44:39.480]  I didn't hear about that. I was in, in, in, I think I encountered someone I'm pretty sure
[44:39.480 --> 44:44.680]  was a provocateur in 2000 when I was in the, it was a protest in the democratic convention and it
[44:44.680 --> 44:48.440]  was specifically around Iraqi sanctions. And the police had said, you know, don't climb the fence.
[44:48.440 --> 44:52.760]  None of us were climbing the fence. We were just kind of banging, you know, cardboard coffins on
[44:52.760 --> 44:57.240]  the fence. And there was one guy with stocky guy with a real long hair that started climbing up the
[44:57.240 --> 45:01.320]  fence. Police just said, hey, you get down and I went up and said, hey, what are you doing? We're
[45:01.320 --> 45:06.120]  not escalating this. And he kind of couldn't look me in the eye was sort of saying, oh, it's just,
[45:06.120 --> 45:09.960]  you know, I can't, you know, some people have been doing that for so long. I just sort of fed up
[45:09.960 --> 45:14.200]  with it. He didn't make any sense. And he didn't have any passion that I believe that. Look, I
[45:14.200 --> 45:18.440]  felt like, look, you didn't say, look, you're a cop. But I didn't go that. I didn't. But it's,
[45:19.480 --> 45:23.800]  you know, I know that that exists in Denver. We're thinking a lot about how to be productive and
[45:23.800 --> 45:30.840]  sort of a sort of positive vision during the convention. I mean, it says this is more than
[45:30.840 --> 45:36.920]  coordination to the Democratic Party. And yet what's happening there is also a part of this,
[45:36.920 --> 45:41.400]  I think, positive move in the country. I'm sorry, I'm aware that all that I guess I don't ever want
[45:41.400 --> 45:47.800]  to be debilitated by it. Well, they provocateur. I don't empower it too much. Sure. Well, they
[45:47.800 --> 45:53.320]  provocateur to set the precedent to ban and restrict demonstrations. The the feds trained
[45:53.320 --> 45:57.560]  the some of the Seattle police, the others didn't know they've trained core police all over the
[45:57.560 --> 46:02.440]  country and intelligence units to stage events with high provocateurs or police dressed up as
[46:02.440 --> 46:07.080]  anarchists or demonstrators to then set the precedent for free speech zones and all of this.
[46:07.080 --> 46:11.560]  So this is the government staging events. They've been caught to then come in and restrict our
[46:11.560 --> 46:16.200]  First Amendment. And that's that's the essence of government sponsored terror or the essence of
[46:16.200 --> 46:21.640]  provocateur actions. And it's one of the greatest crimes against humanity to stage events. You
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.360]  can restrict people's rights. Right. Yeah. I don't mean that anyway, downplay. I think it's
[46:26.360 --> 46:30.600]  I think it's incredibly serious. It needs to be to be taken seriously. And I I'm glad that
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.560]  there's people who are working on that. I totally agree with you. We we really admire you. So so
[46:35.560 --> 46:41.960]  so we're going to be there in Denver coming up. Tell us about your tour you're on. I hear
[46:41.960 --> 46:46.600]  you're coming to Austin, Texas. I'm I'll probably come out and see you. You know, I have a bunch
[46:46.600 --> 46:49.560]  of family there in Austin, Texas. And if they're listening here, I want to say hello to them.
[46:49.560 --> 46:54.360]  Um, and we'll be back. I think there will be awesome three different times this time. I know
[46:54.360 --> 46:58.680]  we're doing we're doing that fast. We'll be there before then too on that. Yeah, I don't know if
[46:58.680 --> 47:03.960]  the dates actually set, but sometime in late July. And I'm excited because, you know, I was I was
[47:03.960 --> 47:08.280]  born in Texas and have a lot of family there. And I know Austin has just incredible. Are you
[47:08.280 --> 47:13.960]  going to get booked for ACL? You know, I don't know what that is. I don't know if we are that
[47:13.960 --> 47:19.800]  sounds like ACL. Well, that's a big event. Well, this is just exciting. You know, I'm throwing
[47:19.800 --> 47:25.480]  out all my questions. Any points you want to make MC Johnny five founder of the flow bots?
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.360]  Well, I mean, I think the biggest thing is we're just we're really grateful to everybody that
[47:30.360 --> 47:35.240]  doesn't happen. I mean, at every step of our of our kind of offense on the charts, it's been
[47:35.880 --> 47:40.040]  because people responded to the song. I mean, in some ways it goes without saying, but here in
[47:40.040 --> 47:44.680]  Denver, for example, we, you know, it was a contest. It was a radio contest that got us on
[47:45.400 --> 47:50.280]  on to be there here. And we don't fit neatly into the format that we're on. I mean, we're not
[47:50.280 --> 47:54.760]  really a rock group. We have rock elements, but we, you know, all I do is write raps. I don't
[47:54.760 --> 48:02.600]  think that's the song. It's kind of like hip hop, rock, spoken word, poetry, salsa, jazz. I mean,
[48:02.600 --> 48:07.640]  what would you say the different elements are? I mean, I think hip hop is a primary element.
[48:07.640 --> 48:12.600]  Um, and I think that the sort of alternative or alternative rock is another primary element,
[48:12.600 --> 48:17.880]  but we have classical and we have layers of, of strings and you know, players named McKenzie
[48:17.880 --> 48:21.480]  Roberts, her sister's actually right here, her sister's on the album playing cello. Um,
[48:22.440 --> 48:25.720]  probably we try to blend everything we can just to make these songs that are
[48:25.720 --> 48:30.040]  hopefully powerful and then move people fire out the flow bot website for the listeners
[48:30.040 --> 48:34.440]  listening all over the world right now. Absolutely. So flowbots website is flowbots.com. That's
[48:34.440 --> 48:39.800]  F L O B O T S is no W. Um, but if you want to find out for our street team and get involved in
[48:39.800 --> 48:45.880]  sort of the other side of things and, um, put some of these messages into action, flowbots.org
[48:45.880 --> 48:51.320]  is, uh, is both the name of the organization and the website. Um, and that'll take you to a page
[48:51.320 --> 48:54.920]  where you can sign up to be part of our street team. You know, a lot of bands have street teams
[48:54.920 --> 48:59.960]  that go out there, put up posters, pass out flyers, stick stickers on things. Um, but our street
[48:59.960 --> 49:03.560]  team is really supposed to be an organizing tool where you can meet other people in your city that
[49:03.560 --> 49:07.480]  it can, you know, they want to make a difference locally. Do you think this global corporate
[49:07.480 --> 49:13.080]  government is going to fail? I mean, if the resistance is rising, uh, if, if we can't lose,
[49:13.080 --> 49:17.320]  if we just stand up and speak out, which I totally agree with that when you guys say that,
[49:17.320 --> 49:24.680]  well, what's the exact, uh, uh, slogan you use? Uh, we, you're talking about we are winning.
[49:25.960 --> 49:29.560]  Well, I mean, I was listening to the lyrics just last night and there was a line in there about
[49:29.560 --> 49:35.720]  how long, I mean, we can't lose if we just stand up just fighting back work. We're guaranteed
[49:35.720 --> 49:41.640]  victory. And I think there's two, uh, resistance is victory. I think was the line resistance is
[49:41.640 --> 49:46.920]  a victory. Absolutely. I love it. And obviously that can be interpreted in a lot of different
[49:46.920 --> 49:51.080]  ways. What we're really thinking is, you know, the other line is direct love ones to the trenches
[49:51.080 --> 49:55.400]  when you're talking about, well, sometimes I'll be sheepish about introducing all this to young
[49:55.400 --> 50:00.040]  people. Having worked in schools, you don't want to give people. Hey, don't be sheepish here, Johnny
[50:00.040 --> 50:05.800]  five. Believe me. That's the thing is that I think when you're talking about an actual
[50:05.800 --> 50:10.440]  for your mind, you want every loved one to engage in it. You don't want to, uh, to shelter anyone
[50:10.440 --> 50:14.840]  from, you don't want people to be con and manipulated and controlled and it makes you angry to see
[50:14.840 --> 50:20.280]  people in the dark, not knowing there's a war on for their mind. I got an email yesterday. We got
[50:20.280 --> 50:24.360]  an email as a band from it and I wrapped it from a, a, a troop, a US troop has been deployed to
[50:24.360 --> 50:29.320]  Iraq. He said, I'm being deployed to Iraq, um, in two months and I want to thank you for your music
[50:29.320 --> 50:33.320]  and I want to just say, please don't stop. Um, we know that you support the troops, but I want you
[50:33.320 --> 50:37.320]  to know that the troops support you and there's, you know, people think that we're naive, conservative,
[50:37.320 --> 50:41.320]  blah, blah, blah, but that's not true. We're thinking we are critical of this. We're critical
[50:41.320 --> 50:46.680]  of the kind of military industrial complex that's sending us and I mean, that email meant so much
[50:46.680 --> 50:52.360]  because Johnny five, Johnny five, we're about to break final segment with you. But we're online
[50:52.360 --> 50:56.120]  too right now. We're going to keep talking during the break of republic is on her knees. The forces
[50:56.120 --> 51:00.760]  of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide, but in liberty's darkest hour, there
[51:00.760 --> 51:05.400]  is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up. It is essential
[51:05.400 --> 51:09.960]  that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the new world order master
[51:09.960 --> 51:15.000]  plan. We have a short timeframe to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat. In the

[52:04.440 --> 52:11.960]  Another untold story that you have not been told from. Another untoldstory.com
[52:11.960 --> 52:20.120]  It's been called the woman's lib movement or the feminist movement, but the greatest story book
[52:20.120 --> 52:27.800]  calls it rebellion, witchcraft and even Jezebel. It's story, that story of the woman Jezebel ends
[52:27.800 --> 52:33.640]  with the dogs eating her flesh and lapping up her blood. The story of Jezebel in this country
[52:33.640 --> 52:39.480]  seems to have started with the song hound dog, you ain't nothing but, and so many have become what a
[52:39.480 --> 52:45.720]  female hound dog is. To learn of the seed bed of the Jezebel spirit that is now in our land,
[52:45.720 --> 52:52.440]  one must unlearn what is not so. For example, so many think that in the Adam and Eve story,
[52:52.440 --> 52:58.440]  God told Adam and Eve they were not to eat of one certain tree in the garden. That's not true.
[52:58.440 --> 53:04.360]  It is not what we read in the greatest story book. So many think that in that story Satan
[53:04.360 --> 53:10.040]  deceived Adam and Eve and got them to eat of the forbidden tree. That's not true either.
[53:10.040 --> 53:16.920]  You better reread the story or go to another untoldstory.com for the true story, what it really
[53:16.920 --> 53:21.880]  says in the greatest story book ever written. When you do, you'll learn the seed bed of the
[53:21.880 --> 53:27.720]  ungodly rebellious woman's lib movement that is in the land today called the Jezebel spirit.
[53:27.720 --> 53:55.080]  We tell it at another untoldstory.com, another untoldstory.com.
[53:55.080 --> 54:03.080]  Come, you masters of war, here to build big guns, here to build the big guns,
[54:03.080 --> 54:12.080]  here to destroy, here to build the death planes, here to build all the bombs,
[54:12.080 --> 54:20.080]  here to hide behind walls, hide behind desks, here to hide behind desks,
[54:20.080 --> 54:26.080]  I just want you to know, I just want you to know I can see through your mask,
[54:26.080 --> 54:33.080]  you that ain't ever done nothin', you that never done nothin',
[54:33.080 --> 54:43.080]  but built to destroy, you play with my world, like it's your little toy.
[54:43.080 --> 54:50.080]  We're talking to MC Johnny Five, the founder of FlowBots, we're gonna get him and Brea Rabbit on the next few weeks,
[54:50.080 --> 54:57.080]  while they're on tour, Brea Rabbit wrote some of the songs, like moron for your mind, I can't wait to hear what influenced him for that,
[54:57.080 --> 55:02.080]  but I'm excited to know that you have heard of infowars.com, and it's just, again, to see this exploding.
[55:02.080 --> 55:05.080]  How old are you, MC Johnny Five?
[55:05.080 --> 55:09.080]  You're right, actually Brea Rabbit just pulled up if you wanted to ask him that question.
[55:09.080 --> 55:14.080]  Sure, let's go over and talk to Brea Rabbit right now.
[55:14.080 --> 55:17.080]  I love it, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:17.080 --> 55:18.080]  Hey, how's it going?
[55:18.080 --> 55:23.080]  Hey, Brea Rabbit, this is Alex Jones, I'm really a big fan of your art, your work.
[55:23.080 --> 55:25.080]  Oh, well thank you very much.
[55:25.080 --> 55:32.080]  Listen, with songs like There's a War on for Your Mind, and titles like that, and Rising, and We Are Winning,
[55:32.080 --> 55:36.080]  and what's the other term, Resistance is Victory?
[55:36.080 --> 55:37.080]  Yes.
[55:37.080 --> 55:46.080]  Where did you develop this nomenclature, these ideas, because this is near and dear to my heart, what you're saying and doing.
[55:46.080 --> 55:49.080]  I mean, it's of the same stream.
[55:49.080 --> 55:51.080]  Oh, well thank you very much.
[55:51.080 --> 55:59.080]  A lot of it was just like a combination of kind of using old slogans from actually propaganda posters, World War I and World War II,
[55:59.080 --> 56:08.080]  and the other bit was like taking sound bites and stuff that we actually encounter in the media and trying to turn them back towards people making choices,
[56:08.080 --> 56:12.080]  as opposed to being told what to do.
[56:12.080 --> 56:13.080]  Amazing.
[56:13.080 --> 56:14.080]  Something like a counter-propaganda.
[56:14.080 --> 56:15.080]  Yeah.
[56:15.080 --> 56:18.080]  Johnny Faber said he heard of InfoWars.com.
[56:18.080 --> 56:21.080]  Have you heard of InfoWars.com?
[56:21.080 --> 56:23.080]  I'm sorry, was that heard of who?
[56:23.080 --> 56:25.080]  So you haven't heard of InfoWars.com?
[56:25.080 --> 56:26.080]  Yes, I have.
[56:26.080 --> 56:27.080]  I just couldn't hear you.
[56:27.080 --> 56:36.080]  Okay, okay, I was just curious, because no, I'm glad, but I was wondering, because that's the slogan of my website, InfoWars.com, is there's a war on for your mind.
[56:36.080 --> 56:44.080]  And that's where I actually got that, was from a World War I poster, which was admitting, so I guess we all get it from the same place, which was explaining,
[56:44.080 --> 56:50.080]  hey, troops, don't, you know, think about what the enemy's saying, there's a war on for your mind, and everybody should apply that.
[56:50.080 --> 56:52.080]  So is that what you're doing?
[56:52.080 --> 56:54.080]  Exactly.
[56:54.080 --> 56:55.080]  Exactly.
[56:55.080 --> 57:07.080]  And a lot of the actual imagery that we're using in the first piece, and there's a war going on for your mind, is actually just talking kind of constant barrage that's happening for everybody's opinion,
[57:07.080 --> 57:15.080]  that like in the media and every little bit, like people are fighting for every bit of territory to take away your choice.
[57:15.080 --> 57:16.080]  Amazing.
[57:16.080 --> 57:23.080]  And so you and Johnny Five collaborate on writing the songs, or does he write one and you write another one?
[57:23.080 --> 57:30.080]  Actually, most of our songs, we try to be technologically savvy, so most of the things are actually written on Google documents.
[57:30.080 --> 57:38.080]  And what we do is we'll just like bounce back and forth with those ideas, edit here, edit there, come up with a new stream, you train a thought, and moving along.
[57:38.080 --> 57:45.080]  So it's really just taking the, you know, the terms, the propaganda terms that are out there and integrating it.
[57:45.080 --> 57:46.080]  Wow.
[57:46.080 --> 57:47.080]  Man, impressive.
[57:47.080 --> 57:51.080]  What is it like to be as young as you guys are and to have exploded?
[57:51.080 --> 57:53.080]  I mean, you're supernova.
[57:53.080 --> 57:56.080]  A bunch of your songs are going way up the charts right now.
[57:56.080 --> 57:58.080]  Yeah, Handlebarth is doing really well.
[57:58.080 --> 58:04.080]  We're really excited to see how some of our other songs will perform, because Handlebarth is just one part of the message.
[58:04.080 --> 58:10.080]  And we really would like to get to the other songs like Rides, we're actually talking about some of the hope that we believe is in the equation.
[58:10.080 --> 58:13.080]  I tell you what, Brow Rabbit, I don't want to abuse you and Johnny Five's time.
[58:13.080 --> 58:15.080]  We got a 70-second break.
[58:15.080 --> 58:18.080]  I want to just come back, talk to you for five more minutes and say about it, Johnny Five.
[58:18.080 --> 58:20.080]  Is that okay, Brow Rabbit?
[58:20.080 --> 58:22.080]  That is totally fine. Thank you for your time.
[58:22.080 --> 58:24.080]  You bet. It's the Flowbots, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:24.080 --> 58:29.080]  And they are really kicking butt and taking names of the Info War.
[58:29.080 --> 58:53.080]  And we salute them here at infowars.com.
[58:53.080 --> 58:59.080]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group, but their objective being world domination.
[58:59.080 --> 59:02.080]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:02.080 --> 59:12.080]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:12.080 --> 59:18.080]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:18.080 --> 59:22.080]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[59:22.080 --> 59:24.080]  America is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:24.080 --> 59:27.080]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[59:27.080 --> 59:53.080]  They're after power. Yes, they're after music.
[59:58.080 --> 1:00:01.080]  Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[1:00:01.080 --> 1:00:03.080]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:03.080 --> 1:00:07.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:07.080 --> 1:00:15.080]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:15.080 --> 1:00:20.080]  It's the Info War. Massive news blitz coming up in T-minus eight minutes.
[1:00:20.080 --> 1:00:24.080]  About five minutes left of our amazing guests, Flowbots, blasting up the chart.
[1:00:24.080 --> 1:00:31.080]  Number one, we're talking to Brea Rabbit, who is one of the, you know, main emcees there.
[1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:35.080]  And we got the founder, Johnny Fye, standing by in the wings.
[1:00:35.080 --> 1:00:37.080]  Brea Rabbit, anything else you want to add?
[1:00:37.080 --> 1:00:39.080]  We really are appreciative of your time.
[1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:44.080]  I mean, about what it's like to see your band exploding, what it's like to be able to get this message out
[1:00:44.080 --> 1:00:47.080]  and have so many people listening to you.
[1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:49.080]  It's incredible. It's everything.
[1:00:49.080 --> 1:00:54.080]  It's the beginning steps to what we hope for, but once again, it's just the beginning because
[1:00:54.080 --> 1:00:58.080]  what we're actually hoping for is kind of like a shift in the way the media is presented.
[1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:00.080]  Paradise shift.
[1:01:00.080 --> 1:01:04.080]  Exactly. But the word comes played out and used to sell photos and such.
[1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:09.080]  We're talking about a paradigm shift where like the relationship between musicians and their fans
[1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:12.080]  is not one of commodification, but one of actual relationship.
[1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:13.080]  Integration.
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:17.080]  Yes. And we're moving towards that in all fields.
[1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:21.080]  I mean, communities are purpose. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:23.080]  Exactly. Exactly.
[1:01:23.080 --> 1:01:27.080]  Right now, one of the big problems is we have people who don't even know their neighbors.
[1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:31.080]  We have parents who don't talk to the children and children don't talk to the parent.
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:36.080]  We're living in seclusion within society and what that does is breathe fear.
[1:01:36.080 --> 1:01:40.080]  So what we're hoping to is just kind of open up those doors of communication.
[1:01:40.080 --> 1:01:46.080]  We're calling for an intersectionalism period because neither side is in the right.
[1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:51.080]  Because everybody is just kind of sticking to their own dogma and not actually listening to the human beings behind it.
[1:01:51.080 --> 1:01:56.080]  Corporations, the police, average citizens are backstabbing trash.
[1:01:56.080 --> 1:01:59.080]  And all you see is the blue glow of TV sets in neighborhoods and high-rises.
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:03.080]  We're not communicating and that's how we defeat this dehumanization.
[1:02:03.080 --> 1:02:05.080]  You're right. It's just by reaching out.
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:09.080]  Because everybody is striking from a safe digital distance when they're on their computers
[1:02:09.080 --> 1:02:12.080]  and they're not actually relating to another human being and they can say these things.
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:14.080]  They would never say face-to-face to another person.
[1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:19.080]  They're dehumanizing each other and as such we're not acting human to each other.
[1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:26.080]  Well, there are so few bands that have a really pure message that really understand what's happening
[1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:28.080]  that are really striking at the heart.
[1:02:28.080 --> 1:02:32.080]  I mean, I can think of very few and it is very exciting.
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:37.080]  I mean, I hope you guys, I hope every one of your songs is a super hit and it's so great.
[1:02:37.080 --> 1:02:39.080]  It's such a new sound.
[1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:42.080]  I think you guys are going to end up being really big.
[1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:48.080]  Well, thank you and hopefully the non-profit will actually go with the same amount of success as they could be out.
[1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:52.080]  Explain that non-profit. Explain how your organization works a little bit for us.
[1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:53.080]  Okay, for sure.
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:59.080]  There's one thing to inspire people, but it's also the next responsible step is to try to give people a route for that inspiration.
[1:02:59.080 --> 1:03:04.080]  So right now, for the first year, FlowBots.org is focusing on registering voters,
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:07.080]  trying to get people involved in that process.
[1:03:07.080 --> 1:03:13.080]  But as it grows and as we get beyond this pilot year, we really wanted the feedback to start coming from the fans as well
[1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:17.080]  as they start organizing around principles in their community that they want to take.
[1:03:17.080 --> 1:03:19.080]  America is not actually filled with apathetic people.
[1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:21.080]  It's filled with people who don't know how to help.
[1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:23.080]  Yeah, well, they don't know how to get together.
[1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:25.080]  They don't know how to find real issues.
[1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:26.080]  They feel isolated.
[1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:28.080]  9-11, we were just talking to Johnny Five.
[1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:31.080]  He was saying he questions the official story brought up Operation Northwoods.
[1:03:31.080 --> 1:03:38.080]  Brea Rabbit, what's your take there at the FlowBots or your personal take on 9-11 and government-sponsored terror?
[1:03:38.080 --> 1:03:40.080]  It is another tragedy.
[1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:48.080]  Any loss of life is a shame and is my hope that as we move forward, these things can start becoming outdated concepts.
[1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:57.080]  War, terrorism, whatever this is, I want it to be something that's like smallpox and treated as like a contagion that was once was.
[1:03:57.080 --> 1:03:59.080]  It's something that no longer threatens the world.
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:04.080]  But are you aware of the paradigm of government-sponsored terror, how they provocateur and stage events?
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:11.080]  Yes, and it's the sadness that it filled me with.
[1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:24.080]  But the thing is, if we start talking, if we start organizing, then our government can be a democracy.
[1:04:24.080 --> 1:04:26.080]  But it is not.
[1:04:26.080 --> 1:04:33.080]  It's certainly a corporate talk receipt right now or an oligarchy of sorts.
[1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:36.080]  Gentlemen, we're about to end the main interview.
[1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:38.080]  I just want to say bye to you right now.
[1:04:38.080 --> 1:04:40.080]  We're still going to be on air on the web the next two minutes.
[1:04:40.080 --> 1:04:43.080]  Let me just say bye to you on air.
[1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:46.080]  But we're going to come back for the main network in three minutes.
[1:04:46.080 --> 1:04:47.080]  Stay with us.
[1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:54.080]  People who use Cardiobyte know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:58.080]  For over five years, Cardiobyte has proven itself time-tested.
[1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:02.080]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardiobyte.
[1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:05.080]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[1:05:05.080 --> 1:05:11.080]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[1:05:11.080 --> 1:05:16.080]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardiobyte and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill
[1:05:16.080 --> 1:05:20.080]  now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:27.080]  It's a well-thought-out formula. I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time in liver function is dead on.
[1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:32.080]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:34.080]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[1:06:55.080 --> 1:07:01.080]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[1:07:01.080 --> 1:07:06.080]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[1:07:06.080 --> 1:07:12.080]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity, and loss of weight.
[1:07:12.080 --> 1:07:15.080]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[1:07:15.080 --> 1:07:18.080]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:22.080]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment.
[1:07:22.080 --> 1:07:27.080]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[1:07:27.080 --> 1:07:28.080]  Do your part.
[1:07:28.080 --> 1:07:30.080]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[1:07:30.080 --> 1:07:39.080]  Alkavision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate that raises the pH of the water you drink up to the pH of 10 with only 10 drops.
[1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:46.080]  Order your bottle of Alkavision plasma pH drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[1:07:46.080 --> 1:07:48.080]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:55.080]  Big Brother.
[1:07:55.080 --> 1:07:57.080]  Mainstream media.
[1:07:57.080 --> 1:07:59.080]  Government cover-ups.
[1:07:59.080 --> 1:08:01.080]  You want answers?
[1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:03.080]  Well, so does he.
[1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:07.080]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:07.080 --> 1:08:12.080]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:15.080]  Well, they are probably the hottest, quote, new band.
[1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:19.080]  Been around for three years, but a lot of their music's on the radio now.
[1:08:19.080 --> 1:08:20.080]  Right up there at the top of the chart.
[1:08:20.080 --> 1:08:21.080]  FlowBots.
[1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:23.080]  FlowBots.org.
[1:08:23.080 --> 1:08:27.080]  Anti-New World Order, anti-global corporate plan, slave plantation.
[1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:29.080]  And we're talking to Briar Rabbit.
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:34.080]  And we're also talking to MC Johnny Five as they load up getting ready to go on tour.
[1:08:34.080 --> 1:08:43.080]  I was asking MC Johnny Five when we're on all over the country, AMF, shortwave, satellite, but we're really big in Austin.
[1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:45.080]  And I want people to be able to come out and see you guys.
[1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:49.080]  You happen to have your tour dates in front of you.
[1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:51.080]  Okay, the cell phone just cut out.
[1:08:51.080 --> 1:08:53.080]  I want to be able to try to find out some of their tour dates.
[1:08:53.080 --> 1:08:57.080]  I was looking during the break and was unable to see that.
[1:08:57.080 --> 1:09:02.080]  I actually have his cell phone number if you want to call that back and try to get that on.
[1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:06.080]  Because they agreed during the break for those that were watching at prisonplanet.tv to hold over.
[1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:08.080]  And their phone was crackling.
[1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:11.080]  Then I got a bunch of other news here.
[1:09:11.080 --> 1:09:17.080]  There is just so much of it that we're going to be going over.
[1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:23.080]  I got McClellan's new book about Bush that's getting a lot of media traction.
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:28.080]  Hayden saying Al Qaeda is going to strike any minute and is going to strike when the new president comes in.
[1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:36.080]  You're always going to have your inaugural bombing to start the hero worship of the government again so they can take more of our freedoms.
[1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:37.080]  But amazing.
[1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:41.080]  Got the flowbots on talking about government-sponsored terrorism.
[1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:44.080]  Hope we're able to get them back on the cell phone.
[1:09:44.080 --> 1:09:48.080]  Before we got them on air they were worried this particular cell phone had low batteries.
[1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:50.080]  It's always Murphy's law.
[1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:53.080]  At least today I don't have the phone company breaking in during the live show.
[1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:56.080]  I'm like hello, hello via the ISDN lines.
[1:09:56.080 --> 1:09:58.080]  That's always fun.
[1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:01.080]  But John I know you got three numbers.
[1:10:01.080 --> 1:10:04.080]  Did you happen to write down that cell phone number they gave us?
[1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:05.080]  That's separate.
[1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:07.080]  I may have to have my guy running the show down here.
[1:10:07.080 --> 1:10:11.080]  I am you this number.
[1:10:11.080 --> 1:10:13.080]  You want to come get this number?
[1:10:13.080 --> 1:10:14.080]  Just so we can say bye to them.
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:15.080]  It doesn't really matter.
[1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:19.080]  We had them off for 35 minutes regardless.
[1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:20.080]  But I'm definitely going to get them back on.
[1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:21.080]  Here you go.
[1:10:21.080 --> 1:10:22.080]  There's the number right there.
[1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:25.080]  That's Johnny Five's cell phone.
[1:10:25.080 --> 1:10:26.080]  He gave me.
[1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:27.080]  Okay.
[1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:31.080]  What else was I going to cover here?
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:36.080]  Got to love Murphy's law when a phone cuts out when you're going to somebody.
[1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:37.080]  Some of the headlines I've got.
[1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:40.080]  Government green lights, golf, dollar, abandonment.
[1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:42.080]  Do you know what that should do to the dollar?
[1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:47.080]  San Antonio cops forced blood test on drivers spreading all over the country.
[1:10:47.080 --> 1:10:52.080]  Camp memories of Obama and Ronald Reagan publicly lied and said they liberated death camps.
[1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:53.080]  Just totally made up.
[1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:55.080]  I don't like hating Ronald Reagan.
[1:10:55.080 --> 1:10:56.080]  I don't like hating Obama.
[1:10:56.080 --> 1:10:59.080]  Just a lie is a lie is a lie.
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:03.080]  Rewriting history at Fox and Friends, Carter and Israeli's nukes.
[1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:07.080]  North American parliament meets an integration forum.
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:11.080]  Homeland security agents reveal illegal shotgunning practice.
[1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:16.080]  This is these saturation patrols where they just randomly pull people over.
[1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:18.080]  That happened to me in Austin.
[1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:24.080]  Feds pay the local departments to do this, federalization, but then they also have their
[1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:25.080]  border patrol do it.
[1:11:25.080 --> 1:11:28.080]  The problem is the border patrol goes 100 miles into the country.
[1:11:28.080 --> 1:11:31.080]  I mean, there's so many illegal aliens in and around the border states.
[1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:39.080]  You could go anywhere and find endless numbers, but it's just a police state excuse to harass
[1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:41.080]  everybody and pull people over.
[1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:46.080]  So we'll talk about these immigration roving teams in a minute.
[1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:47.080]  Finishing up here.
[1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:49.080]  You got your cell phone cut out.
[1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:50.080]  Appreciate all of your time.
[1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:53.080]  Do I have a rabbit on or do I have Johnny five now?
[1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:54.080]  Actually, okay.
[1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:55.080]  Johnny five.
[1:11:55.080 --> 1:12:00.080]  I just wanted to thank you and give you guys a chance to talk a little bit more about the
[1:12:00.080 --> 1:12:03.080]  organization and how people get involved in it.
[1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:04.080]  Absolutely.
[1:12:04.080 --> 1:12:08.080]  Well, if you go to flowbots.org, you can sign up for our street team and what we're going
[1:12:08.080 --> 1:12:13.080]  to be doing over the course of the summer is asking people in whatever city they're into
[1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:15.080]  to organize and do a team of folks.
[1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:18.080]  And this year, we're really going to focus on voter registration because we think it's
[1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:21.080]  an important, you know, that's an important, important first step.
[1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:25.080]  But as things develop next year, we'll be looking at, you know, what else can we do?
[1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:29.080]  Kind of as a united group and then people in their local area.
[1:12:29.080 --> 1:12:33.080]  So if you're interested at all, what you hear, sign up for street team, sign up for street
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:35.080]  team at flowbots.org.
[1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:37.080]  And then we'll, you know, we'll get in touch with you.
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:42.080]  And folks, even if you don't totally 100% agree with their eclectic political view, they all
[1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:43.080]  disagree with each other as well.
[1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:47.080]  It's a message of liberty, freedom, getting involved in community.
[1:12:47.080 --> 1:12:52.080]  It's the exercise of getting out, getting involved, integrating with other people, talking
[1:12:52.080 --> 1:12:55.080]  to other people, getting outside the box.
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:58.080]  It is that process that is going to heal our society.
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:00.080]  Do you agree with that statement?
[1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:01.080]  Absolutely.
[1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:03.080]  I mean, one of the things we're going to try to do on this website and really make as a
[1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:08.080]  project of the site is, you know, can we have dialogues that don't devolve into bickering?
[1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:11.080]  Can we have a blog, can we have a message board that doesn't just devolve into name
[1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:12.080]  calling?
[1:13:12.080 --> 1:13:15.080]  Because like, you know, I'm sure there's things we, you know, I disagree with, but we're
[1:13:15.080 --> 1:13:16.080]  having this conversation.
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:18.080]  And that's what, as everything you said is exactly right.
[1:13:18.080 --> 1:13:20.080]  That is how we're going to heal this society.
[1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:22.080]  Well, it certainly is.
[1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:26.080]  And you know, you, the Cent com now admits and the government now admits they hire more
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:30.080]  than 10,000 fake bloggers to go in and call names and start fights.
[1:13:30.080 --> 1:13:34.080]  They even put their own handles on and we go to their MySpace and it's a Cent com guy
[1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:36.080]  wearing a psych warfare patch.
[1:13:36.080 --> 1:13:38.080]  So they don't even deny they're involved.
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:41.080]  Then they have their camp followers that snowball.
[1:13:41.080 --> 1:13:44.080]  That's what they call it mockingbird to repeat what they're saying.
[1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:48.080]  So we know that there is that military industrial complex propaganda.
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:49.080]  You got any comments on that?
[1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:50.080]  Johnny five.
[1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:54.080]  Just that I need to read up.
[1:13:54.080 --> 1:13:56.080]  Well, in closing, I would just tell you this.
[1:13:56.080 --> 1:14:00.080]  I mean, I know you wouldn't call yourselves leftist, but I'm sure you guys from just what
[1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:04.080]  I've seen your writings and what you've said, you understand the globalist, the corporate
[1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:09.080]  interest, own and control the mainline liberal arm as well as the conservative and they play
[1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:11.080]  those two sides off against each other.
[1:14:11.080 --> 1:14:14.080]  I mean, are you guys aware of that?
[1:14:14.080 --> 1:14:18.080]  You know, I would say, yeah, I think there's input, the corporate influence obviously is
[1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:20.080]  across the board.
[1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:23.080]  And I think it is possible for people to go in and try to work within that.
[1:14:23.080 --> 1:14:26.080]  I mean, obviously to the extent we're doing that, I mean, we are connected to corporations,
[1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:30.080]  so we're not going to say we're some sort of sort of purest kind of anti-corporate
[1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:31.080]  authoritarian group.
[1:14:31.080 --> 1:14:34.080]  But I think that's what we're starting to see.
[1:14:34.080 --> 1:14:38.080]  What can you do within systems and the way they're aligned and what can you not do?
[1:14:38.080 --> 1:14:40.080]  Well, Johnny five, let me be clear.
[1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:43.080]  I mean, this changes my view a little bit of universal looks to me like they're caving
[1:14:43.080 --> 1:14:49.080]  in to anti-New World order because I was contacted through universal about carrying,
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:53.080]  you know, getting all my films, basically them buying them.
[1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:55.080]  And I was afraid they'd lock them down and not put them out.
[1:14:55.080 --> 1:15:00.080]  So I said, no, in the last month and a half to a really, you know, great deal.
[1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:04.080]  But then I was talking to some other people and other executives in media and they said,
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:05.080]  no, that's what they're doing.
[1:15:05.080 --> 1:15:08.080]  They realize they can't stop the anti-globalist movement.
[1:15:08.080 --> 1:15:12.080]  And so they're trying, I guess, in a way to go ahead and just put it out because they
[1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:14.080]  can't beat us, join us.
[1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:17.080]  So that makes me kind of question things because they're letting your stuff.
[1:15:17.080 --> 1:15:19.080]  I mean, I mean, number one, you guys are good.
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:20.080]  People like you.
[1:15:20.080 --> 1:15:23.080]  And so they know you were going to break through regardless.
[1:15:23.080 --> 1:15:26.080]  So I'm just saying, watch your six down the road.
[1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:27.080]  Absolutely.
[1:15:27.080 --> 1:15:29.080]  And I think there's always two things to it.
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:32.080]  One is that we're doing something that was already successful here in Denver and people
[1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:33.080]  are excited.
[1:15:33.080 --> 1:15:34.080]  It's not exciting.
[1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:35.080]  People see the opportunity.
[1:15:35.080 --> 1:15:36.080]  They see a business opportunity.
[1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:40.080]  But I also know that the individuals that talk to universal, there's a real genuine,
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:42.080]  you know, share a lot of the views that we have.
[1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:45.080]  And I was about to add a lot of their mid-level execs.
[1:15:45.080 --> 1:15:49.080]  No, I mean, we've convinced a lot of people in the elite or in the mid-level.
[1:15:49.080 --> 1:15:50.080]  I mean, I agree with you.
[1:15:50.080 --> 1:15:52.080]  I talk to these people and they all know.
[1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:55.080]  And so that's why I talk a lot of TV execs, other people.
[1:15:55.080 --> 1:16:00.080]  I mean, I've talked to the heads of major TV networks who say, look, we know it's true.
[1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:02.080]  We want to put it out, but the shareholders won't let us.
[1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:03.080]  So I see the dam breaking.
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:04.080]  That's why I'm so excited.
[1:16:04.080 --> 1:16:08.080]  I see you and FlowBots as the dam breaking.
[1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:11.080]  Well, I'm excited to see where this all flows.
[1:16:11.080 --> 1:16:17.080]  Well, thank you so much, Johnny Five, for all of your time and please thank Briar Rabbit.
[1:16:17.080 --> 1:16:18.080]  Absolutely, I will.
[1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:19.080]  And thank you.
[1:16:19.080 --> 1:16:21.080]  Anything else you want to add?
[1:16:21.080 --> 1:16:26.080]  Just, no, I mean, I just want to encourage people to keep staying in dialogue.
[1:16:26.080 --> 1:16:29.080]  And like you said, if you disagree with someone, take the time to have that dialogue.
[1:16:29.080 --> 1:16:33.080]  Look at the evidence and let's all become stronger and smarter.
[1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:38.080]  All right, I commend you and Johnny Five and list some of the other team for us in closing.
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:41.080]  Not just you and Briar Rabbit, but who else is in there?
[1:16:41.080 --> 1:16:49.080]  So Mackenzie Roberts on Viola, Kenny Yellen drums, Andy Guerrero on guitar, and Jesse Walker on bass.
[1:16:49.080 --> 1:16:52.080]  And then a lot of the album features Joe Farron on trumpet.
[1:16:52.080 --> 1:16:53.080]  He's amazing.
[1:16:53.080 --> 1:16:57.080]  All right, we'll be talking to you soon and I'm certainly going to come see you in concert.
[1:16:57.080 --> 1:16:58.080]  Godspeed.
[1:16:58.080 --> 1:16:59.080]  See you then.
[1:16:59.080 --> 1:17:00.080]  Thank you.
[1:17:00.080 --> 1:17:01.080]  All right, amazing.
[1:17:01.080 --> 1:17:02.080]  There goes Briar Rabbit.
[1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:03.080]  You know what?
[1:17:03.080 --> 1:17:07.080]  Skip ahead about halfway into handlebars and play for about halfway and let that take us out, John.
[1:17:07.080 --> 1:17:08.080]  Just pick a spot and play it.
[1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:12.080]  And then I'm going to take a breath, come back, cover news for the rest of the hour.
[1:17:12.080 --> 1:17:16.080]  And they got more big guests lined up for you here in the heart of the info war.
[1:17:16.080 --> 1:17:21.080]  Tip of the spear, the front lines, ladies and gentlemen, you are on the front lines of the info wars.
[1:17:21.080 --> 1:17:24.080]  We'll be right back after the song.
[1:17:24.080 --> 1:17:53.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:17:53.080 --> 1:18:13.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:18:13.080 --> 1:18:40.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:18:40.080 --> 1:19:09.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:34.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:19:34.080 --> 1:20:03.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:20:03.080 --> 1:20:32.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:50.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:20:50.080 --> 1:21:19.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:21:19.080 --> 1:21:48.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:21:48.080 --> 1:22:17.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:22:17.080 --> 1:22:43.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:22:43.080 --> 1:23:12.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:41.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:23:41.080 --> 1:24:10.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:39.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:24:39.080 --> 1:25:08.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:25:09.080 --> 1:25:36.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:25:36.080 --> 1:26:05.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:34.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:26:34.080 --> 1:27:03.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:32.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:27:32.080 --> 1:28:01.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:28:02.080 --> 1:28:31.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:28:31.080 --> 1:29:00.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:23.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:29:23.080 --> 1:29:50.080]  It's number one on some of the charts, handlebars.
[1:29:50.080 --> 1:29:55.080]  It is a big idea, a New World Order.
[1:29:55.080 --> 1:30:00.080]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[1:30:00.080 --> 1:30:03.080]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[1:30:03.080 --> 1:30:06.080]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:09.080]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew.
[1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:12.080]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[1:30:12.080 --> 1:30:19.080]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:30:19.080 --> 1:30:24.080]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:30:24.080 --> 1:30:28.080]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:30:28.080 --> 1:30:31.080]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:30:31.080 --> 1:30:33.080]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money.
[1:30:33.080 --> 1:30:34.080]  They have all the money they need.
[1:30:34.080 --> 1:30:35.080]  They're after power.
[1:30:35.080 --> 1:30:36.080]  That's their happenings.
[1:30:36.080 --> 1:30:41.080]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com
[1:30:41.080 --> 1:30:45.080]  or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:50.080]  In-game, blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[1:30:50.080 --> 1:30:55.080]  If your body isn't feeling too well these days, you're going to start taking this hemp, I say.
[1:30:55.080 --> 1:31:00.080]  Go to hempusa.org.
[1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:05.080]  You may not like what I'm about to say, but you know I'm going to say it anyway.
[1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:07.080]  The government doesn't want the best for you.
[1:31:07.080 --> 1:31:10.080]  They keep you down. They keep you blue.
[1:31:10.080 --> 1:31:14.080]  They starve your body for all its nutrients.
[1:31:14.080 --> 1:31:17.080]  They won't let you grow industrial hemp.
[1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:24.080]  It really doesn't make any kind of sense when it's so healthy for the world and useful for you, my friends.
[1:31:24.080 --> 1:31:29.080]  I hope Mr. Bush will hear this song for the heart of America wants this one.
[1:31:29.080 --> 1:31:34.080]  Go to hempusa.org.
[1:31:34.080 --> 1:31:39.080]  If you're a true Thurian anarchist or renegade, you only want things that God has made.
[1:31:39.080 --> 1:31:43.080]  Go to hempusa.org.
[1:31:43.080 --> 1:31:49.080]  We offer free shipping anywhere in the states. Go to hempusa.org.
[1:31:49.080 --> 1:31:55.080]  Why should we fire Congress? Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[1:31:55.080 --> 1:31:57.080]  They swear an oath to follow it and then they reject it.
[1:31:57.080 --> 1:32:01.080]  That was their employment document. They haven't followed it.
[1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:03.080]  Congressman, Senators, you're fired.
[1:32:03.080 --> 1:32:05.080]  Washington, you're fired.
[1:32:05.080 --> 1:32:07.080]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[1:32:07.080 --> 1:32:11.080]  Washington, you're fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political system
[1:32:11.080 --> 1:32:14.080]  and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:20.080]  Washington, you're fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster, the president's illegal spy program.
[1:32:20.080 --> 1:32:25.080]  NSA data mining, FISA secret court, the illegal wiretapping of millions of Americans
[1:32:25.080 --> 1:32:30.080]  and the last seven years of terror related spy bills, how they affect you and what you can do about it.
[1:32:30.080 --> 1:32:34.080]  Washington, you're fired captures the spirit and zest of an old fashioned Boston Tea Party.
[1:32:34.080 --> 1:32:38.080]  Ken Williams describes the film as a rabble rousing call to arms.
[1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:41.080]  We invite you to make the change with us. Help take back our government now.
[1:32:41.080 --> 1:32:45.080]  Go to takebackwashington.com and get the video tools you need for the information war.
[1:32:45.080 --> 1:32:50.080]  We have a plan to take back our government. Please visit takebackwashington.com.
[1:32:50.080 --> 1:33:00.080]  You found at the radio show that wrote the book on the fight against the New World Order in the modern sense.
[1:33:00.080 --> 1:33:08.080]  Had a lot of great old guys writing books and meeting people at out back deer camps.
[1:33:08.080 --> 1:33:13.080]  Doing short way radio shows that we owe a lot to.
[1:33:13.080 --> 1:33:20.080]  But as a young man, 22 years old, I'd studied enough history to understand we were in an info war.
[1:33:20.080 --> 1:33:25.080]  And I said this is an info war. This is infowars.com.
[1:33:25.080 --> 1:33:31.080]  So when you support us with the money bomb, you're supporting the radio show that has written the book.
[1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:36.080]  I mean, listen to everybody. That's what they imitate, what they copy, what they push, what they say.
[1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:42.080]  Top hip hop bands, all the other talk show hosts.
[1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:49.080]  And most of the people love me and appreciate my vision.
[1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:55.080]  And my vision is about us all coming together and integrating our ideas and information and moving forward.
[1:33:55.080 --> 1:33:59.080]  I don't even claim to be the end all be all either.
[1:33:59.080 --> 1:34:03.080]  In fact, it's pretty sad and scary that I'm the best there is.
[1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:07.080]  Because I don't have a high view of myself.
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:15.080]  But hell, I could have gone and signed a deal with Universal Studios, ladies and gentlemen, and had millions and millions of dollars.
[1:34:15.080 --> 1:34:23.080]  And I could have signed nine years ago, a million plus dollar year radio contract for five years.
[1:34:23.080 --> 1:34:27.080]  And then it was going to get a lot bigger after that. That was my training wheels.
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:33.080]  And I said no. And these corporate types can't believe it when you say no, no, I don't want your money.
[1:34:33.080 --> 1:34:41.080]  So then am I here grubbing around for money from some money bomb that'll probably bring in 50 to $100,000?
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:46.080]  It ain't what it used to be, baby. That pays for almost nothing around here.
[1:34:46.080 --> 1:34:54.080]  The only reason I've been successful is I take the money we get and I put it right back into the operation.
[1:34:54.080 --> 1:35:00.080]  And, man, I could kick myself about to sign a lease on this big place.
[1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:05.080]  And I missed and didn't notice that Rick Linkletter is moving into the airport and the film studios over there.
[1:35:05.080 --> 1:35:12.080]  I'd heard about it and I'd forgotten. And I missed getting the first lease in on the deter studios.
[1:35:12.080 --> 1:35:15.080]  Oh, man, it's little. It's only like 7,000 square feet.
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:19.080]  But I missed that. I mean, I literally was having nightmares last night about that.
[1:35:19.080 --> 1:35:27.080]  We're about to sign this one lease and I go, oh, my gosh, the deter studios we call and they go, oh, it's only been out for a week.
[1:35:27.080 --> 1:35:31.080]  And there's already one contract being signed today and another backup on it.
[1:35:31.080 --> 1:35:37.080]  Cross my fingers those fall through it. No, no, no. The fact that we didn't, that I didn't think about that or put two into it together.
[1:35:37.080 --> 1:35:42.080]  Oh, man, it'd be great to be in those studios. It's made for voiceovers. It's made for what we do.
[1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:46.080]  It's all, oh, it's beautiful. And it was inexpensive, too.
[1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:51.080]  It's an old house. It's a big old house on 35. Back when that was a dirt road.
[1:35:51.080 --> 1:35:57.080]  They built it like 32. The Heaven helped us. I wanted that studio.
[1:35:57.080 --> 1:36:01.080]  I remember hearing they were going to move about a year ago when I was last over there.
[1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:06.080]  Oh, yeah, we're moving on the leases up in a year after the airport. And then I didn't think about it.
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:12.080]  I'm already brainstorming. It doesn't matter. The point is, is that because I won't come under corporate control,
[1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:18.080]  because I don't trust the big boys that have approached me not once, not twice, but three times with contracts.
[1:36:18.080 --> 1:36:23.080]  Then I have to raise money through advertising.
[1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:28.080]  And our problems would be over if I would sell magic plastic pyramids that heal your cancer.
[1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:32.080]  Our problems would be over if I'd sell these ride machines, which are absolutely bull.
[1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:38.080]  Or magic little stickers you put on your cell phone that unmodulate this frequency. Total bull.
[1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:43.080]  Our problems would be over. But I will not do that. But catch 22. I won't take money for that.
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:48.080]  But then still, it slips through and gets advertised on the network.
[1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:54.080]  And you know what? I mean, you can't win.
[1:36:54.080 --> 1:36:59.080]  You turn down the corporate offers. You turn down the advertising that could float your boat.
[1:36:59.080 --> 1:37:03.080]  Because for some reason people buy crap a lot faster than they buy real stuff.
[1:37:03.080 --> 1:37:09.080]  And but at least we're reaching the people. At least we got the YouTube videos by the millions.
[1:37:09.080 --> 1:37:14.080]  You're reaching millions a day. At least we've got you out there spreading the word about the internet streams
[1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:20.080]  and the AM and FM affiliates and everybody else. And God help us is all I can say.
[1:37:20.080 --> 1:37:24.080]  I know it's sending a lot of people into a fits of rage that I'm having a money bomb.
[1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:29.080]  Other talk show hosts and other websites and Patriot groups. What are you worried about?
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:33.080]  Everything's going to hell in a handbasket. We'll probably be in a depression in a year or two.
[1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:37.080]  Society's unraveling. They're about to attack Iran unless there's a miracle.
[1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:42.080]  They're poisoning the water in the air. Don't you get it? It isn't about ego.
[1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:48.080]  If you wanted to be the big pimp daddy, my stuff would be in every Walmart in the country right now.
[1:37:48.080 --> 1:37:54.080]  I take the paths less traveled as they say.
[1:37:54.080 --> 1:38:01.080]  I'm going to think about what an upright good person I am. How fair I am. How real I am. How genuine I am.
[1:38:01.080 --> 1:38:05.080]  And my whole life I thought everybody else was like me.
[1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:09.080]  And I find out most people aren't. Most people are trash.
[1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:14.080]  And they're trashy in a childish way like a four-year-old throwing a fit over a broken toy.
[1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:19.080]  Let me tell you something, Jackasses. We're in a red level life and death crisis.
[1:38:19.080 --> 1:38:24.080]  You understand how they're feeding on innocence. You understand how this cancer of government and corporatism is growing.
[1:38:24.080 --> 1:38:29.080]  We don't have much time to play games anymore.
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:35.080]  So again, if you really want to know about my finances, this money bomb isn't anything.
[1:38:35.080 --> 1:38:39.080]  This will fill our gas tank for about a month if it's successful.
[1:38:39.080 --> 1:38:47.080]  Don't worry. I've got other finance systems with advertising, video sales, and other things, and inheritance and stuff.
[1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:49.080]  Yeah, that's right. I'll take that and dump it in here.
[1:38:49.080 --> 1:38:56.080]  Okay? This movement comes first. Not my children having any type of savings. Not me having any big savings.
[1:38:56.080 --> 1:39:07.080]  Fight against the new world order comes absolutely. Number one, first, it's what it's all about with me.
[1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:13.080]  Now, if I think Ron Paul could raise $6.7 million with a money bomb, why couldn't we raise a few million dollars?
[1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:16.080]  And that's what the government, our detractors are worried about.
[1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:18.080]  They want the money bomb to die with Ron Paul. They want it to end.
[1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:22.080]  They want it to kind of fizzle out, and it's over instead of me having a money bomb, you having a money bomb.
[1:39:22.080 --> 1:39:26.080]  Don't you idiots understand other talk show hosts who are attacking my money bomb?
[1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:33.080]  Don't you understand that if my money bomb is not successful, then yours sure isn't, but even their perception of it's successful,
[1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:40.080]  this idea of giving, having an effect, because I will use it to have an effect if it was big,
[1:39:40.080 --> 1:39:47.080]  even though you probably wouldn't, that would still help you because people would see what I did with it.
[1:39:47.080 --> 1:39:50.080]  You know, that's it. Can we hook a wireless unit onto this camera?
[1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:56.080]  Can I get people to tour? I guess I could just shoot some video of the studios and the offices we're in.
[1:39:56.080 --> 1:40:01.080]  Do we have a long cable for this camera? Or do we have a wireless unit right now for it?
[1:40:01.080 --> 1:40:09.080]  By the way, we need to order those units for Bilderberg. We haven't done that yet. It's T minus six days till we leave.
[1:40:09.080 --> 1:40:11.080]  I got that going on.
[1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:17.080]  I don't want to sit here and talk about myself, ladies and gentlemen, and the good Lord does provide.
[1:40:17.080 --> 1:40:26.080]  But the reason I'm going to go get this bigger office is we're going to hire more people and fight the new Lord at a better level.
[1:40:26.080 --> 1:40:33.080]  And the reason I'm going to go ahead and shoot for doing at least twice a week or something every day and then maybe a network if the money comes in,
[1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:40.080]  it's a big gamble. I'll have to expend the savings I've got, which has always been an emergency nest egg in case they shut down our accounts
[1:40:40.080 --> 1:40:47.080]  or did something. I can keep operating for a few months, four, five, six months, maybe two months, maybe depending on, you know, what happened.
[1:40:47.080 --> 1:40:52.080]  But I'm just going to, regardless what this money bomb does, I'm just going to go ahead and expend my extra fuel.
[1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:59.080]  That's all it is. It's dirty rags to me. It's piles of cruddy confetti that's devaluing so fast.
[1:40:59.080 --> 1:41:03.080]  So why not put your fellow reserve notes into our operation now?
[1:41:03.080 --> 1:41:08.080]  I mean, in fact, I heard thinking, why should I be embarrassed to ask for money? I've never really done it.
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:13.080]  Why shouldn't I? Because I'll actually spend it on the fight against the new world order.
[1:41:13.080 --> 1:41:19.080]  So having one IT guy, we have one other part time, I'll have two full time and I'll have more editors.
[1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:23.080]  We were up here again last night. I was up here till one. What time are you here?
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:32.080]  Burmese. Burmese is now in the beehive. Three o'clock in the morning. When did you leave? You left at two?
[1:41:32.080 --> 1:41:38.080]  I mean, you know, that's because, and it's not because we don't have the personnel, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:42.080]  And now since I've been saying we're going to hire people, I've had a bunch of people show up at the door wanting jobs.
[1:41:42.080 --> 1:41:46.080]  I don't have the office space. You've seen the anthill I'm in.
[1:41:46.080 --> 1:41:54.080]  And so I thought, because frankly, I have an ego to the point of I'm proud. I'm prideful.
[1:41:54.080 --> 1:42:01.080]  And then that goes before the fall. But only prideful in that I want to do it all myself.
[1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:04.080]  But I need your help, ladies and gentlemen. I can't do all this myself.
[1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:08.080]  I mean, I spend so much time with gas to the info and I don't even plug my videos anymore.
[1:42:08.080 --> 1:42:11.080]  And that's one of the biggest, biggest weapons we've got in the info war.
[1:42:11.080 --> 1:42:15.080]  You want to support us right now? Go to info wars.com. Order the everything special.
[1:42:15.080 --> 1:42:19.080]  Go get a prison planet.TV membership. It gets better and better. You have one a few years ago.
[1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:23.080]  Go get it now. It's really super high quality, CDN, ultra fast servers.
[1:42:23.080 --> 1:42:27.080]  Go tell people about the free podcast. It's free.
[1:42:27.080 --> 1:42:34.080]  How many terabytes is the podcast alone now? 30? 25? I remember you said something like that.
[1:42:34.080 --> 1:42:40.080]  25 terabytes. You know how much 25 terabytes costs to put out a free thing?
[1:42:40.080 --> 1:42:43.080]  So all these sponsors, most of which aren't mine, get heard on the internet.
[1:42:43.080 --> 1:42:50.080]  So Ted sponsors get heard. I carry this whole network on my little turtle shell back, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:55.080]  Do I get loved by the other hosts for that? Unless it's Jack McClammer, butch paw. No, I don't.
[1:42:55.080 --> 1:43:00.080]  I get derision, hate, backstabbing. That's what I get. That's what I get for putting it together.
[1:43:00.080 --> 1:43:06.080]  Doing it all for you, red carpet, blowing open the gates of the enemy strongholds with God's help for you.
[1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:11.080]  What do I get? I get jealousy and hatred because I've got my eye on the prize.
[1:43:11.080 --> 1:43:15.080]  So I'm successful. They don't have the magic because they're not in the right place.
[1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:19.080]  Their mind's not in the right place. Their heart is not in the right place.
[1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:24.080]  And that's why they're not successful.
[1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:30.080]  But let me warn you, being successful in the fight against the New World Order as a frontline general gets you capped.
[1:43:30.080 --> 1:43:38.080]  The enemy shoots at the generals. I haven't liked to announce that I'm the Dark Horse General because it's dangerous.
[1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:42.080]  The enemy knows it, but announcing it will only make me bigger.
[1:43:42.080 --> 1:43:45.080]  For some reason, announcing your success only makes you bigger.
[1:43:45.080 --> 1:43:51.080]  I've actually held back announcing just how big we are, just how huge we are, just how effective we are.
[1:43:51.080 --> 1:43:58.080]  I've even told you the numbers. You have no idea. The tens of millions we reach every week. It's exploding geometrically.
[1:43:58.080 --> 1:44:02.080]  I'm like a comet accelerating towards the sun, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:06.080]  I don't like where I'm going, but it's good for you what I'm doing, so I'm doing it.
[1:44:06.080 --> 1:44:13.080]  I'm trailblazing through hell and back for you.
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:20.080]  And just maybe if I accelerate fast enough at the sun, I'll boomerang around it instead of going into it.
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:28.080]  But I need to accelerate towards the sun and use its gravity in the Info War to get my speed up.
[1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:31.080]  Because we don't have time. We've got to take the New World Order down fast.
[1:44:31.080 --> 1:44:40.080]  You understand they're poisoning your water. I keep saying that. It's admitted they're poisoning you. Government documents.
[1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:54.080]  Fluoride is a toxic sedative, which has a calming effect. A lot of heavy elements have that. Arsenic has a stimulative effect.
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:45:03.080]  It has a calming effect, but also a degenerative effect in bones, every organ, every gland. It calcifies your glands.
[1:45:03.080 --> 1:45:12.080]  You know what chlorine is? The only thing that's more electro-positive than chlorine is chloride.
[1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:27.080]  Fluoride. Fluorine. They put it in your water. Do you understand? Do you read me? Government people, they're poisoning you.
[1:45:27.080 --> 1:45:45.080]  Do you read me? Do you understand me?
[1:45:45.080 --> 1:45:51.080]  That's why it's disgusting to pull up to a checkpoint with cops waddling around. What's in your car? I want to search you.
[1:45:51.080 --> 1:45:58.080]  Play this part of this. This is San Antonio. Listen, it's going to be a bloody weekend getting in your space, pushing boundaries.
[1:45:58.080 --> 1:46:03.080]  Cops on the side of the road are going to take your blood. In some areas of the country they do on the side of the road.
[1:46:03.080 --> 1:46:09.080]  On others, in Dallas, they take you in at least and have a warrant. That's one thing. They do have probable cause.
[1:46:09.080 --> 1:46:15.080]  It looks like you're drunk or stumbling around. But the way they say, if you don't give breath, we'll take your blood.
[1:46:15.080 --> 1:46:21.080]  That's the threat and that's what is official oppression. So that's what's illegal in this. But they're taking it on the side of the road.
[1:46:21.080 --> 1:46:29.080]  I'm going to nurse in a well-lit hospital room. I've given blood a few times for insurance, a few times for surgery, and half the time they can't find my veins.
[1:46:29.080 --> 1:46:39.080]  I've got a thick layer of thick skin. I've got thick skin. I've got redneck, good old boy guts and skin and everything else.
[1:46:39.080 --> 1:46:46.080]  And they can't find us in their chamber with those needles. I swear, man, you think it's some macho thing for me to say?
[1:46:46.080 --> 1:46:52.080]  I'm secretly afraid of what I'll do. Some cop starts coming in with a needle. I don't like needles, folks.
[1:46:52.080 --> 1:47:01.080]  I have to control it. It's like some kind of, it's a phobia. I've had a finger cut off and I've been sliced open before and I compound all these injuries.
[1:47:01.080 --> 1:47:09.080]  But I don't like getting blood taken. I had the flu last year. I was really sick for like four days. I thought it was a flu and ended up being strep.
[1:47:09.080 --> 1:47:17.080]  And I went in and they took blood. I didn't enjoy that. I'll tell you right now. And I mean, you know, I mean a lot of people are on the message board saying, man, I'm going to go crazy.
[1:47:17.080 --> 1:47:26.080]  How would you like it? Cop? Somebody pull you over, pull out a needle. Go ahead and play the stupid thing.
[1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:34.080]  You got that clip of the San Antonio blood taken thing, John? Okay, here we go.
[1:47:34.080 --> 1:47:37.080]  It's going to be a bloody weekend in San Antonio.
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:44.080]  For the first time ever, if you refuse to submit to a breathalyzer, police will take your blood with or without your consent.
[1:47:44.080 --> 1:47:47.080]  Amanda Stanzelis is live with that story, Amanda.
[1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:57.080]  Well, we all know that Memorial Day weekend is a big weekend for barbecues for a few beers, maybe. So the idea behind this no refusal weekend is to keep these roads safe.
[1:47:57.080 --> 1:48:02.080]  But the debate becomes whether taking blood is fair.
[1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:06.080]  This memorial weekend is a no refusal weekend.
[1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:16.080]  Yes, this weekend, if you get stopped by cops because they think you were drinking and driving, you'll be asked to take a breathalyzer. You refuse and they will take your blood.
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:19.080]  I think that's just not fair. It's too easy.
[1:48:19.080 --> 1:48:26.080]  That's enough of it. It's all about how it's not fair. How about it's not constitutional? How about you keep your midst off of me?
[1:48:26.080 --> 1:48:32.080]  And then I got a sick article. Oh, I even forgot about this. This is in last night's stack. I was up here late at night.
[1:48:32.080 --> 1:48:38.080]  And now there's Reuters saying that tasers are good for your heart. I'm not kidding.
[1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:46.080]  And now it says we ought to thank the police because the tasers help our heart. You cannot make this up.
[1:48:46.080 --> 1:48:52.080]  I'm living in the twilight zone. We ought to thank the officer. That's giving you a heart adjustment.
[1:48:52.080 --> 1:49:03.080]  The heart is electrochemical. As low as 10,000 volts, 10,000 watts, excuse me, out of, you know, we'll just go pull up the study for yourself.
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:12.080]  We've looked them up. We've had doctors on. This is 50,000 watts.
[1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:15.080]  It's just amazing.
[1:49:15.080 --> 1:49:22.080]  Incident shows tasers may have affected heart. A quick shot from a taser may have zapped a man's buttering heart back into healthy rhythm.
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:32.080]  Doctors reported on Tuesday and it goes on to talk about how the 28-year-old patient was fleeing police and jumped into a lake in April when the water was still very cold.
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:41.080]  And it goes on to say they shocked him. A cardiologist at Hartford Hospital said in Connecticut, we treated the man.
[1:49:41.080 --> 1:49:50.080]  He was taking an emergency room. Richard said the patient was experiencing an irregular heart rhythm known as artificial arterial fibrillation, possibly as a result of the cold and shock.
[1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:55.080]  After treatment, the patient was eager to leave. He got very combative and started yelling in my face.
[1:49:55.080 --> 1:50:02.080]  That's when I left the room and got security. Yeah. Used to, they would just lock the door and tell you to shut up or they weren't going to treat you. Now they just taser you.
[1:50:02.080 --> 1:50:10.080]  I mean, my dad's a dentist. People freak out and cry all the time when they're there to get wisdom teeth pulled out and he just will tell them real sternly, stop it right now.
[1:50:10.080 --> 1:50:17.080]  Listen, I've got to do this or, you know, or he'll go, okay, I'm going to sedate you. Here's Halcyon. Come back in 30 minutes.
[1:50:17.080 --> 1:50:26.080]  And they're just knocked out and drooling. But no, imagine you have to pull a taser out. I'm going to taser you now because you're throwing a fit while you're scared.
[1:50:26.080 --> 1:50:33.080]  Police, you should have seen me after I had leg surgery when I woke up. I threw a pizza against the wall when I was 16.
[1:50:33.080 --> 1:50:40.080]  God, there's nothing I hate more than narcotics. A few surgeries I've had, folks, when I wake up, I will not take the pain pills, none of it.
[1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:49.080]  I hate them. Gives me a headache, the likes of which you've never just unbelievable. It says they tasered him and they're going to say it's good for him and they love it.
[1:50:49.080 --> 1:51:11.080]  They're right back.

[1:54:12.080 --> 1:54:22.080]  Could be the local priest. Yeah, sometimes Satan.
[1:54:22.080 --> 1:54:45.080]  Comes a man of peace. Yeah, first he's in the background and he's in the front.
[1:54:45.080 --> 1:54:58.080]  Oh, sometimes. Sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace. You tell him.
[1:54:58.080 --> 1:55:17.080]  Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front. Both eyes are looking like they're only rabbit hunt. Nobody's seen through him, not even the chief of Paul is.
[1:55:17.080 --> 1:55:28.080]  You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.
[1:55:28.080 --> 1:55:36.080]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. That's probably four hours a day now and that's not enough.
[1:55:36.080 --> 1:55:46.080]  Come in Sundays. 4 to 6 p.m. Central with a Sunday syndicated transmission because the enemy doesn't sleep in either the way.
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:56:08.080]  It's going to be right to shotgun. I'll be calling in with reports next Thursday and Friday from Chantilly, Virginia. Just miles away from the district of criminals. Jim Tucker joining us in 30 minutes about to have a educator in Texas pumping in with zero tolerance.
[1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:17.080]  You got an aspirin in your lunchbox six months in jail. You drop a banana peel. You get beat up and tasered. So we got video of it. You fall asleep at the desk.
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:26.080]  You're arrested disorderly conduct. Maximum prison grad. A huge meat grinder feeding your children into it.
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:36.080]  Look at these. Look at the story. A man's a regular heartbeat returns to normal at the taser zap. So they're saying, oh, you ought to pay the cops to tase me. It's good for your heart.
[1:56:36.080 --> 1:56:48.080]  Like I told you months ago, you can turn your heart on. It can turn it off. You don't ever know what it's going to do. I saw when they started putting tasers in 10 years ago, there were some lawsuits where cops, a lot of cops are going to be taser officers.
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:56.080]  It's a macho thing. They get tasered to see its effects. And then when, but, you know, every couple thousand cops get attested on ended up having heart attacks or problems.
[1:56:56.080 --> 1:57:01.080]  The department just throw them out and say, taser didn't do that. Shut up.
[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:08.080]  I got to dig those up and have those cops on. You think they care about you cops? They don't care about the troops breathing the depleted uranium.
[1:57:08.080 --> 1:57:18.080]  The VA hardly has health care at our troops. I had some idiot email me and say I was lying about all the maggot deaths going, you're a liar on my message board on prison planet.
[1:57:18.080 --> 1:57:31.080]  I wasn't on the comment section on the stories. I forget. Maggots only dead flesh. Maggots don't eat a human flesh. How could maggots be going up the troops noses at the VA and killing them in Kansas City?
[1:57:31.080 --> 1:57:39.080]  Hey, buddy, it was in the Associated Press and the Kansas City Star and it happened some other places in the country and there's a bunch of varieties of flies.
[1:57:39.080 --> 1:57:48.080]  Whatever this, there's a couple of varieties that eat live meat, but they, they reportedly, these are normal flies and they, they see the sinuses dead.
[1:57:48.080 --> 1:57:58.080]  So they go up there and eat and do a bunch of stuff and then get into the brain. They died of maggots. Don't you call me a liar? Just because you're ignorant doesn't mean that I'm lying.
[1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:13.080]  Just type veterans hospital maggots into Google. Just stop saying I'm a liar out of hand. Start finding out cops.
[1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:21.080]  I've had a bunch of guests on and doctors about it, but don't believe me when I say it's admitted the Germans and the Russians put it in camp water, fluoride to control people.
[1:58:21.080 --> 1:58:32.080]  Go look it up. Go look up the U.S. studies about how it dumps people down. Don't you mean isn't your health worth it?

[1:58:40.080 --> 1:58:45.080]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:58:45.080 --> 1:58:53.080]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Bilderberg group.
[1:58:53.080 --> 1:58:56.080]  What their objective being world domination?
[1:58:56.080 --> 1:59:09.080]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:59:09.080 --> 1:59:18.080]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[1:59:18.080 --> 1:59:21.080]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:59:21.080 --> 1:59:26.080]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their aptitude.

[2:00:24.080 --> 2:00:30.080]  I hope everybody will spend some time on Saturday checking it out and donating even if it's as little as $5.
[2:00:30.080 --> 2:00:35.080]  Because that's what's fun about it and it will go 100% into the fight against the new world order.
[2:00:35.080 --> 2:00:43.080]  100% that way not much taxes will be paid on it on my end because it will all go into business expenses. That's the great part.
[2:00:43.080 --> 2:00:51.080]  That's why I love spending all my money and not keeping much of it for myself in the fight against the new world order because then the bastards don't get any too much of the tax money.
[2:00:51.080 --> 2:00:58.080]  I mean I guess on employees I pay they get some taxes but not on the building, not on computers and a bunch of other stuff.
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:05.080]  I kind of center my life around that. That's kind of how I don't pay taxes. I just spend it all in the business.
[2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:13.080]  You spend 15 grand a month on servers and Uncle Sam doesn't get that. It's all just info missiles firing right down his snout.
[2:01:13.080 --> 2:01:16.080]  I absolutely love it.
[2:01:16.080 --> 2:01:20.080]  I've got a guest coming up here in a moment. I'm going to look at the money bomb.
[2:01:20.080 --> 2:01:29.080]  2 days, 10 hours, 59 minutes, 8 seconds. That's 2 days, 10 hours, 59 minutes and 3 seconds.
[2:01:29.080 --> 2:01:34.080]  2 days, 10 hours, 59 minutes, 0 seconds until the money bomb.
[2:01:34.080 --> 2:01:38.080]  We've got a countdown clock up on infowars.com right now.
[2:01:38.080 --> 2:01:51.080]  Has my IT guy and amongst all his other duties, have you written the little script yet so we can tabulate every 30 minutes or so as the money comes in Saturday because everybody likes that to show the graph going up.
[2:01:51.080 --> 2:01:53.080]  We're going to have that.
[2:01:53.080 --> 2:01:58.080]  I got my limited staff running around trying to buy some better zoom cameras to go cover the Builder Bear group next week.
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:03.080]  We've got a guest coming up. That's enough about the money bomb. I just realized I haven't really talked about it much.
[2:02:03.080 --> 2:02:08.080]  Let's go to infowarsmoneybomb.com and see how many pledges we've gotten.
[2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:13.080]  My old-fashioned internet's taking its time loading a few hours.
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:17.080]  I'm out of my mind, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:02:17.080 --> 2:02:26.080]  I think everybody realizes that. Good thing I lost my mind or I'd have gone insane as Dick Curlis likes to say.
[2:02:26.080 --> 2:02:29.080]  That's a good song. Maybe we should play that.
[2:02:29.080 --> 2:02:33.080]  Or no, is that a George Straits song? Who does that song?
[2:02:33.080 --> 2:02:38.080]  $66,300 has been pledged.
[2:02:38.080 --> 2:02:43.080]  It's only going up a couple thousand a day, folks. We need to see that skyrocket.
[2:02:43.080 --> 2:02:48.080]  We need to see everybody. We got to write an email too to send out to all our folks that have gotten on our email list.
[2:02:48.080 --> 2:02:52.080]  I need a few articles out of NIMO, a few articles out of Waddle.
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:55.080]  Maybe one out of Dyches.
[2:02:55.080 --> 2:03:00.080]  What's in goes by Paul Watson. His real name is Paul Waddle.
[2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:07.080]  And then the guy running my show right now, his name's Perkel.
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:11.080]  This is what happens when you stay up till I left at one. I got to sleep at about two.
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:14.080]  Then I got up at about 6.30.
[2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:17.080]  And I've been exercising again. That's why I'm turning into a maniac.
[2:03:17.080 --> 2:03:20.080]  I'm addicted. I've been exercising twice a day.
[2:03:20.080 --> 2:03:22.080]  I've come and gone completely off the deep end.
[2:03:22.080 --> 2:03:27.080]  I'm doing anything not to cover this news because I'm just sick of it.
[2:03:27.080 --> 2:03:36.080]  Oh, God. C.I.A.'s Hayden proffers nonsense on network al-Qaeda.
[2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:40.080]  Yeah, the media, the Intel Center and others go, there'll be a new bin Laden tape.
[2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:45.080]  Another grandson of ADL had will come out and tell us that they're about to nuke us today.
[2:03:45.080 --> 2:03:49.080]  And sure enough, the video comes out. We're going to nuke you. We're going to kill you.
[2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:54.080]  We work for al-Qaeda. And Hayden says he's sure al-Qaeda has regrouped.
[2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:57.080]  They're trying to catch bin Laden as much as they can.
[2:03:57.080 --> 2:04:00.080]  But al-Qaeda is going to hit even harder once a new president comes in.
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:02.080]  Al-Qaeda will hit us to test the new president.
[2:04:02.080 --> 2:04:08.080]  Yeah, to give the president a new grandstanding ability and to take more liberties and freedoms and launch more wars.
[2:04:08.080 --> 2:04:11.080]  Can you imagine? A lot of conservatives didn't like Obama.
[2:04:11.080 --> 2:04:16.080]  But after the terrorists nuked Chicago, it happened to be his home city.
[2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:21.080]  They got firmly behind him and now appreciate their commander.
[2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:24.080]  They didn't think the first woman president could do it, but she's tough.
[2:04:24.080 --> 2:04:28.080]  I like the way she nuked 14 nations after we got hit by the al-Qaeda's.
[2:04:28.080 --> 2:04:36.080]  I'm glad she's arresting all these people and taking guns. We got to do it to defend the country.
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:42.080]  I like McCain. You know, he may be 76, but after we got hit by the nuke, he became one hell of a president.
[2:04:42.080 --> 2:04:47.080]  Anyway, you cut it. After they released the bio-weapon, McCain got tough and saved America.
[2:05:14.080 --> 2:05:17.080]  Or you would like a book on the history of the Federal Reserve.

[2:07:48.080 --> 2:07:55.080]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:07:55.080 --> 2:08:05.080]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:05.080 --> 2:08:09.080]  Rex Stevens is not his name, that's his pen name.
[2:08:09.080 --> 2:08:16.080]  He writes for texaserotolerance.com.
[2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:19.080]  An earlier, just a side issue when I'm wrong about something I corrected,
[2:08:19.080 --> 2:08:24.080]  I was saying that it's 50,000 watts, it's 50,000 volts in a taser.
[2:08:24.080 --> 2:08:31.080]  But getting back to this, I became aware of this in Austin, Texas in 1996.
[2:08:31.080 --> 2:08:34.080]  And then I became aware of other programs across the country.
[2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:39.080]  I mean, I literally see it, I've probably got 10 stories today in the US and England,
[2:08:39.080 --> 2:08:45.080]  Australia, it's all the same plan, where a child falls asleep, they're arrested.
[2:08:45.080 --> 2:08:47.080]  A child drops a banana peel, they're arrested.
[2:08:47.080 --> 2:08:51.080]  A child drops a tiny piece of cake, they're beaten and tasered, not resisting.
[2:08:51.080 --> 2:08:57.080]  I mean, that's again today that happened, not just a few months ago with the beating over the cake in the cafeteria.
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:00.080]  The teachers aren't allowed to yell at you, they're not allowed to discipline you,
[2:09:00.080 --> 2:09:02.080]  the coaches can't run you until you throw up.
[2:09:02.080 --> 2:09:05.080]  Every time I got in trouble, they do that, I didn't want to get in trouble again.
[2:09:05.080 --> 2:09:07.080]  They just arrest you.
[2:09:07.080 --> 2:09:13.080]  Parents in Houston, Texas, Chicago, Illinois, if your kid, quote, doesn't, their child doesn't finish their homework,
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:15.080]  you're arrested, they call it truancy.
[2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:18.080]  The law doesn't say that's truancy, it's all lawless.
[2:09:18.080 --> 2:09:22.080]  But the parents are so dumb, they call them in and scream at them.
[2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:26.080]  I've been at the family court and watched it and say, sign these forms.
[2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:32.080]  The judge orders you to, they're not allowed, it's just, it's all color of law, all contract fraud.
[2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:39.080]  It's like a car dealer saying, I command you or I'll arrest you to sign that you'll buy a $10,000 Toyota for a hundred grand.
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:42.080]  You go, oh, yes sir, and sign it, yes ma'am.
[2:09:42.080 --> 2:09:49.080]  It's the law to take vaccines, line up with police dogs in St. George County up in Maryland.
[2:09:49.080 --> 2:09:54.080]  We have the state attorney on admitting, well, there's no law that we told him it is.
[2:09:54.080 --> 2:10:02.080]  So I was already aware of this with the ASAP program in 96, 97, 98, was a federally funded program in the county.
[2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:08.080]  And this happened because my camera guy, Mike Hanson, you know, he has good kids that grown up now and married both of them,
[2:10:08.080 --> 2:10:14.080]  and Justin, good old Mike Hanson, his son had the flu.
[2:10:14.080 --> 2:10:19.080]  And I remember, because Mike didn't show up to do camera work for me and he used to come in and work part time.
[2:10:19.080 --> 2:10:23.080]  He wasn't there and I remember calling, where are you? I'm sick, we all got the flu.
[2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:26.080]  And he calls me back, I don't believe what happened.
[2:10:26.080 --> 2:10:30.080]  This guy was cussing and yelling at us and threatening to arrest me and demanding to search the house.
[2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:34.080]  I was so sick, I didn't call for Justin.
[2:10:34.080 --> 2:10:39.080]  And his wife, by the way, worked for Travis County at the time in accounting.
[2:10:39.080 --> 2:10:45.080]  So I mean, he knew everybody down there, he got real mad, had the flu.
[2:10:45.080 --> 2:10:48.080]  And so we found out about ASAP and then we went down to recovering it.
[2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:54.080]  And if you had three tardies, they would count that and starts in the sixth grade, kids are learning it then.
[2:10:54.080 --> 2:11:02.080]  So then you, they would criminally charge you with Texas truancy when one unexcused absence isn't truancy.
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:07.080]  It's 16 unexcused, at least it was then, I don't know what it is now, I haven't read the law yet, I haven't looked at it in years.
[2:11:07.080 --> 2:11:13.080]  16 unexcused in a semester. I mean, it's got to be really bad, 16 before it becomes criminal.
[2:11:13.080 --> 2:11:17.080]  It didn't matter, it wasn't one, it wasn't two, it wasn't three days, it's three tardies.
[2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:24.080]  Then Judge Gene Meir, we've got a newscast for this, I've aired it on my local TV show CBS, said late to class, go to jail.
[2:11:24.080 --> 2:11:30.080]  And it showed Judge Gene Meir and training judges in all the local schools in sixth and seventh grade,
[2:11:30.080 --> 2:11:38.080]  where if you're late to class three times, she goes, sign here and screams at the parents, they sign their kid on probation for a law that didn't exist.
[2:11:38.080 --> 2:11:49.080]  And the little kid's six years old, the dad's going, you know you were bad, say you're sorry, and Judge Gene Meir goes, all right, now you're in probation for six months, you do one thing wrong, you're going to prison.
[2:11:49.080 --> 2:11:52.080]  It's about getting you into the system.
[2:11:52.080 --> 2:12:00.080]  But understanding it's lawless, she is a criminal, it's false charges every time. That isn't true, Judge Gene Meir.
[2:12:00.080 --> 2:12:07.080]  When you're not running around CPS and kids or driving around with your friends with your shaved head, why, you know, we all know.
[2:12:07.080 --> 2:12:13.080]  The point is, why don't you just go ahead, sue me, because you're not, because it's true, everything I'm saying is true.
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:16.080]  For those listening around the country, we don't believe it.
[2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:26.080]  There's no truancy, there's no law. But they trick you into signing. I'm going to shut up now and go to Rex Anderson, who works in education in Texas, or Rex Stevens.
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:29.080]  And just go to infowars.com, we have a link to it.
[2:12:29.080 --> 2:12:36.080]  Texas Public Schools producing criminals and generating revenue. That's all they are is prison integration centers.
[2:12:36.080 --> 2:12:40.080]  Rex, thank you for coming on. Tell us what you've witnessed yourself.
[2:12:40.080 --> 2:12:47.080]  Thank you, Alex. Appreciate being a guest on your show and focusing attention on police in schools. It's a very important issue to all parents.
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:51.080]  And even community members that don't have children in school.
[2:12:51.080 --> 2:12:58.080]  I have been working with the Texas Zero Tolerance Parents Organization for a while.
[2:12:58.080 --> 2:13:03.080]  I'm a volunteer and a contributor to their website when appropriate.
[2:13:03.080 --> 2:13:18.080]  And they really have collected a lot of information on some of the issues that you've talked about about ridiculous treatment of students in school regarding police arrest and even putting them on probation, taking the court and detaining them.
[2:13:18.080 --> 2:13:32.080]  So there are lots of stories they're developing every day and it's important for parents to understand how schools have authority to do this and what they can do about it if they don't think it's appropriate in their school district.
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:36.080]  Now, let's be clear. I'm not looking for special cases.
[2:13:36.080 --> 2:13:45.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's no law. You've got the flu. They show up within hours under ASAP demanding to come in.
[2:13:45.080 --> 2:13:54.080]  You lay your head down, criminal charges. I mean, this is hardcore. Tell them you just heard the horror stories I've seen in Austin.
[2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:59.080]  A, have you seen other ones like that around Texas? B, give us some other cases.
[2:13:59.080 --> 2:14:03.080]  Oh, yes, absolutely. There are cases in just about every school district in Texas.
[2:14:03.080 --> 2:14:08.080]  But the good news, Alex, the good news is that not all school districts operate under those policies.
[2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:18.080]  And what's important for parents to understand in Texas is that Texas has independent school districts, which is different than some other states, but it's very important to know the structure of this.
[2:14:18.080 --> 2:14:31.080]  Texas has independent school districts that are funded independently from the rest of the government. Texas school districts have independent taxing authority from the same tax base that the cities and the counties do.
[2:14:31.080 --> 2:14:43.080]  And it's important for parents to understand that municipal police, county police, and municipal courts and county courts have no jurisdiction on any school property without school board approval in Texas.
[2:14:43.080 --> 2:14:54.080]  Please continue. The cases that you've mentioned, there are many listed on the Texas Zero Tolerance webpage. They've got a site that collects this information.
[2:14:54.080 --> 2:15:00.080]  And they've turned into a valuable source for parents in Texas, and it's even spreading across the nation.
[2:15:00.080 --> 2:15:14.080]  It started out simply because of some involvement in a local small school district that was just unfair and ridiculous. And Fred Hink, along with Eddie Evans and Kurt Lane, are really the co-directors.
[2:15:14.080 --> 2:15:18.080]  I just assist occasionally, but they're the ones that do the really work.
[2:15:18.080 --> 2:15:30.080]  There have been occasions just recently in this school year where I think you probably saw that a girl dropped some cake on the cafeteria floor and ended up having her arm broken by a security guard at the school security.
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:33.080]  All on video. She was polite, did nothing.
[2:15:33.080 --> 2:15:49.080]  That security guard was removed from his job, fortunately, so the school district did continue on with their policies of police in schools, but the important thing to know is that no police have jurisdiction on any school campus without a school board policy,
[2:15:49.080 --> 2:15:53.080]  or on a case-by-case basis by the school administration calling the police.
[2:15:53.080 --> 2:16:00.080]  So the issues are completely under the school board authority when police become involved and arrest students at school.
[2:16:00.080 --> 2:16:11.080]  Now, I want to be clear, federal government got involved, removed other forms of discipline like running boys till they throw up or paddling them if the parents authorize it.
[2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:20.080]  I mean, I was in high school just 16, 17 years ago when they did that. They don't do that now. They've banned dodgeball. They've banned wrestling outside.
[2:16:20.080 --> 2:16:24.080]  Kids need to get this energy out. And so now they just call the police for anything.
[2:16:24.080 --> 2:16:36.080]  So also, government engineering has turned our kids into little brats, and there are some really bad ones, because they took discipline out, now everything falls apart, and then now they throw the book at everybody.
[2:16:36.080 --> 2:16:42.080]  Well, in Texas, it's a little bit different. There is definitely discipline in Texas schools.
[2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:48.080]  In fact, the most recent Attorney General's opinion on carpool punishment in schools, let me give you the summary.
[2:16:48.080 --> 2:16:56.080]  The summary is that school districts can use any force, short of deadly force, to compel a student to comply. That's according to the Attorney General.
[2:16:56.080 --> 2:17:04.080]  And that school districts in Texas can use carpool punishment even against the written objection of the parent.
[2:17:04.080 --> 2:17:07.080]  Now, that's bad. That's bad. It shouldn't be done.
[2:17:07.080 --> 2:17:09.080]  Absolutely. But here's where the control comes in.
[2:17:09.080 --> 2:17:13.080]  You've got to love the state. We can beat your children, but you can't spank your children.
[2:17:13.080 --> 2:17:23.080]  Yeah, it kind of works out that way sometime. But here's the interesting concept, though. Your local school district that's elected by the community actually controls what goes on in your school.
[2:17:23.080 --> 2:17:31.080]  They can actually have a policy that says, you know, the school only come when called by the administration. They have no jurisdiction here at all.
[2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:36.080]  Or they can have the school police working under contractor. They can have their own independent police force.
[2:17:36.080 --> 2:17:43.080]  In Texas, Texas schools have authority to have their own independent police force that answers to a designee of the school board.
[2:17:43.080 --> 2:17:47.080]  Now, tell us about this little boy who had sick family. He put his head down.
[2:17:47.080 --> 2:17:58.080]  Oh, yeah. The article that was on the Texas General College web page under passing the paddle, which is a concept that was developed by the courts that are receiving these referrals.
[2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:09.080]  They call it passing the paddle from the school district. But that's an actual true case. A young boy that had some family emergency the night before and the next day at school, he was a little bit tired.
[2:18:09.080 --> 2:18:12.080]  His mother had gone to the hospital and he fell asleep on his desk.
[2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:26.080]  And I don't really know how the policemen came into the classroom. Probably the school teacher called them or they patrolled the halls, but came in and woke him up, handcuffed him, picked him out of the class and issued him a citation for disorderly conduct,
[2:18:26.080 --> 2:18:35.080]  which is completely independent jurisdiction by the school districts. They can adopt municipal codes or they can adopt penal codes and apply them to student behavior at school.
[2:18:35.080 --> 2:18:50.080]  Well, I see these schools and their little prisons. He also got six months probation. Are you familiar with how they lie and say that three lates is a truancy when a missing a whole day isn't truancy?
[2:18:50.080 --> 2:19:03.080]  Let me clear up what the truancy laws are. There are state laws that compel students to attend school. And school districts are required to file in court under federal requirements.
[2:19:03.080 --> 2:19:10.080]  No child left behind. They are required to, if they accept the money, they're required to have some processes for filing on truancy.
[2:19:10.080 --> 2:19:20.080]  So Texas does. But truancy, here's what truancy is. Truancy is failure to attend school. It's not failure to attend class. The attorney general has an opinion on that.
[2:19:20.080 --> 2:19:32.080]  And he states very clearly that if a student is at school and doesn't go to class, that's not truancy because they are at school and failure to go to class is a rule violation, not a criminal violation.
[2:19:32.080 --> 2:19:41.080]  It's three unexcused absences in four months or ten unexcused absences in four weeks or ten unexcused absences.
[2:19:41.080 --> 2:19:48.080]  Okay, so they've tightened it down, but still being late to class three times is not all kind of.
[2:19:48.080 --> 2:19:54.080]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[2:19:54.080 --> 2:20:01.080]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans at the Center for Disease Control reports of suffering from internal parasites.

[2:20:46.080 --> 2:21:00.080]  Hello, Ted Anderson. Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[2:21:00.080 --> 2:21:06.080]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[2:21:06.080 --> 2:21:13.080]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run, followed by a depressed economy.
[2:21:13.080 --> 2:21:19.080]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[2:21:19.080 --> 2:21:32.080]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation. In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:46.080]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years. For more information, call 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.

[2:24:10.080 --> 2:24:21.080]  Talking to Rex Stevens and he's written some amazing articles for texaserotolerance.com. Give us some more of the horror stories that are going on, sir.
[2:24:21.080 --> 2:24:31.080]  Interesting situation that's there in your town in Austin is another school in Austin that was very proud of the concept that they developed a policy to make kids go to class by.
[2:24:31.080 --> 2:24:49.080]  You mentioned filing on them for truancy if they failed to go to class. Well, I don't know if it was that same school in your town or another one, but they published an article about how proud they were of their system that if the students weren't to class before the party bell rang, they shut the classroom door and lock it.
[2:24:49.080 --> 2:24:53.080]  And everybody in the hall was issued a citation for trespassing.
[2:24:53.080 --> 2:25:06.080]  And then they get you on criminal charges. But of course that's fraud because you invite them in as a learning environment and then make it a prison grid.
[2:25:06.080 --> 2:25:10.080]  Oh, absolutely. There aren't no trespassing signs posted for the students.
[2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:19.080]  I understand government's God, I understand they're kings. But who can deny we're in a police state here, Rex?
[2:25:19.080 --> 2:25:25.080]  Well, that seems to be the system that's being moved in on us and they're training the children to accept it. It looks like to me.
[2:25:25.080 --> 2:25:29.080]  Thumbs scanning to get school lunches. Give us some more horror stories.
[2:25:29.080 --> 2:25:39.080]  Well, you have all kinds of situations with children with special needs where it shows up a lot. You have a special education student that has identified disabilities.
[2:25:39.080 --> 2:25:45.080]  And some of those children act out. They're emotionally disturbed. They have different disabilities.
[2:25:45.080 --> 2:25:48.080]  And the government freaks out any excuse to Taser or attack.
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:54.080]  Well, yeah, the schools are supposed to establish individual behavior plans or individual education plans.
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:57.080]  And then the schools, the teachers are supposed to follow it.
[2:25:57.080 --> 2:26:00.080]  But oftentimes these children act out and require a little bit of attention.
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:07.080]  So if the school is able to criminalize their behavior as opposed to meet their unmet needs from their learning disability,
[2:26:07.080 --> 2:26:11.080]  then they're relieved of some responsibility if they can have the child taken to court.
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:21.080]  That's one of the mechanisms that's been in effect since around 1975. The schools have raised some confusion between students with severe educational needs and then criminalize their behavior.
[2:26:21.080 --> 2:26:25.080]  Well, you always hear about them Taser-ing autistic kids or the kid won't get out of their seats.
[2:26:25.080 --> 2:26:29.080]  They call cops in and they Taser them and the child's autistic.
[2:26:29.080 --> 2:26:32.080]  I see those every week in the news around the country.
[2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:36.080]  I mean, how to have cops gotten to the point where they Taser a retarded kid?
[2:26:36.080 --> 2:26:41.080]  I mean, hopefully I haven't heard of any cases of Taser in Texas yet.
[2:26:41.080 --> 2:26:42.080]  Oh, not in Texas.
[2:26:42.080 --> 2:26:46.080]  If anybody hears about that, please go to Google.
[2:26:46.080 --> 2:26:50.080]  Google police Taser and they're retarded and it'll be everywhere.
[2:26:50.080 --> 2:27:02.080]  Oh, absolutely. However, this website is for parents and it gives them a lot of information that they can battle these different issues in their schools and protect their own children if the school doesn't.
[2:27:02.080 --> 2:27:06.080]  I encourage you all to go to there and cruise through the articles.
[2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:16.080]  There were some by attorneys, some by the wellers one, particularly by the American Bar Association on their opposition to zero tolerance in the schools.
[2:27:16.080 --> 2:27:26.080]  And just explain why this parents organization called it Texas Zero Tolerance is because it's a parents organization that has a zero tolerance for schools treating children poorly.
[2:27:26.080 --> 2:27:28.080]  And that's their position.
[2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:40.080]  And they've been quite successful in bringing attention to some of the more important issues and certainly had some strong effects on the school district that the parents live in that initiated this whole program.
[2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:41.080]  Well, here's the deal.
[2:27:41.080 --> 2:27:44.080]  The military industrial complex runs the red light cameras.
[2:27:44.080 --> 2:27:45.080]  They train the police.
[2:27:45.080 --> 2:27:56.080]  They've made us an arms market and they now are financing with federal grants, as you know, to basically take over the schools and do all this and they want these to be their new prison industry.
[2:27:56.080 --> 2:28:00.080]  And I don't know how any parent would put their child in a government training camp.
[2:28:00.080 --> 2:28:04.080]  I know there are some decent public schools, but they're now the minority.
[2:28:04.080 --> 2:28:06.080]  And I mean, these places are scary.
[2:28:06.080 --> 2:28:13.080]  Well, Texas is unique in my research because of the.
[2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:19.080]  Rex, your phone was cutting out because of what?
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:21.080]  I think his phone just died or he thinks it did.
[2:28:21.080 --> 2:28:27.080]  Rex, there.
[2:28:27.080 --> 2:28:29.080]  Yeah, Rex, I think your phone cut out for a minute.
[2:28:29.080 --> 2:28:30.080]  Go ahead.
[2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:32.080]  Yeah, I got another one right now.
[2:28:32.080 --> 2:28:33.080]  That's okay.
[2:28:33.080 --> 2:28:34.080]  Go ahead and turn the radio off.
[2:28:34.080 --> 2:28:35.080]  Texas is unique.
[2:28:35.080 --> 2:28:36.080]  Why?
[2:28:36.080 --> 2:28:37.080]  Yeah, Texas is.
[2:28:37.080 --> 2:28:38.080]  Hold on.
[2:28:38.080 --> 2:28:39.080]  Let me get the radio off.
[2:28:39.080 --> 2:28:40.080]  Texas is unique.
[2:28:40.080 --> 2:28:42.080]  Protect your own children if the school doesn't.
[2:28:42.080 --> 2:28:44.080]  I'm sorry about this phone.
[2:28:44.080 --> 2:28:52.080]  Yeah, we're not going to be able to keep doing this.
[2:28:52.080 --> 2:28:54.080]  Rex, go ahead now.
[2:28:54.080 --> 2:28:56.080]  You got to turn that radio off.
[2:28:56.080 --> 2:28:57.080]  Yeah, you're there.
[2:28:57.080 --> 2:28:58.080]  Yes, sir.
[2:28:58.080 --> 2:28:59.080]  Go ahead now.
[2:28:59.080 --> 2:29:00.080]  Okay.
[2:29:00.080 --> 2:29:01.080]  Sorry.
[2:29:01.080 --> 2:29:05.080]  We have independent school districts and the authority of the independent school district
[2:29:05.080 --> 2:29:08.080]  school board is awesome.
[2:29:08.080 --> 2:29:11.080]  And I wanted to tell you, you know, you've got a lot of Ron Paul listeners.
[2:29:11.080 --> 2:29:15.080]  They need to target running for school board.
[2:29:15.080 --> 2:29:16.080]  I tell you what, stay there.
[2:29:16.080 --> 2:29:17.080]  Come back.
[2:29:17.080 --> 2:29:19.080]  We'll give you three or four minutes on the other side because you got cut short there.
[2:29:19.080 --> 2:29:21.080]  Then Jim Tucker, go ahead and get him lined up too.
[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:23.080]  New Bilderberg developments for next week.
[2:29:23.080 --> 2:29:26.080]  As we count down towards that, then a financial guest coming on next hour.
[2:29:26.080 --> 2:29:28.080]  Rex, if you can, stay there about 10 more minutes with me.
[2:29:28.080 --> 2:29:30.080]  Let's go ahead and get Tucker on.
[2:29:30.080 --> 2:29:32.080]  prisonplina.com, infowars.com.
[2:29:32.080 --> 2:29:37.080]  Stay with us.
[2:29:37.080 --> 2:29:39.080]  We're on the march.
[2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:42.080]  The empire's on the run.
[2:29:42.080 --> 2:29:48.080]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[2:29:48.080 --> 2:29:50.080]  It is a big idea.
[2:29:50.080 --> 2:29:52.080]  A new world order.
[2:29:52.080 --> 2:29:57.080]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:29:57.080 --> 2:30:00.080]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:30:00.080 --> 2:30:03.080]  What their objective being world domination.
[2:30:03.080 --> 2:30:06.080]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:30:06.080 --> 2:30:09.080]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[2:30:09.080 --> 2:30:16.080]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:22.080]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[2:30:22.080 --> 2:30:26.080]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[2:30:26.080 --> 2:30:28.080]  Bilderberg is making great progress for the world government.
[2:30:28.080 --> 2:30:29.080]  Most people have no idea.
[2:30:29.080 --> 2:30:30.080]  They're not after money.
[2:30:30.080 --> 2:30:31.080]  They have all the money they need.
[2:30:31.080 --> 2:30:32.080]  They're after power.

[2:30:45.080 --> 2:30:47.080]  You have been warned.
[2:30:47.080 --> 2:30:51.080]  Hello, I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz, author of 15 books on health and natural healing.
[2:30:51.080 --> 2:30:55.080]  Vaccines included medicines kill more people every year than any illness.
[2:30:55.080 --> 2:30:59.080]  The cost of drug side effects in America is more than $200 billion annually
[2:30:59.080 --> 2:31:02.080]  with the worst toll taken by antibiotics.
[2:31:02.080 --> 2:31:05.080]  But there is a cure for this medical madness that has remained secret.

[2:31:09.080 --> 2:31:14.080]  is an evolutionary new dietary supplement making deadly vaccinations and antibiotics obsolete.

[2:31:41.080 --> 2:31:46.080]  That's 1-877-817-9829. Do it now.
[2:31:46.080 --> 2:31:48.080]  Wake up, Protestant America.
[2:31:48.080 --> 2:31:52.080]  There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to join church and state.
[2:31:52.080 --> 2:31:56.080]  This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics, and Protestant denominations
[2:31:56.080 --> 2:31:58.080]  will form one huge political voting block.
[2:31:58.080 --> 2:32:02.080]  Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and morality by legislation.
[2:32:02.080 --> 2:32:07.080]  Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this freedom, liberty of conscience.
[2:32:07.080 --> 2:32:12.080]  History and the Bible prove to them that these two systems, church and state, must be kept separate.
[2:32:12.080 --> 2:32:16.080]  It must be our love of God and of country that prompts or constrains us.
[2:32:16.080 --> 2:32:18.080]  This will change the character, not civil enforcement.
[2:32:18.080 --> 2:32:22.080]  From history we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome,
[2:32:22.080 --> 2:32:24.080]  religious intolerance resulted.
[2:32:24.080 --> 2:32:27.080]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[2:32:27.080 --> 2:32:30.080]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[2:32:30.080 --> 2:32:33.080]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late.
[2:32:33.080 --> 2:32:35.080]  The prophecies are fast-fulfilling.
[2:32:35.080 --> 2:32:40.080]  Jesus is coming soon for free materials call 888-211-1715
[2:32:40.080 --> 2:33:01.080]  or write the Bible says Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee 37771.
[2:33:01.080 --> 2:33:06.080]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[2:33:06.080 --> 2:33:11.080]  Said I jumped up to the sea.
[2:33:11.080 --> 2:33:14.080]  There's too much confusion.
[2:33:14.080 --> 2:33:16.080]  So many people.
[2:33:16.080 --> 2:33:19.080]  I can't get no relief.
[2:33:19.080 --> 2:33:22.080]  Think that they're part of the power structure.
[2:33:22.080 --> 2:33:26.080]  There were some locals on the talk radio show yesterday here in Austin.
[2:33:26.080 --> 2:33:28.080]  Going, hey oil prices are too high.
[2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:30.080]  They're four bucks a gallon plus.
[2:33:30.080 --> 2:33:33.080]  We need to go in and loot Iraq and take all their oil.
[2:33:33.080 --> 2:33:36.080]  Snickering, giggling, getting real evil.
[2:33:36.080 --> 2:33:38.080]  Don't you understand schmucks?
[2:33:38.080 --> 2:33:40.080]  You're not part of the power structure.
[2:33:40.080 --> 2:33:42.080]  They're looting you too dummy.
[2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:45.080]  When other commoners are being looted, you're going to get looted.
[2:33:45.080 --> 2:33:48.080]  What comes around goes around.
[2:33:48.080 --> 2:33:50.080]  You reap what you sow.
[2:33:50.080 --> 2:33:55.080]  I mean, the average guy making 50 grand a year thinks he's a member of the elite.
[2:33:55.080 --> 2:33:58.080]  And the elites are masters of that.
[2:33:58.080 --> 2:34:01.080]  All I know is is that back when I was a kid,
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:05.080]  all I know is is that back when I fought this 10 plus years ago,
[2:34:05.080 --> 2:34:09.080]  they would take three absences, call it a truancy and falsely charge you.
[2:34:09.080 --> 2:34:14.080]  And we would come in with a law and read it and show out was a fraud and they had to stop.
[2:34:14.080 --> 2:34:17.080]  And then after that, they would say you were trespassing in the school.
[2:34:17.080 --> 2:34:20.080]  If you didn't get in the door on time.
[2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:23.080]  And I was a straight A student my last two years in high school.
[2:34:23.080 --> 2:34:26.080]  I would went to Anderson High School, big high school,
[2:34:26.080 --> 2:34:28.080]  and I'd have one class on one another on another.
[2:34:28.080 --> 2:34:30.080]  And you'd have like five minutes to get from one to another.
[2:34:30.080 --> 2:34:32.080]  And I had so many books, I tried to run to my locker.
[2:34:32.080 --> 2:34:34.080]  I got to where I couldn't do that.
[2:34:34.080 --> 2:34:36.080]  So I carried a huge bag of books.
[2:34:36.080 --> 2:34:37.080]  I would run in.
[2:34:37.080 --> 2:34:40.080]  I had to urinate and then run to get to my other class.
[2:34:40.080 --> 2:34:43.080]  And other kids always got in late.
[2:34:43.080 --> 2:34:45.080]  If it was one of the classes from end to end of the school,
[2:34:45.080 --> 2:34:47.080]  you know, say three floors up.
[2:34:47.080 --> 2:34:49.080]  Now criminal charges, folks.
[2:34:49.080 --> 2:34:53.080]  And I was such a straight A student and so quiet.
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:57.080]  People all thought I was a cop because I'd gone from being this bad student in Dallas
[2:34:57.080 --> 2:34:59.080]  and just wanting to get out of high school.
[2:34:59.080 --> 2:35:01.080]  We're about to go to Jim Tucker here in just a moment.
[2:35:01.080 --> 2:35:03.080]  And I know I've been running over him.
[2:35:03.080 --> 2:35:05.080]  Such great information at TexasZeroTolerance.com.
[2:35:05.080 --> 2:35:07.080]  Before we go to Jim Tucker,
[2:35:07.080 --> 2:35:10.080]  Rex Stevens, who's in education and exposing all this.
[2:35:10.080 --> 2:35:12.080]  How do parents get involved?
[2:35:12.080 --> 2:35:13.080]  How do they learn their rights?
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:15.080]  Do they first just learn this is happening?
[2:35:15.080 --> 2:35:18.080]  How do we go in and take over local school districts
[2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:20.080]  that the feds are funding but we still have the power?
[2:35:20.080 --> 2:35:22.080]  I mean, I think that's the key message here is that
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:24.080]  we do have levers of power, not just in Texas,
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:27.080]  but in some other areas to a lesser extent,
[2:35:27.080 --> 2:35:29.080]  where we can go in and take the schools over.
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:30.080]  Is that what you're saying?
[2:35:30.080 --> 2:35:31.080]  Yeah, absolutely.
[2:35:31.080 --> 2:35:34.080]  Texas has a very unique governance policies
[2:35:34.080 --> 2:35:35.080]  and it's a local control.
[2:35:35.080 --> 2:35:38.080]  There are about 1,200 independent school districts in Texas
[2:35:38.080 --> 2:35:41.080]  and they range from about 80,000 students
[2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:44.080]  down to 150 or less students.
[2:35:44.080 --> 2:35:47.080]  And they're all controlled by elected school boards
[2:35:47.080 --> 2:35:51.080]  from the community that attends that school.
[2:35:51.080 --> 2:35:53.080]  And these are just parents who run for the school board
[2:35:53.080 --> 2:35:57.080]  and they absolutely are where the buck stops as far as all policies
[2:35:57.080 --> 2:35:58.080]  that go on in that school district.
[2:35:58.080 --> 2:36:01.080]  And the problem is a lot of control freaks that want power
[2:36:01.080 --> 2:36:05.080]  look for that and enjoy the pettiness of sitting up there
[2:36:05.080 --> 2:36:08.080]  and preening themselves and acting powerful.
[2:36:08.080 --> 2:36:09.080]  It's disgusting.
[2:36:09.080 --> 2:36:11.080]  Well, there definitely is some boss hog politics
[2:36:11.080 --> 2:36:13.080]  associated with Texas school boards.
[2:36:13.080 --> 2:36:15.080]  Yeah, a lot of money getting stole,
[2:36:15.080 --> 2:36:18.080]  so we need good people who don't want power to get involved now.
[2:36:18.080 --> 2:36:20.080]  I'll give us the website and other tips.
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:23.080]  Well, it's Texaszerotolors.com and that is the best source
[2:36:23.080 --> 2:36:25.080]  of information that I've been able to discover
[2:36:25.080 --> 2:36:28.080]  for parents to learn their rights, learn procedures,
[2:36:28.080 --> 2:36:31.080]  get information from attorneys or from advocacy groups
[2:36:31.080 --> 2:36:34.080]  as to how they can advocate for their child
[2:36:34.080 --> 2:36:36.080]  because really it comes down to the parent
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:38.080]  having the knowledge and being able to advocate
[2:36:38.080 --> 2:36:41.080]  for their own child because if you don't, nobody else will.
[2:36:41.080 --> 2:36:44.080]  Well, they even had a PBS special just a few weeks ago.
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:47.080]  It was mainly about Texas prison industry.
[2:36:47.080 --> 2:36:48.080]  I saw some clips on YouTube.
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:50.080]  I want to watch the whole thing, but they were admitting
[2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:52.080]  that Texas has more people in prison
[2:36:52.080 --> 2:36:54.080]  than we're like number third in the world,
[2:36:54.080 --> 2:36:55.080]  counting us as a country.
[2:36:55.080 --> 2:36:57.080]  US is number one, then China, then Texas.
[2:36:57.080 --> 2:36:59.080]  We were to break Texas apart.
[2:36:59.080 --> 2:37:01.080]  I mean, it's incredible.
[2:37:01.080 --> 2:37:02.080]  That's our business.
[2:37:02.080 --> 2:37:05.080]  And they're going in and lobbying the school districts,
[2:37:05.080 --> 2:37:08.080]  town, city, state to make tougher laws
[2:37:08.080 --> 2:37:11.080]  or have total enforcement to fill the private prisons
[2:37:11.080 --> 2:37:14.080]  and juvenile halls because they've built so many.
[2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:17.080]  I mean, when they're grabbing 11-year-olds
[2:37:17.080 --> 2:37:19.080]  who were straight-A students because they put their head down
[2:37:19.080 --> 2:37:21.080]  in class and giving them criminal charges,
[2:37:21.080 --> 2:37:23.080]  we got a big problem.
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:24.080]  Yeah.
[2:37:24.080 --> 2:37:27.080]  And like I said, the issue in Texas is
[2:37:27.080 --> 2:37:29.080]  your locally elected school board can stop that.
[2:37:29.080 --> 2:37:32.080]  They can have a policy that says we're going to call the police
[2:37:32.080 --> 2:37:34.080]  under certain very limited circumstances
[2:37:34.080 --> 2:37:37.080]  and we expect the school administrators and the teachers
[2:37:37.080 --> 2:37:40.080]  that we hire to implement the discipline management program
[2:37:40.080 --> 2:37:42.080]  that they're required to have.
[2:37:42.080 --> 2:37:45.080]  Texas requires that schools teach self-discipline.
[2:37:45.080 --> 2:37:49.080]  That's a disciplinary technique that has very specific policies.
[2:37:49.080 --> 2:37:52.080]  But I don't see a lot of that going on.
[2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:54.080]  I think running them is the best thing.
[2:37:54.080 --> 2:37:56.080]  Yeah, that works real well.
[2:37:56.080 --> 2:37:57.080]  That's very common.
[2:37:57.080 --> 2:37:58.080]  We've done that for years.
[2:37:58.080 --> 2:38:00.080]  I grew up in the same Texas school as you did, Alex.
[2:38:00.080 --> 2:38:03.080]  Well, the coaches would always think I would even act
[2:38:03.080 --> 2:38:06.080]  like I didn't want pops because I actually wanted those
[2:38:06.080 --> 2:38:09.080]  instead of being run 15 laps until I threw up
[2:38:09.080 --> 2:38:11.080]  with them screaming at me.
[2:38:11.080 --> 2:38:13.080]  And I would, oh, please don't pop me.
[2:38:13.080 --> 2:38:15.080]  I would trick them into giving me a paddling
[2:38:15.080 --> 2:38:17.080]  because that's a lot better than...
[2:38:17.080 --> 2:38:18.080]  Over in a hurry.
[2:38:18.080 --> 2:38:19.080]  Exactly.
[2:38:19.080 --> 2:38:21.080]  Because I could just tune it out.
[2:38:21.080 --> 2:38:23.080]  Well, listen, Rex, I really appreciate you coming on.
[2:38:23.080 --> 2:38:24.080]  I appreciate it, Alex.
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:25.080]  Thank you very much.
[2:38:25.080 --> 2:38:26.080]  Oh, the Ron Paul stuff.
[2:38:26.080 --> 2:38:27.080]  You said...
[2:38:27.080 --> 2:38:28.080]  Yeah, I wanted to encourage.
[2:38:28.080 --> 2:38:30.080]  You know, you have a lot of Ron Paul supporters
[2:38:30.080 --> 2:38:33.080]  and that is the place that they can do the most good
[2:38:33.080 --> 2:38:36.080]  if they want to enter into a political arena
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:38.080]  that is going to make a definite effect
[2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:40.080]  on their family and their lives.
[2:38:40.080 --> 2:38:42.080]  And they need to go out and get elected
[2:38:42.080 --> 2:38:45.080]  to local school boards and stop some of this nonsense
[2:38:45.080 --> 2:38:47.080]  in the schools and go back to real schools
[2:38:47.080 --> 2:38:51.080]  that teach children how to behave and academic as well.
[2:38:51.080 --> 2:38:53.080]  Thank you, Rex, for coming on with us.
[2:38:53.080 --> 2:38:55.080]  And thank you for standing up for these innocent people,
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:56.080]  these poor innocent children.
[2:38:56.080 --> 2:38:57.080]  Thank you.
[2:38:57.080 --> 2:38:58.080]  Thanks a lot.
[2:38:58.080 --> 2:38:59.080]  You bet.
[2:38:59.080 --> 2:39:00.080]  Okay, going to Jim Tucker.
[2:39:00.080 --> 2:39:01.080]  I really appreciate him holding.
[2:39:01.080 --> 2:39:03.080]  I'll be seeing Jim next Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
[2:39:03.080 --> 2:39:05.080]  Saturday, and then Sunday morning.
[2:39:05.080 --> 2:39:09.080]  We're going to be staying at the Hilton
[2:39:09.080 --> 2:39:11.080]  because that's the closest and hard to believe
[2:39:11.080 --> 2:39:13.080]  one of the cheapest in the area.
[2:39:13.080 --> 2:39:15.080]  And that's why we need your support.
[2:39:15.080 --> 2:39:17.080]  It's so expensive to go.
[2:39:17.080 --> 2:39:19.080]  The Chantilly Marriott.
[2:39:19.080 --> 2:39:21.080]  And I've got a big announcement about Bilderberg
[2:39:21.080 --> 2:39:23.080]  coming up at the end of this hour.
[2:39:23.080 --> 2:39:24.080]  Please tune in.
[2:39:24.080 --> 2:39:25.080]  Tell others to tune in.
[2:39:25.080 --> 2:39:27.080]  If you know someone that lives in Virginia,
[2:39:27.080 --> 2:39:29.080]  they can make $1,000 by doing this.
[2:39:29.080 --> 2:39:30.080]  Just listen carefully.
[2:39:30.080 --> 2:39:32.080]  But I wanted to go to Jim Tucker right now.
[2:39:32.080 --> 2:39:35.080]  Jim, you've now learned more about their attempted ruse,
[2:39:35.080 --> 2:39:38.080]  the FULUS that it was in Greece
[2:39:38.080 --> 2:39:40.080]  and with any other new developments.
[2:39:40.080 --> 2:39:43.080]  Jim Tucker, macandfreepress.net.
[2:39:43.080 --> 2:39:45.080]  Yes.
[2:39:45.080 --> 2:39:49.080]  The guys in Europe who collaborate with me every year,
[2:39:49.080 --> 2:39:52.080]  many of them are convinced that Bilderberg
[2:39:52.080 --> 2:39:55.080]  set up this ruse about the place in Greece
[2:39:55.080 --> 2:39:57.080]  where they'd met a few years ago,
[2:39:57.080 --> 2:40:02.080]  being the site of the meeting as of last May or something.
[2:40:02.080 --> 2:40:04.080]  But fortunately, one of our readers
[2:40:04.080 --> 2:40:09.080]  was able to crack through the code of the Dutch
[2:40:09.080 --> 2:40:13.080]  domestic in-house computer.
[2:40:13.080 --> 2:40:15.080]  For the in-house people were told that the prime minister
[2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:18.080]  would be meeting with Bush on Wednesday
[2:40:18.080 --> 2:40:20.080]  and then going from there, from the White House,
[2:40:20.080 --> 2:40:23.080]  to Chantilly for the Bilderberg meeting.
[2:40:23.080 --> 2:40:27.080]  And I called up the embassy and they confirmed,
[2:40:27.080 --> 2:40:30.080]  yes, he'll be attending a Bilderberg meeting
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:32.080]  in Chantilly, Virginia.
[2:40:32.080 --> 2:40:35.080]  So that nailed it down pretty solidly.
[2:40:35.080 --> 2:40:39.080]  And so I'll see you there Wednesday.
[2:40:39.080 --> 2:40:44.080]  Now, Jim Estolin, he has been out of pocket for us,
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:46.080]  even though we've got a cell phone in home in Spain.
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:50.080]  Is Daniel Estolin going to be coming next week?
[2:40:50.080 --> 2:40:53.080]  I don't know. I've not been able to get through to him.
[2:40:53.080 --> 2:40:57.080]  And I think he may be decided to give up,
[2:40:57.080 --> 2:40:59.080]  to let Bilderberg rest.
[2:40:59.080 --> 2:41:02.080]  He's selling his books well and so forth,
[2:41:02.080 --> 2:41:05.080]  but he's, well, he didn't attend last time
[2:41:05.080 --> 2:41:08.080]  because he said his mother was dying.
[2:41:08.080 --> 2:41:10.080]  That's unfortunate.
[2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:12.080]  His mother lost being on her deathbed.
[2:41:12.080 --> 2:41:14.080]  That was understandable.
[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:18.080]  But efforts to reach Daddy this year have been futile.
[2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:21.080]  The cell phone doesn't get through.
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:26.080]  The computer doesn't get through.
[2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:27.080]  So I don't know if he'll be there or not.
[2:41:27.080 --> 2:41:28.080]  I hope he is.
[2:41:28.080 --> 2:41:30.080]  Well, we can rest when we're dead.
[2:41:30.080 --> 2:41:32.080]  I hope he certainly comes to the event.
[2:41:32.080 --> 2:41:34.080]  Now, we've already seen a YouTube video
[2:41:34.080 --> 2:41:38.080]  and it matches the maps in Google Street View we've got,
[2:41:38.080 --> 2:41:40.080]  where people have driven up to this.
[2:41:40.080 --> 2:41:43.080]  This is off of Main Road and then a good 200 yards
[2:41:43.080 --> 2:41:46.080]  on the property down a forest path down hill.
[2:41:46.080 --> 2:41:49.080]  Very wooded, very hard to get to.
[2:41:49.080 --> 2:41:52.080]  We're trying to look at topography maps right now
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:57.080]  to see about long range lenses trying to shoot video over,
[2:41:57.080 --> 2:41:58.080]  but it doesn't look like it.
[2:41:58.080 --> 2:42:00.080]  I mean, this is going to be tough, but...
[2:42:00.080 --> 2:42:02.080]  Yes, it will.
[2:42:02.080 --> 2:42:04.080]  I was there once before.
[2:42:04.080 --> 2:42:08.080]  I'm trusting my memory now for the next few years.
[2:42:08.080 --> 2:42:12.080]  I recall down that narrow road, it was a public road,
[2:42:12.080 --> 2:42:14.080]  but it would not let you park.
[2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:17.080]  I think the parking was a permanent race,
[2:42:17.080 --> 2:42:18.080]  but not just a...
[2:42:18.080 --> 2:42:19.080]  Let me be clear.
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:23.080]  There's a main road that you can park on that is a public road,
[2:42:23.080 --> 2:42:27.080]  but then there's the final drive they're saying isn't.
[2:42:27.080 --> 2:42:29.080]  And it goes right up to the front of the, you know,
[2:42:29.080 --> 2:42:31.080]  classic style where it's got the cobblestones
[2:42:31.080 --> 2:42:34.080]  and it's like a two-story luxury hotel.
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:38.080]  So from what we see with the maps is that, yeah,
[2:42:38.080 --> 2:42:41.080]  they're going to try to not even let us park on a main road
[2:42:41.080 --> 2:42:43.080]  and then we can't walk in.
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:45.080]  Well, let me describe, you were there before
[2:42:45.080 --> 2:42:49.080]  at the Marriott Chantelli Ultra 5-Star Luxury Hotel,
[2:42:49.080 --> 2:42:50.080]  a golf course resort.
[2:42:50.080 --> 2:42:52.080]  Tell us what you were able to get, Jim,
[2:42:52.080 --> 2:42:54.080]  because I'm going to want you to drive around with us
[2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:58.080]  and help us ferret ways to get videos of these nasties.
[2:42:58.080 --> 2:43:01.080]  Well, trust me, my fading memory
[2:43:01.080 --> 2:43:04.080]  with the Ulrich of Alzheimer's,
[2:43:04.080 --> 2:43:10.080]  I do recall being at the hotel going inside.
[2:43:10.080 --> 2:43:13.080]  Of course, I was...
[2:43:13.080 --> 2:43:15.080]  I got there before they were starting to shut down,
[2:43:15.080 --> 2:43:17.080]  which is normal at that noon on Wednesday
[2:43:17.080 --> 2:43:19.080]  before the meeting begins,
[2:43:19.080 --> 2:43:21.080]  when the advance staff shows up with their bosses,
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:24.080]  big trucks and all the documents,
[2:43:24.080 --> 2:43:30.080]  they're going to be given and all that stuff.
[2:43:30.080 --> 2:43:36.080]  So it may have been Tuesday or Wednesday
[2:43:36.080 --> 2:43:38.080]  for logistic reasons.
[2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:40.080]  I can't get there until Wednesday this year.
[2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:42.080]  Normally, I'd be there on Tuesday.
[2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:43.080]  You know, I'm an idiot.
[2:43:43.080 --> 2:43:46.080]  I don't want to miss family, so I'm leaving on Wednesday.
[2:43:46.080 --> 2:43:47.080]  And that's it. Change the plane tickets.
[2:43:47.080 --> 2:43:48.080]  I want to leave Tuesday.
[2:43:48.080 --> 2:43:52.080]  Aaron, can you come in here real fast?
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:53.080]  Go ahead, Jim.
[2:43:53.080 --> 2:43:54.080]  Yeah, we need...
[2:43:54.080 --> 2:43:55.080]  That's what I was going to say.
[2:43:55.080 --> 2:43:58.080]  I was going to offer $1,000 to whoever I choose,
[2:43:58.080 --> 2:43:59.080]  because I need good video.
[2:43:59.080 --> 2:44:01.080]  Go check in.
[2:44:01.080 --> 2:44:03.080]  That means you only get about $700,
[2:44:03.080 --> 2:44:06.080]  because it's like $250.
[2:44:06.080 --> 2:44:08.080]  Go check in. Get video.
[2:44:08.080 --> 2:44:09.080]  Shoot the conference halls.
[2:44:09.080 --> 2:44:10.080]  It's got to be done now,
[2:44:10.080 --> 2:44:12.080]  because there's already government people there,
[2:44:12.080 --> 2:44:15.080]  according to video we've already gotten outside.
[2:44:15.080 --> 2:44:16.080]  We need to get inside.
[2:44:16.080 --> 2:44:18.080]  We need footage for a film,
[2:44:18.080 --> 2:44:20.080]  or to put it out for free on the web,
[2:44:20.080 --> 2:44:22.080]  or at PresidentPlanet.tv inside.
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:24.080]  And if I'd have known this,
[2:44:24.080 --> 2:44:26.080]  I would have gone to Canada early before,
[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:27.080]  but we learned so late.
[2:44:27.080 --> 2:44:29.080]  Let me just ask Aaron right now,
[2:44:29.080 --> 2:44:30.080]  because I'm so busy.
[2:44:30.080 --> 2:44:31.080]  Let's do this on Aaron.
[2:44:31.080 --> 2:44:35.080]  Aaron, can we move those plane tickets to Tuesday?
[2:44:35.080 --> 2:44:37.080]  I mean, let's find out right now.
[2:44:37.080 --> 2:44:40.080]  I don't want to just eat three, four, $500 tickets,
[2:44:40.080 --> 2:44:43.080]  but maybe we can change somebody's ticket
[2:44:43.080 --> 2:44:44.080]  and send somebody a few days early.
[2:44:44.080 --> 2:44:47.080]  Do you accept this mission?
[2:44:47.080 --> 2:44:49.080]  You're getting a big bonus, buddy.
[2:44:49.080 --> 2:44:50.080]  You've been up there working very hard
[2:44:50.080 --> 2:44:52.080]  up here until three last night.
[2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:55.080]  You haven't done well.
[2:44:55.080 --> 2:44:56.080]  Fire, yes, yes.
[2:44:56.080 --> 2:44:58.080]  Fire the investigation probe.
[2:44:58.080 --> 2:45:00.080]  Find out. We'll just send you early.
[2:45:00.080 --> 2:45:01.080]  Okay, let's go back.
[2:45:01.080 --> 2:45:02.080]  Jim Tucker?
[2:45:02.080 --> 2:45:04.080]  Yeah, it's important to get there early, isn't it?
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:06.080]  But you're saying you can't be there early.
[2:45:06.080 --> 2:45:11.080]  I'll be leaving Washington about this morning on Wednesday,
[2:45:11.080 --> 2:45:14.080]  and I hope I get things pinned down in time.
[2:45:14.080 --> 2:45:20.080]  And I'll be at the Bilderberg site early in the afternoon.
[2:45:20.080 --> 2:45:22.080]  Now, I'll be staying at a different,
[2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:24.080]  apparently more expensive hotel,
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:25.080]  at least for the first day or so,
[2:45:25.080 --> 2:45:28.080]  because I've already put it on our website.
[2:45:28.080 --> 2:45:30.080]  I'll be there so if anybody,
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:32.080]  if people have the right to chase me down there
[2:45:32.080 --> 2:45:34.080]  and the sources develop,
[2:45:34.080 --> 2:45:37.080]  they're likely to get through to me
[2:45:37.080 --> 2:45:40.080]  when they think where I'm supposed to be staying.
[2:45:40.080 --> 2:45:42.080]  It was the Westfields Marriott,
[2:45:42.080 --> 2:45:44.080]  and I was confirming that they were all booked up.
[2:45:44.080 --> 2:45:47.080]  They told me that the Closest Hotel
[2:45:47.080 --> 2:45:50.080]  was the Hilton in Herndon, Virginia,
[2:45:50.080 --> 2:45:51.080]  which I understand the views about,
[2:45:51.080 --> 2:45:53.080]  or somebody's about five miles away,
[2:45:53.080 --> 2:45:58.080]  and I think yours is going to be closer and cheaper, fortunately.
[2:45:58.080 --> 2:46:00.080]  Well, actually, we did find one place,
[2:46:00.080 --> 2:46:02.080]  but it doesn't have a room big enough to do interviews in
[2:46:02.080 --> 2:46:05.080]  at that extended stay,
[2:46:05.080 --> 2:46:07.080]  and it's only like 60 bucks cheaper.
[2:46:07.080 --> 2:46:10.080]  We're going ahead and staying at the Hilton with you, Bubba.
[2:46:10.080 --> 2:46:13.080]  Oh, and is the Hilton in Herndon?
[2:46:13.080 --> 2:46:15.080]  Yeah, what? You haven't moved, have you?
[2:46:15.080 --> 2:46:17.080]  Oh, no.
[2:46:17.080 --> 2:46:19.080]  I'll be checking into the Hilton in Herndon, Virginia.
[2:46:19.080 --> 2:46:21.080]  Besides, that's only about four miles away,
[2:46:21.080 --> 2:46:23.080]  actually, and the others are about two miles away.
[2:46:23.080 --> 2:46:25.080]  I mean, all the reporters are going to be there.
[2:46:25.080 --> 2:46:27.080]  Everybody is going to be there,
[2:46:27.080 --> 2:46:29.080]  and so I want to interview you and others,
[2:46:29.080 --> 2:46:31.080]  and the other hotel just doesn't.
[2:46:31.080 --> 2:46:33.080]  Well, frankly, it's for viewers of a film later,
[2:46:33.080 --> 2:46:36.080]  so it looks good in the background when we're in the common area
[2:46:36.080 --> 2:46:38.080]  or whatever when we interview you.
[2:46:38.080 --> 2:46:40.080]  So that's where all the happening is going to be.
[2:46:40.080 --> 2:46:42.080]  I want to put the call out for demonstrators to come out
[2:46:42.080 --> 2:46:44.080]  and for citizen media to come out,
[2:46:44.080 --> 2:46:46.080]  and when the cops walk over and say,
[2:46:46.080 --> 2:46:48.080]  leave, it's not a free country.
[2:46:48.080 --> 2:46:50.080]  You're not allowed to protest your owners.
[2:46:50.080 --> 2:46:52.080]  Just say, officer, I'm free press, and they'll say,
[2:46:52.080 --> 2:46:54.080]  who are you with? You can say, I'm with infowars.com,
[2:46:54.080 --> 2:46:56.080]  a freelance reporter,
[2:46:56.080 --> 2:46:58.080]  and I'm offering a thousand bucks,
[2:47:00.080 --> 2:47:02.080]  but I need a call at the office.
[2:47:02.080 --> 2:47:05.080]  We'll maybe put a hotline number up at the end of the show,
[2:47:05.080 --> 2:47:07.080]  I don't want to...
[2:47:07.080 --> 2:47:09.080]  I need to know now, in the next day,
[2:47:09.080 --> 2:47:11.080]  if a listener or group of listeners will check in,
[2:47:11.080 --> 2:47:13.080]  and then I'll end up, you know,
[2:47:13.080 --> 2:47:15.080]  if I get the video,
[2:47:15.080 --> 2:47:17.080]  because I'm sure two or three people will do it,
[2:47:17.080 --> 2:47:19.080]  but I need good video of the front of the place around it.
[2:47:19.080 --> 2:47:21.080]  You know, just check in like it's no big deal,
[2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:23.080]  and then go out and get the video, and just say you're a tourist,
[2:47:23.080 --> 2:47:25.080]  you're allowed to do that. Video of the boardrooms,
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:27.080]  video, you know,
[2:47:27.080 --> 2:47:29.080]  get good shots on a tripod,
[2:47:29.080 --> 2:47:31.080]  and I'll tell everybody, a thousand bucks
[2:47:31.080 --> 2:47:33.080]  plus your hotel room, and what is that?
[2:47:33.080 --> 2:47:35.080]  The fancy one's 300 bucks or something,
[2:47:35.080 --> 2:47:37.080]  but...
[2:47:37.080 --> 2:47:39.080]  270 plus tax.
[2:47:39.080 --> 2:47:41.080]  Okay, for the fancy one or for the Hilton?
[2:47:41.080 --> 2:47:43.080]  How much for the Marriott?
[2:47:43.080 --> 2:47:45.080]  Oh,
[2:47:45.080 --> 2:47:47.080]  the Westfields Marriott
[2:47:47.080 --> 2:47:49.080]  is a lot more...
[2:47:49.080 --> 2:47:51.080]  300 to 600 at night,
[2:47:51.080 --> 2:47:53.080]  but the one worst thing in Hilton
[2:47:53.080 --> 2:47:55.080]  in terms of this $270...
[2:47:55.080 --> 2:47:57.080]  But there is a restaurant, our listeners could go there
[2:47:57.080 --> 2:47:59.080]  and say they're dining.
[2:47:59.080 --> 2:48:01.080]  Well, I always check that out.
[2:48:01.080 --> 2:48:03.080]  They have a restaurant, they have a cocktail lounge.
[2:48:03.080 --> 2:48:05.080]  Okay, so you can pull in,
[2:48:05.080 --> 2:48:07.080]  say you're going to the cocktail lounge,
[2:48:07.080 --> 2:48:09.080]  get your courage up by drinking a few martinis.
[2:48:09.080 --> 2:48:11.080]  I'm joking, listeners.
[2:48:11.080 --> 2:48:13.080]  And then, oh, the days.
[2:48:13.080 --> 2:48:15.080]  And then,
[2:48:15.080 --> 2:48:17.080]  the days are not having a headache. I'm glad I quit ringing.
[2:48:17.080 --> 2:48:19.080]  But no, I'm serious.
[2:48:19.080 --> 2:48:21.080]  It'll be hard not to be drinking, Jim, with you,
[2:48:21.080 --> 2:48:23.080]  if you're drinking a beer at night, a toddy.
[2:48:23.080 --> 2:48:25.080]  Well, now,
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:27.080]  we're talking about the Hilton in terms of...
[2:48:27.080 --> 2:48:29.080]  not the Westfields Marriott,
[2:48:29.080 --> 2:48:31.080]  the Seasons Grab.
[2:48:31.080 --> 2:48:33.080]  No, no, I'm saying we need to
[2:48:33.080 --> 2:48:35.080]  send listeners now to get video
[2:48:35.080 --> 2:48:37.080]  at the Marriott
[2:48:37.080 --> 2:48:39.080]  beforehand, and they can go
[2:48:39.080 --> 2:48:41.080]  into the bar and not have to pay
[2:48:41.080 --> 2:48:43.080]  or the restaurant and say they're there for that
[2:48:43.080 --> 2:48:45.080]  and get us video
[2:48:45.080 --> 2:48:47.080]  so I can put something out on the web,
[2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:49.080]  because we're going to get there and it's going to be locked down.
[2:48:49.080 --> 2:48:51.080]  And for some reason, I thought...
[2:48:51.080 --> 2:48:53.080]  I thought it was starting Friday,
[2:48:53.080 --> 2:48:55.080]  so I thought I could fly in Wednesday and get video.
[2:48:55.080 --> 2:48:57.080]  You're saying now they're going to lock it down Wednesday.
[2:48:57.080 --> 2:48:59.080]  Well, traditionally,
[2:48:59.080 --> 2:49:01.080]  they start putting up the
[2:49:01.080 --> 2:49:03.080]  salt horses
[2:49:03.080 --> 2:49:05.080]  and deploying the guards
[2:49:05.080 --> 2:49:07.080]  about noon on a Wednesday.
[2:49:07.080 --> 2:49:09.080]  Now, that's not 100%.
[2:49:09.080 --> 2:49:11.080]  One time, I was surprised
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:13.080]  to be allowed to roll in on Wednesday,
[2:49:13.080 --> 2:49:15.080]  but later in the afternoon, they said
[2:49:15.080 --> 2:49:17.080]  we've got to clear the hotel out now, private meeting.
[2:49:17.080 --> 2:49:19.080]  Yeah, there's no doubt they're listening to us right now.
[2:49:19.080 --> 2:49:21.080]  Point is, listeners, get in there now,
[2:49:21.080 --> 2:49:23.080]  check in there now,
[2:49:23.080 --> 2:49:25.080]  and I will pay you for your trouble
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:27.080]  if I use it. If you send me some shaky video
[2:49:27.080 --> 2:49:29.080]  I can't use, I won't do it.
[2:49:29.080 --> 2:49:31.080]  And I'm a pretty nice guy.
[2:49:31.080 --> 2:49:33.080]  Even if I get sent two or three videos,
[2:49:33.080 --> 2:49:35.080]  I'll end up compensating those,
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:37.080]  even though it's not the video I'm going to pay a thousand bucks for.
[2:49:37.080 --> 2:49:39.080]  I'm not made out of money here.
[2:49:39.080 --> 2:49:41.080]  I had to pay for a lot of the footage I'm using
[2:49:41.080 --> 2:49:43.080]  in this new film, but it's important.
[2:49:43.080 --> 2:49:45.080]  I need that footage inside.
[2:49:45.080 --> 2:49:47.080]  I don't want to have to make another trip back to Virginia
[2:49:47.080 --> 2:49:49.080]  just to get it when they're not there.
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:51.080]  It's an oversight of mine.
[2:49:51.080 --> 2:49:53.080]  Jim, that's a good idea to send listeners in, isn't it?
[2:49:53.080 --> 2:49:55.080]  Oh, yes.
[2:49:55.080 --> 2:49:57.080]  By all means, the more people
[2:49:57.080 --> 2:49:59.080]  we have outside the gates,
[2:49:59.080 --> 2:50:01.080]  the more they're diverted.
[2:50:01.080 --> 2:50:03.080]  I'm tempted to try to stay until
[2:50:03.080 --> 2:50:05.080]  Monday,
[2:50:05.080 --> 2:50:07.080]  to try to dig through their trash.
[2:50:07.080 --> 2:50:09.080]  But aren't they even careful about their trash?
[2:50:09.080 --> 2:50:11.080]  Yes.
[2:50:13.080 --> 2:50:15.080]  Years ago,
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:17.080]  the
[2:50:17.080 --> 2:50:19.080]  sources on the
[2:50:19.080 --> 2:50:21.080]  behalf of the Bilderberg Resort
[2:50:21.080 --> 2:50:23.080]  could pick up
[2:50:23.080 --> 2:50:25.080]  pieces of paper that would be interesting
[2:50:25.080 --> 2:50:27.080]  instead of throwing trash cans in their pocket
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:29.080]  and give it to me later.
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:31.080]  But now there's a discipline
[2:50:31.080 --> 2:50:33.080]  to...
[2:50:33.080 --> 2:50:35.080]  nothing.
[2:50:35.080 --> 2:50:37.080]  No piece of paper anywhere.
[2:50:37.080 --> 2:50:39.080]  And if they accidentally do,
[2:50:39.080 --> 2:50:41.080]  the staff is disciplined to
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:43.080]  put it in a trash can.
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:45.080]  Jim, stay there. I want to hear about this on the other side.
[2:50:45.080 --> 2:50:47.080]  Final seven, Jim, Dr. Straight ahead.
[2:50:47.080 --> 2:50:49.080]  The Federal Trade Commission
[2:50:49.080 --> 2:50:51.080]  estimates that 9 million Americans
[2:50:51.080 --> 2:50:53.080]  are victims of identity theft each year.
[2:50:53.080 --> 2:50:55.080]  The crime of identity theft occurs every
[2:50:55.080 --> 2:50:57.080]  3.5 seconds, costing the victims
[2:50:57.080 --> 2:50:59.080]  an average of $8,000.
[2:50:59.080 --> 2:51:01.080]  If you own a PC, passwords are a common
[2:51:01.080 --> 2:51:03.080]  form of authentication, and often the only
[2:51:03.080 --> 2:51:05.080]  protection between a hacker and your personal
[2:51:05.080 --> 2:51:07.080]  information. Passwords that are stored
[2:51:07.080 --> 2:51:09.080]  in a spreadsheet, text file, data
[2:51:09.080 --> 2:51:11.080]  file, or any other file that is not encrypted
[2:51:11.080 --> 2:51:13.080]  and password protected are vulnerable
[2:51:13.080 --> 2:51:15.080]  to malicious theft and misuse.

[2:51:47.080 --> 2:51:49.080]  It is a big idea.
[2:51:49.080 --> 2:51:51.080]  A new world order.
[2:51:51.080 --> 2:51:53.080]  In the near future,
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:55.080]  Earth is dominated by a powerful
[2:51:55.080 --> 2:51:57.080]  world government.
[2:51:57.080 --> 2:51:59.080]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[2:51:59.080 --> 2:52:01.080]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:52:01.080 --> 2:52:03.080]  For thousands of years,
[2:52:03.080 --> 2:52:05.080]  their dark order grew.
[2:52:05.080 --> 2:52:07.080]  Now as they hail the birth
[2:52:07.080 --> 2:52:09.080]  of the new world order, their great
[2:52:09.080 --> 2:52:11.080]  dream of exterminating
[2:52:11.080 --> 2:52:13.080]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[2:52:13.080 --> 2:52:15.080]  For the first time in history,
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:17.080]  the elite's plan for world
[2:52:17.080 --> 2:52:19.080]  government is blown wide open.
[2:52:19.080 --> 2:52:21.080]  You will learn the secret that drives
[2:52:21.080 --> 2:52:23.080]  the entire new world order agenda.
[2:52:23.080 --> 2:52:25.080]  Bilderberg is making great progress
[2:52:25.080 --> 2:52:27.080]  toward a world government.
[2:52:27.080 --> 2:52:29.080]  Most people have no idea.
[2:52:29.080 --> 2:52:31.080]  They're not after money. They have
[2:52:31.080 --> 2:52:33.080]  all the money they need. They're after power.
[2:52:33.080 --> 2:52:35.080]  That's their aptitude. Order in-game

[2:52:45.080 --> 2:52:47.080]  enslaved. You have been warned.
[2:52:47.080 --> 2:52:49.080]  Have you ever thought about what's
[2:52:49.080 --> 2:52:51.080]  in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[2:52:51.080 --> 2:52:53.080]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol,
[2:52:53.080 --> 2:52:55.080]  sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes
[2:52:55.080 --> 2:52:57.080]  and more? Even fragrance can
[2:52:57.080 --> 2:52:59.080]  indicate the presence of some 4,000
[2:52:59.080 --> 2:53:01.080]  separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[2:53:01.080 --> 2:53:03.080]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[2:53:03.080 --> 2:53:05.080]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be
[2:53:05.080 --> 2:53:07.080]  inhaling these additives that can lead to
[2:53:07.080 --> 2:53:09.080]  coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath,
[2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:11.080]  headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:13.080]  and mucous membranes. Now
[2:53:13.080 --> 2:53:15.080]  compare Calben Pure Soap. All natural,

[2:54:09.080 --> 2:54:11.080]  Alright, final segment with Jim Tucker.
[2:54:11.080 --> 2:54:13.080]  It was back from smoking a cigarette
[2:54:13.080 --> 2:54:15.080]  during the break. Jim, you there?
[2:54:15.080 --> 2:54:17.080]  Yep. How was
[2:54:17.080 --> 2:54:19.080]  that delicious non-filtered
[2:54:19.080 --> 2:54:21.080]  a cigarette?
[2:54:21.080 --> 2:54:23.080]  It's a good clean fund.
[2:54:23.080 --> 2:54:25.080]  Hey, what kind of non-filters are those?
[2:54:25.080 --> 2:54:27.080]  It's the generic?
[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:29.080]  Yeah, they look like
[2:54:29.080 --> 2:54:31.080]  pillmills used to look,
[2:54:31.080 --> 2:54:33.080]  which is a long-lucky strike.
[2:54:33.080 --> 2:54:35.080]  In Virginia, we buy them
[2:54:35.080 --> 2:54:37.080]  for a dollar
[2:54:37.080 --> 2:54:39.080]  so this is the packer
[2:54:39.080 --> 2:54:41.080]  of the
[2:54:41.080 --> 2:54:43.080]  carton.
[2:54:43.080 --> 2:54:45.080]  I've been a smoker off and on
[2:54:45.080 --> 2:54:47.080]  and I borrowed one of your cigarettes, bummed one,
[2:54:47.080 --> 2:54:49.080]  and you are one tough son of a gun.
[2:54:49.080 --> 2:54:51.080]  That is the roughest
[2:54:51.080 --> 2:54:53.080]  filterless, and I've smoked filterless
[2:54:53.080 --> 2:54:55.080]  camels before years ago. Those are
[2:54:55.080 --> 2:54:57.080]  some tough cigarettes, buddy boy.
[2:54:57.080 --> 2:54:59.080]  Well, when I was a kid,
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:01.080]  the cigarettes did not
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:03.080]  have tampon tips on them.
[2:55:03.080 --> 2:55:05.080]  They just had quartips on some of them.
[2:55:05.080 --> 2:55:07.080]  Oh my God.
[2:55:07.080 --> 2:55:09.080]  It just wasn't there
[2:55:09.080 --> 2:55:11.080]  when I got used to it.
[2:55:11.080 --> 2:55:13.080]  Jim Tucker, what a character.
[2:55:13.080 --> 2:55:15.080]  30-plus years covering Bilderberg.
[2:55:15.080 --> 2:55:17.080]  This is convenient for you
[2:55:17.080 --> 2:55:19.080]  because you live in Virginia.
[2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:21.080]  I guess the Bilderberg boys love you.
[2:55:21.080 --> 2:55:23.080]  Well, my home is
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:25.080]  about 70 miles
[2:55:25.080 --> 2:55:27.080]  down in Central Virginia.
[2:55:27.080 --> 2:55:29.080]  But this is closer than Istanbul.
[2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:31.080]  Well, definitely.
[2:55:31.080 --> 2:55:33.080]  It actually applies not much
[2:55:33.080 --> 2:55:35.080]  about anywhere. At first I was
[2:55:35.080 --> 2:55:37.080]  discussed as either Bilderberg
[2:55:37.080 --> 2:55:39.080]  or Commission would take me to Europe this year
[2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:41.080]  like they're supposed to.
[2:55:41.080 --> 2:55:43.080]  But then I started thinking about the hassle
[2:55:43.080 --> 2:55:45.080]  of flying last year,
[2:55:45.080 --> 2:55:47.080]  and I was kind of glad not to have to fly
[2:55:47.080 --> 2:55:49.080]  back to Europe.
[2:55:49.080 --> 2:55:51.080]  They give you proctology exams
[2:55:51.080 --> 2:55:53.080]  now at the airport.
[2:55:53.080 --> 2:55:55.080]  Well, one tip on traveling
[2:55:55.080 --> 2:55:57.080]  these days to avoid
[2:55:57.080 --> 2:55:59.080]  being signaled out in profile
[2:55:59.080 --> 2:56:01.080]  or whatever they call it, is to
[2:56:01.080 --> 2:56:03.080]  do not take a bath for two weeks.
[2:56:03.080 --> 2:56:05.080]  Wear a dirty T-shirt
[2:56:05.080 --> 2:56:07.080]  and don't walk your shoes
[2:56:07.080 --> 2:56:09.080]  and mess up your hair.
[2:56:09.080 --> 2:56:11.080]  Then you'll breathe right through.
[2:56:11.080 --> 2:56:13.080]  By the way, folks, this is the real Jim Tucker.
[2:56:13.080 --> 2:56:15.080]  I'm always serious with him. He's starting joking around.
[2:56:15.080 --> 2:56:17.080]  He's really a character. Jim, I look forward to hanging out with you.
[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:19.080]  You're going to be able to give me an hour or so
[2:56:19.080 --> 2:56:21.080]  to do an interview in the hotel room, right?
[2:56:21.080 --> 2:56:23.080]  Yeah, we'll work out.
[2:56:23.080 --> 2:56:25.080]  We have the time already in mind.
[2:56:25.080 --> 2:56:27.080]  Well, we'll do it whenever, hey,
[2:56:27.080 --> 2:56:29.080]  we'll do it whenever you want
[2:56:29.080 --> 2:56:31.080]  after we film them coming in
[2:56:31.080 --> 2:56:33.080]  or after you've followed stories.
[2:56:33.080 --> 2:56:35.080]  We'll be happy to show fur you about.
[2:56:35.080 --> 2:56:37.080]  I would like to get you trying to go up
[2:56:37.080 --> 2:56:39.080]  and enter the ritual like you always do.
[2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:41.080]  The ritual is trying to get in.
[2:56:41.080 --> 2:56:43.080]  I know a lot of other folks
[2:56:43.080 --> 2:56:45.080]  will be happy to do it too, but
[2:56:45.080 --> 2:56:47.080]  if you'd like us to ferry you about,
[2:56:47.080 --> 2:56:49.080]  we'll be at the same hotel with you, okay?
[2:56:49.080 --> 2:56:51.080]  Oh, very good.
[2:56:51.080 --> 2:56:53.080]  Yeah, we love you, Jim.
[2:56:53.080 --> 2:56:55.080]  It's always fun to get the chance to hang out
[2:56:55.080 --> 2:56:57.080]  with a real Americana and you are it.
[2:56:57.080 --> 2:56:59.080]  You are certainly
[2:56:59.080 --> 2:57:01.080]  last to the Mohicans when it comes to
[2:57:01.080 --> 2:57:03.080]  good gumshoe reporters.
[2:57:03.080 --> 2:57:05.080]  Jim, so it's hard
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:07.080]  to get documents because they now
[2:57:07.080 --> 2:57:09.080]  we've stolen so many of them
[2:57:09.080 --> 2:57:11.080]  out of their meetings that they're really trying
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:13.080]  to keep lock and key on those.
[2:57:13.080 --> 2:57:15.080]  Yes, but the new age
[2:57:15.080 --> 2:57:17.080]  of the internet
[2:57:17.080 --> 2:57:19.080]  has created something that's been
[2:57:19.080 --> 2:57:21.080]  quite positive over the last,
[2:57:21.080 --> 2:57:23.080]  I say it's about four years
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:25.080]  before you had to get there early
[2:57:25.080 --> 2:57:27.080]  and develop sources within.
[2:57:27.080 --> 2:57:29.080]  It took a long time to win their confidence.
[2:57:29.080 --> 2:57:31.080]  It took me about it
[2:57:31.080 --> 2:57:33.080]  and fortunately
[2:57:33.080 --> 2:57:35.080]  one or two had stepped forward
[2:57:35.080 --> 2:57:37.080]  after you've worked it over
[2:57:37.080 --> 2:57:39.080]  about 24 hours in a very low-key reassuring way.
[2:57:39.080 --> 2:57:41.080]  Don't tell me your name that way
[2:57:41.080 --> 2:57:43.080]  if they could be on the rack.
[2:57:43.080 --> 2:57:45.080]  I can't name you.
[2:57:45.080 --> 2:57:47.080]  But with internet,
[2:57:47.080 --> 2:57:49.080]  I'm hearing sources
[2:57:49.080 --> 2:57:51.080]  coming forward from the
[2:57:51.080 --> 2:57:53.080]  upper management level of these
[2:57:53.080 --> 2:57:55.080]  places and
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:57:57.080]  well, of course, they don't have to go
[2:57:57.080 --> 2:57:59.080]  out. They've known for months or a year
[2:57:59.080 --> 2:58:01.080]  the place won't be sealed off
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:03.080]  for some very important meetings
[2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:05.080]  of very important people. Oh, Jim, I got to hold you
[2:58:05.080 --> 2:58:07.080]  one minute over to ask you a question.
[2:58:07.080 --> 2:58:09.080]  Did you see the Washington Post
[2:58:09.080 --> 2:58:11.080]  at Mint Bilderberg Group?
[2:58:11.080 --> 2:58:13.080]  No, I read the Post every day.
[2:58:13.080 --> 2:58:15.080]  Okay, let me dig it out.
[2:58:15.080 --> 2:58:17.080]  It's here in the stack somewhere.
[2:58:17.080 --> 2:58:19.080]  Oh, no, it's in my yesterday's stack.
[2:58:19.080 --> 2:58:21.080]  I'll try to find it. The headlines, they rule.
[2:58:21.080 --> 2:58:23.080]  Stay there. Stay there, Jim. Back in
[2:58:23.080 --> 2:58:25.080]  70 seconds and you have no time to smoke a cigarette.
[2:58:25.080 --> 2:58:27.080]  We'll be right back.
[2:58:29.080 --> 2:58:31.080]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:58:31.080 --> 2:58:33.080]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com
[2:58:33.080 --> 2:59:01.080]  today.
[2:59:01.080 --> 2:59:03.080]  We'll be right back.
[2:59:39.080 --> 2:59:41.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:59:41.080 --> 2:59:43.080]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:59:55.080 --> 2:59:57.080]  Yeah, the article was
[2:59:57.080 --> 2:59:59.080]  written by Ann Marie
[2:59:59.080 --> 3:00:01.080]  Slaughter, top globalist
[3:00:01.080 --> 3:00:03.080]  Gopher.
[3:00:03.080 --> 3:00:05.080]  She's in the Gopher class.
[3:00:05.080 --> 3:00:07.080]  They rule the world. The shadowy organization
[3:00:07.080 --> 3:00:09.080]  is in power and it's made up of very, very rich.
[3:00:09.080 --> 3:00:11.080]  And this is the Washington Post.
[3:00:11.080 --> 3:00:13.080]  Sunday, May 25th,
[3:00:13.080 --> 3:00:15.080]  2008. Page BWO2.
[3:00:15.080 --> 3:00:17.080]  Let me give it to you again, Jim Tucker.
[3:00:17.080 --> 3:00:19.080]  Sunday, May 25th,
[3:00:19.080 --> 3:00:21.080]  2008.
[3:00:21.080 --> 3:00:23.080]  Page BWO2.
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:25.080]  So to be tactical,
[3:00:25.080 --> 3:00:29.080]  it was on the second page of one of the sections.
[3:00:29.080 --> 3:00:31.080]  And if you scroll down,
[3:00:31.080 --> 3:00:33.080]  they just admit how there's a ruling elite
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:35.080]  of a few thousand people that run everything
[3:00:35.080 --> 3:00:37.080]  and they have the head of the Kissinger Group
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:39.080]  who I interviewed a few weeks ago, admitted it here on air.
[3:00:39.080 --> 3:00:41.080]  And then in the
[3:00:41.080 --> 3:00:43.080]  third to the last paragraph,
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:45.080]  it says, still, super class
[3:00:45.080 --> 3:00:47.080]  is often thought-provoking.
[3:00:47.080 --> 3:00:49.080]  For one thing, it is a much about who is not
[3:00:49.080 --> 3:00:51.080]  part of the super class and who is.
[3:00:51.080 --> 3:00:53.080]  As I read Rothkopf's Chronicles
[3:00:53.080 --> 3:00:55.080]  of the Elite Gatherings, Davos,
[3:00:55.080 --> 3:00:57.080]  Bilderberg, the Bohemian Rove,
[3:00:57.080 --> 3:00:59.080]  Old Mail, Fathers and Sons,
[3:00:59.080 --> 3:01:01.080]  I was speedily struck by the near absence of women.
[3:01:01.080 --> 3:01:03.080]  And then it just goes on.
[3:01:03.080 --> 3:01:05.080]  But then the New York Times
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:07.080]  did a Rothkopf article
[3:01:07.080 --> 3:01:09.080]  and so did the Wall Street Journal
[3:01:09.080 --> 3:01:11.080]  admitting more about Bilderberg.
[3:01:11.080 --> 3:01:13.080]  I mean, ten years ago, Jim, they said we were nuts.
[3:01:13.080 --> 3:01:15.080]  It didn't exist eight years ago.
[3:01:15.080 --> 3:01:17.080]  The New York Times said it didn't exist. I was insane.
[3:01:17.080 --> 3:01:19.080]  Now,
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:21.080]  I think this is the first time
[3:01:21.080 --> 3:01:23.080]  because we went to the UT stacks
[3:01:23.080 --> 3:01:25.080]  and couldn't find a Washington Post.
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:27.080]  We did find a few other U.S.
[3:01:27.080 --> 3:01:29.080]  papers that had it decades ago, but just to mention,
[3:01:29.080 --> 3:01:31.080]  very weird,
[3:01:31.080 --> 3:01:33.080]  because I was going to go protest, and I still may,
[3:01:33.080 --> 3:01:35.080]  in front of
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:37.080]  and make phone calls and things while we're there as part of a film,
[3:01:37.080 --> 3:01:39.080]  to the Washington Post
[3:01:39.080 --> 3:01:41.080]  and say, why aren't you covering this
[3:01:41.080 --> 3:01:43.080]  when you attend every meeting? Jim Tucker.
[3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:45.080]  That sounds like
[3:01:45.080 --> 3:01:47.080]  good fun. Now,
[3:01:47.080 --> 3:01:49.080]  these stories in the Wall Street Journal
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:51.080]  are
[3:01:51.080 --> 3:01:53.080]  New York Times, were they also recent stories?
[3:01:53.080 --> 3:01:55.080]  Yeah, you can Lexus and Exus
[3:01:55.080 --> 3:01:57.080]  said it was in the last month.
[3:01:57.080 --> 3:01:59.080]  Jim, if you want me to find
[3:01:59.080 --> 3:02:01.080]  that I know you're not big on the Internet,
[3:02:01.080 --> 3:02:03.080]  I can have it sent to you.
[3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:05.080]  Well,
[3:02:05.080 --> 3:02:07.080]  at the press building on Monday
[3:02:07.080 --> 3:02:09.080]  morning, they have a library thing where I go and say,
[3:02:09.080 --> 3:02:11.080]  anything,
[3:02:11.080 --> 3:02:13.080]  well, it is to reuse the word Bilderberg
[3:02:13.080 --> 3:02:15.080]  and I spill it out for them
[3:02:15.080 --> 3:02:17.080]  within the last
[3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:19.080]  month.
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:21.080]  Well, New York Times,
[3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:23.080]  Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post
[3:02:23.080 --> 3:02:25.080]  the last month.
[3:02:25.080 --> 3:02:27.080]  But none of them had anything substantial, right?
[3:02:27.080 --> 3:02:29.080]  No, no, they just mentioned,
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:31.080]  this is the group and they run your life, and if you don't like it,
[3:02:31.080 --> 3:02:33.080]  they'll send a brain washed steroid head
[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:35.080]  with a machine gun to shove it down your throat
[3:02:35.080 --> 3:02:37.080]  and blow your brains out, basically.
[3:02:37.080 --> 3:02:39.080]  Okay, I'll check those things out
[3:02:39.080 --> 3:02:41.080]  Monday morning.
[3:02:41.080 --> 3:02:43.080]  Well, look forward to seeing you
[3:02:43.080 --> 3:02:45.080]  following Wednesday.
[3:02:45.080 --> 3:02:47.080]  Well, I hope to leave
[3:02:47.080 --> 3:02:49.080]  Capitol Hill no later than 11am
[3:02:49.080 --> 3:02:51.080]  and
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:53.080]  it's about
[3:02:53.080 --> 3:02:55.080]  a one hour drive
[3:02:55.080 --> 3:02:57.080]  and of course, I'll first check into the
[3:02:57.080 --> 3:02:59.080]  hotel before
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:01.080]  going over to see the crime
[3:03:01.080 --> 3:03:03.080]  because we don't know how long we'll be there
[3:03:03.080 --> 3:03:05.080]  and I'm going to get the pair of socks put away first.
[3:03:05.080 --> 3:03:07.080]  I wonder if in the good old USA
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:09.080]  I'll be allowed to fly or whether I'll be
[3:03:09.080 --> 3:03:11.080]  arrested like I was in Canada.
[3:03:11.080 --> 3:03:13.080]  Well,
[3:03:13.080 --> 3:03:15.080]  maybe if you
[3:03:15.080 --> 3:03:17.080]  wear a dirty short to a dirty T-shirt
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:19.080]  and mess up your hair and don't take a bath,
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:21.080]  you might not have any problem.
[3:03:21.080 --> 3:03:23.080]  Maybe I'll wear a big diaper.
[3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:25.080]  I think it's a change.
[3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:27.080]  Hey, listen, Jim Tucker, AmericanFreePress.net,
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:29.080]  what's your, are you going to have any new articles
[3:03:29.080 --> 3:03:31.080]  before next week?
[3:03:31.080 --> 3:03:33.080]  Yeah, I'll have
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:35.080]  something build up very good this next week
[3:03:35.080 --> 3:03:37.080]  about
[3:03:37.080 --> 3:03:39.080]  their agenda is going to be,
[3:03:39.080 --> 3:03:41.080]  but I don't know why it is yet.
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:43.080]  Well, we all have an idea from the Tri-Lateral
[3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:45.080]  Commission Report because we have a common agenda.
[3:03:45.080 --> 3:03:47.080]  Well, you're absolutely
[3:03:47.080 --> 3:03:49.080]  kicking butt and we love you to death
[3:03:49.080 --> 3:03:51.080]  and we appreciate everything and I'm glad
[3:03:51.080 --> 3:03:53.080]  that the foreign media
[3:03:53.080 --> 3:03:55.080]  was wrong and that their ruse failed
[3:03:55.080 --> 3:03:57.080]  and the Bilderberg Group has not gotten
[3:03:57.080 --> 3:03:59.080]  away with their disinfo campaign.
[3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:01.080]  Good fun.
[3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:03.080]  Jim Tucker, thank you so much for joining us.
[3:04:03.080 --> 3:04:05.080]  You're most welcome. Bye. There he goes.
[3:04:05.080 --> 3:04:07.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Tucker,
[3:04:07.080 --> 3:04:09.080]  a true character. That guy is
[3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:11.080]  a piece of work. Got to be around him in person.
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:13.080]  That's all I'm going to say.
[3:04:13.080 --> 3:04:15.080]  I want to see everybody
[3:04:15.080 --> 3:04:17.080]  out there.
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:19.080]  I want to see everybody out there in Chantilly.
[3:04:19.080 --> 3:04:21.080]  There's lots of places to stay.
[3:04:21.080 --> 3:04:23.080]  You can stay 20 miles away if you want in a $100 room.
[3:04:23.080 --> 3:04:25.080]  I mean, that's cheap. A Best Western
[3:04:25.080 --> 3:04:27.080]  is like a hundred smackers
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:29.080]  with roaches the size
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:31.080]  of alley cats, but
[3:04:31.080 --> 3:04:33.080]  I hope to see everybody
[3:04:33.080 --> 3:04:35.080]  out there. We need lots of people,
[3:04:35.080 --> 3:04:37.080]  lots of roving teams
[3:04:37.080 --> 3:04:39.080]  trying to get video, lots of people
[3:04:39.080 --> 3:04:41.080]  investigating, lots of
[3:04:41.080 --> 3:04:43.080]  decoys. Yes, I need you to meet
[3:04:43.080 --> 3:04:45.080]  decoys. We'll be right back.
[3:04:45.080 --> 3:04:47.080]  It is a big idea.
[3:04:47.080 --> 3:04:49.080]  A new world order.
[3:04:49.080 --> 3:04:51.080]  In the near future,
[3:04:51.080 --> 3:04:53.080]  Earth is dominated
[3:04:53.080 --> 3:04:55.080]  by a powerful world government.
[3:04:55.080 --> 3:04:57.080]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[3:04:57.080 --> 3:04:59.080]  What their objective
[3:04:59.080 --> 3:05:01.080]  being world domination?
[3:05:01.080 --> 3:05:03.080]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:05:03.080 --> 3:05:05.080]  Now as they hail the
[3:05:05.080 --> 3:05:07.080]  birth of the new world order,
[3:05:07.080 --> 3:05:09.080]  their great dream of exterminating
[3:05:09.080 --> 3:05:11.080]  80% of humanity is at
[3:05:11.080 --> 3:05:13.080]  hand.
[3:05:13.080 --> 3:05:15.080]  For the first time
[3:05:15.080 --> 3:05:17.080]  in history, the elite's plan
[3:05:17.080 --> 3:05:19.080]  for world government is blown wide
[3:05:19.080 --> 3:05:21.080]  open. You will learn the secret that
[3:05:21.080 --> 3:05:23.080]  drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:05:23.080 --> 3:05:25.080]  Bilderberg is making great progress
[3:05:25.080 --> 3:05:27.080]  for the world government. Most people have no idea.
[3:05:27.080 --> 3:05:29.080]  They're not after money. They have all the money
[3:05:29.080 --> 3:05:31.080]  they need. They're after power.

[3:05:41.080 --> 3:05:43.080]  for global enslavement.
[3:05:43.080 --> 3:05:45.080]  You have been warned.
[3:05:45.080 --> 3:05:47.080]  More than 700 chemicals
[3:05:47.080 --> 3:05:49.080]  have been found in our drinking water.
[3:05:49.080 --> 3:05:51.080]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these
[3:05:51.080 --> 3:05:53.080]  chemicals while taking hot showers
[3:05:53.080 --> 3:05:55.080]  than when drinking the water? That's because
[3:05:55.080 --> 3:05:57.080]  many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate
[3:05:57.080 --> 3:05:59.080]  and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:05:59.080 --> 3:06:01.080]  The KDF dual-media
[3:06:01.080 --> 3:06:03.080]  shower filter works with both hot and cold water
[3:06:03.080 --> 3:06:05.080]  and is designed to reduce chlorine,
[3:06:05.080 --> 3:06:07.080]  lead, mercury, and iron.
[3:06:07.080 --> 3:06:09.080]  And it inhibits the growth of bacteria,
[3:06:09.080 --> 3:06:11.080]  mold, algae, and fungus.
[3:06:11.080 --> 3:06:13.080]  The KDF dual-media shower filter
[3:06:13.080 --> 3:06:15.080]  typically lasts 10,000 gallons or
[3:06:15.080 --> 3:06:17.080]  one year, whichever comes first.
[3:06:17.080 --> 3:06:19.080]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities
[3:06:19.080 --> 3:06:21.080]  use this media to reduce chlorine, iron,
[3:06:21.080 --> 3:06:23.080]  heavy metals, and bacteria.

[3:08:14.080 --> 3:08:16.080]  I really appreciate Chuck Carlson
[3:08:16.080 --> 3:08:18.080]  for coming on the show with us today.
[3:08:18.080 --> 3:08:20.080]  He writes for a lot of big publications
[3:08:20.080 --> 3:08:22.080]  and I thought I'd give you a positive view
[3:08:22.080 --> 3:08:24.080]  on the economy.
[3:08:24.080 --> 3:08:26.080]  We've had a lot of negative views
[3:08:26.080 --> 3:08:28.080]  and guests with the economy.
[3:08:28.080 --> 3:08:30.080]  He also looks at foreign stocks
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:32.080]  and no-load funds and things like that.
[3:08:32.080 --> 3:08:34.080]  I thought we'd get, because he's a respected
[3:08:34.080 --> 3:08:36.080]  analyst and guy that breaks all this
[3:08:36.080 --> 3:08:38.080]  type stuff down.
[3:08:38.080 --> 3:08:40.080]  You can go to his website
[3:08:40.080 --> 3:08:42.080]  drinvestor.com
[3:08:42.080 --> 3:08:44.080]  drinvestor.com
[3:08:44.080 --> 3:08:46.080]  we have a link to it up on
[3:08:46.080 --> 3:08:48.080]  infowars.com
[3:08:48.080 --> 3:08:50.080]  Chuck, where do you see our economy going?
[3:08:50.080 --> 3:08:52.080]  First off, tell us a little bit about yourself
[3:08:52.080 --> 3:08:54.080]  and then where you think the economy
[3:08:54.080 --> 3:08:56.080]  is going to be bullish.
[3:08:56.080 --> 3:08:58.080]  Sure. Our firm
[3:08:58.080 --> 3:09:00.080]  Horizon Publishing publishes investment
[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:02.080]  newsletters. Our flagship publication
[3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:04.080]  is a newsletter called Dout Theory
[3:09:04.080 --> 3:09:06.080]  Forecast, which has been published
[3:09:06.080 --> 3:09:08.080]  continuously since 1946.
[3:09:08.080 --> 3:09:10.080]  It's also published in newsletters.
[3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:12.080]  As you mentioned, the drip investor,
[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:14.080]  which focuses on those stocks
[3:09:14.080 --> 3:09:16.080]  that allow any investor to buy shares
[3:09:16.080 --> 3:09:18.080]  directly from the company, the first share
[3:09:18.080 --> 3:09:20.080]  and every share share.
[3:09:20.080 --> 3:09:22.080]  We don't even need a stockbroker to buy the stock
[3:09:22.080 --> 3:09:24.080]  directly from them.
[3:09:24.080 --> 3:09:26.080]  We also manage money.
[3:09:26.080 --> 3:09:28.080]  We've been at this for a long period of time
[3:09:28.080 --> 3:09:30.080]  and our view on the market
[3:09:30.080 --> 3:09:32.080]  is that this is a bull market.
[3:09:32.080 --> 3:09:34.080]  We recently had a bullish signal in the market
[3:09:34.080 --> 3:09:36.080]  based on a tool we use
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:38.080]  that in the face of $4
[3:09:38.080 --> 3:09:40.080]  or higher oil prices,
[3:09:40.080 --> 3:09:42.080]  gasoline prices,
[3:09:42.080 --> 3:09:44.080]  the Dow Jones transportation
[3:09:44.080 --> 3:09:46.080]  average has actually been moving
[3:09:46.080 --> 3:09:48.080]  to around its highest level ever.
[3:09:48.080 --> 3:09:50.080]  History has shown
[3:09:50.080 --> 3:09:52.080]  that the Dow Jones industrial average
[3:09:52.080 --> 3:09:54.080]  and the Dow Jones transportation average,
[3:09:54.080 --> 3:09:56.080]  and the movement to those averages generally
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:09:58.080]  portend future economic growth
[3:09:58.080 --> 3:10:00.080]  say six to nine months down the road.
[3:10:00.080 --> 3:10:02.080]  In the fact we're in a bull market,
[3:10:02.080 --> 3:10:04.080]  the fact that the Dow industrials
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:06.080]  to do well here
[3:10:06.080 --> 3:10:08.080]  are reasonably well
[3:10:08.080 --> 3:10:10.080]  indicates that perhaps
[3:10:10.080 --> 3:10:12.080]  the economy is not as weak as most people think
[3:10:12.080 --> 3:10:14.080]  and that in fact six months from now
[3:10:14.080 --> 3:10:16.080]  we'll start to see some significant
[3:10:16.080 --> 3:10:18.080]  improvement in the economy.
[3:10:18.080 --> 3:10:20.080]  And you think the dollar is going to strengthen?
[3:10:20.080 --> 3:10:22.080]  I do. I think that, you know,
[3:10:22.080 --> 3:10:24.080]  and one reason I based that on,
[3:10:24.080 --> 3:10:26.080]  I've been doing this for a long time.
[3:10:26.080 --> 3:10:28.080]  I've been in this business for over 25 years
[3:10:28.080 --> 3:10:30.080]  and I generally get very, very nervous
[3:10:30.080 --> 3:10:32.080]  when I see such a strong
[3:10:32.080 --> 3:10:34.080]  consensus opinion one way on a topic
[3:10:34.080 --> 3:10:36.080]  and it's tough to find anybody out there
[3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:38.080]  that believes
[3:10:38.080 --> 3:10:40.080]  that the dollar is going to strengthen
[3:10:40.080 --> 3:10:42.080]  and when you have that type of just
[3:10:42.080 --> 3:10:44.080]  overwhelming consensus, generally the consensus
[3:10:44.080 --> 3:10:46.080]  opinion proves wrong.
[3:10:46.080 --> 3:10:48.080]  I'm not saying it's going to skyrocket from here,
[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:50.080]  but I wouldn't be surprised at all
[3:10:50.080 --> 3:10:52.080]  that if the dollar is stronger
[3:10:52.080 --> 3:10:54.080]  by the end of the year
[3:10:54.080 --> 3:10:56.080]  than where it is today.
[3:10:56.080 --> 3:10:58.080]  So you think this is a buying opportunity?
[3:10:58.080 --> 3:11:00.080]  We do. We think it is a buying opportunity.
[3:11:00.080 --> 3:11:02.080]  If investors out there have been
[3:11:02.080 --> 3:11:04.080]  a little bashful about putting money into the market
[3:11:04.080 --> 3:11:06.080]  and we think there's opportunities out there
[3:11:06.080 --> 3:11:08.080]  and I think that those will be rewarded
[3:11:08.080 --> 3:11:10.080]  over the next 12 to 18 months.
[3:11:10.080 --> 3:11:12.080]  And you're the editor over at
[3:11:12.080 --> 3:11:14.080]  www.DrippinInvestor.com
[3:11:14.080 --> 3:11:16.080]  But again, there's so many different schools
[3:11:16.080 --> 3:11:18.080]  of economic thought and so many different views
[3:11:18.080 --> 3:11:20.080]  that we get and you're right, the majority of people are saying
[3:11:20.080 --> 3:11:22.080]  it looks like several more years of
[3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:24.080]  a recession, maybe a lot of
[3:11:24.080 --> 3:11:26.080]  depression talk. I certainly hope
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:28.080]  that's not the case, but
[3:11:28.080 --> 3:11:30.080]  if you have low interest rates
[3:11:30.080 --> 3:11:32.080]  that devalue the dollar, if you have
[3:11:32.080 --> 3:11:34.080]  out of control spending that
[3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:36.080]  creates incredible debt, which
[3:11:36.080 --> 3:11:38.080]  foreign investors see as a weakening dollar
[3:11:38.080 --> 3:11:40.080]  and you have this global
[3:11:40.080 --> 3:11:42.080]  commodities inflation
[3:11:42.080 --> 3:11:44.080]  going on because of speculation
[3:11:44.080 --> 3:11:46.080]  because people are looking for places
[3:11:46.080 --> 3:11:48.080]  to dump their dollars. I mean, A, do you agree
[3:11:48.080 --> 3:11:50.080]  with what I just said, just on basic facts
[3:11:50.080 --> 3:11:52.080]  and then B, to me
[3:11:52.080 --> 3:11:54.080]  that all points towards
[3:11:54.080 --> 3:11:56.080]  a weakening dollar. I mean, I see the point
[3:11:56.080 --> 3:11:58.080]  where a foreigner is going to go with their dollars
[3:11:58.080 --> 3:12:00.080]  trillions and trillions of them. You know, there's really
[3:12:00.080 --> 3:12:02.080]  nowhere to run, nowhere to go.
[3:12:02.080 --> 3:12:04.080]  So that's one reason the dollar may kind of
[3:12:04.080 --> 3:12:06.080]  just sit where it is now, but it's already
[3:12:06.080 --> 3:12:08.080]  been devalued. I mean, that's a lot of just basic
[3:12:08.080 --> 3:12:10.080]  thoughts there, your take on it. Well, I think
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:12.080]  one of the things that generally
[3:12:12.080 --> 3:12:14.080]  when people kind of think
[3:12:14.080 --> 3:12:16.080]  about the stock market and think about the economy,
[3:12:16.080 --> 3:12:18.080]  they're thinking about what's going on in today
[3:12:18.080 --> 3:12:20.080]  and extrapolating today's
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:22.080]  issues, today's problems into the future
[3:12:22.080 --> 3:12:24.080]  that the stock market
[3:12:24.080 --> 3:12:26.080]  has already taken account all that. It's already
[3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:28.080]  looking forward and it's always a huge mistake
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:30.080]  and it's made every day
[3:12:30.080 --> 3:12:32.080]  in the media of people applying the bad
[3:12:32.080 --> 3:12:34.080]  news of today in terms of
[3:12:34.080 --> 3:12:36.080]  how the market should be. In fact,
[3:12:36.080 --> 3:12:38.080]  again, the market's forward looking.
[3:12:38.080 --> 3:12:40.080]  So I don't get to
[3:12:40.080 --> 3:12:42.080]  I should say
[3:12:42.080 --> 3:12:44.080]  nervous when I'm looking around today and think
[3:12:44.080 --> 3:12:46.080]  things that don't seem to add up
[3:12:46.080 --> 3:12:48.080]  or are some problems in the market. Well, I agree
[3:12:48.080 --> 3:12:50.080]  with you. I don't look at what's happening today. I look
[3:12:50.080 --> 3:12:52.080]  at the long term. And I think that
[3:12:52.080 --> 3:12:54.080]  those
[3:12:54.080 --> 3:12:56.080]  when you look at that point, I mean, there's been
[3:12:56.080 --> 3:12:58.080]  a lot of problems people bring up
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:00.080]  that have been around for a while. Now, the one issue that you did bring up
[3:13:00.080 --> 3:13:02.080]  that is something that bears watching
[3:13:02.080 --> 3:13:04.080]  and yet could be a problem, but I think
[3:13:04.080 --> 3:13:06.080]  that it won't be
[3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:08.080]  is the notion of yes, we've
[3:13:08.080 --> 3:13:10.080]  had certainly a rise in inflation
[3:13:10.080 --> 3:13:12.080]  and is that going to continue? I think
[3:13:12.080 --> 3:13:14.080]  again, the strength
[3:13:14.080 --> 3:13:16.080]  in the Dow Jones industrial average and the Dow Jones
[3:13:16.080 --> 3:13:18.080]  transportation average and the Dow theory
[3:13:18.080 --> 3:13:20.080]  tool we use showing a bull market is indicating
[3:13:20.080 --> 3:13:22.080]  to us
[3:13:22.080 --> 3:13:24.080]  that inflation is not going to get out of hand that is not going
[3:13:24.080 --> 3:13:26.080]  to short circuit the economy
[3:13:26.080 --> 3:13:28.080]  and short circuit the stock market. Do you agree with the Fed
[3:13:28.080 --> 3:13:30.080]  that it's like 3%?
[3:13:30.080 --> 3:13:32.080]  No, the Fed's done lower in
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:34.080]  rates and the next
[3:13:34.080 --> 3:13:36.080]  no, I mean, I mean, do you agree with the Fed that inflation
[3:13:36.080 --> 3:13:38.080]  is less than 5%?
[3:13:38.080 --> 3:13:40.080]  I do.
[3:13:40.080 --> 3:13:42.080]  Well, you know, we can get into that argument
[3:13:42.080 --> 3:13:44.080]  about, you know, when you're looking at prices
[3:13:44.080 --> 3:13:46.080]  and things like that. I mean, obviously it's
[3:13:46.080 --> 3:13:48.080]  if we've got a permanent situation
[3:13:48.080 --> 3:13:50.080]  of $4 gasoline
[3:13:50.080 --> 3:13:52.080]  and, you know, agricultural prices
[3:13:52.080 --> 3:13:54.080]  where they are and that's a permanent state. No, inflation
[3:13:54.080 --> 3:13:56.080]  is going to turn out to be much higher than that. I don't
[3:13:56.080 --> 3:13:58.080]  think that's going to be the case.
[3:13:58.080 --> 3:14:00.080]  So
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:02.080]  I mean, give us your time frame then
[3:14:02.080 --> 3:14:04.080]  forecasting this. What are you
[3:14:04.080 --> 3:14:06.080]  on the positive side see happening
[3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:08.080]  versus the negative? I think in the next
[3:14:08.080 --> 3:14:10.080]  six months you're going to see
[3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:12.080]  discernible evidence of improvement in the economy.
[3:14:12.080 --> 3:14:14.080]  You're going to see
[3:14:14.080 --> 3:14:16.080]  corporate profits improving and in fact, you know,
[3:14:16.080 --> 3:14:18.080]  corporate profits have really not been as bad as people
[3:14:18.080 --> 3:14:20.080]  thought. The biggest problem in corporate
[3:14:20.080 --> 3:14:22.080]  profitability has been focused in
[3:14:22.080 --> 3:14:24.080]  the financial services area.
[3:14:24.080 --> 3:14:26.080]  When you look outside of that, profits have actually
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:28.080]  hung in there pretty well and I think that's going to continue
[3:14:28.080 --> 3:14:30.080]  to be the case. So I think
[3:14:30.080 --> 3:14:32.080]  you'll start to see some
[3:14:32.080 --> 3:14:34.080]  relaxation in some of these commodity prices
[3:14:34.080 --> 3:14:36.080]  again within the next six months.
[3:14:36.080 --> 3:14:38.080]  I think by the end of six months, people are
[3:14:38.080 --> 3:14:40.080]  going to be pleasantly surprised by what they're seeing
[3:14:40.080 --> 3:14:42.080]  in the economy and what they're seeing in some of the commodity
[3:14:42.080 --> 3:14:44.080]  pricing.
[3:14:44.080 --> 3:14:46.080]  And what
[3:14:46.080 --> 3:14:48.080]  do you think the main
[3:14:48.080 --> 3:14:50.080]  contributing factor is
[3:14:50.080 --> 3:14:52.080]  $2, $4
[3:14:52.080 --> 3:14:54.080]  a gallon gas, $135
[3:14:54.080 --> 3:14:56.080]  barrel oil. Well, there's
[3:14:56.080 --> 3:14:58.080]  a lot of people smarter and I that have looked
[3:14:58.080 --> 3:15:00.080]  at that.
[3:15:00.080 --> 3:15:02.080]  I think that, you know, you've had
[3:15:02.080 --> 3:15:04.080]  this continuation and strong global
[3:15:04.080 --> 3:15:06.080]  economic demand and emerging
[3:15:06.080 --> 3:15:08.080]  countries using more or we're using more
[3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:10.080]  etc.
[3:15:10.080 --> 3:15:12.080]  But I think at some point that is going to be
[3:15:12.080 --> 3:15:14.080]  the case that
[3:15:14.080 --> 3:15:16.080]  demand
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:18.080]  is going to be stated to some extent and I think
[3:15:18.080 --> 3:15:20.080]  that there's also been speculation
[3:15:20.080 --> 3:15:22.080]  that has driven up these prices on a short-term basis.
[3:15:22.080 --> 3:15:24.080]  Well, the Saudis are saying they're going to have
[3:15:24.080 --> 3:15:26.080]  a small increase in production, thank God.
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:28.080]  But I mean, if our government won't let us get into
[3:15:28.080 --> 3:15:30.080]  Anwar and other places, what do they expect?
[3:15:30.080 --> 3:15:32.080]  But I mean, the media seems to never
[3:15:32.080 --> 3:15:34.080]  want to talk about the main reason, according
[3:15:34.080 --> 3:15:36.080]  to all the indexes I've seen, about 70%
[3:15:36.080 --> 3:15:38.080]  of the oil increase in the last five years
[3:15:38.080 --> 3:15:40.080]  has been dollar devaluation.
[3:15:40.080 --> 3:15:42.080]  Now, John Stossel has admitted that
[3:15:42.080 --> 3:15:44.080]  on ABC, that's about it.
[3:15:44.080 --> 3:15:46.080]  Do you have any comments on the fact that
[3:15:46.080 --> 3:15:48.080]  it's dollar denominated and so that's
[3:15:48.080 --> 3:15:50.080]  why the main reason we're paying so much more?
[3:15:50.080 --> 3:15:52.080]  Well,
[3:15:52.080 --> 3:15:54.080]  there's an element to that but I don't think
[3:15:54.080 --> 3:15:56.080]  you can dispute and I think it's one of the reasons
[3:15:56.080 --> 3:15:58.080]  why, you know, again, you see in the face
[3:15:58.080 --> 3:16:00.080]  of high
[3:16:00.080 --> 3:16:02.080]  prices and energy that you've got
[3:16:02.080 --> 3:16:04.080]  such an economically sensitive
[3:16:04.080 --> 3:16:06.080]  indicator as a Dow Jones transportation average
[3:16:06.080 --> 3:16:08.080]  training around all-time highs. I mean, there is
[3:16:08.080 --> 3:16:10.080]  a demand component to this that has
[3:16:10.080 --> 3:16:12.080]  driven, you know,
[3:16:12.080 --> 3:16:14.080]  an economic growth, not just in the U.S.
[3:16:14.080 --> 3:16:16.080]  but especially globally, that has driven
[3:16:16.080 --> 3:16:18.080]  demand, that has driven, you know,
[3:16:18.080 --> 3:16:20.080]  demand for that and therefore prices up.
[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:22.080]  But, yeah, the dollar is tied in
[3:16:22.080 --> 3:16:24.080]  with that as well. I mean, I don't think you can
[3:16:24.080 --> 3:16:26.080]  point to any one indicator.
[3:16:26.080 --> 3:16:28.080]  But it all contributes.
[3:16:28.080 --> 3:16:30.080]  Why won't the media ever talk about
[3:16:30.080 --> 3:16:32.080]  the dollar devaluation,
[3:16:32.080 --> 3:16:34.080]  dollar-denominated oil on the OPEC
[3:16:34.080 --> 3:16:36.080]  exchange, and then
[3:16:36.080 --> 3:16:38.080]  on the Chicago Mercantile and all of it?
[3:16:38.080 --> 3:16:40.080]  I mean, how, and the stock markets and the rest
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:42.080]  of it, I mean, it's the dollar.
[3:16:42.080 --> 3:16:44.080]  How much of dollar devaluation has kept
[3:16:44.080 --> 3:16:46.080]  the stock market up because now it takes
[3:16:46.080 --> 3:16:48.080]  more of those dollars to buy those same stocks?
[3:16:48.080 --> 3:16:50.080]  Well, I don't know about
[3:16:50.080 --> 3:16:52.080]  that. I'm not sure
[3:16:52.080 --> 3:16:54.080]  the devaluation of the dollar is responsible
[3:16:54.080 --> 3:16:56.080]  for keeping the stock market up. That's not even
[3:16:56.080 --> 3:16:58.080]  a, you don't think that feeds into it at all?
[3:16:58.080 --> 3:17:00.080]  Well, you know, it's one piece of it
[3:17:00.080 --> 3:17:02.080]  but, I mean, at the end of the day, there are three things
[3:17:02.080 --> 3:17:04.080]  that drive stock prices. It's corporate profits,
[3:17:04.080 --> 3:17:06.080]  it's interest rates, and it's inflation.
[3:17:06.080 --> 3:17:08.080]  Ultimately, those are the
[3:17:08.080 --> 3:17:10.080]  major engines of
[3:17:10.080 --> 3:17:12.080]  stock market performance, of sustained stock
[3:17:12.080 --> 3:17:14.080]  market performance, and if you have problems
[3:17:14.080 --> 3:17:16.080]  in those engines,
[3:17:16.080 --> 3:17:18.080]  that's when the market falters. Now,
[3:17:18.080 --> 3:17:20.080]  you know, strong dollar, how does that play into
[3:17:20.080 --> 3:17:22.080]  interest rates and things like that, but at the
[3:17:22.080 --> 3:17:24.080]  end of the day, you know, there's a lot of
[3:17:24.080 --> 3:17:26.080]  noise out there, but if you want to focus on the things
[3:17:26.080 --> 3:17:28.080]  that are going to drive stock prices ultimately,
[3:17:28.080 --> 3:17:30.080]  it's corporate profits, it's interest rates, and inflation,
[3:17:30.080 --> 3:17:32.080]  and if you have two out of those three
[3:17:32.080 --> 3:17:34.080]  things on the negative side, it's very difficult
[3:17:34.080 --> 3:17:36.080]  for the market to sustain much on the upside.
[3:17:36.080 --> 3:17:38.080]  So, you're specifically looking at corporate
[3:17:38.080 --> 3:17:40.080]  profits in the economy. Do you see
[3:17:40.080 --> 3:17:42.080]  a separation, though, between the blue collar
[3:17:42.080 --> 3:17:44.080]  and working class, which every
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:46.080]  indicator shows are in deep trouble and sinking
[3:17:46.080 --> 3:17:48.080]  fast, compared to these international
[3:17:48.080 --> 3:17:50.080]  corporations? I mean, I don't
[3:17:50.080 --> 3:17:52.080]  see their bottom line necessarily
[3:17:52.080 --> 3:17:54.080]  equating to milk and honey for the general public.
[3:17:54.080 --> 3:17:56.080]  Well, the stock market is
[3:17:56.080 --> 3:17:58.080]  really a market of small stocks with a few
[3:17:58.080 --> 3:18:00.080]  larger companies sprinkled in. When you look at
[3:18:00.080 --> 3:18:02.080]  for example, we follow 5,000 stocks
[3:18:02.080 --> 3:18:04.080]  in our market system, probably
[3:18:04.080 --> 3:18:06.080]  8 to 9 out of every 10 companies
[3:18:06.080 --> 3:18:08.080]  are small companies. I mean,
[3:18:08.080 --> 3:18:10.080]  people like to focus on
[3:18:10.080 --> 3:18:12.080]  the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial
[3:18:12.080 --> 3:18:14.080]  average, or the 500 stocks in the
[3:18:14.080 --> 3:18:16.080]  S&P 500, those big mammoth
[3:18:16.080 --> 3:18:18.080]  companies, but the fact of the matter is
[3:18:18.080 --> 3:18:20.080]  the stock market consists of small
[3:18:20.080 --> 3:18:22.080]  companies. You're right. So, looking at all
[3:18:22.080 --> 3:18:24.080]  the indexes, as you do, as a very
[3:18:24.080 --> 3:18:26.080]  well-known and respected analyst,
[3:18:26.080 --> 3:18:28.080]  what is the market
[3:18:28.080 --> 3:18:30.080]  down up? I mean, where is it really?
[3:18:30.080 --> 3:18:32.080]  Because we know just looking at the 30 stocks
[3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:34.080]  is kind of skewed.
[3:18:34.080 --> 3:18:36.080]  Well, I think that when
[3:18:36.080 --> 3:18:38.080]  you, I think the market has performed
[3:18:38.080 --> 3:18:40.080]  pretty admirably since 2003.
[3:18:40.080 --> 3:18:42.080]  I mean, we had a little bit of a dip here
[3:18:42.080 --> 3:18:44.080]  from August into March of this year, but
[3:18:44.080 --> 3:18:46.080]  you know, you go back to 2003,
[3:18:46.080 --> 3:18:48.080]  it has been a decent market
[3:18:48.080 --> 3:18:50.080]  even tracking by the
[3:18:50.080 --> 3:18:52.080]  large companies. So, you judge the
[3:18:52.080 --> 3:18:54.080]  economy by the market itself
[3:18:54.080 --> 3:18:56.080]  just by the stocks. I think
[3:18:56.080 --> 3:18:58.080]  yeah, it is
[3:18:58.080 --> 3:19:00.080]  in my experience, and
[3:19:00.080 --> 3:19:02.080]  that goes back more than a quarter century, it is
[3:19:02.080 --> 3:19:04.080]  the best single best indicator
[3:19:04.080 --> 3:19:06.080]  for future economic activity
[3:19:06.080 --> 3:19:08.080]  in my opinion. Okay.
[3:19:08.080 --> 3:19:10.080]  Can you stay with us on the other side
[3:19:10.080 --> 3:19:12.080]  for five more minutes and tell us what
[3:19:12.080 --> 3:19:14.080]  stocks and in what sectors you think are going to be
[3:19:14.080 --> 3:19:16.080]  big? Sure. Okay, great.
[3:19:16.080 --> 3:19:18.080]  We're going to be back in three minutes with our guest.
[3:19:18.080 --> 3:19:20.080]  It's gripinvestor.com
[3:19:20.080 --> 3:19:22.080]  and
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:24.080]  he's Chuck B. Carlson. He's
[3:19:24.080 --> 3:19:26.080]  the CFA editor
[3:19:26.080 --> 3:19:28.080]  and we're getting his view on things
[3:19:28.080 --> 3:19:30.080]  and he's made some good predictions in the past.
[3:19:30.080 --> 3:19:32.080]  I mean, I hope guys like this are right,
[3:19:32.080 --> 3:19:34.080]  but the head of the New York Business School
[3:19:34.080 --> 3:19:36.080]  and Joseph Sticklitz and
[3:19:36.080 --> 3:19:38.080]  all these other people we've had on, they say
[3:19:38.080 --> 3:19:40.080]  get ready for Armageddon,
[3:19:40.080 --> 3:19:42.080]  financial Armageddon.
[3:19:42.080 --> 3:19:44.080]  I hope they're wrong.
[3:19:46.080 --> 3:19:48.080]  Hi, this is Dave from Ready Reserve Foods.
[3:19:48.080 --> 3:19:50.080]  I have been waiting patiently for the government
[3:19:50.080 --> 3:19:52.080]  and mainstream media to inform you of what is
[3:19:52.080 --> 3:19:54.080]  going out to be the biggest problem facing the world
[3:19:54.080 --> 3:19:56.080]  in the last 50 years.
[3:19:56.080 --> 3:19:58.080]  For the last three years, the earth has consumed
[3:19:58.080 --> 3:20:00.080]  more food than it has been able to produce
[3:20:00.080 --> 3:20:02.080]  and it has now finally caught up with this
[3:20:02.080 --> 3:20:04.080]  and the U.S. commodities such as flour and rice
[3:20:04.080 --> 3:20:06.080]  are already being rationed and the next rice crop
[3:20:06.080 --> 3:20:08.080]  won't be available for another four to five months.
[3:20:08.080 --> 3:20:10.080]  It's fall in the southern hemisphere
[3:20:10.080 --> 3:20:12.080]  and many countries are short the food necessary
[3:20:12.080 --> 3:20:14.080]  to make it through the winter and have stopped
[3:20:14.080 --> 3:20:16.080]  exporting certain commodities altogether.
[3:20:16.080 --> 3:20:18.080]  Remember our trade deficit? Trillions of dollars
[3:20:18.080 --> 3:20:20.080]  have stacked up outside the country
[3:20:20.080 --> 3:20:22.080]  rushing in to buy our food production at any price.
[3:20:22.080 --> 3:20:24.080]  By late summer, if not early fall,
[3:20:24.080 --> 3:20:26.080]  it is likely our government will step in
[3:20:26.080 --> 3:20:28.080]  and control food and food exports under
[3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:30.080]  martial law.

[3:20:48.080 --> 3:20:50.080]  A new world order.
[3:20:50.080 --> 3:20:52.080]  In the near future,
[3:20:52.080 --> 3:20:54.080]  Earth is dominated by a powerful
[3:20:54.080 --> 3:20:56.080]  world government. It's known as
[3:20:56.080 --> 3:20:58.080]  the Builder Bird.
[3:20:58.080 --> 3:21:00.080]  What their objective being world domination?
[3:21:00.080 --> 3:21:02.080]  For thousands of years
[3:21:02.080 --> 3:21:04.080]  their dark order grew.
[3:21:04.080 --> 3:21:06.080]  Now as they hail the birth of the
[3:21:06.080 --> 3:21:08.080]  new world order, their great dream
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:10.080]  of exterminating 80%
[3:21:10.080 --> 3:21:12.080]  of humanity is at hand.
[3:21:14.080 --> 3:21:16.080]  For the first time in history
[3:21:16.080 --> 3:21:18.080]  the elites plan for world government

[3:21:24.080 --> 3:21:26.080]  Builder Bird is making great progress
[3:21:26.080 --> 3:21:28.080]  for the world government.
[3:21:28.080 --> 3:21:30.080]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[3:21:30.080 --> 3:21:32.080]  They have all the money they need.
[3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:34.080]  They're after power.

[3:22:06.080 --> 3:22:08.080]  alternative to a fiat paper currency

[3:24:32.080 --> 3:24:34.080]  but it only goes up and up year after year
[3:24:34.080 --> 3:24:36.080]  and then it'll go spike in the summer
[3:24:36.080 --> 3:24:38.080]  go down a little but then spike to all time
[3:24:38.080 --> 3:24:40.080]  high as the next summer
[3:24:40.080 --> 3:24:42.080]  you look at the graph it's going straight up
[3:24:42.080 --> 3:24:44.080]  I guess I'm not a believer that it is going to continue
[3:24:44.080 --> 3:24:46.080]  to go straight up and I think it'll spike
[3:24:46.080 --> 3:24:48.080]  through the summer and I think it'll come down
[3:24:48.080 --> 3:24:50.080]  and I think those will be the highs
[3:24:50.080 --> 3:24:52.080]  we'll see probably
[3:24:52.080 --> 3:24:54.080]  where do you see oil per gallon settling out at
[3:24:54.080 --> 3:24:56.080]  probably but I don't think it's going to be
[3:24:56.080 --> 3:24:58.080]  significantly higher than it is here maybe 140
[3:24:58.080 --> 3:25:00.080]  maybe 145 or peaks
[3:25:00.080 --> 3:25:02.080]  I think the
[3:25:02.080 --> 3:25:04.080]  the more likely commodity come down
[3:25:04.080 --> 3:25:06.080]  in the short run I think some of the agricultural
[3:25:06.080 --> 3:25:08.080]  commodities and you're starting to see them
[3:25:08.080 --> 3:25:10.080]  weakened already and I think you'll start to see
[3:25:10.080 --> 3:25:12.080]  those commodity prices come down
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:14.080]  well I agree most of it's been speculation
[3:25:14.080 --> 3:25:16.080]  not food shortages
[3:25:16.080 --> 3:25:18.080]  right how does that happen
[3:25:18.080 --> 3:25:20.080]  well you know again at the end
[3:25:20.080 --> 3:25:22.080]  of the day those prices are
[3:25:22.080 --> 3:25:24.080]  driven by spying
[3:25:24.080 --> 3:25:26.080]  demand and you know
[3:25:26.080 --> 3:25:28.080]  if there's a huge amount of speculation where you have
[3:25:28.080 --> 3:25:30.080]  people demand you know it's the same thing when you have
[3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:32.080]  individual stocks like in the internet stocks
[3:25:32.080 --> 3:25:34.080]  when they were just soaring
[3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:36.080]  without really back in
[3:25:36.080 --> 3:25:38.080]  2009 and 2000 without any revenues
[3:25:38.080 --> 3:25:40.080]  and profits but
[3:25:40.080 --> 3:25:42.080]  you had a lot of investors that were chasing momentum
[3:25:42.080 --> 3:25:44.080]  and chasing demand well it's like a 25 cent
[3:25:44.080 --> 3:25:46.080]  beanie baby going for $500
[3:25:46.080 --> 3:25:48.080]  exactly I mean it doesn't really make any sense
[3:25:48.080 --> 3:25:50.080]  but once you're in that bubble
[3:25:50.080 --> 3:25:52.080]  and you've got a lot of people chasing it
[3:25:52.080 --> 3:25:54.080]  those prices are going to continue to go higher
[3:25:54.080 --> 3:25:56.080]  giant Las Vegas in the sky
[3:25:56.080 --> 3:25:58.080]  what stocks do you see
[3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:00.080]  as being proven continual winners
[3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:02.080]  what do you see as good
[3:26:02.080 --> 3:26:04.080]  good areas to be in
[3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:06.080]  well you know we actually like some technology issues
[3:26:06.080 --> 3:26:08.080]  one in particular is a company called qualcom
[3:26:08.080 --> 3:26:10.080]  which our clients
[3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:12.080]  do own qualcom
[3:26:12.080 --> 3:26:14.080]  is in the telecom area
[3:26:14.080 --> 3:26:16.080]  they're creating third generation
[3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:18.080]  infrastructure equipment
[3:26:18.080 --> 3:26:20.080]  for wireless systems
[3:26:20.080 --> 3:26:22.080]  one thing too I'll just point out
[3:26:22.080 --> 3:26:24.080]  as it relates to our newsletter drip investor
[3:26:24.080 --> 3:26:26.080]  qualcom is a company
[3:26:26.080 --> 3:26:28.080]  or anybody listening to my voice right now
[3:26:28.080 --> 3:26:30.080]  can buy this stock directly from the company
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:32.080]  first share in every share
[3:26:32.080 --> 3:26:34.080]  and the minimum initial investment I believe in qualcom
[3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:36.080]  is just a thousand dollars so I mean
[3:26:36.080 --> 3:26:38.080]  anybody can get started owning
[3:26:38.080 --> 3:26:40.080]  a stock like qualcom you don't need to
[3:26:40.080 --> 3:26:42.080]  that's right that's your specialty
[3:26:42.080 --> 3:26:44.080]  is teaching folks how to get rid of these brokers
[3:26:44.080 --> 3:26:46.080]  well I don't know about getting rid of
[3:26:46.080 --> 3:26:48.080]  the brokers but certainly doing it themselves
[3:26:48.080 --> 3:26:50.080]  in dollar amounts and make sense for their pocketbook
[3:26:50.080 --> 3:26:52.080]  I mean there's a huge number of people out there
[3:26:52.080 --> 3:26:54.080]  that would like to get in the game
[3:26:54.080 --> 3:26:56.080]  but they feel that they can't because they don't have
[3:26:56.080 --> 3:26:58.080]  five or ten or fifteen thousand dollars
[3:26:58.080 --> 3:27:00.080]  you don't need that to buy
[3:27:00.080 --> 3:27:02.080]  good quality stocks I mean
[3:27:02.080 --> 3:27:04.080]  in our latest news
[3:27:04.080 --> 3:27:06.080]  okay but what are continuals
[3:27:06.080 --> 3:27:08.080]  technology do you like google
[3:27:08.080 --> 3:27:10.080]  yeah I do
[3:27:10.080 --> 3:27:12.080]  I think it's a pretty good stock actually
[3:27:12.080 --> 3:27:14.080]  you think it's going to keep going up or just
[3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:16.080]  I do you know again nothing goes up in a straight line
[3:27:16.080 --> 3:27:18.080]  what about yahoo what about yahoo
[3:27:18.080 --> 3:27:20.080]  I'm not as optimistic about that
[3:27:20.080 --> 3:27:22.080]  so you think the way it's been going up isn't going to continue
[3:27:22.080 --> 3:27:24.080]  that's your speculation on Microsoft
[3:27:24.080 --> 3:27:26.080]  I would avoid that
[3:27:26.080 --> 3:27:28.080]  stock regardless I don't know
[3:27:28.080 --> 3:27:30.080]  if the deal is going to get done there or not but it's not one we like
[3:27:30.080 --> 3:27:32.080]  okay
[3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:34.080]  what else do you like in energy
[3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:36.080]  well in energy we like
[3:27:36.080 --> 3:27:38.080]  the drillers more than anything
[3:27:38.080 --> 3:27:40.080]  a company like Transocean which is
[3:27:40.080 --> 3:27:42.080]  the world's largest offshore drilling company
[3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:44.080]  I think that even if you have oil prices
[3:27:44.080 --> 3:27:46.080]  recede from these levels
[3:27:46.080 --> 3:27:48.080]  there's still a huge impetus
[3:27:48.080 --> 3:27:50.080]  for the
[3:27:50.080 --> 3:27:52.080]  exploration of oil companies to continue
[3:27:52.080 --> 3:27:54.080]  to explore even if you know
[3:27:54.080 --> 3:27:56.080]  if we're at $100 oil it still makes sense
[3:27:56.080 --> 3:27:58.080]  so I think the drillers are the best
[3:27:58.080 --> 3:28:00.080]  way to go there and one that we like and own is
[3:28:00.080 --> 3:28:02.080]  Transocean
[3:28:02.080 --> 3:28:04.080]  it's okay
[3:28:04.080 --> 3:28:06.080]  you know that hasn't
[3:28:06.080 --> 3:28:08.080]  necessarily been the greatest company
[3:28:08.080 --> 3:28:10.080]  in that space I guess
[3:28:10.080 --> 3:28:12.080]  if you're looking at the major producers
[3:28:12.080 --> 3:28:14.080]  you know we tend to think
[3:28:14.080 --> 3:28:16.080]  that Chevron is probably the best play
[3:28:16.080 --> 3:28:18.080]  followed by Exxon
[3:28:18.080 --> 3:28:20.080]  if you're looking at the oil producer
[3:28:20.080 --> 3:28:22.080]  I just brought up Marathon
[3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:24.080]  because they're all over Texas and they're
[3:28:24.080 --> 3:28:26.080]  one of the few companies actually building a refinery
[3:28:26.080 --> 3:28:28.080]  well there's nothing wrong with them
[3:28:28.080 --> 3:28:30.080]  and I know Marathon has been kicked around from time to time
[3:28:30.080 --> 3:28:32.080]  as a potential takeover stock in that group
[3:28:32.080 --> 3:28:34.080]  so I you know
[3:28:34.080 --> 3:28:36.080]  it's not a bad company it's just not
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:38.080]  our favorite among our favorites
[3:28:38.080 --> 3:28:40.080]  oh no I know that's a small one I was just curious
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:42.080]  I'm surprised you even know about it
[3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:44.080]  well what else is good out there
[3:28:44.080 --> 3:28:46.080]  defense not good
[3:28:46.080 --> 3:28:48.080]  well we still like the defense stocks
[3:28:48.080 --> 3:28:50.080]  we still recommend Lockheed Martin in general dynamics
[3:28:50.080 --> 3:28:52.080]  we think that
[3:28:52.080 --> 3:28:54.080]  earnings for those companies are still going to continue to be
[3:28:54.080 --> 3:28:56.080]  pretty strong and I think the stocks will hold up
[3:28:56.080 --> 3:28:58.080]  what about gold stocks
[3:28:58.080 --> 3:29:00.080]  gold mining stocks
[3:29:00.080 --> 3:29:02.080]  we're not buyers of those stocks but the one commodities
[3:29:02.080 --> 3:29:04.080]  metal stock
[3:29:04.080 --> 3:29:06.080]  that we do have is Freeport

[3:33:14.080 --> 3:33:16.080]  what I do is I circle
[3:33:16.080 --> 3:33:18.080]  yes out of news articles
[3:33:18.080 --> 3:33:20.080]  and give them to Trey
[3:33:20.080 --> 3:33:22.080]  and for some reason
[3:33:22.080 --> 3:33:24.080]  I circled that guy's name like a month ago
[3:33:24.080 --> 3:33:26.080]  and then I couldn't find the original article
[3:33:26.080 --> 3:33:28.080]  and I couldn't remember why I wanted him on
[3:33:28.080 --> 3:33:30.080]  so he just basically got his line
[3:33:30.080 --> 3:33:32.080]  on everything
[3:33:32.080 --> 3:33:34.080]  but unfortunately
[3:33:34.080 --> 3:33:36.080]  I think that guy is wrong in many many ways
[3:33:36.080 --> 3:33:38.080]  I don't disagree with him about
[3:33:38.080 --> 3:33:40.080]  you're going to be invested in stocks defense
[3:33:40.080 --> 3:33:42.080]  which is really war, extermination op
[3:33:42.080 --> 3:33:44.080]  invest in the death machine
[3:33:44.080 --> 3:33:46.080]  or you can invest because it didn't defense
[3:33:46.080 --> 3:33:48.080]  when they're striking countries first is it
[3:33:48.080 --> 3:33:50.080]  best defense is good offense
[3:33:50.080 --> 3:33:52.080]  yeah but you're a slave too
[3:33:52.080 --> 3:33:54.080]  understand you're not part of the power structure
[3:33:54.080 --> 3:33:56.080]  alright I got a big news blitz

[3:34:08.080 --> 3:34:10.080]  in the money bomb
[3:34:10.080 --> 3:34:12.080]  I am maxed out
[3:34:12.080 --> 3:34:14.080]  with bandwidth and paying for things
[3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:16.080]  and going to Bilderberg
[3:34:16.080 --> 3:34:18.080]  and paying for camera guys and cameras
[3:34:18.080 --> 3:34:20.080]  and everything else we do
[3:34:20.080 --> 3:34:22.080]  we need more capital so I ask listeners
[3:34:22.080 --> 3:34:24.080]  buy the books and videos at infowars.com
[3:34:24.080 --> 3:34:26.080]  or by calling 888-253-3139

[3:34:32.080 --> 3:34:34.080]  or you can go to
[3:34:34.080 --> 3:34:36.080]  youtube.tv

[3:34:38.080 --> 3:34:40.080]  all of that
[3:34:40.080 --> 3:34:42.080]  makes what we do possible
[3:34:42.080 --> 3:34:44.080]  and no I didn't come up with the idea for a money bomb
[3:34:44.080 --> 3:34:46.080]  but I'm not going to sit around and have one
[3:34:46.080 --> 3:34:48.080]  be a failure I'll tell you that
[3:34:48.080 --> 3:34:50.080]  and then people got some people got mad
[3:34:50.080 --> 3:34:52.080]  that I'm having one like I'm the government taking
[3:34:52.080 --> 3:34:54.080]  people's money I mean who cares
[3:34:54.080 --> 3:34:56.080]  we're having a money bomb if people want to give
[3:34:56.080 --> 3:34:58.080]  they give them they don't they don't
[3:34:58.080 --> 3:35:00.080]  so now I'm all behind it
[3:35:00.080 --> 3:35:02.080]  and I'm asking everybody that's pledged
[3:35:02.080 --> 3:35:04.080]  to add and pledge to go pledge
[3:35:04.080 --> 3:35:06.080]  you know
[3:35:06.080 --> 3:35:08.080]  to give ten dollars a hundred dollars I don't care
[3:35:08.080 --> 3:35:10.080]  because I need ammo for my info
[3:35:10.080 --> 3:35:12.080]  weapon I mean I want to spray
[3:35:12.080 --> 3:35:14.080]  the enemy up one side and down the other
[3:35:14.080 --> 3:35:16.080]  I mean I'm basically not out of ammo
[3:35:16.080 --> 3:35:18.080]  here
[3:35:18.080 --> 3:35:20.080]  I'm running a bunch of weapons here in the info war
[3:35:20.080 --> 3:35:22.080]  blowing the daylights out of the enemy
[3:35:22.080 --> 3:35:24.080]  but I want to get bigger guns batter guns

[3:35:26.080 --> 3:35:28.080]  and you can be assured here
[3:35:28.080 --> 3:35:30.080]  that the ammo you buy us in the info war
[3:35:30.080 --> 3:35:32.080]  will be slapped into the
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:34.080]  howitzer and immediately fired
[3:35:34.080 --> 3:35:36.080]  right on top the enemy I mean it won't
[3:35:36.080 --> 3:35:38.080]  even be in the case long it'll be
[3:35:38.080 --> 3:35:40.080]  dropped into my
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:42.080]  magazine it'll be fired out
[3:35:42.080 --> 3:35:44.080]  with vicious precision right at the enemies
[3:35:44.080 --> 3:35:46.080]  splatter upside their head
[3:35:46.080 --> 3:35:48.080]  and range shrapnel down around their minions
[3:35:48.080 --> 3:35:50.080]  we are discrediting them
[3:35:50.080 --> 3:35:52.080]  we're exposing them we're ripping away
[3:35:52.080 --> 3:35:54.080]  all their veils we're smashing them
[3:35:54.080 --> 3:35:56.080]  into heaps of wreckage
[3:35:56.080 --> 3:35:58.080]  and them in the new orders in deep trouble folks
[3:35:58.080 --> 3:36:00.080]  they're having to admit things
[3:36:00.080 --> 3:36:02.080]  they're falling apart their systems in trouble
[3:36:02.080 --> 3:36:04.080]  their system of lies
[3:36:04.080 --> 3:36:06.080]  their credibility is falling apart
[3:36:06.080 --> 3:36:08.080]  but it's only the beginning we got to go a lot further
[3:36:10.080 --> 3:36:12.080]  we've drawn blood they've been attacking us
[3:36:12.080 --> 3:36:14.080]  we finally fought back and
[3:36:14.080 --> 3:36:16.080]  they've stumbled we've realized we can actually
[3:36:16.080 --> 3:36:18.080]  fight back we've got the initiative
[3:36:18.080 --> 3:36:20.080]  we've got the moral high ground
[3:36:20.080 --> 3:36:22.080]  info wars dot com go there link

[3:36:30.080 --> 3:36:32.080]  into Saturday morning Saturday day
[3:36:32.080 --> 3:36:34.080]  and then Saturday
[3:36:34.080 --> 3:36:36.080]  8 to midnight
[3:36:36.080 --> 3:36:38.080]  I'm coming in here to do a internet only show
[3:36:38.080 --> 3:36:40.080]  so I don't want to shove around
[3:36:40.080 --> 3:36:42.080]  a bunch of shows that are on Saturday night on Genesis
[3:36:42.080 --> 3:36:44.080]  so 8 to midnight
[3:36:44.080 --> 3:36:46.080]  4 hours we're going to have Jack McClammon
[3:36:46.080 --> 3:36:48.080]  we're going to have Gia Griffin pop in

[3:36:50.080 --> 3:36:52.080]  are going to be popping in for a little 10-15 minute
[3:36:52.080 --> 3:36:54.080]  mini interviews and your phone calls
[3:36:54.080 --> 3:36:56.080]  so I won't do just about the money bomb
[3:36:56.080 --> 3:36:58.080]  it'll be about a bunch of issues
[3:36:58.080 --> 3:37:00.080]  so we can announce at midnight central
[3:37:00.080 --> 3:37:02.080]  standard time how much the money
[3:37:02.080 --> 3:37:04.080]  bomb has brought in
[3:37:04.080 --> 3:37:06.080]  so that is
[3:37:06.080 --> 3:37:08.080]  coming up Sunday
[3:37:08.080 --> 3:37:10.080]  I mean Saturday into
[3:37:10.080 --> 3:37:12.080]  Sunday morning
[3:37:12.080 --> 3:37:14.080]  so obviously I'll go a little bit over past midnight
[3:37:16.080 --> 3:37:18.080]  but I'll be live 8 p.m. central
[3:37:18.080 --> 3:37:20.080]  time then back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[3:37:20.080 --> 3:37:22.080]  that will be on the stations
[3:37:22.080 --> 3:37:24.080]  I'm going to plug some sponsors
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:26.080]  that outside money bomb
[3:37:26.080 --> 3:37:28.080]  that's how we fund this operation
[3:37:28.080 --> 3:37:30.080]  so
[3:37:30.080 --> 3:37:32.080]  please think about them, please support them
[3:37:32.080 --> 3:37:34.080]  they make this show possible
[3:37:34.080 --> 3:37:36.080]  one of them is inner food
[3:37:36.080 --> 3:37:38.080]  and it really is the best green food I've ever found
[3:37:38.080 --> 3:37:40.080]  if you go to infowars.com
[3:37:40.080 --> 3:37:42.080]  there's a big banner to inner health botanicals
[3:37:42.080 --> 3:37:44.080]  with all their great line of products
[3:37:44.080 --> 3:37:46.080]  they're also friends with George Humphrey and Patriots
[3:37:46.080 --> 3:37:48.080]  I didn't use to hardly take sponsors
[3:37:48.080 --> 3:37:50.080]  I didn't even have a sales guy
[3:37:50.080 --> 3:37:52.080]  I just fell in my lap and I liked the sponsor
[3:37:52.080 --> 3:37:54.080]  I'd take it and then I hired more people
[3:37:54.080 --> 3:37:56.080]  and had to actually make payroll
[3:37:56.080 --> 3:37:58.080]  so I better get some sponsors
[3:37:58.080 --> 3:38:00.080]  that made all the other hosts mad
[3:38:00.080 --> 3:38:02.080]  but they can go to Hades and they don't like it
[3:38:02.080 --> 3:38:04.080]  I used to just be like a jellyfish
[3:38:04.080 --> 3:38:06.080]  only find the new world order
[3:38:06.080 --> 3:38:08.080]  but side issue

[3:38:50.080 --> 3:38:52.080]  another fabulous sponsor
[3:38:52.080 --> 3:38:54.080]  who I bought food
[3:38:54.080 --> 3:38:56.080]  from about 8 years ago
[3:38:56.080 --> 3:38:58.080]  it's still good but I only bought like a half year then
[3:38:58.080 --> 3:39:00.080]  then about 5 years ago I bought more
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:02.080]  then about 2 years ago I bought more
[3:39:02.080 --> 3:39:04.080]  then about 6 months ago I bought more
[3:39:04.080 --> 3:39:06.080]  and then I gave some of the food to family
[3:39:06.080 --> 3:39:08.080]  so I got like a 2 year supply
[3:39:08.080 --> 3:39:10.080]  for 3 people
[3:39:10.080 --> 3:39:12.080]  and I guess I better get it for a 4th now
[3:39:12.080 --> 3:39:14.080]  in the family
[3:39:14.080 --> 3:39:16.080]  it's not that I'm living in fear
[3:39:16.080 --> 3:39:18.080]  it's not that I think ever the world is about to end
[3:39:18.080 --> 3:39:20.080]  but if there is a depression, there is food riots
[3:39:20.080 --> 3:39:22.080]  or there is a bird flu outbreak
[3:39:22.080 --> 3:39:24.080]  I can go hunker down out in the
[3:39:24.080 --> 3:39:26.080]  tent or out in the field
[3:39:26.080 --> 3:39:28.080]  I need to get an old
[3:39:28.080 --> 3:39:30.080]  I don't have time to go buy one
[3:39:30.080 --> 3:39:32.080]  an old RV
[3:39:32.080 --> 3:39:34.080]  but I want one of those huge ones

[3:40:20.080 --> 3:40:22.080]  all our AM and FM affiliates
[3:40:22.080 --> 3:40:24.080]  and ask listeners to remember
[3:40:24.080 --> 3:40:26.080]  whether it's KCXL or WBCR
[3:40:26.080 --> 3:40:28.080]  or
[3:40:28.080 --> 3:40:30.080]  KCAA
[3:40:30.080 --> 3:40:32.080]  or how's so many other
[3:40:32.080 --> 3:40:34.080]  we've got almost 70 affiliates
[3:40:34.080 --> 3:40:36.080]  I know they just got
[3:40:36.080 --> 3:40:38.080]  three more in the last week
[3:40:38.080 --> 3:40:40.080]  probably half our affiliates
[3:40:40.080 --> 3:40:42.080]  though Karius at night or rebroadcaster on the weekend
[3:40:42.080 --> 3:40:44.080]  probably got only 35 stations
[3:40:44.080 --> 3:40:46.080]  at Karius live during the show
[3:40:46.080 --> 3:40:48.080]  but that's a lot and then internet, shortwave, satellite
[3:40:48.080 --> 3:40:50.080]  but still some of these are in big cities
[3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:52.080]  like San Diego
[3:40:52.080 --> 3:40:54.080]  into LA, like Kansas City, like Buffalo
[3:40:54.080 --> 3:40:56.080]  like Austin, Texas
[3:40:58.080 --> 3:41:00.080]  like Chicago or on two stations
[3:41:00.080 --> 3:41:02.080]  that go into Chicago
[3:41:02.080 --> 3:41:04.080]  and I'm just very very thankful to those
[3:41:04.080 --> 3:41:06.080]  AM and FM affiliates
[3:41:06.080 --> 3:41:08.080]  for all their sponsors, if you're a local business
[3:41:08.080 --> 3:41:10.080]  be sure and sponsor the show
[3:41:10.080 --> 3:41:12.080]  and spread the word
[3:41:12.080 --> 3:41:14.080]  that you listen because these are mom and pop
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:16.080]  stations that have gone to great risk
[3:41:16.080 --> 3:41:18.080]  and great hurdles and a lot of things
[3:41:18.080 --> 3:41:20.080]  to let me come on here and babble
[3:41:20.080 --> 3:41:22.080]  and try to get the truth out to people and I'm not perfect
[3:41:22.080 --> 3:41:24.080]  I'm silly and ignorant but I got guts
[3:41:24.080 --> 3:41:26.080]  and guts is enough and so do they
[3:41:26.080 --> 3:41:28.080]  and so be sure and support them as well
[3:41:28.080 --> 3:41:30.080]  okay
[3:41:30.080 --> 3:41:32.080]  super news blitz and that means I have to
[3:41:32.080 --> 3:41:34.080]  some of this I'm recapping
[3:41:34.080 --> 3:41:36.080]  most of this I haven't gotten to but the stacks
[3:41:36.080 --> 3:41:38.080]  are so big today and yesterday that I haven't gotten to
[3:41:38.080 --> 3:41:40.080]  I'm just going to read you the headlines
[3:41:44.080 --> 3:41:46.080]  political punch, power, pop
[3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:48.080]  and probings for maybe senior
[3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:50.080]  national correspondent
[3:41:50.080 --> 3:41:52.080]  and this gets into
[3:41:52.080 --> 3:41:54.080]  McClellan on Bush's version of the truth
[3:41:54.080 --> 3:41:56.080]  from cocaine to
[3:41:56.080 --> 3:41:58.080]  the destruction of partisan warfare
[3:41:58.080 --> 3:42:00.080]  I know people that have seen Bush do cocaine
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:02.080]  and it is deadly
[3:42:02.080 --> 3:42:04.080]  I put my life in my
[3:42:04.080 --> 3:42:06.080]  hands
[3:42:06.080 --> 3:42:08.080]  I mean in peril to even talk about it
[3:42:08.080 --> 3:42:10.080]  but everybody knows in Austin you talk to entertainers
[3:42:10.080 --> 3:42:12.080]  other people I mean Bush
[3:42:12.080 --> 3:42:14.080]  didn't stop doing cocaine
[3:42:14.080 --> 3:42:16.080]  I don't know anybody that knew him doing it before
[3:42:16.080 --> 3:42:18.080]  he was governor because he did cool down
[3:42:18.080 --> 3:42:20.080]  a little bit after that but it isn't
[3:42:20.080 --> 3:42:22.080]  he didn't stop drinking and doing cocaine 20 years ago
[3:42:22.080 --> 3:42:24.080]  like he says he did and it just shows
[3:42:24.080 --> 3:42:26.080]  he's just total scum
[3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:28.080]  I mean how does he run around doubling
[3:42:28.080 --> 3:42:30.080]  when he's been in office the drug war
[3:42:30.080 --> 3:42:32.080]  doubling while he's been in office 7 years
[3:42:32.080 --> 3:42:34.080]  and then the son of the
[3:42:34.080 --> 3:42:36.080]  the
[3:42:36.080 --> 3:42:38.080]  fake cowboy
[3:42:38.080 --> 3:42:40.080]  SWAT
[3:42:40.080 --> 3:42:42.080]  teams and all this stuff I'm just sick of it
[3:42:44.080 --> 3:42:46.080]  just amazing
[3:42:46.080 --> 3:42:48.080]  McClellan saying he didn't know about all this
[3:42:48.080 --> 3:42:50.080]  sure he didn't
[3:42:50.080 --> 3:42:52.080]  he's saying this now because they realize the crimes
[3:42:52.080 --> 3:42:54.080]  that have been committed and these guys are trying to
[3:42:54.080 --> 3:42:56.080]  claim that they weren't part of it
[3:42:56.080 --> 3:42:58.080]  that's a good sign
[3:42:58.080 --> 3:43:00.080]  because McClellan's got to know
[3:43:00.080 --> 3:43:02.080]  it's dangerous
[3:43:02.080 --> 3:43:04.080]  the guy that
[3:43:04.080 --> 3:43:06.080]  brought Charlie Manson to trial
[3:43:06.080 --> 3:43:08.080]  famous prosecutors saying Bush is a murderer
[3:43:08.080 --> 3:43:10.080]  should go to prison he admitted his life is in danger
[3:43:10.080 --> 3:43:12.080]  I mean it's dangerous to go up against these mafia
[3:43:12.080 --> 3:43:14.080]  dons
[3:43:14.080 --> 3:43:16.080]  and you're a new listener I'm not a liberal
[3:43:16.080 --> 3:43:18.080]  Bush is a whore
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:20.080]  the new ruler runs nothing
[3:43:20.080 --> 3:43:22.080]  Clinton, Hillary, Obama, McCain they're all
[3:43:22.080 --> 3:43:24.080]  slime
[3:43:24.080 --> 3:43:26.080]  it was Sean Hannity driving home here
[3:43:26.080 --> 3:43:28.080]  it was total false reality
[3:43:28.080 --> 3:43:30.080]  I am so blessed that I'm not fake
[3:43:30.080 --> 3:43:32.080]  I am so blessed I don't have to think about
[3:43:32.080 --> 3:43:34.080]  what I'm about to say because I know what I'm going to say
[3:43:34.080 --> 3:43:36.080]  that I don't have to sit there and make up and pose
[3:43:36.080 --> 3:43:38.080]  as a conservative and pose
[3:43:38.080 --> 3:43:40.080]  like I'm saving the country and he was talking about
[3:43:40.080 --> 3:43:42.080]  how the conservative movement's been taken over
[3:43:42.080 --> 3:43:44.080]  and how we've got to get it back
[3:43:44.080 --> 3:43:46.080]  and get back to conservatism and how George Bush is good
[3:43:46.080 --> 3:43:48.080]  you guys are a bunch of new
[3:43:48.080 --> 3:43:50.080]  old order gun grabbing open border promoting
[3:43:50.080 --> 3:43:52.080]  that's the thing this government is illegitimate
[3:43:52.080 --> 3:43:54.080]  democrat, republican, state, local
[3:43:54.080 --> 3:43:56.080]  the government lies
[3:43:56.080 --> 3:43:58.080]  they cheat, they steal
[3:43:58.080 --> 3:44:00.080]  they've been caught doing it millions of times
[3:44:02.080 --> 3:44:04.080]  they're totally bankrupt
[3:44:04.080 --> 3:44:06.080]  they're out of control
[3:44:06.080 --> 3:44:08.080]  and I say you're illegitimate
[3:44:08.080 --> 3:44:10.080]  and history shows that and when you violate the bill of rights
[3:44:10.080 --> 3:44:12.080]  and constitution that makes you enemies
[3:44:12.080 --> 3:44:14.080]  it makes you seditious
[3:44:14.080 --> 3:44:16.080]  do you understand
[3:44:16.080 --> 3:44:18.080]  cops didn't use to come up to you
[3:44:18.080 --> 3:44:20.080]  and tell you you couldn't stand on the street corner with a sign
[3:44:20.080 --> 3:44:22.080]  that's unamerican
[3:44:22.080 --> 3:44:24.080]  I don't care what you say to me
[3:44:24.080 --> 3:44:26.080]  I don't care what bull you've been fed
[3:44:26.080 --> 3:44:28.080]  I know you're wrong
[3:44:28.080 --> 3:44:30.080]  oh like I said
[3:44:30.080 --> 3:44:32.080]  I saw five videos last night
[3:44:32.080 --> 3:44:34.080]  I wasn't even looking for them
[3:44:34.080 --> 3:44:36.080]  I was on Jack McClam's site
[3:44:36.080 --> 3:44:38.080]  and clicked on one
[3:44:38.080 --> 3:44:40.080]  and then I was
[3:44:40.080 --> 3:44:42.080]  I took me to YouTube and I saw like four more on the side
[3:44:42.080 --> 3:44:44.080]  and I went to those and it was cops just pulling up
[3:44:44.080 --> 3:44:46.080]  and somebody was
[3:44:46.080 --> 3:44:48.080]  Ron Paul sound on the street corner going
[3:44:48.080 --> 3:44:50.080]  to do that and you guys were like
[3:44:50.080 --> 3:44:52.080]  but I have a first amendment no you don't
[3:44:52.080 --> 3:44:54.080]  you got a first amendment to talk in your house but not here
[3:44:54.080 --> 3:44:56.080]  just like you got a second amendment
[3:44:56.080 --> 3:44:58.080]  right to have a gun in your house but I see you with a gun out here on the street
[3:44:58.080 --> 3:45:00.080]  you're not allowed to have one in public
[3:45:00.080 --> 3:45:02.080]  by the way I looked up Wisconsin law you are
[3:45:02.080 --> 3:45:04.080]  he said I'll arrest you
[3:45:04.080 --> 3:45:06.080]  he goes I'm allowed to have a gun out here
[3:45:06.080 --> 3:45:08.080]  you piece of trash
[3:45:08.080 --> 3:45:10.080]  you unamerican cancer cell
[3:45:10.080 --> 3:45:12.080]  oh man you're sick
[3:45:12.080 --> 3:45:14.080]  it's land of the free home of the brave folks
[3:45:14.080 --> 3:45:16.080]  they're taking our basic conventions
[3:45:16.080 --> 3:45:18.080]  our basic cannons
[3:45:18.080 --> 3:45:20.080]  I mean this is bedrock these bastards attack
[3:45:20.080 --> 3:45:22.080]  and then they say we're bad
[3:45:22.080 --> 3:45:24.080]  they take kids to jail
[3:45:24.080 --> 3:45:26.080]  straight-A students the first time
[3:45:26.080 --> 3:45:28.080]  they lay their head down in class
[3:45:28.080 --> 3:45:30.080]  you're sick freaks
[3:45:34.080 --> 3:45:36.080]  and this religion
[3:45:36.080 --> 3:45:38.080]  of kissing governments butt
[3:45:38.080 --> 3:45:40.080]  and making excuses for you
[3:45:40.080 --> 3:45:44.080]  memo to corporate media anyone can fake
[3:45:46.080 --> 3:45:48.080]  and dress up as an Arab terrorist
[3:45:48.080 --> 3:45:50.080]  and fake an al-qaeda tape great story
[3:45:50.080 --> 3:45:52.080]  about how they're putting out more fake videos
[3:45:52.080 --> 3:45:54.080]  now the others are admitted to be fake
[3:45:54.080 --> 3:45:56.080]  now the media has put out stuff they admit has been fake later
[3:45:56.080 --> 3:45:58.080]  and then you got all these ADL
[3:45:58.080 --> 3:46:00.080]  top guys
[3:46:00.080 --> 3:46:02.080]  and CIA people caught putting them out
[3:46:02.080 --> 3:46:04.080]  I mean you understand they've been caught
[3:46:04.080 --> 3:46:06.080]  red-handed
[3:46:06.080 --> 3:46:08.080]  just like they've been caught running al-qaeda attacks when I ran
[3:46:08.080 --> 3:46:10.080]  and then saying I ran
[3:46:10.080 --> 3:46:12.080]  al-qaeda

[3:46:24.080 --> 3:46:26.080]  admitted here and then don't even charge the guy
[3:46:26.080 --> 3:46:28.080]  with statutory rape
[3:46:28.080 --> 3:46:30.080]  I love how they charge 17 18 year old men
[3:46:30.080 --> 3:46:32.080]  with statutory rape with their 15 year old
[3:46:32.080 --> 3:46:34.080]  girlfriends when every one of these cops
[3:46:34.080 --> 3:46:36.080]  I mean I bet 80% of them
[3:46:36.080 --> 3:46:38.080]  were 18 and had 16 year old girlfriends
[3:46:40.080 --> 3:46:42.080]  I mean how many of you out there cops
[3:46:42.080 --> 3:46:44.080]  had were 18
[3:46:44.080 --> 3:46:46.080]  and had a 16 year old girlfriend
[3:46:46.080 --> 3:46:48.080]  how many people had that
[3:46:50.080 --> 3:46:52.080]  I mean I had a girlfriend
[3:46:52.080 --> 3:46:54.080]  when I was 14
[3:46:54.080 --> 3:46:56.080]  who was 13 and then I was 18
[3:46:56.080 --> 3:46:58.080]  and she was 17
[3:46:58.080 --> 3:47:00.080]  statutory rape
[3:47:00.080 --> 3:47:02.080]  meanwhile
[3:47:02.080 --> 3:47:04.080]  she peed
[3:47:04.080 --> 3:47:06.080]  here's an example
[3:47:06.080 --> 3:47:08.080]  the texas
[3:47:08.080 --> 3:47:10.080]  youth commission
[3:47:10.080 --> 3:47:12.080]  it came out the texas ranger said
[3:47:12.080 --> 3:47:14.080]  who actually are pretty good guys
[3:47:14.080 --> 3:47:16.080]  because it's so
[3:47:16.080 --> 3:47:18.080]  elite that you know they tend to keep corruption out of it
[3:47:22.080 --> 3:47:24.080]  they reported that
[3:47:24.080 --> 3:47:26.080]  they were having
[3:47:26.080 --> 3:47:28.080]  you know where they had
[3:47:28.080 --> 3:47:30.080]  thousands of people 10 to age 13
[3:47:30.080 --> 3:47:32.080]  at this one facility but it was hundreds of examples
[3:47:32.080 --> 3:47:34.080]  they had all these cars coming in
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:36.080]  paying to come have sex with the children
[3:47:36.080 --> 3:47:38.080]  and no one went to jail for that
[3:47:38.080 --> 3:47:40.080]  they fired a couple thousand
[3:47:40.080 --> 3:47:42.080]  the government is just
[3:47:42.080 --> 3:47:44.080]  infested with scum
[3:47:44.080 --> 3:47:46.080]  and they were told to shut up
[3:47:46.080 --> 3:47:48.080]  the texas rangers had to leak that
[3:47:50.080 --> 3:47:52.080]  so see it's russian roulette
[3:47:52.080 --> 3:47:54.080]  every time I see a cop car I think
[3:47:54.080 --> 3:47:56.080]  is that a pedophile is that a criminal
[3:47:56.080 --> 3:47:58.080]  is that a nut or is it a normal guy
[3:47:58.080 --> 3:48:00.080]  and maybe only 20% of the time
[3:48:00.080 --> 3:48:02.080]  is it a nut but that's dangerous folks
[3:48:02.080 --> 3:48:04.080]  I don't I mean you know I mean

[3:54:20.080 --> 3:54:22.080]  the needle
[3:54:22.080 --> 3:54:24.080]  but now when I could burn myself or something
[3:54:24.080 --> 3:54:26.080]  I could totally turn it off
[3:54:26.080 --> 3:54:28.080]  it's like you know
[3:54:28.080 --> 3:54:30.080]  barbecue and burn my hand real bad
[3:54:30.080 --> 3:54:32.080]  it's so strange with the brain works
[3:54:32.080 --> 3:54:34.080]  all the way
[3:54:34.080 --> 3:54:36.080]  but I remember
[3:54:36.080 --> 3:54:38.080]  everything
[3:54:38.080 --> 3:54:40.080]  government green lights
[3:54:40.080 --> 3:54:42.080]  golf dollar abandonment
[3:54:42.080 --> 3:54:44.080]  what you can't turn off is a migraine

[3:54:48.080 --> 3:54:50.080]  I just can't stop babbling
[3:54:50.080 --> 3:54:52.080]  government green lights
[3:54:52.080 --> 3:54:54.080]  golf dollar abandonment
[3:54:54.080 --> 3:54:56.080]  a report from maryl lindgren co has revealed
[3:54:56.080 --> 3:54:58.080]  the government has effectively given
[3:54:58.080 --> 3:55:00.080]  oil producers the go ahead
[3:55:00.080 --> 3:55:02.080]  to change the dollar
[3:55:02.080 --> 3:55:04.080]  pegged foreign exchange
[3:55:04.080 --> 3:55:06.080]  policies a move some experts
[3:55:06.080 --> 3:55:08.080]  fear will lead to a
[3:55:08.080 --> 3:55:10.080]  large scale abandonment of
[3:55:10.080 --> 3:55:12.080]  the green back
[3:55:12.080 --> 3:55:14.080]  and that's by steve watson info wars
[3:55:14.080 --> 3:55:16.080]  net with link to Reuters I mean that's why you had

[3:55:24.080 --> 3:55:26.080]  but I thought we'd have a minority view on
[3:55:26.080 --> 3:55:28.080]  this may spur a similar move by the sautees
[3:55:28.080 --> 3:55:30.080]  sometime next year so there's
[3:55:30.080 --> 3:55:32.080]  that santonio cops force blood

[3:56:10.080 --> 3:56:12.080]  and treasonous for saying what anyone who has
[3:56:12.080 --> 3:56:14.080]  half a brain israel admits they've got
[3:56:14.080 --> 3:56:16.080]  hundreds and hundreds of nukes and nuclear
[3:56:16.080 --> 3:56:18.080]  submarines and bombers and
[3:56:18.080 --> 3:56:20.080]  cruise missiles and carter said it's
[3:56:20.080 --> 3:56:22.080]  ridiculous to attack iran when they have
[3:56:22.080 --> 3:56:24.080]  no nukes but israel can have nukes
[3:56:24.080 --> 3:56:26.080]  and in fox news just freaks out
