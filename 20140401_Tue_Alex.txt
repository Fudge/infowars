[00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:06.111]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:07.872]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:09.633]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:11.233]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:12.774]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.774 --> 00:00:16.976]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:21.077]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:43.724]  Well, April Fools, ladies and gentlemen, and the joke is on all of us.
[00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:55.470]  Obamacare, ladies and gentlemen, your time has come and gone to register, to sign up so the IRS can grab your bank account, levy your wages, and put penalties and interest on you.
[00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.572]  We've had multiple members of our crew try to go sign up for Obamacare as a test.
[00:00:59.572 --> 00:01:03.634]  We're going to have Joe in here later, one of the engineers, and it was impossible.
[00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:05.655]  And he's very internet savvy.
[00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:20.948]  As they say, it is a complete and total fraud, but lest it be one-sided, I will open the phones up today for supporters of Obamacare to call in on the broadcast and give us their take on everything.
[00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:27.401]  Scooting over here to get my guest folder.
[00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:29.763]  I always forget to move over here.
[00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:39.450]  We have Dick Gregory joining us coming up in the third hour today to give us his take on Lord Obama, the state of the world, and so much more.
[00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:49.599]  Famed civil rights activist Dick Gregory will be joining us coming up in the third hour and we will take your calls for Mr. Gregory as well.
[00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:53.301]  So that is coming up today.
[00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:56.663]  Of course, never mind the fact that Obamacare is not broken.
[00:01:56.663 --> 00:01:58.324]  The war on drugs is not broken.
[00:01:58.324 --> 00:02:01.226]  The war on illiteracy is not broken.
[00:02:01.226 --> 00:02:06.089]  It is designed to ship in more drugs and keep them illegal to keep the prices up.
[00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:07.129]  That's the war on drugs.
[00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:08.210]  The war on illiteracy.
[00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:11.181]  is designed to dumb people down.
[00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:11.921]  They've done a great job.
[00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:15.602]  They teach 2 plus 2 equals 5 in public school now.
[00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:17.763]  That tells you everything you need to know.
[00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:22.003]  That's not some Kurt Vonnegut, Grand Falloon joke.
[00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:23.344]  That is real.
[00:02:23.344 --> 00:02:24.184]  That is happening.
[00:02:24.184 --> 00:02:31.505]  That's all you need to know is that this government run by these social engineers wants your children to believe 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:34.946]  Or if the answer is 300, you say 200 because that's more friendly.
[00:02:34.946 --> 00:02:37.507]  And you're like, what does that even mean?
[00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:39.427]  Well, a number that's too high is kind of uppity.
[00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:47.217]  It's total disinformation programming to destroy logic being pumped in.
[00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:48.438]  There it is, the Daily Caller.
[00:02:48.438 --> 00:02:53.701]  The Common Core math problem asked kids to write the friendly answer instead of the correct one.
[00:02:53.701 --> 00:03:01.345]  The second graders' answers to Common Core Aligned Math Worksheet were marked as incorrect because they weren't friendly enough, even though they were the right answers.
[00:03:01.345 --> 00:03:03.247]  I mean, I'm not making that up.
[00:03:08.177 --> 00:03:14.259]  You say this stuff and you laugh because it's so hardcore.
[00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:15.139]  They're not failing.
[00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:22.702]  They've done this country down from the highest test scores 50 years ago to the lowest in the industrialized world and behind a whole bunch of third world countries.
[00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:31.105]  They've got the most drugs on the streets of any country per capita in the world, the biggest prison population, the highest cancer rate.
[00:03:31.105 --> 00:03:35.086]  They've taken everything that was good about this country and have tried to turn it on its head.
[00:03:35.086 --> 00:03:37.267]  They are involved in total war against society.
[00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:45.114]  But none of that matters, because here's the article up on Infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:03:45.114 --> 00:03:50.936]  Some Obama supporters still think it's racist to oppose Obamacare.
[00:03:50.936 --> 00:03:52.997]  And we actually have the tweets.
[00:03:52.997 --> 00:03:54.937]  F. Bill O'Reilly.
[00:03:54.937 --> 00:03:56.858]  I can't read the rest of it.
[00:03:56.858 --> 00:04:00.219]  I saw a pic with him saying something about Obamacare.
[00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.181]  It's obvious he's racist, rednecked, shriveled up ass.
[00:04:06.653 --> 00:04:10.375]  I mean, Bill O'Reilly is a total establishment type.
[00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.477]  I wouldn't even call him a conservative.
[00:04:12.477 --> 00:04:20.122]  He's more like a mainline fake populist who's constantly doing horrible things to me on air.
[00:04:20.122 --> 00:04:24.245]  But the point is, is that he's not a shriveled redneck.
[00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:31.169]  And I don't think he ever went out and got a suntan his life on the back of his neck working outside.
[00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.691]  Why is it so racist against white people if they have a tan?
[00:04:35.615 --> 00:04:36.636]  Meaning they work outside.
[00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:37.896]  I mean, are we not allowed to work outside?
[00:04:37.896 --> 00:04:39.417]  I love a tan.
[00:04:39.417 --> 00:04:42.458]  I mean, I can get darker than most Mexicans I know.
[00:04:42.458 --> 00:04:45.280]  Is there something wrong with that?
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.302]  Anyways, we're going to come back, ladies and gentlemen, and go into more of these because they are hilarious.
[00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:53.203]  But these people are serious, man.
[00:04:53.203 --> 00:04:56.425]  They think if you don't like to screwjob Obama, it's because he's black.
[00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.331]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:05:02.331 --> 00:05:05.974]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:05:05.974 --> 00:05:10.497]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:05:10.497 --> 00:05:16.621]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:27.628]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:05:27.628 --> 00:05:30.250]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gate.
[00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.112]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code water.
[00:05:34.112 --> 00:05:51.424]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia, and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:05:51.424 --> 00:05:56.727]  Get your ProPure with a new Pro1 filter today at InfoWareStore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:02.911]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[00:06:02.911 --> 00:06:08.053]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:06:08.053 --> 00:06:16.158]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:06:16.158 --> 00:06:20.700]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.502]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:06:24.662 --> 00:06:30.606]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:33.768]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:39.151]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from My Patriot Supply.
[00:06:39.151 --> 00:06:47.337]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com forward slash alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[00:06:47.337 --> 00:06:47.517]  That's 866-229-0927.
[00:06:54.201 --> 00:07:09.977]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than a decade.
[00:07:10.177 --> 00:07:17.259]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:22.140]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:28.922]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:07:28.922 --> 00:07:36.104]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:07:36.104 --> 00:07:37.824]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[00:07:38.004 --> 00:07:43.126]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:07:43.126 --> 00:07:47.608]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:07:47.608 --> 00:07:51.009]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:57.312]  You will be supporting a free press, all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[00:07:57.312 --> 00:07:58.993]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:08:00.859 --> 00:08:02.380]  Zack, this is Crystal Palace.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:02.540]  Inc.
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.120]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.341]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:09.863]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:08:09.863 --> 00:08:14.325]  The Whopper spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[00:08:14.325 --> 00:08:15.825]  Target selection complete.
[00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:17.706]  Time on target sequence complete.
[00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:24.669]  22 Type 1 Class Submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkapp, bearing 095 degrees.
[00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:29.651]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan Air Defense Zone.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.743]  From the front lines of the Information War.
[00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:37.145]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[00:08:37.145 --> 00:08:38.746]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:43.410]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.351]  You bet!
[00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:48.654]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:51.636]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[00:08:51.636 --> 00:08:57.061]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:59.202]  Shall we play a game?
[00:08:59.202 --> 00:08:59.743]  No doubt.
[00:09:05.051 --> 00:09:09.914]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:09.914 --> 00:09:12.195]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[00:09:12.195 --> 00:09:13.056]  Awaiting launch codes.
[00:09:13.056 --> 00:09:15.417]  We are on a launch mode.
[00:09:15.417 --> 00:09:19.320]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.703]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:09:23.703 --> 00:09:25.203]  We're in!
[00:09:25.203 --> 00:09:26.965]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:29.086]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[00:09:29.505 --> 00:09:31.567]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[00:09:31.567 --> 00:09:32.988]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[00:09:43.081 --> 00:09:47.122]  Everything is an April Fool's for the globalists that run this planet.
[00:09:47.122 --> 00:09:48.643]  The Federal Reserve is not federal.
[00:09:48.643 --> 00:10:11.510]  It's a private front group for a consortium of six megabanks, publicly, that set it up in 1913 to establish the Federal Reserve that same year, that same week, to fund the system and defund the federal government, making it a bankrupt institution, moving us towards the War Powers Act in 1933, and the Declaration of Martial Law, and the United States going into receivership ever since then.
[00:10:12.369 --> 00:10:14.691]  The New World Order's not coming, it's been here for a while.
[00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:18.515]  We're just getting deeper into the swamp, as they say.
[00:10:18.515 --> 00:10:25.421]  There's the hoax of the drug war, where they ship the drugs in to launder the money, and more drugs come in, more people go to prison, largest prison population in the world.
[00:10:25.421 --> 00:10:32.327]  There's the hoax of illiteracy, and the war on illiteracy that's designed to teach kids 2 plus 2 equals 5, as I was saying earlier.
[00:10:33.408 --> 00:10:35.449]  There's the hoax the Russians attacked Georgia in 2008.
[00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:43.993]  There's the hoax that the Russians have been invading Ukraine when the West overthrew the Ukrainian government, took 93% of the country.
[00:10:43.993 --> 00:10:48.775]  The Russians just grabbed their military bases and pipelines on their border.
[00:10:48.775 --> 00:10:54.078]  But you watch our controlled media, you'd think the Russians are mashing troops and invading.
[00:10:54.078 --> 00:10:58.500]  And if they keep mashing NATO forces in Ukraine, the Russians may come in.
[00:11:01.428 --> 00:11:05.971]  And the globalists just love that because that's an even bigger political diversion for them.
[00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:14.716]  Just like they're funding Al-Qaeda all over the world to run around and engage in all sorts of terror attacks and destabilization because they get to spend trillions then fighting them.
[00:11:16.257 --> 00:11:17.357]  Of course, they don't really fight them.
[00:11:17.357 --> 00:11:19.038]  Oh, we're not going to go to Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:19.038 --> 00:11:26.181]  We're going to go to Iraq and invade you and overthrow you because you're the archenemy of Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia.
[00:11:26.181 --> 00:11:38.906]  And then we're going to bring Al Qaeda in and put them in charge of half the country, as they've now done, and put burqas on women's heads and turn off the movie theaters and the rock and roll stations and get rid of the swimming pools.
[00:11:38.906 --> 00:11:44.808]  Iraq is conservatively, I don't know, I've seen mainline secular think tanks say it's five times worse.
[00:11:46.468 --> 00:11:50.351]  And is now a jihadi paradise?
[00:11:50.351 --> 00:11:53.753]  Why they're even starting the sexual mutilations of the women there.
[00:11:53.753 --> 00:11:55.234]  Same thing in Libya.
[00:11:55.234 --> 00:12:08.703]  They tried to take over Egypt in the last three years, but the government, the military didn't put up with that, so they didn't put up with the public crucifixions of Christians and blowing up of churches daily.
[00:12:09.748 --> 00:12:13.590]  And non-radical Muslim mosques, so the military stood up to them.
[00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.592]  Not even saying the military's good, it's just compared to Al-Qaeda they're good.
[00:12:16.592 --> 00:12:22.695]  I mean, this is the type of craziness that's going on, and it's all a giant hoax.
[00:12:22.695 --> 00:12:29.778]  The Gardasil shot in the trials eight years ago killed a bunch of people that took it.
[00:12:29.778 --> 00:12:33.480]  Then Rick Perry came out and said it's the law to take Gardasil.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.060]  Remember that in 2008?
[00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:37.123]  Was it 2007?
[00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.484]  There was no law.
[00:12:38.484 --> 00:12:44.968]  Everybody said, well, it's the law, the governor says, and they went out and got the shot and had autoimmune disorders, death, you name it.
[00:12:44.968 --> 00:12:46.709]  We were on air saying it's going to kill people.
[00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:49.811]  It's going to cause people to be paralyzed.
[00:12:49.811 --> 00:12:56.355]  Its main operation is to attack the female reproductive organs, the ovaries.
[00:12:58.114 --> 00:13:00.135]  The equivalent of the female testicles.
[00:13:00.135 --> 00:13:11.684]  Of course now, lo and behold, who would have known Gardasil basically attacks and creates autoimmune inflammation causing cancers in the ovaries.
[00:13:11.684 --> 00:13:15.587]  Oh my goodness, now mainline medical literature banned in Japan.
[00:13:17.637 --> 00:13:22.780]  You're banned in India, being banned in areas of Europe, and you're going, Alex, where are you going with all this?
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:23.740]  It's hoaxes.
[00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:24.761]  It's hoaxes.
[00:13:24.761 --> 00:13:25.842]  It's hoaxes.
[00:13:25.842 --> 00:13:37.288]  The Gardasil shot said it only protected you from four different papilloma strains when there's thousands, and you only have 3,000 papilloma deaths a year in the U.S.
[00:13:37.288 --> 00:13:39.369]  out of 315 million folks.
[00:13:39.369 --> 00:13:42.711]  It's one of the rarest cancers out there.
[00:13:42.711 --> 00:13:43.231]  Now, there it is.
[00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:46.273]  Merck researcher admits Gardasil guards against nothing.
[00:13:47.256 --> 00:13:48.877]  Almost nothing.
[00:13:48.877 --> 00:13:50.197]  Read the literature.
[00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:51.378]  Read the stinking insert.
[00:13:51.378 --> 00:13:53.138]  That's what I mean.
[00:13:53.138 --> 00:14:03.102]  I have parents come to me on the street and they go, Alex, we've been listening to you for years, but we just, we just went to the school and they told us you're lying and we're really surprised in you.
[00:14:03.102 --> 00:14:08.724]  And, uh, you know, there is a law that our sons and daughters have to take all the vaccines to go to school.
[00:14:08.724 --> 00:14:10.865]  And if we don't, the police come for truancy.
[00:14:10.865 --> 00:14:14.607]  And I look at them and I say, there is no state in the country
[00:14:15.523 --> 00:14:23.229]  But California and New York, where they can claim they have mandatory inoculations, and even there it's a fraud.
[00:14:23.229 --> 00:14:28.514]  And they say, but the school tells us that's not the case.
[00:14:28.514 --> 00:14:37.461]  And I say, listen, it's federal and state law that they have to have a waiver from, quote, policy under state health department rules.
[00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:39.843]  It's a policy to say they want you to
[00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:42.969]  Have all these vaccines.
[00:14:42.969 --> 00:14:43.690]  It's a policy.
[00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.831]  You have to have these vaccines to go to a college.
[00:14:46.831 --> 00:14:48.652]  They lie and tell you it's mandatory.
[00:14:48.652 --> 00:14:53.354]  Then they kick you out of the public school, triggering truancy.
[00:14:53.354 --> 00:14:57.115]  Then they call the police who fraudulently apply the
[00:15:00.307 --> 00:15:04.191]  Truancy, when the truancy isn't truancy if you were kicked out of school.
[00:15:04.191 --> 00:15:05.793]  Do you understand that?
[00:15:05.793 --> 00:15:09.337]  But the family court judges, the police, they all play along with it.
[00:15:09.337 --> 00:15:11.038]  Most of the police are just ignorant of it.
[00:15:11.038 --> 00:15:11.739]  Just like the public.
[00:15:11.739 --> 00:15:13.241]  Do you understand?
[00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:16.206]  And they lie and they go, there is no waiver.
[00:15:16.206 --> 00:15:22.870]  There is a waiver in the nurse's office and in the principal's office and the assistant principal's office.
[00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:39.780]  And if you simply go to the online website of the state health department of Connecticut or Texas or Missouri or California or any other state, there are the forms where you simply tell them for religious or other reasons why you're not doing it or doctor.
[00:15:41.049 --> 00:15:44.850]  But it's a waiver for something that isn't even a law, so that's a fraud.
[00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:50.651]  It's kind of like getting a concealed carry to carry a concealed handgun when you could just carry it openly in almost every state under law.
[00:15:50.651 --> 00:15:52.331]  It's turning a right into a privilege.
[00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:53.432]  But the point is, they lie to you.
[00:15:53.432 --> 00:15:54.412]  It's a hoax.
[00:15:54.412 --> 00:16:01.173]  Every year on every news channel of state-run media and print, all the local whore papers, they say, it's the law.
[00:16:01.173 --> 00:16:05.454]  This August at Zilker Park, a free inoculation in Austin.
[00:16:05.454 --> 00:16:08.635]  Change Zilker Park to your city park or your city gymnasium.
[00:16:09.255 --> 00:16:12.518]  And the kids show up by the thousands and get the mandatory shots.
[00:16:12.518 --> 00:16:17.823]  They have ambulances there because some collapse, some have convulsions on the spot, some die on the spot.
[00:16:17.823 --> 00:16:25.890]  But that's all a cost-benefit analysis, as one health department official told me, who's over the state actuary here in Texas.
[00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:29.494]  He hikes the same place I do with his girlfriend who also works at the state health department.
[00:16:30.247 --> 00:16:37.609]  And he said they listen to the show and know that vaccines are killing people, but that it's just going to continue because it saves more people than it hurts.
[00:16:37.609 --> 00:16:41.410]  And I began to argue with him on those numbers, but there I was.
[00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:43.330]  He said, this is all off record.
[00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:49.772]  You can say I work in the state in this, but you know, just don't say my name.
[00:16:49.772 --> 00:16:53.133]  In fact, he even let me videotape it so I could look up the stuff he was telling me.
[00:16:53.133 --> 00:16:54.513]  I even had that on my iPhone.
[00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:56.594]  It's about three months ago.
[00:16:56.594 --> 00:17:00.196]  The point is, is that, you know, him and his girlfriend both work at the health department.
[00:17:00.196 --> 00:17:01.197]  He's one of the top people.
[00:17:01.197 --> 00:17:03.839]  In fact, I'm not going to say exactly what he is.
[00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:04.839]  He is the head of something.
[00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:05.980]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:09.742]  I looked him up, sure enough, and he was there admitting it to me.
[00:17:09.742 --> 00:17:16.707]  And it's so frustrating that they will tell you there are no side effects and it's the law, you got to take it.
[00:17:16.707 --> 00:17:17.988]  And there is no law.
[00:17:17.988 --> 00:17:23.832]  And the insert sheet that comes with the vaccine reads like a horror movie.
[00:17:24.827 --> 00:17:26.288]  Now, here's what I want to do today.
[00:17:26.288 --> 00:17:29.950]  I want to come back and cover the latest on Obamacare and the April Fools.
[00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:31.270]  There will be no April Fools here.
[00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.311]  We're all April Fools under this new world order.
[00:17:33.311 --> 00:17:38.574]  And then I want to get your stories of what you think are major hoaxes.
[00:17:38.574 --> 00:17:40.515]  Patriot Act is called patriotic.
[00:17:40.515 --> 00:17:41.835]  It's the opposite of patriotism.
[00:17:41.835 --> 00:17:47.178]  It destroys our Bill of Rights and Constitution, eviscerates 7 of the 10 First Amendments on record.
[00:17:49.963 --> 00:17:55.664]  Now if you expand on that, you got the New Freedom Initiative, the drug half the kids in the schools calling it New Freedom.
[00:17:55.664 --> 00:17:58.265]  You've got the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act.
[00:17:58.265 --> 00:18:03.906]  It doesn't protect the patient's data, lets it become public, shares it with all these private and corporate groups.
[00:18:03.906 --> 00:18:16.409]  It isn't affordable, it's all a sick joke, written by ruthless insurance companies as a open corporate tax ruled by the Supreme Court to predominantly offshore tax-exempt groups like Warren Buffett.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:21.455]  Who runs around lobbying for big government all day because he gets the corporate welfare out of it.
[00:18:24.659 --> 00:18:29.442]  But again, it's all just hoaxes, hoaxes, hoaxes, hoaxes, hoaxes.
[00:18:29.442 --> 00:18:31.724]  GMO crops, total hoax.
[00:18:31.724 --> 00:18:39.069]  Farmers that use it in most cases turn out telling you it ruins their productivity and ruins their fields and ends up bankrupting them and Monsanto changes all the rules.
[00:18:39.069 --> 00:18:40.671]  I mean, it's all a hoax.
[00:18:40.671 --> 00:18:42.252]  Carbon taxes, a hoax.
[00:18:42.252 --> 00:18:46.154]  Smart meters are not smart, they're spy meters, a hoax.
[00:18:46.154 --> 00:18:47.916]  The global warming movement, a hoax.
[00:18:49.562 --> 00:18:53.103]  Obama and all of his energy programs, a hoax.
[00:18:53.103 --> 00:18:55.284]  Obama saying he wouldn't come out with the guns, a hoax.
[00:18:55.284 --> 00:18:57.584]  Obama saying he wouldn't hire lobbyists, a hoax.
[00:18:57.584 --> 00:19:00.825]  Obama saying he wouldn't have signing statements, a hoax.
[00:19:00.825 --> 00:19:05.327]  Obama saying he would try to stop racism, all he does is promote it, a hoax.
[00:19:05.327 --> 00:19:06.607]  A hoax, a hoax, a hoax.
[00:19:06.607 --> 00:19:11.949]  Welcome to Planet Hoax on April 1st.
[00:19:11.949 --> 00:19:18.491]  And almost everyone's seeing their premiums go up, and Sebelius gets asked about it, and she says, I have no comment, I don't care.
[00:19:19.172 --> 00:19:26.076]  So we're going to play that clip coming up, but I don't want to just talk about your experiences with Obamacare, or if you're a supporter with it, or if you love it.
[00:19:26.076 --> 00:19:30.878]  Maybe you're a seminar caller from the Democrats you want to call in, it'll be interesting to hear what you have to say.
[00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:33.480]  Not just the Obama issue, what about hoaxes?
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.461]  Things that you think are hoaxes out there.
[00:19:35.461 --> 00:19:36.701]  Toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:19:41.343 --> 00:19:42.044]  First-time callers.
[00:19:42.044 --> 00:19:46.128]  I want to mention that, because when we don't say first-time callers, we get a lot of the seminar callers.
[00:19:46.128 --> 00:19:47.109]  The point is, is that 800-259-9231.
[00:19:47.109 --> 00:19:48.611]  That's trained political callers.
[00:19:48.611 --> 00:19:48.671]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:48.671 --> 00:19:52.655]  We're going to hear from you on, do you think this is planet hoax, or is Obama our Lord and Savior?
[00:20:00.279 --> 00:20:05.623]  Did you know Emergency Essentials has a lowest price promise on all of their long-term food storage and emergency supplies?

[00:20:17.253 --> 00:20:20.295]  It's taken for granted that bottled water and even home filtered water is pure.
[00:20:36.707 --> 00:20:39.189]  But it is not the purest water you can drink.
[00:20:39.189 --> 00:20:41.812]  There is only one way to get the purest water.
[00:20:41.812 --> 00:20:45.335]  And that's with a new appliance that no healthy kitchen should be without.
[00:20:45.335 --> 00:20:48.337]  An H2O Labs countertop home water system.

[00:22:02.085 --> 00:22:07.206]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[00:22:07.206 --> 00:22:15.327]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[00:22:15.327 --> 00:22:19.848]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[00:22:19.848 --> 00:22:23.649]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:29.776]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[00:22:29.776 --> 00:22:32.939]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[00:22:32.939 --> 00:22:38.085]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from my Patriot Supply.

[00:23:56.314 --> 00:23:57.695]  That's unseennow.com.
[00:24:00.602 --> 00:24:05.786]  Alright, your phone calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:05.786 --> 00:24:09.489]  If you just joined us, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:37.858]  Here is an article out of the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine, mandatory school vaccinations, the role of tort law.
[00:24:37.858 --> 00:24:56.694]  And it goes on to say, since it is unlikely that state governments will eliminate such exemptions outright, society must consider other methods of providing incentives for vaccination and compensating those who have suffered due to the disease outbreak caused by a community loss of herd immunity.
[00:24:58.507 --> 00:25:08.556]  You know, I love how they claim that they've lost herd immunity because everyone's not taking the vaccine.
[00:25:08.556 --> 00:25:15.022]  I thought the vaccine was protecting you, so how, if I don't take it, do you get sick?
[00:25:17.188 --> 00:25:32.958]  In fact, in the last few days I saw multiple mainstream news articles on InfoWars.com, linking to studies, in fact we'll pull some of these up, you can pull them up, where the people that get the measles, mumps and rubella are the ones that take the shot.
[00:25:32.958 --> 00:25:39.002]  The people that are getting the whooping cough in California are the ones that take the shot.
[00:25:39.002 --> 00:25:43.385]  There it is, 90% of those infected with measles in New York outbreak are vaccinated.
[00:25:44.304 --> 00:25:48.406]  And if you link through, they have links in the bottom of the article, local news.
[00:25:48.406 --> 00:25:52.229]  This is the type of stuff we're dealing with.
[00:25:52.229 --> 00:26:05.176]  And again, I'm not saying that learned immunity, that inoculations can't actually work.
[00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:25.883]  It's that you cannot trust a eugenics-based global government that's obsessed with secret experimentation and who's been caught adding everything you can imagine under the sun to mainline vaccines and you see disease levels actually going up in places like Africa and Asia where they give them, say, the polio vaccine.
[00:26:25.883 --> 00:26:28.305]  And they don't call it polio when they get paralyzed.
[00:26:28.305 --> 00:26:31.407]  Sixty-something thousand at a pop in India.
[00:26:31.407 --> 00:26:33.068]  But they admit it's caused by the vaccine.
[00:26:33.068 --> 00:26:34.610]  I mean, this is scandalous!
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.191]  Our whole way of life is being ended because of the hoax of terrorism.
[00:26:39.191 --> 00:26:42.301]  Whether you believe it's real or orchestrated, it doesn't matter.
[00:26:43.712 --> 00:26:47.776]  You've got a better chance of deer jumping out in front of your car and killing you than being killed by a terrorist.
[00:26:47.776 --> 00:26:51.140]  So how is our whole world, our whole way of life being changed?
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:27:02.993]  Our whole Bill of Rights, Constitution, checks and balances being erased in the name of protecting us with a kleptocratic, militarized government lecturing us how our liberty is to blame for our problems.
[00:27:02.993 --> 00:27:05.596]  No, our liberty was to blame for our prosperity.
[00:27:06.573 --> 00:27:11.826]  And we became decadent and now we've been overrun by criminals and social engineers.
[00:27:11.826 --> 00:27:15.415]  We've got a lot of people in the mid and lower levels that are very good people.
[00:27:17.108 --> 00:27:20.530]  Who are very good people who actually mean well.
[00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:27.154]  And that's the only reason we've been able to hold back a lot of this new world order is because we've been fighting it.
[00:27:27.154 --> 00:27:29.515]  We've been on the front lines warning people.
[00:27:29.515 --> 00:27:30.636]  So that's the good news.
[00:27:30.636 --> 00:27:34.098]  Folks are waking up to what I call planet hoax.
[00:27:34.098 --> 00:27:36.719]  That was the issue of the magazine.
[00:27:41.178 --> 00:27:45.219]  that came out last month, or came out last year.
[00:27:45.219 --> 00:27:50.140]  Last April's edition, 2013, was Welcome to Planet Hoax.
[00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:51.881]  I can't believe how fast time is moving.
[00:27:51.881 --> 00:27:54.302]  Some of this magazine just came out.
[00:27:54.302 --> 00:27:58.003]  And in this magazine we expose a bunch of hoaxes and a bunch of lies.
[00:27:58.003 --> 00:27:59.483]  So again, I want to hear from you.
[00:27:59.483 --> 00:28:01.263]  What do you see as a hoax?
[00:28:01.263 --> 00:28:06.545]  Is there anything the government and big corporations aren't putting out that isn't a hoax?
[00:28:06.545 --> 00:28:08.725]  Is there anything they don't push that isn't a fraud?
[00:28:08.725 --> 00:28:09.966]  I mean, what about the hoax of
[00:28:11.241 --> 00:28:15.886]  Warren Buffett is a figurehead, or the head of General Electric is a figurehead, but they all do it.
[00:28:15.886 --> 00:28:18.229]  The entire Fortune 100.
[00:28:18.229 --> 00:28:20.171]  To a man.
[00:28:20.171 --> 00:28:25.796]  Except for maybe the Koch brothers, and that's why they're so demonized, and I'm not romanticizing them, they funded Bill Clinton.
[00:28:26.479 --> 00:28:31.460]  But the Koch brothers do not try to lobby for higher taxes on poor people.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.820]  And that's their ultimate sin.
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:38.521]  That's why they're the cause Celeb to attack and hate, and they're the only elite so-called liberals know the name of.
[00:28:38.521 --> 00:28:44.002]  When they're mid-level at most, a private family, with, I don't know, $15 billion or something.
[00:28:44.002 --> 00:28:44.882]  Sounds like a lot?
[00:28:44.882 --> 00:28:52.304]  Bill and Melinda Gates have put $100 billion tax-free into their governmental institutions that they control to take over society and get corporate welfare.
[00:28:53.203 --> 00:28:54.925]  Bill and Melinda Gates are all tax-free folks.
[00:28:54.925 --> 00:28:57.567]  They're not giving the money, they're making their money tax-free.
[00:28:57.567 --> 00:29:00.230]  But, continuing, talk about a big hoax.
[00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:09.198]  Warren Buffett is the biggest recipient of the trillions and trillions in banker bailout since 2008, and he's the number one pusher.
[00:29:09.198 --> 00:29:10.559]  Every time I turn television on,
[00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:14.019]  Rich people don't pay taxes.
[00:29:14.019 --> 00:29:16.201]  Why, look at all these colleagues of mine.
[00:29:16.201 --> 00:29:17.783]  They're tax exempt.
[00:29:17.783 --> 00:29:19.745]  Why, my secretary pays more.
[00:29:19.745 --> 00:29:21.747]  I want to pay more.
[00:29:21.747 --> 00:29:26.833]  He just wants to raise taxes on the middle class to eradicate you to transfer your money to him.
[00:29:26.833 --> 00:29:29.576]  While he runs Dairy Queen to poison poor people on the countryside.
[00:29:29.576 --> 00:29:32.800]  The worst fast food on the planet.
[00:29:34.158 --> 00:29:39.764]  While his Wells Fargo is one of the biggest money laundering banks in the world, on record and above the law, and doesn't get in trouble.
[00:29:39.764 --> 00:29:42.046]  But it's okay, he's a nice old man.
[00:29:42.046 --> 00:29:44.869]  Buffett, champion of bailout, is also a leading beneficiary.
[00:29:44.869 --> 00:29:45.349]  McClatchy.
[00:29:45.349 --> 00:29:49.514]  We're gonna come back with more hoaxes, the latest on Obamacare, your calls.
[00:29:49.514 --> 00:29:53.438]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.438 --> 00:29:56.101]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.311]  The facts are in.
[00:30:01.311 --> 00:30:02.712]  The studies are legion.
[00:30:02.712 --> 00:30:10.238]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[00:30:10.238 --> 00:30:14.062]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:14.622]  Simple.
[00:30:14.622 --> 00:30:18.966]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[00:30:19.346 --> 00:30:25.071]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[00:30:25.071 --> 00:30:41.065]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[00:30:41.385 --> 00:30:45.966]  Let's take a stand against the Globalist by blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[00:30:45.966 --> 00:30:48.127]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[00:30:48.127 --> 00:30:53.689]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[00:30:53.689 --> 00:30:58.090]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:59.371]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:31:00.311 --> 00:31:03.653]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:06.075]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[00:31:06.075 --> 00:31:14.681]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[00:31:14.681 --> 00:31:29.991]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum
[00:31:30.251 --> 00:31:30.751]  I'm good.
[00:32:00.311 --> 00:32:02.212]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:32:02.212 --> 00:32:05.854]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:32:05.854 --> 00:32:10.376]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:32:10.376 --> 00:32:16.498]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:32:16.498 --> 00:32:27.283]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:32:27.483 --> 00:32:30.344]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!

[00:33:29.191 --> 00:33:35.152]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:35.152 --> 00:33:35.613]  Thank God.
[00:33:35.613 --> 00:33:40.033]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:33:40.033 --> 00:33:45.174]  Sweet, sweet Connie!
[00:33:50.164 --> 00:34:06.408]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this April 1st, 2014 global transmission.
[00:34:06.408 --> 00:34:09.328]  Your phone calls are coming up in a few minutes.
[00:34:09.328 --> 00:34:12.089]  I start talking about hoaxes by the establishment.
[00:34:12.089 --> 00:34:16.870]  That's why they want to teach you 2 plus 2 equals 5 in public schools nationwide.
[00:34:18.536 --> 00:34:22.341]  Or that a brown bag is racist.
[00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:34.338]  Because the globalists are discriminating against all of us, signing us on to 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives that they created as a fraud to bankrupt civilization and sign it over to themselves.
[00:34:34.338 --> 00:34:35.180]  That's a giant hoax.
[00:34:37.947 --> 00:34:41.968]  But if you know how to say 2 plus 2 equals 4, that is freedom.
[00:34:41.968 --> 00:34:45.749]  And I'm quoting Eric Blair, aka George Orwell.
[00:34:45.749 --> 00:34:47.329]  Can we pull up the actual quote from 1984?
[00:34:47.329 --> 00:34:53.430]  Just type in 1984 quote, freedom is the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:34:53.430 --> 00:35:05.893]  And he goes on to say, because if you can do that, if you can reason, and if your mind allows you to know that, when BB, Big Brother, is telling you otherwise, you're free.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:13.769]  And of course O'Brien tortures him for a few months and to the point of Winston can no longer tell 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:35:13.769 --> 00:35:15.330]  It's like going to an Obama supporter.
[00:35:16.266 --> 00:35:27.891]  And saying, you know, the Republican leadership with the Democrats wrote this for foreign insurance companies owned by big banks as a foreign direct tax, just like third world countries have to pay money to the IMF and World Bank.
[00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:39.155]  This is a direct siphon to them to get 100 trillion in new liquidity off of health care taxes and off of wellhead taxes, money transfer taxes and carbon taxes.
[00:35:39.155 --> 00:35:40.656]  Here is the Davos Switzerland plan.
[00:35:43.174 --> 00:35:45.455]  And they just look at you and say, shut up racist.
[00:35:45.455 --> 00:35:52.339]  Because it's much easier to say 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:35:52.339 --> 00:35:57.702]  And I didn't know that Victor Hugo began to talk about 2 plus 2 equals 4 is freedom and that Orwell was quoting.
[00:35:57.702 --> 00:35:58.642]  Will you print me that whole page?
[00:35:58.642 --> 00:36:01.524]  I didn't know there was an entire Wikipedia page about 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:36:02.961 --> 00:36:04.642]  I didn't even realize.
[00:36:04.642 --> 00:36:05.783]  So, what do they do?
[00:36:05.783 --> 00:36:07.384]  The sickest joke in the world.
[00:36:07.384 --> 00:36:21.514]  If they can make you sit there and have your children taught 2 plus 2 equals 5, which is official curriculum from C to Shining C. From C to Shining C.
[00:36:21.514 --> 00:36:30.821]  2 plus 2 equals 5 and this is the insanity we face.
[00:36:35.014 --> 00:36:37.315]  Yeah, you guys just print me the quote from 1984.
[00:36:37.315 --> 00:36:43.498]  2 plus 2... The ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4 is freedom.
[00:36:43.498 --> 00:36:48.701]  There it is.
[00:36:48.701 --> 00:36:53.343]  Alright, continuing, folks, here with the news.
[00:36:53.343 --> 00:36:57.465]  We're looking at hoaxes.
[00:36:57.465 --> 00:36:59.246]  We're looking at how do you battle a hoax.
[00:37:00.427 --> 00:37:03.309]  What are the big hoaxes and what's your take on Obamacare?
[00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:12.974]  And then I've got a bunch of other news as well, and Dick Gregory, the civil rights activist, is going to be joining us to talk about the entire waterfront in the third hour.
[00:37:12.974 --> 00:37:25.862]  Continuing with the entire Obamacare situation, that is now expanding across the country to everyone's horror.
[00:37:27.242 --> 00:37:36.084]  And of course, today was the supposed deadline for folks to be able to do that.
[00:37:36.084 --> 00:37:44.386]  This story is up on InfoWars.com and was also carried by DrugsReport.com, and I'm gonna play a clip of it in just a moment.
[00:37:44.386 --> 00:37:50.088]  Cops to inspect homes without notice for illegal rentals.
[00:37:50.088 --> 00:37:53.849]  And the way this is pushed is, well, it's to stop illegal aliens that are renting illegally.
[00:37:54.446 --> 00:37:58.509]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it is to go into your house without a warrant.
[00:37:58.509 --> 00:38:03.051]  And there are people, a minority of them, in the comments section defending this as a way to stop crime.
[00:38:03.051 --> 00:38:07.514]  Well, you don't just go into someone's house looking for illegal drugs without a warrant.
[00:38:07.514 --> 00:38:17.820]  With a oath or affirmation, with a particular person, place, and things to be searched, the reason you're doing it, and that you get to face an accuser.
[00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:18.901]  That is the whole issue.
[00:38:22.993 --> 00:38:24.916]  And they will find any excuse to do this.
[00:38:24.916 --> 00:38:26.978]  Government wants in your house.
[00:38:26.978 --> 00:38:32.064]  You don't just randomly show up at the government and say, I'm going to go behind the counter and they'll see what's going on in your offices.
[00:38:32.064 --> 00:38:33.946]  They'd shoot you.
[00:38:33.946 --> 00:38:38.952]  But when they want to show up and come look in your house, well, they've got an excuse to do it.
[00:38:38.952 --> 00:38:42.716]  Zero tolerance program slammed as attack on property rights.
[00:38:42.716 --> 00:38:42.957]  Really?
[00:38:44.289 --> 00:38:57.275]  Authorities in Long Island, not public servants, have launched a crackdown on homeowners who rent their houses out to tenants who have not been registered under a zero-tolerance program that will see police conduct home inspections without notice.
[00:38:57.275 --> 00:39:11.823]  Yeah, they passed a law a few years ago in Austin, the hotels got it passed, trying to ban people on Craigslist renting out their apartments or homes for ACL or for South by Southwest or other popular events in Austin.
[00:39:12.743 --> 00:39:18.868]  And I've never rented my places out, but I'm tempted to do it, just all the places I've lived.
[00:39:18.868 --> 00:39:20.530]  I've never rented anything out.
[00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:24.973]  But I probably should, just to thumb my nose at the establishment.
[00:39:24.973 --> 00:39:33.381]  I mean, it's not enough we pay property taxes on it, that's feudalism, and this country didn't have until the last 60, 70 years, where your property is not even your property.
[00:39:33.381 --> 00:39:40.587]  Now, all over the country, not just in New York, but all over the place, the police are showing up without warrants.
[00:39:41.826 --> 00:39:44.088]  And saying, open up, we're going to see who lives here.
[00:39:44.088 --> 00:39:46.690]  First time I saw this was in an Illinois town.
[00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:47.511]  I forget where.
[00:39:47.511 --> 00:39:50.314]  Lister sent us the local newspaper.
[00:39:50.314 --> 00:39:51.435]  It was a suburb of Chicago.
[00:39:51.435 --> 00:39:53.196]  This is about 15 years ago.
[00:39:53.196 --> 00:39:57.440]  And it described the police, you know, the Johnsons woke up at 5 a.m.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:04.486]  to have the code enforcement police standing over their bed, telling them to stay in bed, shining a flashlight in their eyes without a warrant, and counting their toothbrushes.
[00:40:05.683 --> 00:40:14.030]  The House was only authorized to have two in it, under property taxes, but they might have been given the Johnsons a fine if they had three toothbrushes.
[00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:15.110]  Luckily, they didn't.
[00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:18.253]  And they were just reporting it like it was totally normal.
[00:40:18.253 --> 00:40:22.897]  Imagine you wake up and shining a flashlight in your face without warrants.
[00:40:22.897 --> 00:40:24.178]  Uniformed code police.
[00:40:24.178 --> 00:40:26.640]  I mean, that's agenda 21.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.002]  That's where this whole thing is going.
[00:40:30.002 --> 00:40:31.944]  So let's go ahead and play a clip of that.
[00:40:32.972 --> 00:40:37.999]  I pay $9,000 a year taxes and I don't think it's fair.
[00:40:37.999 --> 00:40:43.808]  Perry Esposito says the problem of illegal housing is getting worse in his Westbury neighborhood.
[00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:47.233]  He says at least two nearby homes have illegal tenants.
[00:40:47.233 --> 00:40:48.975]  Someone was living in the garage.
[00:40:49.716 --> 00:40:52.697]  No plumbing, no proper heating.
[00:40:52.697 --> 00:40:57.478]  They were paying part of that person's mortgage and taxes.
[00:40:57.478 --> 00:41:05.440]  After multiple complaints from residents like Perry, the village is cracking down with what it calls a new housing enforcement program.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:08.921]  The village says there will be zero tolerance for those breaking the law.
[00:41:09.201 --> 00:41:15.143]  Among the changes, the village will create a housing enforcement unit and hire two new officers.
[00:41:15.143 --> 00:41:20.526]  It'll conduct inspections without notice and increase housing violation fines.
[00:41:20.526 --> 00:41:26.228]  It will also raise fees and toughen maintenance rules for homes owned by absentee landlords.
[00:41:26.488 --> 00:41:28.909]  It's not targeted to any people in particular.
[00:41:28.909 --> 00:41:36.914]  It's just targeted to a situation which is landlords who are making money by victimizing people in the community and by victimizing the community as a whole.
[00:41:36.914 --> 00:41:44.898]  This is about trying to find habitable housing for people so that they can live legally and respect property rights.
[00:41:44.898 --> 00:41:53.062]  In the coming days, residents will be receiving these flyers from the village informing them about the specifics with this new housing enforcement program.
[00:41:53.062 --> 00:41:53.943]  Perry is hopeful...
[00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:58.131]  Now again, people can say, hey, this is the way to keep the neighborhood nice.
[00:41:58.131 --> 00:42:00.932]  This is how you end up being Nazi Germany.
[00:42:00.932 --> 00:42:14.717]  You leave the borders wide open, you got Detroit and a bunch of other cities collapsing, people can barely pay their bills, and now you're going to have Snappen's quote inspections without warrants where they're going to come in your house.
[00:42:14.717 --> 00:42:21.519]  And I know Austin has now put the code enforcers in uniforms and is arming some of them and are talking about this.
[00:42:21.519 --> 00:42:22.860]  And I've just had enough, okay?
[00:42:23.956 --> 00:42:29.721]  And that's why they're expanding most police forces into quasi SWAT teams because this is just what they're going to do.
[00:42:29.721 --> 00:42:31.102]  It's routine now.
[00:42:31.102 --> 00:42:35.446]  Where they just have you line up against the wall, search all your papers, persons, and effects.
[00:42:35.446 --> 00:42:38.448]  You give them any problem, they'll just fill you full of holes.
[00:42:38.448 --> 00:42:42.412]  All of America is being turned into a giant prison.
[00:42:42.412 --> 00:42:45.074]  And I guarantee you this is all going to be selectively enforced.
[00:42:45.074 --> 00:42:52.220]  And I don't care if you get some two or three slobs in there at the city council complaining about their neighbor having too many people living in their house.
[00:42:54.864 --> 00:43:02.006]  Because you do that now, there's no Bill of Rights, there's no Fourth Amendment, because someone complains?
[00:43:02.006 --> 00:43:10.927]  Again, I bet that those same people that I looked at on the video are big Obama supporters, and I bet they're for open borders.
[00:43:10.927 --> 00:43:11.467]  There it is.
[00:43:11.467 --> 00:43:13.208]  They just pulled up an article about Austin.
[00:43:13.208 --> 00:43:16.509]  Code compliance tracks down on short-term rentals.
[00:43:16.509 --> 00:43:17.829]  Austin, Texas.
[00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:18.349]  Same deal.
[00:43:19.724 --> 00:43:30.492]  And this is all about don't rent your house out during ACL or during any other big event because the hotels went and lobbied to have that done and it's all going to be selectively enforced.
[00:43:30.492 --> 00:43:36.116]  It'll probably end up being the different county commissioners and city people that have the, you know, 15 illegals living in the apartment.
[00:43:36.116 --> 00:43:43.162]  By the way, I know a lady who manages the biggest apartment complex group in Austin and she works for one of the biggest companies in the country.
[00:43:44.915 --> 00:43:46.376]  And I've told this story many times.
[00:43:46.376 --> 00:43:48.698]  We're going to go to your phone calls.
[00:43:48.698 --> 00:43:53.142]  They were called in in Dallas where the big apartment places is based.
[00:43:53.142 --> 00:43:55.464]  People that know about apartment management will know the company I'm talking about.
[00:43:55.464 --> 00:43:58.567]  It's probably the biggest based out of Dallas in the country.
[00:43:58.567 --> 00:44:04.953]  And she went with all the managers, it was a couple hundred of them, in this ballroom from all over the country.
[00:44:06.215 --> 00:44:10.678]  And they were told, listen, we got a deal with the federal government and the Justice Department.
[00:44:10.678 --> 00:44:15.640]  We have secretly become 501c whatever it was, tax exempt.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:21.483]  We want to kick citizens out and we want to rent to illegals and let them have unlimited.
[00:44:21.483 --> 00:44:22.944]  Unlimited.
[00:44:22.944 --> 00:44:25.506]  And this is part of our deal to get the tax exemption.
[00:44:25.506 --> 00:44:27.106]  It's a secret deal.
[00:44:27.106 --> 00:44:28.567]  You are to throw citizens out.
[00:44:28.567 --> 00:44:30.788]  Black, white, Hispanic, we don't care.
[00:44:30.788 --> 00:44:31.489]  Asian, doesn't matter.
[00:44:32.711 --> 00:44:35.893]  If they have their grandmother visiting for three days, throw them out.
[00:44:35.893 --> 00:44:41.255]  We are gonna, and these were nice apartments in Austin, they now literally have chickens running around in the yards.
[00:44:41.255 --> 00:44:47.939]  And they did this and covertly went to being government housing for illegals.
[00:44:47.939 --> 00:44:52.021]  That was actually in the Associated Press about eight, nine years ago.
[00:44:52.021 --> 00:44:54.862]  It was a headline, I'm not even thinking of the exact headline.
[00:44:54.862 --> 00:44:58.244]  Bankers give immigrants helping hand with housing loans.
[00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:02.112]  And it had the Bank of America housing loan heads.
[00:45:02.112 --> 00:45:05.936]  I remember this because I read the article on air probably 15 times or more.
[00:45:05.936 --> 00:45:13.622]  He said, oh yeah, citizens have got to have good credit and all their IDs, but immigrants, especially from Mexico, we want to give them a helping hand.
[00:45:13.622 --> 00:45:15.184]  We're just going to give them the housing loan.
[00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:18.581]  Why is that?
[00:45:18.581 --> 00:45:27.444]  To bring in groups that will politically vote to take the guns, politically vote for socialism, because they're taught in Mexico that's how you fight.
[00:45:27.444 --> 00:45:29.385]  The establishment has become socialist.
[00:45:29.385 --> 00:45:32.186]  That's the only form of revolution down there.
[00:45:32.186 --> 00:45:32.586]  There it is.
[00:45:32.586 --> 00:45:34.206]  Banks open doors to new customers.
[00:45:34.206 --> 00:45:35.647]  Illegal immigrants.
[00:45:35.647 --> 00:45:37.547]  Associated Press.
[00:45:37.547 --> 00:45:38.448]  That was Wall Street Journal.
[00:45:38.448 --> 00:45:40.828]  You were actually able to find that?
[00:45:40.828 --> 00:45:41.929]  Print that for me, brother.
[00:45:43.227 --> 00:45:44.667]  What year is that from?
[00:45:44.667 --> 00:45:45.248]  2005.
[00:45:45.248 --> 00:45:46.468]  You actually found it, Jordan.
[00:45:46.468 --> 00:45:48.128]  I haven't been able to find that in years.
[00:45:48.128 --> 00:45:49.049]  Print that for me.
[00:45:49.049 --> 00:45:49.489]  Unbelievable.
[00:45:49.489 --> 00:45:50.769]  Good job.
[00:45:50.769 --> 00:45:56.531]  Anyways, and I learned about this at Bank of America.
[00:45:56.531 --> 00:45:59.791]  You know, as soon as this lady retires, and she's very close to retiring.
[00:45:59.791 --> 00:46:00.772]  She's an old family friend.
[00:46:00.772 --> 00:46:03.012]  She listens to the show every day.
[00:46:03.012 --> 00:46:05.593]  I'm going to get her in here, and she will tell you the stories.
[00:46:07.091 --> 00:46:13.541]  If they don't get the social security number exactly right by accident in a form, Homeland Security shows up and threatens to arrest everyone.
[00:46:13.541 --> 00:46:15.063]  I mean, they have it all computerized.
[00:46:15.063 --> 00:46:21.313]  Illegal aliens, folks, can butcher goats in their bathrooms and they're told, you leave them alone.
[00:46:22.895 --> 00:46:25.818]  And again, I don't dislike the illegals, folks.
[00:46:25.818 --> 00:46:27.239]  Western culture in the U.S.
[00:46:27.239 --> 00:46:29.001]  is pretty much Spanish.
[00:46:29.001 --> 00:46:33.104]  Cowboy hats, the food, the whole shoot-em-up deal.
[00:46:33.104 --> 00:46:36.447]  I mean, this is part of the Southwestern culture.
[00:46:36.447 --> 00:46:39.850]  It's that they've imposed a globalist culture over it.
[00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:42.132]  I mean, here's an article on DrugsReport.com right now.
[00:46:43.012 --> 00:46:43.752]  Study.
[00:46:43.752 --> 00:46:47.294]  Six to one liberal bias in Hispanic TV news.
[00:46:47.294 --> 00:46:48.795]  It's not liberal.
[00:46:48.795 --> 00:46:56.579]  It's take my guns, take my kids, vaccines are the law, government's God, freedom is bad, I'm sick of it.
[00:46:56.579 --> 00:47:01.002]  That's a major study that's out that Politico is reporting on.
[00:47:01.002 --> 00:47:02.903]  Univision, Telemundo, skew liberal.
[00:47:03.885 --> 00:47:04.566]  The main U.S.
[00:47:04.566 --> 00:47:20.062]  Spanish language news program skewed liberal on domestic issues and spent most of their time in the past few months covering the new health care law, saying how great it was, immigration reform, blah blah blah.
[00:47:20.062 --> 00:47:23.625]  And so that's the type of garbage that we're looking at here.
[00:47:23.625 --> 00:47:25.087]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:47:26.758 --> 00:47:27.758]  I'm sick of it.
[00:47:27.758 --> 00:47:34.140]  And it's total discrimination because the globalist folks want a red carpet for illegals.
[00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.621]  Red carpet.
[00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:49.825]  See, when I see a story about all the people living in houses and people renting houses out, folks, this country was built on somebody buying a big colonial-style two-story house with
[00:47:52.176 --> 00:48:10.907]  Big porches all around the top and daddy goes out and works to have a steady paycheck at the factory and mama takes care of the kids, cleans the house and cooks food for the seven guys that live and the old lady that live upstairs or live downstairs.
[00:48:12.132 --> 00:48:13.894]  And it's a boarding house.
[00:48:13.894 --> 00:48:15.475]  And that's how America operated.
[00:48:15.475 --> 00:48:20.840]  Everybody didn't always just have, you know, a two-story house and three cars and go on all these vacations.
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.222]  Everybody just didn't have all this money.
[00:48:23.222 --> 00:48:26.905]  And that's how most Americans made it, was they got a room somewhere.
[00:48:29.682 --> 00:48:37.569]  And from what I've read and people I've talked to and traveling salesmen and folks I know, talking to old great uncles before they died, they'd travel the country and stay at boarding houses.
[00:48:37.569 --> 00:48:38.229]  And it'd be fun.
[00:48:38.229 --> 00:48:44.495]  You'd cook dinner down there and nice people and play poker or cards after dinner and smoke a pipe out on the porch.
[00:48:44.495 --> 00:48:46.716]  That's what America's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:46.716 --> 00:48:49.799]  And they take that and they make that dirty and bad.
[00:48:49.799 --> 00:48:53.182]  And I will assure you, the people in the comments are like, well, we've got to stop the illegals.
[00:48:53.422 --> 00:48:59.185]  The illegals are above the law with drinking and driving and with everything else until this country goes belly up.
[00:48:59.185 --> 00:49:00.406]  Then they're not going to be above the law.
[00:49:00.406 --> 00:49:01.647]  I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:49:01.647 --> 00:49:05.009]  We will go to your calls in the next segment throughout the next hour.
[00:49:05.009 --> 00:49:09.792]  It's just that, see, I see one article about the Fourth Amendment being gutted.
[00:49:09.792 --> 00:49:12.053]  It's happening all over the country under Gen 21.
[00:49:12.053 --> 00:49:13.894]  And they sell it like we're going to clean the town up.
[00:49:13.894 --> 00:49:16.255]  No, they're getting rid of property rights and the Fourth Amendment.
[00:49:16.255 --> 00:49:17.276]  And it's a nightmare.
[00:49:17.276 --> 00:49:18.717]  And the illegals are above the law.
[00:49:18.717 --> 00:49:20.718]  And they get to have housing loans when you don't.
[00:49:22.096 --> 00:49:23.957]  Now that's discriminatory.
[00:49:23.957 --> 00:49:27.597]  And it's because the Ford Foundation finances and controls Spanish-run media.
[00:49:27.597 --> 00:49:33.879]  The biggest donor of TV stations for Spanish in the country isn't even Hispanic.
[00:49:33.879 --> 00:49:34.659]  And what does he run?
[00:49:34.659 --> 00:49:35.900]  Billboards in LA?
[00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.300]  Saying California is now Mexico.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.661]  Basically, gringos get out.
[00:49:39.661 --> 00:49:41.481]  We've covered that article.
[00:49:41.481 --> 00:49:42.802]  Take the American flags down.
[00:49:42.802 --> 00:49:43.922]  Gringos are bad.
[00:49:43.922 --> 00:49:47.083]  The last thing they want is Hispanics, whites, and everybody getting along.
[00:49:47.083 --> 00:49:47.923]  Which is really happening.
[00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:52.367]  This is race-based garbage, folks, and we can't put up with it anymore.
[00:49:52.367 --> 00:50:00.131]  We're going to come back and go to Noble Patriot Pete, Justin Rage, Josh, and others.
[00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:02.032]  Briefly, the new magazine.
[00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:06.235]  Last month, we did the War Against Men with John Wayne on the cover.
[00:50:06.235 --> 00:50:09.477]  This month, we have Justin Biebler.
[00:50:09.477 --> 00:50:11.057]  No, that's not Justin Biebler.
[00:50:11.057 --> 00:50:13.279]  That's, what's that idiot's name?
[00:50:13.279 --> 00:50:14.719]  Hannah Montana?
[00:50:14.719 --> 00:50:15.340]  What's her name now?
[00:50:17.375 --> 00:50:21.997]  Miley Cyrus merged with Marilyn Monroe, and it's the war on women.
[00:50:21.997 --> 00:50:31.903]  Explaining how they're putting chemicals, biologicals in your food, in your water, how they're manipulating you, what fake feminism is, how to truly empower women, aka Annie Oakley 2.0.
[00:50:31.903 --> 00:50:32.523]  It's all in there.
[00:50:32.523 --> 00:50:32.963]  Very proud of it.
[00:50:32.963 --> 00:50:33.904]  You can buy it in bulk.

[00:51:01.431 --> 00:51:09.152]  Jessica Armand here, creator of My Magic Mud, the all-natural teeth whitener and strengthening remedy that's getting rave reviews from GCN listeners.
[00:51:09.152 --> 00:51:12.433]  Here's what Austin dentist Dr. Griffin Cole has to say about it.
[00:51:12.433 --> 00:51:14.133]  I really love this Magic Mud product.
[00:51:14.133 --> 00:51:20.254]  Because charcoal is so absorbent, it's very effective at taking off all the sticky plaque and debris that gets stuck on our teeth every day.
[00:51:20.254 --> 00:51:21.835]  I highly recommend My Magic Mud.
[00:51:21.835 --> 00:51:25.695]  Visit MyMagicMud.com to hear the full interview with Dr. Cole.

[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:32.901]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[00:51:32.901 --> 00:51:37.203]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[00:51:37.203 --> 00:51:38.603]  Silverlungs.com.
[00:51:38.603 --> 00:51:41.284]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[00:51:41.284 --> 00:51:44.265]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[00:51:44.265 --> 00:51:46.626]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[00:51:46.626 --> 00:51:48.527]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[00:51:48.527 --> 00:51:54.089]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[00:51:54.089 --> 00:51:57.890]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:59.391]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[00:52:00.373 --> 00:52:06.156]  What I'm about to tell you is based on information obtained from a little-known government document called FT-900.
[00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:11.539]  This bombshell government document contains evidence on what I believe will cause the next 9-11.
[00:52:11.539 --> 00:52:23.405]  I've just posted a video at www.next911exposed2.com that not only analyzes the contents of this document, but it walks you through the exact timeline of how and when this 9-11 event is scheduled to occur.
[00:52:24.085 --> 00:52:29.151]  Just like 9-11 had a lasting impact on our society, this event will reshape America.
[00:52:29.151 --> 00:52:36.379]  It will swipe trillions off markets and retirement accounts everywhere and destroy the way of life of millions of unprepared Americans.
[00:52:36.379 --> 00:52:41.145]  But it will also trigger what promises to be the biggest wealth transfer in the history of our nation.
[00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:47.329]  But you only have a few weeks left to take all the necessary steps to protect yourself and your family.
[00:52:47.329 --> 00:52:53.314]  Just visit www.nex911exposed2.com to view my newly released video.
[00:52:53.314 --> 00:52:58.718]  Again, that's www.nex911exposed2.com, before it's too late.
[00:52:59.418 --> 00:53:01.320]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.962]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:53:04.962 --> 00:53:09.526]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:53:09.526 --> 00:53:15.631]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:53:15.631 --> 00:53:26.399]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[00:53:26.599 --> 00:53:33.085]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:53:33.085 --> 00:53:47.838]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:53:48.038 --> 00:53:50.402]  And sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[00:53:50.402 --> 00:53:55.730]  Get your Pro-Pure with the new Pro-1 filters today at Infowarsstore.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:22.871]  All right, we're going right to your phone calls.
[00:54:22.871 --> 00:54:25.353]  If you just joined us, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:54:25.353 --> 00:54:26.775]  We're here Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[00:54:26.775 --> 00:54:27.135]  to 2 p.m.
[00:54:27.135 --> 00:54:27.796]  Central.
[00:54:27.796 --> 00:54:29.457]  Back weeknights 7 o'clock Central.
[00:54:29.457 --> 00:54:33.181]  Infowarsnews.com to find all the details there.
[00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:37.125]  The nightly news, folks, is very well produced, very focused, condensed 30 minutes.
[00:54:37.125 --> 00:54:38.546]  We're very proud of it.
[00:54:38.546 --> 00:54:39.827]  And Leanne walked me this morning.
[00:54:39.827 --> 00:54:43.090]  I'm very honored that she remembered this.
[00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:45.352]  This is the one-year anniversary of her working here.
[00:54:46.478 --> 00:54:59.389]  And her, and Ja'Kari, and David Knight, and our other great reporters, John Bowne, and of course, folks like Darren McBreen, and Paul Watson, and just everyone here, Kurt Nemo, Don Salazar, everybody.
[00:54:59.389 --> 00:55:04.913]  The folks behind the scenes, like Marcos Morales, y'all never go to your calls for thanking all the crew.
[00:55:04.913 --> 00:55:09.416]  The entire crew do an incredible job, especially the radio slash TV crew.
[00:55:09.416 --> 00:55:12.219]  This is live, and they're on their toes.
[00:55:13.624 --> 00:55:18.168]  On their toes for two hours before the show and three hours during it.
[00:55:18.168 --> 00:55:20.530]  But I want to talk about hoaxes.
[00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:27.697]  I mean, just the magnitude of the hoaxes that survive off the public's ignorance.
[00:55:27.697 --> 00:55:30.019]  And that's why the government teaches 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[00:55:30.019 --> 00:55:31.901]  And I do have that 1984 quote.
[00:55:31.901 --> 00:55:36.065]  I'll read it at the start of the second segment next hour to re-kick off the topic.
[00:55:37.463 --> 00:55:38.503]  Are we planted hoax?
[00:55:38.503 --> 00:55:41.024]  How do you fight these hoaxes that are so huge?
[00:55:41.024 --> 00:55:47.146]  The lies that are so big, they're hard to even comprehend, much less deal with.
[00:55:47.146 --> 00:55:52.728]  And what do you think of Obamacare and where it's going on this April Fool's Day?
[00:55:52.728 --> 00:55:54.249]  Let's go to Justin in Texas.
[00:55:54.249 --> 00:55:55.329]  Thanks for calling in, Justin.
[00:55:55.329 --> 00:55:56.930]  You're on the air.
[00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:58.150]  How's it going, Alex?
[00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.610]  Good, brother.
[00:55:58.610 --> 00:55:59.291]  Thanks for calling in.
[00:55:59.291 --> 00:55:59.871]  What's on your mind?
[00:56:00.871 --> 00:56:08.833]  Well, the hoax I was calling about is a couple of days ago, I got a call and I answered it and the guy was like, hey, you want a package and stuff, you know?
[00:56:08.833 --> 00:56:12.494]  And I was like, you know, I didn't know anything about a package.
[00:56:12.494 --> 00:56:16.075]  And I told him I wasn't interested and he told me F you and hung up.
[00:56:16.075 --> 00:56:18.216]  And so, you know, I was like, that was weird.
[00:56:18.216 --> 00:56:23.317]  So I call it back and then I leave a message saying, hey, I'm really interested in your package.
[00:56:23.317 --> 00:56:26.498]  And he calls me back next morning and I'm all acting like I'm interested, you know?
[00:56:27.176 --> 00:56:32.919]  And then he starts digging for personal information and as soon as he asks, he's like, I mean, how old are you?
[00:56:32.919 --> 00:56:36.700]  And I was like, you know, I'm old enough to know that this is the worst scam I've ever seen in my life.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:44.324]  And he literally tried to cuss me out for like two minutes and said that if I hang up right now, I can call somebody else and just get all their information.
[00:56:44.324 --> 00:56:48.806]  So you were, I mean, was it a navigator that called you?
[00:56:49.764 --> 00:56:51.224]  I have no clue who it was.
[00:56:51.224 --> 00:56:56.485]  It said it was from Jamaica, was the number was from Jamaica, and it was like JM Exchange.
[00:56:56.485 --> 00:57:00.306]  Well that's the thing is third world countries are just bombarding the U.S.
[00:57:00.306 --> 00:57:05.747]  because we are known as suckers worldwide, the most gullible quite frankly.
[00:57:05.747 --> 00:57:08.988]  It's not that we're all gullible, but on average we're like the right whale.
[00:57:08.988 --> 00:57:12.248]  Do you know the story of the right whale?
[00:57:12.248 --> 00:57:12.608]  No sir.
[00:57:12.608 --> 00:57:15.069]  Do you know why it was called the right whale?
[00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:15.169]  No.
[00:57:15.825 --> 00:57:16.566]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:19.048]  Let me tell you that story and then we're going to go to break and come back with more calls.
[00:57:19.048 --> 00:57:22.350]  Which fits into Planet Hoax and Obamacare.
[00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:25.412]  The right whale would come over and snuggle boats.
[00:57:25.412 --> 00:57:29.816]  The right whale was friendly, gregarious, sweet, liked humans.
[00:57:29.816 --> 00:57:33.278]  If they see you out swimming, they'll come over and start nuzzling you lovingly.
[00:57:33.278 --> 00:57:38.923]  They're very, very fat and have a lot of blubber that had the whale oil they needed to light lamps.
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:48.348]  It was the invention of other types of oil, the discovery of oil, that helped whales not become extinct.
[00:57:48.348 --> 00:57:51.150]  And they hunted them down, they think, to just less than a hundred.
[00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:53.853]  And they're back in the thousands now.
[00:57:53.853 --> 00:57:56.395]  Other whales would run when they saw ships.
[00:57:56.395 --> 00:57:59.217]  Other whales would dive deep when they saw ships.
[00:57:59.217 --> 00:58:01.379]  Sperm whales would run when they saw ships.
[00:58:01.379 --> 00:58:04.382]  They would try to smash up the rowboats.
[00:58:04.382 --> 00:58:04.842]  A.K.A.
[00:58:04.842 --> 00:58:05.343]  Moby Dick.
[00:58:07.389 --> 00:58:08.029]  Not the right whale.
[00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:10.610]  They would swim at the harpoons.
[00:58:10.610 --> 00:58:12.771]  And that's America.
[00:58:12.771 --> 00:58:15.052]  We were more like a sperm whale 100 years ago.
[00:58:15.052 --> 00:58:17.733]  We now behave like a right whale.
[00:58:17.733 --> 00:58:18.913]  Fat, dumb, and happy.
[00:58:18.913 --> 00:58:22.335]  And never saw a harpoon we didn't want to swallow.
[00:58:22.335 --> 00:58:24.055]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:24.055 --> 00:58:26.256]  That's the bottom line on that.
[00:58:26.256 --> 00:58:30.218]  And of course, we're talking about Obama when we talk about...
[00:58:31.673 --> 00:58:35.698]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna come right back with more of your phone calls straight ahead.
[00:58:35.698 --> 00:58:37.980]  It's Planet Hoax, April 1st.
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:40.984]  Hope you like Obamacare, suckers.
[00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:41.865]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:41.865 --> 00:58:43.167]  You don't, you're racist.
[00:58:43.167 --> 00:58:44.408]  We have the article proving it.
[00:58:44.408 --> 00:58:46.450]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:50.336 --> 00:59:00.998]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[00:59:00.998 --> 00:59:03.079]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[00:59:03.079 --> 00:59:03.959]  Fluoride!
[00:59:03.959 --> 00:59:05.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:12.181]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[00:59:12.441 --> 00:59:17.367]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[00:59:17.367 --> 00:59:23.693]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:26.116]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[00:59:26.116 --> 00:59:29.059]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[00:59:29.059 --> 00:59:32.423]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[00:59:32.543 --> 00:59:37.988]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:59:37.988 --> 00:59:43.072]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[00:59:43.072 --> 00:59:44.273]  I take it every day.
[00:59:44.273 --> 00:59:49.217]  That's InfoWarsLife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:59:49.217 --> 00:59:55.722]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.722 --> 00:59:58.525]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.236 --> 01:00:10.057]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.057 --> 01:00:11.637]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.637 --> 01:00:13.198]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.198 --> 01:00:17.378]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.378 --> 01:00:28.281]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.281 --> 01:00:31.001]  We're back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:31.001 --> 01:00:31.921]  Into the second hour.
[01:00:31.921 --> 01:00:33.022]  It is April Fool's Day.
[01:00:33.022 --> 01:00:33.882]  I haven't gotten into
[01:00:34.744 --> 01:00:37.985]  The latest scams in Obamacare, but you know them.
[01:00:37.985 --> 01:00:53.149]  We've got major geopolitical news, major news on North Korea front, where North Koreans trade shellfire with each other, and there's been a big earthquake they think could be an atomic detonation.
[01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:56.630]  We've got more of that coming up, but right now let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:00:56.630 --> 01:01:00.252]  We're talking about, if you just joined us, what are the big hoaxes in government right now?
[01:01:00.252 --> 01:01:01.292]  What do you think of Obamacare?
[01:01:02.506 --> 01:01:02.986]  Hi Alex.
[01:01:02.986 --> 01:01:07.109]  One of the hoaxes I wanted to talk about, and I think it's a big hoax for young people in this country today,
[01:01:29.281 --> 01:01:33.684]  Is the lie that you have to go to college.
[01:01:33.684 --> 01:01:38.708]  I think that once the government got involved with college, it became a huge hoax.
[01:01:38.708 --> 01:01:46.234]  And they know that they shipped all the jobs overseas and that you'll be in debt once you get out.
[01:01:46.234 --> 01:01:49.236]  And you're not going to be able to find a job.
[01:01:49.236 --> 01:01:52.678]  It just keeps you a slave to the big banks.
[01:01:52.678 --> 01:01:56.421]  They use them as like a liberal propaganda center.
[01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:57.882]  And I don't know.
[01:01:57.882 --> 01:01:58.623]  I just think that
[01:01:59.266 --> 01:02:07.509]  College never, it used to be a good thing, but now it's just become a hoax and just a money-making scheme for banks.
[01:02:07.509 --> 01:02:19.373]  You know, I've been thinking about writing a book about how college is a hoax and show how almost every major company starter or trailblazer or inventor, almost none of them went to college or finished it.
[01:02:19.373 --> 01:02:23.195]  And you go to college to learn how to work in a corporation and learn how to comply.
[01:02:23.195 --> 01:02:26.156]  If you're going to be an engineer or a lawyer or a doctor, you need to go.
[01:02:26.894 --> 01:02:30.057]  But everything else is a hoax, is a fraud.
[01:02:30.057 --> 01:02:35.161]  Unless you want to be, say, an academic and work at the college or be an archaeologist or something, then you need to go there.
[01:02:35.161 --> 01:02:39.924]  But most of the degrees they hand out, and this is on record, are overpriced.
[01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:42.406]  And you're right, just like we had the best healthcare up into the 60s.
[01:02:43.527 --> 01:02:49.448]  Government got involved, wrecked it, now they're getting involved more, totally wrecking it, with special interest.
[01:02:49.448 --> 01:02:53.649]  We had some of the best colleges in the world, now they're an absolute joke.
[01:02:53.649 --> 01:03:04.971]  I mean, hundreds of thousands of dollars, with incredible interest rates, and almost everyone I know, I know people that have three degrees, and they're working two jobs and are bankrupt.
[01:03:04.971 --> 01:03:12.293]  Now I know folks that also have degrees that went outside of their own business that are doing great, but, and it stalls you until you're like 30, getting two or three degrees.
[01:03:13.819 --> 01:03:37.975]  I cannot tell you how many people I know that have all these degrees, and then they're a masseuse, or they own a lawn mowing company, or they own a restaurant, or they are a yoga instructor, or they own a shop, and they're like 45 years old and are finally living a good life because they're an entrepreneur, and they're finally paying off their student loans.
[01:03:37.975 --> 01:03:41.137]  I mean, this is the new form of slavery.
[01:03:41.137 --> 01:03:41.978]  It's a total joke.
[01:03:43.817 --> 01:03:44.357]  We're good to go.
[01:04:10.365 --> 01:04:11.865]  Unbelievable, good to hear from you.
[01:04:11.865 --> 01:04:14.526]  You know, I mentioned a bunch of hoaxes today, did not mention education.
[01:04:14.526 --> 01:04:15.946]  That's got to be one of the biggest.
[01:04:15.946 --> 01:04:18.446]  Whoppers.
[01:04:18.446 --> 01:04:19.927]  But again, the Federal Reserve is not federal.
[01:04:19.927 --> 01:04:23.807]  Whopper, IRS, not one red cent of the money you pay goes around the country.
[01:04:23.807 --> 01:04:27.888]  Ronald Reagan's own congressional commission in Congress, 1981.
[01:04:27.888 --> 01:04:29.488]  Whopper!
[01:04:29.488 --> 01:04:36.230]  Just Whopper, Whopper, Whopper, Whopper, Whopper, Whopper, Whopper, Whopper.
[01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:38.710]  Now I'll tell you a degree that will pay, and that's mining.
[01:04:40.233 --> 01:04:43.534]  And I'll tell you another degree, the maintenance of robots.
[01:04:43.534 --> 01:04:49.175]  I mean, I know so many people that are good mechanics, you know, that have got great jobs because they're hardworking and smart.
[01:04:49.175 --> 01:04:50.656]  Let me tell you about companies.
[01:04:50.656 --> 01:04:55.717]  They end up putting in positions who gets the job done and doesn't give them trouble.
[01:04:55.717 --> 01:04:58.858]  And I guess college, you know, is good for something.
[01:04:58.858 --> 01:04:59.378]  I don't know what.
[01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:09.501]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[01:05:09.501 --> 01:05:17.906]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[01:05:17.906 --> 01:05:22.788]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[01:05:22.788 --> 01:05:29.152]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:29.552]  No.
[01:05:29.552 --> 01:05:36.721]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:05:36.721 --> 01:05:38.643]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[01:05:38.643 --> 01:05:43.769]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:05:43.769 --> 01:05:48.114]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:05:48.234 --> 01:05:51.617]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:05:51.617 --> 01:05:53.518]  You will be supporting a free press.
[01:05:53.518 --> 01:05:57.921]  All the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:05:57.921 --> 01:06:00.363]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[01:06:00.363 --> 01:06:01.384]  The facts are in.
[01:06:01.384 --> 01:06:02.785]  The studies are legion.
[01:06:02.785 --> 01:06:10.310]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:06:10.310 --> 01:06:13.733]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:06:14.113 --> 01:06:14.693]  Simple.
[01:06:14.693 --> 01:06:19.416]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:06:19.416 --> 01:06:25.139]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:06:25.139 --> 01:06:41.469]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation, fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:06:41.469 --> 01:06:43.310]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:46.031]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:06:46.031 --> 01:06:48.192]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.
[01:06:48.192 --> 01:06:53.734]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:06:53.734 --> 01:06:58.156]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[01:06:58.156 --> 01:06:59.417]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:03.059]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:07:03.059 --> 01:07:08.203]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[01:07:08.203 --> 01:07:16.329]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:07:16.329 --> 01:07:20.852]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[01:07:20.852 --> 01:07:24.675]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[01:07:24.815 --> 01:07:30.762]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:07:30.762 --> 01:07:33.926]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:07:33.926 --> 01:07:39.072]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from my Patriot Supply.
[01:07:39.753 --> 01:07:47.480]  BuyPatriotSupply.com forward slash Alex today for special offers on emergency food storage or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:47.800]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.682]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[01:07:50.682 --> 01:07:51.623]  BuyPatriotSupply.com slash Alex.
[01:08:03.129 --> 01:08:09.756]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.756 --> 01:08:12.760]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.404 --> 01:08:23.628]  We're taking first-time callers today on April Fool's.
[01:08:23.628 --> 01:08:28.153]  What do you think the biggest government-slash-globalist corporate hoax is?
[01:08:28.153 --> 01:08:30.896]  Last caller brought up public education.
[01:08:30.896 --> 01:08:39.726]  Well, he brought up secondary education, the big college systems, and was pointing out that since government got involved in it, it's been turned into nothing but a social engineering system.
[01:08:40.467 --> 01:08:46.173]  Even mainline publications like Money Magazine and Forbes admit, for most people, college is a dead end.
[01:08:46.173 --> 01:08:52.920]  These jobs don't exist that you're going to school for and you're paying way too much for what they're worth.
[01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:54.750]  Great point.
[01:08:54.750 --> 01:09:00.974]  But of course we're talking about hoaxes because we're discussing Obamacare here today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:00.974 --> 01:09:08.499]  And some of the Obamacare headlines that I wanted to get to before we go back to your calls are right here in front of me.
[01:09:24.389 --> 01:09:27.191]  is a total and complete failure.
[01:09:27.191 --> 01:09:33.874]  And when you look at it, Drudge is in the top 100 websites.
[01:09:33.874 --> 01:09:38.737]  Infowars.com is in the top 1,000 websites.
[01:09:38.737 --> 01:09:40.898]  Drudge is number one for news.
[01:09:40.898 --> 01:09:45.240]  I think it's like 30 or something on the web, or 10, I forget, it's always up and down.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.522]  And then if you look at healthcare.gov,
[01:09:51.391 --> 01:09:58.515]  And all the other sites combined that go into that one URL, it's in the top 5,000.
[01:09:58.515 --> 01:10:02.277]  Sometimes in the top 10,000, it drops.
[01:10:02.277 --> 01:10:05.659]  So there you go, you can go look at those numbers for yourself.
[01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:10.963]  The great mighty website that they say six million people have logged into and works so wonderfully, doesn't work.
[01:10:10.963 --> 01:10:18.107]  And coming in at the bottom of the hour, Joe, who's one of our engineers on the new TV studio that's done, I've just got to get in there and start doing it.
[01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:21.991]  I've got so much going on though right now, but we're we're getting there folks.
[01:10:21.991 --> 01:10:22.652]  We're working hard.
[01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:23.432]  Don't worry.
[01:10:23.432 --> 01:10:26.355]  A lot of unforeseen family stuff come up last few months.
[01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:30.800]  It's really throwing a monkey wrench and everything, but things are getting better by the grace of God.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.722]  But continuing, he's going to come in.
[01:10:32.722 --> 01:10:36.666]  He spent hours this weekend and today doing a test of it.
[01:10:37.327 --> 01:10:40.669]  And we've got video of that coming up on the Nightly News soon.
[01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:42.349]  And it just does not work.
[01:10:42.349 --> 01:10:43.210]  It's a total fraud.
[01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:44.711]  It's designed to be a fraud.
[01:10:44.711 --> 01:10:50.854]  I predicted the website wouldn't work, because they want to make it about the website not working, not that it's a giant fraud.
[01:10:50.854 --> 01:10:55.596]  Just like they're now admitting, oh, the IRS will be taking your bank account.
[01:10:55.596 --> 01:10:58.477]  So there is that report.
[01:10:58.477 --> 01:11:01.559]  Healthcare website stumbles on last day.
[01:11:01.559 --> 01:11:04.020]  CNBC reports, and it's been up and down,
[01:11:05.407 --> 01:11:11.091]  Cleveland Clinic CEO, three quarters of Americans who sign up for Obamacare now have higher premiums.
[01:11:11.091 --> 01:11:13.253]  Yeah, I think that's a conservative number.
[01:11:13.253 --> 01:11:14.954]  That's out of CBS News.
[01:11:14.954 --> 01:11:16.635]  Obamacare advocate on deadline.
[01:11:16.635 --> 01:11:22.800]  This is like trying to find a parking spot at a Walmart on December 21st or 23rd.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.862]  No, it's like trying to find a parking spot on the moon.
[01:11:25.862 --> 01:11:26.823]  It just doesn't exist.
[01:11:26.823 --> 01:11:27.263]  It's a fraud.
[01:11:28.325 --> 01:11:34.049]  What they do is they'll pass you on to select globalist Warren Buffett insurance companies.
[01:11:34.049 --> 01:11:47.619]  When you get on the website, they'll finally give you a phone number to a navigator that's an organized crime figure, who will then pump you for your social security number, shell it to a dozen different criminal organizations, and then load you into the IRS database.
[01:11:47.619 --> 01:11:49.981]  It is chump planet.
[01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:52.863]  It is where you go to be gang robbed.
[01:11:53.723 --> 01:11:58.004]  And Americans love to be robbed, love to be pimped, love to be abused.
[01:11:58.004 --> 01:12:01.945]  And I'm sitting there telling Democrats I know, who finally are waking up, this is a bad deal.
[01:12:01.945 --> 01:12:05.966]  I was talking to some Democrats last night and they're like, really?
[01:12:05.966 --> 01:12:07.646]  They really are screwing us.
[01:12:07.646 --> 01:12:09.187]  It really is a big scam.
[01:12:09.187 --> 01:12:11.367]  It really is increasing premiums.
[01:12:11.367 --> 01:12:12.387]  It really doesn't work.
[01:12:12.387 --> 01:12:13.748]  It really is a fraud.
[01:12:13.748 --> 01:12:16.328]  It really is a criminal takeover.
[01:12:16.328 --> 01:12:18.249]  Obama is the more effective of evils.
[01:12:18.249 --> 01:12:19.369]  I see what you're saying.
[01:12:19.369 --> 01:12:20.089]  You're right!
[01:12:20.089 --> 01:12:20.869]  Oh my gosh!
[01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:21.410]  Yes!
[01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:21.850]  Yes!
[01:12:21.850 --> 01:12:22.510]  That's it!
[01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:23.070]  Now you get it!
[01:12:25.728 --> 01:12:26.969]  Covered Californian.
[01:12:26.969 --> 01:12:30.051]  That's the name of their organization.
[01:12:30.051 --> 01:12:31.112]  Covered California.
[01:12:31.112 --> 01:12:32.093]  See, notice the name.
[01:12:32.093 --> 01:12:33.594]  Everyone's covered.
[01:12:33.594 --> 01:12:34.335]  It's affordable.
[01:12:34.335 --> 01:12:34.875]  No, it's not.
[01:12:34.875 --> 01:12:36.156]  It's all a hoax.
[01:12:36.156 --> 01:12:38.178]  The names are Covered California.
[01:12:38.178 --> 01:12:39.459]  Covered in lies.
[01:12:39.459 --> 01:12:40.319]  Covered in scams.
[01:12:40.319 --> 01:12:41.020]  Covered in fraud.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:42.321]  Covered in white collar scams.
[01:12:42.321 --> 01:12:47.505]  Posing as trendy liberals with non-threatening twit voices that they've been militarily trained to use so you don't resist them.
[01:12:48.650 --> 01:12:50.932]  Oh, it's so liberal!
[01:12:50.932 --> 01:12:57.157]  Covered California sends deaf callers to hotline offering hot ladies.
[01:12:57.157 --> 01:13:00.801]  CBS News, you can't make this up.
[01:13:00.801 --> 01:13:02.602]  Ooh, baby, I'm so glad you called.
[01:13:02.602 --> 01:13:03.623]  What are you wearing right now?
[01:13:03.623 --> 01:13:07.987]  I guess you're covered in something else.
[01:13:07.987 --> 01:13:08.707]  Here's another one.
[01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:12.951]  Out of the New York Times, a whitewash article.
[01:13:12.951 --> 01:13:15.252]  I mean, this is just too insane.
[01:13:15.252 --> 01:13:20.296]  Interpreter snores on phone after being on hold with Obamacare counselor.
[01:13:20.296 --> 01:13:23.639]  There's people falling asleep.
[01:13:23.639 --> 01:13:25.520]  The enrollment deadline.
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:30.704]  There's no deadline, there's no taxes if you don't do it, but there is a deadline and a penalty.
[01:13:30.704 --> 01:13:32.705]  Again, another hoax.
[01:13:32.705 --> 01:13:37.008]  But don't worry, Valerie Jarrett says, quote, sign up for healthcare today in her tweet.
[01:13:37.008 --> 01:13:38.329]  It's easy.
[01:13:38.329 --> 01:13:38.770]  Peasy.
[01:13:39.921 --> 01:13:45.243]  Retweet Paul Begala, who said, stroke of the pen, law of the land, kind of cool to be a dictator.
[01:13:45.243 --> 01:13:46.823]  I signed up for Obamacare.
[01:13:46.823 --> 01:13:48.343]  Here's why.
[01:13:48.343 --> 01:13:50.544]  And they just keep telling you, I signed up.
[01:13:50.544 --> 01:13:52.444]  Turns out these people already have insurance.
[01:13:52.444 --> 01:13:54.685]  They didn't sign up for any of it.
[01:13:54.685 --> 01:13:56.166]  That's a whole scandal right there.
[01:13:56.166 --> 01:13:57.926]  They just go, I get it.
[01:13:57.926 --> 01:13:59.486]  Come on, come on mice.
[01:13:59.486 --> 01:14:01.387]  I ate the deacon.
[01:14:01.387 --> 01:14:02.027]  Come eat some.
[01:14:02.027 --> 01:14:04.808]  They're like, acting like they're eating the deacon.
[01:14:04.808 --> 01:14:07.229]  They're the Judas goats that leads you into the slaughter.
[01:14:07.229 --> 01:14:08.029]  You know what a Judas goat is?
[01:14:08.928 --> 01:14:23.098]  It's the head billy goat who's trusted, who's old, and who everybody follows, and who's dominant, and then every year, when they decide to slaughter a large portion of the goats and sell the meat, or sell them, they lead you into the barn.
[01:14:23.098 --> 01:14:25.560]  The Judas goat does that.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.882]  It's a trained goat used in general animal herding.
[01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:33.886]  The Judas goat is trained to associate with sheep or cattle, leading them in a specific direction.
[01:14:35.276 --> 01:14:39.599]  In stockyards, a Judas goat will lead sheep to slaughter while its own life is spared.
[01:14:39.599 --> 01:14:45.184]  Judas goats are also used to lead other animals to Pacific pens or onto trucks.
[01:14:45.184 --> 01:14:52.029]  They have fallen out of use in recent times, but can still be found in various smaller slaughterhouses in some parts of the world.
[01:14:54.172 --> 01:14:57.193]  Maybe that should be the American flag as a Judas goat leading a bunch of people.
[01:14:57.193 --> 01:15:04.095]  I mean, that's literally... These people are literally scientific predators that study psych warfare and how to rob you and your family.
[01:15:04.095 --> 01:15:04.815]  You understand that?
[01:15:04.815 --> 01:15:07.516]  They're hardcore.
[01:15:07.516 --> 01:15:13.178]  They literally put bug poison in the water and give you seven-fold bone cancer and brain damage.
[01:15:13.178 --> 01:15:17.339]  You like brain cancer at age 35?
[01:15:17.339 --> 01:15:21.540]  We have folks in the office who have family at 30-something dying of brain cancer.
[01:15:23.322 --> 01:15:26.344]  And don't worry, you're going to get yours, because the government loves you.
[01:15:26.344 --> 01:15:27.845]  Hey, look, they're liberal.
[01:15:27.845 --> 01:15:32.727]  There's a bunch of pin-necked women up there with beady eyes telling you how much they love you.
[01:15:32.727 --> 01:15:37.370]  And don't worry, they work for Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, and they're going to take real good care of you.
[01:15:37.370 --> 01:15:41.932]  So roll up your sleeves and take the vaccines, and get ready to start the journey to hell.
[01:15:41.932 --> 01:15:42.373]  Excuse me.
[01:15:42.373 --> 01:15:46.495]  Because Valerie Jarrett said so.
[01:15:46.495 --> 01:15:49.757]  You know what, I said I wanted to play this propaganda clip and then go back to the calls.
[01:15:51.357 --> 01:15:52.897]  The EPA propaganda.
[01:15:52.897 --> 01:16:00.940]  But first, I want to play Sebelius has no comment after hearing Oklahoma's opposition to Obamacare.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:06.322]  And then I want to tie that into Rachel Ray with Biden, making it all about how great his skin looks.
[01:16:06.322 --> 01:16:12.344]  See, it's all about trendiness and just getting you in a giggly, happily suspended disbelief, chump mood.
[01:16:12.344 --> 01:16:13.044]  The Judas Coats.
[01:16:13.809 --> 01:16:16.291]  And oh my gosh, Obama's on The Daily Show!
[01:16:16.291 --> 01:16:17.652]  He's on Colbert!
[01:16:17.652 --> 01:16:19.894]  He's on SportsCenter almost every day!
[01:16:19.894 --> 01:16:21.475]  He's on all the entertainment shows!
[01:16:21.475 --> 01:16:22.756]  Ellen DeGeneres!
[01:16:22.756 --> 01:16:25.458]  Oh my gosh, everybody loves it!
[01:16:25.458 --> 01:16:27.000]  We ought to be so thankful to you!
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.541]  It works perfectly, Obama!
[01:16:28.541 --> 01:16:30.563]  Remember that quote last week?
[01:16:30.563 --> 01:16:31.603]  That's a Judas quote!
[01:16:31.603 --> 01:16:32.504]  Hey goats!
[01:16:32.504 --> 01:16:33.045]  Sheep!
[01:16:33.045 --> 01:16:34.506]  Come on into this pen!
[01:16:34.506 --> 01:16:35.747]  It's really fun in here!
[01:16:38.268 --> 01:16:42.991]  They're like standing out on a rock over hot lava, with a jetpack on, about to take off.
[01:16:42.991 --> 01:16:45.572]  Jump into the red stuff, it feels really good, it's warm.
[01:16:45.572 --> 01:16:48.314]  No, no, don't stick your toe in, jump!
[01:16:48.314 --> 01:16:53.557]  And then you jump in the lava, and Valerie Jarrett and Ellen DeGeneres just jetpack out of there on the private jet.
[01:16:53.557 --> 01:16:55.978]  Ha ha, morons!
[01:16:55.978 --> 01:16:59.980]  I mean, you know, it's just all scientific hatred of you and your family, period.
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:00.741]  And it's working great!
[01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:12.702]  Yeah, but at least, at last check, 64% of Oklahomans aren't buying into the health care plan, they don't like Obamacare, and they've been pretty vocal about it.
[01:17:12.702 --> 01:17:24.132]  Now, that's going to still continue to be a tough sell, but we'll see how that plays out over the coming months.
[01:17:24.132 --> 01:17:27.095]  Alright, Secretary Sebelius, thank you so much for being with us this morning.
[01:17:27.095 --> 01:17:29.617]  I think we've probably lost sound here or something.
[01:17:31.957 --> 01:17:36.179]  And then she goes on in the full clip to say, no, no, I can hear you.
[01:17:36.179 --> 01:17:38.761]  I'm just not going to respond.
[01:17:38.761 --> 01:17:39.981]  We had the full clip this morning.
[01:17:39.981 --> 01:17:43.923]  It's even better in the full clip when she goes, no, I'm getting your audio.
[01:17:43.923 --> 01:17:45.884]  I'm just not responding.
[01:17:45.884 --> 01:17:49.466]  I can hear you.
[01:17:49.466 --> 01:17:50.527]  Thanks for having me.
[01:17:50.527 --> 01:17:51.007]  You're welcome.
[01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:54.451]  See, that's the military way.
[01:17:54.451 --> 01:17:55.632]  It's all scientific.
[01:17:55.632 --> 01:17:57.174]  They do not respond.
[01:17:57.174 --> 01:17:58.956]  When you catch them in a lie, they don't respond.
[01:17:58.956 --> 01:18:07.025]  When you throw an info they can't counter, they do not respond as if you're not even human to make you feel futile, desperate, and weak.
[01:18:07.025 --> 01:18:12.772]  This is how... They never respond to the hoax, to the fact the Federal Reserve is private, the fact that the IRS is a collection agency.
[01:18:13.973 --> 01:18:16.976]  They never respond so you can never have a debate.
[01:18:16.976 --> 01:18:18.819]  It's scientific handbook, folks.
[01:18:18.819 --> 01:18:20.000]  Psych warfare.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:31.092]  Now, let's go to Rachel Ray worshipping Joe Biden, talking about skin creams in association with the rollout of the health care scam.
[01:18:31.092 --> 01:18:34.877]  And I was going to ask you a question, but I got a little nervous because it's a little personal.
[01:18:35.991 --> 01:18:43.741]  I have to ask you though, you have the most glowing, perfect skin of any person I've ever seen.
[01:18:43.741 --> 01:18:46.945]  I really want to know what moisturizer you use.
[01:18:46.945 --> 01:18:49.007]  I love moisturizers.
[01:18:49.007 --> 01:18:51.130]  My husband is a moisturizer as well.
[01:18:51.130 --> 01:18:52.832]  Would you tell me what moisturizer you use?
[01:18:53.945 --> 01:19:07.334]  I mean, this is for women to watch and all feel good and go, well Joe Biden's got moisturizer, and look, I saw Warren Buffett, he was at Dairy Queen again, every time you see him, with an ice cream cone, going raise taxes on rich people.
[01:19:07.334 --> 01:19:09.355]  He means the middle class because he gets their money.
[01:19:09.355 --> 01:19:12.277]  I mean, it is a total, I have an ice cream cone!
[01:19:12.277 --> 01:19:13.898]  Look, I have moisturizer!
[01:19:13.898 --> 01:19:15.539]  I'm friendly, I'm not threatening!
[01:19:17.017 --> 01:19:17.658]  I come!
[01:19:17.658 --> 01:19:19.659]  Look, I'm in the truck, little boy!
[01:19:19.659 --> 01:19:21.400]  Little girl, I have a puppy!
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:22.781]  I have candy!
[01:19:22.781 --> 01:19:23.842]  Candy!
[01:19:23.842 --> 01:19:24.842]  Candy!
[01:19:24.842 --> 01:19:25.843]  Candy!
[01:19:25.843 --> 01:19:26.964]  Candy!
[01:19:26.964 --> 01:19:27.925]  Get in!
[01:19:27.925 --> 01:19:28.985]  Get in!
[01:19:28.985 --> 01:19:30.066]  Get in!
[01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:31.387]  Come on!
[01:19:31.387 --> 01:19:33.609]  I'm a nice old man, Warren Buffett!
[01:19:34.249 --> 01:19:36.931]  We give prizes to good teachers!
[01:19:36.931 --> 01:19:38.932]  Hello!
[01:19:38.932 --> 01:19:41.013]  I'm not creepy or bad.
[01:19:41.013 --> 01:19:44.135]  I'm not the biggest money launderer in North America.
[01:19:44.135 --> 01:19:46.696]  More rich than Carlos Slim.
[01:19:46.696 --> 01:19:50.038]  No, I'm not a money launderer or narcotics trafficker.
[01:19:50.729 --> 01:19:52.791]  I'm Warren Buffett.
[01:19:52.791 --> 01:19:56.834]  I'm an old man who just wants to be friends.
[01:19:56.834 --> 01:20:00.497]  Not a black ops commander for 65 years, ruling operations.
[01:20:00.497 --> 01:20:04.740]  When you need it the most, will your generator, power equipment, or vehicle be ready?
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:12.146]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored, and more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[01:20:12.146 --> 01:20:16.069]  PRI fuel stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[01:20:16.169 --> 01:20:22.153]  Did you know Emergency Essentials has a lowest price promise on all of their long-term food storage and emergency supplies?
[01:20:22.153 --> 01:20:28.077]  This month, while supplies last, save over $250 on the year's supply of Basics, a year's supply of food for only $769.99.

[01:20:46.289 --> 01:20:47.249]  Great news, pure water lovers!

[01:21:50.938 --> 01:21:52.640]  Big Berkey water filters.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.981]  For the love of clean water.
[01:22:00.572 --> 01:22:01.593]  Hi there.
[01:22:01.593 --> 01:22:03.114]  My name is Frank Bates.
[01:22:03.114 --> 01:22:06.936]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[01:22:06.936 --> 01:22:16.082]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[01:22:16.082 --> 01:22:22.787]  Incompetent, lying crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[01:22:22.787 --> 01:22:24.988]  Some have called this a conspiracy.
[01:22:24.988 --> 01:22:30.072]  Others have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[01:22:30.792 --> 01:22:38.737]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them and how you can beat them too.
[01:22:38.737 --> 01:22:44.321]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:22:44.321 --> 01:22:50.825]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect your home.
[01:22:50.825 --> 01:22:56.549]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:22:56.549 --> 01:22:57.810]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[01:22:59.611 --> 01:23:00.652]  The facts are in.
[01:23:00.652 --> 01:23:02.032]  The studies are legion.
[01:23:02.032 --> 01:23:09.515]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:23:09.515 --> 01:23:13.317]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:23:13.317 --> 01:23:13.877]  Simple.
[01:23:13.877 --> 01:23:18.219]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:23:18.559 --> 01:23:24.241]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:23:24.241 --> 01:23:29.722]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[01:23:29.722 --> 01:23:40.485]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:23:40.485 --> 01:23:42.286]  Let's take a stand against the globalists.
[01:23:42.406 --> 01:23:45.009]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:23:45.009 --> 01:23:47.172]  I use Fluoride Shield everyday.
[01:23:47.172 --> 01:23:52.698]  Secure your Fluoride Shield and other pioneering formulations at InfoWarsLife.com today.
[01:23:52.698 --> 01:23:57.063]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Info War at the same time.
[01:23:57.063 --> 01:23:58.846]  That's InfoWarsLife.com
[01:24:05.865 --> 01:24:06.746]  Alex, how are you, man?
[01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:35.451]  Obamacare.
[01:24:35.451 --> 01:24:37.513]  That's just the worst one.
[01:24:37.513 --> 01:24:38.474]  Well, that was racist.
[01:24:38.474 --> 01:24:41.077]  I don't have any proof, but I'm just saying you're racist.
[01:24:41.077 --> 01:24:44.120]  Well, that's fine.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.822]  I self-employed.
[01:24:45.822 --> 01:24:46.723]  I have been for years.
[01:24:46.723 --> 01:24:48.545]  Well, that's racist.
[01:24:48.545 --> 01:24:49.366]  Yep.
[01:24:49.366 --> 01:24:51.087]  And doing my own taxes.
[01:24:51.087 --> 01:24:52.509]  And that wasn't working.
[01:24:52.509 --> 01:24:55.272]  So I talked to a new tax lady this year.
[01:24:56.718 --> 01:25:00.580]  Asked if I had medical insurance, and I said, no, I can't afford it.
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:04.762]  And she said, well, then if you're not going to get it, it's best next year to owe on your taxes.
[01:25:04.762 --> 01:25:08.724]  That way they can't come after your money.
[01:25:08.724 --> 01:25:09.304]  No, that's right.
[01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:13.646]  It's best to pay the $5,000 so they don't get penalties and interest.
[01:25:13.646 --> 01:25:14.306]  Exactly.
[01:25:14.306 --> 01:25:17.127]  But you know how they respond when we talk about the penalty?
[01:25:17.127 --> 01:25:22.610]  They just say it doesn't exist and say that Matt Drudge is a liar because he's opted to pay the fine.
[01:25:23.797 --> 01:25:27.601]  I mean, their response to the sun coming up is to say it didn't come up.
[01:25:27.601 --> 01:25:30.364]  Again, it is a pathological group of liars.
[01:25:30.364 --> 01:25:32.125]  Go ahead.
[01:25:32.125 --> 01:25:40.273]  Well, you're absolutely right, Ben, and all the sheep in this country just follow that and believe that's exactly what it is, and they don't listen to reason.
[01:25:40.273 --> 01:25:43.717]  You know, and the other hoax, we're up here in a natural area of Kansas.
[01:25:44.716 --> 01:25:51.217]  My daughter, seven years old, first grade this year, and the little school she goes to couldn't be better.
[01:25:51.217 --> 01:25:53.778]  I mean, I'm not obviously a fan of public schools.
[01:25:53.778 --> 01:25:57.878]  Oh no, there are fabulous public schools in some rural areas.
[01:25:57.878 --> 01:26:09.761]  And even in some big cities, they just get the right teachers, they all kind of quietly buck the system, and they rebel and actually do a good job by keeping control of the school and by creating a good environment.
[01:26:09.761 --> 01:26:11.181]  There are a lot of good public schools.
[01:26:11.181 --> 01:26:12.101]  I mean, I've got to admit that.
[01:26:13.131 --> 01:26:13.911]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:13.911 --> 01:26:15.252]  This one's the best.
[01:26:15.252 --> 01:26:19.273]  I mean, in your younger grades, you're not allowed to have a boyfriend.
[01:26:19.273 --> 01:26:20.433]  There's none of that.
[01:26:20.433 --> 01:26:21.213]  You're there to learn.
[01:26:21.213 --> 01:26:23.414]  You're there to be a good student.
[01:26:23.414 --> 01:26:25.254]  You don't mess around with any of that kind of stuff.
[01:26:25.254 --> 01:26:25.794]  Well, that's it.
[01:26:25.794 --> 01:26:32.856]  And look, they know in psychology, you either keep incredible discipline on them when they're little, or they're going to turn into absolute maniacs.
[01:26:32.856 --> 01:26:37.658]  What they do is no discipline when they're little, then they act like maniacs later, so you put them all in jail.
[01:26:37.658 --> 01:26:39.098]  Right.
[01:26:39.098 --> 01:26:39.818]  Absolutely.
[01:26:39.818 --> 01:26:42.479]  And so, again, where we live, it is
[01:26:43.493 --> 01:26:45.475]  It's a smaller community.
[01:26:45.475 --> 01:26:46.816]  Everybody knows everybody.
[01:26:46.816 --> 01:26:48.978]  It's a whole lot better place to be.
[01:26:48.978 --> 01:26:51.620]  I mean, not a whole lot to do around here, but you couldn't ask for...
[01:26:52.165 --> 01:26:55.027]  Well, Michael Moore says that people are fleeing to the countryside.
[01:26:55.027 --> 01:27:00.030]  By the way, I see folks, black, white, Hispanic, running the countryside and homeschooling because you're racist.
[01:27:00.030 --> 01:27:08.255]  Remember he said that, you know, gun owners are mainly white and they do it because they're racist, which isn't even really true.
[01:27:08.255 --> 01:27:13.439]  The truth is they're freaking out because demographically minorities and women are the fastest growing group buying guns.
[01:27:14.099 --> 01:27:17.260]  We just got a bunch of the women in the office to go out and shoot.
[01:27:17.260 --> 01:27:19.862]  We've got videos of that coming on the Nightly News this week.
[01:27:19.862 --> 01:27:22.923]  It's our job to get women out and get them shooting.
[01:27:22.923 --> 01:27:26.485]  Because believe me, the real feminist is Annie Oakley, not Gloria Steinem.
[01:27:26.485 --> 01:27:27.225]  Great point, sir.
[01:27:27.225 --> 01:27:27.805]  Good to hear from you.
[01:27:27.805 --> 01:27:28.706]  What do you think the hoax is?
[01:27:28.706 --> 01:27:30.306]  Real fast.
[01:27:30.306 --> 01:27:31.327]  Obamacare?
[01:27:31.327 --> 01:27:31.847]  He dropped off.
[01:27:31.847 --> 01:27:33.108]  I think he was saying Obamacare.
[01:27:33.108 --> 01:27:33.968]  Okay, I gotta move here.
[01:27:33.968 --> 01:27:35.649]  I'm just taking too long.
[01:27:35.649 --> 01:27:37.670]  Let's talk to Rage in New Mexico.
[01:27:37.670 --> 01:27:38.530]  Thanks for holding.
[01:27:38.530 --> 01:27:39.071]  You're on the air.
[01:27:39.071 --> 01:27:40.711]  Go ahead.
[01:27:40.711 --> 01:27:41.312]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:41.312 --> 01:27:41.952]  Thanks for having me.
[01:27:42.907 --> 01:27:46.849]  I just wanted to let you know that the entire state of New Mexico is a hoax.
[01:27:46.849 --> 01:27:49.651]  I am livid at the police state that we've seen.
[01:27:49.651 --> 01:27:54.634]  They've turned our police cars to the DHS requisite black and white.
[01:27:54.634 --> 01:27:58.257]  They have... I trained with SWAT team in a large urban area here.
[01:27:58.257 --> 01:27:59.277]  I can't say which one.
[01:27:59.277 --> 01:28:04.841]  I can tell you that there are $200,000 worth of night vision equipment alone.
[01:28:04.841 --> 01:28:06.942]  Those guys are equipped better than Fallujah.
[01:28:08.058 --> 01:28:10.039]  And they got it all from a DHS grant.
[01:28:10.039 --> 01:28:18.781]  Now we know that DHS favors counties where there's special airborne or drone surveillance, so you can extrapolate what you want from that.
[01:28:18.781 --> 01:28:21.262]  This place is so corrupt, it's unbelievable.
[01:28:21.262 --> 01:28:28.044]  There's more private, unmarked airstrips in the state of New Mexico than anywhere else in the country.
[01:28:28.044 --> 01:28:29.464]  We're right in the corridor.
[01:28:30.569 --> 01:28:38.057]  Half of the art market was initially funded back in the 70s by people mulling coke through this court.
[01:28:38.057 --> 01:28:42.662]  Oh, of course, and the police all over New Mexico famously turn a blind eye to drugs.
[01:28:42.662 --> 01:28:52.072]  But then meanwhile, if they... Remember the guy they kept in jail for two years, who they pulled over drinking and driving, who was kept in a dungeon, and when he was released out of that town, had like a two-foot beard?
[01:28:52.072 --> 01:28:53.133]  Remember that story a few years ago?
[01:28:54.348 --> 01:28:58.689]  Absolutely, and this latest shooting is incomprehensible.
[01:28:58.689 --> 01:29:01.310]  You're a country boy, and I've heard you talk about it a few times.
[01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:07.071]  What happens when you grab it, you find an apple, and it's nasty and brown and dirty, and you leave it in that bowl of fruit.
[01:29:07.071 --> 01:29:12.212]  You come back a couple days later, a couple more pieces of fruit are brown and dirty and nasty, right?
[01:29:12.212 --> 01:29:14.093]  You leave it long enough, what happens to the whole bowl?
[01:29:14.093 --> 01:29:15.093]  The whole thing goes moldy.
[01:29:16.198 --> 01:29:16.638]  Right.
[01:29:16.638 --> 01:29:17.719]  That's what we've got here.
[01:29:17.719 --> 01:29:18.960]  Some very honorable men.
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:26.304]  I'm not going to defame any of the members of SWAT, who I've literally called a bubbler in the middle of helping little old ladies to the hospital.
[01:29:26.304 --> 01:29:27.124]  No, I understand that.
[01:29:27.124 --> 01:29:27.524]  Stay there.
[01:29:27.524 --> 01:29:31.106]  I want you to explain leaving bad apples in the bunch.
[01:29:31.106 --> 01:29:36.389]  And now the bad apples sit up on top and their mold just grows down over a pyramid of people.
[01:29:36.389 --> 01:29:37.910]  And the public's moldy as well.
[01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:38.831]  I mean, the public.
[01:29:40.332 --> 01:29:43.854]  On average, we'll turn their back on you in a second.
[01:29:43.854 --> 01:29:45.736]  And they're drawing police from the public.
[01:29:45.736 --> 01:29:49.539]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:49.539 --> 01:29:50.940]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:53.462]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.462 --> 01:29:56.164]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.498 --> 01:30:06.300]  My friends, Alex Jones here to tell you about some of the most important information concerning you and your family's health.
[01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:13.683]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere from all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents.
[01:30:13.683 --> 01:30:17.024]  Radioactive contamination is now in most of the food supply.
[01:30:17.024 --> 01:30:19.064]  There's only two ways to avoid this.
[01:30:19.064 --> 01:30:23.606]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine.
[01:30:23.706 --> 01:30:26.628]  Looking to protect my family, I've done deep research.
[01:30:26.628 --> 01:30:32.591]  Nascent Iodine is the purest, cleanest, absolute best form of iodine to protect yourself and your family.
[01:30:32.591 --> 01:30:36.253]  It's made right here in the USA, completely non-GMO.
[01:30:36.253 --> 01:30:41.296]  I searched out the best quality and now have developed a double strength form of Nascent Iodine.

[01:30:44.740 --> 01:30:50.727]  Nascent Iodine is on record as one of the only safe ways to detox from fluoride poisoning.

[01:31:00.959 --> 01:31:04.282]  Globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[01:31:04.282 --> 01:31:06.703]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[01:31:06.703 --> 01:31:15.310]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimickers that lower our testosterone and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:23.276]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic
[01:31:23.596 --> 01:31:31.628]  Super male vitality formula sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.

[01:33:17.927 --> 01:33:30.836]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.836 --> 01:33:33.597]  Some of the headlines up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:33.597 --> 01:33:37.420]  Britain to jail parents who don't love their children enough.
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:38.420]  A new form of abuse.
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:41.963]  Don't worry, the state will love them.
[01:33:41.963 --> 01:33:46.406]  Record cleared for suspected boy who turned in toy gun at school.
[01:33:47.748 --> 01:33:53.172]  NATO exploits phantom Russian troop build-up to call for militarizing Eastern Europe.
[01:33:53.172 --> 01:33:59.577]  Bilderberg has been found 2014 CONFAB to take place at Five Star Marriott Hotel in Copenhagen, Denmark.
[01:34:00.968 --> 01:34:03.471]  Some Obama supporters still think it's racist.
[01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:05.193]  That's the quote to oppose Obamacare.
[01:34:05.193 --> 01:34:08.456]  We've got the proof up on Infowars.com.
[01:34:08.456 --> 01:34:12.080]  The Chinese are acquiring large chunks of land and communities all over America.
[01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.302]  The Chinese government, I would add.
[01:34:14.302 --> 01:34:16.084]  Who cares if the Chinese do?
[01:34:16.084 --> 01:34:18.326]  IPCC, doom and gloom.
[01:34:18.326 --> 01:34:21.509]  Global warming apocalypse is political theater, not real science.
[01:34:22.628 --> 01:34:26.951]  And then we have a Paul Craig Roberts headline that's really kind of an understatement of the year.
[01:34:26.951 --> 01:34:28.612]  The Federal Reserve has no integrity.
[01:34:28.612 --> 01:34:33.155]  It has a lot of integrity robbing us and debasing the dollar.
[01:34:33.155 --> 01:34:34.896]  For the globalists, it's an enemy operation.
[01:34:36.385 --> 01:34:48.495]  But going back to the calls, Rage in New Mexico says he works with the SWAT team and has seen the $200,000, just with the department he's in and around, of night vision and the armored vehicles, all of it.
[01:34:48.495 --> 01:34:52.559]  The point is there's an attitude of shoot first, ask questions later.
[01:34:52.559 --> 01:34:54.581]  The system's incredibly corrupt.
[01:34:54.581 --> 01:34:57.723]  In Mexico, we just continue to see so many cases of torture.
[01:34:58.764 --> 01:35:07.569]  Of abuse, of people locked up for two years, no one knows where they are for no reason, no one getting in trouble, and basically everything's justified.
[01:35:07.569 --> 01:35:13.211]  And then after he gets done talking about New Mexico, since he mentioned this, we're going to get into some of that.
[01:35:13.211 --> 01:35:21.035]  And also nearby in Arizona, where the cop runs up and just attacks a woman for no reason, is walking down the street.
[01:35:21.035 --> 01:35:21.916]  That reminded me of the
[01:35:22.836 --> 01:35:28.777]  You know, video, the guy on the bicycle, the cop walks up and knocks off and almost kills, uh, just for no reason.
[01:35:28.777 --> 01:35:30.597]  There's an attack dog mentality.
[01:35:30.597 --> 01:35:36.319]  Uh, and those type of people who just want to randomly attack people.
[01:35:36.319 --> 01:35:38.419]  It's like, it's like folks that have pit bulls.
[01:35:38.419 --> 01:35:42.560]  Not all pit bulls are like this, but some people have pit bulls and, and they attack people.
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:45.320]  I have a friend who got some pit bulls and was rescuing them.
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:48.241]  And I said, listen, you better watch out, man.
[01:35:48.241 --> 01:35:49.441]  One day those things will just bite you.
[01:35:50.956 --> 01:36:02.419]  And one day, the two pit bulls got in a fight, and he tried to separate them, bit his foot almost off his hand, just wrecked him, and then did it again a month later.
[01:36:02.419 --> 01:36:05.440]  First he was going to keep them, and then he was like, no, I think I'm going to get rid of them now.
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:09.501]  And it's the fact that you don't want a mindless pit bull, folks.
[01:36:09.501 --> 01:36:10.801]  That's not what you want in police.
[01:36:11.971 --> 01:36:14.912]  And you certainly don't want them working for the globalists, but side issue.
[01:36:14.912 --> 01:36:16.752]  Let's talk to Rage in New Mexico.
[01:36:16.752 --> 01:36:19.413]  Go ahead and tell your story about the big hoax you want to discuss.
[01:36:19.413 --> 01:36:23.214]  You were saying the state of New Mexico's government is becoming a hoax.
[01:36:23.214 --> 01:36:25.035]  Go ahead and elaborate.
[01:36:25.035 --> 01:36:26.395]  Sure, the entire state's a hoax.
[01:36:26.395 --> 01:36:30.277]  I'm really glad that you've been getting a lot more press focused on New Mexico.
[01:36:30.277 --> 01:36:35.598]  You mentioned the other day that New Mexico Magazine has a background in the very back cover story.
[01:36:35.598 --> 01:36:38.179]  Every month one of these is missing, one of these 50 is missing.
[01:36:38.615 --> 01:36:41.456]  People don't even know we're a state, and that's by design.
[01:36:41.456 --> 01:36:47.979]  But because of what's been going on in the coverage, you've been getting it more than just about any other media outlet that I can find anywhere.
[01:36:47.979 --> 01:36:50.920]  I implore you to send someone out here so I can really debrief you.
[01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:54.202]  You said once that people who really know things don't call in.
[01:36:54.202 --> 01:36:58.543]  They meet you at golf outings or private, you know, events that you're doing.
[01:36:58.543 --> 01:37:00.304]  I don't have the ability to travel.
[01:37:00.304 --> 01:37:01.945]  I have a broken neck and back right now.
[01:37:02.642 --> 01:37:05.384]  I don't really care about my life at this point, Alex.
[01:37:05.384 --> 01:37:06.105]  I don't have a life.
[01:37:06.105 --> 01:37:09.528]  We don't have lives if what I'm about to tell you isn't the truth.
[01:37:09.528 --> 01:37:16.734]  We have politicians and lobbyists who are not just lobbyists, but are paid cover-up artists.
[01:37:16.734 --> 01:37:18.135]  Let me repeat that.
[01:37:18.135 --> 01:37:20.597]  Paid cover-up artists.
[01:37:20.597 --> 01:37:25.901]  If you'll please have one of your guys type agenda-global.com.
[01:37:25.901 --> 01:37:28.583]  Agenda-global.com.
[01:37:28.583 --> 01:37:31.606]  They're a merger of a K Street, Washington,
[01:37:32.256 --> 01:37:35.879]  Lobby firm with a crisis management PR firm.
[01:37:35.879 --> 01:37:39.942]  Go to the bio section of a man named Doug Turner.
[01:37:39.942 --> 01:37:41.143]  Look at his bio.
[01:37:41.143 --> 01:37:44.345]  You'll see he is a term member of the CFR.
[01:37:44.345 --> 01:37:48.528]  You will see that in 2010 he provided strategic communications.
[01:37:48.528 --> 01:37:54.513]  You can read that as cover-up for the Japanese Prime Minister for Fukushima.
[01:37:54.513 --> 01:37:59.897]  But he was also the man responsible for getting the independent governor, Gary Johnson, of New Mexico
[01:38:00.635 --> 01:38:03.637]  In the governor's mansion.
[01:38:03.637 --> 01:38:05.297]  Everything is enmeshed.
[01:38:05.297 --> 01:38:07.298]  Nothing is what it seems.
[01:38:07.298 --> 01:38:09.580]  This is the CIA's playground.
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:11.320]  It is drug central.
[01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:14.222]  People have a ton of money and none of them are ever busted.
[01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:16.063]  None of them are ever touched.
[01:38:16.063 --> 01:38:19.204]  The cops are even good men.
[01:38:19.204 --> 01:38:28.209]  When they're in a group of 20 or 30, like I've seen, will shoot or will do exactly what they're told because they're trained to follow orders.
[01:38:28.209 --> 01:38:30.230]  Independently, they're amazing men.
[01:38:30.791 --> 01:38:34.513]  Incredible men of integrity who I would want on my side any day.
[01:38:34.513 --> 01:38:37.234]  You put them in a group of 20?
[01:38:37.234 --> 01:38:42.156]  And you take the Judas Code and you turn it into one of those pitbulls you were just talking about?
[01:38:42.156 --> 01:38:46.739]  And Alex, you have a hurt mentality and an LT who says, engage.
[01:38:46.739 --> 01:38:50.901]  If someone jumps out and he's unarmed and says, bang, bang, are you going to stop the fight?
[01:38:50.901 --> 01:38:53.042]  Excuse my language.
[01:38:53.042 --> 01:38:53.642]  Heck no.
[01:38:54.534 --> 01:39:01.138]  Well that's what's going on is the militarization of police, and military kill people and break things, they attack an enemy.
[01:39:01.138 --> 01:39:13.485]  So the entire rules of engagement are being changed because the ruling class deals the drugs, they launder the money, they run the high-end prostitution, the whole thing.
[01:39:13.485 --> 01:39:19.208]  And now it wants to get rid of the larger economy because it's threatened by anyone else having wealth.
[01:39:20.396 --> 01:39:21.377]  It's incredible.
[01:39:21.377 --> 01:39:26.681]  Sir, send us an email to showtipsandinfowars.com, or you can give us your number.
[01:39:26.681 --> 01:39:29.623]  And David Knight's been doing a lot of coverage of New Mexico.
[01:39:29.623 --> 01:39:33.967]  My issue is, I know about the corruption in different zones.
[01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:36.329]  I'm aware of it.
[01:39:36.329 --> 01:39:39.091]  And it's all fueled by the drug war.
[01:39:39.091 --> 01:39:41.292]  That's why they made drugs illegal back in the 30s.
[01:39:41.292 --> 01:39:45.536]  After alcohol was made legal again, they had to have something that was illegal.
[01:39:46.966 --> 01:39:48.947]  Almost no one was using drugs then.
[01:39:48.947 --> 01:39:52.509]  You could buy anything you wanted at the drugstore on record.
[01:39:52.509 --> 01:39:58.193]  And then they made it illegal, then they mixed it in, made it flashy in the movies, made it flashy in the culture.
[01:39:58.193 --> 01:40:02.676]  There was huge profits in it now that it was illegal.
[01:40:02.676 --> 01:40:07.258]  And they were able to take over our society with it.
[01:40:07.258 --> 01:40:09.820]  And now we have paramilitary police running around.
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:18.699]  Who literally think that you are an Iraqi in Fallujah if you question a checkpoint on a highway?
[01:40:20.584 --> 01:40:26.527]  And they're only being put into this mindset because there is a total takeover of civilization happening.
[01:40:26.527 --> 01:40:34.410]  Agenda 21 is going to jack up all the power prices, all the energy prices, all the transportation prices, all the jobs are going to be herded through them.
[01:40:34.410 --> 01:40:36.832]  In fact, let's get that clip ready and I'm going back to calls.
[01:40:36.832 --> 01:40:42.814]  This is a new EPA propaganda commercial targeting children demonizing wood smoke.
[01:40:42.814 --> 01:40:43.635]  Folks, wood smoke
[01:40:44.415 --> 01:40:47.597]  is on record to go out and to fertilize fields.
[01:40:47.597 --> 01:40:51.580]  It's on record associated with more rainfall going up in the atmosphere.
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:54.221]  There's always been wood smoke, nitrogen.
[01:40:54.221 --> 01:40:56.342]  It's part of the carbon cycle on the planet.
[01:40:56.342 --> 01:40:58.484]  It's good.
[01:40:58.484 --> 01:41:01.085]  And there is a war on real sustainability.
[01:41:01.085 --> 01:41:10.031]  When you hear the word sustainable from mainstream media, they mean shutting you off, not letting you have your own off-the-grid power supply, not letting you have a well.
[01:41:10.031 --> 01:41:12.833]  It means you're on the government system living in a
[01:41:13.638 --> 01:41:18.581]  You know, 20-story high-rise, 50-story high-rise doing what they say.
[01:41:18.581 --> 01:41:21.062]  Totally unsustainable.
[01:41:21.062 --> 01:41:28.325]  And then we had the lawyer on from Florida where they're trying to stop the woman who legally and lawfully has a well on her own rural property and her own power.
[01:41:28.325 --> 01:41:31.167]  And they did a news story about her, so the zoning department came out.
[01:41:31.167 --> 01:41:35.149]  This is global zoning written to shut you down.
[01:41:37.148 --> 01:41:39.789]  And they're coming after the wood stoves.
[01:41:39.789 --> 01:41:43.710]  San Francisco's trying to pass laws to tax fireplaces, just if you have one.
[01:41:43.710 --> 01:41:49.771]  Inspectors come in, you wall it up, or you pay a fine.
[01:41:49.771 --> 01:41:51.552]  You understand that?
[01:41:51.552 --> 01:41:52.292]  This isn't a game.
[01:41:52.292 --> 01:41:55.113]  And I tell people this on air, and they go, man, you're making that up.
[01:41:55.113 --> 01:41:59.794]  Folks, they've already banned new fireplaces and homes six, seven years ago in Germany.
[01:42:03.499 --> 01:42:06.080]  My parents live in a house built in the thirties back when it was cold.
[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:06.820]  We go through cycles.
[01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.540]  It's getting cold again.
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:10.020]  Every room.
[01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:14.361]  I've seen some old houses where the bathrooms have little fireplaces.
[01:42:14.361 --> 01:42:16.382]  Because that's how you heated your house.
[01:42:16.382 --> 01:42:20.083]  And the point is it's already going extinct like cash, but they want to get rid of it.
[01:42:20.083 --> 01:42:21.603]  They want us as prisoners.
[01:42:21.603 --> 01:42:26.644]  Here is this EPA propaganda commercial targeting children.
[01:42:26.644 --> 01:42:30.485]  Smoke from wood stoves and fireplaces can make you sick.
[01:42:31.041 --> 01:42:38.107]  Wood smoke can give you a stuffy nose, make your eyes water, and even make you cough.
[01:42:38.107 --> 01:42:40.369]  It can also cause an asthma attack.
[01:42:40.369 --> 01:42:44.173]  My grandma replaced her wood stove because I have asthma.
[01:42:44.173 --> 01:42:46.875]  I'm happy that I can breathe better.
[01:42:46.875 --> 01:42:51.940]  To help protect your health and the health of loved ones, find ways to reduce wood smoke.
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:54.382]  Go to epa.gov slash burnwise.
[01:42:54.382 --> 01:42:56.904]  Alright, just like
[01:42:58.410 --> 01:43:01.772]  We've seen a 3,000% increase in type 2 diabetes.
[01:43:01.772 --> 01:43:05.035]  That's in the general public and Hispanics is even higher.
[01:43:05.035 --> 01:43:07.357]  The numbers are by 2025, half the U.S.
[01:43:07.357 --> 01:43:15.502]  will have type 2 diabetes and something like 70 plus percent, you can look it up, the numbers vary, of Hispanics will have it.
[01:43:15.502 --> 01:43:17.584]  There's no discussion of why is everybody getting this.
[01:43:19.588 --> 01:43:20.409]  Different additives.
[01:43:20.409 --> 01:43:24.312]  One thing linked to destroying your pancreas and making you obese and giving you cancer.
[01:43:24.312 --> 01:43:26.974]  I saw CBS News today reporting on it.
[01:43:26.974 --> 01:43:27.755]  Is aspartame.
[01:43:27.755 --> 01:43:30.237]  It's in almost every major processed food now.
[01:43:30.237 --> 01:43:31.498]  Not just gum.
[01:43:31.498 --> 01:43:34.721]  Sugar gum has it.
[01:43:34.721 --> 01:43:36.242]  It's highly addictive.
[01:43:36.242 --> 01:43:37.203]  It's wood alcohol.
[01:43:37.203 --> 01:43:38.404]  It's 88 degrees.
[01:43:38.404 --> 01:43:40.666]  Your body's 98 plus.
[01:43:40.666 --> 01:43:41.607]  Breaks down to wood alcohol.
[01:43:41.607 --> 01:43:42.408]  That's what makes you go blind.
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:50.243]  There's no discussion for these kids about why is asthma up multi-thousand percentage points, the GMO, the allergies.
[01:43:50.243 --> 01:43:55.665]  There's no discussion of why you had much less allergies back in the years when everybody had wood-burning stoves.
[01:43:55.665 --> 01:43:56.425]  No.
[01:43:56.425 --> 01:44:02.028]  And of course now wood-burning stoves will trigger allergies with people because you're already so overwhelmed.
[01:44:02.028 --> 01:44:06.009]  You're already so screwed up.
[01:44:06.009 --> 01:44:10.551]  There's a phenomenon now where people I know that own a few acres in Austin here and there,
[01:44:11.567 --> 01:44:19.889]  Where it's been built up now, formerly the other town, their neighbors call the police on them, even when there's no burn ban, when they have a campfire in their backyard.
[01:44:19.889 --> 01:44:23.610]  That's the nanny state, folks.
[01:44:23.610 --> 01:44:25.171]  That's the nanny state in America.
[01:44:25.171 --> 01:44:26.371]  In fact, I'll go ahead and say it.
[01:44:26.371 --> 01:44:27.752]  It's my parents.
[01:44:27.752 --> 01:44:33.293]  They live on four acres in the middle of Austin that they bought back in the early 90s.
[01:44:33.293 --> 01:44:35.474]  And they're building condos all around them, you name it.
[01:44:36.642 --> 01:44:40.366]  And it's like heaven over there, they got a pool, whole nine yards.
[01:44:40.366 --> 01:44:43.550]  And the neighbors just call the police all the time, different ones.
[01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:47.434]  Oh, you're having a fire out by Christmas, people standing around.
[01:44:47.434 --> 01:44:50.137]  You know, out by the pool, got a fire pit, call the police.
[01:44:50.137 --> 01:44:53.381]  Your kids are yelling, shooting each other water guns, call the police.
[01:44:53.381 --> 01:44:55.783]  Pop firecrackers in the driveway, call the police.
[01:44:55.783 --> 01:44:57.926]  This is a cult of sick freaks everywhere.
[01:44:59.209 --> 01:45:02.631]  Now, to the police's credit, when they show up, they go, yeah, your neighbor calls you.
[01:45:02.631 --> 01:45:03.951]  I mean, everybody's popping firecrackers.
[01:45:03.951 --> 01:45:05.312]  I don't see an issue.
[01:45:05.312 --> 01:45:06.313]  You know, there's an ordinance.
[01:45:06.313 --> 01:45:09.214]  I don't see any firecrackers, pieces of them laying around everywhere.
[01:45:09.214 --> 01:45:10.295]  Uh, see you later.
[01:45:10.295 --> 01:45:14.217]  Uh, yeah, your neighbor says some of them sound like they're being killed over here.
[01:45:14.217 --> 01:45:17.238]  I can see it's people's kids swimming.
[01:45:17.238 --> 01:45:19.660]  Okay, uh, have a nice day.
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:22.941]  Uh, you know, oh, I see you got a fire.
[01:45:22.941 --> 01:45:23.522]  Nice fire.
[01:45:23.522 --> 01:45:24.982]  It's like you're having a good time.
[01:45:24.982 --> 01:45:26.023]  You know, there's no burn ban.
[01:45:26.023 --> 01:45:27.544]  This neighbor thought your house was on fire.
[01:45:28.993 --> 01:45:31.634]  It's not one bad neighbor doing it.
[01:45:31.634 --> 01:45:32.894]  It's all the neighbors.
[01:45:32.894 --> 01:45:34.655]  It's what you do in America.
[01:45:34.655 --> 01:45:38.476]  Look, there's weirdos with a fire pit.
[01:45:38.476 --> 01:45:39.516]  With a two-foot fire.
[01:45:39.516 --> 01:45:42.657]  Call the police on them.
[01:45:42.657 --> 01:45:43.417]  An oak fire.
[01:45:43.417 --> 01:45:44.677]  Hardly even any smoke.
[01:45:44.677 --> 01:45:45.637]  Call the police on them.
[01:45:45.637 --> 01:45:47.998]  There's some weirdos out there.
[01:45:47.998 --> 01:45:51.279]  They yell and laugh.
[01:45:51.279 --> 01:45:53.240]  Look, that one probably has red blood.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:54.320]  Call the police immediately.
[01:45:56.479 --> 01:45:57.460]  I'm going to go back to your calls.
[01:45:57.460 --> 01:46:01.262]  It's just, it's total freak land, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:01.262 --> 01:46:02.182]  It's total freak land.
[01:46:02.182 --> 01:46:10.427]  And then, you know, we got a place out in the country, just nine acres, ten acres, I guess, nine and a half acres.
[01:46:10.427 --> 01:46:14.449]  All the neighbors get the police called on them, because there's like a 200 acre ranch on one side, 100 acre next.
[01:46:14.449 --> 01:46:16.390]  I talk to the neighbors.
[01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:22.954]  Invariably, I'll see the neighbors out shooting on their own shooting range over the fence, up on the hill, across the hill from us.
[01:46:22.954 --> 01:46:24.755]  Invariably, I see the state police pull up, you know.
[01:46:27.346 --> 01:46:28.086]  Doesn't matter you have 200 acres.
[01:46:28.086 --> 01:46:29.187]  Doesn't matter you had it for 100 years.
[01:46:29.187 --> 01:46:29.847]  Doesn't matter.
[01:46:29.847 --> 01:46:33.630]  Because the neighbors from California are G-O-D.
[01:46:33.630 --> 01:46:35.691]  Capital G-O-D.
[01:46:35.691 --> 01:46:36.831]  They rule!
[01:46:36.831 --> 01:46:38.412]  They rule everything!
[01:46:38.412 --> 01:46:40.333]  They are the power!
[01:46:40.333 --> 01:46:42.215]  And they will destroy your freedom.
[01:46:42.215 --> 01:46:43.615]  They will take your kids.
[01:46:43.615 --> 01:46:45.296]  They will wreck everything.
[01:46:45.296 --> 01:46:47.137]  Because they love government.
[01:46:47.137 --> 01:46:48.358]  They love Obama.
[01:46:48.358 --> 01:46:49.439]  They love hoaxes.
[01:46:49.439 --> 01:46:50.479]  They love frauds.
[01:46:50.479 --> 01:46:51.560]  They love scams.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:52.581]  They love poverty.
[01:46:52.581 --> 01:46:53.601]  They love failure.
[01:46:53.601 --> 01:46:55.782]  They love lies.
[01:46:55.782 --> 01:46:56.543]  They love their father.
[01:46:57.659 --> 01:47:03.060]  I'll go to your phone calls, but I first have to say this.
[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:08.721]  All I know is we've got to get back to being humans and not acting like total cowards.
[01:47:08.721 --> 01:47:16.943]  That's all I know.
[01:47:16.943 --> 01:47:18.664]  Briefly, that's an hour and 47 minutes in.
[01:47:18.664 --> 01:47:20.344]  I haven't plugged any products or anything yet.
[01:47:20.344 --> 01:47:21.744]  That's how we fund the operation.
[01:47:21.744 --> 01:47:23.585]  I try to bring in the very best products.
[01:47:23.585 --> 01:47:23.925]  The pro
[01:47:25.117 --> 01:47:32.141]  Pure 2.0 systems are the best gravity-fed filters you can get that cut out the glyphosates, the fluoride, everything else.
[01:47:32.141 --> 01:47:33.902]  There's nothing even close to it.
[01:47:33.902 --> 01:47:35.863]  That's why I don't sell the other big gravity-fed filters.
[01:47:35.863 --> 01:47:38.685]  I can sell them all and make more money to fund the operation.
[01:47:38.685 --> 01:47:40.846]  If something was close, I would sell it.
[01:47:40.846 --> 01:47:45.689]  Now, we've got some life straws and stuff that are good to just make it safe out in the middle of nowhere and stuff that are excellent.
[01:47:45.689 --> 01:47:48.891]  We've got a bunch of other systems like that, but you cannot beat the Pro Pure 2.0.
[01:47:53.888 --> 01:47:56.409]  And we've got the full selection, the lowest price anywhere.
[01:47:56.409 --> 01:48:01.070]  I had to really twist arms to let them even let me sell it, but 10% off of Promo Code Water.
[01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:05.152]  It's already the lowest advertisable price, then you add the 10% off.
[01:48:05.152 --> 01:48:08.753]  No one can top the prices we have on these filters.
[01:48:08.753 --> 01:48:15.335]  They have a picture system that has the filter and it's only 60 bucks, actually less, that no one can counter.
[01:48:15.335 --> 01:48:15.935]  No one.
[01:48:15.935 --> 01:48:20.316]  Okay, it is the best deal out there, ladies and gentlemen, for $54.95.
[01:48:22.813 --> 01:48:26.315]  I mean, a Brita filter cost, that doesn't cut basically anything out but bad taste.
[01:48:26.315 --> 01:48:27.576]  This cuts it all out.
[01:48:27.576 --> 01:48:32.579]  Look at the side-by-side comparisons, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:48:32.579 --> 01:48:36.061]  Guess I did plug the magazine earlier, but that doesn't count, because that's at cost.
[01:48:36.061 --> 01:48:39.943]  You get the word out, new magazine's out as well, it's an excellent issue, the war on women.
[01:48:39.943 --> 01:48:43.965]  Those are available in bulk at cost at InfoWarsStore.com, or call toll-free, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:48:52.438 --> 01:49:12.891]  And we have InfoWarsLife.com, where you've got all the estrogen mimickers, and my personal trainer said, man, I hear all this hype, you say the Super Bowl Vitality's so great, and he's like a real sports, you know, enthusiast, power lifter, you name it, you know, natural lifter, and he said, I'm gonna take some.
[01:49:12.891 --> 01:49:15.052]  Week and a half later, he says, it's incredible.
[01:49:15.052 --> 01:49:20.596]  It's the clarity, the stamina, the, I mean, really what it is is a mood issue for most people.

[01:49:38.418 --> 01:49:42.399]  Turns blue on paper, not black like regular so-called nascent iodine.
[01:49:42.399 --> 01:49:49.941]  And just what it's done for Shane Steiner, who again kind of rolled his eyes, said, okay, I'm sure it's okay, but I've taken every supplement, you know, I just don't think you need them.
[01:49:49.941 --> 01:49:51.262]  I said, fine, we'll try this.
[01:49:51.262 --> 01:49:54.023]  And he is totally blown away.
[01:49:54.023 --> 01:49:54.763]  Totally blown away.
[01:49:54.763 --> 01:49:57.584]  In fact, they have, you guys want to get the new one where he tried to rip up on it, what it did?
[01:49:58.886 --> 01:49:59.667]  We have the new one.

[01:50:20.944 --> 01:50:22.025]  We've also got
[01:50:23.166 --> 01:50:29.127]  The Bank of America coffee, my favorite type of coffee from southern Mexico up in the high mountains, volcanic soil.
[01:50:29.127 --> 01:50:31.247]  All of this funds the operation.

[01:51:30.362 --> 01:51:31.723]  Attention gun owners.
[01:51:31.723 --> 01:51:36.525]  It's reasonable to assume that at some point you may need to defend your family from an armed attack.
[01:51:36.525 --> 01:51:40.246]  But is it reasonable to mount a defense without a strong offense?
[01:51:40.246 --> 01:51:42.607]  Infidel Body Armor goes on in seconds.

[01:52:57.288 --> 01:53:10.175]  MyPatriotsupply.com In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:53:10.175 --> 01:53:12.016]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[01:53:12.236 --> 01:53:13.117]  Fluoride.
[01:53:13.117 --> 01:53:15.518]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:53:15.518 --> 01:53:21.562]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:53:21.562 --> 01:53:26.466]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record.
[01:53:26.466 --> 01:53:32.750]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:35.152]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:53:35.152 --> 01:53:38.054]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[01:53:38.054 --> 01:53:41.416]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:53:41.536 --> 01:53:46.938]  You'll find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:53:56.101 --> 01:53:57.662]  There's a gun and ammunition just inside the doorway.
[01:54:15.205 --> 01:54:16.906]  Dick Gregory's coming up at the 8 after.
[01:54:16.906 --> 01:54:19.788]  I want to go right back to your calls.
[01:54:19.788 --> 01:54:22.090]  Tom in New Mexico, what do you think the big hoaxes are?
[01:54:22.090 --> 01:54:25.612]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:54:25.612 --> 01:54:27.453]  Hey, buddy.
[01:54:27.453 --> 01:54:33.558]  Hey, um, I think one of the biggest hoaxes out here in New Mexico is the police department's here to protect and serve you.
[01:54:33.558 --> 01:54:41.183]  They're nothing more than city-issued thugs and assassins who serve the governor to create new revenue for the state, which in turn makes revenue for the government.
[01:54:42.017 --> 01:55:00.826]  And they wonder why the local, you know, gang members out here are teaming up with the students and some online hacking crew called Anonymous to try to secure lists of all city, state, and government employees and their home addresses, you know.
[01:55:00.826 --> 01:55:05.908]  And, you know, I guess for retaliation, you know.
[01:55:06.684 --> 01:55:11.788]  Well, I don't know what the government thinks it's going to do when a civil war actually breaks out in this country.
[01:55:11.788 --> 01:55:17.932]  And I'm not looking forward to a civil war because there's a lot of nasty elements across the board, but that is all the recipes that are there.
[01:55:17.932 --> 01:55:25.978]  And they're gearing up for it because they believe it's going to happen, and they believe they're going to win some war with the American people.
[01:55:25.978 --> 01:55:32.702]  But again, it's not like all the departments are bad across the country, so it's really going to be a disastrous situation.
[01:55:32.702 --> 01:55:33.523]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:55:34.835 --> 01:55:38.239]  I think New Mexicans are openly talking about it right now.
[01:55:38.239 --> 01:55:45.328]  And the census seems to be that they're just going to rush home to home and shoot them in the head.
[01:55:45.328 --> 01:55:46.750]  And that will be the end of it.
[01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:49.554]  Like purging the whole city like that movie.
[01:55:49.554 --> 01:55:50.175]  You know?
[01:55:50.175 --> 01:55:52.538]  Just quick, slam down, thank you ma'am, over.
[01:55:53.976 --> 01:56:04.003]  Well, you know, the police shouldn't be out executing the general public, and I don't think the public should just go out and execute everyone just because they're in the government.
[01:56:04.003 --> 01:56:07.246]  But once the Civil War starts, that is what's going to happen.
[01:56:07.246 --> 01:56:10.568]  I appreciate your call.
[01:56:10.568 --> 01:56:14.191]  Folks, if something like that happened, that would give the moral high ground of the system.
[01:56:16.556 --> 01:56:25.425]  I'm getting so many calls from New Mexico and I'm getting so many emails and people are freaking out over the way the police are there.
[01:56:25.425 --> 01:56:34.954]  And it's not just them shooting this homeless guy and then letting the police dog chew on his dead body and all the rest of it.
[01:56:34.954 --> 01:56:37.837]  You don't know where this thing's going to blow.
[01:56:37.837 --> 01:56:40.920]  And the public knows, because there's so many veterans in these groups,
[01:56:42.401 --> 01:56:45.463]  They're not going to go out and protest so the riot cops can beat everybody up.
[01:56:45.463 --> 01:56:54.568]  People, that's how Westerners tend to protest historically is they go out like the Minutemen and start shooting people.
[01:56:54.568 --> 01:57:05.235]  And the government's lined up saying we're the enemy and they're preparing to create that self-fulfilling process and it's going to wreck the country and I just don't want it to happen.
[01:57:06.428 --> 01:57:07.348]  Okay?
[01:57:07.348 --> 01:57:14.330]  And I mean, you know, the average random cop doesn't deserve to be shot any more than the average person deserves to be shot.
[01:57:14.330 --> 01:57:17.551]  See this mentality where the people are the enemy and the police are the enemy?
[01:57:17.551 --> 01:57:19.632]  This is a disaster.
[01:57:19.632 --> 01:57:22.633]  And the globalists are going to sit offshore and laugh at it.
[01:57:22.633 --> 01:57:24.673]  So there's got to be some way to stop this.
[01:57:24.673 --> 01:57:26.474]  Anthony in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:57:26.474 --> 01:57:26.834]  Go ahead.
[01:57:26.834 --> 01:57:27.294]  Thanks for holding.
[01:57:28.659 --> 01:57:29.280]  Oh, hi.
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:32.843]  I'll tell you, I'm in the city of Philadelphia.
[01:57:32.843 --> 01:57:38.487]  You know, we're opposed to freedom, but you don't have no freedom to choose with this Obamacare.
[01:57:38.487 --> 01:57:39.868]  They take away all your freedom.
[01:57:39.868 --> 01:57:42.771]  I guess they want to bankrupt you.
[01:57:42.771 --> 01:57:43.271]  Well, that's it.
[01:57:43.271 --> 01:57:45.533]  I mean, how could foreign banks conquer America?
[01:57:45.533 --> 01:57:49.776]  With fake health care, where they run our health care, and they get to charge us whatever they want.
[01:57:49.776 --> 01:57:50.717]  That's being conquered.
[01:57:50.717 --> 01:57:51.478]  That's being usurped.
[01:57:53.925 --> 01:57:54.865]  Yeah, pretty soon.
[01:57:54.865 --> 01:58:01.067]  I'll tell you, if they just do this one thing and they succeed with this, then they'll figure out something else to do with you.
[01:58:01.067 --> 01:58:04.788]  Well, Obamacare is the place to draw the line in the sand and not comply.
[01:58:04.788 --> 01:58:06.768]  I'm not complying with it.
[01:58:06.768 --> 01:58:09.369]  I'm not even paying the fine.
[01:58:09.369 --> 01:58:10.549]  And I'm just going to battle it.
[01:58:10.549 --> 01:58:11.949]  I mean, this is the thing to battle on.
[01:58:11.949 --> 01:58:13.450]  And you just said it, sir.
[01:58:13.450 --> 01:58:14.970]  There's the issue, Anthony.
[01:58:14.970 --> 01:58:16.750]  If they can do this, they can do anything.
[01:58:16.750 --> 01:58:20.071]  What do they think of us, that they'd pass a law like this?
[01:58:20.071 --> 01:58:23.032]  Well, we know they're buying armored vehicles and training the police for war.
[01:58:23.976 --> 01:58:24.737]  And training the U.S.
[01:58:24.737 --> 01:58:26.057]  Army for war.
[01:58:26.057 --> 01:58:28.019]  They're planning on breaking this country.
[01:58:28.019 --> 01:58:31.221]  And we better reach out to police and military and decompartmentalize them.
[01:58:31.221 --> 01:58:33.042]  Anything else, Anthony?
[01:58:33.042 --> 01:58:33.783]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:33.783 --> 01:58:34.363]  Stay there.
[01:58:34.363 --> 01:58:35.084]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:58:35.084 --> 01:58:36.665]  I want to hear your other hoaxes.
[01:58:36.665 --> 01:58:37.825]  But Obamacare is your big hoax.
[01:58:37.825 --> 01:58:43.249]  I'm going to go to William and others.
[01:58:43.249 --> 01:58:47.212]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:51.741]  The facts are in.
[01:58:51.741 --> 01:58:53.142]  The studies are legion.
[01:58:53.142 --> 01:59:00.647]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people.
[01:59:00.647 --> 01:59:04.469]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:59:04.469 --> 01:59:05.050]  Simple.
[01:59:05.050 --> 01:59:09.373]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[01:59:09.753 --> 01:59:15.476]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[01:59:15.476 --> 01:59:21.019]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWars Life Fluoride Shield Formulation.
[01:59:21.019 --> 01:59:31.825]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:59:31.825 --> 01:59:33.626]  Let's take a stand against the globalist.
[01:59:33.786 --> 01:59:36.387]  By blocking their poisons with Fluoride Shield.
[01:59:36.387 --> 01:59:38.548]  I use Fluoride Shield every day.

[01:59:53.613 --> 01:59:56.014]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.014 --> 01:59:58.775]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.595 --> 02:00:10.418]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.418 --> 02:00:11.999]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.999 --> 02:00:13.560]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:17.743]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.743 --> 02:00:24.328]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.328 --> 02:00:28.230]  Obamacare does double prices within the first two years.
[02:00:28.230 --> 02:00:33.133]  It's projected to quadruple many premiums within the next six.
[02:00:33.133 --> 02:00:34.254]  You're seeing that happen.
[02:00:34.254 --> 02:00:35.235]  The numbers don't lie.
[02:00:36.874 --> 02:00:41.035]  The question is, how do they think they're going to get away with something this evil?
[02:00:41.035 --> 02:00:44.316]  As people learn what it really does.
[02:00:44.316 --> 02:00:49.057]  And a lot of people don't have the money to pay the fine, to pay the interest.
[02:00:49.057 --> 02:00:53.638]  And then you can't even really get the health care and now it's making the price go up because you've got to buy it.
[02:00:53.638 --> 02:00:55.918]  What do you think is going to happen with a commodity you've got to buy?
[02:00:55.918 --> 02:00:56.719]  It's going to go up in price.
[02:00:56.719 --> 02:00:58.799]  And that's happening.
[02:00:58.799 --> 02:01:00.259]  It's real sad.
[02:01:00.259 --> 02:01:02.260]  And it's meant to bankrupt this country.
[02:01:03.735 --> 02:01:05.156]  Bankers run this country.
[02:01:05.156 --> 02:01:06.837]  Not your local banker.
[02:01:06.837 --> 02:01:08.058]  The kleptocratic bankers.
[02:01:08.058 --> 02:01:09.579]  So, what do they want to do?
[02:01:09.579 --> 02:01:12.141]  They want to get you bankrupt.
[02:01:12.141 --> 02:01:15.243]  Let's go ahead and let Anthony finish his point from Pennsylvania.
[02:01:15.243 --> 02:01:17.424]  What was your other point, sir?
[02:01:17.424 --> 02:01:17.985]  Uh, yeah.
[02:01:17.985 --> 02:01:19.886]  I had my house broken into.
[02:01:19.886 --> 02:01:21.507]  And two guys broke into my house.
[02:01:21.507 --> 02:01:22.688]  And I had a gun.
[02:01:22.688 --> 02:01:23.889]  And I told them I said, I have a gun.
[02:01:23.889 --> 02:01:25.250]  And they started laughing at me.
[02:01:25.250 --> 02:01:26.531]  I started shooting at them.
[02:01:26.531 --> 02:01:26.971]  Good.
[02:01:26.971 --> 02:01:28.752]  When the police came here.
[02:01:28.752 --> 02:01:31.134]  Here, who do you think they took the gun off of?
[02:01:31.134 --> 02:01:31.774]  Me.
[02:01:31.774 --> 02:01:32.815]  They took my gun away.
[02:01:34.821 --> 02:01:36.942]  Did you ever get your gun back?
[02:01:36.942 --> 02:01:37.642]  Yes, I will.
[02:01:37.642 --> 02:01:40.963]  I'll have to go down to court and eventually I'll get my gun back.
[02:01:40.963 --> 02:01:47.905]  Yeah, the word is on that, when states do that, it takes up to two years to get it back, when you use the gun to defend yourself.
[02:01:47.905 --> 02:01:49.065]  What happened to the thugs?
[02:01:49.065 --> 02:01:51.466]  Too bad you missed, or what happened?
[02:01:51.466 --> 02:01:54.947]  They got out, but I fired off about small shots at them.
[02:01:54.947 --> 02:01:55.827]  Yeah, I hear you, man.
[02:01:55.827 --> 02:01:57.588]  I tell you, boy, let me tell you.
[02:01:57.588 --> 02:02:00.729]  Somebody comes around, comes to my house, they are gonna be dead.
[02:02:02.062 --> 02:02:03.663]  Because they are a threat to my life.
[02:02:03.663 --> 02:02:08.965]  I'm going to shoot into the center of mass until I feel safe.
[02:02:08.965 --> 02:02:12.146]  And that's the bottom line to deter these people.
[02:02:12.146 --> 02:02:14.026]  And that's happening in places like Detroit.
[02:02:14.026 --> 02:02:17.328]  And it's making the crime rate actually go down for the first time in five years.
[02:02:17.328 --> 02:02:19.809]  Because the police chief did the right thing and said, buy guns.
[02:02:19.809 --> 02:02:23.130]  The Interpol chief said, buy guns.
[02:02:23.130 --> 02:02:24.610]  That's what deters crime.
[02:02:24.610 --> 02:02:27.911]  But most of those countries in Europe, you can't even get guns.
[02:02:27.911 --> 02:02:28.512]  Unbelievable.
[02:02:28.512 --> 02:02:29.132]  Thank you, Anthony.
[02:02:31.638 --> 02:02:35.842]  William in North Carolina, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:02:35.842 --> 02:02:37.604]  Hi Alex, great show today.
[02:02:37.604 --> 02:02:38.405]  Thank you, brother.
[02:02:38.405 --> 02:02:56.162]  I have the hoax of the millennium, and that is the British-influenced twisting and destruction of our rule of law that caused the people to believe that our primary tool for managing this government that we have created is the vote.
[02:02:57.856 --> 02:03:00.057]  And that's not the only primary tool we have.
[02:03:00.057 --> 02:03:03.139]  Isn't it really the jury and the grand jury?
[02:03:03.139 --> 02:03:11.524]  It's the grand jury is the primary act-by-act management.
[02:03:11.524 --> 02:03:17.627]  In other words, micromanagement of the government is done through the grand jury.
[02:03:17.627 --> 02:03:18.828]  No, that's right.
[02:03:18.828 --> 02:03:23.991]  That's how the citizens are in charge of the law, the judges, and have the ultimate veto.
[02:03:25.319 --> 02:03:32.205]  And now the grand juries have been turned into kept slaves of the prosecutors in the state.
[02:03:32.205 --> 02:03:39.411]  Here's how the rule of law tells us that this is all happening.
[02:03:39.411 --> 02:03:52.222]  Article 34 of the Magna Carta, where the due process comes from, which is the rule of law, says that no office of government can cause a free man, you and me,
[02:03:53.194 --> 02:03:59.657]  To lose our choice over the use of our life, liberty, and property.
[02:03:59.657 --> 02:04:01.678]  I know.
[02:04:01.678 --> 02:04:03.299]  That's what it says.
[02:04:03.299 --> 02:04:07.201]  And if it does, it can't be a law.
[02:04:08.464 --> 02:04:10.865]  Because it's not in pursuance of the Constitution.
[02:04:27.170 --> 02:04:29.771]  Go after the bad guys and stop bowing to them.
[02:04:29.771 --> 02:04:30.932]  I appreciate your call.
[02:04:30.932 --> 02:04:32.153]  Very good point.
[02:04:32.153 --> 02:04:38.736]  You know, I was out camping this weekend and saw signs up for mountain lions that have been in the area and have been attacking people in the area.
[02:04:38.736 --> 02:04:43.159]  Uh, menacing people in the area.
[02:04:43.159 --> 02:04:43.599]  Big bend.
[02:04:45.758 --> 02:04:50.764]  And, you know, it said, don't crouch, don't run, don't act scared, you know, yell and throw rocks.
[02:04:50.764 --> 02:04:51.965]  Well, it's the same thing with government.
[02:04:51.965 --> 02:04:54.749]  We act like a bunch of sheep, the wolves are gonna come.
[02:04:54.749 --> 02:04:56.991]  Stop acting like jellyfish.
[02:04:56.991 --> 02:04:58.193]  That's what brings the evil.
[02:05:00.754 --> 02:05:09.840]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:18.246]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[02:05:18.246 --> 02:05:23.129]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[02:05:37.076 --> 02:05:44.099]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[02:05:44.099 --> 02:05:48.602]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[02:06:00.667 --> 02:06:11.372]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[02:06:11.372 --> 02:06:13.213]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[02:06:13.413 --> 02:06:14.293]  Fluoride.
[02:06:14.293 --> 02:06:16.214]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[02:06:16.214 --> 02:06:22.797]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[02:06:22.797 --> 02:06:25.738]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[02:06:25.738 --> 02:06:27.718]  And the results are on record.
[02:06:27.718 --> 02:06:34.041]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[02:06:34.041 --> 02:06:36.462]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[02:06:36.462 --> 02:06:39.403]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[02:06:39.403 --> 02:06:42.764]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[02:06:42.884 --> 02:06:48.331]  You will find Survival Shield Nascent Iodine exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:06:48.331 --> 02:06:53.437]  InfoWars Life Survival Shield Nascent Iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[02:07:01.269 --> 02:07:04.291]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[02:07:04.291 --> 02:07:09.314]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[02:07:09.314 --> 02:07:16.478]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[02:07:16.618 --> 02:07:22.263]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[02:07:22.263 --> 02:07:26.287]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[02:07:26.287 --> 02:07:31.012]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[02:07:31.012 --> 02:07:36.237]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[02:07:36.477 --> 02:07:39.718]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[02:07:39.718 --> 02:07:42.219]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[02:07:42.219 --> 02:07:46.980]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[02:07:46.980 --> 02:07:49.861]  Hand cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[02:07:49.861 --> 02:07:57.063]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[02:07:57.063 --> 02:07:58.343]  We're getting prepared.
[02:07:58.343 --> 02:07:59.003]  Are you?
[02:07:59.003 --> 02:07:59.784]  Infowarshop.com
[02:08:01.872 --> 02:08:15.071]  Hostile actions against United States ships on the high seas and the Gulf of Tonkin have today required me to order the military forces of the United States
[02:08:16.178 --> 02:08:18.300]  Take action and reply.
[02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:25.384]  Dr. Martin Luther King, the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement, has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[02:08:25.384 --> 02:08:26.245]  Kennedy has been shot.
[02:08:26.245 --> 02:08:27.106]  Is that possible?
[02:08:27.106 --> 02:08:28.727]  He still has the gun.
[02:08:28.727 --> 02:08:30.368]  The gun is pointed at people at this moment.
[02:08:30.368 --> 02:08:33.390]  Take a hold of this bomb and break it if you have to.
[02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:35.291]  We will go on a 4-4-5.
[02:08:35.291 --> 02:08:39.094]  We have an explosion and we are attempting to re-agree.
[02:08:39.094 --> 02:08:40.155]  Let's try our best.
[02:08:40.695 --> 02:08:48.178]  People calling themselves members of the Weather Underground last night planted bombs in federal office buildings in Washington and Oakland, California.
[02:08:48.178 --> 02:08:52.820]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[02:08:52.820 --> 02:09:01.803]  Survivors of the USS Liberty are demanding a congressional investigation into what happened and acknowledgment that the Israeli Air Force bombed a U.S.
[02:09:01.803 --> 02:09:02.864]  intelligence navy ship.
[02:09:02.864 --> 02:09:08.546]  The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation's effort to defeat al-Qaeda.
[02:09:08.826 --> 02:09:12.189]  The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down a U.S.
[02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:13.230]  helicopter.
[02:09:13.230 --> 02:09:17.454]  More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most of them are U.S.
[02:09:17.454 --> 02:09:18.235]  Navy SEALs.
[02:09:18.235 --> 02:09:26.223]  There may be a false flag incident where a ship goes down and you'd be used to accelerate the next war.
[02:09:26.223 --> 02:09:30.607]  If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between,
[02:09:31.288 --> 02:09:33.169]  It's that we all hated the bank bailout.
[02:09:33.169 --> 02:09:37.790]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:41.931]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[02:09:41.931 --> 02:09:47.853]  Today, it is infinitely easier to kill a million people than to control a million people.
[02:09:47.853 --> 02:09:52.934]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[02:09:52.934 --> 02:09:55.215]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[02:09:55.215 --> 02:09:56.115]  I'm here to warn people!
[02:09:56.115 --> 02:09:57.776]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[02:09:57.776 --> 02:09:58.596]  This isn't a game!
[02:10:01.104 --> 02:10:08.589]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:10:08.589 --> 02:10:10.190]  Dick Gregory called in.
[02:10:10.190 --> 02:10:11.831]  He's in his car getting back to his house.
[02:10:11.831 --> 02:10:13.312]  We're going to wait till he gets home on the landline.
[02:10:13.312 --> 02:10:19.756]  He's going to be joining us to give us his take on a host of issues and a new film he's got coming out as well.
[02:10:19.756 --> 02:10:22.458]  But before we go back to your phone calls, I wanted to
[02:10:23.817 --> 02:10:29.219]  This is mainly for TV viewers, but radio listeners can go to Infowars.com and see these videos.
[02:10:29.219 --> 02:10:48.605]  These are the type of videos that are angering people, and this latest one, it's on the University of Arizona, Wildcat fans are out, so they call out the riot police, and there's video of them shooting people with beanbag guns and all the rest of it, but behind the police line, a woman's walking along, clearly not even part of anything,
[02:10:49.676 --> 02:10:53.980]  And a cop runs over and hits her full power with a belly club, knocking her back.
[02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:58.824]  And I've seen this footage Rob Deuce shot of Pittsburgh after the G20 was over.
[02:10:58.824 --> 02:11:04.068]  Women on bikes at the university, that was like a police riot, because they hadn't got to attack anybody.
[02:11:04.068 --> 02:11:06.471]  They banned protests citywide while it was over.
[02:11:06.471 --> 02:11:17.240]  They go into the university and are chasing people down on bikes and knocking them off and just, just absolute police mob psychology rioting.
[02:11:18.854 --> 02:11:28.319]  And we see these footage of, like, people in New York on bicycles getting knocked off and getting brain damaged and just... They have a word for it, I can't say it on air.
[02:11:28.319 --> 02:11:32.062]  It's chicken and then an S-word after it.
[02:11:32.062 --> 02:11:41.867]  But it's this random predatory deal of, like, where a dog, a bad dog, will, like, randomly bite a kid or something, like, whoever they think's the weakest.
[02:11:41.867 --> 02:11:46.350]  I see these footage where it'll just be, like, a person in a wheelchair and a cop will walk over and just hit him with a billy club across the face or...
[02:11:47.159 --> 02:11:50.280]  Throw them out of a wheelchair when they're quadriplegic.
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:54.061]  And I just, I just like, and then they don't get in trouble is the issue.
[02:11:54.061 --> 02:11:58.783]  So here's the footage out of Tucson.
[02:11:58.783 --> 02:12:01.424]  The article's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:12:01.424 --> 02:12:02.784]  It's from the Daily Caller.
[02:12:02.784 --> 02:12:03.985]  Tyranny in Tucson.
[02:12:03.985 --> 02:12:07.766]  Cop in riot gear brutally attacks innocent girl.
[02:12:07.766 --> 02:12:10.187]  And then there's the video of it happening.
[02:12:14.195 --> 02:12:17.977]  And again, there's a police line, she's on a smartphone.
[02:12:17.977 --> 02:12:18.477]  Boom!
[02:12:18.477 --> 02:12:21.079]  That's how you kill somebody right there.
[02:12:21.079 --> 02:12:21.919]  Show that again.
[02:12:21.919 --> 02:12:25.141]  She's on a smartphone, wide-eye phone.
[02:12:25.141 --> 02:12:28.683]  Clearly, just a sweet young lady.
[02:12:28.683 --> 02:12:33.946]  And then full power, boom, belly club, under the neck, knocking her back, over into the concrete.
[02:12:33.946 --> 02:12:37.808]  And that's how you get a good kill ratio.
[02:12:37.808 --> 02:12:41.229]  In fact, if I wanted to kill somebody, that's how I'd do it, with a club.
[02:12:42.788 --> 02:12:49.151]  I would find an unsuspecting person and hit them up under the chin to have them hit as hard as they could in the head.
[02:12:49.151 --> 02:12:53.714]  I guarantee you, if that woman died, she didn't go to the hospital with a serious concussion.
[02:12:53.714 --> 02:13:01.217]  If she died, they'd have the police chief on air saying it was authorized and a good... Hell, give the cop a purple heart.
[02:13:01.217 --> 02:13:02.658]  Execute that woman's whole family.
[02:13:02.658 --> 02:13:04.339]  That's what they do in North Korea.
[02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:10.492]  Now, we're going to show you the footage out of New York with what they do to bicyclists.
[02:13:10.492 --> 02:13:12.393]  And this person was put in a coma.
[02:13:12.393 --> 02:13:24.240]  And by the way, this cop did finally get in trouble after a bunch of lawsuits, but here is that footage.
[02:13:24.240 --> 02:13:32.485]  So, you got a bicyclist and the cop knocks him off by the head, full power, from about six feet off the ground into the concrete.
[02:13:32.485 --> 02:13:35.027]  And, well, let's just say that person doesn't talk anymore.
[02:13:37.441 --> 02:13:38.541]  Good!
[02:13:38.541 --> 02:13:39.741]  Good!
[02:13:39.741 --> 02:13:41.462]  Good!
[02:13:41.462 --> 02:13:43.262]  Do what must be done.
[02:13:43.262 --> 02:13:49.603]  Show no mercy.
[02:13:49.603 --> 02:13:50.443]  And then slow-mo.
[02:13:50.443 --> 02:13:52.724]  Boom!
[02:13:52.724 --> 02:13:54.404]  That's how you kill somebody.
[02:13:54.404 --> 02:13:57.604]  Like that kid outside Austin and Bastrop.
[02:13:57.604 --> 02:13:58.885]  Two girls are slapping each other.
[02:13:58.885 --> 02:13:59.885]  He separates them.
[02:13:59.885 --> 02:14:00.485]  Clean cut.
[02:14:00.485 --> 02:14:01.925]  Nice kid.
[02:14:01.925 --> 02:14:02.585]  Turns around.
[02:14:02.585 --> 02:14:03.685]  Drops him over.
[02:14:03.685 --> 02:14:04.266]  He says, sure.
[02:14:04.266 --> 02:14:05.666]  They taser him.
[02:14:05.666 --> 02:14:06.186]  Falls over.
[02:14:07.349 --> 02:14:08.310]  He doesn't talk anymore.
[02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:10.251]  I've had his lawyer in here.
[02:14:10.251 --> 02:14:17.236]  They kept him in the nurse's office for hours hoping he'd just, you know, deep six it.
[02:14:17.236 --> 02:14:20.958]  The blood coming out of his ears right away, but he still lives.
[02:14:20.958 --> 02:14:23.260]  That's kind of a tragedy, huh?
[02:14:23.260 --> 02:14:24.421]  So now they're getting sued.
[02:14:24.421 --> 02:14:24.861]  They don't care.
[02:14:24.861 --> 02:14:26.742]  They'll just use taxpayer money to pay it.
[02:14:26.742 --> 02:14:31.326]  So there's this new warrior attitude where somebody's standing there doing nothing?
[02:14:31.326 --> 02:14:33.047]  Well, you knock them over full power.
[02:14:34.264 --> 02:14:38.366]  Oh, but don't worry, the FBI is looking into Taser shooting at Bastrop High School.
[02:14:38.366 --> 02:14:42.527]  I don't know, maybe the FBI will do some good.
[02:14:42.527 --> 02:14:48.710]  My whole issue is, is that... It's just, it's just truly disgusting.
[02:14:48.710 --> 02:14:49.790]  Dick Gregory coming up.
[02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:50.691]  Andrew in Australia.
[02:14:50.691 --> 02:14:51.591]  Oh, I should have gone to you earlier.
[02:14:51.591 --> 02:14:52.691]  I didn't know you were holding from Australia.
[02:14:52.691 --> 02:14:53.712]  I apologize.
[02:14:53.712 --> 02:14:54.572]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[02:14:54.572 --> 02:14:56.213]  Go ahead.
[02:14:56.213 --> 02:14:56.973]  G'day, Alex.
[02:14:56.973 --> 02:14:58.254]  How you going, mate?
[02:14:58.254 --> 02:14:59.014]  I'm doing alright, brother.
[02:14:59.014 --> 02:15:01.095]  What's on your mind today?
[02:15:01.095 --> 02:15:03.756]  Well, I want to talk about something that's been
[02:15:04.448 --> 02:15:05.609]  You've been bugging me for quite a while.
[02:15:05.609 --> 02:15:08.211]  I love your show and I love what you do.
[02:15:08.211 --> 02:15:18.818]  But, mate, there's been something that's been going on in the back blocks of society for quite a while.
[02:15:18.818 --> 02:15:24.442]  And it's kind of... I don't know, mate, because I'm a defector.
[02:15:25.503 --> 02:15:31.584]  Well listen, I mean, if it's made up gossip or that I have crooked toenails, I have to admit it's true.
[02:15:31.584 --> 02:15:35.865]  But I don't know where you're going with this, but if it's something about me, just go ahead and say it and we'll move on.
[02:15:35.865 --> 02:15:41.827]  But we're talking about government and big establishment hoaxes today and things that are going on.
[02:15:41.827 --> 02:15:43.487]  But we don't screen your calls.
[02:15:43.487 --> 02:15:46.968]  If people want to bring something up, go ahead, just bring it up.
[02:15:46.968 --> 02:15:50.829]  It's the biggest hoax in society today.
[02:15:53.324 --> 02:15:56.487]  I was a defector since 9-1-1, mate.
[02:15:56.487 --> 02:16:03.612]  And I probably would have been a defector if anything else had occurred the way I was.
[02:16:03.612 --> 02:16:09.297]  It's just like... The music's all about it.
[02:16:09.297 --> 02:16:11.458]  Well, let me ask you a question.
[02:16:11.458 --> 02:16:12.019]  What is it like?
[02:16:12.019 --> 02:16:13.360]  7 or 8 in the morning there?
[02:16:13.360 --> 02:16:14.100]  Or 6 in the morning?
[02:16:14.100 --> 02:16:16.222]  What time is it in Australia?
[02:16:16.222 --> 02:16:16.462]  4 a.m.
[02:16:16.462 --> 02:16:17.183]  in the morning here.
[02:16:17.884 --> 02:16:19.025]  And I'm going to ask you a question.
[02:16:19.025 --> 02:16:25.129]  Are you either very sleepy or have you had some beer?
[02:16:25.129 --> 02:16:30.973]  I stay up quite late to listen to the Alex Jones Show every night.
[02:16:30.973 --> 02:16:34.556]  It's pretty much my only refuge because I love this show.
[02:16:34.556 --> 02:16:36.017]  I love how it tells the truth.
[02:16:36.017 --> 02:16:36.837]  Well listen, you're awesome.
[02:16:36.837 --> 02:16:42.341]  Boil down then what the hoax is because I'm having trouble making out what you're saying.
[02:16:42.341 --> 02:16:46.524]  I reckon Alex Jones can go one step further and tell the
[02:16:47.273 --> 02:16:56.322]  Real truth about societal hoax that has been going on since Noah.
[02:16:56.322 --> 02:16:57.443]  Well, brother, you can tell it.
[02:16:57.443 --> 02:16:58.424]  You're on the air.
[02:16:58.424 --> 02:17:01.026]  What is it?
[02:17:01.026 --> 02:17:02.227]  You know what it is.
[02:17:02.227 --> 02:17:09.614]  You said yourself that if somebody doesn't become a man by the time they're 15, they're thrown aside.
[02:17:09.614 --> 02:17:11.636]  That's the biggest secret in society.
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:15.401]  You know what it is.
[02:17:15.401 --> 02:17:16.361]  We all know what it is.
[02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:17.302]  You know exactly what it is.
[02:17:17.302 --> 02:17:18.863]  This is conformist and defective and non-conformist
[02:17:43.883 --> 02:17:48.205]  And this is what society is based on.
[02:17:48.205 --> 02:17:51.267]  And this is... Oh, you're saying we need more rebels.
[02:17:51.267 --> 02:17:54.848]  We need more people to be free spirits.
[02:17:54.848 --> 02:17:57.750]  No, no, not exactly free spirits.
[02:17:57.750 --> 02:17:59.210]  But listen, I really want to know.
[02:17:59.210 --> 02:18:00.671]  You got me on the edge of my seat.
[02:18:00.671 --> 02:18:02.112]  What is the big secret?
[02:18:02.112 --> 02:18:04.973]  I do not know what you're... I mean, what is it?
[02:18:04.973 --> 02:18:05.974]  You keep saying, I know.
[02:18:05.974 --> 02:18:09.695]  I don't... I cannot tell... I'm not the great Carnac here.
[02:18:09.695 --> 02:18:10.436]  Tell me.
[02:18:10.436 --> 02:18:12.977]  You're a stonewalling, Alex.
[02:18:13.769 --> 02:18:14.229]  No, no, no.
[02:18:14.229 --> 02:18:16.130]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[02:18:16.130 --> 02:18:25.552]  You're creating a paradox to say I'm lying or to say I won't tell people something and then you're on air and you won't tell us.
[02:18:25.552 --> 02:18:26.713]  What is it?
[02:18:26.713 --> 02:18:27.953]  Exactly what it is.
[02:18:27.953 --> 02:18:29.053]  You asked me.
[02:18:29.053 --> 02:18:30.434]  You asked me what I'm talking about.
[02:18:33.192 --> 02:18:35.853]  This is a hilarious call.
[02:18:35.853 --> 02:18:40.335]  Because you're saying, I won't say what it is, but you're on air and you won't say.
[02:18:40.335 --> 02:18:41.435]  You're stonewalling.
[02:18:41.435 --> 02:18:43.836]  I will say exactly what it is.
[02:18:43.836 --> 02:18:45.777]  It is based in all music.
[02:18:45.777 --> 02:18:47.818]  It is based in all movies.
[02:18:47.818 --> 02:18:51.879]  It is based in anything that is popular culture.
[02:18:51.879 --> 02:18:53.300]  It is pushed.
[02:18:53.300 --> 02:18:54.980]  It's an agenda.
[02:18:54.980 --> 02:18:56.121]  And you will not
[02:18:57.970 --> 02:18:59.591]  Okay, okay, okay.
[02:18:59.591 --> 02:19:00.332]  Let's stop right there.
[02:19:00.332 --> 02:19:06.197]  I'm going to skip this network break because we're already getting Gregory on late and he should be calling in any minute.
[02:19:06.197 --> 02:19:09.980]  This guy will say, people always say, he went to break right when the key question got asked.
[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:15.185]  We got to break at 20 after unless I skip it, which I'm really not supposed to do, but I'm horrible and I do, and that's just what we do here.
[02:19:17.921 --> 02:19:18.861]  This goes way deeper.
[02:19:39.085 --> 02:19:40.426]  It is beyond that.
[02:19:40.426 --> 02:19:41.527]  It is defective.
[02:19:41.527 --> 02:19:42.508]  It is people that go against the grain.
[02:20:03.556 --> 02:20:09.619]  Maybe it's because I didn't become a man when I wasn't supposed to, or whatever.
[02:20:09.619 --> 02:20:11.260]  I don't know what it is!
[02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:12.941]  You are torturing me!
[02:20:12.941 --> 02:20:18.063]  And I don't necessarily, whatever it is, agree with what you're about to say, but I mean, what is the 64 million?
[02:20:18.063 --> 02:20:21.585]  What is it?
[02:20:21.585 --> 02:20:22.966]  Well, that'll be the name of this segment.
[02:20:22.966 --> 02:20:23.666]  What is it?
[02:20:23.666 --> 02:20:24.347]  The secret.
[02:20:24.347 --> 02:20:28.909]  I mean, is it that I won't admit that Easter bunnies are actually in control of things?
[02:20:30.046 --> 02:20:40.372]  Well, maybe you don't know, maybe you're oblivious, but I reckon the people that do know will not admit it.
[02:20:40.372 --> 02:20:44.834]  And the people that do know will push the agenda.
[02:20:44.834 --> 02:20:46.635]  Man, but it's not fair.
[02:20:46.635 --> 02:20:53.359]  It's not intellectually fair for you to call in and say, I know something that's really important, and then not say it.
[02:20:53.359 --> 02:20:55.541]  Just say it.
[02:20:55.541 --> 02:20:57.602]  I am saying it.
[02:20:57.602 --> 02:20:59.723]  Ten years ago, 9-11 happened, right?
[02:21:01.055 --> 02:21:04.557]  Twelve years ago, yeah?
[02:21:04.557 --> 02:21:08.400]  I was a different person back then.
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:10.582]  And I went against the system.
[02:21:10.582 --> 02:21:12.663]  I knew it was a hoax.
[02:21:12.663 --> 02:21:14.124]  I knew something was wrong with it.
[02:21:14.124 --> 02:21:18.087]  I could tell by the way they were reported and everything.
[02:21:18.087 --> 02:21:20.128]  And then I was tagged.
[02:21:20.128 --> 02:21:22.670]  Which means I've got a glass in my face.
[02:21:24.329 --> 02:21:29.311]  Well, I mean, I expose 9-11 as clearly being a fraud, the official story.
[02:21:29.311 --> 02:21:30.772]  Listen, I hear you.
[02:21:30.772 --> 02:21:37.354]  So you're saying that there's a system where you get blackballed if you don't play ball with the system?
[02:21:37.354 --> 02:21:38.195]  Is that the big secret?
[02:21:38.195 --> 02:21:40.396]  At that moment, I knew.
[02:21:40.396 --> 02:21:47.999]  A friend of mine told me when I was in high school, which I never really registered until that moment of that blast in the face.
[02:21:47.999 --> 02:21:51.080]  He said, my old man reckons you're a defector.
[02:21:52.745 --> 02:21:57.709]  There's two kinds of people in this world, conformists and defectives.
[02:21:57.709 --> 02:21:58.990]  And you're a defector.
[02:21:58.990 --> 02:22:02.452]  And I said, no, I'll just brush it off at the time.
[02:22:02.452 --> 02:22:09.737]  Sure, well what happens when enough of us defect from the system, we build a new, better system, and that's what we need is renewal in the cycle.
[02:22:09.737 --> 02:22:16.722]  So that's the answer, is we need to be individuals, and that's what the system fears, and I totally agree with you.
[02:22:16.722 --> 02:22:19.605]  You got 10 seconds, if there's anything else?
[02:22:19.605 --> 02:22:19.965]  Okay.
[02:22:20.734 --> 02:22:37.429]  Let me just tell you, this is all leading up to something, I don't know what, it is about to happen, and I just cannot, I cannot explain because I'm... No, no, I hear you, you sound like a smart guy, but be honest, you stayed up late, you had about 10 beers?
[02:22:37.429 --> 02:22:38.290]  Uh, about 16 beers, but...
[02:22:44.429 --> 02:22:45.590]  All right, I'll see you later.
[02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:47.130]  I'll see you later, bro.
[02:22:47.130 --> 02:22:49.011]  Oh, man, that's hilarious.
[02:22:49.011 --> 02:22:51.192]  Let's talk to Bob in Michigan.
[02:22:51.192 --> 02:22:52.133]  Bob, you're on the air.
[02:22:52.133 --> 02:22:53.013]  Go ahead.
[02:22:53.013 --> 02:22:53.674]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:53.674 --> 02:22:55.394]  Yeah, thanks for taking my call.
[02:22:55.394 --> 02:22:56.215]  That was a good one.
[02:22:56.215 --> 02:23:01.557]  That was one of those ones you put down in your notes there.
[02:23:01.557 --> 02:23:08.701]  One of the things I kind of look at these situations, especially the hoaxes, if you can kind of distill it down to something really basic.
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:14.724]  And the same things, of course, have been perpetrated against us as a people.
[02:23:14.724 --> 02:23:16.485]  There's nothing really new.
[02:23:16.485 --> 02:23:21.529]  But Lennon said it, you know, confuse the meaning of words and you confuse the mind.
[02:23:21.529 --> 02:23:24.692]  And that's where a lot of these atrocities are coming from.
[02:23:24.692 --> 02:23:38.202]  Telling people they can't have somebody in their home without a permit or going in and identifying things that are not in line with their whatever their agencies.
[02:23:38.789 --> 02:24:00.278]  These agencies are the illegitimate, quote-unquote, fourth arm of government, and they're definitely being written as they're the actual truth, and that's how you get a lot of these police officers, unfortunately, who think they're just doing their job, will come out and enforce that, when really this has absolutely nothing to do
[02:24:01.081 --> 02:24:03.283]  With what you would call the private citizen.
[02:24:03.283 --> 02:24:04.103]  No, no, exactly.
[02:24:04.103 --> 02:24:04.804]  That's the hoax.
[02:24:04.804 --> 02:24:15.591]  They've created all these new rules and regulations that aren't even in law, but that masquerade as to give it the illusion of that when it's completely a rogue state within a legitimate state.
[02:24:15.591 --> 02:24:16.311]  Exactly.
[02:24:16.311 --> 02:24:21.135]  And you're working one system within the other, and it's getting more and more difficult.
[02:24:21.135 --> 02:24:24.377]  People are talking about the results, and they're bad.
[02:24:24.377 --> 02:24:29.821]  You don't want somebody saying that you can't have a barbecue in your backyard, or have your children playing in the pool, etc.
[02:24:30.891 --> 02:24:41.880]  But, what they're doing is they're taking that from basically the corporate aspect of this, where they can say the grass is orange, and because they say so, then it's so.
[02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:51.988]  People have to understand, and there'll be a lot of looking through the minutia of this, but that's the big, huge problem staring us in the face.
[02:24:51.988 --> 02:24:58.674]  You are confusing the meaning of the words, and we are being confused in our mind, saying, yes, we have these constitutional rights.
[02:25:00.099 --> 02:25:02.980]  Actual agencies don't have constitutional rights.
[02:25:02.980 --> 02:25:04.862]  They can write it up any way they want.
[02:25:04.862 --> 02:25:12.647]  You can talk EPA, you can talk any of these things, and that is where a great deal of this tyranny is coming from.
[02:25:12.647 --> 02:25:16.209]  Absolutely, and it's called Agenda 21, and people need to wake up to it.
[02:25:16.209 --> 02:25:16.649]  Great point.
[02:25:16.649 --> 02:25:25.255]  So you're saying that's the big hoax, is that we have a fraudulent government system within the system that is slowly absorbing the constitutional system.
[02:25:25.776 --> 02:25:33.682]  Exactly, and you just have to be alert, be aware, don't be confused in your mind, look at it for exactly what it is.
[02:25:33.682 --> 02:25:39.526]  And hopefully that's going to draw a big circle around a lot of these things that were brought up.
[02:25:39.526 --> 02:25:40.606]  Great points, great call.
[02:25:40.606 --> 02:25:44.249]  Wow, Bob in like two minutes said more than I can say in an hour.
[02:25:44.249 --> 02:25:46.971]  That absolutely crystallized.
[02:25:46.971 --> 02:25:48.352]  A system within a system.
[02:25:50.134 --> 02:25:55.997]  Now we're joined for the balance of the hour by Dick Gregory, always a very interesting guest.
[02:25:55.997 --> 02:26:05.421]  One of the top comedians out there who used his great wit to promote a real civil rights movement, a civil rights icon who marched with Dr. Martin Luther King and many others.
[02:26:06.361 --> 02:26:11.826]  And he's got a new film that he's in out that we're going to be talking about, Unsung Holly.
[02:26:11.826 --> 02:26:15.249]  We're going to play about three or four minutes of that in the last segment today.
[02:26:15.249 --> 02:26:22.436]  And since Dick was a little bit late today, hopefully we can get him back a little bit sooner for a second interview in a couple months to take your phone calls.
[02:26:22.436 --> 02:26:24.438]  But he's with us till the end of the hour.
[02:26:24.438 --> 02:26:25.078]  DickGregory.com.
[02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:30.121]  And he joins us to talk about the waterfront.
[02:26:30.121 --> 02:26:31.902]  Mr. Gregory, good to have you on with us.
[02:26:31.902 --> 02:26:32.803]  Bless you, my brother.
[02:26:32.803 --> 02:26:36.584]  Peace and love to you, and just thank you for being there.
[02:26:36.584 --> 02:26:40.206]  Every time I do your show, it's almost like I'm on a black station.
[02:26:40.206 --> 02:26:44.107]  So many black folks see me in the street and say, I heard you this morning.
[02:26:44.107 --> 02:26:46.228]  Well, it's just a people station, my friend.
[02:26:46.228 --> 02:26:47.749]  Well, no, it's more than that.
[02:26:47.749 --> 02:26:52.011]  See, there's a certain clairvoyant that black folks are born with.
[02:26:52.011 --> 02:26:54.712]  We don't have it as much now as we used to.
[02:26:55.655 --> 02:26:58.237]  But that's always been there.
[02:26:58.237 --> 02:27:02.081]  And so they can listen to you and there ain't no tricking going on.
[02:27:02.081 --> 02:27:03.282]  They know nothing.
[02:27:03.282 --> 02:27:05.503]  They don't even have to question.
[02:27:05.503 --> 02:27:10.368]  Very seldom you hear a black person talking about conspiracy theory, right?
[02:27:10.368 --> 02:27:17.554]  The conspiracy theory is the New York Times and the Washington Post and NBC and CBN.
[02:27:17.554 --> 02:27:18.895]  And just thank God
[02:27:19.697 --> 02:27:28.280]  That all these radio stations, like yours, and, you know, the one problem I have, I listened to the last part of your interview just now with the guy.
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:29.040]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:34.942]  And you very seldom hear this, only, you know, you all know everything, okay?
[02:27:34.942 --> 02:27:41.424]  Because you hang to the right, you've been in there, you've been in the military, you know what this country's doing.
[02:27:41.424 --> 02:27:44.045]  And to sit and say this just started?
[02:27:44.045 --> 02:27:45.565]  Y'all know better than that.
[02:27:45.565 --> 02:27:47.326]  What are you frightened of, huh?
[02:27:48.072 --> 02:27:48.892]  What are you fighting?
[02:27:48.892 --> 02:27:51.113]  A Jack Thorne Show!
[02:27:51.113 --> 02:27:59.196]  Back in the 60's, when I said on the Jack Thorne Show, I said, you know, it's hard to believe this government taps my telephone.
[02:27:59.196 --> 02:28:01.197]  And Jack went crazy.
[02:28:01.197 --> 02:28:01.837]  America?
[02:28:01.837 --> 02:28:04.598]  Taps your telephone?
[02:28:04.598 --> 02:28:05.638]  What are you?
[02:28:05.638 --> 02:28:06.598]  How can you prove that?
[02:28:06.598 --> 02:28:13.841]  I said, anytime a Negro in America can owe their telephone $60,000 and they don't cut the phone off, it's tapped.
[02:28:16.269 --> 02:28:20.630]  I'm the one who released the pictures with Ron Brown with the bullet in the back of his head.
[02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:21.090]  Oh, I know.
[02:28:21.090 --> 02:28:21.750]  I know.
[02:28:21.750 --> 02:28:23.450]  You were the original Alex Jones.
[02:28:23.450 --> 02:28:23.930]  That's right.
[02:28:23.930 --> 02:28:27.271]  So now we don't have to worry about this plane here.
[02:28:27.271 --> 02:28:28.711]  We've seen it happen.
[02:28:28.711 --> 02:28:34.532]  But for some reason, a lot of these white shows that know this don't go all the way.
[02:28:34.532 --> 02:28:36.112]  What are you scared of?
[02:28:36.112 --> 02:28:36.933]  You love America?
[02:28:36.933 --> 02:28:37.673]  No, no, no, no.
[02:28:37.673 --> 02:28:40.813]  I agree that America's been corrupt from the beginning and so is every other country.
[02:28:40.813 --> 02:28:43.014]  The thing is it's getting more scientific.
[02:28:43.014 --> 02:28:44.814]  It's definitely the evil's growing.
[02:28:45.077 --> 02:28:45.938]  I don't know you right.
[02:28:45.938 --> 02:28:54.866]  It's getting more scientific, but I'm saying when it wasn't this scientific, it was few people that understand it.
[02:28:54.866 --> 02:29:00.931]  Plus back then when you were exposing it, I mean back then they used to kill people routinely that talked about it.
[02:29:00.931 --> 02:29:02.192]  Oh they do now.
[02:29:02.192 --> 02:29:03.673]  They do now.
[02:29:03.673 --> 02:29:07.697]  The reason it's better off now, you're telling me what they used to do.
[02:29:07.697 --> 02:29:10.880]  Here's something that's interesting.
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:12.161]  The Chicago Tribune.
[02:29:13.112 --> 02:29:18.317]  And at that time, it was probably the third best newspaper in the country.
[02:29:18.317 --> 02:29:25.745]  So, by day count, Friday, March the 10th, 1978.
[02:29:25.745 --> 02:29:30.730]  Headline, FBI Memo Used Mob To Kill Dick Gregory.
[02:29:31.320 --> 02:29:33.262]  No other paper ran this.
[02:29:33.262 --> 02:29:40.507]  I bet if they would have found something while I was talking to some Black Panthers to kill Hoover, it would have been in all the papers.
[02:29:40.507 --> 02:29:41.048]  Unbelievable.
[02:29:41.048 --> 02:29:42.068]  Let's come back.
[02:29:42.068 --> 02:29:43.590]  Dick Gregory's our guest.
[02:29:43.590 --> 02:29:45.311]  Incredible individual.
[02:29:45.311 --> 02:29:49.775]  On the other side, stay with us, DickGregory.com.
[02:29:49.775 --> 02:29:51.176]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.176 --> 02:29:53.718]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.718 --> 02:29:56.420]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.874 --> 02:30:02.775]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:30:02.775 --> 02:30:06.417]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:30:06.417 --> 02:30:10.959]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:30:10.959 --> 02:30:17.082]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:30:17.082 --> 02:30:27.847]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[02:30:28.067 --> 02:30:34.553]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:30:34.553 --> 02:30:49.285]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:30:49.445 --> 02:30:54.327]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care?
[02:31:06.613 --> 02:31:14.035]  We have cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[02:31:14.035 --> 02:31:15.975]  It all comes down to one thing.
[02:31:15.975 --> 02:31:17.596]  We are what we eat.
[02:31:17.596 --> 02:31:22.277]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[02:31:22.277 --> 02:31:26.498]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[02:31:26.498 --> 02:31:29.059]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[02:31:29.059 --> 02:31:34.960]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[02:32:00.783 --> 02:32:03.624]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[02:32:03.624 --> 02:32:08.745]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of Patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[02:32:08.745 --> 02:32:16.868]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the Charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[02:32:16.868 --> 02:32:21.409]  Deciding to take action, a company run by Patriots for Patriots was born.
[02:32:21.409 --> 02:32:25.210]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[02:32:25.370 --> 02:32:31.317]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[02:32:31.317 --> 02:32:34.480]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[02:32:34.480 --> 02:32:39.626]  And that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality storable foods from my Patriot Supply.

[02:33:18.177 --> 02:33:24.641]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:24.641 --> 02:33:28.022]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:28.022 --> 02:33:33.405]  Dick Gregory's only been on twice before, and we've got to get him on commercial-free The Nightly News.
[02:33:33.405 --> 02:33:39.389]  Like a 40-minute commercial-free interview, so we can put clips of his comedy throughout the years, and clips of his new film in there.
[02:33:39.389 --> 02:33:43.391]  He's agreed to do it in the next two weeks, so that's coming, because it really is
[02:33:44.091 --> 02:33:47.872]  Almost pointless to just get him on for 30 minutes because he's got so much to say.
[02:33:47.872 --> 02:33:53.854]  And again, he was talking about this stuff 50 years ago, ladies and gentlemen, and so much of it has turned out to be true.
[02:33:53.854 --> 02:33:55.715]  So you've got the floor, Mr. Gregory.
[02:33:55.715 --> 02:34:01.336]  Finish up your point you were trying to make about it being in the news that the FBI director was going to kill you.
[02:34:01.336 --> 02:34:06.238]  And then expand out on you were bringing up the missing plane and the missing scientist.
[02:34:06.238 --> 02:34:10.639]  Of course, that's one thing I thought was interesting and kind of a brain theft, I guess.
[02:34:10.639 --> 02:34:12.160]  And just other big issues.
[02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:13.520]  Your view on the world, Dick Gregory.
[02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:22.152]  Okay, now what we left off was the Chicago Tribune article, and that was by Rob Warden.
[02:34:22.152 --> 02:34:23.795]  And here's the first paragraph.
[02:34:26.818 --> 02:34:48.742]  Ordered the Chicago office of the Federal Bureau to develop measures to neutralize, that's the word they use for kill, black comedian Dick Gregory, and suggested measures could include alerting La Costa Nostra to Gregory's verbal attacks on them.
[02:34:48.742 --> 02:34:50.102]  And it goes on and on.
[02:34:50.102 --> 02:34:55.363]  Now, matter of fact, I had the tell eggs before the Chicago FBI got here.
[02:34:57.686 --> 02:35:06.010]  That's the good thing about black folk, that one day when white folk understand who we are, you know, we did all the work for white folk.
[02:35:06.010 --> 02:35:07.711]  They didn't hire white folks to do that.
[02:35:07.711 --> 02:35:09.552]  We did all the work.
[02:35:09.552 --> 02:35:13.154]  And it's something about white America.
[02:35:13.154 --> 02:35:16.496]  They knew something about us.
[02:35:16.496 --> 02:35:17.317]  Our spirit.
[02:35:17.317 --> 02:35:18.337]  Why?
[02:35:18.337 --> 02:35:21.299]  Nobody on this planet could be treated
[02:35:22.122 --> 02:35:28.626]  Like a group of people that we was treated doing slavery and they knew something about me.
[02:35:28.626 --> 02:35:30.366]  They let me cook their food.
[02:35:30.366 --> 02:35:32.227]  They let me take care of their babies.
[02:35:32.227 --> 02:35:40.012]  You don't let people who's been trashed do that unless you know something that's coming off of them.
[02:35:40.012 --> 02:35:41.312]  So we had all the jobs.
[02:35:41.312 --> 02:35:44.254]  My mother's mother's mother's mother's mother.
[02:35:45.089 --> 02:35:46.670]  By the way, folks, that's actually true.
[02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:52.675]  The Rockefellers ran snake oil operations out of Missouri before they discovered oil.
[02:36:10.028 --> 02:36:12.209]  And the James's were Jews.
[02:36:12.209 --> 02:36:18.834]  That's why, and I hate to use the word because so many people use that to trash the Jews with.
[02:36:18.834 --> 02:36:25.858]  No, that's why they was robbing banks and the railroads because of the way they treated Jews.
[02:36:25.858 --> 02:36:28.280]  And so consequently, we knew that.
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:31.142]  We knew everything out here.
[02:36:31.142 --> 02:36:34.204]  We know who Abraham Lincoln's daddy was.
[02:36:34.204 --> 02:36:36.045]  We know who Abraham Lincoln was.
[02:36:36.787 --> 02:36:40.309]  And we know that because we worked in the house.
[02:36:40.309 --> 02:36:47.812]  And we know damn good and well that ain't no white boy from Yale invented the cotton gin.
[02:36:47.812 --> 02:36:49.433]  Okay?
[02:36:49.433 --> 02:36:57.077]  If I'm working and the people I work for and I'm a slave that don't give a damn about me, why are they going to invent something to ease my burden?
[02:36:57.077 --> 02:36:58.297]  Huh?
[02:36:58.297 --> 02:36:59.218]  Eli Whitney.
[02:36:59.218 --> 02:37:05.941]  The only reason you can have fantastic documents there is because Eli Whitney
[02:37:06.843 --> 02:37:15.290]  He came down from Yale to visit this rich, you know, slave-owned family, and he saw this black guy sitting in the field with a box.
[02:37:15.290 --> 02:37:18.813]  And so he went back and put a patent on it.
[02:37:18.813 --> 02:37:21.135]  Well, it went to court.
[02:37:21.135 --> 02:37:27.520]  So the documents is in federal court about who did and who didn't.
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:35.947]  And so when you sit and you think about the information we have, and have always had, the Pullman Portals.
[02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:39.472]  Most of the poor men porters were wealthy.
[02:37:39.472 --> 02:37:40.332]  Why?
[02:37:40.332 --> 02:37:47.657]  Because couldn't nobody poor afford to ride on a train where they had sleeping cars.
[02:37:47.657 --> 02:37:50.159]  It was called sleeping car porters.
[02:37:50.159 --> 02:37:57.804]  And, and, but the wealthy, before that, it was the Roosevelt's and the rich, they would hook these private car onto the railroad.
[02:37:58.661 --> 02:38:02.004]  So they say anything in front of us because we was invisible.
[02:38:02.004 --> 02:38:04.206]  We know what stock was going to go down.
[02:38:04.206 --> 02:38:06.448]  We know the stock market when it was going to be fixed.
[02:38:06.448 --> 02:38:07.629]  We knew that.
[02:38:07.629 --> 02:38:08.770]  We knew sports.
[02:38:08.770 --> 02:38:11.592]  You know, do you know what I'm fixing to say now?
[02:38:11.592 --> 02:38:16.776]  Do you know how many Americans would just say, oh, he must be great.
[02:38:16.776 --> 02:38:19.238]  60% of all college football games is fixed.
[02:38:19.238 --> 02:38:20.099]  Okay.
[02:38:20.099 --> 02:38:25.684]  Now, and we think the same way the Germans thought right before they fell.
[02:38:26.643 --> 02:38:30.946]  There were people trying to tell folks what was going on, and they wouldn't hear it.
[02:38:30.946 --> 02:38:34.388]  They just couldn't believe that this could happen.
[02:38:34.388 --> 02:38:42.233]  And so consequently, when you sit down, here's why your shows and shows like yours go over so big.
[02:38:42.233 --> 02:38:46.736]  When I'm 82 years old, I had nothing but NBC, CBS, and ABC.
[02:38:47.791 --> 02:38:48.491]  Okay?
[02:38:48.491 --> 02:38:53.334]  When you listen to them talk about that Malaysian plane now, and say we bring in an analyst.
[02:38:53.334 --> 02:38:55.955]  Ain't no analyst, that's CIA, okay?
[02:38:55.955 --> 02:38:57.416]  That's a game.
[02:38:57.416 --> 02:39:00.557]  But Americans is so naive.
[02:39:00.557 --> 02:39:07.621]  You know, you try to tell Americans that, that Kennedy, when he shot in Dallas, they haven't found his brain.
[02:39:07.621 --> 02:39:09.122]  His brain is missing.
[02:39:09.122 --> 02:39:10.502]  You know, I said, wait a minute.
[02:39:10.502 --> 02:39:11.263]  It's splattered.
[02:39:11.263 --> 02:39:11.923]  No, no, no.
[02:39:11.923 --> 02:39:13.944]  Come on, y'all.
[02:39:13.944 --> 02:39:15.705]  He was shot at one o'clock.
[02:39:16.815 --> 02:39:18.156]  Eastern Time.
[02:39:18.156 --> 02:39:26.303]  At 4 o'clock, they sent that limousine of his back to where they make the limousines in Cincinnati, Ohio, to have it re-overworked.
[02:39:26.303 --> 02:39:29.006]  What about all the forensics that's in there?
[02:39:29.006 --> 02:39:32.269]  You try to tell Americans this, okay?
[02:39:32.269 --> 02:39:33.910]  And they will not believe you.
[02:39:33.910 --> 02:39:35.291]  What's happening now?
[02:39:35.291 --> 02:39:37.393]  Social media.
[02:39:37.393 --> 02:39:38.174]  The social media.
[02:39:38.174 --> 02:39:43.799]  When I was a little boy, NBC, CBS, and ABC, they would get something like
[02:39:44.948 --> 02:39:48.390]  30 to 40,000 people every evening for the news.
[02:39:48.390 --> 02:39:49.651]  Separately.
[02:39:49.651 --> 02:39:53.674]  They can't get 17 million people total together.
[02:39:53.674 --> 02:39:57.276]  Because all at once that other media is out there.
[02:39:57.276 --> 02:40:01.559]  And people hear stuff that feels good and sounds good.
[02:40:01.559 --> 02:40:05.782]  For instance, go back to September 11th, okay?
[02:40:05.782 --> 02:40:09.824]  September 11th, and Operation Dinko.
[02:40:09.824 --> 02:40:13.887]  Those of us that's doing it, we knew that was coming five years before it hit.
[02:40:14.680 --> 02:40:19.646]  About the raid they made in the Philippines and got that guy's hard drive.
[02:40:19.646 --> 02:40:22.589]  And they listed all five places that was going on.
[02:40:22.589 --> 02:40:23.891]  I just didn't know the days.
[02:40:23.891 --> 02:40:26.213]  Now there was some folks that knew the day.
[02:40:26.213 --> 02:40:29.917]  I was in New York helping a friend of mine on the election.
[02:40:29.917 --> 02:40:30.858]  The election was Tuesday.
[02:40:30.858 --> 02:40:31.980]  I went on the 10th.
[02:40:31.980 --> 02:40:34.602]  I'm there the 10th and the 11th.
[02:40:34.602 --> 02:40:35.724]  And I called my wife.
[02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:39.682]  And I said, babe, well, you got me sleeping tonight, so you're not a friend of yours.
[02:40:39.682 --> 02:40:42.804]  I'll call you from Paris if they don't spend the night in New York tonight.
[02:40:42.804 --> 02:40:43.724]  You hear me?
[02:40:43.724 --> 02:40:48.247]  I get on a train and go to Washington, D.C.
[02:40:48.247 --> 02:40:57.273]  When I get off the train at 4 o'clock, I can't say too much on the phone, so I called him and said, I owe you one.
[02:40:57.273 --> 02:40:58.874]  How did you know I was in New York?
[02:40:58.874 --> 02:41:01.915]  He said, we picked you up on the satellite, brother.
[02:41:01.915 --> 02:41:05.798]  Now, I just, you know, the next day I'm home.
[02:41:06.534 --> 02:41:13.296]  And my wife and my son called and said a plane just hit a New York building.
[02:41:13.296 --> 02:41:19.638]  And I'm thinking it's the King Kong, you know, the little old Piper Cub.
[02:41:19.638 --> 02:41:24.879]  And so I go out to do my walk and I come back, they call me again and say a second plane hit.
[02:41:24.879 --> 02:41:29.540]  When I saw that I said, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[02:41:29.540 --> 02:41:32.201]  And so we look at it and we see it.
[02:41:32.893 --> 02:41:38.336]  And you follow it like you, you hear so much stuff and see so much, and you know the people that have given it to you.
[02:41:38.336 --> 02:41:41.719]  Now you got tricks that'll call in who ain't nothing but agents.
[02:41:41.719 --> 02:41:45.921]  You got tricks that'll call in and know more about the subject than you know that mean.
[02:41:45.921 --> 02:41:48.563]  I don't know how you know about this much, okay?
[02:41:48.563 --> 02:41:51.925]  And so consequently, we was all ready for that.
[02:41:51.925 --> 02:41:53.146]  I just didn't know the date.
[02:41:54.187 --> 02:41:58.911]  Absolutely, and again Operation Bojinka, for those that don't know, proved that the government knew about it.
[02:41:58.911 --> 02:42:02.835]  And look at Condoleezza Rice saying no one knew there was a planned attack.
[02:42:02.835 --> 02:42:11.184]  Mayor Willie Brown, it came out in the San Francisco Chronicle, called her, well she called him, and said don't fly to New York tomorrow.
[02:42:11.184 --> 02:42:12.906]  And again, it just shows that
[02:42:13.406 --> 02:42:16.107]  Not so much that she or even he were personally involved.
[02:42:16.107 --> 02:42:17.708]  It shows that they were warned.
[02:42:17.708 --> 02:42:18.389]  Sure.
[02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:21.030]  And it shows that everybody else was basically getting warned.
[02:42:21.030 --> 02:42:26.092]  And there were little kids in the news saying that they were warned not to go to school that week.
[02:42:26.092 --> 02:42:28.694]  It turns out everybody knew but the general public.
[02:42:28.694 --> 02:42:29.114]  That's right.
[02:42:29.114 --> 02:42:30.915]  But let me tell you something else.
[02:42:30.915 --> 02:42:34.116]  Now, you said that that ran in the San Francisco Chronicle, right?
[02:42:34.116 --> 02:42:34.717]  Yes.
[02:42:34.717 --> 02:42:36.378]  Now that's very important.
[02:42:36.378 --> 02:42:40.380]  It ran in the San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday.
[02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:40.880]  Did you hear me?
[02:42:42.048 --> 02:42:46.530]  Let me tell you another trick.
[02:42:46.530 --> 02:42:48.991]  Today is April Fool's Day, right?
[02:42:48.991 --> 02:42:49.531]  Yes.
[02:42:49.531 --> 02:42:51.632]  April the 1st, okay?
[02:42:51.632 --> 02:42:53.572]  Halloween, October.
[02:42:53.572 --> 02:42:57.414]  We never use a number for the month of the year.
[02:42:57.414 --> 02:43:01.835]  We always use the... and then the number.
[02:43:01.835 --> 02:43:03.136]  Why do we use numbers then?
[02:43:04.532 --> 02:43:04.612]  9-1-1.
[02:43:04.612 --> 02:43:06.113]  9-1-1.
[02:43:06.113 --> 02:43:06.954]  What is that?
[02:43:06.954 --> 02:43:12.099]  If you walked in the house and your mother, your son, your daughter, your wife was on the phone, you say, who are you talking to?
[02:43:12.099 --> 02:43:14.101]  They say, I just dialed 9-1-1.
[02:43:14.101 --> 02:43:16.983]  Think about the look that comes over your face.
[02:43:16.983 --> 02:43:19.746]  See, 9-1-1 tells the brain to be scared.
[02:43:19.746 --> 02:43:20.266]  That's right.
[02:43:20.266 --> 02:43:22.268]  No, they picked it on purpose.
[02:43:22.268 --> 02:43:24.811]  As a PSYOP, it's incredibly obvious.
[02:43:25.151 --> 02:43:31.374]  Yep, now, now, now, before that, you go back to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:43:31.374 --> 02:43:37.816]  Now, you can't get no more weird paper in America than the Washington Times.
[02:43:37.816 --> 02:43:42.158]  That's the old, old, uh, uh, what's his name, the Korean CIA?
[02:43:42.158 --> 02:43:43.539]  Yeah, the Mooney.
[02:43:43.539 --> 02:43:44.499]  The Mooney, nah, nah, nah.
[02:43:44.499 --> 02:43:45.140]  Reverend Mooney.
[02:43:45.140 --> 02:43:50.562]  Just, just imagine, in his paper, Wednesday, April the 22nd, 1998, headlines.
[02:43:53.823 --> 02:43:57.106]  FBI paid mortgage on Nichols' home.
[02:43:57.106 --> 02:44:13.199]  Remember, the FBI made mortgage payments on Terry Nichols' home after he was arrested and before he was convicted of conspiring to bomb the Oklahoma City federal building.
[02:44:13.199 --> 02:44:15.981]  Now, the court documents show this.
[02:44:15.981 --> 02:44:16.902]  Come out the court documents.
[02:44:16.902 --> 02:44:18.483]  Now watch this.
[02:44:18.483 --> 02:44:22.307]  A Justice Department spokesperson said,
[02:44:24.173 --> 02:44:33.350]  She did not know immediately why the government was making payments, nor the amount.
[02:44:33.350 --> 02:44:35.334]  Now she didn't say it didn't happen, okay?
[02:44:37.495 --> 02:44:38.455]  And it's the same thing.
[02:44:38.455 --> 02:44:42.136]  Almost all the hijackers had the FBI paying for their houses and tracking them.
[02:44:42.136 --> 02:44:44.157]  That was even in the AP.
[02:44:44.157 --> 02:44:45.057]  It's crazy!
[02:44:45.057 --> 02:44:46.157]  That's right.
[02:44:46.157 --> 02:44:50.198]  And so when you stop and think, now everybody said, well, wait a minute.
[02:44:50.198 --> 02:44:51.538]  How did they learn how to play?
[02:44:51.538 --> 02:44:53.799]  They said they was working on simulators.
[02:44:53.799 --> 02:44:54.539]  They had simulators.
[02:44:54.539 --> 02:44:58.660]  They went to school in Florida.
[02:44:58.660 --> 02:45:02.341]  Well, listen to this in the paper.
[02:45:04.830 --> 02:45:09.251]  The flight school owned by Warren Buffett.
[02:45:09.251 --> 02:45:10.511]  Okay.
[02:45:10.511 --> 02:45:20.094]  Again, you look at the... And you got Warren Buffett at the Moffett Air Force Base with hundreds of CEOs on September 11th, the morning, in a secret meeting.
[02:45:20.094 --> 02:45:20.854]  Yep.
[02:45:20.854 --> 02:45:24.355]  Including dozens that were supposed to be in the World Trade Center that morning.
[02:45:24.355 --> 02:45:24.715]  Yep.
[02:45:24.715 --> 02:45:26.135]  Now watch this.
[02:45:26.135 --> 02:45:27.695]  The Boston Globe.
[02:45:27.695 --> 02:45:29.636]  September the 18th.
[02:45:35.861 --> 02:45:42.824]  2001, flight school says FBI trained suspects prior to hijacking, okay?
[02:45:42.824 --> 02:45:55.209]  And so, the interesting thing is when the Condoleezza Rice, when that story ran in the San Francisco Chronicle, not another paper ran it.
[02:45:55.209 --> 02:46:01.411]  Now that's Friday, September the, no, the Friday before.
[02:46:04.674 --> 02:46:07.037]  Friday before, but that's Friday after.
[02:46:07.037 --> 02:46:10.222]  San Francisco Chronicle's front page story.
[02:46:10.222 --> 02:46:12.926]  It's the ex-Secretary of State, George Holtz.
[02:46:14.204 --> 02:46:19.989]  had received information the Friday before, not to go into New York to a certain meeting.
[02:46:19.989 --> 02:46:21.450]  He had to execute it.
[02:46:21.450 --> 02:46:25.033]  Not one paper ran that story.
[02:46:25.033 --> 02:46:32.458]  That's right, and then CNBC admitted that the Joint Chiefs were going to have a scheduled meeting September 11th in New York, but canceled it the day before.
[02:46:32.458 --> 02:46:33.359]  Yep, yep, yep.
[02:46:33.359 --> 02:46:43.227]  And so when you stop and think about, you know, so now you can get your message out there a little bit better because you got all these internet radios.
[02:46:44.286 --> 02:46:55.938]  And so when I stop and think about the first of the month headlines, JP Morgan bankers leaped to his death from skycraping Hong Kong.
[02:46:55.938 --> 02:46:58.020]  Do you realize they call it suicide?
[02:46:58.020 --> 02:47:00.683]  Well, let's let him get by with that for a minute.
[02:47:00.683 --> 02:47:01.804]  To his death.
[02:47:01.804 --> 02:47:05.588]  There's 18 suicide of major bankers.
[02:47:07.494 --> 02:47:09.295]  Yeah, and it's more than that last year.
[02:47:09.295 --> 02:47:10.596]  What do you think is going on?
[02:47:21.997 --> 02:47:26.499]  They say they shot itself in the head eight times.
[02:47:26.499 --> 02:47:28.840]  So why?
[02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:30.101]  Just play it straight.
[02:47:30.101 --> 02:47:33.363]  How come that story wasn't published?
[02:47:33.363 --> 02:47:40.706]  Now, let me show you, especially you Americans that love America, let me show you what it is to love.
[02:47:40.706 --> 02:47:49.791]  I ran for the president, the first Negro in the history of America to run for president of the United States.
[02:47:50.912 --> 02:47:51.312]  In 1968.
[02:47:51.312 --> 02:47:54.714]  So people said, well, uh, what about Jesse?
[02:47:54.714 --> 02:47:56.834]  No, they ran in the primary.
[02:47:56.834 --> 02:48:01.396]  And this president now, Obama, not won the primary.
[02:48:01.396 --> 02:48:06.338]  You sitting now talking to the only Negro that ran.
[02:48:06.338 --> 02:48:13.581]  I can't say that now because Obama ran, but all the other black folks, Shirley Chisholm, they was running in the primaries.
[02:48:13.581 --> 02:48:15.622]  Now, let me tell you what happened.
[02:48:15.622 --> 02:48:17.542]  They was planning on tricking.
[02:48:17.542 --> 02:48:19.163]  This was a Rockefeller trick.
[02:48:20.051 --> 02:48:28.773]  They was planning on tricking the election, okay, to put Rockefeller in the White House through Nixon.
[02:48:28.773 --> 02:48:31.054]  Nixon didn't know nothing about it.
[02:48:31.054 --> 02:48:41.376]  Nelson Rockefeller could not read or write, so he would have a hard time running for president because he couldn't read a speech.
[02:48:42.583 --> 02:48:46.869]  And his brother David, one of the greatest bankers in the world, couldn't read or write.
[02:48:46.869 --> 02:48:49.292]  Now when white folk can't read or write, they call it dyslexia.
[02:48:49.292 --> 02:48:52.497]  When black folk can't read or write, they say he didn't have a daddy at home.
[02:48:52.497 --> 02:48:55.841]  Okay, let me tell you something about this daddy at home crap.
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:48:59.461]  I was in the military.
[02:48:59.461 --> 02:49:00.861]  There was no war going on.
[02:49:00.861 --> 02:49:01.902]  I wasn't married.
[02:49:01.902 --> 02:49:03.162]  I didn't have a family.
[02:49:03.162 --> 02:49:14.147]  But if I was married and had a family, as long as America's telling you to go to the front line and kill somebody you don't know, that seems not to affect your family if you get killed.
[02:49:14.147 --> 02:49:20.049]  But if I walk out the house on my own, oh, the problem in the black community ain't no black man at home.
[02:49:20.049 --> 02:49:21.390]  Well, what about the Italian Mafia?
[02:49:22.519 --> 02:49:25.180]  99% of the Mafia was Italians.
[02:49:25.180 --> 02:49:27.281]  Now 99% of Italians wasn't Mafia.
[02:49:27.281 --> 02:49:29.141]  They go to church every day.
[02:49:29.141 --> 02:49:31.782]  Now you tell me about family value?
[02:49:31.782 --> 02:49:32.902]  Oh, Mamma Mia!
[02:49:32.902 --> 02:49:34.563]  And they go confess to the priest.
[02:49:34.563 --> 02:49:38.844]  Father Superior, I uh, I need, I need you to forgive me quick.
[02:49:38.844 --> 02:49:41.705]  I killed 27 people last night and you got to do it quick.
[02:49:41.705 --> 02:49:43.746]  I got 12 more to kill by noon.
[02:49:43.746 --> 02:49:46.386]  That, that don't seem to count, okay?
[02:49:46.386 --> 02:49:50.868]  But when it gets to me, I can take a prostitute after this show.
[02:49:51.773 --> 02:49:58.137]  Around the world, with me, and as long as I call that prostitute my secretary, that's a tax write-off.
[02:49:58.137 --> 02:49:59.398]  Y'all scared to mess with them.
[02:49:59.398 --> 02:50:00.239]  I'm talking about you.
[02:50:00.239 --> 02:50:03.441]  I'm talking about them people out there that think they love America.
[02:50:03.441 --> 02:50:05.862]  They don't dare mess with the mob.
[02:50:05.862 --> 02:50:09.445]  I mess with everybody out here who's wrong.
[02:50:09.445 --> 02:50:13.948]  And all I say, if you ever kill me, you didn't get an innocent bystander.
[02:50:13.948 --> 02:50:16.770]  Now let me tell you why I'm telling you about that election.
[02:50:16.770 --> 02:50:20.452]  They was gonna trick it so Nixon would win.
[02:50:21.334 --> 02:50:22.415]  Okay?
[02:50:22.415 --> 02:50:28.500]  And that's why they shot at George Wallace and meant to kill him because he would take votes away from them.
[02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:29.921]  Okay?
[02:50:29.921 --> 02:50:34.964]  Now, the election was on the 4th of November, 1968.
[02:50:34.964 --> 02:50:40.889]  This is the Wall Street Journal, y'all.
[02:50:40.889 --> 02:50:44.091]  Let me say it again, the Wall Street Journal.
[02:50:44.091 --> 02:50:46.513]  That Friday, hmm?
[02:50:46.513 --> 02:50:47.494]  November the 7th, 1968.
[02:50:49.318 --> 02:50:54.221]  Electronic Computers group gives Gregory 9 million votes.
[02:50:54.221 --> 02:50:57.762]  Did you hear that?
[02:50:57.762 --> 02:51:02.405]  And they go ahead to say that the big computer in New York City
[02:51:03.163 --> 02:51:09.367]  Declared Dick Gregory two hours after the election, the next President of the United States.
[02:51:09.367 --> 02:51:10.268]  Okay?
[02:51:10.268 --> 02:51:14.250]  Because I got nine million votes in Pennsylvania alone.
[02:51:14.250 --> 02:51:16.051]  That wasn't meant for me.
[02:51:16.051 --> 02:51:18.193]  Somebody hooked the wire up wrong.
[02:51:18.193 --> 02:51:24.417]  And so they had to shut all them computers down at midnight.
[02:51:24.417 --> 02:51:24.677]  Okay?
[02:51:25.345 --> 02:51:27.546]  Now that's y'all's democracy.
[02:51:27.546 --> 02:51:36.688]  Anytime you have a democracy... Look, if our democracy is so good, why are we running all over the world trying to force it down people with a gun?
[02:51:36.688 --> 02:51:39.049]  Anything good, you don't have to force on nobody.
[02:51:39.049 --> 02:51:40.949]  Ask a prostitute, okay?
[02:51:40.949 --> 02:51:48.691]  And so consequently, when we wake up and see where this is going, it's too late.
[02:51:48.691 --> 02:51:49.151]  Okay?
[02:51:49.151 --> 02:51:49.851]  It's too late.
[02:51:49.851 --> 02:51:52.092]  And so consequently, what we're looking at
[02:51:52.831 --> 02:51:57.214]  Oh yeah, there's warriors out here, and they kill me tomorrow.
[02:51:57.214 --> 02:51:57.694]  I died.
[02:51:57.694 --> 02:52:01.937]  I told my wife and family, it's not about us.
[02:52:01.937 --> 02:52:04.839]  Liberation is not in my house.
[02:52:04.839 --> 02:52:06.761]  And I spent millions of dollars.
[02:52:06.761 --> 02:52:09.142]  It meant don't send the children to college.
[02:52:09.142 --> 02:52:11.124]  I was willing to pay that.
[02:52:11.124 --> 02:52:17.888]  And so consequently, all the stuff, I've been doing it for so long, so I've got powerful white folks that have to do it.
[02:52:17.888 --> 02:52:20.030]  They hate they got to do it, so they bring it to me.
[02:52:20.834 --> 02:52:35.101]  And so consequently, if your listeners look up the island of Diego Garcia, how it factors in, now listen to this, to the Malaysian flight there, ABC put that out!
[02:52:35.101 --> 02:52:35.781]  They slipped!
[02:52:36.770 --> 02:52:38.711]  All you got to do is pull it up.
[02:52:38.711 --> 02:52:39.671]  March 10th.
[02:52:39.671 --> 02:52:41.172]  Yeah, that's the big U.S.
[02:52:41.172 --> 02:52:42.333]  military base.
[02:52:42.333 --> 02:52:48.595]  Oh, it's a big, nasty, vicious military base where they do all kinds of dirty things.
[02:52:48.595 --> 02:52:51.837]  And if you want to find that plane, look there for it.
[02:52:51.837 --> 02:52:52.797]  Okay?
[02:52:52.797 --> 02:52:59.480]  And so, consequently, what we're looking at is... Now, here's how it works down.
[02:52:59.480 --> 02:53:00.360]  There was 18.
[02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:05.263]  There was more than that, but the top group was 18.
[02:53:07.003 --> 02:53:10.967]  Scientists on that plane.
[02:53:10.967 --> 02:53:11.927]  Mm-hmm.
[02:53:11.927 --> 02:53:12.788]  Where did they work?
[02:53:12.788 --> 02:53:16.511]  They were, they were, they were Asians, but they worked out of Texas.
[02:53:16.511 --> 02:53:17.532]  Texas Institute.
[02:53:17.532 --> 02:53:19.975]  Texas Institute.
[02:53:19.975 --> 02:53:22.417]  And connected with Boeing.
[02:53:22.417 --> 02:53:24.499]  And so, they wasn't going there.
[02:53:24.499 --> 02:53:26.000]  They was going on another assignment.
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:33.787]  What America will do, it will let a lot of companies, lots of companies, they will let them
[02:53:35.552 --> 02:53:38.696]  I understand.
[02:53:38.696 --> 02:53:39.456]  What's your bottom line?
[02:53:39.456 --> 02:53:43.301]  Because I want to play a clip of your new film and have you back in a few weeks to get into that.
[02:53:43.301 --> 02:53:45.924]  diggregory.com to find the film.
[02:53:45.924 --> 02:53:47.205]  That's Unsung Hollywood.
[02:53:47.205 --> 02:53:48.566]  But briefly, what do you think happened with the plane?
[02:53:55.120 --> 02:53:55.881]  Uh, plane.
[02:53:55.881 --> 02:54:01.666]  Twenty passengers work for Electronic Warfare and Military Radar.
[02:54:01.666 --> 02:54:02.326]  Yes.
[02:54:02.326 --> 02:54:08.692]  Okay, now, they had just came up with something, and what I understand, real evil stuff they're doing.
[02:54:08.692 --> 02:54:18.980]  And so, the patent, so, it was four of them out of the group that had filed for patent, and the fifth person was the Carlisle Group, okay?
[02:54:18.980 --> 02:54:19.981]  Yes, I knew that.
[02:54:19.981 --> 02:54:23.384]  Now, when those four disappear, get killed,
[02:54:24.292 --> 02:54:25.133]  Okay?
[02:54:25.133 --> 02:54:29.959]  The patent was not granted till four days after the plane was missing.
[02:54:29.959 --> 02:54:31.321]  Okay?
[02:54:31.321 --> 02:54:32.021]  The patent.
[02:54:32.021 --> 02:54:38.670]  Now, if you had one of those patents, your family don't get it because
[02:54:39.577 --> 02:54:42.679]  The plane was missing or you were dead before you got a bullet in the back.
[02:54:42.679 --> 02:54:48.342]  Well I've seen this before when you've got like 50 Egyptian top generals on an aircraft it just disappears.
[02:54:48.342 --> 02:54:52.024]  When you've got Congressman McDonald on a plane with key people it disappears.
[02:54:52.024 --> 02:55:01.889]  We've seen this before and I've said from the beginning that it could be a brain heist or a way to get rid of some people and they just redirect it to a military base and Dick Gregory I think you're on it again.
[02:55:02.429 --> 02:55:05.392]  Promise to come back in the next two weeks commercial-free.
[02:55:05.392 --> 02:55:06.292]  It's always amazing.
[02:55:06.292 --> 02:55:11.437]  Briefly, we're going to play a few minutes from the new film that folks can find out about at DickGregory.com.
[02:55:11.437 --> 02:55:14.339]  60 seconds on Unsung Hollywood.
[02:55:14.339 --> 02:55:15.240]  My pleasure, brother.
[02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:15.801]  Thank you.
[02:55:15.801 --> 02:55:17.702]  Briefly, tell us about Unsung Hollywood.
[02:55:17.702 --> 02:55:26.049]  Unsung Hollywood is a black TV one owned by Cathy Hughes and her son.
[02:55:26.049 --> 02:55:29.993]  And they decided to tell the world about a lot of black folks
[02:55:30.712 --> 02:55:34.516]  That you wouldn't see on NBC, CBS, and ABC.
[02:55:34.516 --> 02:55:39.221]  And so this year was a new series, and they filmed me.
[02:55:39.221 --> 02:55:47.009]  And just the American people just, I mean, they see new things, see things about me now they never heard before, okay?
[02:55:47.009 --> 02:55:49.632]  They never knew what I was involved in.
[02:55:49.992 --> 02:55:56.455]  I was about to say John Singleton said they only allow a certain stereotype of black people out, the big director.
[02:55:56.455 --> 02:55:58.076]  And so that's basically what this is about.
[02:55:58.076 --> 02:56:01.858]  We'll have you back in the next two weeks to talk more about Unsung Hollywood.
[02:56:01.858 --> 02:56:05.800]  We'll end the show with a couple minutes from the intro of the TV special.
[02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:07.341]  See the whole thing at DickGregory.com.
[02:56:07.341 --> 02:56:10.003]  Here it is.
[02:56:10.003 --> 02:56:12.444]  Ladies and gentlemen, Dick Gregory!
[02:56:17.443 --> 02:56:27.012]  I can say thank you very much, and when they say this show features living color, you better believe it.
[02:56:27.012 --> 02:56:35.159]  1961, Dick Gregory was at the top of his game, changing the way America talked and joked about race.
[02:56:35.159 --> 02:56:38.562]  I found out that cold weather makes it very nice for race relations.
[02:56:39.904 --> 02:56:48.450]  Last month, when it was 15 below zero in Chicago, I walked out of a nightclub, a drunk walked up to me and said, why don't you get back to Africa where you belong and take me with you?
[02:56:48.450 --> 02:56:52.272]  It's beyond skillful.
[02:56:52.272 --> 02:56:54.394]  It's almost like he made it up.
[02:56:54.394 --> 02:56:58.917]  He invented the whole concept of addressing this really serious issue.
[02:57:00.802 --> 02:57:07.188]  There was never, ever a black comic talked about racism to white America and made jokes of it.
[02:57:07.188 --> 02:57:16.237]  I had to fly to Kansas City, Missouri the other day to help out a friend of mine, a white cat who moved into an all-colored neighborhood.
[02:57:16.237 --> 02:57:20.841]  And some colored bigot burned a watermelon on his front lawn.
[02:57:20.841 --> 02:57:22.183]  I remember the Dick Gregory book, Nigger.
[02:57:23.686 --> 02:57:24.807]  And I was like, wow.
[02:57:24.807 --> 02:57:31.656]  The idea that he was radical enough to challenge both white and black sensibilities was really major.
[02:57:31.656 --> 02:57:38.264]  He said the book is to his mother, so that every time she hears the word, she'll think they're talking about her son's book.
[02:57:40.251 --> 02:57:45.835]  Gregory's daring riffs turned him into stand-up's first black superstar.
[02:57:45.835 --> 02:57:51.519]  I went from $1,500 a year to $3 million the next 18 months.
[02:57:51.519 --> 02:57:55.342]  At one time, he was the highest paid black entertainer in America.
[02:57:55.342 --> 02:57:57.323]  I was the hippest thing.
[02:57:57.323 --> 02:57:59.345]  I was like something new on the planet.
[02:58:03.032 --> 02:58:10.674]  But at the height of his success, Dick Gregory turned his back on stand-up in favor of taking a stand.
[02:58:10.674 --> 02:58:14.515]  I witnessed Dick Gregory turn down thousands of dollars.
[02:58:14.515 --> 02:58:20.277]  He said, I would rather be free than rich.
[02:58:20.277 --> 02:58:23.938]  He went back down south on some, like some Harriet Tubman s***.
[02:58:23.938 --> 02:58:25.038]  Like, I gotta go get the others.
[02:58:30.125 --> 02:58:32.268]  This was for real for Dick.
