[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:38.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:38.600 --> 00:44.920]  Well, April Fools, ladies and gentlemen, and the joke is on all of us, Obamacare, ladies
[00:44.920 --> 00:50.440]  and gentlemen, your time has come and gone to register, to sign up so the IRS can grab
[00:50.440 --> 00:55.600]  your bank account, levy your wages and put penalties and interest on you.
[00:55.600 --> 00:59.480]  We've had multiple members of our crew try to go sign up for Obamacare as a test.
[00:59.480 --> 01:03.720]  We're going to have Joe in here later, one of the engineers, and it was impossible, and
[01:03.720 --> 01:10.600]  he's very internet savvy, as they say, it is a complete and total fraud, but lest it
[01:10.600 --> 01:18.000]  be one-sided, I will open the phones up today for supporters of Obamacare to call in on
[01:18.000 --> 01:23.200]  the broadcast and give us their take on everything.
[01:23.200 --> 01:29.800]  Also, scooting over here to get my guest folder, I always forget to move over here.
[01:29.800 --> 01:36.080]  We have Dick Gregory joining us, coming up in the third hour today to give us his take
[01:36.080 --> 01:39.440]  on Lord Obama, the state of the world, and so much more.
[01:39.440 --> 01:45.640]  Famous civil rights activist Dick Gregory will be joining us, coming up in the third
[01:45.640 --> 01:50.360]  hour, and we will take your calls for Mr. Gregory as well.
[01:50.360 --> 01:53.360]  So that is coming up today.
[01:53.360 --> 01:56.320]  Of course, never mind the fact that Obamacare is not broken.
[01:56.320 --> 02:01.240]  The war on drugs is not broken, the war on illiteracy is not broken.
[02:01.240 --> 02:06.240]  It is designed to ship in more drugs and keep them illegal to keep the prices up.
[02:06.240 --> 02:07.240]  That's the war on drugs.
[02:07.240 --> 02:11.160]  The war on illiteracy is designed to dumb people down.
[02:11.160 --> 02:12.160]  They've done a great job.
[02:12.160 --> 02:15.720]  They teach two plus two equals five in public school now.
[02:15.720 --> 02:17.880]  That tells you everything you need to know.
[02:17.880 --> 02:22.160]  That's not some Kurt Vonnegut grand faloon joke.
[02:22.160 --> 02:23.480]  That is real.
[02:23.480 --> 02:24.480]  That is happening.
[02:24.480 --> 02:29.160]  All you need to know is that this government run by these social engineers wants your children
[02:29.160 --> 02:34.200]  to believe two plus two equals five, or if the answer is 300, you say 200 because that's
[02:34.200 --> 02:35.200]  more friendly.
[02:35.200 --> 02:37.160]  You're like, what does that even mean?
[02:37.160 --> 02:40.360]  Well, a number that's too high is kind of uppity.
[02:40.360 --> 02:47.320]  It's total disinformation programming to destroy logic being pumped in.
[02:47.320 --> 02:51.920]  There it is, the Daily Caller, the common core math problem, ask kids to write the friendly
[02:51.920 --> 02:53.720]  answer instead of the correct one.
[02:53.720 --> 02:58.600]  The second graders answers to common core aligned math worksheet were marked as incorrect
[02:58.600 --> 03:02.160]  because they weren't friendly enough, even though they were the right answers.
[03:02.160 --> 03:08.240]  I mean, I'm not making that up.
[03:08.240 --> 03:14.360]  You say this stuff and you laugh because it's so hardcore.
[03:14.360 --> 03:15.360]  They're not failing.
[03:15.360 --> 03:19.520]  They've done this country down from the highest test scores 50 years ago to the lowest in
[03:19.520 --> 03:22.800]  the industrialized world and behind a whole bunch of third world countries.
[03:22.800 --> 03:26.360]  You've got the most drugs on the streets of any country per capita in the world, the biggest
[03:26.360 --> 03:31.200]  prison population, the highest cancer rate.
[03:31.200 --> 03:34.360]  They've taken everything that was good about this country and have tried to turn it on
[03:34.360 --> 03:35.360]  its head.
[03:35.360 --> 03:40.600]  They're involved in total war against society, but none of that matters because here's the
[03:40.600 --> 03:45.360]  article up on info wars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:45.360 --> 03:52.280]  Some Obama supporters still think it's racist to oppose Obamacare and we actually have the
[03:52.280 --> 03:54.880]  tweets at Bill O'Reilly.
[03:54.880 --> 03:56.720]  I can't, I can't read the rest of it.
[03:56.720 --> 04:00.320]  I saw a pic with him saying something about Obamacare.
[04:00.320 --> 04:06.600]  It's obvious he's racist, redneck, shriveled up ass.
[04:06.600 --> 04:10.360]  I mean, Bill O'Reilly is a total establishment type.
[04:10.360 --> 04:12.560]  I wouldn't even call him a conservative.
[04:12.560 --> 04:19.840]  He's more like a mainline fake populist who's constantly doing horrible things to me on
[04:19.840 --> 04:27.040]  air, but the point is, is that he's not a shriveled redneck and I don't think he ever
[04:27.040 --> 04:31.200]  went out and got a suntan in his life on the back of his neck working outside.
[04:31.200 --> 04:36.560]  Why is it so racist against white people if they have a tan, meaning they work outside?
[04:36.560 --> 04:38.640]  I mean, we're not allowed to work outside.
[04:38.640 --> 04:39.640]  I love a tan.
[04:39.640 --> 04:41.360]  I mean, I can get darker.
[04:41.360 --> 04:42.480]  Most Mexicans, I know.
[04:42.480 --> 04:44.520]  Is there something wrong with that?
[04:44.520 --> 04:48.920]  Anyways, we're going to come back, ladies and gentlemen, and go into more of these because
[04:48.920 --> 04:53.200]  they are hilarious, but these people are serious, man.
[04:53.200 --> 05:00.920]  They think if you don't like to screw Jabba Obama, it's because he's black.
[05:00.920 --> 05:06.000]  Introducing Pro 1, all of your filtration in one system, portable on the go.
[05:06.000 --> 05:10.560]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.

[05:21.680 --> 05:26.600]  aqua medics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one
[05:26.600 --> 05:27.600]  filter element.

[06:00.120 --> 06:02.840]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[06:02.840 --> 06:08.320]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriotSupply.
[06:08.320 --> 06:11.680]  A couple years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the
[06:11.680 --> 06:15.600]  direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick
[06:15.600 --> 06:16.600]  buck.
[06:16.600 --> 06:20.720]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[06:20.720 --> 06:24.720]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[06:24.720 --> 06:30.000]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000]  and women.
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach and that's why I stock MyPantry
[06:36.000 --> 06:39.200]  with high quality, storable foods for MyPatriotSupply.

[07:00.000 --> 07:03.800]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also
[07:03.800 --> 07:08.920]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[07:08.920 --> 07:12.960]  For more than a decade, My Favorite Coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[07:12.960 --> 07:17.320]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[07:17.320 --> 07:22.640]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[07:22.640 --> 07:29.040]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at InfowarsLife.com.
[07:29.040 --> 07:34.160]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn
[07:34.160 --> 07:36.280]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[07:36.280 --> 07:40.560]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[07:40.560 --> 07:43.320]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[07:43.320 --> 07:48.000]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.080]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[07:51.080 --> 07:56.000]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.880]  my favorite coffee available at infowarslife.com.
[08:00.880 --> 08:02.560]  SAC this is Crystal Palace, Inc.
[08:02.560 --> 08:06.240]  No radders declare DEF CON 3, scramble all alert aircraft.
[08:06.240 --> 08:09.920]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[08:09.920 --> 08:14.640]  The Whopper spends all it's time thinking about World War 3.
[08:14.640 --> 08:18.160]  Target selection complete, time on target sequence complete.
[08:18.160 --> 08:25.840]  22 Typhoon class submarines departing Petropavlov turning south out of North Cap bearing 095 degrees.
[08:25.840 --> 08:30.800]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaskan air defense zone.
[08:30.800 --> 08:34.680]  From the front lines of the information war.
[08:34.680 --> 08:40.800]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode, we are at DEF CON 1.
[08:40.800 --> 08:43.280]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[08:43.280 --> 08:44.240]  You bitch!
[08:44.240 --> 08:48.560]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[08:48.560 --> 08:52.240]  We'll keep control but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[08:52.240 --> 08:59.040]  Three, two, one, impact shall we play a game.
[08:59.040 --> 09:04.960]  How about global thermal nuclear war?
[09:04.960 --> 09:09.760]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[09:09.760 --> 09:13.680]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready awaiting launch codes.
[09:13.680 --> 09:15.360]  We are in a launch mode.
[09:15.360 --> 09:19.200]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[09:19.200 --> 09:23.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[09:23.600 --> 09:25.040]  We're in.
[09:25.040 --> 09:26.800]  Russians are still denying everything sir.
[09:26.800 --> 09:29.360]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[09:29.360 --> 09:31.360]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[09:31.360 --> 09:33.440]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[09:33.440 --> 09:35.040]  Things end.
[09:35.040 --> 09:42.960]  The only winning goal is not to die.
[09:42.960 --> 09:46.960]  Everything is in April fools for the globalists that run this planet.
[09:46.960 --> 09:51.200]  The Federal Reserve is not federal, it's a private front group for a consortium of six
[09:51.200 --> 09:56.880]  megabanks publicly that set it up in 1913 to establish the Federal Reserve that same year,
[09:56.880 --> 10:01.360]  that same week, to fund the system and defund the federal government,
[10:01.360 --> 10:06.400]  making it a bankrupt institution, living us towards the War Powers Act in 1933
[10:06.400 --> 10:11.520]  and the Declaration of Martial Law and the United States going into receivership ever since then.
[10:12.160 --> 10:14.560]  The new order is not coming, it's been here for a while.
[10:14.560 --> 10:17.600]  We're just getting deeper into the swamp as they say.
[10:18.400 --> 10:21.920]  There's the hoax of the drug war where they ship the drugs into the launder the money and
[10:21.920 --> 10:23.840]  more drugs come in, more people go to prison,
[10:23.840 --> 10:25.360]  largest prison population in the world.
[10:25.360 --> 10:30.800]  There's the hoax of illiteracy and the war on illiteracy that's designed to teach kids 2 plus 2
[10:30.800 --> 10:32.320]  equals 5 as I was saying earlier.
[10:33.280 --> 10:36.480]  There's the hoax the Russians attacked Georgia in 2008.
[10:36.480 --> 10:41.120]  There's the hoax that the Russians have been invading Ukraine when the West over through
[10:41.120 --> 10:45.520]  the Ukrainian government took 93% of the country, the Russians just grabbed their military bases
[10:45.520 --> 10:47.120]  and pipelines on their border.
[10:48.640 --> 10:52.880]  But you watch our controlled media, you'd think the Russians are massing troops and invading.
[10:53.840 --> 10:58.560]  And if they keep massing NATO forces in Ukraine, the Russians may come in.
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.720]  And the globalists just love that because that's an even bigger political diversion for them.
[11:05.840 --> 11:10.400]  Just like they're funding al-Qaeda all over the world to run around and engage in all sorts of
[11:10.400 --> 11:14.720]  terror attacks and destabilization because they get to spend trillions then fighting them.
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.600]  Of course, they don't really fight them.
[11:17.600 --> 11:18.960]  Oh, we're not going to go to Saudi Arabia.
[11:18.960 --> 11:24.400]  We're going to go to Iraq and invade you and overthrow you because you're the arch enemy
[11:24.400 --> 11:26.000]  of al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia.
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.760]  And then we're going to bring al-Qaeda in and put them in charge of half the country as they've
[11:29.760 --> 11:34.240]  now done and put burkas on women's heads and turn off the movie theaters and the rock and roll
[11:34.240 --> 11:41.760]  stations and get rid of the swimming pools. Iraq is, conservatively, I don't know, I've seen
[11:41.760 --> 11:49.040]  mainline secular think tanks say it's five times worse and is now a jihadi paradise.
[11:50.160 --> 11:52.880]  Why they're even starting the sexual mutilations of the women there.
[11:53.600 --> 11:54.560]  Same thing in Libya.
[11:55.120 --> 12:02.320]  They tried to take over Egypt in the last three years, but the government, the military,
[12:02.320 --> 12:07.200]  didn't put up with that. So they, they didn't put up with the public crucifixions of Christians
[12:07.200 --> 12:12.000]  and blowing up of churches daily and non radical Muslim mosque.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.560]  So the military stood up to them, not even saying the military is good.
[12:14.560 --> 12:15.520]  It's just compared to al-Qaeda.
[12:15.520 --> 12:16.160]  They're good.
[12:16.160 --> 12:22.480]  I mean, I mean, this is the type of craziness that's going on and it's all a giant hoax.
[12:22.480 --> 12:27.600]  The Gardasil shot in the trials eight years ago killed a bunch of people that took it.
[12:27.600 --> 12:33.360]  Then Rick Perry came out and said, it's the law to take Gardasil.
[12:33.360 --> 12:34.880]  Remember that in 2008?
[12:35.600 --> 12:36.960]  Was it 2007?
[12:36.960 --> 12:38.240]  There was no law.
[12:38.240 --> 12:42.080]  Everybody said, well, it's the law the governor says and they went out and got the shot and
[12:42.080 --> 12:44.800]  had autoimmune disorders, death, you name it.
[12:44.800 --> 12:46.880]  We were on air saying it's going to kill people.
[12:46.880 --> 12:49.600]  It's going to cause people to be paralyzed.
[12:49.600 --> 12:58.480]  Its main operation is to attack the female reproductive organs, the ovaries, the equivalent
[12:58.480 --> 13:00.000]  of the female testicles.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.120]  Of course now, well, lo and behold, who would have known Gardasil basically attacks and
[13:05.120 --> 13:11.440]  creates autoimmune inflammation causing cancers in the ovaries.
[13:11.440 --> 13:12.480]  Oh my goodness.
[13:12.480 --> 13:18.720]  Now, mainline medical literature banned in Japan, banned in India,
[13:18.720 --> 13:20.960]  being banned in areas of Europe.
[13:20.960 --> 13:22.640]  You're going, Alex, where are you going with all this?
[13:22.640 --> 13:23.600]  It's hoaxes.
[13:23.600 --> 13:24.560]  It's hoaxes.
[13:24.560 --> 13:25.680]  It's hoaxes.
[13:25.680 --> 13:31.360]  The Gardasil shot said it only protected you from four different papilloma strains when
[13:31.360 --> 13:37.120]  there's thousands and you only have 3,000 papilloma deaths a year in the U.S.
[13:37.120 --> 13:39.200]  out of 315 million folks.
[13:39.200 --> 13:41.600]  It's one of the rarest cancers out there.
[13:42.480 --> 13:43.120]  Now, there it is.
[13:43.120 --> 13:47.920]  Merck, researcher admits Gardasil guards against nothing, almost nothing.
[13:47.920 --> 13:51.200]  Read the literature, read the stink and insert.
[13:51.200 --> 13:51.840]  That's what I mean.
[13:52.880 --> 13:55.760]  I have parents come to me on the street and they go, Alex, we've been listening to you
[13:55.760 --> 14:00.480]  for years, but we just, we just went to the school and they told us you're lying and we're
[14:00.480 --> 14:01.840]  really surprised in you.
[14:02.880 --> 14:07.920]  And, you know, there is a law that our sons and daughters have to take all the vaccines
[14:07.920 --> 14:08.560]  to go to school.
[14:08.560 --> 14:10.800]  And if we don't, the police come for truancy.
[14:11.680 --> 14:14.560]  And I look at them and I say, there is no state in the country,
[14:14.560 --> 14:19.360]  but California and New York, where they can claim they have mandatory inoculations and
[14:19.360 --> 14:20.320]  even there, it's a fraud.
[14:22.320 --> 14:25.040]  And they say, but the school tells us that's not the case.
[14:27.360 --> 14:33.120]  And I say, listen, it's federal and state law that they have to have a waiver from,
[14:33.120 --> 14:36.400]  quote, policy under state health department rules.
[14:36.400 --> 14:42.000]  It's a policy to say they want you to have all these vaccines.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.360]  It's a policy you have to have these vaccines to go to a college.
[14:46.640 --> 14:48.480]  They lie and tell you it's mandatory.
[14:48.480 --> 14:52.400]  Then they kick you out of the public school, triggering truancy.
[14:53.200 --> 15:02.160]  Then they call the police who fraudulently apply the truancy when the truancy isn't
[15:02.160 --> 15:04.320]  truancy if you were kicked out of school.
[15:04.320 --> 15:05.040]  Do you understand that?
[15:05.600 --> 15:09.120]  But the family court judges the police, they all play along with it.
[15:09.120 --> 15:13.200]  Most of the police are just ignorant of it, just like the public, do you understand?
[15:14.400 --> 15:16.080]  And they lie and they go, there is no waiver.
[15:16.080 --> 15:21.520]  There is a waiver in the nurses office and in the principal's office and the assistant
[15:21.520 --> 15:22.640]  principal's office.
[15:22.640 --> 15:27.040]  And if you simply go to the online website of the state health department of Connecticut or
[15:27.040 --> 15:35.120]  Texas or Missouri or California or any other state, there are the forms where you simply
[15:35.120 --> 15:39.760]  tell them for religious or other reasons why you're not doing it or doctor.
[15:40.800 --> 15:44.640]  But it's a waiver for something that isn't even a law, so that's a fraud.
[15:44.640 --> 15:48.000]  It's kind of like getting a concealed carry to carry a concealed handgun when you could
[15:48.000 --> 15:50.480]  just carry it openly in almost every state under law.
[15:50.480 --> 15:52.160]  It's running a right into a privilege.
[15:52.160 --> 15:53.280]  But the point is they lie to you.
[15:53.280 --> 15:54.240]  It's a hoax.
[15:54.240 --> 15:59.440]  Every year on every news channel of state-run media and print, all the local whore papers,
[15:59.440 --> 16:00.960]  they say, it's the law.
[16:00.960 --> 16:06.400]  This August at Zilker Park, a free inoculation in Austin, and change Zilker Park to your
[16:06.400 --> 16:09.040]  city park or your city gymnasium.
[16:09.040 --> 16:12.320]  And the kids show up by the thousands and get the mandatory shots.
[16:12.320 --> 16:15.840]  They have ambulances there because some collapse, some have convulsions on the spot,
[16:15.840 --> 16:16.800]  some die on the spot.
[16:17.600 --> 16:18.160]  But that's all.
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.440]  A cost-benefit analysis, as one health department official told me, who's over the state actuary
[16:23.440 --> 16:28.640]  here in Texas, he hikes the same place I do with his girlfriend who also works at the
[16:28.640 --> 16:29.360]  state health department.
[16:29.360 --> 16:33.600]  And he said they listened to the show and know that vaccines are killing people, but
[16:33.600 --> 16:37.360]  that it's just going to continue because it saves more people than it hurts.
[16:37.360 --> 16:39.440]  And I began to argue with him on those numbers.
[16:40.320 --> 16:41.200]  But there I was.
[16:41.200 --> 16:42.400]  He said, this is all off record.
[16:43.120 --> 16:46.720]  You can say I work in the state in this, but just don't say my name.
[16:49.520 --> 16:52.320]  In fact, he even let me videotape it so I could look up the stuff he was telling me.
[16:52.880 --> 16:54.400]  I even had that on my iPhone.
[16:55.040 --> 16:56.400]  That's about three months ago.
[16:56.400 --> 17:00.000]  The point is, is that him and his girlfriend both work at the health department.
[17:00.000 --> 17:01.120]  He's one of the top people.
[17:02.080 --> 17:03.600]  In fact, I'm not going to say exactly what he is.
[17:03.600 --> 17:04.720]  He is the head of something.
[17:04.720 --> 17:05.760]  I'll just leave it at that.
[17:05.760 --> 17:06.960]  I looked him up, sure enough.
[17:07.600 --> 17:09.600]  And he was there admitting it to me.
[17:09.600 --> 17:14.800]  And it's so frustrating that they will tell you there are no side effects.
[17:14.800 --> 17:16.480]  And it's the law you got to take it.
[17:16.480 --> 17:17.760]  And there is no law.
[17:17.760 --> 17:23.760]  And the insert sheet that comes with the vaccine reads like a horror movie.
[17:24.640 --> 17:26.080]  Now, here's what I want to do today.
[17:26.080 --> 17:29.840]  I want to come back and cover the latest on Obamacare and the April fools.
[17:29.840 --> 17:31.120]  There will be no April fools here.
[17:31.120 --> 17:33.120]  We're all April fools under this new world order.
[17:33.120 --> 17:37.200]  And then I want to get your stories of what you think are major hoaxes.
[17:38.480 --> 17:40.400]  Patriot Act is called patriotic.
[17:40.400 --> 17:41.760]  It's the opposite of patriotism.
[17:41.760 --> 17:43.280]  It destroys our Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[17:43.280 --> 17:47.200]  Eviscerate seven of the 10 First Amendments on record.
[17:49.840 --> 17:53.360]  Now, if you expand on that, you got the new freedom initiative,
[17:53.360 --> 17:55.520]  the drug advocates in the schools calling it new freedom.
[17:55.520 --> 17:58.080]  You've got the patient protection, affordable care act.
[17:58.080 --> 18:01.120]  It doesn't protect the patient's data, lets it become public,
[18:01.120 --> 18:02.960]  shares with all these private and corporate groups.
[18:03.680 --> 18:04.640]  It is an affordable.
[18:04.640 --> 18:08.640]  It's all a sick joke written by ruthless insurance companies
[18:08.640 --> 18:12.000]  as a open corporate tax ruled by the Supreme Court
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.400]  to predominantly offshore tax exempt groups like Warren Buffett,
[18:17.360 --> 18:19.360]  who runs around lobbying for big government all day
[18:19.360 --> 18:21.440]  because he gets the corporate welfare out of it.
[18:21.440 --> 18:29.360]  But again, it's all just hoaxes, hoaxes, hoaxes, hoaxes, hoaxes,
[18:29.360 --> 18:30.880]  GMO crops, total hoax.
[18:31.600 --> 18:33.520]  Farmers that use it, in most cases, turn out to be only
[18:33.520 --> 18:36.000]  it ruins their productivity and ruins their fields
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.880]  and ends up bankrupting them and Monsanto changes all the rules.
[18:38.880 --> 18:40.560]  I mean, it's all a hoax.
[18:40.560 --> 18:42.080]  Carbon taxes, a hoax.
[18:42.080 --> 18:43.680]  Smart meters are not smart.
[18:43.680 --> 18:45.280]  They're spy meters, a hoax.
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  The global warming movement, a hoax.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.680]  Obama in all of his energy programs, a hoax.
[18:51.680 --> 18:53.680]  Obama's saying he wouldn't come out for the guns, a hoax.
[18:53.680 --> 18:56.000]  Obama's saying he wouldn't hire lobbyists, a hoax.
[18:56.000 --> 18:58.320]  Obama's saying he wouldn't have signing statements, a hoax.
[18:59.120 --> 19:01.280]  Obama's saying he would try to stop racism.
[19:01.280 --> 19:03.040]  All he does is promote it, a hoax.
[19:03.760 --> 19:05.120]  A hoax, a hoax, a hoax.
[19:05.120 --> 19:07.920]  Welcome to Planet Hoax on April 1st.
[19:10.400 --> 19:13.840]  And almost everyone's seeing their premiums go up
[19:13.840 --> 19:15.600]  and Sibelius gets asked about it.
[19:15.600 --> 19:18.080]  And Sibelius gets asked about it and she says, I have no comment.
[19:18.080 --> 19:18.960]  I don't care.
[19:18.960 --> 19:20.240]  So we're going to play that clip coming up.
[19:20.240 --> 19:22.000]  But I don't want to just talk about your experiences
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.280]  with Obamacare or if you're a supporter with it or if you love it.
[19:25.840 --> 19:27.440]  Maybe you're a seminar caller from the Democrats
[19:27.440 --> 19:28.000]  you want to call them.
[19:28.000 --> 19:29.360]  It'll be interesting to hear what you have to say.
[19:30.720 --> 19:31.840]  Not just the Obama issue.
[19:31.840 --> 19:33.280]  What about hoaxes?
[19:33.280 --> 19:35.280]  Things that you think are hoaxes out there.
[19:35.280 --> 19:39.600]  Toll free number to join us 800-259-9231.
[19:41.120 --> 19:41.920]  First time callers.
[19:41.920 --> 19:43.200]  I want to mention that because when we don't say
[19:43.200 --> 19:46.000]  first time callers, we get a lot of the seminar callers.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.160]  The point is is that 800-259-9231.
[19:50.160 --> 19:51.680]  That's trained political callers.
[19:51.680 --> 19:54.400]  800-259-9231.
[19:54.960 --> 19:56.320]  We're going to hear from you on,
[19:56.320 --> 20:25.920]  do you think this is Planet Hoax or is Obama our Lord and Savior?
[20:25.920 --> 20:32.160]  Do you really know how pure your water is?
[20:32.160 --> 20:34.320]  It's taken for granted that bottled water
[20:34.320 --> 20:36.480]  and even home filtered water is pure.
[20:36.480 --> 20:38.960]  But it is not the purest water you can drink.
[20:38.960 --> 20:41.600]  There is only one way to get the purest water
[20:41.600 --> 20:43.040]  and that's with a new appliance
[20:43.040 --> 20:45.120]  that no healthy kitchen should be without.
[20:45.120 --> 20:48.160]  An H2O Labs countertop home water system.

[20:51.200 --> 20:54.000]  And you will be drinking the purest water you've ever had.

[20:56.960 --> 21:25.120]  That's h2olabs.com.
[21:27.280 --> 21:29.280]  Inside the body as well as out.
[21:29.280 --> 21:31.200]  The science digest journal says,
[21:31.200 --> 21:33.200]  silver is our mightiest germ fighter.
[21:33.200 --> 21:34.960]  It is virtually non-toxic
[21:34.960 --> 21:37.440]  and is emerging as a wonder of modern science.
[21:37.440 --> 21:40.480]  Supernatural silver is the number one choice of thousands

[21:59.120 --> 22:01.920]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[22:01.920 --> 22:03.920]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[22:03.920 --> 22:07.040]  and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[22:07.040 --> 22:10.000]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[22:10.000 --> 22:12.240]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[22:12.240 --> 22:15.200]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[22:15.200 --> 22:16.640]  Deciding to take action,
[22:16.640 --> 22:19.680]  a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[22:19.680 --> 22:22.240]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan
[22:22.240 --> 22:23.680]  or accepted outside funding.
[22:23.680 --> 22:26.400]  They now operate two distribution facilities
[22:26.400 --> 22:29.600]  and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women.
[22:29.600 --> 22:32.800]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[22:32.800 --> 22:35.040]  And that's why I stock MyPantry
[22:35.040 --> 22:38.160]  with high quality storeable foods for MyPatriot Supply.

[23:56.160 --> 24:23.520]  That's uncnow.com.
[24:23.520 --> 24:25.360]  All right, your phone calls are coming up in the next segment.
[24:25.360 --> 24:27.120]  Have you just joined us on your host Alex Jones?
[24:28.320 --> 24:32.880]  Here is an article out of the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine
[24:32.880 --> 24:36.560]  mandatory school vaccinations, The Role of Tort Law.
[24:37.520 --> 24:39.040]  And it goes on to say,
[24:39.040 --> 24:42.080]  since it is unlikely that state governments will eliminate
[24:42.080 --> 24:44.000]  such exemptions outright,
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.600]  society must consider other methods of providing incentives
[24:47.600 --> 24:52.480]  for vaccination and compensating those who have suffered due to the disease
[24:52.480 --> 24:56.720]  outbreak caused by a community loss of herd immunity.
[24:58.400 --> 25:04.080]  You know, I love how they claim that they've lost herd immunity
[25:05.360 --> 25:08.320]  because everyone's not taking the vaccine.
[25:08.320 --> 25:11.760]  I thought the vaccine was protecting you.
[25:11.760 --> 25:14.960]  So how, if I don't take it, do you get sick?
[25:17.040 --> 25:18.960]  In fact, last few days,
[25:18.960 --> 25:23.440]  I saw multiple mainstream news articles on infowars.com
[25:23.440 --> 25:26.160]  linking to studies, we'll pull some of these up,
[25:26.160 --> 25:29.840]  but you can pull them up, where the people that get the measles,
[25:29.840 --> 25:31.920]  mumps, and rubella are the ones that take the shot.
[25:32.720 --> 25:35.520]  The people that are getting the whooping cough in California
[25:35.520 --> 25:36.640]  are the ones that take the shot.
[25:38.800 --> 25:39.280]  There it is.
[25:39.280 --> 25:43.280]  90% of those infected with measles in New York outbreak are vaccinated.
[25:44.080 --> 25:45.040]  And if you link through,
[25:45.040 --> 25:47.440]  they have links in the bottom of the article, local news.
[25:47.440 --> 25:52.160]  This is the type of stuff we're dealing with.
[25:52.160 --> 25:57.280]  And again, I'm not saying that learned immunity,
[25:59.520 --> 26:05.680]  that inoculations can't actually work.
[26:06.560 --> 26:10.400]  It's that you cannot trust a eugenics-based global government
[26:10.400 --> 26:12.880]  that's obsessed with secret experimentation
[26:12.880 --> 26:15.760]  and who's been caught adding everything you could imagine
[26:15.760 --> 26:17.840]  under the sun to mainline vaccines.
[26:17.840 --> 26:20.080]  And you see disease levels actually going up
[26:20.720 --> 26:23.120]  in places like Africa and Asia,
[26:23.120 --> 26:25.680]  where they give them, say, the polio vaccine.
[26:25.680 --> 26:28.160]  And they don't call it polio when they get paralyzed,
[26:28.160 --> 26:30.160]  60-something thousand at a pop in India,
[26:31.200 --> 26:32.960]  but they admit it's caused by the vaccine.
[26:32.960 --> 26:34.560]  I mean, this is scandalous.
[26:35.600 --> 26:37.600]  Our whole way of life is being ended
[26:37.600 --> 26:39.040]  because of the hoax of terrorism.
[26:39.040 --> 26:41.600]  Whether you believe it's real or orchestrated,
[26:41.600 --> 26:42.240]  it doesn't matter.
[26:43.520 --> 26:45.440]  You've got a better chance of deer jumping out in front
[26:45.440 --> 26:47.600]  of your car and killing you than being killed by a terrorist.
[26:47.600 --> 26:50.960]  So how is our whole world, our whole way of life being changed,
[26:50.960 --> 26:52.480]  our whole Bill of Rights Constitution,
[26:52.480 --> 26:54.080]  checks and balances being erased,
[26:54.080 --> 26:55.840]  in the name of protecting us
[26:55.840 --> 26:58.640]  with a kleptocratic militarized government,
[26:59.200 --> 27:02.880]  lecturing us how our liberty is to blame for our problems.
[27:02.880 --> 27:05.600]  No, our liberty was to blame for our prosperity.
[27:06.400 --> 27:07.600]  And we became decadent,
[27:08.160 --> 27:10.080]  and now we've been overrun by criminals
[27:10.080 --> 27:12.800]  and social engineers who've got a lot of people
[27:12.800 --> 27:15.360]  in the mid and lower levels that are very good people,
[27:16.960 --> 27:20.320]  who are very good people, who actually mean well.
[27:20.320 --> 27:23.440]  And that's the only reason we've been able to hold back
[27:23.440 --> 27:25.200]  a lot of this new world order
[27:25.200 --> 27:26.960]  is because we've been fighting it.
[27:26.960 --> 27:29.280]  We've been on the front lines warning people.
[27:29.280 --> 27:30.480]  So that's the good news.
[27:30.480 --> 27:34.000]  Folks are waking up to what I call planet hoax.
[27:34.000 --> 27:36.640]  That was the issue of the magazine
[27:36.640 --> 27:45.120]  that came out last month or came out last year.
[27:45.120 --> 27:48.240]  Last April's edition, 2013,
[27:48.240 --> 27:50.000]  was Welcome to Planet Hoax.
[27:50.000 --> 27:51.680]  I can't believe how fast time's moving.
[27:51.680 --> 27:53.120]  Some of this magazine just came out.
[27:54.160 --> 27:55.360]  And in this magazine,
[27:55.360 --> 27:57.840]  we expose a bunch of hoaxes and a bunch of lies.
[27:57.840 --> 27:59.360]  So again, I want to hear from you.
[27:59.360 --> 28:00.560]  What do you see as a hoax?
[28:01.120 --> 28:03.440]  Is there anything the government and big corporations
[28:03.440 --> 28:04.800]  aren't putting out that isn't a hoax?
[28:04.800 --> 28:08.640]  Is there anything they don't push that isn't a fraud?
[28:08.640 --> 28:11.760]  I mean, what about the hoax of Warren Buffett
[28:11.760 --> 28:13.680]  as a figurehead or the head of General Electric
[28:13.680 --> 28:15.120]  as a figurehead, but they all do it?
[28:15.760 --> 28:18.800]  The entire Fortune 100 to a man,
[28:20.000 --> 28:21.600]  except for maybe the Koch brothers.
[28:21.600 --> 28:22.960]  And that's why they're so demonized.
[28:22.960 --> 28:24.800]  And I'm not romanticizing them.
[28:24.800 --> 28:26.240]  They funded Bill Clinton.
[28:26.240 --> 28:29.440]  But the Koch brothers do not try to lobby
[28:29.440 --> 28:31.280]  for higher taxes on poor people.
[28:31.280 --> 28:32.640]  And that's their ultimate sin.
[28:32.640 --> 28:34.480]  That's why they're the cause celeb to attack.
[28:34.480 --> 28:37.280]  And hate, and they're the only elite so-called liberals
[28:37.280 --> 28:38.320]  know the name of.
[28:38.320 --> 28:41.600]  When they're mid-level at most, a private family,
[28:41.600 --> 28:43.840]  with, I don't know, $15 billion or something.
[28:43.840 --> 28:44.640]  Sounds like a lot.
[28:44.640 --> 28:47.840]  Bill and Melinda Gates have put $100 billion tax-free
[28:47.840 --> 28:50.240]  into their governmental institutions that they control
[28:50.240 --> 28:52.240]  to take over society and get corporate welfare.
[28:52.960 --> 28:54.800]  Bill and Melinda Gates are all tax-free folks.
[28:54.800 --> 28:56.080]  They're not giving the money.
[28:56.080 --> 28:57.440]  They're making their money tax-free.
[28:57.440 --> 29:00.080]  But continuing, talk about a big hoax.
[29:00.080 --> 29:02.480]  Warren Buffett is the biggest recipient
[29:02.480 --> 29:05.120]  of the trillions and trillions in banker bailout
[29:05.840 --> 29:06.880]  since 2008.
[29:06.880 --> 29:08.400]  And he's the number one pusher.
[29:09.040 --> 29:10.560]  Every time I turn television on,
[29:11.360 --> 29:13.120]  the rich people don't pay taxes.
[29:13.840 --> 29:16.080]  While I look at all these colleagues of mine,
[29:16.080 --> 29:17.120]  they're tax-exempt.
[29:17.680 --> 29:20.720]  While my secretary pays more, I want to pay more.
[29:21.600 --> 29:23.760]  He just wants to raise taxes on the middle class
[29:23.760 --> 29:26.640]  to eradicate you, to transfer your money to him.
[29:26.640 --> 29:28.720]  While he runs Dairy Queen to poison poor people
[29:28.720 --> 29:29.520]  on the countryside.
[29:29.520 --> 29:34.000]  Or is fast food on the planet?
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.400]  While his Wells Fargo is one of the biggest money laundering
[29:36.400 --> 29:38.720]  banks in the world on record and above the law
[29:38.720 --> 29:39.600]  and doesn't get in trouble.
[29:39.600 --> 29:40.240]  But it's OK.
[29:40.240 --> 29:41.360]  He's a nice old man.
[29:41.920 --> 29:44.720]  Buffett, champion of bailout, is also leading beneficiary.
[29:44.720 --> 29:45.680]  McClatchy.
[29:45.680 --> 29:47.200]  We're going to come back with more hoaxes.
[29:47.200 --> 30:00.000]  The ladies on Obamacare, your calls.
[30:18.080 --> 30:19.200]  is feeding on.
[30:19.200 --> 30:21.200]  We may not have been able to get fluoride
[30:21.200 --> 30:22.640]  out of the water supply yet,
[30:22.640 --> 30:24.880]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies.
[30:24.880 --> 30:26.880]  I am extremely excited to announce
[30:26.880 --> 30:30.480]  the exclusive InfoWars line fluoride shield formulation.
[30:30.480 --> 30:33.600]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients

[30:36.400 --> 30:38.800]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body,
[30:38.800 --> 30:41.200]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[30:41.200 --> 30:43.200]  Let's take a stand against the globalist
[30:43.200 --> 30:45.680]  by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.

[30:57.920 --> 31:00.080]  That's infowarslife.com.
[31:00.080 --> 31:01.920]  The globalist social engineers are not just
[31:01.920 --> 31:03.520]  targeting us with propaganda.
[31:03.520 --> 31:05.920]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[31:05.920 --> 31:08.800]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen
[31:08.800 --> 31:11.040]  mimicers that lower our testosterone
[31:11.040 --> 31:13.200]  and other hormones and natural compounds
[31:13.200 --> 31:14.480]  that the body needs.

[33:23.280 --> 33:33.280]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center
[33:33.280 --> 33:35.040]  in the heart of the resistance.
[33:35.040 --> 33:35.520]  Thank God.
[33:35.520 --> 33:37.280]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[33:37.280 --> 34:06.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this April 1st, 2014 global transmission.
[34:06.240 --> 34:07.920]  Your phone calls are coming up in a few minutes.
[34:09.040 --> 34:11.920]  I start talking about hoaxes by the establishment.
[34:11.920 --> 34:14.560]  That's why they want to teach you 2 plus 2 equals 5
[34:15.200 --> 34:16.800]  in public schools nationwide.
[34:18.240 --> 34:21.040]  Or that a brown bag is racist.
[34:22.160 --> 34:25.280]  Because the globalists are discriminating against all of us
[34:25.280 --> 34:28.320]  signing us on to 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives
[34:28.320 --> 34:32.160]  that they created as a fraud to bankrupt civilization
[34:32.160 --> 34:33.520]  and sign it over to themselves.
[34:33.520 --> 34:35.760]  That's a giant hoax.
[34:37.760 --> 34:41.200]  But if you know how to say 2 plus 2 equals 4, that is freedom.
[34:41.760 --> 34:44.960]  And I'm quoting Eric Blair, aka George Arwell.
[34:45.520 --> 34:49.760]  Like we pull up the actual quote from 1984 to type in 1984 quote,
[34:49.760 --> 34:52.160]  freedom is the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[34:53.200 --> 34:56.560]  And he goes on to say because if you can do that, if you can reason
[34:57.360 --> 35:01.520]  and if your mind allows you to know that
[35:01.520 --> 35:05.920]  when BB, Big Brother, is telling you otherwise, you're free.
[35:06.560 --> 35:08.720]  And of course, O'Brien tortures him for a few months
[35:08.720 --> 35:12.800]  and to the point of Winston can no longer tell 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[35:13.520 --> 35:16.560]  It's like going to an Obama supporter and saying,
[35:16.560 --> 35:18.880]  you know, the Republican leadership with the Democrats
[35:18.880 --> 35:22.240]  wrote this for foreign insurance companies owned by big banks
[35:22.240 --> 35:25.600]  as a foreign direct tax, just like third world countries
[35:25.600 --> 35:27.760]  have to pay money to the IMF and World Bank.
[35:27.760 --> 35:32.240]  This is a direct siphon to them to get 100 trillion in new liquidity
[35:32.240 --> 35:36.560]  off of healthcare taxes and off of wellhead taxes,
[35:36.560 --> 35:38.960]  money transfer taxes, and carbon taxes.
[35:38.960 --> 35:40.640]  Here is the Devoe, Switzerland plan.
[35:42.960 --> 35:45.280]  And they just look at you and say, shut up racist,
[35:45.280 --> 35:48.320]  because it's much easier to say 2 plus 2 equals 5.
[35:52.080 --> 35:54.880]  And I didn't know that Victor Hugo began to talk about
[35:54.880 --> 35:56.560]  2 plus 2 equals 4 is freedom.
[35:56.560 --> 35:58.800]  And then Orwell was quoting and we print me that whole page.
[35:58.800 --> 36:00.320]  I didn't know there's an entire Wikipedia page
[36:00.320 --> 36:01.920]  about 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[36:02.800 --> 36:05.600]  I didn't even realize this is like, so what do they do?
[36:05.600 --> 36:07.200]  The sickest joke in the world.
[36:07.200 --> 36:11.600]  If they can make you sit there and have your children taught 2 plus 2 equals 5,
[36:11.600 --> 36:14.560]  which is official curriculum from she to shining C.
[36:18.080 --> 36:21.280]  From C to shining C.
[36:21.280 --> 36:26.480]  2 plus 2 equals 5.
[36:26.480 --> 36:30.800]  And this is the insanity we face.
[36:34.800 --> 36:37.520]  Yeah, you guys just print me the quote from 1984.
[36:37.520 --> 36:43.360]  2 plus 2, the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4 is freedom.
[36:43.360 --> 36:43.760]  There it is.
[36:43.760 --> 36:52.640]  All right, continuing folks here with the news.
[36:53.680 --> 36:55.120]  We're looking at hoaxes.
[36:57.360 --> 36:59.280]  We're looking at how do you battle a hoax?
[37:00.240 --> 37:03.120]  What are the big hoaxes and what's your take on Obamacare?
[37:03.120 --> 37:04.880]  And then I've got a bunch of other news as well.
[37:04.880 --> 37:07.200]  And Dick Gregory, the civil rights activist,
[37:07.200 --> 37:07.840]  is going to be joining us.
[37:07.840 --> 37:11.440]  Talk about the entire waterfront in the third hour.
[37:11.440 --> 37:19.680]  Continuing with the entire Obamacare situation,
[37:20.720 --> 37:25.840]  that is now expanding across the country to everyone's harm.
[37:27.040 --> 37:33.600]  And of course, today was the supposed deadline for folks to be able to do that.
[37:35.920 --> 37:40.240]  This story is up on infowars.com and was also carried by drudgereport.com.
[37:40.240 --> 37:43.280]  And I'm going to play a clip of it in just a moment.
[37:44.320 --> 37:49.360]  Cops to inspect homes without notice for illegal rentals.
[37:49.920 --> 37:51.520]  And the way this is pushed is, well,
[37:51.520 --> 37:54.240]  it's to stop illegal aliens that are renting illegally.
[37:54.240 --> 37:57.520]  No, ladies and gentlemen, it is to go into your house without a warrant.
[37:58.320 --> 38:00.800]  And there are people, a minority of them in the comments section,
[38:00.800 --> 38:02.880]  defending this as a way to stop crime.
[38:02.880 --> 38:06.640]  Well, you don't just go in someone's house looking for illegal drugs without a warrant.
[38:06.640 --> 38:11.040]  With a oath or affirmation, with a particular person placed and things to be searched,
[38:11.040 --> 38:18.160]  the reason you're doing it, and that you get to face an accuser, that is the whole issue.
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.160]  And they will find any excuse to do this.
[38:24.160 --> 38:26.000]  Government wants in your house.
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.480]  You don't just randomly show up at the government and say,
[38:28.480 --> 38:31.280]  I'm going to go behind the counter and they'll see what's going on in your offices.
[38:31.280 --> 38:32.000]  They'd shoot you.
[38:32.960 --> 38:35.600]  But when they want to show up and come look in your house,
[38:35.600 --> 38:37.840]  well, they've got an excuse to do it.
[38:38.800 --> 38:42.960]  Zero tolerance programs slammed as attack on property rights, really?
[38:44.160 --> 38:47.040]  Authorities in Long Island, not public servants,
[38:47.040 --> 38:51.840]  have launched a crackdown on homeowners who rent their houses out to tenants
[38:51.840 --> 38:54.480]  who have not been registered under a zero tolerance program
[38:54.480 --> 38:57.200]  that will see police conduct home inspections without notice.
[38:57.200 --> 38:59.600]  Yeah, they passed the law a few years ago in Austin.
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.360]  The hotels got it passed trying to ban people on Craigslist,
[39:03.360 --> 39:08.320]  renting out their apartments or homes for ACL
[39:08.320 --> 39:11.840]  or for South by Southwest or other popular events in Austin.
[39:12.560 --> 39:14.240]  And I've never rented my places out,
[39:14.240 --> 39:18.640]  but I'm tempted to do it just all the places I've lived.
[39:18.640 --> 39:20.320]  I've never rented anything out,
[39:20.320 --> 39:24.160]  but I probably should just to thumb my nose at the establishment.
[39:24.800 --> 39:27.120]  I mean, it's not enough we pay property taxes on it,
[39:27.120 --> 39:30.400]  that's feudalism and this country didn't have until the last 60, 70 years,
[39:30.400 --> 39:33.280]  where your properties, not even your property,
[39:33.280 --> 39:36.960]  now all over the country, not just in New York,
[39:36.960 --> 39:38.240]  but all over the place.
[39:38.240 --> 39:40.560]  The police are showing up without warrants
[39:41.680 --> 39:43.920]  and saying, open up, we're going to see who lives here.
[39:43.920 --> 39:47.280]  First time I saw this was in an Illinois town, I forget where.
[39:47.280 --> 39:48.960]  Lester sent us a local newspaper.
[39:50.080 --> 39:53.040]  It was a sorry about Chicago, this is about 15 years ago,
[39:53.040 --> 39:54.400]  and it described the police.
[39:55.200 --> 39:57.280]  You know, the Johnsons woke up at 5 a.m.
[39:57.280 --> 39:59.680]  to have the code enforcement police standing over their bed,
[39:59.680 --> 40:00.960]  telling them to stay in bed,
[40:00.960 --> 40:02.960]  shining a flashlight in their eyes without a warrant,
[40:02.960 --> 40:04.480]  and counting their toothbrushes.
[40:05.520 --> 40:08.240]  The house was only authorized to have two in it,
[40:08.240 --> 40:09.760]  under property taxes,
[40:09.760 --> 40:12.240]  but they might have given the Johnsons a fine
[40:12.240 --> 40:13.840]  if they had three toothbrushes.
[40:13.840 --> 40:14.880]  Luckily, they didn't,
[40:14.880 --> 40:17.360]  and they were just reporting it like it was totally normal.
[40:18.080 --> 40:20.400]  Imagine you wake up and shining a flashlight in your face
[40:20.400 --> 40:24.000]  without warrants, uniformed code police.
[40:24.000 --> 40:25.440]  I mean, that's a good 21.
[40:25.440 --> 40:28.880]  That's where this whole thing is going.
[40:29.840 --> 40:31.920]  So let's go ahead and play a clip of that.
[40:32.800 --> 40:37.920]  I pay $9,000 a year taxes, and I don't think it's fair.
[40:37.920 --> 40:41.040]  Perry Esposito says the problem of illegal housing
[40:41.040 --> 40:43.600]  is getting worse in his Westbury neighborhood.
[40:43.600 --> 40:47.120]  He says at least two nearby homes have illegal tenants.
[40:47.120 --> 40:52.000]  Someone was living in the garage, no plumbing, no proper heating.
[40:52.000 --> 40:56.720]  They were paying part of that person's mortgage and taxes.
[40:56.720 --> 40:59.440]  After multiple complaints from residents like Perry,
[40:59.440 --> 41:01.040]  the village is cracking down
[41:01.040 --> 41:04.560]  with what it calls a new housing enforcement program.
[41:04.560 --> 41:07.040]  The village says there will be zero tolerance
[41:07.040 --> 41:08.400]  for those breaking the law.
[41:08.400 --> 41:09.520]  Among the changes,
[41:09.520 --> 41:12.240]  the village will create a housing enforcement unit
[41:12.240 --> 41:14.240]  and hire two new officers.
[41:14.240 --> 41:17.040]  It'll conduct inspections without notice
[41:17.040 --> 41:19.600]  and increase housing violation fines.
[41:19.600 --> 41:22.960]  It will also raise fees and toughen maintenance rules
[41:22.960 --> 41:25.680]  for homes owned by absentee landlords.
[41:25.680 --> 41:28.080]  It's not targeted to any people in particular.
[41:28.080 --> 41:29.600]  It's just targeted to a situation,
[41:29.600 --> 41:31.760]  which is landlords who are making money
[41:31.760 --> 41:34.320]  by victimizing people in the community
[41:34.320 --> 41:36.080]  and by victimizing the community as a whole.
[41:36.080 --> 41:40.080]  This is about trying to find habitable housing for people
[41:40.080 --> 41:44.080]  so that they can live legally and respect property rights.
[41:44.080 --> 41:47.280]  In the coming days, residents will be receiving these fires
[41:47.280 --> 41:49.920]  from the village informing them about the specifics
[41:49.920 --> 41:52.080]  with this new housing enforcement program.
[41:52.080 --> 41:53.840]  All right. Perry is hopeful.
[41:53.840 --> 41:55.280]  Now, again, people can say,
[41:55.280 --> 41:57.280]  hey, this is the way to keep the neighborhood nice.
[41:57.280 --> 42:00.080]  This is how you end up being Nazi Germany.
[42:00.080 --> 42:02.240]  You leave the borders wide open.
[42:02.240 --> 42:05.040]  You got Detroit and a bunch of other cities collapsing.
[42:05.040 --> 42:07.040]  People can barely pay their bills.
[42:07.040 --> 42:09.200]  And now you're going to have snappens, quote,
[42:09.200 --> 42:11.440]  inspections without warrants
[42:11.440 --> 42:13.840]  where they're going to come in your house.
[42:13.840 --> 42:17.200]  And I know Austin has now put the code enforcers in there.
[42:17.200 --> 42:20.080]  He's in uniforms and is arming some of them
[42:20.080 --> 42:21.440]  and are talking about this.
[42:21.440 --> 42:23.920]  And I've just had enough, okay?
[42:23.920 --> 42:25.840]  And that's why they're expanding most police forces
[42:25.840 --> 42:28.000]  into quasi SWAT teams
[42:28.000 --> 42:29.680]  because this is just what they're going to do.
[42:29.680 --> 42:31.040]  It's routine now,
[42:31.040 --> 42:32.960]  where they just have you line up against the wall,
[42:32.960 --> 42:35.360]  search all your papers, persons and effects.
[42:35.360 --> 42:36.320]  If you give them any problem,
[42:36.320 --> 42:38.320]  they'll just fill you full of holes.
[42:38.320 --> 42:42.320]  All of America is being turned into a giant prison.
[42:42.320 --> 42:43.280]  And I guarantee you,
[42:43.280 --> 42:44.960]  this is all going to be selectively enforced.
[42:44.960 --> 42:48.480]  And I don't care if you get some two or three slobs
[42:48.480 --> 42:50.720]  in their city council complaining about their neighbor
[42:50.720 --> 42:52.720]  having too many people living in their house.
[42:54.720 --> 42:56.080]  Because you do that now,
[42:56.080 --> 42:57.040]  there's no Bill of Rights,
[42:57.040 --> 42:58.080]  there's no Fourth Amendment,
[42:58.080 --> 42:59.280]  because someone complains.
[43:01.840 --> 43:04.320]  Again, I bet those same people that I looked at
[43:05.920 --> 43:08.080]  on the video are big Obama supporters
[43:08.080 --> 43:09.600]  and I bet they're for open borders.
[43:10.800 --> 43:11.280]  There it is.
[43:11.280 --> 43:13.120]  They just pulled up an article about Austin.
[43:13.120 --> 43:16.320]  Code compliance tracks down on short-term rentals.
[43:16.320 --> 43:18.320]  Austin, Texas, same deal.
[43:19.520 --> 43:23.120]  And this is all about don't rent your house out during ACL
[43:23.120 --> 43:24.560]  or during any other big event
[43:24.560 --> 43:27.200]  because the hotels went and lobbied to have that done.
[43:27.200 --> 43:29.680]  And it's all going to be selectively enforced.
[43:30.240 --> 43:32.240]  It'll probably end up being the different county commissioners
[43:32.240 --> 43:33.840]  and city people that have the, you know,
[43:33.840 --> 43:35.920]  15 illegals living in the apartment.
[43:35.920 --> 43:37.520]  By the way, I know a lady who manages
[43:37.520 --> 43:40.960]  the biggest department complex group in Austin
[43:40.960 --> 43:42.480]  and she works for one of the biggest companies
[43:42.480 --> 43:43.120]  in the country.
[43:44.720 --> 43:46.240]  And I've told this story many times
[43:46.240 --> 43:47.280]  and we're going to go to your phone calls.
[43:48.560 --> 43:49.920]  They were called in in Dallas
[43:49.920 --> 43:52.960]  where the big apartment places is based.
[43:52.960 --> 43:54.240]  People that know about apartment management
[43:54.240 --> 43:55.360]  will know the company and talk about it.
[43:55.360 --> 43:58.400]  It's probably the biggest based out of Dallas in the country.
[43:58.400 --> 44:00.080]  And she went with all the managers,
[44:00.080 --> 44:01.520]  it was a couple hundred of them,
[44:01.520 --> 44:04.960]  in this ballroom from all over the country.
[44:05.920 --> 44:07.040]  And they were told,
[44:07.040 --> 44:09.200]  listen, we got to deal with the federal government
[44:09.200 --> 44:10.480]  and the Justice Department.
[44:10.480 --> 44:13.520]  We have secretly become 501C, whatever it was,
[44:14.320 --> 44:15.440]  a tax exempt.
[44:15.440 --> 44:17.360]  We want to kick citizens out
[44:17.360 --> 44:19.120]  and we want to rent to illegals
[44:19.120 --> 44:21.840]  and let them have unlimited, unlimited.
[44:22.720 --> 44:25.360]  And this is part of our deal to get the tax exemption.
[44:25.360 --> 44:26.240]  It's a secret deal.
[44:26.880 --> 44:28.400]  You are to throw citizens out.
[44:28.400 --> 44:30.000]  Black, white, Hispanic, we don't care.
[44:30.560 --> 44:31.440]  Asian doesn't matter.
[44:32.560 --> 44:33.920]  If they have their grandmother visiting
[44:33.920 --> 44:35.040]  for three days, throw them out.
[44:35.680 --> 44:36.400]  We are going to,
[44:36.400 --> 44:38.080]  and these were nice apartments in Austin.
[44:38.080 --> 44:39.520]  They're now literally have chickens
[44:39.520 --> 44:40.960]  running around in the yards.
[44:40.960 --> 44:45.200]  And they did this and covertly went to being
[44:45.200 --> 44:47.680]  government housing for illegals.
[44:47.680 --> 44:49.200]  That was actually an associated press
[44:50.000 --> 44:51.120]  about eight, nine years ago.
[44:51.760 --> 44:52.640]  It was a headline.
[44:52.640 --> 44:53.920]  I'm going to think of the exact headline.
[44:54.720 --> 44:58.160]  Bankers give immigrants helping hand with housing loans.
[44:59.440 --> 45:02.000]  And it had the Bank of America housing loan heads.
[45:02.000 --> 45:03.840]  I remember this because I read the article on air
[45:03.840 --> 45:05.200]  probably 15 times or more.
[45:05.760 --> 45:08.080]  He said, oh yeah, citizens have got to have
[45:08.080 --> 45:09.680]  good credit and all their IDs.
[45:09.680 --> 45:11.840]  But immigrants, especially from Mexico,
[45:11.840 --> 45:13.440]  we want to give them a helping hand.
[45:13.440 --> 45:15.120]  We're just going to give them the housing loan.
[45:17.760 --> 45:18.480]  Why is that?
[45:18.480 --> 45:21.200]  To bring in groups that'll politically vote
[45:21.200 --> 45:24.480]  to take the guns, politically vote for socialism,
[45:24.480 --> 45:25.920]  because they're taught in Mexico.
[45:25.920 --> 45:28.160]  That's how you fight the establishment
[45:28.160 --> 45:29.200]  has become socialist.
[45:29.200 --> 45:30.880]  That's the only form of revolution down there.
[45:32.000 --> 45:34.000]  There it is, banks open doors to new customers,
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.480]  illegal immigrants, associated press.
[45:36.480 --> 45:37.680]  That was Wall Street Journal.
[45:37.680 --> 45:41.200]  You were actually able to find that print that for me, brother.
[45:41.920 --> 45:43.360]  What year is that from?
[45:43.360 --> 45:44.240]  2005.
[45:44.240 --> 45:45.840]  You actually found it, Jordan.
[45:45.840 --> 45:47.280]  I remember finding that in years.
[45:47.280 --> 45:48.160]  Print that for me.
[45:48.160 --> 45:49.280]  Unbelievable. Good job.
[45:49.280 --> 45:54.480]  Anyways, and I learned about this at Bank of America.
[45:55.440 --> 45:57.440]  As soon as this lady retires,
[45:57.440 --> 45:58.800]  and she's very close to retiring,
[45:58.800 --> 45:59.840]  she's an old family friend.
[45:59.840 --> 46:01.120]  She listens to the show every day.
[46:01.840 --> 46:03.200]  I'm going to get her in here,
[46:03.200 --> 46:04.960]  and she will tell you the stories.
[46:04.960 --> 46:06.960]  If they don't get the Social Security Number
[46:06.960 --> 46:09.040]  exactly right by accident in a form,
[46:09.040 --> 46:11.440]  Homeland Security shows up and threatens to arrest everyone.
[46:11.440 --> 46:12.960]  I mean, they have it all computerized.
[46:12.960 --> 46:18.080]  Illegal aliens, folks, can butcher goats in their bathrooms,
[46:18.080 --> 46:19.680]  and they're told you leave them alone.
[46:20.880 --> 46:23.520]  And again, I don't dislike the illegals, folks.
[46:23.520 --> 46:26.720]  Western culture in the U.S. is pretty much Spanish.
[46:26.720 --> 46:30.400]  Cowboy hats, the food, the holes, shoot them up deal.
[46:30.400 --> 46:34.400]  I mean, this is part of the history of the United States.
[46:34.400 --> 46:36.320]  This is part of the Southwestern culture.
[46:36.320 --> 46:39.680]  It's that they've imposed a globalist culture over it.
[46:39.680 --> 46:42.160]  I mean, here's an article on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[46:42.880 --> 46:47.120]  Study. Six to one liberal bias in Hispanic TV news.
[46:47.120 --> 46:48.080]  It's not liberal.
[46:48.640 --> 46:52.080]  It's take my guns, take my kids, vaccines of the law,
[46:52.080 --> 46:54.720]  government's God, freedom is bad.
[46:54.720 --> 46:55.600]  I'm sick of it.
[46:56.400 --> 47:00.800]  That's a major study that's out that Politico is reporting on.
[47:00.800 --> 47:02.880]  Univision, Telemundo, SKU liberal.
[47:02.880 --> 47:04.880]  The main U.S.-Spanish language news program,
[47:04.880 --> 47:07.920]  SKU liberal on domestic issues and spent most of their time
[47:07.920 --> 47:10.480]  in the past few months covering the new health care law,
[47:10.480 --> 47:14.320]  saying how great it was. Immigration reform, blah, blah, blah.
[47:18.880 --> 47:22.160]  And so that's the type of garbage that we're looking at here.
[47:22.720 --> 47:24.320]  And I'm sick of it.
[47:25.600 --> 47:26.720]  I'm sick of it.
[47:26.720 --> 47:29.920]  And it's total discrimination because the globalist folks
[47:29.920 --> 47:34.240]  want a red carpet for illegals, red carpet.
[47:34.240 --> 47:40.080]  See, when I see a story about all the people living in houses
[47:40.080 --> 47:41.840]  and people renting houses out folks,
[47:41.840 --> 47:47.120]  this country was built on somebody buying a big colonial style
[47:47.120 --> 47:53.520]  two-story house with big porches all around the top.
[47:53.520 --> 47:58.080]  And daddy goes out and works to have a steady paycheck
[47:58.080 --> 48:02.320]  at the factory and mama takes care of the kids, cleans the house
[48:02.320 --> 48:07.120]  and cooks food for the seven guys that live and the old lady
[48:07.120 --> 48:12.640]  that live upstairs or live downstairs and it's a boarding house.
[48:12.640 --> 48:14.640]  And that's how America operated.
[48:14.640 --> 48:17.120]  Everybody didn't always just have, you know,
[48:17.120 --> 48:19.920]  a two-story house and three cars and go on all these vacations.
[48:19.920 --> 48:21.600]  Everybody just didn't have all this money.
[48:21.600 --> 48:28.080]  And that's how most Americans made it, was they got a room somewhere.
[48:28.080 --> 48:29.920]  And from what I've read and people I've talked to
[48:29.920 --> 48:31.840]  and traveling salesmen and folks I know,
[48:31.840 --> 48:33.680]  talking to old great uncles before they died,
[48:33.680 --> 48:36.080]  they travel the country and stay at boarding houses.
[48:36.080 --> 48:38.160]  And it'd be fun, you cook dinner down there
[48:38.160 --> 48:41.040]  and nice people and play poker or cards after dinner
[48:41.040 --> 48:43.040]  and smoke a pipe out on the porch.
[48:43.040 --> 48:45.200]  That's what America's all about, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:45.200 --> 48:48.160]  And they take that and they make that dirty and bad
[48:48.160 --> 48:50.800]  and I will assure you the people in America
[48:50.800 --> 48:53.200]  will be like, well, we got to stop the illegals.
[48:53.200 --> 48:56.320]  The illegals are above the law with drinking and driving
[48:56.320 --> 48:58.960]  and with everything else until this country goes belly up,
[48:58.960 --> 49:00.160]  then they're not going to be above the law.
[49:00.160 --> 49:01.360]  I said, I'd go to your calls.
[49:01.360 --> 49:02.800]  We will go to your calls in the next segment
[49:02.800 --> 49:03.680]  throughout the next hour.
[49:04.800 --> 49:07.200]  It's just that, see, I see one article
[49:08.160 --> 49:09.600]  about the Fourth Amendment being gutted.
[49:09.600 --> 49:11.760]  It's happening all over the country under Gen 21.
[49:11.760 --> 49:13.680]  And they sell it like, we're going to clean the town up.
[49:13.680 --> 49:15.120]  No, they're getting rid of property rights
[49:15.120 --> 49:17.040]  in the Fourth Amendment and it's a nightmare.
[49:17.040 --> 49:18.480]  And the illegals are above the law
[49:18.480 --> 49:20.720]  and they get to have housing loans when you don't.
[49:21.920 --> 49:23.200]  Now that's discriminatory.
[49:23.760 --> 49:26.080]  And it's because the Ford Foundation finances
[49:26.080 --> 49:27.840]  and controls Spanish-run media.
[49:27.840 --> 49:30.960]  Biggest owner of TV stations for Spanish in the country
[49:30.960 --> 49:32.080]  isn't even Hispanic.
[49:33.680 --> 49:35.760]  And what does he run billboards in LA?
[49:35.760 --> 49:38.160]  Saying California is now Mexico.
[49:38.160 --> 49:39.520]  Basically, gringos get out.
[49:39.520 --> 49:40.480]  We've covered that article.
[49:41.280 --> 49:42.640]  Take the American flags down.
[49:42.640 --> 49:43.760]  Gringos are bad.
[49:43.760 --> 49:45.760]  The last thing they want is Hispanics,
[49:45.760 --> 49:46.880]  whites and everybody getting along,
[49:46.880 --> 49:48.560]  which is really happening.
[49:48.560 --> 49:51.040]  This is race-based garbage, folks,
[49:51.040 --> 49:52.320]  and we can't put up with it anymore.
[49:52.320 --> 49:53.360]  We're going to come back and go to
[49:54.480 --> 49:58.800]  Noble Patriot Pete, Justin Rage, Josh, and others.
[49:59.920 --> 50:01.840]  Briefly, the new magazine.
[50:01.840 --> 50:03.840]  Last month, we did the War Against Men
[50:03.840 --> 50:05.200]  with John Wayne on the cover.
[50:06.000 --> 50:09.280]  This month, we have Justin Bieber.
[50:09.280 --> 50:10.400]  No, that's not Justin Bieber.
[50:11.520 --> 50:13.040]  What's that idiot's name?
[50:13.040 --> 50:13.840]  Hannah Montana.
[50:13.840 --> 50:17.120]  Hannah, what's her name now?
[50:17.120 --> 50:19.680]  Miley Cyrus merged with Marilyn Monroe,
[50:19.680 --> 50:21.840]  and it's the War on Women,
[50:21.840 --> 50:23.040]  explaining how they're putting chemicals,
[50:23.040 --> 50:25.440]  biologicals in your food, in your water,
[50:25.440 --> 50:28.000]  how they're manipulating you, what fake feminism is,
[50:28.000 --> 50:31.680]  how to truly empower women, aka Annie Oakley 2.0.
[50:31.680 --> 50:32.320]  It's all in there.
[50:32.320 --> 50:32.880]  Very proud of it.
[50:32.880 --> 50:34.800]  You can buy it in bulk at costs.
[50:34.800 --> 50:37.680]  Big 64-page, I'm sorry, it's 68-page.
[50:37.680 --> 50:40.880]  It keeps big, glossy, color magazine.
[50:40.880 --> 50:42.720]  Great way to wake up women in your area
[50:42.720 --> 50:43.760]  about how they're being hit.
[50:43.760 --> 50:46.720]  Give this to your local BrainWash now member today.

[50:58.160 --> 51:04.080]  Jessica Armand here, creator of My Magic Mud,
[51:04.080 --> 51:06.560]  the all-natural teeth whitener and strengthening remedy
[51:06.560 --> 51:09.040]  that's getting rave reviews from GCN listeners.
[51:09.040 --> 51:11.360]  Here's what Austin Dentist Dr. Griffin Cole
[51:11.360 --> 51:12.240]  has to say about it.
[51:12.240 --> 51:14.000]  I really love this Magic Mud product.
[51:14.000 --> 51:15.600]  Because charcoal is so absorbent,
[51:15.600 --> 51:18.240]  it's very effective at taking off all the sticky plaque
[51:18.240 --> 51:20.080]  and debris that gets stuck on our teeth every day.
[51:20.080 --> 51:21.680]  I highly recommend My Magic Mud.

[51:57.760 --> 52:26.960]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[52:27.760 --> 52:28.960]  It will reshape America.
[52:28.960 --> 52:30.800]  It will swipe trillions off markets
[52:30.800 --> 52:32.480]  and retirement accounts everywhere
[52:32.480 --> 52:33.920]  and destroy the way of life
[52:33.920 --> 52:36.240]  of millions of unprepared Americans.
[52:36.240 --> 52:38.000]  But it will also trigger what promises
[52:38.000 --> 52:39.840]  to be the biggest wealth transfer
[52:39.840 --> 52:41.600]  in the history of our nation.
[52:41.600 --> 52:43.440]  But you only have a few weeks left

[54:20.880 --> 54:22.720]  All right, we're going right to your phone calls.
[54:22.720 --> 54:25.200]  If you just joined us, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[54:25.200 --> 54:26.560]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[54:26.560 --> 54:27.600]  at 2 p.m. central.
[54:27.600 --> 54:29.280]  Back weeknight, 7 o'clock central,
[54:29.280 --> 54:32.960]  infowarsnews.com to find all the details there.
[54:32.960 --> 54:34.960]  The nightly news folks is very well produced,
[54:34.960 --> 54:36.960]  very focused, condensed 30 minutes.
[54:36.960 --> 54:38.320]  We're very proud of it.
[54:38.320 --> 54:39.680]  And Leanne walks with me this morning.
[54:39.680 --> 54:41.680]  I'm very, very honored that she remembered this.
[54:42.880 --> 54:45.280]  This is the one-year anniversary of her working here.
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.320]  And her and Jakari and David Knight
[54:48.320 --> 54:51.200]  and our other great reporters, John Bowne.
[54:51.200 --> 54:53.920]  And of course, folks like Darren McBreen
[54:53.920 --> 54:55.920]  and Paul Watson and just everyone here.
[54:55.920 --> 54:58.080]  Kurt Nemo, Don Salazar, everybody.
[54:58.080 --> 55:01.920]  The folks behind the scenes, like Marcos Morales,
[55:01.920 --> 55:03.920]  you'll never go to your calls for thinking all the crew.
[55:03.920 --> 55:05.920]  The entire crew do an incredible job,
[55:05.920 --> 55:08.320]  especially the radio slash TV crew.
[55:08.320 --> 55:11.120]  This is live, and then they're on their toes,
[55:12.400 --> 55:14.880]  on their toes for two hours before the show
[55:14.880 --> 55:16.320]  and three hours during it.
[55:16.320 --> 55:19.360]  But I want to talk about hoaxes.
[55:19.360 --> 55:22.720]  I want to talk about hoaxes, I mean, just the magnitude
[55:22.720 --> 55:26.880]  of the hoaxes that survive off the public's ignorance.
[55:27.520 --> 55:29.840]  And that's why the government teaches two plus two equals five.
[55:29.840 --> 55:32.240]  And I do have that 1984 quote, I'll read it
[55:33.040 --> 55:34.800]  at the start of the second segment next hour
[55:34.800 --> 55:36.000]  to re-kick off the topic.
[55:37.280 --> 55:38.400]  Are we planted hoaxes?
[55:38.400 --> 55:40.880]  How do you fight these hoaxes that are so huge,
[55:40.880 --> 55:43.200]  the lies that are so big, they're hard to even
[55:43.760 --> 55:45.440]  comprehend, much less deal with?
[55:45.440 --> 55:50.080]  And what do you think of Obamacare and where it's going
[55:50.080 --> 55:51.520]  on this April Fool's Day?
[55:52.560 --> 55:54.080]  Let's go to Justin in Texas.
[55:54.080 --> 55:55.200]  Thanks for calling in, Justin.
[55:55.200 --> 55:55.840]  You're on the air.
[55:56.720 --> 55:58.000]  How's it going, Alex?
[55:58.000 --> 55:58.480]  Good, brother.
[55:58.480 --> 55:59.120]  Thanks for calling in.
[55:59.120 --> 55:59.840]  What's on your mind?
[56:00.800 --> 56:03.760]  Well, the hoax I was calling about is a couple of days ago,
[56:03.760 --> 56:06.560]  I got a call and I answered and the guy was like,
[56:06.560 --> 56:09.120]  hey, you want a package and stuff, you know?
[56:09.120 --> 56:11.040]  And I was like, you know, I didn't know anything
[56:11.040 --> 56:12.320]  about a package.
[56:12.320 --> 56:13.920]  And I told him I wasn't interested.
[56:13.920 --> 56:15.920]  He told me, ask you and hung up.
[56:15.920 --> 56:18.560]  And so, you know, I was like, that was weird.
[56:18.560 --> 56:20.960]  So I'll call it back and then I'll leave a message
[56:20.960 --> 56:23.120]  saying, hey, I'm really interested in your package.
[56:23.120 --> 56:24.800]  And he calls me back next morning.
[56:24.800 --> 56:26.480]  I'm all acting like I'm interested, you know?
[56:27.040 --> 56:30.160]  And then he starts digging for personal information.
[56:30.160 --> 56:32.720]  And as soon as he asks, he's like, I mean, how old are you?
[56:32.720 --> 56:34.240]  And I was like, you know, I'm old enough to know
[56:34.240 --> 56:36.480]  that this is the worst game I've ever seen in my life.
[56:36.480 --> 56:38.880]  And he literally started cussing me out for like two minutes
[56:38.880 --> 56:40.640]  and said that if I hang up right now,
[56:40.640 --> 56:43.520]  I can call somebody else and just get them all there
[56:43.520 --> 56:44.080]  information.
[56:45.760 --> 56:48.720]  So you were, I mean, was it a navigator that called you?
[56:49.520 --> 56:51.040]  I have no clue who it was.
[56:51.040 --> 56:52.640]  I said it was from Jamaica.
[56:52.640 --> 56:54.560]  Was the number was from Jamaica.
[56:54.560 --> 56:56.320]  And it was like JM exchange.
[56:56.320 --> 56:58.560]  Well, that's the thing is third world countries
[56:58.560 --> 57:01.600]  are just bombarding the US because we are known
[57:01.600 --> 57:02.880]  as suckers worldwide.
[57:03.920 --> 57:05.520]  The most gullible, quite frankly.
[57:05.520 --> 57:07.760]  It's not that we're all gullible, but on average,
[57:07.760 --> 57:09.280]  we're like the right whale.
[57:09.280 --> 57:11.120]  Do you know the story of the right whale?
[57:12.080 --> 57:12.640]  No, sir.
[57:12.640 --> 57:14.000]  You know why it was called the right whale?
[57:14.880 --> 57:15.520]  No.
[57:15.520 --> 57:16.400]  Oh, I appreciate your call.
[57:16.400 --> 57:17.120]  Let me tell you that story.
[57:17.120 --> 57:18.880]  And then we're gonna go to break, come back with more calls,
[57:18.880 --> 57:21.520]  which fits into planet hoax and Obamacare.
[57:22.160 --> 57:24.320]  The right whale would come over and snuggle boats.
[57:25.200 --> 57:27.920]  The right whale was friendly, gregarious, sweet,
[57:27.920 --> 57:28.640]  liked humans.
[57:29.600 --> 57:30.800]  If they see you out swimming,
[57:30.800 --> 57:33.120]  they'll come over and start nuzzling you lovingly.
[57:33.120 --> 57:36.640]  They're very, very fat and have a lot of blubber
[57:36.640 --> 57:38.880]  that had the whale oil they needed to light lamps.
[57:39.760 --> 57:42.000]  It was the invention of other types of oil
[57:42.000 --> 57:46.880]  and discovery of oil that helped whales not become extinct.
[57:48.160 --> 57:50.960]  And they hunted them down, they think to just less than 100.
[57:50.960 --> 57:52.400]  And they're back in the thousands now.
[57:53.600 --> 57:55.520]  Other whales would run when they saw ships.
[57:56.160 --> 57:58.320]  Other whales would dive deep when they saw ships.
[57:58.960 --> 58:01.200]  Sperm whales would run when they saw ships.
[58:01.200 --> 58:05.280]  They would try to smash up the rowboats, aka Moby Dick.
[58:07.200 --> 58:07.840]  Not the right whale.
[58:07.840 --> 58:09.600]  They would swim at the harpoons.
[58:09.600 --> 58:11.280]  And that's America.
[58:12.560 --> 58:14.880]  We were more like a sperm whale 100 years ago.
[58:14.880 --> 58:16.320]  We now behave like a right whale.
[58:17.600 --> 58:18.720]  Fat, dumb, and happy.
[58:18.720 --> 58:21.280]  And never saw a harpoon we didn't want to swallow.
[58:22.160 --> 58:23.920]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:23.920 --> 58:26.240]  That's the bottom line on that.
[58:27.440 --> 58:29.040]  And of course, we're talking about Obama when we talk.
[58:31.520 --> 58:33.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come right back
[58:33.840 --> 58:35.520]  with more of your phone call straight ahead.
[58:35.520 --> 58:37.760]  It's Planet Hoax, April 1st.
[58:37.760 --> 58:39.760]  Hope you like Obamacare, suckers.
[58:40.800 --> 58:41.680]  Thank you for listening.
[58:41.680 --> 58:42.960]  If you don't, you're racist.
[58:42.960 --> 58:44.080]  We have the article proving it.
[58:44.080 --> 58:46.320]  Visit GCN Live.com today.
[58:50.160 --> 58:54.800]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[58:54.800 --> 58:57.040]  and replaced with the halogen bromine,
[58:57.040 --> 59:00.880]  a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[59:00.880 --> 59:02.960]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[59:02.960 --> 59:03.760]  Fluoride.
[59:03.760 --> 59:05.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[59:05.520 --> 59:09.040]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[59:09.040 --> 59:12.240]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[59:12.240 --> 59:15.200]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table.
[59:15.200 --> 59:17.200]  And the results are on record.
[59:17.200 --> 59:20.640]  Reports documented a 15-point IQ increase
[59:20.640 --> 59:23.520]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[59:23.520 --> 59:25.920]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[59:25.920 --> 59:28.880]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base,
[59:28.880 --> 59:32.400]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.040]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:17.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.800]  We're back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:32.880]  Into the second hour, it is April Fool's Day.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:36.080]  I haven't gotten into the latest scams in Obamacare,
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.920]  but you know them.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.920]  We've got major geopolitical news,
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:43.440]  major news on North Korea front,
[01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:46.560]  where North Koreans trade shellfire with each other.
[01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.320]  And there's been a big earthquake,
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.320]  they think could be an atomic detonation.
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.880]  We've got more of that coming up.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.480]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.080]  We're talking about, have you just joined us?
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.080]  What are the big hoaxes in government right now?
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:01.120]  What do you think of Obamacare?
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.240]  I mean, doesn't matter of almost 80% of people,
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:06.320]  some polls higher than 80, are against it.
[01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.720]  It's just, they just, both parties at the top
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.720]  are making sure it stays in place.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.720]  And can these criminals keep riding on our back?
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.720]  I mean, is there any end to it?
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.720]  Let's talk to Pete in Pennsylvania.
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.720]  Thanks for calling. You're on the air, Pete.
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:19.720]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.720]  Hey, brother.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.720]  One of the hoaxes I wanted to talk about,
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:26.720]  and I think it's a big hoax for young people
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.720]  in this country today,
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:32.720]  is the lie that you have to go to college.
[01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.720]  I think that once the government got involved with college,
[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.720]  it became a huge hoax.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.720]  And they know that they shipped all the jobs overseas,
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:44.720]  and that you'll be in debt once you get out.
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:47.720]  So, and you're not going to be able to find a job,
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:50.720]  so it just keeps you a slave to the big banks.
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.720]  They use them as like a liberal propaganda center.
[01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.720]  And I don't know, I just think that college never,
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.720]  it used to be a good thing,
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.720]  but now it's just become a hoax
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.720]  and just a money-making scheme for banks.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:08.720]  You know, I've been thinking about writing a book
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:10.720]  about how college is a hoax
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:13.720]  and show how of almost every major company,
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.720]  starter or trailblazer or inventor,
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.720]  almost none of them went to college or finished it.
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:21.720]  And you go to college to learn how to work in a corporation
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:23.720]  and learn how to comply.
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.720]  If you're going to be an engineer or a lawyer or a doctor,
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:26.720]  you need to go.
[01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.720]  But everything else is a hoax, is a fraud.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.720]  Unless you want to be, say, an academic
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.720]  and work at the college or be an archeologist or something,
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:34.720]  then you need to go there.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.720]  But most of the degrees they hand out,
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.720]  and this is on record, are overpriced and you're right.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.720]  Just like we had the best healthcare up into the 60s,
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.720]  government got involved, wrecked it,
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:45.720]  now they're getting involved more,
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:48.720]  totally wrecking it with special interest.
[01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.720]  We had some of the best colleges in the world,
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:52.720]  now they're an absolute joke.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.720]  I mean, hundreds of thousands of dollars
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.720]  with incredible interest rates
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.720]  and almost everyone I know,
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.720]  I know people that have three degrees,
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.720]  and they're working two jobs and are bankrupt.
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.720]  Now I know folks that also have degrees
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:06.720]  that went outside of their own business
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.720]  that are doing great, but,
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.720]  and it stalls you until you're like 30,
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.720]  getting two or three degrees.
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.720]  I cannot tell you how many people I know
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.720]  that have all these degrees,
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.720]  and then they're a masseuse,
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.720]  or they own a lawn mowing company,
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.720]  or they own a restaurant,
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:24.720]  or they are a yoga instructor,
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.720]  or they own a shop,
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.720]  and they're like 45 years old
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:30.720]  and are finally living a good life
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.720]  because they're an entrepreneur,
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.720]  and they're finally paying off their student loans.
[01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:39.720]  I mean, this is the new form of slavery,
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.720]  as a total joke.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.720]  For chemistry, and when I came out,
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.720]  the best job I could get was $15 an hour,
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.720]  and like a highly specialized degree,
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:53.720]  and if I wanted to dance,
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.720]  I would have had to go get a PhD,
[01:03:55.720 --> 01:04:00.720]  which would have put me another $60,000 to $80,000 in debt.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.720]  Luckily, I had a background in construction and electrical,
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.720]  and I was able to be an electrician,
[01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.720]  but yeah, it's a total hoax.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.720]  Unbelievable. Good to hear from you.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:13.720]  You know, I mentioned a bunch of hoaxes today
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:14.720]  to not mention education.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.720]  That's got to be one of the biggest whoppers.
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:19.720]  But again, the federal reserve is not federal.
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:22.720]  Whopper, IRS, not one red cent of the money you pay
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:23.720]  goes around the country.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.720]  Ronald Reagan's own congressional commission in Congress, 1981.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:31.720]  Whopper, just whopper, whopper, whopper,
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.720]  whopper, whopper, whopper, whopper.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.720]  Now, I'll tell you a degree that will pay,
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.720]  and that's mining.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.720]  And I'll tell you another degree, the maintenance of robots.
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:46.720]  I mean, I know so many people that are good mechanics,
[01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:47.720]  you know, that have got great jobs
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.720]  because they're hardworking and smart.
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:49.720]  Let me tell you about companies.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.720]  They end up putting in positions
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.720]  who gets the job done and doesn't give them trouble.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.720]  And I guess college, you know, is good for something.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:27.720]  I don't know what.
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.720]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:34.720]  without the headaches and heartburn
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.720]  that so many other coffees give me personally.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.720]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.720]  And it's taken us years to secure connections directly
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.720]  to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.720]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two,
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.720]  and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:51.720]  Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:54.720]  You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.720]  a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:59.720]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:28.720]  Welcome to the course of InfoWarsLife
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.720]  fluoride shield formulation.
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:33.720]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients
[01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:36.720]  from around the world to help the body remove
[01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.720]  not just toxic fluoride residues from the body,
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.720]  but a whole host of toxic substances.
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.720]  Let's take a stand against the globalist
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.720]  by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.720]  I use fluoride shield every day.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:49.720]  Secure your fluoride shield
[01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.720]  and other pioneering formulations

[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.720]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:57.720]  and support the InfoWars at the same time.
[01:06:57.720 --> 01:07:26.720]  That's infowarslife.com.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:30.720]  I employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.720]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach.
[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.720]  And that's why I stock my pantry
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.720]  with high-quality storable foods from my Patreon supply.
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.720]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com.

[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.720]  or call their preparedness specialist
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:50.720]  at 866-229-0927.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.720]  That's 866-229-0927.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.720]  Do business with someone who shares your values.
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:59.720]  Go to mypatriotsupply.com.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:05.720]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:07.720]  deep behind enemy lines,
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:09.720]  the information war continues.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:13.720]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.720]  We're taking first-time callers today on April Fools.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:27.720]  What do you think the biggest government-slash-globalist-corporate hoax is?
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:30.720]  Last caller brought up public education.
[01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.720]  Well, he brought up secondary education.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.720]  The big college systems.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.720]  It was pointing out that since government got involved in it,
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.720]  it's been turned into nothing but a social engineering system.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.720]  And even mainline publications like Money Magazine and Forbes admit
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.720]  for most people college is a dead end.
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.720]  These jobs don't exist that you're going to school for
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:53.720]  and you're paying way too much for what they're worth.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.720]  Great point.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.720]  But of course, we're talking about hoaxes because we're discussing
[01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:00.720]  Obamacare here today, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.720]  And some of the Obamacare headlines that I wanted to get to
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:08.720]  before we go back to your calls are right here in front of me.
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:12.720]  Despite deadline, traffic to healthcare.gov,
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.720]  trailsdrudgereport.com and infowars.com.
[01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:20.720]  Massive and expensive propaganda campaign in the billions of dollars,
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.720]  I should add, hundreds of millions on media,
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.720]  is a total and complete failure.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:32.720]  And when you look at it, Drudge is in the top 100 websites.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.720]  Infowars.com is in the top 1,000 websites.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.720]  Drudge is number one for news.
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.720]  I think it's like 30 or something on the web or 10.
[01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.720]  I forget it's always up and down.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:50.720]  And then if you look at healthcare.gov
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.720]  and all the other sites combined that go into that one URL,
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:59.720]  it's in the top 5,000, sometimes in the top 10,000.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.720]  It drops.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.720]  So there you go.
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.720]  You can go look at those numbers for yourself.
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:08.720]  The great mighty website that they say 6 million people have logged into
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.720]  and worked so wonderfully doesn't work.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.720]  And coming in at the bottom of the hour, Joe, who's one of our engineers
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:16.720]  on the new TV studio that's done.
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.720]  I've just got to get in there and start doing it.
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.720]  I've got so much going on though right now.
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:21.720]  But we're getting there, folks.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:22.720]  We're working hard.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:25.720]  Don't worry that a lot of unforeseen family stuff come up
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.720]  the last few months.
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:27.720]  It's really thrown a monkey ridge and everything.
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.720]  But things are getting better by the grace of God.
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.720]  But continuing, he's going to come in.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:36.720]  He spent hours this weekend and today doing a test of it.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.720]  And we've got video of that coming up on the nightly news soon.
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.720]  And it just does not work.
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.720]  It's a total fraud.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.720]  It's designed to be a fraud.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.720]  I predicted the website wouldn't work.
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:47.720]  Because they want to make it about the website not working,
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:49.720]  not that it's a giant fraud.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:54.720]  Just like they're now admitting, oh, the IRS will be taking your bank account.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.720]  So there is that report.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:00.720]  A health care website stumbles on last day.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.720]  CNBC reports and it's been up and down.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.720]  Cleveland Clinic CEO, three quarters of Americans who signed up for
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:10.720]  Obamacare now have higher premiums.
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.720]  I think that's a conservative number.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.720]  That's out of CBS News.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.720]  Obamacare advocate on deadline.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:22.720]  This is like trying to find a parking spot at a Walmart on December 21st or 23rd.
[01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:25.720]  No, it's like trying to find a parking spot on the moon.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:26.720]  It just doesn't exist.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.720]  It's a fraud.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:33.720]  What they do is they'll pass you on to select globalist Warren Buffett insurance companies.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:38.720]  When you get on the website, they'll finally give you a phone number to a navigator
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.720]  that's an organized crime figure who will then pump you for your social security number,
[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:47.720]  shell it to a dozen different criminal organizations, and then load you into the IRS database.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.720]  It is chump planet.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:53.720]  It is where you go to be gang robbed.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:57.720]  And Americans love to be robbed, love to be pimped, love to be abused.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:02.720]  And I'm sitting there telling Democrats I know who finally are waking up this is a bad deal.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.720]  I was talking to some Democrats last night and they're like, really?
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.720]  They really are screwing us.
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.720]  It really is a big scam.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.720]  It really is increasing premiums.
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:11.720]  It really doesn't work.
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.720]  It really is a fraud.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.720]  It really is a criminal takeover.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.720]  Obama is the more effective of evils.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.720]  I see what you're saying.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:19.720]  You're right.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:20.720]  Oh my gosh.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.720]  Yes.
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:22.720]  Yes.
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:23.720]  That's it.
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:24.720]  Now you get it.
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.720]  Covered Californian.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:29.720]  That's the name of their organization.
[01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:30.720]  Covered Californian.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.720]  You notice the name is, everyone's covered.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720]  It's affordable.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.720]  No, it's not.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.720]  It's all a hoax.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.720]  The names are covered California, covered in lies, covered in scams, covered in fraud,
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:44.720]  covered in white collar scams, posing as trendy liberals with non-threatening twit voices
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.720]  that they've been militarily trained to use so you don't resist them.
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.720]  Oh, it's so liberal.
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:56.720]  Covered Californian sends deaf callers to hotline offering hot ladies.
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.720]  CBS News, you can't make this up.
[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:02.720]  Oh baby, I'm so glad you called.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.720]  What are you wearing right now?
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.720]  I guess you're covered in something else.
[01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:12.720]  Here's another one out of the New York Times, a whitewash article.
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.720]  I mean, this is just too, too insane.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:19.720]  Interpreter snores on phone after being on hold with Obamacare counselor.
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:22.720]  There's people falling asleep.
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.720]  The enrollment deadline.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.720]  There's no deadline.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.720]  There's no taxes if you don't do it.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:30.720]  But there is a deadline and a penalty.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.720]  Again, another hoax.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.720]  But don't worry.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:36.720]  Valerie Jarrett says, quote, sign up for healthcare today and her tweet.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.720]  It's easy, peasy.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:44.720]  Retweet, Paul Bogala, who said, stroke of the pen, law of the land, kind of cool to be a dictator.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.720]  I signed up for Obamacare.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:47.720]  Here's why.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:50.720]  And they just keep telling you, I signed up.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.720]  Turns out these people already have insurance.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.720]  They just sign up for any of it.
[01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:56.720]  That's a whole scandal right there.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.720]  They just go, I did it.
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.720]  Come on, come on mice.
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.720]  I ate the decon.
[01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:02.720]  Come eat some.
[01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.720]  They're like, you know, acting like they're eating the decon.
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.720]  They're the Judas goats that lead you into the slaughter.
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.720]  You know what a Judas goat is?
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:14.720]  It's the head Billy goat who's trusted and who's old and who everybody follows.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.720]  And who's dominant.
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:21.720]  And then every year, when they decide to slaughter a large portion of the goats and sell the meat or sell them,
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.720]  they lead you into the barn.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:24.720]  The Judas goat does that.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.720]  It's a trained goat used in general animal herding.
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:34.720]  The Judas goat is trained to associate with sheep or cattle, leading them in a specific direction.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:39.720]  In stockyards, a Judas goat will lead sheep to slaughter while its own life is spared.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:44.720]  Judas goats are also used to lead other animals to specific pins or onto trucks.
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:50.720]  They have fallen out of use in recent times, but can still be found in various smaller slaughterhouses
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.720]  in some parts of the world.
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:57.720]  Maybe that should be the American flag as a Judas goat leading a bunch of people.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:03.720]  I mean, these people are literally scientific predators that study psych warfare and how to rob you and your family.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.720]  You understand that?
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:06.720]  They're hardcore.
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:12.720]  They literally put bug poison in the water and give you seven-fold bone cancer and brain damage.
[01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:16.720]  You like brain cancer at age 35?
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:22.720]  We have folks in the office who have family at 30-something dying of brain cancer.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.720]  And don't worry, you're going to get yours because the government loves you.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:27.720]  Hey, look, they're liberal.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:32.720]  There's a bunch of pin-neck women up there with beady eyes telling you how much they love you.
[01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:36.720]  And don't worry, they work for Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and they're going to take real good care of you.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:41.720]  So roll up your sleeves and take the vaccines and get ready to start the journey to hell.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.720]  Excuse me, because Valerie Jarrett said so.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:52.720]  You know, I said I wanted to play this propaganda clip and then go back to the calls, the EPA propaganda.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:16:00.720]  But first, I want to play Sebelius has no comment after hearing Oklahoma's opposition to Obamacare.
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.720]  And then I want to tie that into Rachel Ray with Biden, making it all about how great his skin looks.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:13.720]  See, it's all about trendiness and just getting you in a giggly, happily suspended disbelief, chump mood, the Judas goats.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:19.720]  And oh my gosh, Obama's on the Daily Show. He's on Colbert. He's on Sports Center almost every day.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.720]  He's on all the entertainment shows. Ellen DeGeneres.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:28.720]  Oh my gosh, everybody loves it. We ought to be so thankful to you. It works perfectly, Obama.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.720]  Remember that quote last week? That's a Judas goat.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.720]  Hey, goats, sheep, come on into this pin. It's really fun in here.
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:43.720]  Girl, it's standing out on the rock over hot lava. Oh, the jetpack on about to take off. Jump into the red stuff.
[01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:47.720]  It feels really good. It's warm. No, no, don't stick your toe in. Jump.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.720]  And then you jump on the lava and Valerie Jarrett and Ellen DeGeneres just jetpack out of there on the private jet.
[01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:59.720]  Ha ha ha, morons. Ah! I mean, you know, it's just all scientific hatred of you and your family, period.
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.720]  And it's working great.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.720]  On the table each and every day.
[01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:07.720]  But at least last check, 64% of Oklahomans aren't buying into the healthcare plan.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:11.720]  They don't like Obamacare and they've been pretty vocal about it.
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:23.720]  Now, that's going to be a still continue to be a tough sell, but we'll see how that plays out over the coming months.
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.720]  All right, Secretary Sebelius, thank you so much for being with us this morning.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:31.720]  I think we've probably lost sound here or something.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:37.720]  And then she goes on in the full clip to say, no, no, I can hear you. I'm just not going to respond.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.720]  We had the full clip this morning. It's even better in the full clip when she goes, no, I'm getting your audio.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.720]  I'm just not responding.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.720]  Sound here or something.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.720]  I can hear you, but thanks for having me.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:51.720]  You're welcome.
[01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:56.720]  See, that's the military way. It's all scientific. They do not respond.
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.720]  When you catch them in a line, they don't respond.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:06.720]  When you throw an info they can't counter. They do not respond as if you're not even human to make you feel feel all desperate and weak.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:10.720]  This is how they never respond to the hoax to the fact the federal reserve is private.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:13.720]  The fact that the IRS is this collection agency.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:16.720]  They never respond so you can never have a debate.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.720]  It's scientific handbook folks, psych warfare.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:27.720]  Now let's go to Rachel Ray, worshipping Joe Biden, talking about skin creams in association with
[01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:30.720]  the rollout of the healthcare scam.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:34.720]  I was going to ask you a question, but I got a little nervous because it's a little personal.
[01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:42.720]  I have to ask you though, you have the most glowing, perfect skin of any person I've ever seen.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.720]  I really want to know what moisturizer you use. I love moisturizers.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:52.720]  My husband is a moisturizer as well. Would you tell me what moisturizer you use?
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:19:01.720]  I mean, this is for women to watch and all feel good and go, well Joe Biden's got moisturizer and look, I saw Warren Buffett.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:06.720]  He was at Dairy Queen again every time he seemed with an ice cream cone going raise taxes on rich people.
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:08.720]  He means the middle class because he gets their money.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:11.720]  I mean, it is a total, I have an ice cream cone.
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.720]  Look, I have moisturizer. I'm friendly. I'm not threatening.
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:26.720]  I come, look, I'm in the truck, little boy, little girl, I have a puppy, I have candy, candy, candy, candy.
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.720]  Get in, get in, get in.
[01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:33.720]  Come on, I'm a nice old man, Warren Buffett.
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:38.720]  We give prizes to good teachers. Hello.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.720]  I'm not creepy or bad.
[01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:45.720]  I'm not the biggest money launderer in North America, more rich than Carlos Slim.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:49.720]  No, I'm not a money launderer in narcotics trafficking.
[01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:55.720]  I'm Warren Buffett. I'm an old man who just wants to be friends.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:20:00.720]  Not a black ops commander for 65 years, ruling operations.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.720]  When you need it the most, will your generator power equipment or vehicle be ready?
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:11.720]  Gas and diesel fuels go bad quickly when stored and more than half of generator failures during disasters occur as a result of expired fuel.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:15.720]  PRI fuel stabilizers keep your fuel fresh for when you need it most.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:21.720]  Nuclear power stations, emergency service providers and ships at sea rely on PRI fuel stabilizers.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:22.720]  And you can too.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:29.720]  Call 888-776-9373 or visit priproducts.com to find the dealer nearest you.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:35.720]  Did you know emergency essentials has a lowest price promise on all of their long-term food storage and emergency supplies this month?

[01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:14.720]  Tom, William, and Anthony.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.720]  What do you think about Obamacare and the rest of it?
[01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:24.240]  They're gonna ban wood stoves and fireplaces. It's now being announced. We're gonna talk about that coming up as well
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:28.720]  But right now, let's talk to Josh in Kansas. Thanks for holding her on the ear
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.920]  Alex, how are you man? Good sir. Thank you
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.680]  Well
[01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:40.280]  Obamacare, that's that's just the worst one. Well, that was racist. I don't have any proof, but I'm just saying you're racist
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.720]  Well, that's fine
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:44.320]  I
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:52.440]  Self-employed I have been for years. Well, that's racist. Yep, and doing my own taxes and that wasn't working
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:55.280]  So I talked to a new tax lady this year
[01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:01.280]  Asked if I had medical insurance and I said no I can't afford it and she said well
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:06.040]  Then if you're not gonna get it, it's best next year to oh on your taxes that way they can't come after your money
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:12.640]  No, that's right, it's best to pay the five thousand so they don't get penalties and interest
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:17.080]  Exactly, but you know, you know how they respond when we talk about the penalty
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:22.520]  They just say it doesn't exist and say that Matt drudges a liar because he's opted to pay the fine
[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:27.760]  Right, but I mean their response to the Sun coming up is to say it didn't come up again
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:30.640]  It is a pathological group of liars. Go ahead
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:38.240]  Well, you're absolutely right then and all the sheets in this country just follow that believe that's exactly what it is
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:43.360]  And they don't listen a reason, you know, and the other house where we're up here in a nice rural area
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.240]  I can't
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:49.280]  My daughter seven years old first grade this year and the little school she goes to couldn't be
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:53.560]  Couldn't be better. I mean, I'm not a obviously a fan of public schools
[01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:58.920]  Oh, no, there are fabulous public schools in some rural areas and even in some big cities
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:25:59.960]  They just get the right teachers
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:05.400]  They all caught it quietly buck the system and they rebel and actually do a good job
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:10.960]  By keeping control of the school and by creating a good environment. There are a lot of good public schools
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.720]  I mean, I've got to admit that
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:18.480]  Yeah, absolutely. This one this one's the best. I mean and and your younger great. You're not allowed to have boyfriend
[01:26:18.880 --> 01:26:23.240]  There's there's none of that you're there to learn you're there to be a good student
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:28.440]  You don't mess around with any of that kind of well, that's it. They know in psychology you either keep incredible
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.800]  Discipline on them when they're little or they're gonna turn into absolute maniacs
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:37.560]  What they do is no discipline when they're little then they act like maniacs later. So you put them all in jail
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:42.480]  Absolutely, and and so again where where we live it is
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:48.840]  It's it's a smaller community everybody knows everybody. It's it's a whole lot better place to be
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.640]  I mean not a whole lot to do around here, but you couldn't ask for
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:54.840]  Well, Michael Moore says that people are fleeing to the countryside
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.960]  By the way, I see folks black white Hispanic run in the countryside and homeschooling because you're racist
[01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:06.120]  Remember he said that you know gun owners are mainly white and they do it because they're racist
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:13.280]  Which isn't even really true the truth is they're freaking out because demographically minorities and women are the fastest growing group buying guns
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:16.800]  We just got a bunch of the women in the office to go out and shoot
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:19.400]  We've got videos of that coming on the nightly news this week
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:26.160]  It's our job to get women out and get them shooting because believe me the real feminist is Annie Oakley not Gloria Steinem
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.280]  Great points are good to hear from you. What do you think the hoax is real fast?
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:34.760]  Obamacare he dropped off. I think it was saying Obamacare. Okay. I got a move here. I'm just taking too long
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:39.360]  Let's talk to rage in New Mexico. Thanks for holding you're on the year. Go ahead
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:46.240]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me. I just wanted to let you know that the entire state of New Mexico to the hoax
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:53.600]  I am livid at the police state that we've seen they've turned our police cars to the DHS requisite black and white
[01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.160]  They have my train with SWAT team in the large urban area here
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:02.280]  I can't say which one I can tell you that we there are two hundred thousand dollars worth of
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:06.920]  Night vision equipment alone. Those guys are equipped better than Fallujah
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.120]  And they got it all from a DHS grant now
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:17.840]  We know the DHS favors counties where there's special airborne or drone surveillance so you can extrapolate what you want from that
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.520]  This place is so corrupt. It's unbelievable
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:27.080]  There's more a private unmarked airstrips in the state of New Mexico than anywhere else in the country
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.600]  We're right in the corridor
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:36.280]  Half of the art market was initially funded back in the 70s by people mulling coke
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.040]  Through this course, of course and the police all over New Mexico
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.200]  Famously turn a blind eye to drugs
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:45.680]  But then meanwhile if they remember the guy they kept in jail for two years
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:51.240]  Well, they pulled over drinking and driving who was kept in a dungeon and when he was released out of that town had like a
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:57.760]  Two-foot beard remember that story of years ago at absolutely and this latest shooting is incomprehensible
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:03.200]  You're a country boy, and I've heard you talk about it a few times. What happens when you grab it you find an apple
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:07.000]  It's nasty and brown and dirty and you leave it in that bowl of fruit
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:12.040]  You come back a couple days later a couple more pieces of fruit are brown and dirty and nasty, right?
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:16.360]  You leave it long enough. What happens to the whole whole thing goes molding, right?
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:18.880]  That's what we've got here some very honorable man
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:24.680]  I'm not going to the same any of the members of SWAT who I've literally called the bother in the middle of helping little ladies
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.480]  To the hospital. No, I understand that stay there
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:33.240]  I want to explain leaving bad apples in the bunch and now the bad apples set up on top and their mold
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:38.880]  Just grows down over a pyramid of people and the public's moldy as well. I mean to the public
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.480]  on average
[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:46.480]  We'll turn their back on you in a second and they're drawing police from the public. We'll be right back
[01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:56.080]  We're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:34:00.660 --> 01:34:05.100]  Some Obama supporters still think it's racist. That's the quote to oppose Obamacare
[01:34:05.100 --> 01:34:11.780]  We've got the proof up on info wars.com the Chinese are acquiring large chunks of land and communities all over America
[01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:17.780]  The Chinese government I would add who cares of the Chinese do IPCC doom and gloom
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:23.860]  Global warming apocalypse is political theater not real science and then we have a Paul Craig Roberts
[01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:28.620]  Headline that's really kind of understatement of the year the fellow reserve has no integrity
[01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:31.860]  That's a lot of integrity robbing us into basing the dollars
[01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:34.780]  For the globalists. It's an enemy operation
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:42.780]  But going back to the calls rage in New Mexico says he works with the SWAT team and has seen the $200,000
[01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:44.780]  Just with the department. He's in and around
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:48.020]  Of night vision and you know the armored vehicles all of it
[01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:55.100]  The point is there's an attitude of shoot first ask questions later the systems incredibly corrupt in Mexico
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:57.900]  We just continue to see so many cases of torture of
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:04.060]  Abuse of people locked up for two years. No one knows where they are for no reason. No one getting in trouble
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:10.500]  And basically everything is justified and then after he gets done talking about in Mexico since he mentioned this
[01:35:10.500 --> 01:35:15.900]  We're gonna get into some of that and also nearby in in in Arizona
[01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:21.900]  Where the cop runs up and just attacks a woman for no reason is walking down the street that reminded me of the
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:26.620]  You know video the guy on the bicycle the cop walks up knocks off and almost kills
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:30.540]  Just for no reason. There's an attack dog mentality
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:37.900]  And those type of people who just want to randomly attack people's like it's like folks that have pit bulls
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:40.540]  Not all pit bulls are like this, but some people have pit bulls and
[01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:45.900]  And they attack people I have a friend who got some pit bulls and it was rescuing him and I said listen
[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:49.660]  You better watch out man. One day those things will just bite you and
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:52.100]  One day
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:57.300]  The two pit bulls got in the fight and he tried to separate him bit his foot almost off his hand
[01:35:57.820 --> 01:36:00.620]  Just wrecked him and then did it again a month later
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:04.780]  First he was gonna keep them and he's like I think I'm gonna get rid of them now
[01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:10.660]  And it's the fact that you don't want a mindless pit bull folks. That's not what you want in police
[01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:14.460]  And you certainly don't want them working for the globalist, but side issue
[01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:18.740]  Let's talk to rage in New Mexico go ahead and tell your story about the big hoax
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:23.900]  You want to discuss you're saying you're saying the state of New Mexico's government is becoming a hoax go ahead and elaborate
[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:28.460]  Start the entire state's hoax. I'm really glad that you've been getting a lot more press
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:31.980]  Focused on New Mexico. You mentioned the other day that New Mexico magazine
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:38.180]  Has a background in the very back cover story every month one of these is missing one of these 50 is missing
[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:41.140]  People don't even know we're a state and that's by design
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:47.260]  But because of what's been going on in the coverage you've been giving it more than just about any other media outlet that I can find
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:52.820]  Anywhere I am for you to send someone out here so I can really debrief you you said once the people who really know things
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:56.540]  Don't call in they meet you at golf outings or private in you know
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:37:01.900]  If events that you're doing I don't have the ability to travel. I have a broken neck and back right now
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:05.980]  So I don't really care about my life at this point Alex. I don't have a life
[01:37:05.980 --> 01:37:08.780]  We don't have lives if what I'm about to tell you isn't the truth
[01:37:09.100 --> 01:37:15.940]  We have politicians and lobbyists who are not just lobbyists, but are paid cover-up artists
[01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:19.900]  Let me repeat that paid cover-up artists
[01:37:20.060 --> 01:37:24.980]  If you'll please have one of your guys type agenda dash global dot com
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:31.580]  Agenda dash global dot com. They're a merger of a k-street Washington
[01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:38.740]  Lobby firm with a crisis management PR firm. Go to the bio section of a man named Doug Turner
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:43.460]  Look at his bio. You'll see he is a term member of the CFR
[01:37:43.940 --> 01:37:50.380]  You will see that in 2010 he provided strategic communications so you can read that as cover-up
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:53.300]  To the Japanese Prime Minister for Fukushima
[01:37:53.300 --> 01:38:02.420]  But he was also the man responsible for getting the independent governor Gary Johnson of New Mexico in the governor's mansion
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:06.380]  Everything is enmeshed. Nothing is what it seems
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:10.660]  This is the CIA's playground. It is drug-central
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:16.780]  People have a ton of money and none of them are ever busted. None of them are ever touched the cops are
[01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:21.660]  Even good men when they're in a group of 20 or 30 like that steam
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:30.220]  will shoot or will do exactly what they're told because they're trained to follow orders independently they're amazing men
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:36.060]  Incredible men of integrity who I would want on my side any day you put them in a group of 20 and
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:40.420]  You take the Judas go and you turn it into one of those pit bulls
[01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:46.020]  You were just talking about and Alex you have a hurt mentality and an LT who says engage
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:50.780]  If someone jumps out of these unarmed and says bang bang, are you gonna stop the fight?
[01:38:50.780 --> 01:38:53.620]  Oh, excuse my language hack. No
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:39:00.700]  Well, that's what's going on is the militarization of police and military kill people and break things they attack an enemy
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:03.240]  So the entire rules of engagement are being changed
[01:39:04.420 --> 01:39:09.580]  Because the ruling class deals the drugs they launder the money. They run the high-end
[01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:12.740]  prostitution the whole thing and
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:19.100]  Now it wants to get rid of the larger economy because it's threatened by anyone else having wealth
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:24.260]  It's incredible sir. Send us an email to show tips and info wars calm
[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:29.020]  Or you can give us your number and David nice for doing a lot of coverage of New Mexico
[01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:32.620]  My issue is I know about the corruption in different zones
[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.500]  I'm aware of it and
[01:39:36.980 --> 01:39:41.500]  It's all fueled by the drug war. That's why they made drugs illegal back in the 30s after
[01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:45.580]  Alcohol was made legal again. They had to have something that was illegal
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:50.980]  almost no one was using drugs then you could buy anything you wanted at the drugstore on record and
[01:39:52.780 --> 01:39:57.700]  Then they made it illegal then they mixed it in made it flashy in the movies made it flashy in the culture
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:00.300]  There was huge profits in it now that it was illegal
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:02.500]  and
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:04.580]  They were able to take over our society with it
[01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:09.620]  And now we have paramilitary police running around
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:12.380]  who
[01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:18.900]  Literally think that you are an Iraqi in Fallujah if you question a checkpoint on a highway and
[01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:22.580]  They're only being put into this mindset
[01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:25.980]  Because there is a total takeover of civilization happening
[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:32.500]  Gen 21 is going to check up all the power prices all the energy prices all the transportation prices all the jobs
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:36.220]  Are going to be herded through them. In fact, let's get that clip ready, and I'm going back to calls
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:39.020]  This is a new EPA propaganda commercial
[01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:41.620]  targeting children
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:47.500]  Luminizing wood smoke folks wood smoke is on record to go out and to fertilize fields
[01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:52.900]  It's on record associated with more rainfall going up into the atmosphere. There's always been wood smoke
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:56.820]  Nitrogen it's part of the carbon cycle on the planet. It's good
[01:40:57.820 --> 01:41:03.180]  And there is a war on real sustainability when you hear the word sustainable from mainstream media
[01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:08.620]  They mean shutting you off not letting you have your own off the grid power supply not letting you have a
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:15.900]  Well means you're on the government system living in a you know 20-story high-rise 50-story high-rise
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:19.740]  Doing what they say totally unsustainable
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:25.980]  And then we had the lawyer on from Florida where they're trying to stop the woman who legally and lawfully as a well on her own
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:27.980]  rule property and her own power and
[01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:34.940]  They did a new story about her so the zoning department came out. This is global zoning written to shut you down
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:38.540]  And they're coming after the wood stoves
[01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:45.420]  San Francisco is trying to pass laws to tax fireplaces just if you have one inspectors come in you wall it up or
[01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:48.020]  You pay a fine
[01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:51.100]  You understand that
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:55.980]  This isn't a game and I tell people this on there and they go man. You're making that up folks. They've already banned
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:59.820]  New fireplaces in homes six seven years ago in Germany
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:07.540]  My parents live in a house built in the 30s back when it was cold we other cycles it's getting cold again
[01:42:08.340 --> 01:42:13.220]  Every room I've seen some old houses where the bathrooms have little fireplaces
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:18.620]  Because that's how you heated your house and the point is it's already going extinct like cash
[01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:25.260]  But they want to get rid of it. They want us as prisoners. Here is this EPA propaganda commercial targeting children
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:30.220]  Smoked from wood stoves and fireplaces and make you sick
[01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:33.300]  Wood smoke can give you a stuffy nose
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:39.620]  Make your eyes water and even make you cough. It can also cause an asthma attack
[01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:45.980]  My grandma replaced her wood stove because I have asthma. I'm happy that I can breathe better
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:54.180]  To help protect your health and the health of loved ones find ways to reduce wood smoke go to epa.gov slash burn wise
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:56.980]  All right, just like
[01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:03.820]  We've seen a 3,000% increase in type 2 diabetes. That's in the general public in Hispanics is even higher
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:08.660]  The numbers are about 2025 half the US will have type 2 diabetes and
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:14.860]  Something like 70 plus percent you can look it up the numbers vary of Hispanics will have it
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:18.580]  There's no discussion of why is everybody getting this what's the
[01:43:19.340 --> 01:43:24.260]  Different additives one thing linked to destroying your pancreas and making you obese and giving you cancer
[01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:30.700]  It was a CBS News today reporting on it is aspartame. It's an almost every major processed food now not just gum
[01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:33.180]  sugar gum has
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:35.980]  It's highly addictive
[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:42.300]  Wood alcohol, it's 88 degrees your body's 98 plus breaks down to wood alcohol. That's what makes you go blind
[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:47.060]  There's no discussion for these kids about why is asthma up multi thousand percentage points
[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:49.580]  The GMO the allergies
[01:43:49.860 --> 01:43:54.820]  There's no discussion of why you had much less allergies back in the years when everybody had wood burning stoves
[01:43:55.260 --> 01:44:00.860]  No, and of course now wood burning stoves will trigger allergies with people because you're already so overwhelmed
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:03.660]  You're already so screwed up
[01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:10.540]  There's a phenomenon now where people I know that own a few acres in Austin here in there
[01:44:10.540 --> 01:44:16.340]  Where it's been built up now from in the other town their neighbors call the police on them even when there's no burn ban
[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:18.340]  When they have a campfire in their backyard
[01:44:19.460 --> 01:44:21.460]  That's the nanny state folks
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:27.060]  That's the nanny state in America in fact, I'll go ahead and say it it's my parents
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:31.780]  They live on four acres in the middle of Austin that they bought back in the early 90s
[01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:35.740]  and they're building condos all around them you name it and
[01:44:35.740 --> 01:44:42.500]  And it's like heaven over they got a you know pool whole nine yards and the neighbors just call the police all the time different ones
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:46.060]  Oh, you're having a fire out by Christmas people standing around
[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:52.300]  You know out by the pool got a fire pit call the police your kids are yelling shoot each other water guns call the police
[01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:57.900]  Pop firecrackers in the driveway call the police. This is a cult of sick freaks everywhere
[01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:03.940]  Now the police's credit when they show up they go. Yeah, your neighbor called you. I mean everybody's popping firecrackers
[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:09.820]  I don't see an issue. You know, there's an ordinance. I don't see any firecrackers pieces. I'm laying around everywhere. I'll see you later
[01:45:10.660 --> 01:45:19.140]  Yeah, your neighbor says is someone's longer being killed over here. I can see it's people's kids swimming. Okay. Have a nice day
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:25.900]  You know, oh, I see you got a fire nice fire. It's like you're having a good time. You know, there's no burn ban
[01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:27.900]  Just neighbor thought your house was on fire
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:32.420]  It's not one bad neighbor doing it. It's it's all the neighbors
[01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:35.500]  They just it's what you do in America. You just look there's weirdos
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:40.420]  With a fire pit with a two-foot fire call the police on them
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:46.740]  An oak fire hardly even any smoke call the police on them. There's some weirdos out there
[01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:49.460]  but they yell and laugh and
[01:45:50.900 --> 01:45:54.300]  Look that one probably has red blood. Oh all the police immediately
[01:45:56.060 --> 01:45:59.700]  I'm gonna go back to your calls. It's just it's total frequent ladies and gentlemen
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:02.420]  It's total frequent and then
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:08.220]  You know, we got a place out in the country just nine acres ten acres. I guess nine and a half acres and
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:15.380]  All the neighbors get the police called on them because there's like a 200 acre ranch one side a hundred acre next I talked to neighbors and
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:19.820]  Invariably, I'll see the neighbors out shooting on their own shooting range over the fence
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:24.700]  Up on the hill across the hill from us and invariably. I see the state police pull up, you know
[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:26.940]  in America
[01:46:26.940 --> 01:46:31.380]  That matter you have 200 acres doesn't matter you had it for a hundred years doesn't matter because the neighbors from, California are
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:42.020]  G.O.D. Capital G.O.D. They rule. They rule everything. They are the power and they will destroy your freedom
[01:46:42.020 --> 01:46:48.060]  They will take your kids. They will wreck everything because they love government. They love Obama
[01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:54.180]  They love hoaxes. They love frauds. They love scams. They love poverty. They love failure. They love lies
[01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:56.180]  They love their father
[01:46:57.180 --> 01:46:59.500]  When I go to your phone calls, but I first have to say this
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:06.300]  All I know is we got to get back to being humans and not act to my total cowards
[01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:10.340]  That's all I know
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:20.300]  Briefly that's an hour and 47 minutes in I haven't plugged any products or anything yet
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:25.300]  That's how we fund the operation. I try to bring in the very best products the pro pure
[01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:31.740]  2.0 systems are the best gravity-fed filters you can get the cut off the glyphosates the fluoride everything else
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:35.820]  There's nothing even close to it. That's why I don't sell the other big gravity-fed filters
[01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:37.820]  I could sell them all and make more money to fund the operation
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:40.900]  If something was close, I would sell it now
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:45.260]  We've got some live straws and stuff that are good to just make it safe out in the middle of nowhere and stuff that are excellent
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:51.820]  We had a bunch of other systems like that, but you cannot beat the pro pure 2.0
[01:47:53.460 --> 01:47:56.380]  And we've got the full selection the lowest price anywhere
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:48:00.940]  I had to really twist arms to let them even let me sell it the 10% off of promo code water
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:02.780]  It's already the lowest
[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:08.780]  Advertisable price then you have the 10% off no one can top the prices we have on these filters
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:14.420]  They have a pitcher system that has the filter and it's only 60 bucks actually less that no one can counter
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:21.500]  No one it okay. It is the best deal out there ladies and gentlemen for $54.95
[01:48:22.300 --> 01:48:27.060]  I mean a Brita filter cost that doesn't cut basically anything out but bad taste this cuts it all out

[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:21.200]  1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine

[01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:22.000]  I want to go right back to your calls Tom in New Mexico. What do you think the big hoaxes are?
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:32.840]  Hi there, Alex. Hey, buddy. Hey, um, I think one of the biggest hoaxes out here in New Mexico is the police department's here to protect and serve you
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:39.200]  There's nothing more than city-issued dogs and assassins who serve the governor to create new revenue for the state which in turn
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:41.480]  Makes revenue for the government
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:46.920]  and they wonder why the local, you know gang members out here are teaming up with the students and
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.040]  some
[01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:50.880]  online hacking
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:53.800]  Crew called anonymous to try to secure
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:55:00.720]  lists of all city-state and government employees and their home addresses, you know
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:05.900]  And you know, I guess for retaliation, you know
[01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:11.240]  Well, I don't know what the government thinks it's going to do when a civil war actually breaks out in this country
[01:55:11.240 --> 01:55:15.200]  And I'm not looking forward to a civil war because there's a lot of nasty elements across the board
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:20.200]  But that is all the recipes that are there and they're gearing up for it because they believe it's going to happen
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:22.200]  And they believe they're going to win
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:24.400]  Some war with the American people
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:32.200]  But but again, it's not like all the departments are bad across the country. So it's really going to be a disastrous situation
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.360]  What do you think's going to happen? I
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:39.120]  Think New Mexico's are openly talking about it right now and it the census
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:46.320]  Seems to be that they're just going to rush home to home and human head and that will be the end of it
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:52.520]  Like purging the whole city like that movie, you know, just quick slam down. Thank you, ma'am over
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:56:00.400]  Well, you know, the police shouldn't be out executing the general public and I don't think the public should just go out and execute
[01:56:01.160 --> 01:56:03.160]  Everyone just because they're in the government
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:09.120]  But once the civil war starts that is what's going to happen. I appreciate your call, you know
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:14.440]  folks if something like that happened that would give the moral high ground of the system and
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:16.080]  and
[01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:21.480]  I'm getting so many calls from New Mexico and I'm getting so many emails and people are freaking out
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:24.440]  over what the way the police are there and
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:30.120]  It's not just them shooting this homeless guy and then letting the police dog chew on his dead body and all the rest of it
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:36.640]  It's it's it's you don't know where this thing's going to blow and
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:40.840]  The public knows because there's so many veterans in these groups
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:45.800]  They're not going to go out and protest so the riot cops can beat everybody up people
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:48.480]  That's how Westerners tend to protest
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:53.640]  historically is they go out like the minute men and start shooting people and
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:02.040]  The government's lined up saying we're the enemy and they're preparing to create that self-fulfilling process
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:05.080]  And it's going to wreck the country and I just I just don't want it to happen
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:10.840]  Okay, and I mean, you know the average random cop doesn't deserve to be shot
[01:57:11.440 --> 01:57:17.520]  Any more than the average person deserves to be shot see this mentality where the people are the enemy and the police are the enemy
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:21.600]  This is a disaster and the globalists are going to sit offshore and laugh at it
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:27.320]  So there's got to be some way to stop this Anthony and Pennsylvania. You're on the air. Go ahead. Thanks for holding
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:30.200]  Hi
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:34.240]  The city is the Philadelphia, you know, those are freedom
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:41.960]  But you know, I'm no freedom to choose with this Obamacare. They take away all your freedom. I guess they want to bankrupt you
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:43.200]  Well, that's it
[01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:48.920]  I mean, how could foreign banks conquer America with fake health care where they run our health care and they get to charge us
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:51.400]  Whatever they want that's being conquered. That's being usurped
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:58:00.680]  Yeah, I'll tell you when they think this do this one thing and they succeed with this then they'll figure out something else to do with you
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:05.760]  Well, Obamacare is the place to draw the line on the sand and not comply. I'm not complying with it
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.280]  I'm not even paying the fine
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:12.880]  And I'm just gonna battle it. I mean, this is the thing to battle on and you just said it sir
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:16.440]  There's the issue Anthony if they can do this they can do anything
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:23.280]  What do they think of us that they'd pass a law like this? Well, we know they're buying armored vehicles and training them police for war and
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:27.640]  Training the US Army for war there. They're planning on breaking this country
[01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:32.000]  And we better reach out to police and military and decompartmentalize them anything else Anthony
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:37.840]  Stay there. I'm gonna come back to you. I want to hear your other hoaxes, but Obamacare is your big hoax
[01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:39.840]  I'm gonna go to William and others
[01:58:39.840 --> 01:58:47.200]  This is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:52.800]  The facts are in the studies are legion
[01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:57.000]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family are
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:00.480]  Devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:03.960]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:11.800]  Simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:15.160]  Of the water supply yet, but we can help to get it out of our bodies
[01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:20.840]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive info wars life fluoride shield formulation
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:28.200]  Fusing six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not just toxic fluoride

[01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:35.960]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:40.680]  I use fluoride shield every day secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering

[01:59:50.200 --> 01:59:58.680]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:07.800]  Big brother mainstream media
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:11.120]  Government cover-ups you want answers?
[02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:20.080]  Well, so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:22.720]  Alex Jones
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:31.920]  Obamacare does double prices within the first two years. It's projected to quadruple many premiums within the next six
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:35.200]  You're seeing that happen the numbers don't lie
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:39.800]  The question is how do they think they're gonna get away with something this evil?
[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:42.360]  as people learn what it really does
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:45.760]  And a lot of people don't have the money
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:50.880]  To pay the fine to pay the interest and then you can't even really get to health care
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:55.040]  And now it's making the price go up because you've got to buy it. What do you think's gonna happen with a commodity?
[02:00:55.040 --> 02:00:57.040]  You've got to buy it's gonna go up in price
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:02.280]  And that's happening. It's real sad and it's meant to bankrupt this country
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:07.960]  Bankers run this country not your local banker the kleptocratic bankers
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:10.800]  So what do they want to do they want to get you bankrupt?
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:16.120]  Let's go ahead and let Anthony finish his point from Pennsylvania. What was your other point, sir?
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:22.120]  Yeah, I had that my house broken into and she does broken in my house and I had a gun
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:28.000]  And I told myself a gun they start laughing at me. I started shooting at them good when the police came here
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:32.760]  Here, who do you think they took the gun off of me? They took my gun away
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:40.280]  Did you ever get your gun back? Yes, I will help us to go down the court eventually. I'll get my gun back
[02:01:40.560 --> 02:01:44.600]  Yeah, the word is on that one states do that takes up to two years to get it back
[02:01:44.800 --> 02:01:50.440]  When when when you use the gun to defend yourself what happened to the thugs too bad you missed or what happened?
[02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:55.720]  They got out but I fired off the duck small shot at them. Yeah, I hear you man
[02:01:55.720 --> 02:02:00.680]  I tell you boy, let me tell you somebody comes around it comes in my house. They are gonna be dead
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:08.240]  Because they are a threat to my life. I'm going to shoot into the center of mass until I I feel safe and
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:13.840]  That's the bottom line to deter these people and that's happening in places like Detroit
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:18.480]  And it's making the crime rate actually go down for the first time in five years because the police chief did the right thing
[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:20.720]  It said buy guns the Interpol chief
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:26.480]  Said good buy guns. That's what deters crime, but most those countries in Europe. You can't even get guns
[02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:29.120]  Unbelievable thank you Anthony
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:34.120]  William in North Carolina you're on the air go ahead
[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:38.200]  Hi Alex great show today. Thank you, brother
[02:02:38.200 --> 02:02:43.360]  I have the hoax of the millennium and that is the British influenced
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:50.520]  Twisting and destruction of our rule of law that caused the people to believe that our primary tool
[02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:56.440]  for managing this government that we have created is the vote and
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:01.880]  That's not the only primary tool isn't it really the jury and the grand jury
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:05.240]  It's the grand jury is the primary
[02:03:09.040 --> 02:03:11.920]  Act by act management in other words
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:18.080]  Micro management of the government is done through the grand jury. That's right
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:24.200]  That's how the citizens are in charge of the law the judges and and have the ultimate veto and
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:27.320]  Now the grand juries have been turned into kept
[02:03:28.080 --> 02:03:30.440]  Slaves of the prosecutors in the state
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:36.080]  Here's how the rule of law tells us that
[02:03:37.040 --> 02:03:39.040]  This is all happening
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:44.720]  Article 34 of the Magna Carta where the due process comes from which is the rule of law
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:47.920]  Says that no office of government
[02:03:48.720 --> 02:03:49.840]  can
[02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:54.280]  cause a free man you and me to lose our
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:59.920]  Choice over the use of our life liberty and property. I know
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:07.040]  And that's what it says and that what it if it does it can't be a law
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:13.520]  Because it's not in pursuit of the Constitution. No, I mean look they have overthrown the bill of rights and Constitution
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:16.440]  There's a renaissance happening a rediscovery of it
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:20.240]  And there are a lot of judges and a lot of prosecutors who aren't bad people as well
[02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:24.560]  But there are a lot of pockets of really bad ones and we the people have to
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:31.440]  Literally politically go after the bad guys and stop bowing to them. I appreciate your call very good point
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:38.680]  You know, I was out camping this weekend and saw signs up for mountain lions that have been in the area and have been attacking people in the area
[02:04:40.720 --> 02:04:42.720]  Menacing people in the area
[02:04:42.720 --> 02:04:44.720]  big bend and
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:50.280]  You know, it said don't crouch don't run don't act scared, you know yell and throw rocks
[02:04:50.480 --> 02:04:56.360]  Well, it's the same thing with government. We act like a bunch of sheep the wolves are gonna come stop acting like jellyfish
[02:04:56.600 --> 02:04:58.600]  That's what brings the evil

[02:08:09.280 --> 02:08:11.280]  Have today required me
[02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:14.960]  To order the military forces of the United States
[02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:17.600]  To take action and reply
[02:08:17.600 --> 02:08:24.960]  Dr. Martin Luther King the apostle of non-violence in the civil rights movement has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:46.920]  People calling themselves members of the weather underground last night planted farms and federal office buildings in Washington
[02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:52.560]  And open, California. They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor

[02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:12.280]  The Taliban is taking responsibility for shooting down a US helicopter
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:18.120]  More than 30 people were killed and there are reports this morning that most of them are US Navy SEALs
[02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:25.760]  There may be a false flag incident where some ship goes down and you'd be used for the excuse to accelerate the next war
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:30.280]  If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans and everybody in between
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:37.480]  Is that we all hated the bank bailout the Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree
[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:42.200]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition today
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:47.480]  It is infinitely easier to kill a million people and to control a million
[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:53.120]  They estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these reeducation centers
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:58.480]  And when I say eliminate I mean kill I'm here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:05.880]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:13.320]  Dick Gregory called in he's in his car getting back to his house and so we're gonna wait to get home on the landline
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:18.640]  He's gonna be joining us to give us his take on a host of issues a new film. He's not coming out as well
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:22.400]  But before we go back to your phone calls. I wanted to
[02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:28.120]  This is mainly for TV viewers, but radio listeners can go to info wars calm and see these videos
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:32.680]  These are the type of videos that are angering people and this latest one
[02:10:33.560 --> 02:10:39.080]  So the University of Arizona Wildcat fans are out. So they call out the riot police
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:43.320]  And there's video of them shooting people with beanbag guns all the rest of it
[02:10:43.320 --> 02:10:48.800]  but behind the police line a woman's walking along clearly not even part of anything and
[02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:52.440]  And a cop runs over and hits her full power with the billy club
[02:10:53.040 --> 02:10:58.160]  Knocking her back and I've seen this footage Rob do shot of Pittsburgh after the G20 was over
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:03.120]  Women on bikes at the University that was like a police riot because they hadn't got to attack anybody
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:12.240]  They'd ban protest city. Why well that was over they go into the the University and are chasing people down on bikes and knocking them off and just
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:17.240]  Just absolute police mob psychology rioting
[02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:22.480]  And we see these footage of like people in New York on bicycles getting knocked off and getting brain damaged and just
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:29.840]  They have a word for it. I can't say it on air. It's chicken and then and then a s word after it
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:38.640]  But it's this random predatory deal of like we're a dog a bad dog will like randomly bite a kid or something like whoever they think is the weakest
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:40.280]  I
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:44.880]  See these footage where it'll just be like a person in a wheelchair and a cop will walk over his head and with a billy club across the face or
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:46.880]  Throwing out of a wheelchair when they're
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:54.080]  Quadriplegic and I just I just like and then they don't get in trouble is the issue. So here's the footage out of
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:58.760]  Out of Tucson the articles up on info wars.com
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:04.760]  It's from the Daily Caller tyranny in Tucson cop and riot gear brutally attacks innocent girl
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:08.240]  And then there's the video of it happening
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:13.760]  And again, there's a police line. She's on a smartphone. Boom. Let's say kill somebody right there
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:17.840]  Show that again. She's on a smartphone wide iPhone
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:21.160]  Clearly just a sweet young lady
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:29.400]  And then full power boom belly club under the neck knocking her back over into the concrete and that's how you get a good kill ratio
[02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:33.640]  In fact
[02:12:33.640 --> 02:12:39.080]  In fact, if I wanted to kill somebody, that's how I do it with a with a club
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:42.360]  I would find an unsuspecting person and hit him up under the chin
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:48.000]  To have him have him hit as hard as they could and then I guarantee you that if that woman died
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000]  She did go to the hospital of serious concussion
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:57.720]  If she died they have the police chief on air saying it was authorized and a good and the hell give the cop a purple heart
[02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:00.040]  Execute that woman's whole family
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:05.120]  What they do in North Korea? Now, we're going to show you the footage out of New York
[02:13:05.360 --> 02:13:11.040]  With what they do to bicyclist and this person was put in a coma and by the way, this cop did finally get in trouble
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:14.160]  After a bunch of lawsuits, but here is that footage
[02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:25.200]  So you got a bicyclist and the cop knocks him off by the head full power
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:31.000]  From about six feet off the ground into the concrete. And well, let's just say that person doesn't talk anymore
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:36.200]  Good good good
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:40.200]  Do what must be done show no mercy
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:47.200]  And it's slow-mo boom
[02:13:48.200 --> 02:13:51.200]  That's how you kill somebody like that kid outside the house
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:54.200]  That's how you kill somebody like that kid outside Austin and Bastrop
[02:13:55.200 --> 02:13:59.200]  Two girls are slapping each other. He separates them clean cut nice kid
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:04.200]  Turns around cops come over. He says sure they tasering falls over
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:07.200]  He doesn't talk anymore about his lawyer in here
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:13.200]  They kept him in the nurse's office for hours hoping he just you know deep six it
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:19.200]  The blood coming out of his ears right away, but he still lives. That's kind of a tragedy, huh?
[02:14:20.200 --> 02:14:23.200]  So now they're getting sued. They don't care. They'll just use taxpayer money to pay it
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:25.200]  So there's this new warrior attitude where
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:30.200]  Somebody stand there doing nothing. Well, you knock him over full power
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:35.200]  Oh, but don't worry the FBI is looking into taser shooting at Bastrop high school
[02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:41.200]  I don't know maybe the FBI'll do some good my whole issue isn't going to happen
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:43.200]  It's just it's just truly disgusting
[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:47.200]  That dick Gregory coming up Andrew in Australia. Oh, I should have gone to you earlier
[02:14:47.200 --> 02:14:50.200]  I didn't know you were holding from Australia. I apologize Andrew. You're on the air. Go ahead
[02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:55.200]  Good day Alex. How you going mate? I'm doing all right brother. What's on your mind today?
[02:14:56.200 --> 02:14:59.200]  Well, I want to talk about something that's been
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:03.200]  Fucking me for quite a while. I love your show and I love what you do
[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:06.200]  But mate
[02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:09.200]  I
[02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:11.200]  Mate
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:20.200]  There's been something that's been going on in the backbox of society for quite a while and it's kind of
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:24.200]  I don't know mate because I'm a defector
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:30.200]  Well, listen, I mean if it's if it's made up gossip or that I have crooked toenails I have to admit it's true
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:33.200]  But I don't know where you're going with this
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:35.200]  But if it's something about me just go ahead and say it and we'll move on
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:41.200]  But we're talking about government and big establishment hoaxes today and things that are going on
[02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:45.200]  But if we don't spring your calls if people want to bring something up go ahead just bring it up
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:50.200]  I'm out of hoax. It's the biggest hoax in society today
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:55.200]  And I was a defector since 9-1-1 mate
[02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:02.200]  And I probably would have been a defector if anything else had occurred the way I was
[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:04.200]  It's just like
[02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:10.200]  The music's all about it. Well, let me ask you a question how
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:14.200]  What is it like seven or eight in the morning there or six in the morning? What time is it in Australia?
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.200]  Before I am in the morning here
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:23.200]  And I'm gonna ask you a question. Are you either very sleepy or have you had some have you had some beer?
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:30.200]  I've stayed up. I stayed up quite late to listen to the Alex Jones show every night
[02:16:30.200 --> 02:16:35.200]  It's pretty much my only refuge because I love this show. I love how it tells the truth
[02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:40.200]  Well listen you're awesome boil down then what the hoax is because I'm having trouble making out what you're saying
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:55.200]  I reckon Alex Jones can go one step further and tell the real truth about societal hoax that has been going on since 9-1-1
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:59.200]  Well brother you can tell it. You're on the air. What is it?
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:04.200]  You know what it is you said you said yourself that
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:12.200]  If somebody doesn't become a man by the time they're 15 they're trying to find that's the biggest secret in society and
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:15.200]  You know what it is
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:21.200]  Okay, I mean I'm kind of getting an idea, but no I'm not psychic. I mean I don't know listen
[02:17:21.200 --> 02:17:24.200]  I know they have they want to rest the development they want to break up the family
[02:17:25.200 --> 02:17:27.200]  They don't want chivalry. They don't want men to be honorable
[02:17:28.200 --> 02:17:32.200]  They want us to just comply and go along and only have specialized men that are used by the state to oppress
[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:35.200]  But but I mean what is it tell us
[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:42.200]  You know exactly what it is. This is conformers and defectors and non-conformists
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:48.200]  And this is what society is based on and this is
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:53.200]  All you're saying we need more rebels we need more people to be free spirits
[02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:56.200]  No, I'm not exactly free spirits
[02:17:57.200 --> 02:18:03.200]  But listen, I really want to know you got me on the edge of my seat. What is the big secret? I do not know what you're
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:11.200]  I mean, what is it? You keep saying I know I don't I'm I cannot tell what I'm not the great Karnak here. Tell me you're a stonewalling
[02:18:12.200 --> 02:18:13.200]  Alex
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:21.200]  No, no, no, no, you're creating you're creating a paradox or or a question to say I'm lying or to say
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:24.200]  I won't tell people something and then you're on air and you won't tell us
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:30.200]  What is it exactly what it is you asked me you asked me what I'm talking about
[02:18:32.200 --> 02:18:38.200]  This is a hilarious call because because you're saying I won't say what it is
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:41.200]  But you're on air and you won't say you're stonewalling tell
[02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:47.200]  I will say exactly what it is. It is based in all music. It is based in all movies
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:57.200]  It is based in anything that is popular culture is pushed. It's an agenda and you will not face it
[02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:00.200]  Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Let's stop right there
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:03.200]  I'm gonna skip this network break because we're already getting Gregory on late
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:05.200]  And he should be calling in any minute
[02:19:05.200 --> 02:19:11.200]  And this guy'll say that we say he went to break right when the key question got us we go to break it 20 after unless I skip it
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:15.200]  Which I'm really not supposed to do but I'm horrible and I do and that's just what we do here. Okay
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:21.200]  It's in music. It's I mean there's a whole bunch of agendas in music the anti-family agenda
[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:25.200]  They're promoting homosexuality. People don't have kids
[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:28.200]  They're promoting an anti-male agenda
[02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:31.200]  They're promoting a big government agenda
[02:19:31.200 --> 02:19:34.200]  This goes way deeper
[02:19:34.200 --> 02:19:36.200]  Okay, the occult
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:40.200]  It is beyond that
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:45.200]  Well, listen, I'm gonna have to let you go because it's not fair to sit here and do this. Okay
[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:51.200]  You got 30 seconds from Australia there with your ice-cold beer to tell me right now
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:55.200]  Why you're not sharing it. No, no, no, seriously. You've got 30 seconds
[02:19:55.200 --> 02:20:02.200]  It's it is defective. It is people that go against the grain
[02:20:02.200 --> 02:20:08.200]  Maybe it's because I didn't become a man when I wasn't supposed to or whatever
[02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:14.200]  I don't know what it is. You are torturing me and I don't necessarily whatever it is agree with what you're about to say
[02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:17.200]  But I mean what is the 64 million?
[02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:19.200]  What is it?
[02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:24.200]  Well, that'll be the name of this segment. What is it the secret?
[02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:29.200]  I mean is it is it that I won't admit that Easter bunnies are actually in control of things?
[02:20:29.200 --> 02:20:39.200]  Well, maybe maybe you don't know maybe you're oblivious, but I reckon the people that do know will not admit it
[02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:44.200]  And the people that do know will push the agenda
[02:20:44.200 --> 02:20:53.200]  And man, but it's not fair. It's not intellectually fair for you to call in and say I know something that's really important and then not say it
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:55.200]  Just say it
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:21:00.200]  I am saying it 10 years ago 9-11 happened, right?
[02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:03.200]  12 years ago, yeah
[02:21:03.200 --> 02:21:12.200]  I was a different person back then and I went against the system. I knew it was a hoax
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:17.200]  I knew something was wrong with it. I could tell by the way they were reported and everything
[02:21:17.200 --> 02:21:23.200]  And then I was tagged, which means I ain't got a glass in my face
[02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:30.200]  Well, I mean I exposed 9-11 as clearly being a fraud the official story and listen, I hear you
[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:38.200]  So you're saying that there's a system where you get blackballed if you don't play ball with the system? Is that the big secret?
[02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:45.200]  At that moment, I knew a friend of mine told me when I was in high school, which I never really registered
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:52.200]  Until that moment of that glass in the face, he said, my old man reckons you're a defector
[02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:59.200]  There's two kinds of people in this world, conformers and defectors, and you're a defector
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:02.200]  And I said, no, I just brushed his off at the time
[02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:09.200]  Sure, what happens when another of us defect from the system, we build a new better system and that's what we need is renewal in the cycle
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:16.200]  So that's the answer is we need to be individuals and that's what the system fears and I totally agree with you
[02:22:16.200 --> 02:22:19.200]  You got 10 seconds, if there's anything else?
[02:22:19.200 --> 02:22:27.200]  Okay, let me just tell you, this is all leading up to something, I don't know what, it is about to happen
[02:22:27.200 --> 02:22:32.200]  And I just cannot, I cannot explain
[02:22:32.200 --> 02:22:39.200]  You sound like a smart guy to be honest, you stayed up late, you had about 10 beers?
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:44.200]  Uh, that's 16 beers, but whatever
[02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:48.200]  Alright, I'll see you later, I'll see you later bro, oh man that's hilarious
[02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:52.200]  Let's talk to Bob in Michigan, Bob you're on the air, go ahead
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:59.200]  Hi Alex, yep, thanks for taking my call, that was a good one, that was one of those ones you put down in your notes there
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:09.200]  One of the things, I kind of look at these situations, especially the hoaxes, if you can kind of distill it down to something really basic
[02:23:09.200 --> 02:23:16.200]  And the same things of course have been perpetrated against us as a people, there's nothing really new
[02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:24.200]  But Lenin said it, you know, confuse the meaning of words and you confuse the mind, and that's where a lot of these atrocities are coming from
[02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:38.200]  Telling people they can't have somebody in their home without a permit or going in and identifying things that are not in line with whatever their agencies
[02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:49.200]  These agencies are the illegitimate, quote unquote, fourth arm of government, and they're definitely being written as the actual truth
[02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:55.200]  And that's how you get a lot of these police officers, unfortunately, think they're just doing their job
[02:23:55.200 --> 02:24:03.200]  Will come out and enforce that when really this has absolutely nothing to do with what you would call the private citizen
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:11.200]  No, no, exactly, that's the hoax, they've created all these new rules and regulations that aren't even in law, but that masquerade at it to give it the illusion of that
[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:15.200]  When it's completely a rogue state within a legitimate state
[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:23.200]  Exactly, and you're working one system within the other and it's getting more and more difficult, people are talking about the results and they're bad
[02:24:23.200 --> 02:24:30.200]  You don't want somebody saying that you can't have a barbecue in your backyard or have your children playing in the pool, etc
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:38.200]  But what they're doing is they're taking that from basically the corporate aspect of this where they can say the grass is orange
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:41.200]  And because they say so, then it's so
[02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:51.200]  People have to understand and there'll be a lot of looking through the minutiae of this, but that's the big huge problem staring us in the face
[02:24:51.200 --> 02:24:58.200]  You were confusing the meaning of the words and we are being confused in our mind saying, yes, we have these constitutional rights
[02:24:58.200 --> 02:25:08.200]  Actual agencies don't have constitutional rights, they can write it up any way they want, you can talk EPA, you can talk any of these things
[02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:12.200]  And that is where a great deal of this tyranny is coming from
[02:25:12.200 --> 02:25:17.200]  Absolutely, and it's called Agenda 21, and people need to wake up to it, great point, so you're saying that's the big hoax
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:25.200]  Is that we have a fraudulent government system within the system that is slowly absorbing the constitutional system
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:33.200]  Exactly, and you just have to be alert, be aware, don't be confused in your mind, look at it for exactly what it is
[02:25:33.200 --> 02:25:39.200]  And hopefully that's going to draw a big circle around a lot of these things that were brought up
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:49.200]  Great point, great call, wow, Bob in like two minutes said more than wisdom, I can say in an hour, that absolutely crystallized a system within a system
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:59.200]  Now we're joined for the balance of the hour by Dick Gregory, always a very interesting guest, one of the top comedians out there who used his great wit
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:05.200]  To promote a real civil rights movement, a civil rights icon who marched with Carter Martin Luther King and many others
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:13.200]  And he's got a new film that he's in out that we're going to be talking about, Unsung Holly, we're going to play about three or four minutes of that
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:22.200]  In the last segment today, and since Dick was a little bit late today, hopefully we can get him back a little bit sooner for a second interview in a couple months to take your phone calls
[02:26:22.200 --> 02:26:30.200]  But he's with us till the end of the hour, Dick Gregory dot com, and he joins us to talk about the waterfront
[02:26:30.200 --> 02:26:32.200]  Mr. Gregory, good to have you on with us
[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:43.200]  My brother, peace and love to you and just thank you for being there, every time I do your show, it's almost like I was on a black station, so many black folks see me in the street and say, I heard you this morning
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:46.200]  Well, it's just a people station, my friend
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:55.200]  Well, no, it's more than that, see, there's a certain clairvoyant that black folks born with, we don't have it as much now as we used to
[02:26:55.200 --> 02:27:03.200]  But that's always been there, and so they can listen to you, and no tricking going on, and no nothing
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:10.200]  They don't even have to question, they sell them, you hear a black person talking about conspiracy theory, right?
[02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:17.200]  The conspiracy theory is the New York Times and the Washington Post and NBC and CBS
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:28.200]  And just thank God that all these radio stations, like yours, and you know, the one part of my, I listened to the last part of your interview just now with the guy
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:29.200]  Yes, sir
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:35.200]  And you very seldom hear this on the, you know, you all know everything, okay?
[02:27:35.200 --> 02:27:41.200]  Because you hang to the right, you've been in there, you've been in the military, you know what this country is doing
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:48.200]  And it's didn't say this just started, y'all know better than that, what are you fighting of, huh?
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:51.200]  What are you fighting of? A jackpaw show
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:59.200]  Back in the 60s, when I said on the jackpaw show, I said, you know, it's hard to believe this government taps my telephone
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:04.200]  And Jack went crazy, America? Taps your telephone?
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:15.200]  Well, what are you, how can you prove that at any time a Negro in America can old bell telephone $60,000 and they don't cut the phone off, it's tapped, huh?
[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:16.200]  It's tapped
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:20.200]  I'm the one who released the pictures with Ron Brown with the bullet in the back of his head
[02:28:20.200 --> 02:28:23.200]  Oh, I know, I know, you were the original Alex Jones
[02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:27.200]  That's right, so now we don't have to worry about this plane here
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:35.200]  We've seen it happen, but for some reason, a lot of these white shells that know this don't go all the way
[02:28:35.200 --> 02:28:37.200]  Well, you're scared of, you love America
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:41.200]  No, no, no, no, I agree that America's been corrupt from the beginning and so has every other country
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:45.200]  The thing is it's getting more scientific, it's definitely the evil's growing
[02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:55.200]  Oh, no, you're right, it's getting more scientific, but I'm saying when it wasn't this scientific, it was few people that understand it
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:29:00.200]  Back then when you were exposing it, I mean back then they used to kill people routinely that talked about it
[02:29:00.200 --> 02:29:07.200]  Oh, they do now, they do now, the reason, the reason it's better off now, you're telling me what they used to do
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:18.200]  This is just, here's something that's interesting, the Chicago Tribune, at that time it was probably the third best newspaper in the country
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:31.200]  They thought by they count, Friday, March the 10th, 1978, headlines, FBI memo, use mob to kill Dick Gregory
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:40.200]  You know, if the paper ran this, I bet if they would have found something where I was talking to some black panthers to kill Hoover, it would have been in all the papers
[02:29:40.200 --> 02:29:45.200]  Unbelievable, let's come back, Dick Gregory's our guest, incredible individual
[02:29:45.200 --> 02:29:49.200]  On the other side, stay with us, Dick Gregory dot com

[02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:14.200]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism and every other major disease?
[02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:22.200]  It all comes down to one thing, we are what we eat, our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives
[02:31:22.200 --> 02:31:26.200]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff
[02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:31.200]  All of this has been engineered by design, we can turn the tide against the eugenicist
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:35.200]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs

[02:32:03.200 --> 02:32:08.200]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply
[02:32:08.200 --> 02:32:11.200]  Several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment
[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:16.200]  Frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck
[02:32:16.200 --> 02:32:21.200]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born
[02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:25.200]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding
[02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:31.200]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men and women
[02:32:31.200 --> 02:32:34.200]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach
[02:32:34.200 --> 02:32:39.200]  And that's why I stock MyPatriot with high quality storeable foods for MyPatriot Supply

[02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:33.200]  Dick Gregory's only been on twice before and we've got to get him on commercial free in the nightly news
[02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:38.200]  We're like a 40 minute commercial free interview so we can put clips of his comedy throughout the years
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:42.200]  And clips of his new film and he's agreed to do it in the next two weeks so that's common
[02:33:42.200 --> 02:33:48.200]  And it really is almost pointless to just get him on for 30 minutes because he's got so much to say
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:54.200]  And again he was talking about this stuff 50 years ago ladies and gentlemen and so much of it has turned out to be true
[02:33:54.200 --> 02:34:01.200]  So you've got the floor Mr. Gregory, finish up your point you were trying to make about it being in the news that the FBI director was going to kill you
[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:08.200]  And then expand out on you were bringing up the missing plane and the missing scientist of course that's one thing I thought was interesting
[02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:13.200]  Kind of a brain theft I guess and just other big issues, your view on the world Dick Gregory
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:21.200]  Okay now what we left off was the Chicago Tribune article and that was by Rob Warden
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:33.200]  And here's the first paragraph, the late J. Edgar Hoover ordered the Chicago office of the Federal Bureau to develop measures to neutralize
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:48.200]  That's the word they used for kill, black comedian Dick Gregory and suggested measures could include alerting La Costa Nostra to Gregory's verbal attacks on them
[02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:57.200]  And it goes on and on, no matter fact I had to tell X before the Chicago FBI got it
[02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:03.200]  That's the good thing about black folks that when they were white folks understand who we are
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:09.200]  You know we did all the work for white folks, they didn't hire white folks to do that, we did all the work
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:17.200]  And it's something about white America, they knew something about us, our spirit
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:27.200]  Why? Nobody on this planet could be treated like a group of people that we was treated doing slavery and lit
[02:35:27.200 --> 02:35:32.200]  They knew something about me, they let me cook their food, they let me take care of their babies
[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:40.200]  You don't let people who's been trashed do that unless and you know something that's coming off of them
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:50.200]  So we had all the job, my mother's mother's mother's mother worked for Jesse James, we from Missouri up in the boot heels Jesse and Frank
[02:35:50.200 --> 02:35:59.200]  And when Jesse got killed Frank changed the name and took the money to Rockefeller, that's who the Rockefellers are, okay?
[02:35:59.200 --> 02:36:01.200]  See we know all of that
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:07.200]  By the way folks that's actually true, the Rockefellers ran snake oil operations out of Missouri before they discovered oil
[02:36:07.200 --> 02:36:18.200]  That's right, and the James's were Jews, that's why, and I hate to use the word because so many people use that to trash the Jews with
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:25.200]  No, that's why they were robbing banks and the railroad was because of the way they treated Jews
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:33.200]  And so consequently we knew that, we knew everything out here, we know who Abraham Lincoln the daddy was
[02:36:33.200 --> 02:36:39.200]  We know who Abraham Lincoln was and we know that because we worked in the house
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:48.200]  And we know damn good and well, there ain't no white boy from Yale invented the cotton gin, okay?
[02:36:48.200 --> 02:36:57.200]  If I'm working in the people I work for and I'm a slave that don't give a damn about me here, why they gonna invent something to ease my burden, huh?
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:12.200]  Eli Whitney, the only reason you can have fantastic documents there is because Eli Whitney came down from Yale to visit this rich slave on family
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:18.200]  And he saw this black guy sitting in the steel with a box, so he went back and put a patent on it
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:27.200]  Well, it went to court, so the documents is in federal court about who did and who didn't
[02:37:27.200 --> 02:37:36.200]  And so when you sit and you think about the information we have and have always had the poor men porters
[02:37:36.200 --> 02:37:40.200]  Most of the poor men porters were wealthy, why?
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:49.200]  Because couldn't nobody poor afford to ride on a train where they had sleeping car, it was called sleeping car port
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:58.200]  But the wealthy, before that it was the Roosevelt and the Ritz, they would hook their private car onto the railroad
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:04.200]  So they say anything in front of us because we was invisible, we know what stock was gonna go down
[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:11.200]  We know the stock market when it was gonna be fixed, we knew that, we knew sports, you know, do you know what I'm fixing to say now?
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:20.200]  Do you know how many Americans would just say, oh he must be great, 60% of all college football games is fixed, okay?
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:30.200]  And we think the same way the Germans thought right before they fell, there were people trying to tell folks what was going on
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:34.200]  And they wouldn't hear it, they just couldn't believe that this could happen
[02:38:34.200 --> 02:38:42.200]  And so consequently when you sit, now here's why your shows and shows like yours go over so big
[02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:48.200]  When I'm 82 years old, I had nothing with NBC, CBS and ABC, okay?
[02:38:48.200 --> 02:38:56.200]  When you listen to them talk about that Malaysian playing now and say we bring in an analyst, ain't no analyst, that's the IA, okay?
[02:38:56.200 --> 02:39:06.200]  It's a good game, but Americans is so naive, you know, you try to tell Americans that Kennedy, when he shot in Dallas
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:14.200]  They haven't found his brain, his brain is missing, you know, I said wait a minute, it's splattered, no, no, no, come on y'all
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:23.200]  He was shot at one o'clock Eastern time, at four o'clock they sent that limousine and he is back to where they make the limousines
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:29.200]  And Cincinnati, Ohio, to have it re-overwork, what about all the forensics that's in there?
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:32.200]  You try to tell Americans this, okay?
[02:39:32.200 --> 02:39:38.200]  And they will not believe you, what's happening now, social media, the social media
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:49.200]  When I was a little boy, NBC, CBS and ABC, they would get something like 30 to 40,000 people every evening for the news, separately
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:56.200]  They can't get 17 million people total together, because all the ones that other media's out there
[02:39:56.200 --> 02:40:05.200]  And people hear stuff that feels good and sounds good, for instance, go back to September 11th, okay?
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:14.200]  September 11th, and Operation Dinkhole, those of us that's doing it, we knew that was coming five years before it hit
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:19.200]  About the raid they made in the Philippines, and got that guy's hard drive
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:25.200]  And they listed all five places that was going, I just didn't know the days, now that was some folks that knew the day
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:34.200]  I was in New York, helping a friend of mine on the election, the election was two, so I went out on the 10th, I'm there the 10th and the 11th
[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:42.200]  And I called my wife, and I said, well you got me sleeping tonight, so you're not a friend of yours, call you from Paris and say don't spend the night in New York tonight
[02:40:42.200 --> 02:40:50.200]  I get on the train, and go to Washington D.C. when I get off the train at 4 o'clock
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:56.200]  I can't say too much on the phone, so I called him and said, I owe you one
[02:40:56.200 --> 02:41:01.200]  How did you know I was in New York, he said we picked you up on the satellite brother
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:13.200]  Now I just, you know, the next day I'm home, and my wife and my son called and said a plane just hit a New York building
[02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:19.200]  And I'm thinking it's the King Kong, you know, the little Piper Cub
[02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:25.200]  And so I go out to do my walk and I come back, they call me again and say a second plane hit
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:33.200]  And after all that I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, so we look at it and we see it
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:38.200]  And you follow it like you, you hear so much stuff and see so much, and you know the people have given it to
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:46.200]  Now you got tricks that'll call in, it ain't nothing but agents, you got tricks that'll call in and know more about the subject than you know that mean
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:54.200]  How'd you know about this much, okay? And so consequently, we was all ready for that, I just didn't know the date
[02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:59.200]  Absolutely, and again Operation Bojinka for those that don't know, prove that the government knew about it
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:03.200]  And look at kind of Lisa Rice saying no one knew there was a planned attack
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:11.200]  Mayor Willie Brown, it came out in the San Francisco Chronicle, called her, well she called him and said don't fly to New York tomorrow
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:18.200]  And again, it just shows that not so much that she or even he were personally involved, it shows that they were warned
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:24.200]  And it shows that everybody else was basically getting warned and there were little kids in the news saying that they were warned
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:28.200]  Not to go to school that week, it turns out everybody knew but the general public
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:34.200]  That's right, but let me tell you something else, now you said that ran in the San Francisco Chronicle, right?
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:35.200]  Yes
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:41.200]  Now that's very important, it ran in the San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday, did you hear me?
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:42.200]  Yep
[02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:49.200]  But the September the 11th, let me tell you another trick, today is April Fool's Day, right?
[02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:50.200]  Yes
[02:42:50.200 --> 02:43:02.200]  April the 1st, okay, Halloween, October, we never use a number for the month of the year, we always use the, and then the number
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:07.200]  Why do we use numbers then? 9-1-1, 9-1-1, what is that?
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:12.200]  You walked in the house and your mother, your son, your daughter, your wife was on the phone, you said, who are you talking to?
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:16.200]  They said, I just dialed 9-1-1, think about the look that comes over your face
[02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:19.200]  See, 9-1-1 tells the brain to be scared
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:25.200]  That's right, they picked it on purpose, as a sigh-up, it's incredibly obvious
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:31.200]  Yep, now, now, now, before that, you go back to the Oklahoma City bombing
[02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:42.200]  Now, you can't get no more weird paper in America than the Washington Times, as the old, what was his name, the Korean CIA
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:43.200]  Yeah, the Moonie
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:58.200]  The Moonie, no, no, just imagine, in his paper, Wednesday, April the 22nd, 1998, headlines, FBI paid mortgage on Nichols' home, Denver
[02:43:58.200 --> 02:44:05.200]  The FBI made mortgage payments on Terry Nichols' home after he was arrested
[02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:13.200]  And before he was convicted of consign to bomb the Oklahoma City federal building
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:18.200]  Now, the court documents show they've come out the court documents, now watch this
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:23.200]  A Justice Department spokesperson said
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:33.200]  She did not know immediately why the government was making payments, nor the amount
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:37.200]  Now, she didn't say it didn't happen, okay, but she did that
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:42.200]  And it's the same thing, almost all the hijackers had the FBI paying for their houses and tracking them
[02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:45.200]  That was even in the AP, it's crazy
[02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:50.200]  That's right, and so when you stop and think, now, everybody said, well, wait a minute
[02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:53.200]  How did they learn how to put it? They said it was working on simulators
[02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:58.200]  They had to, they went to school in Florida
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:04.200]  Well, listen to what they said now, in the paper
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:08.200]  Flight school owned by Warren Buffett
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:12.200]  Okay, again, you look at the
[02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:19.200]  And you got Warren Buffett at the Moffat Air Force Base with hundreds of CEOs on September 11th, the morning, in a secret meeting
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:20.200]  Yep
[02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:24.200]  Including dozens that were supposed to be in the World Trade Center that morning
[02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:29.200]  Yep, now watch this, the Boston Globe
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:32.200]  This is crazy
[02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:42.200]  September the 18th, 2001, flight school said FBI trained suspects prior to hijacking, okay
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:47.200]  And so the interesting thing is when the Condoleezza rice
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:54.200]  When that story ran in the San Francisco Chronicle, now another paper ran it
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:46:01.200]  Now that's Friday, September the, no, the Friday before
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:09.200]  Friday before, but that's Friday after San Francisco Chronicle's front page story
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:17.200]  See, the executive state, George Yoch, had received information the Friday before
[02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:21.200]  Not to go into New York to a certain meeting, is the executive
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:25.200]  Not one paper ran that story
[02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:30.200]  That's right, and then CNBC admitted that the joint chiefs were going to have a scheduled meeting September 11th in New York
[02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:32.200]  But canceled it the day before
[02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:37.200]  Yep, yep, yep, and so when you stop and think about, you know
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:44.200]  So now you can get your message out there a little bit better because you got all these internet radio
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:50.200]  And so when I stop and think about the first of the month, the headlines
[02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:56.200]  J.P. Morgan Bankers leaped to his death from Skycrape in Hong Kong
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:47:00.200]  Do you realize, they call it suicide, well let's let them get by with that for a minute
[02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:06.200]  To his death, there's 18 suicides of major bankers
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:08.200]  That's the first of this year
[02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:10.200]  Yeah, it's more than that last year, it's payout
[02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:11.200]  What do you think is going on?
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:17.200]  In New York Times, let's even say if it was suicide, these ain't no little tea house, one of the guys
[02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:22.200]  If they commit suicide, he just receives a $300 million bonus
[02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:27.200]  They shot himself in the head, eight times
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:30.200]  So why, it just played straight
[02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:33.200]  How come that story wasn't published?
[02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:38.200]  Now, let me show you, especially you Americans, that love America
[02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:40.200]  Let me show you what it is to love
[02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:47.200]  I ran for the president, the first Negro in the history of America
[02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:52.200]  To run for president of the United States in 1968
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:54.200]  So people said, well, what about just that?
[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:56.200]  No, they ran in the primary
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:05.200]  And this president and I, Obama, not one in the primary, you sitting now talking to the only Negro that ran
[02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:13.200]  I can't say that now because Obama ran, but all the other black folks, surely kids, they was running in the primary
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:15.200]  Now, let me tell you what happened
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:19.200]  They was planning on tricking, this was a Rockefeller trick
[02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:23.200]  They was planning on tricking the election
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:27.200]  To put Rockefeller in the White House
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:30.200]  Through Nixon, Nixon didn't know nothing about it
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:33.200]  Nelson Rockefeller could not read or write
[02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:37.200]  So he would have a hard time running for president
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:41.200]  Because he couldn't read a speech
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:46.200]  And his brother, David, one of the greatest bankers in the world, couldn't read or write
[02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:50.200]  White folks can't read or write, they call it diselected when black folks can't read or write
[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:52.200]  They say he didn't have a daddy at home
[02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:56.200]  Okay, let me tell you something about this daddy at home crap
[02:48:56.200 --> 02:49:03.200]  I was in the military, there was no war going on, I wasn't married, I didn't have a family
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:09.200]  But if I was married and had a family, as long as America's telling me to go to the front line and kill somebody
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:14.200]  You don't know that seems not to affect your family if you could kill
[02:49:14.200 --> 02:49:20.200]  But if I walk out the house on my own, all the problems in the black community ain't no black man at home
[02:49:20.200 --> 02:49:22.200]  What about the Italian mafia?
[02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:27.200]  99% of the mafia was Italians, not 99% of the Italians was a mafia
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:29.200]  They go to church every day
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:31.200]  Now you tell me about family values?
[02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:36.200]  Oh, mama mia, and they go come faster to preach, father superior
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:41.200]  I need you, forgive me quick, I killed 27 people last night
[02:49:41.200 --> 02:49:44.200]  And you got to do it quick, I got 12 more to kill by Newton
[02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:46.200]  That don't seem to count, okay
[02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:53.200]  But when it gets explained, I can take a prostitute after this show around the world with me
[02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:58.200]  And as long as I call that prostitute my secretary, that's a tax write off
[02:49:58.200 --> 02:50:03.200]  Y'all scared to mess with them, I'm gonna tell them about you, I'm telling them people out there that think they love America
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:09.200]  They don't dare mess with them up, I mess with everybody out here who's wrong
[02:50:09.200 --> 02:50:14.200]  And all I say is if you ever kill me, you didn't get an innocent bystander
[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:16.200]  Let me tell you what I'm telling you about that election
[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:22.200]  They was gonna trick it, so Nixon wouldn't win, okay
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:26.200]  And that's why they shot at George Wallace and meant to kill him
[02:50:26.200 --> 02:50:30.200]  Because he would take boats away from them, okay
[02:50:30.200 --> 02:50:37.200]  Now, the election was on the 4th of November 1968
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:41.200]  This is the Wall Street Journal, y'all
[02:50:41.200 --> 02:50:49.200]  And again, the Wall Street Journal, that Friday, November the 7th, 1968
[02:50:49.200 --> 02:50:54.200]  The electronic computers group gives Gregory 9 million votes
[02:50:54.200 --> 02:50:56.200]  Did you hear that?
[02:50:56.200 --> 02:51:03.200]  And they go here to say that the big computer in New York City
[02:51:03.200 --> 02:51:09.200]  To play at Dick Gregory two hours after the election, the next president of the United States
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:14.200]  Okay, because I got 9 million votes in Pennsylvania alone
[02:51:14.200 --> 02:51:18.200]  That wasn't meant for me, somebody hooked the wire up wrong
[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:24.200]  And so they had to shut all them computers down at midnight
[02:51:24.200 --> 02:51:27.200]  Okay, now that's y'all's democracy
[02:51:27.200 --> 02:51:31.200]  Anytime you have a democracy, look, if our democracy is so good
[02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:35.200]  Why are we running all over the world trying to force it down people?
[02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:36.200]  Well, we're the gun
[02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:40.200]  Anything good, you don't have to force anybody, ask a prostitute, okay
[02:51:40.200 --> 02:51:48.200]  And so consequently, when we wake up and see where this is going, it's too late
[02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:52.200]  Okay, it's too late, and so consequently, what we looking at?
[02:51:52.200 --> 02:51:56.200]  Oh, yeah, there's warriors out here that they kill me tomorrow
[02:51:56.200 --> 02:52:01.200]  I died, I told my wife and family, it's not about us
[02:52:01.200 --> 02:52:06.200]  Liberation is not in my house, and I spent millions of dollars
[02:52:06.200 --> 02:52:10.200]  It meant don't send the children to college, I was willing to pay that
[02:52:10.200 --> 02:52:14.200]  And so consequently, all the stuff I've been doing it for so long
[02:52:14.200 --> 02:52:18.200]  Though I've got powerful white folks that have to do it, they hate they got to do it
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:20.200]  So they bring it to me
[02:52:20.200 --> 02:52:27.200]  And so consequently, if you'll listen to us, look up the island of Diego Garcia
[02:52:27.200 --> 02:52:34.200]  How it factors in, listen to this, to the Malaysian flight to ABC, put that out
[02:52:34.200 --> 02:52:39.200]  They slept, all you got to do is pull it up, march there
[02:52:39.200 --> 02:52:42.200]  Yeah, that's the big US military base
[02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:48.200]  Oh, it's a big nasty, vicious military base where they do all kind of dirty things
[02:52:48.200 --> 02:52:52.200]  And if you want to find that plane, look there for it, okay
[02:52:52.200 --> 02:52:56.200]  And so consequently, what we looking at?
[02:52:56.200 --> 02:52:59.200]  Now here's how it works down
[02:52:59.200 --> 02:53:11.200]  There was 18, it was more than that, but the top group was 18 scientists on that plane
[02:53:11.200 --> 02:53:15.200]  Where did they work? They were, they were, they were Asians
[02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:19.200]  But they worked out of Texas, Texas Institute, Texas Institute
[02:53:19.200 --> 02:53:22.200]  And connected with Boeing
[02:53:22.200 --> 02:53:26.200]  And so they wasn't going there, they was going on another family
[02:53:26.200 --> 02:53:33.200]  What America would do, it would let a lot of companies, lots of companies
[02:53:33.200 --> 02:53:38.200]  They would let them factor stuff out because we got a Congress
[02:53:38.200 --> 02:53:41.200]  I understand, what's your bottom line, because I want to play a clip in your new film
[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:45.200]  And have you back in a few weeks to get into that, digregory.com to find the film
[02:53:45.200 --> 02:53:49.200]  That's unsung Hollywood, but briefly, what do you think happened with the plane?
[02:53:49.200 --> 02:53:55.200]  The plane, well, you got first, you say, Malaysian plane
[02:53:55.200 --> 02:54:01.200]  20 passengers worked for electronic warfare and military radar
[02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:02.200]  Yes
[02:54:02.200 --> 02:54:08.200]  Okay, now they had just came up with something, and what I understand, real evil stuff they doing
[02:54:08.200 --> 02:54:13.200]  And so the patent, so it was four of them out of the group
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:18.200]  That had filed for patent, and the fifth person was the Carlisle group, okay
[02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:19.200]  Yes, I knew that
[02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:24.200]  Now, when those four disappear, get killed, okay
[02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:30.200]  The patent was not granted till four days after the plane was missing, okay
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:37.200]  The patent, now, if you had one of those patents, your family don't get it
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:42.200]  Because the plane was missing, or you would day it before you got it
[02:54:42.200 --> 02:54:48.200]  Well, I've seen this before, when you've got like 50 Egyptian top generals on an aircraft, it just disappears
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:52.200]  When you've got Congressman McDonald on a plane with key people, it disappears
[02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:56.200]  We've seen this before, and I've said from the beginning that it could be a brain heist
[02:54:56.200 --> 02:55:00.200]  Or a way to get rid of some people, and they just redirect it to a military base
[02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:02.200]  And, and, Dick Gregory, I think you're on it again
[02:55:02.200 --> 02:55:05.200]  Promise to come back in the next two weeks, commercial free
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:08.200]  It's always amazing, briefly, we're gonna play a few minutes from the new film
[02:55:08.200 --> 02:55:11.200]  That folks can find out about it, digregory.com
[02:55:11.200 --> 02:55:14.200]  60 seconds on Unsung Hollywood
[02:55:14.200 --> 02:55:16.200]  My pleasure, brother, thank you
[02:55:16.200 --> 02:55:18.200]  Briefly, tell us about Unsung Hollywood, and we'll play
[02:55:18.200 --> 02:55:26.200]  Unsung Hollywood is where there's a black TV one owned by Kathy Hughes and Hudson
[02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:34.200]  And they decided to tell the world about a lot of black folks that you wouldn't see on NBC, CBS, and ABC
[02:55:34.200 --> 02:55:39.200]  And so this year was a new series, and they filmed me
[02:55:39.200 --> 02:55:44.200]  And just the American people, just, I mean, they she knew things about me
[02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:47.200]  Now, they never heard before, okay?
[02:55:47.200 --> 02:55:50.200]  They never knew what I was involved in
[02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:56.200]  I was about to say, John Singleton said they only allow a certain stereotype of black people out, the big director
[02:55:56.200 --> 02:55:58.200]  And so that's basically what this is about
[02:55:58.200 --> 02:56:02.200]  We'll have you back in the next two weeks to talk more about Unsung Hollywood
[02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:06.200]  We'll end the show with a couple minutes from the intro of the TV special
[02:56:06.200 --> 02:56:08.200]  See the whole thing at digregory.com, here it is
[02:56:08.200 --> 02:56:13.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, Dick Gregory
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:23.200]  I can say thank you very much, and when they say this show features living color, you better believe it
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:34.200]  1961, Dick Gregory was at the top of his game, changing the way America talked and joked about race
[02:56:34.200 --> 02:56:38.200]  I found out that cold weather makes it very nice for race relations
[02:56:38.200 --> 02:56:44.200]  Last month, when it was 15 below zero in Chicago, I walked out of a nightclub, a drunk walked up to me
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:48.200]  He said, why don't you get back to Africa where you belong and take me with you
[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:53.200]  It's beyond skillful, it's almost like he made it up
[02:56:53.200 --> 02:56:58.200]  He invented the whole concept of addressing this really serious issue
[02:56:58.200 --> 02:57:05.200]  There was never ever a black comic talked about racism to white America and made jokes of it
[02:57:05.200 --> 02:57:10.200]  I had to fly to Kansas City, Missouri the other day to help out a friend of mine
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:14.200]  A white cat who moved into an all-colored neighborhood
[02:57:14.200 --> 02:57:18.200]  And some colored bigot burned a watermelon on his front lawn
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:23.200]  I remember the Dick Gregory book nigger, and I was like, wow
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:29.200]  The idea that he was radical enough to challenge both white and black sensibilities was really major
[02:57:30.200 --> 02:57:37.200]  When he said the book is two's mother, so that every time she hears the word, she'll think they're talking about a son's book
[02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:44.200]  Gregory's daring riffs turned him into stand-ups first black superstar
[02:57:44.200 --> 02:57:50.200]  I went from fifteen hundred dollars a year to three million dollars the next eighteen months
[02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:54.200]  At one time he was the highest paid black entertainer in America
[02:57:54.200 --> 02:57:59.200]  I was the hippest thing, I was like something new on the planet
[02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:09.200]  But at the height of his success, Dick Gregory turned his back on stand-up in favor of taking a stand
[02:58:09.200 --> 02:58:20.200]  I witnessed Dick Gregory turn down thousands of dollars, he said I would rather be free than rich
[02:58:20.200 --> 02:58:25.200]  He went back down south on some, like some Harriet Tubman, like I gotta go get the others
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:35.200]  This was for real for Dick, not only for Dick
