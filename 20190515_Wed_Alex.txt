[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  You
[00:53.160 --> 00:54.720]  Okay
[00:54.720 --> 01:01.000]  Here's what's happening right now. I've been getting prepared for this broadcast for hours today and
[01:02.720 --> 01:07.120]  So much is breaking right as we go on air that I am basically speechless
[01:07.960 --> 01:09.960]  That's not something I'm known for
[01:11.120 --> 01:15.680]  We have really a particularly powerful
[01:16.600 --> 01:19.000]  broadcast lined up for you today on
[01:20.480 --> 01:22.480]  This Wednesday, May 15th
[01:22.480 --> 01:25.480]  2019 global transmission and
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.400]  We have self the 14 year old young lady whose parents have given her permission
[01:30.840 --> 01:37.920]  To take off from school today to give us a big exclusive live interview because she's not being scripted
[01:37.920 --> 01:41.440]  She's not being handed talking points. She's extremely smart
[01:42.320 --> 01:44.080]  And it's very refreshing
[01:44.080 --> 01:50.160]  She probably has an IQ twice that of AOC and so she's to be joining us live unscripted
[01:50.160 --> 01:58.320]  On air today, and we look forward to that because the thought police over at BuzzFeed, you know the villains
[01:59.880 --> 02:04.520]  They've been running around a tattle tailing on her and trying to get her removed and
[02:05.280 --> 02:07.280]  YouTube has been taking action
[02:07.560 --> 02:13.600]  And removing her videos giving her strikes and well BuzzFeed says good job now completely
[02:14.400 --> 02:16.400]  Deplatform her for life
[02:16.400 --> 02:25.080]  Get her web ID or Google ID and ban her do not let her talk shut her up. She's dangerous
[02:26.920 --> 02:28.920]  Shut her up now
[02:30.520 --> 02:35.840]  Again the Tucker Carlson said these people aren't scary or anything. It's the little girl
[02:37.280 --> 02:42.880]  But I just said girl that infers that some people might not be a girl not about her, but I just
[02:42.880 --> 02:49.240]  Well, I just committed a thought crime and we can joke about this all day. These people are serious
[02:50.400 --> 02:54.960]  They are the threat, you know Hitler and the Soviet Union was the threat last century
[02:55.320 --> 03:03.440]  We're definitely run by the bad guys at the universities and the Hollywood level and more and more people are getting it
[03:04.040 --> 03:06.040]  There's a very powerful article
[03:06.720 --> 03:08.720]  upon info wars comm
[03:08.720 --> 03:14.680]  Dealing with a man that they're calling Trump 2.0 and I was already familiar with him
[03:14.680 --> 03:19.720]  I already knew what he did his attorney general of Missouri the show me state and I was already a fan
[03:21.200 --> 03:24.040]  But then I kind of went on a
[03:26.640 --> 03:28.880]  Bench on Josh
[03:29.760 --> 03:34.240]  Holly last night this morning and probably watched two hours of him in
[03:34.240 --> 03:40.640]  In Congress and speeches and I'm telling you he'll give Ted Cruz or Rand Paul a big run for their money at
[03:40.880 --> 03:44.880]  39 years old this guy and people like him are the future
[03:45.600 --> 03:47.600]  he's populist and
[03:47.640 --> 03:49.640]  he gets the fact that
[03:51.360 --> 03:54.920]  The Democrats are working with foreign governments and combines
[03:55.600 --> 04:00.120]  to act as governments to usurp our freedoms and so this whole
[04:00.960 --> 04:02.880]  Brookings institution
[04:02.880 --> 04:04.880]  You know libertarian type
[04:06.280 --> 04:08.900]  Idea of get out of the way of corporations is suicide
[04:09.960 --> 04:13.520]  Because of the corporations are working with the chai comms and the EU
[04:13.880 --> 04:20.280]  By extension with regulations that we then go under the government not getting involved is the same as the government
[04:20.440 --> 04:25.000]  Ending free speech and getting involved and it's simple little mind games the globalist play
[04:26.240 --> 04:29.960]  Simple little mind games, you know, he's top of his class lawyer whole nine yards
[04:29.960 --> 04:33.840]  But you're gonna hear his speeches. You're gonna say that sounds exactly like Alex Jones
[04:34.040 --> 04:37.720]  That's exactly what Alex Jones is saying because it's what's going on
[04:38.520 --> 04:40.520]  anybody can look at a
[04:40.520 --> 04:43.040]  Pink pig and say that's a pink pig
[04:44.680 --> 04:51.040]  Anybody can look at what the EU and the UN and in Hollywood the Democrats are doing they're running rough shot. They're a bunch of tyrants
[04:51.840 --> 04:56.920]  Locked their asses up man. Geez. I mean, this is survival. We're talking about
[04:56.920 --> 04:59.480]  Silicone Valley needs to be rated
[05:06.920 --> 05:12.520]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans that almost all of us said we used to love you on air was so good to see you on
[05:12.680 --> 05:17.720]  The iTunes are on YouTube. Are you coming back? We're at info wars dot com

[05:28.120 --> 05:30.620]  So we're there folks tomorrow's news today
[05:41.160 --> 05:45.080]  I'm at info wars dot com and news wars dot com. You knew this
[05:45.520 --> 05:49.960]  Centreship is coming forever. We have our own video streams our own audio streams, and it's all free to air

[05:58.520 --> 06:16.520]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[06:16.520 --> 06:36.000]  Well the 14-year-old who's exploded in the last few months hundreds of millions of views on YouTube a million subscribers is
[06:36.320 --> 06:38.320]  the next person to be digitally
[06:39.800 --> 06:43.840]  Crucified then burned into ashes and scattered to the forewinds
[06:43.840 --> 06:48.000]  Like Winston Smith at the end of 1984
[06:49.160 --> 06:55.000]  And she's gonna be joining us coming up ladies and gentlemen on the broadcast today
[06:56.640 --> 07:04.560]  In the second hour my cat is gonna be host the fourth hour war room after that three o'clock central with the great oh and shroyer
[07:06.800 --> 07:09.240]  This is gonna be a very important broadcast today
[07:09.240 --> 07:14.360]  I've done a lot of research a lot of preparation for the topics. I want to get into the points
[07:14.360 --> 07:17.880]  I want to make and I really want to get these salvos out there because
[07:18.280 --> 07:24.800]  If people listen if people research if they find out I'm telling the truth and then if we take action collectively
[07:24.800 --> 07:28.160]  It's bye-bye new world order and hello prosperity
[07:29.520 --> 07:33.080]  Because the globalists admit they have been purposely sabotaging
[07:34.240 --> 07:35.400]  purposely
[07:35.400 --> 07:36.760]  demoralizing and
[07:36.760 --> 07:44.200]  Pumping cultural poison into the system because they can't run a free open virtuous people. I
[07:44.760 --> 07:50.080]  Know that's really simple a free people can't be enslaved by authoritarians
[07:50.480 --> 07:55.600]  So they want us to be slaves and the credo of slaves is
[07:56.440 --> 08:00.720]  Ignorance it's backbiting its stupidity. It's feeling like your victims
[08:01.360 --> 08:04.480]  So you lay down and die instead of overcoming and
[08:04.480 --> 08:11.540]  There is a war against the middle of the country and I don't just mean that geographically there's that too
[08:11.720 --> 08:16.640]  There is a war and everybody already knows this when I say this you're gonna say
[08:17.840 --> 08:21.120]  Jones just said the grass is green. I know but
[08:21.640 --> 08:26.560]  The enemy is obsessed with this the enemy admits this and now they've gotten so
[08:27.240 --> 08:32.000]  Freaked out that we're fighting back that they've unclogged themselves because they don't get how we operate
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.280]  So they've miscalculated. They've thrown a lot of kindling on this place
[08:38.440 --> 08:40.440]  They want you to worship
[08:41.320 --> 08:47.960]  Hollywood they want you to worship their emptiness. They want control of everything because they have no control
[08:47.960 --> 08:50.200]  They want power because they don't have power
[08:50.760 --> 08:55.320]  Inherently no matter how much power they've got it's like a colander. The water just pours out
[08:55.640 --> 08:57.640]  it's like a boat with holes in it and
[08:58.200 --> 09:00.760]  This happens throughout history. It's it's known psychology
[09:00.760 --> 09:02.760]  and
[09:02.920 --> 09:08.200]  So the left runs the gambit from arrested development fools low IQ
[09:08.800 --> 09:13.600]  Minions slaves right up through mercenaries control freaks
[09:14.560 --> 09:16.560]  absolutely evil people and
[09:16.600 --> 09:19.440]  It runs that spectrum and we have to
[09:20.600 --> 09:23.600]  Fully come to Jesus on that and
[09:24.920 --> 09:27.360]  Understand that we are blind
[09:27.360 --> 09:32.760]  To the way they operate because we don't think like that
[09:33.120 --> 09:40.480]  We have a blind spot the size of the Grand Canyon and once you finally understand. Oh my god
[09:41.880 --> 09:45.600]  There are really evil people in the world and how they operate
[09:46.440 --> 09:49.600]  Then we can start beating them and look. I know you know there's evil people
[09:50.000 --> 09:53.360]  But you've got to realize that a lot of evil people
[09:54.200 --> 09:56.200]  aren't gonna climb in
[09:56.200 --> 09:58.840]  To your daughter's bedroom at night and slip their throat
[09:59.320 --> 10:04.280]  Those psychos exist. I don't want to play that clip on Friday. I never played. Let's cue that up. That's zero killer
[10:06.240 --> 10:08.240]  For later in the hour
[10:08.920 --> 10:14.000]  But there's a lot of other cowardly evil people that set up systems of corruption and oppression
[10:14.280 --> 10:18.560]  So they can get away with carrying it out in an institutional system
[10:19.280 --> 10:25.240]  And then those of us that are trying to just have good country and healthy people and live a long time and love God and have
[10:25.240 --> 10:30.560]  Justice and we believe in success and we like other people's success and we like our success because we're confident
[10:30.560 --> 10:33.320]  We're strong. We come from you know, good gene pools basically
[10:33.640 --> 10:39.160]  We are blind to these people, but I'm telling you once you've seen their ass. You're never blind again
[10:39.920 --> 10:43.800]  And every fiber of your soul will be get them off our back
[10:46.080 --> 10:49.200]  So that's where I'm coming from here today is I know you know this
[10:49.200 --> 10:53.880]  But they're as evil as we thought they were and more
[10:55.880 --> 10:57.880]  And
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.520]  They are seeking always to have power and control over us
[11:02.520 --> 11:03.960]  and
[11:03.960 --> 11:10.320]  They want to extinguish what makes us great because that greatness inherently threatens the corrupt upside-down system
[11:10.320 --> 11:15.960]  They're trying to build they can't have a successful America. They can't have excess successful race relations
[11:15.960 --> 11:23.440]  They can't have good strong families and culture because that threatens their strategic takeover and they admit that and I know you know
[11:23.440 --> 11:27.560]  That but every moment of every day and everything we do
[11:27.920 --> 11:32.440]  We have to remember they are literally out to get us
[11:34.080 --> 11:35.560]  And
[11:35.560 --> 11:37.560]  So instead of being victims
[11:38.640 --> 11:40.360]  We're we're overcomers
[11:40.360 --> 11:47.560]  But you have to overcome the enemy by declaring them the enemy and saying to the enemy I see you I
[11:48.840 --> 11:50.840]  Know you're bad. I
[11:50.960 --> 11:57.680]  Know you don't have a conscience. You know I have one so you spend all day trying to manipulate me get behind me Satan
[11:58.320 --> 12:04.440]  You're not in my life anymore. You don't scare me. You don't bully me your labels your lies
[12:04.440 --> 12:11.200]  It means nothing to me. I'm standing firm against you and I'm gonna confront you to your face
[12:11.560 --> 12:17.360]  It isn't just Alex Jones that has to go to Congress when they have big tech hearings. I'll be at everyone
[12:17.360 --> 12:19.360]  I'm physically able to be at
[12:21.080 --> 12:25.400]  The moment you decide to look at your calendar and take your vacation in DC
[12:26.600 --> 12:32.360]  To take your children with you and no March in there when you see Sundar Pachai or you see Oliver Darcy
[12:32.360 --> 12:40.120]  Or you see any of these liars and you get in their face because they're the usurpers. They're bigger than a government
[12:40.760 --> 12:41.640]  and
[12:41.640 --> 12:45.000]  They set themselves up as our kings now and
[12:45.920 --> 12:49.840]  Induced us through telecommunications to make them the new communication system
[12:50.200 --> 12:55.680]  Where they spy on us and sell our data and lie to us and then when they get caught they lie to us again
[12:55.680 --> 13:01.880]  And just keep trying this Jedi mind trick of we're a private company. We're a private company
[13:02.960 --> 13:04.960]  Know what you are is a trust
[13:05.880 --> 13:13.320]  But you are as a criminal combine working with other groups in an oligopoly to control and dominate this nation
[13:13.320 --> 13:18.960]  You have disdain for people that don't want to be in Hollywood that don't want to worship Silicon Valley
[13:18.960 --> 13:23.000]  And you're taking over every facet of our lives and pumping us full of poison
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.440]  so you can feed on us at your leisure and
[13:28.160 --> 13:30.160]  It's coming to an end
[13:30.560 --> 13:35.960]  We're going to break up all of these technologies. We're gonna pull the chai-com operatives out of our government
[13:35.960 --> 13:41.200]  There's gonna be thousands of people arrested already hundreds have been we're gonna roll up Hollywood
[13:41.680 --> 13:48.600]  And we're gonna roll all of you up because you're the cancer you're an enemy force and you're working against this nation
[13:48.600 --> 13:58.480]  Remember a few months ago? The joint chiefs of staff got asked in Congress about Google officially working for China and
[13:59.600 --> 14:04.280]  Won't even work with our own military. What does that tell you they hate America?
[14:04.640 --> 14:11.280]  You go to any Democratic Party event any Silicon Valley event and you talk about loving America or free market or God
[14:11.280 --> 14:15.480]  They will groan they will yell at you and they will say get out of here
[14:15.480 --> 14:18.920]  They will physically attack you in public spaces
[14:20.560 --> 14:29.480]  They are so habituated they hate you so much they hate Jesus Christ so much they hate families so much
[14:30.120 --> 14:31.800]  that they
[14:31.800 --> 14:33.640]  shake with
[14:33.640 --> 14:35.640]  murderous delight I
[14:37.440 --> 14:42.360]  Mean I knew they hated America, but the last few years I go out to these events and I say hey America's back
[14:42.360 --> 14:50.640]  You know, it's you know unemployment's down and and good things are happening and they start groaning and I say I love America
[14:50.640 --> 14:52.640]  And they go
[14:53.840 --> 15:01.400]  So you do it to another group and another group and another group and they're all the same
[15:04.240 --> 15:09.800]  And it's like you get to understand these are really bad people and they've converted a large number of our fellow citizens
[15:09.800 --> 15:12.000]  in to this now
[15:13.160 --> 15:20.120]  They're basically demon possessed. I don't know what you want to call it mass psychosis. It's going on. It's happening
[15:20.240 --> 15:22.920]  We've all seen it. It's like the body snatchers
[15:25.040 --> 15:26.480]  And
[15:26.480 --> 15:33.200]  We're going to have to stand against them and stop acquiescing their bullying or it's only gonna get worse
[15:33.200 --> 15:36.640]  And you can see there's no limit to what they'll do the good news is
[15:36.640 --> 15:39.560]  They're a bunch of evil people on top. It's still a small number
[15:40.960 --> 15:42.960]  With a lot of victims and mind-control
[15:44.280 --> 15:46.280]  Servile mass brainwashed
[15:47.360 --> 15:48.880]  followers
[15:48.880 --> 15:52.840]  But we have to come into that power vacuum and lead and stop all this
[15:52.960 --> 15:57.400]  We'll lay the plan out to stop it on the other side. However, you're listening, please for the word
[15:59.160 --> 16:04.240]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house

[18:19.120 --> 18:22.560]  Researchers in France notice that people who ate certain quail eggs
[18:22.960 --> 18:30.400]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later
[18:30.400 --> 18:33.280]  We now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting

[18:39.320 --> 18:46.880]  Effective it is not an antihistamine. In fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase

[20:09.400 --> 20:14.720]  This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing
[20:16.240 --> 20:22.360]  Nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread and the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to
[20:22.360 --> 20:25.960]  Scum were beholded to scum Russian
[20:34.160 --> 20:37.520]  Please listen if you don't if you want

[20:52.520 --> 21:03.520]  The seed is planted. Sleep. Sleep.
[21:03.520 --> 21:23.520]  Please. Please. Your next word in danger. Please listen to me. Something terrible. Please. You're next. Here they are. They're already here. And you're next. We're coming. We're coming. Sleep. The seed is planted. Sleep. Sleep. Terror. Grows.
[21:24.520 --> 21:27.520]  Elizabeth wake up. Get you when you sleep. Sit up.
[21:28.520 --> 21:30.520]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[21:30.520 --> 21:35.520]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites. Is it contagious?
[21:35.520 --> 21:39.520]  It looked right at me. You need to get out.
[21:39.520 --> 21:41.520]  You're looking at it as if it was human or not human.
[21:43.520 --> 21:47.520]  Now the classic fear begins to grow.
[21:47.520 --> 21:48.520]  We're being cornered.
[21:49.520 --> 21:52.520]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[21:52.520 --> 21:54.520]  Barricading the street.
[21:55.520 --> 21:57.520]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[21:57.520 --> 22:00.520]  The land of the walking dead.
[22:00.520 --> 22:09.520]  The land of the walking dead.
[22:09.520 --> 22:20.520]  The land of the walking dead.
[22:20.520 --> 22:26.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[22:26.520 --> 22:35.520]  And we got a giant beachhead two and a half years ago in front of that elected.
[22:35.520 --> 22:38.520]  We'd relaunched America. This audience. You had done it.
[22:39.520 --> 22:44.520]  1776 had a beachhead. So the enemy said, okay, shut him down.
[22:44.520 --> 22:47.520]  We'll call ourselves the resistance.
[22:48.520 --> 22:52.520]  And we'll try to adopt a lot of Jones's populist tactics, but we'll invert it.
[22:52.520 --> 22:57.520]  And that's why they want us off the air. They are now the resistance.
[22:57.520 --> 23:00.520]  Well, yeah, you're the resistance to America. You're the globalist.
[23:00.520 --> 23:03.520]  America was never great. It'll never be great.
[23:04.520 --> 23:11.520]  And now President Trump has basically stood down his one biggest failure so far
[23:11.520 --> 23:17.520]  and not defended the First Amendment against the monopoly, combine activities,
[23:17.520 --> 23:24.520]  a big tech openly and publicly moving to China just on the national security front.
[23:24.520 --> 23:28.520]  He's done something on Huawei. He's done something on 5G.
[23:28.520 --> 23:30.520]  And now that's a major national security threat.
[23:30.520 --> 23:37.520]  But if you don't think every Apple device having its code access based in China on servers,
[23:37.520 --> 23:43.520]  that Apple admits are state controlled so Apple can be tax exempt.
[23:43.520 --> 23:48.520]  And then the Pentagon is like, well, I guess none of you will work with us,
[23:48.520 --> 23:52.520]  Apple or Google or anybody else. Amazon works with the Pentagon.
[23:53.520 --> 24:00.520]  I guess that's your right. But gee, it's kind of, you're right to move to China
[24:00.520 --> 24:03.520]  and let them have all our damn codes. No, that's not their right.
[24:03.520 --> 24:05.520]  Look, you're a private company.
[24:06.520 --> 24:12.520]  The Libertarian Institute said so. Libertarianism isn't what big corporations say it is.
[24:12.520 --> 24:14.520]  It isn't slitting your throat.
[24:16.520 --> 24:21.520]  By our government letting China and the UU write all the regulations,
[24:21.520 --> 24:26.520]  they've written them now to make big tech move over there and do what they say.
[24:26.520 --> 24:29.520]  I'm going to say it again, because our government won't defend us
[24:29.520 --> 24:35.520]  and won't regulate to prohibit foreign regulation and won't protect what we built.
[24:35.520 --> 24:42.520]  You have given it over and you're going to let them steal 2020,
[24:42.520 --> 24:46.520]  Trump's going to lose and they're just going to ban everybody.
[24:46.520 --> 24:49.520]  That's where we are right now. I told you Trump was going to win.
[24:49.520 --> 24:53.520]  He's going to lose. Mark my words.
[24:53.520 --> 24:57.520]  I think Trump's got six months to tear the hell out of big tech
[24:57.520 --> 25:00.520]  and bloody their nose politically and scare the hell out of them.
[25:00.520 --> 25:03.520]  They got all sorts of stuff to indict these heads.
[25:03.520 --> 25:07.520]  Big tech's been acting like they're invincible above the law god.
[25:07.520 --> 25:11.520]  We don't have a lot of time. We need serious measures.
[25:11.520 --> 25:14.520]  Are the only measures that will do anything.
[25:16.520 --> 25:21.520]  I'm not an authoritarian, but if our taxpayers and our engineers built Google,
[25:21.520 --> 25:26.520]  built Apple, built YouTube, built Twitter, now they're these piss on America.
[25:26.520 --> 25:28.520]  We hate America leftist.
[25:28.520 --> 25:37.520]  The normal response, you know, if Russian companies just handed their stuff over to foreign countries,
[25:37.520 --> 25:42.520]  those executives would all be found dead in their beds in a week.
[25:42.520 --> 25:45.520]  I mean, you know that, right? They get run over on the street.
[25:45.520 --> 25:48.520]  They get shot. They get poisoned. That's not authoritarianism.
[25:48.520 --> 25:52.520]  That's not flitting your children's throats is what that is.
[25:52.520 --> 25:56.520]  So fine. I mean, good. Let's just give the chicoms everything. Holy mackerel.
[25:56.520 --> 26:01.520]  They've only killed 120 million people here. Just give Hitler all the codes.
[26:01.520 --> 26:04.520]  Hell, get the time machine. Go back and give Hitler the internet.
[26:04.520 --> 26:08.520]  Hydrogen bombs. Just give them everything. Let's just roll over.
[26:08.520 --> 26:11.520]  And I don't wish any harm against the big tech people.
[26:11.520 --> 26:15.520]  I don't want to have a hot war. These people are already crapping all over us.
[26:15.520 --> 26:19.520]  They've already sold us out so far. It's insane.
[26:20.520 --> 26:25.520]  And we can't even get the Pentagon to get more than a little upset about it.
[26:25.520 --> 26:29.520]  Protect our country. It isn't about aircraft carriers and missiles.
[26:29.520 --> 26:32.520]  It's about money and communications and telecommunications.
[26:32.520 --> 26:35.520]  That's more important. That's 90% of war.
[26:35.520 --> 26:39.520]  And we don't have control of our own internet.
[26:39.520 --> 26:45.520]  Oh, that we built. Here is Senator, a month ago,
[26:45.520 --> 26:49.520]  bringing this up to the chairman of the Joint Chief Service.
[26:49.520 --> 26:52.520]  So I just want to make sure that I understand exactly what you're saying.
[26:52.520 --> 26:56.520]  You're telling me that Google, an American company, supposedly,
[26:56.520 --> 27:00.520]  is refusing to work with the Department of Defense,
[27:00.520 --> 27:03.520]  but is doing work with China, in China,
[27:03.520 --> 27:06.520]  in a way that at least indirectly benefits the Chinese government.
[27:06.520 --> 27:08.520]  Is that correct?
[27:08.520 --> 27:13.520]  I haven't heard the word refuse, but there's a lack of willingness
[27:13.520 --> 27:15.520]  to support DOD programs.
[27:15.520 --> 27:18.520]  General, you're nodding your head. Do you want to weigh in on this?
[27:18.520 --> 27:22.520]  No, Senator. I'm nodding your head on exactly the point that you made
[27:22.520 --> 27:27.520]  that the work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefitting
[27:27.520 --> 27:29.520]  the Chinese military.
[27:29.520 --> 27:33.520]  And I've been very public on this issue as well.
[27:33.520 --> 27:36.520]  In fact, the way I describe it to our industry partners is,
[27:36.520 --> 27:38.520]  look, we're the good guys.
[27:38.520 --> 27:42.520]  And the values that we represent in the system that we represent
[27:42.520 --> 27:46.520]  is the one that will allow and has allowed you to thrive.
[27:46.520 --> 27:48.520]  And that's the way I've characterized it.
[27:48.520 --> 27:51.520]  So I was just nodding that what the Secretary was articulating
[27:51.520 --> 27:53.520]  is a general sense of all of us as leaders,
[27:53.520 --> 27:57.520]  and we watch with great concern when industry partners work in China
[27:57.520 --> 27:59.520]  knowing that there is that indirect benefit.
[27:59.520 --> 28:04.520]  And frankly, indirect may be not a full characterization of the way it really is.
[28:04.520 --> 28:07.520]  It's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.
[28:07.520 --> 28:10.520]  I just want to underscore this for the record,
[28:10.520 --> 28:13.520]  so that we are absolutely perfectly 100% clear here
[28:13.520 --> 28:18.520]  that Google, an American company based in this country,
[28:18.520 --> 28:20.520]  again, supposedly an American company,
[28:20.520 --> 28:25.520]  is doing work in China that directly or indirectly benefits the Chinese government
[28:25.520 --> 28:29.520]  at a time of increased peer competition with this country.
[28:29.520 --> 28:33.520]  We are in a struggle with the Chinese government
[28:33.520 --> 28:36.520]  over whether or not they're going to become a regional
[28:36.520 --> 28:39.520]  and maybe global hegemon with values very different from ours,
[28:39.520 --> 28:43.520]  certainly values that do not favor freedom in the world.
[28:43.520 --> 28:47.520]  And we have an American company that does not want to do work with our Defense Department,
[28:47.520 --> 28:48.520]  which is one thing.
[28:48.520 --> 28:51.520]  That's because they're traders. It's called globalism.
[28:51.520 --> 28:53.520]  The Democrats want to destroy the country.
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.520]  They sold out the foreign powers. Period.
[28:55.520 --> 29:22.520]  Wake up where the country's done.
[29:22.520 --> 29:26.520]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[29:26.520 --> 29:28.520]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look,
[29:28.520 --> 29:30.520]  and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[29:30.520 --> 29:32.520]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[30:04.520 --> 30:07.520]  You are the man, Alex. I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[30:07.520 --> 30:09.520]  I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan.
[30:09.520 --> 30:11.520]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[30:11.520 --> 30:14.520]  I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[30:14.520 --> 30:19.520]  The bone broth.
[30:19.520 --> 30:22.520]  It tastes like great milkshake.
[30:22.520 --> 30:24.520]  You know, if you just add it to milk.
[30:24.520 --> 30:26.520]  It tastes like oval theme.
[30:26.520 --> 30:28.520]  It tastes like oval theme.
[30:28.520 --> 30:30.520]  It tastes like oval theme.
[30:30.520 --> 30:32.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[30:32.520 --> 30:36.520]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[30:36.520 --> 30:40.520]  I've used the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products.
[30:40.520 --> 30:42.520]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[30:42.520 --> 30:45.520]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[30:45.520 --> 30:48.520]  I'm thanking you, but yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula.
[30:48.520 --> 30:51.520]  The turmeric, the chocolate mushroom, the true bone broth.
[30:51.520 --> 30:54.520]  It is next level. It really is good. So thank you.
[30:54.520 --> 31:15.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it. Thank you.

[32:22.520 --> 32:25.520]  It's so butt hurt when Trump won.
[32:25.520 --> 32:27.520]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[32:27.520 --> 32:31.520]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[32:31.520 --> 32:35.520]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut Infowars down.
[32:35.520 --> 32:39.520]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech,
[32:39.520 --> 32:42.520]  about taking your very sovereignty away.
[32:42.520 --> 32:44.520]  This country is in a war.
[32:44.520 --> 32:48.520]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you,
[32:48.520 --> 32:53.520]  if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us,
[32:53.520 --> 32:55.520]  and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[32:55.520 --> 32:57.520]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands.
[32:57.520 --> 33:19.520]  InfowarsStore.com, thank you.
[33:27.520 --> 33:32.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[33:32.520 --> 33:44.520]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:44.520 --> 33:57.520]  So, imagine the arrogance of big tech globally working together in concert to censor nationalists, populists,
[33:57.520 --> 34:02.520]  whether they be right wing or left wing, if they want their countries to be run by them.
[34:02.520 --> 34:10.520]  Right now, you've got Facebook admittedly interfering and blocking populist parties in major elections in Spain, in Italy,
[34:10.520 --> 34:12.520]  everywhere, and admitting they're doing it.
[34:12.520 --> 34:18.520]  Facebook has announced no live streaming is allowed in Paris on their platform,
[34:18.520 --> 34:21.520]  because they don't want you to see what the police do to people.
[34:21.520 --> 34:22.520]  They don't want you to see the Yellow Vests.
[34:22.520 --> 34:25.520]  They don't want you to be able to know what goes on.
[34:25.520 --> 34:29.520]  That's what authoritarian regimes do.
[34:29.520 --> 34:34.520]  And they just announce it like they're very proud of what they're doing.
[34:34.520 --> 34:38.520]  And that's what Obama tried three years ago on the eve of leaving.
[34:38.520 --> 34:46.520]  It was to hand full control of the Internet over to the UN and an advisory body set up by the European Union.
[34:46.520 --> 34:51.520]  The very robber barons that set up the UN set up the European Union.
[34:51.520 --> 34:57.520]  And guess where they got the plan from Hitler?
[34:57.520 --> 34:58.520]  Don't believe me?
[34:58.520 --> 34:59.520]  Just type in.
[34:59.520 --> 35:05.520]  The EU was a brainchild of Adolf Hitler.
[35:05.520 --> 35:08.520]  Even the flag Hitler came up with.
[35:08.520 --> 35:10.520]  The Olympic symbol Hitler came up with.
[35:10.520 --> 35:12.520]  The Volkswagen symbol he came up with.
[35:12.520 --> 35:19.520]  He drew the first Volkswagen Beetle in 1935 on the back of a cocktail napkin.
[35:19.520 --> 35:22.520]  And all I'm saying is, isn't it amazing?
[35:22.520 --> 35:26.520]  Autobonds, big highways, Hitler's idea.
[35:26.520 --> 35:28.520]  And I'm not saying highways are a bad idea.
[35:28.520 --> 35:36.520]  I'm just simply saying you might want to actually research how authoritarian all this is.
[35:36.520 --> 35:43.520]  Because when I get up here and I say, you know, the space shuttle was called the Silverbird and was being developed on paper by,
[35:43.520 --> 35:52.520]  who became the head of NASA later, to be a atomic bomber that would go up into orbit, turn over, open the space shuttle,
[35:52.520 --> 35:59.520]  open up its bays and drop atomic bombs on Manhattan, Detroit, and Chicago.
[35:59.520 --> 36:01.520]  And that was in its first path.
[36:01.520 --> 36:09.520]  It was then going to orbit the Earth, get into another angle to then bomb across the Midwest.
[36:09.520 --> 36:14.520]  And that's all the atomic bombs they thought they could load in it.
[36:14.520 --> 36:18.520]  You're like, wait a minute, the space shuttle, we invented that, that first flew in 1980 or whatever.
[36:18.520 --> 36:22.520]  No, my friends, we didn't invent the space shuttle, the Nazis did.
[36:22.520 --> 36:25.520]  And they were able to create atomic weapons.
[36:25.520 --> 36:32.520]  But we sent special forces in the British did into those mountains and blew them up on suicide missions.
[36:32.520 --> 36:35.520]  They had dozens of different types of jet aircraft.
[36:35.520 --> 36:37.520]  They had it all.
[36:37.520 --> 36:44.520]  And the point is, is we're not facing a Nazi conspiracy.
[36:44.520 --> 36:56.520]  There are powerful corporations and powerful individuals that will gobble up anything they can get that other evil people have come up with for evil aims.
[36:56.520 --> 36:58.520]  And so that's the reality.
[36:58.520 --> 37:04.520]  We took the space shuttle and used it to resupply the space station in 20% of its missions.
[37:04.520 --> 37:07.520]  80% were classified and were weapons payloads in space.
[37:07.520 --> 37:16.520]  That's what the space shuttle does is it takes huge weapons payloads, X-ray lasers, you name it, into orbit, and then places them.
[37:16.520 --> 37:18.520]  But I'm going to stop there.
[37:18.520 --> 37:20.520]  See, I have a problem with the show.
[37:20.520 --> 37:29.520]  I have massive preparation here, all this stuff I want to go over, all these things I want to talk about.
[37:29.520 --> 37:37.520]  But you see how you go down the little rabbit trail of Facebook is helping the EU at the request of Macron, who's really an EU minion,
[37:37.520 --> 37:43.520]  for this big internet tech conference, ban free speech basically, and ban live video.
[37:43.520 --> 37:44.520]  Look at this, though.
[37:44.520 --> 37:45.520]  That's my whole stack of censorship today.
[37:45.520 --> 37:50.520]  It's like China's social credit system, blacklist 13 million people so far.
[37:50.520 --> 37:55.520]  Google's censorship search would help China be more open.
[37:55.520 --> 38:05.520]  Since CEO of Google, he runs the parent company now, Alphabet, Eric Schmidt.
[38:05.520 --> 38:09.520]  That's two plus two equals 10, or being tortured to death is a great liberation.
[38:09.520 --> 38:11.520]  War is peace, freedom of slavery, lies are truth.
[38:11.520 --> 38:17.520]  Google's censored search would help China be more open, said ex CEO Eric Schmidt.
[38:17.520 --> 38:20.520]  Isn't that a funny, funny, funny, funny one?
[38:20.520 --> 38:25.520]  Online encyclopedia Wikipedia blocked in China ahead of Tiananmen anniversary.
[38:25.520 --> 38:29.520]  That's out of Reuters.
[38:29.520 --> 38:34.520]  Don't worry, they've locked up a right-wing comedian for making a gay joke.
[38:34.520 --> 38:40.520]  He's facing six months in prison, and the president thinks that's wrong, so they're calling him hateful.
[38:40.520 --> 38:41.520]  That's right.
[38:41.520 --> 38:43.520]  You know, this is what happens in other countries.
[38:43.520 --> 38:44.520]  Oh, under political correctness.
[38:44.520 --> 38:46.520]  Brazil's very politically correct.
[38:46.520 --> 38:49.520]  Oh my God, you made a gay joke.
[38:49.520 --> 38:50.520]  You're going to prison.
[38:50.520 --> 38:55.520]  Isn't that liberal?
[38:55.520 --> 38:56.520]  Wow.
[38:56.520 --> 38:59.520]  I mean, that's without even looking what's going on.
[38:59.520 --> 39:04.520]  It's everywhere.
[39:04.520 --> 39:09.520]  You know, I used to laugh at this, but now I'm figuring out the left has their fundraiser
[39:09.520 --> 39:13.520]  letters and their private communications and what goes on.
[39:13.520 --> 39:19.520]  But about three years ago, I started seeing it on Facebook and YouTube and Twitter everywhere,
[39:19.520 --> 39:23.520]  they'd say, Alex Jones is being sued by the Sandy Hook families.
[39:23.520 --> 39:27.520]  I hadn't been sued yet.
[39:27.520 --> 39:28.520]  And I remember, that's weird.
[39:28.520 --> 39:30.520]  That's not right.
[39:30.520 --> 39:32.520]  And then they did it.
[39:32.520 --> 39:37.520]  He just creates this thing of what you're supposed to, because the media and the left brings up things I
[39:37.520 --> 39:41.520]  never said in my voice and then tells people, did you hear what Alex is doing?
[39:41.520 --> 39:42.520]  Why?
[39:42.520 --> 39:45.520]  He paid for his college tuition for his kids on you.
[39:45.520 --> 39:47.520]  He made $80 billion off you.
[39:47.520 --> 39:48.520]  Why?
[39:48.520 --> 39:49.520]  He talks about you every day.
[39:49.520 --> 39:52.520]  None of that's even true.
[39:52.520 --> 39:57.520]  And now the new thing is, Alex Jones killed people.
[39:57.520 --> 39:59.520]  Alex Jones is a murderer.
[39:59.520 --> 40:01.520]  Alex Jones is in prison.
[40:01.520 --> 40:06.520]  And you've seen Millie Weaver and other videos on the street with Caitlin Benton and others
[40:06.520 --> 40:11.520]  and people walk up and they go, Alex Jones is in prison for murder.
[40:11.520 --> 40:16.520]  And we all kind of laugh and go, huh, but see, I guess in their weird group collective or
[40:16.520 --> 40:20.520]  however this thing works, I'm not sure.
[40:20.520 --> 40:23.520]  They think I'm in prison now.
[40:23.520 --> 40:28.520]  They said I was being sued by Sandy Hook before I was.
[40:28.520 --> 40:35.520]  And now they say I'm in prison for murdering people.
[40:35.520 --> 40:40.520]  People walk up on the street and they go, aren't you supposed to be in prison?
[40:40.520 --> 40:44.520]  These are crazy people.
[40:44.520 --> 40:47.520]  But they create whatever insane narrative they want.
[40:47.520 --> 40:49.520]  It's the death of logic.
[40:49.520 --> 40:52.520]  It's the death of civilization.
[40:52.520 --> 40:53.520]  It's completely out of control.
[40:53.520 --> 40:57.520]  But just let me control myself, okay?
[40:57.520 --> 40:59.520]  Because I've got to get to how we can break up big tech.
[40:59.520 --> 41:01.520]  And it's bigger than just me being censored.
[41:01.520 --> 41:04.520]  I don't care.
[41:04.520 --> 41:08.520]  On my knees, if we could just halfway turn the country around, I would stop and, you know,
[41:08.520 --> 41:12.520]  shut this operation down or let Owen run it or something, or Paul Watson if he was interested.
[41:12.520 --> 41:16.520]  You know, I mean, there's always something, you know, to do political.
[41:16.520 --> 41:19.520]  But this is existential threat to everything.
[41:19.520 --> 41:29.520]  We've got to really be politically engaged and informed now because facts are the enemy of our enemy.
[41:29.520 --> 41:39.520]  Now, I've been very impressed with what they're calling Trumpism 2.0.
[41:39.520 --> 41:44.520]  Senator Josh Hawley has unveiled populist platform to fight big tech aristocrats and restore America.
[41:44.520 --> 41:48.520]  And I watched hours of his speeches last night this morning.
[41:48.520 --> 41:54.520]  And he gave a speech to the Senate earlier that we're going to air excerpts of next hour.
[41:54.520 --> 41:58.520]  But when you hear these speeches, you're going to say, well, that sounds just like Alex Jones.
[41:58.520 --> 42:04.520]  No, folks, what it is is we're looking at the same thing in history.
[42:04.520 --> 42:07.520]  I'm quoting founding fathers. He's quoting founding fathers.
[42:07.520 --> 42:15.520]  He's quoting Senator Hawley, the same person that a big liberal is.
[42:15.520 --> 42:27.520]  Mark Zuckerberg's accomplice in founding Facebook has come out, Chris Hughes, and said exactly what the senators think.
[42:27.520 --> 42:31.520]  So this is the key when we come back.
[42:31.520 --> 42:39.520]  You have the founder of Facebook saying what the GOP rising star senators saying, because it's common sense.
[42:39.520 --> 42:43.520]  And you read this and you go, oh my God, that's exactly it.
[42:43.520 --> 42:49.520]  We have new royalty. What is royalty? What does it signify? What does it mean?
[42:49.520 --> 42:52.520]  Why did our forebearers reject it?
[42:52.520 --> 42:58.520]  It's all coming up. On the other side, infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[42:58.520 --> 43:04.520]  They've not shut down our speech. We're at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[43:04.520 --> 43:06.520]  And we're defeating the leftist tyrants.
[43:06.520 --> 43:10.520]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans that almost all of them said we used to love you on air.
[43:10.520 --> 43:13.520]  It was so good to see you on the iTunes or on YouTube.
[43:13.520 --> 43:18.520]  Are you coming back? We're at infowars.com. We're at newswars.com.
[43:18.520 --> 43:22.520]  Paul Watson's launched his own summit.news. We have our own videos. We have our own articles.
[43:22.520 --> 43:27.520]  They're trying to destroy us. But thanks to you and others having us on, infowars is still checking along.
[43:27.520 --> 43:29.520]  So we're there, folks, tomorrow's news today.
[43:29.520 --> 43:33.520]  Infowars.com!
[43:33.520 --> 43:35.520]  We're turning it on again.
[43:35.520 --> 43:38.520]  Infowars.com, because that's much people out here.
[43:38.520 --> 43:40.520]  I'm talking about infowars.com.
[43:40.520 --> 43:43.520]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[43:43.520 --> 43:45.520]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[43:45.520 --> 43:48.520]  We have our own video screens, our own audio screens, and it's all free to air.
[43:48.520 --> 43:51.520]  Anybody can use it. Reupload and do whatever you want.
[43:51.520 --> 43:54.520]  People go to infowars.com and newswars.com. That's where they find it.
[43:54.520 --> 43:56.520]  You know, there's things called websites.
[43:56.520 --> 44:16.520]  Just go there.
[44:26.520 --> 44:29.520]  It's the longest, most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there.
[44:29.520 --> 44:31.520]  Literally.
[44:31.520 --> 44:35.520]  Then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen,
[44:35.520 --> 44:42.520]  then you have the other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[44:42.520 --> 44:44.520]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.

[44:52.520 --> 44:59.520]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taken on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[44:59.520 --> 45:03.520]  Stacy in the great state of Texas.
[45:03.520 --> 45:07.520]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacy.
[45:07.520 --> 45:12.520]  It's a talk to you. Before I get into what I want to say, I just want to let you know that I don't normally take vitamins at all.
[45:12.520 --> 45:14.520]  I was turned on to the ultimate female force.
[45:14.520 --> 45:19.520]  I looked at all the ingredients and they're all organic, root, things like that that I trust.
[45:19.520 --> 45:24.520]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins. They don't have things that they say that they have in them.
[45:24.520 --> 45:26.520]  And they're often not things that are natural. I appreciate that.
[45:26.520 --> 45:28.520]  Well, what happened with ultimate female force? Tell us about it.
[45:28.520 --> 45:31.520]  Well, it's really great. You know, it's like a multivitamin. I take it. It tastes good.
[45:31.520 --> 45:35.520]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste. It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[45:35.520 --> 45:39.520]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[45:39.520 --> 45:43.520]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are. They're known to turbo-charge women.
[45:43.520 --> 45:45.520]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[45:45.520 --> 45:51.520]  So, yeah, stamina, libido, energy, these are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[45:51.520 --> 45:53.520]  So I'm glad you plugged it.
[45:53.520 --> 45:57.520]  InfowarsStore.com, or triple-A, 253-3139.

[46:32.520 --> 46:35.520]  And we decided, I liked Secret 12 Plus, but they said,
[46:35.520 --> 46:38.520]  Look, when you do Plus, people don't get that it means better and more.
[46:38.520 --> 46:41.520]  Just call it Ultra-12. Well, you know what? I don't like how the label's printed.
[46:41.520 --> 46:44.520]  And it just so happens, it already been labeled with the other. We decided to change the name.
[46:44.520 --> 46:50.520]  So when you peel off the label, underneath it, it's Secret 12 Plus.
[46:50.520 --> 46:53.520]  Twice as strong, 50% off right now.
[46:53.520 --> 47:21.520]  Better than Secret 12 ever was, InfowarsStore.com, now back in stock, it were four months sold out.
[47:21.520 --> 47:30.520]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:30.520 --> 47:39.520]  So, you know, end of World War II, the British and the U.S. sent now a lot of famous raids.
[47:39.520 --> 47:43.520]  For in some cases, everybody died. In other cases, nobody died.
[47:43.520 --> 47:48.520]  To go into the mountains, not of Germany. The Germans, just like in a Marvel comic movie,
[47:48.520 --> 47:53.520]  had all these underground bases in different nations around Germany in the Alps.
[47:53.520 --> 48:01.520]  And so, groups as small as 10 people, sometimes 100, would ski in 30, 40, 50, 100 miles with weapons.
[48:01.520 --> 48:06.520]  They'd go in with explosives. They'd sneak into these bases. They'd blow them up.
[48:06.520 --> 48:10.520]  They had atomic bombs. They had rockets. They had everything. They had missiles.
[48:10.520 --> 48:15.520]  That's why Hitler didn't win World War II. Came that close.
[48:15.520 --> 48:21.520]  They did all sorts of stuff like they'd get there and the train had already picked up the atomic fissile material.
[48:21.520 --> 48:24.520]  And so, they'd follow the train desperately and wait until it was loaded on a ship.
[48:24.520 --> 48:29.520]  Then they'd, you know, swim under the ship at night without even the gear and put a mine on it and sink it.
[48:29.520 --> 48:33.520]  I mean, just all sorts of stuff to stop Hitler from winning.
[48:33.520 --> 48:37.520]  And then you look at America today. We're trained to hate America.
[48:37.520 --> 48:41.520]  America sucks. The president's bad for even saying the country exists.
[48:41.520 --> 48:48.520]  Nation states are bad. And so, you wonder why Google and Apple moved to China.
[48:48.520 --> 48:52.520]  You wonder why they give all the secret codes to them.
[48:52.520 --> 49:03.520]  You wonder why the Clintons gave them all of the ICBM technology so they could launch the missiles, deliver the missiles, deliver their payrolls, the MIRV technology.
[49:03.520 --> 49:12.520]  Howard Stern thought that was so funny yesterday when, you know, they basically had word-for-word things I'd said about the Clintons selling out our MIRV technology.
[49:12.520 --> 49:21.520]  They were a little MIRV. It's a funny word, multiple reentry device.
[49:21.520 --> 49:28.520]  So instead of one hydrogen bomb in a nose cone, you can have 20.
[49:28.520 --> 49:35.520]  It's so funny that we gave our arch enemy something so one delivery system could vaporize 20 cities.
[49:35.520 --> 49:39.520]  Ha ha ha! Hey now! Hey now! Wonder how that'd feel.
[49:39.520 --> 49:44.520]  Again, this is the silliness of the public. No instinct to protect themselves.
[49:44.520 --> 49:48.520]  No instinct for territorialism. No instinct for anything.
[49:48.520 --> 49:54.520]  All that crazy Alex Jones is, you know, mad that Google and Apple moved to China and, you know, gave them all our secrets.
[49:54.520 --> 49:58.520]  And he's upset that they got their 5G coming in, spying on everything.
[49:58.520 --> 50:04.520]  And, you know, that guy is just a crazy old man over there, you know.
[50:04.520 --> 50:08.520]  I guess I'm kind of a crazy bet on America then, huh?
[50:08.520 --> 50:11.520]  Oh, everybody's out for everybody. No, they're not.
[50:11.520 --> 50:23.520]  The Chai comms would kill anybody in their population did stuff like this in one second because they're in it for themselves and their dirty Communist Party.
[50:23.520 --> 50:34.520]  And that's the thing. Trump is at least trying to stick up for us like we have any type of will.
[50:34.520 --> 50:39.520]  Instead, we act like a bunch of wimps, a bunch of chumps, a bunch of idiots.
[50:39.520 --> 50:50.520]  And then you see the culture of Hollywood deliberately funded by foreign governments and others putting out propaganda that is illegal.
[50:50.520 --> 50:54.520]  China doesn't let 95% of what we produce into their country.
[50:54.520 --> 51:00.520]  They call it demoralization. They call it cultural death. They know they're financing it.
[51:00.520 --> 51:12.520]  I'm going to tell you again, we had a representative at Sundance this year to go investigate.
[51:12.520 --> 51:24.520]  And they openly said demoralization, panic, darkness, we want people depressed.
[51:24.520 --> 51:28.520]  Now think about that. And of course they have a show about girls committing suicide, record suicide.
[51:28.520 --> 51:32.520]  They want your daughters to tie a string around their neck and kill themselves.
[51:32.520 --> 51:38.520]  They want to murder you. Hollywood wants to kill you, okay?
[51:38.520 --> 51:43.520]  They don't want to sell you tickets. They want you to kill your baby. They want you to take a bunch of drugs.
[51:43.520 --> 51:50.520]  They want you to commit suicide. They want your soul. That's not how verbally.
[51:50.520 --> 51:55.520]  Twenty years ago, when they offered me some movies, I thought it was cute.
[51:55.520 --> 52:00.520]  Ten years ago, you couldn't pay me any amount of money to be in movies now.
[52:00.520 --> 52:06.520]  Even if they quote, say it's going to be a positive message, it's always going to get twisted unless it's an independent documentary.
[52:06.520 --> 52:13.520]  It's religious. You don't just not care about Hollywood. You need to want to throw up.
[52:13.520 --> 52:17.520]  Hollywood is empty, soulless beyond anything you can imagine.
[52:17.520 --> 52:22.520]  The people, you think as you go up the Hollywood chain, you finally find oxygen.
[52:22.520 --> 52:26.520]  No, no, no, no. It gets worse.
[52:26.520 --> 52:31.520]  And so all these people go there thinking they're going to find themselves.
[52:31.520 --> 52:37.520]  And all they find is emptiness and they commit suicide.
[52:37.520 --> 52:45.520]  Hollywood is venom out of a spider's fangs or out of a snake's fangs.
[52:45.520 --> 52:51.520]  It's doing what it's supposed to do. It's targeting you. It's targeting your children.
[52:51.520 --> 53:03.520]  More than half of it is financed by the most murderous government of bloodthirsty chai comms the planet has ever seen in red China.
[53:03.520 --> 53:09.520]  And I know you know this, but listen, revel in your rejection of Hollywood,
[53:09.520 --> 53:15.520]  revel in it and teach your children that and they will know.
[53:15.520 --> 53:18.520]  That's the enemy. That's the scum. That's the filth.
[53:18.520 --> 53:23.520]  That wants you to fail. Say no to it and reject it.
[53:23.520 --> 53:28.520]  And that's why all the comedians tell you how much you suck because you're white,
[53:28.520 --> 53:34.520]  or bad you are because you live in Arkansas, or how much you suck because you live in Illinois,
[53:34.520 --> 53:39.520]  or bad you are because you're in upstate New York, or how stupid you are because you're a farmer,
[53:39.520 --> 53:47.520]  or how what a loser you are. You're an auto mechanic. You're not some cool Hollywood method.
[53:47.520 --> 53:51.520]  All that matters is your soul. And I know you know that.
[53:51.520 --> 53:59.520]  And they're so pissed that they're losing control of us and they want our kids so bad and they want to destroy everybody so bad
[53:59.520 --> 54:04.520]  and they want us all fight with each other and they try to say we're all racist so we fight with each other.
[54:04.520 --> 54:12.520]  That's so evil. And then you realize they have no bottom and they're doing it on purpose
[54:12.520 --> 54:20.520]  and they're maneuvering us into this collapse to control us and they're not going to get away with it.
[54:20.520 --> 54:24.520]  But of course they teach in schools America sucks. Of course they're demoralizing you.
[54:24.520 --> 54:30.520]  Of course they want you to think you're pathetic and have no value because they want to direct you and lead your life.
[54:30.520 --> 54:35.520]  You see the Facebook internal marketing. It's about keeping you desperate, keeping you scared.
[54:35.520 --> 54:44.520]  They hired thousands of psychiatrists and top psychologists to mess with their algorithm to make you as pathetic and sad and alone as they can.
[54:44.520 --> 54:51.520]  You know what our marketing area is? We're in this together. We love you. We want to be empowered. We want you empowered.
[54:51.520 --> 54:57.520]  Let's win this together. There is no marketing. It's all just straight up truth.
[54:57.520 --> 55:05.520]  So you've got Solas Hollywood and Solas Big Tech thinking if they can eat us, if they can absorb us, they'll finally be a real boy.
[55:05.520 --> 55:09.520]  Well, guess what? Your system's dead on arrival.
[55:09.520 --> 55:12.520]  When we come back, I'm going to get to the senator's speech. It's very powerful.
[55:12.520 --> 55:16.520]  I'm going to get to the antitrust systems that can break up the globalist. Now we can do it.
[55:16.520 --> 55:19.520]  I'm going to get to it all next hour briefly because this hour is almost over.
[55:19.520 --> 55:34.520]  I always wait till the end here. But frankly, if folks don't support us, it's like not locking your door at night or not brushing your teeth or wiping your ass.
[55:34.520 --> 55:45.520]  And I appreciate everybody. And I'm not saying, hey, you better get in here and support us, but ladies and gentlemen, our supporters and our guests and our crew, what this is,
[55:45.520 --> 55:53.520]  detonated the Second American Revolution worldwide and the enemy recognizes we are to be destroyed.
[55:53.520 --> 55:59.520]  But the enemy is getting weaker and weaker. But they can focus their firepower on who they see as the leaders.
[55:59.520 --> 56:05.520]  They believe they take us down. They have a chance of winning, which is true in the short term.
[56:05.520 --> 56:09.520]  They're going to lose long term no matter what. But I have a little bit of self-preservation in this.
[56:09.520 --> 56:16.520]  I just want to lose to these people because they see me being destroyed as a victory, too.
[56:16.520 --> 56:23.520]  So hold me up if you can. Thanks for putting up with me. I know I'm not perfect, but it takes a firebrand to kind of detonate this.
[56:23.520 --> 56:28.520]  And we're just a focal point, but we make it very easy at infowarstore.com.

[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:12.520]  All right, I've kind of gotten wound up and hyped up earlier and I got a ton of news I got to get to and a special guest joining us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:17.520]  The 14 year old is taking the internet by storm that they're trying to ban right now.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:24.520]  I want to get to the senator's powerful speech when we come back, but here's Mark Dice knocking out of the park as usual.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:36.520]  As you know, many schools have become safe spaces instead of actually teaching the kids history, math and science and instead provide them with an environment to invent new genders and find new things to be offended by.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:49.520]  And now an Ohio high school has taken safe spaces to a whole new level and will not be awarding students with the honor of valedictorian or salutatorian because it's going to hurt the other student's feelings because they didn't do as good.
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:59.520]  New at 11, 1st or 2nd in class, no more. Mason City Schools is getting rid of valedictorian and salutatorian honors, honors that is, all to help students mental health.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:06.520]  900 sides, Jake Ryle joins us live right now from Mason High School with reaction from parents and students. What are they saying, Jake?
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:15.520]  I'll take it from here, guys. This is something you would expect to see on a parody news website like The Onion, but this is a real broadcast about a real school and they're really doing this.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:22.520]  What planet are we living on when a school has decided that giving the valedictorian salutatorian awards is going to hurt the feelings of the other students?
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:37.520]  The school's principal said, quote, this will help reduce the overall competitive culture at Mason High School to allow students to focus on exploring learning opportunities that are of interest to them, reduce the competitive culture.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.520]  Because we wouldn't want the kids to work hard and try to achieve something in their lives, now wouldn't we?
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:49.520]  Well, I guess it makes sense because if the Democrats get back into power, these kids won't even name jobs, they'll just live off of our tax dollars.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:59.520]  Business Insider reports that the school is doing away with valedictorians to make mental health a priority, and experts think it's a game-changing policy. What experts?
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:04.520]  I guess we're at the point where telling your kid to work hard and do good in school is bullying them.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:18.520]  Speaking of a kid who has been working hard, this is 14-year-old Sophia, who goes by the name of SOF on YouTube, who has over 800,000 subscribers, and she rails against political correctness and the social justice warriors.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:24.520]  Remember when YouTube used to be about the little guy being able to reach a large audience? Well, that's not very caring.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:28.520]  That's why we completely changed the algorithm, without telling you!
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:35.520]  Now the only way you can get on the trending tab is if you're already famous, rendering the whole thing ultimately pointless.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:48.520]  BuzzFeed's feelings got hurt by her style of comedy, particularly after she posted this video, making fun of Muslims, which, as you know, you're not allowed to do anymore, and so they're calling for her to be banned from YouTube.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:03:00.520]  YouTube's newest foooorright foulmouth Red Billing Star is a 14-year-old girl. SOF has nearly a million followers on the giant video platform. The site's executives only have themselves to blame.
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:08.520]  And it looks like YouTube is getting ready to take her down, because shortly after BuzzFeed's article, her channel received not one, but two strikes.
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:23.520]  One, according to her Twitter feed from a previous video, which had got a strike, then she appealed, then it was restored, now that video got a strike again, and then a different video of her pretending to be a communist, making fun of commies, also got struck.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:29.520]  Now she does have a very foul mouth. What teenager does it when they're away from their parents and trying to push people's buttons?
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:36.520]  But she is very talented, and I think that we should all stand up against this censorship and get her to a million subscribers today.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:49.520]  The world is gone mad. So mad that Taylor University, a Christian university in Mike Pence's home state of Indiana, invited him to give the commencement speech, and so some of the students are upset about it.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:57.520]  Students at alumni are outraged and shaking. Of course, they're shaking after Vice President Pence invited to give the commencement address.
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:04.520]  Here's a little advice, kids. If you're not a Christian and you don't like Christians, maybe you shouldn't go to a Christian university.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.520]  Students at a Christian university are upset that Mike Pence is giving the commencement address. I mean, what's next?
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:17.520]  Is Sports Illustrated gonna feature a 300-pound beach whale in the swimsuit edition? Oh, wait, what's this? Oh, come on!
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:25.520]  This is not a joke, and I'm sorry that I have to keep saying that it's not a joke, but it's not a joke, but I really want you guys to understand that they're really doing this.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:37.520]  Listen, Sports Illustrated, if guys wanted to see a 300-pound woman wearing skin-tight clothes, they could go to Walmart any night of the week, yet didn't have to put one in the swimsuit edition in the name of social justice.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:45.520]  Okay, that's about all the liberals that Mike could take for a day, but be sure to subscribe to Solve's channel to get her to a million subscribers.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:56.520]  And she's almost there, and she's joining us at the bottom of the hour. But straight ahead, the Pentagon, Congress, the American people finally know big text the enemy.
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:25.520]  It's a free toothpaste that every info warrior loves. Powered by iodine and nano-silver, it's designed to deliver a powerful clean while supporting good oral health and fresh breath.

[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:46.520]  If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any necessity of life.
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:07:07.520]  That is Senator John Sherman, Republican of Ohio, in 1890 with the Sherman Antitrust Act, the first of those acts to not let the railroads and the big combines act and behave like God and engage in all sorts of cartel activity.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:24.520]  Because it's not just monopolies over certain things, it's monopolies working together to combine into a cartel and then you get Venezuela. That's what this is all about.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:35.520]  And I was quoting from the Big New York Times article of May 8th last week. It's time to break up Facebook from the co-founder Chris Hughes.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:43.520]  Now, he says government has to get involved and he gives some leftist, you know, drivel reasons, but there's some good points in here as well.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.520]  I believe he wrote this article from a good place.
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:57.520]  But you've got all these Republican so-called libertarian think tanks that since the 70s have convinced us, you don't do anything to corporations.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:12.520]  Now, when corporations are bigger than governments, and corporations control the communications systems and have monopolies, and then they start watching in real time and controlling what you're doing, that's authoritarianism.
[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:19.520]  And they've got consent rulings against them. They've lost lawsuits. They're supposed to Facebook, Google. All of them were supposed to quit this a decade ago.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:25.520]  They didn't quit. They got worse. And they've budgeted in the billion dollar, the five billion dollar fines they pay.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:31.520]  That's nothing when you're making hundreds of billions of dollars a year.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.520]  And so now this is the key to everything.
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:54.520]  As the senator in his first big Senate floor speech since he got in in November, Josh Hawley of the Show Me State, former prosecutor there, who I'm very impressed by on his bill to not kill babies after they're born, Democrats voted it down, showed who they are.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:04.520]  And his moves against Google years ago for antitrust only state to go after Google. I mean, the guy's hitting on all cylinders.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:17.520]  And he lays this out in larger papers and articles that the new aristocrats, the new royalty is Google, is Facebook, is Twitter.
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:25.520]  And what does royalty mean? It means you're above the law. It's arbitrary. You do whatever you want.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:33.520]  And you can hand down power to whoever you want. You've got hereditary royalty. You've got hereditary dictatorships like North Korea.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:40.520]  But you've also got forms of royalty that are more like oligarchies where it's clubs and groups with the bureaucrats hand down power.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:49.520]  Oh, we don't care. Trump not elected. We're bureaucrats. We'll have an insurance policy. We'll remove him from office. We are entitled to run America.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:10:01.520]  You know, I was just in a Walmart rote, struck the page. I could smell the Trump support. We're not going to let these people win.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:15.520]  It's an arrogance. It's a hubris. It's a royalty. How dare you? You're not going to do that. We're going to tell you what to do.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:32.520]  And so he explains that the lie is the, not grassroots libertarianism that I like, that's constitutional, but the institutional system of law is a fair where these companies should do whatever they want,
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:40.520]  be tax exempt, be above the law, tell us what to do, oppress us, lie to Congress.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:49.520]  They've had that position since big tech started 50 years ago, and it's all coming to an end. I'm not just saying that confidently. You can see it.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:56.520]  And they're just arrogantly trying to just keep chugging along. And we've seen the major signs of this.
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:10.520]  Again, a year ago, head of Google said, I will not come. And we're not going to work with the Pentagon. F you, you're weak. You're stupid. Then they started to show their fangs a little bit. Congress started to stop acting like a bunch of idiots.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:21.520]  And we're sorry Google came in love. You see, stop acting like Wimps America. Stop being bullied by corporate media. So here's the senator's powerful speech on the floor just hours ago.
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:27.520]  Josh Hawley, here it is. General Bart, I commend your candor in calling what happened in 2016.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:33.520]  Hey, guys, it's not a big deal. This kind of thing happens. The Trump campaign and spying on the president of the United States.
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:40.520]  I'd like to talk a little bit more about spying counterintelligence. Fun thing about live TV. Shut it off. Just shut it off.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:48.520]  I'm not mad. I love this. I think this is fun. I think this is cool. I think this is great because we have a big guest coming up live later on here.
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:58.520]  I'm going to try this again like I did before the show and like I did just now because I entered this time vortex today on a bunch of clips of the senator.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:05.520]  He was live two hours ago on the Senate floor with a speech he gave. So we'll just produce on air now.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:12.520]  What you do off air and you're in breaks or before the show, which is great. It's fine. I just want to get a Roger Roger.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:19.520]  I'm just keep producing on air as long as it takes that we do have the clip right of him on the Senate floor earlier.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:30.520]  No response. Which is fine. Which is the only thing that frustrates me is the response. So we we're going to have that for you later today.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:37.520]  I promise you. OK, we're going to have that for you. Not not a clip from two weeks ago. So and I'm not mad about it.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:42.520]  To me, it's just that, you know, they're not knowing, you know what I mean?
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:56.520]  And then it just the like molasses, it just it just pours out into the universe and just kind of runs over the stairs and then just glides over the next thing on to the next.
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:16.520]  Here's the good part. America and the world is waking up to the fact that we have governments and we have systems that are acting and operating.
[01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:26.520]  Like they're above the law. Gods and Americans are right. Government was getting too big in the 60s and 70s with too many regulations.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:31.520]  And so, oh, let's leave companies alone. But that doesn't mean we set up companies like world governments.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:37.520]  Because those very companies will lobby government to set up regulations to shut you down.
[01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:49.520]  Most of the big regulations being called for are by the big Fortune 100. Because they're using that to control everyone.
[01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:57.520]  They're using that to fix the markets. And man, you try to start a new website or a new social network.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:07.520]  They got their SPLC and media groups harassing you, lying about you, finding scanning or servers to find out who hosts you, so they kick you off and you get a note.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:17.520]  Sorry, you're a Nazi. You're off and you're not a Nazi. It's all defamation, but it's big, powerful, trillion dollar companies that work with horrible authoritarian regimes.
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:24.520]  And they've gotten away with it forever.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:33.520]  They've gotten away with it forever. And so now they think they can do anything. This isn't about free speech. That's just one part of it.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:41.520]  This is about out of control groups that fundamentally don't like the free market system and don't even like the human community.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:53.520]  And they're so in love with their tech and their screens and their data that they are divorced from humanity and believe that they need to transcend us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:59.520]  And that's it. And that's what this has come down to.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:05.520]  And I know you know that, but I could sit here with hundreds of articles that are interesting, that are informative.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:21.520]  But I just keep harping on the big picture because the enemy wants us off the air because of that, because the decisions are being made right now about all of this.
[01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:32.520]  That's what's happening. And you cannot quantify how big a deal this is.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:40.520]  You cannot underestimate the fact that this is central because if you can't communicate with people and if they can surveil everything you're doing and use it against you,
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:47.520]  and they're saying families are bad and we're going to take your kids away from you and we're going to forcibly inoculate you, these are bad people.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:56.520]  They believe you're weak. They believe you're over. They believe they're going to beat you. I believe you're not. I'm betting on myself. I'm betting on you. Stay with us.
[01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:21.520]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:30.520]  Stocks and options are dependent. Simply text HOT to 48542 and I'll text it to you instantly. How do I know this stock is so hot?
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:39.520]  Well, I'm a former CBOE market maker for Amazon Options, former vice president of Goldman Sachs, and I have over 25 years of professional trading experience.
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:45.520]  I'm telling you this stock is hot, but be warned. The stock may move soon, so you need to claim it before it does.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:17:05.520]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me. You don't know me and will never meet. I had a problem like you once.
[01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:17.520]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:25.520]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone, you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:37.520]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life. And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:58.520]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse. Get clean. Call now and learn more.
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:16.520]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:26.520]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:55.520]  Warning though, it's very, very strong. It lasts 10 hours. So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turboforce is named Turboforce because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:58.520]  This is Turboforce and M4sLive.com
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:31.520]  It's one thing you take. It should be DNA Force Plus with PQQ, CoQ10 and so much more.

[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:47.520]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Alex Jones here, broadcasting live on this May 15, 2019 worldwide show.
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:21:03.520]  Coming up, we have the young lady that the corporate press, the assassins of troops that had a heart attack over, they want her off air and they want her off air now because she's gotten 800,000, a million subscribers in a few months.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:13.520]  She's reached hundreds of millions of people and she's making fun of the left and you don't do that. Everything's a big safe space and you don't make fun of Islam when they kill people either.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:18.520]  You accept it and you submit to it. So she's coming up next segment.
[01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:24.520]  But now let's go ahead and air a large excerpt of what I was telling you about earlier and the articles up on infowars.com.
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:27.520]  We'll post this speech to infowars.com the next hour.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:41.520]  Trumpism 2.0, Senator Josh Hawley unveils populist platform to fight big tech aristocrats and restore America. Here it is.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.520]  Because to represent them will be a great responsibility indeed.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:52.520]  I pledge to my fellow Missourians that I will work at this task with all the strength that God can give me.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:57.520]  And I will serve without fear and without favor to any man.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:22:07.520]  We Missourians are known for our frankness and today I will be frank because this is a moment of great need for my state and for our nation.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:19.520]  For this nation was born in a revolution by we the people and premised on a revolutionary faith that it is the people, the common man and woman who make democracy work.
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:25.520]  And it is the calling of every generation to renew that revolution for their day.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:35.520]  But in our time our revolutionary faith is faltering and in the heartland of this country the great challenge of our age is unfolding.
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:42.520]  I come from a town called Lexington, Missouri. It's a small place but a proud one.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:47.520]  It's a place where people wake early and work late to make a life for themselves and their children.
[01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:53.520]  It's a place where people value honesty and gumption and life's simple pleasures.
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:23:00.520]  Find morning at a deer stand, reading to the kids before bed, Sunday dinner at mom's.
[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:08.520]  And though it is humble, it's a place that reflects the dignity and quiet greatness of the working men and women.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:14.520]  These are the people who explored a continent, who built the railroads, who opened the west.
[01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:22.520]  These are the workers whose labor launched the industrial revolution and whose ingenuity made the American economy the marvel of the world.
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:30.520]  These are the families who have rallied to this country's flag in every hour of danger and who bear the burden of defending our nation even now.
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:35.520]  These are the patriots who manned the fire department and coached the Little League.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:47.520]  These are the generous who give $25 a month out of their gas money to assist people halfway around the globe they will never meet just because they believe in helping others.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:57.520]  They don't ask for much and they live by a simple creed. Give the best of yourself to your family, your community and your fellow man.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:04.520]  And America is a place of promise because in these hearts honor lives.
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:11.520]  But these working men and women are confronting crisis today and as they do, so does our democracy.
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:20.520]  After years of sacrifice, the great American middle is being pushed aside by a new arrogant aristocracy.
[01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:33.520]  The new aristocrats seek to remake society in their own image, to engineer an economy that works for the elite but few else, to fashion a culture that is dominated by their own preferences.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:40.520]  When they think of helping their fellow citizens, they think of making everyone else more like themselves.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:44.520]  In Washington, now Washington has just gone along.
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:54.520]  This town has embraced a politics of elite values and elite ambition rather than building opportunities to thrive in the great and broad American middle.
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:08.520]  This has left middle America, the great American middle class, under siege, battling the loss of respect and work, the decline of home and family, an epidemic of loneliness and despair.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.520]  This is the crisis of our time.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:16.520]  I'm afraid you wouldn't know it to listen to the talk of this town much of the time.
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:26.520]  As the crisis deepens, the political establishment looks the other way, rehearsing and rehashing the political debates of 30 or 40 years ago.
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:34.520]  But there is no time for that any longer. The 21st century is upon us and the great struggle of this century can no longer wait.
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:38.520]  The crisis that we face goes to the heart of our revolution.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:46.520]  The United States is unique in history as a republic governed not by a select elite, but by the working man and woman.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:52.520]  Because we believe it is through the working man and woman that God chooses to change the world.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:26:03.520]  And that change comes not through spectacular feats of daring or glory, but through everyday work and everyday sacrifice and everyday acts of courage and love.
[01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:12.520]  And so it has been the proud working people, our farmers and mechanics and teachers and tradesmen who have defined the character of this country.
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:19.520]  But for too long now, neither our economy nor our culture has lent them much support.
[01:26:19.520 --> 01:26:27.520]  Instead, our policymakers have entrenched the new elites and undermined the way of life that once bound this country together.
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:36.520]  It's time to face the facts. Over the last 40 years, our economy has worked best for those at the top, the wealthy, the well educated.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:43.520]  If you have a job in Silicon Valley or an expensive and prestigious degree, this economy has worked for you.
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.520]  And Washington has focused on how to get more people to join this elite.
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:53.520]  But if you want a life built around the place where you grew up, if your ambition is not to start a tech business,
[01:26:53.520 --> 01:27:01.520]  but to join the family business, to serve in the PTA or in your local church, well, you're told that you're not a success.
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.520]  And you're told that you're on your own. This is no accident.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:14.520]  The people who make the rules now, who run our large corporations, who set the tone for our popular culture, all belong to the same class.
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:18.520]  This economy has been their economy. They made it for themselves.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:28.520]  But in places like the one where I grew up in Middle Missouri, good-paying jobs that you can raise a family on are going away.
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:35.520]  The jobs go overseas or south of the border or to cities on the coast, and once vibrant towns decline,
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:43.520]  taking with them the network of schools and neighborhoods and churches that make up middle-class life.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:49.520]  Rural America has been particularly hardhead. Rural Americans' life expectancy has not just leveled off.
[01:27:49.520 --> 01:27:56.520]  It's actually dropped. And for women without a high school degree, that drop has been staggering.
[01:27:56.520 --> 01:28:01.520]  In some rural places, residents struggle without right deprivation.
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:09.520]  My home state contains some of the poorest counties in America, all in rural places that once boasted thriving small towns.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:13.520]  All right, folks, and we have an HD version of this. This is from the live stream.
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:18.520]  I'm going to post the full HD from his office up on infowars.com.
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:21.520]  And when we put it in post, I'm going to air the whole thing.
[01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:25.520]  In fact, later in the broadcast, I'm going to air the rest of it because he lists the problems,
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:30.520]  but then he goes for the solution, which is a real Americana populist movement,
[01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:36.520]  anti-globalist that attacks the monopolies that have really set up hard deindustrialization.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:41.520]  So he goes even beyond Trump, and I'm 100% on board.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.520]  This is exciting, and this is where we need to go, and he wants to break up big tech now.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:50.520]  He's got a plan to do it within six months, and he's got the presidents here.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:54.520]  That's right, folks. The cavalry's coming. We're going to win.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:29:07.520]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:30.520]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[01:29:30.520 --> 01:29:37.520]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally at heart and body extract?
[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:40.520]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:45.520]  Don't just take my word for it. Check out all of the success stories at hbextract.com
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:54.520]  or to order call 866-295-5305. That's 866-295-5305, hbextract.com
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:57.520]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:03.520]  The globalists are hyper-competitive scientific dictators. They are technocrats.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:07.520]  They are control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:12.520]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:16.520]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace. We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension.
[01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:23.520]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.520]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:33.520]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality,
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:38.520]  and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:44.520]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over-the-counter that you're going to find anywhere.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:50.520]  It is amazing. Experience pure, Methicobalamin B12 for yourself, and fund the second American Revolution
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:57.520]  against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.520]  Mike in New Jersey. You're on the air. Thanks for calling, Mike.
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:07.520]  You are the man, Alex. I'm so glad to be talking to you. I'm so excited. I'm such a big fan.
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:12.520]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products. I got to do a shout out for The Bone Broth.
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:17.520]  The Bone Broth. The Bone Broth. The Bone Broth. The Bone Broth. The Bone Broth.
[01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:22.520]  Tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:28.520]  It tastes like Ovaltine. It tastes like Ovaltine. It tastes like Ovaltine. Like, good.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:34.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:38.520]  Um, I've used the, uh, SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products.
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:40.520]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:43.520]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air. I'm thanking you.
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:49.520]  But yes, this is the ultimate Bone Broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom, the true Bone Broth.
[01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:52.520]  It is next level. It really is good. So thank you.
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:55.520]  I feel great since I've been taking it. Thank you.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:32:03.520]  INFOWAR, the most banned network in the world.
[01:32:03.520 --> 01:32:09.520]  Tom and Texas police officer on the border talks about MS-13 and more. Thanks for calling, Tom.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:13.520]  Yes, sir. Thank you for taking my call. Just want to thank you for your products.
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:16.520]  I have, uh, InfoWars decals on outside of my cell phone case.
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:20.520]  My truck, sports shirts, all the equipment. I find it's the best way to get your word out.
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.520]  God bless you, brother.
[01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:25.520]  And I have three or four InfoWars bumper stickers in my glove box right now.
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:28.520]  I hand out if I get to talking to somebody just to help spread that word.
[01:32:28.520 --> 01:32:31.520]  You're our only hope, brother. I'm telling you, you're more important than I am.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:33:00.520]  It's people like you on the ground as you know that's boots on the ground.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:09.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:34.520]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:50.520]  Well, I'm really glad that the crew and our lead producer, Daria, got this guest on.
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:56.520]  I had seen her work before. Very, very witty, very, very smart.
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:33:59.520]  A little bit of foul mouth-ness to it.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:09.520]  And, you know, for those of us that don't use a lot of foul language, just in regular repertoire of our verbal lexicon,
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:13.520]  you can kind of look down on that. But I can certainly cuss like a sailor as well.
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:21.520]  But when you're talking to general audiences today, there's a reason that President Trump has thrown a few cuss words in in speeches.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:26.520]  It's because for some of the people out there, that's the only way you're able to reach them now.
[01:34:26.520 --> 01:34:28.520]  There has been such a dumbing down.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:35.520]  Her humor is very witty, very smart, and getting a chance to talk to her folks and, you know, see her work.
[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:38.520]  She's really coming up with 90% of this on her own.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:43.520]  I think her parents are obviously smart patriots, and they're adding a few points, but she's extremely witty.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:49.520]  In fact, I've got a 14-year-old daughter that I could say is just as smart, but she's not really political.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:54.520]  She just supports me. She knows I'm right. She's very well informed. She just doesn't really care.
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.520]  Most of her friends are listeners. She's got friends all over town at other high schools.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:05.520]  And I literally go to these girls' houses at pool parties and start to pick her up.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:10.520]  And it's like 20 girls, and half of them are wearing Trump and infill war shirts.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:17.520]  And that's not just in wealthy parts of town. I'll go out to some thing and party to pick her up at Dripping Springs at some birthday party.
[01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.520]  And, you know, it's a blue collar, folks, and they're all listeners.
[01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:25.520]  So, and again, it's not just Alex Jones here. I'm not bragging. Oh, I got a bunch of listeners and young people.
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:37.520]  It's the exciting news that Stephen Crowder is popular in Paul Watson, but what really scares them is somebody like this young lady coming along.
[01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.520]  S-O-P-H.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:49.520]  Soph, formerly known as Lieutenant Corbis, is a 14-year-old YouTube personality that has been recently dog piled for expressing right-wing views on her channel.
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:52.520]  Her channel's gotten close to a million subscribers and is growing.
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:59.520]  Her latest video, Be Not Afraid, where she criticized Islam and the modern left censorship tactics that we're going to play after she leaves us,
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:08.520]  has been taken down for alleged hate speech, which is any nebulous term the left wants to invent, along with a couple of her other videos.
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:12.520]  She's had two strikes. She's on the verge of being taken down.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:18.520]  So you can have imams on there saying, your women are ours. Christ is a pig. We are taking over.
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:23.520]  You can have all that up there, but you can't criticize Islam.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:25.520]  Here are the headlines, the breathless headlines.
[01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:31.520]  YouTube's newest, far-right, foul-mouthed, red-pilling star is a 14-year-old girl.
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:35.520]  And then they blur her face out like she shouldn't be on air.
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:41.520]  Oh, but Desmond can be six years old when he first started dancing at gay bars and talking about taking ketamine.
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:48.520]  Little boys can have men put money in their G-strings, but little girls can't say they don't want to put a burqa on.
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:52.520]  Pottymouth. Oh, suddenly the left is so concerned.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.520]  Pottymouth. Oh, look, a girl we didn't abort.
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:57.520]  Oh, oh, she's short.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:04.520]  Pottymouth 14-year-old anti-PC YouTuber comes under fire, Daily Mail.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:11.520]  Profane 14-year-old YouTuber spreads hate and far-right conspiracy theories. You mean questioning them.
[01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:14.520]  How social networks are recruiting teenage extremists?
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.520]  Oh, my gosh, the verge.
[01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:22.520]  Buzzfeed, the outraged mob hound this young lady. That's our team.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:28.520]  So she joins us live, unfiltered to talk with us.
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:32.520]  And so thank you very much for coming on and tell us a little bit about yourself.
[01:37:32.520 --> 01:37:35.520]  The fact that they're trying to de-platform you, trying to unperson you.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:39.520]  Wow, at 14, that's quite an accolade to have the thought police after you.
[01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:44.520]  Yeah, thanks. Thanks for having me on, Alex. I really love your program. I love what you do.
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:49.520]  It's awesome. And I'd like to say that you are indeed, in fact, popular among Gen Z.
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:55.520]  They know who you are. You can say the quotes that have been memed, and they'll know that it's Alex Jones.
[01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:58.520]  And I think it is really crazy that they're coming after me so hard.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:04.520]  They're putting me in this box of far right, even though I'm not even grown up yet, and I'm anti-political.
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:10.520]  And I think it's really crazy. I think, though, it's a good sign that this is really throwing them for a loop
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:16.520]  and that it's a good defense against the thought police, because you see a 14-year-old saying the things that I say,
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:21.520]  and they don't know how to handle it. You write an article about her, it just makes her even more famous,
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:25.520]  and it makes you seem like you're smearing a 14-year-old, and it's really hard for them to kill me after me.
[01:38:25.520 --> 01:38:30.520]  And I think it's a... And I would also like to thank BuzzFeed, because I've gained like 100,000 subscribers
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:36.520]  over the past 24 hours because of them. So it really backfired on them.
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:44.520]  Well, well, you're right. I mean, it's backfired for now, but they...
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:47.520]  Last time I heard, correct me if I'm wrong, you're the expert on this.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.520]  Tell us about the censorship you've gone through, the censored videos that have been taken down.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:55.520]  There's two strikes, right? So you've got one more right now?
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:01.520]  Yeah. So I don't even know how many strikes. It's kind of a convoluted system.
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:07.520]  Somehow they're like grouping in a lot of videos into one strike, and they're getting me for hate speech
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:12.520]  and cyberbullying and harassment. And I think I'm one away from my channel being terminated, which is scary,
[01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:17.520]  but I don't think it's a reason to back down, and I won't change my content because of it,
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:22.520]  because YouTube is really a stepping stone. It's not something that's going to be around for much longer
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:25.520]  because people are just getting sick of being censored.
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:32.520]  And I really hope that events like these are ones where controversial anti-PC YouTubers can sort of unionize
[01:39:32.520 --> 01:39:36.520]  and move over to or start a new platform.
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:41.520]  Well, that's right. As they squeeze, it just pushes people out and we're going to create new platforms.
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:44.520]  But the time being, you've got to be careful. Your parents got to be careful.
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:48.520]  And obviously, you're running the show. You're very smart.
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:52.520]  Once they take you down, though, then they'll be able to lie about you.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:57.520]  So I would create a backup channel for somebody else you work with where you also post your material
[01:39:57.520 --> 01:40:00.520]  so that you'll be able to have a voice and kind of leapfrog as long as you can,
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:09.520]  because once they take your scalp, you know, they kind of, I guess, like golem, they turn you into a slave of theirs.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:13.520]  They create a straw man and steal your identity. So that's the next level of this.
[01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:17.520]  I think, I mean, as you said, these strikes are fake. Some of the strikes have been pulled back,
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:25.520]  but they're in there a bunch of bully SJWs piling on a 14-year-old young lady.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:29.520]  And you don't look like even that physically big, but your brain is big.
[01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:34.520]  And I guess that's got to be very threatening for them all ganging up on a girl.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:41.520]  I mean, yes, it's, I hope that the strikes get because there's just such a big audience on YouTube
[01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:46.520]  that it's good to grow an audience there. But I certainly find your story inspiring
[01:40:46.520 --> 01:40:51.520]  because even after every major platform removed you, you're still going on your own website.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:57.520]  And I think that's a step that a lot of us need to take if we want to survive and keep making our content.
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:03.520]  Wow. Okay. Well, I mean, I've got $3 and they're awesome and they're smart, but I'm impressed.
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:06.520]  Tell me something about your parents and something about yourself.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:09.520]  I mean, don't get anything too private, but whatever's okay for you to get into it because
[01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:11.520]  I think America really admires you.
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:16.520]  Thanks. My parents are actually, they're actually, they voted Democrat.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:23.520]  They voted for Hillary Clinton. They're left-leaning people, but they're fine with different opinions in the family.
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:26.520]  They think that's fine. They truly believe in free speech.
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:31.520]  They don't necessarily agree with me, but they don't want to shut me down either because they,
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:37.520]  and I think that's a stance that more left-leaning people should take that they should be okay with, you know, ideological dissent.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:43.520]  So your parents are more classical liberals who actually believe in freedom and their children being able to think with themselves.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:45.520]  Yes.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:52.520]  Well, there was a time in my life 25 years ago where I was almost Democrat because the Republicans were being anti-free speech, nothing like this.
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:56.520]  And those liberals back then were good people on average that misguided some of them.
[01:41:56.520 --> 01:42:02.520]  But now it seems like, I mean, do your parents get freaked out by how piranha-like the left is attacking you and lying about you?
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:06.520]  I mean, yeah, they're certainly worried about that. They're nervous about that.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:10.520]  I mean, just some of the journalists finding, you know, personal info, it's sort of scary.
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:13.520]  Like, is somebody going to show up at your house or are you going to get swatted?
[01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:18.520]  You know, what are they willing to go through to take down somebody like me?
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:22.520]  Oh, are you saying, are you saying somebody's trying to dox you?
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:28.520]  I don't know if anybody's trying to dox me, but there's being journalists that have, like, some, you know,
[01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:33.520]  gotten my dad's number and started harassing him, calling him a Nazi in the skinhead and stuff like that.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.520]  Really?
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:36.520]  So, yeah.
[01:42:36.520 --> 01:42:39.520]  Wow, so your dad has been harassed?
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:41.520]  Uh, yeah, he has been harassed.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.520]  Wow, stay there.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.520]  I know you took off school today for this. This is awesome.
[01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:49.520]  I am very excited about this young lady.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.520]  Sof is our guest and follow her at Sewer Nugget on Twitter.
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:43:05.520]  I'll be right back.
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:30.520]  But you can override the censors now, and if all of our audience gets involved with hashtag Alex Jones,
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:32.520]  we are unstoppable together.
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:36.520]  We've already changed the world together with our laser focus.
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:42.520]  Do it again with hashtag Alex Jones on Twitter, on Facebook, on Google, on YouTube, everywhere.
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:46.520]  Call and talk radio, c-span, shout it out loud and public, hashtag Alex Jones.
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:50.520]  That's the rallying cry to restore the First Amendment.
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:57.520]  Creativity and the dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:02.520]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens,
[01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:09.520]  fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally dumps the population down.
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:13.520]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world,
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:16.520]  we've gone through two permutations.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.520]  The first seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source,
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.520]  and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:27.520]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:29.520]  That's been incredible.
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:36.520]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:42.520]  But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds,
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:49.520]  the forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:54.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[01:44:54.520 --> 01:45:13.520]  We're at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we're defeating the leftist tyrants.
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:44.520]  I'm at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com. We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:48.520]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:51.520]  Anybody can use it, reupload it, do whatever you want.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.520]  If you go to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, that's where they find it.
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:56.520]  You know, there's things called websites.
[01:45:56.520 --> 01:46:25.520]  Go there.
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:29.520]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:09.520]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:30.520]  Show for Sophie has liberal parents.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:33.520]  These people are thugs, they're bullies, and what they really hate is success.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:37.520]  I want to play a few minutes of her latest band video.
[01:47:37.520 --> 01:47:40.520]  And of course, I was in it, I guess that's probably one of the reasons.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:45.520]  Because again, you're not allowed to show a clip of somebody that you support.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:49.520]  Remember what Facebook said, you're only allowed to talk about me if it's negative.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:54.520]  So we're going to have Sophie decry me after this video, then maybe she'd call me a name she wants.
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.520]  She'd come to the studio and throw tomatoes at me.
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:47:59.520]  Alex Jones is horrible, he believes in freedom.
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:01.520]  But just add the proviso, he's a bad person.
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:05.520]  So here's the latest band video that they say you don't have a right to see.
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:08.520]  Assalamu Alaikum my Muslim brothers and sisters.
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:12.520]  I come to you today to atone before Allah for my misdeeds against his people.
[01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:18.520]  I perpetrated grievous verbal abuse against the defenseless and entirely innocent people of Islam
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:24.520]  by very sincerely threatening nuclear genocide on the serious platform that is a discord server.
[01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:28.520]  Little known fact, I was given permission by the United States government to do it.
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:33.520]  Not only that I have the codes, but the launch keys were in and the missiles were seconds away from being launched.
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:39.520]  All of a sudden though, I received a flood of Twitter mentions telling me that the actions I described were morally wrong,
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:41.520]  a fact which I was completely oblivious to.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:45.520]  In their sage wisdom, they proved irrefutably that my hatred was unjustified,
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:51.520]  assuring me that there is no meaningful correlation between Islam and the proliferation of rape gangs in Europe.
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:54.520]  Long story short, peer pressure succeeded in completely changing my mind,
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:58.520]  and the peacemaking spirit of John McCain inspired me to stop the nukes just in time.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:04.520]  Since then, I've become a devout follower of the Prophet Muhammad. Suffice to say, I've been having a f*** ton of fun.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:11.520]  Of course, I get raped by my 40 year old husband every so often, and I have to worship a black cube to indirectly please an ancient Canaanite God.
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:17.520]  But, at least I get to go to San Fran and stone to f*** out of some gays, and the cops can't do anything about it,
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:19.520]  because California is a crypto-caliphate.
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:23.520]  The only part of Islam I absolutely cannot get into is the anti-Jew stuff.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:27.520]  Personally, I just can't support any sort of animosity towards Jews.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.520]  I wouldn't want to be a Nazi now, would I?
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:35.520]  I assume most of you have noticed the policies surrounding hateful conduct on social media platforms,
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:39.520]  virtually tightening a muzzle on the head of anyone whose speech eludes the narrative.
[01:49:39.520 --> 01:49:45.520]  They're purging their user base, using pseudo offenses as an excuse to squeeze out ideological dissent,
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:49.520]  and enforcing conformity into every internet community they can get their hands on.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:56.520]  While the deep platforming can be partially chalked up to out of touch big tech CEOs who are just taking the path of least resistance,
[01:49:56.520 --> 01:50:00.520]  there certainly seems to be a coordinated effort coming from strident professional complainers
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:04.520]  who share an objective of removing reactionaries from all means of communication.
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:09.520]  Their job entails closely monitoring the posts of whatever online personalities they come across
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:12.520]  until one of them says something that's deemed unacceptable.
[01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:18.520]  When this happens, these f***ing Reddit homos speed to the scene, fueled by their lust for character assassination.
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:22.520]  If you pay attention to the identity these people put on when they do this,
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:25.520]  you'll notice it's not their conscious selves, it's a sub-personality.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:30.520]  And since they're essentially possessed, they tend to expose things about themselves without even noticing.
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:37.520]  Because of that, it's very obvious that their behavior has been shaped by years of being humiliated and socially rejected by women.
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:42.520]  I know that reading will elicit people to accuse me of armchair psychology, but ask yourself this.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.520]  Why do they always speak like insufferable women?
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:51.520]  You see, I've had enough run-ins with these amoebas that I understand how they operate, and they never confront you directly.
[01:50:51.520 --> 01:50:54.520]  Instead, they default to saying things like, this is not a good look.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:58.520]  I know that sort of language immediately gets the blood boiling, but think about it.
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:01.520]  They're saying you look bad rather than saying you're wrong.
[01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:04.520]  The reason for that is that their objective is not to challenge your ideas,
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:07.520]  but to give you the feeling that a stacy stare does.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:11.520]  Because in their little P-brains, being a social outcast is the worst thing you can be.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:14.520]  To put it bluntly, their whole MO is a post-talk projection.
[01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:18.520]  They imagine themselves to be the stacy that rejected them years ago,
[01:51:18.520 --> 01:51:21.520]  and their intention is to make you feel how they felt inadequate.
[01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:27.520]  For example, when they say something is not a good look, ask yourself, who does it look bad to?
[01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:33.520]  The purpose of that little phrase is to make you imagine that there's a group whose opinions you should care about, but don't fall for it.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:39.520]  They're powerless little prions who spend all day on the computer scouring the internet for people to harass.
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:43.520]  And there's a reason why they always defer to groups, which fits neatly into my theory.
[01:51:43.520 --> 01:51:47.520]  Men in general tend more towards anti-social behaviors than women,
[01:51:47.520 --> 01:51:51.520]  which is why they're not afraid of confrontation or expressing themselves in an unpopular fashion.
[01:51:51.520 --> 01:51:56.520]  These spiritual manlets, however, are feminine, so they defer to group think for everything,
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:52:01.520]  and their method of attacking you is saying, you're not popular in our group, therefore you should feel bad.
[01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:07.520]  However, this too folds, since, unlike the stacies, they don't actually have a group they belong to.
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:11.520]  And on top of that, it'd still be meaningless, since the truth is anti-democratic.
[01:52:11.520 --> 01:52:14.520]  Popularity is utterly irrelevant to what's true and what isn't.
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:18.520]  So no matter how much cool guy web slaying they conjure up and lob at you,
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:22.520]  there's still evolutionary dead ends who can't think their way out of a paper bag.
[01:52:22.520 --> 01:52:26.520]  The worst thing you can do when met with these miserable creatures is compromise.
[01:52:26.520 --> 01:52:32.520]  These people are vampires of fear and hysteria, so if you maintain your position and refuse to comply with their demands,
[01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:35.520]  they'll become increasingly upset as time goes on.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.520]  Don't ever allow yourself to be silenced.
[01:52:37.520 --> 01:52:42.520]  These nobodies will never amount to anything more than sock accounts on Twitter with numbers in their handle,
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:45.520]  whose most powerful weapon is cancelling you.
[01:52:45.520 --> 01:52:49.520]  Millennials kind of buy into the system, half of them say they're communists.
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:53.520]  I think they're going to wake up and figure out they've been conned, but Generation Z is very libertarian.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:57.520]  And the fact that they're really watching sophisticated stuff,
[01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:01.520]  I think that's part of genetics, is that each generation rebels against the last generation.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.520]  And the older generation always thinks it's bad.
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:08.520]  Sometimes you're a good generation, they should be rebelling, but they genetically do it in case you're bad.
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:14.520]  And I think that the rebellion of young people, I guess the thought police is a very, very healthy thing.
[01:53:14.520 --> 01:53:19.520]  I'm just telling you, I literally go to school sporting events and other things.
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:25.520]  I go to public schools with my kids and their friends, and it's like they don't know what CNN is.
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:29.520]  They know what Logan Paul is, they know what Alex Jones is.
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:36.520]  And they know who Sophie is, and they don't know why a guy that looks like Humpty Dumpty named Brian Stelter says that they shouldn't be on air.
[01:53:36.520 --> 01:53:40.520]  And so you call them out in this video, and you also put out that clip of me on Logan Paul,
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:44.520]  calling out the censors, calling on apathetic they are, and they want you off air.
[01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:49.520]  Even if they disagree with you, they shouldn't do that. They have no honor, they have nothing.
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:54.520]  And you see the Antifa videos where they're particularly single women out to attack them,
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:59.520]  and then the left defends that. Who do you think these people are, Sophie?
[01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:08.520]  It's mainly, I mean, it's something that I pointed out in my video. It's usually these people are not very masculine people who are doing this.
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:15.520]  Maybe sometimes they're just women, but it's a lot of guys out there that are very, like, feminine and low testosterone.
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:20.520]  And the way they make up for that is competing in a sort of female social hierarchy,
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:27.520]  and they try to manipulate you and use these dynamics of, oh, well, you're not popular, people don't like you,
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:35.520]  you know, you're too disagreeable, you're too brash, and that's how they try to manipulate you into thinking that it's not worth expressing your true opinion.
[01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:40.520]  And by the way, I've seen that myself when I've been at a restaurant, and like 10 leftists come over and go,
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:45.520]  we're going to get you, we're going to kill you, they'll boom and go, you're a loser, everyone hates you,
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:52.520]  and then they'll wait till I'm leaving to say they ran me out and have like a simulated war victory,
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:57.520]  and then lie and say I attacked them, and then I was thrown out, even though they were thrown out.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:59.520]  So they also lie a lot.
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:08.520]  Yeah, they, yeah, like, I think that's a really good example, because that's, to your face, they're just playing a popularity contest,
[01:55:08.520 --> 01:55:18.520]  and they pretend like they were fighting, as if they fought like men or something when they didn't do that at all, because they can't.
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:23.520]  Why do you think they're so particularly scared of you? I mean, they are just all over hundreds of publications saying
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:27.520]  you must be taken off the air, you're an extremist, you're dangerous, you're recruiting young people.
[01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.520]  Do they know how ridiculous they sound?
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:38.520]  I know, right? I've said it many times, I'm a pretty libertarian person, I don't like a lot of the political denomination,
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:41.520]  you know, games I go on here, and they're putting me in this box.
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:50.520]  And I think it's because it just demonstrates that Generation Z doesn't like their narrative and doesn't agree with what they've been saying as of late,
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:56:00.520]  and they don't like to see that, they'd like, you know, it's upsetting to them, and that Generation Z doesn't, won't be like that, won't be ultra liberal.
[01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:04.520]  Because they're in their bubble chambers, you're going to have the floor, because you said you can do more time with us.
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:09.520]  I want to come back and get into, as Gen Z, what you're really seeing on the ground, where you think this is all going.
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:14.520]  On the shelf, ladies and gentlemen, almost a million subscribers exploding on the Internet, they're trying to ban her,
[01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:17.520]  saying take her off the air, mainstream news articles all over the country.
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:20.520]  We're going to go to break and come back with her in the third hour.
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:23.520]  If you're listening on AM and FM, tell people about the show.
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:27.520]  If you're watching on the Internet, at infowars.com, get it out there.
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:32.520]  If you're re-uploading stuff, free to air, if you're watching on TV, just this is verboten info,
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:37.520]  a smart young lady who's a libertarian, who the left wants to silence because she uses some cuss words.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:41.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, that doesn't violate the FCC, because the FCC doesn't run the Internet.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:46.520]  But again, the left wants to sexualize kids and have, you know, six-year-olds at gay bars dancing half-naked.
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:50.520]  But a little girl says, F Liberals, well, then she's a potting mouth, she's going to be taken off air.
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:53.520]  That's all coming up, briefly, briefly.
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:57.520]  Lister supported, T-shirts, books, films, that's how you fund us.
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:59.520]  We've got the new Ultra 12.
[01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.520]  It's twice as strong as Secret 12.
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:04.520]  Highest quality, mythical bolliamen, not just highest quality, mythical bolliamen.
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:07.520]  Mythical bolliamen is the best you can get. It's the highest quality of that.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:12.520]  Double strong for 50% off, introductory, I want you to experience it.
[01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:14.520]  But it's been wildly successful.
[01:57:14.520 --> 01:57:17.520]  We've never, I mean, even Secret 12, this is double the sales.
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:20.520]  We ever had a Secret 12. People get how good a deal this is.
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:22.520]  And so I thought we'd have a three, four-month supply.
[01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:26.520]  We're going to have to pull this sale about a week or so, because there'll still be months until we get more in.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:30.520]  And it is just selling so fast at 50% off, because it's such a good deal.
[01:57:30.520 --> 01:57:34.520]  So get in there, get your Ultra 12, sign up for AutoShip, the additional 10% off in your next order,
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:37.520]  cancel for free. Anytime, whatever you do, take action.
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:41.520]  Get in the arena, get in the game, fund us, and we won't back down.
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:45.520]  Stay with us, hour number three, only two minutes away.

[01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:04.520]  You're our only sponsors.

[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:15.520]  Ancient Mayan knowledge is paired with the natural fertility of the land

[02:00:12.520 --> 02:00:22.520]  All right, joining us is South Fort Forza Fia.
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:24.520]  She is a new demon child.
[02:00:24.520 --> 02:00:28.520]  On the left, she's used some cuss words before.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:33.520]  Oh, my gosh, and they even blur her face out on BuzzFeed,
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:35.520]  and the national news has done it too.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:37.520]  They said, the little exploited girl.
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.520]  Again, they have six-year-old kids for years,
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:42.520]  and they're at age 11 dancing naked for men,
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:44.520]  having money put in their G-strings.
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:45.520]  That's good.
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:47.520]  The convicted murderers on television,
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:51.520]  talking about using ketamine and prohibinol and gang rape.
[02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:55.520]  They've got convicted child molesters doing storytime,
[02:00:55.520 --> 02:00:57.520]  unscreened with their children all over the country.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:00.520]  But this young girl, she's well-spoken,
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:02.520]  and she doesn't like leftist.
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:05.520]  I'm going to read some of these articles when I come back.
[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:07.520]  It's pretty sick unintentional comedy.
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:10.520]  I realize they all started talking bad about her a few days ago,
[02:01:10.520 --> 02:01:12.520]  and she's within one inch.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:14.520]  I'll be taking off YouTube.
[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:16.520]  What a group of swine.
[02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:18.520]  I've been asking a lot of questions for this segment and the next.
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:21.520]  I want you to get into your worldview, where you think this is going.
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:23.520]  You were talking about Generation Z,
[02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:25.520]  and what you're seeing on the ground.
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:28.520]  I told you what I'm seeing in Austin.
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:30.520]  If you don't mind, what's the general area you live in,
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:32.520]  and what are you seeing?
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:34.520]  I live in California.
[02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:37.520]  I used to live in New York.
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:40.520]  And you said you see Gen Z really waking up.
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.520]  What are you witnessing?
[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:47.520]  I like to think of it as we're sort of the creation
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:50.520]  of the previous generation of ultra-liberals.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:53.520]  Kids are seeing other kids like Desmond,
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:56.520]  who are truly maybe exploited
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:59.520]  and dancing at strip clubs and whatever.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:02.520]  They're seeing over-the-top LGBT studies at school
[02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:04.520]  that are so bad that we can't even get into
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:06.520]  how much vulgarity that is in them.
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:08.520]  And kids see that, and they're freaked out,
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:10.520]  and they just, they wake up to it,
[02:02:10.520 --> 02:02:14.520]  and they realize that some sort of narrative is being pushed on them,
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:17.520]  and they rebel against it.
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:19.520]  Exactly.
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:21.520]  That's what I'm seeing is everywhere in the schools,
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:23.520]  public or private, they're saying Donald Trump said,
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:25.520]  KKK Commander, people go find out the truth,
[02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:28.520]  and then they never believe their teachers again.
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:30.520]  Yeah.
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:33.520]  I've been talking to this kid and a couple other kids
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:35.520]  on Instagram, and in their schools,
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:37.520]  if you say you like Donald Trump,
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:39.520]  you get an in-school suspension for hate speech.
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:43.520]  You know, you say you lean this way politically
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:45.520]  instead of being far left.
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:47.520]  You get punished, you get detentions,
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:49.520]  and they get really angry about that,
[02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:52.520]  and it just pushes them completely to the other side.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:56.520]  Walk through more of that, because you see this in the news
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:02:58.520]  where people get thrown out of class
[02:02:58.520 --> 02:03:00.520]  for saying they support Trump.
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:02.520]  People get thrown out of school for wearing American flags.
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:04.520]  The Ninth Circuit ruled you can't wear American flags
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:07.520]  in, what, 12 states, that it's a symbol of hate,
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:10.520]  and that schools can say you can't wear them.
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:14.520]  I mean, this is, how do we produce this many America haters?
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:17.520]  I don't know.
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:22.520]  I guess, I don't actually know where all of the ultra,
[02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:26.520]  like far left sort of things stemmed from exactly.
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:28.520]  It's probably the result of a lot of factors,
[02:03:28.520 --> 02:03:32.520]  and it may be a response to a conservative generation
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:33.520]  before that.
[02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:35.520]  You've talked about it, you know, generations rebelling
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:38.520]  against each other, and it seems that the pendulum swing
[02:03:38.520 --> 02:03:41.520]  just keeps getting more and more extreme.
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:42.520]  Well, that's it.
[02:03:42.520 --> 02:03:43.520]  You have the CIA and the Ford Foundation
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:45.520]  wanted to screw up society.
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:46.520]  That's only classified.
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:48.520]  So they created a hyper-leftist thing.
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:49.520]  It's actually a ruling class.
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:50.520]  They weren't rebelling.
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:51.520]  They said, you're the ruling class.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:53.520]  Now they've created anti-free speech mobs
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:56.520]  that are below them.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:00.520]  So the baby boomers have created the Generation X
[02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:02.520]  and then the millennials below them
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:04.520]  that are pretty authoritarian on average.
[02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:07.520]  And then now you've just got an organic rebellion
[02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:10.520]  forming against being put in a cult, a leftist cult.
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:12.520]  So I think you hit the nail on the head.
[02:04:12.520 --> 02:04:14.520]  That's exactly what's happening here.
[02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:15.520]  Yeah.
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:20.520]  It's like, it was some sort of thing.
[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:24.520]  I don't know, yeah, it goes back a lot in time.
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:27.520]  I know nowadays a lot of people are far left
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:30.520]  just as they're capitulating to the pressure,
[02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:32.520]  the pressure that I talked about in my video.
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:37.520]  They can't, you know, there's so much harassment
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:41.520]  that you get for not agreeing with the mainstream narrative
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:44.520]  that it's just too much for people in their normal lives
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:45.520]  to deal with.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:46.520]  It just interferes too much.
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:49.520]  It just causes too many problems.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:50.520]  All right, we're going to come back.
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:51.520]  Get more into this with Shove.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:05:20.520]  I'm Alex Jones, the biggest lucid interview.
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:49.520]  I'm Alex Jones, the biggest lucid interview.
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:06:14.520]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:33.520]  Well, we're really excited to have Shove joining us.
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:39.520]  He's at Surnugget on Twitter, on YouTube, at SOPH, at patreon.com.
[02:06:39.520 --> 02:06:44.520]  I'm Alex Corbis, he's close to a million subscribers now,
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:48.520]  and he's exploding across the Internet,
[02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:51.520]  hundreds of millions of views on different derivative channels,
[02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:53.520]  and the system is getting mad.
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:57.520]  I want to spend time with her, but I want to read to you
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:59.520]  some of the things they're saying about her,
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:01.520]  because it's comical.
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:03.520]  The hand wringing, you'd think, again,
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:06.520]  that some type of monster like Godzilla had come out of the ocean
[02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:09.520]  attacking, and it's breathless BuzzFeed,
[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:12.520]  and Time Magazine or Newsweek.
[02:07:12.520 --> 02:07:15.520]  Get it off the air.
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:17.520]  Oh, gosh, shut up.
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:19.520]  It just shows what authoritarian they are,
[02:07:19.520 --> 02:07:22.520]  but also how they have been built on these universities.
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:25.520]  They're now like a cancer busting out,
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:29.520]  and they just demand full conformity.
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:30.520]  But let's go over this.
[02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:32.520]  How did you get into YouTube?
[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:33.520]  What made you want to get on air?
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:35.520]  How long have you been doing it?
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:37.520]  And you talk about YouTube being a stepping stone.
[02:07:37.520 --> 02:07:40.520]  What do you want to write down in your life?
[02:07:40.520 --> 02:07:43.520]  What are your aspirations?
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:47.520]  Sound funny, but I got into YouTube by watching gaming videos,
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:49.520]  and mainly PewDiePie.
[02:07:49.520 --> 02:07:51.520]  And this was all the way back in the fourth grade
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:52.520]  when I was nine years old.
[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:53.520]  That's not even a joke.
[02:07:53.520 --> 02:07:55.520]  I was watching PewDiePie every day,
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:58.520]  and I figured I would give it a shot,
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:07:59.520]  do some Let's Plays on my own,
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:02.520]  and I did that for a few years just for fun.
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:05.520]  And eventually I found the commentary genre on YouTube,
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:07.520]  which was blowing up in 2016,
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:12.520]  and I thought that was sort of a prototype
[02:08:12.520 --> 02:08:13.520]  of what I'm doing now,
[02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:17.520]  where I would articulate some sort of idea for an audience,
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:19.520]  and back then it would be over a video game.
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:21.520]  That just sort of progressed over time
[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:24.520]  after the commentary genre kind of died out.
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:29.520]  I grew as a person, and I gained more knowledge.
[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:31.520]  I sort of moved on to this,
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:34.520]  and realized I would be a good person
[02:08:34.520 --> 02:08:37.520]  to fight against PC culture and thought police,
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:40.520]  and I could do some pretty good comedy videos.
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:43.520]  And about YouTube being a stepping stone,
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:46.520]  I think just nowadays with all the censorship,
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:50.520]  and there's no transparency between YouTube and its creators,
[02:08:50.520 --> 02:08:54.520]  and the community guidelines are constantly changing to,
[02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:58.520]  please everybody who's putting pressure on them to be more PC.
[02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:01.520]  It's just, it's not a viable option
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:04.520]  for anybody who wants to make anything remotely nuanced,
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:08.520]  remotely interesting, and controversial.
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:12.520]  So, yeah, I eventually maybe set up my own website,
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:15.520]  maybe move on to other platforms that are set up.
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:19.520]  I know Bitshoot is a good option, and, you know...
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:22.520]  Well, my advice is be on as many platforms as you can.
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:23.520]  Go ahead.
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:25.520]  Yeah, so just, you know,
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:28.520]  why didn't my reach and try to be present
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:30.520]  and maybe do something like InForward.
[02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:34.520]  Yeah, so your own website is probably the safest option.
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:38.520]  Well, let me raise this point to you.
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:41.520]  You need to fight back at what you're doing,
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:43.520]  and you're very confident, you're very smart,
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:45.520]  you're very quick on your feet,
[02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:48.520]  and I'm not saying don't be confident,
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:50.520]  but I would also defend yourself
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:53.520]  because these outrage brigades,
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:55.520]  big tech works for the universities,
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:57.520]  they work to create this,
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:09:59.520]  they're feeding the trolls by empowering them
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:01.520]  to have people removed.
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:03.520]  That's all they're doing, so they need to be called out.
[02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:05.520]  But we go to Democrat party events,
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:08.520]  my reporters do, I do every week, five or six times,
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:10.520]  and I'm telling you, we're not cherry picking people
[02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:12.520]  to just make them look like unhinged maniacs.
[02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:14.520]  I don't care if they're young or if they're old,
[02:10:14.520 --> 02:10:16.520]  you go to a Democratic event,
[02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:18.520]  they act like people at a state mental institution,
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:20.520]  they don't like free speech, they're violent,
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:23.520]  they're hateful, they scream, they yell,
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:26.520]  they are aggressive, they're bullish.
[02:10:26.520 --> 02:10:28.520]  And then I talk to you,
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:30.520]  I'm a conservative or libertarian,
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:32.520]  or just nationalist young people,
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:34.520]  they can be black or white,
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:36.520]  they're always smart, they're always talented,
[02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:37.520]  you don't have talking points,
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:38.520]  you sound like a smart adult.
[02:10:38.520 --> 02:10:41.520]  Most adults sound totally dumb now,
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:44.520]  and I'm just not sure what's happened in society,
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:45.520]  what's happened in culture,
[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:47.520]  and I don't know what you're experiencing out in California,
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:49.520]  it seems pretty bad out there,
[02:10:49.520 --> 02:10:51.520]  but what is it like, you're well spoken,
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:53.520]  your parents I'm sure are well spoken,
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:57.520]  have you noticed that a lot of adults can hardly talk?
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:01.520]  Yeah, I mean, in my personal experience,
[02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:06.520]  I've seen a few teachers try to push a political message on to me,
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:08.520]  and when you question them further about it,
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:11.520]  they can't really defend their standpoint,
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:14.520]  and that's sort of disappointing.
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:18.520]  I don't get much interaction with adults outside of that,
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:22.520]  I know online watching series like Change My Mind,
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:25.520]  it's just embarrassing how some of these adults act
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:26.520]  and carry themselves through the world,
[02:11:26.520 --> 02:11:30.520]  they take themselves so seriously, it's unbelievable.
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:33.520]  You know, something we need to do, we haven't done in a while,
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:35.520]  because we've got eight screen lists of people famously,
[02:11:35.520 --> 02:11:36.520]  you know, we shot that screaming,
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:38.520]  you're an effing white male, to a white male,
[02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:40.520]  saying you don't have speech, you're an effing white male.
[02:11:40.520 --> 02:11:42.520]  We've not made a compilation, the last few years,
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:46.520]  of all the unhinged leftists with their veins about to bust out,
[02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:48.520]  screaming, eff you Nazi, you have no free speech.
[02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:50.520]  I mean, here's just a quick clip of just,
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:52.520]  well, there's like 20 minutes of this from just last week,
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:54.520]  here it is.
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:55.520]  Get the hell out of here!
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:59.520]  Get these people to hell out of here right now!
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:02.520]  And they just run around foaming at the mouth.
[02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:04.520]  Alex Jones kills people.
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:05.520]  Who's he killed?
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:06.520]  People.
[02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:07.520]  Who?
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:08.520]  All of them.
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:09.520]  Names, please.
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:10.520]  The ones that he killed.
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:12.520]  We would really like to know the names.
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:13.520]  The Jewish people.
[02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:15.520]  Oh my gosh, come on.
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:17.520]  Get me the names, come on.
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:19.520]  And she's not editing this, it goes on for like 20 minutes.
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:21.520]  And then you think, well, that doesn't,
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:22.520]  then you go out in public, they're like,
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:24.520]  it's like Oprah Winfrey, the secret.
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:27.520]  They believe because, oh yeah, let's see Aids Creelich for a second,
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:28.520]  we haven't seen him in a while.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:30.520]  They, with audio in a second,
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:33.520]  they believe if they say it, you're a green frog,
[02:12:33.520 --> 02:12:34.520]  you're a green frog.
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:37.520]  Here, let's play some Aids Creelichs.
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:38.520]  White man!
[02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:40.520]  White people don't know what it's like to be poor!
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:41.520]  That's right!
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:42.520]  Bullshit!
[02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:45.520]  And there's Carl the Cuck.
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:46.520]  We got to dump it.
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:47.520]  We've got an edited version.
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:48.520]  There's somebody find it.
[02:12:48.520 --> 02:12:49.520]  Okay, let's go back to our guest.
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:50.520]  I'm ranting here.
[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:52.520]  Sophie, where do you,
[02:12:52.520 --> 02:12:55.520]  where do you think this is going next?
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:57.520]  Um, I honestly have no idea.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:01.520]  I think the sort of censorship is only going to get heavier
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:03.520]  and heavier as there's more conflict and tension
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:06.520]  between the two sides of the issue.
[02:13:06.520 --> 02:13:09.520]  And I think, I think you've talked about this before.
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:12.520]  They slowly just increase the oppression until, you know,
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:14.520]  just at every step of the way,
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:18.520]  they just expecting people to, um, to accept that
[02:13:18.520 --> 02:13:21.520]  as if they just add, you know, a little bit more censorship,
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:23.520]  a little bit more, okay, you can't say this,
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:24.520]  you can't say that.
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:27.520]  I think it's going to get to a tipping point
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:29.520]  where even people on the left are like,
[02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:31.520]  I can't handle this anymore.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:33.520]  And I don't know what that's going to end up with.
[02:13:33.520 --> 02:13:35.520]  If that's going to be an actual war,
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:38.520]  if that's just going to be, you know, a lot of riots,
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:41.520]  but it's certainly going to end up in a lot of conflict
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:42.520]  the way I see it.
[02:13:42.520 --> 02:13:43.520]  No, you're right.
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:46.520]  And Silicon Valley and the universities and the left as a group
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:49.520]  are cloistered in their own weird bubbles.
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:51.520]  They think they're fighting old Republican blue bloods
[02:13:51.520 --> 02:13:53.520]  who are all dead.
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:55.520]  And the average conservative isn't even a conservative.
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:57.520]  They're just a common sense pro-America person.
[02:13:57.520 --> 02:14:00.520]  And the weird stereotype they're projecting on people
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:02.520]  isn't intimidating us anymore.
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:06.520]  So I think this is coming down very, very quickly.
[02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:10.520]  Yeah, it's definitely not going to end well.
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:13.520]  I think people are very pissed off.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:15.520]  Mark Zuckerberg said,
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:17.520]  you may not say Alex Jones are in full wars
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:20.520]  unless it's in a negative, disparaging line.
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:24.520]  So Sophie, or Sophie is your known SOPH,
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:26.520]  an evil YouTube star.
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.520]  Would you like to decry me just to follow his orders
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:31.520]  and do what he says?
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:34.520]  Yes, Mark Zuckerberg, you're the best man alive
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:36.520]  and Alex Jones is horrible.
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:39.520]  He stands for everything I hate, he's very despicable
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:42.520]  and please keep banning him, keep him off the platform.
[02:14:42.520 --> 02:14:45.520]  But that's not exactly, the exact words were,
[02:14:45.520 --> 02:14:49.520]  you must decry me, what's the exact term?
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:51.520]  You must repudiate me.
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:53.520]  Just say it exactly as he says.
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:56.520]  It's not creepy when he's got 2.4 million people under his control
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:58.520]  that he's reading your messages in live time
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:00.520]  and saying what words you can use.
[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:03.520]  We submit to him, so you need to
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:06.520]  specifically say that you repudiate me.
[02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:09.520]  I repudiate Alex Jones.
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:11.520]  There we go.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:15.520]  And you agree with AOC, the world is ending in 12 years.
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:16.520]  Yup.
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:19.520]  And if AOC gave you Kool-Aid with cyanide in it,
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:21.520]  you're going to be good, right?
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:22.520]  Yup.
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:24.520]  You're going to do what AOC says?
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:27.520]  I'll drink all the tap water that AOC wants me to drink.
[02:15:27.520 --> 02:15:30.520]  AOC, think about AOC.
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:32.520]  You're knocking AOC because she's a woman.
[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:35.520]  I'm knocking her because she looks like a methhead demon.
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:37.520]  It's a damn moron.
[02:15:37.520 --> 02:15:39.520]  Got the crazy eyes.
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:42.520]  Oh, she's got some crazy eyes, man.
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:44.520]  She's, you know what I mean?
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:46.520]  If she had to snort in big old lines of methamphetamine every day,
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:48.520]  she's smoking it.
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:51.520]  Well, they're right back with the evil thought criminal.
[02:15:51.520 --> 02:16:02.520]  Do or Nugget.
[02:16:21.520 --> 02:16:23.520]  Welcome to the I.R.S.

[02:16:55.520 --> 02:16:57.520]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:16:59.520]  I started fighting the I.R.S. over 40 years ago
[02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:01.520]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:03.520]  I sued the I.R.S. in one.
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:05.520]  I beat the I.R.S. then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:07.520]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement,
[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:09.520]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:11.520]  they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:13.520]  I can help you too.
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:15.520]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[02:17:27.520 --> 02:17:29.520]  is a book that claims the United States
[02:17:29.520 --> 02:17:31.520]  is the empire of the world.
[02:17:31.520 --> 02:17:33.520]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:35.520]  The United States of Empire

[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:39.520]  and II left England broken.
[02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:41.520]  Its former colony, the U.S.,
[02:17:41.520 --> 02:17:43.520]  had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:45.520]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:52.000]  fight for it. The Deep State began with World War One. The United States of Empire by James

[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:21.000]  Tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake. You know, if you just add it to milk, it tastes
[02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:25.920]  like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. It tastes like oval theme. Like, good.
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:31.560]  I feel great since I've been taking it. My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride three

[02:19:49.840 --> 02:20:01.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:21.920]  Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones. Our guest is really interesting. S O P H Sof
[02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:30.280]  at sewer nugget on Twitter, hundreds of millions of views, a million subscribers almost. Patreon.com
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:35.840]  forward slash Corbis. She used to go by Lieutenant Corbis. And she's just criticizing the left
[02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:40.760]  censorship. She's criticizing open borders, radical Islam. And they now have two strikes
[02:20:40.760 --> 02:20:44.520]  against her. They want to take her channel down. She's with us. I want to read some of
[02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:48.600]  the hysterical stuff they're saying about her. But you're very nice. You're very smart,
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:52.280]  but you're also very polite here on here. Other points you want to make other things
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:56.640]  you want to get into what you want to do when you, you know, aspire to grow up. I forgot
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:21:01.400]  to get into that. And just other points you'd like to make.
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:07.160]  I would just like to say that I think it's a good point that if I were super leftist
[02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:11.560]  right now, if I was spewing all of their talking points, they wouldn't call me brainwashed.
[02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:15.960]  They wouldn't call me exploited. And they would say I know everything I'm saying. And
[02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:20.160]  it's not just an act of rebellion. They would just, they would call me woke and they would,
[02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:24.560]  they would be worshiping my feet. And it's a, it's a really strange double standard that
[02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:29.280]  they have, you know, with people like Greta Thunberg, they never say that she's exploited,
[02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:34.400]  that she's brainwashed with Desmond. They, they, they say that all the people calling
[02:21:34.400 --> 02:21:40.560]  CPS are being, you know, so paranoid. I just think it's, it's so clear that the double
[02:21:40.560 --> 02:21:43.480]  standard that they have with that.
[02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:47.680]  Let's get more into the harassment. Tell us what happened to your dad.
[02:21:47.680 --> 02:21:54.680]  Well, this, this journalist named Talia Levin, she somehow got his phone number, his work
[02:21:54.680 --> 02:22:00.120]  email. She just started by asking if she could get an interview with him because I wasn't
[02:22:00.120 --> 02:22:04.880]  responding to her emails because I, I looked her name up when I saw her first email and
[02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:09.720]  I realized that she was looking to paint me as some far right extremist. And when I did
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:14.320]  it in reply, she started, you know, like trying to call him, text him after a while. She said
[02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:18.920]  that he was enabling some sort of racist, Nazi behaviors in me. I mean, really just
[02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:21.400]  crazy stuff.
[02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:25.360]  That's real defamation when they're funded by an actual Nazi collaborator, George Soros.
[02:22:25.360 --> 02:22:27.760]  And that's one of the things that criticize you here is you talk bad about the Lord and
[02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:34.960]  Savior, uh, George Soros. Here's some BuzzFeed examples. YouTube's newest, far right, foul
[02:22:34.960 --> 02:22:40.560]  mouth, red pilling stars, a 14 year old girl. Then they blur your face like it's bad that
[02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:45.680]  your face can be seen. What does a 14 year old girl dressed in a cador had to say about
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:50.960]  YouTube to amass more than 800,000 followers? How about this? He's nobody follows these
[02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:55.520]  people. I become a devout follower of the problem. Muhammad suffices to say I've been
[02:22:55.520 --> 02:23:01.120]  having a lot of fun. Of course, I get raped by my 40 year old husband. Every so often
[02:23:01.120 --> 02:23:07.960]  I have to worship a black cube to indirectly, uh, please an ancient and anite God, but at
[02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:14.960]  least I get to go to San Fran and stoned the bleep out of some gays and then cops can't
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:19.800]  do anything about it because California is a crypto caliphate. Or how about this? And
[02:23:19.800 --> 02:23:25.120]  then it goes on. Yes. If you want a vision of the future of YouTube is midwifing. Imagine
[02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:30.560]  a cherubric white girl mocking Islamic dress while lecturing her hundreds of thousands
[02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:35.960]  of followers about Muslim rape gangs, social justice, homos, and that's all edited together.
[02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:42.080]  And the evils wrought by George Soros under the thin guys of edgy internet comedy. Oh,
[02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:47.880]  there's a guys. Oh, but they found the secret popular thing. It's always the same formula.
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:51.920]  We caught the secret that's all over in popular and then they misrepresented. I want to warn
[02:23:51.920 --> 02:23:55.240]  you and it sounds like you're smart beyond your years, but I still haven't figured this
[02:23:55.240 --> 02:24:00.680]  out. You talked to the New York Times and Washington Post, anybody you got to record
[02:24:00.680 --> 02:24:07.160]  it all, they still don't care. They will lie about you at criminal levels. And so I've
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:11.680]  gotten the point where I will not do any interviews because nothing good can come out of it. And
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:16.000]  what you're doing is very smart. If your dad talks to these people or you do, they will
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.160]  say, you know, that she was eating feces in front of us screaming, how Hitler and her
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:26.040]  father was raping her with 14 baboons. I mean, they will say anything. So I'm warning you.
[02:24:26.040 --> 02:24:31.640]  Yeah. I mean, with Joe Bernstein, I already got a taste of that. It's the email he started
[02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:36.120]  off with when he tried to, you know, talk to me. And of course I didn't respond because
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:40.960]  he's well known to be, you know, a person that wants to smear everybody who doesn't agree
[02:24:40.960 --> 02:24:45.880]  with him. The email he started off with, he literally promised that he wouldn't use the
[02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:51.040]  article title that he used. He promised that he wouldn't say, Oh, this is Paul's favorite
[02:24:51.040 --> 02:24:56.280]  new far right 14 year old. He, he literally said that in the email and then he went right
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:00.520]  ahead and did it. He was trying to be, you know, you need to publish it all. People don't
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:06.200]  know they are, they, they have to lie even if it helped. I'm telling you, total inversion.
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:09.760]  So I'm glad you're experiencing it now. So you know how bad they are. Was it shocking
[02:25:09.760 --> 02:25:14.400]  to have them lie to your face and then even have the email prison? I mean, I was expecting
[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:18.040]  it. That's why I didn't respond to the email because though, you know, him trying to be
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:23.760]  all nice and, you know, try to, um, try to predict what my move was. I was going to try
[02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:26.960]  to make fun of him or something. You know, being like that, I was like, there's no way
[02:25:26.960 --> 02:25:30.320]  that he actually, you know, wants to have an honest discussion with me because these
[02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:34.160]  people never want to have an honest discussion. So I didn't reply. And then when he made the
[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:37.200]  article, I wasn't surprised because that's just what these journalists do. They have
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:38.200]  no principles.
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:43.800]  Well, here's the good news. And I'm not just saying this. Obama was hot when he was running
[02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:47.480]  in a for about a year when he was in, he would get millions of years on YouTube. He gets
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:51.400]  like when he was still president, like 2000 views on his average YouTube, Trump gets a
[02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:56.680]  million, I would get a million, whatever. So Buzzfeed, all these groups, it's turned
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:02.400]  out have fake clicks. They're all going bankrupt. Uh, Salon's going under. So people understand
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:06.560]  they literally have no readers except other fellow journalists that go around getting
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:11.080]  people censored. So they're not even journalists. They're, they're a bunch of failed shellouts
[02:26:11.080 --> 02:26:15.160]  to the system that don't understand everyone hates them and it's over.
[02:26:15.160 --> 02:26:22.440]  Yeah. I mean, you know, they just can't accept that these sort of news publications, um,
[02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:26.360]  are becoming a thing of the past. The content is becoming, you know, it's, it's going to
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:31.200]  a video format. It's going to online streaming. That's the new thing. And they're just sort
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:38.280]  of crawling to, to try not to die out. And so they make these crazy moves and crazy stories
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:41.880]  to desperately try to get clicks. And yeah, you're right. A lot of people that are reading
[02:26:41.880 --> 02:26:46.600]  these are people who are just like them who are looking to smear people. So when they
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:50.120]  read Joe Bernstein's article, they go over to my channel and they mass flag it and they
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:53.560]  get me striked. So I think that, I think that's what's happening.
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:58.880]  Well, if you, if you talk to like a Charlie Warzel or any of these, these writers, you
[02:26:58.880 --> 02:27:04.120]  think they're putting on a retarded surfer act like you think, okay, you're just acting
[02:27:04.120 --> 02:27:09.320]  dumb. They have low vocabularies. They're incredibly stupid. They're not intellectuals.
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:13.800]  You know, usually their parents have, you know, mental illnesses and things. I'm sad
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:20.120]  to say it. These are the bottom of the barrel. These are people that, you know, on a farm,
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.280]  you'd have carry the bags of apples. You couldn't even have them go up in a tree and get apples.
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:28.200]  And I'm not being mean, but, but you have to understand they are told they're the ruling
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:32.880]  clash. They don't even get their villains out there killing free speech and openly trying
[02:27:32.880 --> 02:27:36.640]  to mainline tyranny. We're pushed our next guest back 15 because you took school off
[02:27:36.640 --> 02:27:40.240]  the thing. And I got to have you on more and feel going on today. This is a hot interview.
[02:27:40.240 --> 02:27:45.440]  People love you. And I'm very excited at what you're doing. My little sewer nugget. Again,
[02:27:45.440 --> 02:27:51.880]  at sewer nugget. And again, it's S O P H like Sophie, but SOF and patreon.com forward slash
[02:27:51.880 --> 02:27:56.440]  Corbis. People should really support what you're doing. Even if they don't like the edginess,
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:01.200]  this is how nationalists, conservatives and patriots are going to win is in a thousand
[02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:05.400]  different strikes. Some things deliver like a conservative preacher. If that's who you
[02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:10.360]  are. Some things like a wild out libertarian like I am. You know, some things like a snarky
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:16.400]  young lady like she is. But the quantity of quality information is light years ahead of
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:20.840]  the enemy. We don't have teleprompters. We're really talking. She's not being handed pieces
[02:28:20.840 --> 02:28:25.800]  of paper by her parents. She's up here having an adult discussion that most university professors
[02:28:25.800 --> 02:28:29.880]  couldn't have like, like they have a few talking points and then like, look to see if you have
[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:35.400]  notes when you're talking to them about anything because they're frauds and they know their
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:41.960]  times over and people like SOF are the future. So looking into the future in the final segment
[02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:46.920]  with our fellow thought criminals straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones, still here still fighting
[02:28:46.920 --> 02:28:52.240]  in full wars.com prison.com tomorrow's news today. And we have two special guests coming

[02:30:30.080 --> 02:30:34.040]  I am. It's people like you on the ground as you know, that's boots on the ground. All

[02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:58.440]  coming through the storm thanks to you. It would take me more than an hour just to
[02:30:58.440 --> 02:31:06.040]  lay out all the admitted benefits and known positive effects of just one of the ingredients
[02:31:06.040 --> 02:31:11.680]  in our ultimate bone broth formula. Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the
[02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:15.600]  amazing things that it's associated with. And then it's been the big craze for at least
[02:31:15.600 --> 02:31:19.400]  a decade. Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink
[02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:23.640]  in a soup that was sick. But then you add, not just the fact that this is the strongest,
[02:31:23.640 --> 02:31:28.920]  most concentrated, highest quality bone broth out there, literally. Then you have the chaga
[02:31:28.920 --> 02:31:33.120]  mushroom, then you have the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the
[02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:39.320]  other key ingredients that are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[02:31:39.320 --> 02:31:44.160]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing. It's 50% off right now in FullWareStore.com
[02:31:44.160 --> 02:31:47.480]  because I want you to try it and see how great it is. And of course, getting the bone broth,
[02:31:47.480 --> 02:31:51.720]  this is just great for you and your family. It's also amazing when it comes to funding
[02:31:51.720 --> 02:31:55.720]  our operation that's taken on the globalists and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[02:31:55.720 --> 02:32:02.720]  Okay, it's true. I stayed up late last night, so I had half the turbo force this morning.
[02:32:25.720 --> 02:32:54.720]  And get the fish oil.
[02:32:54.720 --> 02:33:01.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:46.720]  No exaggeration. How much was it? It was something like $6 million, $7 million a year.
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:51.260]  We were bringing it off YouTube. And I was able to finance a bunch of the stuff we were
[02:33:51.260 --> 02:33:56.920]  doing here. I mean, it was one of our main funders. And about five years ago, they just
[02:33:56.920 --> 02:34:02.560]  demonetized 99% of our videos. I noticed we had a video bashing police because all
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:08.600]  bash cops when they're bad, they would green light the video, let it get 20 million views,
[02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:16.320]  wooden shadow ban it, let all our subscribers see it, and we get paid. And they had YouTube,
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:22.160]  Vice Presidents, and I had to sign on disclosures and stuff, but calling up or I had to sign
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:26.320]  it verbally. I had agreements with them. It was all proprietary, so I can't get it all
[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:29.480]  over on air. But it was just stuff like, let us guide you into your message and you'll
[02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:36.160]  be a bigger star. And I've got plaques in there where they send us awards and stuff.
[02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:40.280]  And I was like, wait, you want me to bash cops and then you'll turn the monetization
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:47.760]  on. So when we became, when we started to get more pro police, I was never against police.
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:51.800]  But the media would cherry pick my negative comments and blow those up because they wanted
[02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:58.760]  that cultural division. When I started realizing that and pulled back, then they got upset.
[02:34:58.760 --> 02:35:06.400]  So there's a lot that goes into all of this. And you've got to be on the inside to learn
[02:35:06.400 --> 02:35:11.480]  about it all. Now, now understand when you've got 80 something employees and bandwidth costs
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:17.560]  and things, $6 million sounds like a lot of money. How about when $6 million is gone?
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:24.320]  And I'm not complaining. I'm saying, think about how they didn't just take our sponsors.
[02:35:24.320 --> 02:35:27.760]  They don't just block us everywhere. They don't just take us off of all these platforms and
[02:35:27.760 --> 02:35:35.080]  then I'll tell you, you can't say our name. Then they make us in pay for own bandwidth,
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:41.600]  which is fine. We're doing it, our own audio, our own video. And it's a, it's a good type
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:46.920]  of pain. We're going back to our guests when usually our videos that we post, maybe get
[02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:52.680]  a hundred thousand views in a week or so viral ones, sometimes a million, we've had a few
[02:35:52.680 --> 02:35:58.240]  that have gotten seven, eight, nine million a piece. And then I get the giant bill, you
[02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:03.600]  know, a lot of that's an extra, you know, $80,000 or whatever. But it's just people
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:07.080]  don't understand what goes into all of this. And then to just have people come in when
[02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:12.000]  you build a subscriber base and you put money into it with equipment and crew, then you'll
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:18.120]  use YouTube with five billion views and they already put ads on it. Don't even give me
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:22.720]  the money. And then they completely throw you out and lie about you when you, when they
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:28.600]  do it, that's really the biggest insult here. But the good news and the reason SOF is so
[02:36:28.600 --> 02:36:36.240]  important that Twitter at Sir Nugget and on YouTube at SOPH is that even if they ban her,
[02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:41.040]  she'll go find another platform and over time it'll kill YouTube and Facebook. But other
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:46.440]  people will step into her shoes as well. So I just wanted to let her know that all the
[02:36:46.440 --> 02:36:50.440]  young people out there that are awake really excite me of the kids that are politically
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:56.960]  awake. I'd say 80% are contrarians, anti-establishment. They like Trump, but they really just like
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:37:02.240]  freedom of speech. Beyond that, they're very sophisticated. They're the opposite of a lot
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:05.720]  of the millennials and the boomers. I'm not saying all millennials, all boomers. I'm saying
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:10.240]  a large percentage statistically low IQs, lazy, stupid, ill, got a whole stack of news
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:14.760]  about that today. Something's wrong with them. And so I see that Generation Z, who would
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:20.320]  ever thought this, because I have children, I have four children and they're all Generation
[02:37:20.320 --> 02:37:27.400]  Z, 16 down to two, and the three that are 11, 14, and 16, they're already past Alex
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:32.240]  Jones. They're already passed Donald Trump. They're already passed Austrian economics.
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:36.760]  They just get it. And that's got to really scare the establishment or maybe SOPH, they
[02:37:36.760 --> 02:37:38.640]  don't know what's happening. What do you think?
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:46.200]  Yeah, I think it's certainly scary that you have a whole generation that doesn't go along
[02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:50.300]  with their narrative. And I think that's also why all these news publications are freaking
[02:37:50.300 --> 02:37:54.320]  out, publishing all these stories. They realize that they're going to be gone soon. So they're
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:59.400]  trying to rake in all the profits before the next generation is the one that doesn't even
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:04.520]  watch them. I mean, no kid is on Facebook. No kid is watching CNN or Fox News or any
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:08.840]  of the mainstream stuff. They're all on Twitter. They're all on YouTube. They're all getting
[02:38:08.840 --> 02:38:14.480]  their information from there, 4chan, whatever.
[02:38:14.480 --> 02:38:20.040]  What happens then when they say Alex Jones is forbidden? I mean, in school or with your
[02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:25.840]  peers, what happens when there's a big national story, a thousand articles? Alex Jones is
[02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:30.440]  a Nazi. He's been banned. What do people say?
[02:38:30.440 --> 02:38:34.880]  I think that pushes them farther away from the establishment and that, you know, that
[02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:39.280]  spawns more memes that makes more kids, you know, angry and it just, you know, pushes
[02:38:39.280 --> 02:38:43.880]  them more towards freedom of speech. And it works maybe for the older generation, but
[02:38:43.880 --> 02:38:47.160]  it works in the opposite way for the younger generation.
[02:38:47.160 --> 02:38:52.640]  How can they be so historically blind that when you ban someone who's popular, you make
[02:38:52.640 --> 02:38:57.040]  them a folk hero and they're doing it to more and more people and it's back lashing,
[02:38:57.040 --> 02:39:04.520]  but they just giggle and laugh and celebrate like they're having a victory. It's bizarre.
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:09.560]  Yeah. I mean, it's almost seems like it's intentional because of Streisand of fact.
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:13.800]  I mean, they should be very familiar with it by now and just the amount of growth that
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:19.560]  I've experienced from being, from having strikes and getting all these articles is insane.
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:25.520]  And I would think that they, you know, would be aware of that and makes me think like there's
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:29.200]  something else going on, but I don't know how that would even work in their benefit.
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:34.720]  That's because you're logical and that's because you obviously have a high IQ, but
[02:39:34.720 --> 02:39:39.600]  I think these people are illogical and let me explain something. Their internal documents
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:44.480]  have come out, their internal WikiLeaks. I've experienced five years of being demonetized
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:50.960]  and then just more and more taken away until now. It's death threats, PIs, lawsuits, harassment.
[02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:56.960]  They really believe, sure, they believe upfront destroying you in their eyes will give you
[02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:01.840]  a little bit of a supernova glow, but they think in the end they're going to dial it
[02:40:01.840 --> 02:40:07.080]  all back and exterminate you and take your bank account away. So that's why they're
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:12.920]  doing it. It's a very dangerous gamble, but they've seen it work in China. And so they
[02:40:12.920 --> 02:40:18.480]  think, it comes down to this stuff, I'm betting on you, you're betting on me, your parents
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:21.960]  are betting on you, we're betting on America. I think this is going to blow up in their
[02:40:21.960 --> 02:40:25.440]  face. Matt Drudge thinks it's going to blow up in their face. Trump thinks it'll blow
[02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:30.760]  up in their face. I think it's up to us how active we are, how aggressive we are to see
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:34.400]  what happens. And I would encourage you and other young people, it's great you're doing
[02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:38.960]  all this online, but go out, do some stuff in the third dimension and then put that on
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:43.240]  the internet to encourage an invasion of the third dimension because more and more were
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:49.680]  caught up in Silicon zeros and ones fantasy world. And that's fine. But I think an invasion
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:52.520]  of the third dimension needs to be led by people like you.
[02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:56.240]  Yeah, I definitely think that as well. And that's certainly going to be happening in
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:00.600]  2020 with all the election stuff going on. I mean, that's a, that's an amazing opportunity
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:07.640]  for all sorts of content. And my collaborator who's a fellow Gen Z year, we write together,
[02:41:07.640 --> 02:41:13.720]  he lives in Brazil. He's coming over to the United States that year. He loves you as well.
[02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:16.160]  And we're going to be, that's what we're going to be doing. We're going to be going
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:19.560]  outside. We're going to be on the street making that sort of content to encourage people
[02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:24.600]  to sort of, you know, be like us as well.
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:29.320]  So I just feel like you're the cavalry. Can we queue up? You guys do a great job. I was
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:32.400]  like, give them stuff so fast. They can't do it. We don't have a sound board in there,
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:37.400]  but we should, well, a bugle of the cavalry call. We, where the cavalry comes over the
[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:43.880]  hill because folks, I come on here and I tell you, Hey, I go to pick up one of my daughters
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:50.400]  at a birthday party and it's like Elvis arrived and they're all asking me, do you know, putty
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:57.320]  pie? Do you know, Steven Crowder, do you know, do you know, so I mean, this is what's happening.
[02:41:57.320 --> 02:42:04.400]  And they literally aren't saying, sorry, you got the platform. They're like, what is CNN?
[02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:10.200]  Literally CNN has a hundred thousand viewers on average. So has that every hour. Think
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:17.200]  about the arrogance, though, of these people and where this is all going. It's incredible.
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:25.280]  Yes. Play it again. There she is. Can you do like you're riding in for us? Riding in.
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:37.720]  So I don't want you to miss any more school brainwashing, whatever your parents. Thanks.

[02:45:03.640 --> 02:45:07.280]  believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:12.800]  of their great destiny to merge with AI gods. Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:16.440]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension. One of the biggest places
[02:45:16.440 --> 02:45:21.720]  that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.

[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:25.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:35.280]  to 3 p.m. Central. We're here live. It just sounds crazy to say the most censored the
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:42.320]  most demonized the most lied about broadcast in the world. And we just had so far and this
[02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:46.680]  young lady that's got basically a million subscribers. Our videos have got hundreds
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:51.800]  of millions of views and the left wants her to platform and has almost done it. And she
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:56.760]  can confidently laugh at them all day. This is criminal. It needs to stop. But it just
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:00.080]  shows where they're going. But when I was in D.C. a few weeks ago, I'm not bragging
[02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:08.160]  about me. I kept getting mobbed by school tours of high schoolers and middle students.
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:16.160]  And finally about, you know, into the tent mobbing. I said, Hey, videotape this and they're
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:20.960]  back there grabbing it. Do do did a video to the day. This is just one of the events
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:26.360]  that happened. The young people don't know what CNN is literally. And that's where the
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:31.320]  system has miscalculated. They've already lost the hearts and minds. And yeah, they've
[02:48:31.320 --> 02:48:35.280]  kind of got that generation after that. And they've got the baby boomers to think of the
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:40.760]  rightful rulers of America in the world, but they're not in full control. And so that's
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:50.840]  why they're cracking down on speech everywhere. Now, this is perfect timing, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:50.840 --> 02:49:08.480]  The perfect timing right now because Trump and the White House
[02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:15.320]  and others are starting to move to understand what we're dealing with. And if we win the
[02:49:15.320 --> 02:49:23.880]  free speech situation, we win everything else. And you've had all these different senators
[02:49:23.880 --> 02:49:30.560]  starting to figure it out. You've had the big speech given in the Senate today by the
[02:49:30.560 --> 02:49:35.840]  freshman senator from Missouri. You've got the big article up on info wars.com. We're
[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:41.280]  going to post this full speech there as we speak in the article. Trump is a 2.0 Senator
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:50.200]  Josh Holly unveils populist platform to fight big tech. Aristocrats restore America. It's
[02:49:50.200 --> 02:49:55.880]  happening. The worm is starting to turn. That doesn't mean we're completely winning. But
[02:49:55.880 --> 02:50:06.600]  man, we've already come back a lot. We've already come back. White ears from where
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:15.520]  we were. So I wanted to get George on with us. And he's a documentary filmmaker and
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:21.360]  I'd say more of a kind of a classical liberal, not a leftist. And they came here I guess
[02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:26.720]  about eight months ago, then about four months ago, I'm not getting all the times right.
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:32.000]  And they said we want to make really a fair film about the deployment of the censorship.
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:38.680]  And then basically right on time with the next wave of censorship, the film is coming
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:53.800]  out today. And so
[02:50:53.800 --> 02:50:58.760]  so just imagine what it's going to be like if they're able to shut down everybody else's
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:15.840]  free speech. But that's what it comes down to. Imagine if this show just goes off the
[02:51:15.840 --> 02:51:25.240]  air. Imagine that. And I could sit here speechless at this point. And I'm going to play a few
[02:51:25.240 --> 02:51:31.040]  clips here before we go to our guest from the film. And we're going to go over all of it
[02:51:31.040 --> 02:51:41.480]  here today. But let's go ahead and play the clip of Gavin McGinnis reveals his nightmare
[02:51:41.480 --> 02:51:48.280]  situation. This is from the film that is going to be released in about an hour and eight
[02:51:48.280 --> 02:51:56.160]  minutes central time at you can't watch this.com. That is the main website. And censored movie
[02:51:56.160 --> 02:52:04.040]  commas we can go directly and watch it. And either watch it one time or you can buy the
[02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:08.200]  film and save it on your own device. And I would suggest you do that because this is
[02:52:08.200 --> 02:52:12.240]  a real fight for free space. And this is the only film that has been a very good film as
[02:52:12.240 --> 02:52:16.680]  well that even has the courage to cover this topic. Everybody else is scared. You either
[02:52:16.680 --> 02:52:20.960]  attack us or you're black balls. We'll talk to George about why he's done this and why
[02:52:20.960 --> 02:52:29.200]  he's had this courage in a moment. But here's that clip. So two neighbors put up these signs
[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:35.080]  that the leader of a hate group lives in our town. Oh no. So they put up the signs on my
[02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:41.120]  lawn that said hey does no home here. Instead of talking to me of course. And being known
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:45.800]  as a Nazi is the same as being known as a pedophile in today's society. If I heard there
[02:52:45.800 --> 02:52:50.640]  was a pedophile in my neighborhood I would not put a sign saying pedophiles have no home
[02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:59.000]  here. I'd knock at his door and go. So what's going on. What did you do. But I sent them
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:03.800]  all a letter. Not everyone because some of them weren't about me but I saw something
[02:53:03.800 --> 02:53:08.720]  where they said let's put the signs on his lawn and around his house and show him that
[02:53:08.720 --> 02:53:14.880]  hate has no home here. And again we're talking about a very shrill minority. Ninety five percent
[02:53:14.880 --> 02:53:20.760]  of the people in the burbs just want to raise their kids and not have any trouble. But there's
[02:53:20.760 --> 02:53:26.040]  a five percent of these bored rich housewives who have a nanny doing the loving and an au pair
[02:53:26.040 --> 02:53:30.480]  doing the driving and a maid doing the cleaning and the cooking. And the next thing you know
[02:53:30.480 --> 02:53:37.360]  they've got these octopus arms which I think all women have. They're building a multitasking
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:41.800]  and their octopus arms have no thing to do. So they just start being a busy body and meddling
[02:53:41.800 --> 02:53:48.720]  in your life. So they do that and then it just keeps getting worse. I mean they were
[02:53:48.720 --> 02:53:56.800]  vandalized in my car and they screamed obscenities in my house and planned a vigil on my front
[02:53:56.800 --> 02:54:03.520]  lawn. Just ridiculous. And so I put out a letter saying hey reach out to me I want to talk.
[02:54:03.520 --> 02:54:06.840]  You know what I was saying earlier. So again that's just some of what's in the film a lot
[02:54:06.840 --> 02:54:11.780]  of action a lot of other things but it's humanizing the people that have been censored. It's it's
[02:54:11.780 --> 02:54:17.680]  it's it's it's showing what's really happening. And so I wanted to go to George Lou Ellen one
[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:23.040]  of the directors and producers of the film to get into what made you make the plunge.
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:26.440]  There's obviously a lot of intimidation a lot of blackballing going on out there and
[02:54:26.440 --> 02:54:32.120]  try to make a classical liberal free speech film. And when did the left in your view basically
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:40.040]  abandon free speech. I think it happened a long time ago to be honest. I spent a fair
[02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:46.720]  amount of time working with people like Tommy Robinson. I haven't always agreed with them.
[02:54:46.720 --> 02:54:52.440]  It's kind of a job that I fell into. I actually got my start kind of interning at the BBC
[02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:59.040]  and kind of seeing how things would work there. That was a real wake up call. And I think
[02:54:59.040 --> 02:55:02.680]  from that it's kind of just been a gradual progression. You know a lot of the people
[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:07.560]  in this movie I still don't agree with on a lot of issues. But what's happening to
[02:55:07.560 --> 02:55:17.600]  them is scary. It's scary for me. I've always been in things like more controversial topics.
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:24.200]  I think those are the interesting discussions that we're having as a society. And so that's
[02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:28.520]  to be taken away from people who are involved in that conversation. I think that's it's
[02:55:28.520 --> 02:55:35.840]  a it's a it's a worrying worrying trend. Well I mean I look at the censorship going
[02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:40.800]  on and it's gotten cartoonish level like they're trying to act like villains. And then like
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:43.240]  I had the young lady on who they're trying to censor. He goes it's almost like it's
[02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:47.480]  on purpose. No it's not. We've gotten the internal emails. I've been in lawsuits with
[02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:53.000]  these people. They want to silence anyone they want. And you look at universities there's
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:56:00.720]  no free speech on those anymore. I mean it's just it's a total abandonment of any Western
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:08.000]  values. And I guess that's why the left is so allied with radical Islam now. Yeah I mean
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:12.920]  this is this is the thing you look at Facebook and one of the co-owners of Facebook the co-founders
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:17.880]  of Facebook this week was literally talking about how Facebook should be broken up because
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:23.320]  it's become too powerful. And there is the kind of libertarian argument that these are
[02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:26.960]  private companies they can do what they want. But one of the things that this movie goes
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:32.000]  on to explore that I think is so important is not just whether they're platforms or publishers
[02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:38.160]  but how much power do we want to afford a private company like Facebook how much power
[02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:43.320]  do we want to afford a company like Twitter because they literally by removing one person
[02:56:43.320 --> 02:56:48.120]  from the debate they're removing a huge number of people's ability to hear those arguments
[02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:54.120]  to hear that kind of that side of the story. I always believe that we we sharpen our wit
[02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:58.920]  by debating and arguing with people out in public. And you know I would I would rather
[02:56:58.920 --> 02:57:04.040]  my Nazi was not hidden away and banned off whatever platform it is you know if you're
[02:57:04.040 --> 02:57:08.680]  going to go to that level I would rather a Nazi was standing on a plinth in the middle
[02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:13.560]  of London espousing their views so that I could see them and say oh God no right I don't want
[02:57:13.560 --> 02:57:18.400]  to I don't want to know that I don't want to think about that I want to maybe push things
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:21.760]  in a different direction I'm going to engage with that person I think this person is wrong
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:28.120]  because of this issue and that that is how we as a society grow that's how as a culture
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:33.320]  America for example was was founded and that's how it grew to became exactly it's the opposite
[02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:38.960]  of Western culture hold on stay there George we're gonna be right back again it's May 15th
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:45.360]  2019 in one hour the film drops you can't watch this.
[02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:50.520]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:55.800]  we have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[02:57:55.800 --> 02:58:02.560]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways eye comfort and respiratory function
[02:58:02.560 --> 02:58:08.520]  in the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:13.920]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this effect in published
[02:58:13.920 --> 02:58:20.040]  trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast-acting chewable tablet
[02:58:20.040 --> 02:58:25.600]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is natural and effective it is
[02:58:25.600 --> 02:58:30.680]  not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually acts by blocking
[02:58:30.680 --> 02:58:36.080]  the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses
[02:58:36.080 --> 02:58:42.120]  in the body go outside and enjoy the air you breathe head to infowarslife.com and grab

[03:02:03.560 --> 03:02:09.840]  it's it's something that hasn't been covered in this depth or this detail before and the
[03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:14.600]  way that we've covered it is it's all about social media it's all about free speech the
[03:02:14.600 --> 03:02:20.360]  power that social media companies have on the constitution on the first amendment and

[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:26.520]  was very surprised coming to interview you and kind of learning a lot of new things about you
[03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:30.120]  that I didn't know and there's there's a lot of that stuff in the movie as well so this is
[03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:37.160]  more than just a movie about about a big issue right now it's it's a real insight into not
[03:03:37.160 --> 03:03:42.840]  just the issue but these these characters as as people as individuals so yeah sense of
[03:03:42.840 --> 03:03:47.720]  movie.com or you can't watch this.com I'm really really excited for people to see it.
[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:54.680]  Well I can't wait till they see the film I can't wait to see the response and you know I always
[03:03:54.680 --> 03:03:59.800]  just put films out for free and I'd sell DVDs to fund them but I would just put them out in general
[03:03:59.800 --> 03:04:02.840]  a lot of times you can't even do that now and I know you guys flow over the world to make this
[03:04:02.840 --> 03:04:07.560]  you spend a lot of money making it so people need to support you but I wonder because with five banned
[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:12.360]  individuals or even in this film I wonder if YouTube will even let us or let you put this up.
[03:04:13.880 --> 03:04:20.360]  Yeah it's it's it's a concern and we we've got kind of lots of backups as well it's currently
[03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:25.800]  being hosted on Vimeo on demand they've actually been really great with us surprisingly but we're
[03:04:25.800 --> 03:04:30.520]  we're worried so we're getting DVDs we're getting DVDs printed so we're going to have DVDs available
[03:04:30.520 --> 03:04:35.640]  very soon as well because we need that insurance policy we we want as many people to see this
[03:04:35.640 --> 03:04:44.040]  movie as possible. We've been scrimped and saved to make this movie so we kind of hopefully
[03:04:44.040 --> 03:04:47.480]  we'll get a bit of money back so that we can do something similar and deal with similar
[03:04:47.480 --> 03:04:51.960]  important issues but uh yeah DVDs are going to be a big thing. Well it's exciting George we're

[03:06:10.120 --> 03:06:26.040]  alex john
[03:06:26.040 --> 03:06:46.600]  all right folks we've got my cat is coming up with some news that i don't want to use the word
[03:06:46.600 --> 03:06:53.160]  incredible or epic or insane or nightmarish you know you'll watch a movie like silence of the lambs
[03:06:53.160 --> 03:06:57.880]  and oh she's going to eat your liver with a fine chianti
[03:07:00.440 --> 03:07:07.160]  and it's like oh so scary anthony hobkins eating your liver with a fine italian red wine
[03:07:08.600 --> 03:07:16.360]  and everyone oh it's so shocked by it but then accompanying like bear
[03:07:16.360 --> 03:07:28.920]  pharmaceuticals that work for hitler i should add knowingly over a decade works with hillary
[03:07:28.920 --> 03:07:35.320]  rottem clinton and bill clinton pays them millions of dollars through a canadian company
[03:07:35.320 --> 03:07:43.640]  to give them untested blood with hiv in it but certified as clean
[03:07:46.520 --> 03:07:53.160]  so they could give it to millions of people now why would you do that well it came out over
[03:07:53.160 --> 03:08:05.640]  a decade ago in the lawsuits the executive shed there are too many hemophiliacs you're like that
[03:08:05.640 --> 03:08:13.160]  doesn't make sense you know i never played this last friday do we have that clip off of what like
[03:08:13.160 --> 03:08:22.040]  abc news about the famous serial killer that would climb up in people's homes at night and murder
[03:08:22.040 --> 03:08:28.280]  their little 10 12 13 year old daughters like a vampire slit their throats just because they wanted
[03:08:28.280 --> 03:08:33.240]  to by the way these people are running the mill you're like well why would you do that because
[03:08:33.240 --> 03:08:42.680]  why would bear seek out dirty blood because when you're a demon you don't want money in the bank
[03:08:42.680 --> 03:08:51.240]  your daddy lucifer gives you fun coins uh come when you go to the david bussards you get the
[03:08:51.240 --> 03:08:55.640]  tickets you to go get little toys and stuff you're like you know kids want that you don't want that
[03:08:56.440 --> 03:09:00.280]  psychopaths don't want to slit your kids throat and then watch them beg for mommy
[03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:06.360]  because they get the energy from it and all these mass murders they try to keep it out of
[03:09:06.360 --> 03:09:09.720]  the liberal news well i've talked to the top psychiatrists that actually interview them
[03:09:11.240 --> 03:09:14.680]  at the end of the day they say no i have nightmares demons are attacking me they're only nice when i
[03:09:14.680 --> 03:09:22.040]  kill children they kill children because demons want them to and remember the governor of virginia
[03:09:22.040 --> 03:09:27.400]  and governor in new york are legalizing killing babies after they're born because that's their
[03:09:27.400 --> 03:09:39.160]  religion and so those of us that aren't into this were like that doesn't make sense but because you
[03:09:39.160 --> 03:09:47.480]  don't want to climb a second story house this little a little girl's throat you don't understand
[03:09:47.480 --> 03:09:53.080]  that whatever this entity is that runs these people it likes to kill babies it likes to suck
[03:09:53.080 --> 03:09:57.960]  their energy you keep saying that doesn't make sense yeah because you're not a you're not demon
[03:09:57.960 --> 03:10:03.480]  possessed so there's this there's there's thousands of these serial killers let's just play one of
[03:10:03.480 --> 03:10:09.960]  these guys you say why would he do that why would bear one blood with hiv and hepatitis well they're
[03:10:09.960 --> 03:10:19.960]  executive said we want to kill people and if we've got a governor selling it to us then the u.s
[03:10:19.960 --> 03:10:25.560]  government especially when he becomes president will never get actress for other stuff with our drugs
[03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:33.400]  if we have a governor paid 10 million to certify blood is clean that they know isn't
[03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:41.560]  now you get into their sick mind game well these guys get together at a golf course or
[03:10:41.560 --> 03:10:47.480]  something man they are just the power that gives them the husbands and wives and their
[03:10:47.480 --> 03:10:52.920]  daughters and sons dying and begging for mommy and bleeding to death you understand
[03:10:52.920 --> 03:10:58.280]  to a governor northam or governor clinton this is you don't understand their god this is like
[03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:09.640]  beautiful music to them hurting you is their music and you have to get in their mind so so
[03:11:09.640 --> 03:11:15.960]  here's a clip of one of their dumber sons because you know the smart ones become a governor or they
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:20.760]  you know run operations the dumb ones just climb in your roof at night and slit your
[03:11:20.760 --> 03:11:26.440]  daughter's throat here this the first time i killed somebody and it was such a rush
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:33.400]  tommy lin cells one of the most infamous serial killers in modern history a man who says he belongs
[03:11:33.400 --> 03:11:42.920]  on death row i was raised to do time i wasn't raised to live out there in in that world cells
[03:11:42.920 --> 03:11:48.760]  was convicted of killing 13 year old katie harris stabbing her to death in her bedroom i like to use
[03:11:48.760 --> 03:11:59.160]  a knife a gun is too too violent too too too noisy but just hit pause feel my they understand you
[03:11:59.160 --> 03:12:05.240]  give someone hiv and hepatitis and it kills them over 10 years and you get all their money
[03:12:05.240 --> 03:12:09.800]  ooh that's even slicker it's kind of like a gladiator he kills four days real quick
[03:12:09.800 --> 03:12:14.920]  the guy goes listen you got to chop them up slowly this has got to be done art you understand the art
[03:12:14.920 --> 03:12:21.800]  the art of getting doctors to give your kids stuff that'll give them hiv and then watching your kids
[03:12:21.800 --> 03:12:28.200]  spend all the money on the drugs and watching them die that is an work of art to a satanist let's
[03:12:28.200 --> 03:12:35.480]  continue and later he admitted to killing dozens more so many he says he can't even keep track i'm
[03:12:35.480 --> 03:12:44.760]  not billy the kid making notches on on my my poster so i know it's been a lot addicted to killing is
[03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:51.800]  the way he characterized it i don't have a one and off switch i'm just after that drug i'm after that
[03:12:54.920 --> 03:13:01.800]  feeling nightline interviewed cells on death row in 2010 one of the rare glimpses into the mind
[03:13:01.800 --> 03:13:13.560]  of a serial killer it's complicated it's when people in my life they get hurt cells is directly
[03:13:13.560 --> 03:13:18.840]  linked to over a dozen murders the drifter's vagrant lifestyle helped him elude police for
[03:13:18.840 --> 03:13:25.160]  nearly 15 years as victims turned up from coast to coast when you look at me you know what hate is
[03:13:25.160 --> 03:13:32.520]  is because i don't know what love is two words i don't like to use is love and sorry because i'm
[03:13:32.520 --> 03:13:38.920]  about hate his methods for killing were as random as the people he targeted he raped many before
[03:13:38.920 --> 03:13:45.000]  cutting their throats or beating them stabbing others he strangled some a lot of jerking a lot
[03:13:45.000 --> 03:13:53.400]  of movement it's a physical you become part of it and described it all with seeming detachment
[03:13:53.400 --> 03:14:03.240]  from the horrors he caused i don't have no feelings no more no emotion no and no remorse
[03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:12.360]  and i like to watch the eyes fade the pupil fade it's just like setting their soul free we asked
[03:14:12.360 --> 03:14:17.400]  cells what would happen if we said something that angered him if we was in a fight and
[03:14:17.400 --> 03:14:26.840]  you don't get your head down in the concrete then you know so bit but well what do you think
[03:14:26.840 --> 03:14:32.600]  happened it cracks like a coconut so how did he become this monster cells blames much of his
[03:14:32.600 --> 03:14:39.160]  murderous rage on sexual abuse he says he suffered as a child i think every time so you see he's a
[03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:44.760]  ghoul he doesn't have any feelings when he goes out and kills though the demon takes over and he
[03:14:44.760 --> 03:14:49.960]  gets the he feels that energy when we come back my cat was thinking over i want to finish up
[03:14:49.960 --> 03:14:53.480]  with him describing going in a bedroom and slitting little girl's throats
[03:14:55.800 --> 03:15:00.360]  now it's on record they've convicted them they've got undercover video a lot of these abortion
[03:15:00.360 --> 03:15:05.240]  doctors especially third trimester they have sex with the baby while it's still alive they have
[03:15:05.240 --> 03:15:10.360]  satanic rights they drug the mothers the mothers catch them it's come out in the news the police
[03:15:10.360 --> 03:15:15.320]  raid it there's body parts in their office films with the doctors having sex with the corpses
[03:15:15.320 --> 03:15:19.640]  and that comes out in court but not in the news the news doesn't touch it but from texas to
[03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:25.800]  missouri to new york to california these devil worshipers are running these third trimester
[03:15:25.800 --> 03:15:31.880]  facilities not just selling the bodies they rape them and they get the baby out they run down the
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:38.040]  hall and then they just have a they rape the baby then they drink his blood again when i come back
[03:15:38.040 --> 03:15:43.160]  i'll show you one of their little minions talking about slitting little girl's throats and how much

[03:20:21.720 --> 03:20:29.000]  killers mass murderers this article bombshell bear discovers black ops division run by monsanto
[03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:33.320]  shuts it down initiates internal investigation his law enforcement prepares criminal charges
[03:20:33.320 --> 03:20:38.360]  against the chemical giant that's a national news dot com it's also been published to info wars
[03:20:38.360 --> 03:20:42.840]  dot com and if you know about bear's whole background it's a eugenics organization so
[03:20:42.840 --> 03:20:50.360]  is monsanto this is huge he's taking over right now but i wanted to finish up with just one serial
[03:20:50.360 --> 03:20:55.640]  killer of thousands about the energy he would suck out of people when he'd kill him so they
[03:20:55.640 --> 03:21:02.280]  understand what bear and monsanto are doing on a wider scale this is on purpose this isn't greed
[03:21:02.280 --> 03:21:08.920]  this isn't arrogance this is medicine being taken over by pure evil here it is i tried to get in
[03:21:08.920 --> 03:21:15.640]  this door right here it was katie harris's murder that finally ended his killing spree two days later
[03:21:15.640 --> 03:21:21.240]  tomi lin sells walked police through the crime scene and i opened the window all the way up
[03:21:21.240 --> 03:21:30.280]  we're about like this we kind of stayed up a little later and we got in a little fight about
[03:21:30.280 --> 03:21:35.800]  where we were all going to sleep we laid there and talked about um we talked about the time like
[03:21:35.800 --> 03:21:42.440]  britney spears and in sync crystal searls ten years old at the time is one of his few survivors
[03:21:42.440 --> 03:21:47.720]  she was sleeping over at katie's house that night more than a decade later it's all still
[03:21:47.720 --> 03:21:55.160]  fresh in her memory i woke up startled a little bit and out of nowhere and i was kind of confused
[03:21:55.160 --> 03:22:03.160]  um to a loud noise i woke this girl up her friend katie was asleep on the bottom bunk
[03:22:03.720 --> 03:22:10.040]  i cut her bra and i could see that there was a scary old older man that i'd never seen before
[03:22:10.600 --> 03:22:18.600]  i stacked her here and then she like jumped back and then i cut her like like this right here
[03:22:18.600 --> 03:22:25.320]  he had a hand on her mouth and the knife on her neck and she's looking at me and he just
[03:22:25.320 --> 03:22:31.720]  cut her throat and she fell to the ground she fell down right here thirteen year old katie harris
[03:22:31.720 --> 03:22:37.160]  laid dying on the floor he was about to shut off the light and he looked one last time and he
[03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:42.440]  noticed that i was there and he didn't hesitate at all i mean just shut the door came right back
[03:22:42.440 --> 03:22:47.720]  towards me with the knife i walked over here and i went like this the only thing that he said is
[03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:53.080]  move your hands because i had him up here and he reached over the top bunk and cut my cut my neck
[03:22:55.080 --> 03:23:00.200]  sell sliced crystals neck severing her windpipe and gracing her carotid artery
[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:04.760]  i am a stop there i'm gonna mike take over i appreciate him doing the fourth hour uh he
[03:23:04.760 --> 03:23:09.400]  understands i wanted to segue into this so again you can all dig a research about criminology
[03:23:09.400 --> 03:23:15.000]  the really smart ones get in control bayer knowingly gave millions hiv and hepatitis
[03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:20.680]  monsanto knowingly does all this and if you understand these people you understand it all
[03:23:20.680 --> 03:23:26.200]  the anti-human exterminist program mike adams takes over this story is so huge it's all breaking
[03:23:27.160 --> 03:23:31.320]  this is an incredible time to be alive and make no mistakes because trump is in office mike adams
[03:23:32.440 --> 03:23:38.760]  okay bayer is freaking out because of the multi-billion dollar jury damage decisions
[03:23:38.760 --> 03:23:43.160]  that are now threatening to bankrupt financially annihilate bayer because of its acquisition of
[03:23:43.160 --> 03:23:51.560]  monsanto it took on all of this uh well this this coming debt all all the damage that glyphosate
[03:23:51.560 --> 03:23:56.920]  a roundup has done to people over the last you know four decades or so is now coming to bear
[03:23:58.120 --> 03:24:06.360]  and and bayer is being forced to pay out what could be a trillion dollars because there are 13,400
[03:24:06.360 --> 03:24:15.240]  lawsuits pending now against bayer over monsanto's crimes against humanity now bear is receiving by
[03:24:15.240 --> 03:24:22.600]  my estimate 20 to 30 new lawsuits a day i mean imagine that alex you you've been sued you know
[03:24:22.600 --> 03:24:28.760]  many times by many people but imagine getting 20 to 30 new lawsuits a day every business day that's
[03:24:28.760 --> 03:24:34.200]  what bayer is subjected to because of their acquisition of monsanto well bayer began an
[03:24:34.200 --> 03:24:42.520]  internal investigation of monsanto i think bayer uh was tricked in a way i think monsanto committed
[03:24:42.520 --> 03:24:49.240]  fraud during its acquisition and probably hid many elements from bayer by committing an internal
[03:24:49.240 --> 03:24:55.160]  money laundering and financial fraud to hide what i'm calling the black ops division of monsanto
[03:24:55.160 --> 03:25:02.600]  which bayer has now become aware of so bayer has issued a public apology on may 12th just a few
[03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:09.160]  days ago this is in the link in the story that's now on info wars dot com bayer's statement saying
[03:25:09.160 --> 03:25:17.000]  that they will work with law enforcement and the investigations into the criminality saying that they
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:23.400]  shut down this black ops division of monsanto saying that they fired the former monsanto operators
[03:25:23.400 --> 03:25:31.320]  and that they regret that this black ops division was running hit lists of journalists and lawmakers
[03:25:31.320 --> 03:25:37.320]  and my name has been on that so-called hit list for many many years yours too alex uh the food babe
[03:25:37.320 --> 03:25:43.560]  jeffrey smith joseph mercola many others everybody who has criticized monsanto and has had influence
[03:25:43.560 --> 03:25:50.120]  has been on that list well now bayer is trying to make amends because they are desperate they
[03:25:50.120 --> 03:25:56.520]  know that the juries that are making these decisions which will bankrupt bayer the juries read websites
[03:25:56.520 --> 03:26:03.080]  like natural news and they read info wars dot com and they read uh mercola dot com or uh responsible
[03:26:03.080 --> 03:26:07.960]  technology and as you said this is total vindication because i remember 20 years ago being threatened
[03:26:07.960 --> 03:26:13.160]  bomb on santo about roundup and all of it's coming out all of it's coming out about bayer
[03:26:14.040 --> 03:26:18.040]  and bayer as you said it's right here in the article but it's getting no coverage they like hey
[03:26:18.040 --> 03:26:22.760]  there's a secret group we didn't know this was happening but well of course monsanto is literally
[03:26:22.760 --> 03:26:29.160]  monsanto is literally the eugenics black ops command base and and who's involved uh bill gates
[03:26:29.160 --> 03:26:34.360]  all of it it's all beginning to come down this is incredible i i am now starting to go public
[03:26:34.360 --> 03:26:39.320]  with with this show and there's a lot more coming out over the next few days and i am saying publicly
[03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:46.680]  i'm going to kind of stick my neck out here i am saying i will meet with bayer's independent law firm
[03:26:46.680 --> 03:26:52.440]  that's going to run this internal investigation as long as my lawyers are present i will meet with them
[03:26:52.440 --> 03:26:58.600]  and i will detail all of the crimes the intimidation the coercion the threats the defamation the
[03:26:59.320 --> 03:27:04.600]  death squads that i believe are run by monsanto or were were run by monsanto before this was
[03:27:04.600 --> 03:27:10.840]  shut down i will detail all that to bayer if they want to know but they need to publicly apologize
[03:27:10.840 --> 03:27:17.400]  by name to all of us who have been victimized who have been targeted by these monsanto black
[03:27:17.400 --> 03:27:24.280]  ops over all of these years bayer needs to come clean otherwise i think that the juries of the
[03:27:24.280 --> 03:27:28.920]  united states and remember there are 13 000 plus pending cases i think the juries are going to
[03:27:28.920 --> 03:27:35.720]  continue to see bayer as just as evil as monsanto bayer needs to apologize and you know bayer has
[03:27:35.720 --> 03:27:39.320]  got a whole history of evil as you've talked about i mean they are about to say the only great more
[03:27:39.320 --> 03:27:45.160]  evil than than than bayer's monsanto how would bayer get induced to buy a company like this
[03:27:45.160 --> 03:27:48.680]  in the middle of it being admitted that it causes cancer with its main product
[03:27:48.680 --> 03:27:53.960]  something weird's going on here well they thought that they could influence the juries maybe buy
[03:27:53.960 --> 03:27:59.880]  off the judges threaten the journalists well guess what the media has now turned against
[03:27:59.880 --> 03:28:05.000]  monsanto this has just happened with this third court decision mainstream media now the same media
[03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:09.400]  that used to apologize for monsanto and say glyphosate was perfectly remember we were the
[03:28:09.400 --> 03:28:13.640]  conspiracy theorist we used to get taken off youtube and stuff oh glyphosate's good for you
[03:28:13.640 --> 03:28:19.400]  you yeah exactly well now the media is saying that glyphosate is linked to cancer there's
[03:28:19.400 --> 03:28:25.000]  going to be a snowball effect here alex a bayer is going to get hit with an even accelerated
[03:28:25.000 --> 03:28:28.680]  schedule of more lawsuits because there are people with cancer all across the country
[03:28:28.680 --> 03:28:32.760]  who are just now come and realize that it's because of roundup and glyphosate that they have
[03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:38.280]  cancer they're going to be thousand for those who don't know any cancer doctor will tell you
[03:28:38.280 --> 03:28:48.600]  it's a fact roundup grows cancers mike adams takes over with this huge news folks this is so huge

[03:33:29.080 --> 03:33:35.160]  details here in the fourth hour of the alex jones show i'm mike adams and both alex and myself
[03:33:35.720 --> 03:33:42.280]  were targeted by monsanto black ops teams over the last 10 plus years and bayer which
[03:33:42.280 --> 03:33:48.360]  acquired monsanto uh roughly a year ago has discovered that monsanto was running this
[03:33:48.360 --> 03:33:54.360]  black ops division and bayer says they've shut it down and bayer has posted a public apology
[03:33:54.360 --> 03:33:59.480]  there's a lot more to this story the full details are currently posted at info wars dot com and my
[03:33:59.480 --> 03:34:04.760]  site natural news dot com here's the headline just to get you into this bayer discovers black ops
[03:34:04.760 --> 03:34:11.320]  division run by monsanto shuts it down initiates an internal investigation as law enforcement
[03:34:11.320 --> 03:34:17.960]  prepares criminal charges against the chemical giant so this story quotes reuters as well as
[03:34:17.960 --> 03:34:24.840]  bayer dot com bayer posted a statement on may 12th in response to what had been uncovered
[03:34:24.840 --> 03:34:29.800]  by a group in france that found out that its journalists and investigators were being targeted
[03:34:29.800 --> 03:34:35.880]  on a hit list that was maintained by the monsanto what i'm calling the black ops division of
[03:34:35.880 --> 03:34:41.720]  monsanto now the u.s. right to no organization out in california had used foyer requests
[03:34:41.720 --> 03:34:47.080]  over the last couple of years to uncover a lot of the details about this black ops group
[03:34:47.080 --> 03:34:52.680]  for example uncovering the fact that they spent millions of dollars uh trying to target specific
[03:34:52.680 --> 03:34:57.880]  journalists and activists in the united states including myself and food babe and that they
[03:34:57.880 --> 03:35:04.440]  would hire negative pr firms to run smear campaigns defamation campaigns they would bribe journalists
[03:35:04.440 --> 03:35:09.640]  and they would run paid wikipedia editors to publish false smears about you and then get
[03:35:09.640 --> 03:35:15.880]  those smears repeated it in the press using a scheme that i call the wikipedia shuffle
[03:35:15.880 --> 03:35:21.000]  which i will explain here in an upcoming segment this is how they smear you and try to create
[03:35:21.000 --> 03:35:25.320]  facts out of lies and this is the same kind of deep state operation that they've run against
[03:35:25.320 --> 03:35:31.560]  alex jones and of course against uh president trump as well so bayer became aware of this
[03:35:31.560 --> 03:35:37.880]  after they acquired monsanto i believe it looks to me like monsanto committed a major fraud that
[03:35:37.880 --> 03:35:44.040]  it's managers and perhaps certain shareholders committed fraud and hid these facts from bayer
[03:35:44.040 --> 03:35:49.480]  now bayer has its own evil history of being involved with i g farben and the third rike
[03:35:49.480 --> 03:35:55.400]  and the holocaust actually running medical chemical weapons experiments on jewish prisoners
[03:35:55.400 --> 03:36:00.440]  of war during during the holocaust that's the real history of bayer i mean bayer's chairperson
[03:36:00.440 --> 03:36:05.320]  was sentenced to prison by the in the nuremberg trials for crimes against humanity that's real
[03:36:06.040 --> 03:36:11.560]  and bayer has apologized for its role in the holocaust by the way well now in acquiring
[03:36:11.560 --> 03:36:19.000]  monsanto bayer has inherited not only the legal liability of monsanto and its toxic deadly cancer
[03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:25.400]  causing roundup product i.e. glyphosate roundup is just the brand name glyphosate is the world's
[03:36:25.400 --> 03:36:32.280]  number one weed killer and now three juries in the united states have found bayer because it owns
[03:36:32.280 --> 03:36:38.680]  monsanto liable for the cancers specifically non-hodgkins lymphoma cancers that have been
[03:36:38.680 --> 03:36:47.720]  caused by monsanto's products now bayer acquired monsanto for anywhere from 63 billion to 66.6
[03:36:47.720 --> 03:36:52.760]  billion depending on you know which figure you believe uh there's some different interpretations
[03:36:52.760 --> 03:36:58.920]  of the exact amount but it's in the it's in the 60 billion dollar range what bayer did not realize
[03:36:58.920 --> 03:37:05.000]  is that they were taking hold of over a trillion dollars in potential liability that could financially
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:11.080]  annihilate the bayer company so since they acquired monsanto in the months since then
[03:37:11.080 --> 03:37:18.520]  bayer has lost 40 percent of its stock value it has collapsed to the point where bayer's shareholders
[03:37:18.520 --> 03:37:23.800]  are panicking and they're demanding bayer do something i believe it is in the aftermath of
[03:37:23.800 --> 03:37:31.320]  that demand and a vote of no confidence against bayer's ceo that bayer began an internal investigation
[03:37:31.320 --> 03:37:37.080]  to try to find out what the heck did they acquire when they acquired monsanto and it turns out
[03:37:37.080 --> 03:37:42.920]  bayer discovered that monsanto was running a black ops division with hit lists and with i believe
[03:37:42.920 --> 03:37:49.880]  actual wet work death squads that have targeted myself and others in the industry and i am willing
[03:37:49.880 --> 03:37:55.880]  to testify to that in front of bayer's new legal team that they have hired to investigate monsanto
[03:37:56.760 --> 03:38:03.240]  isn't this interesting this is all coming out so now bayer is trying to fight for its own survival
[03:38:03.240 --> 03:38:08.520]  bayer knows that the juries in the united states are going to continue to punish the company
[03:38:08.520 --> 03:38:15.160]  for the evil that monsanto committed this evil is worth billions of dollars in the minds of the jury
[03:38:15.880 --> 03:38:22.040]  it the jury you know that the science of all this is debated by bayer you know bayer's lawyers
[03:38:22.040 --> 03:38:27.240]  say that life is eight is perfectly safe in their minds the juries have decided it's not safe the
[03:38:27.240 --> 03:38:31.640]  juries have decided it causes cancer but more importantly the juries have tacked on in this
[03:38:31.640 --> 03:38:38.680]  latest case a billion dollars of punitive damages against bayer because of how evil the corporation
[03:38:38.680 --> 03:38:44.520]  is well what bayer is just starting to realize is that a lot of these jurists no doubt have read
[03:38:45.080 --> 03:38:51.400]  info wars or have read natural news or have read the food babe or have read us right to know or
[03:38:51.400 --> 03:38:56.200]  other groups that have been telling the truth about monsanto and its coverups and its deadly
[03:38:56.200 --> 03:39:03.000]  products all these years and so these juries can financially annihilate bayer and they are actually
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:09.240]  in the process of doing that and if bayer doesn't stop this hemorrhaging bayer is going to be obliterated
[03:39:09.240 --> 03:39:14.200]  financially again over a trillion dollars in potential liability so this is why i believe
[03:39:14.200 --> 03:39:21.080]  bayer has appointed a person now named mathias berninger and this is in my story there on info
[03:39:21.080 --> 03:39:28.680]  wars dot com uh or mathias sorry mathias berninger if i have the pronunciation correct uh who spoke
[03:39:28.680 --> 03:39:34.440]  to reuters which covered this as well and also put out the statement at media dot bayer dot com
[03:39:34.440 --> 03:39:41.480]  this is on bayer's website where berninger apologizes and admits that they sought to
[03:39:41.480 --> 03:39:47.000]  destroy individuals journalists and lawmakers and regulators and that they kept hit lists of
[03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:54.280]  hundreds of names and he says that they acquired non-public information and he says that this was
[03:39:54.280 --> 03:39:59.480]  wrong he apologizes and he says that bayer is going to cooperate with law enforcement's
[03:39:59.480 --> 03:40:04.920]  investigations and now the law enforcement authorities in france have begun criminal
[03:40:04.920 --> 03:40:13.800]  investigations into bayer for this what i believe is extremely criminal behavior that is it's it's
[03:40:13.800 --> 03:40:20.520]  this is like a mafia death squad intimidation campaign that targeted journalists and scientists
[03:40:20.520 --> 03:40:26.680]  and lawmakers and regulators and destroyed people in some cases i believe physically harmed them or
[03:40:26.680 --> 03:40:33.320]  even killed them and i i i do believe that bayer had no idea that this was going on in monsanto
[03:40:33.320 --> 03:40:37.400]  not excusing anything about bayer's history they've done plenty of evil themselves but i think they
[03:40:37.400 --> 03:40:43.400]  were hoodwinked i think they had no idea what monsanto was doing and i think they now have a
[03:40:43.400 --> 03:40:49.000]  crisis on their hands that is about to explode globally you know why because all of us that
[03:40:49.000 --> 03:40:55.320]  monsanto tried to silence and coerce and destroy our reputations and even in some cases they tried
[03:40:55.320 --> 03:41:01.000]  to physically threaten or even kill some of us we are still alive and we are still talking and we
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:06.760]  have big platforms and we have a lot of followers and we are demanding an apology from bayer and
[03:41:06.760 --> 03:41:11.640]  we are not going to be silent about this because this is you know this isn't of course as big as
[03:41:11.640 --> 03:41:17.880]  the holocaust when bayer was complicit in the mass murder of six million jews but this is in the same
[03:41:17.880 --> 03:41:24.040]  kind of evil spirit as that which is destroying the lives of innocent people for corporate profits
[03:41:24.040 --> 03:41:30.840]  and we're not letting this go i have my legal team reaching out today to bayer's legal team
[03:41:31.480 --> 03:41:37.240]  to demand public apologies and demand that bayer come clean with the crimes that were carried out
[03:41:37.240 --> 03:41:45.480]  by monsanto and that bayer retract the smears and the the defamation articles that they put out
[03:41:45.480 --> 03:41:50.520]  there that were republished by the liberal media with outrageous lies about all of us who are
[03:41:50.520 --> 03:41:56.360]  anti-gmo activists as we're called and by the way isn't it interesting that this is happening at the
[03:41:56.360 --> 03:42:04.760]  same time that the deep state is now about to get hammered by william bar and the trump administration
[03:42:04.760 --> 03:42:11.160]  officials who are exposing the treason and the criminality of the deep state this is an amazing
[03:42:11.160 --> 03:42:16.120]  time to be alive and it's an amazing time to tune in to info wars dot com or any of us in the

[03:46:53.160 --> 03:47:09.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:09.000 --> 03:47:21.480]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with mike adams
[03:47:24.360 --> 03:47:29.800]  there is facing financial annihilation unless it cleans up this monsanto mess that it has
[03:47:29.800 --> 03:47:36.680]  inherited it's probably the worst acquisition decision ever in the history of corporations
[03:47:36.680 --> 03:47:43.800]  they purchased monsanto for 60 plus billion dollars and inherited a trillion dollar liability
[03:47:44.360 --> 03:47:50.440]  and a black ops division that has been running criminal coercion and violence operations against
[03:47:50.440 --> 03:47:55.960]  journalists and regulators and lawmakers all around the world european authorities are already
[03:47:55.960 --> 03:48:01.640]  aware of this now law enforcement investigations have begun and according to reports in reuters it's
[03:48:01.640 --> 03:48:07.800]  going to spread to other european nations now remember that bayer is a german company it's
[03:48:07.800 --> 03:48:12.680]  an offshoot of ig farben which was and worked with adolf hitler in the third right that's a
[03:48:12.680 --> 03:48:17.960]  a true part of history well this means that the united kingdom is going to be looking at this as
[03:48:17.960 --> 03:48:25.160]  well as german authorities themselves wondering why did a german corporation acquire an american
[03:48:25.160 --> 03:48:32.520]  company that has been running a criminal black ops unit for over a decade that's a big question for
[03:48:32.520 --> 03:48:38.120]  german officials french officials uk officials as well as us officials and it's interesting to me
[03:48:38.120 --> 03:48:44.920]  that in the united states juries i think took it a little bit easier on monsanto when monsanto was
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:50.040]  a u.s corporation now that monsanto has been acquired by a german corporation and is owned by
[03:48:50.040 --> 03:48:57.640]  bayer it seems that u.s juries are punishing this corporation far more than they would have
[03:48:57.640 --> 03:49:03.160]  otherwise so in other words it's like the monsanto court cases the juries are finding these multi
[03:49:03.160 --> 03:49:09.320]  billion dollar awards because bayer is a german corporation perhaps with a history of involvement
[03:49:09.320 --> 03:49:17.560]  in the third rike and the actual holocaust the chemical murder the mass murder of jews that's
[03:49:17.560 --> 03:49:21.960]  the true history that they don't want you to remember for the trying to bury history as quickly
[03:49:21.960 --> 03:49:31.000]  as possible now i'm going to introduce you today to what i call the wikipedia shuffle explain how
[03:49:31.000 --> 03:49:37.400]  this works this is something that monsanto did to smear all of the activists using wikipedia
[03:49:37.400 --> 03:49:44.600]  here's how it works first they bribed wikipedia editors to fabricate a fake smear i'm going to
[03:49:44.600 --> 03:49:50.440]  use a fake name as an example for this let's say there's somebody out there named food bob not the
[03:49:50.440 --> 03:49:55.640]  food babe but food bob it's fictitious i don't know anybody named food bob but let's say they
[03:49:55.640 --> 03:50:02.040]  want to smear food bob so the bribe wikipedia editors to put something on food bob's wikipedia
[03:50:02.040 --> 03:50:07.880]  page that claims food bob was busted for i don't know child pornography or anything they could
[03:50:07.880 --> 03:50:13.080]  make up anything maybe he hired prostitutes to urinate on hotel beds in russia right i mean
[03:50:13.080 --> 03:50:19.160]  this kind of thing so then those same people who coordinated this who were working for monsanto
[03:50:19.160 --> 03:50:27.560]  then they push this citation on wikipedia out to other left wing media outlets that they know
[03:50:27.560 --> 03:50:33.320]  will publish this information and then those left wing media outlets in some cases have editors who
[03:50:33.320 --> 03:50:39.800]  are also on the payroll so they publish a story that cites the wikipedia entry so you you know i'm
[03:50:39.800 --> 03:50:43.480]  not going to name names but you know all the typical left wing rags they're out there and they'll say
[03:50:43.480 --> 03:50:50.040]  well food bob was busted for child porn then the original editors back at wikipedia delete
[03:50:50.040 --> 03:50:55.160]  their original fabrication because they can't support it it may have only existed on the wikipedia
[03:50:55.160 --> 03:51:02.600]  page for two hours instead they now cite the new left wing media story that originally cited the
[03:51:02.600 --> 03:51:09.160]  fake wikipedia falsehood because now that it's cited by a left wing media publisher it's considered
[03:51:09.160 --> 03:51:16.680]  what a fact so it's now a fact this is how they launder a lie into a fact and they've done this
[03:51:16.680 --> 03:51:21.080]  to donald trump they've done this to alex jones they've done this to julian assange they've done
[03:51:21.080 --> 03:51:25.960]  it to everybody all of us who are clean food advocates and independent journalists they've
[03:51:25.960 --> 03:51:31.480]  done it to shell ackison you know everybody edward snowden you name it it's called the wikipedia
[03:51:31.480 --> 03:51:38.440]  shuffle and it allows wikipedia to have all these lies and smears about people who are targeted by
[03:51:39.400 --> 03:51:44.040]  the the biotech deep state the vaccine deep state the political deep state the financial
[03:51:44.040 --> 03:51:50.040]  deep state the military industrial deep state any of these organizations that can have control
[03:51:50.040 --> 03:51:54.920]  over wikipedia editors this is how they do it it's kind of like an editorial bait and switch
[03:51:54.920 --> 03:52:01.800]  operation this is one reason why section 230 of the cda needs to be completely reformed or shut
[03:52:01.800 --> 03:52:07.880]  down because wikipedia has absolute legal immunity to publish outright smears about any political
[03:52:07.880 --> 03:52:15.160]  targets and monanto ran this operation for 10 years plus they did this and bayer has only now
[03:52:15.160 --> 03:52:21.160]  started to figure it out so that's how the wikipedia shuffle works now getting back to bayer
[03:52:21.160 --> 03:52:27.880]  and what they're going to have to do in this case remember bayer manufacturers not just now
[03:52:27.880 --> 03:52:33.240]  glyphosate and agricultural chemicals but pharmaceuticals as well as over-the-counter
[03:52:33.240 --> 03:52:38.200]  medicines and they have a big agricultural division too you know fertilizers and such not
[03:52:38.200 --> 03:52:44.760]  just pesticides and herbicides bayer has all these divisions every one of these divisions
[03:52:44.760 --> 03:52:50.840]  is now at risk because of bayer's acquisition of monanto and because of all the liability that
[03:52:50.840 --> 03:52:54.600]  comes with that because of all the lies that have been discovered in other words bayer just
[03:52:54.600 --> 03:53:01.880]  acquired a poison which is ironic because of course monanto has been poisoning the world
[03:53:01.880 --> 03:53:09.240]  for decades and now monanto has become poison to bayer remember monanto created agent orange
[03:53:09.240 --> 03:53:15.720]  an agent orange was a chemical weapon that was deployed against unarmed civilians as a weapon
[03:53:15.720 --> 03:53:21.880]  of mass destruction during the vietnam war and even many us veterans were exposed to agent orange
[03:53:21.880 --> 03:53:26.440]  that's monanto there are many other chemicals over the years and they've used the same thing
[03:53:26.440 --> 03:53:32.440]  time and time again to intimidate scientists to bribe journalists to run black ops for decades this
[03:53:32.440 --> 03:53:38.600]  isn't new and guess where the monanto black ops guess where they got their training you'll find
[03:53:38.600 --> 03:53:45.400]  this interesting big tobacco big tobacco ran the same thing from the 1940s all the way up
[03:53:45.400 --> 03:53:51.960]  through the early 1990s before the the major settlements with the government big tobacco
[03:53:51.960 --> 03:53:58.520]  ran the same exact campaigns and in many cases it was the same exact people and big tobacco
[03:53:58.520 --> 03:54:04.520]  would threaten and intimidate the scientists and the whistleblowers even those inside big tobacco
[03:54:04.520 --> 03:54:08.840]  that were saying hey cigarette smoking promotes heart disease promotes cancer you know promotes
[03:54:08.840 --> 03:54:15.240]  all these problems it's toxic but they were able to pay off the american medical association
[03:54:15.240 --> 03:54:19.560]  which is why you can go back to the journal of the american medical association jama
[03:54:19.560 --> 03:54:27.160]  back to the issues in the 1950s and perhaps even in the 1960s full page ads said doctors recommend
[03:54:27.160 --> 03:54:32.200]  camels or doctors smoke camels more than any other cigarette or something something like that
[03:54:32.200 --> 03:54:40.920]  doctors recommend camels cigarettes because the am a had been corrupted and infested in a sense
[03:54:40.920 --> 03:54:47.800]  by the same operatives who convinced doctors that smoking cigarettes was good for you these are the
[03:54:47.800 --> 03:54:53.000]  same exact people who are now saying that eating glyphosate contaminated food is good for you
[03:54:53.720 --> 03:54:59.080]  and it's the same criminal operations that has been throughout history so isn't it fascinating
[03:54:59.080 --> 03:55:05.560]  that here we are the independent media we are uncovering this i got to tell you these multi
[03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:10.680]  billion dollar jury decisions against bayer would never have been possible without the existence
[03:55:10.680 --> 03:55:17.080]  of info wars or natural news or you know the food babes website or all these other websites out there
[03:55:17.080 --> 03:55:22.200]  that have been exposing this marcolla.com uh and you know jeffrey smith that i mentioned him even
[03:55:22.200 --> 03:55:28.520]  organic consumers association many others over all the years us right to know we changed the
[03:55:28.520 --> 03:55:36.600]  conversation we educated the public and that made us a threat in the minds of the evil operators
[03:55:36.600 --> 03:55:42.360]  inside monsanto and that's when they pulled the trigger and i believe launched the actual death
[03:55:42.360 --> 03:55:49.400]  squads the coercion campaigns the intimidation the bribery defamation smears a character assassination
[03:55:49.400 --> 03:55:55.160]  professional assassination they got scientists blacklisted from the entire industry of science
[03:55:56.120 --> 03:56:01.400]  and it's the same tactic they use back in big tobacco but understand people it's the independent
[03:56:01.400 --> 03:56:06.840]  media that expose all of this it's the independent media that made these massive jury decisions
[03:56:06.840 --> 03:56:12.040]  possible it's the independent media if you think about it and and all the activists all the clean
[03:56:12.040 --> 03:56:17.800]  food activists and all the people who believe in nutrition and and believe in you know supplements
