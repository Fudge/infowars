[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  It is January 12th, on the Sunday in broadcast 2020, and we have definitely entered the quickening.
[00:19.000 --> 00:22.000]  Everything hidden is now beginning to be revealed.
[00:22.000 --> 00:28.000]  This is going to be a bumpy ride.
[00:28.000 --> 00:39.000]  California textbooks for eighth graders officially have blood drinking and vampirism as part of sexual pleasure, taught for multiple pages.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  That's coming up.
[00:41.000 --> 00:48.000]  The UN's head officials admit major vaccine deaths and injury coverups.
[00:48.000 --> 00:55.000]  The Iranians admit they shot down the airplane, thought it was a foreign bomber, just like we told you.
[00:55.000 --> 01:00.000]  There's so much more.
[01:00.000 --> 01:15.000]  Ukraine International Flight PS 752 was taking its normal flight path when two tour surface-to-air missiles were fired upon it, killing all 176 people on board.
[01:15.000 --> 01:18.000]  The American media blamed President Trump.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  Do you think they assumed this was some sort of U.S. military blame?
[01:22.000 --> 01:27.000]  Well, I have been briefed on it, Wolf, in the Intelligence Committee, so I'm not really at liberty to say.
[01:27.000 --> 01:41.000]  But if what is being projected is true, this is yet another example of collateral damage from the actions that have been taken in a provocative way by the President of the United States.
[01:41.000 --> 01:50.000]  And when the regime finally admitted to shooting down the plane, the American media came to their defense.
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.000]  Meanwhile, the people of Iran took to the streets in protests.
[01:56.000 --> 02:06.000]  In Tehran, Karaj, and Isfahan, they shouted, Our enemy is here. They lie when they tell us it's the U.S.
[02:06.000 --> 02:12.000]  Bishara, which means dishonorable.
[02:12.000 --> 02:19.000]  Shameless IRGC, leave the country.
[02:19.000 --> 02:29.000]  Death to this regime after all these years of crimes.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  Don't call me instigator. You are the sedition.
[02:35.000 --> 02:43.000]  And gun barrel, tank, and machine gun, mullah should be annihilated.
[02:43.000 --> 02:50.000]  Immediately, these protests appear different than what we have seen in the past.
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  The language is stronger.
[02:56.000 --> 03:05.000]  Saudi-run media Iran International reports that security agencies have warned the families of Iranians who died in the crash
[03:05.000 --> 03:12.000]  that if they speak with media outside of Iran, then they will never see the bodies of their loved ones.
[03:12.000 --> 03:21.000]  British Ambassador Rob McCare was arrested in Tehran while photographing the protests.
[03:21.000 --> 03:32.000]  Iran seems to be at the heart of the drama that America is currently tied into, and it is dividing the so-called patriot movement.
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  Say what you will about the QAnon movement, but it is not a small thing.
[03:37.000 --> 03:42.000]  It has grown so big that it has become a part of pop culture.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  And the Q position is clear.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  Regime change in Iran is part of the plan.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  But how exactly will that look?
[03:52.000 --> 04:00.000]  Many are understandably concerned that we are being set up for another neocon regime change in the Middle East,
[04:00.000 --> 04:07.000]  creating more angry refugees to flood Europe with and the United States with.
[04:07.000 --> 04:14.000]  And many are hoping to see the Iranian people rise up and gain independence within their own nation,
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.000]  something they have not known for over 200 years.
[04:19.000 --> 04:27.000]  However you feel about the relationship between Iran and America, it is in desperate need of resolve.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  And the protests in Iran are continuing.
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  The question isn't, will the regime change?
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  The question is, what comes next when it does?
[04:39.000 --> 05:01.000]  Reporting for infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[05:01.000 --> 05:10.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the infowars, family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air.
[05:10.000 --> 05:12.000]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[05:12.000 --> 05:17.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers.
[05:20.000 --> 05:27.000]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[05:27.000 --> 05:32.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[05:36.000 --> 05:42.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.000]  So it's not a burden to support infowars.
[05:46.000 --> 05:52.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom.
[05:52.000 --> 05:57.000]  And makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[05:57.000 --> 06:23.000]  Visit infowarsstore.com today.
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  It's Sunday, January 12th, 2020.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:37.000 --> 06:42.000]  And we're going to be alive here, Lord willing, the next few hours.
[06:42.000 --> 06:46.000]  What we have predicted for 2020 is clearly true.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  But everyone can feel and see is now manifesting.
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  It's the year of vision. It's the year of awakening.
[06:53.000 --> 06:57.000]  It's the year we're going to really find out just how bad it is.
[06:57.000 --> 07:03.000]  We're going to be taken to the bottom of the rabbit hole this year.
[07:03.000 --> 07:10.000]  The only question is, can we handle it?
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  I have been up here basically all weekend.
[07:15.000 --> 07:23.000]  We got contacted by medical doctors and researchers on Thursday night.
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  And they said, no one has reported on this.
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  We want you to be the first.
[07:29.000 --> 07:34.000]  The UN, because under compliance laws, they have to post this, but they hid the link.
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  We've been waiting a month to find it.
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  They had the meetings on December 2nd and 3rd.
[07:40.000 --> 07:46.000]  The official UN WHO, head of the WHO, the head scientist of the WHO,
[07:46.000 --> 07:54.000]  the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland, where that group's based.
[07:54.000 --> 07:59.000]  And they said, we're watching the 20 hours of the two-day meetings.
[07:59.000 --> 08:04.000]  Here's some of the basics we've got, but we want you to break this.
[08:04.000 --> 08:10.000]  Well, Rob News, the news director, because he'll work 20 hours a day without asking you to,
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.000]  because on important issues like this, he basically watched most of it with some of the folks online.
[08:15.000 --> 08:19.000]  We're going to crowdsource it here today and ask you to go watch it, because there's even breakaway meetings.
[08:19.000 --> 08:27.000]  This is the head of the WHO, the head scientist of the WHO, the head of the World Vaccine Program saying,
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.000]  it's killing a bunch of people, they say this on tape.
[08:32.000 --> 08:41.000]  It's not protecting people, and the majority of doctors are rebelling and are about to go public.
[08:41.000 --> 08:52.000]  We're being ordered to do this.
[08:52.000 --> 08:54.000]  But it's a crime against humanity.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  It is a Nuremberg moment.
[08:58.000 --> 09:02.000]  So Friday, we stayed up here late.
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000]  And then yesterday and then today, and I was watching hours of this before I went on air,
[09:07.000 --> 09:11.000]  and I shot a report on it that'll be done at the end of the hour, so we should premiere it here.
[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  But imagine you're watching this stuff.
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  I mean, you're going to see the video, okay?
[09:17.000 --> 09:19.000]  It's unbelievable.
[09:19.000 --> 09:24.000]  We already know all this, but the fact that they knew all along and they're covering it up, it makes you physically,
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  like, hey, you feeling good? You're proving right? I'm like, no, I'm not feeling too hot here. No, I'm not feeling too good about this.
[09:30.000 --> 09:36.000]  It'd be like a murder mystery, or you think you know who's kidnapped the kid, and then you turn out right, the kid's dead.
[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  It's not a good feeling.
[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  So there's that.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  I've been saying since it happened day one, they shot down that Ukrainian airliner with tour missiles.
[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  We even had the photos of the video.
[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  Oh, that's fake news, info wars.
[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  We literally broke that.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  We ran with it five, six days ago. Now the Iranians say, yeah, we shot it down. Sorry.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  I thought it was a beef tissue bomber.
[09:58.000 --> 10:00.000]  We got that.
[10:00.000 --> 10:07.000]  We got the articles of impeachment now going to the Senate.
[10:07.000 --> 10:16.000]  And then we've got, when I say and, I mean, I've got like 20 other things, but I always explain this to listeners,
[10:16.000 --> 10:23.000]  as crazy as I sound, because the globalists are crazy.
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  It's always worse than I say.
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  So I tell the listeners, I'm not an, I'm not a liar on purpose.
[10:31.000 --> 10:41.000]  But it's almost always worse than I'm saying, like I wish I was exaggerating.
[10:41.000 --> 10:50.000]  But it's always worse than I'm saying, like, like my wife's going with me next week to DC for the George Soros Women's March
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  and the gun confiscation that starts in Virginia will be there.
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.000]  I'm like, yeah, Soros gave 87 million to the first Women's March and he's given about 300 million since then.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  And she goes, come on, honey, really?
[11:02.000 --> 11:05.000]  So I was pulling up Wall Street Journal CNN articles saying how great it was.
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  And she goes, wow, it says 90 million to the first March.
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  And I said, yeah, the first report wasn't 87 million, but later they learned about 3 million more.
[11:14.000 --> 11:15.000]  She's like, how do you know that?
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  And I go, I don't know how I know that.
[11:17.000 --> 11:18.000]  I mean, I studied it.
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  I read it.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  I used to have a photographic memory, but sometimes it fails.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  I had that great ferrata lady on incredible journalist.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  I had her on a few years ago.
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  Her brother was kidnapped, tortured.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  Her camera guy, she murdered.
[11:33.000 --> 11:38.000]  And when I got her on, I went, oh, you were locked up and wouldn't go back to, you know, on what you'd said to be released.
[11:38.000 --> 11:39.000]  She was, no, that was my brother.
[11:39.000 --> 11:47.000]  They kidnapped him and they were going to kill him if I wouldn't, you know, go along with ISIS and Al Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood.
[11:47.000 --> 11:49.000]  And it was kind of that moment like, wow, my memory.
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.000]  I remember it was her, but it was, it was, it was her brother and her camera guy.
[11:53.000 --> 11:58.000]  But the point is, I'm not making stuff up here.
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  And about 97, 98% of the time I'm dead on accurate.
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  But let's just move on from that.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  I'm just explaining to people that I don't blow smoke.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  I really lived this.
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  I had eight hours of dreams last night of work.
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  I mean, I work in my dreams and they're very clarion, very central.
[12:20.000 --> 12:27.000]  And I was working the whole time on what was going to, what we're going to do.
[12:27.000 --> 12:34.000]  I just want you to know, I'm fully committed and I don't want you to think out there that, oh, everybody's false and there's nobody real.
[12:34.000 --> 12:35.000]  You're real.
[12:35.000 --> 12:36.000]  You know, you're real.
[12:36.000 --> 12:37.000]  You know, you tell the truth.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  You know, you love justice.
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  You know, you love God.
[12:42.000 --> 12:48.000]  And you know that you're not backing down.
[12:48.000 --> 12:56.000]  So I'm going to stop right there.
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  We have video.
[12:58.000 --> 13:16.000]  As I said, of the head of the WHO, the head scientist, the head of the world vaccine program, the head bioethics board, and then randomly like the head of the Nigerian health board and all these other people.
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  And I mean, I called up, called up here yesterday after I left and Rob do was up here like midnight.
[13:20.000 --> 13:22.000]  I called Rob this morning and he's like already up here.
[13:22.000 --> 13:23.000]  I come up here.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  He's got his kids in there.
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.000]  You know what?
[13:25.000 --> 13:26.000]  That's good.
[13:26.000 --> 13:29.000]  Because he cares about, he's got like, I guess four kids.
[13:29.000 --> 13:30.000]  He's got two of them.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.000]  He's taken care of them while he's in their editing because he cares.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  I didn't tell him to do that.
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.000]  That's a normal response when you know they're putting poison in vaccines on purpose for social engineering.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  We're not saying vaccine science isn't real.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  We're saying they're jacking them.
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  And the normal response of a man is to be pissed.
[13:48.000 --> 13:58.000]  He could take his kids to the park all day long or take them to, you know, some bowling alley, but they wouldn't be safe.
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  And your children wouldn't be safe that we weren't up here.
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.000]  And I only tell you that to not go, oh, look, we're up here working hard.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  I'm saying it's a normal response to this, to go to war.
[14:08.000 --> 14:10.000]  And we're at war informationally wise.
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.000]  I mean, yeah, we're up here all the time.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  This is real.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  This is all I did because that's normal response.
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.000]  It's not heroic.
[14:16.000 --> 14:18.000]  It's normal response.
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  When somebody's attacking you, you fight back.
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  You don't roll over in the ditch and die.
[14:23.000 --> 14:28.000]  That's why when listeners call in, it is critical that you not say, thank you, you're great.
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  You're wonderful.
[14:30.000 --> 14:40.000]  Again, that's like somebody that runs off on the side of a bridge on an icy road and goes into a river and they're fighting to get out of the seatbelt in the river and knock the windshield out to swim up to the top and not die.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  That ain't heroic.
[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  That's called survival.
[14:45.000 --> 14:51.000]  So if you want to say anything, say my life force is strong.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  You want to say, yeah, my will to live is damn strong.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  My will to not fall to these people and give in to them is strong.
[14:58.000 --> 15:02.000]  Now, let me tell you the next thing why I'm so freaked out.
[15:02.000 --> 15:09.000]  I've known that vampirism, the drinking of blood, is at the heart of Hollywood.
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  I didn't know that from movies or anything.
[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  I was in some movies, got involved, went there and had people tell me.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  And then I saw it.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  California textbooks are now teaching eight-year-olds.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  It broke today.
[15:21.000 --> 15:27.000]  It's on M4Words.com to drink blood as a sexual preference.
[15:27.000 --> 15:29.000]  And they teach them about blood play.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  And I went, wait a minute.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  I was told that by a former high-level FBI, 20-something years ago, that term.
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.000]  And I looked it up and there, they're teaching children hardcore Satanism.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  I'm going to show you that, too, folks, and believe me.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  You don't want to look at it, but you got to look at it because that's what these people are.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  These are actual devil worshipers.
[15:50.000 --> 15:52.000]  Their bodies don't live forever.
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  The spirits that are in them transcend.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  We're going to talk about them when we come back.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[16:08.000 --> 16:10.000]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[16:10.000 --> 16:16.000]  There's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  You're bang for your buck.
[16:18.000 --> 16:24.000]  Fear gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.000]  And so it's very simple.
[16:29.000 --> 16:33.000]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy,
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.000]  God wants to see.
[16:34.000 --> 16:36.000]  You see, we have to make the effort.
[16:36.000 --> 16:38.000]  110% God will finish the move.
[16:38.000 --> 16:42.000]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.000]  I want to attack.
[16:43.000 --> 16:44.000]  I want to go after the globalists.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.000]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen,
[16:46.000 --> 16:49.000]  that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight for all of our futures together,
[16:49.000 --> 16:52.000]  you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.000]  I'm going to buzz my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for your family.
[16:56.000 --> 16:58.000]  Because we're in this together.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[17:00.000 --> 17:05.000]  Sunday was supposed to be the last day that we could offer store-wide free shipping,
[17:05.000 --> 17:06.000]  double Patriot points.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  It was 75% off with our big year in sale.
[17:09.000 --> 17:12.000]  Because a lot of the products have already sold out.
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  Most of the others are about to sell out.
[17:14.000 --> 17:18.000]  But quite frankly, I've been working on so many big stories that are breaking right now
[17:18.000 --> 17:20.000]  that I have not come up with new specials.
[17:20.000 --> 17:23.000]  And we're already so close to selling out all these products
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  that I'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days.
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  And we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines.
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  It'll take weeks, months for them all to come back in.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  Some come in in weeks, some come in in like three months.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  A lot of stuff's coming back in next week.
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  So I've just decided because of the inventory issues, all the rest of it.
[17:42.000 --> 17:44.000]  And because some of these were selling,
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  losses are making people buy a lot of other stuff and we are making a profit.
[17:47.000 --> 17:51.000]  So I'm going to just keep the sale going, but only for 48 hours maximum.
[17:51.000 --> 17:52.000]  And then we've got to stop it.
[17:52.000 --> 17:57.000]  Infowarstore.com, year-end now 2020 mega blowout sale.
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.000]  Infowarstore.com, biggest sales we're ever going to have.
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.000]  I want to talk about Super Silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it
[18:04.000 --> 18:06.000]  except for maybe the last week and a half.
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.000]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[18:12.000 --> 18:14.000]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[18:14.000 --> 18:19.000]  So here I am telling people Super Silver whitening toothpaste is by far
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.000]  the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.000]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[18:25.000 --> 18:27.000]  And it's fluoride free.
[18:27.000 --> 18:30.000]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[18:30.000 --> 18:35.000]  because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste
[18:35.000 --> 18:38.000]  that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[18:38.000 --> 18:40.000]  It feels so good.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin,
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.000]  it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage.
[19:07.000 --> 19:14.000]  Wind, heat, water and age are telltale signs that it's time to start taking care of your skin.
[19:14.000 --> 19:19.000]  With the InfoWars Super Silver Cream, you can keep your skin feeling silky smooth
[19:19.000 --> 19:22.000]  and begin to heal the damages of the world around you.
[19:22.000 --> 19:28.000]  Created with ingredients like coconut oil, vitamin E and the incredible silver salt formula,
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  InfoWars Silver Cream works triple beauty,
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.000]  supporting the beautifying and protecting of the skin in a fast, non-greasy formula,
[19:36.000 --> 19:38.000]  small and easily stored.
[19:38.000 --> 19:44.000]  It can support dry and damaged skin to reduce fine lines and wrinkles while smoothing and softening calluses.
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  With none of the harmful ingredients found in other formulas,
[19:47.000 --> 19:50.000]  you can be sure this silver cream is hard at work,
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  promoting the healing of your skin.
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.000]  Don't miss out on the new silver salt-powered, can't miss formula.
[19:56.000 --> 20:11.000]  The InfoWars Super Silver Cream today.
[20:11.000 --> 20:27.000]  Welcome back. I'm Alex Jones, your host of your new listener.
[20:27.000 --> 20:33.000]  So, I was growing up and I would hear the leftist propaganda that,
[20:33.000 --> 20:41.000]  oh, there's all these squares that don't want you to have a girlfriend, don't want you to drink a beer, don't want you to have fun.
[20:41.000 --> 20:46.000]  And they're all paranoid and they claim there's, you know, the 1980s.
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.000]  Satanism hysteria doesn't exist.
[20:51.000 --> 20:59.000]  Even though law enforcement was reporting it, there were thousands of convictions of human sacrifice, murder, Satanism.
[20:59.000 --> 21:04.000]  They would say, Geraldo Rivera, he's putting on hoaxes, none of it exists.
[21:04.000 --> 21:13.000]  The Satanism hysteria, the Satanism panic.
[21:13.000 --> 21:22.000]  And then those files get be classified 30 years later and it's everything that the police were warning us about was real.
[21:22.000 --> 21:25.000]  See, the public couldn't handle it, kind of like people said 50 years ago,
[21:25.000 --> 21:32.000]  Catholic priests are abusing little boys. 20 years ago, they said it's happening really bad in the Boy Scouts and it was happening.
[21:32.000 --> 21:40.000]  It's every institution, but it's evil trying to take it over.
[21:40.000 --> 21:53.000]  And so, I start looking at the news and I start researching it.
[21:53.000 --> 22:03.000]  And it's just incredible how mainline news will say it in Gillette commercials and on CNN,
[22:03.000 --> 22:11.000]  that if a man is at a mall, or a man is at a movie theater, or a man is at a dance,
[22:11.000 --> 22:16.000]  and he goes over and says, I think you're very attractive, you're so amazing, would you like to dance?
[22:16.000 --> 22:22.000]  But that's a form of assault because normal human activity is bad.
[22:22.000 --> 22:29.000]  But if it's unannounced in many cases, children taken in public schools and libraries and put them to laps,
[22:29.000 --> 22:35.000]  in some cases of convicted pedophiles, convicted murderers, has come out.
[22:35.000 --> 22:43.000]  Well, then it's beautiful and wonderful to have a big fat, ugly man in a dress, grabbing little kids.
[22:43.000 --> 22:52.000]  That's the power of the media conditioning you to give in to things that are destructive because they've got even more horrible things coming.
[22:52.000 --> 23:05.000]  They're searing your consciousness to prepare you for incredible horrors.
[23:05.000 --> 23:16.000]  And so that's the poison vomit sprayed out of the dying black hole that is Hollywood in San Francisco.
[23:16.000 --> 23:24.000]  And I mean, just type it in, convicted pedophiles, convicted child rapists ran drag queen story time in Houston.
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  They busted one, the next leader comes, he's another busted one.
[23:28.000 --> 23:37.000]  Because we noticed it and called police, we said, we run the plates of these guys and the rest of them and they show up and they're one person.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  And then they come in and put makeup on like clowns.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  He came and recognized him and said they're another person.
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.000]  And of course it turned out they were hiding their identities.
[23:46.000 --> 23:48.000]  Yes, why is the drag queen story time?
[23:48.000 --> 23:50.000]  They look like clowns, not like guys dressed like women.
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  It's because they're covering up their identities.
[23:53.000 --> 23:58.000]  Drag queen story time, convicted pedophile, dressed as woman, reached the kids at public library.
[23:58.000 --> 24:02.000]  This is the big offensive.
[24:02.000 --> 24:09.000]  And they stopped him and it turned out the next guy was a leader.
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  So here's what's happening.
[24:12.000 --> 24:20.000]  I'm not holding off covering all this news right now.
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  And I'm not a victim. I'm fighting back.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  But I got to tell you, I'm shell shocked.
[24:25.000 --> 24:32.000]  You could take one of the reports I've got today and I've got dozens in front of me and do a 10 hour show on just on that.
[24:32.000 --> 24:41.000]  I mean, this is, it's like triage in a war where you got a thousand people shot up and well, you're not going to fix him.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  You're not going to fix that guy.
[24:43.000 --> 24:46.000]  But maybe we can fix these.
[24:46.000 --> 24:49.000]  It's an organized takeover.
[24:49.000 --> 24:56.000]  And it's a legitimization of evil to get us to accept it.
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  And now it's launching with everything it's got.
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  Let me just do this. Let me do this.
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  Next segment, I will come in like a news reporter and cover the next thing.
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  This is a father and as a human, it's, it's, it's hard to do.
[25:13.000 --> 25:18.000]  And then I'll tie it together with all the things that are happening, but report.
[25:18.000 --> 25:25.000]  California eighth graders taught anal bondage sex involving blood in sex ed classes.
[25:25.000 --> 25:30.000]  Now, I saw that national file article that was posted up on news wars.com.
[25:30.000 --> 25:39.000]  And I thought, what the hell is blood plate?
[25:39.000 --> 25:45.000]  Now, when I've read about that, that's, that's what vampires call it when they're killing somebody or torturing somebody to death.
[25:45.000 --> 25:48.000]  And sure as hell, I pulled it up, man.
[25:48.000 --> 25:55.000]  And it is what you do when you're killing somebody and planting their blood when they kill a baby or wherever they're rolling around it and all that.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  And so, you know, I did a little bit of research on that.
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  I have something I wanted to forget.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  And it was sure as hell going on.
[26:02.000 --> 26:08.000]  They're going directly to the most sick stuff they can.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  You say, why is Portland in San Francisco saying poop in the street?
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  We're going to support you.
[26:15.000 --> 26:23.000]  And like a city councilwoman of Portland is like, it's beautiful, defecate, defecate because they, they're getting you ready for horrible evil.
[26:23.000 --> 26:26.000]  And they're full of salt and they just want you to see ugliness everywhere.
[26:26.000 --> 26:29.000]  So when they start doing even more crazy stuff, you give in and you give up.
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  That's not going to happen.
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.000]  And, you know, I could study that myself and figure out why they're doing it, but I can read why leftist foundations running with CIA.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  In the 1960s, it was declassified.
[26:44.000 --> 26:51.000]  They were putting on ugly art and debasing women and things like that to get you ready for what they were going to do.
[26:51.000 --> 27:03.000]  Because if you know what beauty is and God's gifts, you're going to want that, but they've got to teach you just to have ugliness around you all day so that you won't differentiate.
[27:03.000 --> 27:23.000]  And so they can associate in eighth graders that sex is about blood play and then they teach in the textbook for several pages how to drink blood and how to have sex in the blood.
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  And I'm a 45 year old that's done a lot of studying into evil.
[27:29.000 --> 27:37.000]  And I had to go look it back up today and it was traumatizing. I mean, it was.
[27:37.000 --> 27:42.000]  To read what these people talk about and what they're into.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  But imagine your child's in a San Francisco or LA school.
[27:46.000 --> 27:49.000]  They're sitting there an eighth grade boy or girl and they got their textbook or their digital textbook.
[27:49.000 --> 28:01.000]  It's like the joys of having somebody shove their arm up your air and or the joys of drinking blood.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  So I don't want to cover all this kind of stuff here.
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  But we all need to just go ahead and face what's going on.
[28:08.000 --> 28:20.000]  Because see, there's a little trick these devil worshipers use. They'll do something so embarrassing, so crazy, so dirty, so upsetting that they know will kind of turn away from it and not want to respond to it.
[28:20.000 --> 28:24.000]  They're like, oh, you want to take the schools back? We're going to teach you to drink blood.
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  You're like, oh, you got children or ours.
[28:28.000 --> 28:32.000]  Just like one priest gets caught having sex with a 13 year old boy or something.
[28:32.000 --> 28:38.000]  And everybody goes, well, this is terrible. We're going to relocate him, but we don't want to destroy the whole church.
[28:38.000 --> 28:43.000]  And then they relocate him, but now they've got control of your church because you were involved in the cover up.
[28:43.000 --> 28:50.000]  See how it works. They've got a formula of evil and we've got to recognize what it is and say no to it.
[28:50.000 --> 28:56.000]  We can defeat this. We have the blueprint God gave it to us, but we've got to admit what we're up against.
[28:56.000 --> 29:06.000]  Spiritual attack if you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars, it's because we're awake.
[29:06.000 --> 29:11.000]  We're alive. We're passionate and we're not giving up.
[29:11.000 --> 29:21.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[29:21.000 --> 29:26.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[29:26.000 --> 29:37.000]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[29:37.000 --> 29:47.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheep dogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[29:47.000 --> 29:52.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive.
[29:52.000 --> 30:00.000]  They fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[30:00.000 --> 30:06.000]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the info war, but I know you're like me. You don't want my thanks.
[30:06.000 --> 30:13.000]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[30:13.000 --> 30:17.000]  You know what? I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[30:17.000 --> 30:32.000]  And it's why info wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future for humanity and I know you are as well.
[30:32.000 --> 30:40.000]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the info war and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[30:40.000 --> 30:43.000]  I'm proud of my heart from my family and from the great crew at info wars.
[30:43.000 --> 30:49.000]  I want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know that's not just words. That's reality.
[30:49.000 --> 31:01.000]  You have made history. We have made history together info wars dot com only has power because of you and I suggest you use it knock on wood.
[31:01.000 --> 31:12.000]  I am not tempting fate but everybody around the office especially folks that have worked there a long time have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[31:12.000 --> 31:17.000]  Now again I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement. I'm not tempting fate.
[31:17.000 --> 31:20.000]  I'll say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  I'm very thankful for the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given.
[31:24.000 --> 31:34.000]  But up until about 8-9 years ago when I started taking X2 and the products in force life I still got sick every couple years.
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.000]  And you know I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that.
[31:38.000 --> 31:46.000]  But now that I religiously take the products and info wars life with the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there.
[31:46.000 --> 31:56.000]  I just never get a fever anymore. It's probably been three four years since I've had a fever. It's just crazy.
[31:56.000 --> 31:59.000]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[31:59.000 --> 32:05.000]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[32:05.000 --> 32:09.000]  And I told Alex I said man this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[32:09.000 --> 32:13.000]  He's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell people.
[32:13.000 --> 32:20.000]  So here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[32:20.000 --> 32:25.000]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[32:25.000 --> 32:31.000]  I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this.
[32:31.000 --> 32:37.000]  They feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[32:37.000 --> 32:42.000]  It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[32:42.000 --> 32:48.000]  In fact I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[32:48.000 --> 33:13.000]  Because I like the way it feels.
[33:18.000 --> 33:32.000]  Alright we're back live ladies and gentlemen and let me just do this.
[33:32.000 --> 33:39.000]  I'm going to play the vampire report in the third segment of the next hour.
[33:39.000 --> 33:50.000]  And I'm going to cover it all there but you understand that M4Wars.com has an article that's linked to mainline news.
[33:50.000 --> 33:57.000]  Saying what's wrong with teaching eight year olds to drink blood to cut themselves and hurt their bodies.
[33:57.000 --> 34:04.000]  It's just a preference you see. It's like eating babies alive after they're born and settlement organs later.
[34:04.000 --> 34:12.000]  It's all just a lifestyle. You're tolerant right. You'll put up with anything right.
[34:12.000 --> 34:24.000]  And I called up folks that wrote this article over at NationalFall.com and I said you really get what the main headline there is right.
[34:24.000 --> 34:39.000]  And they said well yeah they're teaching them stuff I can't even say on an adult show. Bondage, very vicious stuff, sex involving blood.
[34:39.000 --> 34:50.000]  But that's not what sex and blood play is in the definition put out by the San Francisco government and the Los Angeles government,
[34:50.000 --> 35:02.000]  the city government, the Los Angeles really runs state government up in the northern part of the state.
[35:02.000 --> 35:19.000]  Blood drinking. It's blood play, BDSM, sexual activity in which participant is deliberately cut so to release blood.
[35:19.000 --> 35:30.000]  Vampire lifestyle.
[35:30.000 --> 35:40.000]  You can say well that's a bunch of weird freaks. Nobody's doing that really. Well those weird freaks are running your schools.
[35:40.000 --> 35:47.000]  They run the big cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco and they've got the state government.
[35:47.000 --> 35:53.000]  And they've got other state governments and this is what they're into and this is who they are. This is what's in the textbook.
[35:53.000 --> 36:02.000]  It says role play, bondage, body fluid and blood play, sex toys.
[36:02.000 --> 36:11.000]  And there's whole pages on each part. I guess the teacher gets up and teaches you how to cut yourself and drink blood.
[36:11.000 --> 36:20.000]  That's who these people are.
[36:20.000 --> 36:28.000]  So I'll break all that down but let me just do this because that ties into all these articles.
[36:28.000 --> 36:36.000]  Man who lives as a baby cries, drinks from bottles, soils, diaper. Government wants taxpayers to pay for it and don't worry you will.
[36:36.000 --> 36:52.000]  Hell you pay for little boys to have their genitals cut off by their parents. You pay for abortions. Why not pay for a man to live as a baby and have a nurse change his diapers?
[36:52.000 --> 36:56.000]  See there's no end.
[36:56.000 --> 37:03.000]  I got a whole file on this. Just what's breaking now. Woman who posed as teenage boy to abuse young girls jailed for eight years.
[37:03.000 --> 37:09.000]  She's a terrible thing. She deserves it but the Muslims are allowed to do it.
[37:09.000 --> 37:21.000]  CNN says she was born in her sex but her parents won't cut her male genitals off their criminals.
[37:21.000 --> 37:27.000]  That's CNN. It's like weird to have a boy now. You're supposed to cut their genitals off.
[37:27.000 --> 37:37.000]  What the hell's going on with this family? They didn't do it. They let the little boy dress like a girl but they won't cut it off. How weird.
[37:37.000 --> 37:42.000]  You see how this works?
[37:42.000 --> 37:46.000]  But let me tell you the other big news we've got because there's a lot of good news too.
[37:46.000 --> 38:00.000]  Taiwan's pro-independence president announces reelection victory. Beijing rebuked DHS Hales completion of hundredth mile of new border wall.
[38:00.000 --> 38:08.000]  More than a dozen Saudi servicemen to be expelled from US after review of December shooting at Naval Air Station.
[38:08.000 --> 38:19.000]  The curtain falls on Chinese Film Festival. The censorship intensifies. French news agency, AFP, they just can't have film festivals because the Chinese won't let you even have them.
[38:19.000 --> 38:27.000]  They control Hollywood so much. It's all coming out, isn't it?
[38:27.000 --> 38:36.000]  Reported nuclear disaster up in Canada but the government says don't worry about the reports of radiation. Just trust them.
[38:36.000 --> 38:47.000]  A big article from CNN. Australia's indigenous people have a solution for the country's brush fires and it's been around for 50,000 years.
[38:47.000 --> 38:59.000]  And when you read the article it says they need to scrub and rake up all the leaves and piles of debris and create fire breaks.
[38:59.000 --> 39:10.000]  Remember Trump said we need to rake the forest? That's actually what they call it in Austria.
[39:10.000 --> 39:15.000]  The media said he was totally insane.
[39:15.000 --> 39:25.000]  But oh, the Aborigines recommended and oh, we've got to do control burns yesterday. We'll get to that report as well.
[39:25.000 --> 39:34.000]  And Jane Fonda told Anderson Cooper it feels good to be arrested for civil disobedience and then she says that we'll all be under water in another year.
[39:34.000 --> 39:40.000]  But I've got all the articles where they said that the years before over and over again. We're going to hit that as well.
[39:40.000 --> 39:48.000]  But I shot a special report that we're going to post to infowars.com and newswars.com and band video.
[39:48.000 --> 39:55.000]  And our own platforms. Thanks for your support because we're not allowed anywhere else.
[39:55.000 --> 40:04.000]  Where we can put this video up with the head of the UN World Health Department organization admitting vaccines are killing people and maiming them.
[40:04.000 --> 40:12.000]  And they're dangerous and they're covering it up and that most doctors they talk to are about to quit and go public and that there's a crisis point.
[40:12.000 --> 40:19.000]  That's why they're saying arrest people that question vaccines and take their kids. It's bullying the last tactic of individuals failing.
[40:19.000 --> 40:29.000]  What did Mahatma Gandhi say? First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then they lose.
[40:29.000 --> 40:40.000]  The actual quote was first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you, whoa, whoa, whoa, win.
[40:40.000 --> 40:45.000]  Iran tried to say they didn't blow that plane up.
[40:45.000 --> 40:49.000]  It was only had the missile tracks, the satellite photos, everything before that was out.
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.000]  I said that's routine. Iran shot down two airliners in the war with Iraq.
[40:55.000 --> 41:02.000]  It's a sad thing. It happens. They sure as hell didn't do it on purpose. They thought it was a U.S. aircraft, I'm sure.
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.000]  Now they came out and said, yeah, we were lying. We're not going to try anymore. We give up.
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.000]  In the past, governments would just keep the lagoon, but see, it doesn't work anymore.
[41:10.000 --> 41:15.000]  We had the photos of the tour missiles five days ago. We showed them to here on air.
[41:15.000 --> 41:20.000]  See, it doesn't work anymore. It jigs up.
[41:20.000 --> 41:34.000]  So this incredibly important report is about to air on the other side of this break about the U.N. admitting vaccines are killing people and they've been ordered to cover it up.
[41:34.000 --> 41:40.000]  It's so important. It's so huge. It just validates everything and, boy, big tech's been on board trying to censor everybody.
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  It tells the truth. It's just sick.
[41:42.000 --> 41:46.000]  Okay, I'm about a week overdue ending the big year in special.
[41:46.000 --> 41:53.000]  And it's because I've been so focused on news. I haven't done it, but I can tell you, I was up here all day and we cut all the new ads to the new specials.
[41:53.000 --> 42:00.000]  And they're great specials, but they're not as deep or big as the 2019 year in specials that sold out most of our products.
[42:00.000 --> 42:07.000]  But Real Red Pill Plus, APEC PowerStack, Rainforest Plus, Ultra 12, Bio, Trusilinium, Survival Shield, X3.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  It's so amazing. It's all 60 to 75 percent off. That's at cost.
[42:12.000 --> 42:18.000]  Ultimate Female Force, M4s, Life Protein Bars, Super Silver Woundshell. It's amazing and patented.
[42:18.000 --> 42:24.000]  Bio, PCA, Icaron. It's all massively discounted at M4sport.com.
[42:24.000 --> 42:34.000]  And all those sales end tomorrow because at 8 a.m. when David Knight goes on the year, all the new ads start and then old specials are dead.
[42:34.000 --> 42:39.000]  And the new specials are great, but they're not as wide or as deep as we can, and there's new year to fund ourselves.
[42:39.000 --> 42:43.000]  So this is the last chance to take advantage of this and get the products you want to make your life better.
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.000]  M4sport.com, a 50 percent off the whitening toothpaste that re-memorizes the teeth.
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.000]  I mean, that's almost at cost to that price. You've got a few hours left at M4sport.com.
[42:53.000 --> 43:00.000]  We'll be back with what you financing us is exposing. Yeah, you've done an amazing job.

[44:22.000 --> 44:37.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[44:37.000 --> 44:51.000]  Polymblock is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[44:51.000 --> 45:07.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to InfoWarsLife.com and grab a pack of our Polymblock chewable tablets.
[45:22.000 --> 45:31.000]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus. I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months. It's incredible.
[45:31.000 --> 45:38.000]  So do yourself a favor. Try out the products if you've been on the fence. You can't lose, except if you don't take action.
[45:38.000 --> 45:45.000]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace in our action.
[45:45.000 --> 45:53.000]  But you need these products. That's the real reason you want to get them, is because they're amazing. And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[45:53.000 --> 46:00.000]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding. We're fighting to win, and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[46:00.000 --> 46:12.000]  Sunday was supposed to be the last day that we could offer a store-wide free shipping double-patriot points. It was 75% off with our big year in sale, because a lot of the products have already sold out.
[46:12.000 --> 46:20.000]  Most of the others are about to sell out. But quite frankly, I've been working on so many big stories that are breaking right now that I have not come up with new specials.
[46:20.000 --> 46:27.000]  And we're already so close to selling out all these products that I'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days.
[46:27.000 --> 46:34.000]  And we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines. It'll take weeks, months for them all to come back in.
[46:34.000 --> 46:38.000]  Some come in in weeks, some come in in like three months. A lot of stuff's coming back in next week.
[46:38.000 --> 46:42.000]  So I've just decided because of the inventory issues and all the rest of it.
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.000]  And because some of these were selling at losses, are making people buy a lot of other stuff, and we are making a profit.
[46:47.000 --> 46:51.000]  So I'm going to just keep the sale going, but only for 48 hours maximum.
[46:51.000 --> 46:52.000]  And then we've got to stop it.
[46:52.000 --> 47:11.000]  M4warstore.com, year-end now 2020 mega blowout sale, M4warstore.com, biggest sales we're ever going to have.
[47:22.000 --> 47:31.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[47:31.000 --> 47:49.000]  Here is the special report that just went live at band.video where United Nations officials admit they've been covering up deaths and massive injuries while saying it's totally safe and effective with all these new hundreds of vaccines they're pushing.
[47:49.000 --> 48:04.000]  Vaccines are very safe. If someone gets sick after vaccination, it is usually either a coincidence, an error in administering the vaccine, or very rarely a problem with the vaccine itself.
[48:04.000 --> 48:22.000]  Please listen to me carefully. Millions of people have already had their lives ruined, and many of them have died because of the information I'm about to lay out. And still millions more are facing that same fate.
[48:22.000 --> 48:41.000]  This information that I'm about to lay out that has just broken, and is directly from the UN department running the operation, admits that they are knowingly forcing vaccines worldwide when they are killing and maiming people en masse,
[48:41.000 --> 48:54.000]  when they are untested, unproven, and known to be dangerous, and that the majority of doctors know they're dangerous and are about to go public.
[48:54.000 --> 49:06.000]  What you're about to witness is the beginning of them going public. They know what they're saying here, and they're saying it because they know nothing can stop this information coming out now,
[49:06.000 --> 49:18.000]  and it's far worse than they even say. You're about to see the head scientist at the World Health Organization admit that vaccines are killing people, and that there's a cover-up.
[49:18.000 --> 49:29.000]  Then we're going to show you the directors of all the major programs at the UN admitting that the front line of doctors is wobbly, and they don't think they're safe because they see what's happening.
[49:29.000 --> 49:43.000]  The people are being hurt, and that they've been covering it up. There's a global crisis in confidence in vaccines because they've done it, so they need to start testing and find out if they're safe.
[49:43.000 --> 49:53.000]  Safe, effective, tested, none of that's true. It's being done by design. So I'll tell you the rest of the story after we play these clips.
[49:53.000 --> 50:02.000]  We really don't have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries, and this adds to the miscommunication and the misapprehensions,
[50:02.000 --> 50:11.000]  because we're not able to give clear-cut answers when people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine, and this always gets blown up in the media.
[50:11.000 --> 50:21.000]  One should be able to give a very factual account of what exactly has happened and what the cause of deaths are, but in most cases there's some obfuscation at that level.
[50:21.000 --> 50:29.000]  The first accusation is it is the adjuvant, and yet without adjuvants we are not going to have the next generation of vaccines.
[50:29.000 --> 50:36.000]  And many of the vaccines that we do have, ranging from tetanus through to HPV, require adjuvants in order for them to work.
[50:36.000 --> 50:49.000]  I give courses every year on how do you develop vaccines, how do you make vaccines, and the first lesson is while you're making your vaccine, if you can avoid using an adjuvant, please do so.
[50:49.000 --> 51:07.000]  It seems to me they multiply the reactogenicity in many instances, and therefore it seems to me that it is not unexpected if they multiply the incidence of adverse reactions that are associated with the antigen,
[51:07.000 --> 51:13.000]  but may not have been detected through lack of statistical power in the original study.
[51:13.000 --> 51:19.000]  The major health concern which we are seeing are accusations of long-term effects.
[51:19.000 --> 51:25.000]  And again, as you mentioned, pre-licensure of clinical trials may not be powered enough.
[51:25.000 --> 51:42.000]  It's also the subject population that you administer the adjuvant to, because we've seen data presented to us where a particular adjuvant added to a vaccine antigen did really nothing when administered to a certain population.
[51:42.000 --> 51:52.000]  And it's usually the elderly compared to administering the same formulation to younger age strata.
[51:52.000 --> 52:02.000]  So these are things which need to be considered as well and further complicate safety and effectiveness evaluation of adjuvants combined with vaccine antigens.
[52:02.000 --> 52:14.000]  Where as six weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, a child is being given different antigens from different companies, and these vaccines have different adjuvants, different preservatives, and so on.
[52:14.000 --> 52:23.000]  Something crosses my mind. Is there a possibility of these adjuvants, preservatives, cross-reacting amongst themselves?
[52:23.000 --> 52:32.000]  Have they ever been a study on the possibility of cross-reactions from the panel members that you can share the experience with us?
[52:32.000 --> 52:42.000]  We have a very wobbly health professional frontline that is starting to question vaccines and the safety of vaccines.
[52:42.000 --> 52:56.000]  The frontline professionals are starting to question, or they don't feel like they have enough confidence about the safety to stand up to it, to the person asking them the questions.
[52:56.000 --> 53:05.000]  I mean, most medical school curriculums, even nursing curriculums, I mean, in medical school, you're lucky if you have a half day on vaccines.
[53:05.000 --> 53:22.000]  What you just saw is only a small sampling of the historic meeting with the UN convened an emergency summit in Switzerland with their top scientists to try to figure out what's happening and how to respond to the public's awakening to what's happening.
[53:22.000 --> 53:33.000]  And then, of course, Big Pharma, with its horrible history of corruption, is given liability protection for the damage caused with the vaccines, and they go on the news and tell us vaccines never hurt anybody.
[53:33.000 --> 53:39.000]  It's a conspiracy theory. Arrest everybody that criticizes it. Take their children away from them.
[53:39.000 --> 53:45.000]  I've had hundreds of scientists on medical doctors, you name it, exposing all of this over the years.
[53:45.000 --> 53:57.000]  So we're not learning anything new here, but it's the UN admitting that there's a loss of confidence globally by the medical community and that there's been a cover-up and they don't know what to do.
[53:57.000 --> 54:08.000]  They say they haven't studied, but they have. Big Pharma uses the UN and other governments as the enforcers of this.
[54:08.000 --> 54:15.000]  But as you heard the UN say, they've never done a study, and they don't have a study on the effects of adjuvants, but they clearly see what they're doing.
[54:15.000 --> 54:23.000]  And top scientists say you shouldn't even use adjuvants. We know they're causing autoimmune responses. We know they're causing autoimmune diseases.
[54:23.000 --> 54:33.000]  He uses fancy terms for allergic responses and autoimmune disease, but that's what he's saying, but not in words that you know or that I know in general that will scare us.
[54:33.000 --> 54:44.000]  So they're up there talking in code because they're there trying to cover their ass, but those that are really guilty are Big Pharma because the adjuvants are only one part of this.
[54:44.000 --> 54:53.000]  When you have a live anthrax vaccine and they say, well, it's genetically engineered to be not as harmful, and then it kills a bunch of people that are administered.
[54:53.000 --> 55:03.000]  That's what happened. Or you have the new approved Ebola vaccine that's live Ebola, but it's been genetically engineered. They say to not harm you.
[55:03.000 --> 55:11.000]  Should we go over all the problems there or what Trojan horses have been loaded in on purpose or by accident? It just goes on and on from there.
[55:11.000 --> 55:18.000]  So vaccines, we think of just learning immunity to something. That's a real technology. It has risk, but it's done a lot of amazing things.
[55:18.000 --> 55:33.000]  We're talking about all these other sciences rolled in to vaccines, genetic engineering, you name it, being put into us via these vaccines that Big Pharma is testing us like guinea pigs with, and we see the response.
[55:33.000 --> 55:45.000]  Massive deaths, massive neurological problems, incredible levels of cancer increases and the inserts admit that, but there is a sickening silver lining to this giant black cloud of evil.
[55:45.000 --> 56:00.000]  And that's that the damage and the death and the carnage is so huge from vaccines and vaccine related technologies that they can't cover it up anymore and people are pissed and they know what's going on and the dam is breaking.
[56:00.000 --> 56:08.000]  Dr. Wakefield did those studies more than 20 years ago proving that antibodies from the MMR shot were in the intestines of these autistic children.
[56:08.000 --> 56:16.000]  Since then, a whole bunch of other studies have been done confirming his research, but the media targeted him and said that he was a fraud.
[56:16.000 --> 56:27.000]  When he was never proven to be a fraud and those that made up the fraud have since been exposed, but that's what they do to trailblazers that try to warn the people.
[56:27.000 --> 56:40.000]  The big takeaway here is back in the mid 80s, the United States passed a multi-billion dollar act to put billions of dollars a year into a secret fund to pay people who are damaged by vaccines.
[56:40.000 --> 56:52.000]  But they believe that only about 1% of those damaged even know about the fund and ever get to the fund through the reporting agency and then jump through the hoops to get the aid they need.
[56:52.000 --> 57:01.000]  Think about that. They set up giant vaccine damage funds that operate in secret, but they tell you they're safe and effective and that it's a conspiracy that anybody ever got hurt.
[57:01.000 --> 57:14.000]  And the very same UN head scientist puts out a video last year saying vaccines are totally safe and effective, never hurt anybody, but then she's in a meeting with her colleagues admitting they've covered everything up.
[57:14.000 --> 57:38.000]  This is scandal beyond scandal. This is all of our lives we're talking about and only you can make sure the story gets out and is forced to break worldwide and really bring down this giant hoax that is medical tyranny through Big Pharma being given total liability protection to operate however they want and do whatever they want a recipe for absolute medical Armageddon.
[57:44.000 --> 57:50.000]  If you're coming up, I'm going to cover the biggest stories yet stay with us seriously. This is critical.
[57:50.000 --> 58:02.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate infowars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate and we're not giving up.
[58:02.000 --> 58:16.000]  This is why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us. That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[58:16.000 --> 58:27.000]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[58:27.000 --> 58:37.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[58:37.000 --> 58:50.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake, they fear the fact that we are alive, they fear the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[58:50.000 --> 59:08.000]  I keep my eye on the news all the time, but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about two weeks ago, the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine to be given inside the United States.
[59:08.000 --> 59:18.000]  And it is an experimental vaccine. It is live. It's not even attenuated. They've just genetically modified it so it's supposedly not lethal.
[59:18.000 --> 59:26.000]  Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed and maimed so many. This is just crazy.
[59:26.000 --> 59:33.000]  And the Congos have the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started giving the vaccine there in the last few years.
[59:33.000 --> 59:40.000]  Oh, and of course, opening the borders up here and letting people in unfettered the Democrats distribute across the country.
[59:40.000 --> 59:50.000]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity. And it is an attempted Ebola assault on America. This is the New World Order.
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  That's not something special. For anybody trying to have a future, anybody trying to build a world, you're going to face opposition.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  Just like the energy it takes to suck oxygen into your lungs. It's the animating contest of liberty.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  You know, I want to hit a bunch of news on the side of this quick segment, but I just wanted to point out that Caitlyn Bennett and the great work she does as an InfoWars reporter is amazing.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  And the stuff she catches just being all over the country, mainly on the East Coast, is amazing.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:54.000]  So here's the video. It's posted to infowars.com if you're a radio listener.
[1:00:54.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  This is a dim supporter versus a Trump cereal box. We've seen similar things happen to Trump chocolates at Reagan National Airport and others.
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  They had Obama chocolates and Bush chocolates and all of it, but you can't have that Trump chocolate.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  The bullying, the trying to make us submit and the idea that we can't support Trump, it's separate from Trump.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  It's the bullying that they control our ideas and they control what we can believe in if they intimidate us, we'll back down.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  Well, history shows that doesn't work with any civilization that's worth its salt.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  And I believe America is not just going to not put up with it, but it is already exploding against it in a big way.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  Just like the UK just did about all the pressure against them, not to do Brexit.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Trump has been to Trump mode. Make markets great again.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:56.000]  Come, $20.
[1:01:56.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  Let me see, let me see, let me see.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Get in the cutters.
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  They're not defeating Trump himself, the American people.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  Okay.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  Did they like steal that?
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  Honestly, I cannot believe they just did that, you know.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  Did they steal it or did they buy it?
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:34.000]  They actually paid and it is exactly what Americans are entitled to do.
[1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:38.000]  Go ahead and smash it, all right? That's your choice.
[1:02:38.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  Oh, there you go.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  All right, that's insane.
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  As the founder of Trump Serials, it's absolutely their choice.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  And I implore all of you, do what you want, put it on the top of your story.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  They were, I guess, in Toledo for a Trump event.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  That's a good point.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  And they attacked the Trump Serials.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  They care about the environment so much, but they just left the trash there.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  Look at all this trash.
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  Okay, so just look at all this trash. This is where the protesters are.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:14.000]  Interesting. Okay, yeah, so your motto is kick the shit out of it or put it on your fridge.
[1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Absolutely. Look, if you're an American and do whatever you want with it, right, it's your liberty.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  Go ahead.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  All right, I love it.
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  They pay for it, go ahead. If you're not, I'm going to tackle you.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  Yeah, I was like, whoa.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  All right, interesting.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  So what you guys just witnessed was peak Trump derangement syndrome.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  A grown man spent money to buy a box of Trumpos, Trump Serial,
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  just so he could kick it and film himself while doing it.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  An adult, a grown man, kicking a box of cereal out in public and filming himself doing it.
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  I have never seen a more ridiculous display of Trump derangement syndrome.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  That's what we have in 2020.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  I really thought that the derangement syndrome might get cured here in the new year, in the new decade.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  I don't think it is really sad to see what he's going to do to his other boxes of cereal at home,
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  and he wins again this year.
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  Because the algorithm promotes anybody doing that, but it's not real people.
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  It's just AI.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:18.000]  But the dumbest people buy into it.
[1:04:18.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  That's really what's sad about it.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  It kicks it up the leg. It is good.
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  It's a good kick up.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  It's a wild cereal box.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  This is the only place in the world you can get Trump cereal,
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  except for our online store, Trumpserials.com.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  They definitely need to be a sponsor, because they're not yet.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  I need some Trump cereal.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  Just this alone left us going to craze.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  I've never seen this box of cereal before.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  But it's the only place in the world it is.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Absolutely. You're right.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  How do we know that it didn't false flag this?
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  That's the question.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  m4store.com.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:04.000]  We have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in,
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  And it doesn't compete with Super Blue.
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:18.000]  That's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride free.
[1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  The adult or the children's.
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:24.000]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers.
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  People love it.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium,
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  that also cleans, but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it,
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  to knock out the bacteria that causes gensivitis.
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  This is all proven. You can make claims with this.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  But I had to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  We're really proud of it. It funds the operation in FullWareStore.com.
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  That's why we're still on air, thanks to you.
[1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  We are live broadcasting worldwide on this live Sunday,
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  January 12th, 2020 transmission.
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  It's only the listeners and viewers out there watching right now
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  that made this all possible.
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  I want to hit our next first big piece of news,
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  but first, I wanted to mention Bandod video
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  that now gets millions of views a day,
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  thanks to all of you spreading the word.
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:58.000]  And that top video, Leak video,
[1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  Head UN Scientist admits vaccines are killing people.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:06.000]  Now, that's the big Friday report we put out
[1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  where she publicly says other totally safe no problems.
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  And then in her vaccine summit that was internal that got leaked
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  from December 3rd, she admits it's killing people
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  and they're covering it up.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  That's the report from Friday.
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  We're talking about the report from today.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  I'm going to pull it up on my phone for you.
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  And inputwars.com.
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  I'm going to do that for you right now.
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  The big one we just aired last hour.
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:40.000]  And here it is, DocumentCam shot please.
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  Biggest medical scandal in history breaking,
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  UN comes clean, admits vaccine death,
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  which coverups on a planetary scale.
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  And it's got all the big head scientists admitting it.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  Now, in the past, they always admitted vaccines
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  could hurt you, but lately they said,
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  You know, the inserts say it.
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  So it's a big, big deal.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:10.000]  And the only way that video and those articles
[1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  and the internal UN footage gets out is if you share it.
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  If you have the nice folks at Google and Facebook and Twitter,
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:18.000]  it doesn't matter.
[1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  It's the head scientist, the World Health Organization, the UN.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  It doesn't matter.
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  It's all the other top scientists.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  Literally 20 hours of it we have linked on the site.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  They're already out.
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  We got calls tonight saying it's a deep fake.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  It's not.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  It's all admitted.
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  But they're, the media's calling us going,
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  is that a deep fake?
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  Because that just makes you question instead of,
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  you know, in a couple of days when they admit it's real,
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  there'll be news articles about it.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:46.000]  You'll never remember they said it was a deep fake.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  Just to make you question so you won't share it right now.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:56.000]  Just like the Iranians said they needed to shoot down that plane.
[1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  We told you they did.
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:58.000]  The evidence was clear.
[1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  We were right.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  Because see, we don't study football or baseball
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  or how to act cool.
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  We study how the world really works here.
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  And that's what we do is stay focused.
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  And that is such a big, big article.
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  Now let me move on to the next piece of news.
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000]  And talk about carbon taxes.
[1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  You see, carbon taxes have been set up by the big families
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  that own the major banks and the major stock exchanges.
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  And they want AI computers to track every human activity
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  and put taxes on everything they say creates carbon
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  that they say hurts the earth.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  But China and India and Mexico and 160 other plus countries,
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  they have to make no cuts.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  Only Australia and New Zealand, European countries in the west
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  and the US and Canada have to make the cuts.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  And that was done under Obama.
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  And you saw energy prices skyrocket.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  You saw the economy falter.
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:14.000]  Because that's the plan.
[1:10:14.000 --> 1:10:20.000]  China makes none of these cuts.
[1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  But I care about the environment.
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  If I think something is really serious
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  and I do the research that's true, I support it.
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  But this isn't about the environment.
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  It's about energy control.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  So Jane Fonda, part of her big billionaire Richie Rich family
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  went on Anderson Cooper and said,
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:46.000]  it feels good to be arrested for civil disobedience
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  because they'd blocked the police or whatever, supposedly.
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  Now, Anderson Cooper normally is on a suit and tie.
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  But when he's a woke activist, he wears a black sweatshirt
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  and hoodie because he's so woke.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  He's not the heir of one of the richest families in the world
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  with trillions, trillions in fake stock market digital numbers.
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  Oh, yeah.
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  No, no, no, no.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  He is a woke dude who tells you how rich people are bad all day,
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  but hides how rich he is.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  He has lots of articles out that he has no money.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  He's got Jane Fonda, the Crip Keeper, from Tells to the Crip on.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  I guess she's the creature from the crate.
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  And she reads this script as an actress would about,
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  the earth's already going to be dead.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  It's all over.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  If you don't do this, carbon's such a big problem.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  But then I've got all the articles here I'm going to show you.
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:52.000]  Glacier Park to remove all glaciers will be gone by 2020 signs.
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  They've been up for a decade.
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  The glaciers in some areas are bigger.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  That's KP, AX News, locally.
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  Arctic summers, ice free by 2013.
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  The Arctic's even bigger now.
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:08.000]  And so is the Antarctic.
[1:12:08.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  But that's BBC.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  BBC 13 years ago.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  Glacier Park in Montana is set to remove the signs.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  Another article on that.
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  Major Greenland Glacier is growing.
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.000]  Earth Observatory, NASA.
[1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  Again, they're getting bigger, not smaller.
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  The three degree world, the cities that will be drowned
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  by global warming.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  London Guardian said that 275 million people will be underwater
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:44.000]  by now, but it didn't happen.
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  It was all a lie.
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  Now the Pentagon tells Bush climate change will destroy us.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  And none of it happened.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  Here they are saying the Earth would freeze by 2020 in 1975
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  when I was one years old by the great ice age that's coming.
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  So Jane Fauntel's Anderson Cooper, it feels good to be arrested
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  for civil disobedience.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:16.000]  And she's up there reading a Rothschild Rockefeller
[1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  carbon tax agenda where they want AI computers from IBM
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  to track everything you do and tax meat, tax travel, tax clothes,
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:28.000]  tax, but all their friends are exempt though,
[1:13:28.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  so they'll obviously take over.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:32.000]  Total authoritarian plan.
[1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  And she sits there with one of the richest people on Earth,
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  Anderson Cooper, talking bad about how people are having kids
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  and all the rest of it.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  Let's play part of this BS right now.
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  This is the first time I've been arrested for civil disobedience
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  and it feels good.
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  Tell me about that.
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:58.000]  Explain that.
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  Well, when you know this...
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  I mean, how disingenuous is the Vanderbilt air?
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  His parents at eight put him into the New York fashion show scene
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  knowing what that would do.
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  The other son was throwing out a window.
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  These are some really bad people.
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  So the older son doesn't want to get with the program.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  Well, out the window.
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  This guy is eight, nine years old, put in the New York fashion scene.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  Talk about Swiss tunnel.
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  So he's thrown right into the piranha nest
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:34.000]  and now he's wearing a woke jogging suit because he's so...
[1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  I'm sorry.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  With Jane Fonda to tell us how we need to cut only our energy off.
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  Let's continue.
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  Well, when you know there's a crisis looming when just about a hundred percent
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  of the climate scientists are saying that the situation is drastic.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:54.000]  Stop again.
[1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  I'm going to play this unedited without me jumping in live cutting it.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  I just showed you where they said by 2013 total melted ice caps.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  By 2017, New York, LA, it's all flooded.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  We're all dead.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.000]  I mean, everybody knows they did that and it's the same thing.
[1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  Oh, I'm such a hero.
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  It's a climate emergency.
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  It's imminent.
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  All the scientists agree.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000]  No, they don't.
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  Liar.
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:24.000]  But this woman comes out of that thing they call LA where the worst people on Earth went
[1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:28.000]  and set it up and then set up cults to control people.
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  And then they use it as a weapon system, just launch satanic mortars.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  Everyone else.
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  And I just love the fact that Hollywood is a giant wreck.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  And even if they're golden globes, they're insult this pedophile trash to their faces.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  They are the edifice of the rotting maggot covered escarpment that is now being pulled
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:48.000]  in the mouth of hell.
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  And I can't wait.
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  Oh, it's so beautiful, Jane Fonda.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Your journey to hell is almost complete, you ugly sack of garbage.
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:14.000]  In a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  Your bang for your buck, fear, gets you great products at great prices that literally fund
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  And so it's very simple.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy, which God
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  110% God will finish the move.
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  I want to attack.
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:42.000]  I want to go after the globalist.
[1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  and your family to fight for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:50.000]  in the game.
[1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I got for us, for myself and my family, for
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  your family.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  Because we're in this together.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:59.000]  Infowarstore.com.
[1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  Sunday was supposed to be the last day that we could offer a store ride for shipping.
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  Double Patriot Point was 75% off with our big year in sale.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  Because a lot of the products have already sold out.
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  Most of the others are about to sell out.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  But quite frankly, I've been working on so many big stories that are breaking right now
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:18.000]  that I have not come up with new specials.
[1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:22.000]  And we're already so close to selling out all these products that I'm just going to
[1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:29.000]  And we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines.
[1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  It'll take weeks, months for them all to come back in.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  Some come in in weeks, some come in in like three months.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  A lot of stuff's coming back in next week.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  So I've just decided because of the inventory issues and all the rest of it.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  And because some of these were selling at losses, are making people buy a lot of other stuff
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  and we are making a profit.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:47.000]  So I'm going to just keep the sale going.
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:49.000]  But only for 48 hours maximum.
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  And then we've got to stop it.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  Infowarstore.com.
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  Year end, now 2020 mega blowout sale.
[1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:56.000]  Infowarstore.com.
[1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  Biggest sales we're ever going to have.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:02.000]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  except for maybe the last week and a half.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  So here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  toothpaste I've ever tried.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  And it's fluoride free.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  It feels so good.
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  I love tuning in to Owen Troyer.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:04.000]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  But I'll be honest with you, we run during the breaks a lot of news reports
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:13.000]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[1:19:13.000 --> 1:19:14.000]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  But here's the bottom line.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.000]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.000]  And I want to expand the face of the globalist, not contract.
[1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:21.000]  I don't want them to win.
[1:19:21.000 --> 1:19:24.000]  So listen, you've got this guarantee for me.
[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:27.000]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[1:19:27.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  But we've got products you already really need like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  These will change your life.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  Check it all out.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:43.000]  Whatever you do, take action and know be part of the Second American Revolution.
[1:19:43.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Be part of Crush the Globalist.
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  And get great products at the same time.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:27.000]  Unifying humanity towards a future of empowerment where the individual could choose their own destiny
[1:20:27.000 --> 1:20:34.000]  and decide whether to join with God and to travel through eternity or fall and be destroyed.
[1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:37.000]  That's our commission.
[1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:39.000]  That's everything we stand for.
[1:20:39.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  And as the enemy is given more power by their God to fight us,
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  God is going to give us as much power as we can handle to stand against the enemy.
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  But are we willing to be in the presence of the Creator?
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  That's the question because you feel very naked.
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:20:59.000]  But it's our job.
[1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  We're willing to do it.
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  We're going to do it.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  We're going to win together.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  But it is you who carries the light in the dark of the night that will reach the next outpost.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  Those signal towers through eternity.
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:17.000]  All those that stood for what was right because they knew it was true.
[1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  They felt God's spirit burning inside their heart.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  It's because of them and all those things they did, both great and small,
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  that we have a chance now.
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  And we see such a huge awakening.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  We see so much empowerment.
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  We see so much evil being exposed.
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  We see the acts of the corrupt being exposed so quickly.
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  So what do they do?
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:47.000]  They try to normalize evil in every way.
[1:21:47.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  I'm going to finish up with Hanoi Jane.
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  And then I'm going to get into textbooks promoting the vampire lifestyle
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:05.000]  in the fallen section of our great nation, California.
[1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000]  It's all coming up.
[1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  So I was perusing news and information this morning.
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  And I saw an article that really caught my eye.
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  And it was Australia's Indigenous people have a solution for the country's bushfires.
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  And it's been around for 50,000 years.
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:33.000]  Now, nothing against the Aborigines in Australia.
[1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  Very interesting, probably some of the most psychic people around.
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  They've studied it.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:39.000]  Even mainland universities have picked it up.
[1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  It's a powerful, powerful day.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  But it's like saying Aborigines have figured out wiping their asses.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  Every culture creates fire breaks and clears out brush or they're idiots.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  You use it for fuel anyways to cook your food and create potash for your crops.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:03.000]  You don't leave a bunch of fallen down trees and brush piled up
[1:23:03.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  because if there's a lightning strike, it gets on fire.
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:07.000]  It builds up.
[1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:09.000]  It becomes a raging fire.
[1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:13.000]  So for more than 30 years, Australia under leftist policies,
[1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  we've covered it last week, will not let, covered on Monday,
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  will not let the municipalities clean out the brush.
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Well, now CNN goes, oh wait, Aboriginals in Trump agree,
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  clear brush and use control burns and stop wildfires.
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  When California was burning last year, Trump went,
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  I learned they have a law where they don't rake the forest
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  and co-bear and all the different shows made fun of them.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  They go, oh, how do I rake it?
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:51.000]  Show me how I rake it, which is what you actually do.
[1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  He comes from all over the world.
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  He's asked me times like he's in Europe and places like or Asia.
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:57.000]  What are they doing?
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  Oh, they're raking the forest, sir.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  Because they get, but people, a lot of rakes and hatchets and stuff,
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:03.000]  and that's what they do.
[1:24:03.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  They rake out the undergrowth and then use it for composting
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  because it's dangerous.
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  But again, that's taking everything Trump does common sense.
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  And it's not like Trump's Mr. Goody two shoes or something.
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  It's like they passed rewilding regulations at the UN in 1982.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  And then in 1992, they passed the 1021 Bush senior signed on to it.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  But the Congress didn't ratify it.
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  But still, Colorado and California and a bunch of other states ratified
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  the UN policy themselves to just not clean out the forest
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:49.000]  or create forest breaks, fire breaks.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  And so I just saw that article and I'm like, this is insane.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  Because they actually say in the senior article, scrub and rake the forest.
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  Word for word, what Trump said, because that's what it's called is raking the forest.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  In fact, we've owned property and stuff and not had somebody leasing it before.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  They come and go, you know, you got some six foot tall, five foot tall grass over there.
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  There's a big fire.
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  You're going to burn our farm down.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  Let us cut that and sell that as, hey, and of course they want to cut the hay,
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  but they're actually telling the truth.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  They're like, hey, why aren't you selling that?
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  Hey, it's worth money and we don't want that to burn down our farm.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.000]  And my dad just this year is like, well, you're right.
[1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  I just hadn't been thinking about that.
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  And he got paid $6,000 for one field.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  Raking the forest, raking the fields.
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  But again, I'm up here like talking about and then you put your shoes on,
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  you tie your shoelaces and then we're not giving people rocket science stuff.
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  But see, that's what we're dealing with is where they assault common sense.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:25:57.000]  Men and women.
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  Men can't have babies.
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  You shouldn't have men and women's bathrooms shang their women.
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  But they're assaulting that.
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  And Jane Fonda, who got up on top, anti-aircraft guns, you know, shoot,
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  reportedly supporting the shoot down of our aircraft in Vietnam.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  She's up there worth hundreds of millions of dollars lecturing us about how our
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  energy is bad and how we're all going to flood.
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:19.000]  Now we're all going to die.
[1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  But all that's an admitted fraud.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  Her brother said, kidnap Trump's children and rape them.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  Finally, her brother died a few months later.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  Probably isn't too good luck.
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  He's probably on his way out already, wasn't he?
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  So let's finish up with her and the globalist up there.
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  And it's like, oh, I'm wearing a hoodie.
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:45.000]  I'm anti for tonight.
[1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:51.000]  The totally fake synthetic fed into the system when he was eight years old
[1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  by his evil family, Anderson Cooper.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  Here he is.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  This is the first time I've been arrested for civil disobedience.
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  And it feels good.
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:01.000]  Tell me about that.
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  Explain that.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  Feels good.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  Well, when you know there's a crisis looming when just about 100% of the climate
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  scientists are saying that the situation is drastic.
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  It pauses again.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:17.000]  You mean 100% of the UN hired?
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  We just said all the UN scientists and the vaccines are killing people as a cover-up.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  I mean, look, are you talking about all these ice caps that got bigger?
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  You know, the Glacier Park in the Arctic summers and no ice by 2013?
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  You're a lying maggot.
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  You're a gigantic, filthy, globalist piece of garbage.
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  Sorry, continue.
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  Students around the world striking from school on Fridays.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  Total Soros funded.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  To protest and begging older people to join them and help save the planet.
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  Plus again, the schools nationwide and worldwide go.
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:51.000]  Go do whatever you want.
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  The principal says leave for the day.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  And a lot of the kids are going, screw that.
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:55.000]  This is BS.
[1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  You just want to put a carbon tax on us.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  The kids are so smart.
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  They're going, wait a minute.
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  You're saying leave and go protest?
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:01.000]  The school is?
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  That's not cool.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:07.000]  Imagine if Ferris Buller's principal's like, Ferris, I want you to take the day off and
[1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  steal the Ferrari.
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  Ferris would have been there getting straight A's.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  I mean, think about that.
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  Here's this crone up there telling you that, oh, you need to skip school and go out and
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  protest to shut down our energy.
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  Let's end this segment with her.
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  Help save the planet.
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  You don't feel very good if you're not doing enough.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  And when you're asking herself as the savior, you think that pig talks about the 2 million
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:39.000]  Chinese in death camps.
[1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  You think that pig talks about Roman Polanski?
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:43.000]  No.
[1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:47.000]  You think Anderson Cooper literally put in to leftist rape dungeons with his little kid,
[1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  tears?
[1:28:48.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  Because they're slaves.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:51.000]  So don't see him as an enemy.
[1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  They're nobodies.
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate infowars, it's because
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:23.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  destroy the innocent.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:41.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheep dogs to
[1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:48.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:50.000]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  They fear the fact that we love God, and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  charge.
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:02.000]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War, but I know you're like me.
[1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:04.000]  You don't want my thanks.
[1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:08.000]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters, and you
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:10.000]  want them off your back and off your children's back.
[1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:11.000]  You know what?
[1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:14.000]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:21.000]  And it's why Info Wars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to
[1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:26.000]  focus the people on taking action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future
[1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:29.000]  for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[1:30:29.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Info War, and I want to
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:37.000]  thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:41.000]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at Info Wars, I want
[1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:46.000]  to thank you all because you are the Info War, and you know that's not just words, that's
[1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:47.000]  reality.
[1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:49.000]  You have made history.
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:51.000]  We have made history together.
[1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:58.000]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:04.000]  It's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know.
[1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:10.000]  Everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have
[1:31:10.000 --> 1:31:15.000]  taken the flu vaccine right before they get it, and that they get the worst case of the
[1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  flu of their life.
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  But still, like concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:27.000]  clinics to get the injections.
[1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:31.000]  It doesn't matter that studies, mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show that when
[1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:36.000]  you take the flu vaccine, it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season
[1:31:36.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  by lowering your immunity, it goes on and on, or the fact that the governments have never
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:48.000]  guessed the next year's mutation, that the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked.
[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  But how do you prop up a hoax?
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  You keep the giant hoax going.
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:01.000]  I want to talk about super silver, white, and toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except
[1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  for maybe the last week and a half, and I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:07.000]  I've ever tried.
[1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:09.000]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[1:32:09.000 --> 1:32:11.000]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[1:32:11.000 --> 1:32:17.000]  So here I am telling people, super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste
[1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:21.000]  I've ever tried, and I'm 45 years old, and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[1:32:21.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  And it's fluoride free.
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:27.000]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after
[1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  It feels so good.
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:46.000]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:33:01.000]  because I like the way it feels.
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:28.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:28.000 --> 1:33:33.000]  Here for now.
[1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  The seasons don't fear the reaper.
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:43.000]  That's why we've got to give our full energy now to our species.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  So when we're gone, our energy, our will, our communications, our written word, our resistance
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  goes forward.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  Our spirits are going up the next level, but we love our children, don't we?
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  Their children and their children.
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  Do you love your great, great, great granddaughter and grandson as much as you love your daughter?
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:03.000]  We love them even more because they came from you.
[1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:05.000]  They went through that great arc of time.
[1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  They must be defended.
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:13.000]  Well, the seasons don't fear the reaper.
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.000]  So let's get into the sickening information that I covered.
[1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:21.000]  And I don't cover this to give power to this sickening information because I don't want to read this
[1:34:21.000 --> 1:34:23.000]  and I don't want to cover this.
[1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  But I don't cover this to give it power or to submit to it.
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  I do it to show what's happening.
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  I was just walking through the officer in the break and a couple people said, man, we read that article and we follow the links.
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  It's like official textbook and required learning for eighth graders to learn how to drink blood.
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:45.000]  All they have sex and vampirism.
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  I said, I know.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  People are like, that's California.
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:57.000]  That's L.A.
[1:34:57.000 --> 1:34:59.000]  The city of Ampars.
[1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  The city of lost dreams.
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  The city of stolen dreams.
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  And, you know, I've been in a few movies and people asked me to be at them and they tried to try to get me into Hollywood and
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:17.000]  I talked to people and I said, well, who runs this place?
[1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.000]  And they said, well, the devil runs.
[1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  Remember the video we played of all these different so-called rock stars and people from Bob Dylan on down saying, you know, I had to sell my soul to Satan to be here.
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  People say, oh, well, they're just doing that because they know I'm a Christian.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  They just mess with me.
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:39.000]  And they're like, they're like, no, we're not messing with you.
[1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  We really need you to put yourself to Satan.
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  You're going to get a lot of money as soon as you do that.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:45.000]  Just sign that contract.
[1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:47.000]  But first, pledge yourself to the devil.
[1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  We need you to do this right now.
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  That's happened to me three times.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:35:57.000]  It's happened to Mark Dice once.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  It's happened to everybody that gets offered a real deal in Hollywood.
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  I'd say about 90% of Hollywood before was run by Satanists.
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  Now the Chicoms own a lot of it.
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:07.000]  They're so evil.
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  They don't say they want you to worship the devil.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  They say, you're going to do exactly what we say.
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:19.000]  And then you see the stuff they finance, man.
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:25.000]  If that ain't the devil, I'll kiss your ass.
[1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  So the Chicoms in Hollywood getting married, getting hitched is a match made in hell.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:33.000]  It was meant to happen.
[1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  So you think of Hollywood as some, oh, at least I used to like 20 something years ago.
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:43.000]  It's cool. It's stupid and a bunch of weirdos, but it's still big movies and art and everything,
[1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  but man, it's the worst people because they want control of your vision, your creativity,
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  your destiny.
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  They want control of your imagination.
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  And so Hollywood produced a lot of amazing stuff, but only to capture us,
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  only to put us into that trance.
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  And then once they had us, you turn on Netflix, you turn on a movie.
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  90% of it is anti-human, anti-family, anti-God, pure death.
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  It's like running around in the middle of Africa or India trying to find a King Cobra to bite your ass.
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  I mean, that, it's poison.
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:23.000]  It's bad.
[1:37:23.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  It's scary.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:29.000]  You don't want to be around it.
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  And a lot of adults are awake to it, but the children aren't.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:35.000]  So that's what it targets.
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  What does evil target it?
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  It targets children because they don't know how to defend themselves.
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:45.000]  So I go to info wars.com today and I see an article linked to California newspapers and
[1:37:45.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  they're just like, oh, parents are right wing parents are protesting sex education.
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Let me look at that link.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  I look at it and it's like blood drinking, devil worship, forced curriculum.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  And even I couldn't believe it.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:13.000]  So I went and I read the damn textbook, whole pages on how to, like, like I was sitting there
[1:38:13.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  and I'm like, I don't know what that means.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  Let me, I'm like, I got to look this up.
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:21.000]  And it was an assault on me to look it up.
[1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  It was, it was, it was an attack on my brain, but I did it.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:33.000]  So I could tell you what was there, but imagine the children.
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  And I'm not going to say on air what is in those pages of the children, but it's brutalization.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  It's blood drinking, cutting yourself.
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  And then it even gets into, or you can just try to suck other people's energy.
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  And then as soon as you think that you're going to be mean to people and just try to be a jerk.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  I mean, this is the most, if there was a cult doing this, they'd all be arrested.
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  But when it's the government of California and Adam Schiff, who's in police reports, like the black guys they get,
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:07.000]  for every reason, one of these cults are in the torture of black people.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  I haven't figured it all out yet, but that's what they want, black energy.
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  And these black people are like fighting their lives, big black dudes are fighting them like,
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:19.000]  and like ed bucks, like dragging them back in and like jabbing needles into them.
[1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:27.000]  And Adam Schiff's in there in a, in a, in a Pharaoh outfit.
[1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  I mean, think about what these people are doing.
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  You're like, well, that sounds insane.
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  Hell, the textbooks tell you how to cut yourself and drink blood for Satan.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:43.000]  Like, oh, sexual preference, drinking blood for Satan.
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  I remember being out in LA and people going, well, I'm like, well, what runs things around here?
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  Well, there's the Jews and there's the Chinese and there's the Italian mafia,
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  but really it's just the devil worshipers and the vampires.
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  I mean, that's a quote.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  And I'm convinced that Satan lives in Los Angeles, city of Los Angeles.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  I'll think of the name tells you, like, yeah, Los Angeles, right there.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  And you get there and it's all these girls getting off the bus every day,
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  thinking they're about to be famous.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  And the lucky ones are the ones doing 50 dude gangbanks and getting HIV.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  Others just never show up again and they're getting their heads chopped off
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:33.000]  and people are drinking their blood.
[1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  And so what's the next level of perversion?
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  Well, the next level is just teach the kids right out in the open how to drink blood.
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:45.000]  And that's in the textbooks now how to drink blood.
[1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  You're always wondering, like, what's the next level?
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:51.000]  Well, the next level is that.
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  Like the Old Testament says and they dug up all these places.
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  Old Testament said exists and wherever they says it exists, they dig it up.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  Like, oh my gosh, old city right here and like everybody's dead.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:03.000]  And there's like 10 times the skeletons of kids and there are adults.
[1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  They're like, well, there was a civilization based on killing kids.
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  They'd have like women that were just supposed to have babies every nine months to be killed.
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  And the archaeologists are all freaked out.
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  They found them in Germany.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  They found them in Mexico.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  They're finding it everywhere because there's a satanic off world spirit
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  programming humans to do this stuff and suck the energy out of children
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  while they're being tortured to death.
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  And now you can just open up the textbook and required reading and a test
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  is how to do things medically that at 45 I didn't know about till today.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  When I saw blood play, I'd heard about that from FBI guys.
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  It was like killing kids and rolling around the blood.
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  And the kids flop around at it and sure as hell, that's what they're teaching.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  I was like, wait, blood plays like where they torture somebody and cut them up
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  and roll around the blood.
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  And that was it.
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  Old textbook for kids.
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:19.000]  So we sit here.
[1:42:19.000 --> 1:42:21.000]  Well, that's just some subgroup.
[1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  You know, Jones is exaggerating.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:25.000]  No, I'm not exaggerating.
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000]  Here's the vampire lifestyle.
[1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  Can we all about that on Wikipedia?
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  Cool.
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  Or a man who lives as a baby.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  We'll tell you about that when we come back.
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  Play that video for you.
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  You're like, this doesn't make sense.
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  It isn't supposed to.
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  It's an earth killing plan.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  It's a it's a sub third dimension transmission for us to kill each other.
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  We don't have to follow it.
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  We can join with God at any time, but it's all real and it's happening now.
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[1:43:02.000 --> 1:43:05.000]  I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity,
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:21.000]  to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:27.000]  silenced in cyberspace, that most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:39.000]  by spreading the word about newswords.com, infowords.com and banned on video.
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  And that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:50.000]  is at infowords.com forward slash show and banned on video.
[1:43:50.000 --> 1:43:54.000]  So take heart, folks, they've had to censor everybody and show everybody down
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.000]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  Introducing pollen block.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later,
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:35.000]  that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:39.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase,
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:49.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:45:15.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:25.000]  You can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[1:45:25.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:30.000]  It's incredible. So do yourself a favor.
[1:45:30.000 --> 1:45:33.000]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:36.000]  You can't lose, except if you don't take action.
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:43.000]  thanks to your support and God's grace in our action.
[1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:45.000]  But you need these products.
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:51.000]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:55.000]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:58.000]  We're fighting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:03.000]  Sunday was supposed to be the last day that we could offer store-wide free shipping,
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:07.000]  double-patriot points. It was 75% off with our big year in sale.
[1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:10.000]  Because a lot of the products have already sold out.
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000]  Most of the others are about to sell out.
[1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:16.000]  But quite frankly, I've been working on so many big stories that are breaking right now
[1:46:16.000 --> 1:46:18.000]  that I have not come up with new specials.
[1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:21.000]  And we're already so close to selling out all these products
[1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:25.000]  that I'm just going to go ahead and keep the sale going for two more days.
[1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:29.000]  And we're going to basically sell out of all of our major product lines.
[1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:32.000]  It'll take weeks, months for them all to come back in.
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:35.000]  Some come in in weeks, some come in in like three months.
[1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:37.000]  A lot of stuff's coming back in next week.
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:40.000]  So I've just decided because of the inventory issues and all the rest of it.
[1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:42.000]  And because some of these were selling,
[1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:45.000]  losses are making people buy a lot of other stuff and we are making a profit.
[1:46:45.000 --> 1:46:49.000]  So I'm going to just keep the sale going, but only for 48 hours maximum.
[1:46:49.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  And then we've got to stop at infowarstore.com.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:56.000]  The year end, now 2020 mega blowout sale, infowarstore.com.
[1:46:56.000 --> 1:47:16.000]  Biggest sales we're ever going to have.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:47.000]  The thrill is gone.
[1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  The thrill is gone away.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.000]  The thrill is gone baby.
[1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:58.000]  That's right.
[1:47:58.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  The thrill is gone.
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  The thrill of Hollywood, the new world world is gone.
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:07.000]  You know you've done me wrong baby.
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  Put a spell on me.
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  And you'll be sorry someday.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000]  Because I'm awake now.
[1:48:14.000 --> 1:48:16.000]  I see three of you.
[1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:19.000]  The thrill is gone.
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:26.000]  The thrill is gone away from me.
[1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:31.000]  The thrill is gone baby.
[1:48:31.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  Nobody's coming back to CNN.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  Nobody's coming back to Fox News.
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  Nobody's coming back to Hollywood.
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  Because the thrill is gone.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  It's over.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  The spell's broken.
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  It's going to be rough though.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  Because a lot of us have broken the spell.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  The tide's turning against the globalists,
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:03.000]  but there's a lot of people still caught up in it.
[1:49:03.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  And the system is going to have them self-destruct
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  trying to stop us, but it's not going to work.
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:13.000]  You know tomorrow, at Lord Willing, I'll be here.
[1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  7 a.m. Central, four hours.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  7 a.m. on Troyer, 3 p.m. of the war room.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  But the truth is, all these billionaires and people
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  were given power by a system that was already in charge.
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  And it's not a human system.
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  You know I don't look for space aliens on the nightly news
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:43.000]  or the telescope.
[1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:47.000]  I don't look for them on those late night radio shows.
[1:49:47.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  They're all in the history books and they're right there in the Bible.
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  I've used this cheesy analogy a lot because it gets through to people.
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  Like ten years ago, eight years ago, whatever,
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  Pacific Rim came out.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  And they said, we kept looking for aliens in the night sky,
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  but they came through an interdimensional gate
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:09.000]  at the Pacific Rim and the Pacific Ocean.
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:15.000]  And see, that's a good way to think about that.
[1:50:15.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  Because the aliens didn't just show up.
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  They've always been here.
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  And have you actually cracked open Genesis or Ezekiel or Exodus or Revelation?
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  And you read that in today's context.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  Let me tell you, this isn't a Hollywood movie.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  This isn't Netflix you're watching.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:53.000]  This is the real deal.
[1:50:53.000 --> 1:51:01.000]  So, if I just sit here and cover one of these articles,
[1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  people are like, wow, what's that matter?
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  So I'm just going to tell you, if you care about official textbooks
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  in California with required reading about blood play,
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  which again, is a 45-year-old man.
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  I'd only heard about once from the FBI.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  And I went and looked up.
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  It's satanic blood ringing.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:23.000]  The vampires play with the kids.
[1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  The whole spectrum is torture of children.
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  And they're teaching that in California.
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  My God, what else are they doing?
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  Yeah, Peter Thiel has this company where the U.S.
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  is already the number one exporter of underage people's blood.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  And I get it.
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  You're 16.
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  You want to sell your blood?
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  It's got medical attributes.
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  The Queen Mother was obsessed with it.
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  But I remember AP Associated Press reporting 25 years ago when I was first on here.
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  And I've had a fax machine in my radio studio, in my little office.
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  They had my fax number.
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  It was just coming in.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  It was a local AP report about Al Gore's refrigerator fell open.
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  He had a little refrigerator they took with him.
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  He had AIDS with like a, I don't think he had HIV.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  I'm saying he had AIDS, bring around a little refrigerator with a forklift or a little dolly.
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:29.000]  And it fell open with a bunch of blood.
[1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  He said, oh, that's in case something happens to me.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  But the truth was, he was getting blood transfusions every day.
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  And so I don't like to sit here before the show and go, what's the most scary thing I can talk about?
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:55.000]  Here, let's come on here and tell everybody's vampires.
[1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  I kind of already know that.
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  And then I'm ignoring it.
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:03.000]  And then it's like another article, another article, another article.
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  I see everybody's a vampire.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  I mean, that, that one tenth of 1% that run things.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  They don't live forever, but they've got a spirit that is so committed to using people that they are typally then are obsessed with getting children's blood and figuring out laws to be passed so parents can convince their five-year-old to go give bags of blood to put into their arms.
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  It's a vampire spirit.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  Vampires aren't what Hollywood tells you they are.
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  Vampires are selfish.
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  They're undead.
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  They don't have Christ.
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  And they want to hurt innocents and they have a hunger to hurt innocents because they're just vehicles of something interdimensionally that is siphoning off life force to them and harvesting our planet.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:05.000]  And God is saying, I built this planet and gave you power to join me, but you have free will.
[1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  So if you let these vampires feed on you, you will not be with me.
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  And if you let vampires feed on children, you are the most damn group of people there is.
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  Think about that.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  And so like if this was just the meanderings of some madman on air, they wouldn't be so obsessed, they wouldn't be working around the clock to shut us down.
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:33.000]  But no, these are not the meanderings of a madman.
[1:54:33.000 --> 1:54:40.000]  This is the reality, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  And if I seemed enraged, it's just because I'm tuned into God and I can tell you God is not pleased.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  And God says, you're right.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:53.000]  I cry.
[1:54:53.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  I had to have friends.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  I had to have children.
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  I had to have creations.
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  I don't want to be all alone in the universe with other consciousness, but I can't believe that God creates all this freedom and then people join evil.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  But that's the way the universe works, so God could be totally alone forever or God could create free will.
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:19.000]  And it's up to us to go out and make sure that people don't join with evil and understand that God's real.
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  And that's really our great commission.
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  And if we weren't obsessed with entertainment and movies and being cool and being part of the system and being on red carpets that mean nothing,
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:35.000]  then there wouldn't be anybody falling to evil.
[1:55:35.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  We're not good shepherds.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  And I don't say that to even put people down.
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:47.000]  I'm just telling you that there's no reason schools should be teaching all this.
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  There's no reason we are stand down are not standing up.
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  Our acquiescence to this is now God is the point where I have major colleges saying, don't put on your entrance form, whether you're a man or woman.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  That is an assault on the species itself fundamentally.
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  I'm out of time.
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  Like I said, Lord willing, I'll be back tomorrow live.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  I can now finally tell you, I cut out just today.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  The big super special of the end of 2019 is over.
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  It runs through tomorrow morning.
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  There'll be new sales tomorrow.
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:25.000]  This was the biggest, deepest cell ever.
[1:56:25.000 --> 1:56:27.000]  So these are the final minutes of it.
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  So finally, it will be over tomorrow because I just cut ads again here today.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  Whether it's a pack power stacks, 75% off brain force plus 60% off all 12.
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:39.000]  60% off by Jerusalem 60% off for also next three 60% off.
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  Vaso beats 50% off super silver.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  Silver bullet 995.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  The incredible whitening toothpaste 50% off super silver toothpaste.
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:51.000]  50% off.
[1:56:51.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  It's all there.
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  And it is the final hours now.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  I've been so busy the last three days.
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  It said final hours, but this is the end of the sale forever.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  And we're in 2020.
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  So thank you all for your support.
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  And I want to thank the crew for the great job they've done as well.
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  And Lord willing, we will be back here tomorrow live.
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  With the David 98 a.m.
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  Myself at 11 a.m.
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  And I went for it at 3 p.m.
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:19.000]  But it's crazy to realize that info wars is the tip of the spear.
[1:57:19.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  It's crazy to realize that it's really up to us.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  But that's where we are.
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  And it's we're going to do it.
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  And we're going to ask God for guidance and to lead us and direct us.
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  And in the end, we're going to win.
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:32.000]  It's going to be rough.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  But the children literally being torn to pieces right now are counting on us.
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  So let's be strong.
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  Let's do this together.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:39.000]  We can an image.
[1:57:39.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  Jesus Christ that ends this live transmission.
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:42.000]  I salute you all.
[1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:49.000]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info wars,
[1:57:49.000 --> 1:57:51.000]  it's because we're awake.
[1:57:51.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  We're alive.
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:53.000]  We're passionate.
[1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:56.000]  And we're not giving up.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:58:00.000]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's
[1:58:00.000 --> 1:58:05.000]  plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about
[1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:06.000]  us.
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:09.000]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting.
[1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:14.000]  These scumbags, the globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they
[1:58:14.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:28.000]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheep dogs to
[1:58:28.000 --> 1:58:32.000]  stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:35.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[1:58:35.000 --> 1:58:38.000]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  And that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:55.000]  I keep my eye on the news all the time, but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about
[1:58:55.000 --> 1:59:05.000]  two weeks ago, the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine to be given inside the
[1:59:05.000 --> 1:59:08.000]  United States and it is an experimental vaccine.
[1:59:08.000 --> 1:59:10.000]  It is live.
[1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:12.000]  It's not even attenuated.
[1:59:12.000 --> 1:59:16.000]  They've just genetically modified it, so it's supposedly not lethal.
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed and made so many.
[1:59:22.000 --> 1:59:24.000]  This is just crazy.
[1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:29.000]  And the Congos have the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started giving the
[1:59:29.000 --> 1:59:31.000]  vaccine there in the last few years.
[1:59:31.000 --> 1:59:36.000]  Oh, and of course, open the borders up here and letting people in unvetted the Democrats
[1:59:36.000 --> 1:59:38.000]  distribute across the country.
[1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:41.000]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity.
[1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:45.000]  And it is an attempted Ebola assault on America.
[1:59:45.000 --> 2:00:03.000]  This is the New World Order.
