[00:00.000 --> 00:07.000]  It's Monday, March 6th, 2023.
[00:07.000 --> 00:14.000]  A big broadcast tonight every day.
[00:14.000 --> 00:21.000]  Michael Malison more in the studio.
[00:21.000 --> 00:26.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.000]  We have got a transmission for you today.
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.000]  I've done a lot of research and a lot of work and have loaded for bear.
[00:36.000 --> 00:40.000]  We have massive escalation in war with Russia and China.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  We have new documents coming out that Fauci directly blocked.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  The fact that the virus came out of the Wuhan lab.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.000]  We have the UK government documents confirmed, public, they're not denying it,
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  that they said we're going to release a new variant to terrorize the public
[00:56.000 --> 01:00.000]  into submission to collapse the economy.
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.000]  We have got the left's attempt at race war going into high gear.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.000]  We've got a bunch of studies old and new on 5G causing cancer
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  and some video demonstrations of it.
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.000]  We have the Biden administration makes stunning admission on climate change
[01:18.000 --> 01:24.000]  in leaked memo that they do not want greater energy security
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.000]  and want to cut off the American people's energy,
[01:27.000 --> 01:30.000]  that their policy is to cut off our energy.
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  Now we can look at the policy in form and in function
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  we don't need to have a leak memo to know that,
[01:36.000 --> 01:39.000]  but it's also nice to know that it's premeditated and it's confirmed
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  and they know exactly what they're doing.
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  But as Alexander Shultz and Eason said, they know that we know.
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  We know that they know.
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.000]  We all know, but they still deny it.
[01:54.000 --> 01:55.000]  I kind of butchered that.
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.000]  You guys pull up the actual Alexander Shultz and Eason quote about,
[01:59.000 --> 02:03.000]  we know, they know that we know, and it just goes on perfectly describe
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  how it works to live inside an authoritarian, totalitarian system.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  It's just over the top while.
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  Also, not just Walmart, but other major chains are closing stores
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  in major cities around the country because the crime is so horrible,
[02:18.000 --> 02:20.000]  they're losing money in them.
[02:20.000 --> 02:23.000]  But big corporations are willing to do that because they want to break
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  the average person as well.
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  So even when big box stores can't make it, you know, the general public
[02:28.000 --> 02:30.000]  really can't as well.
[02:30.000 --> 02:33.000]  Got a big stack of news on replacement migration where the left
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  out of one side of their mouth here in Europe say,
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.000]  white people are bad.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.000]  We want to get rid of them.
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  We'll say, hey, you've got these memos and statements in UN plans
[02:41.000 --> 02:42.000]  that white people are bad.
[02:42.000 --> 02:43.000]  Oh, no, we don't.
[02:43.000 --> 02:44.000]  You're insane.
[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000]  We're going to try to pass laws to arrest you.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  Well, they have passed them in Europe and the UK and Canada.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  If you say that, but it's not just the Democrats that are doing that,
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  like in Washington state, their attorney generals introduced a bill
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  for the Ministry of Truth, which targets conservatives opposing
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  election fraud and vaccine mandates would make them a crime.
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  He actually says it in the video, but it gets worse.
[03:09.000 --> 03:16.000]  We have Florida GOP, a senior member of the Sanis's support group
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  declares war on First Amendment to combat anti-Semitism.
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  He says, you will spend jail time for your free speech.
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.000]  So the silver lining of the Sanis, the shine is really wearing off
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  of him in many ways.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  And that's not because I think Trump's perfect or either.
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.000]  I'm just going to cover the facts of we can see tyranny from the
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  right wing, not just the left wing as well.
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.000]  We don't just mindlessly defend the right wing here.
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  In fact, I would even call myself right wing at the end of the day.
[03:46.000 --> 03:52.000]  I'm a pro-human, common sense, pro-family, pro-God, pro-self-defense,
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.000]  pro-America, populist.
[03:54.000 --> 04:00.000]  So all of this and more are coming up today.
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  And hey, when the Biden administration does something positive,
[04:03.000 --> 04:07.000]  which is very rare, I'll be the first to talk about it.
[04:07.000 --> 04:14.000]  And in a major twist, EPA chief warns Ohio parents to not drink the
[04:14.000 --> 04:20.000]  water and to filter their water.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  Now that seems like common sense to do.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  Most major water supplies are contaminated with bisphenol A
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  and atrazine and stuff that will literally trouble your testicles
[04:28.000 --> 04:32.000]  up and turn you into a unit and give you cancer.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  But they'll never say that.
[04:34.000 --> 04:35.000]  Oh, no, the water's safe.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist, never filter the water.
[04:37.000 --> 04:39.000]  But more and more, they're like, hey, you should filter the water.
[04:39.000 --> 04:42.000]  Wow, something good and truthful from these people.
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  It is possible.
[04:45.000 --> 04:46.000]  Wow.
[04:46.000 --> 04:49.000]  Remember, David Hogg attacked me on C-SPAN for the conspiracy
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  theory that you should filter your water in most areas.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  At least check from the local water test.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  And almost everywhere, the water is poisonous.
[04:57.000 --> 04:58.000]  We'll be right back.
[04:58.000 --> 05:01.000]  Stay with us.
[05:01.000 --> 05:06.000]  Right now, I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners
[05:06.000 --> 05:09.000]  that have gone to mfolwarestore.com and gotten the great products
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body
[05:12.000 --> 05:13.000]  and keep us on air.
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.000]  I am humbly, hand in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  that have tuned in many of you for years and never gone to
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  mfolwarestore.com.
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  never actually go to mfolwarestore.com and never experience these
[05:28.000 --> 05:30.000]  great products and never find the operation.
[05:30.000 --> 05:31.000]  Sure, you share a link.
[05:31.000 --> 05:32.000]  You share an article.
[05:32.000 --> 05:33.000]  You tell folks about the show.
[05:33.000 --> 05:34.000]  That's great.
[05:34.000 --> 05:35.000]  And I thank you.
[05:35.000 --> 05:36.000]  But we need funds to operate.
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  for people like our CBD oil and our fizzy magnesium and our
[05:42.000 --> 05:45.000]  sweet bait and our nitric oxide and our real Red Pill Plus.
[05:45.000 --> 05:47.000]  All of these are really great products.
[05:47.000 --> 05:48.000]  They keep us on air.
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  Plus, you're missing out on these products.
[05:50.000 --> 05:51.000]  So get off the bench.
[05:51.000 --> 05:52.000]  Get in the game.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  Step to the plate and go to mfolwarestore.com right now
[05:55.000 --> 06:00.000]  and get these great mFullWars products at mfolwarestore.com.
[06:25.000 --> 06:35.000]  It's Monday, March 6, 2023.
[06:35.000 --> 06:37.000]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  Very honored and blessed to be here.
[06:39.000 --> 06:42.000]  I want to thank you all for tuning in and sharing the transmission
[06:42.000 --> 06:45.000]  that overrides the sensors and the tyrants.
[06:45.000 --> 06:46.000]  All right.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  A really great researcher and author and popular podcaster
[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  and I've been interviewing hard to believe for more than 10 years.
[06:51.000 --> 06:55.000]  Michael Malis, now a fellow Austinite, moved here from New York
[06:55.000 --> 06:56.000]  to escape the lockdowns.
[06:56.000 --> 07:01.000]  He's going to be in studio with us in the second and third hour.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  Paul Watson will also be visiting to talk about this first big story
[07:05.000 --> 07:07.000]  we're going to hit.
[07:07.000 --> 07:10.000]  Now, this broke on Friday on Intelligraf.
[07:10.000 --> 07:14.000]  Now, it's all over the world news and they've admitted that,
[07:14.000 --> 07:19.000]  yes, indeed, 100,000 of his private messages to himself
[07:19.000 --> 07:28.000]  and the rest of the government ministers from WhatsApp were hacked.
[07:28.000 --> 07:33.000]  And it is full of criminal activity.
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  It's him talking to the prime minister, him talking to the other agencies,
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.000]  him talking to their Ministry of Defense about how to scare the public
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  and use, quote, mind control on them.
[07:45.000 --> 07:47.000]  The media tried to focus mainly on him cheating on his wife
[07:47.000 --> 07:49.000]  for the text messages, but that hasn't worked.
[07:49.000 --> 07:52.000]  They talk about deploying a new variant to, quote,
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  scare the pants off of everyone.
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  And they say we should just go ahead and ban everything.
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  That sounds more legitimate than only banning a few things.
[08:03.000 --> 08:09.000]  It is a keyhole view into the seedy underworld of fear-mongering
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.000]  and mind control.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  And you notice the rhetoric coming out of his mouth is the exact same
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  the U.S. government, the German government, the Canadian government,
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  the Australian government, the Dutch government, the French government,
[08:20.000 --> 08:22.000]  the Italian government.
[08:22.000 --> 08:25.000]  It's the same garbage coming out of the Spanish government
[08:25.000 --> 08:30.000]  because it was a unified worldwide corporate U.N. assault.
[08:30.000 --> 08:33.000]  The U.K. lockdown files, text messages are real,
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.000]  how top British health officials conspired to, quote,
[08:35.000 --> 08:41.000]  scare the pants off of everyone and asking when do we deploy the new variant.
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  Now, we know they cooked up in a lab,
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  but I believe there they're talking about deploying the hype of a new variant.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  Project Fear offers discussion when to deploy the new COVID variant,
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  London Telegraph.
[08:53.000 --> 08:59.000]  And now suddenly there are prominent members of Congress and governors
[08:59.000 --> 09:03.000]  and foreign leaders and you name it,
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.000]  Bill Maher, Russell Brand, Joe Rogan coming out against the new world order,
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.000]  coming out against the globalists, coming out against the big corporations,
[09:13.000 --> 09:19.000]  coming out against Bill Gates and pointing the elephant in the room,
[09:19.000 --> 09:23.000]  but you can go back 20 years where Bill Gates got banned in India, his dad.
[09:23.000 --> 09:27.000]  You can go back a decade when Bill Gates got banned in Kenya and other African countries
[09:27.000 --> 09:32.000]  because they caught them adding sterilants to the vaccines,
[09:32.000 --> 09:34.000]  different ways they do it.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  But one thing is with a tetanus shot, they had a certain key female hormone
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  that's only produced at the beginning of the second trimester
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  and then it causes an autoimmune response
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  and the body attacks the baby at the second trimester and kills it.
[09:47.000 --> 09:51.000]  Bill Gates got caught doing that really 15, 16 years ago.
[09:51.000 --> 09:55.000]  You can look up U.N. caught adding sterilants to vaccines in Kenya
[09:55.000 --> 09:57.000]  and Bill Gates was behind it.
[09:57.000 --> 10:03.000]  Just like he was behind six years ago getting caught in Africa and in Central Asia,
[10:03.000 --> 10:11.000]  places like Pakistan, giving children live polio on purpose causing polio outbreaks.
[10:11.000 --> 10:13.000]  You ask, how does he do it?
[10:13.000 --> 10:14.000]  Well, that's the question.
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  He's practicing through the media that he spends billions of dollars of tax money.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  He really gets all this grant money and puts his own money in tax exempt
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.000]  and then pays himself back profits from the vaccines we all are basically forced to take
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  or much of us are forced to take.
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  And he goes around then testing to see how many people he can kill.
[10:35.000 --> 10:42.000]  Well, he got away with the tetanus shots that were Trojan horses for infertility
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  and automatic miscarriages.
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.000]  And he got away with spreading polio around the world in the vaccines.
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.000]  And so now he's going to get away, he thinks, with the COVID shots
[10:55.000 --> 11:00.000]  and notice the amount of death is going up and up and up and up and up and up and up each time.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  So Joe Rogan last week had Russell Brand in studio
[11:04.000 --> 11:08.000]  and they brought up the fact that I was on Joe's show a few years ago
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  and said, you know, Bill Gates got caught adding polio to the vaccines.
[11:12.000 --> 11:15.000]  He got banned in a bunch of countries and Joe went, hold on just a second.
[11:15.000 --> 11:16.000]  Let's search that.
[11:16.000 --> 11:17.000]  And Joe never seen that.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  There it was in AP and Reuters.
[11:19.000 --> 11:21.000]  And he went, oh my God, it's true.
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  And he did a bunch of research on it.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  But the reason I mentioned that is because it's a window into the mindset of these people.
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  It's all a test with successful approximation to increase the level of the attack
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  and to be able to get away with it.
[11:35.000 --> 11:38.000]  That's why it's so critical to finally nail them for this.
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  And we have in the court a public opinion.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  The coverage of them being behind the COVID bug and behind the poison shots
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.000]  is a million times, literally, bigger than the attention they got for Kenya
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  and bigger for the attention that they got around the world
[11:58.000 --> 12:02.000]  with the tainted Trojan horse polio injections.
[12:02.000 --> 12:03.000]  So they're not happy.
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.000]  This didn't go well because of independent media.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  That's why they're trying to pass laws and have in Europe.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  They're trying to pass them here.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  We've got news on that.
[12:12.000 --> 12:20.000]  We'll be getting to, to literally shut down and arrest anyone that questions
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  any of the poison injections they roll out.
[12:22.000 --> 12:26.000]  Even though everything they said about the poison injections was a lie,
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  everything we said was true.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  But this lie, this eugenics operation, this depopulation operation cannot thrive,
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  cannot survive, cannot operate if we are here exposing them.
[12:41.000 --> 12:43.000]  So we have nothing to lose.
[12:43.000 --> 12:45.000]  All we can do is fight.
[12:45.000 --> 12:46.000]  When we fight back, things get better.
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  When we roll over, things get successively worse.
[12:49.000 --> 12:54.000]  So I saw this headline and I knew instantly what the story was about.
[12:54.000 --> 12:55.000]  I went and read it in detail.
[12:55.000 --> 12:58.000]  And sure enough, it's a great article from newspunch.com.
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.000]  And it goes over the history of the Gates Foundation caught with abortion drugs
[13:02.000 --> 13:06.000]  that he populate and even members of his own team later admitting it.
[13:06.000 --> 13:13.000]  It's a nice boil down of what happened in the mid-90s through the mid-2000s all over Africa.
[13:13.000 --> 13:18.000]  Gates Foundation insider admits coming to vaccines are abortion drugs to depopulate the world.
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  And you read the article and it's full of links and quotes to where it actually happened
[13:23.000 --> 13:29.000]  and how the WHO even had to admit that, okay, we sterilized millions of people in Africa with these shots.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  And again, you can try to argue that, well, we should sterilize people.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  Do you want to be sterilized?
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  Do you want this guy to have the power over you to do that?
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  Because it's wink, wink.
[13:39.000 --> 13:40.000]  Hey, let's kill the Africans.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  Well, what about you?
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  See, don't pretend like the new world order isn't coming after you.
[13:45.000 --> 13:48.000]  You can be a billionaire, they're coming after you.
[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  Let's play the Club of Russell Brand on Joe Rogan.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  Bill Gates ain't Willy Wonka.
[13:53.000 --> 13:55.000]  He ain't doing this for like a competition.
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  There's no golden ticket at the end of this.
[13:57.000 --> 14:00.000]  It's like, yeah, not-for-profit organizations making profit,
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  an incredible amount of influencing areas that he profits from.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  All sorts of peculiar business practices like in India and on the continent of Africa
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  that have led to like palpable suffering and profit in his case.
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.000]  The Africa thing is wild, and that's a big part of the real Anthony Fauci book.
[14:18.000 --> 14:21.000]  He talks about Bill Gates quite a bit, and one of the things he talks about
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.000]  is how they've always used Africa as a place where they test out medicines.
[14:26.000 --> 14:29.000]  They've used Africa as a place where they test out medicines.
[14:29.000 --> 14:31.000]  This is another thing that I learned from Alex Jones.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.000]  Alex Jones was saying that they were giving kids the polio vaccine in Africa
[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  and that Bill Gates was involved in this, and they had to stop doing it
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  because it was actually giving kids polio.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  And I was like, what?
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  And they pull up an AP article.
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.000]  There was an AP story about this, and it shows this terrified little African baby
[14:49.000 --> 14:53.000]  and they're dropping the polio vaccine in his mouth, like squeezing his face,
[14:53.000 --> 14:54.000]  dropping his mouth.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  I'm like, what the fuck, man?
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  They gave kids polio with a vaccine?
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  Even when you accept everything that they say at this late point
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  when it appears impossible to do that, they wouldn't release patents
[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  so that African nations could recreate the vaccines over there.
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  So clearly there's a profit motive, and I saw him publicly talk about that
[15:14.000 --> 15:15.000]  and say, oh, no, it's not simple.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  It can't just give people the patents and stuff.
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  But it seems like if you recognize that what drives them always is power,
[15:21.000 --> 15:25.000]  finance, and dominion, if you always look at that and then track their actions,
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  you hardly ever see a disruption in that pattern.
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  And if you try to think about all the evil things in 45 years,
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  Fauci's quarterback, he's part of a big eugenics society and works for Bill Gates,
[15:37.000 --> 15:38.000]  it'll make your head spin.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  Remember in the 80s and 90s, thousands of foster children taken in New York alone
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  and who are healthy and given age drugs till they die.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  That's Fauci again.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  Or taking German shepherds and beagles and paralyzing them,
[15:51.000 --> 15:53.000]  letting flesh-sheeting bugs eat their faces off.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.000]  That's Fauci.
[15:54.000 --> 15:56.000]  If it's evil, he's doing it.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  He's Joseph Mengele 2.0.
[15:58.000 --> 16:00.000]  We'll be right back.
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World,
[16:03.000 --> 16:06.000]  is a historic book that documents the globals in their own words
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  planned for our future, that is the hellish future.
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  Now, you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess, they're starting to ban them,
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in The War for the World
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.000]  at bookstores, Amazon, or infowarshore.com.
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[16:22.000 --> 16:25.000]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[16:25.000 --> 16:27.000]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  So get your copy of The Great Reset in The War for the World,
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.000]  a signed copy at infowarshore.com.
[16:33.000 --> 16:37.000]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.000]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  you'll also know that you help keep infowars on the air.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.000]  I'm going to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarshore.com
[16:51.000 --> 16:54.000]  and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[16:54.000 --> 16:57.000]  and donate it to the library or give it to the local school.
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.000]  This is an info war. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.000]  I've got some good news. Our high quality supplements really work
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.000]  and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  That's the good news. They're amazing.
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  The bad news is around 1% or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners
[17:15.000 --> 17:19.000]  ever go to infowarshore.com and ever actually buy the products.
[17:19.000 --> 17:22.000]  So you're missing out on these products plus it funds the info war.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying products.
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  Think of what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to infowarshore.com
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  and got some of these amazing products.
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  I would recommend Tomb Raek 95 for your joints, your bones, inflammation
[17:39.000 --> 17:42.000]  to get one of the biggest effects so you reorder and see how great it is.
[17:42.000 --> 17:47.000]  Also, we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil
[17:47.000 --> 17:51.000]  that's so good for your neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well.
[17:51.000 --> 17:55.000]  Or Real Red Pill Plus. Just go try the product, fund the info war
[17:55.000 --> 17:57.000]  and help us defeat the new order together.
[17:57.000 --> 18:26.000]  infowarstore.com
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book The Great Reset and War for the World.
[18:29.000 --> 18:35.000]  Ultimate bone broth, back at stock, nitric boost, the amazing CBD oil we have
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.000]  that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[18:39.000 --> 18:43.000]  It's all available at infowarstore.com, some of the very best products.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  And a lot of you have never shopped at infowarstore.
[18:45.000 --> 18:47.000]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years,
[18:47.000 --> 18:50.000]  but you've never taken the step to go to infowarstore.
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.000]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[18:53.000 --> 18:55.000]  Plus they keep us on air.
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.000]  So again, please take action, go to infowarstore.com today and I thank you.
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  info wars, tomorrow's news today.
[19:04.000 --> 19:06.000]  This is their big move.
[19:06.000 --> 19:10.000]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[19:10.000 --> 19:13.000]  He doesn't care. That's not his job.
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  He's not the president of the United States.
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.000]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.000]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  They must be opposed.
[19:25.000 --> 19:28.000]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  No, no, no.
[19:31.000 --> 19:32.000]  Exactly.
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.000]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.000]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[19:38.000 --> 19:41.000]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[19:41.000 --> 19:43.000]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[19:49.000 --> 19:50.000]  You're right.
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  And we say no.
[19:55.000 --> 20:21.000]  And we say no to your war.
[20:25.000 --> 20:40.000]  All right, we're talking about something really important.
[20:40.000 --> 20:43.000]  And that's your right to listen to what you want to listen to,
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.000]  to watch what you want to watch, to read what you want to watch.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  That's what all the surveillance and censorship is about,
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  is controlling your mind and your ability to make good decisions.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  So in Europe, in the UK, they've passed laws.
[20:56.000 --> 20:59.000]  Australia has done it as well to criminalize free speech,
[20:59.000 --> 21:02.000]  criminalize speaking out against open borders,
[21:02.000 --> 21:05.000]  election fraud, forced injections.
[21:05.000 --> 21:08.000]  And notice our Justice Department came out two years ago,
[21:08.000 --> 21:10.000]  run by Biden and said the same thing.
[21:10.000 --> 21:12.000]  White supremacy, the number one threat,
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  that then defined in that June report a year and a half ago, two years ago,
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  that it's anybody questioning open borders,
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  all in elections, lockdowns are forced shots.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  You are a white supremacist.
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.000]  And then by that definition, with hate crime laws,
[21:28.000 --> 21:31.000]  then you get higher penalties for things that would be misdemeanors.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  I'll explain that in a moment.
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  But it's a formulated plan all over the Western world,
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  run by the same people.
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.000]  So, here's an article on the Gateway Pundit.
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  You can go read a copy of the legislation.
[21:44.000 --> 21:45.000]  It's linked to it.
[21:45.000 --> 21:48.000]  State Attorney General Pushing Ministry of Truth,
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  targets conservatives opposing election fraud
[21:51.000 --> 21:55.000]  and vaccine mandates could become crimes.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  is pushing the state legislature to adopt legislation
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  that would set up a commission on domestic terrorism.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  See, it's terror.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  That mirrors Biden's policy according to a report
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  that can lead to a conservative individual being criminally charged
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  for expressing their views.
[22:13.000 --> 22:16.000]  And it goes on.
[22:16.000 --> 22:19.000]  A-T-T-H-T-V reporting on it.
[22:19.000 --> 22:24.000]  H-B-1-3-3-3 sets up a domestic violent extremist commission,
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  and then they will decide the commission what is a crime,
[22:26.000 --> 22:28.000]  not the legislature.
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  Absolutely insane. H-B-1-3-3-3.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  Now, you're thinking, well, that's the crazies in Washington.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  We saw Greg Abbott a year and a half ago come out
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  and say, I'm pro-free speech.
[22:43.000 --> 22:47.000]  But if it's anti-semitic, we want you banned.
[22:47.000 --> 22:50.000]  Anti-semitic.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  You can have the left running around everywhere at the universities on TV
[22:53.000 --> 22:55.000]  saying Christians are evil, whites are evil,
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  America's evil.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  Oh, but if people want to say Jews are bad, you're not allowed to.
[23:00.000 --> 23:03.000]  You should be able to say any groups of bad you want.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  That's your first amendment.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  Doesn't mean I support what somebody's saying.
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  Doesn't mean you support it.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  And again, it always starts with, don't say the n-word,
[23:11.000 --> 23:14.000]  black Jews, and then next it's, don't criticize open borders
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.000]  or election fraud or forced injections,
[23:16.000 --> 23:18.000]  which they're now doing.
[23:18.000 --> 23:22.000]  Florida GOP declares war on the First Amendment,
[23:22.000 --> 23:26.000]  infowars.com, to combat anti-semitism.
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  The Free State of Florida is said to have the most oppressive
[23:29.000 --> 23:33.000]  hate crime laws in America in order to combat anti-semitism.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  And anything else they say is hate.
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  Based to sin, it's just got your First Amendment rights,
[23:38.000 --> 23:41.000]  revoked anti-semitism hate speech laws about to be passed
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  in Florida, throwing pennies at the synagogue,
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  is now five years in jail.
[23:46.000 --> 23:49.000]  There is no First Amendment right to conduct
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  Jewish Florida State Representative Randy Fine
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  told the media earlier this week.
[23:54.000 --> 23:57.000]  We're gonna play a clip of what he has to say, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:57.000 --> 24:00.000]  But notice, he says, graffiti is illegal,
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  but it's a misdemeanor.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  But if we say it's hateful, five years in jail.
[24:04.000 --> 24:06.000]  So that's speech.
[24:06.000 --> 24:09.000]  You can say graffiti is illegal because it's somebody else's property.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  That's a property violation.
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  But they're building an unconstitutional bridge,
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  then saying, well, we're not gonna just give you a $500 fine.
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.000]  Your second offense, you know, two weeks in jail.
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  No.
[24:22.000 --> 24:25.000]  We're gonna say what you said is hateful,
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  and by the ADL definition, and the definitions the feds are creating
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  and Washington's creating and the other states are creating,
[24:31.000 --> 24:34.000]  criticizing open borders, election fraud, lockdowns,
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  forced injections, whatever else they want.
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  A bill was introduced a month ago by the Democrats in Congress
[24:39.000 --> 24:43.000]  that if you criticize the minority in any way, five years in jail.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  They're introducing these bills.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  They're trying to do this.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  You saw the deputy head of the EU commission
[24:50.000 --> 24:53.000]  three weeks ago at the World Government Summit
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  look to members of the Republican delegation,
[24:55.000 --> 24:58.000]  Democrat delegation that were there, members of Congress and said,
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  we've already banned free speech and hate speech.
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  We know you're about to ban it as well,
[25:02.000 --> 25:05.000]  and the Republican-Democrat-Congress people nodded their heads.
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.000]  It's here. It's not coming, it's here.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  And it's beyond the canary in the coal mine.
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  So here he is explaining this.
[25:12.000 --> 25:15.000]  They'll take a misdemeanor, that's a misdemeanor,
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  has nothing to do with a quote, hate,
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  but because the thought behind it was bad, five years in jail.
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  Here it is.
[25:21.000 --> 25:25.000]  Holding people accountable without, you know, violating their free speech.
[25:25.000 --> 25:26.000]  Sure.
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  And again, I would remind you that there is no,
[25:28.000 --> 25:31.000]  there's no First Amendment right to conduct.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  There's a First Amendment right to speech.
[25:33.000 --> 25:36.000]  And the things that we're targeting in the bill are not speech.
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  Again, if someone wants to stand across the street from my house
[25:38.000 --> 25:41.000]  and wave a sign on the sidewalk, they have every right to do that.
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  And this bill won't have anything to do with that.
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  But when it veers into conduct, and so the way we're going to approach this
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  is through a hate crime kicker.
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  So if you project, if you graffiti a building, it is a crime now.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  But if your motivation is hate, it will be a third-degree felony.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  You'll spend five years in prison.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  If you want to litter, it's a crime right now.
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.000]  But if you litter, and if your motivation is a hate crime,
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  it will be a third-degree felony.
[26:05.000 --> 26:06.000]  You will spend five years in jail.
[26:06.000 --> 26:09.000]  Is a crime right now to hang banners from an interstate?
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  For obvious reasons, we don't want to distract drivers.
[26:12.000 --> 26:15.000]  But if you do that, and you have a hate crime, a hate motivation,
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  it will be a third-degree felony.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  You will spend five years in jail.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  How often is the argument of moving this bill off?
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  I guarantee the bill will pass.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  And I never do that.
[26:25.000 --> 26:32.000]  Well, DeSantis better veto that, or I'm going to totally not support
[26:32.000 --> 26:37.000]  Ron DeSantis, that that will be just a nail in the coffin too far
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  if that's the case.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  But taking crimes that aren't felonies, that aren't associated with violence,
[26:44.000 --> 26:47.000]  and then saying we're going to make it a hate crime five years in jail
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  if you litter.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  So I'm protesting outside the ADL because they're anti-free speech.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  We really should do that.
[26:54.000 --> 26:58.000]  I'm a authoritarian, and I leave, I forget and leave,
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  say a cup of iced tea and a styrofoam cup on the steps of it
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  or a handkerchief falls out of the back of my pocket.
[27:05.000 --> 27:09.000]  Oh, you littered in front of the ADL five years in prison.
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  This is the plan to get our free speech.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  And they've already done it in Europe.
[27:15.000 --> 27:19.000]  You've seen all the arrest videos of where a veteran posts the trans flag
[27:19.000 --> 27:22.000]  as a swastika because if you put it together, four of them, it makes a swastika.
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.360]  Swastika. They arrested him last time I heard he's still in jail. Came to his house, took him to jail.
[27:29.520 --> 27:34.560]  This is the plan. This is what's going on. And they specifically don't want you talking about
[27:34.560 --> 27:40.240]  the poison shots or the open borders or any of it. That's all defined by the Justice Department
[27:40.240 --> 27:47.200]  as white supremacists. And then by extension, everything else is racist. But violent criminals,
[27:47.200 --> 27:52.880]  I saw another article today on Washington State where a mass shooter who was black got out while
[27:52.880 --> 27:58.880]  he's going to face trial. Was only in jail a few weeks, shot a whole bunch of people. But that's
[27:58.880 --> 28:05.920]  okay. You're black. We're going to let you out of jail. But if you say something mean to the ADL
[28:05.920 --> 28:11.440]  or the Black Lives Matter or the NAACP, they're completely un-American foaming at the mouth,
[28:11.440 --> 28:18.480]  weaponized groups coming after all of our freedoms, well, then you're in deep trouble. So if America
[28:18.480 --> 28:24.000]  bows down to this, as people do, remember during the Black Lives Matter, thousands of white people
[28:24.000 --> 28:29.120]  at events, bowing and worshiping black people, shining their boots, kissing their ass, while the
[28:29.120 --> 28:35.120]  black people spew anti-white racist rhetoric, this is just a sign of them submitting to their
[28:35.120 --> 28:39.920]  collective guilt and Stockholm syndrome. And they'll follow whatever agenda comes out of Black
[28:39.920 --> 28:43.920]  Lives Matter. They could care less about black people. In fact, it says their number one goal
[28:43.920 --> 28:49.120]  is ending the nuclear family for black people. Boy, with friends like that, who needs enemies?
[28:49.840 --> 28:53.600]  All right, we're going to come back with a lot of other news on the poison shot front that I'm
[28:53.600 --> 28:57.600]  going to shift gears and all the other news jam packed broadcast today and a special guest in

[32:56.160 --> 33:06.800]  now. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's Alex Jones.
[33:06.800 --> 33:27.040]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from Austin Texas you're
[33:27.040 --> 33:34.880]  listening to the Alex Jones show. Okay I want to finish up with the really important poison shot news
[33:34.880 --> 33:38.800]  and how close we are to bringing the criminals to justice now we've already convicted them in
[33:38.800 --> 33:42.640]  the court of public opinion which will make it much harder for them to launch another attack or
[33:42.640 --> 33:48.240]  lockdown. We've already got them on the ropes we got to go all the way you know I don't hype
[33:48.240 --> 33:52.240]  something up as positive it isn't positive I don't tell you I think we're winning if we're not winning
[33:52.800 --> 33:56.400]  now we're not completely winning we're not dominating but we're starting to the great
[33:56.400 --> 34:02.000]  awakenings here and you are at the heart of the resistance never forget that. Now before I go any
[34:02.000 --> 34:09.120]  further I want to show you a headline that just came out a couple days ago right wing culture
[34:09.120 --> 34:14.560]  has Alex Jones style craziness to energize it what does the left have one in Guardian article
[34:15.760 --> 34:20.800]  they basically admit that Alex Jones in what they tracked from Europe to Australia to the United
[34:20.800 --> 34:26.960]  States creates the culture and the talking points against the new world order and they have right
[34:26.960 --> 34:32.960] fully tracked it back this broadcast and our guests and what we do of analyzing the enemy and
[34:32.960 --> 34:37.200]  giving people accurate information about what they're doing and I don't just do it on my show I do
[34:37.200 --> 34:40.720]  it behind the scenes with other prominent people and I'm not up here bragging I'm giving you a
[34:40.720 --> 34:45.440]  report card on how hard I'm working for all of us including my family and yours because we're all
[34:45.440 --> 34:51.120]  in this boat together people ask me all the time why do you work so hard why are you tireless why
[34:51.120 --> 34:56.080]  are you near fearless why do you do what you do well how can you take the attacks because I have
[34:56.080 --> 35:04.400]  children the new world order is completely evil so why would you not oppose it giving into it is
[35:04.400 --> 35:12.000]  sure destruction so that said ladies and gentlemen let me give you a little report on the state of
[35:12.000 --> 35:17.920]  info wars just last week they got the big bankruptcy filing for free speech systems complete
[35:17.920 --> 35:25.360]  into the federal court and it's about what I had thought it was we lost a million dollars last year
[35:26.080 --> 35:32.000]  sounds like a lot but for an operation this big that's not that big a shortfall it takes about 30
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.720]  million dollars a year to run this operation with bandwidth and crew and legal and all the things
[35:36.720 --> 35:45.120]  we've got to do and subscribing you know to major outfits you know for the photos we use like Getty
[35:45.120 --> 35:51.840]  all of it it costs about 30 million dollars to to crack that nut and that's with us with our
[35:51.840 --> 35:56.000]  feelers and things kind of pulled in and not sitting reporters all over and not being able to
[35:56.000 --> 36:01.200]  operate like we did five six years ago but still having a mass fact and the numbers are out there
[36:01.200 --> 36:05.840]  now they try to twist them oh Alex Jones is $100,000 a month yeah the court has allowed that because
[36:05.840 --> 36:11.040]  that's what my legal bills are so I don't do this for money if I wanted to do it for money I would
[36:11.040 --> 36:16.960]  have taken the deal at Fox News I'm going to take them a deal with Premier Radio Networks and Clear
[36:16.960 --> 36:22.560]  Channel and things like that many many years ago they wanted me to be the next Rush Limbaugh I
[36:22.560 --> 36:28.320]  decided not to do it now I do this because I want to change the future for the better so here's the
[36:28.320 --> 36:37.600]  bottom line we'll be able to go through this chapter 11 sub chapter 5 reorganization if we can
[36:37.600 --> 36:45.360]  we can be profitable and we're barely in the black this year but because we were in the red last year
[36:45.360 --> 36:51.040]  we're still in the black so it's a very simple equation I'm not telling you what to do I'm asking
[36:51.040 --> 36:57.040]  you in a decision you have to listen to and make do you want info wars and this crew and this
[36:57.040 --> 37:02.720]  historic operation and our archives and all the great work we do our best work ever is happening
[37:02.720 --> 37:09.120]  now to stay on the air or do you want this shut down I'll still be on the air but it will be
[37:09.120 --> 37:15.280]  diminishing ways and not as effective for a while do you want that to happen now it's a very easy
[37:15.280 --> 37:19.760]  question because we've got really amazing products that really do empower your life and really are
[37:19.760 --> 37:24.960]  the highest quality so if you'll just do what less than one percent of listeners have done and
[37:24.960 --> 37:29.600]  actually go to info wars store.com and actually get some great products that will enrich you and
[37:29.600 --> 37:37.120]  your family's life then please take action in fact I know it came in weeks ago but I was never

[45:47.600 --> 45:52.400]  addicted to telling the truth and helping the american people and i really do credit alex for
[45:52.400 --> 46:02.000]  you know really instilling that within the early on in my career i've got some good news our high

[47:41.200 --> 47:46.480]  welcome is the best-selling author great researcher great historian and good friend of mine he's gonna
[47:46.480 --> 47:51.440]  be in studio with us for the next two hours coming up second third hour paul octson with the huge
[47:51.440 --> 47:55.680]  british news and already mentioned is going to be popping in with their health minister caught
[47:56.640 --> 48:02.160]  saying we'll release a new variant to scare the public into submission and so much more he's
[48:02.160 --> 48:06.160]  going to be popping in during that interview to talk about that and all the big coven news i haven't
[48:06.160 --> 48:10.880]  gotten to yet but before i hit some of this other news ahead of michael malis coming in here in about
[48:11.520 --> 48:15.760]  12 minutes or so in the next hour just to finish up what i was saying last segment
[48:15.760 --> 48:22.800]  this is an information war you want folks to fight the globalist you want people to take on
[48:22.800 --> 48:27.920]  the tyrants we're doing it and we're having hands down the biggest effect in this fight and we're
[48:27.920 --> 48:34.960]  being mimicked we're being parroted we're being supported by so many other great prominent people
[48:34.960 --> 48:40.480]  that are looking into our research and finding out it's true and info wars is having its greatest
[48:40.480 --> 48:46.800]  victories ever in hearts and minds around the country and the world i was just flying around
[48:46.800 --> 48:52.400]  commercial in the united states got nothing but love last week nothing but love wherever i go
[48:52.960 --> 48:58.560]  compared to quite a bit of hate previously that's a report to you that we're winning the information
[48:58.560 --> 49:04.320]  war and the great awakening is here but you've got to make the decision on whether or not you
[49:04.320 --> 49:08.880]  want these people to win and there's nowhere that you could support by spreading the word
[49:08.880 --> 49:14.720]  by praying for the broadcast by buying products like info wars and info warshow.com and those that
[49:14.720 --> 49:20.240]  have been doing it know who you are and you are the reason we've had such success without you
[49:20.240 --> 49:24.320]  none of these good things will be happening the enemy recognizes that we're the tip of the spear
[49:24.320 --> 49:28.720]  that means you're the tip of the spear in the information war for hearts and minds so i salute
[49:28.720 --> 49:34.400]  those that have supported us and i just asked those that haven't why aren't you spreading the word
[49:34.400 --> 49:39.280]  why aren't you buying the products why aren't you actively doing that i'm just asking you a question
[49:39.280 --> 49:46.560]  because we need you you need us we're in this together so i'm simply asking all of you out there
[49:46.560 --> 49:50.240]  to think about what info wars has contributed think about how we've been the main target of the
[49:50.240 --> 49:55.840]  enemy because we're so effective until the truth and then to make the decision to financially
[49:55.840 --> 50:00.160]  support the broadcast by getting great products at the same time it's a decision that you've got to
[50:00.160 --> 50:06.160]  make and i'm asking you to make that decision i'm not complaining to the people that have been
[50:06.160 --> 50:10.240]  supporters over the years or if you don't have the finances i really feel bad for you that you
[50:10.240 --> 50:14.400]  can't get these great supplements and i wish they cost less but i'm only going to sell the highest
[50:14.400 --> 50:21.520]  quality but for those that have been on the fence it's time to get off the fence right now the enemy
[50:21.520 --> 50:26.960]  wouldn't want this show shut down if it wasn't so effective so go to info warshow.com get the highest
[50:26.960 --> 50:33.440]  quality CBD oil your bones your joints your brain your neurological systems get our great bone broth
[50:33.440 --> 50:40.480]  get our great prebiotic get it all vitamin d3 you name it at infowarstore.com or triple eight
[50:40.480 --> 50:45.600]  two five three three one three nine all right just wanted to explain that make that extremely clear
[50:45.600 --> 50:50.960]  about how important that decision is that you have to make for yourself you're in the driver's seat
[50:50.960 --> 50:57.120]  you have to make the decision all right let me tell you what we're going to be covering
[50:59.280 --> 51:03.280]  here today and we'll be covering the waterfront but we're going to be discussing
[51:04.400 --> 51:09.440]  what it means to be white pill versus what it means to be red pill or blue pill and i think we
[51:09.440 --> 51:15.600]  should describe it and and and and create a new pill today here on air called infinity pill because
[51:15.600 --> 51:20.560]  i really think looking into infinity and realizing how timeless and incredible and how amazing things
[51:20.560 --> 51:25.280]  are is really the way to break free from the globalist control and realize they're finite
[51:25.280 --> 51:32.320]  but the human experience is eternal and is infinite we're also going to look at 5g and the fact that
[51:32.320 --> 51:36.960]  major study for major study it's linked directly to cancer and people don't understand that i have
[51:36.960 --> 51:41.440]  some video demonstrations that are going to lay that out we're also going to look at the war in
[51:41.440 --> 51:46.240]  ukraine that's escalated out of control and can it be stopped for at least the thermal nuclear war
[51:46.240 --> 51:51.440]  the end conclusion of this world war three path that we're already deeply into world war three
[51:51.440 --> 51:59.120]  has already begun the question is will it go nuclear then we'll also continue to look at the
[51:59.120 --> 52:05.920]  entire attack on our youth and where that whole movement is going and how we can stop it but
[52:05.920 --> 52:12.480]  also some good news i mentioned earlier a new twist epa chief warns ohio parents don't drink the water
[52:12.480 --> 52:18.160]  and that seems simple doesn't it but normally on 9 11 they say the air is safe to breathe
[52:18.160 --> 52:22.800]  the water is safe to drink so much of the u.s water supply is contaminated with hundreds
[52:22.800 --> 52:29.840]  some cases thousands of chemicals like atrazine uh dioxins bisphenol a the list goes on and on
[52:30.560 --> 52:36.320]  but to have the epa chief say you should do that well we don't need the government to
[52:36.320 --> 52:40.400]  tell us to do that but so many people wait till the government like it's the ultimate authority
[52:40.400 --> 52:45.360]  tells them but to have the bite administration actually do something real and say it's in your
[52:45.360 --> 52:51.280]  hands protect yourself is good as they always tell you democrat republic administrations the water
[52:51.280 --> 52:56.560]  is clean the water is good we'll just ask the folks in flint michigan if that's the case they know
[52:56.560 --> 53:04.880]  it's not so i'm a big detractor from the biden puppet administration but i will give credit when
[53:04.880 --> 53:10.960]  credits do and so this is a good first move maybe it becomes contagious tell the truth epa chief
[53:10.960 --> 53:16.320]  warns ohio parents i would not let my children play in the east palestine creeks or streams
[53:16.320 --> 53:22.480]  and they went on to say after he was seen drinking the tap water they went on to say you should
[53:22.480 --> 53:27.600]  filter the tap water epa chief michael reagan warned ohio parents to keep their children
[53:27.600 --> 53:32.560]  out of locals creeks or streams along a toxic chemical mushroom cloud explosion in early
[53:32.560 --> 53:39.280]  february and he himself didn't say filter but the epa under his direction is saying you should
[53:39.280 --> 53:43.920]  filter it reagan made the east palestine wednesday he was asked if he would let his kids play in
[53:43.920 --> 53:49.760]  the streams and he said no so we need to hear people in government tell the truth but the
[53:49.760 --> 53:53.760]  it's the same government that just told us these poison shots were safe and and they weren't a big
[53:53.760 --> 53:59.120]  tech sensor anybody that tried to warn them and the same thing goes for 5g and all the rest of it
[53:59.120 --> 54:03.280]  you can't wait for the government bought and paid for by these out of control
[54:03.840 --> 54:07.680]  fortune 100 companies to tell you something you've got to do your own research
[54:07.680 --> 54:13.200]  and make that decision for yourself here's another example of what i was just talking about
[54:13.920 --> 54:19.360]  the side of fox news by administration makes stunning admission on climate agenda in leaked
[54:19.360 --> 54:25.280]  internal memo the by administration acknowledging a memo accidentally leaked on friday that
[54:25.280 --> 54:30.480]  said charging fossil fuel companies less to drill would provide greater energy security
[54:30.480 --> 54:35.120]  for the american people despite its plan to hike royalties they go on to say though despite that
[54:35.120 --> 54:40.080]  they want to get us off fossil fuels so they're going to hike the rates and continue to block
[54:40.080 --> 54:47.360]  pipelines and new permits to drill when they haven't created an alternative there's not enough cobalt
[54:48.080 --> 54:54.640]  or lithium in the world to convert to battery driven cars so what they're really doing is
[54:54.640 --> 54:59.440]  destroying the infrastructure and ensuring that our economy breaks down and our economy is based
[54:59.440 --> 55:05.680]  on cars because of urban sprawl we will totally collapse without it something elon must explain
[55:05.680 --> 55:10.000]  over and over again and there's all these actuaries and prayer universities done great breakdowns of
[55:10.000 --> 55:16.320]  it but if you don't have 2.1 children on average for every family there's no replacement rate and
[55:16.320 --> 55:22.880]  civilization collapses i'm all for planning off population naturally with wealth and success
[55:22.880 --> 55:27.840]  in middle class and people if they choose to have five kids or two kids or one kid or no kid
[55:27.840 --> 55:33.200]  but to have policies designed to stop people having children like japan's down to 1.1 idli's
[55:33.200 --> 55:39.360]  at 1.2 france is at 1.3 england's at 1.4 indigenous u.s populations white black
[55:39.360 --> 55:47.200]  hispanic we're about 1.5 we're not replacing ourselves ladies and gentlemen and instead
[55:47.200 --> 55:52.480]  they're bringing in collapsed third world permanent underclasses who have no history of freedom so
[55:52.480 --> 55:57.280]  they will accept the new authoritarian system because the globalist corporate fascists don't
[55:57.280 --> 56:02.400]  want people to aspire to the greatest form of liberty the world ever saw the united states of
[56:02.400 --> 56:07.520]  america which doesn't mean it was much liberty but compared in a metric to all other systems
[56:07.520 --> 56:13.360]  it was fantastically free the global corporate fascist centralized tyrants don't want you to
[56:13.360 --> 56:20.080]  aspire to wealth and success that's why they want to dynamite and destroy any upward bridge any
[56:20.080 --> 56:26.640]  ladder up and that's why they're so incredibly criminal while the globalists invested china
[56:26.640 --> 56:31.760]  and they build new coal power plants every week that are totally dirty are totally clean coal
[56:31.760 --> 56:40.800]  power plants only produce carbon dioxide that plants breathe we are completely shutting down
[56:40.800 --> 56:46.480]  while they are building mexico opens new coal power plant every month china every week india
[56:46.480 --> 56:51.920]  every two three weeks as we shut down more plants every single week and our energy prices are more
[56:51.920 --> 56:57.280]  than double the last two years it's all by design to make you poor so they can control you look at
[56:57.280 --> 57:03.520]  the blue cities look what they are living like look at what they produce and that is the same
[57:03.520 --> 57:09.440]  feudalistic corporate manager system to make you poor so they can dictate the terms of our
[57:09.440 --> 57:15.840]  surrender feudalism is not a new system it's the oldest form of government practiced by every human

[59:46.800 --> 59:57.200]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:11.440]  we americans are under attack by our own government we the people have no choice but to once again
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:17.920]  defend our freedom this has all happened before and we can learn much from the american revolution
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:26.000]  starting in 1763 to pay for debts incurred from a war with france the british began enforcing new
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.320]  taxes on the american colonies in response to this the colonies set up their own parallel
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:38.480]  government based on a simple structure of three committees delegated to voice the will of the
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:45.440]  people a committee of correspondence to disseminate information a committee of inspection to enforce
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:51.360]  continental congress decisions and the most important of the three a committee of safety
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:58.320]  to act as general executive in the absence of legal authority these committees stemmed from
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:04.880]  each community of all the colonies and each and every local committee of safety had two missions
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:12.320]  to provide military support and monitor political affairs each community delegated its own
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:18.960]  representatives to speak on their behalf at the county level and then at the state level where
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:26.080]  state legislatures are thereby formed and senators are elected to represent the overall interests
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:33.360]  of the people in that state with these committees the 13 colonies honorably created a parallel
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:40.080]  government that lawfully nullified british rule this compelled the crown to take it back by force
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:46.480]  which was met by an honorable and lawful defense of the colonies known as the american revolution
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:53.360]  the three committee structure that made up this parallel government inspired our us constitution
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:59.680]  a concept of government based upon delegation individuals were not elected to rule their
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:06.160]  only purpose was to facilitate and implement the will of the people it was a government of the people
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:12.800]  by the people and for the people each state was considered to be its own country which was freely
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:19.360]  subordinating aspects of its own authority to a federal government lawfully speaking this has
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:25.680]  never changed but the federal government of the united states has become bloated with loyalists
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:32.400]  to the city of london and enemies of we the people for well over a century we the people
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:38.800]  have been coerced into becoming voluntary slaves to a multinational corporate power structure
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:45.200]  which has increasingly dumbed us down more and more with each generation unconstitutional
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:51.280]  amendments have been enacted constitutional limits of representation have been ignored
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:57.360]  and by accepting federal reserve bank notes we have made ourselves a dishonorable nation of debtors
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:06.400]  by continually contracting with the corporate us being operated out of the washington dc city state
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:12.800]  americans are perpetually surrendering their constitutional sovereignty in return for corporate
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:20.880]  benefits we share a common enemy with our founding fathers today we call them globalists back then
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:28.320]  they called them british a foreign power exploiting the will and destiny of americans and back then
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:34.560]  their remedy was the committee of safety this is happening again today communities are forming
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:41.840]  their own committees of safety an excellent example is santa rosa county florida where the recall
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:49.040]  florida movement sprang from which seeks to empower the citizens of florida with the ability to recall
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:56.880]  county commissioners for corruption malfeasance and neglect of duty the county sheriff is charged
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:03.120]  with upholding the supreme law of the constitution and with your county government in line with your
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:08.880]  county sheriff citizens of that county will have the lawful parallel government they need
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:14.960]  to liberate themselves from contracts made with the corporate us because the powers held by the
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:22.480]  sheriff supersede those of any government official when in the jurisdiction of that county the scyop
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:28.800]  today is meant to make you feel dependent upon the federal government but that has always been
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:35.360]  your choice and it's not the only choice you can contact your local sheriff and ask him about his
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:42.240]  oath to uphold the constitution you can form committees of safety and you can lawfully purge
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:47.920]  your local government of corruption but it requires action and time is quickly running out
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:55.520]  reporting for info wars this is greg reese all right folks michael malice is live in studio

[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:29.440]  hit podcast or talk show host michael malis is our guest here for the next two hours maybe longer
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:36.960]  in studio with us today you can find him at michael malis dot com on twitter at michael malis
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:42.000]  and he's got a book that i've always been working on for several years the white pill a tale of good
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.280]  and evil michael malis and it couldn't be a more timely book he started writing it i know he told
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:54.480]  me about it years ago before the russian invasion of ukraine and so much more so this is a really
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:59.360]  important book to read those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it i haven't read
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:05.200]  the book yet and i'll assure you i will be reading the book so he shared with us so he said he could
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:11.680]  cover the waterfront the censorship uh you know all the things that are going on i said let's just
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:17.680]  first try to give you the floor as best we can and describe the book and your family's own
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:23.040]  experiences come to the united states to flee all this tyranny both from hitler on one side
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:26.880]  and stalling on the other and now what it's like to see this nightmare starting again in the very
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:33.440]  same place uh ukraine so it's it's great to have you here congratulations on the white pill i know
[01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:37.680]  you've written a lot of other best-selling books i would guess this one took you the longest to write
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.920]  yeah because there's so much information in there because the this book tells the story of
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.400]  the rise of the soviet union and its fall which is a happy ending but one of the other things
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.480]  that's very important talk about it was the western response by all this was going on
[01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:54.800]  so i think a lot of people especially people in your audience don't maybe have an appreciation
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:02.480]  of just how bad things were and just how much people were apologizing for historically speaking
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:06.800]  so what you what i go through step by step is people in america and people in the west
[01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.080]  you know we talk about totalitarianism we talk about you know how to talk about the
[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.960]  globalist and their agenda there is an understanding of things would get really bad
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:20.400]  but we don't have to imagine what things would be bad what that would look like because we've it's
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:25.920]  already happened here on earth in our lifetimes of everyone listening to this and it was systemic
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:31.840]  and it was step by step stalin letting started of course stalin built on it and others after them
[01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:40.240]  to kind of create a giant prison state and i talk about just what steps they did one of the biggest
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:46.400]  things that people need to appreciate in any variant of totalitarianism is any kind of private
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:53.680]  relationship is a threat to those in power so parents versus kids husbands versus wives
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:09:00.720]  friends versus each other co-workers their goal is to create a society where no one can trust
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:05.680]  anyone else and they have to rely on the government for everything and in many ways they
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:10.880]  largely succeeded with the fact of the soviet union but the important thing to take away
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:16.160]  is they didn't get everything they wanted they told people for decades this is the country of the
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:23.680]  future this is how it's going to be we're the we're the we're the next wave and they fell apart
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:27.760]  very very quickly and everyone thought this is going to be forever if you watch star trek
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:31.440]  checkoff is there because even the far far future you're going to have the westerners
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:35.840]  or you're going to have the soviets with checkoff that's not what ended up happening so i think
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:39.760]  one of the reasons also besides just telling that history which i think is crucially important
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:44.560]  is so many people in the west and especially in america have given up hope they think that the
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.920]  people who are their enemy are too powerful they've been at this too long they're too smart they're
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:52.720]  too clever and it's like we've heard this story before if you know they're lying about everything
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.600]  else why are you so convinced they're telling the truth when they tell you that their victory
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:02.320]  is inevitable and that they're not going away and that you can't defeat them so that is the biggest
[01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:07.360]  lie that they tell and so many people who would otherwise oppose them fall into that trap of
[01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.400]  believing them on that very crucial issue by the way i didn't talk to you before you came on live
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.920]  today you got here in the green room and you just came out and came on live i was struggling to try
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:21.280]  to define you and once you started talking i would describe you because i'm someone of a novice
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:25.440]  historian so i know people when they know what they're talking about when they don't i would describe
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:36.480]  you as a a pro-human person that's anti-totalitarian anti-torritarian individual hyper-libertarian
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:43.920]  a anarchist yes i'm an anarchist but but how you quantify this because what you just said is so
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:49.040]  key i want to zoom in on this and have you elaborate tyranny is not all powerful i want you to think
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.800]  it is and invest this mythic power i'm not that articulate i'm not that great my audience
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:59.920]  you know together is amazing but we're not god but if they're so scared of info wars or they
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.080]  got a censor everybody they're not that powerful that's why the internet famous saying nobody knows
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:09.120]  who coined it the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless it's not hopeless
[01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:13.200]  that's why you're saying you're white pilt that's one and right and there's the other thing that
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:19.040]  i want people to take away is there's a lot of people who have the belief that journalists used
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:23.600]  to be honest and now they're corrupt and let me give you an example that's kind of a parallel
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.240]  if you think back to when you're a kid right you think no one's drinking no one's doing drugs
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:31.120]  no one's sleeping around because you're a kid you're in kindergarten you're oblivious to all
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.560]  these things then you get older go to college then it's more frequent and you're going to have the
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:39.680]  perception that this is becoming more common it's not becoming more common you're just more aware
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:45.520]  of it as you age same thing with journalism we're taught in school about the spanish-american war
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:50.320]  william randall first yellow journalism remember the main and how the journalists led us into that
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:55.280]  war then there's kind of this record scratch and all the journalists become honest and now
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:59.040]  conservatives many conservatives think well they've just become corrupt in the last 20 years
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:03.840]  no no no one of the things i explained in this book this has been going on for over a century
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:11.920]  most crucially when stalin was starving millions of ukrainians by design when people were not able
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:18.160]  to feed their kids when they were make sure they didn't have any food all with two exceptions
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:24.800]  of the western journalists made the point to cover for these atrocities and later they admitted
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:30.400]  that oops we got it wrong here's the thing if i'm a journalist and i get it wrong when it comes to
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:35.040]  the deaths of millions of people you would think there'd be a lot like if i was a chef and i
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.640]  undercooked chicken and someone died you think there'd be a lot of hand-wringing maybe i'm in
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:43.760]  the wrong line of work there is never this kind of self-reflection of what am i doing wrong how
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:49.040]  did i screw this up so badly so i think it's crucial for people to understand and i lay out the
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:56.400]  receipts in this book that for over a hundred years every single atrocity the gulags uh the
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.480]  holodomor the the the show trials every single atrocity committed by the soviet union had western
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:08.560]  reporters tripping over and and influencers not just reporters actors writers tripping over themselves
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:14.160]  to tell the american people you don't understand these the russians are great your backwards your
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:20.000]  you have these anti-communist prejudices and this is the way we should have america be going toward
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.320]  so they've been at this for a very long time and to your point you're just some loudmouth
[01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:30.720]  with a studio in texas and yet you by yourself are causing nationwide and international problems
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:36.400]  that to me speaks to the weakness when you're trying if i'm trying to construct a narrative
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.600]  that is not uh based in reality let's suppose i i cheated my wife a lot right she's just got to
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:48.880]  catch me once and my whole situation collapses so when you point out day after day all the
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:57.040]  not just mistakes but lies that are being promulgated daily by the corporate press it becomes so
[01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:03.360]  easy to demonstrate to critical thinking people that this is systemic and this is by design
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:08.880]  beautifully said and let's be clear because you're criticizing russian tyranny you're not a
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:13.840]  russifo we're just looking at the eagles in america the eagles in ukraine the eagles in russia
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:19.040]  this is a real retrospective so we don't repeat it again which we are now but you make a good point
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:24.160]  for those that don't know history or forgot it first Stalin was bad then world war two comes
[01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:30.640]  he's good and then he's bad again it's a perfect 1984 what short draw was writing about where they're
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:35.200]  just shifting who the good guys and bad guys are on a routine basis yeah and it's really kind of
[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:40.240]  disturbing to me how you know it's very easy to make the case that look hitler's the ultimate evil
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.160]  we got to team up with the devil to stop hitler you can make that argument pretty easily and that
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:48.720]  that's kind of alluded to when we're taught history in high school but it's never explained
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:54.960]  just what stalin did just how bad he was just what he did to his own people and what he built on
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:59.360]  with lenin there's this big kind of lie which i dissect in the book and demonstrate to be false
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.760]  that lenin was good and stalin basically perverted it or if trots get been in charge it wouldn't
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.400]  have been as bad this is complete nonsense everything that stalin put into place had been
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:13.840]  originated under lenin system the secret police the gulags you know turning people against one
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:19.120]  another it's all it's all been there and it's all been repeated again and if if if they had their
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:26.160]  druthers that's the thing i do not hold to this belief that those who i regard as the enemies of
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:32.400]  liberty are always going to get their way because here's the proof if that were true no one listening
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:37.280]  to the show would have a gun if they had their way handguns would be illegal and that's why
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:41.680]  you're white pilled and i agree we're winning and turning the tide but i'm going to want people to
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:46.720]  know empire is going to strike back these people are not weak they have no shame they have no
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:52.400]  remorse but the point is they're much closer to snakes than the art of gods damn well said

[01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:02.160]  of your background in history speaking to this is when i see your podcast i watch the whole
[01:21:02.160 --> 01:21:08.080]  time so is my family you know what you're talking about and it's amazing but but the good news is
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:14.080]  we are winning tyranny can be defeated there are ways to defeat it but we have to first recognize it
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:19.840]  please continue do you know what uh ronald reagan said before he was elected president he was sat down
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:24.000]  and they were discussing the cold war and ron desantis just invoked this in his speech at cpaq
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.400]  and this is one of the key points of the book and he said to his aid he goes let me tell you my
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:35.520]  strategy for the cold war it is simple and some may say simplistic here it is we win they lose
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:40.800]  what do you think about that and they laughed in his face uh they said that he is threatening us
[01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:44.800]  to get us into nuclear war that he's a lunatic he doesn't know he's talking about he's seeing all
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:50.480]  he's a moron 10 years later 11 years later uh this evil empire that spanned half the globe
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:55.760]  no longer cease to exist and one of the reasons i wrote this book which i think is so key
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:02.080]  is that this was a big victory for the west and it was such a it was done relatively peacefully
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:06.400]  we have monuments understandably to vietnam war we have monuments to world war two where so many
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:11.600]  people gave their lives but the cold war which was one basically without firing a shot without the
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:17.200]  loss of millions of of lives and and so much bloodshed it's forgotten and no one discusses it
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:20.560]  you can't because they hate it and you can't expect in your times until this well it turned
[01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.080]  out herbert walker bush who was his vice president didn't like it because they wanted that foreign
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.240]  enemy oh absolutely herbert walker bush told gorbachev inner in writing no one wants to see
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:35.520]  uh uh the um disintegration to soviet union or i forgot the exact word he was something of that
[01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:41.200]  effect so they wanted to have that bipolar world where we're the good guys they're the bad guys
[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:47.120]  and that justifies any kind of military buildup possible and any restraints on western freedom
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:52.000]  possible will you have buckley who i'm still pissed that you have his picture up in the green room
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.960]  and that every guest of the show has to look at his face had said we need dictatorship here in the
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:01.280]  west to fight the dictatorship in the east temporarily by the way i'm no follower will you
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:06.240]  have buckley bring me bring me the bring me the photo right now just put in the bathroom where it
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:11.680]  belongs please no no i a listener mailed that to us you could hang in and most of the stuff on the
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:17.200]  walls listeners mailed us okay so we're not like like museum curator is going this is a symbol of
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.840]  who we are it was just a piece of history fine and that's why we have it i'm gonna give it to you
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:25.760]  i don't want it no no i'm gonna give it to you to you you may keep it or torture it or whatever
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:32.080]  you want bring it to me bring it to me no no no but getting serious here uh there's no special
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:37.920]  secret message in it but i get what you're saying here's where i'm at we have corporate interests
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:42.320]  that want us to stare into the abyss of russia and china right now yes in the name of defeating them
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:47.440]  we become them that you just talked about that how do we thread the needle on that well i think
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:51.840]  the most important thing this was crucial to bringing down the soviet union it's crucial
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.120]  to helping what's happening in north korea right now which is my other bailey where you take it as
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:01.120]  a hostage it's yours as a guest god help us okay oh it's heavy um that's yours now oh my skin's
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:07.360]  burning just touching it um the and the name of the show speaks to this information uh it does it's
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:11.920]  not necessarily a matter of having the weapons it's not necessarily a matter of having the numbers
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:18.000]  it's a matter of having enough people understanding what is being going on and the motivations behind
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.240]  them now i want to talk to people at home for them to appreciate what we're up against because
[01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:26.000]  imagine if someone is blue-pilled and we can talk about all the pills in a second meaning
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.640]  someone is blue-pilled is that they believe that what is on the news is by and large true and
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:36.080]  in their best interest imagine sitting someone down and trying to tell them that the weatherman
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:40.720]  is lying not just incorrect sometimes but is lying they would look at you as a crazy person
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:46.480]  but when you try to explain to someone that most of corporate media is based on an agenda and the
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:51.040]  people have no problem being dishonest they look at you in the same exact way so that's what you're
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:56.560]  up against but once you take that red pill you realize oh these are corporations corporations
[01:24:56.560 --> 01:25:01.600]  have an agenda that agenda is often not in the favor of the citizenry or or or even the people
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:06.480]  working there all of a sudden a lot of things start to make well i was about to say i don't get
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.560]  much pushed back now and i don't talk about myself it's a it's a gauge most folks aren't a public
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:15.760]  figure i went from almost nothing but love before trump but it was only like every 30th person i
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:20.720]  walked i was a listener then under trump i would get mobbed but about five percent ten percent
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.760]  were hate was still mainly love now i go all over the country nothing but love people get
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.600]  they're being lied to i think we've reached a tipping point yeah and here's the other thing a lot
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:33.120]  of times people are depressed because they're like oh the majority of people aren't going to ever come
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:36.400]  around to our land thinking it doesn't take a majority because of the majority are just going
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:41.280]  to be on the bandwagon so one year they're going to be hardcore george w bush fans the next year
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:46.240]  they're going to be obama fans they're just going to go with the tide all it takes is a significant
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:51.360]  informed minority dedicated i agree so how would you quantify describe the moment history right now
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:56.320]  i agree with you completely that this is an inflection point uh the fact that you have even
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:02.800]  one social media site where corporate journalists aren't protected and felt safe this is unprecedented
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:08.000]  and this is wonderful because on twitter they'll spread their lives and immediately dozens of
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.920]  citizens will call them out on their departure tyranny can only work when it's got complete
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:18.400]  control yes it has to but it's called totalitarianism for a reason it has to have total control
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:23.120]  here's the thing if you if the worst thing you could say about america is that you go to school
[01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:27.520]  and you learn some stupid things that aren't true and everything else is fine we could take that as
[01:26:27.520 --> 01:26:33.600]  a compromise right if the point is they have to be in your music in your supermarket uh in your
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:39.200]  bedroom they have to be everywhere god that sounds exhausting i can't even run my own life much less
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.120]  what is it about the totalitarians and these globalists they throughout history they want to
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:47.840]  run everything in control but that sounds hellish and but the other thing is alex which is important
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:52.960]  it's also expensive you said it was exhausting if i'm going to run every aspect of everyone's life
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:58.160]  that costs me a lot in terms of emotional costs people pushing back financial costs technological
[01:26:58.160 --> 01:27:01.840]  where you could just lead them with a better system but it's also the fact that this is why
[01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:06.720]  they're vulnerable because the more money and more effort it takes for me to maintain my system
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:11.280]  the harder it is for me to sustain it people have this idea that if you know if we have this if
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:15.280]  china had this big empire over the world as they certainly would want to do that it would be easy
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:21.280]  for them it's not these giant empires are not structurally well just like hitler or just like
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:26.080]  the japanese in world war two they expanded because they were collapsing internally right you have to
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:30.240]  it's the kind of thing where it's like wily coyote runs off the of the cliff and then when he looks
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.000]  down he falls because you realize gravity is there you can't keep these things going on
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.160]  infinitely because at a certain point it's like satchel said she's on the cover of the book the
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:42.560]  problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other people's money we got to go to break
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:48.320]  again longer segments coming up but again inflection point so we're at a crossroads i think we're at
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.680]  a major crossroads and i do want to talk about trump after the break because he said some things
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:55.600]  recently that i think i want to hear your thoughts on absolutely but but in the minute we have left
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:00.800]  tell people about the book where they get it why pillbook.com and i've been delighted by i was
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:05.440]  not selling Pompeo like Pompeo so when you have a situation like that surely that's room for hope
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:12.480]  for Pompeo is truly a bad person yes so recently he was attacking trump for policies
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:18.000]  that he helped formulate well i mean i mean that's wow that's like i i think the republican party
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.680]  are delusional because they believe the corporate media narrative that once trump goes away with
[01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:26.960]  they're going to return to normal and if you look at the base of the gop they have no hunger for
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:33.520]  they're totally populist radicalized now there's no hunger for 2015 zero and if mike penson nicky
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.200]  hailey think they've got a shot maybe they could get a shot the nomination the establishment
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:40.640]  they're being booed everywhere but they're being booed to their face and they don't know how to
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.920]  handle it because except for being this corporate politician and pretend it's not happening
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:50.480]  okay we're taking the white pill and michael malis straight ahead stay with us info wars.com

[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:52.000]  air i know that less than one percent of our listeners actually go buy products info wars

[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:03.360]  problems will be over please take action now leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:19.280]  world order it's alex jones
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:32.560]  live from austin texas it's alex jones with a great michael malis let me tell a little
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:37.920]  story about censorship we'll get more into this in the next hour michael malis but since they banned
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:44.400]  is four years ago they banned any even sub url we use to push people to info wars.com our band
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:49.600]  i video and so sometimes they ban stuff in a week sometimes they go three months we've had dozens of
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:56.320]  url since this happened but about a month ago we created conspiracy fact.info that would take you
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:01.920]  to info wars.com forward slash show so our guests and other people that were coming on could say hey
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:07.360]  i'm going live on the show here's the url well roseanne barb was going to be in studio saturday
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:13.520]  and she was and so i went live at noon she was going to be on at one before the show we checked
[01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:19.040]  conspiracy fact.info you could post the link to twitter i said hey that's the link to post blah
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:24.400]  blah she puts it out wouldn't let her put it out won't let you put it out now conspiracy fact.info so
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:29.840]  the new url and one where we have thousands of they try to ban these the new url will put it
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:36.560]  on screen for you right now is madmaxworld.tv because with them creating all the crime and
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:41.040]  letting it flourish and all that we're entering a madmax world with the energy being cut off
[01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:46.400]  that's what caused the fictional madmax novel you know where the energy is cut off oil runs out
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:54.320]  madmaxworld.tv will take you directly to bandot video and share any link it creates its own urls
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:35:00.640]  and for now that is a link they're not banning madmaxworld.tv michael malice please continue
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:05.600]  well i'm just is their whole what is the point of this because again is this are they just trying
[01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:10.160]  to play whack-a-mole with you they could just if they knock off one url a url costs ten dollars to
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:14.240]  create well what is their purpose as long as listeners get excited and promote it they lose
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:19.360]  exactly yeah i i mean they're trying to exhaust us we got to exhaust them but that's just i mean if
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:23.920]  i wanted to take down alex jones like this is all i this is another just speaks to my point like
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:28.560]  this is all you've got that you you're gonna knock off a url cost him ten bucks okay so you
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:32.480]  just change the url it just takes two seconds if they had their druthers you this show wouldn't
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:36.480]  exist and that you'd be vanished into some gulag this is another reason why it's important for
[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:40.400]  people to to have perspective and not lose hope they're putting everything that they had against
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:44.960]  you to shut you in this show up and here we are having a nice conversation we agree on a lot of
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:48.800]  things we disagree on a lot of things and it's perfectly fine the only people that should be
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:54.160]  bothered by this are those in power well we're really evil we're criticizing stalin london
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:59.680]  yeah right yeah yeah my god yeah well no no no no hold on there's a chapter in this book about
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.320]  someone who i know you know a lot about and is it's gonna raise the dander on the back of your
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:10.240]  neck and that's henry wallace so henry people in this country are you're not taught this in school
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:16.880]  henry wallace was a roosevelt's fdr second vice president uh he was very close to uh not literally
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:24.880]  stalin but stalinist operatives he went to visit uh a gulag uh he went to visit all the way uh in
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:31.120]  cyberia they put on a literal song and dance for him the prisoners and they took him around because
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:36.720]  he was former um he had a background in agriculture they take him to a pig farm and he's asked him oh
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:39.840]  how are you raising these pigs now the people operating the pig farm weren't the weren't the
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:44.320]  prisoner farmers they were opera chicks so they just didn't know what to answer him so the translators
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:49.760]  had to cover so he's and he comes back and he says there's no two countries more alike than the
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:54.560]  united states in the soviet union and it's like a new wild he says it's like a wild west all of
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:59.920]  these russians are moving to cyberia it's just a new frontier for them well they're moving there
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:05.440]  because they were all arrested for no reason and they're all prisoner slaves having to you said
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:09.040]  that would raise my hackles i totally agree with you well no no i'm just mentioning henry wallace's
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:13.600]  name it's just one of those names were like he's not household knowledge but he should be more
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:19.440]  prominent and it the other thing is there was a woman ellenor lipper and others who were prisoners
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:23.520]  on the other side of the fence they were there and when she escaped because she was a foreign
[01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:29.520]  national wrote a book about it he looked like a complete fool and in 1952 which would have been
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:33.600]  the last of his second term if he had been elected president as he had tried to do
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:40.160]  when he ran against truman and doing in 1948 he admitted up communism's evil it's like yeah
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:44.800]  you're saying this now eight years in but you were a complete fool for this and god that's kind
[01:37:44.800 --> 01:37:50.640]  of like the poison shots what we were this close to having henry wallace be president because it's
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:56.320]  what like a hundred days into fdr's fourth term that truman got sworn in so people don't appreciate
[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:00.320]  just how bad things could have been in the past and that's another reason why i'm so hopeful
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:04.960]  about the future go ahead absolutely well i was just going to say that i forgot i was going to say
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:11.280]  but it it's it's it's it is an amazing moment to be alive right now well absolutely but again
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:17.440]  like so much of what we are taught in popular consciousness and in school is just a very
[01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:24.000]  narrow sliver of history and it's designed many cases to demoralize americans and to see them in
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000]  a certain kind of a path to make them think that the rise of the state is inevitable and that
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.920]  progress means the growth of government and the loss of liberties they've been singing this song
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:38.000]  for a hundred years and as long as that breath in my body they're not going to have their way and
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.200]  hopefully everyone listening to this will agree with me on that regard so projecting the research
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.360]  in the history of your book and your own family history what is your view on the conflict in
[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:53.120]  ukraine i am completely ignorant about this here's my view because people have this idea because i
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:57.040]  was born ukraine i left there when i was one half that i'm going to have some kind of inside
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:02.800]  knowledge my what i do know a lot about is north korea and my big concern is the parallels to the
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:07.920]  korean war because you had in the north you had the chinese and the russians in the south you had
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.160]  the us and the un the korean people were the ones who lost that war everyone else was a tie
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.320]  you the country was leveled uh they were bombed to oblivion all the things that were left were
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:21.760]  like the chimneys and just these entire countryside were laid to ruin and my big fear my big fear is
[01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:26.480]  for the russian people and for the ukrainian people that this is going to be a proxy war
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:30.880]  and the ukrainian people are going to pay the price exactly they're the losers the war is right
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:35.440]  and anytime you have all this pressure on on zelensky or ukrainians not to kind of
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:38.640]  reach some compromise and i kind of say in the argument like oh you're not going to
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:42.400]  validate aggression and thatcher was very big on this with the falcons when argentine invaded
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:48.400]  you can't negotiate with people who aggress point being at what cost and are you just going to fund
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.800]  the ukrainians until they're completely destroyed are you planning on taking putin out what what's
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:39:57.760]  not going to look like it's really not going to be easy to do so we just showed some footage of us
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:04.320]  weapons uh being delivered to poland to be delivered into ukraine that they confirm on this is insane
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:10.320]  but here's my big concern at a certain point if you are funding a war in ukraine as an american
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:15.040]  at what point does it does america and american assets become legitimate targets for the russians
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:19.040]  right at a certain point if you're funding this war and you're funding weapons there
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:23.200]  doesn't can you can understand why putin is going to hit new york or something else like you do it
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:28.480]  make perfect sense to do that that's i don't have any information about what's going on over there
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:33.840]  but i do have concerns and those are my concerns well my concerns are i'm not a russian model
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:39.280]  ukrainian and i see that both sides have historical beliefs with each other with good reason yeah but
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:44.160]  but the east of ukraine it's you know it's mainly russian and if the russians were putting troops
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:49.120]  on our border we would be really really upset and so if putin was putting troops in canada or
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:55.760]  mexico i'd be upset and so now that nato is openly involved i even saw a cnn report in a
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:41:00.240]  washington post report in new york timesport going oh my god all the dead russians is making
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.520]  the russians want more war well of course i mean this is escalating they need experts to tell them
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:11.360]  that that's just history yeah but i think the the bloodlust for the corp for um uh by the
[01:41:11.360 --> 01:41:16.080]  corporate press for war cannot be overstated uh they there's not they have not been a war that
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:21.520]  they don't like uh they're if it bleeds it leads is kind of that slogan you know it that is my
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:26.560]  concern the new york times for a very long time has had a history of being that it's just funny
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:31.760]  because if you read if you most people think okay new york times is left left is anti-war
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:37.200]  conservatives pro military pro war then new york times has been the biggest outlet for
[01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:42.880]  war mongering that that would make you know the biggest warhawk on a republican party blush
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:47.040]  back to the spanish-american war yes and the thing is they they could do it shamelessly
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:51.840]  because they can say oh we're the lefty so we're not really pro war it's it's it's such a con job
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:57.360]  and it's just very disheartening to see how many people fall for it and my again like you just said
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:01.920]  earlier i want peace and i want people to be safe and secure in their own homes and not have to
[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:06.640]  worry about bombs flying and then people becoming orphans and what's your gut tell you because they're
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:12.000]  saying this war is gonna last years now oh god i i don't i don't know what what my god is telling
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.320]  me and and i don't think biden is a strong leader to put it mildly i don't know what the forces are
[01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:21.600]  behind that white house but it seems very very clear that all the pressure is on containing
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:26.480]  continuous war as much as possible which is is just very disturbing to see all right i want to
[01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:31.120]  shift gears out of that now i want to go back to white pill why you're optimistic i am too
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:35.600]  because as bad as things are the amount of people not buying the system is is better than ever
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:41.360]  but i don't think we can just oppose the corrupt globalist system we've got to create something new
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:44.800]  yes i think that's a great way of looking at it the white pills to be precise i'm gonna be a little
[01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.360]  pedantic the white pill isn't optimism the white pill is hope and if you're going to sit here and
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:54.720]  tell me that as americans our journey toward freedom and taking our country back is hopeless
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:59.600]  i don't want to talk to you all right let's talk about it we come back yep ladies and gentlemen

[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:05.520]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:16.720]  i remember when i remember i remember when i lost my mind
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:25.120]  there was something so pleasant about that place even your emotions haven't let go in so much space
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:30.640]  so michael malis was rightfully complaining about my william f buckley picture that the
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:35.600]  listener sent us the end of the wall just this is interesting we have all sorts of interesting photos
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:42.000]  i said what do you want to use as white piled examples when we come back a global awakening
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.880]  against tyranny you said i want to talk about east germany versus west germany east berlin versus
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:52.000]  west berlin i said well i've got a photo i've got a picture that actually mine my mother came back
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.480]  from germany probably she's been there many times 20 years ago and she was at a museum about the fall
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:04.400]  of the berlin wall we get a boom operator in here we can show you this and it's it's a photo a famous
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:08.800]  photo when the berlin wall a few years before it fell where a child went through with their parents
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:14.160]  we got caught in the barbed wire and then a east german soldier took the child saved the child got
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:18.560]  him through but that east german soldier disappeared and no one knew whatever happened to him here i can
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:24.880]  do it this way so it's one of a boom problem there you go so this is where we are ladies and gentlemen
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:30.240]  and this is one of the photos on the wall that's actually one of mine beautiful and so you wanted
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.320]  to go there next go ahead well first of all i just want to clarify when you put in those terms the
[01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:39.360]  idea of hanging william f buckley now sounds more appealing to me so maybe i was a little bit wrong
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:44.960]  there's someone named conrad schumann conrad schumann was uh east you know they they what people
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:49.840]  don't appreciate i didn't i think a lot of people don't realize the berlin wall berlin isn't in the
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:55.120]  center of east and west germany it's entirely enclosed in eastern germany so when they built the
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:00.960]  wall they surrounded the entire half of the city and it was a bizarre prison in that the people who
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:06.400]  were imprisoned were the free ones if you were a member a citizen of west berlin that's part of
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:11.680]  west germany it was not contiguous with with the the liberal democratic west germany so there was a
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:17.360]  um an officer conrad schumann as they were trying to build the berlin wall and imprisoned the citizens
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:23.200]  of uh west berlin and he you know it would be his job if someone's trying to cross this wall
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:29.760]  to shoot them and he's this young kid and he's like i can't do this i cannot shoot my countrymen
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:34.320]  just because they're trying to cross the street so there was a photographer there was watching him
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:38.320]  seeing him like wait a minute what's this guy up to a guy used to photograph horses so he knew
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:42.800]  how to have that exact kind of reflexes and the moment schumann jumped the fence he got the shot
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:48.640]  the west berlin people cops got him into a car uh traffic him to freedom and it was just this
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.360]  beautiful happy ending but it's just this amazing moment and that caused the chain reaction so as
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:57.920]  russell brand comes out against the new world order and as elon musk comes out against the new
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:03.040]  order as joe roger comes out against the new order and the globalist this is a microcosm of that
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:07.680]  people jump in the fence but it's all right but it's also the idea that there's so many of us who
[01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:13.360]  maybe are in positions to do the wrong thing and it just to remind you that you still as a human
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:17.440]  being have a conscience and the opportunity to do the right thing there's another great story
[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:23.600]  hans mikesner me me i x n e r and he fell in love with a girl from east berlin and he's like all
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:29.120]  right i'm gonna marry this girl but i gotta get the heck out of east germany so he goes to check
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:33.680]  point charlie which is the big crossing point between the two the two halves of the city and he
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:39.760]  realizes that that bar which they raised for the car to go through is not that tall so he gets a
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:45.760]  british car puts her in the backseat puts the future mother-in-law in the trunk surrounds her
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:50.960]  with bricks in case they start shooting takes up the windshield takes some air out of the tires
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:56.800]  and when they point him to go to the next spot he just floors it like the matrix the car goes
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:00.960]  under that bar and he escapes with her in the future mother-in-law to freedom in west berlin
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:06.720]  and married her so the answer to tyranny is stop complying but the and but the answer also is we
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:13.760]  all have the ability in our own little personal ways to fight and find for our freedom even in
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:19.120]  the most unfree situation and i gotta tell you as bad as things often are in america and as bad as
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:25.120]  it would be if those who i oppose would have their druthers we still have a lot of opportunity all of
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:29.040]  us to do something and move the needle in the right direction so i haven't read the book yet
[01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:33.920]  it's examples in russia and east germany and everywhere in europe but but what about white
[01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:38.320]  pill moments here i see you on must three weeks ago at the world government forum put on by the
[01:51:38.320 --> 01:51:43.840]  world economic forum calling for total tyranny implantable chips total tracking universal credit
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:50.000]  score all of this and there's a lot must say no the new world order is bad centralization is bad
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.960]  we shouldn't have i mean i mean i'm seeing just big defeats of them bill marr comes out against
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:59.840]  all the policies i mean it's it's happening and anyone listening to this with a straight face
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:07.440]  look at john fetterman and kamala harris and say these are unstoppable foes we can't win against
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:12.400]  people who are this impressive it's a joke when you realize the thing is it's not that they're
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:17.520]  particularly impressive particularly smart they've been at this for a lot longer and they've built
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:22.960]  up this edifice for a long time but that this just because you're starting on third base
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:28.560]  does not at all guarantee you're going to have that home run especially and as a result of covid
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:34.640]  so many more people are aware of what we're up against uh how low they'll be willing to go
[01:52:34.640 --> 01:52:39.840]  and the point that i think republicans especially like maybe they always talk about like reagan
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:43.520]  and tipponeel like oh we're going to sit down together everyone's going to shake hands at work
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:47.920]  i think now people are using gun controls a good example these people aren't arguing in good faith
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:51.680]  they don't really want to have safety they want to have yeah we're not compromising because we
[01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:55.760]  know it's not a compromise there's nothing to compromise because as soon as they get the r15s
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:52:59.920]  instantly it's going to be let's go after this gun or let's go after handguns and every and i
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:05.440]  think everyone who was pro gun rights has come to this realization in the last 10 years so you
[01:53:05.440 --> 01:53:09.360]  know elon musk you and joe gone out he answered them a lot they're having a little event tomorrow
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:14.640]  i'm told but the point is is that elon musk whether he's good or bad he realizes the pendulum's
[01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:19.280]  going towards freedom so he's jumped over to it so we should see that as a good sign i'll take
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:25.600]  whatever hope i can get because if you don't have hope you cannot win if you don't have a vision
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:29.680]  of what you're fighting for you cannot pop and i said that earlier we can't just oppose them what
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:35.440]  do we stand for so what do we stand for or what do you stand for what should we aspire to as the
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:40.880]  alternate system a and b what is it to be white pills i agree it's not like some oh you're you're
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:45.440]  naive almost like a blue pill you think everything's fine no no you just have optimism and hope for
[01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:51.040]  humanity nor do i and 75 percent this book nor am i of the belief that human beings are basically
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:56.640]  good and that those who are in power oh they only just want to kind of raise taxes and have regulation
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:02.000]  the the people who are in power are pure evil uh there's you can't put anything past them the things
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.000]  that they do to children historically and in present times are things i would never sit down
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:10.000]  and think of in a million years but the point being they're not omnipotent and they're not
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:14.640]  unstoppable uh and there's many many examples which you talk about all the time where they just take
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:19.680]  l after l after l the fact that people are now campaigning on imprisoning fauci uh which would
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:25.440]  have been an unspeakable taboo a couple of years ago in and of itself is speaks to how much free
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:30.960]  speech despite attempts to the 500 000 person demonstrations in germany 200 000 in britain
[01:54:30.960 --> 01:54:35.280]  huge ones here the media ignores it but the people know what's happening and the other thing is like
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:41.360]  you're pointing out if urls are infinite you can make as many urls as you want back in the day
[01:54:41.360 --> 01:54:47.440]  there were three channels cbs abc nbc if those three channels agreed not to talk about you
[01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:52.480]  you don't exist now you are demonstrating just today there are infinite channels you could
[01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:57.760]  have yeah they're gonna block one url okay here's ten dollars he's another url that's the best you
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:03.200]  can do so just that progress in the last 30 years alone shows how difficult it is for the enemy class
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.360]  to control the conversation and that's another reason why people should all be hopeful if the
[01:55:07.360 --> 01:55:11.600]  people have energy if they care if they stand up guys i'd ask you to print this up you probably did
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:17.280]  put on my desk but print me the oh how we burn in the camps quote by sultan eason and what's the
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:22.880]  full sultan eason quote i can't remember the exact quote but we know they know they know we know we
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:27.600]  know they're lying they know they're lying they know we know they're lying but still they're lying
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:32.640]  i think it's something to that effect and i i don't think that quote applies to america because
[01:55:32.640 --> 01:55:36.080]  if you look at corporate journalists on on twitter that's my preferred social media site
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:42.800]  they are shocked by the pushback they get uh from average people they really think that they're respected
[01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:47.760]  and liked but nowadays especially after covid when they'd be filming wearing a mask but the
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:51.680]  cameraman doesn't have a mask and anyone with a cell phone could just film and show that as soon
[01:55:51.680 --> 01:55:55.840]  as the cameras goes off they take the mask off that these people are they're so naive they're
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:00.240]  actually it makes me feel bad that they're dominating it's like you said these people are a joke but
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.560]  again they're dominating us because they had so many years in the past you kind of so they're
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:09.440]  running off stuff at the bank don't you think i agree here it is the rulers are simple they lie
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:16.000]  to us we know they're lying they know they know we know they're lying but they keep lying to us
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:20.640]  and keep pretending to believe them and we keep we keep pretending to believe them yeah yeah the
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:26.880]  rulers are simple they lie to us we know they're lying they know we know they're lying but they
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:31.280]  keep lying to us and we keep pretending to believe them but i don't but that's the thing in the
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:34.720]  the Soviet Union, you had to pretend to believe them, right? Because if I'm in the Soviet Union
[01:56:34.720 --> 01:56:39.600]  and I discuss this heavily in the book, I can't say that the newspaper prop is full
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:44.320]  of crap because that's going to be trouble for me and my family. No one has repercussions
[01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:48.080]  for going on at Facebook and or talking to their friends and family being like, the New
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:52.320]  York Times is full of crap. The Washington Post is just propaganda. And that is exactly
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:55.440]  so we're far from where other people have been. We better fight now or we're going to
[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:59.060]  go there. I agree. Right. Exactly. And again, stop getting
[01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:06.840]  intimidated by completely unimpressive people. Like Federmann, like Federmann. Well, I actually
[01:57:06.840 --> 01:57:11.760]  sent him money because I want the Senate to look as much like Arkham Asylum as possible.
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:14.760]  And my hope is that one day he's going to be on the Senate floor and his head just explodes
[01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:19.040]  and well, we'll come back and talk about that second hour about to begin. Why are we seeing
[01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:23.600]  Biden's and Federmann's and others that can't even talk? Is that on purpose or is it a manifestation
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:28.400]  of the crumbling, rotting edifice of the establishment? We're right back second hour. Michael Mallins,
[01:57:28.400 --> 01:57:33.960]  the new book, The White Pill, get it today. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Infowars.com

[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:02.400]  with viewers and listeners' support while selling you great products at the same time.

[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:48.840]  to enrich your life and keep us on air, infowars.com.
[01:59:48.840 --> 01:59:57.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:57.840 --> 02:00:10.640]  All right, Michael Mountain was the best-selling author, hit pod guesters, our guest at Studio,
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:13.880]  next segment, he wants to talk about Donald Trump and some of his statements the last
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:18.240]  few weeks. But right now, a lot of people call into the show or I see him calling on
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:22.600]  infowars. Jones is a coward. He doesn't want to lead a violent revolution. Well, the average
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:26.760]  cop or just department person or whoever, they're like part of the system, but they're
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:31.600]  not running it. How does killing them do something? That would bring in martial law. I want to
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:36.200]  win a velvet revolution of ideas. That's where 90% of real war happens. This is the
[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:38.200]  info or Michael Malone's. Where's your view on that?
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:43.400]  I agree through 10,000%, which defies mathematics. If you have violence in the street, if we
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:49.080]  saw this with the BLM riots, that is the easiest and most effective method for people who don't
[02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:53.200]  care about politics to be like, I just need this to end and to validate martial law, to
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:57.920]  validate restrictions on freedom. If you think the Patriot Act is a problem now, imagine
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:01.120]  what happens if there's some kind of a failed violent revolution.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:05.040]  And they've been trying to get that just off January 6th and opening the gates up. They're
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:07.480]  trying to brand all the centers of terrorists right now.
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:11.480]  Look what they did to the freedom convoy in Canada. These are truckers who were just honking
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:16.400]  their horns and they pulled them away to God knows where, invoked emergency powers. Listen,
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:20.040]  if the government can invoke emergency powers, it's going to create emergencies to invoke
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:21.040]  them.
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:23.360]  And we know they have provocateurs to do it, so let's not do it.
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:27.000]  Yeah, I think the call to violence is really, and the other thing is violence sings its
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:30.240]  own song. So once that kind of genie's out the bottle, you don't know where it's going
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:34.720]  to end up. I think that's a very dangerous idea. I think as long as there's free speech
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:38.440]  in this country, which despite the mechanisms, you could still get your voice out there.
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:42.880]  Well, look at Russia and Ukraine. The globalists just sit back and roast hot dogs on the fire.
[02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:47.040]  Yeah, yeah. And the people who are the dangerous ones aren't the ones who are going to be in
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:51.520]  the line of fire. They never are. So I think this is just absolutely a crazy thing to kind
[02:01:51.520 --> 02:01:53.640]  of normalize and discuss.
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:56.840]  That's why when I see news saying that I'm calling for violence, when I say info war,
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:00.920]  tip of the spear, break their back. I mean, intellectually, everybody knows that because
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:03.240]  the Pentagon admits 90% of war is intellectual.
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:08.560]  Of course. And that's another reason why hope is so important. If you convince the population
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:12.440]  that you're always going to be under the thumb of Washington, why would you bother fighting?
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:15.760]  You're going to save your time and spend time with your kids because, well, I can't win.
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:19.680]  So I might as well let them have what I want. So that is by far the most effective way to
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:22.960]  defeat your opponent is to convince them that your victory is inevitable.
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:26.680]  And notice the anonymous people online saying we should be violent. They're not being violent.
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:27.680]  They want us to do it.
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:30.480]  Yeah. Right. It's always somebody else who's going to put their, their selves in their
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:34.040]  families in the line of fire and get themselves injured and we're.
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:38.160]  But at what point, which we want to avert, is violence authorized when they're rounding
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:39.160]  us up?
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:43.440]  Oh, I don't know. We've got a ways to go. I think. And I don't even like speculating
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:47.120]  about that. I think God help us if we get to that point.
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:48.120]  God help them if we do.
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:52.600]  Well, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, I, I, I think the more kind of this talk that's out there
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:56.760]  in the zeitgeist, the easiest for them to kind of no, I agree. They'll totally take
[02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:57.760]  it out of context.
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:00.360]  And they're also going to fight for restrictions for gun rights because then it's going to
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:04.960]  be like, look, people are talking about, you know, vile revolution, even the country shot
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:08.560]  a vile revolution. We can't let them have their guns. And Mitch McConnell, I would follow
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:13.280]  our 1776 model. We tried for a decade to fix it. They came to confiscate the guns.
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:17.960]  They shot first, but we're not looking for that folks. Because in a modern world, back
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:23.960]  then info war was 20%. According to Pentagon, I agree with them. Now it's 90%. So inform
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:29.160]  mate, the pins mired the sword more than ever, use the damn pin before you talk about a war.
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:33.360]  And here's something else I think people need to appreciate that Americans got, I mean,
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:36.920]  you're going to not like hearing this, aren't as pro freedom as you'd like to think, because
[02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:40.880]  the pushback against COVID was very, very weak, given what you would think Americans
[02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:45.040]  would put up with. And it's given some very evil people some very useful information about
[02:03:45.040 --> 02:03:49.720]  the limits of American compliance and it was not great. COVID was a test. It was a test
[02:03:49.720 --> 02:03:54.000]  by design or not, they, they learned what they can get away with them, what they can't.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.760]  And they, what they learned is a lot of people were more than happy to be imprisoned in their
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:03.200]  own homes under threat of a virus. What do you think they're going to hit us with next?
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:09.480]  I think things are going to start falling apart really quickly. I think they, here's
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:13.680]  the thing, the midterms didn't go the way that the Democrats would want, but they're
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:16.960]  not really taking their victory lap. And I think that's kind of intriguing to me. You
[02:04:16.960 --> 02:04:21.200]  would think they'd be like, look, we defeated the evil Republicans or a threat to our democracy.
[02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:24.600]  This is all great. But they're kind of quiet because I think they've got their guy Kevin
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:28.120]  McCarthy in there and he's going to be able to make deals with Biden. I don't trust them
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:32.400]  as far as I could throw him, let alone McConnell, you know, who certainly cares far more about
[02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:36.080]  Joe Biden's views than he does about the average American citizen. So I don't know where things
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:39.240]  are going to go, but I'm very hopeful about the future because I think more Americans
[02:04:39.240 --> 02:04:42.640]  are realizing you can't, you're not going to be saved by whoever's in the White House.
[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:45.320]  As long as they can't trick us into race war miles.
[02:04:45.320 --> 02:04:50.120]  Right. And that knowing that Washington is not going to save you, I think that is a big
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:59.640]  epiphany. I've got an example that would come back. Stay right there.
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:03.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset in the War for the World is a historic
[02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:08.240]  book that documents the global to their own words, plan for our future that is the hellish
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:12.360]  future. Now you'll be always while they stole our books, I guess they're starting to ban
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:16.040]  them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset in the War for the World at
[02:05:16.040 --> 02:05:20.440]  bookstores, Amazon or infowarshore.com. But you will never be able to get another signed
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:25.240]  copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:29.800]  left of them right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World,
[02:05:29.800 --> 02:05:34.920]  a signed copy at infowarshore.com. And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:39.160]  to keep us on the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book,
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:42.840]  you'll also know that you help keep info words on the air. I'm going to thank those of you
[02:05:42.840 --> 02:05:46.560]  that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies. But I want to encourage
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:52.600]  all of you who haven't yet to go to infowarshore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned
[02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:57.240]  copies and donate to the library or give them to the local school. This is an info war,
[02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:01.240]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:05.440]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak. Sick, just let me sick.
[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:10.520]  Even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns, of course, will be on their
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:15.640]  way. It's chance of suffering. Damn it. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:21.440]  in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means
[02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:27.880]  to meaning and for those who will listen, the annunciation of the truth. The truth is
[02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:32.560]  something terribly wrong with this country, isn't that? You designed it, sir. You wanted
[02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:38.760]  it for proof. You taught me every television in London. Cruelty and intolerance and oppression.
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:43.160]  And where once you have the freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit, you now
[02:06:43.160 --> 02:06:47.480]  have senses and systems of surveillance, perversing your conformity and...
[02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:48.480]  Cameras.
[02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:54.720]  Cameras. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Certainly there are those who are more responsible
[02:06:54.720 --> 02:07:00.000]  than others. They will be held accountable. But again, truth be told, if you're looking
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:06.760]  for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you
[02:07:06.760 --> 02:07:13.680]  were afraid. Who would be? War, terror and disease. There were a myriad of problems that
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:19.400]  inspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of
[02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:25.040]  you. And in your panic, you turned to the now high Chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised
[02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:30.120]  you order. He promised you peace. And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient
[02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:31.120]  consent.
[02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:43.960]  There is a war. It's happening now. It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to
[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:50.960]  choose sides has come. We are the resistance. We are the InfoWars.
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:08:03.960]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:25.480]  InfoWars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are effective. The
[02:08:25.480 --> 02:08:34.280]  great awakening is here. Go to fans.video. Download the videos and share. Support the
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:44.280]  information war at infowarstore.com. And never give up the fight.
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:55.800]  All right, Michael Malus in studio. Paul Watson popping in on the big breaking news. Michael,
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:01.720]  you want to talk about Trump. And man, I get dumbfounded. I like Robert Kennedy Jr. talking
[02:09:01.720 --> 02:09:05.880]  about running for president against Biden. I get behind him. DeSantis done a lot of good
[02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:10.080]  stuff. I like DeSantis, but he's a little too pro war for me. There's some anti-free
[02:09:10.080 --> 02:09:12.880]  speech stuff coming out of Florida right now. I'm really concerned about it. I don't know
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:19.440]  whether that's out of control. But Trump, in some of his statements, it's like a 20-minute
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:21.960]  clip won't play the whole thing. You mentioned this. I didn't know about the clip, but I
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:26.000]  went and found the transcript. It's true. He made a very bizarre statement. So he gave
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.480]  a speech over the weekend saying, you're going to get retribution. We're going to bring
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:34.680]  down the deep state. But then in another interview, he said he's not going to be out head hunting.
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:39.200]  Yeah, there was a clip when he was with Hugh Hewitt. And for me, I think the biggest reason
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:43.120]  people would want to support Trump from what I've heard from people in the audience, that
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:47.120]  it's like, all right, he's going to get payback, right? He got wronged. Trump is a vindictive
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:50.520]  guy. He's petty. That's the argument people always say. He's going to take it down the
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:54.080]  deep state. But when he was on Hugh Hewitt, he was asked about this explicitly. Do we
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:56.920]  have the clip or do we have a transcript of it?
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:00.960]  We have the clip. Oh, you guys are able to find it on a 20-minute clip? Great job, crew.
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:05.160]  You told him five minutes ago. My amazing crew found it. Wow. I'm impressed. Here's the
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:11.200]  clip. Well, they got it exactly wrong. Well, they did get it wrong. But my question is,
[02:10:11.200 --> 02:10:16.080]  if you're back in the Oval, will you use the powers of the presidency to punish people
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:22.440]  who punished you? No, I wouldn't do that because I want to bring our country forward. No, I
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:27.200]  wouldn't do that. What are the best things you did when you ran the first time? I wouldn't.
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:31.040]  I would be entitled to a revenge tour if you want to know the truth, but I wouldn't do
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:36.800]  that. I would want to straighten out our border. I would want to get inflation down, build
[02:10:36.800 --> 02:10:42.520]  our economy up, which is actually doing very poorly. You do have a potential disaster in
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:47.360]  your hands with the war. You also have a disaster with Kim Jong-un of North Korea. I get along
[02:10:47.360 --> 02:10:52.840]  with him great. He always liked me. You saw that, and he doesn't like Biden at all. He's
[02:10:52.840 --> 02:10:57.000]  arming up, and Iran is arming up, and you've got to do something about it.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.400]  One of the people who was going to declare for president this month, according to reports
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:04.640]  this morning, is Nikki Haley. If she runs for president, what's your response to the
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:08.640]  president? Okay, so there's Trump saying he's not going to go after people. That was back
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:14.320]  on February 2nd. We have a new clip from Friday at one of his rallies saying the opposite.
[02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:20.320]  Here's that clip. And if you put me back in the White House, their reign is over. Their
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:25.680]  reign will be over, and they know it. And America will be a free nation once again. We're not
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:31.880]  a free nation right now. We don't have free press. We don't have free anything. In 2016,
[02:11:31.880 --> 02:11:40.000]  I declared, I am your voice. Today, I add, I am your warrior. I am your justice. And
[02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:46.000]  for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution. I am your retribution.
[02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:52.280]  Not going to let this happen. Maybe he's saying this now. He knows they're going to
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:12:03.280]  let it happen. I will totally obliterate the deep state. I will fire.
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:09.800]  So he needs to clarify this. He just said he won't go out of the deep state in February.
[02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:14.320]  And then now, Archie says he will. Michael Malls, good point, you're right.
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:18.720]  Trump treated Anthony Fauci far better than he treated Steve Bannon or any of the January
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:23.480]  six protesters who got locked up for insolence for God knows how long. And for him to go
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:27.840]  on with a straight face and say, I'm not going to have retribution for people who have wronged
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:32.200]  me. This reminds me very much of 2001. Alex, I'm sure you remember this. You probably covered
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:36.400]  at the time when they were going to go after Bill Clinton for perjury after he left the
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:41.760]  White House. And the first thing George W. Bush did as president was to put a kibosh on
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:46.480]  any kind of criminal prosecution of the former president and the first lady because he thought
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:50.120]  this was going to divide the country and make us look bad. And it really sounds like Trump
[02:12:50.120 --> 02:12:55.040]  is saying the same thing out of his own words. And this isn't TDS talking. And this is explicitly
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:13:00.840]  saying I'm not going to have retribution. It's just, it saddens me to hear him say this
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:04.760]  because if he's saying this now, it certainly sounds like he would do it as well.
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:09.760]  Well, it's very paradoxical. He's telling a radio show. I'm not going to do it. And
[02:13:09.760 --> 02:13:15.640]  then he goes on a month later and says, I am, I can't think of any examples of him going
[02:13:15.640 --> 02:13:20.280]  after his political opponents as opposed to people who work for him, try to do a good
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:25.560]  job. No, instead, Jared Custer gives them blow jobs.
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:30.520]  I mean, can anyone think of a good example of Trump taking down one of his political
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:33.840]  opponents and causing consequences? The best example I can think of, which was actually
[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:38.720]  very funny was when Nancy Pelosi and all the Democrats were trying to use a military plane
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:42.120]  to go overseas to visit a military base and he pulled a permission slip and they had to
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:46.280]  drive the bus around and then they had to go back home. So that was humorous. But in
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:49.800]  terms of, you know, crushing his opponent, he has a lot of big talk, but he didn't exercise
[02:13:49.800 --> 02:13:53.520]  power in Steve state at any level. He, right. He was very good at taking on
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:57.800]  Jeb Bush, John Kasich in the primaries and making sure they didn't get the nomination
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:03.200]  credit to him. But in terms of using the powers of the White House to kind of disarm his opponents,
[02:14:03.200 --> 02:14:07.160]  I don't see it. And I would love to be proven wrong.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:11.560]  So who do you like from the presidency? I don't think the presidency is going to be
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:15.040]  a very effective vector. Exactly. We don't need the EPA to tell us
[02:14:15.040 --> 02:14:18.760]  to boil our waters or filter it. We should just do it ourselves.
[02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:22.520]  Right. And you have to, I think if people are expecting the person, the White House,
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:28.320]  to be the mechanism by which this country is saved, I think that is a hopeless position
[02:14:28.320 --> 02:14:33.200]  because the system itself is too stacked against them, even if you had 50 Reagan's or whoever
[02:14:33.200 --> 02:14:35.840]  the person might like. Why do you think Trump won't come out against
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:39.720]  the shot? That's his biggest downfall with the supporters.
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:45.000]  I can't think of any times other than when he got caught with that pussy grabbing video
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.760]  where he's acknowledged wrongdoing. I don't think it's in his character. And frankly,
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:52.280]  I think as a politician, that might be a smart move. Because once you apologize, they're
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:56.720]  never going to let you forget it. So I don't blame him for not back, like walking that
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:14:59.440]  back. But like, what is he supposed to do at this point?
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:04.320]  And we, the other thing is, he is being held to standards that his opponents aren't. Kamala
[02:15:04.320 --> 02:15:08.680]  Harris explicitly said she's not trusting the Trump vaccine. And five minutes later,
[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:12.200]  once she's VP, if you don't take the shot, you shouldn't be allowed to enter the country.
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:15.200]  She's never taken a shot from Trump. Now you better take it or you can go to jail.
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.760]  Yeah. And your kids better take it too. It's, it's, it's ridiculous.
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:22.960]  Yeah. Let's, let's come back. I want to ask you how, what would you advise Trump to do
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:27.120]  to save the country? And we have Paul Watson popping in on this huge story. I'm sure you've
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:33.120]  seen this, Michael, but the head UK minister of health in these text messages, they confirm
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:37.720]  a real saying, do we release the new very scare the pants off people? This is big.
[02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:44.120]  Yes. Very. All right. Michael Malice, the white pill is the new book available everywhere.
[02:15:44.120 --> 02:15:50.360]  We'll be right back with Michael Malice and Paul Joseph Watson of summit news. Stay with
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:58.160]  us.
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:05.360]  I've got some good news. Our high quality supplements really work and we have about an 80% reorder
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:11.440]  rate with customers. That's the good news. They're amazing. The bad news is around 1%
[02:16:11.440 --> 02:16:15.320]  or a little less of our actual viewers and listeners ever go to info or store.com and
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:19.480]  ever actually buy the products. So you're missing out of these products. Plus it funds
[02:16:19.480 --> 02:16:24.720]  the info war. Think of what we've done with just 1% of our massive audience actually buying
[02:16:24.720 --> 02:16:30.000]  products. Think what would happen if those of you on the fence actually went to info
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:35.560]  war store.com and got some of these amazing products. I would recommend to Rick 95 for
[02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:39.400]  your joints, your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects. So you reorder
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:45.160]  it and see how great it is. Also, we've got the super high quality full spectrum CBD oil
[02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:49.640]  that's so good. If you're neurological systems, your brain, your joints, your bones as well
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:54.680]  or real Red Bull Plus, just go try the product, fund the info war and help us defeat the ruler
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:17:00.460]  together info war store.com. Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:05.040]  exposing the cartels in like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American
[02:17:05.040 --> 02:17:09.600]  city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals. And now you've gone to ground zero of a massive
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:13.520]  chemicals fill. Are you addicted to the danger Savannah? Have you ever considered that for
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:18.800]  a second? Now I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the truth.
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:22.520]  And again, I, you know, I have info words to thank for that. Looking back on the day,
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:27.600]  I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions. I was so grateful because you know,
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:31.920]  I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info war team. I really
[02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:37.520]  do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips because Alex's
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:42.520]  whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses
[02:17:42.520 --> 02:17:47.200]  to. So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity. I'm just addicted to telling the truth and
[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:51.560]  helping the American people. And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:53.320]  that within me early on in my career.
[02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:05.920]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023. And the world is an insane
[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:10.440]  place. World War three has already started. Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:14.360]  There's mass censorship. James O'Keefe and removed from Project Veritas. The list goes
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:17.560]  on and on of the bad things that are happening. But the good things that are happening is
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:22.560]  humanity is really accelerating. It's away. But those of us on the forefront are under
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:26.920]  more attack by the establishment than ever. That's why I'm counting on you to spread the

[02:19:54.160 --> 02:20:12.280]  down leading up frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.

[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:41.000]  And I appreciate him coming on with as busy as he is at summit dot news with the incredible
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:50.320]  100,000 plus WhatsApp text of the head health minister, Matt Hancock, talking about releasing
[02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:54.360]  a new variant. I think you release the variant literally, but you're releasing the fear and
[02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:58.040]  the scare the pants off people and how they talk about how to scare the public would make
[02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:04.640]  them submit to lockdowns following this whole script written by Fauci and Bill Gates and
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:10.600]  the UN, the WF. Paul, this is so huge. It broke Friday. The telegraph is it's it's everywhere.
[02:21:10.600 --> 02:21:15.680]  Thank God. But this is just crazy level stuff. You're there in the UK, your view on this
[02:21:15.680 --> 02:21:16.680]  situation.
[02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:23.280]  Well, it broke Friday, Alex, but this is part of a long running feature by the telegraph.
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:28.160]  Basically, one of the journalists there got hold of Matt Hancock's text messages. And
[02:21:28.160 --> 02:21:35.600]  by the way, this is a guy who before the pandemic even really set in in January 2020 told his
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:41.040]  friend that this pandemic, given that he was basically the public face of the response
[02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:46.480]  to it in the United Kingdom, would propel him into the next league, would basically
[02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:52.160]  turn him into a celebrity superstar. After the pandemic supposedly ended, or at least
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:58.320]  the restrictions were lifted, he's now become this reality TV star in the United Kingdom.
[02:21:58.320 --> 02:22:04.760]  He's basically trying to use this as a trampoline to send himself into the stratosphere as being,
[02:22:04.760 --> 02:22:10.840]  you know, the strongman, the guy that responded to COVID that saved the country. These messages
[02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:14.760]  have come out. And we kind of already knew part of this, Alex, and we in fact had the
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:21.360]  stories back in 2021, where the government advisor groups openly came out and said that
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:28.880]  they engaged in quote, unethical and totalitarian behavior right before the first lockdown,
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:36.400]  the key function that they sought to fulfill was to scare the public by grossly exaggerating
[02:22:36.400 --> 02:22:43.040]  the threat of COVID, even as far back as February, March 2020. So they knew right from the beginning
[02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:48.600]  that it wasn't as bad as we were told it was as all the laureate propaganda told us that
[02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:54.880]  it was. And this is now being confirmed with these 100,000 leaked WhatsApp messages, because
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:23:00.440]  as I just said in the intro there, he openly talks. And this, by the way, is right before
[02:23:00.440 --> 02:23:05.760]  the December 2020 lockdown, which was the second full lockdown of the country. They're
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:10.600]  struggling a bit politically. People are starting to ask questions about the rollout of the
[02:23:10.600 --> 02:23:15.600]  vaccine. They're starting to ask questions about the draconian clampdown on civil liberties
[02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:20.080]  with the lockdown. They're starting to ask questions about other political issues that
[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:26.360]  they want to distract from. So there you have Matt Hancock, the UK Health Secretary, saying
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:33.280]  that they need to deploy a new COVID variant to quote, brighten the pants off the general
[02:23:33.280 --> 02:23:38.640]  public and make sure they comply with lockdown. Now, of course, as you said, Matt Hancock's
[02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:44.440]  not there in the Wuhan lab cooking it up. They already knew the variant was coming and
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:50.040]  they deliberately politically chose the moment that they'd reveal it to the public, despite
[02:23:50.040 --> 02:23:56.080]  as some of the other text messages show, they were getting advice at the same time from
[02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:02.280]  some scientists, some researchers, including the Imperial College of London, showing them
[02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:07.160]  that the infections were actually decreasing, that this was becoming less of a problem.
[02:24:07.160 --> 02:24:12.080]  They deliberately chose to ignore that as part of what the media in this country is
[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:19.000]  calling project fear, to fear and guilt the general public into obeying lockdown by only
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:25.280]  concentrating on these more severe alarmist paranoid modeling, which of course, as we
[02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:30.080]  now know later turned out to be completely inaccurate. So every step of the way these
[02:24:30.080 --> 02:24:35.400]  leaked text messages show, they knew it wasn't as bad as they were telling the public it
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:41.640]  was. They deliberately engaged in totalitarian methods of mind control. They ignored the
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:48.080]  modeling which contradicted their public messaging. And basically they wanted to scare the public
[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:54.160]  to frighten the pants off the public into complete obedience and to shut down all dissent.
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:58.000]  And that's basically the knob of what these text messages tell us.
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:02.160]  And now the right once again, exactly right once again. So the big question I'll ask you
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:06.760]  this and Michael Malis, what needs to come next? I mean, he needs to get in trouble.
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:12.680]  And I'm not blaming the UK. I'm not an Anglo file. I'm on an Anglophobe. But clearly it
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:17.040]  was always the UK that kept announcing the new variants. It looks like whoever was advising
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:23.040]  him was quarterbacking the larger global fear. So to me, it's not what he did. It's asking
[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:28.600]  him in depositions or lawsuits, who told you to do this? Who told you about the new variant?
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:34.520]  For me, this is a very important point like he's a capo. Who is the dawn above him?
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:41.040]  Well, I think one of the prime individuals in that context will be Professor Neil Ferguson.
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:46.120]  This is the guy who provided the base modeling that convinced the prime minister of the United
[02:25:46.120 --> 02:25:51.280]  Kingdom to lock down the country. Now, of course, I've made the point before he personally
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:55.960]  took the lockdown, the first lockdown when, you know, it was deadly serious. We were being
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:26:02.600]  told a what 3.6 death rate or whatever, right at the start, potentially, he took it so seriously,
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:06.600]  Alex, that while everyone else was locked inside their houses, told they couldn't go
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:12.600]  out, visit their loved ones, funerals, see their partners, whatever he was shagging females
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:20.480]  at parties. Yeah, he was traveling back and forth across London to shag his married mistress
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:24.520]  while everyone else couldn't even see their partner if they lived in a different house.
[02:26:24.520 --> 02:26:28.960]  But again, that tell you how seriously they were taking it because they knew it wasn't
[02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:35.400]  as bad as they were. And Boris Johnson was partying. So what comes next then? I think
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:39.600]  it will lead back to Neil Ferguson. Again, he was the guy who said, we didn't think we
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:43.600]  could get away with this. We didn't think we could get away with what the Chinese were
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:48.080]  doing. But then we saw Italy doing it. And we thought we could get away with it in his
[02:26:48.080 --> 02:26:52.800]  words. So I think obviously, there's going to be this big public inquiry, it's probably
[02:26:52.800 --> 02:26:57.840]  going to be a whitewash in the UK. But again, you need to trace it back to Neil Ferguson
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:01.960]  and he links back to the WHO and not totally agree. That's why that's why I asked you an
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:07.240]  expert on this. But for me, it's such a huge deal, because it's got the tension, we already
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:12.800]  could analyze this and see they did this. But now we have the smoking gun admissions.
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:19.160]  This is gotten the public's attention. Michael Malls, this is got to scare the power structure.
[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:23.000]  I agree with you. But here's the thing I find interesting. Let's play devil's advocate.
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.920]  Let's suppose all the COVID narrative was true and that everything was warranted and
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:31.760]  so on and so forth. What this demonstrates and I think it's key is that politicians,
[02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:35.280]  when they see an incentive to make themselves look good or to increase their power, they
[02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:40.200]  will take it. They're not these disinterested public servants. They see like, whether it's
[02:27:40.200 --> 02:27:45.000]  Cuomo here, Ferguson over there or Matt Hancock, it's going to be like, this is going to make
[02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:49.840]  me look good. I get to be the hero. And they are always going to take that opportunity
[02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:54.440]  to decrease freedoms at the expense and further their own career and agenda, even if everything
[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:56.600]  they said about COVID were true, which of course is not.
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:59.320]  I agree. So anyway, you slice it, they're going to power grab.
[02:27:59.320 --> 02:28:00.320]  Right.
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:03.160]  And pat themselves in the back for it and you see it time and time again.
[02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:07.800]  Paul, do one more segment with us. We're going to go 15 minutes the next hour with our great
[02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:13.640]  host here who wrote the new book, the white pill. We're going to be talking to so many
[02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:17.280]  others as well into the next hour. Michael Malus is here. But Paul, what else do you
[02:28:17.280 --> 02:28:20.280]  want to hit next segment?
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:24.840]  Just more on these leaks. There's more information about how they plan to lock up Nigel Farage,
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:28.440]  face masks and a bunch of different stuff related to the leaks of these messages.
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:32.240]  That's right. The media is focusing on him face sucking a married woman. Hey, you didn't
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:35.840]  hurt anybody. I'm not saying it's good, but I get it. I'm a man. I don't want to hear
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:39.800]  about that. I want to hear about locking people down. I want to hear about lying to the public
[02:28:39.800 --> 02:28:45.000]  and using military level psychology to control folks. Michael Malus is here. The white pill
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:49.720]  is going to be a bestselling book. Paul Joseph Watson with us as well. One more segment and
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:59.400]  then myself and Malus will continue on. Stay with us. PJW is straight ahead.

[02:32:01.920 --> 02:32:06.200]  States government. Applying this has been found and is now in the possession of the
[02:32:06.200 --> 02:32:13.280]  army. There is a bulletin from TVF news. President Kennedy has been shot. This is a different
[02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:19.200]  time of war. The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:24.040]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States. They took the babies out of
[02:32:24.040 --> 02:32:27.880]  the incubators and left the children to die on the cold floor. It was almost as if it
[02:32:27.880 --> 02:32:35.680]  were a plan if only to hit your head. We need to go into the capital. You will always have
[02:32:35.680 --> 02:32:40.640]  conspiracy theories. They are nothing but distract. You guys censored Harvard educated
[02:32:40.640 --> 02:32:47.160]  doctors. You silenced those voices. What we wanted to do in Davos is to reset. As soon
[02:32:47.160 --> 02:32:59.360]  as we start exposing the great reset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:05.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:27.760]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government coverups. You want answers? Well, so does he. Live from
[02:33:27.760 --> 02:33:36.920]  Austin, Texas. Broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.920 --> 02:33:40.560]  Michael Malis will roll 15 minutes the next hour with me. The great Gerald Salente will
[02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:44.760]  take over, but I got to give Malis this. He's been writing his book, The White Pill, for
[02:33:44.760 --> 02:33:48.760]  two years. I saw him in New York two years ago. He was already writing. He moved here
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:52.040]  a year and a half ago. The book is done. I haven't read the book yet, but just hearing
[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:56.800]  what he's talking about is totally true from history. The White Pill is here. There are
[02:33:56.800 --> 02:34:01.360]  good people getting into the text messages of the British health minister to expose what
[02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:05.840]  a criminal he is. There's all these good people in the intelligence agencies, in corporations,
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:09.920]  in private life that aren't going to stand by and watch this. And if we just use the
[02:34:09.920 --> 02:34:15.440]  power we have now, we're going to be able to reverse so much of this. So Paul, pulling
[02:34:15.440 --> 02:34:21.960]  back from Matt Hancock, the UK health minister being totally caught, fair mongering, using
[02:34:21.960 --> 02:34:27.000]  British Ministry of Defense propaganda to quote mind control and terrorize people. Big
[02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:34.440]  picture. Fauci's being exposed for gain of function. All this news is coming out. European
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:40.880]  countries are banning the injection. Things are not going well for the New World Order
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:45.120]  here, Paul. I'm not saying we're out of the fight yet. I'm not saying we've won yet, but
[02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:49.240]  if we were in a boxing match at the sixth round of 12 rounds, I think we just knocked
[02:34:49.240 --> 02:34:52.560]  the son of a bitch out. He may get back up, but I mean, I don't want to clear a victory
[02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:56.040]  yet because humans aren't perfect. There'll be some new evil deal with, but we always
[02:34:56.040 --> 02:35:02.000]  think of tyrants historically as malice as his invincible walls, but Stalin Hitler, they're
[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:03.000]  not invincible.
[02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:08.440]  Well, now, obviously, it's always a game of brinksmanship. I think the white pill in
[02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:14.760]  terms of COVID is the fact that all these COVID fines for people who violated lockdown
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:20.360]  for going for a walk with a cup of coffee, that was one example, for walking their dogs
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:25.240]  in the remote countryside. Basically, every single fine that the government tried to impose
[02:35:25.240 --> 02:35:30.560]  on people was thrown out of court because no one paid them. They completely refused
[02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:36.200]  to pay them. You don't even need that level of resistance to upset the apple cart to derail
[02:35:36.200 --> 02:35:40.240]  their agenda. So that's what we've seen in the you said the key. We don't have to shoot
[02:35:40.240 --> 02:35:44.560]  people, which we don't want to do. We just have to stop complying.
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:48.680]  Exactly. And demonstrate that they're not they don't have the willpower to force compliance.
[02:35:48.680 --> 02:35:50.080]  That's another key.
[02:35:50.080 --> 02:35:57.680]  Exactly. And you look at Oxford, these 15 minute W E F cities, you've got a largely
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:02.840]  left wing city in Oxford, but because there's a hardcore of resistors in that town, this
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:10.000]  plan for finding people for driving into certain areas of the city is completely basically
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:14.200]  on the ropes. Now, you've got people ripping out surveillance cameras across the town of
[02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:19.160]  Oxford. We don't advocate that, but it just shows you the level of resistance and that
[02:36:19.160 --> 02:36:24.680]  it only needs to be relatively small scale. There are polls that show, for example, with
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:32.240]  this lockdown in the UK, 37% of Brits even now, which is a larger portion of the population
[02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:37.880]  than any who answer differently, say the government didn't lock down hard enough. So you've got
[02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:43.640]  to remember, they'll always be this timid, gilded, scared segment of the population.
[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:47.560]  It's at least a third of the population. As you said, the minority doesn't matter. It's
[02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:51.720]  the it's a highly animated minority that matters. And I don't believe that poll, but but absolutely
[02:36:51.720 --> 02:36:52.720]  Paul.
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:58.720]  Yeah. And again, this this leak just is really embarrassing them. And it's going to make
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:03.560]  it harder for them to try anything like this in the future, just like the narrative on
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:07.720]  masks has been completely demolished. Now, with even the New York Times basically coming
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:12.200]  out and I'm bidding again, the conspiracy theorists will write all along masks had no
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:17.040]  effect. Well, that's another question. Why do you think even CNN and New York Times propagandist
[02:37:17.040 --> 02:37:24.600]  are backpedaling? I mean, I think they sense that there's a total reversal of their propaganda.
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:29.000]  Well yeah, they call it a COVID amnesty and the rats are starting to flee the sinking
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:33.840]  ship of the narrative. But again, their main weapon is and always has been fear if they
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:39.080]  bring back a bird flu type situation, which they're now chattering about in the background,
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:43.720]  the sheer levels of fear could be used once again to induce this complete subservience
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:48.280]  within the population. But again, I think now there's enough people who will resist.
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:52.320]  It's too much of a bulwark took for them to get their agenda rammed through. So that's
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:57.120]  what COVID has given us. I agree. But they're bringing up bird flu, marburg, monkeypox, none
[02:37:57.120 --> 02:38:01.840]  of its working. Michael mouse. I'm also curious that if you ask the average blue, blue, blue
[02:38:01.840 --> 02:38:05.320]  pill person, meaning somebody takes the New York Times, they face value. Do they think
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:09.280]  the lockdowns actually slowed down the spread of COVID? Do they think the lockdowns are
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:14.360]  efficacious? And if so, why didn't they bring the lockdowns back for later variants? Like
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:17.400]  if you ask someone that simple question, I really don't even know what they'd say because
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:20.400]  they haven't been given their marching orders. Well, they're reflecting their power through
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:23.520]  the state. So then you select the power. Sure. But I'm talking with the average people. Do
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:27.400]  they think the lockdowns had a point? Do they think that this was a good idea? And if so,
[02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:31.560]  why did they bring them? Well, that's a question for both of you. We've all been vindicated.
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:36.200]  You were there three years ago. So was malice. So was I. Joe Rogan, you know, came in a little
[02:38:36.200 --> 02:38:39.640]  bit later, but he was there saying, this is a fraud. We've been vindicated. They think
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:46.600]  now Bill Mars against it. Now, you know, all these people are against it. The Russell Brands.
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:51.160]  It's a chain reaction. I mean, I'm not trying to brag. It's just, it's just a gauge. I flew
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:57.360]  international this week. I was mobbed in Mexico. I was mobbed in the US. Nothing but love.
[02:38:57.360 --> 02:39:01.800]  My food being bought, everything. We're in a restaurant. There's nothing but listeners.
[02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:05.520]  It was all like, like they got a problem. Alex Jones is getting carried around people's
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:10.720]  hands like a mosh pit. I mean, what are they going to do? And look how badly have things
[02:39:10.720 --> 02:39:14.600]  have changed where before questioning any aspect of COVID, you were completely silenced
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:18.680]  and kicked off every platform. And now not only there are no consequences for doing this,
[02:39:18.680 --> 02:39:22.760]  there's actually rewards. And this is that bandwagon effect. It's really hard when the
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:26.840]  very tiny percent of the population is saying something. When you have major entertainment
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:30.880]  and political pundits saying something and they're being rewarded for it, it becomes
[02:39:30.880 --> 02:39:34.600]  that much easier to build up. And that's where info wars comes in. We've got to say the truth
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:39.960]  up front when it's hard. Yeah. Yeah. Or wherever that small outspoken minority is going to
[02:39:39.960 --> 02:39:45.280]  be on a specific issue. Yeah. Paul closing comments on this firestorm, one of the top
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:49.280]  stories in the world, the health minister admitting it was all about power and fear
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:55.080]  and control, deploy the new variant. What happens to this criminal? Well, he needs to
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:40:00.440]  be investigated. And if it's proven that he's deliberately chosen an agenda to terrify the
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:04.880]  British public into falsely believing that this threat was bigger than it was at the
[02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:10.120]  time, then he needs to face the most severe punishment possible. But again, it disproves
[02:40:10.120 --> 02:40:15.480]  also this narrative that is still in place to this day, that they didn't know that it
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:21.520]  was unprecedented. What could happen? So they went as draconian as possible, just to be
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:27.240]  on the safe side. These messages show right from the beginning, they knew they were exaggerating
[02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:35.360]  it. The government advisors came out and said it was a weird experiment in weaponizing behavioral
[02:40:35.360 --> 02:40:42.280]  psychology and quote, mind control. They literally sound like Alex Jones. Right from the beginning,
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:46.760]  they knew they would have to vastly exaggerate the threat to make the public comply. So they
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:51.880]  knew it wasn't this great threat, that it wasn't uncharted waters. That is the next
[02:40:51.880 --> 02:40:55.200]  narrative that needs to be extinct. And by the way, during the break, you brought up
[02:40:55.200 --> 02:40:59.040]  the next point, you said it's not just 100,000 emails now being gone over. It's not just
[02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:05.040]  covered. There's a bunch of other stuff there. Yeah, well, they were told don't put the people
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:10.760]  coming out of hospital into care homes. They were all infected. Those people all died.
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:15.080]  The hospitals were completely empty. We were told that the hospitals were overflowing complete
[02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:20.200]  BS. They were about 40% empty. And that's the long term damage of lockdown is killing
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:24.080]  people who were denied those crucial medics. You were telling me during the break, other
[02:41:24.080 --> 02:41:29.320]  stuff separate from COVID that's in the text messages. Well, yeah, they were they were
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:34.160]  planning on locking up Nigel Farage to make an example of him because he went to a Trump
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:39.520]  rally, gave a speech, came back to the United Kingdom, took a photo of himself in a pub.
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:43.880]  But it was within the 14 day window where you're supposed to stay locked up and you're
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:49.520]  not allowed to go outside having travel abroad. So there's a bunch of stuff coming out.
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:56.160]  Wow. So how do you think this ends got level? Well, again, there's going to be a public
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:00.960]  inquiry and it's up to us whether that's a whitewash or whether the people who are
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:06.200]  responsible for drilling this fear and paranoia into the British public, which has caused
[02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:13.320]  massive damage, kids, masks, speech therapists saying a 300% increase in autism and speech
[02:42:13.320 --> 02:42:19.720]  impediments. You have suicides of children, which also came out in this leak, by the way,
[02:42:19.720 --> 02:42:24.200]  suicides of children as a result of lockdown. You have all these long term consequences
[02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:30.360]  that will reverberate it. Lockdown long term will kill more people than COVID ever killed.
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:34.240]  And that's what they're culpable for. That's their responsibility. And that's why they
[02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:38.720]  need to be punished. And a real crime against humanity summit.no. And they will have no
[02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:43.880]  remorse for this whatsoever. If I had to put in practices that sure, it's going to be the
[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:46.800]  right thing to short term because kids to kill themselves, I would never be able to live
[02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:51.480]  with myself. They won't lose a second of sleep. All Joseph Watson summit on news. Thank you
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:55.640]  so much, my friend. Thanks, Alex. We'll be back with Michael Malo. Stay with us. Stay
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:42:59.000]  with us. Stay with us.
[02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:03.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, the great reset in the world is a historic book that
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:08.600]  documents the global to their own words plan for our future that is a hellish future. Now
[02:43:08.600 --> 02:43:12.360]  you'll be always while they stole our books, I guess they're starting to ban them, be able
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:16.600]  to get an unsigned copy of the great reset in the war for the world at bookstores, Amazon
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:21.040]  or info or short.com. But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:26.240]  after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about 1000 left of them right now.
[02:43:26.240 --> 02:43:30.640]  So get your copy of the great reset and the war for the world, a signed copy and info
[02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:34.880]  or short.com. And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:38.960]  the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book. You'll also
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:42.320]  know that you help keep info words on the air. I'm going to thank those of you that
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:47.280]  have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies. I want to encourage all of you who
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:52.000]  haven't yet to go to info or short.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:56.640]  copies and donate to the library or give them to the local school. This is an info war.
[02:43:56.640 --> 02:43:59.680]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:07.440]  This is their big move. So yeah, you say why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the
[02:44:07.440 --> 02:44:12.720]  United States? He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the president of the United
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:21.560]  States. He's a puppet operating for the globalists. Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:44:21.560 --> 02:44:30.600]  They must be opposed. Autocrats only understand one word. No. No. No. Exactly. And that's
[02:44:30.600 --> 02:44:37.320]  why we say no to your vaccines. We say no to you shutting down our businesses. We say
[02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:42.520]  no to you taking our firearms. We say no to you censoring our free speech. We say no
[02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:47.200]  to you selling us out to the World Health Organization. We say no to you getting us into
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:53.480]  World War Three. You're right. We stand against autocrats like you Joe Biden and we say no
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:45:00.760]  and we say no to your war.
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:06.760]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane
[02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:11.240]  place. World War Three has already started. Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:15.040]  There's mass censorship. James O'Keefe and removed from Project Veritas. The list goes
[02:45:15.040 --> 02:45:18.240]  on and on of the bad things that are happening. But the good things that are happening is
[02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:23.280]  humanity is really accelerating its oasis. But those of us on the forefront are under
[02:45:23.280 --> 02:45:27.640]  more attack by the establishment than ever. That's why I'm counting on you to spread the
[02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:31.120]  word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, and to keep the broadcast on the
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:35.440]  air by getting great products at infowarsore.com. And whether it's a final signed copy, they're

[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:26.480]  Michael Malis is our guest 15 minutes to the next hour. I'm your host Alex Jones. Thank
[02:47:26.480 --> 02:47:32.680]  you for joining us. So, great interview with Paul Joseph Watson from Summit.News there.
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:36.000]  I could ask a lot of questions, but I want to get back into why you're Y-pilled, why
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:39.880]  you've written the book Y-pilled, and just wherever you want to go because you're a smart
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:40.880]  guy.
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:44.600]  You know what I want to talk to you about because we haven't talked about this before
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:47.760]  and I'm very curious because I was the one who wrote the article that kind of started
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:51.160]  this whole movement and I know you have a lot to say about this subject and it's all
[02:47:51.160 --> 02:47:55.000]  going to be all over the map. Ready? I want to hear your thoughts about this bubbling
[02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:01.200]  under concept of national divorce as a lifelong Texan. What are your thoughts on the matter?
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:06.440]  I particularly don't want to break up the Republic, but if the Republic's already dead,
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:12.040]  which it is, and as a debt it can't pay, I think having states pull out and form coalitions
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:16.560]  to exert their power is one of the purest forms of human democracy.
[02:48:16.560 --> 02:48:17.560]  And Americanism.
[02:48:17.560 --> 02:48:23.120]  And Americanism, and I think we should repeat what we did in 1776 peacefully, economically,
[02:48:23.120 --> 02:48:27.840]  and I think if Texas first seceded that they admit is one of the richest economies in the
[02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:33.160]  world by itself as a self-sufficient system from the East Coast, from the West Coast,
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:39.480]  we could dictate the surrender of the occupied areas with their election fraud, their control.
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:41.200]  So I'm 100% for national divorce.
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:46.240]  So the other big criticism I always get, and you're literally the one perfect person to
[02:48:46.240 --> 02:48:51.480]  ask about this is, this is what the globalists want. They want America broken up, divide
[02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:56.320]  and conquer, divide and conquer. No one has been fighting the globalists by that name
[02:48:56.320 --> 02:49:00.880]  more than you from for decades now. What is your answer to that criticism?
[02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:05.920]  Well, my answer is this. They want it broken up with a race war and a cultural divide in
[02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:10.520]  the country collapsing and then Latin America that they control the I'm of World Bank controlling
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:11.520]  the whole Southwest.
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:16.600]  So I say we break it up to fix it, to reconstitute it with a new Republic before they do it.
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:17.600]  It's real simple.
[02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:21.200]  What about this argument that if America breaks up that we're going to be conquered by China,
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:24.960]  it's going to be easier for China. I don't understand this argument that if Texas becomes
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:28.560]  reclaims its independence, that Texas is somehow going to be at the mercy of China.
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:34.080]  The idea that China came and run its own country, China was given most favored nation
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:37.920]  trading status, given all the rare earth minerals, given a blank check by the globalists
[02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:42.720]  that run our country to take over. As long as those deals are cut, China has no hope
[02:49:42.720 --> 02:49:46.240]  that people will take their nation back. And again, I'm going to explain it. The country's
[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:51.920]  being collapsed. It's being divided culturally. And so a divorce, I think more and more is
[02:49:51.920 --> 02:49:52.920]  the thing that's happened.
[02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:59.160]  Yeah, I'm very happy to hear you say this. It seems to me, and I want to hear your thoughts
[02:49:59.160 --> 02:50:03.240]  on this, that this is a relic of neocon Cold War propaganda because it used to be the Russians
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:05.400]  are going to invade, the Russians are going to invade, the Russians are going to invade,
[02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:10.000]  right? Cold War ends, the Soviet Union falls apart and ceases to exist. And now the argument
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:13.000]  is China's going to invade, China's going to invade, China's going to invade. Even if
[02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:16.720]  we, let's just steal man, this argument, even if we broke up into countries of 175 million
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:21.200]  people each, the idea that this would be a cakewalk for China to, and the other argument
[02:50:21.200 --> 02:50:24.800]  is, okay, well, they don't mean literally invade. They're going to invade us culturally.
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:30.040]  It's much easier now when you have Washington under the thumb and the university system
[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:31.440]  kowtowing to kind of China.
[02:50:31.440 --> 02:50:36.600]  Yeah, the confusion is exactly, we're already conquered by the new world order. And so when
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:41.880]  the founders said 1776, it wasn't to lessen the power of the people who was in force.
[02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:46.840]  So I would look for coalitions to pull out, create new compacts, and then create a new
[02:50:46.840 --> 02:50:51.000]  order, which we see in the Declaration of Independence. When the government becomes
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:55.520]  destructive with the people's freedom, it is not the star right as our duty to abolish
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:59.240]  the former forms of government and reconstitute new governments for the people.
[02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:02.880]  What about this idea, what if the Texas became a republic that we'd all starve and we wouldn't
[02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:05.280]  be able to have the lights on and we'd be begging to go crawling back?
[02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:10.280]  We have enough oil to run the whole planet for 150 years. We have the gas, we have the
[02:51:10.280 --> 02:51:14.760]  technology, we have a frickin' NASA's based here. I love Newarkers, they're great people,
[02:51:14.760 --> 02:51:18.200]  they come and they go, are you riding horses around? Yeah, we got horses and we got, you
[02:51:18.200 --> 02:51:23.920]  know, everything else. The point is, I'm not calling for a dissolution of the republic.
[02:51:23.920 --> 02:51:28.880]  It already happened. I'm calling for people to recognize it and only having the states
[02:51:28.880 --> 02:51:35.720]  pull out to then reconvene. I think the minute Texas pulled out, Oklahoma and a bunch of
[02:51:35.720 --> 02:51:41.720]  states would join us, then we'd have a coalition and an issue to get the republic reconstituted.
[02:51:41.720 --> 02:51:45.360]  It would be a straight line from here to Canada because you'd have Oklahoma, you'd have Nebraska,
[02:51:45.360 --> 02:51:49.120]  you'd have the Dakotas, like in two seconds. Exactly, and it's kind of like your wife filing
[02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:53.840]  for divorce to get your attention. Right, right. It's like, you need to stop right
[02:51:53.840 --> 02:51:59.040]  now. The other big argument is that what happens
[02:51:59.040 --> 02:52:02.880]  to people who are, you know, the thing is they're like, okay, it's not going to divide
[02:52:02.880 --> 02:52:07.120]  evenly because you're going to have blue cities and red and red rural areas, but that's kind
[02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:10.440]  of the status quo now. But we'll control the legislatures and so all that
[02:52:10.440 --> 02:52:14.960]  sorrows control will be cut off. They'll get off that sorrows ding dong real fast.
[02:52:14.960 --> 02:52:20.480]  The other argument is, I don't want to cede an inch of this republic to, you know, borders
[02:52:20.480 --> 02:52:24.640]  are already gone, currency's already being destroyed, country's already gone.
[02:52:24.640 --> 02:52:29.720]  What is the plan for retaking Portland? Like literally, there's no plan for people who
[02:52:29.720 --> 02:52:32.800]  I think it's like escape from New York. We just wall it off and they can kill each other.
[02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:36.680]  Right, but the idea that somehow like conservatives and Republicans are going to impose their
[02:52:36.680 --> 02:52:41.920]  world view on Portland is so true. No, no, no. Exactly. We can like say, okay,
[02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:45.120]  you support pedophilia and all the rest of this, you can have your own era.
[02:52:45.120 --> 02:52:49.360]  Yeah. Like there's no model for reclaiming Portland to have it be.
[02:52:49.360 --> 02:52:52.000]  Well, no, I mean, I've come to that point. Constitutional conventions aren't what's
[02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:57.200]  needed any of that. I think if Texas voted to secede and put out its
[02:52:57.200 --> 02:53:00.840]  ballistic demands, I think, I think like dominoes, it would all fall would have to
[02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:03.360]  come back in five minutes. Yeah, I don't know about five minutes, but
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:06.000]  it's certainly a step in the right. I'm in the political time span.
[02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:10.760]  Yes. And the other thing is when you are in a relationship that's not advantageous, as
[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:14.840]  soon as you throw out that you've got a foot out the door, all of a sudden the tension,
[02:53:14.840 --> 02:53:18.200]  the room changes. Let's suppose this, let's suppose I'm working for you, Alex, and I'm
[02:53:18.200 --> 02:53:22.560]  thinking about getting another job and I want to raise if I had another job offer with
[02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:27.160]  more money, if I'm in a much better position. So if you're like, Hey, I've got this offer
[02:53:27.160 --> 02:53:30.800]  for twice the money you're going to match this. Yeah, as opposed to like maybe I'm going
[02:53:30.800 --> 02:53:35.760]  to have to look for work. So if Texas puts this on the table and they're taking steps
[02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:39.480]  to actually become the Republic of Texas once again, I think things are going to change
[02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:40.480]  very quickly.
[02:53:40.480 --> 02:53:44.720]  And in the time of Eisenhower in the sixties, he said, as the cut as Texas goes, so goes
[02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:49.720]  the country. And we already got the UN and global corporations, the WF and the Chai
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:54.360]  comms dictating. How about we start dictating, right, right, that, right. That's the point.
[02:53:54.360 --> 02:53:58.560]  Why is it that the enemy class always sets the terms of debate as opposed to people who
[02:53:58.560 --> 02:54:03.160]  are hardcore patriots and patriots mean salvaging of America, what you still can. I think we
[02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:07.960]  call it the new America coalition or something along those lines, the new American states.
[02:54:07.960 --> 02:54:12.600]  And then we just have states say, the legislators have all voted to leave if you don't follow
[02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:19.160]  set demands. So there's nothing even to even lead to leave. We just we voted half the states
[02:54:19.160 --> 02:54:23.560]  are leaving. Here's our demands. And then let the feds try to come in with weapons. It
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:26.680]  doesn't have their whole military will join us. Let's see what we have. Even if it was
[02:54:26.680 --> 02:54:30.560]  just four states or three states, like there's no way I think Texas alone would break it.
[02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:34.240]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, because Texas is absolutely gigantic and the population are
[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:39.280]  very, very loyal to this lovely state that I'm delighted to be a citizen of. Well, we
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:42.440]  have to have these discussions because that's the type of bold move that would fix this.
[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:46.640]  Yeah, right. Like China wants Hong Kong and Taiwan that have been part of them for 70
[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:51.000]  years. Imagine if the heart of the country says we're gone. I mean, that that shifts
[02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:54.920]  the whole power structure. And a lot of people are thinking this is crazy. This could never
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:55:00.400]  happen. Let me tell everyone watching this. If it was 2014, and I said to you that Donald
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:04.440]  Trump is going to be the next president, you would laugh in my face and call me a lunatic
[02:55:04.440 --> 02:55:10.040]  or worse. So it is currently part of the Texas Republican Party's platform to have a referendum.
[02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:14.640]  I think is the term that they are arguing for to have Texas Declare its independence.
[02:55:14.640 --> 02:55:17.320]  And I think this kind of thing is going to happen a lot quicker than people realize.
[02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:21.520]  And I think the way to get it passed, as you said, they've got the votes legislature probably
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:26.240]  and it's on it's in the platform. So that's half the battle folks. The idea it's done
[02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:29.720]  like, oh, what are people in Philadelphia? You know, they're going to beat the British
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:34.560]  Empire. Nobody beat it. It happened. Right. So if we just put it on the table, that causes
[02:55:34.560 --> 02:55:38.560]  a whole new debate about we don't recognize this power structure. And also the amount
[02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:44.280]  of people who were for independence in 7076. It wasn't 80%. Most people were just sitting
[02:55:44.280 --> 02:55:47.440]  on the table. It wasn't even 10%. They were just happy to be like, all right, I'm just
[02:55:47.440 --> 02:55:50.840]  going to go with where the winds are going. So as soon as this is the sort of thing that
[02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:54.080]  gets momentum, things are going to get. And again, I'll be very clear, Michael, you're
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:59.200]  totally right. We have outside global corporations already dictating us. So it's not that we
[02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:03.840]  want to destroy America. We want to save it by pulling out of it to reconstitute and
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:09.560]  say we don't recognize this occupied structure. Right, right. And at a certain point you have
[02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:13.960]  to realize, listen, I know a lot of people watching the show in the military ex military.
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:18.560]  Do you it is your vision of America one in which Kamala Harris is commander in chief?
[02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:21.760]  Because that's not my vision. And let's be clear. The FBI with their informants puts
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:25.520]  up the message of militias and violence. Let's kill some cops. Let's blow up a justice
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:28.720]  department building. That's the last thing you do. It turns them into victims. We win
[02:56:28.720 --> 02:56:33.240]  by soft power by intellectual ideas. And the polls show the majority of Americans want
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:39.440]  us to see that they're done. We secede from the false thing to tell it. It's not us to
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:43.960]  reconstitute it. And look how much things have moved positively in terms of gun rights,
[02:56:43.960 --> 02:56:47.460]  but on a state by state basis. Look how much things have moved positively in terms of school
[02:56:47.460 --> 02:56:52.640]  choice. Even the Supreme Court's getting on board. Right. In just a couple of years,
[02:56:52.640 --> 02:56:56.960]  school choice has become the law of the land in state after state after state after parents
[02:56:56.960 --> 02:57:01.240]  saw what was being done in their school. So let me say it. I am calling for us now to
[02:57:01.240 --> 02:57:07.360]  follow for divorce. Yes. Great. It's a great day in America, I think, and a great day to
[02:57:07.360 --> 02:57:14.600]  be at Texan. Because again, it's not our republic. It's our husband or our wife is a globalist
[02:57:14.600 --> 02:57:19.760]  and new world order Chacom tyrant. It's not our country. You hear these stories of these
[02:57:19.760 --> 02:57:24.960]  moms taking the kids and inject them with hormones and sterilize them. And the dad has
[02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:28.400]  to sit at home and there's nothing he could do because the law is against him. That's
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:32.200]  the kind of state that America is in right now is the parallel in my opinion. And they
[02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:35.640]  go, oh, you're anti whatever. No, an adult is something I'm totally for it. Like boy
[02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:40.200]  or white, great person, lover. But the point is, don't do it to kids. Adults make their
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:44.080]  choices. And that's how Washington sees you. They see you as a guinea pig. They do not
[02:57:44.080 --> 02:57:48.960]  care about your family or freedoms in the slightest.
[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:52.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World is a historic
[02:57:52.920 --> 02:57:57.520]  book that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future that is a hellish
[02:57:57.520 --> 02:58:01.480]  future. Now you'll be always while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban
[02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:06.040]  them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores,
[02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:10.280]  Amazon or infowarstore.com. But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the
[02:58:10.280 --> 02:58:15.000]  book after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand left of them
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:20.280]  right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at
[02:58:20.280 --> 02:58:24.760]  infowarstore.com. And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on
[02:58:24.760 --> 02:58:28.840]  the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book. You'll also
[02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:32.440]  know that you help keep info wars on the air. I want to thank those of you that have gotten
[02:58:32.440 --> 02:58:37.560]  signed copies of the book or unsigned copies. But I want to encourage all of you who haven't
[02:58:37.560 --> 02:58:42.360]  yet to go to infowarstore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and
[02:58:42.360 --> 02:58:47.080]  go to the library or give them to the local school. This is an info war I'm counting on
[02:58:47.080 --> 02:58:51.720]  you and thank you for your support. I've got some good news. Our high quality supplements
[02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:57.960]  really work and we have about an 80% reorder rate with customers. That's the good news.

[02:59:47.480 --> 02:59:55.560]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order it's Alex Jones
[03:00:08.600 --> 03:00:13.640]  Two more segments left with Michael Malice, the white pills, his new book that's out.
[03:00:13.640 --> 03:00:19.480]  Malice take over. I was just very heartened to see what got you to the point because you're a
[03:00:19.480 --> 03:00:23.320]  big patriot you talk a lot about how much you love American as as do I why is my phone going
[03:00:23.320 --> 03:00:29.400]  off when I have it off. What brought you to the point where you thought okay we can't salvage
[03:00:29.400 --> 03:00:35.640]  this system through Washington? Well they're ready for a violent attack to provoke a turning in.
[03:00:35.640 --> 03:00:41.880]  Culturally the general public doesn't get it in blue states so instead of having a violent civil war
[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:47.400]  we have a cultural civil war and people use their Declaration of Independence rights to pull out
[03:00:47.400 --> 03:00:51.880]  that gives us all the peaceful leverage to demand the country back. Here's an here's an argument
[03:00:51.880 --> 03:00:56.440]  against national divorce that I do not find cogent the argument is they'll never let you leave
[03:00:56.440 --> 03:01:01.000]  they'll never let you have your own country but the thing is you don't hear about what's going on
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:06.040]  in Canada you don't hear what's going on in Mexico they've completely stopped talking and they have
[03:01:06.040 --> 03:01:11.080]  a reason to about the plight of women in Afghanistan or the Taliban that's a real problem like what's
[03:01:11.080 --> 03:01:14.760]  happening to these women is really horrible but because they don't have a narrative they just
[03:01:14.760 --> 03:01:20.200]  gave up pretending it's not happening so if America did split up and Texas gained its independence
[03:01:20.200 --> 03:01:24.520]  yeah they would care ostensibly but they wouldn't do anything about it we see this case after case
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:28.600]  where there's all these atrocities having hanging on uh having um sorry happening. Well the point
[03:01:28.600 --> 03:01:34.600]  is it brings you to the table. Right right so I'm very hopeful that this is something that's
[03:01:34.600 --> 03:01:38.600]  going to happen here's the other argument they're never going to let us leave and it's going to
[03:01:38.600 --> 03:01:43.320]  be absolutely violent it's another civil war too we had that we tried this one before do you think
[03:01:43.320 --> 03:01:48.120]  that's true that they would not be able to happen peacefully. I think we know the globals are planning
[03:01:48.120 --> 03:01:53.080]  to have a race war and a civil war to bring down the country under UN control I say we do it before
[03:01:53.080 --> 03:01:57.000]  they do it peacefully. But the thing is they're going to say well it's not going to be able to be
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:02.600]  happen peacefully if Texas declared its independence it would be invaded and decimated by Washington
[03:02:02.600 --> 03:02:06.200]  and the military do you think that's true or necessarily true? No no one put up that they
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:10.840]  have no reason to do that it's an information war they have no support to do it. Right but I mean
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:14.840]  can you can you speak to the people at home who think that like as soon as Texas secedes we would
[03:02:14.840 --> 03:02:21.560]  be just completely general Sherman? I mean I would just tell them that they're out of their minds
[03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:28.120]  because I mean look at all the factors the public's ready to do it Washington's illegitimate what is
[03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:34.600]  their excuse to invade and attack um I mean the military is awake on average I don't see it working.
[03:02:34.600 --> 03:02:40.760]  Yeah I don't see it I don't see it either and I think there's far I think it's really easier to
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:45.400]  convince the military to invade another country than to convince the military to fire it's on
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:49.240]  citizenry it's very different when you had the civil war in the south and the Confederacy which
[03:02:49.240 --> 03:02:53.160]  is really regarded as this kind of a level and evil force it's a lot easier to yeah we're not
[03:02:53.160 --> 03:02:58.920]  promoting slavery. Exactly it's easier and we're not firing Fort Sumter so it's easier to kind of
[03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:03.400]  make that kind of thing happen than to have a bunch of Texans be like all right we want our country
[03:03:03.400 --> 03:03:08.360]  it's like we're going to invade and kill people in Dallas and Houston I'm sure they would like to
[03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:12.840]  but it'd be a lot harder to. No but that's the way to non-violent do it because they're already
[03:03:12.840 --> 03:03:16.840]  planning to break the country up using race war and the rest of it why not break it up now to
[03:03:16.840 --> 03:03:22.120]  reconstitute. Yeah I'm very heartened to hear you say this and I'm curious if you're going to get
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:25.880]  pushed back from the audience because a lot of people are like no no no you're just giving up
[03:03:25.880 --> 03:03:30.600]  this is surrender this is what they want and and I don't think that's what they want I think globalism
[03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:36.200]  by definition wants one organization well they want to break it up and then reconstitute it
[03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:43.240]  but if the producing states pull out and cut the others off they've got to stop. Right right and
[03:03:43.240 --> 03:03:48.280]  the idea that Texas couldn't be its own country let alone Texas allied with several other states
[03:03:48.280 --> 03:03:52.120]  to me is just an absolute absurdity and I think that's kind of the best way to save the next
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:56.520]  generation and keep them from being brainwashed in government schools. All right you're going to host
[03:03:56.520 --> 03:04:00.600]  the last segment because I love to talk but if I talk on her up the whole time so we got a 10
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:06.360]  minute segment coming up after this one minute break Michael Malis you are going to host okay

[03:06:25.160 --> 03:06:30.440]  And I'm going to let you host this segment. I want to hear what you have to say about the book
[03:06:30.440 --> 03:06:33.560]  about what's happening. You're going to be on Joe Rogan tomorrow. That's going to be huge.
[03:06:33.560 --> 03:06:38.200]  So much more happening here in the great ATX. Michael Malus, I'm glad you came in the studio.
[03:06:38.200 --> 03:06:42.040]  Tell us about the white pill and what it means. Well there's two things I want people to take
[03:06:42.040 --> 03:06:45.160]  away from this book and just even if you don't read the book just take away in terms of looking
[03:06:45.160 --> 03:06:51.000]  at politics in general. And the first is that the Americans are very naive about the nature of evil.
[03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:55.240]  They really think evil means some with a crazy mustache who's banging their fists on the table
[03:06:55.800 --> 03:07:00.440]  who's spouting crazy nonsense but more often than not it's just some loser who's only in that
[03:07:00.440 --> 03:07:04.840]  political position because they're preaching the party line because they're being politically
[03:07:04.840 --> 03:07:09.240]  correct and they're being subservient to some kind of ruling ideology and it's very important for
[03:07:09.240 --> 03:07:16.440]  them to parrot these ideas to maintain their status quo and their stance on power which means
[03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:21.880]  that the people in power do not tend to be particularly bright or impressive. They just
[03:07:21.880 --> 03:07:27.400]  tend to be loyal to the regime. A great example of this was someone named Lysenko who was a big
[03:07:27.960 --> 03:07:32.840]  biologist in the Soviet Union. He claimed he was crossing with potatoes and tomatoes and all
[03:07:32.840 --> 03:07:38.360]  this other stuff and he opposed genetics and he opposed genetics because genetics wasn't compatible
[03:07:38.360 --> 03:07:43.160]  in his view with Marxism and because of this Soviet biology was an embarrassment and was set
[03:07:43.160 --> 03:07:49.320]  back decades and became an international laughing stock. But the point is these people A their ideas
[03:07:49.320 --> 03:07:56.520]  do not work. That is one important reason to be hopeful. If these ideologies were successful
[03:07:56.520 --> 03:08:01.640]  and created prosperity for everyone well we'd be in favor of them but the fact is they don't work
[03:08:01.640 --> 03:08:07.160]  even for the leaders in charge. They have power but that power tends to be a precarious one's
[03:08:07.160 --> 03:08:11.720]  precarious one because it's not based on honesty or on facts. So that's an important key to take
[03:08:11.720 --> 03:08:18.680]  away. Second is realize that there is nothing you can put past these people. I go after case
[03:08:18.680 --> 03:08:24.520]  after case about how they put people on trial knowing they were innocent. They made a priest
[03:08:24.520 --> 03:08:29.800]  denounce God from the pulpit just to kind of prove that religion is the opiate of the masses in
[03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:35.320]  their view. They had a story called Pavlik Morozov. The story they told to school children
[03:08:35.320 --> 03:08:40.520]  where the moral of the story is if your dad or your mom is doing something wrong you should turn
[03:08:40.520 --> 03:08:45.960]  them into the police. This is something that kids were taught in the Soviet Union for a very long
[03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:52.040]  time. So again there is nothing that these people would hold holy but the fact of the matter is
[03:08:52.040 --> 03:08:58.600]  in nation after nation they were peacefully overthrown. A great example is in East Germany
[03:08:58.600 --> 03:09:02.920]  as it's kind of alludes to what we're talking earlier with Alex and Paul Joseph Waterson
[03:09:02.920 --> 03:09:08.520]  because they would have protests in a city in East Germany called Leipzig. At first the protests
[03:09:08.520 --> 03:09:12.600]  were few and you're protesting in a country where protesting is illegal. You're like okay
[03:09:12.600 --> 03:09:17.560]  you're really sticking your neck out and in any kind of revolution or peaceful or otherwise
[03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:21.560]  it's going to be those few people who are speaking truth to power who are the ones who are putting
[03:09:21.560 --> 03:09:27.640]  their necks out. But what happens quickly is when you see that nothing happens to them others join
[03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:32.680]  in. They're like wait a minute that small group didn't get punished. If I join in I'm not going to
[03:09:32.680 --> 03:09:39.480]  get punished. And step by step these organizations build up until it becomes a tidal wave that cannot
[03:09:39.480 --> 03:09:44.120]  be overcome. This happened in East Germany at a certain point. Honecker who was the head of East
[03:09:44.120 --> 03:09:49.320]  Germany was looking at the TV screen seeing these marches of literally hundreds of thousands of people
[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:56.120]  in East Berlin chanting we are the people and chanting no violence and he's called for another
[03:09:56.120 --> 03:10:01.240]  Tiananmen Square where everyone I'm sure remembers this June 4th 1989 when they sent in the tanks
[03:10:01.240 --> 03:10:05.800]  and killed all those protesters in communist China and Tiananmen Square and the head of the
[03:10:05.800 --> 03:10:11.640]  military I believe it was looked at him and said we can't do anything. We are going to let matters
[03:10:11.640 --> 03:10:18.680]  proceed peacefully and that is the mechanism in my view for effective liberating social change.
[03:10:18.680 --> 03:10:24.600]  It's going to take a few brave patriots freedom fighters whatever term you want to call yourself
[03:10:24.600 --> 03:10:28.920]  to stick their necks out. We're already way past that point. There are so many people in this
[03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:34.360]  country with public figures and private individuals who are like this isn't working. The system is
[03:10:34.360 --> 03:10:39.720]  corrupt. These people are malevolent and after that it's much much easier for others to jump
[03:10:39.720 --> 03:10:45.560]  on the bandwagon and to make effective change. Here's an issue that's just not really political
[03:10:45.560 --> 03:10:51.400]  drug legalization. It is still illegal in every state to have marijuana dispensaries because
[03:10:51.400 --> 03:10:56.440]  it's federal crime. But what people looked around and saw is yes the crime is still on the books the
[03:10:56.440 --> 03:11:00.760]  law still in the books but they're not rating these dispensaries. They're not arresting these
[03:11:00.760 --> 03:11:06.360]  people who are selling joints or whatever it is for medical reasons and that's quickly how even
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:11.960]  though the law itself has not changed the enforcement of the law has become abolished. So it's a
[03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:18.840]  matter of defiance. It's a matter of recognizing that anything that has to be implemented comes
[03:11:18.840 --> 03:11:25.880]  at a great cost either financial or psychological or emotional to the ruling class and at a certain
[03:11:25.880 --> 03:11:31.000]  point they're going to run out of money in their bank whether it's emotional fuel or financial fuel
[03:11:31.000 --> 03:11:37.240]  and when that happens the jig is up. This is a microcosm. Joe Biden can hardly talk. They say he's
[03:11:37.240 --> 03:11:41.720]  going to be the next nominee. Why would a power structure put forward a Federman or a Joe Biden?
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:45.720]  What are they looking for? Well I think there's either there's two arguments here. One is this
[03:11:45.720 --> 03:11:53.320]  shows how powerful they are that they can either drag this carcass or this Sasquatch across the
[03:11:53.320 --> 03:11:59.800]  finish line successfully won or this just shows how weak they are that these are who's left to
[03:11:59.800 --> 03:12:04.840]  represent the regime and frankly to me it seems clearly the second one because if you look at
[03:12:04.840 --> 03:12:09.720]  like aristocrats and something called the Habsburg jaw you know the Habsburg dynasty and they were
[03:12:09.720 --> 03:12:13.960]  so inbred literally inbred that the last guy he couldn't even really close his mouth and his jaw
[03:12:13.960 --> 03:12:18.040]  was all huge and deformed. You can look this up in the internet photos of the Habsburg jaw.
[03:12:18.040 --> 03:12:24.760]  The Habsburg jaw but this what happens is these regimes they become decadent and inbred literally
[03:12:24.760 --> 03:12:29.320]  in that case but figuratively nowadays and the people who are being drawn into the power
[03:12:29.320 --> 03:12:33.720]  structure watch that if you look at FDR if you look at Woodrow Wilson these are very bright men
[03:12:33.720 --> 03:12:38.280]  these are very charismatic men these are very powerful men. Can you seriously look at the
[03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:43.640]  people in Washington today and think they're anything like these giants of the past that
[03:12:43.640 --> 03:12:49.320]  they're anything like have any amount of charisma. FDR had so many Democrats in Congress they had to
[03:12:49.320 --> 03:12:54.120]  spill over and send to the Republican seats. Can you see anyone in the Democratic Party or even
[03:12:54.760 --> 03:12:59.240]  a bad actor in the Republican Party who's able to unite the country so much behind them
[03:12:59.240 --> 03:13:03.480]  and their agenda I don't see it at all. Well that's why I think we're in the middle of the
[03:13:03.480 --> 03:13:10.440]  great awakening. Yes and I am just I think if you look at what information is accessible to us
[03:13:10.440 --> 03:13:15.720]  as average citizens in 2023 as opposed to the information that was accessible to us when you
[03:13:15.720 --> 03:13:20.360]  and I were kids it's not in day thanks to the internet thanks to social media thanks to shows
[03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:23.960]  like so they can try to censor they can try to control but it's all a rear-guard action.
[03:13:23.960 --> 03:13:27.880]  If they had Alex if they had their way you wouldn't exist if they had their way you'd be in
[03:13:27.880 --> 03:13:33.400]  solitary confinement is that not clear yes and the fact is we're having a nice lunch we're going
[03:13:33.400 --> 03:13:36.760]  to go shooting a few weeks and we're having a good time you're under a lot of pressure you're
[03:13:36.760 --> 03:13:40.840]  on a lot of stress but again they haven't been able to vanish you or silence you because we didn't
[03:13:40.840 --> 03:13:44.920]  give up because you didn't give up and because your audience continued to support you so keep
[03:13:44.920 --> 03:13:49.720]  betting on humanity keep betting on renaissance keep betting on the new enlightenment keep betting
[03:13:49.720 --> 03:13:54.600]  on the great awakening and you owe it to your kids to have hope and you owe it to your kids in my
[03:13:54.600 --> 03:14:00.920]  view to fight for a better future in a better america and to not give in to cynicism and the
[03:14:00.920 --> 03:14:06.120]  idea that good things never happened and don't count on biden or donald trump or disannas or
[03:14:06.120 --> 03:14:11.640]  anybody count ourselves right right there's no one is going to come in on a white horse and save
[03:14:11.640 --> 03:14:15.880]  you this is the delusion and this is a way to get you to give up because if you hope on this one
[03:14:15.880 --> 03:14:20.440]  politician and he disappoints you then you're going to think oh i couldn't have one to begin with no
[03:14:20.440 --> 03:14:25.480]  it was your premises that were wrong you're hoping in the wrong direction and looking for hope not
[03:14:25.480 --> 03:14:30.680]  in washington look for it in yourself so it matters is issues and sticking with us yes and
[03:14:30.680 --> 03:14:35.880]  and realizing that people in washington often get corrupted and co-opted by the system there's no
[03:14:35.880 --> 03:14:40.360]  mechanism it's even worse in britain the tories there the conservative party there are even worse
[03:14:40.360 --> 03:14:45.400]  the republican party here if you can believe it but the answer isn't the the other republican party
[03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:49.960]  the answer is to realize that washington is the problem and to take power away from washington
[03:14:49.960 --> 03:14:54.200]  not give it from one gang to the other and we're going to go shooting very soon yes it's going to
[03:14:54.200 --> 03:14:59.880]  be a lot of fun we're going to shoot up this william f buckley uh venture yes and i i did right

[03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:23.880]  just high up to their chest with a gun over their head and about 50 pounds of weight on their back
[03:38:23.880 --> 03:38:30.600]  and getting shot at so i don't want to do that lying us into war and they lied us into the
[03:38:30.600 --> 03:38:45.000]  covid war yep hand cock team engaged in a kind of quote public fear in which they spoke of how
[03:38:45.640 --> 03:38:55.960]  to utilize quote fear and guilt to make the people obey yep and they still do it
[03:38:55.960 --> 03:39:06.680]  fear lies we don't stop those russians in ukraine before you know it it's gonna be europe
[03:39:09.640 --> 03:39:17.080]  and then the whole world little lindsay graham that was the crap shooting out of his mouth
[03:39:17.080 --> 03:39:22.920]  when he went to ukraine with that other arrogant guy blooming doll from connecticut
[03:39:22.920 --> 03:39:29.320]  it yeah if we don't stop oh blooming doll arrogant lying blooming doll you said you

[03:39:58.200 --> 03:40:08.840]  going on to this hand cock guy they go on to say four days on january 10th hand cock and
[03:40:08.840 --> 03:40:15.320]  simon case the cabinet secretary and therefore the country's most powerful civil servant discussed
[03:40:15.320 --> 03:40:22.600]  more stringent measures that they could introduce they agreed that minor adjustments such as banning
[03:40:23.160 --> 03:40:24.120]  angling would be
[03:40:25.960 --> 03:40:33.560]  paradigm a galore so they decided that quote fear and or guilt must be vital tools
[03:40:35.240 --> 03:40:43.240]  they discussed making mass wearing mandatory in all settings you know why because it had a very
[03:40:43.240 --> 03:40:47.000]  visible impact these people should be
[03:40:52.520 --> 03:41:00.200]  at least put in you know and maybe the guillotine's too much but pretty close to
[03:41:02.520 --> 03:41:07.960]  every one of these arrogant clowns did exactly what this hand cock did
[03:41:07.960 --> 03:41:16.920]  did every one of them oh i forgot i forgot arrogant andy quomo that the clowns in hollywood
[03:41:17.560 --> 03:41:25.240]  gave an me too because he could be as so good he was better than hand cock yeah
[03:41:26.760 --> 03:41:34.520]  and the people obeyed and how they hate me i had a peace and freedom rally over here when
[03:41:34.520 --> 03:41:41.800]  everything was locked down boy that they hate me for doing that because all the gutless libtards
[03:41:42.440 --> 03:41:49.400]  they all love it they all love to be told what to do because they're not men and women
[03:41:49.400 --> 03:41:55.240]  they got those little clowns and that's who's running and ruining our life a gutless little

[03:52:52.440 --> 03:53:01.160]  when crashes happen you go back to our trends journal when it used to be a quarterly then it
[03:53:01.160 --> 03:53:09.800]  went to a monthly and now it's a weekly last week was over 170 pages no ads on october 1999
[03:53:09.800 --> 03:53:20.600]  the headline was dot com bust coming and i had forecast that it was going to hit by the second
[03:53:20.600 --> 03:53:30.600]  quarter of 2000 and it did in march we are at that same precipice right now
[03:53:30.600 --> 03:53:40.440]  now germany is that far away from recession they just had negative gdp growth
[03:53:42.360 --> 03:53:49.080]  the inflation numbers are well over 8 percent it was supposed to come down
[03:53:50.840 --> 03:53:57.320]  everyone's calling it stagflation a stagnant economy and rising inflation no it's not
[03:53:57.320 --> 03:54:05.080]  it's drag flation the economy is dragging down and inflation is going up
[03:54:09.800 --> 03:54:17.000]  we are headed as i say it and we're forecasting the worst socioeconomic
[03:54:17.000 --> 03:54:26.520]  collapse in modern history this is going to be worse worse than the great depression
[03:54:29.960 --> 03:54:33.160]  and the great recession that happened in 2008
[03:54:35.800 --> 03:54:42.600]  was the worst since the great depression the great recession which we in the trends journal
[03:54:42.600 --> 03:54:55.080]  had forecast would happen in 2007 we took out the domain name the panic of 08 in november of 2007
[03:54:59.400 --> 03:55:07.800]  when a little clown an arrogant arrogant arrogant arrogant another clown that was the
