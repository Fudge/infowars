[09:38.480 --> 09:43.000]  records in Indonesia and that's what course he found when he got detained by
[09:43.000 --> 09:48.040]  the police when he went to Kenya that's what Madsen is finding and of course
[09:48.040 --> 09:52.600]  Madsen is going to Indonesia he's coming here first so Madsen's also on
[09:52.600 --> 09:57.240]  this this is the real deal and this is dangerous this is dangerous I mean

[10:04.000 --> 10:10.600]  CIA Ford Foundation Rockefeller Foundation I mean they are the real deal
[10:10.600 --> 10:16.040]  this guy is a complete government manufactured creature Western intelligence
[10:16.040 --> 10:19.440]  has been caught the Russians were big on this and still are getting young
[10:19.440 --> 10:23.740]  people in countries positioning them as agents things like Kevin Costner's no
[10:23.740 --> 10:28.160]  way out that's very accurate from the Russian perspective very accurate real
[10:28.160 --> 10:32.000]  things like that are on record happening if you think the Russians are doing it
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.600]  you think the globalists that run America are doing it Obama is a totally
[10:36.600 --> 10:40.880]  compromised not even blackmailed you don't have to blackmail him he is their
[10:40.880 --> 10:45.400]  creation trained from a baby and and the evidence is all there it's legion
[10:45.400 --> 10:50.360]  Webster Griffin Tarpley really we by the way sell these books I'm not pooping
[10:50.360 --> 10:54.240]  tarpleys I'm not pooping Jerome our course he
[10:54.240 --> 10:57.840]  Dr. Corsi's book but we've interviewed Corsi we know a lot of what's in the
[10:57.840 --> 11:02.080]  book and drudges got a boil down on it and it's he is respected and he's doing
[11:02.080 --> 11:05.880]  original research that's great but Webster Griffin Tarpley a year before
[11:05.880 --> 11:10.320]  Obama got elected started writing his barrage Obama the unauthorized
[11:10.320 --> 11:16.160]  biography and it's got everything in it everything that's since come out of
[11:16.160 --> 11:19.400]  course he wrote the original George Herbert Walker Bush the unauthorized
[11:19.400 --> 11:22.920]  biography those are all available at info wars.com I should have you want to
[11:22.920 --> 11:26.960]  support us and Tarpley and then he wrote another subsequent book about Obama's
[11:26.960 --> 11:29.920]  criminal activities right as he got elected predicting what he would do and
[11:29.920 --> 11:33.640]  we put a lot of that in my film the seminal film seen more than 30 million
[11:33.640 --> 11:38.360]  times online the Obama deception now more pertinent than ever but we're gonna
[11:38.360 --> 11:47.840]  be going over that today also Donald Trump is running around getting in big
[11:47.840 --> 11:54.000]  arguments about the birth certificate issue so we're going to be going over
[11:54.000 --> 11:59.800]  that report Cuba lays the foundation for a new leader that's a big deal cesium
[11:59.800 --> 12:04.600]  137 threat grows while corporate media remains mute the levels are growing up
[12:04.600 --> 12:08.520]  and up and up and up in North America and the feds aren't releasing numbers
[12:08.520 --> 12:14.480]  states are releasing numbers 181 times for one isotope then 300 plus then 500
[12:14.480 --> 12:17.600]  plus because it's just building up now the Japanese government a few weeks ago
[12:17.600 --> 12:21.560]  said it may go for months then six months then not in nine months now they're
[12:21.560 --> 12:26.560]  saying maybe years that five of the six reactors are just gonna smoke and
[12:26.560 --> 12:33.880]  continue to melt down and burn and bell chow radioactive death at 7.5 million
[12:33.880 --> 12:40.800]  times ABC News reported three weeks ago normal levels 7.5 million Washington
[12:40.800 --> 12:46.080]  Post interviewed radiation specialist who said five hours at the level that it
[12:46.080 --> 12:49.920]  was being released in just one measurement Fukushima would roughly kill
[12:49.920 --> 12:53.160]  half the people that came in contact with it within a month the rest will be
[12:53.160 --> 12:58.000]  dead within a few years burnt effects off the charts guaranteed from examples
[12:58.000 --> 13:02.600]  we've seen like Chernobyl large areas of Japan unlivable but they're still just
[13:02.600 --> 13:07.400]  gonna live there and die so this is a huge deal and now it's just not even on
[13:07.400 --> 13:11.800]  the back burner it's just faded off now that were five plus weeks into it it's
[13:11.800 --> 13:16.440]  just faded off into obscurity just like Haiti and the tsunami or the tsunami in
[13:16.440 --> 13:21.720]  2005 humans tend to muddle through things and the globalists know this so
[13:21.720 --> 13:26.080]  they can get away with bloody murder and nobody'll get in trouble general
[13:26.080 --> 13:29.160]  electric even though their own engineers quit when these were built saying
[13:29.160 --> 13:33.720]  they were dangerous they're not gonna get in trouble in fact they run the
[13:33.720 --> 13:38.120]  White House they don't get they don't have to pay taxes nothing so it's how
[13:38.120 --> 13:41.840]  it works and they're openly funding through George Soros and others the
[13:41.840 --> 13:45.040]  groups pushing to rob what's left of the middle class that won't even pay for a
[13:45.040 --> 13:49.280]  few months of government operation but their enemy will be gone and the giant
[13:49.280 --> 13:52.840]  blue collar masses out there on average I've seen the polls saying slit the
[13:52.840 --> 13:56.760]  throat of the middle class and then they won't be there anymore to get their
[13:56.760 --> 14:00.520]  haircut by him or get their car fixed by him or go to the golf course and be
[14:00.520 --> 14:04.680]  caddied for them or buy clothes or go to their restaurant but that's what you
[14:04.680 --> 14:08.920]  want what you get you want to look like to do in the third world I mean the
[14:08.920 --> 14:13.000]  globalists went into Argentina the old saying as rich as in Argentina until
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.800]  about 80 years ago Argentina was more wealthy than the US per capita back
[14:17.800 --> 14:21.840]  per capita the wealthiest country in the world for the average citizen except
[14:21.840 --> 14:27.360]  for Switzerland and of course Switzerland low taxes free market handing out
[14:27.360 --> 14:31.000]  machine guns and hang grenades to every man and woman giant underground bases
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.840]  for the entire population and a total republic that our founders actually
[14:35.840 --> 14:39.640]  modeled us after Switzerland and the old system they had in the Netherlands
[14:39.640 --> 14:44.280]  that's now gone then the Greeks were told we're model after the Greeks it ain't
[14:44.280 --> 14:48.760]  true we're modeled after the Swiss in the Dutch go read what the founders said
[14:48.760 --> 14:53.320]  then go research what they've got oh you go back 300 400 years ago the Dutch
[14:53.320 --> 14:58.040]  would get robbed by pirates on their big wealthy shipyard and trade centers so
[14:58.040 --> 15:03.320]  they just organized local militias with their own cannons and muskets and
[15:03.320 --> 15:08.120]  trained them and part of working in the shipyards are in the dykes or in those
[15:08.120 --> 15:13.400]  loaders at those warehouses was you had to be ready to be called up by the local
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.600]  private militia and that and people that had houses on the coast they cut out big
[15:17.600 --> 15:22.040]  walls put cannons in of course they've taken that away from the Dutch now but
[15:22.040 --> 15:25.040]  the Swiss still have it but you really want to study it the Swiss have the
[15:25.040 --> 15:28.560]  Dutch model and then we've got the Swiss model but again let's not actually
[15:28.560 --> 15:32.600]  know history let's not be as rich as a Swiss let's not be as rich as an
[15:32.600 --> 15:37.000]  Argentine all the Argentinians they let the bankers come in in the 70s they
[15:37.000 --> 15:41.320]  had a coup and they rounded up and killed tens of thousands arrested hundreds of
[15:41.320 --> 15:45.280]  thousands Pinochet took over September 11th you pull up the date I forget the
[15:45.280 --> 15:50.080]  exact year pull that up for me please and Henry Kissinger helped back all that
[15:50.080 --> 15:55.040]  and then they robbed everybody and then of course 2000 they did the same thing
[15:55.040 --> 15:58.420]  again they they got them to dollarize their currency and they imploded it
[15:58.420 --> 16:02.320]  overnight well just like we're entering and then the whole economy falls apart
[16:02.320 --> 16:07.040]  and the bankers can come in and take over alright now I'm ranting I'm actually
[16:07.040 --> 16:13.560]  ranting now let me just never been successful doing this let's see if I
[16:13.560 --> 16:18.800]  can do it right now let me just read to you randomly the stacks well I mean the
[16:18.800 --> 16:22.600]  stacks all have their basic information but but just the stacks because I don't
[16:22.600 --> 16:27.280]  even know where to go first I actually do but okay cops use mobile scanners to
[16:27.280 --> 16:32.400]  steal cell phone data from innocent Americans and the system they admit hacks
[16:32.400 --> 16:36.840]  your phone when the cop pulls you over they've got a machine and I told you
[16:36.840 --> 16:40.000]  this years ago is what the Google trucks do they're now under Homeland Security

[24:19.360 --> 24:25.640]  detail but let me just start getting into the headlines now Reverend L. Sharpton
[24:25.640 --> 24:29.480]  joins President Obama's immigration reform effort that means stirring up the
[24:29.480 --> 24:32.720]  giant army of foreigners that have been taught to hate America to be used as a
[24:32.720 --> 24:35.800]  political weapon for the banksters to make sure the middle class is
[24:35.800 --> 24:41.000]  destroyed the banksters always have the communist hordes working for them
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.440]  continuing I team NASA losing large amounts of high-tech equipment massive
[24:45.440 --> 24:50.280]  theft going on well when the air traffic controllers aren't watching movies
[24:50.280 --> 24:52.280]  are sleeping I mean this is government what do you expect
[24:52.280 --> 24:58.000]  sheriff faces meth charge in state ravaged by drug make it legal and then
[24:58.000 --> 25:01.120]  people won't want to use it every study shows and the cops won't be corrupt
[25:01.120 --> 25:06.760]  anymore but they first got the cops under prohibition accustomed to something
[25:06.760 --> 25:09.560]  being illegal that everybody wanted and they could feel good about getting paid
[25:09.560 --> 25:12.920]  off about people being able to have a drink so right after they lost
[25:12.920 --> 25:15.920]  prohibition of alcohol they made the drugs illegal that you could buy at the
[25:15.920 --> 25:23.840]  corner store and then of course drug use exploded upside issue continuing here
[25:23.840 --> 25:29.760]  Libyan rebels will receive 25 million from the US and they're calling it non
[25:29.760 --> 25:34.720]  lethal aid yes the bombs dropping the weapons being shipped in by the US and
[25:34.720 --> 25:38.600]  England since before this started the special forces on the ground lazing
[25:38.600 --> 25:44.480]  targets it's non-violent and this is not a war Arab springs setbacks in the
[25:44.480 --> 25:49.200]  shadow of complicated US Saudi alliance the Saudis are beginning to panic and
[25:49.200 --> 25:52.120]  realize they're being double-crossed left your tarp is gonna break that down
[25:52.120 --> 25:57.880]  for us at the beginning of the next hour that's just some of the news that we
[25:57.880 --> 26:03.920]  have on that front France vows to step up airstrikes in Libya because their
[26:03.920 --> 26:08.560]  darling little rebels have been failing now for many many weeks and their attacks
[26:08.560 --> 26:13.760]  also officials again to give Libyan rebels non lethal aid there's the actual
[26:13.760 --> 26:19.520]  headline from the Associated Press Syria lifts emergency law sits new curbs on
[26:19.520 --> 26:25.040]  protest the media is decrying it financial times of London says anger as a
[26:25.040 --> 26:29.760]  sod curbs right to protest but England itself has banned the right to protest
[26:29.760 --> 26:34.200]  unless you get a special permit and then even when you do one poor guy at the G
[26:34.200 --> 26:38.560]  20 was trying to deliver newspapers to a fight you know to a 7-eleven type store
[26:38.560 --> 26:43.200]  and the cops beating to death and then covered it up and then later admitted it
[26:43.200 --> 26:47.520]  another key article here from prison planet calm Libyan rebels fighting the
[26:47.520 --> 26:53.160]  globalist war and then something that does irritate me about Islamic countries
[26:53.160 --> 26:58.480]  I will say is a bad sign something I don't like about Islam and this is
[26:58.480 --> 27:04.400]  actually true from my research Iran is moving to try to ban dogs and harass
[27:04.400 --> 27:14.360]  dog owners and you know what I'll keep my dogs thank you very much and that's
[27:14.360 --> 27:20.400]  all I have to say the latest enemies of Iran dogs and their owners now that
[27:20.400 --> 27:24.440]  doesn't mean Iran should be bombed into the Stone Age you know the globalist
[27:24.440 --> 27:28.760]  put poison in our water and the globalist want to sterilize us the Iranian
[27:28.760 --> 27:33.400]  control freaks I just don't want you to have a dog much the past decade that by
[27:33.400 --> 27:36.040]  the way the communists Chinese don't like it either they're trying to make
[27:36.040 --> 27:40.480]  Chinese give up their dogs I guess because Mao Zedong's favorite dish was
[27:40.480 --> 27:44.360]  boiled dog I'm not joking the Chinese astronauts to quote keep their energy up
[27:44.360 --> 27:49.560]  eat dog don't believe me guys Google Chinese astronauts eat dog to keep their
[27:49.560 --> 27:54.120]  energy up I believe it's BBC shows them eating dog for much of the past decade
[27:54.120 --> 27:57.880]  the Iranian government has tolerated what considers a particularly depraved
[27:57.880 --> 28:05.800]  and unislamic vice the keeping of pet dogs well okay I'll not be joining your
[28:05.800 --> 28:11.160]  club anytime soon stay away from my dogs I wonder what Muslims think about this
[28:11.160 --> 28:16.880]  I mean dogs are dirty and evil really all the big studies show the keeping of
[28:16.880 --> 28:21.360]  dogs increases your immune system because it's a zoological buffer and
[28:21.360 --> 28:26.240]  also relaxes the heart and it is just a great thing I'm gonna keep my French
[28:26.240 --> 28:30.680]  Bulldog in Chihuahua and I'm going to hug them and I'm gonna pat them on the
[28:30.680 --> 28:34.920]  head and they're gonna snuggle me while I sit there at the computer okay
[28:34.920 --> 28:38.600]  period not taking them sorry in fact we'll put it but and by the way the
[28:38.600 --> 28:42.680]  communists Chinese you're not gonna eat my dogs either and folks in Mexico you're
[28:42.680 --> 28:46.320]  not getting my dogs for taco meat a dog oh believe me I've been in southern
[28:46.320 --> 28:49.000]  Mexico you go to the local grocery stores they have dogs and cats very
[28:49.000 --> 28:54.560]  delicious dogs on the menu for Chinese astronauts China's first man in space as
[28:54.560 --> 29:00.520]  of the Chinese astronauts eat dog meal dog meat to keep the strength up as they
[29:00.520 --> 29:04.240]  orbit around the earth London Telegraph look how healthy it looks from eating
[29:04.240 --> 29:10.160]  dog my point about the dog's statement is I see the Nazis is having a depraved
[29:10.160 --> 29:14.920]  wicked culture that I don't want to be part of I see the Aztecs is having a
[29:14.920 --> 29:18.080]  depraved wicked culture that I wouldn't want to be part of but the globalists
[29:18.080 --> 29:21.120]  tell you're not allowed to make a cultural statement about what culture is
[29:21.120 --> 29:25.600]  superior or certain areas of a culture more superior than others some cultures
[29:25.600 --> 29:29.600]  are varied that have things I like things I don't like but of course you've
[29:29.600 --> 29:33.360]  got to make a moral judgment about a culture the globalists just don't want
[29:33.360 --> 29:37.600]  you to have a decision or to have a view so they can tell you what to think well
[29:37.600 --> 29:46.320]  I'll keep my 1776 red-blooded dog owning gun owning red meat eating culture you
[29:46.320 --> 29:53.440]  know fast cars you name it I'll keep it we're on the March the Empire's on the

[39:45.200 --> 39:53.320]  lisping calm NPR voices to soothe you like the snake in the jungle book who
[39:53.320 --> 39:58.320]  talks very sweetly and and quietly and tries to hypnotize you while his eyes
[39:58.320 --> 40:02.640]  swirl I remember when I first really woke up to this when I went to a smart
[40:02.640 --> 40:08.120]  growth conference in 1997 in Austin I know Mike Hansen's got those videos from
[40:08.120 --> 40:12.560]  the old TV show he's got to dig those out and get it up on his YouTube archive
[40:12.560 --> 40:15.760]  channel it's most the really powerful stuff hadn't been uploaded yet or I
[40:15.760 --> 40:20.920]  don't know they can find it but I go to that event and it's thousands of city
[40:20.920 --> 40:28.160]  council people mayors from all over the country banking heads former Dallas
[40:28.160 --> 40:32.720]  Cowboys you know all these people and they're up there on the podiums at the
[40:32.720 --> 40:37.480]  Austin Convention Center saying this is a business we're gonna raise carbon taxes
[40:37.480 --> 40:42.960]  we're gonna take people's property we're only the insiders are gonna have
[40:42.960 --> 40:48.320]  access to the property and it's gonna be awesome and I would go to them and I
[40:48.320 --> 40:50.960]  even Michael Dell was there I talked to him there's an interview of Michael Dell
[40:50.960 --> 40:54.640]  of Dell computer and I said this is a scam this is a fraud they would all
[40:54.640 --> 41:02.000]  laugh at me and arrogantly say you bet it is and the Dallas Cowboy got in my
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.120]  face and shoved me out of the way and it was just a group of hardcore savage
[41:07.120 --> 41:11.440]  people that knew exactly what they were doing with the gender 21 and it was a
[41:11.440 --> 41:18.640]  ship of hardcore pirates high-fiving laughing it was not about bunnies and
[41:18.640 --> 41:25.360]  bees and flowers and the earth it was we're coming in we've got control we're
[41:25.360 --> 41:30.680]  taking over this nation and they had the heads of three of the big six banks up
[41:30.680 --> 41:36.200]  there admitting I mean it was like that scene in they live where they go
[41:36.200 --> 41:40.120]  underground and the aliens that are cloaked as humans are saying welcome
[41:40.120 --> 41:44.760]  human power elite in only one short decade we've consolidated power and
[41:44.760 --> 41:49.600]  bankrupted most the slaves and we're taking over good job the human power
[41:49.600 --> 41:55.000]  elite I mean I was at this meeting I got footage of them and I was like whoa
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.600]  they are they know what they're doing well of course they did when they go out
[41:59.600 --> 42:04.120]  to some 2000 acre ranch jack the taxes up force them to sell for pennies on the
[42:04.120 --> 42:07.960]  dollar two years later take the environmental regs off build shopping
[42:07.960 --> 42:14.680]  malls on it I mean they got former mayors who own the banks that only the
[42:14.680 --> 42:24.920]  money can go through I mean it it's just so hardcore it's off the charts and
[42:24.920 --> 42:30.240]  people better get wise to this you think the government is wanting to fix the
[42:30.240 --> 42:34.560]  budget they want you bankrupt they made the money up out of nothing for every
[42:34.560 --> 42:41.360]  dollar that's created a dollar of debt is created to them and so they're giving
[42:41.360 --> 42:45.000]  you slave training right now that they're gonna stick their hands down your
[42:45.000 --> 42:49.920]  pants they're gonna tell you you can't pack your child's lunch they're gonna
[42:49.920 --> 42:52.360]  go they're going in all over the country they've already done this in the
[42:52.360 --> 42:57.080]  public schools and even colleges they're now going into the private schools the
[42:57.080 --> 43:00.800]  private day camps that have been established for in some cases one of
[43:00.800 --> 43:03.800]  the I was reading about in upstate New York's over a hundred years old they're
[43:03.800 --> 43:10.880]  saying it's over no more no more capture the flag no more nothing because we
[43:10.880 --> 43:14.600]  care about you that's why I've made a video that I I've got to say is the
[43:14.600 --> 43:18.480]  most positive response we've ever seen to a video couple times a year I do a
[43:18.480 --> 43:24.880]  satire video a joke video illustrating absurdity by being absurd and when you
[43:24.880 --> 43:28.880]  watch this 13-minute video up at info wars.com and prison planet.com and we'll
[43:28.880 --> 43:39.200]  we'll put it up on screen please when you watch this video and it's titled
[43:39.200 --> 43:46.320]  censored video Alex Jones joins the New World Order that's the text in the
[43:46.320 --> 43:50.200]  headline and again we'll we'll show you the news article in the video on screen
[43:50.200 --> 43:54.880]  for prison planet dot TV viewers I'm gonna have Watson tomorrow write an
[43:54.880 --> 44:01.240]  article explaining that this video looks hardcore looks bizarre as I yell at my
[44:01.240 --> 44:07.080]  employees in a mock satire video as I yell at the crew and tell them that
[44:07.080 --> 44:10.840]  they're my slaves and that they have to buy their food at the company store that
[44:10.840 --> 44:14.680]  this has gone on in many cultures for thousands of years and this is now
[44:14.680 --> 44:18.720]  happening in New York and Illinois and other areas and expanding out nationwide
[44:18.720 --> 44:23.320]  so this video needs to go mega viral and of course it is satires we have the
[44:23.320 --> 44:28.720]  headline censored video Alex joined Alex Jones joins the New World Order we
[44:28.720 --> 44:32.560]  could give it the headline to alternate you know the nanny state gone wild but
[44:32.560 --> 44:39.320]  as crazy and off the walls this seems this is what they're doing this is what
[44:39.320 --> 44:43.960]  the system is doing trying to break our will and train us to accept all of this
[44:43.960 --> 44:52.040]  so again censored video Alex Jones joins the New World Order and I just came
[44:52.040 --> 44:58.480]  with the idea last Friday we shot it in about 45 minutes they edited it on Monday
[44:58.480 --> 45:04.320]  and Tuesday and we released it last night and Rob do edited it and Aaron Dyke
[45:04.320 --> 45:07.520]  shot video with him they did a great job so did the crew that wanted to take
[45:07.520 --> 45:10.440]  part in it you don't see a lot of the crew some of the crew obviously don't
[45:10.440 --> 45:13.080]  want to be on camera but then anybody that wanted to be on camera here in our
[45:13.080 --> 45:17.600]  crew she also get a behind-the-scenes look at the office and the crew but
[45:17.600 --> 45:21.920]  again you can check out the video at info wars.com and prison planet.com and I
[45:21.920 --> 45:26.440]  need to get Watson or Kurt or Steve or one of our great writers to do a write
[45:26.440 --> 45:34.840]  up on this so that people understand when they watch the video some are going
[45:34.840 --> 45:37.520]  well this is ridiculous satire it's still very funny but they're going this
[45:37.520 --> 45:42.920]  will never happen this is already happening and more and more so I want
[45:42.920 --> 45:49.560]  to do a report on kind of the nanny state for dummies and that that it's not a
[45:49.560 --> 45:54.560]  bunch of limp-wristed liberals that want to keep you safe this is prisoner
[45:54.560 --> 45:59.760]  social engineering control in their own admissions and I've got all the top
[45:59.760 --> 46:03.560]  globalists going back to the 1920s when they said we're going to domesticate
[46:03.560 --> 46:08.040]  people in the name of their own good forced inoculations food and water
[46:08.040 --> 46:11.840]  will be poisoned with things that make people more passive will break up the
[46:11.840 --> 46:15.440]  family in the name of safety will incorporeal punishment so kids will be
[46:15.440 --> 46:21.120]  badly behaved only the state will be allowed to meet out in justice i.e.
[46:21.120 --> 46:26.640]  tasers and the rest of it I mean it's all laid out and I want to really more
[46:26.640 --> 46:30.440]  and more go after this nanny state because it's now going into full gallop
[46:30.440 --> 46:36.040]  now we come back from break cops use mobile scanner to steal cell phone data
[46:36.040 --> 46:39.800]  from innocent Americans and this has been going on nationwide not just in
[46:39.800 --> 46:43.440]  Michigan and I want to break down what this really means after the break it is
[46:43.440 --> 46:46.600]  such a big deal we've got this attitude from all the cops shows we'll just
[46:46.600 --> 46:49.960]  support what cops do well does that mean support the illegal things they're
[46:49.960 --> 46:54.240]  told to do this is illegal but they're just setting the precedent to do it just
[46:54.240 --> 46:57.240]  like it's illegal for TSA to stick their hands down your pants I mean it's
[46:57.240 --> 47:02.640]  illegal federal and state law I've had the DA's on I've had the constitutional
[47:02.640 --> 47:07.720]  scholars on I've had former congressman on current congressman lawyers like Bob
[47:07.720 --> 47:13.560]  Barr it is illegal on its face they don't care it's illegal to not test the
[47:13.560 --> 47:16.960]  radiation being released every month at the airports they they don't test them
[47:16.960 --> 47:23.520]  they don't care they do what they want that's what Terry's all about most what
[47:23.520 --> 47:27.080]  the Nazis did wasn't on the books in Germany they just did it all right I
[47:27.080 --> 47:30.640]  wanted to briefly just for three minutes quickly because Ted's got to go to a
[47:30.640 --> 47:34.200]  very exciting meeting about getting us on a big syndicated chain of radio
[47:34.200 --> 47:37.440]  stations wow exciting stuff happening Ted's got to leave here in just a few
[47:37.440 --> 47:41.840]  minutes but just in the next three minutes Ted gold's still up above 1500
[47:41.840 --> 47:46.680]  silver surging you bought gold and silver a few months ago when it was 50 60
[47:46.680 --> 47:50.160]  bucks less you're about to run out of that you'll still keep running up and
[47:50.160 --> 47:53.320]  the new stuff you buy will still be lower than where it goes in the future the
[47:53.320 --> 47:57.240]  evidence shows but I wanted to briefly have you on with an economic snapshot of
[47:57.240 --> 48:02.000]  what's happening and also the out of this world deals and folks I dare you to
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.880]  find silver at lower prices gold at lower prices in these radio specials Ted
[48:05.880 --> 48:11.320]  tell us what you got yeah 1507 is where gold is 45 43 silver it's up about a
[48:11.320 --> 48:15.360]  dollar and a half since we were lost on there just yesterday right now
[48:15.360 --> 48:20.080]  presently I'm holding the price on those videos 115 dollars I will be marking
[48:20.080 --> 48:23.920]  them up higher tonight because I have to so if you want to get on that silver
[48:23.920 --> 48:28.920]  dollar video deal get it you already went up five bucks a week ago now
[48:28.920 --> 48:34.080]  silver's run up so much more three three silver dollars over $120 value and
[48:34.080 --> 48:37.720]  that's low in the market free shipping three of my best-selling films so that's
[48:37.720 --> 48:45.400]  about 70 to $5 or so off I mean you cannot beat the deal 800 686 2237
[48:45.400 --> 48:51.400]  800 686 237 what about the creation from Jekyll Island a silver dollar and
[48:51.400 --> 48:54.640]  that book how much is that yeah that's another one 41 dollars I delivered the
[48:54.640 --> 48:58.000]  creature went from Jekyll Island book and you get a silver dollar with it and
[48:58.000 --> 49:02.840]  that my you know getting that book is just so important so that's about a
[49:02.840 --> 49:07.880]  $65 value because the books 20 plus bucks in stores you're paying 13 14 bucks
[49:07.880 --> 49:12.480]  for it that's at cost on the silver dollar for you so then the free book and
[49:12.480 --> 49:15.320]  the free shipping it's a free book and free shipping when you get the silver
[49:15.320 --> 49:19.560]  dollar as a loss leader to introduce you to gold and this and silver and to
[49:19.560 --> 49:25.760]  introduce you to this information ask about the radio specials 800 686 2237
[49:25.760 --> 49:31.280]  I only promote what I believe in and I believe that food prices would go up
[49:31.280 --> 49:35.240]  they have I believe that oil prices would go up they have I believe gold as
[49:35.240 --> 49:40.240]  gold and silver would go up they have silvers up five six times golds more

[50:59.000 --> 51:06.920]  illegally Alex Jones here with key information the US government is a
[51:06.920 --> 51:10.920]  Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of
[51:10.920 --> 51:15.280]  government bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a
[51:15.280 --> 51:20.440]  seller of US bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing
[51:20.440 --> 51:24.160]  China by calling them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is
[51:24.160 --> 51:28.120]  already buying about 70% of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer
[51:28.120 --> 51:32.440]  left of US Treasuries our friends at the National Inflation Association believe
[51:32.440 --> 51:36.160]  that the US dollar will soon become worthless and Americans will see the

[53:03.480 --> 53:07.400]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that
[53:07.400 --> 53:11.040]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[53:11.040 --> 53:14.440]  gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this
[53:14.440 --> 53:18.200]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at
[53:18.200 --> 53:22.680]  solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they

[53:56.640 --> 54:00.640]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[54:00.640 --> 54:14.560]  you know that the Supreme Court is hearing the case of the FBI putting GPS
[54:14.560 --> 54:20.120]  tracker boxes on the bottoms of people's cars and the media is like oh they've got
[54:20.120 --> 54:23.800]  to stop them they might be cocaine dealers we don't need warrants to do
[54:23.800 --> 54:27.360]  this to you meanwhile the big mega banks on record launder almost all the drug
[54:27.360 --> 54:32.360]  money the CIA is constantly being caught in Miami and other states Esquire's
[54:32.360 --> 54:36.480]  written articles about police pull up to do a drug bust it's a jet full of cocaine
[54:36.480 --> 54:40.920]  heroin you name it and they just flash CIA badges and that are ordered by the
[54:40.920 --> 54:44.920]  state police who are under their control the FBI to release them and they've caught
[54:44.920 --> 54:48.120]  18 wheelers in Texas full of three tons of cocaine they're ordered to release
[54:48.120 --> 54:51.400]  them my point is it's all a stink and fraud let's just be honest about it
[54:51.400 --> 54:56.880]  okay now that said all over the country and I told you about this years ago
[54:56.880 --> 55:01.520]  because it's in the specs of the cell phones and this stuff is leaked out first
[55:01.520 --> 55:06.160]  place I saw it was 2003 in the Green Bay paper with the governor at a federal
[55:06.160 --> 55:10.400]  threat fusion center showing how they could type in your name with your
[55:10.400 --> 55:14.360]  social security number or driver's license and then instantly pull up where
[55:14.360 --> 55:19.120]  you were real time via your cell phone off of GPS triangulation the cell phone
[55:19.120 --> 55:24.320]  doesn't have GPS the cell towers triangulated they have GPS now continuing
[55:24.320 --> 55:29.080]  with this information Paul Joseph Watson has the article on it cops use
[55:29.080 --> 55:33.800]  mobile scanner to steal cell phone data from innocent Americans and this is
[55:33.800 --> 55:41.240]  also at CBS news CNET news ACLU Michigan cops stealing driver's phone data and
[55:41.240 --> 55:45.360]  when they pull you over they have wireless systems they also have a system
[55:45.360 --> 55:51.800]  where they can plug it in and this is the whole excuse nationwide is to see if
[55:51.800 --> 55:56.000]  you've been texting just like they have federal grants to make them take blood
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.600]  from you at checkpoints now it's all about them getting into your body getting
[55:59.600 --> 56:06.280]  into your laptops the Homeland Security TSA is now taking for years laptops and
[56:06.280 --> 56:11.040]  cell phones and downloading the data no judge no jury they're gonna radiate you
[56:11.040 --> 56:13.880]  they're gonna put their hands down your pants your children's pants and they're
[56:13.880 --> 56:17.240]  gonna steal your data well now the police are being trained to do this but
[56:17.240 --> 56:20.800]  they also have wireless systems that grab it and that's what Google got caught in
[56:20.800 --> 56:25.840]  Europe doing and now they announced what two months ago that oh the government's
[56:25.840 --> 56:31.960]  going to provide wireless internet to the public over the fleet of postal
[56:31.960 --> 56:36.600]  service vehicles and oh yeah they'll also monitor things with it and they'll
[56:36.600 --> 56:40.720]  have the same mast on them like Google stealing your data and it goes on the
[56:40.720 --> 56:44.240]  Michigan State police have started using handheld machines called extraction
[56:44.240 --> 56:47.760]  devices to download personal information from motorists they pull over even if
[56:47.760 --> 56:51.240]  they're not suspected of any crime now imagine in America I'm pulling you over
[56:51.240 --> 56:54.400]  for speeding give me your cell phone I'm plugging it in and then they download
[56:54.400 --> 56:58.380]  what's on it with no warrant and it immediately cracks the code gets past
[56:58.380 --> 57:05.240]  codes photos phone list and when the ACLU did a four-year request to get this
[57:05.240 --> 57:09.520]  they slammed them back with a $500,000 plus dollar bill claiming that's how
[57:09.520 --> 57:14.600]  much it cost to give them the data so just incredible Michigan police search
[57:14.600 --> 57:18.880]  cell phones during traffic stops ACL seeks information on Michigan program
[57:18.880 --> 57:22.880]  that allows cops to download information from smartphones this came out last year
[57:22.880 --> 57:26.280]  in England and London they're testing it where they have systems that break in
[57:26.280 --> 57:31.280]  while you're walking around and grab it here's another one London Guardian iPhone
[57:31.280 --> 57:36.280]  keeps record of everywhere you go privacy fears raised as researchers reveal
[57:36.280 --> 57:39.960]  file on iPhone that stores location coordinates and timestamps of owners
[57:39.960 --> 57:45.160]  movements and this was all under the telecommunications act of 96 now the
[57:45.160 --> 57:51.600]  point is this is illegal but they don't care they're gonna pull you over they're
[57:51.600 --> 57:54.000]  gonna demand your phone they're gonna grab it and plug it in and within
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.560]  seconds download everything off of it it's gotta be because the phones are
[57:57.560 --> 58:03.440]  designed all the smartphones underlaw to give you them everything and by the way
[58:03.440 --> 58:06.000]  you may think you got a cheap phone is just a flip phone those are smartphones
[58:06.000 --> 58:10.920]  too under the telecommunications act of 96 by October 1st 2001 all phones had to
[58:10.920 --> 58:16.640]  be compliant now they've got these systems being retrofitted on the
[58:16.640 --> 58:19.600]  government vehicles to drive around stealing everything they use Google as
[58:19.600 --> 58:25.320]  the NSA front now if you did this as a private citizen it's called cell phone
[58:25.320 --> 58:30.680]  hacking and it's got long prison sentences but they just do it no 4th
[58:30.680 --> 58:34.600]  amendment no 5th amendment but meanwhile they've confirmed the border patrol has
[58:34.600 --> 58:38.240]  been ordered to stand down and not eat rusty legals running around murdering
[58:38.240 --> 58:40.520]  and killing
[58:43.600 --> 58:52.400]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network a very wealthy US citizen

[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.040]  mean incredible isn't the word there is not words that I've known for a long
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:50.320]  time they've got wireless hubs including my sources in the Austin Police
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:54.640]  Department they've got through the local federal threat fusion center this has
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.840]  actually been in the paper this part hundreds and hundreds of microphones
[01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:01.400]  all over the city there are shotgun mics listing your street conversations
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:07.000]  with keyword analysis that then flags it they record for a week or so and then
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.440]  dump the data we're told and that started going in in 98 under a federal
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.960]  grant it's all over the country I remember a story about the Forest Service
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.880]  putting it up the middle of nowhere they've got laser couplers that they
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:22.720]  drive around these big trucks aim at your windows you can't even see the laser
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:27.920]  and then it picks up the audio bouncing off the off the window like a
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:35.240]  eardrum membrane they also have these cell phone grabbers and they can also
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:38.800]  just dial right into your cell phone conversations no warrants and the cops
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.680]  feel special being part of the special units they get a lot more money and last
[01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:46.520]  time I checked what Austin has six or seven of these big trucks they've got
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.960]  some of them disguised some of them not and they've got the big federal command
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:54.360]  center with all these toys and they've got license plate readers up this is
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:01.800]  where I live they scanners up and it's all very orderly and the narcotics are
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:05.520]  shipped in it's all very fun and they hope they find you using them and even
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.320]  if they don't catch you using them in places like Dallas and Houston they
[01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.360]  admit they just frame everybody in masks it's all come out in the news Dallas
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:14.000]  police just pull you over throw a bag of chalk in your car take your luxury
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.800]  vehicle or they go to your house throw it and take it and it's all admitted
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:20.840]  nobody gets in trouble the same thing in Seattle it's come out cops go in and
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.640]  sell to another cop drugs in the bathroom then take your bar or restaurant and then
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:28.600]  it's turned out in many areas of Seattle more than half the bars are owned by cops
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:36.520]  oh it's so good to have a public just ready to be total slaves they love it
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:41.040]  and then the good cops will they stay even when they're 55 years old as beat
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:46.480]  cops writing tickets and going to domestic disturbances but all the cops
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.680]  that know how to play ball man I've seen Austin cops that beat up people in
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:54.080]  wheelchairs in cases we've covered and then they get promoted right to commander
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:04:01.960]  I mean it's over I mean it's over it's over and a SWAT team guys can flip cars
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:05.520]  and wreck and nothing happens when they're drunk and other cops can run
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:08.760]  off the road drunk on their motorcycles and kill themselves and they go arrest
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:14.160]  the bar owner just where I live it's so much fun but again it's impossible for
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.400]  police to ever go bad they had never happened in any other country well it's
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.920]  happened here and the system is corrupt the system is evil we got the
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.520]  documents two years ago from law enforcement who are good true peace
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:30.480]  officers that hey the number one target is returning veterans gun owners
[01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:36.480]  conservatives libertarians so you see the old gray-haired cops out there with
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.880]  their radar guns all day you see the young crazy-eyed gremlin looking shaved
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:46.880]  head cops with the devil tattoos they're commanders oh damn it's you from
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:54.720]  Lockworth college and he goes it's officer demowsky you know more dim I
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:04.600]  got power now they're right back hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:08.600]  you about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.840]  colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:17.120]  breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:21.120]  of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.960]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:30.840]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.640]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products you
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:39.920]  can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:44.120]  generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided

[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:05.960]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:10.560]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.120]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:19.560]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:24.840]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:29.360]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:34.040]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:38.080]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.760]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:46.840]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:52.880]  a fall of the Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.360]  wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:03.480]  TV this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:07.840]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:12.000]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.040]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.920]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:24.160]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:28.320]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:32.640]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:36.360]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:40.560]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.560]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:47.560]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[01:07:47.560 --> 01:07:53.200]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:08:01.360]  doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:07.240]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:13.800]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:28.000]  by the way Dr. Jerome Corsi's got a book coming out on Obama and he's gone
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:32.880]  all over the world Indonesia Kenya you name it and they've expunged the records
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.760]  the one school record we got does confirm he changed his name to Barry
[01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:41.840]  Sataro did give up his US citizenship well that's all over the news today but
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:45.440]  I just want to point out that Webster Tarplein we carry both of his books by
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:50.800]  the way reported this years ago and in total detail the full spectrum with
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:55.840]  Barack H. Obama the unauthorized biography and it is the preeminent work
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:01.560]  available at info wars.com and deserves to be seen by everyone it is of course a
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:05.800]  big report a drudge report today book to reveal Obama's true identity and I'm
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:09.760]  sure it's gonna be powerful by Jerome Corsi and it goes through the fact that
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:14.960]  all over the world they're hiding who he really is and that they found some
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:19.240]  groundbreaking information and remember this is the guy that basically swift
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:25.000]  boated Kerry so if they do dig out some pretty powerful information but in the
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:36.080]  case of what's going on with Barry Sataro aka Barack Obama there is no doubt no
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:42.600]  doubt he CIA and that's the issue that's getting the death threats from very
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:46.000]  credible sources delivered to Wayne Madsen so I also want to briefly talk
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.360]  about that with Webster Griffin Tarplein but here's the headline missing records
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:53.520]  in Hawaii missing records in Kenya missing records in Indonesia and I want
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:58.160]  to post drudges article the link to drudge at info wars.com a part of his
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:02.240]  article did we do that yet I want to make sure one of the web people gets
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:08.360]  that done right now you did do it okay awesome it's up there at info wars.com
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.920]  Lord Monk is coming up in about 30 minutes Steve Watts is coming up at the
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:17.320]  end of the third hour but going to Webster Griffin Tarplein it was Tarplein
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.760]  several months ago when the Libyan rebellion began that wrote the articles
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.800]  at tarplein.net we posted them at info wars.com that broke down how the State
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:30.560]  Department was publicly funding these al-Qaeda groups even the LA Times two
[01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.720]  days ago admitted NATO al-Qaeda Taliban behind uprising they're now Orwellian
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:40.160]  terms saying it's peaceful bombs they're dropping it's humanitarian they're
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.200]  actually taking the ground troops are going to be humanitarian force with
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.560]  weapons who are going to go out and enter the city's Qaddafi's in and if he
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.280]  fights back then they're going to have to bring in a larger ground force so we've
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.880]  actually entered 1984 and there's a lot of mainstream news articles now admitting
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:11:00.760]  that the full ground invasion is on with the UN ordering the United States to
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.920]  contribute troops the Marine Corps ships that are already there more getting into
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:08.760]  place so Webster Tarplein a huge development over a month ago you said
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:13.320]  the Saudis are being double-crossed the globalists are devaluing the dollar this
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.720]  is a system to overthrow the entire Middle East now the Saudis as you said
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:20.800]  months ago except this last year are running to the Russians running to the
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.400]  Chinese I mean it's incredible Dr. Tarpley of history and also an economist
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:30.760]  that you broke all this down now it's all evident there what does this signify
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:34.840]  and there's also some mainstream articles today that the Arab Spring is
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:40.920]  not going completely well for the globalist precisely the the basic idea is
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:47.280]  that you had all of these countries be it Libya be it Saudi Arabia Pakistan and
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.920]  others lots and lots of countries in the Empire that we're trying to get out from
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:57.520]  under this suffocating US British IMF domination and in order to do that they
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:02.800]  were playing the Russian card the China card the Iranian card or trying to build
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:08.120]  themselves a brick's card it's not quite gonna do it because break it's a
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:11.400]  little bit heterogeneous but yes something like that individually the
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:16.360]  bricks although the bricks as a as an entity is not it's not really coherent
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:22.040]  but specifically now the news is this Saudi Arabia of course is a huge target
[01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:26.800]  of this ultimately you might say Saudi Arabia is the main target after Egypt
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:31.000]  that to get Egypt out of the way to go into Libya to bring the weapons in you
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.240]  said months ago Mubarak wasn't playing ball on that then Saudi Arabia then Iran
[01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:40.120]  it's the whole deal right now here's what we've got is an attempt by the
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:44.040]  Saudis to defend themselves to maintain their national independence and to
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:48.840]  stop this this tremendous CIA intervention and national endowment for
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:53.560]  democracy intervention into their internal affairs at the end of March we
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.360]  have Prince Bandar the head of the National Security Council and as far as
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:03.040]  I can see the dominant personality of the whole regime of the royal family
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.160]  going to Pakistan and meeting with the Prime Minister of Pakistan Gilani but
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:14.000]  I'm sure also with the Pakistani army and the ISI and the Washington Post has
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.880]  had a couple of freak out articles about this one by Martin Indic the former US
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:23.280]  ambassador to Israel this is a guy who remembers an Australian nationalized
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:29.040]  here very very strange guy the the idea is that the Prince Bandar has a range
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:34.160]  that if the US starts a color revolution inside the kingdom of Saudi Arabia
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:39.520]  the Pakistanis will send a division or more of troops to put it down there is
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:45.280]  a tradition for this in the 1970s 1980s at various times the Saudis kept a
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:51.720]  division of Pakistani troops inside Saudi Arabia for security to put down any
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:56.360]  eventual rebellions and those were the people I think that went into the the
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:02.520]  holy places that they're in the hodge in 1978 79 when that when there was some
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:08.960]  violent incidents there but you can see the idea that that Bandar is turning to
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:14.600]  an alliance with Pakistan in order to defend Saudi Arabia against the US is a
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:19.680]  kind of strategic revolution up to now Saudi Arabia has relied on the United
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.560]  States for security but now the people in around Bandar see obviously that Obama
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:31.040]  is the main threat that the US regime the CIA the NED are the main threat to the
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.440]  internal security of Saudi Arabia so they're looking for an option now once
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:40.160]  you say Pakistan of course you're also saying nuclear weapons you can say in
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:45.280]  a certain way it's quite possible that Bandar has arranged that Saudi Arabia
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.160]  is now under the Pakistani nuclear umbrella this is this is quite a new
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.680]  thing in world affairs these are two countries Pakistan and Saudi Arabia who
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.280]  have been under the US yoke totally dominated by the US bombed in the case
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.440]  of Pakistan who are trying to make a jailbreak and because of globalist
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.000]  treachery they were fully under the Anglo-American system but because of the
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.080]  attempted overthrows and assassinations of Ben Isar Budo and others and I've
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:15.200]  had the former head of Pakistani intelligence on confirming this Hameed
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.840]  Ghul folks doesn't get any more powered out of Pakistan he incursal the doctor
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.880]  partly is saying they now know they've been double-crossed the Saudis and again
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:27.760]  you said this last year I'm blown away partly by your by your foresight they
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:33.040]  now admit they're being double-crossed same thing six months ago said by our
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:37.120]  oil company connections through Lindsay Williams and so the globalists were
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.200]  attempting through the Rand Corporation Brzezinski model for a global
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:45.680]  destabilization from North Africa Middle East into Central Asia as a pretext to
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:49.840]  move giant forces and to then menace China and Russia I mean this is an
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:55.640]  incredibly bold move actually the the first attempt of Bandar the first thing
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:00.280]  that we did but at least I learned about was in July of 2009 I was on your
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.200]  program to call attention to the fact that Bandar was playing the Russian
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:08.880]  card it made numerous visits to Russia he had been meeting with Putin they were
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:14.600]  talking about Russian military assistance also there for Saudi Arabia so
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:20.400]  that goes back almost two years and in reality more most likely since then there
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.960]  was a period about a year when Bandar disappeared from view and we weren't
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:28.960]  exactly sure what had happened to him but now the word in various publications
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:33.920]  is Bandar is back and I have to remind people you may still have the idea that
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:38.960]  Bandar is this guy who's basically a slave of George Bush the younger Bandar
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.800]  Bush close friend of the Bush family this is ultimately all irrelevant he's a
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:47.800]  survivor and now it's even in Reuters that the Saudis are saying they're
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:52.040]  being double-crossed so he leaves health's arrest he's now back right and the
[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.920]  house arrest but we have to see whether that was really house arrest or not but
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:01.320]  the the idea now is that if the US starts this color revolution that there
[01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:05.280]  will be Pakistani assistance they look at look at how the US is attacking Saudi
[01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:10.400]  Arabia one way is through Yemen that entire thing in Yemen is basically a
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:15.680]  sideshow the target of everything that happens in Yemen is Saudi Arabia if you
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.400]  have the split up of Yemen above all the emergence of al-Qaeda in the Arabian
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:27.480]  Peninsula a QAP led by Shiri a Guantanamo six-year alumnus brought in by
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:31.920]  the United States to run it and of course our dear friend al-Laki the CIA
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.400]  Laki born in New Mexico shipped over obvious double agent those two guys one
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:42.040]  from Guantanamo and one from well from the intelligence community are running
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:47.240]  al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula so that's one source of a huge destabilization
[01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.920]  for Saudi Arabia and now that's even admitted in the LA Times in Washington
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:56.120]  Post they're not even denying this brazenly they think we're so done they
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:01.040]  say bombs are humanitarian ground trips are humanitarian al-Qaeda is bad when we
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:06.440]  say good when we say simultaneously I mean do you think they can really sell
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:10.580]  this to people well they're they're trying hard I just wanted to mention the
[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:14.520]  the other angle is Bahrain now Bahrain is this island right it's one of these
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.940]  little Emirates along what amounts to the coast of Saudi Arabia the Gulf
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:24.680]  Coast the Persian Gulf Arabian Gulf Coast of Saudi Arabia now there we have the
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:30.920]  Saudi troops have intervened in support of the Sunni royal family against the
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:36.360]  Shiite protesters this is obviously intended not just it's not really a
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:41.040]  destabilization of Bahrain because the fifth fleet base is there there is an
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.440]  angle of putting pressure on the royal family because they don't want the base
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.360]  to be used for a war with Iran but Webster I want to be clear it's a soft
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.680]  underbelly I want to be clear and it's spread the contagion to Saudi Arabia I
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.480]  can't stand the corrupt Saudis put in by British Intel a hundred plus years ago
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.860]  I can't stand Qaddafi the point is why are the globalist moving against their
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:04.240]  allies their old enemies they now admit it's all over the news that they are
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:08.680]  destabilizing and the Saudis respond by saying we're gonna slash oil production
[01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:13.400]  and yes we're two days after they met with Gates and tried to make a deal the
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:17.600]  Secretary of Defense they did run to Russia and China and so this could be a
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:23.720]  big miscalculation by the Anglo-American globalist it could the idea I think is
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:28.440]  that these countries are targeted not because of their internal regimes and
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:33.600]  of course the Saudi internal regime is quite distasteful to put it mildly but
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:38.520]  the main issue is that they're attempting to rebel against Anglo-American
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:42.920]  domination I think globalism is not exactly the right term this is US
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:47.800]  British imperialism that's all that ever was globalism implies that there's a
[01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:51.720]  place at the table for Russia or China and so forth and there's not those
[01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:55.920]  countries are all targeted they're all ultimately on the evening end of color
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:59.760]  revolution well let's say we're gonna skip this network break so stations should
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.880]  carry this and I don't want to get fighting going on here but I really
[01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:07.600]  respect your foresight your understanding but it's admitted now
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:12.760]  again we read three mainstream news articles yesterday LA Times you name it
[01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:18.880]  admitting that okay the West did orchestrate this in Egypt in Libya in
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:24.240]  Syria the State Department admits I mean they're doing all of this and then I
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:28.280]  get Lenin LaRouge on for the first time ever and and and I think he's got a lot
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:31.920]  of interesting ideas and it was right about the Anglo-American system and
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:36.400]  almost 90 years old and you know a very distinguished person but when I brought
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:41.120]  it up to him that this was all a Western destabilization program at the time it
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:45.160]  was admitted it was he basically said it was a real revolution now I understand
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.280]  that people have real reasons to be upset and the globalists recognize that
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:53.200]  climate politically and then triggered it but it's not debatable that they've
[01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:56.840]  triggered it and and all fair you were mentioning that to me do you have any
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:00.920]  statements about it well it certainly the thing that LaRouge was saying was
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:06.760]  that this was all genuine and spontaneous and I think that is absolutely wrong it
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:12.480]  the grievances are real the potential was real just as the potential under
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:19.360]  Metternich in in in Europe in 1848 was real but the detonation and then the
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:24.880]  shaping the leadership the program and the general direction of these things
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:30.960]  is totally provided by the CIA, MI6 and and NED I found it was interesting when
[01:21:30.960 --> 01:21:34.440]  you asked LaRouge that he immediately dodged the question he said the only
[01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:40.320]  thing I can say about it is it's all totally spontaneous and in 1782 the
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:44.800]  king of France made a mistake now the 1782 king of France made a mistake
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:49.680]  actually leads to an argument that the French Revolution was actually a
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:54.880]  destabilization of France to provoke provoked and promoted by the British but
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.560]  it was let me let me stop you this has all been declassified by the British if
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.560]  you read mainline history you're a doctorate of it but the general public
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:06.440]  doesn't know that it's on record that the South had real grievances they had
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:11.880]  them two decades two decades before we are two and a half decades earlier with
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:17.040]  Andrew Jackson they had real tariff issues the slavery you know was never an
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:23.080]  issue that's just a modern fiction but the British were in there openly
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:26.760]  manipulating the South and then stationing troops in Canada threatening to
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:32.360]  invade that's all mainline history this is the grand stratagem great game right
[01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:36.040]  and now I was actually talking about about the French Revolution not not so
[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:40.080]  much the American Civil War but it did I know but I mentioned the French and
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:45.080]  then I shifted gears into the yeah yes and of course the the the the the the
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.760]  Confederate States of America was a project that was that was detonated and
[01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:54.280]  promoted by Lord Palmer's been Lord John Mussel British intelligence and so
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:58.280]  forth the other thing I think is interesting looking at Bondar in
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:02.880]  particular we have this interesting article by Martin Indic in the
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:07.040]  Washington Post where he basically threatens the Saudis he says the
[01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:11.560]  Saudi system is very fragile and you better remember that Saudis you better
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:15.080]  remember that bond though we're going to we're going to come and get you in
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:19.160]  support for this in a certain way comes from unexpected quarters Jeff
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:23.280]  Steinberg that you recently had on your program has been following Bondar for
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:29.400]  two years back in July of 2009 when Bondar was playing the Russian card in
[01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:35.240]  beginning this attempt to free Saudi Arabia from total US domination this is
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:40.200]  the precisely the moment that Steinberg chose to attack Bondar for various
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:45.120]  issues about scandals and 9-11 and and so forth really those those pretext
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.680]  meaning meaning not very much but mainly the idea attack Bondar and now
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:53.640]  precisely at the time when Bondar is preparing his trip to Pakistan which
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:59.000]  really means an opening to China we have Steinberg again attacking him in the
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.840]  pages of that magazine on in this case it's an article that says the two worst
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.800]  guys in the Middle East are Bondar and Gaddafi now isn't that interesting this
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:13.040]  coincides precisely with the two main people that the that the US and the
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.720]  British are concerned about in the region so that's a very very
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:21.280]  interesting pattern that we have there but the general idea I think is clear
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:26.360]  but if Bondar goes to Pakistan this is a little bit like Nixon going to China
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:29.480]  right you would the way you go to China is sometimes through Pakistan that's
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:33.440]  our Nixon did it 40 years ago maybe that's how Bondar is doing it in a
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:38.920]  certain sense once you're in an alliance with Pakistan you will you're also then
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:43.960]  connected to Pakistan's ally China and I would assume that Bondar has kept up his
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:49.560]  connections to Putin and to Russia now this gives us Russia Saudi Arabia
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:55.000]  Pakistan and China now that's a coherent alliance that's a step beyond the
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000]  Shanghai Cooperation Organization and certainly way beyond the bricks the
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.720]  bricks that that have just been meeting that's an interesting group but in
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:08.080]  terms of strategy you've got the fact that India sitting right in the middle
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:13.080]  is essentially an ally of the US against China so they may agree economically
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:17.520]  but strategically I don't see how they will if we have Russia Saudi Arabia
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:21.480]  Pakistan and China that could become something that would be strategic and
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:26.160]  military but it could also become monetary and economic that is a that is
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:31.200]  an alliance with real world-shaping potential and again it's much stronger
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:36.160]  than these sort of things that we've seen so far now we are seeing press
[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:39.400]  reports admitting that the West is involved in all this but that it's not
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:44.560]  going well how do you see this ending right now well let me just one other
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.200]  scenario is this guy Michael Shoyer from the CIA of course CIA veteran was the
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:53.440]  bin Laden desk I've always called them the head of the bin Laden fan club in
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:59.080]  Langley he's on television saying that if the Saudis crack down in Bahrain and
[01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:05.120]  start killing Shiites then the Iranians will invade Bahrain and essentially be
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.520]  at war with Saudi Arabia and therefore the US will have to intervene again
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:15.040]  that's the that's the Brzezinski dream of the kamikaze event of playing them
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:18.560]  off against each other right but you can see what he's doing he's speaking very
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.600]  bluntly but the whole idea of this is to scare Saudi Arabia back onto the
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:29.760]  plantation right back on to the US imperial ship the thing in Libya that
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:33.440]  you've been mentioning the news this morning is that British French and
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:38.560]  Italian advisors are going to be present on the ground in Libya with this
[01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:42.960]  al-Qaeda infantry right they've always been there now they're beefing the
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.720]  foresaw right precisely that they're now they're going to be there openly they've
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.160]  been there for six or seven weeks and since probably the middle of February
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:54.880]  and and even earlier so this looks like mission creep very interesting
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:59.040]  anniversary we just had the 50th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs and it's
[01:26:59.040 --> 01:27:04.000]  exactly parallel except that when Alan Dulles and his crackpots of the CIA
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:11.120]  invaded Cuba in in April of 1961 when the first phase failed when the
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:17.800]  irregular forces that failed to to get an insurrection in Cuba Kennedy was then
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:22.000]  asked by Alan Dulles we you know we need air support we need actual invasion
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:26.160]  with Marines and Kennedy said to him no I'm not giving you the air support I'm
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:30.240]  not giving you the Marines and by the way you're fired that was a real president
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.880]  well it came out even on nightline excuse me frontline that they fired him he
[01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:39.600]  fired that whole group when they brought him north woods and said let's stage
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.800]  terror attacks and blame it on Cuba to invade right the number of causes but
[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:47.960]  certainly within a within what a year after the Bay of Pigs Alan Dulles was
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:52.720]  out on his ear tremendous hatred in the CIA for Kennedy ever since but what
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:56.920]  happens now in this case Libya's same example you've got a secret army in
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:01.600]  this case staffed by Al Qaeda terrorists that you've released from Guantanamo
[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:07.960]  and they failed to overwhelm Gaddafi so now we have the second phase what you
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:12.400]  never saw in the Bay of Pigs you are seeing now you are seeing the mission
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:16.840]  creep that happens when you don't have a real president and the CIA comes back
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:21.920]  and says look our our secret army is not working we need boots on the ground we
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:26.280]  need we need airstrikes we need all this stuff and Obama's gonna give them and
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:31.640]  they're saying if if as these troops try to march in with humanitarian weapons
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:35.720]  if Gaddafi resisted in any way then there'll be an open invasion with the
[01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:40.480]  Marines waiting off the coast how do you expect that to end I mean they're
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:45.520]  openly saying Gaddafi leave now or we're coming into Tripoli well and that
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:50.040]  would be another war and we've seen the Iranians and sorry the Libyans have real
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:55.920]  guns with real bullets you know you had Somalia seemed like a very easy invasion
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:29:00.240]  he's also armed over a million of the citizens yeah that's actually very
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:04.040]  interesting that's that's the Lin Piao people's war doctrine and the
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:07.600]  interesting thing is you can't do that unless you are really popular if you
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:13.320]  don't have a base now it's largely a tribal base but it's it's also a base
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:18.120]  based on economic performance remember Libya was the poorest country in Africa
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:22.680]  now it's the richest and that happened under Gaddafi so that's quite a record
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:28.560]  it's not all bad there's also this great man made river right the biggest no
[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:33.840]  definitely want to be stabilized Webster from the halls of Montezuma to the
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:37.520]  shores of Tripoli will fight our country's battles for the bankers thank

[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:37.680]  is going to be our guest then I'm going to get into the latest incredible
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:41.840]  economic news it turns out the Associated Press is confirming the
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:48.120]  White House tried to get standard and pours to not start to move towards
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:51.920]  delisting the United States is a triple a rating that means that our interest
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.640]  rates will go up on the debt and will basically become like Argentina or the
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:01.120]  Weimar Republic that's coming up at the start of the next hour I've also got
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:04.920]  this incredible confirmed news that police all over the country are being
[01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:07.800]  issued these wireless systems that download everything off your cell
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:12.880]  phones without warrants and they're also the demanding at checkpoints to grab
[01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:16.560]  your phone and plug them in and download everything off of without warrants I
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:22.560]  mean this is total 1984 and the phones have been designed under federal law to
[01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:27.200]  have the backdoor forum to do it so we're going to be breaking that down
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:33.360]  Brent crude climbs above $122 on week dollar there's the Washington post
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:37.640]  article actually AP also has an Obama administration officials tried to keep
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:43.200]  S&P rating at stable and they have the nerve to say upping budgets and raising
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.280]  the debt ceiling that that will stop a default when S&P and every other major
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:51.000]  economic institution with common sense it's not hard it's like saying up is up
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:56.760]  down is down left is right you know black is white it you know it's simple
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.160]  we're saying up is up they're saying up is down it's amazing and then meanwhile
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:04.520]  they're saying no more debt will keep us from defaulting when we're actually
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:08.960]  technically defaulting because they're now hyper-inflating and monetizing over
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:12.880]  70% of the T bills but that's coming up next hour and then Steve Watson writer
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:17.280]  for info wars.com and prisonplot.com joins us from London via video Skype as
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:21.360]  well to break down things like the royal wedding and the Republicans aren't
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:24.280]  allowed to go out and protest but everybody else is allowed to celebrate
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:30.960]  we'll also get his view as a political scientist on what's happening with the
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:35.840]  situation in Libya and in the Middle East but Lord Christopher Monkton 3rd

[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:46.280]  science and reality when it comes to the fraud that is man-made global warming
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:52.000]  and the Kinley Al Gore plan to tax all human activity he's a British politician

[01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:26.800]  latest on the social engineers trying to seize the energy sources of the world
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:32.480]  UKIP launched their manifesto manifesto reveals intention for tough
[01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:36.480]  approach and we're gonna be breaking that down of course a Nigel Farage of
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:41.560]  the UK Independence Party in the EU Parliament from England also a frequent
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:45.120]  guest here and survived that plane crash we're very thankful for that Lord
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:50.760]  Monkton thank you for joining us today from Scotland. Alex as always it's a
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:57.000]  pleasure I'm sitting here in Edinburgh in my apartment overlooking Edinburgh Castle
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:04.280]  the sun is shining the weather is good and the politics are lousy. For those that
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:08.720]  don't know who the UK Independence Party is in the US it's basically similar to
[01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:12.720]  the Tea Party or the Ron Paul type folks that openly speak out against the
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:18.760]  global government openly quote the the scallywags on their plans and openly
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:24.240]  fight them and your party not just in the UK but in Europe similar groups are
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.680]  exploding and gaining ground tell us about this new D-Day invasion of the
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:36.280]  new World Order system. Well what is happening now is that in Britain the
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:41.760]  United Kingdom Independence Party is very much on the march we only were
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:49.960]  founded 17 years ago by an academic and now suddenly we have grown into being the
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:55.680]  second biggest party in British politics in European Parliament elections of
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:59.160]  course the European Parliament isn't a real parliament it's not like your
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:04.440]  Congress it can't make laws it's just a kind of talking shop like the Dumas of
[01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:10.600]  John Nicholas II. But it shows the will of the British people. So the will of the British people
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.520]  it does show the will because we came second we beat everybody except the
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:19.800]  Conservatives that time and then in the recent by-election for the British
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:24.960]  Parliament in the seat of Barnsley where the former Labour member is now
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:30.560]  serving time in prison for having fiddled his expenses we came second
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:34.920]  beating the Conservative and Liberal parties who formed the coalition
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:39.120]  government here and coming second only to the Labour Party and if you put up a
[01:38:39.120 --> 01:38:42.560]  donkey for the Labour Party in Barnsley it's an old mining constituency it's
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.840]  Arthur Scargill's headquarters they'll always vote Labour there but UKIP came
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:52.480]  second now we're fighting local government elections all round Britain we
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:56.360]  have local government elections in England we have Scottish Parliament
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:00.800]  elections in Scotland and the Welsh Assembly elections in Wales UKIP are
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:06.400]  contesting all three I am leading the UKIP effort in Scotland and in
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:11.480]  particular we're beginning to make some headway because the Scottish National
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:19.080]  Party which effectively is communist they are present the ruling clique in in
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:22.680]  the Scottish Parliament and they came out with a manifesto earlier in the week
[01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:27.000]  in which they said that they were going to generate 100% of Scotland's
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.400]  electricity by so-called renewable means which they mainly mean windmills in
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:37.920]  just nine years time and I found myself at a Hustings just a few days ago
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:43.480]  opposite Rosanna Cunningham who is the so-called environment so-called
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:49.160]  Minister for the so-called Scottish so-called government and she knows
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:52.960]  nothing about the environment of course most politicians don't and she was
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:57.240]  saying well it is necessary to save the planet and of course it isn't but I said
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:01.280]  look if you believe that you'll believe that you really believe that in nine
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:05.120]  years time you're going to have enough windmills doing their thing to generate
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:09.720]  all of Scotland's electricity you only have to go back as far as last December
[01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:15.280]  when we had no wind for an entire month we had the second coldest winter in
[01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:21.440]  Britain since records began in 1659 that's what global warming means to us at
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:26.760]  the moment it was very very cold and the percentage of UK and Scottish
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:32.200]  electricity contributed by all the wind farms that we have over that bitterly
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:38.520]  cold month and we needed all the electricity we get was at 0.0% amazing
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:43.680]  but to be clear you are now standing for the Scottish Parliament you are now
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:49.040]  running for office that's right it's most unlikely that I'll succeed this time
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:52.240]  round we're not the kind of politicians that pretend we're going to win when
[01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:57.600]  we're not we're too new in Scotland to expect to storm the gates yet and the
[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:04.160]  press here are terrified of us but here they are with the the SNP the ruling
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:08.960]  faction here coming out with this mad I mean heroically lunatic policy of
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:15.600]  generating electricity with with the wind and at huge cost taxpayers of course the
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:22.280]  only election that has from the outset opposed all these stupid windbills is
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:27.080]  the United Kingdom Independence Party and can we get ourselves onto a
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:32.200]  television program or into a newspaper virtually not at all they will not let
[01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:35.960]  us anywhere near the media here because it's a closed shop it's a little kind of
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:41.400]  Marxist cozy between the Liberals and the Socialists and the SNP and which of
[01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:45.200]  them is more communist is not for me to say but they're all pretty far to the
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:49.840]  left and the media up here exactly the same they don't want the truth told they
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:53.760]  don't want the voice of democracy to be heard and I'll give you a little vignette
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:57.160]  which will really make you laugh Alex this was absolutely wonderful when
[01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:01.720]  Nigel Farage who's a regular guest on your show came up very kindly to support
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:08.760]  me and do the launch in Edinburgh of UKIP's manifesto one of the topics on
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:13.560]  that on that manifesto is that we want to give people the same right as they
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:20.040]  have in Switzerland so that if the people think that the governing class is not
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.600]  representing them on a particular subject of the people that matters to the
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:29.080]  people they can call a referendum if one percent of them sign a request saying we
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:34.320]  want a reference recall then yeah exactly that and then that referendum on
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:39.880]  any subject they like has to be held and the result is binding on the Scottish
[01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:43.680]  Parliament the Westminster Parliament and of course the the unelected
[01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:48.440]  digital commissars of Europe and that was our policy now I've been I was
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:53.560]  interviewed by a BBC reporter who it was quite clear was again from the Marxist
[01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:58.960]  wing of the BBC which means about 99.9% of it and I said to her just a matter of
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:02.520]  interest what did you think of the idea of letting the people decide what
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:07.520]  matters to them and this is this was her applied its classic BBC its classic
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:11.800]  Marxism and it really illustrates the problem that democracy now faces
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:16.640]  really worldwide she said well of course you know the thing about the people is
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.920]  that if you let them decide what matters they will vote for trivialities
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:25.320]  won't they they'll vote for trivial things things that don't matter that was
[01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:31.280]  the absolute instinctual profound deeply held contempt that the BBC and the
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:37.520]  person of this dopey little reporter had for the rights and freedoms and democracy
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:42.880]  of ordinary people that's what we're up against Alex this governing class which
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:48.160]  is sort of taking over and is gradually dismantling democracy everywhere as we
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:52.000]  speak it's largely gone as you know in the UK we've talked to this before well
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:56.680]  I want you to go Europe sure I want you to go over that Lord Monckton but but
[01:43:56.680 --> 01:44:02.200]  first digressing back yeah since she raises same thing here in the US they
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.720]  create regional governments that are basically appointed by the federal
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:12.200]  bureaucracy and then they tell the counties the cities the states what to
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:19.240]  do and you've got Obama telling the EPA to shut down coal power plants and other
[01:44:19.240 --> 01:44:25.240]  plants and and even hydroelectric dams with no law behind him and then when
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:29.920]  states not stand up against them the feds will come in and even seize the
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:34.680]  facilities but then meanwhile General Electric who paid no taxes last year they
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:39.680]  had up the president's economic council Obama has given them waivers to open new
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:44.480]  plants and not upgrade their dirty coal plants but everyone else basically the
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:48.120]  head of the energy department has said they're going to start shutting down I
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:52.360]  mean people call them mindless environmentalist or well-meaning idiots
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:57.600]  they're not idiots they're gangsters creating oligopolies creating monopolies
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:01.360]  shutting down their competition and it's the same thing in England where you
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:05.040]  have government-funded media and then they won't let the UK Independence Party
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:10.040]  get on TV but regardless you guys run a couple times in every new area and then
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:14.840]  start winning as people hear your common sense being injected so for those that
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:22.480]  don't know describe how over 70% of UK laws are are handed down from the EU
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:26.600]  because this is something a lot of Americans don't understand that's a
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:33.720]  very good point and it's actually 83% it's five laws in six handed down by the
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:38.360]  unelected commissars that is the official German title for them the
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:43.800]  commissars that hated communist term for the for the people who ran the Soviet
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:47.520]  government the commissars the whole Soviet Constitution has moved westward
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:52.880]  83% of Europe's laws that includes Britain's laws and Scott's laws are made
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:58.280]  by people that nobody elects we can't hold them to account we can't question
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:02.240]  them we don't even know who they are we can't remove them and we can't replace
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:06.400]  them these people are the enemies of freedom and democracy they have their
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:11.480]  own agenda which is not an agenda which you or I or the vast majority of good
[01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:17.520]  red-blooded Americans Alex would ever dream of going along with and they make
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:22.360]  the laws until I describe how they do it because it is a fascinating process and
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:29.520]  it starts by them meeting in secret to decide the common sense this is the 27
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:33.960]  of them they meet in secret behind closed doors press not allowed in nobody
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:37.160]  allowed to know what they're talking about it's entirely secret and then
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:44.000]  every three hours day and night 365 and a quarter days a year they issue a new
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:49.480]  directive that's what they call the law in Europe not a democratic bill or act
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:56.600]  a direct and directive as you know is the root of dictator that's it it is an
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:03.740]  instruction from our new masters on how we are to behave and the so-called
[01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:07.760]  parliament of the individual member states like the westerns to parliament
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:14.560]  the Scottish Parliament it is their duty to enact these directives into the law
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:18.920]  of the individual member states and if they don't then the government can be
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:25.960]  fined unlimited amounts of money by the commissars until they do comply and so
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:30.760]  what happens is that the first stage of the law is this directives proposed in
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:35.680]  secret then it is passed from the commissars to another secret committee
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:42.280]  indeed a committee so secret that until just a few months ago its very existence
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:46.880]  was not even mentioned on the European Union's own website and this is the
[01:47:46.880 --> 01:47:51.280]  committee of permanent representatives by the very phrase permanent you can
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:55.880]  tell what they're not elected because election is not a permanent state but
[01:47:55.880 --> 01:48:01.280]  they are appointed bureaucrats nobody knows who they are they meet in secret
[01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:04.880]  to do what you in Congress would call the markup which is the detailed
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:09.680]  consideration of the legislation and we would call the committee stage and that
[01:48:09.680 --> 01:48:14.440]  again we would do it in public you do it in public they do it in secret and they
[01:48:14.440 --> 01:48:20.200]  are not elected to do it then it goes from them to would you believe a third
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:25.800]  body also meeting in secret this one is called the Council of Ministers you think
[01:48:25.800 --> 01:48:29.960]  are ministers perhaps they're affected yes they are but they don't sit on the
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:33.520]  Council of Ministers well not very often anyway normally the Council of
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:38.000]  Ministers is you've guessed it another group of unelected bureaucrats meeting
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:44.320]  in secret to decide whether the law proposed by the commissars and worked
[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:48.000]  on by this committee of permanent representatives shall become the
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.880]  supreme law of Europe and if they say no that's the end of it if they say yes then
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:00.800]  and only then it is put in front of the only elected institution in Europe this
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:04.600]  is the European Talking Shop or it's called a parliament that's a joke word
[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:09.680]  for it really and the Talking Shop can express an opinion but it cannot decide
[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:13.640]  the legislation it cannot either decide in favor or against all it can do is
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:19.840]  express an opinion if it says yes then the legislation even then doesn't
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:23.800]  necessarily go through because the commissars have been there to put forward
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:27.520]  kind of stalking horse legislation they don't want to go through so then it goes
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:31.240]  to all these stages wasting everybody's time then the commissars say we want to
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:35.320]  show who's boss and we're going to not let that legislation proceed and so they
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:40.280]  can then overrule the European elections and it goes on and on but the reasons
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.720]  is important to leave a lot of noise I'll give you the next stage the next day
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:48.720]  sure go ahead one more stage it then goes to the parliament of the member
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:54.040]  states for debate but of course we don't get debate in our parliament on this it
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:57.920]  goes to the legislative scrutiny committee of the House of Commons and
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:01.720]  you've guessed it that's the only committee of the House of Commons that
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:07.080]  meets behind closed doors in secret now if you read the Madison papers and you
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:12.120]  see how insistent they were that the Congress that they created with article
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:17.280]  one section one of your great Constitution of Liberty was to meet in
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:22.760]  public so that those who had elected the members of both houses of Congress or
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:26.680]  course it was one house originally but now both has Congress could see what it
[01:50:26.680 --> 01:50:31.080]  was that those who they had elected were doing and saying on their behalf
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:36.480]  democracy doesn't work unless legislation is considered in public but
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:42.000]  every state of the legislation that is now imposed upon us from Europe is
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:47.120]  conducted in secret and nearly every state is conducted by people whom we do
[01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:52.920]  not elect whatever else this is Alex it is not democracy it's a dictatorship of
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:57.400]  the commas are stay there I've got a key point to add them we'll talk about their

[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:10.360]  with us and I'm the shift gears and all the other news but the point I was
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:15.840]  starting to get to before the break is why is what's happening in the EU so
[01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:20.840]  important to what's happening here it is the same system of unelected
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:25.600]  bureaucracies basically bought and paid for by private corrupt interest that are
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:33.160]  usurping Republican Republic Democratic forms of government all over the world
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:37.360]  and we're entering into the same system here they've already set up the SPP
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:43.880]  North American Union by stealth Lord Moncton studying these systems is there
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:48.960]  not a continuity of agenda through the bureaucratic class
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:52.960]  Yes there is I mean it's very clear that the European model which is
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:57.520]  clearly by Clark as we call it is that's the model they're now going to try and
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:55:02.920]  spread worldwide they've grown tired of democracy they don't like voters coming
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:07.080]  along and saying we don't like the arrangements you have made for us we
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:11.720]  want another lot to take charge they hate that they hate being thrown out after
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:15.560]  they've had all the trappings and motor cars and red boxes and everybody
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:19.640]  calling them minister and secretary of state they love all that and they don't
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:23.680]  like it taken away and they realize the way to make sure it never gets taken away
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:28.360]  again it's simply to take democracy away and so the European Union was set up
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:34.040]  right from the start with elaborate care to make sure that had no point did
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:39.200]  democracy get anywhere near the real decision-making and so when it came to
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:45.000]  setting up the world government which the UN would like to set up save the
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.320]  planet from supposed climate change they used UN they use EU advisers and
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:56.120]  their fingers were all over the dockets I read in Cancun last December at the
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:00.080]  latest round of this kind of rolling international conference they have and
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:05.440]  it's quite clear that they've decided the way to go is the EU way but without
[01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:10.160]  even bothering to have the fig leaf of an elected parliament they're not even
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:15.080]  gonna have it as a fig leaf it's going to be openly anti-democratic and they
[01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:19.000]  reckon they're going to get away with it well I reckon they're not because one
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.920]  of the things that's happening is that when I first began talking about
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:26.560]  world government people said to me oh yes you're another world government
[01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:31.520]  conspiracy theorist pointy head don't you have more sense than that so the
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:35.720]  first person that said this to me was Kevin Lybin who was a journalist very
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:40.160]  distinguished journalist actually on the the National Post in Canada which is a
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:44.920]  very major newspaper and I had been speaking to the Petroleum Club of Cal
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:49.560]  Korea about two years ago three years ago and I said this world government is
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:53.520]  coming the treaty is already in draft this was the draft Copenhagen Treaty
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:56.840]  that eventually failed but I said it's quite clear that what they want is
[01:56:56.840 --> 01:56:59.240]  world government he came up after and said oh world government world
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:02.680]  government is in nonsense you know these are just conspiracy theory I said I have
[01:57:02.680 --> 01:57:07.960]  three words for you Kevin you said what I said read the treaty he said you mean
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:11.520]  there is one I said do you think I'd just sit here and make stuff up so I
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:15.080]  sent him a copy of it and an hour later he rang back he said this is ten times
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:18.600]  worse than you ever told me he said it's really dreadful I'm gonna put it all
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:22.960]  over the front page of the National Post which he did and within a week he was
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:25.680]  on succumbent for six months to the Prime Minister of Canada to make
[01:57:25.680 --> 01:57:31.200]  absolutely sure that that law didn't get anywhere near Canada they fought
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:34.800]  against it and they kept it at bay but of course in Britain we've already lost
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:39.960]  our freedom in America if you go on the way you are with the nation being I
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:43.880]  think willfully bankrupted by your political class I mean bankrupted not
[01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:48.200]  just economically and morally I mean financially they are they are driving you
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:53.960]  into complete bankruptcy and they do this because a bankrupt system is a
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:57.920]  system in which the authoritarians the people who don't like democracy indeed
[01:57:57.920 --> 01:58:02.480]  the totalitarians the people who want to rule from the center regardless of what
[01:58:02.480 --> 01:58:06.400]  the voters want they are the ones who will try to take power when the
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:09.960]  financial come collapse finally comes and you're quite right to to sound
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:14.960]  regular warning about the state of the finances in America the rate at which the
[01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:19.920]  American government is is borrowing its failure to deal with the structural
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:24.600]  problems of over spending in the federal government which have been made 20
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:29.080]  times worse by Obama he can no longer get away with saying it was all George
[01:58:29.080 --> 01:58:34.120]  Bush's fault he has added three times as much debt as was there when George Bush
[01:58:34.120 --> 01:58:37.760]  left absolutely Lord Moncton got to break five more minutes with you will

[02:00:26.240 --> 02:00:29.920]  he's graciously staying with us under 20 because I've got a bunch of questions
[02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:36.280]  we haven't even gotten into I constantly study the mega corporations that are
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:40.000]  not free market teamed up with government bureaucracies trying to set up a
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:45.520]  mafia system where you've got to get an imperial seal from them to be able to do
[02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:48.520]  business and that's what this is all about so the next segment we'll talk
[02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:52.480]  about the fact that they're down but they're not out exposed by climate gate

[02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:02.640]  liberty with literally the leading mind and believe me I do a lot of research
[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:06.200]  folks he's the leading guy there's been a hundred percent spot on in all his
[02:01:06.200 --> 02:01:10.520]  mathematical calculations on what he broke down about what were frauds the UN

[02:01:19.040 --> 02:01:22.560]  segment we'll get into their latest attacks on our liberty and how we stop
[02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:27.240]  them globally because it's the same program worldwide but finishing up you
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:33.240]  were getting into a police state example Lord Moncton and and then we'll come
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:39.280]  back and get into their latest operations 18 months ago Jason McGoldrick
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:44.040]  who had gone over to Hungary to set up a company there which had failed came back
[02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:51.480]  to the UK a few months after that the serious organized crime agency that's
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:58.520]  our KGB kicked down the door of his house at three in the morning took him away
[02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:03.560]  without telling his wife and family where they were taking him took him in
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:08.320]  front of a judge in London who had no power to stop what was happening next
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:13.080]  and put him on a plane to Hungary at the request of the prosecuting authorities
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:17.680]  there who said they were ready to prosecute him for fraud they there was no
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:21.640]  hearing to discover whether there was any evidence against him before he was
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:26.680]  shipped off overseas habeas corpus which is written into Magna Carta I was
[02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:31.880]  reading it in the original Latin only the other day has now been taken away by
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:35.360]  this procedure called the European arrest warrant he was flung into jail
[02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:39.280]  without his parents or anybody or his children knowing or his wife knowing
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:44.680]  where he was he was fed on rented pork fat three times a day which is
[02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:49.400]  effectively torture under UK law anyone who did that to you would be
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:53.080]  prosecuted for torture and that's a very serious criminal offense and he was
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:58.440]  kept there for four months and he got in touch with a conservative member of the
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:02.240]  European Parliament and now you'll know why I'm not a conservative because that
[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:05.680]  conservative member of the European Parliament said to him I don't care
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:11.040]  whether you say you're innocent or not if one of our fellow governments in the
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:15.840]  European Union says you're guilty that's enough for me we don't need trials these
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:20.200]  days and you can stay right where you are and I'm not lifting a finger to help
[02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:25.200]  you and that was extraordinary reply this man got eventually in prison so he
[02:03:25.200 --> 02:03:29.160]  got in touch with my noble friend the Earl of Dartmouth who is a sitting member
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:32.440]  of the European Parliament in the UKIP interest United Kingdom Independence
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:37.400]  Party he said to him will you help and Dartmouth got on the next plane went to
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:44.480]  the prison and got him out and got him home I've got to stop you sir sir I was
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:49.200]  not aware of this I knew this was going on I have seen on our local news they
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:54.440]  bring Japanese police here and are signing deals to allow them to grab US
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:59.760]  citizens they bring EU police here they send our police there it's unelected
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:05.600]  there are no laws they just do whatever they want and this is this new world order
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:11.400]  system where as long as it's a EU UN member you are now under their laws and
[02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:15.000]  they're now saying Americans will be under the anti free speech laws of
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.040]  Canada via this SPP we're going to break but I want to come back and give you the
[02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:23.480]  floor because some stations don't carry this segment to recap the story in great
[02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:28.280]  detail and get into it because because there's so many facets to this and you
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:32.960]  bring them all up and for for those that aren't concerned this is one of the main
[02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:37.560]  reasons we had 1776 in this country is because they had kangaroo courts and the
[02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:43.880]  king what and bureaucrats would haul a colonist who were British citizens on
[02:04:43.880 --> 02:04:48.920]  the boats and deprive them of English law and Magna Carta and take them to
[02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:53.160]  these kangaroo courts sometimes in in other possessions I mean this is as
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:57.680]  tyrannical as it gets Lord Christopher Monkton this is unbelievable we're gonna
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:01.560]  pull some news articles up on this when we come back unbelievable this is Alex
[02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:05.200]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:09.360]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:05:09.360 --> 02:05:13.680]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[02:05:13.680 --> 02:05:17.680]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:22.000]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:26.360]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:30.080]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:05:30.080 --> 02:05:34.240]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:37.520]  families lose their power from weather-related onages number five a
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:41.880]  solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:44.720]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:49.880]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:14.440]  will be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:19.600]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[02:07:19.600 --> 02:07:24.720]  shots I think it's that incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:29.280]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:07:29.280 --> 02:07:33.960]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:38.000]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:41.680]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:46.720]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:00.720]  TV
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:09.480]  he's the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network I remember
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:15.200]  more than a decade ago interviewing constitutional law scholars people like
[02:08:15.200 --> 02:08:19.840]  congressman Ron Paul others who pointed out that under the EU system and the UN
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:23.840]  global governance model they put all this out officially their plan and they
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:27.760]  teach it at model UN for high school and college students I've been to these
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:32.440]  events I've had family that was part of it that someone from Japan can come
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:36.840]  arrest me here if I violate a free speech law that Japan says is illegal or
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:41.160]  the Canadian government that arrest preachers for reading you know anti
[02:08:41.160 --> 02:08:44.040]  homosexual stuff out of the Bible regardless what you think of that it's
[02:08:44.040 --> 02:08:48.440]  they're right but now I've seen more and more articles about the EU and all
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:53.600]  their new Eastern European members where they have total police state rules in
[02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:58.400]  place it's the old Soviet Union model and they're arresting British citizens
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:03.240]  and others and Lord Moncton was getting into a case on him to recap it and get
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:11.000]  into more detail of Jason McGoldrick and you know no real judge no real charges
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.920]  basically put in a third-world style gulag there's the headline Britain held
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:20.000]  in Hungarian prison to make legal bid and we've got a whole bunch of other
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:23.720]  mainstream news articles admitting all of this where you're seized not
[02:09:23.720 --> 02:09:27.800]  violating a UK law something will be illegal in the UK and then you're not
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:31.320]  even given a trial and Lord Moncton was talking about a conservative member of
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:34.680]  the EU Parliament from England so-called conservative saying you we don't need
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:40.440]  trials anymore and I remember in 1998 reading the headline Tony Blair BBC the
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:45.200]  Magna Carta is dead under EU law and they were proud of it flaunting it
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:48.920]  throwing it and so before we get into this Lord Moncton the time we have left
[02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:53.640]  it's so important for those that don't know about 1215 running mead the root
[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:58.120]  of what became British Liberty and then the model of the Republic here
[02:09:58.120 --> 02:10:02.440]  habeas corpus every man's home is his castle for those that don't know this
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:07.040]  was the beginning of the end of serfdom they're trying to bring us back in to
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:14.480]  serfdom this is exactly the point Alex Magna Carta was signed by King John with
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:19.720]  his barons because previously the King's ruled by absolute decree
[02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:26.120]  eventually the Baron said no we're not having that we want to share power with
[02:10:26.120 --> 02:10:30.960]  you and we want to make sure that every citizen of this kingdom has certain
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:36.680]  minimum rights that you cannot and no government can arbitrarily tread on and
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:40.880]  one of those rights which it mentioned specifically is the right not to be
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:44.960]  arbitrarily moved against or imprisoned it's mentioned several times in Magna
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:52.520]  Carta without a proper public hearing and what happened to Jason McGoldrick an
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:58.600]  innocent small businessman wife and two kids then he's got a third one now he
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:11:02.720]  went to Hungary to try to set up business the business didn't succeed it went
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:08.640]  under earning $18,000 I mean it wasn't a big amount of money not the kind of
[02:11:08.640 --> 02:11:13.000]  thing you could extradite somebody for even if he defrauded somebody which he
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.160]  said he didn't I can't tell you whether he did or he didn't but that's not the
[02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:20.680]  point of the story the point was no evidence whatsoever but he committed
[02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:26.800]  any crime was put before any court in the UK and he went before one of the UK's
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:32.360]  best judges mr. Justice Collins the first solicitor ever to sit as a judge on
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:36.720]  the High Court who reads everything really cares about human rights and
[02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:42.400]  Collins was horrified at being asked simply to rubber stamp a request by the
[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:46.680]  Hungarian prosecutors that Jason McGoldrick without even his family being
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:51.560]  told should be shipped straight out to Hungary and locked away until he was
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:58.520]  tried for alleged fraud and the judge said I have to presume he said that
[02:11:58.520 --> 02:12:02.640]  there is primary facing evidence against you evidence on the face of it that
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:07.080]  you have committed a crime I'm not allowed to ask any questions about whether
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:11.800]  there is any such and that's Napoleonic that's Napoleonic that's guilty until
[02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:17.040]  proven innocent it's not it's worse than that because at least the huge desk
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:21.880]  took John under the under the Napoleonic code that's the magistrate at first
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:28.400]  instance under our system has the right and indeed the duty to ask questions
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:33.360]  it's an interrogative rather than adversarial system where the magistrate
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:37.520]  asks questions to find out whether there is at least a case so it's even worse
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:42.040]  than it's more like not talking about in the Napoleonic system we're not talking
[02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:46.000]  about a British system we are talking about a Soviet communist system wow
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:53.360]  under which the accused has no rights at all to be heard habeas corpus Alex in
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:59.880]  Britain is gone and at a meeting just last night out in Lago ward in Fife
[02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:05.200]  which is quite well attended by by local people I said I'm going to call Britain
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:09.080]  a police state and then ask how many of you think that that's overstating the
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:12.520]  case and about 40% of them put their hands up so they thought that was
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:17.560]  overstating it and then I told them the story of Jason McGoldrick I said in the
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:21.560]  KGB we call them a serious organized crime age agency they're one of the most
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:26.280]  hateful organizations in Britain they kicked down his door at three in the
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:30.440]  morning without any warning they arrested him they had him in front of
[02:13:30.440 --> 02:13:36.880]  Mr. Justice Collins at the High Court in no time at all and Mr. Justice Collins
[02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:40.760]  ordered him to be put on the plane and taken to Hungary where he was locked up
[02:13:40.760 --> 02:13:45.560]  for four months without trial without anyone having told him what he was
[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:49.560]  accused of without anyone allowing him access to a lawyer or the British
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:54.440]  Council without anyone telling his wife or children where he was and he was
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:14:02.880]  fed on rancid pork fat three times a day and he is still ill now as a result of
[02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:07.880]  this torture to which they subjected him without at any time having been ready
[02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:13.680]  to prosecute him because these the very few rules which the wretched
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:17.960]  prosecutors of foreign countries have to follow in applying the European arrest
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:21.920]  warrant do at least include a rule that you may not arrest somebody on grounds
[02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:25.840]  that you're about to prosecute them unless you're about to prosecute them he
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:29.560]  can now prove they weren't about to prosecute they weren't ready because he
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:35.560]  got a piece of paper two months ago a year after they after William Dartmouth
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:39.480]  my noble friend the other Dartmouth at UKIP MEP got him out of that prison when
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:43.640]  nobody else would help him saying that they're still trying to find evidence
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:46.960]  against him they haven't actually yet got a case against him but Lord Montyn
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:53.000]  flagrantly abused the procedure of such as it is of the of the arrest warrant it
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:59.680]  listens simply an arbitrary rendition to a foreign country without any hearing
[02:14:59.680 --> 02:15:04.520]  without any questions being asked as to whether this guy was guilty of anything
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:07.920]  or whether they were even ready to say that he was guilty of anything which we
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:13.360]  now know they weren't we are no longer a free country we are now a police state in
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:18.560]  the formal sense in that you no longer have the rights that Magna Carta itself
[02:15:18.560 --> 02:15:22.840]  gave us a right under which I was born but under which I no longer live
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:29.000]  unbelievable but I should get a hearing in front of a judge before anybody locks
[02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:35.640]  me up or finds me or extradites me that right has gone unbelievable and I want
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:39.100]  to expand on that because that is the most fundamental right and this has
[02:15:39.100 --> 02:15:43.960]  happened in every culture where you have absolute rule by a despot a king a
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:51.880]  oligarchy a dictator is they can say she's that big Alex here's a nasty bit
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:56.680]  Jason McGoldrick originally you know he wasn't a UK member he was a member of
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:16:00.800]  the Conservative Party he wrote to his conservative member of the European
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:04.640]  Parliament and he said look I have been arbitrarily arrested I haven't been told
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:09.120]  why I've been locked up for four months I'm very sick I've been poisoned with this
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:15.920]  ghastly pork fat and I am desperate for my family to know where I am I want to
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:21.320]  get this sorted out will you please help and this was the reply he got from a
[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:26.360]  so-called conservative and now you will know Alex why I no longer I'm a member
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:29.560]  of the Conservative Party because this is the kind of people they now have as
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:33.920]  their representatives this man wrote back to him and said if a foreign
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:39.160]  government says that you're guilty of a serious crime that's enough for me there
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:43.760]  is no need for a trial anymore if they say you're guilty you're guilty and serve
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:47.280]  your sentence like a man because he hadn't been charged with anything he was
[02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:52.760]  just locked up at the whim of some minor communist official in Hungary this is
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:56.160]  the essence of tyranny this is the essence of tyranny and here's my point
[02:16:56.160 --> 02:17:00.720]  then he gets in touch with the member of the UK Independence Party from England
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:05.120]  part of the EU Parliament to show how tyrannical it is when the authority
[02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:09.320]  figure showed up they just released him in a true republic he would have been
[02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:14.160]  charged and a member of Parliament couldn't just do a on-the-spot pardon so
[02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:19.480]  that's prima facie shows the tyranny that they just grabbed him were holding
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:24.560]  him not charging him and the the conservative representative ignored it
[02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:30.160]  the UK Independence Party person went and the communist thugs part of the EU
[02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:34.660]  groveled to his authority and released him showing that it was completely
[02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:38.960]  arbitrary and the way they released him was was very characteristic of the
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:44.560]  communist they just opened the door of the jail one day and booted him up there
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:51.840]  was no prior warning they were going to do this of course the the MEP William
[02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:55.560]  Dartmouth was on the phone every day to them telling them they got to do this
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:58.720]  they just boosted him out the door and slammed it and left him on the street no
[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:03.400]  money no telephone no way of getting in touch with anybody and he had to go and
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:06.960]  beg until he could get somebody to let him have a phone so he could bring home
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:11.240]  and get some money since so he could be flown back I mean it is every aspect of
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:18.280]  this story is profoundly disturbing and it had an electric effect on the
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:22.720]  meeting last night because I asked for a second vote on how many people thought
[02:18:22.720 --> 02:18:27.920]  Britain was a police state and there was only one out of the entire meeting who
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:30.960]  was willing to say that it wasn't a police state in the light of this episode
[02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:35.880]  all the others have changed their minds and once people get to hear that this is
[02:18:35.880 --> 02:18:41.040]  what happens when you don't have a democratic system of government then
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:45.640]  perhaps you people will win its point we will come out of the European Union
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:50.200]  which is not just anti-democratic is irreformably anti-democratic and we
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:53.960]  will once again be the master of our own destiny and never again will a
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:59.160]  British the arbitrary have his door kicked in at 3 in the morning and whisked
[02:18:59.160 --> 02:19:03.800]  off and put on a plane and locked up in some dank miserable communist dungeon
[02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:08.400]  somewhere just on the face of a communist official and without the
[02:19:08.400 --> 02:19:13.840]  slightest right to be heard or even to know what it was for this day he doesn't
[02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:17.200]  know what it was but he was accused of and I can tell you what I'm going to do
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:22.520]  about it sir sir sir it's time for you to leave but do five more minutes we'll
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:26.280]  finish up on this and then get into some of their new attacks on our energy

[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:43.160]  okay thank you very much but but ladies and gentlemen it's the same thing here
[02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:48.360]  now with Obama saying US citizens can be secretly killed secretly extradited
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:53.040]  taken overseas the Congress won't pass the carbon taxes he implements by fiat
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:57.920]  and seizes the power plants this is tyrannous this is tyrannic we'll be
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:20:00.320]  right back

[02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:06.360]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:10.120]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[02:23:10.120 --> 02:23:13.800]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even
[02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:17.080]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:21.160]  again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect

[02:24:03.760 --> 02:24:11.280]  don't worry this show is documented Alex Jones on the GCN radio network I fell
[02:24:11.280 --> 02:24:17.360]  into a burning ring of fire okay my friends Lord Moncton is our guest he was
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:22.200]  pointing out what he's going to do about it imagine foreign incredibly corrupt
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:27.440]  governments that get away with whatever they want the EU backs it order the
[02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:32.280]  British police and they use this this federal commissariat to come grab you
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:36.000]  in the middle of the night only the worst regimes in history did that the
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:39.920]  terror comes at night normally that police pick you up at work pick you up
[02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:43.600]  at that you know when you're walking out to get your car in the morning they
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:48.000]  just walk up soft power here's the warrant police car only the secret
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:52.520]  police and black uniforms kicked down doors the NKVD notice our whole culture
[02:24:52.520 --> 02:24:57.840]  worldwide is shifting to this this is done scientifically Lord Moncton what are
[02:24:57.840 --> 02:25:01.880]  you the former head of the UK Independence Party and of course really
[02:25:01.880 --> 02:25:07.400]  their omnibudsman now running for office for the parliament there in Scotland
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:12.040]  what are you doing to strike a blow because you said 40% didn't think
[02:25:12.040 --> 02:25:16.920]  Britain was a police state 60 did you know a large group of citizens and then
[02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:20.360]  after the story a hundred percent understood when you broke it down what
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:25.520]  is your battle plan battle plan stage one is that once this campaign is over
[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:31.400]  I will be writing an amicus curia brief to the judge in the case telling him a
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:36.960]  that Jason McGoldrick was tortured while he was in prison and by being starved
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:40.720]  and fed this ghastly rented pork fat three times a day and nothing else no
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:46.440]  vegetable no potato not just pork fat three times a day and B that the
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:52.560]  prosecutor effectively lied to the British court by presenting the
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:57.000]  application for a warrant at a time when there is a presumption that he was
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:02.520]  ready to try Mr. McGoldrick but in fact he clearly wasn't as we can prove from
[02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:07.200]  documents that have come to light since so I'm going to tell the judge those two
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:11.040]  things I'm going to say you are not allowed to inquire at the moment when
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:16.520]  the warrant is demanded into any of its circumstances but once you are told
[02:26:16.520 --> 02:26:21.720]  that the warrant was improperly demanded and we can prove that with
[02:26:21.720 --> 02:26:27.760]  documents from Hungary and once you are told that this regime imprisoned this
[02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:33.280]  man in conditions which were inhumane and constituting in UK law torture
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:39.240]  contrary to section 177 of the Criminal Justice Act 1983 that is something of
[02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:44.840]  which the judge cannot but take judicial notice he will have to call the
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:49.560]  Hungarian authorities in front of him in court where I will be putting down a
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:55.760]  motion that the Hungarian Foreign Minister should be subjected to an arrest
[02:26:55.760 --> 02:26:59.800]  warrant for having presided over a regime which condemns torture and brought
[02:26:59.800 --> 02:27:05.040]  over to Britain to stand trial in our criminal court at the Old Bailey for
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:10.280]  torture and that carries life imprisonment that will teach him and by
[02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:15.040]  the way you and your investigations have spent sent a lot of people to prison and
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:19.080]  derailed a lot of criminal actions you're not playing games Lord Moncton so
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:22.960]  more power to you because official oppression the power of a criminal
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:29.520]  judiciary outside of any law will reduce us down to classical absolute
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:36.120]  tyranny and we all must stand together so that free people do not become slaves
[02:27:36.120 --> 02:27:42.000]  of this bureaucracy we only have two minutes left give us a breakdown of the
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:47.080]  globalist ongoing programs to seize control of the global energy system
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:51.480]  well there's still going on and on and on and on about this global warming
[02:27:51.480 --> 02:27:57.680]  nonsense but it's failing we've now had no and I mean no global warming for 10
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:04.840]  long years there was supposed to be 0.5 Fahrenheit of global warming over the
[02:28:04.840 --> 02:28:09.600]  last 10 years according to the UN's climate panel it hasn't happened it
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:13.240]  isn't happening and it now very very clear I've just been studying the
[02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:17.200]  record for the last 60 years changes in greenhouse gases we've been getting the
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:21.800]  latest data putting it in the computer it's absolutely clear that this is not
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:26.800]  happening at anything like the rate they predicted but the other thing that we've
[02:28:26.800 --> 02:28:31.440]  now done with working with international scientists and economists is we worked
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:37.480]  out just how little difference it makes if you for instance have a waxman market
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:43.840]  climate bill and that would cut down five six of you of the US carbon
[02:28:43.840 --> 02:28:47.400]  economy over the next 40 years that figure was in the bill 83% five six
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:52.640]  would have been shut down and that over 40 years would have reduced global
[02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:59.160]  temperature by 0.09 Celsius it would have made hardly any difference and it
[02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:05.240]  would have cost 7.2 trillion dollars that's how absurd all of this is
[02:29:05.240 --> 02:29:09.560]  economically speaking and we're about to publish these results worldwide it's
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:12.200]  going to take a few more weeks to get the peer review into the literature but
[02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:17.160]  we're very close to it now and when everybody sees just how little your
[02:29:17.160 --> 02:29:21.600]  trillions buy when you're trying to stop the temperature rising then they're
[02:29:21.600 --> 02:29:25.680]  just gonna last this whole nonsense out of court and when they do then this

[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:34.400]  this will be the end of the left worldwide if we pay this light it'll be
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:38.320]  the end of dictatorship because they will all remember it was the left it was

[02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:16.880]  by now you should have somehow realized what you gotta do
[02:33:16.880 --> 02:33:23.840]  I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
[02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:36.160]  you know I was just gonna have Lord Moctin on 30 minutes but then he started getting into the
[02:33:37.120 --> 02:33:43.120]  okay being under the EU arrest warrant system and under this UN global system
[02:33:43.120 --> 02:33:49.760]  dictatorships can have you arrested and it's going on it's happening and
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:34:03.520]  torture is condoned all of this and I go back to what I was discussing earlier in the first hour with the confirmed
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:08.160]  I mean the state police in Michigan but it's also going on other areas of the country have
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:13.840]  wireless systems that hack into your phone as you drive by and in seconds because they have the back door
[02:34:13.840 --> 02:34:21.680]  download your user history your photos your passcodes your directory and now when they pull you over for
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:25.520]  speeding whatever they grab your phone plug it in and steal everything off of it
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:31.120]  the TSA is now doing that to more and more people with their laptops and phones sometimes though
[02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:33.760]  they're busy so they just take them and say we'll send it to you in a few months
[02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:40.960]  in some cases you get them a few months later I mean this is off the charts tyranny and it's
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:47.920]  going on everywhere in our society and I just hope people realize this is happening you know
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:53.760]  last Friday we shot a video and then we edited it this week and just put it up at info wars.com
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:35:03.280]  and prisonplanet.com the title of the video is censored video Alex Jones joins the new world order
[02:35:04.720 --> 02:35:10.800]  and it is rated just being up since late last night 16 most viewed today news and politics
[02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:17.280]  11 top favorite news and politics number seven top rated news and politics number 28 top rated this
[02:35:17.280 --> 02:35:21.120]  week news and politics that means it'll go to number one unless they start trying to block it
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:27.440]  and it only says 4173 hits that's because that's what it probably got the first hour it just updates
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:31.920]  late it'll probably be a hundred thousand next time it updates get this video out to everybody
[02:35:31.920 --> 02:35:38.800]  but what's funny is I knew this would happen it says it satire it says it's a joke illustrating
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:44.720]  the absurdity of what's happening in our society and still a bunch of people think it's real and
[02:35:44.720 --> 02:35:48.480]  are freaking out right now and I'm not going to play it on air you got to go watch it if you want
[02:35:48.480 --> 02:35:57.280]  to find out after the show it's up at info wars.com but it it it it looks extreme it looks hard core
[02:35:58.240 --> 02:36:05.760]  it it it it seems absurd what goes on in this video but it turns out you got to go watch it
[02:36:05.760 --> 02:36:10.720]  that it's actually less extreme than what's really going on the government banning dodgeball
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:15.680]  at state and federal level all across the country now going into private schools saying they can't
[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:20.400]  kickball softball the government not letting parents pack lunches for their children saying
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:24.880]  you can't be trusted tsa sticking your their hands down your pants the government stealing
[02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:32.480]  your wireless transmissions this is all going on and this just helped me remember that I briefly
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:39.440]  had the idea earlier in the last hour and only mentioned it once so we may not be successful
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:47.520]  today to do a google search term today now we've been successful over 70 times a couple times we
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:54.000]  haven't hit number one we're unable to search tsa terms those are definitely blocked terms critical
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:59.280]  of the tsa those are blocked we did a test last week twice and they're definitely blocking it we
[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:06.960]  then we did alex jones it went to number one today we're going to do this cops steal cell phone
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:13.120]  that's three words out of our article cops use mobile scanner to steal cell phone data from innocent

[02:37:55.280 --> 02:37:59.360]  to have a demonstration at your church that was unpopular we had to send out cops for security
[02:37:59.360 --> 02:38:04.480]  well i didn't want your security sorry you owe us half a million like with the karan burning preacher
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:11.040]  this is how they're doing it so cops steal cell phone that'll lead folks to the article
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:15.760]  cops use mobile scanner to steal cell phone data from innocent americans i mean your whole
[02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:19.840]  data list they they hack in the phones are built for them to do this and it's going on all over
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:24.560]  the country i've been told by police sources in austin that they're doing this in austin most cops
[02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:31.120]  don't know about it it's special units that have it um this is just incredible now shifting gears
[02:38:31.120 --> 02:38:35.200]  for the rest of the hour we'll probably do five minutes of overdrive or so so we have a full 30
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:43.600]  minute interview with steve watson steve watson joining us uh from the united kingdom is of course
[02:38:43.600 --> 02:38:49.520]  paul watson's brother he has a master's degree in political science uh both of them are great uh
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:55.040]  you know writers very intelligent people and watson his brothers paul's been working with me for
[02:38:55.040 --> 02:39:00.960]  nine years steve i believe it's for about eight now and they just do an exemplary job at prison
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:07.920]  planet dot tv prison planet dot com uh and steve watson joins us to give us his take uh on the fact
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:14.800]  that uh it's now admitted that that the west uh has financed all these rebellions of the middle east
[02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:20.400]  central asia now even the la times is admitting that and they're calling bombs being dropped humanitarian
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:25.360]  and non-military and ground troops that were there from the start now publicly there are thousands
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:31.840]  more landing british us eu as they move forward for the open announcement of ground war calling it a
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:38.720]  peacekeeping force that this is all un nomenclature and if anyone resists them when they're backing
[02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:42.400]  the rebels that are attacking qaddafi's forces the government forces they're going to be called
[02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:48.320]  terrorists we're going to talk about that and then i want to get into royal wedding street party for
[02:39:48.320 --> 02:39:56.080]  republicans is banned by cities in england first the government said the days off when your royal
[02:39:56.080 --> 02:40:01.680]  german family is ruling you you get the day off peasants party in the streets and normally not
[02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:06.960]  allowed for the slaves but then the group that wants to get rid of the royals the other republicans
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:12.560]  said well we're going to demonstrate and they said no not allowed meanwhile britain is criticizing
[02:40:12.560 --> 02:40:18.400]  syria for banning protest or you try to protest outside the capital they'll arrest you see the
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:23.280]  point is its hypocrisy steve watson joining us via video skype from london england thank you for
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:29.920]  coming on with us howdy alex how you doing hey i like that shirt you've got there uh let's uh
[02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:37.600]  think about wearing it for the royal wedding and i go out on the street hey steve uh tell us tell us
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:43.680]  about uh the little story when we visited the tower and we're seeing the royal jewels and there
[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:49.120]  were some brits in there worshiping uh the the royal german family the sax cobert gothers
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:55.840]  like americans worship obama and uh we had a little argument with them didn't we that's right yeah
[02:40:55.840 --> 02:41:02.080]  yeah it's quite a while ago now we went to the tower of london where they like to parade their
[02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:09.840]  um various different torture devices throughout the years and uh we were walking around looking at
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:18.560]  the projected videos of the queen's coronation on the walls looking at the the various jewels that
[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:28.320]  they display for the public um and then you know we kind of expressed a bit of disgust at it all
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:39.200]  as we do and um this lady behind us overheard us and said how dare you criticize your culture
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:46.400]  to which we replied well this isn't really our culture is it this is a culture of days gone by
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:54.160]  i mean call me a a wild eyed radical progressive but um i don't think our head of state should be
[02:41:54.160 --> 02:42:01.040]  selected uh based on whether they came out of the womb of someone who wears a crown and lives in a
[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:08.560]  palace absolutely and then meanwhile the royal family you have is from the continental sax cobert
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:17.040]  gothers that hundreds of years before usurped england invaded england and took the place over
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:22.160]  i mean all the way back to william the conqueror i mean this is a joke i mean ladies and gentlemen
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:28.080]  this is like pygmies with bones in their noses and and and headdresses you've got some swollen old
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:34.960]  decadent crone uh up there who who just neutralized for the third time in three years the canadian
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:39.200]  parliament because they didn't want to follow her orders the truth is they run all this pr how
[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:44.480]  they're powerless and have no power but when i've been in england they shut down half the roads in
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:50.400]  london randomly to let you know she owns the roads and on the tour bus they told us you are arrested
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:56.560]  in england if you talk bad about the queen yeah that's right i mean that's the argument that we're here
[02:42:56.560 --> 02:43:04.560]  over and over again that the royal family is is irrelevant it's purely ceremonial uh has no power
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:10.480]  well if that's the case get rid of it then abolish it because we're still paying you
[02:43:10.480 --> 02:43:17.440]  know billions in taxpayer money into this all the time abolish it get rid of it put the money into
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:21.840]  i don't know put it into education put it into hospitals do something with it because
[02:43:21.840 --> 02:43:27.280]  if it's purely ceremonial then we don't need it do we no we don't in fact we can search this and put
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:32.800]  it on screen last year as tens of thousands of elderly we're literally on the verge of freezing
[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:39.360]  to death and having to ride on buses 24 hours a day to stay warm uh having their welfare stipend
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:44.960]  for natural gas cut it turned out that all the queen's dozens of huge palaces were being heated
[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:50.480]  off of the heating welfare uh fund and and then they also just like the dutch roll family their
[02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:56.400]  cousins hide their wealth uh and it's a state secret uh this is amazing but i noticed steve
[02:43:56.400 --> 02:44:03.920]  you have the queenie over your shoulder there uh i guess that's a sick joke yeah i thought you might
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:08.640]  like it so i put it there i'm gearing up for the royal wedding i'm going to get out there on the
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:14.960]  streets now you're not going to talk bad about your foreign rulers are you well i won't be allowed
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:20.720]  it's banned that's right they in fact it's in the news they're saying if you if you're dare speaking
[02:44:20.720 --> 02:44:27.600]  in any way wrong the royal personages you'll be instantly seized because england is so free
[02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:35.120]  that's right i mean right what's happening is for those that don't know this is next week next
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:43.440]  friday the royal wedding wills good wills and kate get married right so everyone in the country
[02:44:43.440 --> 02:44:49.200]  has got the day off and what they've got to do is get out into the streets have a big table set up
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:54.080]  with lots of nice cupcakes with the faces on and stuff like that that's all great the prime minister
[02:44:54.080 --> 02:45:01.280]  says we've got to go and do that but there's a few people in this country that don't really agree with
[02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:07.920]  having a monarchy anymore and they've expressed the opinion that they'd like to have you know a little
[02:45:07.920 --> 02:45:13.680]  sort of not a celebration just a little party of their own to just say you know we don't really
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:19.360]  support this but it turns out that uh there's not going to be allowed to do that because
[02:45:19.360 --> 02:45:26.880]  the local councils are banning it and let me read a quote for you from uh from news article about this
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:31.680]  it was a group a group called republic obviously they're in the traditional sense of the word they're
[02:45:31.680 --> 02:45:38.480]  republicans in this country they don't believe in a monarchy they wanted to have a party but
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:45.120]  they applied to the council to just make it all legit and everything uh the council replied back
[02:45:45.120 --> 02:45:50.240]  saying that they couldn't have a party because they've failed to provide an adequate management plan
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:57.360]  which is you know really that's what so using bureaucracy as a way the communist chinese
[02:45:57.360 --> 02:46:02.800]  has sent in the troops but if you now try to have that party they will send in the paramilitary police
[02:46:03.600 --> 02:46:08.560]  and expanding on that i've seen it in the uk news that they may ban protesting period now
[02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:15.440]  in the uk and similar things are now going on here in the united states paul steve well yeah
[02:46:15.440 --> 02:46:20.960]  they've i mean they've already banned protest around you know the most politically sensitive
[02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:27.440]  areas of london you can't you can't hold a protest without first applying to west minster council
[02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:32.800]  and uh stating what your protest is going to be about and how many people are going to be there
[02:46:32.800 --> 02:46:40.720]  etc etc for anything at all you know there was someone who was famously arrested for reading out the
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:46.480]  names of soldiers that had been killed in iraq from a newspaper that it was printed in that day
[02:46:46.480 --> 02:46:50.880]  they were arrested straight away and that's the kind of thing that goes on but let me read this quote
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:56.880]  about the royal parties because this is what this is what the council wrote back to the uh the group
[02:46:56.880 --> 02:47:06.160]  republic of course we do not consider this to be this event to be a community festival stroke party
[02:47:06.160 --> 02:47:12.240]  the purpose of such is to draw the community together in an act of celebration stroke oneness
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:19.520]  it's very likely that this event is not or would not be supported by the majority of the community
[02:47:20.080 --> 02:47:26.400]  indeed it does not serve to engage the community in any way so that's why you can't hold
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:32.960]  a republican arrogant read me the mainstream headline out of that what an arrogant thing
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:40.800]  saying the community i mean just throwing it in your face the headline is um not the royal
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:46.240]  wedding street party banned by camden council all right now let's expand on that you're wearing the
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:52.880]  answer to 1984 it's 1776 you're in airstrip one a lot of people are like why is this
[02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:58.480]  british guy that's like a dallas cowboy who lives in dallas you know wearing a red skin shirt the
[02:47:58.480 --> 02:48:03.680]  truth is if you study history the parliament didn't vote to have war with the other british citizens
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:08.480]  the colonists and then the king had to write in and give a rare speech king george the third
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:12.080]  and he wasn't liked by the way because he was you know can hardly even speak english he was so
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:18.240]  german and they got upset about that but he demanded they do it so they went ahead with the war
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:22.960]  and so people think that it was the british hating america the united states colonies were
[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:29.520]  predominantly british and of course were british ruled and so we need to have the spirit of 1776
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:34.640]  over there i think we should launch an operation against this tyranny and everybody should hang
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:43.760]  up the answer to 1984 is 1776 or just wear 1776 shirts 1776 uh signs i mean who says the brits
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:49.600]  can't continue what we did i mean absolutely let's run them back to the continent of europe
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:53.440]  and they don't want them there either a little bit let's run them back to their german castles
[02:48:53.440 --> 02:48:59.520]  what do you say paul steve well i mean that's right i mean you sound nothing like your brother but
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:05.760]  i'd hardly ever interview you so i keep saying much better looking as well go ahead go ahead paul
[02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:12.160]  steve paul steve steve wants to join us go ahead look there's in this country there's a massive
[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:18.960]  amount of people that are against the monarchy and it was only a few years ago that there were tv
[02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:25.120]  debates and you know public votes about abolishing it all together yeah now we're now we're in a
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:31.440]  situation where next friday we're expected to line the streets and and have parades and stuff and
[02:49:31.440 --> 02:49:37.760]  i don't know why all of this has been forgotten so quickly i mean like you said they're not
[02:49:39.040 --> 02:49:44.400]  they're not even english let's not mention the fact that they're german they changed their name to
[02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:50.560]  the house of windsor to san war english at the beginning of the 20th century george the fifth
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:57.600]  did so i mean there's there's a massive movement in this country to just get rid of well why can't
[02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:04.240]  i come there and be the king of england i mean i'm more more uh you know britannic you know jones
[02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:10.560]  then then then the gothas can i come and be your king everybody worship me right i mean you can have
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:16.960]  a go i'm sure i'm sure you could set up your own little stall on the streets maybe i can invade uh like
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:23.280]  they did hundreds of years ago and take over and you can have a texas king and that's that's not as
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:29.200]  strange as having a german king is it no it's pretty much the same would you like me to be your king
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:35.840]  would you like to eat cupcakes and stuff with my wife's picture on it and that sounds normal that's

[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:12.960]  told by the mainstream media the primary instinct of unemployed americans is to go to college and
[02:52:12.960 --> 02:52:17.920]  seek a higher education but all across america students are graduating with hundreds of thousands
[02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:22.720]  of dollars in debt and no jobs most college graduates are now admitting that they would have
[02:52:22.720 --> 02:52:27.680]  been better off getting a job at walmart or mcdonald's than having their lives destroyed by student

[02:54:30.160 --> 02:54:34.720]  or go a little bit into overdrive into the next hour i want to get his take on liby and some other
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:42.720]  issues but i've seen the polls of over 80 percent of brits and the health service the doctors they've
[02:54:42.720 --> 02:54:47.840]  come out and said yes princess diana was murdered and she even told her butler and made a videotape
[02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:52.720]  the government sees in a diary that charles said he was going to kill her in a fake car accident
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:57.360]  that's intelligence agency's favorite way to kill you and then there's all the rest of the evidence
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:02.640]  it goes on for hours the government still laughs at people but this old story of killing the brood
[02:55:02.640 --> 02:55:10.560]  mother after she's had the kids is really nothing new and our people placing bets on how long
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:18.160]  uh the new uh princess uh wife is is is going to be alive over there steve
[02:55:19.920 --> 02:55:25.440]  i don't know if they're placing bets but uh i mean it's all very similar it's all history repeat in
[02:55:25.440 --> 02:55:32.240]  itself uh she's even got diana's ring uh that's what they're using for the wedding which is very
[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:38.640]  symbolic in itself um i mean i haven't i don't spend a lot of time reading into that kind of thing
[02:55:38.640 --> 02:55:46.640]  but uh i know people think that's very a very important symbolic thing but like i mean the royal
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:54.560]  family like we said they're still very powerful in this country they still own more than half the
[02:55:54.560 --> 02:56:02.400]  land in this country that they just simply seized from the people it's propaganda that that they
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:09.280]  don't have power anymore that's a that's a psi off they put out exactly and like you said just
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:14.320]  the other week just last week i think the queen dissolves the canadian parliament she's still the
[02:56:14.320 --> 02:56:19.520]  head of state in canada and australia canada's parliament was dissolved last week and that's
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:26.320]  not ceremonial by the way i mean she owns that country yeah the prime minister effectively said
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:31.200]  right i want to i want to start this but i want to dissolve this parliament and have an election
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:36.160]  because basically he's not going to get back in if he continues to seize out the the term of the
[02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:41.360]  government so he who did he go to went to the queen and asked the queen to dissolve the parliament
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:47.600]  that's exactly what the queen did so you know and that can happen in this country the queen can
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:53.920]  just replace our government anytime she pleases but she doesn't have any power well that's that's
[02:56:53.920 --> 02:56:59.280]  the smoke and mirrors isn't it and the bombardment of libya is not a war and the ground troops are
[02:56:59.280 --> 02:57:02.960]  not ground troops they pledge no ground troops even though ground troops were already there
[02:57:03.680 --> 02:57:09.200]  what's what's your take on that steve well the ground troops i mean
[02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:16.800]  yesterday the british government said that they were sending in scout parties that are not ground
[02:57:16.800 --> 02:57:23.040]  troops they're help teams they're there to help the rebels so i mean that's more or welly and
[02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:29.760]  doublespeak we're not we're not at war with libya we are a kinetic military action we're engaging
[02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:34.400]  in kinetic military action we're not engaging war we're not sending in ground troops we're sending
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:42.640]  in help squads um what else we've got the e you that wants to send in a thousand troops and last
[02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:49.600]  time i checked the e you didn't doesn't even have a standing army so basically every single member
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:55.040]  state of the e you is going to be beholden to sending in troops should it be judged by the
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:59.840]  u n should it be given authority how about we send in herman von rumpi and people haven't we put a
[02:57:59.840 --> 02:58:03.920]  pack on his back and send him in against qaddafi because you know at least the old kings the old
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:08.320]  tyrants would take the field and chop people up and they got power the old-fashioned way
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:16.400]  we're ruled by a bunch of chicken neck bloodsuckers exactly i mean this it's not there are people
[02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:21.120]  within the e you and our national governments that don't support this i mean the french foreign
[02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:28.960]  minister uh yesterday said it was it was tantamount to military operation which completely violates
[02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:34.480]  and contravenes uh the u n resolution that they keep bringing up and going over stay there extremists
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:39.440]  you don't want to bow down to that old murderous witch queen elizabeth the second i do mean number

[03:01:24.800 --> 03:01:31.440]  bank within days of the military action over there and they're doing it for geopolitical
[03:01:31.440 --> 03:01:37.360]  strategic reasons and it's they all they all overflow overflow each other i mean they're
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:42.400]  stoking up a civil war over there which is exactly what they did in iraq it's the same
[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:49.600]  operation of course it's the other day it came out that the conspiracy theorists that said the
[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:56.480]  iraq war was about securing the country so that the oil mega corporations could go in suck out
[03:01:56.480 --> 03:02:03.760]  the reserves it turns out they were right through cables that were released that that proved that
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:12.720]  five months before iraq the british government was meeting with bp and shell to lobby the bush
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:19.760]  administration to get them a piece of the jigsaw over there it's the exactly the same in libya
[03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:31.680]  libya's got the largest proven oil reserves in north africa and of course in 2009 gadafi proposed
[03:02:31.680 --> 03:02:38.080]  nationalizing it all which is uh obviously poison talk to the globalist interests that's
[03:02:38.080 --> 03:02:45.680]  want to get in there get a piece of that for themselves um they had a national central bank
[03:02:45.680 --> 03:02:52.800]  as well which is a very rare thing uh these days normally it's all owned by corporate shareholders
[03:02:53.600 --> 03:02:59.760]  who own all the mega corporations the oil companies as well libya had its own national bank
[03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:08.720]  it had its own currency which i'm sure will be swiftly replaced and the country will be flooded
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:16.080]  with uh worthless dollars and oh yeah the east is already setting up its own central bank currency
[03:03:16.080 --> 03:03:23.280]  and oil company and they're not wasting time no exactly i'm sure we'll see rapid inflation there
[03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:32.800]  which uh will counteract the fact that they've got libya has um vast reserves of gold to back up
[03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:38.160]  their national currency from the poorest to the richest in 40 years they don't like it and they're
[03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:43.360]  going to wreck it and roll in with the un and special injections for the population that's
[03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:49.040]  tripled they've got special shots for them steve they are about this what's this oh well you know
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:54.480]  once the globalists take over they've got special u n shots filled with sterilization hormones oh yeah
[03:03:54.480 --> 03:03:59.600]  well i mean that's what they do but i mean what you got to do is just look at a map
[03:04:01.120 --> 03:04:10.960]  um you've got libya egypt on one side you've got iraq syria afghanistan pakistan on the other
[03:04:10.960 --> 03:04:16.160]  in the middle of that you've got iran that's in the offing for them as well down the bottom you've
[03:04:16.160 --> 03:04:26.400]  got yemen somalia um sudan and then once you've democratized all those countries uh you basically
[03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:32.240]  surround russia and china so that's the other reason why we're seeing what was seen in libya
[03:04:32.240 --> 03:04:36.800]  at the moment and by the way in closing they're not democratizing them they've now banned any
[03:04:36.800 --> 03:04:42.080]  protest in egypt and they're putting in the democratizing yes absolutely enslaving them
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:46.800]  steve watson also known as paul watson joking folks they are two brothers over at uh prison
