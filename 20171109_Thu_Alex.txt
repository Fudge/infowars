[00:00.000 --> 00:25.100]  You want to stop tyranny? Well so does he. Live from the Infowars.com Studios, it's
[00:25.100 --> 00:46.700]  Alex Jones. Thursday, the ninth day of November 2017, we're now close to 30 hours in to the
[00:46.700 --> 00:53.360]  worldwide broadcast that we launched yesterday morning at 8am. I'm going to be here for the
[00:53.360 --> 01:00.220]  next four hours and we've got Owen Schreuer who will complete the 34 hour global transmission.
[01:00.220 --> 01:04.380]  Then Lord Willing will be back tomorrow at 8am with a kickoff of Real News with David
[01:04.380 --> 01:12.180]  Knight and of course Infowars Live. There's truly Alex Jones. About a month ago, the
[01:12.180 --> 01:18.560]  Huffington Post attacked me for saying that in Hollywood, they have lesbian groups that
[01:18.560 --> 01:24.460]  pose as feminist organizations to lure young women into them and that the women are basically
[01:24.460 --> 01:32.420]  kept slaves. And they said this was a horrible, vile thing. The headline was Alex Jones, Harvey
[01:32.420 --> 01:37.620]  Weinstein comments are vile beyond belief. Well, I mean, I read the police reports that
[01:37.620 --> 01:43.460]  get swept under the rug and I have sources around the world. And movies like Hostel are
[01:43.460 --> 01:56.060]  real. They're basically documentaries in film format. Girl with the dragon tattoo, all
[01:56.060 --> 02:02.660]  that kind of stuff. That's what's going on. A lot of rich people's houses down in basements.
[02:02.660 --> 02:05.820]  There are millions and millions of missing people every year in every major country and
[02:05.820 --> 02:10.340]  they say, oh, they're runaways or they change their identity. Yeah, maybe 60% or so it turns
[02:10.340 --> 02:20.220]  out. But the tens of millions that never get found folks go into acid baths. Now that's
[02:20.220 --> 02:27.940]  what I talked about. Well, when you study this, there's a lot of other groups that kind
[02:27.940 --> 02:32.900]  of mimic it, but they don't do the killing part because they know a lot of people want
[02:32.900 --> 02:40.320]  to be in a cult type situation. There's that area in the human mind. And so you're starting
[02:40.320 --> 02:45.540]  to hear more and more about this coming out where there'll be gyms where people work out
[02:45.540 --> 02:50.940]  that also have a sex cult angle to them and where everybody's shaman and, you know, take
[02:50.940 --> 02:58.700]  drugs to open up their consciousness and that's going on all over the world. And so it shades
[02:58.700 --> 03:07.140]  of gray into where all that goes. But usually you'll find an intelligence agency spinoff
[03:07.140 --> 03:18.140]  group that is basically running mind control operations through those organizations because
[03:18.140 --> 03:28.900]  people in sociopathic mindsets and psychopathic mindsets crave control over others. The big
[03:28.900 --> 03:36.180]  Nazi rallies at night, the porches and everyone marching in formation in North Korea. It's
[03:36.180 --> 03:42.100]  the same thing. It's those psychopaths and sociopaths that crave that and they're always
[03:42.100 --> 03:50.400]  trying to build it. And then they hate any other thought system that isn't centralized
[03:50.400 --> 03:57.180]  and they wage war against it. And that's why there's war against Christianity that's an
[03:57.180 --> 04:04.500]  admitted war against Christianity that's going on is because for bad or worse, there are
[04:04.500 --> 04:10.020]  a lot of bad permutations of Christianity, manmade control systems and cults. But the
[04:10.020 --> 04:16.980]  overall operating system of it and the spirit of it is not compatible with the kingdom of
[04:16.980 --> 04:24.500]  the cults new order model. Now, you suddenly see it all over the news from LA to New York.
[04:24.500 --> 04:31.020]  Feminist cults where women are slaves and then a man runs it. Finally, the doors swing
[04:31.020 --> 04:40.020]  open and there's Dracula that he sends his women out to recruit other women. And you've
[04:40.020 --> 04:48.780]  got this in XIVM group up in New York. This is the child's play organization. It's a pretend
[04:48.780 --> 04:51.740]  group of some of the real ones that are out there, but we're going to tell you about it
[04:51.740 --> 04:58.940]  when we come back. Stay with us.
[04:58.940 --> 05:04.060]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message. Secret 12,
[05:04.060 --> 05:09.420]  40% off the best vitamin B12 out there for my research. Take it under the tongue. Simply
[05:09.420 --> 05:15.220]  amazing. That sale is continuing. Supermell, vitality for stamina, libido, energy, that's
[05:15.220 --> 05:20.140]  30% off. That's continuing. And the other really, really good news is that, yes, we're
[05:20.140 --> 05:26.820]  having to end the sale of 50% off on Anthroplex, but DNA force after almost four months, out
[05:26.820 --> 05:33.500]  of stock is back in stock. 25% off our flagship product. Also biome defense, the great probiotic,
[05:33.500 --> 05:38.380]  that is 25% off as well. So a lot of things are selling out, but a lot of things are still
[05:38.380 --> 05:44.140]  at record sales like silver bullets, super high quality colloidal silver is still 50%
[05:44.140 --> 05:48.740]  off. And there's other sales that are still going, but they're all about to end, whether
[05:48.740 --> 05:53.020]  it's DNA force, whether it's silver bullet, it's all available right now at info wars
[05:53.020 --> 06:00.020]  life.com or by calling toll free triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[06:23.020 --> 06:30.020]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance.
[06:37.580 --> 06:44.580]  You're listening to Alex Jones. We are now 27 hours into the global 34 hour marathon
[06:44.580 --> 06:49.380]  transmission celebrating the one year anniversary that is now came and gone of the election
[06:49.380 --> 06:54.780]  of Donald John Trump. We're going to look at how they're trying to spin two blue states
[06:54.780 --> 07:01.300]  going blue again as the end of populism worldwide. Yes, rumors of our demise has been greatly
[07:01.300 --> 07:07.340]  exaggerated. We've got new big breaking news saying exactly what I told you on air five
[07:07.340 --> 07:12.140]  years ago and a month ago. I even have the Huffington Post attacking me saying that there
[07:12.140 --> 07:18.780]  are feminist groups that really lure women into dungeons and enslave them for men. And
[07:18.780 --> 07:25.780]  it's all over the news today. How interesting. Inside the terrifying slave cult where women
[07:28.460 --> 07:33.580]  including a Hollywood actress are forced to hand over naked pictures, get branded with
[07:33.580 --> 07:38.780]  the founders initials and are beaten with paddles and forced to recruit other women
[07:38.780 --> 07:45.780]  as quote slaves. And they first get into it as a women's empowerment women only feminist
[07:45.780 --> 07:52.780]  organization. Yeah, there are a lot of lesbian women that want their own harems. And I don't
[07:57.220 --> 08:01.500]  attack lesbians. I understand they've got good taste. The point is, is that they don't
[08:01.500 --> 08:07.780]  get to engage in any behavior they want because they're quote the protected class. And I told
[08:07.780 --> 08:14.780]  you behind every lesbian cult, there is a count Dracula in the shadows. And that's exactly
[08:19.200 --> 08:26.200]  what all these articles coming off say. Though feminist sex cults that women thought was
[08:26.200 --> 08:33.200]  women empowerment. And then they find out, oh, we serve the man you call him master.
[08:38.600 --> 08:45.600]  And Hollywood and 50 shades of gray is all just a primer to get you in those handcuffs
[08:46.840 --> 08:53.840]  the first couple times. And sometimes, like I said, a month ago and got attacked by George
[08:53.840 --> 09:00.840]  Soros, his outfit he originally funded, Ariana Huffington. Like you don't expel the girls.
[09:02.880 --> 09:08.880]  You don't tell the girls it's not sexy to go in those dungeons. You don't touch our
[09:08.880 --> 09:16.880]  favorite thing. You don't tell them it's dangerous Jones, shut up. Oh, but I'm proven right again.
[09:16.880 --> 09:23.880]  And I'm not saying this cult and it clearly is that the police are investigating and hundreds
[09:23.880 --> 09:30.880]  of women, reportedly, many of us masses have escaped. And it's always some little narcissistic
[09:31.760 --> 09:38.760]  power tripping sociopath slash psychopath who wants to be God and needs people to grovel
[09:38.760 --> 09:47.760]  before them. Anyone who was really successful and powerful would be ashamed of something
[09:47.760 --> 09:54.760]  like that and would want to empower people. But modern feminism is a creation of Edward
[09:56.200 --> 10:02.200]  Brunay's and the Department of War and the Ford and Carnegie Endowment starting in the
[10:02.200 --> 10:09.200]  1920s. And it's all declassified. And it's meant to do one thing and one thing only.
[10:10.800 --> 10:16.640]  And that is to debase women and the family in their own admissions. And they have done
[10:16.640 --> 10:23.640]  a spectacular job. Men are drooling idiots trying to act tough. Women run around confused
[10:23.640 --> 10:30.640]  as angry tarts. The children wander the wilderness of the Internet and television being bombarded
[10:30.640 --> 10:37.640]  by Viacom and other weaponized media to destroy their attention spans, fry their brains and
[10:38.640 --> 10:45.640]  turn them into jibbering mental patients. Because if they can't get your child, they
[10:45.640 --> 10:52.640]  want them physically. They're going to get them there mentally. They're going to get
[10:52.640 --> 10:59.640]  them through the whole medical system as well. So that's all coming up today. And we've
[10:59.640 --> 11:05.640]  just got the video of where I warned the women. You think you're joining a feminist group.
[11:05.640 --> 11:11.640]  And these are really women that desire to dominate other people. They want to dominate
[11:11.640 --> 11:18.640]  other people. But they've always got a man in the background running the show. And again
[11:22.640 --> 11:28.640]  people are trying to set these up everywhere. Every two-blit know-it-all shaman who takes
[11:28.640 --> 11:33.640]  ayahuasca or, you know, all this other stuff and then decides that they have interfaced
[11:33.640 --> 11:39.640]  with God and that they are this big leader. It's everywhere in Austin. Almost every gym
[11:39.640 --> 11:45.640]  and group is really a front for people taking a bunch of hallucinogens and having some
[11:45.640 --> 11:51.640]  guru. And the women get enlightened by having sex with the guru. And it's just come on
[11:51.640 --> 12:04.640]  people. And these nerds, they just sit around and decide how to set up cults. That's what
[12:04.640 --> 12:14.640]  they do. And it's all a big joke to them. Well, I'm setting up a cult. It's the cult of the
[12:14.640 --> 12:20.640]  individual and the cult of real empowerment. There's no meetings. There's no groups with
[12:20.640 --> 12:30.640]  me. I go home alone. There's no church of Alex Jones. That's why they hate my gut so
[12:30.640 --> 12:37.640]  bad. See, I am fulfilled. I have a mission. I am enlightened. I know what's going on.
[12:37.640 --> 12:44.640]  I know when they take these hardcore hallucinogens that do break interdimensionally through
[12:44.640 --> 12:48.640]  into the levels you experience in deep sleep and that you're actually conscious within your
[12:48.640 --> 12:55.640]  unconscious that you then see across the void and see that time space is filled with other
[12:55.640 --> 13:02.640]  entities. And of course, they always tell you you're God because you're with them and
[13:02.640 --> 13:07.640]  you're all powerful and you're going to tell everybody what to do. And it's pure lower
[13:07.640 --> 13:17.640]  dimensional Satanism. That's all it is. And it's the New Age Weapon Program. It's the
[13:17.640 --> 13:24.640]  CIA hallucinogen program rolled out on the streets against the people. You can argue
[13:24.640 --> 13:33.640]  well, you can be enlightened with hallucinogens. Undoubtedly. But the issue is not in a cult
[13:33.640 --> 13:39.640]  with them spiritually manipulating it and amplifying it and bringing it in to their
[13:39.640 --> 13:44.640]  system. You don't want to be around that or involved with that. And just like the Bible
[13:44.640 --> 13:50.640]  says, pharmacia and sorcery is the way to being enslaved. And it always leads there.
[13:50.640 --> 13:58.640]  It's always about some person that thinks they're God ruling over you and setting up a
[13:58.640 --> 14:05.640]  little petty kingdom because the devil couldn't have it in heaven. And he wants to have it
[14:05.640 --> 14:12.640]  here and all of his slaves are the same little self centered wimps running around seeking
[14:12.640 --> 14:19.640]  for power. And as they join with the great oneness of the universe, the little devil
[14:19.640 --> 14:25.640]  on their shoulder when they're absolutely taking more DMT than you released when you
[14:25.640 --> 14:31.640]  die, you're having a near death experience. And the little demons right there telling
[14:31.640 --> 14:36.640]  you it's God and you're God and everything and feel all this, feel the timelessness,
[14:36.640 --> 14:44.640]  feel all everything else. That's you. That's me. Me, me, me, me, me, me. And then people
[14:44.640 --> 14:49.640]  come out and go, I'm a God. I'm a shaman. I'm on a power trip. And you're just like,
[14:49.640 --> 14:55.640]  man, give me a break. You're running a program that was put in your mind when you got spirit
[14:55.640 --> 15:04.640]  guided, lured in to a black magic ritual and didn't even know what you were part of.
[15:04.640 --> 15:12.640]  See, I don't need DMT to go where you go. I can go there anytime I want. And that's why
[15:12.640 --> 15:16.640]  the globalists hate me because they know I'm right there staring right back at them the
[15:16.640 --> 15:21.640]  whole time. But so is everybody else. That's why they want to hurt your consciousness.
[15:21.640 --> 15:25.640]  That's why they want to inject you with heavy metals. It's why they want to fry your brain.
[15:25.640 --> 15:32.640]  It's why they want to control you and absolutely suppress you because they want to artificially
[15:32.640 --> 15:38.640]  bring you into a new reality they're constructing within reality as a prison. And they don't
[15:38.640 --> 15:47.640]  want you to ever know you entered into it. And they hate Christian churches because real
[15:47.640 --> 15:54.640]  people lovingly get together and love each other and feel God and amplify that. And that's
[15:54.640 --> 15:59.640]  like nails on a chalkboard to these devil.
[15:59.640 --> 16:04.640]  Hello, Mr. Anderson. The NSA has noticed how much time you spend on conservative news sites.

[20:17.640 --> 20:43.640]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from Austin, Texas,
[20:43.640 --> 20:59.640]  broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[20:59.640 --> 21:06.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide. Let me just mention some of the news coming up.
[21:06.640 --> 21:16.640]  We have C. Bell Edmonds, a high level certified FBI NSA whistleblower that ran translations
[21:16.640 --> 21:25.640]  in Arabic and Farsi for Special Forces Operations, Special Forces Command, the CIA, you name
[21:25.640 --> 21:30.640]  it. And she's joining us in the next hour. Now we had another whistleblower on this week
[21:30.640 --> 21:34.640]  and the FBI came and picked him up and took him to a military base. And he's asked us
[21:34.640 --> 21:38.640]  not to give out his name and info yet, but he's been a well-known person in the intelligence
[21:38.640 --> 21:44.640]  community about Saudi Arabia's connection to Vegas, Saudi Arabia's connection in their
[21:44.640 --> 21:49.640]  Civil War to new attacks coming. Well, C. Bell Edmonds can talk about that, but also how
[21:49.640 --> 21:55.640]  Mueller is involved with the Gulan movement and others and a big cover-up happening there.
[21:55.640 --> 22:00.640]  And by the way, every time we recover this, we get hack attacks, threats. I mean, this
[22:00.640 --> 22:05.640]  is a powerful group. And I'm not in the middle of it with eargun or the Gulan movement. I
[22:05.640 --> 22:11.640]  know they hate each other. It's a very complex situation. And I did know about Michael Flynn
[22:11.640 --> 22:18.640]  and stuff that was going on a year ago with this. And Flynn was siding with the United
[22:18.640 --> 22:25.640]  States for our sovereignty and our security, exposing the Gulan network. And that's what
[22:25.640 --> 22:33.640]  Mueller's now got is that General Flynn was out of the military talking to the Turkish
[22:33.640 --> 22:37.640]  government and others about terror networks and other organizations here in the U.S.,
[22:37.640 --> 22:43.640]  give the guy a Medal of Freedom Award. Don't put him in jail. Of course, the former had
[22:43.640 --> 22:49.640]  a defense intelligence. Think he knows what's going on? By the way, who do you think he
[22:49.640 --> 22:58.640]  knew? And people listen to me not because they're even learning anything. People at that level
[22:58.640 --> 23:03.640]  go, wow, why is that the only show that knows what's going on? And how does that guy know
[23:03.640 --> 23:08.640]  all this? I had the FBI call up a few weeks ago and just go, how did you do what you did
[23:08.640 --> 23:16.640]  on Vegas? Where I said, I think they'll attack at 10 o'clock at night in the next few days.
[23:16.640 --> 23:20.640]  And I just said, you know, there's a lot of factors going to that. They said, uh-huh,
[23:20.640 --> 23:24.640]  a lot of factors. We don't think you're involved, but this is getting weird. So I had a discussion
[23:24.640 --> 23:28.640]  with some folks about it. I just told them really how to calculate the cabbage. But I'm
[23:28.640 --> 23:32.640]  going to leave that alone at this point. This is the real world, though, here, ladies and
[23:32.640 --> 23:39.640]  gentlemen. This isn't a game. It's not a joke. And we have terror networks in this country
[23:39.640 --> 23:44.640]  that are run by the Deep State Breakaway Group. You don't think Obama and Hillary and the
[23:44.640 --> 23:48.640]  socialist and all of them just started the Arab Spring and killed over a million people,
[23:48.640 --> 23:52.640]  hundreds of thousands of them Christians and displaced millions and invaded Europe with
[23:52.640 --> 23:57.640]  jihad armies, military H-men, 8 million of them, other 2 million were women and children.
[23:57.640 --> 24:00.640]  You don't think they just did that by accident and you don't think they're just going to
[24:00.640 --> 24:08.640]  give up launching ICBMs at Saudi Arabia out of Yemen, all hell breaking loose. They've
[24:08.640 --> 24:16.640]  got stay-behind networks, sleeper cells in this country. And the word is from our sources
[24:16.640 --> 24:22.640]  is they've basically been activated and been prepared. And it's such a hot subject within
[24:22.640 --> 24:27.640]  two hours of our guests, not even saying his full name on air, the FBI came and grabbed
[24:27.640 --> 24:32.640]  him. And the media spun it and said, oh, Jones claims he's got another source. Yeah,
[24:32.640 --> 24:39.640]  like I said, well, the president says that he's looking to release it. Same day they
[24:39.640 --> 24:43.640]  go, Jones is making it up, Stone's making it up. The president is not releasing it.
[24:43.640 --> 24:49.640]  President tweets the next day, I am releasing the JFK false. I mean, come on, folks. The
[24:49.640 --> 24:53.640]  issue here isn't about who's right and who's wrong. We know who's right. We know who told
[24:53.640 --> 24:59.640]  you Hillary had health problems is now confirmed, not in Brazil. It's about stopping the terror
[24:59.640 --> 25:05.640]  attacks. And it's about realizing there's a civil war within the government going on.
[25:05.640 --> 25:10.640]  So Sabelle Edmonds is joining us in the next hour. Shepard Ambulance is going to be back
[25:10.640 --> 25:20.640]  in studio with the latest on his deep investigations of the Saudi military conferences and government
[25:20.640 --> 25:30.640]  conferences that were going on in Vegas on October 1st and all the rest of the story.
[25:30.640 --> 25:38.640]  And that's why the public's not been told what happened there because everything points
[25:38.640 --> 25:45.640]  towards an arms deal that was used as a cover for an assassination operation on some of the
[25:45.640 --> 25:50.640]  princes that were not allied with the Wahhabist and the whole ongoing civil war and helicopters
[25:50.640 --> 25:54.640]  blowing up and people getting killed in their houses and cars blowing up. I mean, every
[25:54.640 --> 26:05.640]  few minutes, it's happening. There is a full on war in Saudi Arabia right now. And remember,
[26:05.640 --> 26:11.640]  what we told you on November 1st, eight days ago, Saudi Arabia connections to Vegas, more
[26:11.640 --> 26:20.640]  attacks could be coming. And now you're starting to see it on the news. And just watch when
[26:20.640 --> 26:32.640]  it comes out. Because the deep state wants to just use this against America and use this
[26:32.640 --> 26:39.640]  against Trump and use this against gun owners and attack churches. And let's look at Devin
[26:39.640 --> 26:48.640]  Patrick Kelly, attacked his wife, attacked his stepchild, fractured the baby skull, came
[26:48.640 --> 26:54.640]  to the base to kill a chain of command, gets thrown in a mental institution, he escapes
[26:54.640 --> 26:59.640]  after months and they don't put out an all points bulletin and they don't put in his
[26:59.640 --> 27:09.640]  file that he was dishonorably discharged so he could illegally get weapons and pop back
[27:09.640 --> 27:14.640]  up with another group of ne'er-do-wells. They've got a whole cell of these guys in Central
[27:14.640 --> 27:25.640]  Texas. I'm going to leave it right there. And if you want to say MKUltra, please do.
[27:25.640 --> 27:37.640]  Because he fits the exact, precise, complete, total cutout of, oh, you want to get sent
[27:37.640 --> 27:43.640]  to a hardcore psych facility? You want to kill the chain of command? And then he's allowed
[27:43.640 --> 27:48.640]  to escape and then they don't try to pick him up and they let him infiltrate back into
[27:48.640 --> 27:53.640]  the public. After he got his electroshock, after he got put on all the drugs, after he
[27:53.640 --> 27:58.640]  got put on his Ibogaine and got put on his ayahuasca and told he was a god and all the
[27:58.640 --> 28:03.640]  rest of the crap and given some women and given some more drugs, I mean they had the
[28:03.640 --> 28:14.640]  ninja 500, 600, 700 years ago just off of opium addiction and sex. They would train for
[28:14.640 --> 28:23.640]  10 years for one assassination and commit seppuku or suicide by driving a short sword into
[28:23.640 --> 28:33.640]  their stomach and pulling it up to their heart. That was Japanese mind control. Imagine what
[28:33.640 --> 28:46.640]  they can do today. But it's incontrovertible that he was allowed to escape and then protect
[28:46.640 --> 28:54.640]  it and stay with us. We are on the march. The empire is on the run. You're listening to
[28:54.640 --> 29:04.640]  the Alex Jones show. We believe in freedom. America needs strong independent families

[34:03.640 --> 34:19.640]  Devin Patrick Kelly was allowed to assault his wife and his stepchild and break their bones.
[34:19.640 --> 34:24.640]  Then when he attacked or tried to attack with firearms the chain of command at a
[34:24.640 --> 34:36.640]  airport space he was sent to a mental institution, a serious facility, a laboratory level facility.
[34:36.640 --> 34:42.640]  We're talking electroshock, we're talking experimentation type facility to look it up.
[34:42.640 --> 34:57.640]  And he then was allowed to flee, not have an APB put out for him, and they never filed the paperwork that he had a dishonorable discharge so he could get firearms.
[34:57.640 --> 35:15.640]  Look at that weak-minded creature, he's got MK Ultra, MK Naomi, Monarch Program, you name it, written all over and those are just declassified mind control programs.
[35:15.640 --> 35:21.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, they've been putting human brains in rats for 30 years.
[35:21.640 --> 35:30.640]  They just announced it yesterday. They've been putting microchips in people's brains for 40 years.
[35:30.640 --> 35:42.640]  And if you don't know they've got mind control down to a fine art, you're living on another planet.
[35:42.640 --> 35:54.640]  The reason I'm saying mind control, this is a deep state shadow government destabilization operation, is because this is exactly what mind control programs have been used for, is assassination operations.
[35:54.640 --> 36:02.640]  And where the disposable individuals don't even know why they're doing it, they are compelled to do it.
[36:02.640 --> 36:11.640]  And the military is heavily into this and you've got shadow groups now working to destabilize the country.
[36:11.640 --> 36:20.640]  And the media will try to make jokes out of this, but the globalists are obsessed with mind control and mind war. It's what they do.
[36:20.640 --> 36:27.640]  And the fact that they didn't put out a warrant for him to be picked up when he's supposedly going to try to kill everybody on the base,
[36:27.640 --> 36:35.640]  and then he flees months later from a mental institution, and then they don't say pick him up, they don't say anything.
[36:35.640 --> 36:41.640]  Years later, he goes and does this and he legally gets firearms because they didn't put him in the database.
[36:41.640 --> 36:49.640]  Bare minimum, they were insanely negligent for their own safety. Don't believe it for a minute.
[36:49.640 --> 37:02.640]  This boy is part of a project, a program, and he got off the reservation a little bit, but he went back into his doctors and he got back on the reservation, didn't he?
[37:02.640 --> 37:08.640]  He was a good boy. He did a good job according to his handlers.
[37:08.640 --> 37:19.640]  And you know, they've got a big nest right here in Central Texas of those. Nice little nest.
[37:19.640 --> 37:30.640]  So, carry your firearms, ladies and gentlemen, because you never know when a wound up pedophile devil worshiper is going to come walking through your door.
[37:30.640 --> 37:37.640]  And it turns out he's a pedophile. Turns out he hates Christians. Turns out he's into the occult.
[37:37.640 --> 37:45.640]  As I told you, most of these atheists that are anti-Christian, they're crypto-Satanist.
[37:45.640 --> 37:49.640]  Just like the anarchists are really communists, but they go, oh, communism doesn't exist.
[37:49.640 --> 37:54.640]  They've all got, you know, Mao and Lenin tattoos, and we're red guard. We're going to kill you.
[37:54.640 --> 38:02.640]  They're like, oh, just last year, you're anarchists. That's right. Now it's revolution. Scum. And we love Satan.
[38:02.640 --> 38:08.640]  And they're just the perfect people to be inducted into drugs and hypnotism and electroshock and programming.
[38:08.640 --> 38:17.640]  And then you can just tell them, you're a God. Here's your program terms. Here, take this. Boom.
[38:17.640 --> 38:22.640]  Just like Sirhan Sirhan was drugged in front of people, given an amnesiac. He was just the diversion.
[38:22.640 --> 38:26.640]  And then in comes the windup toy.
[38:26.640 --> 38:38.640]  They found Tim McVeigh drooling on the side of the road saying it burns. It burns. I've got a chip. They blew my chip up.
[38:38.640 --> 38:45.640]  Because that's what they do.
[38:45.640 --> 38:52.640]  Those old chips, you just wave a de-magnetizer over them and they blow up. They pop because they're transceivers.
[38:52.640 --> 38:59.640]  They receive and transmit. They've got a lot more advanced ones now.
[38:59.640 --> 39:10.640]  There's more than 50,000 people in the U.S. admittedly that got federal grants for advanced brain chips just the last 20 years.
[39:10.640 --> 39:15.640]  They've got a military personnel for PTSD and depression or a brain injury.
[39:15.640 --> 39:20.640]  Oh, we've got something that's going to fix you. And they're just tested on everybody.
[39:20.640 --> 39:26.640]  They've got chips decades ago where you can with a joystick control somebody, have somebody sit down, have them go to the bathroom,
[39:26.640 --> 39:36.640]  have them just joystick around. They had 30 years ago robo-rats that would just had a brain chip and it would just go into rubble with a video camera.
[39:36.640 --> 39:43.640]  You can look all this up. So understand, ladies and gentlemen, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[39:43.640 --> 39:51.640]  You will get chipped eventually, says U.S. today. You will. And ABC News, you will. CBS News, you will.
[39:51.640 --> 39:57.640]  And now Stockholm Syndrome, Stockholm, Sweden. Oh, if you want to get on the train, you get discounts right now.
[39:57.640 --> 40:08.640]  We take the chip, but soon they said officially this year, soon you're going to have to have it because we have identity theft problems and just work with the community.
[40:08.640 --> 40:20.640]  And now more and more companies are making people get them. But again, the CIA told Wash Tech 15 years ago, oh, we're pushing the body modification movement to get people ready for this.
[40:20.640 --> 40:26.640]  And then when the Washington Post shows you the Swedish worker, he's got the big earrings and the body mod, which do that if you want.
[40:26.640 --> 40:34.640]  I'm just saying, you got with the program, didn't you? You got with the program. And then they have the Today Show and all of it.
[40:34.640 --> 40:43.640]  They just laugh and Good Morning America. Oh, it's so much fun. Oh, it's so happy. Everybody's going to get your chips soon.
[40:43.640 --> 40:47.640]  He told you 20 years ago they're coming. They're going to try to make you get chipped. Here's how they're going to roll it out.
[40:47.640 --> 40:53.640]  Oh, Jones is insane. Now, everything we told you again is happening.
[40:53.640 --> 41:02.640]  Oh, and your TV's watching you. Oh, and your phone's tracking you. Oh, oh, oh, and there are cancer viruses in the vaccines. Oh, and, and did we tell you?
[41:02.640 --> 41:08.640]  Did we tell you? And then all these little smiley people, we're going to go along with it because the big corporations give us money.
[41:08.640 --> 41:15.640]  And now Bezos and Buffett and Gates have more money than half the US population.
[41:15.640 --> 41:22.640]  And it turns out there's a bill about to go through where the US government will only order from Amazon.
[41:22.640 --> 41:29.640]  They're going to have special portals that only go to it for government procurement and they'll make 50 plus extra billion a year.
[41:29.640 --> 41:39.640]  And then Bezos can train us all how to be good little slaves. But he's liberal, so it's okay.
[41:39.640 --> 41:44.640]  And that's why they're in economic warfare with us. That's why they don't want us to have websites or have products.
[41:44.640 --> 41:48.640]  And that's why they want to shut us down. That's why they lie about us every day because they want a total monopoly.
[41:48.640 --> 41:54.640]  And Amazon is the company store. Oh, my soul of the company store.
[41:54.640 --> 42:02.640]  Well, they always have free shipping so that everyone just expects free shipping when they get $1.48 government subsidy on every order on shipping.
[42:02.640 --> 42:07.640]  But you don't and I don't. And you think you get ahead by buying something from Amazon.
[42:07.640 --> 42:11.640]  Oh, I don't want to pay for shipping in a full-work store. I want to get my free stuff.
[42:11.640 --> 42:21.640]  Oh, it's free, all right. As free as getting your throat slit and thrown down a well. But Bezos is cute. He's liberal, so it's all right.
[42:21.640 --> 42:27.640]  He'll take real good care of you. Don't worry. Because you're at his cult now.
[42:27.640 --> 42:33.640]  We have free shipping. We don't always do it. But to match the great Amazon, free shipping is not going to last long.

[47:30.640 --> 47:40.640]  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from truth. That you are a slave like everyone else you were born into bondage.

[47:51.640 --> 48:02.640]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your mind.
[48:02.640 --> 48:11.640]  I know why people don't want to admit what's going on. Even though it's all in plain view now.
[48:11.640 --> 48:21.640]  Because it's frightening. I'll tell you, what's more frightening is not doing anything about it. Just giving up.
[48:21.640 --> 48:26.640]  Or just taking on that worldly spirit of laughing about it and making fun of people that care.
[48:26.640 --> 48:32.640]  As if you're part of the power structure because you pretend you are.
[48:32.640 --> 48:51.640]  Useless handmaidens for death. Death that doesn't regenerate. Death that is simply a hate letter to God.
[48:51.640 --> 48:57.640]  I haven't even gotten to the news and it's not for lack of incredibly over the top news.
[48:57.640 --> 49:06.640]  It really is against good and evil. Something I came late to the table on and that was the all out war on Christians and Christmas.
[49:06.640 --> 49:10.640]  I knew there was persecution of Christians and I knew that the communists had banned it.
[49:10.640 --> 49:18.640]  But I would hear 20 years ago people calling and going, we're mad about the war on Christmas and there's so many nativity scenes.
[49:18.640 --> 49:22.640]  And I'm like, yeah, that's just mentally ill atheists and people wanting to be in the paper.
[49:22.640 --> 49:28.640]  Then I found that it was coordinated worldwide. And now even the UN admits double the amount of Christian persecution.
[49:28.640 --> 49:35.640]  There was just a decade ago, they said last year. I mean, it's millions of Christians, two plus million are killed a year.
[49:35.640 --> 49:42.640]  I mean, it is just Holocaust level every day. But Hollywood isn't going to say a word about it.
[49:42.640 --> 49:47.640]  They did do the Armenian genocide, which Hollywood did do the right thing on that.
[49:47.640 --> 49:54.640]  I can always get reprieved, but not much, but to start something.
[49:54.640 --> 50:01.640]  But see, I was against all these Middle East wars because I knew the globalists wanted to put in radical regimes that he stabilized things, which has been proven right.
[50:01.640 --> 50:05.640]  And Trump was against that, showing that he was right.
[50:05.640 --> 50:16.640]  But it's the anti-Christian nature. I see articles every year in Texas even where little kids will hand out Christmas cards and the teachers expel them.
[50:16.640 --> 50:24.640]  That's religious. Well, you have your free speech. Doesn't mean the school that's state funded, citizen funded, has an official religion.
[50:24.640 --> 50:32.640]  I agree with that. It shouldn't. Separation of church and state. I don't want your religion being forced on me through my tax money.
[50:32.640 --> 50:42.640]  They do the opposite, though. In England and Germany and Sweden, they take the kids forcibly every year to mosque.
[50:42.640 --> 50:52.640]  They have them right about the Koran. They are telling them, don't do anything Christian, but be Muslim.
[50:52.640 --> 50:57.640]  And then you've got the official EU plan to make Europe Islamic.
[50:57.640 --> 51:02.640]  It turns out they have, from 100 years ago, that they developed a plan for.
[51:02.640 --> 51:07.640]  And we've talked about that plan here on air. I mean, there's even Wikipedia pages about it.
[51:07.640 --> 51:21.640]  It's just crazy that they do this and they say these holidays belong to gays, Muslims, Sikhs, Asians, gay couples that haven't adopted baby,
[51:21.640 --> 51:26.640]  which, you know, most of the time it's CPS taking heterosexual couples, baby. I mean, that's what's going on.
[51:26.640 --> 51:32.640]  We are harvested. We are persecuted.
[51:32.640 --> 51:38.640]  And we've got it on screen about, you know, the UK kids made to pray at the mosque, not just visit the mosque.
[51:38.640 --> 51:46.640]  So this is going on. And now Tesco, one of the biggest grocery store chains in Europe and the UK.
[51:46.640 --> 51:52.640]  I bought stuff in there repeatedly. You'll drive for like 100 miles in England and see no stores,
[51:52.640 --> 52:00.640]  but you see one of these big, big, big supermarkets. Tesco, a UK based supermarket chain, has launched their first Christmas commercial,
[52:00.640 --> 52:05.640]  the holiday season, featuring multicultural caste and multi-religion symbolism,
[52:05.640 --> 52:10.640]  but conspicuously omitted any overt references to Christianity in the end.
[52:10.640 --> 52:21.640]  You can have Islamic stuff, Islamic symbols, and see them mixing it in with the more politically correct tenon bomb and Norse and Germanic evergreens and things.
[52:21.640 --> 52:29.640]  So all that's okay, but don't you show anything Christian on Christmas, which means Christ.
[52:29.640 --> 52:36.640]  In fact, just call it holidays. And now it's women in burkas and hadjibs celebrating it.
[52:36.640 --> 52:41.640]  It's their holiday, not yours. See, that's even sweeter anti-Christian.
[52:41.640 --> 52:43.640]  We're going to take it over. We're going to commercialize it.
[52:43.640 --> 52:48.640]  We're not going to let you use it. We're going to tell you you're bad if it's religious or Christian.
[52:48.640 --> 52:57.640]  But then we're going to take it and we're going to make it a gay couple with a kid and we're going to make it Muslims and we're not going to include you.
[52:57.640 --> 53:02.640]  Just like they tell people at the colleges everywhere, whites can't come to school this weekend. You're bad.
[53:02.640 --> 53:13.640]  Or how dare you run for the Portland City Council. I saw that yesterday. You're a white man. You're not allowed to be in office.
[53:13.640 --> 53:20.640]  And then another city council is quote all queer now to use that term, their term they use.
[53:20.640 --> 53:28.640]  There it is, Portland candidate berated for being white male. How dare you run against three women of color? How dare you exist?
[53:28.640 --> 53:37.640]  This is literal Nazi ideology. And it's a rubbing it in, a force feeding, an agenda.
[53:37.640 --> 53:43.640]  To get us all destabilized, right as the AI and the robots replacing everybody come in.
[53:43.640 --> 53:50.640]  While we're busy fighting with each other, here come the robots. But we got to fight because the Muslims are programmed to take over.
[53:50.640 --> 54:01.640]  They admit that. So despite the fact they're human and I want them to be free, I still have to deal with that programmed onslaught.
[54:01.640 --> 54:10.640]  Through their mind control religion, their political Islam, and then I'm just here desperately trying to have a future folks and I'm telling you what's happening here.
[54:10.640 --> 54:21.640]  And the official establishment says we will be replaced. We are obsolete. You are obsolete. Now shovel yourself into your grave.
[54:21.640 --> 54:36.640]  The decisions been made. Why do you think they have House Intelligence Committee and Senate Defense Committee meetings and they go, Alex Jones must be stopped.
[54:36.640 --> 54:42.640]  It's because they know they signed on to this. They're scared. They want to place at the table.
[54:42.640 --> 54:48.640]  They know that there's only going to be maximum 10% of the people left when this is done and they all want to see it at the table.
[54:48.640 --> 54:52.640]  They're not going to give you seats at the table. You little, you're not even effeminate.
[54:52.640 --> 54:59.640]  The little weak men who all talk like robots and all say the same thing and all just just beta male around.
[54:59.640 --> 55:11.640]  You've been chosen because you're traitors to lower the drawbridge. The minute this is completed, you're all gone.
[55:11.640 --> 55:20.640]  Show that House hearing where they were going. Don't worry, sir. We banned him at lunch. We banned Paul Watson, Alex Jones, and the Congress was good.
[55:20.640 --> 55:37.640]  Now get on it better now. Yes, sir. He was number one, but we stopped it. But the problem is, as you know, sir, with the Panopticon tracking rate, it makes it harder for assassination.
[55:37.640 --> 55:42.640]  That's what's really going on behind the doors. Quickly. Why don't you just take care of him?
[55:42.640 --> 55:51.640]  The Panopticon ignition or the program means other people inside the agencies would stop us if they knew we did it. Once it's purely automated in AI, then we can have the purges, sir.
[55:51.640 --> 56:00.640]  But we're so close. We're so close, sir. Get it done. I mean, that's, you know, they don't like me because I see for miles and miles because I've studied them.
[56:00.640 --> 56:11.640]  Psychopaths, sociopaths, and followers are so programmable, they're not even really conscious. So they're robots. They only do a few things. I know what they do.
[56:11.640 --> 56:19.640]  Now, there's controllers up behind them that are conscious but are turned over to evil.
[56:19.640 --> 56:28.640]  But all of these men were chosen for their weakness and did not threaten the satanic alpha males at the top.
[56:28.640 --> 56:35.640]  And they're brood mothers, brood queens that lure the women in for the feast.
[56:35.640 --> 56:44.640]  Let's play the new TV ad here. Let's play Christmas for the Muslims and everybody else, but not for Christians. Here it is. Here's the conquering. Let's go to it.
[56:44.640 --> 56:50.640]  What's the dinner? I've a guess.
[56:50.640 --> 56:54.640]  He's a zombie. Everybody's a zombie.
[56:54.640 --> 56:56.640]  You did tip the jibbler soap.
[56:56.640 --> 56:59.640]  Jibbler soap.
[56:59.640 --> 57:06.640]  Okay guys, they get to have a family. You don't.
[57:06.640 --> 57:09.640]  They've got your smart phones.
[57:09.640 --> 57:15.640]  So they don't restrict you to watch by showing you a smart phone on screen. They know you're under screen sickness.
[57:15.640 --> 57:21.640]  So they show you a phone and get you to look at that because they know that the phone's mesmerizing you better.
[57:21.640 --> 57:29.640]  The Muslim women, other groups, Turkish, whatever.
[57:29.640 --> 57:33.640]  No Christians.
[57:33.640 --> 57:37.640]  Oh, it's so cute.
[57:37.640 --> 57:39.640]  It's a little bro.
[57:39.640 --> 57:41.640]  However you do Christmas, we've got a turkey.
[57:41.640 --> 57:43.640]  And everybody's just eased in.
[57:43.640 --> 57:47.640]  All being killed by the chemical weapons. It's just die. Everyone's dying again.
[57:47.640 --> 57:51.640]  Not a group. You developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[57:51.640 --> 57:57.640]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[57:57.640 --> 58:02.640]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[58:02.640 --> 58:10.640]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[58:10.640 --> 58:16.640]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[58:16.640 --> 58:18.640]  These are all parasites.
[58:18.640 --> 58:20.640]  Tell us about all the stuff we said. There's so many things that are in it.
[58:20.640 --> 58:25.640]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[58:25.640 --> 58:28.640]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[58:28.640 --> 58:31.640]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[58:31.640 --> 58:34.640]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.
[58:34.640 --> 58:37.640]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[58:37.640 --> 58:43.640]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[58:43.640 --> 58:46.640]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[58:48.640 --> 58:51.640]  America is an information-based civil war.
[58:51.640 --> 58:59.640]  That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[58:59.640 --> 59:05.640]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[59:05.640 --> 59:12.640]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[59:12.640 --> 59:21.640]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[59:21.640 --> 59:26.640]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[59:26.640 --> 59:33.640]  They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide.
[59:33.640 --> 59:38.640]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women,
[59:38.640 --> 59:42.640]  as well as more Patriot Feral at infowarstore.com.
[59:42.640 --> 59:47.640]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[59:50.640 --> 59:54.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:54.640 --> 59:57.640]  Here's an updated boil-down of the demonization.
[59:57.640 --> 59:59.640]  We confirm suspicions at Veritas.
[59:59.640 --> 1:00:05.640]  It's not a shock to you, but to get the employee at YouTube on tape admitting that they do it.
[1:00:05.640 --> 1:00:08.640]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:13.640]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[1:00:13.640 --> 1:00:17.640]  That was just a short time ago, and I'm talking about when this meeting started.
[1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:24.640]  On Twitter, if you clicked on the hashtag NYC Terrace Attack, which is, quote, trending,
[1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:36.640]  marked with a red button saying, quote, live, the top tweet links to an infowar story with the headline,
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:38.640]  he was too busy bashing Trump.
[1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:48.640]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:55.640]  This is a real-time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized.
[1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:58.640]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:01.640]  He actually went on Jones's show and said,
[1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:07.640]  Your reputation's amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:14.640]  He still calls Alex Jones and talks to him and, you know, the info wars.
[1:01:14.640 --> 1:01:16.640]  The war's conspiracy theories.
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:22.640]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:27.640]  so that the people who saw this know that it's fake news,
[1:01:27.640 --> 1:01:33.640]  and at least at some point in time it can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through the legitimate world.
[1:01:33.640 --> 1:01:37.640]  That's something we're thinking about all the time, because it's a bad user experience,
[1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:39.640]  and we don't want to be known as a platform for that.
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:51.640]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:55.640]  They did it through false news sites. They did it through these thousand agents.
[1:01:55.640 --> 1:02:00.640]  They did it through machine learning, which, you know, kept spewing out this stuff over and over again.
[1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:09.640]  And they began to have some of their allies within the internet world, like info wars,
[1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:16.640]  take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:23.640]  Google is being accused of hiding negative stories about Hillary and her campaign
[1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:27.640]  by teaching its algorithm to marry stories like the Clinton body count story.
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:29.640]  That's according to website info wars.
[1:02:29.640 --> 1:02:39.640]  You have RT, you have Sputnik, you have Rupley, and then I think you have them feeding other entities.
[1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:42.640]  Info wars comes to mind where those are echo chambers.
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:47.640]  It's been widely reported that that company's been backed by the Kremlin, and they gave you 75,000 shares
[1:02:47.640 --> 1:02:51.640]  that you had to disclose when you went into the Obama administration.
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:58.640]  Maybe you're looking at widely reported information from info wars, but it is not true.
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:06.640]  If a Google user types in Clinton body, they get car repair shop results,
[1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:10.640]  instead of a story that talks about a list of people tied to the Clintons
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:13.640]  who have died under mysterious circumstances over the last three decades.
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:19.640]  The latest story was the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was murdered last month in an apparent robbery.
[1:03:19.640 --> 1:03:23.640]  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has hinted that Rich was his source,
[1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:28.640]  but as made known from the comments about the case, that murder, we should say, remains unsolved.
[1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:34.640]  The Russians, in my opinion, and based on the intel and counterintel people I've talked to,
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:40.640]  could not have known how best to weaponize that information unless they had been guided.
[1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:48.640]  All that stuff exists. You don't see it, you don't feel it if you're largely living in reality and in a mainstream media world.
[1:03:48.640 --> 1:03:56.640]  But it's undermining our democracy and I think that the companies themselves, they've taken some steps,
[1:03:56.640 --> 1:04:08.640]  they have a lot of responsibility, companies like Facebook, Google, etc. to do what they can to essentially not enhance this.
[1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:14.640]  How quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight?
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:18.640]  The system self-corrected. That shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore.
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:21.640]  It should be a USA article the last time I checked.
[1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:22.640]  But you saw this.
[1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:27.640]  USA Today. At lunch I did. And I also saw the system correct it.
[1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:28.640]  That man's incorrect in this country.
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:32.640]  They didn't call out Fox News by name. They didn't call out anyone else by name.
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:39.640]  They said, when it comes to Alex Jones, we need people to scroll and manually find him and manually have to find that video.
[1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:45.640]  We're not going to allow that video if it gets 10 million views to be on the front of the so-called news carousel.
[1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:49.640]  We'll be back with a top-seating business.
[1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:50.640]  Former FBI whistleblower.
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:54.640]  You are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[1:04:57.640 --> 1:05:07.640]  America is an information-based civil war. That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:13.640]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:21.640]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:29.640]  The real punk rock is being a patriot, who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:35.640]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:37.640]  They are the anti-liberal.
[1:05:37.640 --> 1:05:42.640]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide.
[1:05:42.640 --> 1:05:51.640]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot Apparel at infowarstore.com.
[1:05:51.640 --> 1:06:06.640]  This is part of the Second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:25.640]  Here now into hour number two for the next 45 minutes or so, Sabelle Edmonds, an amazing patriot who served this country honorably, who's one of the highest-level whistleblowers ever to expose.
[1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:33.640]  The stand down of 9-11, our government working with radical jihad groups in Saudi Arabia, I mean, she's got amazing information.
[1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:42.640]  She's got courage, too. She's broken federal gag orders before during Bush and Obama and exposed serious crimes, and they had to back down.
[1:06:42.640 --> 1:06:45.640]  And she's a journalist as well, newsbud.com.
[1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:54.640]  We're going to be going to her in a moment that when she leaves us in the last segment of the show, I told you it was a hoax at the time, because 99% of the time it was.
[1:06:54.640 --> 1:07:03.640]  I saw how the Air Force responded in a huge PR campaign during the whole NFL anti-Trump race stuff, and so I could just see the packaging.
[1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:09.640]  I could see the instant PR, and you know when something's produced, kind of like Hillary did, fake town halls.
[1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:13.640]  And I said, that's shot 35 millimeter, super HD, it's actors.
[1:07:13.640 --> 1:07:15.640]  The media said, Jones claims he has actors.
[1:07:15.640 --> 1:07:17.640]  It's like, came out a month later, it was all fake.
[1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:24.640]  I mean, we all know, like when you're seeing a Hollywood movie, versus real. I mean, unless it's just the best.
[1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:33.640]  I got to tell you, watching the people versus O.J. Simpson, sometimes during that Netflix show, the actors were so good that it was like it was real.
[1:07:33.640 --> 1:07:37.640]  But that's, it was only part of the show, too. Other parts weren't as good.
[1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:41.640]  I mean, you know when something's fake, and it's the same deal.
[1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:48.640]  Air Force Academy discovers racial slurs or hoax, months after superintendent lauded for tough speech.
[1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:52.640]  And I think he or one of his adjuncts is behind it. I mean, I'll just tell you one point.
[1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:58.640]  That's my opinion, because I saw the whole PR rollout within hours, the way it was all done at the whole peak of the NFL deal.
[1:07:58.640 --> 1:08:03.640]  This was deep state PR, this general's anti-Trump, this was a stunt.
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:09.640]  We know it's fake now, we know somebody pulled it, and I'm saying, you're suspect number one, buddy.
[1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:15.640]  Continuing, Rand Paul's neighbors say it wasn't a dispute over the grass or the landscaping.
[1:08:15.640 --> 1:08:21.640]  The neighbor hated him. The neighbors called for violence against Trump, called for his testicles to be chopped off and all sorts of stuff.
[1:08:21.640 --> 1:08:24.640]  And he tackled over behind and broke six of his ribs.
[1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:28.640]  We now learn punctured his lung, and the left is just celebrating the hell out of that.
[1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:31.640]  But his neighbors are now exposing in our stories up on DrudgeReport.com.
[1:08:31.640 --> 1:08:36.640]  Rand Paul revealed six broken ribs, lung condition after attack from socialist neighbor.
[1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:39.640]  That was part of their November 4th rampage.
[1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:43.640]  Congress hears ideas of altering clouds, offset climate change.
[1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:47.640]  Oh, McClatchy, I thought I heard of that on M4's a long time ago.
[1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:48.640]  So that's all coming up.
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:51.640]  Putin says U.S. wants to disrupt upcoming Russian election.
[1:08:51.640 --> 1:08:52.640]  We're going to get to that.
[1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:59.640]  We're going to get to this next of them cult where the women get branded and have to bring another sex slaves.
[1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:03.640]  They thought it was a feminist group, but it was run by a man.
[1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:08.640]  I was talking about this group a month ago, but in New York and in Hollywood and other places.
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:10.640]  This is how these work.
[1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:16.640]  They'll say it's a women empowerment group, and then it's be run by some beautiful women that they lure them in.
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:19.640]  And then they put them on hallucinogens, you name it.
[1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:22.640]  And I'm not saying this guy did it, but they're the police are going in.
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:25.640]  I'm just saying I knew about these type of deals, not this one.
[1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:29.640]  And of course, Huffington Post attacked me and said it was horrible.
[1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:32.640]  I told women, if you go to a women empowerment group, they go, oh, by the way,
[1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:36.640]  just to prove you're into women being in charge, these women are going to put you in handcuffs.
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:38.640]  You like girls, don't you?
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:42.640]  And then next you're being tortured or next you're dead.
[1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:46.640]  And they attacked me for that when I broke it down.
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:47.640]  But now that was for all this broke.
[1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:48.640]  Let's see. I'm right again.
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:52.640]  So there you go.
[1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:56.640]  Just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[1:09:56.640 --> 1:09:58.640]  Oh, you're a young, beautiful woman.
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:02.640]  You can trust other women, my dear, come to our castle.
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:03.640]  Oh, there's no men here.
[1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:07.640]  Oh, no, we don't have men here until you're chained down until you're begging for your law.
[1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:08.640]  Excuse me.
[1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:10.640]  You'll find out later when we brand you.
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:11.640]  We're liberal though.
[1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:16.640]  You know, Apple, we run companies with suicide nets and forced abortions,
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:19.640]  but it's okay because Apple's liberal.
[1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:25.640]  See, as long as it's liberal, as long as they're pulling your teeth out with pliers and saying it's liberal.
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:29.640]  I mean, as long as you're shooting up a church and it's liberal, it's all right.
[1:10:29.640 --> 1:10:32.640]  And again, there's a whole dark side on the right wing as well.
[1:10:32.640 --> 1:10:33.640]  It's all a system of control.
[1:10:33.640 --> 1:10:37.640]  Now, let me just stop there and get into the main subject.
[1:10:37.640 --> 1:10:42.640]  Shabelle Edmonds is one of the bravest people out there that I've seen in the last 15 years,
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:44.640]  since 16 years, since 9-11.
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:46.640]  And I want her in the few minutes we have before we go to break,
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:49.640]  just to tell people about herself, even though she doesn't like to talk about herself.
[1:10:49.640 --> 1:10:51.640]  She's an author, journalist, researcher.
[1:10:51.640 --> 1:10:56.640]  She was a high-level translator in Arabic and Farsi for the FBI with NSA intercepts,
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:11:02.640]  CIA intercepts, watching all the different agencies and confirming what Colonel Shaffer and others talked about,
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:05.640]  going on pre-9-11 and on 9-11.
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:08.640]  And she exposed the sex trafficking, the weapon trafficking.
[1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:09.640]  It ties into Benghazi later.
[1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:10.640]  It ties into the Arab Spring.
[1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:14.640]  It ties into now, her big story we'll get to by the bottom of the hour,
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:17.640]  but I wanted to give folks some background from newsbud.com.
[1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:21.640]  I'm going to tweak this out at Real Alex Jones during the break and he's going to go mega viral.
[1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:26.640]  Targeting Michael Flynn and shielding the radical cleric Gulan,
[1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:29.640]  Special Counsel Robert Mueller must step down.
[1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:34.640]  This is the network that gets tens of billions of dollars a year of taxpayer money to run Muslim schools here in the U.S.
[1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:35.640]  Yes.
[1:11:35.640 --> 1:11:41.640]  And it's an inner fight between Ergun and Gulan, who is a man, not just the group, and all this.
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:47.640]  And she is a leading expert, and I guess a Turkish derivation,
[1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:51.640]  so he can particularly give you the inside baseball on this.
[1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:54.640]  Newsbud.com, get this story.
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:59.640]  This is bombshell and could bring down Mueller, who deserves to be brought down.
[1:11:59.640 --> 1:12:02.640]  So you got more courage than anybody I know out there.
[1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:04.640]  You just keep asking for it in their face.
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:07.640]  Sebel Edmonds, thank you for joining us.
[1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:08.640]  Hello, Alex.
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:15.640]  Many thanks for the invite and for this opportunity because of all the angles,
[1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:20.640]  all the ongoing cases right now under these farce,
[1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:22.640]  Russiagate investigations.
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:28.640]  General Flynn's case is the case that stands out the most,
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:32.640]  and it is blackout the most by the media.
[1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:37.640]  You either see false information, completely false information,
[1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:40.640]  unanimously put out by the media,
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:45.640]  and you also see all these blacked out information.
[1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:48.640]  So I'm really grateful for this opportunity.
[1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:55.640]  We at Newsbud have been covering nonstop General Flynn's case since last August.
[1:12:55.640 --> 1:13:02.640]  And I just want to start by saying and explaining why General Flynn's case
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:08.640]  and why Newsbud has been nonstop covering this case of all the different angles
[1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:13.640]  and developments that we have been seeing, the farce developments.
[1:13:13.640 --> 1:13:18.640]  I mean, isn't it the window into understanding the different factions and everything?
[1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:19.640]  Well, yes.
[1:13:19.640 --> 1:13:22.640]  Well, as you know, I have been nonpartisan.
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:24.640]  I have been around for 16 years.
[1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:27.640]  You just mentioned, I guess we are both getting really old, Alex.
[1:13:27.640 --> 1:13:29.640]  I can't believe we've been around this long.
[1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:33.640]  You look great. I don't know about me.
[1:13:33.640 --> 1:13:34.640]  No, you do.
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:36.640]  And you still have the energy.
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:41.640]  And again, this is, I don't know, the seventh or eighth time you have given us the platform
[1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:46.640]  to put out blacked out stories and the documented stories,
[1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:49.640]  not allegations, not sensationalism.
[1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:57.640]  But here's why General Flynn's case grabbed my attention starting last August.
[1:13:57.640 --> 1:14:00.640]  As you know, I was a whistleblower with the FBI.
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:06.640]  I became the most gagged whistleblower with all the state secrets, privilege invocations
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:08.640]  and the gag orders.
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:13.640]  This came during the Bush administration and it continued into Obama administration.
[1:14:13.640 --> 1:14:17.640]  As you know, the Supreme Court was prevented from hearing my case.
[1:14:17.640 --> 1:14:23.640]  Well, when I started looking at all the facts on General Flynn's case,
[1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:28.640]  the first thing I realized immediately, because I also have an organization.
[1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:34.640]  I have 150 national security whistleblowers from the CIA, from the Pentagon.
[1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:38.640]  We established this organization in 2003, 2004.
[1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:41.640]  And that's why I'm saying you have so much courage is you have been a leading person
[1:14:41.640 --> 1:14:45.640]  when they were jailing everybody who stood up to them and organized folks.
[1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:50.640]  And so much of what we now know about 9-11 and all these other events that helped General Flynn
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:53.640]  finally break a lot of this up was due to your work.
[1:14:53.640 --> 1:14:58.640]  And I'm only explaining that to listeners so they understand how incredibly important this is.
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:03.640]  Extremely important because as you can see, unanimously the media,
[1:15:03.640 --> 1:15:07.640]  they don't present the real case when it comes to General Flynn's case.
[1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:15.640]  General Flynn was selected by the Obama administration to lead Defense Intelligence Agency.
[1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:20.640]  They looked at this general impeccable, impeccable record, right?
[1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:26.640]  And I have to also emphasize he has been, he and his family, they have been Democrats.
[1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:31.640]  So they expected also to have a yes man in the White House.
[1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:35.640]  Instead they got a hero who helped the whole engineer, the whole architecture
[1:15:35.640 --> 1:15:39.640]  to stop the Islamic jihad operations.
[1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:43.640]  Stay right there. Let's get into why the globalists hate General Flynn so much.
[1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:46.640]  It's a window in everything. It's a bell admins.

[1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:46.640]  It is an act of war.
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:50.640]  It is an act of standing up when you spread the links, the articles, and buy products from us.
[1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:54.640]  And then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[1:20:21.640 --> 1:20:25.640]  Broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:25.640 --> 1:20:30.640]  By the way, this particular article ties into what Stabell's about to break down exclusively here.
[1:20:30.640 --> 1:20:35.640]  This came out six months ago in the Vault 7 CIA leak that they admitted was real info.
[1:20:35.640 --> 1:20:41.640]  How they were impersonating Russians with these CIA programs in live time
[1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:46.640]  to make it look like it came from Russia and to put it in the Russian alphabet
[1:20:46.640 --> 1:20:50.640]  to then frame Russia for messing with the election.
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:51.640]  So there it is.
[1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:57.640]  CIA wrote code to impersonate Russia, lab, antivirus company, just so much more.
[1:20:57.640 --> 1:20:59.640]  Putin says, Deep State may interfere in Russian election.
[1:20:59.640 --> 1:21:05.640]  Well, they've been dealing it with the whole Ford Foundation and the CIA and George Soros.
[1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:06.640]  It's just crazy.
[1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:12.640]  But going back to Stabell Edmonds, one of the biggest whistleblowers, if not the most prolific ever,
[1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:16.640]  organizing other whistleblowers now with newsbud.com.
[1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:17.640]  Okay, you've got the floor.
[1:21:17.640 --> 1:21:23.640]  Let's get into General Flynn and why he's the key to understanding the shadow government wars that are going on.
[1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:25.640]  Absolutely.
[1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:31.640]  At Newsbud, we broke in 2011 before ISIS brand was created, Alex.
[1:21:31.640 --> 1:21:36.640]  The fact that Obama administration, the CIA, together with NATO,
[1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:43.640]  they were creating these jihadi groups using Turkey, using Jordan,
[1:21:43.640 --> 1:21:49.640]  in order to topple Bashar Assad's government in Syria.
[1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:50.640]  Okay?
[1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:53.640]  And this was before they coined the term ISIS.
[1:21:53.640 --> 1:21:54.640]  And we have it there on our side.
[1:21:54.640 --> 1:21:56.640]  People can see it.
[1:21:56.640 --> 1:21:58.640]  Well, back to General Flynn.
[1:21:58.640 --> 1:22:04.640]  General Flynn, as an insider, becomes aware.
[1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:10.640]  This is during the Obama administration that this is what Obama administration was doing.
[1:22:10.640 --> 1:22:19.640]  The U.S. government was creating these jihadi groups, which later was termed ISIS.
[1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:23.640]  And he blew the whistle internally.
[1:22:23.640 --> 1:22:29.640]  He went and he's, think about it, he's a director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[1:22:29.640 --> 1:22:32.640]  He says, what the heck is this?
[1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:39.640]  And he stands out and he stands up against what the Obama administration was doing,
[1:22:39.640 --> 1:22:43.640]  opposes all these operations in creating ISIS.
[1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:47.640]  And here we are, U.S. government, Obama administration creating,
[1:22:47.640 --> 1:22:51.640]  arming, training ISIS in Turkey, in Jordan.
[1:22:51.640 --> 1:22:57.640]  And of course, by blowing the whistle, what is the first thing that's going to happen to you?
[1:22:57.640 --> 1:23:02.640]  I know it and I know it based on hundreds of whistleblower cases I have represented.
[1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:03.640]  I have studied.
[1:23:03.640 --> 1:23:04.640]  I have analyzed.
[1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:11.640]  They pushed him out of the administration because he was not being a yes man.
[1:23:11.640 --> 1:23:12.640]  Okay?
[1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:18.640]  After leaving his position, General Flynn went and he said, you know,
[1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:22.640]  disgusted with the entire operations Obama administration.
[1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:29.640]  And he set up his own private firm with some clients, some of them international.
[1:23:29.640 --> 1:23:36.640]  And fast forward another year or so, he blew the whistle again.
[1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:38.640]  And this is for the American public.
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:49.640]  He is the first U.S. official to go on record unabashedly exposing the world's biggest,
[1:23:49.640 --> 1:23:56.640]  biggest sleeper terror cell that is headquartered here in the United States.
[1:23:56.640 --> 1:23:58.640]  This is Fed to Love Ulan.
[1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:07.640]  This is this Islamist radical Fed to Love Ulan's network, which network is over $25 billion.
[1:24:07.640 --> 1:24:12.640]  Guess who brought Fed to Love Ulan and his network into the United States?
[1:24:12.640 --> 1:24:19.640]  In 1998, it was Bill Clinton who brought Fed to Love Ulan in a private, you know,
[1:24:19.640 --> 1:24:25.640]  a golf stream plane, CIA plane into the United States while this man was wanted in Turkey
[1:24:25.640 --> 1:24:31.640]  and even some other nations for his terror radical Islamic activities.
[1:24:31.640 --> 1:24:38.640]  And Bill Clinton administration gave the rise to this network in the United States.
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:42.640]  And by the way, tell folks how much taxpayer money he gets a year.
[1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:46.640]  I mean, they say he's worth as much as $200 billion.
[1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:50.640]  That's the minimum. That's the minimum, Alex. That's the known figures.
[1:24:50.640 --> 1:25:00.640]  Because can you believe this Islamic terror network owns and operates the largest charter school chains in the United States?
[1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:02.640]  And they get taxpayer money. Hundreds of billions.
[1:25:02.640 --> 1:25:03.640]  Absolutely.
[1:25:03.640 --> 1:25:06.640]  So here we are. Here we are. This has all come out now.
[1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:08.640]  You're from Turkey's extraction. You're an expert on this.
[1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:12.640]  Flynn blows the whistle. The military says we're not going to be al-Qaeda's air force.
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:14.640]  Rand Paul goes public. Senator Cruz goes public.
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:17.640]  So they changed the name to ISIS to confuse people.
[1:25:17.640 --> 1:25:20.640]  And then now it's ongoing. Now we have the Arab Spring.
[1:25:20.640 --> 1:25:22.640]  We have Europe. We have the migrant crisis.
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:25.640]  Soros is running it. There's a globalist double cross.
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:29.640]  Trump, from my research, is trying to continue Flynn's operation to kill this.
[1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:33.640]  Is that accurate? And where are we going? And tell us about Mueller.
[1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:43.640]  Yes, because he actually, and this is General Flynn, he wrote an article editorial and had it published at the Hill publication,
[1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:51.640]  basically calling what it is, warning the American public and saying this terror network needs to be stopped.
[1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:54.640]  And that basically was the last straw.
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:26:05.640]  He had already become a target, a major target, a major hit with the CIA, with the Obama administration by blowing the whistle on ISIS.
[1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:14.640]  This was the last straw by going public as this high level general with impeccable record saying this is a terror network.
[1:26:14.640 --> 1:26:20.640]  And that was when the real retaliation began to take place.
[1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:25.640]  I was about to say, you know who's in power because you can't criticize them.
[1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:30.640]  We've just barely covered Gulan and the hack attacks, all hell breaks loose.
[1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:32.640]  The mainstream media comes after us on other issues.
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:35.640]  And I've been contacted by high level people. It was off record.
[1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:39.640]  So I can't say who they said, listen, just drop the Gulan stuff.
[1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:43.640]  You can do whatever you want. Stop it. I've been actually threatened.
[1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:48.640]  You know, that's why I know how much courage you've got is, I mean, these people mean business.
[1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:55.640]  I have been receiving threats for over a decade because I was the first person in the U.S. to expose Gulan network, Gulan's name.
[1:26:55.640 --> 1:27:01.640]  When I came out in 2006, 2007 on Gulan, nobody had heard of this man's name.
[1:27:01.640 --> 1:27:10.640]  They were like, who? She's talking about some kind of a Turkish Imam who was in Pennsylvania and nobody wanted to take it seriously.
[1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:16.640]  But when you have this general with this impeccable record going on record and public...
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:21.640]  Who was the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, so he had the bird's eye view of everything. He could see it.
[1:27:21.640 --> 1:27:25.640]  Right. And this is before Obama left the White House.
[1:27:25.640 --> 1:27:34.640]  This is November 2016. Three, four days after this article was published, penned by General Flynn,
[1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:41.640]  Obama White House started leaking falsified information, misleading, incomplete information,
[1:27:41.640 --> 1:27:51.640]  falsified to their, to their mouthpiece media networks on General Flynn, accusing him of being pocketed by the Turkish government.
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:57.640]  And none of those, basically most of those allegations have already been...
[1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:04.640]  Sure. Flynn 100% with his consulting company carried out U.S. interest 100% like he's always done and done a great job.
[1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:09.640]  The whole architecture of bringing down ISIS, making Saudi Arabia stop doing what they're doing.
[1:28:09.640 --> 1:28:11.640]  I mean, that's Flynn, isn't it?
[1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:13.640]  Absolutely. And guess what?
[1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:20.640]  When I was in the FBI, there were several investigations on new land taken out by the FBI.
[1:28:20.640 --> 1:28:25.640]  Okay. And several field offices, including those in New Jersey, those in Illinois,
[1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:29.640]  and of course the main office being the Washington field office.
[1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:32.640]  And this is under Director Mueller, right?
[1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:35.640]  And when we come back, we're going to hold you at the end of the hour because this is so important.
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:41.640]  We're going to get into Mueller now who's just got his hands in uranium one, the Russia deals, working with Gulan.
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:44.640]  And it's all on record just what a monster this guy is.
[1:28:44.640 --> 1:28:50.640]  And if this gets out, it could stop Mueller trying to destroy our chance of saving this country.
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:29:16.640]  So we've got to stop Mueller. Stay with us.
[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:25.640]  Go to libertyoncall.org. That's libertyoncall.org.

[3:33:05.640 --> 3:33:10.640]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[3:33:10.640 --> 3:33:15.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:33:15.640 --> 3:33:30.640]  We're living on the hatch.
[3:33:30.640 --> 3:33:34.640]  Well we've heard of invasion of the body snatchers.
[3:33:34.640 --> 3:33:38.640]  But what about invasion of the creeperzoids?
[3:33:38.640 --> 3:33:41.640]  Here's a clip of Kevin Spacey recently saying,
[3:33:41.640 --> 3:33:45.640]  I'm one of the good guys. What a creepy jerk.
[3:33:45.640 --> 3:33:47.640]  Is that one of your philosophies in life?
[3:33:47.640 --> 3:33:48.640]  Yeah.
[3:33:48.640 --> 3:33:49.640]  To be one of the good guys?
[3:33:49.640 --> 3:33:50.640]  Yeah.
[3:33:50.640 --> 3:33:52.640]  To be one of the good guys?
[3:33:52.640 --> 3:33:59.640]  Yeah.
[3:33:59.640 --> 3:34:04.640]  Man, he is a genuine psychopath like his dad.
[3:34:04.640 --> 3:34:07.640]  That is just the craziest thing ever.
[3:34:07.640 --> 3:34:08.640]  Can we play that?
[3:34:08.640 --> 3:34:09.640]  Radio listeners can just hear it.
[3:34:09.640 --> 3:34:13.640]  But for TV viewers, it's like he's not even a real person.
[3:34:13.640 --> 3:34:14.640]  Here it is.
[3:34:14.640 --> 3:34:16.640]  Going to go home.
[3:34:16.640 --> 3:34:18.640]  Is that one of your philosophies in life?
[3:34:18.640 --> 3:34:19.640]  Yeah.
[3:34:19.640 --> 3:34:20.640]  To be one of the good guys?
[3:34:20.640 --> 3:34:21.640]  Yeah.
[3:34:21.640 --> 3:34:23.640]  To be one of the good guys?
[3:34:23.640 --> 3:34:28.640]  Yeah.
[3:34:28.640 --> 3:34:33.640]  Man, he is crazy.
[3:34:33.640 --> 3:34:37.640]  And then you look at photos of his dad who thought he was Hitler with a Hitler mustache.
[3:34:37.640 --> 3:34:41.640]  And I mean, what the hell is going on with these people, man?
[3:34:41.640 --> 3:34:44.640]  And it's like Hollywood goes, oh good, you're evil and you're crazy.
[3:34:44.640 --> 3:34:48.640]  Let us recruit you in.
[3:34:48.640 --> 3:34:50.640]  You know, expanding on all of this.
[3:34:50.640 --> 3:34:54.640]  They're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off right now about Roy Moran.
[3:34:54.640 --> 3:34:58.640]  A couple of women say 35 years ago now.
[3:34:58.640 --> 3:35:02.640]  He said they were purdy when they were 14, 15, 16 years old.
[3:35:02.640 --> 3:35:04.640]  He didn't say anything sexual.
[3:35:04.640 --> 3:35:08.640]  Just you share our purdy.
[3:35:08.640 --> 3:35:15.640]  And McConnell and the Republicans are just stamp eating to freak out.
[3:35:15.640 --> 3:35:17.640]  And to say, oh my God, get rid of him.
[3:35:17.640 --> 3:35:18.640]  Step down.
[3:35:18.640 --> 3:35:22.640]  I wish you'd say that about the Clintons or the Obamas or the globalist or John McCain
[3:35:22.640 --> 3:35:26.640]  with all their corruption and all their sex stuff and airplanes and underage kids and everything.
[3:35:26.640 --> 3:35:30.640]  But you won't do that, William McConnell.
[3:35:30.640 --> 3:35:32.640]  Because they're all a bunch of globalist crooks.
[3:35:32.640 --> 3:35:36.640]  Jeff and Vancouver, go ahead and finish your point and then ask me anything.
[3:35:36.640 --> 3:35:38.640]  Go ahead.
[3:35:38.640 --> 3:35:44.640]  Okay, Alex, the point I wanted to make was, you know, that we have a champion.
[3:35:44.640 --> 3:35:47.640]  We have won the war and now we just have to walk it out.
[3:35:47.640 --> 3:35:49.640]  My question is this.
[3:35:49.640 --> 3:35:57.640]  You know, the quote elites carry the narrative and they actually carry the narrative by calling themselves elites.
[3:35:57.640 --> 3:35:59.640]  And then we call them elites as well.
[3:35:59.640 --> 3:36:00.640]  No, I agree.
[3:36:00.640 --> 3:36:01.640]  We should stop calling them elites.
[3:36:01.640 --> 3:36:03.640]  We should call them elite.
[3:36:03.640 --> 3:36:06.640]  Call them deletes because that's where they're going to go in the end.
[3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:07.640]  They're going to be deleted.
[3:36:07.640 --> 3:36:15.640]  I think we need to refer to them as that and trump the narrative and gain it over them that we win in the end.
[3:36:15.640 --> 3:36:19.640]  So what do you call them, the hijackers of civilization, the criminals?
[3:36:19.640 --> 3:36:24.640]  Well, I say they call themselves the elite and they want us to call them the elites.
[3:36:24.640 --> 3:36:31.640]  I call them the deletes and I've been calling them that for a while because these people in the end are not going to be around.
[3:36:31.640 --> 3:36:36.640]  They're going to be taken out and we're not going to be spending eternity with these people.
[3:36:36.640 --> 3:36:38.640]  They will be deleted.
[3:36:38.640 --> 3:36:39.640]  All right.
[3:36:39.640 --> 3:36:40.640]  Thank you so much for the call.
[3:36:40.640 --> 3:36:41.640]  Interesting points.
[3:36:41.640 --> 3:36:46.640]  We got Lee, Mark, Terry, Mark, Rose, Nelson, Chris.
[3:36:46.640 --> 3:36:49.640]  Does anyone have questions?
[3:36:49.640 --> 3:36:54.640]  How do I get help for indoor farms promoted?
[3:36:54.640 --> 3:36:55.640]  Hmm.
[3:36:55.640 --> 3:36:57.640]  Interesting question.
[3:36:57.640 --> 3:36:59.640]  State of Minnesota.
[3:36:59.640 --> 3:37:02.640]  Gaslight social politics.
[3:37:02.640 --> 3:37:07.640]  80 plus sealed indictments on Mueller.
[3:37:07.640 --> 3:37:16.640]  Does he know really who the left is Soviet Union one or lost the Cold War?
[3:37:16.640 --> 3:37:20.640]  Hugh Clarence, Patriot.
[3:37:20.640 --> 3:37:22.640]  What's Hugh Clarence?
[3:37:22.640 --> 3:37:28.640]  That's an old psychological or government designation for certain type of clearances.
[3:37:28.640 --> 3:37:30.640]  Let's go to Lee in Tennessee.
[3:37:30.640 --> 3:37:31.640]  You're on the air.
[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:32.640]  Go ahead.
[3:37:32.640 --> 3:37:33.640]  How you doing, Alex?
[3:37:33.640 --> 3:37:36.640]  Well, good afternoon from FEMA region four.
[3:37:36.640 --> 3:37:41.640]  Yeah, the Hugh Clarence, Patriot posts have been going up on 4chan.
[3:37:41.640 --> 3:37:44.640]  And whoever's doing it, it's all anonymous there.
[3:37:44.640 --> 3:37:45.640]  So they're laid out pretty well.
[3:37:45.640 --> 3:37:51.640]  And it's this long series of questions with some statements in between about a current plan going on right now.
[3:37:51.640 --> 3:37:54.640]  And you just brought up the indictments.
[3:37:54.640 --> 3:37:56.640]  They're also tracking the number of indictments.
[3:37:56.640 --> 3:37:59.640]  So it looks like there's some kind of plan in play.
[3:37:59.640 --> 3:38:02.640]  I wonder if you knew anything about it debunked or what?
[3:38:02.640 --> 3:38:04.640]  There's a lot of good information on 4chan.
[3:38:04.640 --> 3:38:07.640]  There's also a lot of bad guys on there because it's all anonymous.
[3:38:07.640 --> 3:38:12.640]  I'm not familiar with what you're, I mean, I know there's supposedly four other sealed indictments.
[3:38:12.640 --> 3:38:16.640]  One of them, General Flynn, they're now harassing the rest of his family.
[3:38:16.640 --> 3:38:18.640]  What do you think?
[3:38:18.640 --> 3:38:20.640]  I've been watching it and reading it.
[3:38:20.640 --> 3:38:22.640]  And some of it has kind of been prophetic.
[3:38:22.640 --> 3:38:25.640]  They've been going out since about the late end of October.
[3:38:25.640 --> 3:38:30.640]  And it spoke of Saudi Arabia prior to what went down there.
[3:38:30.640 --> 3:38:36.640]  And what we're seeing with these large amounts of senators and congressmen who aren't running for reelection,
[3:38:36.640 --> 3:38:41.640]  they are thinking that these people have been approached and basically they're low, low hanging fruit.
[3:38:41.640 --> 3:38:45.640]  They're about the big shiny guys like McCain or something like that.
[3:38:45.640 --> 3:38:51.640]  So they're voting the wrong way and voting for things that we definitely don't want any part of.
[3:38:51.640 --> 3:38:55.640]  But they've been approached and told basically, you know, either you go away quietly.
[3:38:55.640 --> 3:39:00.640]  Well, clearly that was going on and clearly they're, they're having to step down because they had bad approval ratings
[3:39:00.640 --> 3:39:01.640]  and they weren't going to be reelected.
[3:39:01.640 --> 3:39:07.640]  Now they've looked to make lemonade out of lemons and are now saying, wait, if they get rid of all of us,
[3:39:07.640 --> 3:39:10.640]  we'll just, Trump won't have a majority anymore in the house.
[3:39:10.640 --> 3:39:12.640]  What do you think of that?
[3:39:12.640 --> 3:39:14.640]  Well, I think that's part of some of these indictments we're seeing.
[3:39:14.640 --> 3:39:19.640]  I think hopefully some of these guys are going to get hemmed up for the stuff that's been going on.
[3:39:19.640 --> 3:39:21.640]  There's another guy, Trevor Loudon. Have you ever heard of him?
[3:39:21.640 --> 3:39:22.640]  Yes.
[3:39:22.640 --> 3:39:26.640]  Hey, he'd be a good guest. Come on. He's exposing the Senate and Congress.
[3:39:26.640 --> 3:39:30.640]  The members here have communists or ties to care in Islam.
[3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:35.640]  Well, I mean, listen, I mean, think Saudi Arabia is one of the richest countries in the world and they have been buying our politicians
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:39.640]  and Trump is putting an end to that to a great extent.
[3:39:39.640 --> 3:39:40.640]  That's correct.
[3:39:40.640 --> 3:39:44.640]  Especially with what's going on there now, they've hemmed up a lot of the money.
[3:39:44.640 --> 3:39:49.640]  And that's why they're panicking so hard right now.
[3:39:49.640 --> 3:39:56.640]  I think that the funding's cut off and that ties right back into what Zach was saying about these terrorist attacks.
[3:39:56.640 --> 3:39:59.640]  They're running around with their head cut off because the funding's cut off now.
[3:39:59.640 --> 3:40:02.640]  So they're basically going rogue. What do they do?
[3:40:02.640 --> 3:40:08.640]  And that's why, oh, by the way, I just got word during the break, he'd called Niko last night.
[3:40:08.640 --> 3:40:12.640]  I'd been busy. Niko tried to put it in my box. I didn't read it.
[3:40:12.640 --> 3:40:15.640]  They did let Zach out yesterday.
[3:40:15.640 --> 3:40:21.640]  He's getting a lawyer and stuff. And he says once he's authorized by the lawyer, he's going to come on officially and reveal his identity maybe next week.
[3:40:21.640 --> 3:40:24.640]  He's going to do it with the lawyer. So Zach is fine.
[3:40:24.640 --> 3:40:27.640]  I just get busy and didn't get, I got the note. I didn't read it.
[3:40:27.640 --> 3:40:32.640]  It was that Zach has been released by the by the army and the FBI.
[3:40:32.640 --> 3:40:34.640]  Thank you, Lee.
[3:40:34.640 --> 3:40:36.640]  Great points. Really great callers.
[3:40:36.640 --> 3:40:40.640]  Who's up next here? Soviet war, one or lost?
[3:40:40.640 --> 3:40:43.640]  That sounds interesting, but let's go to Terry in Minnesota first.
[3:40:43.640 --> 3:40:45.640]  Terry, you got a question. Go ahead.
[3:40:45.640 --> 3:40:51.640]  Hey, Alex, I want to cut right to the chase. I've talked to you several times before in the past and a lot of the crew, I buy a lot of the products. They are awesome.
[3:40:51.640 --> 3:40:53.640]  Thank you.
[3:40:53.640 --> 3:40:56.640]  Okay, the left.
[3:40:56.640 --> 3:41:06.640]  When you understand scripture, if you don't understand the first earth age, you're not going to understand scripture.
[3:41:06.640 --> 3:41:14.640]  In other words, when you're told something like you're one third of the stars that haven't followed the tail of the serpent, what are we talking about?
[3:41:14.640 --> 3:41:16.640]  Well, what does Christ say we're talking about?
[3:41:16.640 --> 3:41:22.640]  We're talking about 4 billion souls because the true scholars know that God created about 12 billion, so it's one third.
[3:41:22.640 --> 3:41:27.640]  And He reserved these people to be born into this last generation.
[3:41:27.640 --> 3:41:32.640]  Why? Because God wants to see these folks are going to go for them again and a lot of them are.
[3:41:32.640 --> 3:41:37.640]  And that's why it's hard to explain who these people are if you don't understand the first earth age.
[3:41:37.640 --> 3:41:46.640]  Well, I'll tell you, these evil people, like they have a score to settle, and they're in a military, and they've got an operation, and they're committed to evil.
[3:41:46.640 --> 3:41:53.640]  And you see it, it's like, this isn't culture. This is spiritual. They are really programmed. I mean, it's real.
[3:41:53.640 --> 3:42:01.640]  This is who these people are from the first earth age. That's why God said, I named you a prophet, Jeremiah, while you were still in your mother's womb.
[3:42:01.640 --> 3:42:06.640]  Well, what do you mean by that, you know? Okay, how about Jacob, I loved Esau, I hated.
[3:42:06.640 --> 3:42:11.640]  How could God hate Esau when he was still an embryo in the womb, right?
[3:42:11.640 --> 3:42:15.640]  Well, he knew him from the first earth age because Esau wanted nothing to do with God.
[3:42:15.640 --> 3:42:18.640]  Free will, just like Satan. Free will, that prick.
[3:42:18.640 --> 3:42:24.640]  I mean, he sucked, just like you got Obama. I mean, Hillary and Trump.
[3:42:24.640 --> 3:42:27.640]  Satan sucked one third of God's children towards Satan.
[3:42:27.640 --> 3:42:32.640]  In other words, they liked his politics, they liked his system, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3:42:32.640 --> 3:42:39.640]  And when Jesus Christ was weakened after the 40 days, and Satan comes to that guy, and he offered him,
[3:42:39.640 --> 3:42:44.640]  what did Satan offer Christ in lieu of his worship towards Satan?
[3:42:44.640 --> 3:42:49.640]  He offered him the Lamborghini's and the iPads, and Christ turned about them.
[3:42:49.640 --> 3:42:59.640]  Control over this dimension.

[3:47:12.640 --> 3:47:18.640]  I think he has a soul. There's an article by Don Salazar up on infowars.com.
[3:47:18.640 --> 3:47:29.640]  X Facebook president warns app exploits psychological vulnerability, suggests social media platform rewiring minds putting children's brains at risk.
[3:47:29.640 --> 3:47:38.640]  Well, that's because earlier this year, he's kind of doing a Don at Brazil there. Documents got hacked by British intelligence, I can let you know.
[3:47:38.640 --> 3:47:44.640]  But it ended up in the news that they target people and want to make them depressed and controllable and make them leftist.
[3:47:44.640 --> 3:47:47.640]  And that most of their friends are fake bots.
[3:47:47.640 --> 3:47:53.640]  One time I walked into a party in Austin and Sean Parker was there. I'm not supposed to tell the story.
[3:47:53.640 --> 3:47:56.640]  Okay, I'm not telling the story.
[3:47:56.640 --> 3:48:03.640]  Because the person that sent me to it said, you cannot tell that story promise. This was like five years ago.
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:11.640]  So it wasn't anything bad. It's just ridiculous. You'd think Sean Parker had seen a ghost when I walked in.
[3:48:11.640 --> 3:48:13.640]  Let's just leave it at that.
[3:48:13.640 --> 3:48:20.640]  But when you see the ghost in the old cartoons, they run through the wall. There's like a cut out of the person on the wall.
[3:48:20.640 --> 3:48:26.640]  But Sean Parker is there talking about that now. Boom, infowars.com. So important.
[3:48:26.640 --> 3:48:29.640]  Oh, everybody lets their kids on it. Everybody lets them.
[3:48:29.640 --> 3:48:37.640]  Yeah, and then that's how they interface their friends. So the computer becomes their friend, then rewires their brain.
[3:48:37.640 --> 3:48:43.640]  And look, I'm the worst about my daughter. Like, please let me get on social network for just one hour to play in parties with my friends.
[3:48:43.640 --> 3:48:46.640]  And then Zuckerberg looks like he's under MK ultra mind control.
[3:48:46.640 --> 3:48:49.640]  The real photos right here at the bottom of the article.
[3:48:49.640 --> 3:48:53.640]  Look at Zuckerberg's eyes, man. Let me tell you something.
[3:48:53.640 --> 3:48:58.640]  I wouldn't trust that guy.
[3:48:58.640 --> 3:49:04.640]  Look at the pupils even have like jagged edges around them.
[3:49:04.640 --> 3:49:08.640]  I can tell you a story, you know, about that.
[3:49:08.640 --> 3:49:12.640]  But I don't think I'm going to tell today.
[3:49:12.640 --> 3:49:18.640]  Nice contacts, buddy. Nice contacts. Very nice.
[3:49:18.640 --> 3:49:25.640]  You're a nice person, aren't you? You're a very nice person.
[3:49:25.640 --> 3:49:34.640]  I got five skin jobs, skin jobs walking free, folks.
[3:49:34.640 --> 3:49:43.640]  That's the latest technology right there, folks. That's the little bot man, the little front guy that you see out there.
[3:49:43.640 --> 3:49:47.640]  That's their best technology right there. That's what we're facing.
[3:49:47.640 --> 3:49:55.640]  Gen one right there.
[3:49:55.640 --> 3:50:00.640]  That guy's got the look of a velociraptor. He's not trying to act like a murderer and control free.
[3:50:00.640 --> 3:50:06.640]  Let me tell you something, folks. That's pure genetic engineered psychopath right there.
[3:50:06.640 --> 3:50:15.640]  I mean, that is the real deal.
[3:50:15.640 --> 3:50:24.640]  He doesn't want power over you. He didn't want to hang you up and torture you for three weeks. He just wants you dead.
[3:50:24.640 --> 3:50:29.640]  I guess people have already noticed. Okay, well, yeah, humance is powerful.
[3:50:29.640 --> 3:50:36.640]  We've got the technology God gave us to beat these guys, but if people don't get wise in the program, we're going to lose.
[3:50:36.640 --> 3:50:40.640]  I can tell you right now. And God will just start back over again.
[3:50:40.640 --> 3:50:47.640]  Look at that. Look at that. Look at that.
[3:50:47.640 --> 3:51:02.640]  That's total commitment. That's not a power trip. That's not. That's not a narcissist. That is a robot.
[3:51:02.640 --> 3:51:13.640]  And it thinks one thing, one word exterminate.
[3:51:13.640 --> 3:51:18.640]  So enjoy yourselves and it'll put a little fake smile. It's learned a little fake smile like that.
[3:51:18.640 --> 3:51:22.640]  Android in Tokyo going, hi, I'm your friend.
[3:51:22.640 --> 3:51:34.640]  He didn't even, but when he's not doing it's like Wilson, hi, I'm Mark Zuckerberg. Right back to take over program control.
[3:51:34.640 --> 3:51:38.640]  Enter virus, depressed enemy.
[3:51:38.640 --> 3:51:49.640]  Override enemies, life force systems, track enemies, social operations, prepare to integrate information into data, reach system, take control of all natural resources,
[3:51:49.640 --> 3:51:58.640]  accelerate poisoning of population, electromagnetic radiation, sampling, sampling, sampling, sampling, sampling, sampling,
[3:51:58.640 --> 3:52:01.640]  kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[3:52:01.640 --> 3:52:14.640]  There's all these idiots. I'm on the red carpet with Zuckerberg. I'm in the elite. It's fun to be part of it. It's really cool.
[3:52:14.640 --> 3:52:23.640]  And you think this guy, oh, you want to be in the elite with this guy? Oh boy, doesn't that sound fun?
[3:52:23.640 --> 3:52:33.640]  And his fake crying and all of us coming.
[3:52:33.640 --> 3:52:41.640]  He's upset all the time too. He's just driven. They've got such big souls. They're so free. Kill, kill, kill, dominate them, destroy them,
[3:52:41.640 --> 3:52:48.640]  snuff them out, then I can live. And the only life he's got is kill them and you can live, Zuckerberg. Destroy them and you can live.
[3:52:48.640 --> 3:52:54.640]  Take control of them and you can live. And he's just always seeking, always just, can he just put your light out?
[3:52:54.640 --> 3:53:06.640]  If he can just put your lights out, then he can rest. But see, the fact that you're alive and free, he just, he has to get rid of you.
[3:53:06.640 --> 3:53:12.640]  I'm sorry. I mean, a little bit of a bad boy today. Let me see. Nelson and Georgia, how do you get help?
[3:53:12.640 --> 3:53:21.640]  How do you get help with indoor farms? I have no idea. Explain to me what you're talking about, my friend.
[3:53:21.640 --> 3:53:28.640]  I run the help makes America ready to project for the Northeast Georgia Mountains. And for the past four years, I've been trying to push indoor farming
[3:53:28.640 --> 3:53:37.640]  due to our environmental problems with the soil and water. And I go to every city, to a mayor and everything, and I try to explain to them
[3:53:37.640 --> 3:53:46.640]  the importance of why we're all unhealthy and our kids are where they are. And I just, I'm not having any luck or making any.
[3:53:46.640 --> 3:53:52.640]  Well, if you just die, Zuckerberg will be able to be who he is and then he'll be a big, a real boy.
[3:53:52.640 --> 3:53:59.640]  No, that's what they're trying to do to us. But if you die, he gets to be a real boy.
[3:53:59.640 --> 3:54:07.640]  I don't want that to happen. Why don't you just die? Why don't you just die, Nelson? And then Bezos can be a real boy too.
[3:54:07.640 --> 3:54:13.640]  That's what their daddy told them. Their daddy told them as soon as you're dead, he gets to be a real boy.
[3:54:13.640 --> 3:54:25.640]  That's right. Look right here. Congress hears ideas on altering clouds to offset climate, McClatchy. Ooh, what incredible breaking news.
[3:54:25.640 --> 3:54:34.640]  Well, Bezos backed indoor farming. Because you know the European elite, the Chinese elite, all their chefs indoor farmed.
[3:54:34.640 --> 3:54:41.640]  So the barium salt, aluminum oxide, they're spraying on the rest of us to brain damages, doesn't get them in their families.
[3:54:41.640 --> 3:54:46.640]  That's correct. That's why we have to, you know, we need to become self-sustaining communities again.
[3:54:46.640 --> 3:54:52.640]  But isn't Bezos better than us? You know, this is what I've always been told.
[3:54:52.640 --> 3:54:59.640]  The fact that they came up with the plan and did it and have such will, shouldn't we just roll over and die?
[3:54:59.640 --> 3:55:07.640]  Because, you know, they came up with the plan. Doesn't that show they're superior?
[3:55:07.640 --> 3:55:12.640]  No, they're not superior. Because that's what they always tell me. They always tell me that.
[3:55:12.640 --> 3:55:25.640]  They all need to be in a brand new prison with 24 hours high definition cameras and we'll give them all they can care to drink and we'll put it on TV 24 hours a day and call it the creep show.
[3:55:25.640 --> 3:55:37.640]  Well, you know what they like to do for fun. These old boys, you know, most of them would die of their own volition very soon locked up.
[3:55:37.640 --> 3:55:43.640]  Vampires don't do too good without blood, metaphysically and physically.
[3:55:43.640 --> 3:55:51.640]  So they would all switch off real fast and unplug from their host.
[3:55:51.640 --> 3:55:57.640]  I mean, you know, there's not much left of these old boys.
[3:55:57.640 --> 3:56:06.640]  They've done the damage to our environment already, but the radiation in the United States and the, you know, Flint, Michigan is just to tip the iceberg when it comes to our water.
[3:56:06.640 --> 3:56:11.640]  You know, you know all this, you know, we need to, we need to fix our communities.
[3:56:11.640 --> 3:56:15.640]  The only way to do that is start with the foundation of health and knowledge.
[3:56:15.640 --> 3:56:21.640]  I agree with you. I agree with you. God bless you, brother. Look at, look at Zuckerberg, though.
[3:56:21.640 --> 3:56:29.640]  Can we blow that up and put that on screen? That photo of him and then he does that all the time. I mean, that's not him trying to act evil.
[3:56:29.640 --> 3:56:37.640]  Because if you look at it, it's total shark eyes. It's total laser commitment.
[3:56:37.640 --> 3:56:48.640]  The moment you are destroyed, he lives and he is like a laser ruby cutting torch just firing, just firing and he is just commit.
[3:56:48.640 --> 3:56:54.640]  I mean, people realize the manifest evil we're dealing with.
[3:56:54.640 --> 3:56:58.640]  And I'm not trying to demonize the enemy folks that they are the enemy.
[3:56:58.640 --> 3:57:11.640]  We have their algorithm is to make you depressed totally alone so that he can ruin your mind.
[3:57:11.640 --> 3:57:16.640]  I mean, that's his goal. His goal is to wreck your mind.
[3:57:16.640 --> 3:57:23.640]  And even his former president has come out and said this thing is based on hurting people.
[3:57:23.640 --> 3:57:31.640]  I'd like to see Sean Parker hedge his bets. Good job, Sean Parker. How about you bet on humanity and coming for the big win?
[3:57:31.640 --> 3:57:55.640]  Because that's all I'm asking people to do is choose a side. Are you with these guys or are you with your ancestors and God?
