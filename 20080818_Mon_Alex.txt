[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:34.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:34.000 --> 00:52.000]  Oil has rebounded several dollars in price on dollar worries, concerns over conflicts worldwide, as well as a hurricane, tropical storm, preparing to slam into Florida and key refineries in Mississippi.
[00:52.000 --> 00:56.000]  A year later, Fed faces growing financial storm.
[00:56.000 --> 01:10.000]  This is from CNBC. Merrill Lynch to face legal action for security sale have also moved tens of billions of dollars into a British banking group to avoid billions in taxes.
[01:10.000 --> 01:20.000]  Massive developments on the Russian front dealing with the caucuses, peacekeepers, to stay in Georgia.
[01:20.000 --> 01:30.000]  That's how the media is spinning it when all the Russians are planning to do is to leave their original peacekeeping force slightly augmented in Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[01:30.000 --> 01:38.000]  Peacekeepers to stay in Georgia, but it's being spun by the Western media that they have broken the ceasefire and are refusing to pull back.
[01:38.000 --> 01:56.000]  As they pull back, Georgian forces will again pour into the areas they've already attempted somewhat successfully to ethnically cleanse going door to door murdering men, women and children in the two Breckway Republics that have been part of Russia for more than a thousand years.
[01:56.000 --> 02:20.000]  Continuing US Gates scoffs at Russia's warnings to Poland over the missile shield and satellite bases they're handing over as well as the Ukraine Pentagon Chief Robert Gates dismisses as empty rhetoric Sunday Russian warnings that Moscow would target Poland for a possible military strike because Warsaw agreed to host part of the US missile shield.
[02:20.000 --> 02:30.000]  A Pakistani dictator who's been caught in two staged elections, Musharraf, resigns as president, will try to break down that big development that just came the last few hours.
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  Pakistan's president has resigned to avoid impeachment charges. He told the nation during a televised speech.
[02:36.000 --> 02:50.000]  More happens in a month in some cases in history that happens in the previous decade. The psycho Lenin had a good way of saying it that sometimes in a week more happens than in a hundred years was basically the paraphrase.
[02:50.000 --> 03:07.000]  And notice how so much is happening with the economy and with the militaries and with global balance of power. The tumblers are slipping into place all over the place. This is an amazing time to be alive. Policymakers call this a fluid situation.
[03:07.000 --> 03:25.000]  Normally the societal and global and regional and imperial sociological structures are very rigid in a status quo. But during these periods of radical change, the situation liquefies and is more pliable.
[03:25.000 --> 03:37.000]  That means good men and women. That means people that know the truth about government sponsored terror and world government, the new world order and its crimes. We have a great opportunity now.
[03:37.000 --> 03:49.000]  Like never before to have our voices heard and to shape the future. And the new world order knows that they've had to bring in chaos. They've had to liquefy and take out the rigidity of the global structure.
[03:49.000 --> 03:57.000]  Which is very dangerous for them. But as political alchemists, they have to do this to then bring in a greater crisis so they can offer the solution.
[03:57.000 --> 04:08.000]  World government, as Zbigniew Brzezinski is doing in Time Magazine today, how to deal with Russia, basically a strong global government, bringing them into the family of nations but only after they're militarily encircled.
[04:08.000 --> 04:20.000]  You see, they have liquefied the political situation and they want to reform the world in their image under their grid.
[04:20.000 --> 04:27.000]  We need to go in and challenge them at every level by discrediting them, exposing them, showing up their lives and we're doing it.
[04:27.000 --> 04:38.000]  On the London bombing on 9-11, on the Iraq invasion with Iran on what happened in Russia. They're being caught with their pants down, as it is said.
[04:38.000 --> 04:50.000]  So very important information today. We're going to go over all the financial news, what's happening in the Caucasus, what's happening with Iran, a lot of key police state news as well.
[04:50.000 --> 05:00.000]  Just very important broadcast and some special guests. We'll tell you about a little bit later in the show. We're also going to have wide open phones today at 1-800-259-9231.

[08:02.000 --> 08:11.000]  On the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:11.000 --> 08:18.000]  On the economic front, big things are happening. You don't need me to tell you that, but we'll get into the specifics.
[08:18.000 --> 08:45.000]  You see, they know the average person is living hand-to-mouth. The average person, worldwide, not just in the West, is thinking about the news in a perspective of day-to-day.
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.000]  And so they can come out and say, oh, look, oil is dropping, commodities are dropping, the economy is doing great.
[08:51.000 --> 09:03.000]  Meanwhile, we have record bankruptcies, record defaults, homes going into receivership, being repossessed. That's up 55% just in the last quarter.
[09:03.000 --> 09:12.000]  They're now admitting that even with their cooked inflation numbers, that it's double what the Fed had projected at around 6%.
[09:12.000 --> 09:27.000]  It's more like 15, raging, unabated. All the market fundamentals say that our economy is in deep, deep recession, bordering in the future on depression.
[09:27.000 --> 09:38.000]  And we've talked a lot about that here, and almost every major financial expert we've talked to, including Nobel Prize winners and economics, have agreed.
[09:38.000 --> 09:46.000]  But the corporate control press basically will give you bad financial news for a month and give you good financial news for a month and say, this is the end.
[09:46.000 --> 09:54.000]  We're coming out of it. Everything is wonderful when all of the fundamentals show a worsening economic trend.
[09:54.000 --> 10:01.000]  And then what does the Federal Reserve, the private banking structure that owns and controls this nation, through fraud, what is their answer?
[10:01.000 --> 10:09.000]  More issuance of currency, more issuance of liquidity to themselves while they tighten up on credit to the general population.
[10:09.000 --> 10:25.000]  And they may have interest rates down at 3%, but real interest rates are going up to 10%. A lot of people are paying 25% plus percent, and that's compounded on credit cards.
[10:25.000 --> 10:39.000]  How long can they keep this facade going? You know, they report that the crash happened in October of 1929, but it really took about a year of the stock market going up and down.
[10:39.000 --> 10:50.000]  On the same roller coaster we're seeing now before it finally settled in at the lows that it stayed at for the next few years.
[10:50.000 --> 11:02.000]  You look at the market fundamentals and the economic fundamentals and the ratios of debt with private citizens and corporations and governments, local governments, county governments, city governments, state governments.
[11:02.000 --> 11:16.000]  It's an all-time record debt. Meanwhile, they've been taking almost all the tax money at water districts, school districts, cities, counties, states, and putting it into private funds, private investment funds overseas offshore.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  Shored up their assets while leaving us with the bill.
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.000]  A year later, Fed faces growing financial storm.
[11:26.000 --> 11:34.000]  When Federal Reserve officials gathered for their annual Jackson Hole conference last August, Bear Stearn shares were trading at well over $100 apiece.
[11:34.000 --> 11:43.000]  The benchmark federal funds rate was 5.25%, more than double where it stands now, and oil cost $70 a barrel.
[11:43.000 --> 11:51.000]  12 months later, Bear Stearns is gone, as is about $400 billion from banks. They've put out $400 billion in a single month before.
[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  It's well more than that.
[11:53.000 --> 12:02.000]  Ballot sheets, legendary old oilman T-Boon Pickens thinks the days of oil under $100 a barrel may be gone too.
[12:02.000 --> 12:12.000]  Looking back, at 2007, conference provides some cringing moments, cringe-inducing moments.
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  In a speech at the Wyoming Mountain Resort, Fed Chairman Bernanke declared that the central bank was ready to act to shield the economy from the credit crisis,
[12:19.000 --> 12:22.000]  but would not save investors who'd made bad choices.
[12:22.000 --> 12:29.000]  It is not the responsibility of the Federal Reserve, nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions.
[12:29.000 --> 12:32.000]  But he's done that for the banks, not the investors.
[12:32.000 --> 12:40.000]  But said at the time, words that now sound ironic in light of the Fed's role in rescuing Bear Stearns from bankruptcy in March.
[12:40.000 --> 12:47.000]  Now Bernanke is hoping the Fed won't have to act again, and it goes on from there.
[12:47.000 --> 12:50.000]  The Fed hopes it won't have to act again.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  They are destroying the dollar.
[12:52.000 --> 13:00.000]  All the fundamentals of issuing more liquidity, more currency, helicopter bin is only going to kill the dollar,
[13:00.000 --> 13:08.000]  and they can try to pump it up by saber-rattling and global grandstanding to scare the world back into supporting the dollar.
[13:08.000 --> 13:14.000]  But what they give the dollar in support with one hand, they take away with the other.
[13:14.000 --> 13:24.000]  And so much of what we're seeing now was reported on three years ago by the Financial Times of London, the true financial paper of record.
[13:24.000 --> 13:34.000]  And they stated there that the elite are going to bring the world into a global recessionary slash inflationary depression.
[13:34.000 --> 13:43.000]  And that the only point up for discussion and the only debate is whether the elite, the true financial powers,
[13:43.000 --> 13:49.000]  not the guy that lives in a million dollar house on the road from you who you think is rich, but the true billionaires,
[13:49.000 --> 13:59.000]  those that leverage the control trillions, will be whether the global elite can survive an economic implosion and consolidation that they started in motion.
[13:59.000 --> 14:09.000]  That is the only real discussion here. Will they be able to create this black hole of economic implosion and consolidate the power and then maintain it?
[14:09.000 --> 14:17.000]  Or are the economic dominoes that they have set in motion so disastrous that it will bring down their own financial system?
[14:17.000 --> 14:33.000]  And so we stand here watching the control corporate press trying to spin things, telling us that the light is at the end of the tunnel, that everything's going to be okay,
[14:33.000 --> 14:45.000]  that America is back on her feet. Meanwhile, more and more layoffs, more and more factories shut down, more and more families go bankrupt,
[14:45.000 --> 14:58.000]  more and more homes are repossessed, more and more companies downsized, people take massive pay cuts if they're lucky enough to even have a job,
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  or yuppies with two or three degrees to their names who have hundreds of thousands of dollars in college loans that they'll never be able to pay back
[15:06.000 --> 15:17.000]  are working at the grocery store in the morning and at the video game rental shop in the evening,
[15:17.000 --> 15:23.000]  and the government and the state and the social engineers, the social architects get what they want.
[15:23.000 --> 15:32.000]  And what is it that they so dearly desire to destroy families, to destroy the middle class, to wreck free market systems?
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  And that's exactly what they're doing.
[15:37.000 --> 15:49.000]  As the Associated Press reported last week, Walmart in the midst of every other major sector of the economy and every other grouping of retailers,
[15:49.000 --> 16:03.000]  I mean, hundreds of major retailing chains, specialty stores going bankrupt in the last few months, hundreds and hundreds, and Walmart post a 17% profit in the last quarter.
[16:03.000 --> 16:12.000]  That's the black hole. That's an example of this predatory system where they have unlimited slave labor, no environmental standards, no workers comp,
[16:12.000 --> 16:19.000]  no insurance, no social security to pay. It was not free trade. It was not fair trade.
[16:19.000 --> 16:25.000]  It was predatory slave labor being used to criminally destroy the free market.
[16:25.000 --> 16:31.000]  These are monopoly men. That's how they get their power. That's how they get their control.
[16:31.000 --> 16:39.000]  They destroy any chance you have through neo mercantilism of having an independent, strong, vibrant nation.
[16:39.000 --> 16:42.000]  They train you that going into debt is a good thing.
[16:42.000 --> 16:49.000]  That going into debt, they told you in a thousand plus TV programs and financial publications, tens of thousands of times,
[16:49.000 --> 17:01.000]  that it was great to live off of interest on your house, to live off of increasing values in your home in the last decade in the real estate bubble.
[17:01.000 --> 17:14.000]  They advertise that it would never end, and they use that to trick the gullible population into getting into deeper debt so that they could fully implode this economy.
[17:14.000 --> 17:21.000]  But they've done such a good job of it that it threatens to completely implode too quickly.
[17:21.000 --> 17:30.000]  And as the Financial Times of London said many times with their top analysts, the elite want a slow slide, a slow deliberate destruction of the standard of living.
[17:30.000 --> 17:35.000]  I mean, how many UN documents have I read on air? How many times have I heard riding home from work on NPR,
[17:35.000 --> 17:43.000]  them bragging about, oh, global warming and the new global tax and the new global carbon trading systems.
[17:43.000 --> 17:49.000]  This will teach Europeans and Americans not to live too well, not to have too high a standard of living.
[17:49.000 --> 18:03.000]  It is feudalism, it is serfdom, and they planned to have a slow slide into feudalism, into serfdom, into peon systems of control,
[18:03.000 --> 18:09.000]  where you don't have any money to fight back or defend yourself in court or any money to private school or homeschool your children.
[18:09.000 --> 18:14.000]  So both of you have got to work to death to pay those bills.
[18:14.000 --> 18:24.000]  But now they've done such a good job of destroying the economy that it's unraveling too fast for them and they are losing control.
[18:24.000 --> 18:35.000]  It has always been the social architect's goal to create monopolies and destroy all competition of their monopoly of power.
[18:35.000 --> 18:41.000]  Because it is just a monopoly over manufacturing or computing or spying or force.
[18:41.000 --> 18:52.000]  It is a monopoly of the mind. They want a dumbed down, servile population to paraphrase the words of Bertrand Russell,
[18:52.000 --> 19:03.000]  a ruling elite that is so brainwashed and dumbed down and confused and semantically destroyed the language to where a revolt by the middle class
[19:03.000 --> 19:10.000]  and a revolt by the working class would be as ridiculous as a revolt by sheep.
[19:10.000 --> 19:19.000]  Against the practice of eating mutton, which is baby sheep.
[19:19.000 --> 19:27.000]  The practice of eating mutton. That's what they think of us. That's what the social engineers have done.
[19:27.000 --> 19:35.000]  And now the predatory parasitic economy is expanding at record rates.
[19:35.000 --> 19:41.000]  Only by recognizing who has engineered this. Only by recognizing who has laid this trap.
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.000]  Only by exposing and discrediting the New World Order and all of their, quote, solutions,
[19:46.000 --> 19:51.000]  which will just bring us under more of their control, can we reverse this.
[19:51.000 --> 19:57.000]  When we come back, I'm going to break down the mindset of the New World Order.
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.000]  They're going to get more into the economy. Take your phone calls.
[19:59.000 --> 20:01.000]  They're going to do huge developments with Russia.
[20:01.000 --> 20:07.000]  Jim Newcomer from Minus Resources, August 18, 2008. Gold opened at 792.10.
[20:07.000 --> 20:14.000]  One ounce gold coins could be purchased for 816.10, 402.25 for half ounce and 2010.03 for quarter ounce.
[20:14.000 --> 20:18.000]  That's 816.10, 402.25 and 2010.
[20:18.000 --> 20:31.000]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[20:31.000 --> 20:34.000]  With a stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[20:34.000 --> 20:40.000]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency. However, the Executive Order still stands unrepealed.
[20:40.000 --> 20:49.000]  Minus has the Kennedy versus Fed document. Call 800-686-2237. Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[20:49.000 --> 20:58.000]  Call 800-686-2237. If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[20:58.000 --> 21:01.000]  That's 800-686-2237.
[21:01.000 --> 21:08.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[21:08.000 --> 21:11.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[21:11.000 --> 21:14.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[21:14.000 --> 21:18.000]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the collateral commission, the CIFR.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.000]  We sit down and shadow.
[21:20.000 --> 21:27.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of just criticism to grow at our own door.
[21:27.000 --> 21:32.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[21:32.000 --> 21:37.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[21:37.000 --> 21:43.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[21:43.000 --> 21:46.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[21:46.000 --> 22:08.000]  Gas prices are out of control. Fight back by doing what thousands of listeners to the Alex Jones show have done.
[22:08.000 --> 22:11.000]  Developed by a major oil company, a product that really works.
[22:11.000 --> 22:17.000]  Introducing SFR's Protecta Complete Fuel System and Engine Treatment. Just one bottle increases mileage for up to six months.
[22:17.000 --> 22:21.000]  Fleet tested by a major oil company showing improvements in every car tested.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  Stop paying mechanics your hard-earned money to have your injection system cleaned.
[22:25.000 --> 22:31.000]  Protecta cleans up to 95% of new injector condition in just one tank full and is safe for all cars.
[22:31.000 --> 22:38.000]  Tests conducted by General Motors conclude fuel injectors can partially plug in as little as 5,000 miles due to poor gasoline quality.
[22:38.000 --> 22:43.000]  Fight high fuel prices by purchasing a Protecta Fuel System treatment for only $9.95
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  and receive an engine treatment free at $12.95 value.

[23:01.000 --> 23:04.000]  Hello, this is Tom with HempUSA.org.
[23:04.000 --> 23:12.000]  Most of you have been hearing my ads for the past few months and it's no secret that the economy is failing and prices are rising in all sectors.
[23:12.000 --> 23:20.000]  If you've been thinking of a nutrient-dense daily food source and a storable food for yourself and family, the time to act is now.
[23:20.000 --> 23:27.000]  At HempUSA.org, we still believe that food will be your greatest asset in these trying times ahead.
[23:27.000 --> 23:34.000]  Please call 1-908-691-2608 and see what our powder seeds and oil can do for you.
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  Beware, be smart and be ready.
[23:37.000 --> 23:43.000]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at HempUSA.org.
[23:43.000 --> 23:49.000]  Families need this high quality natural food source for its low price and long storage shelf life.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  This incredible food source should be a staple part of your diet every day.
[23:53.000 --> 24:00.000]  Call 908-691-2608 or visit us at HempUSA.org today.
[24:27.000 --> 24:42.000]  The social planners that control both parties 100% of every major nation, except for a handful of rogue countries, want neo-futilism.
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  That's what the Club of Rome states.
[24:44.000 --> 24:51.000]  It is made up of former American presidents, British, European royalty, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  It's all stated, it's all covered in my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[24:57.000 --> 25:04.000]  And they say just thousands of times in these reports that they are going to bring us to subsistence level.
[25:04.000 --> 25:12.000]  They are going to have a social welfare quote net that is there to euthanize us, sterilize us.
[25:12.000 --> 25:24.000]  That is there to kill us, there to carry out their chemical and biological, radiological attacks upon us in a controlled environment to forcibly cull.
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  This is a control freak wonderland.
[25:27.000 --> 25:30.000]  And if you go to the major universities, that's all that's taught.
[25:30.000 --> 25:33.000]  We're evil pigs. We've got too much.
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  We've had too high a standard of living at the rest of the world's expense.
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  And they sell the third world on that.
[25:39.000 --> 25:42.000]  No, no, no, the third world is not going to be allowed to live better.
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  And then we are going to be lowered down to their level.
[25:45.000 --> 25:50.000]  And that is what Barack Obama saying, we're not going to get as much food as we had.
[25:50.000 --> 25:53.000]  And we're not going to be able to drive cars like we were.
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.000]  And we're going to have to live in these compact cities and be highly controlled.
[25:56.000 --> 26:00.000]  And we hear the exact same things out of Gordon Brown and England.
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  And we hear it from the Japanese president.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  This is what they're pushing.
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  And they mean to set it up. They mean to do it.
[26:10.000 --> 26:16.000]  They mean to flood the market with sheep goods, buy up their competition, blow out their competition,
[26:16.000 --> 26:24.000]  use regulators to shut down the family farms and ranches with the animal ID, the premises ID,
[26:24.000 --> 26:27.000]  to shut down the small meat packers.
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  They've already shut down almost all of them to shut down the small refineries.
[26:30.000 --> 26:37.000]  Everything is about consolidation so that they can have their way with us unabated.
[26:37.000 --> 26:44.000]  And if you study the ancient Romans and the Babylonians and every other major culture, the Druids,
[26:44.000 --> 26:53.000]  they all had stylized human sacrifice in the gladiatorial events in the Aztec and Mayan kingdoms in Mesoamerica.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  We've talked about it so much.
[26:55.000 --> 27:03.000]  Imperers always went crazy when societies became decadent and corrupt and began publicly murdering whoever they wanted,
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  engaging in all sorts of bloody, bizarre rituals because 1% of the population,
[27:09.000 --> 27:13.000]  and this has scientifically been studied and proven, around 1%,
[27:13.000 --> 27:20.000]  they're now finding because of the U.S. sick culture and media that they're creating artificial psychopaths.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  So the number is a little bit higher here in the U.S. and a few other nations.
[27:24.000 --> 27:30.000]  But on average, about 1 out of 100, about 1 out of 20 sociopaths doesn't care about you.
[27:30.000 --> 27:37.000]  But 1 out of 100 is a psychopath and enjoys killing and stealing and murdering.
[27:37.000 --> 27:45.000]  And whereas it sounds like absolute abject horror for you or I to want to grab some woman off the street,
[27:45.000 --> 27:54.000]  take her to some shack or some basement, torture her for six weeks, rape her, and then kill her,
[27:54.000 --> 27:58.000]  that is beautiful to the psychopath.
[27:58.000 --> 28:04.000]  But who gets busted? The low-level psychopath who's always in love with themselves and on an insane power trip
[28:04.000 --> 28:11.000]  and has these dark visions while they're killing and torturing, the only time they feel alive,
[28:11.000 --> 28:21.000]  they are the unintelligent or the uncoordinated or what psychiatry calls the uncontrolled psychopath.
[28:21.000 --> 28:26.000]  And sometimes you'll have a somewhat controlled psychopath who may kill 10, 20, 30, 40 people
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.000]  before they finally get sloppy. They may kill one person every six months for a decade
[28:30.000 --> 28:34.000]  and then they get more sloppy and it's one person every month and then two people a week
[28:34.000 --> 28:38.000]  and then they start driving around drunk with machetes and just hacking people up on the side of the road
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  and then they finally get caught.
[28:44.000 --> 28:50.000]  And they tend to come across as being truthful. They tend to come off as charismatic.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  They're in love with themselves. They believe what they're doing is good.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  It's like Ted Bundy had the judge liking him in his murder trial.
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.000]  Have you ever seen the film footage of that with the judge saying,
[29:01.000 --> 29:07.000]  young man, I'd like to know you. I'd like to have you as a son-in-law if you hadn't turned to evil.
[29:07.000 --> 29:13.000]  And that's how he tricked that judge because that judge was judging him by his mindset
[29:13.000 --> 29:23.000]  that he was somebody who just went bad and was loving the compliments and everything that Ted Bundy was giving him.
[29:23.000 --> 29:27.000]  And that's the public buying into Republican, buying into Democrat, buying into these psychopaths.
[29:27.000 --> 29:30.000]  So I'm going to come back, finish up with this, get more into the economy,
[29:30.000 --> 29:34.000]  and then your phone calls at 1-800-25-99231.
[29:34.000 --> 29:37.000]  Because I want to break down how they're building the world.
[29:37.000 --> 29:41.000]  I mean, I've mentioned this, but I want to go into more detail how they're building the whole planet
[29:41.000 --> 29:48.000]  as a wonderland, an amusement park for psychopaths, control for the scum,
[29:48.000 --> 29:51.000]  and they're also turning the world into their environment.
[29:51.000 --> 29:55.000]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[29:55.000 --> 30:22.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:30.000 --> 30:34.000]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality,
[30:34.000 --> 30:37.000]  directly to your computer or iPhone and shared with others.
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.000]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law
[30:41.000 --> 30:45.000]  can be found in this online video library, by weekly news television broadcast,
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[30:48.000 --> 30:51.000]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.

[30:57.000 --> 31:01.000]  bring down the new world order, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[31:01.000 --> 31:04.000]  Hey everybody, if you're anything like me, I'll bet you like to eat.
[31:04.000 --> 31:11.000]  I like egg scrambles for breakfast, fresh homemade bread, delicious pastas like lasagna,
[31:11.000 --> 31:16.000]  I love beef stroganoff, I love chicken noodle soup, I love desserts,
[31:16.000 --> 31:21.000]  all kinds of entrees and soups and desserts and breakfast, I love that stuff.
[31:21.000 --> 31:25.000]  Now food prices are skyrocketing just like gasoline prices.
[31:25.000 --> 31:28.000]  I mean the gasoline prices have gone insanely high, probably going to go higher,
[31:28.000 --> 31:32.000]  grocery prices are right on their heels, how are people going to be able to afford to eat?
[31:32.000 --> 31:36.000]  Well I found a way to buy really incredible foods like I just described
[31:36.000 --> 31:39.000]  at half the price of last year's grocery bill.
[31:39.000 --> 31:42.000]  For less than half of what you spent for the same amount of food last year,
[31:42.000 --> 31:45.000]  I can have it delivered to your door.
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  Let me tell you how, go to efoodsdirect.com right now,

[32:13.000 --> 32:16.000]  This network has just learned of a new video course
[32:16.000 --> 32:19.000]  that reveals the secrets of how to safely prepare and store
[32:19.000 --> 32:22.000]  all types of survival foods in an event of social unrest
[32:22.000 --> 32:24.000]  and food shortages here in the US.
[32:24.000 --> 32:27.000]  Grain shortages and hunger are spreading across the globe.
[32:27.000 --> 32:30.000]  Will troops guard the food supplies in the US this fall?
[32:30.000 --> 32:31.000]  Don't wait.

[33:01.000 --> 33:08.000]  Day after day
[33:08.000 --> 33:11.000]  Alone on a hill
[33:11.000 --> 33:18.000]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
[33:18.000 --> 33:21.000]  But nobody wants to know him
[33:21.000 --> 33:25.000]  They can see that he's just a fool
[33:25.000 --> 33:28.000]  And he never gives an answer
[33:28.000 --> 33:34.000]  The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
[33:34.000 --> 33:41.000]  And the eyes in his head see the world scream round
[33:41.000 --> 33:46.000]  Who on the hill sees the magic, the majesty of life
[33:46.000 --> 33:51.000]  And appreciates the simple things
[33:51.000 --> 33:57.000]  The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
[33:57.000 --> 34:01.000]  And loves the goodness
[34:01.000 --> 34:06.000]  But the dark and controlling and uncreative
[34:06.000 --> 34:09.000]  They seek to dominate and enslave the good
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  They are threatened by the light
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.000]  They seek to build pheasants and armored fortresses
[34:15.000 --> 34:18.000]  In the midst of the common people in their villages
[34:18.000 --> 34:22.000]  And to erect offices and enforcers and bullies
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  To go out and rule over the slaves
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  And that's basically what we face as a society
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  One percent of the population are psychopaths
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.000]  If you're in a crowd of a thousand people
[34:37.000 --> 34:43.000]  There are ten psychopaths among you
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  But psychopaths also tend to congregate
[34:46.000 --> 34:49.000]  And the more intelligent types combine their forces
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.000]  And their strength and are controlled
[34:53.000 --> 34:56.000]  And they can control their impulses for blood
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.000]  And destruction and raw dark power
[34:58.000 --> 35:06.000]  Until they get into positions where they can effectively exercise that power
[35:06.000 --> 35:10.000]  And that's why with a Stalin or a Hitler or a Mao
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.000]  That when they get total power and no one is opposing them in their nation
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.000]  They suddenly start attacking their neighbors and overtaking them
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  And then the next neighbor and the next neighbor
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  They have to have it all
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  And then they start killing their own internal population
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  And stealing the wealth until it destroys the middle class
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  The engine of their original power and their empire begins to implode
[35:30.000 --> 35:34.000]  But the modern psychopaths are so intelligent, so controlled
[35:34.000 --> 35:38.000]  That they've had sociologists and psychiatrists and anthropologists
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.000]  Study this, behavioral psychologists
[35:41.000 --> 35:46.000]  And they write papers and textbooks about how they can keep their grid in place
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  And ensure that it doesn't collapse
[35:48.000 --> 35:54.000]  Now they can head off at the pass every way that free humanity has struggled out of their iron grip
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  In the past
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  And they call that the final revolution
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  It's been written by many historians and many philosophers
[36:07.000 --> 36:10.000]  Going back three, four thousand years
[36:10.000 --> 36:12.000]  Up until current days
[36:12.000 --> 36:15.000]  That for kings and queens and their courts and the elites of old
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  What color they were, what quote race they were
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  We're all the human race, we all behave the similar
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  All behave the same over and over again
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  History repeats itself time and time again because people behave the same
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.000]  Groups combine forces and behave the same
[36:30.000 --> 36:33.000]  We behave the same in group psychology and mob psychology
[36:35.000 --> 36:42.000]  And it's been said that kings and queens and elites war is their profession
[36:42.000 --> 36:47.000]  If you look at British nobility or French nobility, Japanese nobility
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  They didn't work, they didn't work in the fields
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  They didn't go to a nine to five job
[36:51.000 --> 36:57.000]  But they would engage in battle, in conquering, in conquest
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  That was their profession
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.000]  In intelligence, in subterfuge, in espionage
[37:06.000 --> 37:08.000]  And they have studied it for thousands of years
[37:08.000 --> 37:11.000]  And every empire passes on to the next empire
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  It's combined knowledge of control
[37:16.000 --> 37:20.000]  Thousands of years ago, textbooks were written by Julius Caesar
[37:20.000 --> 37:23.000]  And by those before him on statecraft
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  And how to control populations and how to dump populations down
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  And they could write those textbooks, write those books to the gentry
[37:29.000 --> 37:34.000]  To the nobles, to the elites, to their families, to their power blocks
[37:34.000 --> 37:38.000]  And laugh in those books about how the middle class
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  And the working class and the slave class, the bond class
[37:41.000 --> 37:44.000]  Never understood it and never saw it coming
[37:44.000 --> 37:47.000]  And it's become a religion of the elite to detest us
[37:47.000 --> 37:50.000]  And to hate us and to look down on us
[37:51.000 --> 37:55.000]  And that contempt grows after generation for generation
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  Where they get the good medicine, they get the good food
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  They get plenty of sleep
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  And we're the little people, the little slaves feet shorter than them
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.000]  Starving, more genetic disorders, more diseases
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  Or so the elite thought
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  Then they discovered that their inbreeding and their elitism
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  Actually made them weaker and made the people stronger
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  So they built up even greater scientific systems of control
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  And now in the name of environmentalism
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.000]  They are setting up a world tax on breathing
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  On all mammal and all animal
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  And all insect respiration
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  They are making that a crime
[38:35.000 --> 38:42.000]  They are listing carbon dioxide as a poisonous chemical
[38:44.000 --> 38:47.000]  When it is one of the four life-giving elements
[38:47.000 --> 38:54.000]  One of the four needed water, sunlight, oxygen and carbon dioxide
[38:54.000 --> 38:55.000]  Without those
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  Carbon-based life forms cannot live
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  Imagine a world government that taxes and regulates
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  And demonizes the very air we breathe
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  As they create a new religion
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  They take your religions away from you
[39:10.000 --> 39:11.000]  They discredit them, they destroy them
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  They pull them down from within
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  They mock them, they set up pimps in their places to discredit them
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  And then they bring you a new religion
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  Something that makes sense fundamentally to be a good steward
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  To take care of the earth, to not hurt life forms around you
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  And to hence not hurt yourself with toxic waste and chemicals
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  When in reality they are the authors of the toxic waste
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  They are the authors of the true crime
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.000]  The vandalism of the very genetic code of the planet
[39:38.000 --> 39:41.000]  Through the cross-species genetic creations
[39:41.000 --> 39:44.000]  And a thousand plus other abominations
[39:44.000 --> 39:47.000]  They are killing the earth, they are hurting the earth
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  They are irrevocably damaging it
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.000]  While telling us that we need to tax the very air we breathe
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  That's their own statement
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  They move against free speech, they move against the internet
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  They try to bring back in the fairness doctrine
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  They put in their electronic fraudulent voting machines
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  On record to be stealing elections
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  They militarize the police, they put in military control grids
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  So that there is no escape from them
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  So that every avenue is blocked
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  Every avenue of escape is blocked
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  Soon they believe their control grid
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  Their invincible control grid
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  Their invincible prison will be in place
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  The whole world, the prison
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  And they, the wardens
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  They, the insane running the asylum
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  Where they can have their way with you
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  And whatever way they see fit
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  Their mass crimes, more than two thirds
[40:40.000 --> 40:46.000]  Or 67% national average of children
[40:46.000 --> 40:49.000]  On psychotropic drugs that are in foster care
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  On an average of seven drugs
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  And when they're questioned in the Texas legislature
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.000]  Of why in this state 68% higher than the national average
[40:56.000 --> 40:58.000]  Why more than two thirds of the children
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  Are on these dangerous drugs
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  What tests have been done, what screenings been done
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  How do you even know these drugs are good
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  When the drugs show they cause suicide
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  And medical problems, physiological problems
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  Not just mental problems
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  And they're told they come from bad gene pools
[41:13.000 --> 41:17.000]  No judge, no jury, no assessment
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  Oh, you're poor, we're taking you
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  Oh, you're crying for your mommy when you're four years old
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  When we've taken you from your mommy
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  That's mental illness
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  Here, let us give you shock therapy
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  Because we put you on Prozac and Ritalin
[41:29.000 --> 41:32.000]  And you started cutting yourself and crying out for help
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  You've never been like that before
[41:34.000 --> 41:37.000]  But now you don't like being locked in your room
[41:37.000 --> 41:41.000]  And fed three meager meals a day of your lucky
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  Hundreds and hundreds of cases I've seen in the news
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  And they suppress them, there's more
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  Where these foster parents lock children in cages
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  And in some cases feed them one hot dog a day
[41:50.000 --> 41:53.000]  And two glasses of water and they lay there
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  They lay there in fleas and ticks
[41:56.000 --> 42:03.000]  And in feces and urine and dye
[42:03.000 --> 42:04.000]  That's just one of the crimes
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  A million plus children grabbed a year
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  A mass extermination arm going on
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.000]  Wrecking their minds, poisoning them, drugging them
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  And by the time they're 14, 15 years old
[42:14.000 --> 42:16.000]  And dozens of drugs, their minds are blown
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  They then put them in the state hospital for a few years
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  Sucks some more money out of the federal system
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  That pays for bounties to do all this
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  And they throw them out on the road to sit there
[42:25.000 --> 42:28.000]  Talking to themselves, gibbering their minds
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  Destroyed like zombies on the side of the road
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  Begging for money panhandling
[42:33.000 --> 42:38.000]  And you drive by in your SUV and laugh at them
[42:38.000 --> 42:43.000]  That's only one crime of the psychopaths
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  But if only one out of a hundred
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  Or one percent are psychopaths
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  But one out of, you can debate the numbers
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  Some sociologists, some psychologists
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  Say it's one out of 21 out of 40
[42:55.000 --> 42:58.000]  Whatever it is, there's more sociopaths and psychopaths
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  They will serve the dark side
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  They will do whatever is told, whatever is done
[43:02.000 --> 43:05.000]  To them, life is all a competitive ladder
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.000]  To stab people in the back
[43:08.000 --> 43:12.000]  To cheat, to steal, to grovel, to do whatever it takes
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  To put on the corporate garb
[43:14.000 --> 43:19.000]  The clean cut good guy in the suit
[43:19.000 --> 43:22.000]  To do whatever it takes to get that power
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  And then there's still more who aren't sociopaths
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  But are rationalized, just decadent individuals
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  Who aren't even psychopaths
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  But are taking on some of the psychopath's ideas
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  And are beginning to believe that torture of children
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  And murder of a million, two hundred thousand Iraqis
[43:39.000 --> 43:41.000]  Is okay as long as they look different from us
[43:41.000 --> 43:47.000]  And who out of cowardice, who hear about the police state
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.000]  And hear about the checkpoints and go through the checkpoints
[43:50.000 --> 43:53.000]  Through cowardice make the decision, as George Arwell said
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  To engage in crime stop, to decide it's all okay
[43:57.000 --> 44:05.000]  To rationalize it's all right, to go along with it
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  You know, the example I like to use
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  To illustrate what I'm talking about
[44:09.000 --> 44:14.000]  Is that good people are conned
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  And for what they believe is monetary gain
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.000]  They're tricked like an animal, like a little fish
[44:19.000 --> 44:24.000]  In a pond when you drop a worm down on a hook
[44:24.000 --> 44:26.000]  And you can't tell that little mindless fish
[44:26.000 --> 44:29.000]  Don't take the bait
[44:29.000 --> 44:32.000]  But with humans we have a chance that once we've been conned
[44:32.000 --> 44:36.000]  Once we've been ripped off, once we've been scammed
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  To pull out of the scam
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  And see more often than not, people who are being scammed
[44:41.000 --> 44:44.000]  They stay in the scam, they get deeper into the scam
[44:44.000 --> 44:50.000]  They habitualize and create a
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  Six psychological fetish
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.000]  Or they transmute what's happening bad to them
[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  And then rationalize the situation
[45:01.000 --> 45:05.000]  And claim to themselves that they're really in control of it
[45:05.000 --> 45:09.000]  That they're dealing with it
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  That everything's okay
[45:11.000 --> 45:14.000]  You see this with compulsive gamblers
[45:14.000 --> 45:20.000]  Who will bankrupt their family, lose their jobs
[45:20.000 --> 45:26.000]  Do everything, and then suddenly they're robbing banks
[45:26.000 --> 45:29.000]  And none of it makes any sense, it's craziness
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  Or they're stealing from their family
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  Or they're stealing from their job
[45:33.000 --> 45:36.000]  Because they can go back to the craps table
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  They can go back to the poker table
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  They can go back to the slot machines
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  They can go back to the roulette wheel
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  And just try one more time
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  And then they're finally going to make it
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  Then they're going to be able to do it
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  Then they can go back and pay the money back
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  And nobody will know
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  In so many cases with embezzlement
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  When the individuals get caught, they say
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  Well, I was going to pay it back
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  In some cases they even find that at first they do steal money
[46:03.000 --> 46:06.000]  And then pay it back
[46:06.000 --> 46:11.000]  Then they do it over and over again and finally get caught
[46:11.000 --> 46:14.000]  But one of the best analogies is
[46:14.000 --> 46:17.000]  What's been going on for the last at least 10 years
[46:17.000 --> 46:20.000]  They come out of Thailand, they come out of Nigeria
[46:20.000 --> 46:27.000]  They come out of these hives of scum and villainy
[46:27.000 --> 46:32.000]  Where corruption can just run unabated
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.000]  And they target the west, they target the most gullible population in the world
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  Or they target England and Europe
[46:37.000 --> 46:43.000]  But the US is the most gullible, Canada is gullible
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  People who live in a lap of luxury and have done well
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  Because of their ancestors' strength
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  You get an email in your inbox and it says
[46:50.000 --> 46:53.000]  I am the Empress Tabunga
[46:53.000 --> 46:55.000]  I am the Princess Tabunga
[46:55.000 --> 47:00.000]  And somehow my $14 million
[47:00.000 --> 47:05.000]  Got tied up in the bank of Jabugi
[47:05.000 --> 47:11.000]  And because my $14 million got tied up in the bank of Jabugi
[47:11.000 --> 47:16.000]  I need someone to just give me $4,000
[47:16.000 --> 47:19.000]  Because it's a small banking fee, it just got confused
[47:19.000 --> 47:21.000]  It's just quite normal as I said before
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.000]  I'm just contacting you because I hear you're a person
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  Rare taste and understanding
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.000]  And it's just totally ashenite, it's ridiculous
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  Anyone that is living in the real world
[47:32.000 --> 47:35.000]  But they say you are going to get a million dollars
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  If you help me get my $14 million out
[47:37.000 --> 47:40.000]  Here is my phone number, please contact me
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  I am the Princess Tabunga
[47:42.000 --> 47:50.000]  And I have known people, neighbors who believe this
[47:50.000 --> 47:53.000]  I have had callers of the show who have called in over the years
[47:53.000 --> 47:58.000]  I just need $4,000, it's tied up in a bank in Nigeria
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  It's tied up in a bank in Israel, it's tied up in a bank in Thailand
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  And they are going to give me $1 million
[48:05.000 --> 48:08.000]  Or $14 million of it as soon as I get it
[48:08.000 --> 48:12.000]  I need you to have your people call this bank in Nigeria
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  And I'll give the $14 million to you
[48:15.000 --> 48:18.000]  You've heard those callers here
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  I mean this hoax, it's a known hoax for 10 years
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  I even get calls on the show about it
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  I get emails about it every few weeks
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  I've known a guy down the street one time
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  Sort of telling me, yeah, I'm talking to this princess
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  And she just needs $10,000
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  The scam is always very a bit
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  And I'm going to get, you know, 5 million bucks
[48:36.000 --> 48:38.000]  And I'm like, no, no, no, it's from Nigeria, right?
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  Yeah, how'd you know?
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  Let me start looking at your paranoid
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  It's my money
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  That's the American people for you
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  Totally delusional
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  Having no idea what's going on
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  Ready to be raped, ready to be scammed
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  Ready to be taken to the cleaners
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  And the corruption and the scams
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  And the businesses are everywhere
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  The evil is all over the place
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  But you see, that's the psychology
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  Because a lot of people go ahead and sin
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  The 2000, the 4000, the 5000, the 10,000
[49:15.000 --> 49:16.000]  It's always different
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  They go ahead and send it to Nigeria
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  They go ahead and wire it
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  And, you know, they call the number
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  And a man goes, yes, this is Dr. Buzuki
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  Yes, I'm calling for the princess
[49:27.000 --> 49:28.000]  Is she busy?
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  She will call you back in one hour
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  She is with her counselor speaking to her people right now
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  Oh, well, tell the princess, thank you
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  And the princess calls
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  We are prepared for you to talk to the princess
[49:38.000 --> 49:41.000]  Ah, yes, thank you, Mrs. Johnson
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  I have had a very hard time
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  With him and the rebels
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  And I only heard that you were good
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  Who did you hear I was good from?
[49:49.000 --> 49:50.000]  We heard from friends
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.000]  Oh, thank you
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  Oh, princess, oh, you're Highness
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  I'm so honored to speak with you
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  Yes, well, we have heard you are good
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  Is the small amount coming that I...
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  That I need?
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  Yes, I'm going to get it to you right now, princess
[50:05.000 --> 50:08.000]  Oh, I will give it to my associate
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  Dr. Buzuki, please send the money immediately
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  Can you wire it tomorrow?
[50:13.000 --> 50:14.000]  I want to thank you
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  You are now going to be part of my court
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  My court for doing this
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  When I come to New York, I will see you
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  Oh, princess, thank you, oh, princess
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  And they send the 4,000 and then a month later
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  Princess, princess, when do I get the money?
[50:29.000 --> 50:30.000]  Well, the things are tough now
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.000]  They are not giving me the money, I need 5,000 more
[50:33.000 --> 50:36.000]  Oh, princess, yes, oh, princess, yes
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.000]  And then they give the princess 5,000
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  And they start calling talk shows
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  Help me, Alex, they...
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  I've given them 10,000 of my money
[50:45.000 --> 50:48.000]  Princess says I'll get it as soon as I give them this
[50:48.000 --> 50:51.000]  And see, they can't admit they've been conned
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  It's the same thing with George Bush, Barack Obama
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  Bill Clinton, the New World Order
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  It's a liberal's conservatives, they can't...
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  It's just like a Nigerian scam
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  It's just a little more sophisticated
[51:01.000 --> 51:05.000]  Alabama State Code makes it illegal to drive barefoot
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  In Minnesota, you can be fine for displaying
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  that your vehicle is for sale
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  Those are obviously not made to protect us
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  but instead to help states profit
[51:17.000 --> 51:20.000]  The use of red light cameras is another great example
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  and cost you valuable time and money
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  Sprayyourplate.com is a spray on photo blocker
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  that protects against red light cameras,
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  toll cameras and speed cameras
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.000]  One application lasts a lifetime, is undetectable
[51:35.000 --> 51:38.000]  and each can covers up to 4 license plates
[51:38.000 --> 51:41.000]  Simply spray it on, let it dry, and you're protected
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  All orders are kept strictly confidential
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  and for the month of August, receive free shipping

[51:51.000 --> 51:54.000]  That's 1-800-276-9601
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.000]  or go to sprayyourplate.com
[51:56.000 --> 51:58.000]  That's sprayyourplate.com
[51:58.000 --> 52:01.000]  Don't give your money to the state, spray your plate
[52:01.000 --> 52:02.000]  Hey Clyde!
[52:02.000 --> 52:03.000]  What's up, Bonnie?
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  Well, I got a question about those shielded
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  secure sleeves from Identity Stronghold
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  Yeah, the sleeves that block us
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  from stealing account numbers from the new credit cards
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  with RFID chips. What about them?
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  Well, I mentioned them to our friends
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  and they went in for purchasing the secure sleeves
[52:17.000 --> 52:18.000]  Oh, Bonnie?
[52:18.000 --> 52:21.000]  If everyone starts hearing about the secure sleeve,
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  it'll destroy our plan to steal credit card numbers
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  at the mall with my new RFID reader
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  I know, but these are our friends, Clyde
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  They promise not to tell anyone else
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  I guess you're right, that's what friends are for, I suppose
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  Tell them they can get a 5 pack of secure sleeves
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  that will fit credit cards and driver's licenses
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  for $19.95
[52:37.000 --> 52:40.000]  And Identity Stronghold also has a 3 pack of secure sleeves
[52:40.000 --> 52:42.000]  for passport books for $14.95
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  And where do they buy them?
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  They can buy them online or get a mail-in order form
[52:46.000 --> 52:48.000]  at idstronghold.com
[52:48.000 --> 52:50.000]  idstronghold.com
[52:50.000 --> 52:52.000]  Okay, well what if they don't have the internet?
[52:52.000 --> 52:56.000]  They can call 1-800-610-2770
[52:56.000 --> 52:59.000]  That's 800-610-2770
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  Thanks, Clyde
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  and we knew what to do
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  or at least we thought we did
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  that finally gives first responders a platform
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  to tell their story
[53:17.000 --> 53:20.000]  Whitman, EPA director
[53:20.000 --> 53:23.000]  on the 18 made a statement
[53:23.000 --> 53:26.000]  that the air was safe to breathe
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  as brave souls throughout the world
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  take action against their global masters
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  He had his hand over the radio
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  while he was getting a countdown
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1
[53:39.000 --> 53:42.000]  and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
[53:42.000 --> 53:45.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  and aggressively spread it worldwide
[53:51.000 --> 53:54.000]  or order the DVD at infowars.com
[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  If we don't expose the government sponsored terror
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  they're going to commit more acts
[53:58.000 --> 54:13.000]  and bring in martial law
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  So with the Nigerian scam
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  they send you an email saying
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  you're going to get tens of millions of dollars
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  and you make a small investment
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  Now you're on the hook
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  and instead of realizing I'm an idiot
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  I'm a fool, I've been scammed
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  You're going to scan, you commit to it
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  You tell family, no, I haven't been scammed
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  No, it's not a scam
[54:33.000 --> 54:36.000]  I'm going to make millions, you're going to see
[54:36.000 --> 54:41.000]  and I've had those callers on the go
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.000]  call in and say
[54:44.000 --> 54:46.000]  I'm getting all these millions, Alex
[54:46.000 --> 54:48.000]  and I'm going to help you as soon as I get it
[54:48.000 --> 54:50.000]  from this Nigerian princess
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  or this Malaysian princess or whatever it is
[54:52.000 --> 54:54.000]  It's generally just a handful of countries
[54:54.000 --> 54:56.000]  and I tell them sadly, I go, it's not real
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  and they go, shut up, you're bad
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  and then they'll be on the internet
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  on some Google page saying
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  Jones is a CIA agent
[55:04.000 --> 55:06.000]  he's trying to keep me from getting the 14 million
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  and then it just goes into schizophrenia
[55:08.000 --> 55:10.000]  He says it's not real, he's a liar
[55:10.000 --> 55:14.000]  I'm going to give more than Nigerians
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  and I remember in college
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  I only went to college for two years
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  and I'd be hanging out over at buddies' frat houses
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  and things, never joined one
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  and it was always the case
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  when I was hanging out
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  at wealthy frat houses
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  where I had friends that I worked out with
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  or UT football players
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  that's where it was thick as fleas
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  you would hear, ooh, that guy
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  yeah, he didn't go into college
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  he's just staying here, he's real rich
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  he's an aster
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  he's a Rockefeller
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  and the person would walk
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  into a bar or restaurant
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  there'd be all these good looking girls
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  we'd be sitting there drinking beer
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  and they'd be like, it's him, it's the aster
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  and I'd go, you know, I've heard of scams
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  where then they always need a loan
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  because they were having a trust fund problem
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  and they're going to pay you back
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  does he drive a fancy car?
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  he's staying with Jonathan right now
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  he's staying over
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  at this apartment with somebody
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  he's just run away from his family right now
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  he's upset, he's about to get a billion dollars
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  and he just, oh, oh
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  how did you know about the loan?
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  did you tell you? my friend Betsy
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  she just gave him 20,000
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  and I probably saw that
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  I mean, it's just con artists everywhere
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  it's just scam artists everywhere
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  I'm a Rockefeller
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  I'm a, but I need it
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  and then, I was telling Bermas
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  about this a few months ago and he said, oh
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  you know, I grew up in upstate New York
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  but also grew up some in Long Island
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  and then Rob was talking about it
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  there's always these people saying they're asters
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  or Rockefellers or Carnegie's
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  and not just with the college kids
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  they blow into the
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  the
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  country clubs and they show up in a fancy suit
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  you ever seen
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  what's that movie with Cain
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  and
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  the other guy
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  they're two con artists conning each other
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  and they're in the south of France
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  scamming all these rich
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  single women
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  I mean, just incredible
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  incredible
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  and it's the same thing
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  and they come in and they've always got
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  an incredible investment that nobody can be
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  part of and then always
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  the blue haired
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  want to be a restocrats, you know, who've got
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  10 million bucks in the bank, they feel like
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  it's so great that they now know a Rockefeller
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  or Rothschild or an Aster
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  that they're like, they'll even tell their husbands
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  there's divorces over it, I'm investing
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  a million with Count Vibhulbrob
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  I'm investing it
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  with the Countess
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  there's nothing you can do to stop me
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  and that's all the New World Order is
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  they're slicker con artists
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  I mean, if you study how the Rothschilds got in power
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  it was giving loans behind the scenes
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  you'd have a
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  there were, I don't know, more than 10 different
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  royal sectors of what Germania was
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  Germany today
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  it was broken up into counties
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  and you read the histories where the Rothschilds
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  and their moneylenders
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  the king would be mad at his
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  local duke would be mad at his wife
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  and would cut her off for allowance
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  well the Rothschilds would just go get her in debt
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  and scam her and get her in a scam
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  and then have intrigue in
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  basically that's all the New World Order is
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  psychopathic
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  henchmen and some psychos
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  in control, a bunch of con artists
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  who just run around scamming us
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  through government, scamming us through everything
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  and they just take it over the world
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  and the bottom feeders are crawling all over us
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  and the public's dumbed down and defenseless
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  thank you for listening to GCN
[58:45.000 --> 58:47.000]  be sure to visit GCNLive.com
[58:47.000 --> 58:49.000]  today
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  it is a big idea
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  a New World Order
[58:55.000 --> 58:57.000]  in the near future
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  Earth is dominated by a powerful
[58:59.000 --> 59:01.000]  world government
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  it's known as the Builder Bird
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  what their objective would be
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  world domination
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  for thousands of years their dark order grew
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  now as they hail the birth
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  of the New World Order
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  their great dream of exterminating
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  80% of humanity is at hand
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  for the first time in history
[59:21.000 --> 59:23.000]  the elites plan for world
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  government is blown wide open
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  you will learn the secret that drives
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  the entire New World Order agenda
[59:29.000 --> 59:31.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress
[59:31.000 --> 59:33.000]  toward a world government
[59:33.000 --> 59:35.000]  they're not after money they have all the money

[59:47.000 --> 59:49.000]  in game blueprint for global enslavement
[59:49.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  have been warned
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  I said we would have open phones today
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  for the full four hours and we will
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  I got off into a rant
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  about con artists
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  people coming into small towns
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  big cities
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  there's got to be millions of them
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  they've always been there it's the same old scams
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  they show up they find out who's
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  weak in your family or your business
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  they tell you there's a get rich quick scheme
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  a Ponzi scheme
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  and they come into the country club
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  and they tell you they're always a Duke
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  or a Duchess or they're royal
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  it's the same system over and over again
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  and they find out who's gullible
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  and then once a person's been sucked in
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  they can't admit they were conned
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  and it'll ruin marriages it'll ruin everything
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  a lot of people end up giving everything
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  they've got to a con artist
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  and they'll be homeless still admitting
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  I just don't know why the Duke
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  did that to me
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  you can always tell
[1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  these sociopaths
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  because a lot of times
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  these con artists are
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  they're able to con you because they're delusional
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  they believe their own scam
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  and that's what government is
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  I mean they come out and tell you
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  that Russia
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  attacked Georgia the public believes it
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  they come out and they tell you the dollar
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  strong
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  there's people all over wall street going on the news
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  saying the dollar hadn't lost any value
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  it's a conspiracy theory
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  they'll come out with this outrageous statement
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  that there's no new world order no one's calling for it
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  they'll come out on CNN
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  and say there's no trans-Texas corridor
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  when it's all over Texas thousands
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  of miles of road and the signs are everywhere
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  and there's PSAs on TV and at the theater
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  you know the movies they have ads
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  doesn't exist
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  and see the public doesn't want to admit they've been conned
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  by the media the culture of the government
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  they've bought into it so if CNN says
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  and Fox says
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  there is no trans-Texas corridor
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  Texans will say to my face there isn't one
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  doesn't matter there's billboards
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  announcements
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  kind of like that police chief in Austin
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  I mean he may not know the feds put microphones
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  in that Austin runs it but I do it's been in the paper
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  maybe he doesn't know
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  maybe he's lying
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  the point is is that we know the facts
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  we know the government's gone bad
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  and we also know the public
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  doesn't want to admit up to that because it's so scary
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  I mean it's worse than just
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  sending five thousand dollars to the Nigerian
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  email scam thinking you're going to get a million back
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  and not wanting to pull out of it
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  and sending them the next payment and the next
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  I've seen it reported in the news where people
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  have paid as much as a half million dollars
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  to the Nigerian scam from an email
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  you know you send out an email to a million people
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  saying send me five thousand dollars
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  you get a million back you're going to get people
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  to take it because they want to believe their lucky
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  day has come
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  and these yuppies want to believe
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  that the earth is really dying from carbon
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  to oxide then it's a deadly toxication
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  not the life-giving gas on the planet next to oxygen
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  they really want to believe they're part of
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  something good they don't want to admit they've been
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  scammed and conned with all their
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  environmental bumper stickers
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  they don't want to admit they've been lied to
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  conservatives don't want to admit they've been lied
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  to about George Bush being a good conservative
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  and a great American
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  you can give them mainstream articles about
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  gay porn stars and madams visiting
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  hundreds of times at midnight and they'll
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  just say you're a line piece of crap
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  you can show them video of Bush kissing him
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  on the head at a press conference
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  they'll just say SHUT UP COMMUNIST
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  or you tell a liberal that and they'll be
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  quiet fascist

[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  Euro shares rise
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  buoyed by oil and miners
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  commodities going back up
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  continuing
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  we are going to get into Merrill Lynch
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  getting in trouble for running a bunch of criminal scams
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  also peacekeepers to stay in Georgia
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  Gates
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  threatening Russia
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  sharp resigns
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  we are going to break that down
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  George and President Chesvilly eats his own
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  tie on live TV
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  looks like something out of a Charlie Chapman
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  skit starts acting completely nuts
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  chewing on his tie
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  like a complete mental patient
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  live on TV
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  Iran warned
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  not to allow war pretext
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  by Saudi and Egyptian leaders
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  China to overtake US
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  this is largest manufacturer
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  this is not our headline
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  at prisonplanet.com
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  sounds like one of ours
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  this is the mail online out of England
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  rounded up into torture camps
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  the undesirables China doesn't want you to see
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  well we've got one they torture you
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  it says with big signs
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  that they're going to be using cattle prods
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  and that giant FEMA camp
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  they've built out in Denver secretly
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  the police with a secret camp
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  yeah the police you can really trust them
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  totally criminal
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  totally criminal to do that
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  the government's criminal it's gone it's shot
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  not green
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  NBC Beijing outdoor set air conditioned
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  outdoors
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  see even those criticizing the fake environmental movement
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  for the global carbon tax only criticize
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  how they're a bunch of hypocrites
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  they have a bad carbon footprint
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  which only legitimizes all this bull
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  TV news ratings and newspaper ratings
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  continue to plunge lawmakers take up the battle
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  light bulb band with these highly toxic
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  deadly light bulbs they want us to put in
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  I mentioned this last week but I want to
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  spend more time on it today
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Texas school district letting teachers carry guns
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  that's just some of the news I've got that I'm going to be going over
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  today but right now let's go to Warren
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  and Michigan Warren you're on the air
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  hi Alex I thought
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  a caller to your show yesterday and he kind of
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  an interesting point he was saying
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  well suppose we have a revolution
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  and then we've got all these elites
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  left over what we're going to do with them
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  and his point was we should execute them
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  so to be sure they won't
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  keep oppressing us
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  the point I wanted to make was
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  the ancient Greeks had solved that problem
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  they had a practice known as
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  ostracism
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  and I never hear of ostracism
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  yeah that's the old thing
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  put them on a deserted island
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  yeah and candidates
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  for ostracism didn't necessarily commit any crimes
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  they were just people who had too much inter flaws
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  yeah but that was used by the
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  by the very elites to oppress anybody that challenged
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  the criminal state
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  that's why you need a bill of rights constitution
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  where everybody's due process is protected
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  you don't punish classes of people
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  you individually
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  if they committed crimes
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  then investigate them and indict them
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  with a grand jury
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  I thought
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  the original
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  purpose of ostracism was so the people could
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  you didn't have to wait for somebody
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  to commit a crime if he became somebody that
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  well you know what a crime was
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  which one was it
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  was it Aristotle or one of the others
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  Socrates was Excel
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  but I was going to mention something else
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  which one was made to drink Hemlock
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  Socrates
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  and then there was another one they threw off a cliff
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  one of them was trying to teach
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  the young to question the government
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  and the elites they made him kill himself
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  others they murdered and so that was their idea
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  of quote this pure democracy
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  it was not a democracy
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  it sounds like the original idea
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  was corrupted and perverted
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  well that's it that's why our system
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  is not perfect but it's the best
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  ever devised our republic
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  hasn't failed we have failed it
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  but you don't ever want to say
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  we are going to punish the landed class
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  because the elites
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  are normally the authors of that
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  and they will direct a mob
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  led by one of their front men
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  to actually go steal from the middle class
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  because the poor think that anybody
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  who's got five dollars more than them is the elite
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  I mean poor people think somebody
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  in a Cadillac with bling
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  that's what bling is all about just the mindlessness
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  of my gosh he's got some gold around his neck
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  he's rich
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  no really rich people hide it
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  there's secretive about it they're low key
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  well I think
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  David Rockefeller was up for ostracism
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  I think I'd vote in favor of it wouldn't you
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  yeah but see you don't want to start
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  voting people out of the country
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  you want to investigate
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  David Rockefeller for his crimes
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  which are legion you then want to
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  indict him and convict him
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  and then have the state law
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  carried out against him
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  okay Alex I guess that's about all I had to say
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  thank you yeah
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  we don't want a french revolution where one group of
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  rogues takes over
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  and six months later another group takes over
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  from them and then there's another revolution
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  you end up with what you had in
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  Rome where you'd have
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  a new emperor every six months or so
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  and it was always whoever the last praetorian
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  leader of the praetorian was
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  I mean that's how
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  third world nations are in Asia and Latin America
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  you know the president's always
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  just some general who took over
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  and then you know he gets killed
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  in a few years there's some new guy
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  the middle class
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  has to get together go in
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  and take over the government set up checks and balances
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  to lower the size of government
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  make it very small and only big enough
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  to keep tyrants from coming to power
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  limited
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  tied down and then
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  we have to be armed aggressive
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  build up our individual organizations against tyranny
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  and
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  then you become a land of milk and honey
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  like the United States or Switzerland
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  let's go ahead and talk to
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  Seth and Arkansas, Seth go ahead
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  hey Alex
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  hi
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  I met you in New York on 9-11 last year
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  I'm a change member
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  I actually did the Clinton confrontation
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  in Mississippi
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  where he said we may not be perfect
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  we don't blow up our own building
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  I'm also in the New World Order film
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  with Tom and Andrew
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  and Luke with those guys with you as well
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  anyway Saturday night I just moved back
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  to Fayetteville, Arkansas
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  which is kind of like Austin you know
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  yes
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  and Saturday night I was out on Dixon streets
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  which would be about like being on 6th Street in Austin
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  and I was out with some meeting
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  up with some friends
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  I had had one drink probably about
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  11 o'clock or something like that
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  anyways I was hanging out dancing about
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  1 at 1.30 in the morning
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  I come out of the
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  establishment I was in
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  and I see police has roadblocks set up
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  so I go up there
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  and I start talking to a female officer
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  and I was asking her about the roadblock
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  and she said to me
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  you know what I mean
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  I asked her was it a normal thing
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  she said they were doing it for public safety
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  anyways I started recording it with my camera phone
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  she came up to me
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  and she told me to
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  go home
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  go home
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  you thought you were in a free country
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:57.000]  you thought you'd videotape a fourth amendment
[1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  a checkpoint that treats everybody as if they're a criminal?
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:01.000]  yes sir
[1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  so she told me to go home I said no ma'am
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:05.000]  I don't have to go home on public sidewalk
[1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  so she came up to me and started asking
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.000]  for my ID
[1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000]  so what happened next
[1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:13.000]  okay so she asked for my ID
[1:16:13.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  I said ma'am am I being detained
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:17.000]  am I being detained
[1:16:17.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  she said give me your ID
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000]  and it went on like that for a couple minutes
[1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.000]  and I have video of all this
[1:16:23.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  it's up on YouTube now
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  the video will play some of it

[1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  I looked at her
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:27.000]  I said Alex I told her I said

[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:09.720]  smirking the whole time they were happy they tore my wallet apart right in front
[1:34:09.720 --> 1:34:13.760]  of me you know what I mean just just trying to dig I just I just tried to
[1:34:13.760 --> 1:34:17.440]  stay calm I was watching them kick dudes butts in the jail I was like hey I need
[1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:20.840]  to calm down they were like you need to shut up boy you better shut up boy I

[1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:53.080]  case did something bad I saw the guy in Target and I walked up to him when he
[1:37:53.080 --> 1:37:56.480]  was with his wife and I said what you do is wrong what you've been doing is wrong
[1:37:56.480 --> 1:37:59.800]  killing people's dogs when you come in their houses shooting their Chihuahuas
[1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:03.720]  their labs I said you ought to be ashamed of yourself and the guy was shaking
[1:38:03.720 --> 1:38:08.720]  and he said how do you know who I am and I said because I know what you look

[1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:02.720]  the public around and other some officers here I'd like to talk to you
[1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:06.160]  privately about where things are going you know let them know that we're aware
[1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:09.400]  of what's happening and stand up and speak out and you'll find other like
[1:55:09.400 --> 1:55:17.200]  minded people that are concerned as well and then just say no to this and
[1:55:17.200 --> 1:55:23.600]  realize how insulting and how dangerous and how outrageous I mean I see videos
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:29.160]  every day of somebody on a bicycle and the cops just tackle them and then
[1:55:29.160 --> 1:55:33.240]  savagely almost kill them in some cases I see videos of police actually meeting
[1:55:33.240 --> 1:55:36.680]  people to death and then they charge their dead bodies with assaulting the
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:40.160]  officers to protect themselves and then go to court with video of the person
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:43.840]  never touching them and they have these vetted handpicked juries that are all
[1:55:43.840 --> 1:55:48.080]  wives of cops who come in and I mean I mean you never forget Kelly rushing he
[1:55:48.080 --> 1:55:52.200]  gave out of videotape two videos one with Ron Paul a speech he gave in 2003
[1:55:52.200 --> 1:55:59.520]  called neocond 47-minute speech and he gave him a road to Terry and and in and
[1:55:59.520 --> 1:56:05.840]  in Lyon County Kentucky the county court had the trial I called the judge at home
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:09.320]  and then then it was in the newspaper they said he is charged with anti-police
[1:56:09.320 --> 1:56:15.680]  videos the cops were totally warped the state police they actually believe Ron
[1:56:15.680 --> 1:56:19.320]  Paul isn't allowed to speak on the floor of the house they actually believe that
[1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:27.240]  my road to tyranny was quote anti-law enforcement and so illegal just like we
[1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:31.920]  have in road to tyranny Abby Newman pulled over at a warrantless checkpoint she
[1:56:31.920 --> 1:56:35.240]  says no you can't search my car without a warrant they'd grab her out of the car
[1:56:35.240 --> 1:56:39.000]  she doesn't resist and they pull the pocket constitution out of the back of
[1:56:39.000 --> 1:56:42.520]  her car and they and they start breathing heavy oh my god I can't believe
[1:56:42.520 --> 1:56:47.640]  she's I mean that sounds like a Monty Python skit or a twilight zone where
[1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:52.360]  officers find a constitution in there my god look at all this paraphernalia look
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:55.400]  at this thing and is she allowed to have that should we charge her for this
[1:56:55.400 --> 1:57:00.040]  paraphernalia and then the commander goes I don't know because he's a smart
[1:57:00.040 --> 1:57:06.280]  one maybe she's allowed to have that just take her in take her in for all of
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:11.760]  this and the word Patriot upset her upset them because it was Patriot games
[1:57:11.760 --> 1:57:18.760]  with Harrison Ford that they got saw that and he's got the word Patriot you
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:24.480]  see totally out of their minds brainwashed just gone and then we have
[1:57:24.480 --> 1:57:29.960]  that same film this is pre-911 the footage Kansas City was like September

[1:57:39.880 --> 1:57:43.280]  of the government the founding fathers were bad the Bill of Rights is bad
[1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:46.320]  anybody that talks about the Bill of Rights is bad and we have the training
[1:57:46.320 --> 1:57:52.680]  manuals that say it before that we have the video of them training from it and
[1:57:52.680 --> 1:57:56.280]  these cops get into a role where they're the good guys there are protectors and
[1:57:56.280 --> 1:58:00.840]  then if FEMA tells them the founding fathers are bad the officers were in
[1:58:00.840 --> 1:58:06.720]  there agreeing they were they were agreeing these bad people and then the
[1:58:06.720 --> 1:58:10.200]  law enforcement magazines and publications but law enforcement technology

[2:00:29.960 --> 2:00:34.920]  babies we have engaged in all forms of crimes against innocent nations we have
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:39.880]  funded every evil regime on the planet and it's all coming home to ruse what the
[2:00:39.880 --> 2:00:42.720]  globalists have done in third world nations they're now going to do here
[2:00:42.720 --> 2:00:48.120]  absolute destruction of the middle class bondage enslavement degradation totally
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:53.280]  pathetic and when Kelly rushing got arrested a few years ago for handing on
[2:00:53.280 --> 2:00:57.240]  a Ron Paul video one of my videos he was charged with both three-year counts on
[2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:01.480]  both of a threat to the police saying the Ron Paul videos and it went to trial
[2:01:01.480 --> 2:01:05.000]  and the judge sat there and said send this man to prison these videos are
[2:01:05.000 --> 2:01:09.960]  illegal and the jury found him not guilty and then a week later the police
[2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:13.880]  started parking outside his ranch we were well-to-do well-known family in the
[2:01:13.880 --> 2:01:20.480]  area highly respected founders of the community later found out and they
[2:01:20.480 --> 2:01:23.800]  arrested Kelly and one of his friends horseback riding they claimed they were
[2:01:23.800 --> 2:01:28.760]  drunkenly riding horses and of course they weren't drinking and so it goes the
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:34.360]  evil must win evil has to show you when you fight back they come in ten times
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:44.280]  harder you know we come back ten times harder just to see our country going into
[2:01:44.280 --> 2:01:49.080]  hardcore bondage tears me up Brendan we're going to talk to Brendan Jeremy and

[2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:06.160]  out to Denver I wanted to talk to you a little bit about the DNC and in the
[2:02:06.160 --> 2:02:10.560]  police state but first um I heard you had the money master's guys on a few
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:14.880]  weeks ago and I do the Liberty dollar out here and I kind of wanted to respond
[2:02:14.880 --> 2:02:19.800]  to that and give the listeners just a real quick economics lesson and how to
[2:02:19.800 --> 2:02:23.520]  beat the New World Order is that you can't beat them none of this stuff you
[2:02:23.520 --> 2:02:27.400]  do calling Congress well that's another story it's totally legal there are
[2:02:27.400 --> 2:02:30.960]  hundreds of mints putting out their own gold and silver coins but they're now
[2:02:30.960 --> 2:02:34.920]  arresting people who have those there's and they go ahead and beat you up and
[2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:38.600]  then that's the charge but they also throw a counterfeiting on but then the
[2:02:38.600 --> 2:02:42.600]  coins totally legal people are being arrested for $2 bills all over the
[2:02:42.600 --> 2:02:47.280]  nation I've seen at least probably more than 10 cases the last few years the
[2:02:47.280 --> 2:02:51.760]  public is so dumb and and looking for crime they're told spy on everyone but
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:54.240]  there's nothing to really spy on other than the illegal aliens running around
[2:02:54.240 --> 2:02:57.280]  everywhere but that is selectively enforced people are now arrested for $2
[2:02:57.280 --> 2:03:00.200]  bills for the Declaration of Independence on it because the public are
[2:03:00.200 --> 2:03:04.520]  just mindless scum there's cases were more than a dozen cops show up at Best
[2:03:04.520 --> 2:03:08.600]  Buy and still arrest and then and then they still charge you even though the
[2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:13.360]  $2 bill is real because the judges and the and then the grand juries can't
[2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:18.840]  admit they were wrong so people are now charged for legal tender money sorry go
[2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:22.760]  ahead yeah well what I was gonna say is there's no way to beat them unless you
[2:03:22.760 --> 2:03:27.200]  stop their money period because they're always gonna have more than everybody
[2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:31.760]  else and I can be able to now they arrest you for even using their money see
[2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:37.200]  everything we have to do with videos are legal cash is illegal the public are
[2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:43.480]  just grueling zombies just just all into themselves watching TV all day just it's
[2:03:43.480 --> 2:03:47.520]  all over we're totally screwed scum everywhere trash and felt everywhere
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:50.800]  you're all gonna get raped by the New World Order just get ready for it unless
[2:03:50.800 --> 2:03:55.560]  we totally fight back now and have some shame for what we are and then will
[2:03:55.560 --> 2:03:58.560]  refuse to admit that they're conning that you should really talk about the
[2:03:58.560 --> 2:04:02.280]  economists they've been to Harvard and Yale because they're all convinced I took
[2:04:02.280 --> 2:04:05.080]  economics in school and they start off talking about how the government
[2:04:05.080 --> 2:04:08.560]  influences economy this thing never economist don't exist I'll be like a

[2:09:22.800 --> 2:09:26.280]  as crazy people that believe in a new world order and they say it doesn't
[2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:30.120]  exist just like they're saying we're liars and that Russia snuck attack
[2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:40.200]  Georgia I mean it is it is just such a willful wanton denial and wanting to be
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:48.080]  conned and giving yourself over to total delusion I mean it is a fact that the
[2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:51.920]  government is rogue and criminal and has murdered tens of thousands of
[2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:55.840]  children of children and chemical biological and radiological test tens of
[2:09:55.840 --> 2:10:00.360]  thousands of us citizens I mean the murderers these are the worst psycho
[2:10:00.360 --> 2:10:04.800]  killers ever that's who runs things to create the cadres of scientists and
[2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:09.680]  killers and they're building the psychopathic wonderland of world
[2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:13.640]  government so no nation can rise against them so no empire can rise against
[2:10:13.640 --> 2:10:19.600]  them so no people can rise against them for 50 years really for 55 60 years
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:23.800]  they've been creating cadres of killers in this country our heroes are jack
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:26.720]  bauer who tortures children to get answers out of their parents that's
[2:10:26.720 --> 2:10:30.560]  really in the real white house memos the the Pentagon admits that they're
[2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:34.520]  basically funding that show all these other shows where we are becoming evil
[2:10:34.520 --> 2:10:37.960]  it isn't enough to kill 50 million babies in this country it isn't enough to be
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:41.440]  euthanized and old people coast to coast I mean I can bring on wall street
[2:10:41.440 --> 2:10:44.600]  journal writers who've been been there when people are chained out begging for
[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:47.720]  food and water when they're under state control and they're denied water for 14
[2:10:47.720 --> 2:10:51.560]  15 days I'm not talking about terry shyville I'm talking about the media
[2:10:51.560 --> 2:10:55.240]  use that because she did look like a vegetable so they could sell you on but
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:10:57.920]  they're killing people every day everywhere every time we have a guest on
[2:10:57.920 --> 2:11:00.680]  about it nurses call in and admit they've had to quit working at different
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:04.400]  hospices and hospitals because they're murdering people I mean we got evil
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:09.720]  going on all around us it's hurting the police the military all of us everywhere
[2:11:09.720 --> 2:11:13.000]  thousands of troops are dropping dead from vaccines the last couple years
[2:11:13.000 --> 2:11:16.760]  they're not they're not telling them what the shots are now when they're dying
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:20.880]  if they're lucky and I say if they're lucky you know why I say if they're lucky
[2:11:20.880 --> 2:11:24.320]  because a lot of times they're paralyzed or they bleed out or they just turn
[2:11:24.320 --> 2:11:28.160]  excruciating pain for a few years and then die they're all testing chemical
[2:11:28.160 --> 2:11:33.720]  and biological weapons on you and I know it for a fact and I have to sit here and
[2:11:33.720 --> 2:11:39.000]  deal with a public that are like a bunch of children living in denial about what
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:42.320]  we're up against and then I don't want to go to martial law I don't want to go to
[2:11:42.320 --> 2:11:45.760]  World War three I don't want to go into depression and everything the Pentagon
[2:11:45.760 --> 2:11:48.720]  said they do everything North com said they do they're getting everybody
[2:11:48.720 --> 2:11:53.120]  ready for martial law all the federal funds are flowing for quote anti
[2:11:53.120 --> 2:11:56.160]  terrorism to run random checkpoints they're getting us all prepared and
[2:11:56.160 --> 2:12:00.480]  trained and it's so horrible and it doesn't need to happen it's a bad dream
[2:12:00.480 --> 2:12:07.880]  it needs to stop and I love my family and then they pass a law where if I wanted
[2:12:07.880 --> 2:12:11.160]  to try to get out of the nation with just enough money to live on I couldn't do
[2:12:11.160 --> 2:12:14.960]  it they wouldn't let you leave with your money now they have deals with every
[2:12:14.960 --> 2:12:19.000]  nation in the world to take your money even Switzerland and not even let you
[2:12:19.000 --> 2:12:24.320]  leave unless you're an elitist and then it's all selectively enforced it's shot
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:29.320]  folks it they have spun an incredible spiders web to capture us it only waking
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:34.160]  up and going completely ape are we gonna be able to break out of this alright I'm
[2:12:34.160 --> 2:12:39.520]  gonna let Jeremy and Denver finish up Jeremy you were telling us how the the
[2:12:39.520 --> 2:12:42.860]  point is you're right they are threatened and when they are arrested von
[2:12:42.860 --> 2:12:48.160]  Nuthouse for putting out his legitimate he used to run the Hawaiian men for
[2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:52.160]  putting out ever rested them well okay grabbing his stuff and and they stole it
[2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:55.800]  they don't have anything to they'd have to go to a trial and no jury in the
[2:12:55.800 --> 2:12:58.600]  world would claim that we're counterfeiting arresting arresting his
[2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:03.000]  material shutting his facility down go ahead yeah and in the problem is that's
[2:13:03.000 --> 2:13:06.480]  their biggest Achilles heel especially with silver because gold the Rothschild
[2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:11.920]  have most the gold but see they put you into a put you into a process sir they
[2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:15.600]  see you see over out there for them to take for them to control it so if we
[2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:19.320]  monetize silver there's nothing they can do about it they're just that they're
[2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:23.600]  left with a bunch of pieces of paper enough now but right now right now we
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:26.880]  just need to try to even hold on to cash even though it's theirs they're trying
[2:13:26.880 --> 2:13:30.640]  to get rid of that in a casual society they'll have total control yeah but
[2:13:30.640 --> 2:13:33.520]  whenever you use their money you're seeding power to them because what you're
[2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:37.880]  doing is is you're giving your time and energy for nothing of theirs except it
[2:13:37.880 --> 2:13:41.840]  basically like if you work for a month putting it making the sculpture and then
[2:13:41.840 --> 2:13:45.400]  you trade it with me I just printed up a picture on my computer that here you go
[2:13:45.400 --> 2:13:49.280]  it took me 30 seconds that's how they get all their power it feels cheated well
[2:13:49.280 --> 2:13:51.840]  that's what everyone does when they go to catch their check the bank they just
[2:13:51.840 --> 2:13:56.400]  spent two weeks to get a handful of paper and see it seems like well I can go
[2:13:56.400 --> 2:13:59.920]  and turn this in because we have what's called legal tender laws which is
[2:13:59.920 --> 2:14:04.320]  another orwellian word because legal tender people thinking their head all
[2:14:04.320 --> 2:14:08.960]  of it's not legal tender that must mean it's illegal no legal tender means that
[2:14:08.960 --> 2:14:13.120]  you're forced to accept it at the barrel of a gun that's why our founders said
[2:14:13.120 --> 2:14:16.360]  only gold and silver can be legal tender that's the only thing you should be
[2:14:16.360 --> 2:14:20.400]  forced to accept and actually Thomas Jefferson said not even that he said
[2:14:20.400 --> 2:14:24.060]  there shouldn't be legal tender laws period you can request to be paid in
[2:14:24.060 --> 2:14:27.760]  pigs if we're under Jeffers no I agree and I hear you and I appreciate your
[2:14:27.760 --> 2:14:34.300]  call listen my only point is silver and gold and I was trying to barter with
[2:14:34.300 --> 2:14:38.560]  it is not the only Achilles solo the New World Order and it's a huge long-term
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:43.520]  plan that's very hard to implement even if you can try to get the dumb down
[2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:48.520]  population who thinks silver coins are illegal I mean they're just that stupid
[2:14:48.520 --> 2:14:52.440]  you try to convince these idiots of anything they can't even think so I
[2:14:52.440 --> 2:14:57.840]  mean what's even I just discussed me the public they're they're supine willful
[2:14:57.840 --> 2:15:02.680]  ignorance they're gibbering smiles there their love of being slaves their love
[2:15:02.680 --> 2:15:08.800]  of lies their their love of being conned and taken for a ride they just
[2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:13.640]  absolutely love it they revel in it but we do need to start our own gardens we
[2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:16.160]  need to start bartering with our neighbors we need to start realizing we
[2:15:16.160 --> 2:15:20.800]  don't need all this Walmart junk we do need to try to become self-sufficient
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:30.360]  because we had a depression 70 something years ago 80 years ago and 90% of the
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:36.720]  public was self-sufficient and 8 million people start now 90 plus percent are not
[2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:42.440]  self-sufficient and don't even know how to really wipe their noses or brush
[2:15:42.440 --> 2:15:45.960]  their teeth they don't even know what country they're in what continent they're
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:51.240]  on how the what the they're just totally in La La Land at low level bestial you
[2:15:51.240 --> 2:15:57.840]  know level of just just satiating their basic senses and trying to reach out to
[2:15:57.840 --> 2:16:06.360]  them is is is like trying to talk to an amoeba you know and God help us God
[2:16:06.360 --> 2:16:10.200]  help us God help us God help us and a lot of these people they think you're
[2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:13.520]  showing off to try to warn them or if you know facts or if you know how to
[2:16:13.520 --> 2:16:16.560]  speak to them or if you warn them about something you're like you know how to
[2:16:16.560 --> 2:16:26.760]  talk you got book learning you're some kind of fancy let's go to De Leon in
[2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:36.760]  North Carolina good afternoon Alex hey man well hey um I recently have been
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:44.360]  trying to campaign against the Florida waters here in the Durham area and it
[2:16:44.360 --> 2:16:49.560]  seems I've even done a radio program on the station out in Greensboro if you
[2:16:49.560 --> 2:16:55.760]  have been here but um it seems though every person I talked to whether they
[2:16:55.760 --> 2:17:01.920]  be a dental hygienist a dentist or a dental assistant I cannot get anybody
[2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:06.920]  to stand with me and try to take act and try to take action on this thing well
[2:17:06.920 --> 2:17:10.840]  they won't stand when the CPS takes their children without due process when
[2:17:10.840 --> 2:17:14.600]  some fat pedophile comes to their door to steal their children and chop and
[2:17:14.600 --> 2:17:18.960]  last them so they're certainly not gonna stand with you to do anything and
[2:17:18.960 --> 2:17:21.640]  they're not gonna stand up for their country their dollar their future they're
[2:17:21.640 --> 2:17:24.880]  they're gonna be taken over they're gonna be rolled I mean they're they're
[2:17:24.880 --> 2:17:28.760]  fat dumb and happy and made for the pickings but you but there are a lot of
[2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:31.400]  cities throwing fluoride out of their water and there are places where people
[2:17:31.400 --> 2:17:34.920]  are taking action and I would just you don't need them to stand with you you
[2:17:34.920 --> 2:17:38.840]  be some dumb dental hygienist some idiot dentist who believes they're working for
[2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:41.720]  the system doesn't think they're doing any wrong you've just got to print up
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:45.400]  where the dental association has admitted that children don't need fluoride
[2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:49.000]  that's bad for them and where the EPA admits it's toxic and bring those
[2:17:49.000 --> 2:17:52.400]  studies into the city council and go in there every week for the next year
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:17:55.440]  pointing out the sodium fluoride is deadly and they won't take it out of the
[2:17:55.440 --> 2:17:59.000]  water people should at least properly filter their water and that and you'll
[2:17:59.000 --> 2:18:01.760]  educate hundreds of people that are every that are at every city council
[2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:04.440]  meeting and then you can start being known as the fluoride guy it's going to
[2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:08.480]  take long-term commitment and if the scum won't stop putting our water we
[2:18:08.480 --> 2:18:13.120]  can at least go out and tell the public not to put it in their water and let me
[2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:16.360]  tell you what you can do you can buy time on a local radio station on a
[2:18:16.360 --> 2:18:21.120]  Saturday or Sunday night do be called the water man and do two hours every week
[2:18:21.120 --> 2:18:27.040]  on GMO foods other things but sponsor yourself by selling water filters which
[2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:31.800]  will then help people not have the poison and will fund your show so you have
[2:18:31.800 --> 2:18:37.200]  to be up to you have to fund your military operation to save people you
[2:18:37.200 --> 2:18:41.680]  this is all special forces operations against the enemy and so instead of
[2:18:41.680 --> 2:18:45.720]  trying to get the enemy to take the water out you know the cowardly pieces of
[2:18:45.720 --> 2:18:50.320]  filth on the city council it's like when I had the state of turning on from
[2:18:50.320 --> 2:18:53.160]  Maryland and he said yeah I don't vaccinate my children but we're saying
[2:18:53.160 --> 2:18:56.680]  it's the law all other children do and they lined up with police dogs barking
[2:18:56.680 --> 2:19:01.440]  at them thousands up to be injected total hoax total either is no law again
[2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:04.360]  and evidence of the public's totally in the dark doesn't know they're having a
[2:19:04.360 --> 2:19:07.520]  hole in the ground totally lied to the cops are there in riot gear with dogs
[2:19:07.520 --> 2:19:12.040]  barking at them because it was a national news with him showing off look at
[2:19:12.040 --> 2:19:15.520]  how these slaves don't know that it's not the law and how we can intimidate
[2:19:15.520 --> 2:19:20.040]  them through total fraud to take deadly injections you see how that works I
[2:19:20.040 --> 2:19:25.360]  mean it's just it's such a lies it's unspeakable the scale and breadth of it
[2:19:25.360 --> 2:19:30.360]  and just the fraud everywhere so that's how you find them you get on the foam
[2:19:30.360 --> 2:19:34.680]  you buy your first five water filters you start a little website that's got an
[2:19:34.680 --> 2:19:39.520]  easy name you know like Durham water or something and then you go and you pay
[2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:42.640]  for a local radio show and you go on there and talk about water you have
[2:19:42.640 --> 2:19:46.240]  guests on you talk about other issues don't just be a one-trick pony and then
[2:19:46.240 --> 2:19:49.800]  you fund your radio show with that and then you become a leader and you warn
[2:19:49.800 --> 2:19:53.560]  thousands you won't warn them all a lot of them want to die bone cancer and die
[2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:57.320]  kidney failure they love it they love the fluoride attacking every organ they
[2:19:57.320 --> 2:20:02.120]  love dying but at least you can warn some other people all right did you know

[2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:19.000]  tearing my fingernails out trying to get out and I can't believe my fellow
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:23.760]  lemmings just think it's all funny thousands of studies the sodium fluoride
[2:24:23.760 --> 2:24:28.800]  attacks every gland in Oregon hundreds of mainline studies that it more than
[2:24:28.800 --> 2:24:33.160]  doubles the chance of boys particularly getting bone cancer they've done
[2:24:33.160 --> 2:24:37.400]  studies now over 50 years of areas with sodium fluoride in the water versus not
[2:24:37.400 --> 2:24:40.840]  and you don't find any of these rare bone cancers there and you find them all
[2:24:40.840 --> 2:24:47.320]  over the place with the fluoride and I get mad and I scream and yell it just is
[2:24:47.320 --> 2:24:51.280]  never gonna end don't you understand you dumb cops you dumb citizens that this
[2:24:51.280 --> 2:24:57.240]  isn't funny this is real eugenics you're under eugenics attack God I'm trying to
[2:24:57.240 --> 2:25:03.360]  help you man we don't have a lot of time here former White House historian and
[2:25:03.360 --> 2:25:08.200]  analyst NASA consultant Washington Post writer Richard C. Cook with 30 minutes
[2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:10.840]  then Ray McGovern won the Russia situation he's had a week and a half to
[2:25:10.840 --> 2:25:14.600]  analyze it he's joining us I said I'd go to your calls and I've been out of
[2:25:14.600 --> 2:25:20.920]  control today Steve in Colorado you're on the air get me Steve first of all
[2:25:20.920 --> 2:25:27.360]  Alex I'd like to echo the comments of Steve from Utah that said thank you and
[2:25:27.360 --> 2:25:32.200]  all your staff for what you're doing and the people that really understand what's
[2:25:32.200 --> 2:25:35.920]  going on Alex we know that you're speaking the truth so you know when they
[2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:39.240]  attack you that's the way when the people attack you like they called you
[2:25:39.240 --> 2:25:43.320]  that right-wing fascist as you said in the New York Times the only thing that
[2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:48.360]  they can do is sit there and try and smear people because they certainly can't
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:51.280]  fight against people like you with the truth because they know that you're
[2:25:51.280 --> 2:25:55.560]  speaking the truth and what they're speaking is trash so anyway just want
[2:25:55.560 --> 2:26:00.880]  to mention that and then also you had mentioned you know your comments just a
[2:26:00.880 --> 2:26:04.080]  few minutes earlier about God help us well he's the only one that's going to
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:09.000]  pull us out of this Alex I know but I mean I'm coming face-to-face every day
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:13.000]  I get higher levels of knowledge and study of this it's like once you kind of
[2:26:13.000 --> 2:26:16.320]  become quote a master once you've really been studying something a long time it
[2:26:16.320 --> 2:26:20.160]  becomes exponential and I won't say I'm a master of anything but compared to a
[2:26:20.160 --> 2:26:25.240]  lot of people I am and it's blowing me away just how prevalent evil is yeah
[2:26:25.240 --> 2:26:29.320]  and it's not just in the government of the cops it's everywhere I mean the
[2:26:29.320 --> 2:26:33.400]  listen to the cops have a tough job the public's degenerating out there that's
[2:26:33.400 --> 2:26:37.880]  right it's like zombies fighting zombies it's just unbelievable it's true it's
[2:26:37.880 --> 2:26:42.360]  true and and what's going on is the world is degenerating into the world of the
[2:26:42.360 --> 2:26:46.480]  Antichrist is spoken of in Revelation listen I always believe that in my spirit
[2:26:46.480 --> 2:26:49.440]  and know that but I'm telling you more than ever I think I mean it's really
[2:26:49.440 --> 2:26:54.000]  starting to freak me out it is it's when you when you read Revelation look how
[2:26:54.000 --> 2:26:58.080]  dark things are and how he can how the Antichrist kills like two billion people
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:03.200]  yeah it's just it's amazing or or like a third of the population of the earth
[2:27:03.200 --> 2:27:06.520]  and so we're gonna have to get there and that's exactly what's going on and if
[2:27:06.520 --> 2:27:11.920]  you look at scriptures in Daniel specifically Daniel 723 where it talks
[2:27:11.920 --> 2:27:16.480]  about the world is broken down into 10 regions that's happening right now and
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:20.000]  that's what the club of Rome and the UN made it and they call it 10 kingdoms
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:23.920]  that's exactly that's in the extras of in-game I mean they even follow the
[2:27:23.920 --> 2:27:29.320]  nomenclature exactly exactly right on and it's one of them South America then a
[2:27:29.320 --> 2:27:33.920]  course in North American Union is one the European Union of course the Mediterranean
[2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:38.400]  the asian young yeah well that's another thing they've now officially last year
[2:27:38.400 --> 2:27:44.880]  made the APEC the Asian Union a union and then people write big editorials in
[2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:48.600]  newspapers saying I'm a liar it doesn't exist it's like saying Tokyo doesn't
[2:27:48.600 --> 2:27:52.680]  exist well except well once again Alex that's the only thing they can say the
[2:27:52.680 --> 2:27:55.800]  only thing they can say is denied that the truth is going on and there's so
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:27:59.680]  many people out there that believe them that's what so just believe the Bible
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:04.200]  talks about them being given over to a strong delusion yeah and they are they
[2:28:04.200 --> 2:28:08.760]  are given over to it it's true they wouldn't know a semi truck it was running
[2:28:08.760 --> 2:28:13.800]  over them yeah and it I'll tell you it's it's really coming down to those who
[2:28:13.800 --> 2:28:18.280]  know the living God and those who are going to end up end up you're right it
[2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:22.000]  comes down to that they love death they love disease and wickedness and in
[2:28:22.000 --> 2:28:26.160]  sorrow and they just love it and I can't believe it I mean I got three
[2:28:26.160 --> 2:28:29.040]  children and it just freaks me out every second I'm thinking about them now
[2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:32.640]  just realizing their innocence their goodness and how filthy this world is
[2:28:32.640 --> 2:28:36.000]  and it's only going to hell in a handbasket we have evil people below
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:41.200]  evil people above evil everywhere it's just growing that's right and there's
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:45.560]  and the real shame of it is there's so many people that sacrifice so so much
[2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:51.760]  for the building of this country and and it's almost like it's just going on
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:57.480]  their sacrifice it's like seeing your beautiful wife dead covered in sores
[2:28:57.480 --> 2:29:01.080]  with maggots all over that's what this country looks like to me you know it
[2:29:01.080 --> 2:29:04.480]  just you see something beautiful and good and wholesome but it's worse than
[2:29:04.480 --> 2:29:08.320]  that it's like your beautiful wife has been turned into a demon or
[2:29:08.320 --> 2:29:11.920]  something and I don't know how to describe it it's like it's just everything
[2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:15.640]  good watching it be torn to hell and it's even tearing me up it's even making
[2:29:15.640 --> 2:29:19.800]  me freak out and then and be crazy I mean it's like it's just unspeakable
[2:29:19.800 --> 2:29:24.400]  yes it is yes it is but I'll tell you the living God is going to be the only
[2:29:24.400 --> 2:29:29.720]  the only out for for us I mean you can't trust in the government as you
[2:29:29.720 --> 2:29:33.080]  demonstrated pretty much you know that they're not going to protect and you
[2:29:33.080 --> 2:29:36.600]  can't trust in all these phony churches folks you better get right with God you

[2:33:04.560 --> 2:33:09.160]  the Russian conflict started he's a former top CIA analyst for all Reagan
[2:33:09.160 --> 2:33:14.160]  George Bush senior top analyst in you know general overall world affairs we

[2:33:21.880 --> 2:33:24.760]  many other publications he has testified before Congress before

[2:33:44.560 --> 2:33:50.320]  minutes right now he is Richard C. Cook and I wanted to get him on to talk about
[2:33:50.320 --> 2:33:55.280]  first a what we see with the economy with all the deepening economic numbers
[2:33:55.280 --> 2:33:58.960]  versus manipulation of the stock market that was still plunging today and then
[2:33:58.960 --> 2:34:03.440]  also what happened with the situation with the United States that's proxy
[2:34:03.440 --> 2:34:09.280]  attacking Russia about 11 days ago and the reigniting of the Cold War and this
[2:34:09.280 --> 2:34:14.440]  mass hoax of saying that Russia attacked Georgia and now moving missile
[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:19.400]  systems weapon systems satellite systems into Poland Czech Republic NATO's new
[2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:22.760]  public doctrine which the Russians have read on television freaking out that
[2:34:22.760 --> 2:34:27.720]  NATO may launch a sneak nuke attack on Russia saying many the anti-missile
[2:34:27.720 --> 2:34:33.920]  system so the US and NATO can nuke Russia and so Russia can't defend itself and
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:39.200]  so any retaliatory strike will be shot down this is just absolutely incredible
[2:34:39.200 --> 2:34:42.480]  these developments so that's basically why we have you Richard thanks for
[2:34:42.480 --> 2:34:50.760]  popping in today you've got the floor okay hello Richard here to me what is
[2:34:50.760 --> 2:34:57.360]  really interesting is the connection between the two major events that you're
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:35:04.640]  talking about the economic collapse and the confrontation now that's building up
[2:35:04.640 --> 2:35:10.320]  with Russia because these things don't happen in a vacuum it's very
[2:35:10.320 --> 2:35:17.080]  interesting obviously they are trying to keep the economy afloat until the
[2:35:17.080 --> 2:35:23.240]  election in November and it's starting to me to look more and more like they're
[2:35:23.240 --> 2:35:31.600]  trying to kind of back McCain into the election Obama's numbers are pretty poor
[2:35:31.600 --> 2:35:36.400]  the Democrats should be way ahead in the polls now and obviously Obama's not it's
[2:35:36.400 --> 2:35:41.520]  a virtual dead heat which says to me that they're trying to now maneuver
[2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:47.640]  McCain back in there by keeping the gas prices down a little bit and keeping the
[2:35:47.640 --> 2:35:52.280]  loans rolling over so the economy doesn't just collapse in a heap between now
[2:35:52.280 --> 2:35:59.680]  and then but I think that we have here a classic wag the dog syndrome Ellen
[2:35:59.680 --> 2:36:05.000]  Brown had a good article on global research with that as the title the
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:09.080]  other day and it seems to me that this whole
[2:36:09.080 --> 2:36:17.120]  confrontation with Russia now is a move of desperation because the people in
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:24.200]  charge of the US economy don't have a clue what to do about the extraordinary
[2:36:24.200 --> 2:36:30.800]  explosion of debt that keeps building up and now we have with the bailout of
[2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:36.280]  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac we have according to the experts who are
[2:36:36.280 --> 2:36:41.920]  watching that another three to four trillion dollars in debt piled on the
[2:36:41.920 --> 2:36:47.280]  already 10 to 11 trillion dollars in the national debt that the government has
[2:36:47.280 --> 2:36:53.080]  just taken on so the financial position of the United States is increasingly
[2:36:53.080 --> 2:36:58.520]  hopeless it is a state of de facto bankruptcy which has really been
[2:36:58.520 --> 2:37:03.240]  acknowledged now for two to three years by economists very close to the Federal
[2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:07.720]  Reserve they don't have a clue as to what to do about it so not knowing what
[2:37:07.720 --> 2:37:11.160]  to do when your economy is collapsing why not have a nice big war with
[2:37:11.160 --> 2:37:17.760]  somebody in the hope that through such an event they could wipe the debts off the
[2:37:17.760 --> 2:37:23.840]  book and try to start over again but of course for anyone who has to live on this
[2:37:23.840 --> 2:37:29.400]  planet right now it's a potential catastrophe that's brewing so that's
[2:37:29.400 --> 2:37:31.960]  my take on it
[2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:42.680]  Richard continue well let's let's Steve even take a step back in in history a
[2:37:42.680 --> 2:37:48.680]  little bit I've always been interested in the historical background to our
[2:37:48.680 --> 2:37:57.800]  relations with Russia because up until 1991 in any case the United States and
[2:37:57.800 --> 2:38:05.800]  Russia were the two major superpowers but this kind of a division or this kind
[2:38:05.800 --> 2:38:11.200]  of a split in in the power structure of the Western world has been going on a
[2:38:11.200 --> 2:38:15.000]  long time if you go back in history which I'm starting to do I'm doing a lot
[2:38:15.000 --> 2:38:20.960]  of research lately on the origins of the of the present situation the Western
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:29.960]  European civilization which formerly was in the Western European democracies
[2:38:29.960 --> 2:38:34.200]  until they self-destructed in World War one and World War two now lies in the
[2:38:34.200 --> 2:38:39.240]  United States and the Eastern European civilization which formerly was the
[2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:47.360]  Eastern Orthodox branch of the church and the Eastern Byzantine Empire and
[2:38:47.360 --> 2:38:52.360]  then it evolved on to Russia as Russia increasingly became a power and you know
[2:38:52.360 --> 2:38:57.440]  it was Russia when Napoleon invaded Eastern Europe that finally put Napoleon
[2:38:57.440 --> 2:39:01.680]  in his place and became the dominant power in Europe for a while so now we
[2:39:01.680 --> 2:39:08.280]  have a really an age old split between the Western part of the European
[2:39:08.280 --> 2:39:12.240]  civilization which now the United States and Britain really are the
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:16.920]  representatives of and the Eastern part of the European civilization which
[2:39:16.920 --> 2:39:23.760]  Russia represents that now have the face off that began after World War two
[2:39:23.760 --> 2:39:28.400]  continuing and it's not really a cup of you know some people are saying that
[2:39:28.400 --> 2:39:33.280]  this is a renewal of the Cold War well it's much worse than that the Cold War
[2:39:33.280 --> 2:39:38.200]  in a way was a fake it was cold absolutely explain that because we
[2:39:38.200 --> 2:39:41.720]  had the banking establishment here financing them and kind of using the
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:46.840]  communist as a wicked doppelganger for them to go take over new lands and
[2:39:46.840 --> 2:39:50.880]  infiltrate and kind of a front to overthrow us the situations do you
[2:39:50.880 --> 2:39:56.480]  agree with that analysis oh yes absolutely the Russia that we allied
[2:39:56.480 --> 2:40:02.400]  with in World War two was a creature of Western finance that's that's very clear
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:05.560]  from the historical record by the way I want to point something out I've never
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:09.680]  knew your opinion on that but you're a historian and that's the factual history
[2:40:09.680 --> 2:40:13.360]  and so I just knew how to finish your sentence there and that's why I
[2:40:13.360 --> 2:40:17.600]  obnoxiously do that sometimes listeners because I want to point out to people
[2:40:17.600 --> 2:40:20.920]  we're reading from the same sheet of music and don't even know it because
[2:40:20.920 --> 2:40:25.040]  we're just giving you the facts this is a new Russia a rogue outside the New
[2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:28.720]  World Order all evidence shows and they're clearly trying to encircle it
[2:40:28.720 --> 2:40:36.200]  the Cold War was cold this is hot on the borders with Mother Russia which hasn't
[2:40:36.200 --> 2:40:40.440]  been tried since Operation Barbarossa and before that with Napoleon as you just
[2:40:40.440 --> 2:40:44.760]  said yeah that's that's correct because all through the Cold War there was
[2:40:44.760 --> 2:40:52.360]  never any danger of an American soldier in uniform facing off against a Russian
[2:40:52.360 --> 2:40:57.600]  soldier in uniform and pulling the trigger at each other that was very
[2:40:57.600 --> 2:41:03.760]  carefully avoided everything was done through proxy it was done through you
[2:41:03.760 --> 2:41:08.880]  know the different satellites far removed proxies other far removed
[2:41:08.880 --> 2:41:13.560]  proxies now we're right there up against Mother Russia if we send uniform
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:20.160]  personnel on the ground into Georgia we're running a risk of the first time
[2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:25.680]  in history of American uniform personnel and Russian uniform personnel
[2:41:25.680 --> 2:41:30.280]  shooting each other this is what the Bush administration is getting us into
[2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:34.840]  well I agree but I want to go back go back to 99 Wesley Clark with the
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:39.360]  neocons the Russians pour into pristine of the capital of Kosovo the
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:42.800]  Russians are saying you're not gonna have to cleanse with the Muslims our
[2:41:42.800 --> 2:41:47.880]  Serb brethren in Kosovo and then Wesley Clark ordered the bombing of the
[2:41:47.880 --> 2:41:53.880]  airfield but Sir Peter Jackson the head of NATO overruled him and said no so we've
[2:41:53.880 --> 2:42:00.040]  seen this lust since the supposed fall of 91 to engage them is this a reigniting
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:04.680]  or how does that fit in no it's part of the same thing really because after
[2:42:04.680 --> 2:42:09.760]  91 everyone said well cold war is over now we're going to get the peace
[2:42:09.760 --> 2:42:16.720]  dividend and before you know it NATO under Clinton was in their bombing of
[2:42:16.720 --> 2:42:23.680]  Belgrade and dismembering Yugoslavia it was all part of the same plan
[2:42:23.680 --> 2:42:29.000]  the same program to encircle the Soviet Union and notice how they're just
[2:42:29.000 --> 2:42:33.400]  switching the last letter of Iraq with Iran it's the same thing with Serbia
[2:42:33.400 --> 2:42:39.320]  versus now these breakaway areas with Russia because then they said the Serbs
[2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:43.000]  attacked which wasn't true both sides obviously it's ethnic warfare were
[2:42:43.000 --> 2:42:46.160]  killing each other but the Serbs were clear the ones being attacked by the
[2:42:46.160 --> 2:42:51.640]  KLA backed by the US and NATO in southern Serbia in Kosovo it's the same
[2:42:51.640 --> 2:42:56.200]  thing here the public believes that Russia attacked for no reason well
[2:42:56.200 --> 2:43:02.360]  that's correct and of course Serbia has been a Russian ally and in a sense a
[2:43:02.360 --> 2:43:09.640]  Russian dependency all the way back prior to World War one and the trap that
[2:43:09.640 --> 2:43:16.920]  was set by the people who started World War one in Serbia had the Russians
[2:43:16.920 --> 2:43:20.600]  behind it so the Russians always had as part of their sphere of influence
[2:43:20.600 --> 2:43:24.400]  Serbia and that part of the Balkans because they're Slavic people it was
[2:43:24.400 --> 2:43:27.720]  all part of the general Russian policy of Pan-Slavic and that's where they
[2:43:27.720 --> 2:43:32.960]  stopped the Muslim invasions twice yes that that that's correct and and of
[2:43:32.960 --> 2:43:38.840]  course that goes all of that takes us back to the fact that Russia has always
[2:43:38.840 --> 2:43:44.840]  been the guardian of the Orthodox Church and kind of the overseer of the
[2:43:44.840 --> 2:43:49.280]  Eastern Christian religion now if you want to talk about that divide that began
[2:43:49.280 --> 2:43:54.240]  with what was called the great schism in 1054 AD yes and and what we're seeing
[2:43:54.240 --> 2:43:57.720]  today you know believe it or not you know people don't know no Rome is
[2:43:57.720 --> 2:44:03.440]  obviously behind the European Union and so and yeah break that down yeah we are
[2:44:03.440 --> 2:44:10.400]  seeing in fact a continuation of the same split between Eastern and Western
[2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:15.600]  Europe that we have seen for a thousand years and what it is in fact a lot of
[2:44:15.600 --> 2:44:20.200]  people have have realized that and you read Patrick Buchanan's book on the
[2:44:20.200 --> 2:44:27.720]  unnecessary war that just came out World War I and World War II were civil wars
[2:44:27.720 --> 2:44:35.760]  between different elements of European culture they were the same racial
[2:44:35.760 --> 2:44:40.600]  groups the same people from the same civilization fighting and killing each
[2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:45.680]  other and they've been doing this for a thousand years you could carry that out
[2:44:45.680 --> 2:44:51.680]  into today's situation and say that the division between the United States as
[2:44:51.680 --> 2:44:56.480]  the representative of the Western European civilization and Russia as the
[2:44:56.480 --> 2:45:02.200]  representative of the Eastern European civilization is just the latest phase in
[2:45:02.200 --> 2:45:06.000]  this European civil war that's been going on for centuries. Well I agree Richard we
[2:45:06.000 --> 2:45:08.080]  don't have a lot of time with you so I want to pick your brain on some quick
[2:45:08.080 --> 2:45:15.200]  questions okay how did this go for the NATO slash neocon Israeli US backed
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:19.760]  operation in Georgia did they get what they wanted as a political diversion to
[2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:24.080]  start these brush wars to try to buoy the dollar saying America's still tough
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:29.200]  look we're invading countries or did it go badly for them did they miscalculate
[2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:33.480]  where do you see this going in the future I think they miscalculated because
[2:45:33.480 --> 2:45:40.360]  Russia crushed them I think Russia made a fool and a laughing stock out of the
[2:45:40.360 --> 2:45:44.760]  Georgian government and the American and Israeli backers I think they probably
[2:45:44.760 --> 2:45:49.920]  wanted this to be you know the the fall surprise that would divert attention from
[2:45:49.920 --> 2:45:54.840]  the US presidential election it failed completely Russia was completely
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:46:00.560]  prepared and the Russian army on the ground has been known for decades to be
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:08.960]  the most efficient powerful ground force on the planet these guys are not the
[2:46:08.960 --> 2:46:14.960]  Iraqi forces who who just cut and run I don't insult anybody but but the Russian
[2:46:14.960 --> 2:46:19.520]  military is very well trained they're very tough they're very well equipped and
[2:46:19.520 --> 2:46:25.160]  I think they made fools out of the Georgian military and the American
[2:46:25.160 --> 2:46:31.360]  Israeli backers and now their top generals go on TV and read the NATO doctrine
[2:46:31.360 --> 2:46:35.800]  that they've changed the last two years publicly it really changed it in 2000
[2:46:35.800 --> 2:46:40.680]  where they say we will and I'm quoting we will launch preemptive nuclear attacks
[2:46:40.680 --> 2:46:44.360]  on Russia or other states and we meant and we mean by releasing this to
[2:46:44.360 --> 2:46:48.200]  provocate or have a provocation with Russia and we're going to move missile
[2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:55.560]  defense in so we sneak attack them they can't respond back throwing out mad which
[2:46:55.560 --> 2:46:59.240]  is all which has held us in good stead mutually assured destruction so so that
[2:46:59.240 --> 2:47:03.440]  there's a balance of power this throws the balance and now rush is saying okay
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:06.200]  we may go ahead and nuke those sites because we can't go up against your
[2:47:06.200 --> 2:47:10.520]  precision guided munitions I'm quoting we may go ahead in nuke areas of Poland
[2:47:10.520 --> 2:47:15.360]  and and Ukraine and Russians have never in their history shot their mouth off and
[2:47:15.360 --> 2:47:18.360]  and and not really been considering something this is incredible brink's
[2:47:18.360 --> 2:47:23.760] manship no the Russians mean what they say and they have throughout their
[2:47:23.760 --> 2:47:30.000]  history they're very serious people in this game and they're not bluffing and
[2:47:30.000 --> 2:47:34.600]  they've put Poland on notice that if you arm yourselves through missile defense
[2:47:34.600 --> 2:47:42.560]  systems and allow the u.s. to come in and stake out territory for operations
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:47.000]  against Russia you are going to have the nuke same to you and and I think Poland
[2:47:47.000 --> 2:47:53.240]  realizes this this is very very serious this is not simply the kind of bluster
[2:47:53.240 --> 2:48:00.280]  that we've seen during the Cold War this is another level of escalation why
[2:48:00.280 --> 2:48:04.200]  have the neocons and their globalist controllers we know they're just one
[2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:09.960]  little instrument they use as a front within a front what do you expect the
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:14.760]  new world order the Anglo-American arm to do now well I believe that they're
[2:48:14.760 --> 2:48:20.400]  doing this because the United States economy is collapsing it's a race against
[2:48:20.400 --> 2:48:29.720]  time between creating some kind of a massive diversion trial tribal a tribal
[2:48:29.720 --> 2:48:34.880]  rallying point yeah but it's it's even it's not even a rallying point because
[2:48:34.880 --> 2:48:39.920]  the American government the American people are broke or bankrupt they can
[2:48:39.920 --> 2:48:46.640]  not continue even to fund the government because at a certain point the
[2:48:46.640 --> 2:48:51.000]  foreigners who are buying the Treasury debt to keep this thing afloat are going
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:55.040]  to stop doing it it just cannot go it looks like to me it's almost like
[2:48:55.040 --> 2:48:58.960]  somebody saying I have a bomb I'll blow this meeting up if you don't do what I
[2:48:58.960 --> 2:49:02.400]  say it seems like they're holding everybody hostage showing everyone just
[2:49:02.400 --> 2:49:07.120]  how crazy they are well they are but there's nothing that they can get out of
[2:49:07.120 --> 2:49:12.200]  it other than a war there there's nothing that Russia or China or anybody
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:17.760]  can do for the US to bail us out any further from our own collapsing
[2:49:17.760 --> 2:49:21.800]  economy in fact they've been trying to go into this corner well and that's where
[2:49:21.800 --> 2:49:25.920]  it gets confusing they've been trying to prop the dollar up for a decade and then
[2:49:25.920 --> 2:49:30.360]  meanwhile the White House makes every move to devalue it and then suddenly
[2:49:30.360 --> 2:49:34.960]  jumps in trying to restore it and I know there's a method to the madness here
[2:49:34.960 --> 2:49:38.560]  but does it seem helter skelter and almost like they will like they're
[2:49:38.560 --> 2:49:44.320]  crazy well they're trying to keep the dollar up at least true this election
[2:49:44.320 --> 2:49:48.720]  and they've done that by no longer slashing the interest rates and still
[2:49:48.720 --> 2:49:53.440]  providing some kind of an environment where foreign investors can come in so
[2:49:53.440 --> 2:49:59.000]  they want a slow slide not a total implosion I'm sorry they want a slow
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:03.880]  slide not a total implosion at least through the election now nobody knows
[2:50:03.880 --> 2:50:07.400]  what they're going to do after the election and after the inauguration if
[2:50:07.400 --> 2:50:13.440]  say for example McCain is put into place if Obama's elected he will try to do
[2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:18.400]  another new deal McCain does not seem to be heading in that direction McCain
[2:50:18.400 --> 2:50:23.240]  seems to be all out for the for the World War three option stay there we're
[2:50:23.240 --> 2:50:26.080]  going to skip this break with Richard Seacook if you're on the internet you
[2:50:26.080 --> 2:50:31.400]  can listen at info wars.com stay with us okay Richard I'm interrupting here
[2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:34.920]  because I have a lot of questions what is most important in all of this and
[2:50:34.920 --> 2:50:43.120]  what can we do to try to turn this around what can we do yes sir well the
[2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:50.400]  only rational thing that we can do is to go back to the very beginning and to
[2:50:50.400 --> 2:50:56.000]  start over again with rebuilding our productive economy our productive
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:51:03.200]  economy was destroyed as a result of the international banker's decision to
[2:51:03.200 --> 2:51:07.840]  eliminate the United States as a producer nation that came out starting
[2:51:07.840 --> 2:51:13.240]  with 79 Paul Volcker recession and has continued ever since and you know you
[2:51:13.240 --> 2:51:17.960]  go to the you look at the Bilderberger meetings that you've tracked Alex and
[2:51:17.960 --> 2:51:21.880]  this is one of their major agenda items and then we're forced to be a military
[2:51:21.880 --> 2:51:26.120]  economy as Brzezinski said that take everything we've got and then we'll have
[2:51:26.120 --> 2:51:29.920]  to be Hessian slaves by way of the economy it's the only way we'll be
[2:51:29.920 --> 2:51:34.560]  able to live so domestically prisons checkpoints control surveillance and
[2:51:34.560 --> 2:51:40.280]  armored empire and then we supply mercenaries to the corporate board well
[2:51:40.280 --> 2:51:46.080]  that's the way it is I mean that's what it's become the only way to stop that is
[2:51:46.080 --> 2:51:50.720]  for and I've said this in writing is for the federal government immediately to
[2:51:50.720 --> 2:51:56.960]  take over the federal reserve system to nationalize the credit system and to use
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:02.720]  the credit of the United States not to fight foreign wars but to rebuild our
[2:52:02.720 --> 2:52:08.520]  domestic economy and that means putting a lot of the debt that is floating
[2:52:08.520 --> 2:52:13.120]  around in the economy that is contributing to inflation for example to
[2:52:13.120 --> 2:52:18.000]  put that on hold to put that into bankruptcy reorganization and to take
[2:52:18.000 --> 2:52:21.520]  over the economy and to rebuild it from the bottom up that's what has to be done
[2:52:21.520 --> 2:52:24.720]  right now and people say well we don't want the government involved in the
[2:52:24.720 --> 2:52:27.920]  economy but because it's always corrupt the problem is the corporations have
[2:52:27.920 --> 2:52:31.120]  already used the government to take control of the economy and then to
[2:52:31.120 --> 2:52:37.360]  literally cut it up into scrap and move it overseas well the economy is run now
[2:52:37.360 --> 2:52:41.680]  by the international banking community you're saying the people need to take
[2:52:41.680 --> 2:52:45.120]  control the government and take control that way because the Constitution of the
[2:52:45.120 --> 2:52:50.240]  United States starts with the words we the people it should be an instrument
[2:52:50.240 --> 2:52:54.880]  the people of the United States to control their own economic destiny now
[2:52:54.880 --> 2:52:59.680]  if it's done properly it will be a mixed economy consisting largely of
[2:52:59.680 --> 2:53:05.640]  private enterprise but the key to it is control of the monetary system as the
[2:53:05.640 --> 2:53:10.200]  Constitution prescribes understand turn that credit loose instead of the select
[2:53:10.200 --> 2:53:15.400]  corporations to leverage it and then move everything offshore tailor it again
[2:53:15.400 --> 2:53:20.560]  to where it actually builds the nation up exactly credit has been privatized and
[2:53:20.560 --> 2:53:24.680]  it really began in earnest with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 and why
[2:53:24.680 --> 2:53:28.040]  would these big banking cartels not take advantage and destroy all their
[2:53:28.040 --> 2:53:31.000]  competition and try to set up a monopoly we're coming back to the full
[2:53:31.000 --> 2:53:33.640]  audience here we go
[2:53:33.640 --> 2:53:41.240]  Richard C. Cook is our guest Richard C. Cook dot com just Richard to see and
[2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:46.200]  cook dot com links up on info wars dot com don't forget fabled enemies Jason
[2:53:46.200 --> 2:53:51.280]  Bermas's new film that I produced which is a bombshell 9-11 film covering a lot
[2:53:51.280 --> 2:53:55.160]  of areas we haven't gotten into yet you can pre-order that now at info wars
[2:53:55.160 --> 2:53:59.440]  dot com it ships out September 1st you'll be able to watch it at prison
[2:53:59.440 --> 2:54:07.200]  planet dot tv September 1st as well the globalists have stripped mind the
[2:54:07.200 --> 2:54:11.520]  country moved everything offshore to create monopolies now their only empire
[2:54:11.520 --> 2:54:15.640]  is endangered of collapsing because they've been so predatory how do you
[2:54:15.640 --> 2:54:20.560]  think they're planning to salvage this by having a global reorganization where
[2:54:20.560 --> 2:54:26.040]  they pose as the saviors through a new corporate world government well I think
[2:54:26.040 --> 2:54:31.720]  that that's that's part of it you know you've got the concept for instance of
[2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:37.320]  the North American Union or the North American free trading organization
[2:54:37.320 --> 2:54:42.160]  that has been talked about to restructure the North American economy
[2:54:42.160 --> 2:54:46.640]  and that's a new bubble that's all that is yeah and and that's but but the
[2:54:46.640 --> 2:54:52.080]  problem is that they have this multi-trillion dollar debt overhang that
[2:54:52.080 --> 2:54:56.960]  nobody knows what to do with it that debt will never be repaid and that's why I
[2:54:56.960 --> 2:55:02.600]  feel that we're heading toward a will a major war because they always use war
[2:55:02.600 --> 2:55:08.240]  as a means of either rolling over debt or inflating currency to the point where
[2:55:08.240 --> 2:55:13.680]  it destroys the old public debt which happened after world war one or they
[2:55:13.680 --> 2:55:18.360]  simply take over and conquer other countries that you owe money to and
[2:55:18.360 --> 2:55:22.200]  cancel the debt that way they painted themselves into a corner alex there's
[2:55:22.200 --> 2:55:27.960]  no way out of it but control freaks in the case of every other empire we can
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:31.960]  study the current psychology by other elite psychology humans by the same
[2:55:31.960 --> 2:55:36.240]  way normally just start throwing fits and attacking in all directions and then
[2:55:36.240 --> 2:55:41.200]  things that only hastens their demise well they tend to at a certain point to
[2:55:41.200 --> 2:55:49.440]  decide to set everything in stone so that no surprises can take places what
[2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:53.600]  happened with the roman empire it's what happened with the british empire but
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:58.320]  the british empire went bankrupt and the reason the united states is in control
[2:55:58.320 --> 2:56:03.760]  now was because they took over the bankruptcy of the british empire and
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:07.240]  they did it through world war two that's what happened after the great
[2:56:07.240 --> 2:56:11.520]  depression what lifted us out of the great depression was world war two it
[2:56:11.520 --> 2:56:17.360]  was massive arms spending and it was enormous tax rates that were levied on
[2:56:17.360 --> 2:56:22.440]  the entire economy and so what you had in essence was for four or five years in
[2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:26.760]  the united states but you know our own version of communism or socialism or
[2:56:26.760 --> 2:56:32.400]  whatever managing and running world war two and after world war two we were the
[2:56:32.400 --> 2:56:36.760]  top dog in the world economy but they handed those mechanisms over to the
[2:56:36.760 --> 2:56:41.440]  internationalist instead of keeping that engine going and now we've been
[2:56:41.440 --> 2:56:46.280]  basically had our bones picked the internationalist took them away they
[2:56:46.280 --> 2:56:50.200]  were taken away that's why they got rid of nixon because nixon opposed the
[2:56:50.200 --> 2:56:54.600]  general agreement on tariffs and trade which was the internationalization that
[2:56:54.600 --> 2:56:58.120]  preceded the world trade or not that he was even a nice guy but he wanted the
[2:56:58.120 --> 2:57:01.920]  empire for america that's right he thought why should long american economy
[2:57:01.920 --> 2:57:07.360]  and kissinger took it away but they got him uh... uh... railroaded out and from
[2:57:07.360 --> 2:57:12.520]  that point on every american president uh... but uh... the big one was reagan
[2:57:12.520 --> 2:57:18.360]  you know reagan or presided during the avocar a crash of the economy and seventy
[2:57:18.360 --> 2:57:23.520]  nine eighty three and turn the economy over to the bankers and the
[2:57:23.520 --> 2:57:28.240]  international elite who you know run the builder group and the council on
[2:57:28.240 --> 2:57:31.960]  foreign relations and all of that and now the bankers are all buying offshore
[2:57:31.960 --> 2:57:35.320]  private islands with private security details right because i know a lot of
[2:57:35.320 --> 2:57:38.240]  them live here in austin i know they're lawyers and i mean billionaires
[2:57:38.240 --> 2:57:40.920]  they've been pulling we're just going to let it crash
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:43.440]  yeah that's it no they're saying we're we're crashing everything and then we'll
[2:57:43.440 --> 2:57:46.720]  come back and buy it all up for pennies on the dollar that's right we're going to
[2:57:46.720 --> 2:57:50.640]  leave you with the lobotomized idiot cops meeting you with clubs have fun
[2:57:50.640 --> 2:57:52.560]  bye bye

[3:00:04.600 --> 3:00:05.840]  tuesday
[3:00:05.840 --> 3:00:09.760]  i think i was actually listening to your show i was outside at work downtown in
[3:00:09.760 --> 3:00:11.080]  Cincinnati
[3:00:11.080 --> 3:00:13.200]  seven-figure i'm looking at the ripper
[3:00:13.200 --> 3:00:16.600]  and then i see this u-s black military helicopter
[3:00:16.600 --> 3:00:18.400]  you know just going up
[3:00:18.400 --> 3:00:19.560]  and down
[3:00:19.560 --> 3:00:20.920]  and on the river
[3:00:20.920 --> 3:00:22.160]  and like you know
[3:00:22.160 --> 3:00:25.840]  kept looking at it and you know i was like no no it's got a really it's got a
[3:00:25.840 --> 3:00:28.240]  radiation detector in an or
[3:00:28.240 --> 3:00:31.600]  was over houses it's got an infrared looking for marijuana grow lights
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:34.120]  and that makes the troops think there's really a nuclear threat and they're
[3:00:34.120 --> 3:00:35.880]  really protecting america and there's
[3:00:35.880 --> 3:00:38.840]  there's all this real security stuff going on
[3:00:38.840 --> 3:00:41.960]  as part of the illusion so when the globalist set a new cough they can
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:44.560]  grandstand as the saviors in the troops and police would have been we were
[3:00:44.560 --> 3:00:46.840]  looking for news
[3:00:46.840 --> 3:00:50.000]  yeah you know like i uh... i start calling you know
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:54.080]  uh... couple of police districts like i called one in downtown district one of
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:00:56.780]  course they didn't know anything
[3:00:56.780 --> 3:01:00.320]  uh... they sent me over across the river in kentucky of course they didn't know
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:02.260]  anything
[3:01:02.260 --> 3:01:05.100]  and i called the chair of the part of it and that he
[3:01:05.100 --> 3:01:08.360]  and pretty much left the message i guess with uh... higher up
[3:01:08.360 --> 3:01:12.240]  and he called me back like a half-hour later lieutenant
[3:01:12.240 --> 3:01:15.320]  and uh... i was like thirty realized that there's a black u-s military
[3:01:15.320 --> 3:01:17.760]  helicopter going up and down river

[3:01:34.600 --> 3:01:38.080]  the movie it's okay well i don't know that they had blackhawks
[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:40.440]  but if they're giving but look they're federalizing everything in these

[3:09:17.320 --> 3:09:19.640]  managed to stay ahead of them
[3:09:19.640 --> 3:09:23.640]  some u.s. investigators believe that their israelis again very much engaged
[3:09:23.640 --> 3:09:26.280]  in spying in and on the u.s.
[3:09:26.280 --> 3:09:29.000]  whether it's because they're in intelligence services are what they
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:29.960]  were doing
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:33.320]  i will defer to the department of justice in the fb i
[3:09:33.320 --> 3:09:36.720]  there was a report on the george washington bridge that there had been a

[3:10:12.600 --> 3:10:15.560]  one big elephant in the living room
[3:10:15.560 --> 3:10:19.000]  is the relationship between the united states of america and the state of
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:20.760]  israel

[3:11:17.880 --> 3:11:19.400]  your time
[3:11:19.400 --> 3:11:23.400]  but let's say i'm the president i'm asking you uh... or or you were advising a
[3:11:23.400 --> 3:11:27.680]  foreign president what has happened in russia what is the larger geopolitical
[3:11:27.680 --> 3:11:29.960]  reasons for this what is behind it
[3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:33.880]  why is nato the u s in israel launch the sneak attack on russia
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:36.840]  what is russia going to do you study them for decades
[3:11:36.840 --> 3:11:39.200]  uh... what does this mean the larger picture
[3:11:39.200 --> 3:11:42.920]  in context with the election i ran
[3:11:42.920 --> 3:11:45.280]  well mister president
[3:11:45.280 --> 3:11:47.440]  it's uh...
[3:11:47.440 --> 3:11:51.360]  fairly simple to explain this uh... once you tweak
[3:11:51.360 --> 3:11:53.680]  the nose of the russian bear
[3:11:53.680 --> 3:11:59.240]  in a place where you're vulnerable the russian bear is going to strike back
[3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:02.120]  the georgians uh... took it into their head
[3:12:02.120 --> 3:12:06.920]  uh... to mount a full-scale attack on the session of the session
[3:12:06.920 --> 3:12:10.680]  and uh... how even the u.s. special envoy
[3:12:10.680 --> 3:12:12.800]  i called it and i quote
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:15.480]  uh... deplorable horrible
[3:12:15.480 --> 3:12:19.960]  uh... here's a quote from this fellow matthew brisa who's a deputy associate
[3:12:19.960 --> 3:12:23.160]  the deputy assistant secretary of state
[3:12:23.160 --> 3:12:29.400]  up to fire on civilians as the georgians did on the evening of the august
[3:12:29.400 --> 3:12:31.040]  is simply deplorable
[3:12:31.040 --> 3:12:32.600]  uh... it's illegal
[3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:33.760]  and uh...
[3:12:33.760 --> 3:12:37.400]  and horrible says matthew brisa's u.s. special
[3:12:37.400 --> 3:12:39.080]  uh... envoy to the region
[3:12:39.080 --> 3:12:41.880]  that's what started it now what the georgians
[3:12:41.880 --> 3:12:45.040]  had in mind is really bizarre i think that they would
[3:12:45.040 --> 3:12:48.800]  as divorced from reality as some folks in the white house
[3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:52.480]  if they thought that the united states of america
[3:12:52.480 --> 3:12:57.680]  which already has all its deployable troops deployed into god forsaken
[3:12:57.680 --> 3:12:58.840]  wars
[3:12:58.840 --> 3:13:02.760]  you rock in afghanistan if they thought the u.s. would come to their aid
[3:13:02.760 --> 3:13:06.320]  or worse still if they thought the russians would sit back there behind their
[3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:07.080]  border
[3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:09.440]  and take this without reacting
[3:13:09.440 --> 3:13:13.120]  you know the world he needs to have his head examined because that could never
[3:13:13.120 --> 3:13:14.800]  be the case
[3:13:14.800 --> 3:13:17.000]  the russians are uh...
[3:13:17.000 --> 3:13:19.680]  are on the march in this sense
[3:13:19.680 --> 3:13:22.720]  uh... they're tired of being humiliated
[3:13:22.720 --> 3:13:25.160]  uh... they're tired of of being uh...
[3:13:25.160 --> 3:13:26.600]  with salt
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:33.000]  uh... we have nato moving ever closer to the traditional borders uh... russia
[3:13:33.000 --> 3:13:34.600]  uh... we have uh...
[3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:35.760]  a missile
[3:13:35.760 --> 3:13:39.240]  uh... installment in poland and they uh...
[3:13:39.240 --> 3:13:42.280]  every door installment in the check republic
[3:13:42.280 --> 3:13:45.480]  uh... now those are really going to be really handy
[3:13:45.480 --> 3:13:47.440]  for protecting europe
[3:13:47.440 --> 3:13:48.360]  against
[3:13:48.360 --> 3:13:51.040]  and i cb m attack from
[3:13:51.040 --> 3:13:53.240]  uh... from iran
[3:13:53.240 --> 3:13:54.840]  uh... but iran
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:13:59.000]  it doesn't have any i cb m's and can't have them for many many years
[3:13:59.000 --> 3:14:00.160]  matter fact
[3:14:00.160 --> 3:14:04.760]  u s intelligence community unanimously decided that iran is not working on
[3:14:04.760 --> 3:14:08.060]  on any nuclear weapons uh... at least as of
[3:14:08.060 --> 3:14:10.360]  mid two thousand three
[3:14:10.360 --> 3:14:15.240]  so you know for poutine and the rest of this of the of the russian leaders there
[3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:19.520]  to swallow all this stuff and not react when they can react i mean he can't do
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:21.800]  anything about poland of the check republic
[3:14:21.800 --> 3:14:26.020]  but they sure as he can do something about their soft underbelly
[3:14:26.020 --> 3:14:31.200]  and it's not only so we do you know the new russia to the old russia to the old
[3:14:31.200 --> 3:14:33.080]  russia going back
[3:14:33.080 --> 3:14:34.800]  four centuries now
[3:14:34.800 --> 3:14:35.800]  that uh...
[3:14:35.800 --> 3:14:38.600]  that has it is very paranoid
[3:14:38.600 --> 3:14:41.100]  attitude toward their southern frontier
[3:14:41.100 --> 3:14:42.040]  plexi
[3:14:42.040 --> 3:14:44.440]  and now of course within the last century
[3:14:44.440 --> 3:14:46.540]  that's what that's where the oil is
[3:14:46.540 --> 3:14:50.120]  and uh... they're very very sensitive to encroachments on that
[3:14:50.120 --> 3:14:53.240]  well analyzing uh...
[3:14:53.240 --> 3:14:54.840]  michael chakas valley
[3:14:54.840 --> 3:14:58.560]  this guy is on tv and live programs chewing his time
[3:14:58.560 --> 3:15:00.840]  looking like a complete nutcase
[3:15:00.840 --> 3:15:04.800]  when or when or when or when there's no threat he runs in fear
[3:15:04.800 --> 3:15:05.920]  panicking
[3:15:05.920 --> 3:15:08.560]  like no leader i've ever seen and i'm not saying i wouldn't run from an air raid
[3:15:08.560 --> 3:15:10.600]  but there is he just
[3:15:10.600 --> 3:15:13.880]  uh... according to all the reports he really is out of his mind
[3:15:13.880 --> 3:15:17.960]  and uh... meanwhile you've got all these israelis there uh... israel post at a
[3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:19.680]  thousand israeli advisers
[3:15:19.680 --> 3:15:23.160]  uh... you've got you a special forces doing drills there two weeks before
[3:15:23.160 --> 3:15:24.760]  u.s. weapons
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:29.280]  uh... i mean what were they thinking to gain from this
[3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:31.240]  well again uh... you
[3:15:31.240 --> 3:15:35.760]  as far as she uh... soccer partially uses concerned you know he
[3:15:35.760 --> 3:15:39.680]  he's sort of like the child of the of uh... georgia
[3:15:39.680 --> 3:15:45.320]  uh... well-spoken uh... pretty good uh... in good with the neocons and several
[3:15:45.320 --> 3:15:47.040]  of the people on the hill
[3:15:47.040 --> 3:15:51.160]  and uh... you know they sort of gave him the impression some of them at least
[3:15:51.160 --> 3:15:53.280]  and maybe as high as cheney
[3:15:53.280 --> 3:15:57.040]  but yeah we're going to have a quick tweak this russian bear and and we're
[3:15:57.040 --> 3:16:01.760]  going to defend uh... what uh... what you consider to be your your strategic
[3:16:01.760 --> 3:16:03.040]  objectives and
[3:16:03.040 --> 3:16:06.800]  and so you know i can only i can only reason
[3:16:06.800 --> 3:16:10.800]  that uh... talk about she really is thought that he could uh... actually
[3:16:10.800 --> 3:16:11.920]  good man
[3:16:11.920 --> 3:16:14.680]  and uh... and the russian wouldn't respond
[3:16:14.680 --> 3:16:19.040]  now with his this is the here's the president out there in beijing
[3:16:19.040 --> 3:16:23.760]  uh... playing uh... you know speech volleyball with those company women
[3:16:23.760 --> 3:16:28.480]  and uh... and not really being in the picture cheney being in in charge back
[3:16:28.480 --> 3:16:29.440]  home
[3:16:29.440 --> 3:16:32.280]  and uh... issuing threatening statements
[3:16:32.280 --> 3:16:36.200]  thank goodness uh... a robert gates and made it clear that we're not going to
[3:16:36.200 --> 3:16:37.960]  react militarily
[3:16:37.960 --> 3:16:38.840]  uh... so
[3:16:38.840 --> 3:16:43.320]  the whole thing is uh... is an abject lesson an object lesson i thought
[3:16:43.320 --> 3:16:45.920]  that's the right word although abject also
[3:16:45.920 --> 3:16:46.800]  fit here
[3:16:46.800 --> 3:16:50.360]  of uh... how these people are not reality-based
[3:16:50.360 --> 3:16:52.800]  how they thought that they could do this stuff
[3:16:52.800 --> 3:16:57.600]  in a place where they can't defend a little little nation like georgia
[3:16:57.600 --> 3:17:01.640]  how how uh... the georgian leader thought that he could get away with this
[3:17:01.640 --> 3:17:02.960]  is beyond
[3:17:02.960 --> 3:17:06.120]  uh... beyond my comprehension but he did it
[3:17:06.120 --> 3:17:07.520]  the russians reacted
[3:17:07.520 --> 3:17:11.640]  and now they've given a little lesson
[3:17:11.640 --> 3:17:13.240]  places like that
[3:17:13.240 --> 3:17:18.080]  that really violated and standing sir reached back in the early nineties where
[3:17:18.080 --> 3:17:22.200]  these uh... you know uh... sechia and uh... out here
[3:17:22.200 --> 3:17:24.480]  would enjoy a measure of autonomy
[3:17:24.480 --> 3:17:26.840]  and that there would be russian people in there
[3:17:26.840 --> 3:17:30.400]  uh... they feel closer to russia than they did to the to the georgians and so
[3:17:30.400 --> 3:17:34.560]  well we know those two areas were given by stall into georgia because he was a
[3:17:34.560 --> 3:17:38.000]  georgian and they're ninety plus percent with ninety two percent one ninety
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:39.080]  percent another
[3:17:39.080 --> 3:17:43.360]  uh... russian and and and the sneak attack where the georgian peacekeepers
[3:17:43.360 --> 3:17:46.840]  were knifing and shooting the russians in the
[3:17:46.840 --> 3:17:50.680]  uh... security zones uh... inside the peacekeeping bases
[3:17:50.680 --> 3:17:54.000]  i mean this is unprecedented treachery
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:55.720]  you know you know uh...
[3:17:55.720 --> 3:18:00.560]  one of the uh... real statesman at the end of the soviet era uh... covered
[3:18:00.560 --> 3:18:04.560]  not fit edward shivert not to who's the foreign minister
[3:18:04.560 --> 3:18:09.200]  he talked about uh... about this uh... this whole series of events and
[3:18:09.200 --> 3:18:10.600]  it was careful not to be
[3:18:10.600 --> 3:18:13.200]  too terribly critical of the uh...
[3:18:13.200 --> 3:18:16.280]  uh... of the what russians have done
[3:18:16.280 --> 3:18:20.040]  but he did point out that there's a way of handling these kinds of things it has
[3:18:20.040 --> 3:18:21.680]  to do
[3:18:21.680 --> 3:18:23.200]  long-term
[3:18:23.200 --> 3:18:26.440]  uh... cultivation of ties and
[3:18:26.440 --> 3:18:29.200]  while he was uh... president of georgia
[3:18:29.200 --> 3:18:32.560]  he reached out he went to a house here he went to a city
[3:18:32.560 --> 3:18:36.800]  and he met with the people and there was a gradual rapporteur won't happening
[3:18:36.800 --> 3:18:40.840]  that's not the way uh... our clients uh... do things uh... you know we do
[3:18:40.840 --> 3:18:42.500]  shotgun or and we
[3:18:42.500 --> 3:18:46.380]  we read cities and kill a lot of civilians in the middle of the night
[3:18:46.380 --> 3:18:49.780]  that is deplorable that is beyond the pale and that's what
[3:18:49.780 --> 3:18:54.440]  but uh... really do you see that rena govern as as as another window in the
[3:18:54.440 --> 3:18:57.480]  neocon mindset that they would obviously green light this
[3:18:57.480 --> 3:19:00.000]  that that that they're so delusional
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:03.080]  that they just think they're going to see victory everywhere
[3:19:03.080 --> 3:19:06.040]  well uh... you know i think uh... the
[3:19:06.040 --> 3:19:10.560]  georgian president also may have taken a little farther than he was really
[3:19:10.560 --> 3:19:12.400]  uh... supposed to but yeah
[3:19:12.400 --> 3:19:16.720]  this kind of uh... hubris is what uh... leads to the downfall of lots of people
[3:19:16.720 --> 3:19:18.000]  besides
[3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:19.560]  ancient greek heroes
[3:19:19.560 --> 3:19:23.160]  okay rena govern we're gonna skip this break for info wars dot com listen for
[3:19:23.160 --> 3:19:24.680]  body else we back in about
[3:19:24.680 --> 3:19:30.160]  three minutes rena governs our guests a with us
[3:19:30.160 --> 3:19:33.320]  okay ray i want to continue i don't want to waste any time here
[3:19:33.320 --> 3:19:37.560]  uh... is all i want to get into the iran iraq situation the big picture there
[3:19:37.560 --> 3:19:39.720]  and where you see this going in the election
[3:19:39.720 --> 3:19:41.720]  any any developments the last two weeks
[3:19:41.720 --> 3:19:43.080]  since you were last with us
[3:19:43.080 --> 3:19:45.880]  but but finishing up with russian situation
[3:19:45.880 --> 3:19:50.200]  uh... it looks like the neocons are are are escalating things down and and
[3:19:50.200 --> 3:19:52.240]  moving in more forces more weapons
[3:19:52.240 --> 3:19:54.200]  taking over former soviet uh...
[3:19:54.200 --> 3:19:57.080]  satellite bases in ukraine angering the russians
[3:19:57.080 --> 3:19:58.880]  escalating and even more
[3:19:58.880 --> 3:20:02.640]  and so i want to get your take on overall how that's going to play out and
[3:20:02.640 --> 3:20:03.320]  then
[3:20:03.320 --> 3:20:06.280]  when we come back up to the full audience about three minutes
[3:20:06.280 --> 3:20:09.920]  i want to uh... john get that clip ready with mccain saying and we also want
[3:20:09.920 --> 3:20:10.560]  to bush
[3:20:10.560 --> 3:20:13.320]  signal twenty first century nations don't invade
[3:20:13.320 --> 3:20:14.640]  other nations
[3:20:14.640 --> 3:20:17.440]  uh... uh... the the hypocrisy
[3:20:17.440 --> 3:20:23.880]  uh... but but but but first you know the big picture with things escalating
[3:20:23.880 --> 3:20:27.360]  right
[3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:30.480]  i don't think that the governor knows that we went to break right where we're
[3:20:30.480 --> 3:20:33.760]  still in the air right now ready to go there yeah i haven't seen the reports on
[3:20:33.760 --> 3:20:36.120]  u.s. troops going to the ukraine
[3:20:36.120 --> 3:20:38.920]  uh... well i had a better training them as advisors and yes they're
[3:20:38.920 --> 3:20:42.240]  increasing the amount and they're flying in you know more troops that help in
[3:20:42.240 --> 3:20:43.320]  georgia
[3:20:43.320 --> 3:20:44.000]  yeah
[3:20:44.000 --> 3:20:48.080]  well i i think that the koreans will have learned this lesson pretty well
[3:20:48.080 --> 3:20:51.440]  also with respect to nature of course they have already
[3:20:51.440 --> 3:20:56.760]  uh... postponed any talk of uh... accession to nato by you but ukraine and
[3:20:56.760 --> 3:20:58.040]  by georgia
[3:20:58.040 --> 3:21:01.240]  so they'll be a period of several months now where people can kind of
[3:21:01.240 --> 3:21:04.360]  hunker down and weigh the implications of what just happened
[3:21:04.360 --> 3:21:06.400]  and realize that uh... you know
[3:21:06.400 --> 3:21:11.760]  uh... what we want uh... uh... mexico to be invited to join the war so apache
[3:21:11.760 --> 3:21:12.940]  uh...
[3:21:12.940 --> 3:21:16.240]  the now defunct war so apache i don't think so you know
[3:21:16.240 --> 3:21:17.120]  and and what
[3:21:17.120 --> 3:21:18.840]  what americans need to do
[3:21:18.840 --> 3:21:21.400]  is put themselves in the position of russian
[3:21:21.400 --> 3:21:23.560]  and uh... as the russians look out
[3:21:23.560 --> 3:21:27.240]  on what the u.s. has done over the last eight years
[3:21:27.240 --> 3:21:31.000]  you know canceling treaties uh... putting new missile systems in western
[3:21:31.000 --> 3:21:32.120]  europe
[3:21:32.120 --> 3:21:37.280]  invading other countries uh... you know if i were at vladimir putin
[3:21:37.280 --> 3:21:40.280]  i would think twice about uh... uh...
[3:21:40.280 --> 3:21:41.920]  not giving them a lesson
[3:21:41.920 --> 3:21:44.520]  when uh... he can so easily do so
[3:21:44.520 --> 3:21:48.000]  uh... the georgians with thoroughly penetrated by russian intelligence they
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:51.600]  know exactly what was happening that's why we're ready to respond
[3:21:51.600 --> 3:21:55.480]  and for the georgians to think they could get away with this you know it's uh...
[3:21:55.480 --> 3:21:57.880]  uh... it was really started and uh...
[3:21:57.880 --> 3:22:00.760]  uh... by the georgians and they they're going to have to pay a price what about
[3:22:00.760 --> 3:22:03.760]  israel what do they think they're going to get part of the oil and gas why are
[3:22:03.760 --> 3:22:04.840]  they there
[3:22:04.840 --> 3:22:08.320]  well uh... the oil line there that they run through georgia is very
[3:22:08.320 --> 3:22:10.320]  important uh... to israel
[3:22:10.320 --> 3:22:12.360]  uh... but also you know that
[3:22:12.360 --> 3:22:17.160]  it's about the military industrial complex in this country
[3:22:17.160 --> 3:22:20.800]  you know that there's a great big one in israel as well and they have been to
[3:22:20.800 --> 3:22:24.200]  making make a buck by sending all kinds of uh...
[3:22:24.200 --> 3:22:27.280]  uh... armaments selling them to the georgians
[3:22:27.280 --> 3:22:31.520]  and of course that to the degree they can get a foot in in in georgia it's
[3:22:31.520 --> 3:22:34.520]  similar to the foot they used to have in turkey
[3:22:34.520 --> 3:22:36.360]  or more even
[3:22:36.360 --> 3:22:39.040]  even earlier in iran of all places
[3:22:39.040 --> 3:22:43.160]  uh... then they have they have more of a security uh...
[3:22:43.160 --> 3:22:44.520]  comfort uh...
[3:22:44.520 --> 3:22:47.200]  having so you're saying another huge
[3:22:47.200 --> 3:22:49.120]  international blunder
[3:22:49.120 --> 3:22:52.840]  uh... for the neocons washington nato just another
[3:22:52.840 --> 3:22:57.080]  stinging pathetic fall on their face to feet
[3:22:57.080 --> 3:23:00.520]  you know and could be worse alex uh...
[3:23:00.520 --> 3:23:05.240]  you have to take five steps back and always ask yourself how the israeli
[3:23:05.240 --> 3:23:08.920]  leaders will look at this
[3:23:08.920 --> 3:23:12.960]  there's some really bad things happening as far as the israeli to concern
[3:23:12.960 --> 3:23:14.280]  number one
[3:23:14.280 --> 3:23:17.960]  we're going to be out of iraq okay now it may take a year may take two years
[3:23:17.960 --> 3:23:20.960]  play what recap that we come back to the full audience we're about a tenth of
[3:23:20.960 --> 3:23:21.780]  our audience
[3:23:21.780 --> 3:23:23.360]  when i skip breaks for a government
[3:23:23.360 --> 3:23:25.640]  stay there let's come back and talk about that
[3:23:25.640 --> 3:23:32.640]  uh... right now here we go ladies and gentlemen
[3:23:32.640 --> 3:23:36.480]  mcgovern uh... the israeli's heavily involved
[3:23:36.480 --> 3:23:41.320]  the whole string about half the major ministers are not even georgians
[3:23:41.320 --> 3:23:43.360]  so i think the georgians would resent
[3:23:43.360 --> 3:23:47.880]  the really strong contingent uh... israeli's than nato the u.s. and
[3:23:47.880 --> 3:23:50.240]  uh... some ukrainian tank drivers
[3:23:50.240 --> 3:23:55.120]  uh... so israel's there uh... uh... well how will the israeli elite look at this
[3:23:55.120 --> 3:23:57.720]  or how will this affect their thinking
[3:23:57.720 --> 3:24:03.200]  uh... minutes is good or bad uh... in the perspective of israel
[3:24:03.200 --> 3:24:05.400]  as usual it's good and bad
[3:24:05.400 --> 3:24:07.200]  in other words it's
[3:24:07.200 --> 3:24:10.840]  it's really bad for the u.s. take a year uh...
[3:24:10.840 --> 3:24:13.760]  uh... punch in the nose of this magnitude
[3:24:13.760 --> 3:24:16.760]  uh... it's the equivalent of what uh...
[3:24:16.760 --> 3:24:21.480]  the rocky uh... prime minister did uh... a month and a half ago when he said
[3:24:21.480 --> 3:24:25.000]  the old troops out of here i'm not finding any agreement till you agree to
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:25.440]  a
[3:24:25.440 --> 3:24:28.440]  a teacher or all u.s. troops to be out of there
[3:24:28.440 --> 3:24:30.720]  now if i'm an israeli leader
[3:24:30.720 --> 3:24:32.520]  and i i i know
[3:24:32.520 --> 3:24:35.640]  that part of the reason that u.s. troops are any rock
[3:24:35.640 --> 3:24:39.800]  is the misguided notion by the neocons that that would somehow
[3:24:39.800 --> 3:24:41.600]  give israel more security
[3:24:41.600 --> 3:24:45.160]  i mean you know it can laugh at that now i mean that there were no terrorists in
[3:24:45.160 --> 3:24:48.920]  iraq before the invasion and now it's teaming with terrorist
[3:24:48.920 --> 3:24:52.280]  but anyhow if that was one of the reasons and now the u.s. troops are going to be
[3:24:52.280 --> 3:24:52.960]  gone
[3:24:52.960 --> 3:24:53.760]  well
[3:24:53.760 --> 3:24:58.200]  uh... that that part of the world is much more dangerous for the israeli now
[3:24:58.200 --> 3:24:59.560]  worse than that
[3:24:59.560 --> 3:25:00.920]  take a look at this defeat
[3:25:00.920 --> 3:25:03.680]  you know this obvious uh...
[3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:06.920]  punch in the nose you know if you're in in georgia
[3:25:06.920 --> 3:25:09.080]  how will the u.s. react to that
[3:25:09.080 --> 3:25:13.320]  uh... it's clear that uh... some israeli will say well you know you
[3:25:13.320 --> 3:25:16.480]  you can't depend on the u.s. to come to your aid
[3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:20.520]  kenya and others really would say forget it
[3:25:20.520 --> 3:25:22.560]  israel is not georgia
[3:25:22.560 --> 3:25:23.560]  israel has
[3:25:23.560 --> 3:25:25.320]  incredible political
[3:25:25.320 --> 3:25:27.440]  capital here in washington
[3:25:27.440 --> 3:25:30.680]  and now unless we waste any more time
[3:25:30.680 --> 3:25:33.120]  we need to uh... started
[3:25:33.120 --> 3:25:37.880]  start the kind of practice that will lead us and uh... the george bush to
[3:25:37.880 --> 3:25:39.720]  honor his promise to us
[3:25:39.720 --> 3:25:41.800]  uh... to take care of iran
[3:25:41.800 --> 3:25:43.440]  before he leaves office
[3:25:43.440 --> 3:25:45.440]  so i think on balance
[3:25:45.440 --> 3:25:50.200]  because of the increased danger of our departure from iraq after george bush
[3:25:50.200 --> 3:25:51.240]  leaves
[3:25:51.240 --> 3:25:52.600]  and the uh...
[3:25:52.600 --> 3:25:57.920]  and the situation where we have had a substantial reverse and might need
[3:25:57.920 --> 3:26:01.080]  something to kind of compensate for that
[3:26:01.080 --> 3:26:06.240]  and i would use the example of when we lost those two hundred forty two marines
[3:26:06.240 --> 3:26:08.420]  in lebanon do you remember that yes
[3:26:08.420 --> 3:26:11.240]  remember what we did right after that pulled out
[3:26:11.240 --> 3:26:14.040]  remember what we did what we went and invaded
[3:26:14.040 --> 3:26:15.400]  grenade
[3:26:15.400 --> 3:26:17.720]  grenade oh yes another diversion
[3:26:17.720 --> 3:26:21.240]  we conquered grenade okay and uh... we showed the
[3:26:21.240 --> 3:26:25.680]  the mice of the eighty-second airborne despite the losses in lebanon
[3:26:25.680 --> 3:26:29.440]  so there's going to be a big temptation on the part of the neocons and on the
[3:26:29.440 --> 3:26:33.480]  part of the israelis uh... you know the leak who makes this extreme i'm not
[3:26:33.480 --> 3:26:34.760]  talking about the israeli
[3:26:34.760 --> 3:26:38.360]  citizen the street i'm talking about the extremist right that's taken over the
[3:26:38.360 --> 3:26:39.800]  israeli government
[3:26:39.800 --> 3:26:43.720]  they'll be a great temptation for them because of the dangers in iraq
[3:26:43.720 --> 3:26:47.920]  and because of the opportunity to give the united states some sort of way to
[3:26:47.920 --> 3:26:52.240]  show well we're not just a paper tiger we can really do things
[3:26:52.240 --> 3:26:56.200]  uh... it's even more likely it seems to me that the israelis will decide to
[3:26:56.200 --> 3:26:58.560]  perpetrate the kind of propagation
[3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:00.520]  that will almost require
[3:27:00.520 --> 3:27:01.720]  iran
[3:27:01.720 --> 3:27:02.800]  to react
[3:27:02.800 --> 3:27:04.520]  and once they do
[3:27:04.520 --> 3:27:07.440]  u.s. will be in there with both feet because that
[3:27:07.440 --> 3:27:10.080]  u.s. president has promised the world
[3:27:10.080 --> 3:27:13.800]  that that's exactly what you do all the associated presses reporting today as
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:17.760]  well as other publications at the saudi delegation egyptian delegation
[3:27:17.760 --> 3:27:21.400]  uh... meeting with iranian delegation yesterday told them
[3:27:21.400 --> 3:27:25.160]  do not provocate do not give in the provocations
[3:27:25.160 --> 3:27:29.600]  back down talk sweet because they are really planning to attack you i'm sure
[3:27:29.600 --> 3:27:30.760]  you saw that
[3:27:30.760 --> 3:27:31.680]  uh...
[3:27:31.680 --> 3:27:34.440]  so overall what are things looking like right now
[3:27:34.440 --> 3:27:38.840]  uh... and is it still a green light to go in there before after the election
[3:27:38.840 --> 3:27:41.640]  there's no green light yet that i like uh...
[3:27:41.640 --> 3:27:45.720]  although as you know i think the green light will flash before too long
[3:27:45.720 --> 3:27:49.320]  well we have uh... you know the most important aspect of this is we have a
[3:27:49.320 --> 3:27:52.120]  real donny brook happening in the white house
[3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:53.400]  big conflict
[3:27:53.400 --> 3:27:54.640]  between
[3:27:54.640 --> 3:27:56.440]  vice president cheney
[3:27:56.440 --> 3:27:59.800]  uh... elliott abrams is running our policy from the national security
[3:27:59.800 --> 3:28:02.040]  council on the one hand
[3:28:02.040 --> 3:28:04.360]  and uh... rubber gates
[3:28:04.360 --> 3:28:06.280]  of the secretary of defense
[3:28:06.280 --> 3:28:10.000]  and mike mullen the chairman of joint chiefs staff on the other
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:12.200]  mullen and gates have made no secret
[3:28:12.200 --> 3:28:13.640]  of the fact they think
[3:28:13.640 --> 3:28:17.760]  that opening a third front what they mean of course is striking at iran would
[3:28:17.760 --> 3:28:20.480]  be a disaster would be a catastrophe
[3:28:20.480 --> 3:28:24.320]  it's not what mullen wants he said that about three times and they've told the
[3:28:24.320 --> 3:28:25.680]  israelis that
[3:28:25.680 --> 3:28:27.680]  now the question is
[3:28:27.680 --> 3:28:29.560]  and this is the real question
[3:28:29.560 --> 3:28:30.520]  when
[3:28:30.520 --> 3:28:35.120]  the defense minister from israel barack for example or when the head of their
[3:28:35.120 --> 3:28:39.000]  intelligence or other high officials come to washington
[3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:43.360]  usually they go to dick cheney's house of last
[3:28:43.360 --> 3:28:44.720]  and what they say is
[3:28:44.720 --> 3:28:48.600]  you know it's got mullen and gates you know those wimps uh...
[3:28:48.600 --> 3:28:51.840]  you know i think they want to they want not to do anything against this
[3:28:51.840 --> 3:28:54.680]  terrible threat from iran that what do you think
[3:28:54.680 --> 3:28:58.280]  and if they can't even think that well you know they are kind of uh...
[3:28:58.280 --> 3:29:00.480]  they are kind of soft on this threat
[3:29:00.480 --> 3:29:02.880]  and then the it is really going to take their
[3:29:02.880 --> 3:29:06.520]  you from cheney and not from gates or mullen
[3:29:06.520 --> 3:29:08.560]  and will be often running

[3:31:14.040 --> 3:31:17.440]  hangovers are what you got in college when you had about ten too many at the
[3:31:17.440 --> 3:31:20.840]  frat house and then rolled out of bed bright and early at the crack of noon
[3:31:20.840 --> 3:31:21.880]  the next day
[3:31:21.880 --> 3:31:22.840]  these days
[3:31:22.840 --> 3:31:26.000]  well sure sometimes you'll have a couple drinks with dinner and sometimes
[3:31:26.000 --> 3:31:29.240]  you'll wake up with a little headache feeling just a bit queasy
[3:31:29.240 --> 3:31:31.520]  but that's not really a hangover is it?
[3:31:31.520 --> 3:31:34.600]  well call it what you want but now you don't need to get one

[3:32:51.540 --> 3:32:54.760]  Ray before I take calls here in about ten minutes for you
[3:32:54.760 --> 3:32:58.400]  we're just so honored to have you with us and so blessed you spend time with us to give us your
[3:32:58.400 --> 3:32:59.040]  analysis
[3:32:59.040 --> 3:33:04.040]  other areas with Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq
[3:33:04.040 --> 3:33:05.640]  I mean just in the big picture
[3:33:05.640 --> 3:33:09.040]  where does it look like things are going for the United States, Europe
[3:33:09.040 --> 3:33:12.040]  if you had to project the lines out
[3:33:12.040 --> 3:33:15.280]  what do you see happening in our society
[3:33:15.280 --> 3:33:19.600]  overall because of the economy, it just all of it looks like an empire
[3:33:19.600 --> 3:33:23.560]  that's falling in on itself, oppressive domestic police states,
[3:33:23.560 --> 3:33:27.840]  both parties backing it, I mean it doesn't look good
[3:33:27.840 --> 3:33:30.040]  it doesn't at all and the
[3:33:30.040 --> 3:33:34.280]  the operative factor here is whether the president is really a part of the
[3:33:34.280 --> 3:33:38.520]  reality or whether he's pretty much already given up
[3:33:38.520 --> 3:33:40.640]  given up his tasks here
[3:33:40.640 --> 3:33:46.760]  I don't know if many of your listeners or viewers saw the interview that he gave to a
[3:33:46.760 --> 3:33:47.840]  western
[3:33:47.840 --> 3:33:51.040]  reporter, anchor man
[3:33:51.040 --> 3:33:52.200]  in Beijing
[3:33:52.200 --> 3:33:58.400]  the follow-up story about saying, now Mr. President, we like to talk about the problems here in China, but of course the
[3:33:58.400 --> 3:34:00.160]  U.S. has its own problems
[3:34:00.160 --> 3:34:03.840]  and Bush cut him off, he said, wait a second, wait a second
[3:34:03.840 --> 3:34:05.160]  problems?
[3:34:05.160 --> 3:34:09.440]  the United States of America doesn't have any problems
[3:34:09.440 --> 3:34:10.880]  he was serious
[3:34:10.880 --> 3:34:13.480]  and if that's his attitude
[3:34:13.480 --> 3:34:15.680]  would the economy falling apart
[3:34:15.680 --> 3:34:19.480]  with the stuff in Georgia going on, with Iraq and Iran
[3:34:19.480 --> 3:34:22.720]  I mean if you think there are no problems and he's divorced from reality, he's
[3:34:22.720 --> 3:34:23.920]  certifiable
[3:34:23.920 --> 3:34:28.960]  and it would probably be a good idea for the psychiatrists in Washington, D.C.
[3:34:28.960 --> 3:34:31.320]  to try to get him committed
[3:34:31.320 --> 3:34:34.800]  although you have to do change at the same time
[3:34:34.800 --> 3:34:38.080]  so this is a very large factor, so
[3:34:38.080 --> 3:34:41.320]  it really is the bizarre circumstance here that
[3:34:41.320 --> 3:34:46.040]  if we can get through the next five months without anything really really bad happening
[3:34:46.040 --> 3:34:48.440]  then there's some hope for the future
[3:34:48.440 --> 3:34:51.360]  but as you know my concern is that these
[3:34:51.360 --> 3:34:55.360]  fellows can start a major war within the next five months
[3:34:55.360 --> 3:35:00.560]  and I see that possibility as so important and so worrying
[3:35:00.560 --> 3:35:03.920]  that everybody needs to do their part to get to their representatives and
[3:35:03.920 --> 3:35:07.760]  senators and say, look, no war on Iran, no matter how it happens, whether
[3:35:07.760 --> 3:35:09.400]  the Israelis started or
[3:35:09.400 --> 3:35:11.720]  however it happens, it's not gonna
[3:35:11.720 --> 3:35:17.080]  help our country and it'll be a disaster for our troops. Does it worsen things
[3:35:17.080 --> 3:35:19.920]  in relation to an Iran
[3:35:19.920 --> 3:35:24.320]  attack on air bombardment? Now that Georgia has been insulted and there's
[3:35:24.320 --> 3:35:25.720]  this escalation
[3:35:25.720 --> 3:35:29.320]  on their western flank and their southern flank
[3:35:29.320 --> 3:35:33.720]  because people were, I mean, a lot of analysts and political scientists and
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:37.320]  folks like yourself have all been basically saying the same thing that Russia and China
[3:35:37.320 --> 3:35:41.760]  could be drawn into an Iran crisis, an imploding in the economy,
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:45.320]  brush fires breaking out in other parts of the world, other countries are going to
[3:35:45.320 --> 3:35:47.520]  use this diversion to move on other
[3:35:47.520 --> 3:35:51.280]  breakaway republics, you know, that's how World War started.
[3:35:51.280 --> 3:35:55.840]  So does this make it even more dangerous now if they do go into Iran or attack
[3:35:55.840 --> 3:35:56.800]  Iran
[3:35:56.800 --> 3:35:59.960]  and is this hiked in the chance that Russia will be
[3:35:59.960 --> 3:36:02.480]  somehow drawn into that?
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:06.760]  Well, it does make it more dangerous. You know, I mentioned the Grenada
[3:36:06.760 --> 3:36:12.400]  syndrome before. When the US gets a real bloody nose, as it did
[3:36:12.400 --> 3:36:18.440]  in Lebanon when 242 of our Marines were killed by an explosion back in 83,
[3:36:18.440 --> 3:36:22.120]  the first thing we did was try to find some place where we could demonstrate
[3:36:22.120 --> 3:36:23.440]  our military might
[3:36:23.440 --> 3:36:27.040]  and we picked the awesome task of defeating Grenada
[3:36:27.040 --> 3:36:32.760]  and the Caribbean, okay? Now this is a bloody nose of equal magnitude
[3:36:32.760 --> 3:36:34.240]  and so there will be
[3:36:34.240 --> 3:36:38.960]  nail conservatives, there will be hardliners in the White House and the
[3:36:38.960 --> 3:36:40.520]  Pentagon, which will say,
[3:36:40.520 --> 3:36:44.480]  look, you know, we've been given a bloody nose and we've got to demonstrate our
[3:36:44.480 --> 3:36:45.400]  prowess
[3:36:45.400 --> 3:36:48.600]  and how better to do that than to help the Israelis
[3:36:48.600 --> 3:36:52.560]  defeat the Iranian, quote, threat, nuclear threat.
[3:36:52.560 --> 3:36:55.760]  So that's the Grenada syndrome that really bothers me.
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:36:58.640]  The other business, you know,
[3:36:58.640 --> 3:37:02.720]  the rest can just play out for the next five months, although it won't play out
[3:37:02.720 --> 3:37:04.240]  favorably for us,
[3:37:04.240 --> 3:37:08.600]  but everyone knows that the Bush is a lame duck.
[3:37:08.600 --> 3:37:11.080]  One of the interesting things is that Proctor,
[3:37:11.080 --> 3:37:14.360]  you know, a very influential paper in the Soviet Union,
[3:37:14.360 --> 3:37:19.560]  has taken to calling our president to shut up. An imbecile.
[3:37:19.560 --> 3:37:23.520]  Yeah, and they say he's a clown, you know, so nobody's taken him very seriously, but
[3:37:23.520 --> 3:37:25.600]  everybody's worried about it. Now,
[3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:27.800]  Russia looks on it and says,
[3:37:27.800 --> 3:37:31.640]  and I talked to a Russian producer when I was on Russian TV recently and I said,
[3:37:31.640 --> 3:37:33.120]  aren't you guys worried
[3:37:33.120 --> 3:37:36.960]  that the US might invade or not invade, but
[3:37:36.960 --> 3:37:39.760]  upon Iran, right on your southern frontier,
[3:37:39.760 --> 3:37:43.120]  it looked at me, smiley, says, well, you know, what happened to the price of oil
[3:37:43.120 --> 3:37:45.160]  or did that happen? I said, yeah.
[3:37:45.160 --> 3:37:49.760]  He says, well, you know, we get all the oil, right? Yeah, over half of it, yeah.
[3:37:49.760 --> 3:37:53.680]  He says, well, you know, we'll just live a little higher on the hog here and you guys
[3:37:53.680 --> 3:37:54.680]  will get even
[3:37:54.680 --> 3:37:59.280]  thoroughly more, more enmeshed in that situation. Well, I'm going to govern and
[3:37:59.280 --> 3:38:01.080]  close before we go to calls.
[3:38:01.080 --> 3:38:04.360]  The problem I see here
[3:38:04.360 --> 3:38:07.800]  is that I got, you know, I coldly research
[3:38:07.800 --> 3:38:12.280]  and then coldly come about with my beliefs and then I get on air
[3:38:12.280 --> 3:38:15.560]  and get all hot-headed about it so it looks like I'm wild or looks like I'm
[3:38:15.560 --> 3:38:17.360]  ego driven, but I'm actually not.
[3:38:17.360 --> 3:38:21.560]  And as I get older, I lose more and more of my ego. I actually kind of miss it
[3:38:21.560 --> 3:38:23.200]  because it's a good propulsion system.
[3:38:23.200 --> 3:38:26.000]  I can tell you don't have much of an ego, you know, you're more of a scientific
[3:38:26.000 --> 3:38:27.240]  type guy with your mindset.
[3:38:27.240 --> 3:38:30.560]  And but then when I look at these powerful people more and more, especially these
[3:38:30.560 --> 3:38:31.720]  neocons and others,
[3:38:31.720 --> 3:38:36.560]  it really seems like they are very childlike and have no sense of responsibility
[3:38:36.560 --> 3:38:40.960]  and that they are ego driven. And I'm not even saying I'm some wonderful
[3:38:40.960 --> 3:38:42.480]  person or you're some wonderful person,
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:45.880]  but just in life, being a father, having responsibilities or
[3:38:45.880 --> 3:38:50.440]  having some employees or, you know, it seems like I have more concern about
[3:38:50.440 --> 3:38:53.520]  the world's future than even they do. It seems like, I don't even know what I'm
[3:38:53.520 --> 3:38:54.760]  really saying here. It's like
[3:38:54.760 --> 3:38:57.880]  an ego driven recklessness when you talk about
[3:38:57.880 --> 3:39:02.160]  the Grenada syndrome about, you know, needing to go kick some little island's
[3:39:02.160 --> 3:39:04.480]  butt so you look good or feel tough.
[3:39:04.480 --> 3:39:07.960]  But then I look at the psychology and the statements and the things these people
[3:39:07.960 --> 3:39:08.560]  say
[3:39:08.560 --> 3:39:11.480]  and it even scares me more because I realize
[3:39:11.480 --> 3:39:15.400]  that I, that they really are just absolutely
[3:39:15.400 --> 3:39:18.080]  psychopathic.
[3:39:18.080 --> 3:39:22.320]  Look at Bush in his record, even growing up as a child,
[3:39:22.320 --> 3:39:25.880]  he never was held accountable for anything, Alex.
[3:39:25.880 --> 3:39:29.880]  For nothing was he ever held accountable.
[3:39:29.880 --> 3:39:33.880]  More recently, I remember four or five years ago when
[3:39:33.880 --> 3:39:37.000]  Bob Woodward was writing books about this administration,
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:40.280]  he interviewed him and said, are you interested in your,
[3:39:40.280 --> 3:39:43.320]  would you care about your place in history? And Bush said,
[3:39:43.320 --> 3:39:46.120]  history will all be dead.
[3:39:46.120 --> 3:39:48.920]  Well, you know what? I always thought that was kind of weird
[3:39:48.920 --> 3:39:53.160]  and then just two weeks ago, Bush said exactly the same thing. History
[3:39:53.160 --> 3:39:56.040]  will all be dead. So, you know, what more do you need
[3:39:56.040 --> 3:39:59.240]  than that to show how irresponsible or unaccountable it is?
[3:39:59.240 --> 3:40:02.520]  He's not thinking about any future generations. It's the ultimate
[3:40:02.520 --> 3:40:06.680]  selfishness. It's, I don't care what people 50 years, 100 years say,
[3:40:06.680 --> 3:40:10.280]  because it's all about me, me, me, not his grandchildren, not his progeny,
[3:40:10.280 --> 3:40:14.680]  not his name, no sense of community, no sense of the future, no sense of
[3:40:14.680 --> 3:40:18.840]  connection to the rest of society. And it's admitted, he brags,
[3:40:18.840 --> 3:40:22.680]  that he would kill little animals, that he would torture animals to death.
[3:40:22.680 --> 3:40:24.200]  That is a psychopath.
[3:40:24.200 --> 3:40:27.160]  Well, he did. He did. As a matter of fact, he used to,
[3:40:27.160 --> 3:40:31.400]  he used to take firecrackers and the orifices of, of, of toads
[3:40:31.400 --> 3:40:35.800]  back there in Texas and then blow them up. And Colleen Rowley, my good friend,
[3:40:35.800 --> 3:40:39.240]  who is the FBI person on the whistle on 9-11,
[3:40:39.240 --> 3:40:42.840]  and she tells me that if that ever appeared on the record of an applicant
[3:40:42.840 --> 3:40:46.840]  for employment with the FBI, the application would automatically
[3:40:46.840 --> 3:40:51.320]  be thrown in the, in the trash because that's a sign of,
[3:40:51.320 --> 3:40:55.960]  of subsequent, you know, psychotic behavior.
[3:40:55.960 --> 3:41:00.040]  Now let me just finish with one thing that scares me most and that is
[3:41:00.040 --> 3:41:04.760]  if we do strike Iran, Iran, as I've said before, has
[3:41:04.760 --> 3:41:09.880]  immense possibilities of striking back at us to include cutting off our supply
[3:41:09.880 --> 3:41:14.360]  lines of our troops in Iraq. What is the United States going to do then?
[3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:18.520]  Well, somebody said, well, send in more troops. There aren't any more troops.
[3:41:18.520 --> 3:41:23.240]  But what do we have? We have these mini nukes and that is what they're falling
[3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:27.640]  back on because these neocons, they have no real appreciation for the
[3:41:27.640 --> 3:41:31.480]  difference between, you know, high explosive weaponry
[3:41:31.480 --> 3:41:34.760]  and the kinds of nuclear weaponry that hasn't been used
[3:41:34.760 --> 3:41:38.760]  since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And so,
[3:41:38.760 --> 3:41:42.760]  you know, this is, this is really bizarre because it will be the only thing
[3:41:42.760 --> 3:41:46.840]  that will be available for Bush to use under those circumstances and that's
[3:41:46.840 --> 3:41:51.160]  why there's a real premium on our all doing everything we can
[3:41:51.160 --> 3:41:55.240]  to make sure that nothing happens that will perpetrate this kind of air attack
[3:41:55.240 --> 3:41:58.440]  on Iran because the way they will retaliate might
[3:41:58.440 --> 3:42:02.440]  force us to either retreat victimously or use
[3:42:02.440 --> 3:42:05.800]  these quote mini nukes in a way that would just let the
[3:42:05.800 --> 3:42:09.240]  nuclear genie right out of the bottle. And by the way, the only thing backing up the
[3:42:09.240 --> 3:42:12.600]  dollar now is the view as this is the hegemonic
[3:42:12.600 --> 3:42:17.720]  lone unipolar superpower. I mean, wouldn't a U.S. route and defeat
[3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:21.880]  and collapse probably bring us into depression?
[3:42:21.880 --> 3:42:28.360]  Well, yeah, I think that even if, you know, even if the worst didn't happen and
[3:42:28.360 --> 3:42:32.040]  the use of nuclear weapons were avoided, you know, those
[3:42:32.040 --> 3:42:36.120]  streets in Hormuz would be closed at the price of oil with
[3:42:36.120 --> 3:42:39.320]  skyrocket and we're talking about worldwide
[3:42:39.320 --> 3:42:43.800]  depression or all this to happen now. So most people conclude, well, then of
[3:42:43.800 --> 3:42:47.080]  course, McGovern, what are you worried about? It's so crazy the president would
[3:42:47.080 --> 3:42:51.320]  never do that. Well, right, you look away, he did with respect to Iraq.
[3:42:51.320 --> 3:42:55.160]  He's not really cognizant of what's going on around him in the world.
[3:42:55.160 --> 3:42:59.880]  I mean, I was just telling somebody the other day, look,
[3:42:59.880 --> 3:43:05.160]  when back in the spring, when there was all kinds of talk in the press and
[3:43:05.160 --> 3:43:10.360]  even in his own press conferences run by his press secretary,
[3:43:10.360 --> 3:43:15.160]  you know, Fort Aula Oil, okay? Now, he has his own press conference the next day
[3:43:15.160 --> 3:43:18.520]  and when the reporters say, well, how are you looking, Mr. President, at Fort Aula
[3:43:18.520 --> 3:43:22.440]  Oil? And he says, what? Say that again. Fort, how are you looking at the
[3:43:22.440 --> 3:43:25.800]  possibility? Fort Aula Oil, although I thought you
[3:43:25.800 --> 3:43:28.680]  think it spoiled out, nobody told me. I'll have to
[3:43:28.680 --> 3:43:32.920]  go back. I'll have to ask about that. That's like a fable. That's like
[3:43:32.920 --> 3:43:37.400]  a Eesop's fable with the crazy king that doesn't know the city's burning and he's
[3:43:37.400 --> 3:43:40.520]  dancing around playing his flute or is
[3:43:40.520 --> 3:43:45.000]  ukulele. I mean, it's just, you know, I don't know what's more scary,
[3:43:45.000 --> 3:43:49.240]  Ray McGovern, that they, that they, we know they armed and trained Georgia for
[3:43:49.240 --> 3:43:51.320]  this, but whether they gave them the green light or not,
[3:43:51.320 --> 3:43:54.360]  if they gave them the green light, it shows they're crazy and miscalculated,
[3:43:54.360 --> 3:43:57.080]  but if they didn't give the green light, it means that they don't even control
[3:43:57.080 --> 3:44:00.280]  their own puppet states, meaning they're completely out of control. What's more
[3:44:00.280 --> 3:44:04.280]  scary? Well, the latter is more scary because that
[3:44:04.280 --> 3:44:09.080]  means that just as the Georgians can be, think that that they can do away with,
[3:44:09.080 --> 3:44:13.160]  get away with this kind of thing. So, to the Israelis and the Israelis,
[3:44:13.160 --> 3:44:17.640]  unfortunately, will be right because there's nothing that will stop
[3:44:17.640 --> 3:44:22.280]  the United States of America to springing, springing
[3:44:22.280 --> 3:44:25.880]  to the defense of Israel, whether or not Israel starts it,
[3:44:25.880 --> 3:44:29.080]  because that's just the way the political ends. And how is it going to help
[3:44:29.080 --> 3:44:34.920]  Israel to launch an attack on Iran? Well, that's just, it is, it is here, but
[3:44:34.920 --> 3:44:38.440]  see, these people have an incredibly myopic view
[3:44:38.440 --> 3:44:43.560]  of their security needs. They think that in this century, they can continue,
[3:44:43.560 --> 3:44:47.560]  continue to, just to, might make right, they're the strongest ones. They're
[3:44:47.560 --> 3:44:51.480]  going to, they're going to obliterate any opposition. Well, I think I'll work over
[3:44:51.480 --> 3:44:55.240]  the long run. And so, even in the midterm, Israel,
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:44:59.800]  Israel is going to suffer greatly under this myopic policy.
[3:44:59.800 --> 3:45:03.320]  Well, I mean, this seems bizarre to us, but you know history, I know it's
[3:45:03.320 --> 3:45:07.480]  somewhat. Really, if you study history, read that. Read the basics of what
[3:45:07.480 --> 3:45:11.800]  happened. It's always nuts getting control and do things like this, because
[3:45:11.800 --> 3:45:15.080]  there's nothing but yes men around them. They have all this power. They're in
[3:45:15.080 --> 3:45:19.320]  marble lined palaces and they just lose touch.
[3:45:19.320 --> 3:45:25.800]  You know, it's August and there's an incredible novel, a historical book
[3:45:25.800 --> 3:45:29.640]  called The Guns of August by Barbara Toogman.
[3:45:29.640 --> 3:45:32.760]  And I would recommend it about the beginning of World War I,
[3:45:32.760 --> 3:45:36.760]  and I would recommend that highly to anyone who wants to read it.
[3:45:36.760 --> 3:45:41.080]  She talks about all kinds of things and draws all kinds of analogies
[3:45:41.080 --> 3:45:47.960]  and she wrote a subsequent book, The March of Folly from Troy
[3:45:47.960 --> 3:45:52.440]  to Vietnam. That too, I recommend, because it shows that
[3:45:52.440 --> 3:45:55.880]  people can be oblivious to the realities around them,
[3:45:55.880 --> 3:45:59.640]  that their psychopaths are around the leaders,
[3:45:59.640 --> 3:46:03.400]  can mislead them and prevent them from seeing the realities,
[3:46:03.400 --> 3:46:06.600]  and it's all too scary. Read The Guns of August,
[3:46:06.600 --> 3:46:11.000]  read The March of Folly from Troy to Vietnam, both by
[3:46:11.000 --> 3:46:14.920]  the incredibly astute historian Barbara Toogman.
[3:46:14.920 --> 3:46:17.880]  On a separate note, read consortiumnews.com,
[3:46:17.880 --> 3:46:21.000]  Dear Colin, just type Ray McGovern, Dear Colin,
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:25.480]  his letter to Colin Powell about how they gave him false intelligence and
[3:46:25.480 --> 3:46:28.200]  lied to him, which is criminal right there, and that's a whole
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:31.080]  other subject. Let's jam in a few calls. I'm going to skip this break by the way
[3:46:31.080 --> 3:46:34.520]  folks. Laser in the UK. Laser, you're on the air
[3:46:34.520 --> 3:46:37.880]  with Ray McGovern. Hi Alex, are you hearing me good?
[3:46:37.880 --> 3:46:43.240]  Yes I can. Hi Laser. Hi. I just wanted to touch on a few
[3:46:43.240 --> 3:46:46.440]  points, but I know you guys got a big problem over there. You got toddlers in
[3:46:46.440 --> 3:46:49.720]  the White House. You know toddlers don't have the ability
[3:46:49.720 --> 3:46:53.320]  to empathize, but they don't have the ability to take
[3:46:53.320 --> 3:46:57.400]  responses for their actions. Yeah, a two-year-old baby's a good description of
[3:46:57.400 --> 3:47:02.440]  George Bush. Exactly. Now I just wanted to touch on
[3:47:02.440 --> 3:47:06.280]  a few things. I don't know if you guys have noticed the connection between
[3:47:06.280 --> 3:47:11.640]  England and Georgia. I mean if you take a look at the flags,
[3:47:11.640 --> 3:47:15.400]  the St. George's flag of England and the Georgian flag, there's a pretty big
[3:47:15.400 --> 3:47:19.160]  connection right there. They look exactly the same,
[3:47:19.160 --> 3:47:25.160]  and I wanted to talk about... I just see another medieval flag.
[3:47:25.160 --> 3:47:29.000]  Exactly. I wanted to talk about Gary McKinnon,
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:32.600]  a guy who just lives up the road from me. He's about to be
[3:47:32.600 --> 3:47:36.920]  extradited to the United States for hacking into the Pentagon,
[3:47:36.920 --> 3:47:41.560]  NASA computers, and a couple other sensitive sites over there.
[3:47:41.560 --> 3:47:47.480]  Your phone sounds like an electric razor. Go ahead and ask a question.
[3:47:47.480 --> 3:47:50.920]  I'm not mad at you. It's just a bad phone. Ask a question to Ray McGovern, sir. That's
[3:47:50.920 --> 3:47:56.040]  who we're open the phones up for. Okay.
[3:47:56.040 --> 3:48:02.040]  To Ray McGovern, what do you think about that hacker being extradited?
[3:48:02.040 --> 3:48:05.880]  And also there's a big story up on CNN about
[3:48:05.880 --> 3:48:10.760]  US at risk of cyber attacks, because George was apparently attacked.
[3:48:10.760 --> 3:48:14.920]  I appreciate your call. I've analyzed that cyber attack.
[3:48:14.920 --> 3:48:18.200]  That was people and companies, that was classic stuff kids did
[3:48:18.200 --> 3:48:21.720]  with denial of service, and even the New York Times had to say it was not a
[3:48:21.720 --> 3:48:26.360]  Russian cyber attack. Maybe Ray McGovern disagrees, Ray.
[3:48:26.360 --> 3:48:30.120]  Well, I think the cyber situation is very important,
[3:48:30.120 --> 3:48:36.600]  and the fact that the Pentagon computers could be hacked is a
[3:48:36.600 --> 3:48:42.920]  case in point to respond to Lacer as your comment about the toddlers.
[3:48:42.920 --> 3:48:49.240]  You know, I just helped my grandson in his nursery school,
[3:48:49.240 --> 3:48:52.680]  and was talking with one of the teachers afterwards, and
[3:48:52.680 --> 3:48:57.160]  asked her, what do you try to teach children at this age, in the age of four?
[3:48:57.160 --> 3:49:01.560]  And she said, oh, that's very simple. We teach them how to share.
[3:49:01.560 --> 3:49:07.240]  Now, Cheney and Bush must have missed nursery school, because
[3:49:07.240 --> 3:49:13.000]  at the basis of all this, it has to do with a limited amount of
[3:49:13.000 --> 3:49:17.800]  natural resources in this world, and the need to share them,
[3:49:17.800 --> 3:49:22.040]  not to attack and occupy the country with the second largest
[3:49:22.040 --> 3:49:26.440]  world hypothesis, but to work out some sort of a deal with Russia, with China,
[3:49:26.440 --> 3:49:29.800]  with India, with the real other people, with real needs for these
[3:49:29.800 --> 3:49:33.560]  national resources, natural resources, to share.
[3:49:33.560 --> 3:49:37.960]  And once you don't have any concept of sharing, and you have the kind of
[3:49:37.960 --> 3:49:41.880]  military strength that we have, well, that's what brings this kind of situation.
[3:49:41.880 --> 3:49:45.240]  So it's a good point. Toddlers, yeah. Well, I agree, but this isn't even
[3:49:45.240 --> 3:49:48.360]  sharing. This isn't their oil. This isn't their gas.
[3:49:48.360 --> 3:49:51.560]  And they act like everything's there. So I guess that is kind of like a toddler
[3:49:51.560 --> 3:49:55.560]  where they just think everything is theirs. Yeah, never learned. I wish they could
[3:49:55.560 --> 3:49:59.560]  go back to, you know, being four years old again, when maybe we could retrain them.
[3:49:59.560 --> 3:50:02.920]  Yeah, Laser, that was a good point you made. We're going to skip this final
[3:50:02.920 --> 3:50:05.160]  break. Take a few calls for Ray McGovern. Come back and
[3:50:05.160 --> 3:50:08.760]  let him have a few minutes of any closing comments.
[3:50:08.760 --> 3:50:13.400]  But Helen and George and others, we're going to you here in just a moment.
[3:50:13.400 --> 3:50:17.160]  Don't forget the editorial he's put out. It's excellent. A piece.
[3:50:17.160 --> 3:50:20.840]  It's Dear Colin by Ray McGovern, consortiumnews.com.
[3:50:20.840 --> 3:50:30.280]  Okay, here we go.
[3:50:30.280 --> 3:50:35.400]  Okay, let's go to Helen in Florida. You're on the air, Helen.
[3:50:35.400 --> 3:50:41.480]  Yes. Yeah, you're on the air. I wanted to ask if you happen to notice a
[3:50:41.480 --> 3:50:47.240]  flip of the control the media has. These phones are all really bad. Can you
[3:50:47.240 --> 3:50:52.440]  talk right into that? Can you talk to me? A few nights ago on the news,
[3:50:52.440 --> 3:50:55.560]  I think, is Brian Williams. The comment was made. It showed a scene.
[3:50:55.560 --> 3:51:01.240]  A woman was very badly wounded and a Russian soldier was helping her and said she'd been
[3:51:01.240 --> 3:51:06.600]  shot by a Georgian soldier and that was kind of a flip that they let out.
[3:51:06.600 --> 3:51:09.720]  Yeah, that's a whole other subject and I'm glad you brought this up, Helen.
[3:51:09.720 --> 3:51:12.840]  What about the contempt of the corporate media,
[3:51:12.840 --> 3:51:16.120]  quietly announcing in each report that it was all a sneak attack by Georgia that
[3:51:16.120 --> 3:51:21.240]  precipitated the Russians coming in, but I saw headlines in the news like Georgia
[3:51:21.240 --> 3:51:24.600]  attacked by Russia and I have people on the street telling me I'm a liar.
[3:51:24.600 --> 3:51:28.520]  I'm getting calls even on air saying that I'm basically a communist,
[3:51:28.520 --> 3:51:32.120]  that I'm siding with Russia and that Georgia didn't attack Russia
[3:51:32.760 --> 3:51:36.680]  and then McCain comes out and Bush come out and say you don't attack nations in
[3:51:36.680 --> 3:51:42.120]  the 21st century. You don't invade them. I mean, again, it's more than just
[3:51:42.120 --> 3:51:46.280]  delusional. It's like they're inviting the public to be part of the delusion, right, McGovern?
[3:51:46.840 --> 3:51:52.280]  Well, they, it's the Russians that don't invade other countries. We can, we can
[3:51:52.280 --> 3:51:58.760]  invade Iraq or, you know, it's, it's really a function of how, how low the media have,
[3:51:58.760 --> 3:52:03.560]  have become here and the fact that American citizens can no longer learn what's really
[3:52:03.560 --> 3:52:10.120]  going on in the world unless they tune into radio programs like yours or read the alternative press.
[3:52:10.120 --> 3:52:16.440]  You know, one of the more bizarre reflections of this, Alex, was, was Fox News,
[3:52:17.000 --> 3:52:24.040]  carrying an interview with a 12-year-old girl who was in South Ossetia when, when it was attacked
[3:52:24.040 --> 3:52:28.360]  and she, she talked about how terrible it was hiding in the cellar with all these bombs and
[3:52:28.360 --> 3:52:33.720]  rockets going off and who rescued them? The Russians. Now, guess what? As she was getting
[3:52:33.720 --> 3:52:39.000]  the portion to say who rescued them, they went to break. Okay? An early break, I would add.
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:42.920]  It was much great. And then when they came back, they forgot that segment.
[3:52:42.920 --> 3:52:45.880]  Well, no, he, well, Shepard Smith added, we have the clip, we've played it.
[3:52:46.440 --> 3:52:51.080]  I'm glad you brought that up, Ray. He says that's what Russia wants you to believe and
[3:52:51.080 --> 3:52:58.120]  ended the segment. Yeah. Well, you know, what we have here now is one of the, the Russian,
[3:52:58.760 --> 3:53:06.600]  one of the Russian television stations putting on air, what actually happened and,
[3:53:06.600 --> 3:53:13.000]  and excoriating the biased U.S. press for the way they, they handle things. Now,
[3:53:13.000 --> 3:53:17.720]  we've come a long way from my days of analyzing the Soviet Union when, of course,
[3:53:17.720 --> 3:53:22.840]  they had a regime-controlled press. Now we have the Russians accusing us of precisely the same
[3:53:22.840 --> 3:53:28.840]  thing. And sorrowfully, they have a very good point. Absolutely. Here we go back in the final segment.
[3:53:28.840 --> 3:53:35.880]  Real fast, George and Iowa. Last caller for Ray McGovern. Go ahead.
[3:53:37.880 --> 3:53:43.640]  Oh, hi. Hi, George. I actually have three subjects, but since there's not a lot of time,
[3:53:45.240 --> 3:53:51.240]  I wanted to talk about the original 13th article of amendment to the Constitution of the United
[3:53:51.240 --> 3:53:55.160]  States. Okay. Letters of nobility that our leaders can't be sold out to foreign interest,
[3:53:55.160 --> 3:54:01.240]  kind of like a, the Logan Act. Yeah. Um, why, why isn't it there?
[3:54:02.360 --> 3:54:05.880]  Why isn't it applicable to George Bush's ties with Saudi Arabia?
[3:54:07.080 --> 3:54:12.520]  Well, of course it is. Um, but what the problem is is Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats,
[3:54:13.080 --> 3:54:18.520]  I just don't have the, well, it's not that they lack the guts, although that's also true.
[3:54:18.520 --> 3:54:23.960]  They see a political advantage in just letting this thing simmer and not allow themselves to
[3:54:23.960 --> 3:54:30.120]  be accused by Fox News of being disruptive or divisive, um, before the election. Plus a lot
[3:54:30.120 --> 3:54:34.600]  of power has been grabbed and they want that power. Don't think any of these mechanisms that
[3:54:34.600 --> 3:54:39.720]  have been built up that are unconstitutional are going away, right? Yeah. Um, that's, uh,
[3:54:39.720 --> 3:54:44.760]  you know, once this precedent is, is laid, it's going to be very difficult. It's, you know, power
[3:54:44.760 --> 3:54:51.320]  is never given up. Um, it's gotta be prevented from, uh, from the kind of accretion that we've
[3:54:51.320 --> 3:54:56.440]  seen so far. And, and if we don't stand up, if there is no move toward impeachment, that's why
[3:54:56.440 --> 3:55:03.000]  I wrote the letter to Colin Powell. You know, it really is incredible. Uh, what happened here is
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:08.920]  that the head of the, uh, Iraqi intelligence, the head of the Iraqi intelligence, mind you,
[3:55:08.920 --> 3:55:13.880]  and the foreign minister, both of whom Saddam Hussein thought were working for him were really
[3:55:13.880 --> 3:55:18.840]  working for us. And what did they tell us? Well, the foreign minister told us six months
[3:55:18.840 --> 3:55:24.040]  before the invasion, there are no weapons of mass destruction and he was verified. Okay.
[3:55:24.040 --> 3:55:29.480]  He was verified in terms of what else he had told us. And the, uh, Iraqi, uh, intelligence chief
[3:55:29.480 --> 3:55:34.440]  told us in January, so well before Powell's speech that there were no weapons of mass
[3:55:34.440 --> 3:55:40.520]  destruction. So my letter to Powell on consortium.news says, look, if you were told us, you weren't,
[3:55:40.520 --> 3:55:45.640]  if you weren't, but God's sake, you should be raising holy hell and going to conure everybody
[3:55:45.640 --> 3:55:50.760]  out. Yeah, this is open and shut. They're criminals. It's a fact and Powell becomes
[3:55:50.760 --> 3:55:54.760]  complicit in all this by now not blowing the whistle. Thank you, George, for the call.
[3:55:54.760 --> 3:55:59.160]  Ray McGovern, an amazing 50 minute interview. Thank you for all your time and thank you for
[3:55:59.160 --> 3:56:03.560]  everything you do. God bless you. You're very welcome. There goes Ray McGovern. We are out of

[3:56:21.720 --> 3:56:25.560]  these women. And that's what the government is. It's just another, another scam, another fraud.
[3:56:25.560 --> 3:56:30.200]  I wanted to go over that, but I'll go over that tomorrow. But I did cover all of that
