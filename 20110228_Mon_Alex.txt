[00:50.560 --> 00:55.480]  Dykes I'm filling in for Alex he's up in New York today we just saw a segment
[00:55.480 --> 01:00.180]  on The View with ABC with over 30 million viewers talking about the
[01:00.180 --> 01:04.960]  Charlie Sheen incident Alex will be popping in on the broadcast later to
[01:04.960 --> 01:09.560]  talk about that clip we're gonna play it for you just after the break of course
[01:09.560 --> 01:14.160]  we're gonna cover everything going on in the Middle East primary primarily
[01:14.160 --> 01:19.960]  Libya and everything about Gaddafi and the Eastern rebel forces and whether or
[01:19.960 --> 01:24.840]  not the US is gonna intervene on a humanitarian or other pretext we will
[01:24.840 --> 01:31.000]  also cover the refugees headed to Egypt and also Tunisia two countries that
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.600]  just got out of the frying pan and later in the broadcast we will have James
[01:35.600 --> 01:40.560]  Corbett of the Corbett report calm he's gonna help break down the Middle East
[01:40.560 --> 01:45.320]  crisis and we're gonna talk about the rise of global government which of
[01:45.320 --> 01:51.640]  course the Middle East arc of crisis destabilization kind of juicy region is
[01:51.640 --> 01:57.560]  a big part of but we will get into that later and then in the third hour we're
[01:57.560 --> 02:02.440]  gonna have a replay of cat Catherine Austin Fitz and that is all coming up
[02:02.440 --> 02:09.120]  after the break right now we want to cover some of the Libya stuff Obama's
[02:09.120 --> 02:14.880]  humanitarian conquest of Libya that's Paul Joseph Watson from today when his
[02:14.880 --> 02:19.360]  predator drone attack kills 90% innocence president suddenly develops a
[02:19.360 --> 02:24.560]  conscience for human suffering here we have Obama given the Nobel Peace Prize
[02:24.560 --> 02:29.320]  supposedly on the idea that he's going to end war in the Middle East but
[02:29.320 --> 02:34.360]  instead he's just gearing up for a wider war and we can only pray that doesn't
[02:34.360 --> 02:40.320]  become World War three or Iran or anything really big we also have Kurt
[02:40.320 --> 02:45.400]  Nemo the Libyans say no thanks to globalist intervention these are the
[02:45.400 --> 02:51.360]  rebel forces that are held up in the eastern city of Benghazi and they have
[02:51.360 --> 02:56.360]  said foreign intervention would not be welcomed the daily caller reports they
[02:56.360 --> 02:59.880]  do not want foreign intervention they want to deal with Gaddafi on their own
[02:59.880 --> 03:04.640]  terms we have of course Secretary of State Hillary Clinton we have John
[03:04.640 --> 03:09.280]  McCain we have Joe Lieberman all working in the region trying to kick this
[03:09.280 --> 03:13.840]  thing off under whatever pretext they will walk away with right now they're
[03:13.840 --> 03:18.800]  gonna use the humanitarian buzzword it appears an old favorite if you go back
[03:18.800 --> 03:23.720]  to I'll bring this up later Jim Tucker has always talked about how the
[03:23.720 --> 03:28.680]  Bilderbergers love those smaller humanitarian reasons just like the
[03:28.680 --> 03:33.200]  wars in the Balkans rather than the bigger wars like Iraq they had to fight
[03:33.200 --> 03:38.160]  and Bilderberg for the Iraq war but they love the smaller scale stuff where the
[03:38.160 --> 03:42.840]  US and the world government forces the United Nations and NATO tend to look
[03:42.840 --> 03:47.360]  better as though they're doing something good but really it's a you break it you
[03:47.360 --> 03:51.800]  buy a policy and they are shifting everything in the Middle East right now
[03:51.800 --> 04:00.160]  particularly in Libya we also have Egypt bans gold exports Egypt is not allowing
[04:00.160 --> 04:05.520]  gold at least for individuals to go out of the country at the moment a decree
[04:05.520 --> 04:09.800]  banning the export of gold in all of its forms including jewelry and ornaments
[04:09.800 --> 04:15.960]  was issued by newly appointed trade minister Samir Sayad and it takes
[04:15.960 --> 04:21.640]  effect immediately until June 30th that will surely have repercussions on the
[04:21.640 --> 04:26.720]  world market that's in Reuters and of course we have Egypt looking to rewrite
[04:26.720 --> 04:31.560]  its constitution as it's currently under military control that will be
[04:31.560 --> 04:36.440]  interesting to see how that develops then we have things like DNA genetic pat
[04:36.440 --> 04:42.280]  down introduced by airports and they're going to be using this on immigrants and
[04:42.280 --> 04:46.400]  other people but we know it's gonna spread wider more on that when we get
[04:46.400 --> 04:50.800]  back and Alex Jones on the view injecting real issues through the pop

[06:03.800 --> 06:07.800]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[06:07.800 --> 06:12.040]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[06:12.040 --> 06:16.320]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[06:16.320 --> 06:20.680]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[06:20.680 --> 06:24.760]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[06:24.760 --> 06:29.320]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.320 --> 06:33.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[06:33.440 --> 06:37.400]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[06:37.400 --> 06:41.240]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[06:41.240 --> 06:43.960]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[06:43.960 --> 06:47.400]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at

[07:04.080 --> 07:09.000]  ended on June of 2009 the millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.240]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government employees but for
[07:13.240 --> 07:17.000]  the rest of us things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the
[07:17.000 --> 07:21.320]  news either they've begun their long expected journey to the moon in addition

[08:20.400 --> 08:22.400]  alex jones
[08:22.400 --> 08:42.720]  we are back on info wars.com the alex jones show I am Aaron Dykes filling in
[08:42.720 --> 08:48.600]  till alex gets back he's in New York as we speak he just came off of the view of
[08:48.600 --> 08:54.080]  the ABC show that has over 30 million viewers he was on live talking about the
[08:54.080 --> 08:59.720]  Charlie Sheen celebrity what would be a distraction but alex took the
[08:59.720 --> 09:05.880]  opportunity and really pulled a true info wars interjection of real media
[09:05.880 --> 09:11.320]  issues when they had him on to discuss celebrity you know Charlie's drug
[09:11.320 --> 09:15.600]  situation whether he's off drugs or on drugs and what's going on with the show
[09:15.600 --> 09:20.560]  I don't know I do know Charlie Sheen has been a good friend to 9-11 truth for all
[09:20.560 --> 09:26.560]  these years it was almost five years ago that he broke in and came on this show
[09:26.560 --> 09:33.720]  and raised some serious questions with his big celebrity name and really got a
[09:33.720 --> 09:37.080]  lot of people to take a closer look at 9-11 which of course later led to the
[09:37.080 --> 09:40.680]  c-span conference we'll get back into that in a minute right now we want to
[09:40.680 --> 09:46.560]  play that clip from the view alex jones on just this morning February 28th only a
[09:46.560 --> 09:50.160]  few minutes ago and we're going to play that right now and then break it down for
[09:50.160 --> 09:52.360]  you
[09:53.680 --> 10:00.000]  interview that Charlie sheen did with ABC correspondent Amanda canning and where
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.640]  he passionately defends his lifestyle of drug use and partying but it all
[10:04.640 --> 10:10.200]  started with the radio show rant last Thursday that prompted CBS to cancel the
[10:10.200 --> 10:15.040]  rest of the season of his hit sitcom and we just want to show a little bit of
[10:15.040 --> 10:18.720]  the clip and then you'll meet the man he was talking to take a look
[10:18.720 --> 10:23.400]  I'm loving yeah that's Chuck's real name miss took this rock star for his own
[10:23.400 --> 10:28.400]  selfish exit strategy bro check it Alex I am bearish to him in front of his
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.640]  children in the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind cannot
[10:32.640 --> 10:38.760]  process okay last night check time I've spent I think close to the last decade
[10:38.760 --> 10:43.200]  I don't know effortlessly and magically converting your your tin can and pure
[10:43.200 --> 10:49.560]  gold well joining ours the radio show host and close friend of Charlie sheen
[10:49.560 --> 10:57.480]  the man he was talking to alex jones one thing I know Charlie for about six
[10:57.480 --> 11:00.960]  and a half years he's never drunk alcohol use drugs in front of me he's
[11:00.960 --> 11:04.280]  been completely clean for almost a decade until about seven months ago now
[11:04.280 --> 11:08.360]  he's come off the drugs and the alcohol which is almost like you know being off
[11:08.360 --> 11:12.520]  your meds it has the same effect so he's supercharged he's angry he's focused
[11:12.520 --> 11:15.480]  and I know that when they interviewed him at his house because I talked to him
[11:15.480 --> 11:19.800]  they interviewed him for about two hours that's a little kind of joke that's out
[11:19.800 --> 11:24.920]  of context he's tired of being judged and him being held up as the ultimate
[11:24.920 --> 11:29.200]  demon in this world he didn't kill a million people in Iraq he wasn't
[11:29.200 --> 11:32.440]  involved with the takedown of building seven here in New York and he thinks
[11:32.440 --> 11:36.760]  there's bigger devils out there than himself and Chuck Lorre's put out a
[11:36.760 --> 11:40.280]  whole bunch of these cue cards while having management tell him a month ago
[11:40.280 --> 11:45.040]  if you speak out against four episodes being cut we're gonna fire you then he
[11:45.040 --> 11:50.400]  starts putting out all of these yes Chuck Lorre he starts putting out he
[11:50.400 --> 11:53.560]  starts putting out vanity cards not just on two and a half men but on other shows
[11:53.560 --> 11:58.880]  saying Charlie sheen is dead inside and soulless you didn't show the worst one
[11:58.880 --> 12:02.600]  there and so Charlie's told we're tying your hands now we're gonna beat you up
[12:02.600 --> 12:08.600]  for whatever contract let me ask you so the big the question that I have is
[12:08.600 --> 12:12.240]  who's so you're saying Chuck Lorre started this with the vanity card with
[12:12.240 --> 12:14.960]  the vanity up front had management according to Charlie I've been there
[12:14.960 --> 12:16.960]  when he's on the phone with his management or his manager comes over
[12:16.960 --> 12:23.360]  thanks you fast for me baby slow down they told him they before he said a
[12:23.360 --> 12:26.240]  word they said we're doing this and if you criticize it you're gonna be fired
[12:26.240 --> 12:29.840]  and he said why are you telling me this you know I'm going through a hard time
[12:29.840 --> 12:32.720]  right now but he didn't understand it then I think they're trying to make him
[12:32.720 --> 12:35.840]  quit or something so have to pay out his contract or the hundred million
[12:35.840 --> 12:39.280]  incendication I think there's some shenanigans going on here and then they
[12:39.280 --> 12:42.680]  start putting these things out then they start putting these vanity cards out
[12:42.680 --> 12:47.240]  trying to prod him and pushing it with vanity cards I don't think people know
[12:47.240 --> 12:51.160]  okay most most shows have a logo at the end you know like a little dog or the
[12:51.160 --> 12:56.360]  MGM lion Chuck Lorre has these big write-ups at the end of a show and
[12:56.360 --> 13:00.280]  imagine at the end of the show with Charlie Sheen and other CBS shows this
[13:00.280 --> 13:05.120]  is on air saying this man is soulless this man is dead inside I mean let me
[13:05.120 --> 13:07.760]  ask you this do you think is from that clip that we saw a lot of people would
[13:07.760 --> 13:10.480]  ask for chain okay or assume that Charlie was on drugs again you say he
[13:10.480 --> 13:13.400]  wasn't do you think he's taking blood test you think he's at his house when
[13:13.400 --> 13:17.360]  they come in take the blood I take your I take your two weeks ago do you I hear
[13:17.360 --> 13:20.440]  you do you think he's manic depressive I mean as a friend do you say okay this is
[13:20.440 --> 13:23.000]  something else you guys are missing the boat it's not the drugs he's actually
[13:23.000 --> 13:26.200]  suffering from manic just manic depressive disorder let's just remember you know
[13:26.200 --> 13:30.480]  Charlie's been a star Charlie's been a star for 30 years and all people know
[13:30.480 --> 13:34.920]  about is these episodes where he explodes the Charlie Sheen I know is a
[13:34.920 --> 13:39.000]  compassionate guy who's really smart episodes where he explodes you know he
[13:39.000 --> 13:42.600]  was saying you know this is the best thing that happened to the people who
[13:42.600 --> 13:47.480]  were with me they're never gonna regret it you know this is on drugs carrying up
[13:47.480 --> 13:51.680]  rooms in her town what about that explosion I know this I don't use
[13:51.680 --> 13:55.240]  illegal drugs but when I quit smoking I've had a long battle with that I feel
[13:55.240 --> 13:58.920]  horrible for a week and about a week later my wife says please just go back
[13:58.920 --> 14:03.120]  to smoking sometimes because I get so manic and I think we have a similar
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.080]  physiology a lot of people have that physiology he was not giving it up at
[14:07.080 --> 14:10.400]  that point he was on the drugs and booze oh you're talking about the last few
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.960]  months underlying here that people are missing as a friend I just think that he's
[14:14.960 --> 14:18.320]  somebody going through a hard time who got clean and that's why I went out to
[14:18.320 --> 14:22.600]  California to help him and I know that it's wrong for them to be prodding him
[14:22.600 --> 14:26.440]  yes and demonizing him and trying to make him blow up that's actually what I
[14:26.440 --> 14:29.760]  believe is going on here they should all just shake hands bury the hatchet come
[14:29.760 --> 14:34.640]  together for the crew of two and a half men I want and try to support Charlie but
[14:34.640 --> 14:39.800]  also Chuck Laurie everybody else but but understand what happened okay but
[14:39.800 --> 14:42.680]  Charlie's tired of being held up like the devil we got the TSA putting their
[14:42.680 --> 14:46.560]  hand down people's pants info wars.com covers it all we've got the banks
[14:46.560 --> 14:49.600]  bankrupting the US wait wait wait we're sticking with let's stick with Charlie
[14:49.600 --> 14:56.440]  because that's way too much for me Charlie is man I understand that he did still 23.7 trillion
[14:56.440 --> 15:01.200]  but we're just here to figure out what is happening with Charlie that's what
[15:01.200 --> 15:04.720]  we're trying to figure out and he has he's doing interviews now so he has a
[15:04.720 --> 15:08.880]  chance to speak for himself and he is going to take out a contest they are not there
[15:08.880 --> 15:12.040]  and you don't know you haven't seen them. Oh they've been comparing him to Gaddafi.
[15:12.040 --> 15:15.360]  Look I was just saying I don't think I haven't heard him. Let's compare George Bush a million
[15:15.360 --> 15:28.880]  out of Iraqis. I think we were here to talk about Charlie. I'm not trying to cut you off.
[15:28.880 --> 15:35.600]  Charlie says you have a right to Kelly but not to judge him. Thank you. You are a wonderful friend.
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.400]  Charlie stay clean we love you and everybody else out there stay clean
[15:40.400 --> 15:51.840]  don't use drugs infowars.com. Infowars.com. Okay that is Alex Jones using the media tool for what

[16:03.920 --> 16:10.080]  got all these people trapped in that false world of celebrity news you know petty issues
[16:10.080 --> 16:16.560]  of who's dating who and who went where and Alex directly took it on and tried to interject
[16:16.560 --> 16:23.600]  to bring people back to the real issues torture secret arrest he mentioned that over a million
[16:23.600 --> 16:30.640]  dead Iraqis he mentioned that building seven was collapsed he mentioned how tsa sticking their hands
[16:30.640 --> 16:36.560]  down his people's pants he's mentioned how over 23.7 trillion dollars have been looted and stolen
[16:36.560 --> 16:43.520]  through this whole derivative scam he and he mentioned how Charlie is being compared with
[16:43.520 --> 16:49.200]  Gaddafi and here we have petty celebrity issues and you know we don't know what's going on with
[16:49.200 --> 16:54.640]  Charlie Sheen but we wish him well it's his personal life and then we have real issues going on in
[16:54.640 --> 17:01.440]  the world Gaddafi and the rest of it and somehow Charlie is supposed to be of equal weight but
[17:01.440 --> 17:06.480]  that's just the cycle of celebrity news that's the way it goes but I thought Alex did an amazing
[17:06.480 --> 17:12.880]  job of really trying to bring people back around to what's really important in this world albeit
[17:12.880 --> 17:17.920]  on a celebrity show that covers these kind of topics day in and day out but you have seen the
[17:17.920 --> 17:24.240]  view cover other substantial topics and Rosie O'Donnell really put herself on the line and use
[17:24.240 --> 17:31.280]  that platform to cover a lot of 9 11 truth issues and now Alex live on the show is using it to cover
[17:31.280 --> 17:39.280]  9 11 and other issues really and they you know they didn't want to talk about the Bush issues how
[17:39.280 --> 17:47.440]  how controversial it is that Bush just blatantly lied about WMD's invaded Iraq without a real
[17:47.440 --> 17:54.720]  pretext why we're still in Afghanistan after almost a decade why Obama who supposedly is supposed
[17:54.720 --> 18:00.400]  to be ending these wars is just expanding them and you know now we see everything going on in
[18:00.400 --> 18:06.480]  northern Africa it's just an expansion of the mid-east tension that's been going on
[18:06.480 --> 18:12.640]  and so how refreshing for a bunch of housewives to see questions they may not even be familiar
[18:12.640 --> 18:17.760]  with what is he talking about a million dead Iraqis they never reported that on the mainstream news
[18:17.760 --> 18:23.920]  certainly building seven has been little reported except in the alternative news it's very interesting
[18:23.920 --> 18:30.720]  last week we just saw man cows or heard about man cows interview with Donald Rumsfeld said he had
[18:30.720 --> 18:36.080]  never heard about building seven certainly a blatant lie but at least he's being asked these
[18:36.080 --> 18:41.840]  questions just before that he had been asked at the CPAC conference what happened to those missing
[18:41.840 --> 18:48.640]  2.3 trillion dollars the Pentagon admitted it couldn't account for Rumsfeld just lied again and said
[18:48.640 --> 18:54.480]  well that was always there the point is we see these questions still being raised after
[18:54.480 --> 19:00.400]  after the Bush administration has faded away as they're trying to rebrand themselves even so
[19:02.560 --> 19:10.800]  we see that those things are not forgotten anyway being what it is the view I think Alex had an
[19:10.800 --> 19:15.680]  excellent job I'm sure he'll be calling in as soon as he can to tell us what happened behind the
[19:15.680 --> 19:22.160]  scenes and what he thought what happened but you saw Barbara Walters and Whoopi Goldberg didn't really
[19:22.160 --> 19:26.480]  want to talk about the things Alex brought up they just wanted to get back to the Charlie Sheen
[19:26.480 --> 19:33.680]  issues and that is what it is but we need to bring up these other issues as well now when we get back
[19:33.680 --> 19:39.760]  we are going to get into the Middle East and we'll be hearing from Alex soon I'm Aaron Dykes for
[19:39.760 --> 19:47.200]  Infowars Alex will be back tomorrow and we'll be back in just a couple minutes

[24:05.920 --> 24:28.800]  we are back at info wars dot com i am erin dykes filling in for alex jones and as we just heard
[24:28.800 --> 24:34.960]  he was in new york on abc's the view talking to more than 30 million viewers uh really about
[24:34.960 --> 24:41.120]  the charlie sheen uh celebrity business but he interjected as many real issues as he could
[24:41.120 --> 24:47.040]  including building seven uh the death toll in iraq and more and the only other thing i want to
[24:47.040 --> 24:53.280]  say about charlie sheen is he's been fighting this 9-11 issue really for almost five years publicly
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.880]  it was in march 2006 when i started here at info wars uh almost five years ago to the day uh tomorrow
[25:00.880 --> 25:06.880]  will be and it was only a couple weeks after that that charlie came on uh and first went public for
[25:06.880 --> 25:13.120]  9-11 truth and ever since he put on the 9-11 conference in los angeles that was picked up
[25:13.120 --> 25:18.800]  by c-span and reached millions and then a couple years after that he came out with his 20 minutes
[25:18.800 --> 25:24.880]  to the president a really strong and bold challenge to president obama to address the
[25:24.880 --> 25:32.400]  outstanding questions on 9-11 to not be the warmonger uh that he was apparently uh fitted in the
[25:32.400 --> 25:37.920]  suit to be to expand these wars in the middle east uh sheen really laid down the gauntlet and asked
[25:37.920 --> 25:43.360]  some real questions that are a lot bigger uh than his personal life uh we wish him well whatever he's
[25:43.360 --> 25:49.440]  evolved in uh really is his personal business uh but here we have alex uh taking kind of the
[25:49.440 --> 25:56.240]  celebrity culture and milking it uh to try to get people back into mainstream issues and so if
[25:56.240 --> 26:01.680]  sheen has launched that again for us and brought more viewers to us uh to cover real topics because
[26:01.680 --> 26:08.160]  of his celebrity uh scandals and what's going on with his tv show uh that could be good for us in
[26:08.160 --> 26:15.360]  a way but moving on to more uh directly substantial news we really see commodities oil uh everything
[26:15.360 --> 26:21.120]  else is flaring up because of the tensions in the middle east and adding to that tension is the fact
[26:21.120 --> 26:27.600]  that egypt is banning gold exports the miners say they will not be affected we have a military
[26:27.600 --> 26:34.000]  dictatorship temporarily uh ruling in egypt until they uh potentially rewrite the constitution
[26:34.000 --> 26:40.480]  and until they have elections what they say probably will be four months uh it could be a lot longer
[26:40.480 --> 26:45.920]  but for the time being we have egypt on sunday banned the export of gold for the next four months
[26:45.920 --> 26:51.760]  a measure bankers said seemed aimed at preventing businessmen and former government officials who
[26:51.760 --> 26:56.720]  acquired capital illegally from transferring it abroad an official from a gold mine in egypt
[26:56.720 --> 27:02.160]  says he was confident it was not aimed at gold production but at individual exports a decree
[27:02.160 --> 27:06.720]  banning the export of gold in all its forms including jewelry and ornaments was issued by
[27:06.720 --> 27:13.120]  newly appointed trade minister samira sayid it will take effect immediately uh so they say it's
[27:13.120 --> 27:19.520]  targeted individuals uh i guess in theory to stop looting uh but i would only imagine it puts a
[27:19.520 --> 27:26.400]  little bit of pressure on the gold market and that is egypt bans gold exports uh in another area of
[27:26.400 --> 27:32.960]  news we have this whole thing where homeland security now thinks it could take your dna in
[27:32.960 --> 27:40.640]  the name of stopping human trafficking and uh illegal trade of various kinds they say dna
[27:40.640 --> 27:46.640]  genetic pat down will be introduced to airports by dhs of course it's going to be targeted at
[27:46.640 --> 27:52.320]  foreigners and immigrants first uh but we know better it's going to come around to affect almost
[27:52.320 --> 27:59.760]  everyone uh already the measures at the airport are far too invasive uh but the protest really
[27:59.760 --> 28:04.960]  will only expand into greater technology interesting how that works that when people
[28:04.960 --> 28:10.160]  say no they don't want to be patted down they don't want to go through an x-ray body scanner
[28:10.160 --> 28:15.520]  they don't think that there's a reason to violate the fourth amendment uh just to fly on a plane
[28:17.040 --> 28:22.880]  here we see even though they're standing down currently at airports even at lax and really
[28:22.880 --> 28:28.720]  big airports across the country they are mainly not doing pat downs because of all the uh backlash
[28:28.720 --> 28:34.240]  of public um lack of public support but yet they're rolling out these other measures here we
[28:34.240 --> 28:40.400]  have dna genetic pat down introduced by airports by dhs a new level of invasive screening is
[28:40.400 --> 28:47.520]  scheduled for airports this summer a portable dna scanner to conduct on-site real-time genetic
[28:47.520 --> 28:53.760]  testing real-time genetic testing this technology is being implemented under the cover of combating
[28:53.760 --> 29:00.960]  human trafficking illegal immigration and finding missing persons but richard selden of net bio
[29:00.960 --> 29:06.800]  creator of the scanners clearly states that dna information has the potential part of the fabric
[29:06.800 --> 29:13.280]  of day-to-day life uh so first they have x-ray body scanners that they claim they don't save the image
[29:13.280 --> 29:18.480]  they claim they can't see your naked genitalia all lies and now they're going to take actual
[29:18.480 --> 29:25.440]  dna samples uh this is an activist post reading we also have a mike adams natural news and i see
[29:25.440 --> 29:31.200]  we're coming up on that break so we'll just continue on the other side but how dare tsa how dare
[29:31.200 --> 29:38.320]  homeland security first try to cop a field and then try to get your actual dna how dangerous is
[29:38.320 --> 29:43.040]  this technology going to become we're going to talk about some of those questions on the other side
[29:43.040 --> 29:51.520]  i'm erin dykes info wars dot com prison planet dot tv we will be back after the break we're on the

[32:07.040 --> 32:12.240]  to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[32:12.240 --> 32:18.000]  underneath the americans at home i've termed members influence on our president in congress
[32:18.000 --> 32:24.160]  and they really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens
[32:24.160 --> 32:29.680]  to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore
[32:29.680 --> 32:35.200]  cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[32:35.200 --> 32:40.320]  tem geithner bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying
[32:40.320 --> 32:45.440]  who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[32:45.440 --> 32:53.360]  we have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of full of the republic on dvd at info wars dot
[32:53.360 --> 33:09.360]  com we're watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot tv
[33:09.360 --> 33:11.360]  oh
[33:22.880 --> 33:28.080]  the pleas and odors have the point that's the point upon me i really like that movie a brother
[33:28.080 --> 33:34.480]  where though we are back at info wars dot com i am erin dykes that intro music is from oh brother
[33:34.480 --> 33:39.600]  where though we're going to be joined by alex and just about 10 or 15 minutes he's going to
[33:39.600 --> 33:44.960]  break down his appearance on the view and who knows whatever you saw backstage i don't know
[33:44.960 --> 33:50.400]  if he got a chance to talk with the talent uh but he was just on with over 30 million viewers
[33:50.400 --> 33:55.840]  and i'm on with probably a fraction of that but we are still reaching millions around the world
[33:55.840 --> 34:02.720]  and having a big impact some breaking news from the new york times february 28th obama said to ease
[34:02.720 --> 34:08.720]  health law requirements seeking to appease disgruntled governors obama plans to announce on
[34:08.720 --> 34:14.960]  monday he supports amending the 210 health care law to allow states to opt out of its most burdensome
[34:14.960 --> 34:19.840]  requirements three years earlier than currently permitted senior administration officials said
[34:19.840 --> 34:25.120]  obama would reveal to the national governor's association in a speech on monday morning
[34:25.120 --> 34:29.840]  that he backs the legislation that would enable states to request federal permission to withdraw
[34:29.840 --> 34:38.320]  from the law's mandates in 2014 rather than 2017 uh so whatever happens in the grander scheme we
[34:38.320 --> 34:44.640]  definitely see there's a great deal of opposition to the health care law uh alaska among others has
[34:44.640 --> 34:50.320]  said just outright no we're not going to implement this and right now most of the governors are in
[34:50.320 --> 34:56.480]  washington dc meeting with obama and obviously the health care stuff is at the top of the list
[34:56.480 --> 35:02.560]  and he is at least not only caved on certain issues we will see how things play out down the road
[35:03.280 --> 35:13.600]  but back in this other issue we have dhs and tsa looking to bring a dna swab a dna test a live
[35:14.160 --> 35:22.640]  full dna scan at the airport uh if you fall at least at first under the foreigner emigrants uh
[35:22.640 --> 35:27.840]  we don't know your background your unverified kind of status uh but how quickly is that going to
[35:27.840 --> 35:32.880]  branch out into everyone we're going to see uh because we know there's so much more going on
[35:32.880 --> 35:41.520]  with dna uh let's check out natural news mike adams after touching your junk the tsa wants to scan
[35:41.520 --> 35:47.520]  and harvest your dna as if it's not enough for the tsa to fill you up with the airport they are now
[35:47.520 --> 35:53.920]  experimenting with rapid results dna scanners that can scan and analyze your dna using just a drop of
[35:53.920 --> 36:00.000]  saliva just a drop spit at the tsa agent who is molesting you in other words and they can use that
[36:00.000 --> 36:06.080]  saliva to scan your dna and then store it in a government database why would they want to do
[36:06.080 --> 36:11.280]  that we can only imagine remember it was alex jones who broke the story about hospitals secretly
[36:11.280 --> 36:16.640]  taking blood samples of babies handing them over to the federal government for use a national genetic
[36:16.640 --> 36:22.640]  database the government routinely steals genetic material for people for its own nefarious purposes
[36:22.640 --> 36:28.080]  and as does the pharmaceutical industry for example the medical industry so-called
[36:28.080 --> 36:32.320]  healer cells which have been exploited for decades by vaccine and drug companies were harvested
[36:32.320 --> 36:37.600]  and stolen decades ago without permission or consent it's never without permission or consent
[36:37.600 --> 36:45.040]  and we know it's not benign we know there's been a national dna uh registry database going on for
[36:45.040 --> 36:53.280]  almost 40 years i believe and what what they're doing with that dna is unfathomable in some ways
[36:53.280 --> 37:00.240]  we know the eugenicist will be using it for race specific bio weapons they'll be using it sure for
[37:00.240 --> 37:05.440]  a little bit of ancestry and where did you come from and who are your forebears but they will
[37:05.440 --> 37:11.520]  also be using it in the military industrial complex to build very specific very high-tech weapons
[37:11.520 --> 37:18.320]  and that is all scary enough uh back in the activist post the current focus on dna extraction
[37:18.320 --> 37:24.160]  and databaseing is a well known globalist initiative stated by the un to register every
[37:24.160 --> 37:30.000]  newborn this initiative has the full support of globalist and population control advocates bill
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.840]  gates of course who would like to see a universal birth registry that would presumably tie in to
[37:35.840 --> 37:41.040]  his universal vaccine program additionally globalist behemoths such as the ran corporation
[37:41.040 --> 37:46.960]  have issued documents that identify an interest in biotechnology for the purpose of population
[37:46.960 --> 37:53.920]  reduction cloning to identify understand manipulate improve and control living organisms uh that's
[37:53.920 --> 37:59.520]  right uh when they build vaccines it would be very useful to have a large sample of dna and
[37:59.520 --> 38:05.200]  where are they going to get it uh hospitals of course would be first but now the idea that they
[38:05.200 --> 38:11.920]  would be taking it from an airport test it's it's difficult to deal with because it's such a
[38:11.920 --> 38:18.160]  violation of the fourth amendment it's such a gross continuation of really quickly rapidly
[38:18.160 --> 38:25.680]  expanding power um homeland security existed prior to uh 2001 911 attacks but it didn't gain
[38:25.680 --> 38:32.640]  power until the patriot act and since that time we've just seen a crazy power grab you know first
[38:32.640 --> 38:37.520]  you got to take off your shoes first they got to scan your luggage then you got to go through an x-ray
[38:37.520 --> 38:43.840]  machine then you have to get patted down have your genitalia touched and now it's going to come to
[38:43.840 --> 38:50.240]  a genetic pat down a dna test and they say they can do it in under an hour and it'll be very cheap
[38:50.240 --> 38:55.440]  only a hundred bucks so i'm sure that's all the more reason uh that lots of people will have to
[38:55.440 --> 39:02.400]  put up with that and it's just sickening um but the far bigger news is definitely going on
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.840]  in the middle east and alex will be joining us momentarily but until that time i wanted to read
[39:07.840 --> 39:15.920]  part of paul joseph watson's obama's humanitarian conquest of libya and this is all about how they're
[39:15.920 --> 39:21.920]  going to use these crises uh to gain greater control in the region the middle east and northern africa
[39:21.920 --> 39:28.480]  it's really all along uh what they call an arc of crisis all the way from eastern europe uh down
[39:28.480 --> 39:34.320]  through north africa through the middle east uh over into eastern asia and it just kind of wraps
[39:34.320 --> 39:40.960]  around crescent shape uh conveniently encircling russia uh putting china on the spot it's really
[39:40.960 --> 39:48.240]  been part of the stratagem since pre-world war two uh spickman or spikeman uh developed the
[39:48.240 --> 39:54.320]  coin the term rimland uh but today you would probably recognize it as zabignu brzezinski's
[39:54.320 --> 40:01.040]  grand chessboard and here on the microcosm to do with libya we see you know gadoffy has really
[40:01.040 --> 40:06.000]  kicked in his heels he's standing his ground uh while the rebels in the east have really gained
[40:06.000 --> 40:12.480]  steam um we have before president barack obama even took office we warned that his administration
[40:12.480 --> 40:18.400]  would continue to follow the bush era policy of bankrupting both america both financially and
[40:18.400 --> 40:23.840]  morally with new wars but that these conquests would be done in the name of humanitarian crisis
[40:23.840 --> 40:28.480]  rather than a preemptive assault because that's the whole democrats thing the the republicans
[40:28.480 --> 40:34.960]  always go in strong arm uh using the straightforward tactics preemptive war uh but the democrats
[40:34.960 --> 40:39.520]  are just as warlike they've continued all these things for all these decades but they prefer to
[40:39.520 --> 40:46.720]  go in in a Balkan style as the as the overseers the globalist uh friendlies if you will just
[40:46.720 --> 40:53.280]  overseeing the splits and the regional divides um truly and in just the most direct fashion using
[40:53.280 --> 41:00.000]  divide and conquer to take over the region we see that paul watson writes the international crisis
[41:00.000 --> 41:05.280]  that vice president joe biden warned obama would face has now arrived with the increasingly
[41:05.280 --> 41:11.040]  chaotic situation in libya forging a pretext for military intervention on behalf of the united
[41:11.040 --> 41:17.360]  states nato and the united nations the prevalence of u.s military industrial complex even under a
[41:17.360 --> 41:22.960]  government that promised peace was guaranteed all along under a democratic administration wars
[41:22.960 --> 41:28.400]  remain the health of the state only the rhetoric behind their justification is different by citing
[41:28.400 --> 41:34.400]  humanitarian concerns as a pretext the obama administration could send us troops into battle
[41:34.400 --> 41:39.440]  safe in the knowledge that they can rely on left cover the vitriol that accompany bushes foreign
[41:39.440 --> 41:45.920]  adventures will be non-existent and we will really see if the anti-war left steps up to the challenge
[41:45.920 --> 41:53.520]  and denounces uh this intervention in libya we have a companion to that article kurt nimo libyans
[41:53.520 --> 42:00.480]  no thanks to globalist intervention so even the rebels dealing with gadoffy do not want the united
[42:00.480 --> 42:07.120]  nations do not want nato do not want secretary clinton in their country telling them how to operate
[42:07.120 --> 42:14.240]  things but then it goes back i i went to the bill de berg conference in 2006 and 2008 protesting
[42:14.240 --> 42:20.960]  uh with alex jones meeting with jim tucker who has been following this for uh what seems like
[42:20.960 --> 42:25.600]  millennia something like 30 years the bill de berg group and he's really tracked how the
[42:25.600 --> 42:31.280]  balkan war was something they liked because it was low-key and there were very few critics very
[42:31.280 --> 42:37.440]  few watchful eyes seeing what's going on as they divided the former ugoslavian region into all
[42:37.440 --> 42:44.640]  the smaller countries we see croatia is protesting even today but they really liked the humanitarian
[42:45.360 --> 42:50.320]  intervention causes in that area and they're going to use it again in the middle east
[42:50.320 --> 42:55.440]  because it's a lot of mental energy it's a lot of sure they have good things when they go in
[42:55.440 --> 43:01.840]  strong for the iraq war the afghanistan war but they do have to have a pretext and simply put
[43:01.840 --> 43:07.040]  humanitarian is one of the easiest cells for them but they really like how it doesn't draw as much
[43:07.040 --> 43:12.640]  criticism but war is war and obama was supposed to bring our troops back from the region and he's
[43:12.640 --> 43:19.360]  brought back a token amount from iraq more contractors went in uh but we really see now how he's
[43:19.360 --> 43:25.360]  expanding a wider regional war we can only hope it doesn't involve iran although we know they've
[43:25.360 --> 43:30.560]  been eyeing them all along we can only hope uh something like a world war three doesn't come up
[43:30.560 --> 43:37.120]  from this uh more from curt nemo's article following secretary of state clinton's call for intervention
[43:37.120 --> 43:42.480]  a rebel leader in libya has stated his country does not want or need any help from the united
[43:42.480 --> 43:49.120]  states and its globalist partners hafi's goga a spokesman for the newly formed national libyan
[43:49.120 --> 43:54.800]  council in the rebel controlled eastern city of ben gazi said foreign intervention would not be
[43:54.800 --> 44:00.800]  welcome the daily caller reports the rest of libya will be liberated by the people and get off
[44:00.800 --> 44:06.880]  east security forces will be eliminated by the people of libya uh now all this stuff is happening
[44:06.880 --> 44:13.120]  while there's over 100 000 what they're calling refugees which feeds right into the humanitarian
[44:13.760 --> 44:19.920]  pretext we have something on the order of 55 000 trying to head back to egypt on the right
[44:19.920 --> 44:27.200]  uh another part of that balance headed to tunisia the smaller country to the left of libya it really
[44:27.200 --> 44:33.040]  is interesting how those three countries flared up in a very regional context all having protests
[44:33.040 --> 44:40.080]  at the same time uh we also see there's protest in oman uh really just all over the place they're
[44:40.080 --> 44:48.720]  reporting that oman protest will not stop the oil flow at least not yet uh but we're going to see a
[44:48.720 --> 44:55.680]  lot of pressure on those kind of things coming up in the future more on the egypt situation behind
[44:55.680 --> 45:01.520]  the scenes of egypt's revolution i'm not sure i can pronounce this name it's out of the hurry at
[45:01.520 --> 45:10.160]  daily news that's turkey and they really call out some of the geo strategic motives behind the egypt
[45:10.160 --> 45:19.600]  revolution and skipping down a few paragraphs they really talk about how following the breakup
[45:19.600 --> 45:25.360]  of the soviet empire the proliferation of color revolutions throughout former communist countries
[45:25.360 --> 45:31.680]  also appeared simultaneously spontaneous and driven by the popular will however in hindsight
[45:31.680 --> 45:37.040]  it has come to light that this or that their organization in planning was funded by the west
[45:37.040 --> 45:41.440]  so all the things you saw happening after the fall of the soviet empire that seemed spontaneous
[45:42.400 --> 45:48.880]  in hindsight weren't on a spontaneous will that be the case uh with egypt with libya with tunisia
[45:48.880 --> 45:53.760]  with the rest of them uh we'll see but i think there's a good case for it uh they go on to say
[45:53.760 --> 45:59.920]  rather than spontaneous and popular nowadays these revolutions have often been called orchestrated
[45:59.920 --> 46:06.320]  the people of ukraine georgia kyrgyzstan were all manipulated by us intelligence agencies and
[46:06.320 --> 46:12.240]  ngos like the freedom house and the albert einstein institute to overthrow their russian
[46:12.240 --> 46:18.160]  leadership and we know the same freedom house the same albert einstein institute uh the same pro
[46:18.160 --> 46:24.240]  western pro democracy demonstrations the thing that happened at columbia university uh we all
[46:24.240 --> 46:29.840]  know they're part of this online twitter generation revolution that's happening in the middle east
[46:29.840 --> 46:35.280]  so what's this about the recent events in egypt is the middle east now being remade in the shadow
[46:35.280 --> 46:42.240]  of ze big new brzezinski's arc of crisis in this context gene sharp and the albert einstein institute
[46:42.240 --> 46:48.080]  appear crucial sharp also known as the monkey valley of nonviolence or the clous witz of
[46:48.080 --> 46:53.520]  nonviolent warfare has written a great many books on civilian based defense and democracy
[46:53.520 --> 46:58.720]  that could serve as blueprints from popular uprisings against authoritarian regimes onto the on
[46:58.720 --> 47:05.120]  the institute's website many books such as from dictatorship to democracy are available uh so
[47:05.120 --> 47:13.760]  they just go into how the ngos are really working for nato and western interest and in particular
[47:13.760 --> 47:20.720]  how wiki leaks revealed that the us had been trying to topple the egyptian president for more than
[47:20.720 --> 47:29.200]  three years and so that stuff is just shocking and we also see egypt aims to alter the voting rules
[47:29.200 --> 47:35.760]  so while it's under military dictatorship they are going to rewrite the constitution they have
[47:35.760 --> 47:40.480]  a committee set up but there's a lot of critics of that committee who are not happy with the way
[47:40.480 --> 47:44.880]  it's been set up and don't think the reforms are going to go deep enough so we have this great
[47:44.880 --> 47:50.800]  revolution happening and people are wondering if a so-called democracy can be the result
[47:50.800 --> 47:59.120]  we'll certainly see but it's you know tenuous at best i i read what uh charles crowd hammer
[47:59.120 --> 48:03.440]  had written i don't agree with much of what he says but he's right in saying that everyone
[48:03.440 --> 48:09.760]  has a right to be happy after the first few days of the revolution but this isn't 1789 this isn't
[48:09.760 --> 48:15.200]  the french revolution anymore and we're a lot wiser to some of the tricks that can happen after
[48:15.200 --> 48:22.800]  the fact after the cause for celebration we see egypt uprising repudiates al-qaeda so says john
[48:22.800 --> 48:31.600]  mccain john mccain and none other than lieberman are visiting the area and trying to influence
[48:31.600 --> 48:38.400]  egypt after the toppling of hazneen mubarak this revolution is a repudiation of al-qaeda
[48:38.400 --> 48:44.640]  senator john mccain an arizona republican said after talks with arab league chief amir musa
[48:44.640 --> 48:48.480]  this revolution has shown the people of the world not just in the arab world that peaceful
[48:48.480 --> 48:53.040]  change can come about from the violence and extremism that is not required in order to
[48:53.040 --> 48:58.960]  achieve democracy and freedom so you're going to have democracy not just at the barrel of a gun
[48:58.960 --> 49:07.520]  but at the barrel of a humanitarian aid at the barrel of senator mccain lieberman and clinton's
[49:07.520 --> 49:13.120]  design before the revolution they said it was thought there were only two choices on the one
[49:13.120 --> 49:18.320]  hand a secular dictatorship on the other hand a fear of religious extremist dictatorship
[49:18.320 --> 49:24.640]  lieberman said there is a third way that egypt has shown the world that it's a peaceful democratic
[49:24.640 --> 49:29.920]  future and that it's inclusive of the widest range of people uh that certainly is very hopeful
[49:29.920 --> 49:37.440]  but whether or not it's realistic uh we will see in due time we have farrakhan uh saying that the
[49:37.440 --> 49:44.640]  middle east uprisings will come to the us and he has called upon president obama to allow protesters
[49:44.640 --> 49:50.000]  to march urging the president not to attack innocent people uh i don't know if that's that
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.280]  extreme i don't you know it comes off almost as a joke uh because you wouldn't expect obama to
[49:55.280 --> 50:01.120]  fire on protesters but there in wisconsin we do see the national guard being mobilized uh to
[50:01.120 --> 50:06.560]  potentially be used against protesters and if obama would do the same if things spread to a
[50:06.560 --> 50:12.800]  more national protest we would really see what happens uh farrakhan the nation of islam leader
[50:13.520 --> 50:19.360]  predicted on sunday that america faces imminent uprisings that mirror those of the middle east
[50:19.360 --> 50:27.600]  what you are looking at intonesia in egypt in libya and Bahrain will uh what you see happening there
[50:28.240 --> 50:33.120]  you'd better prepare because it will be coming to your door farrakhan said in a booming voice
[50:33.120 --> 50:40.560]  thousands of followers cheering in his wake farrakhan again asked obama to allow protesters to march
[50:40.560 --> 50:45.760]  urging the president not to attack innocent people and that is what they do in in foreign
[50:45.760 --> 50:50.640]  countries and we only hope it doesn't come to the us but we can see the flare point is coming
[50:51.280 --> 50:56.880]  and we will be back after this break alex jones will be joining us shortly i don't know his exact

[54:48.160 --> 54:52.560]  we have old friend Tony Blair who had a close relationship with Gaddafi
[54:52.560 --> 54:58.400]  now telling him to stop killing Libyan protesters and so all the world is really saying
[54:59.680 --> 55:04.400]  you know you're no good Gaddafi even though the things our countries our country does
[55:04.960 --> 55:11.920]  that the globalist do are far worse or on the same scale of course firing on protesters is
[55:11.920 --> 55:18.480]  abhorrent and in no way defensible but then again Gaddafi's one of these leaders he's now the longest
[55:18.480 --> 55:26.320]  serving current non-royal leader and there's so many dictators in Africa I have the list somewhere
[55:26.320 --> 55:34.160]  here he's on his 41st year and I believe there are I'm not sure how many other but I've got my
[55:34.160 --> 55:43.520]  list here Gaddafi 41 years 180 days he's the number one for non-royal leaders longest serving
[55:43.520 --> 55:55.280]  Cameroon Paul Bia 35 years Ali Abdul Sala in North Yemen 32 years Equatorial Guinea the leader's
[55:55.280 --> 56:04.240]  name is Mbassogo he's been in there for 31 years Jose Eduardo de los Santos in Angola for 31 years
[56:04.240 --> 56:12.960]  Mugabe in Zimbabwe 30 years Iranian the supreme leader in Iran anyway has been in there 29 years
[56:12.960 --> 56:23.680]  Ali Khomeini Cambodia's leader has been in there 26 years Uganda 26 years Burkina Faso for 23 years
[56:23.680 --> 56:30.160]  of course not all in Africa but quite a few of them in Africa so there is an issue with dictators
[56:30.160 --> 56:36.000]  and so-called presidents overstaying their welcome and of course on the surface it would be nice
[56:36.000 --> 56:42.880]  if countries like Egypt did take on constitutional amendments two term limits eight year total
[56:42.880 --> 56:48.400]  very US style of course that's good on the surface but the important thing is who's manipulating the
[56:48.400 --> 56:55.920]  strings behind the scenes and with McCain Clinton and the rest in the region that's of course very
[56:55.920 --> 57:04.000]  suspect and of course we see McCain and Lieberman are asking the US to fund the opposition in Libya
[57:04.000 --> 57:11.600]  to put arms and money in the hands of the anti Gaddafi leaders and Gaddafi is no one to love
[57:11.600 --> 57:17.280]  although he is very colorful but I think this whole funding the opposition has gotten to send
[57:17.280 --> 57:22.480]  a more trouble than it's worth particularly in the Middle East region the prime example would be
[57:22.480 --> 57:29.360]  Afghanistan the Taliban leaders the Mujahideen that Brzezinski funded back in the late 70s covertly
[57:30.320 --> 57:36.560]  so that they could resist the Russians and the Soviet Empire in its way would break down in the
[57:36.560 --> 57:43.200]  graveyard of empires in Afghanistan but it all comes around what goes around that is and it's
[57:43.200 --> 57:49.840]  our turn to falter in the Middle East in Afghanistan still after nearly a decade and now we're going
[57:49.840 --> 57:56.720]  to be funding more rebel leaders after just being criticized for backing Mubarak and funding him and
[57:56.720 --> 58:03.520]  giving him arms allowing him to dig in for over 30 years in Egypt now we want to fund more opposition
[58:03.520 --> 58:10.880]  leaders in Libya just to oust Gaddafi and meanwhile going in there under a humanitarian crisis I
[58:10.880 --> 58:16.240]  think it might be better to take a Ron Paul stature and just get our troops home let's let
[58:16.240 --> 58:22.000]  that region be let's be friends with them let's advise them and we shouldn't allow them to shoot
[58:22.000 --> 58:37.920]  protesters but let's be very careful and we'll be back after the break info wars.com

[58:48.960 --> 58:55.200]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[58:55.200 --> 58:59.520]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.520 --> 59:04.560]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[59:04.560 --> 59:10.160]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[59:10.160 --> 59:15.840]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[59:15.840 --> 59:20.960]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[59:20.960 --> 59:25.120]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[59:25.120 --> 59:29.840]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[59:29.840 --> 59:34.240]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions

[59:53.680 --> 59:58.880]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[59:58.880 --> 01:00:12.800]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:21.760]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:34.640]  i am not alex jones i'm erin dex and but i am filling in for alex and he should be popping in
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:40.000]  anytime now we don't know his schedule uh precisely up in new york he's just been on
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:47.280]  abc's the view reaching millions uh with sheen information but also a lot of very important
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:52.320]  globalist information about the takeover and the quest for royal government and of course that is
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:57.280]  what's going on as we look to the regional conflicts in the middle east uh current events
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:03.120]  unfolding every moment uh for the past several weeks it may not be immediately apparent to the
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:10.160]  average speculator excuse me to the average spectator however there is a quest for royal
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:15.920]  government and it's difficult to understand at first glance that they get more power they get
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:22.560]  more control from chaos and that is part of the motivation of what's going on as we see protest
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:30.160]  flare up uh why were they really western backed uh just like the stuff in former yugoslavia and
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:35.040]  other parts of the former soviet empire uh all these color revolutions that have happened since
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:41.840]  the fall of the soviet empire uh throughout the 90s um and especially right now really have all
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:47.200]  been western backed globalist backed bilterberg backed new world order backed uh but it doesn't
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:53.360]  make sense why would they foster chaos why would they back dictators but then back their ousters
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:02:02.320]  it's complicated but it really amounts to order out of chaos that is their creed um and through
[01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:06.800]  deception they will accomplish this and they will gain more power out of it that's what we have to
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:13.840]  watch for uh of course the big stories today are curt nimo libyans no thanks to globalist intervention
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:21.840]  even the rebel leaders in libya do not want the us nato and united nations forces to come in
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:27.840]  under a humanitarian uh guys or any other guys they want to deal with it themselves i think that's
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:38.000]  fine uh we see oman protests do not halt oil production shipments shipments of refined crude
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.240]  from oman's port of sohar are continuing a port spokesman said on monday after anti-government
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:50.400]  protests blocked roads leading to the key industrial area of gulf oil producer uh that is for now in
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:58.400]  oman uh we also have saudi activists i protest wait for new cabinet democracy activists in saudi
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:04.800]  arabia say the government is closely monitoring social media to nip in the bud any protest inspired
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:11.520]  by uprisings that swept americ arab countries toppling leaders in egypt and tunisia activists
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:18.480]  have set up facebook pages calling for protest on march 11 and 20 with over 17 000 supporters combined
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:24.640]  but police managed to stymie two attempts to stage protest in the red sea city of jeta last month
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:32.160]  highlighting difficulties of such mobilization in the conservative kingdom we have more on
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:38.800]  oman the protesters stage a third day of unrest uh they set a supermarket ablaze rallied at two
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:44.160]  places in the seaside town monday and a third consecutive day of unrest that has included
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:50.320]  deadly clashes in the strategic gulf nation kuwait a key opposition group calls for prime
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:56.400]  minister ouster a key kuwaiti opposition group on monday demanded the ouster of prime minister
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:03.040]  as youth activists called for a rally on march 8 to force the perimeter excuse me the primeer
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:08.240]  to quit the first step toward reforms is forming a new government under a new prime minister that
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:14.960]  should be capable of running the country and performing imbalances and we see in tunisia uh
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:20.320]  first the president left and now the interim president has named a new president and the
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:25.920]  prime minister has also stepped down with a new prime minister already named so everything is
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:33.520]  changing in the middle east uh but overall we can see it clearly is a regional uh tactic to divide
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:38.400]  and we're going to talk about that more with james corbett who's coming up after the break
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:44.400]  and alex jones will be popping in as well as we continue to look at the middle east what's
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:55.360]  happening and try to understand how they could divide and conquer
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:06.800]  a very wealthy us citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in

[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:35.600]  okay we are back on this monday february 28th 2011 my name is erin dykes i'm filling in for alex uh
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:42.160]  who incidentally will be popping in later in the hour uh but right now we go to james corbett
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:48.080]  who's an independent journalist who's been living and working in japan since 2004 uh you may have
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:53.920]  seen his website corbett report dot com he's been writing and producing the corbett report an
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:09:00.480]  independent listener supported alternative media and information source source since 2007 his
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:06.000]  forthcoming book reportage essays on the new world order will be available for purchase in early
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.240]  2011 and we're going to bring him up right now to get more into the middle east and what's going on
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:18.080]  with the new world order in general as he chronicles uh nearly all the same subjects we do and in
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:24.800]  great detail uh james are you there i am here and thank you so much for having me on it's an honor
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.200]  and a privilege to be here uh helping to drive the tip of the sphere even further into the heart
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.920]  of the new world order and it's so important right now as as you know as the globalists are
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.160]  upsetting the geopolitical grand chess board so that they can put the the pieces back on the
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:43.840]  board in their their own favor uh well thanks james it's an honor for me to be here too i'm
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.800]  filling in for rather big shoes but i'm doing the best i can what do you think is most important
[01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:55.840]  right now in the middle east as we see uh north africa uh the peninsula region and really that
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:03.920]  whole area just west of iraq all unfolding into uh crisis and the looming question will world
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:10.720]  worldwide rise and unrest uh you know culminate well it's a good question and uh it's one that
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.360]  that's absolutely vital for us to deal with right now because although i've seen some great
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.440]  coverage of this in the alternative media that seems to be casting a skeptical eye to what's
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.400]  going on unfortunately i don't see that filtering down to to a lot of the people that i that i see
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:30.960]  on a daily basis here and i it's unfortunate to me that there are so many people who are who are
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.320]  buying into this rather unquizzically just that they're toppling dictators in the middle east
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:40.800]  so everything's going to be a sunshine and rainbows and lollipops but of course we know that this is
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:47.520]  part of a a much much greater plan and a agenda that's unfolding right now and it seems to me that's
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:53.280]  to take a hansel and gretel analogy the the globalist controlled corporate and foundation funded
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:58.400]  media loves to create these these houses of candy for us out in the woods because we're lost and
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:02.720]  starving and and we've come across this house made of candy oh it looks so good let's let's go and
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:07.600]  eat it and we'll stay in it and this nice little lady comes and invites us in and of course she
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:11.360]  just wants to shove us into the oven and eat us and that and that's to me is the analogy of what's
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:15.760]  going on here of course they're going to create these these wonderful looking events that are going
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:21.280]  to be all about peace and democracy even as they're at the exact same time about bombing people you
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:27.920]  know in other countries exact continuation of the neocon agenda but most most people on the left
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:32.400]  side of the false left right paradigm won't really won't really catch on to that and and it's it's
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.040]  unfortunate to me because it seems there is a geopolitical grand chess board and it is being
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:41.760]  used to play this this great game and unfortunately the public is trapped playing checkers while the
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:46.400]  globalists are playing chess and if that's the case i mean we're going to lose every single time
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:50.640]  but it seems to me there is an elephant in the room here and it's a billion person elephant in
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.920]  the room and it's called china and i think that to me is what a lot of this is aimed at and and
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:01.680]  we can see it in country after country where this destabilization is happening from from yemen to
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:08.320]  egypt to libya and i've got some articles here that showcase what's going on pretty well it all
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:13.280]  news that's happening in very recent times that has to do with it with these countries and these
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:18.480]  dictators that are being toppled now of course all of these dictators are being propped up by
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.760]  the u.s. and with u.s. aid and have been in power because they have been serviceable puppets to the
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:28.960]  u.s. but the question is uh have they been the the greatest puppets and can better puppets be
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.520]  installed so if you take a look at the jamestown foundation for example they have an article
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:39.360]  burgeoning china yemen ties showcase beijing's middle east strategy and it it talks about how
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:46.160]  hujintow has just invited president ali abdulla slay over to china for an historic six day summit
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:51.360]  to talk about expanding ties between china and yemen and it says here china's stake in yemen
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:55.680]  however goes far beyond the energy and trade spheres beijing is determined to strengthen its
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:59.920]  role as an emerging political and diplomatic player in the middle east beijing's diplomatic
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:05.200]  and economic overtures to yemen provide a glimpse into china's grand strategy in the region and
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:09.360]  surprise surprise now ali abdulla slay is in trouble because people are trying to overthrow him
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.320]  you go to egypt you have moobarak who of course was propped up with us aid the second largest
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:19.680]  recipient of us aid so it was a u.s. serviceable puppet for the not the americans of course but
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.560]  the new world order that controls the american government and uh you go back to you can even
[01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:30.880]  go to the state information service sys.gov.eg and you can get a report moobarak china africa
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.000]  partnership to achieve peace development and it talks about a conference that was happening
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:42.640]  in 2009 moobarak hosted hujintow and chinese delegation as they're talking about expanded
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.520]  chinese african cooperation and then when you go to libya of course you're talking about oil
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.400]  and it's not so much that the new world order needs to control that oil for themselves it's
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:58.320]  that they need to stop it from from falling into the hands of the chinese because obviously china
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:03.120]  is the billion per person elephant in the room and it's consuming oil at a great rate so controlling
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:08.160]  oil china's oil reserves is extremely important important part of this game so you can go to
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:14.080]  the street dot com they have an article from the 24th of february of this year china oil company
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:18.960]  attacked in libya so you have these spontaneous protests of you know people who want to overthrow
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:24.240]  the dictator who are also attacking chinese oil companies so it seems to me in country after country
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:28.800]  there seems to be a certain direction that these are heading in and i'm not saying this is the only
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:34.480]  thing that this is about but i think that there is some some aspect of the geopolitical great game
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:39.360]  being played here well yeah and there's a lot of aspects because you have china also trying to
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:45.280]  squelch their own protests right now people trying to bring in i guess so-called democracy
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.480]  but that's really the problem it's brand democracy that we're trying to so-called export
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.520]  from our foreign policy uh the bush had rhetoric about it excuse me the bush administration had
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:01.360]  rhetoric about it obama's continuing that and we see that through these ngos that we know are on
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:06.240]  the playing field in the mid east and then we have all the revelations that lindsay williams
[01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:11.200]  brought to the program last year about how they want to stop the oil trade uh let these prices
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:17.120]  go up we've seen some uh skyrocketing already with the oil prices uh but as you pointed out it's
[01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:23.040]  really this geostrategic plan to to hold out for the end game we've got all this stuff in
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:29.120]  alaska we've got more energy uh there to last us probably for a millennia uh but as you say it's
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:34.640]  about challenging uh china's authority to that uh energy even as we have all our own domestic
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:40.320]  problems with china and the debt right exactly and and to a certain extent the the whole chinese
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:45.120]  thing is a smokescreen i mean we run the risk sometimes of being so close up to the to the
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:49.600]  painting that we're looking at each brushstroke as it happens so that we understand exactly how
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:54.080]  the painting is being painted but we have to take a couple steps back to see the bigger picture
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:59.280]  and see what's actually being painted and uh and in this case as well of course uh the the chinese
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:05.280]  american i i hate to even say american because of course it's the new world order the globalist
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:11.360]  control over the american government but um but the the the the tensions that are going on and the
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:15.920]  and the interplay is is to a certain extent a smokescreen because we know that the the chinese
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:20.960]  has have been built up by the new world order the very same new world order who has created the
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:25.280]  economic collapse that have created the destabilizations throughout this region and throughout
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:30.800]  europe as well so so it's all a a smokescreen at a certain level and we know that rockefeller
[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:35.280]  gave eulogies to chairman now in the new york times saying it was a great experiment that
[01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:40.320]  oh by the way just happened to kill 60 million of his own people conservatively or you have
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:47.360]  the clinton's back in the 90s of course bill clinton himself personally approving the transfer
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:52.880]  of nuclear advanced nuclear technologies to china uh you have all sorts of ways in which
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:56.960]  the the the new world order has been building up china and now you have soros going around
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:02.720]  saying china will be the engine of the new world order and he even uses that term i mean if people
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.080]  don't believe me just google it just youtube it is out there soros new world order he's talking
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:13.280]  about china being the the engine of the new system that they're they're working to bring about
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:18.240]  and of course it's soros and and brzezinski and people like that who are behind these types of
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:24.240]  color revolutions so so it's all one big circle that unfortunately is drawing us further and
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:30.480]  further into the globalist grasp grasp sure and you have back in the 70s uh with kissinger and
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:37.520]  the nixon era all their diplomacy in china was just about triangulating china to kind of pivot
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:44.000]  off of russia as they play for control in that region in the uh in the subcontinent region of
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.800]  asia and the middle east area uh can you comment more on the actual uh grand chess board and the
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:56.800]  whole arc of instability in that region we know the things brzezinski and kissinger and others
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:02.160]  have talked about uh where does china fit in in terms of playing that actual uh chess game
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:08.880]  well an excellent question and i think there is the the near term in the long term i think what
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:14.000]  we're seeing is the beginnings of a quiet at this stage it's quiet and behind the scenes
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:18.560]  but the beginnings of a type of cold war situation where i think it's going to be about
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:24.800]  trying to gobble up and grasp control of the various oil reserves and mineral reserves especially in
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:29.440]  in africa i think the the new world order controlled american government has been looking
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.920]  for a toehold in africa for a while now to try to keep the chinese out because it's uh
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:37.360]  there's a lot of uh resources especially in the north african region where all this
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:43.120]  destabilization is happening right now that china has been looking at and and attempting to acquire
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:47.760]  over the past couple of decades to feed their their growing industrial engine so i think that's
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:52.800]  what this stage of the game is about right now it's a very under the radar type of cold war
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:58.640]  scenario that's that's shaping up but i think the longer term what we're seeing is in the similar
[01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:03.360]  way to the cold war itself which to a certain extent was smoke screens because as we know the
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:09.520]  globalists were controlling and funding both sides of that that phony crisis as well in order to
[01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:15.360]  perpetuate a system where a there's a constant threat of outside intervention and force therefore
[01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:22.560]  there has to be the perpetual military industrial complex and then b at a greater extent when the
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.120]  the cold war really creates the the hegelian dialectic where you have two two forces playing
[01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:31.680]  off against each other and the result is a synthesis between the two so you see the the
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:38.080]  sovietization of america and the capitalization of of the of the soviet union block and that's
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.920]  the same thing they want to set up with china i think all right we have the music coming in but
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:46.640]  we're going to get more into the geostrategic game that's going on in the middle east and the other
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:57.440]  areas when we get back info wars dot com

[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:29.920]  okay we are back on this monday february 28th 2011 broadcast my name is erin dykes i'm filling
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:35.760]  in for alex who will be back tomorrow and he'll be on the show uh later in this hour right now
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:43.040]  we're on with james corbett of the corbett report dot com and uh before the break uh james raised a
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:49.440]  very interesting point uh paralleling this back to the cold war and i really think in many ways
[01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:55.440]  the cold war was not only against the soviet union uh but it was a classic a dialectical
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:02.480]  excuse to invade all kinds of parts of the third world countries uh you know most of the countries
[01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:10.320]  in latin america went through revolution coups or destabilizations in that cold war period uh many
[01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:16.080]  if not most of the countries in africa uh went through the same uh phase many of the countries
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:24.480]  in asia east asia all along the arc of crisis in particular all suffered um regime change
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:32.240]  and real pressure from both the west and the soviet sphere during the cold war and uh i don't you
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.640]  this isn't the time to make the argument that the soviets were propped up by the west and that
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:41.840]  they were kind of a paper tiger but more than anything it was an excuse to say well these
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:46.960]  are dictators in this part of the latin american world uh these are dictators in africa but they're
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:51.600]  pro-west so that makes them democratic and at least they're not communists or we have to
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:56.320]  invade this country or the domino effect is going to take over and we're going to see communism
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:03.440]  spread throughout the region that kind of dialectic really gives an easy excuse for the us and nato
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:11.440]  you know to go into these regions and today it's just as easy with the economic disaster with
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:18.400]  the humanitarian crisis agenda and uh so james corbett what do you think about that can we flush
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:23.520]  out some more of the cold war parallels well exactly right and it's important for people to
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:28.320]  understand that it's uh it's not just a dialectic it's a completely false dialectic it gives people
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:33.280]  a false choice so it might lead some people to think that that if i'm against the the
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.680]  the wave of protests and destabilization happening in the region that that means that i'm in favor
[01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:42.720]  of the the dictators or something along those lines of course that's not the case but it makes
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:47.360]  everyone choose sides in a phony game that's rigged from the beginning so that no matter which
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.720]  side you choose uh that you you're going to lose and and and that's unfortunately the way they often
[01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:57.680]  set these these types of things up because because they understand unfortunately that the majority of
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:02.000]  the public is playing checkers while they're playing chess and when that's the case we we're
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.800]  just going to lose every single time so so we have to be a bit smarter about this and and understand
[01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:11.760]  that uh when the the people in the three thousand dollar suits being being paid fifty million dollars
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.240]  a year with their ten thousand watt smiles get on camera and tell you how how wonderful everything
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:21.760]  in in this region is we know that they are being paid to say that because it it serves the the
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:26.080]  interest of the people who are paying them and it's a pretty simple point but it's one that a lot
[01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:31.200]  of people don't don't seem to take into account so um so this destabilization does help unfortunately
[01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:36.000]  the the globalist interests that are that are really in the long term only interested in in
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:40.960]  melding the entire thing into into one united world government which of course we we know is
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:46.960]  is the big end game of all of this so again it's it's not uh not in our interest to concentrate
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:51.440]  too much on the individual things that are happening without taking into account the
[01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:55.680]  bigger picture and i think that bigger picture is revealed in the institutional framework for
[01:27:55.680 --> 01:28:01.920]  world government which is being set up all around us and is already so deeply underway that that most
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:07.040]  people would would be shocked if they really started to take a look into it and and that
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:12.720]  institutional framework is of course brought in through the the governmental organizations the
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:16.960]  international governmental organizations that are governmental in all all but name from the
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.760]  imf to the un to the world trade organization and it's represented in things like that story
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:26.320]  about the tsa with the genetic screening and the genetic pat downs that of course relates back to
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:32.320]  the uh the newborn babies getting their blood taken at birth for uh dna databases going into a pentagon
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:37.920]  dna database uh that alex jones has been talking about for 15 years and and the uh the mainstream
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:42.640]  media is finally catching up to let people know about it and they're they're the perfect example
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:47.760]  of a system that's being instituted across the world at the exact same time in country after
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:53.680]  country and uh and it's being done by by secret agreement handshakes done behind closed doors
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:58.960]  that the public never sees about never hears about doesn't learn about uh for until 30 years after
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:04.640]  it's already started yeah that's right it's a coordinated continuity of agenda that was planned
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:10.560]  long ago implemented from the top at the united nations global level and implemented in the
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:16.320]  various countries and it's very interesting to me that with the worldwide economic crisis which was
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:21.920]  caused through globalism through all these countries being sinned together uh as if they
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:28.080]  were under the fascist emblem uh and how this is spread now we have the price of food is at the
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.960]  heart of the wave of these revolutions how will they use the economic crisis to cause further
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:46.080]  crisis more on that when we get back with james corbett i'm erin dykes this is info wars dot com

[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:09.360]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:14.400]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:20.000]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.120]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:30.400]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:35.040]  weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:40.400]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.800]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science

[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:25.760]  february 28 2011 broadcast i'm erin dykes filling in for alex jones he should be coming on
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:31.600]  at the end of this segment we have james corbert of the corbert report for one more segment a couple
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:38.640]  odds and ends here i just want to mention that the last world war one veteran has died frank buckles
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:45.760]  the last u.s world war one veteran has died a spokesman for the family said sunday he was 110
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:51.840]  definitely a milestone the last survivor of that globalist contrived war which has led us into the
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:57.760]  paradigm of global government for the 20th and 21st century well not only do we have protests
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:34:04.000]  throughout the middle east we have china uses whistles water and police on protesters that's
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:10.800]  in the ap we have made off bernie made off tells new york magazine government itself is a ponzi
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:18.000]  scheme and that brings us into how the globalists have used this economic crisis to fuel greater
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.960]  revolutions throughout the region that will only come back around on the u.s and other western
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:28.800]  nations including the price of food and the price of oil james corbert what are your takes on how
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:37.520]  they've used our worldwide economic crisis to fuel greater events well not just how they've used
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:42.160]  it but how they've constructed it exactly um that you can look back of course at the repealing of
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:48.800]  glass steagle and how that created the derivatives bubble which unfortunately now is it's just a
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:53.760]  mind-boggling number whatever it is however many quadrillion it is at this point it's it's more than
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:59.600]  all of the assets in the world combined so they have this giant derivatives bubble of it's totally
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:05.360]  imaginary wealth that they've created out of nothing which is now set to pop and deflate and
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:10.560]  the the final straw that breaks the back of the world economy and again this is something that has
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:15.920]  been envisioned and and thought about for a long time and again i would direct people back to carol
[01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:21.600]  quickly and writing about how the secret agreements reached with the bank of international settlements
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:27.920]  and its various arms the the central bank of central banks as it's referred to and how it's
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:33.760]  in through a series of secret agreements will come to dominate the world system a complete one
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:38.400]  world system of economic control and of course now we see it during the economic destabilization
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.600]  the imf coming up and saying oh hey well we've got the world currency that can bring stability
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:49.520]  back to the destabilized world order we can provide a new world order of a new world currency
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:54.800]  exactly as people have been talking about in the alternative media for decades and as
[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:59.680]  unfortunately reality is just catching up to yeah it's a real shame there's really no doubt
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:06.640]  that they are building china to be the next global government engine as the us winds down at the
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:14.640]  expense of the us as the us will be broken by these energy crises as they absorb all the
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:22.560]  remaining independent forces of economic as they take over everything it's it's just really frightening
[01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:30.720]  your thoughts corbett well i i i agree with that assessment it's unfortunate but it's true
[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:35.760]  it's an analogy that i've heard before that it's it's kind of like the elite globalists are these
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:40.800]  these parasites that'll go and lay their eggs in inside of a country and and hatch and infest
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:46.560]  that country and use it as an engine for itself to go out and spread and and propagate and then
[01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:51.760]  once that that host is is a carcass is a shell is starting to decay they'll just
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.800]  break out and fly over to some some other new host and invade that and and that's that seems
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:02.080]  to be exactly what's going on america was the the engine for for the new world order system to move
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:08.000]  the the the ball further down the field and now that uh now that america is being taken down by
[01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.320]  design the uh the chinese model is being brought in and of course we know the chinese model is all
[01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:18.560]  about mobile forced abortion vans and complete control and harvesting the organs of prisoners
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:23.440]  and all of this which was surprisingly enough they didn't talk about on uh the hujintao's
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:29.440]  recent state visit to america no no they put up chinese flags all all down the uh in in washington
[01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:34.960]  because he's uh just such a great uh wonderful leader just like malwas right but then going
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:40.080]  back to the middle east if this whole thing isn't globalist contrive somebody sure propped up the
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:46.560]  dominoes in a very convenient fashion uh so that all this stuff would trigger itself uh to all come
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:54.160]  to the surface at the same time uh going back to brzezinski and his plans for uh geo political
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:38:00.400]  domination of the grand chess board we have uh tony cartelucci wrote an article last week called
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:05.840]  the path to persia uh which basically deals with a lot of the stuff brzezinski has been planning
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:13.600]  for a couple years brzezinski and defense secretary robert gates wrote a paper in i believe the latter
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:22.080]  part of 2007 2008 uh really dealing with how iran would most not most likely not see a direct
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:27.200]  military intervention uh but really they would kind of circumvent through a secondary route
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:34.000]  really a lot of it dealing with these kind of popular uprisings and it just matches perfectly
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:40.480]  with this color revolution tactic the so-called twitter protest and they are happening in iran and
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:48.080]  we know iran is the key piece on that area in the geo uh excuse me on the chess board
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:54.080]  in terms of getting to that latter stage where china becomes superior and uh whatever happens
[01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:59.920]  in the u.s happens uh what do you think about the brzezinski path to persia right well it's
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:04.400]  important to understand that the brzezinski method is not to not to attack your enemy directly but
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:09.360]  to to use the various pieces on the board to your advantage to get someone else to destabilize your
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:13.840]  enemy for you and of course that's exactly what the color revolutions are and of course there are
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:19.520]  all sorts of other underhanded ways in which war can be waged without being directly at war and we
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:24.560]  see that for example with the stuxnet worm that was created by american israeli intelligence and uh
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:30.320]  and used to destabilize the iranian weapons program so as so again there's all sorts of things that
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:35.120]  are going on underneath under the table and and behind the scenes that that are of course more
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:40.480]  important than what we're being fed through the uh the palatable path of the uh the mainstream media
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:46.480]  and stuxnet's a very interesting example because it's an admitted tool of war albeit not directly
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:51.360]  violent but the response to it is that we're supposed to have cyber security at home now
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:56.880]  that they're going to clamp down on the internet and potentially curtail freedoms and direct access
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:03.120]  because of things like the stuxnet which we know are coming right out of uh foreign policy and the
[01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:09.760]  defense department and as you mentioned us israeli intelligence uh it's just amazing how they build
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:16.160]  one crisis upon another and it's all set to react on this map and the things happening in the middle
[01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:20.400]  east are happening here at home too and whatever form i don't know if it's going to be the way
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:26.960]  ferrican sees things uh but it's already happening in wisconsin and other parts it's it's so right
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:30.960]  and it's so important for people to understand that these weapons that are being supposedly
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:35.280]  constructed to to combat the enemies which themselves are being propped up by the globalists
[01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:40.560]  are always also directed at ourselves i mean that's that's the point of these types of
[01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:44.320]  crises and these types of weaponry and all the things that are being developed is that
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:49.360]  whatever you see being used against your enemy at some point the unfortunately the globalist
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:52.960]  controlled governments are going to try to use against themselves as well because that's the
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:58.320]  way they construct these crises so you see stuxnet weren't being used as a way to say well look
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.320]  these types of things can be constructed so now we have to create this this overarching cyber
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:06.640]  security bill which oh by the way can let us have a kill switch over the internet but
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:11.920]  it's bad when egypt uses it it's great when if we have that option though so um so again yes
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.560]  absolutely every crisis is aimed outwards and inwards it's like uh the tsa do they really
[01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:21.200]  need genetic screening of people coming into the country no they don't but what is that about it's
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:26.640]  about creating the genetic screening control control grid based on these database technologies
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:30.320]  that of course is part of the the eugenics program which i know you're extremely well
[01:41:30.320 --> 01:41:35.360]  familiar with because i know some of the articles you've written about the eugenics agenda yeah the
[01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:41.360]  eugenics agenda seems to never end it goes back more than a century and we're just seeing neo eugenics
[01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:47.680]  now but of course that's a whole another topic but yeah the dna thing is very frightening at tsa
[01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:53.760]  and we know it does fit into larger paradigms particularly to watch as bill gates foundation
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:58.880]  and everything they're doing with these vaccines but what else is on your radar right now james
[01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:04.320]  corporate what else have you been reporting on recently um well there's so much to report on but
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:08.000]  uh but even just touching on the the gates foundation and the things they're doing with the
[01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.160]  vaccines and the way they're promoting this uh genetic screening technology and all of that
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:16.400]  well one way to look at that is through the paradigm of of what the foundations are and
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:20.480]  how they came into existence and what they're really about so i would urge people who have
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:25.920]  not done so to take a look at the work uh the testimony of norman dodd and uh g edward griffin
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:31.280]  did such an important such a landmark interview with him in the early 1980s that's now completely
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:37.200]  available for free viewing on the net you know through the youtube or whatever and and people
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:41.600]  there unfortunately it's a travesty that so few people have watched it but just startling testimony
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:47.200]  from this man who was on a re uh the head researcher for a congressional committee in the 1950s called
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:52.400]  the reese committee which was looking into the uh the tax exempt uh foundations of the robber barons
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:56.960]  the carnagees and the rockefellers and the fords and the others who had set up these foundations
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:03.520]  to uh to use as an arm of control even as they're hiding under the guise of philanthropy and uh his
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:07.840]  testimony about what he found in the the meeting minutes for the the founding of the carnagee
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:12.880]  endowment in 1908 and uh what they were talking about and how they decided that the best way to
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:18.160]  manipulate society is to get america into a war so then they started deliberating about what would
[01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:23.920]  be the best way to and to get america into a war and of course by 1917 they were involved in world
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:29.200]  war one and um and again it's just all part of this this manipulation that's going on at a scale that
[01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:33.840]  few people would even begin to imagine unless they're they're really seeking out this information
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.480]  but it is there and it is available and uh and people need to start using the tools that we have
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:43.600]  right now to to arm themselves with the knowledge that we need to win yeah and it's amazing how deep
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:49.920]  this uh strategy does go uh by the way we have an interview exclusive for president planet dot tv
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:55.120]  with charlotte isra b where she does talk about a lot of these normand dodd uh tax-free foundation
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:44:02.080]  hearings uh but bottom line our country's basically a farce it was taken over long ago by these tax
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:07.840]  exempt foundations and be bad enough if they were operating independently but they are clearly
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:13.360]  coordinated with the united nations uh which the rockefeller family themselves helped set up
[01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:17.760]  then they have their own foundation and the other foundations uh that seem to do the work for them
[01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:22.960]  they come up with these strategies and then they globally implement them in a coordinated fashion
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.760]  top down into these various countries uh particularly all throughout the west you see
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:34.880]  things implemented in the u.s at the same time as britain australia uh canada other parts of europe
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:40.720]  and it's we've been taken over by these foundations what we think is our constitutional government
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:47.120]  has been completely thwarted and until we as a as a larger nation wake up to that we can't get
[01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:52.480]  our constitution back because we think things are still going along hunky dory uh problems here and
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:58.960]  there uh but really we were sold out a long time ago james exactly right exactly right so so people
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:04.960]  can look into things like the id card issue and how the un has has had their their conferences and
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:09.680]  come up with protocols to standardize id cards throughout numerous countries so so a couple
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:14.640]  of years ago everyone in in in america was talking about the real id and and what a terrible travesty
[01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:19.600]  that would be to come in to create this national id database that would be another part of the
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:23.520]  control grid well it's already in place and functioning in numerous countries and we have
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:29.280]  this standardized id that that is really an international id database that's that's just
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:34.480]  waiting to be actualized it's already the the protocols are already set up the standards are
[01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:39.600]  in place and uh and country after country is implementing it again quietly behind the scenes
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:43.760]  international agreements that that few people have any idea about but there are researchers
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:48.080]  out there that are providing valuable information on that and and for example i've talked to uh
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:53.440]  nithin alan be a researcher in the uk who wrote an excellent article about the way the id cards
[01:45:53.440 --> 01:45:58.880]  are being brought in as an international uh on an international basis without people really
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:04.480]  understanding what this this is really about yeah and look to egypt they're ample uh excuse me not
[01:46:04.480 --> 01:46:09.520]  egypt at all uh looked at india where they're implementing the biometric uh thumb printing
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:16.080]  and the other uh dna based stuff and then you've got gondy his whole revolution started being
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:22.160]  against thumb printing being against biometric and id cards uh way back you know nearly a hundred
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:27.600]  years ago and and yet the stuff is happening and it's true it's coordinated uh all the places you
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:33.680]  say uh anyway we thank you for your time uh james we have alex on the line and we're going to go to
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:39.280]  him now uh really appreciate your insights as we try to figure out this middle east and everything
[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:45.360]  else that's going around the world uh thank you james thank you uh do we have alex now
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:50.720]  yes i'm here are they hear me hey alex uh that was a great job on the view uh really
[01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:56.240]  turning around the popular culture paradigm and trying to get people back to the real issues that
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:01.760]  are going on in the world uh tell us what happened from your point of view well absolutely that was
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:05.520]  our plan from the beginning i didn't know charlie was going to go in that direction on the show the
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:10.400]  charlie i know is calm focused loving guy i think he's rebelling against a a trying to quit stuff on
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:17.040]  his own uh but that's a whole nother issue you notice it's all over the news today that the dsa now
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:23.920]  wants to take dna swabs out of your cheek uh to fly this is the beta testing ground for total
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:29.600]  domestication of the population was in bill clinton's executive order back in the mid-1990s
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:33.920]  and covered in america 12 by design i was just talking to judge andrew depolitana had lunch with
[01:47:33.920 --> 01:47:38.560]  him just now after i did a couple tv shows of you and another and he was talking about it's
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:43.600]  incredible that all over fox they're talking about wow how it shows it's right about the babies
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:47.840]  in the blood and being put in the pentagon database of course i was right 15 years ago i
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:53.040]  published a secret document to give it to me by let's just say military nurse in san antonio just
[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:59.520]  like three years before was mainstream news we broke the clergy response team uh news information
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:03.200]  and so we're having a major effect the globalist coming down on us but it's been not gone
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.280]  control grid uh erin am i coming through good to you from time square uh it sounds good to me
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:14.480]  alex uh i'm not on the board but uh as far as another levels are are great i'm getting a thumbs
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:22.240]  up over there okay good continuing here the charlie scene situation basically blew up in my face
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:29.360]  but i'm not somebody uh who who who takes something you know uh that's a curveball or a wild card
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.560]  and uh you know falls down crying about it i was i've known charlie for six and a half years
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:39.440]  whenever i go to la i stay at his house to their many times to their for a week straight before no
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:45.600]  drugs no alcohol working out only vices coffee and cigarettes and so when he called me and said
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:49.120]  help me stay straight you know help me fly out here you know that's why i came out and hung out
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:52.960]  with him and i said listen if you weren't with bombshell McGee and all these women there weren't
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:58.080]  Versace two patients of cocaine mainly with alcohol the cocaine stuff was completely exaggerated
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:04.560]  he admitted it was long and that he wanted to uh basically change that but he was told
[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:11.920]  well i guess we're about to go to break uh we're not quite a break yet alex but uh why don't you
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.160]  why don't you continue there all right sorry it's just so noisy out here i thought i heard music
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:21.920]  um he was going to come on the air talk about how he was clean how he was straight and talk about
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:25.840]  obama not responding to his 9-11 questions and right before the interview he said i want to get
[01:49:25.840 --> 01:49:30.560]  into all these other subjects and i knew that once he got on air especially towards the end
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:35.200]  that it was going to be a serious controversy and so what i've set out to do especially when the
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:40.320]  mainstream media comes after me or comes over charlie sheen now i'm able to get on national tv
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:45.760]  and talk to the mind num sheep who only watch cable television or mainline broadcast and inject
[01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:52.400]  real ideas that's why four days ago uh media matters panicked on thursday and said attention
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:57.920]  media alex jones says he's using this to inject anti-new world order by information well that's
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:04.560]  absolutely right the quote charlie sheen winning uh that's what we're doing here and and it's like

[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:35.680]  trying to take attention from this we're saying they demand they they mentioned how you're a
[01:50:35.680 --> 01:50:40.960]  quote conspiracy theorist and how all this uh sheen stuff goes back to the conspiracy stuff
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:46.160]  they try to discredit everything but good job trying to turn it around uh we'll get more details

[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:32.320]  okay we are back on this monday february 28th alex is waiting in the wings he's been under a siege
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:38.960]  of media blitz he's been on all kinds of stations including the view abc's view with more than 30
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:43.760]  million viewers this morning alex tell us what's happening with this media storm and the other
[01:54:43.760 --> 01:54:49.120]  issues you want to cover well i completely dominated all the view host as you saw shut
[01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:54.160]  them down dominated i talked to the head producer he said they never been shut down like that but they
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:58.400]  have like instant rating numbers coming in they said it was off the chart they were super excited
[01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:02.960]  about it and of course the crowd the uh the uh the insidial audience love hearing about
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:06.960]  building seven being blown up and how the government did they love hearing about
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:12.480]  dsa attacking the american people our slave training they love uh you know hearing about
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:17.200]  george w bush being a war criminal they love me going after hassel hoff barbara walters almost
[01:55:17.200 --> 01:55:22.320]  had a heart attack above the end of it he was so mad because he was going to have a heart attack
[01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:27.920]  so so certainly again no weapon formed against us so prosper i was completely blindsided by charlie
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:33.920]  but i know by charlie so upset they keep putting out these vanity cards while he was away getting
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:39.520]  better getting clean saying you know he's dead inside took lory's gonna outlive it there's a
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:44.560]  whole bunch of these things and it's basically i think a way to get him to to quit some of the pain
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:49.920]  all these you know tens of millions of dollars are coming out of its indication and so charlie is
[01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:55.120]  somebody who's coming off addiction after years being cleaned he's detoxing right now he's very
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:56:01.840]  manic and i know he interviewed 2020 and mbc they did hours and hours of interviews and he gets sick
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:06.960]  of being judged and so he just basically makes a joke about it all but uh you know he knows it's
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:12.240]  not good and he's trying to change his life but my issue on the show was charlie's been my friend
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:17.920]  playing with courage for 911 truth i got him on the show to dispel rumors uh that uh weren't true
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:22.000]  i got him on the show you know talk about the fact that i've seen him blood tested
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.520]  urine tested and he was clean he's not done that you know four mainstream news they've
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:29.760]  passed through he's totally clean and then he kind of went off on a tangent on other issues
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:33.360]  because you had a fight with his ex-wife the night before so this isn't even about charlie
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:39.120]  sheen or alex jones it's about the information and it's the greatest example i know of culture jamming
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:42.640]  whereas they would just be talking about all this it's good they're hearing information about the
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:48.400]  new world order about 911 these are all these housewives and people when we came in this morning
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:53.280]  it's all the line to go to the view it was about 98% women these are people who've never been exposed
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:59.680]  to these real issues who are now actually being exposed to it so god is certainly turning this
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:06.800]  overall uh into a very serious blessing for us being able to reach out to so many people
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:13.280]  and awaken them to real issues so we're very very thankful because i was completely blind
[01:57:13.280 --> 01:57:17.520]  sighted about what happened last thursday because i never heard charlie like that but again he's
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:23.680]  in a very fired up manning phase he's tired of apologizing to people he's tired of being demonized
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:27.760]  and you know here's a guy turning down what could potentially be about a hundred million dollars
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:34.960]  of syndication next season as well just in his boss's face but when i got on the airplane to fly
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:41.520]  here sunday uh to new york city people knew who i was on the plane but other people were going
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:47.040]  winning winning like a professional football player in front of me uh the one of the biggest
[01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:51.120]  banks in the country was there i had like a three-hour argument with him about the new world order
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:56.640]  uh as we were flying uh to new york and so the point is it's kind of like chuck norris fax chuck
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:01.760]  norris when he uh does a push-up he doesn't move the earth does now there's all these
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:07.360]  charlie sheen type chuck norris gizms tied into the whole anti-new order movement so what charlie
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:11.680]  did was he took people's criticism of drugs and alcohol people's criticism you know claiming
[01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:16.400]  he's a warlock he's your buddy who works for toucan sam he made a joke out of that he took
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:21.920]  all of that threw it right back at people's faces and uh i apologize for some of it was shocking
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:26.240]  it was shocking for me as well but again in the end it's turning towards something good and that's
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:30.640]  what's uh exciting about all this as the whole world melts down in the world government as the
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:34.720]  beginning we'll be right back alex well we're hitting that break and we're going to be on the

[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:09.280]  underneath the americans at home i have tremendous influence on our president in congress and they
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:16.000]  really are calling the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:22.160]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:28.400]  destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner bernanke the arsonists
[01:59:28.400 --> 01:59:32.960]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today
[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:39.680]  seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic

[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:14.240]  network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[02:00:14.240 --> 02:00:22.000]  alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:23.680 --> 02:00:29.200]  okay we do have alex right here i'm erin dyke sitting in and we're going to finish up with alex
[02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:36.240]  what he saw on the view this morning and everything else i've got uh at least a few reports we've seen
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:43.280]  some blogs trying to attack you and charlie alex uh but the comments themselves are almost exclusively
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:49.120]  positive defending alex jones info wars uh so hopefully this was an important impact i mean
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:53.120]  it's the same thing a hollywood reporter and all these other big publications that attacked me and
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:57.840]  lied about me and you know did all these things that almost every comment is for us so if you
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:03.680]  have this he is culture jamming inserting into mindless celebrity fluff and charlie he was said
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:08.720]  that privately real issues uh i didn't know the day he was going on and he was with a gauntlet down
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:13.760]  in front of his bosses or was going to be that over the top but he did it for a reason because
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:18.400]  he's based on a mission to turn war on these people uh and i just hope that everything
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:23.600]  gets worked out between them but regardless you know we are here now having again another major
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:28.480]  effect breaking into the matrix brainwashing transmission with real information where would
[02:01:28.480 --> 02:01:33.360]  you hear about building seven being an inside job apparently rumsfeld himself hasn't even heard
[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:40.080]  about that yeah exactly where would you hear about 23.7 trillion missing from the uh the sparring
[02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:43.680]  banks fellow the private fellow deserve where would you hear about a million dead iraqis where
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:48.560]  would you hear about the tsa putting their hands on people's paths i mean i jammed it in there to
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:52.960]  an audience who would never hear about that i had a couple other big national tv interviews coming
[02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:58.000]  up i'm gonna do the same thing uh unfortunately their tapes are not live but i'll do my best to
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:02.960]  basically cover nothing but you know anti-new order information and break it on this transmission
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:06.400]  i had no intention to bring this to happen i thought charlie was coming on about you know
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:10.240]  being clean and talking about the new world order but you know the bottom line is people
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:15.440]  have judged charlie who's certainly no you know angel but 35 years ago being a big star they only
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:20.880]  focused in on the lapses he's had the problems he said i know him as a good guy as my friend i had
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:25.760]  him on he did an extreme interview i wasn't expecting and i can't you know make apologies for that
[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:30.000]  uh the bottom line we've had a huge effect the first media matters you know four or five days
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.160]  ago says god dare the media not point out he's a conspiracy theorist then i start going on the air
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:38.320]  talking about real issues and they say oh my gosh media don't have him on don't have him on in fact
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:42.640]  i was going to go on oberman whoever the new guy is that does the show zoom on that that that's a
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:48.560]  lot of ms mbc the media matters make phone calls uh and killed that separately while i've been here
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:54.320]  had glenn beck doing his normal blocking need for getting on fox which is fine i could care less uh
[02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:59.840]  so it's just a continued circus as they continued to attempt to keep me off of the air
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:03.840]  but they can't stop the signal they can't stop our radio listeners they can't stop all the great

[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:35.840]  controversial he's always had a microscope microscope on his life uh but he boldly came out
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:41.440]  for 9 11 five years ago and he knew they were going to attack him they've been waiting to attack him
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:46.400]  they've threatened him on air and he did it anyway and it'll be six years and it'll be six years in
[02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:52.000]  april as far as i was talking to him before that but the point is he's my friend he's not perfect

[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:28.400]  uh it's it's always a pleasure now uh we it's things are accelerating we have really reached
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:34.800]  a tipping point you know for years alex we had a bubble where we just printed more and more paper
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:40.640]  and more and more print paper and you know you and and so many really great people tried to warn us
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:46.160]  about you know we can't just keep printing paper like this well now we've come into the end game
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:52.640]  and now um i'm doing a salieri report tonight which is my sort of briefings for subscribers
[02:10:52.640 --> 02:10:58.560]  and my theme tonight is going to be global debt for equity swap and let me explain what i mean by
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:04.800]  that um when you when you print this paper really what you're printing is bonds and the and the it's
[02:11:04.800 --> 02:11:09.840]  the bond market that's balloon we've had a long-term bull market the bond market and now we're sitting
[02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:15.120]  here with all these bonds and it's not like we've created more real things you know so there's the
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:20.320]  same amount of land and the same amount of gold and you know there's some more people and and now
[02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:24.080]  we've got to say we've got all this paper and sitting in the bond market and it's kind of eyeing
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:29.120]  the equity market and tangibles and the precious metals and saying uh oh maybe we have to get out
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:34.800]  of paper into real things how are we going to do that and that's the that's the shift because
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:39.440]  when you get out of the bubble the next thing that happens is everybody's got to get out of debt
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:45.600]  and get into equity and and that's the process you're seeing accelerate and it's really you know
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:50.400]  some days it's just i know because you're you're watching the news every day you're you know you
[02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:55.200]  come to your website and it's more news than the wall street journal these days and and it's
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:03.360]  accelerating and it's it's kind of dizzying we had a perfect example is is we've had the germans
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:09.040]  basically take over the new york stock exchange and there's almost no discussion in in the mainstream
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:13.920]  media and in congress that was the first big issue but i want you to put it in layman's terms
[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:22.240]  what these consolidations of the stock exchanges mean well what what's happening is if you look at
[02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:29.440]  how we're integrating global trading there's tremendous redundancy in the exchanges um and
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:37.040]  and there's also pressure to centralize control and uh you know so that's clearly happening now
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:43.440]  what exactly is driving the merger with the germans at this time that's a big question mark
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:49.840]  i'm not clear uh but but make no mistake about it what you're talking is basically the germans
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:58.400]  controlling arm our biggest stock exchange i mean we're talking about deleting sovereign
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:04.400]  government here we're talking about literally the germans in control now it's important to point
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:09.120]  out that the critical issue here is going to be who controls the system because if lockheed and
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:13.440]  time course still controlling and operating the systems there's really not as much of a change of
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:18.240]  control as it looks and then meanwhile that little friendly nice guy named john stewart that's not
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:25.200]  his real name his brother uh runs the new york stock exchange and we've got the communist chinese
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:30.240]  owning the majority of the debt next the private fellow reserve that's international now the germans
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:36.800]  coming in and taking over uh the stock exchange with almost no news and this unifies the fraud
[02:13:36.800 --> 02:13:42.640]  so the inside players are able to engage in fraud and not get caught correct me if i'm wrong
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:48.720]  but studying this is a layman the manipulation of stock markets gets exposed by other other
[02:13:48.720 --> 02:13:54.480]  stock markets that are connected to it but if they get it all under one house then the sky's the limit
[02:13:54.480 --> 02:14:01.680]  right that's good this guy well pretty much this guy has the limit now anyway because the the game
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:08.720]  has so pushed beyond the regulator's ability both intellectually and politically to deal with it
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:15.280]  that what we've seen alex as we saw over the last 15 years with the bubble tremendous fraud
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.280]  i've talked a lot about the mortgage fraud which i'm more familiar with and the securities
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:24.400]  fraud or the the equities fraud but we've seen tremendous fraud both in the mortgage market
[02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:31.040]  the securities market the bond market the result of that fraud was the people who did it got
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:38.160]  refinanced out with the bailouts you know so so not only did they engineer the fraud but they got
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:43.120]  refinanced out in total and the fraud was a huge success that's why i call it a financial coup
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:49.680]  d'etat and the reality is you know from your point of view it was simply a takeover and it was a
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:54.560]  successful day it was a successful financial coup d'etat and there's literally been no indictments
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:15:00.880]  or no prosecution and and the message is clear it was a fundamental reengineering as opposed to
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:08.160]  incompetence or or what they think of his criminal behavior this has all been methodically set up
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:15.840]  and prepared goldman sacks and others got their regulators in over ireland the u.s uh places like
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:22.880]  new zealand everywhere they ran the same scam and now they openly admit yes we're going to slowly
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:27.840]  kill the dollar yes we're going to have the s dr is the new currency yes you're going to pay carbon
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:34.880]  taxes and all of this to private banks so the ponzi scheme operators are now openly setting up world
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:40.320]  government run by them holding our country's hostage to the derivatives debt that we don't know
[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:46.720]  that they've created and bernie made off from prison comes out and says the banks had to know on
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:52.480]  monday what he was doing and of course they knew he was just a new he was just a mid-level player
[02:15:52.480 --> 02:15:57.440]  so let's go through the global government what it looks like who the players are and then what's
[02:15:57.440 --> 02:16:03.040]  happening currently as they bring in the austerity and lie to people and say cut the paychecks get
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:09.120]  rid of the teachers raise the taxes steal more of the pension funds and that'll fix the debt
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:15.280]  when they never even address the 1.5 quadrillion so that we could pay all of our money in taxes
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:20.240]  get rid of all of the services and still it wouldn't even put a dent in the 1.5 quadrillion
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:25.760]  so they're scapegoating wisconsin's and the irish and others right now well but let's let's break it
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:32.480]  down because if you look at how much money's been siphoned off um when they say there's no money
[02:16:32.480 --> 02:16:37.440]  you know question number one is well where did the where did the trillions that have disappeared
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:43.760]  including illegally go to so so question number one and when you say that there's no money well
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:47.920]  you know there's it's like saying there's no milk in the milk bucket when there's a hole in the bottom
[02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:54.080]  where's it been running out to so so the money went somewhere and that's question mark number one
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:17:01.520]  but question mark number two is we've known for 50 years that we were running the united states
[02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:08.640]  population on an unsustainable basis now during that 50 years we've produced billions and well
[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:12.880]  trillions of dollars of retirement savings and that's part of the money that sort of disappeared
[02:17:12.880 --> 02:17:18.800]  down the hole um but the reality is everybody in america has known that this is not a sustainable
[02:17:18.800 --> 02:17:24.720]  system we've all avoided it it's not just the elites but we've avoided it too um one of the
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:30.720]  reason the politics have worked the way they worked alex is because we've said uh you know
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:35.520]  give us more money we don't want to change and every year we've been able to do that in the
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:42.960]  governmental mental mechanism but that's like a a bass biting down on a purple worm i mean we're
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:48.160]  we're certainly the ignorant fish that's biting into the hook but i'm talking about where that
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:54.560]  hook we're we're not ignorant alex i mean the way you get power over you know to solve a problem
[02:17:54.560 --> 02:18:00.800]  you need power the way you get power is you take responsibility i agree and the reality is you know
[02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:07.040]  we but let's go let's look at the money whatever the american government is doing every one of us
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:14.400]  is financing it by paying our taxes okay yes uh every one of it is financing it by putting money
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:21.760]  in pension funds and not uh having a position on where it goes everyone is of us is donating money
[02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:26.720]  including tithing to churches who are supporting and going along with all of this every one of us
[02:18:26.720 --> 02:18:32.960]  is shopping or banking at the banks in the stores that are doing that okay if you look at how our
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:39.360]  money works household by household county by county we have the power to say you know something
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:45.440]  we're not going to finance this anymore if you my church wants you know my tithe every month and
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:50.720]  you've got to change you know what you're doing how you're doing it i'm not just going to pay taxes
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:55.360]  to a government that's running drugs um i'm going to go get a lawyer and we're going to battle this
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:19:00.400]  out in court we're going to organize locally and do a local escrow for tax money as long as you're
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:05.680]  running the government on a legal basis and treatments are going out the back door so in
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:12.240]  other words we're all participating in this and we're all complicit in it and and it's by
[02:19:12.240 --> 02:19:18.000]  seeing that that we see the opportunities to start to really make serious change well kathryn
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.520]  i agree with you that we need to look in the mirror if we want to see the main you know culprit but
[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:30.080]  at the same time i'm talking about the the brains that are actually implementing uh the scam i mean
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:34.320]  what you're talking about is what black folks for 50 years have talked about that if they just spent
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:40.560]  their money in their neighborhoods they would become wealthy but they never do that so so i
[02:19:40.560 --> 02:19:45.280]  understand they are part to blame i am part to blame but i'm also talking about the overall
[02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:51.760]  economic system that designs it or it's so easy uh to be defrauded and it's so easy for the general
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:56.640]  public to be ignorant i mean you you know what's happening i know what's happening but still the
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:00.720]  general public doesn't they're starting to wake up let's come back and break it all down with kathryn

[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:22.640]  Catherine I mean we know what they're doing we know what the problem is but but summing it up
[02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:28.960]  what is the end game of these people if we don't stop them i mean it's just unlimited the amount
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:34.240]  of theft they're engaging and their destruction of the economy by design and they offer the solution
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:39.120]  being given them more power than things get worse and the solution is give them more power you
[02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:44.960]  talked about government drug dealing i mean it's in bloomberg it's in bloomberg that 367 billion
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:51.680]  dollars uh in uh you know one major u.s bank alone of drug money and it turns out they're
[02:24:51.680 --> 02:24:57.680]  running the aircraft right i think i think it's pretty simple you have a small group of people
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:05.920]  who have been in control of governance on planet earth and they're looking at the growth of
[02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:13.920]  population and they're saying we need a plan to be in environmental harmony and we need uh a way
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:20.080]  to integrate new technology because the the growth you know the new technology and discoveries in
[02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:25.200]  technology are accelerating that make it much harder to stay in control and so i think what
[02:25:25.200 --> 02:25:32.080]  they're saying is we need a much smaller population a population that that can be uh will be much
[02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:39.040]  easier to control and and will leave us in control but also will bring the planet back into environmental
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:44.800]  harmony because living in the current lifestyle on the planet we're doing is you know it's just
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:50.400]  not environmentally in harmony the way it's being done now so the the question for them is how do we
[02:25:50.400 --> 02:25:56.320]  get to environmental harmony and stay in control and be able to integrate new technology without
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:03.680]  losing control and um and the reality is they want a much greater centralization and they
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:09.440]  want a much smaller population and i think all the different things we're watching are are not
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:14.720]  you know we have to be careful not to compare what's happening to the official myth of what
[02:26:14.720 --> 02:26:19.120] 's supposed to be happening and we have to step back and look at what's happening and say okay well
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:24.000]  this is really happening it's a little bit like you remember that line in rosemary's baby when she's
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:29.760]  being raped by the you know demonic figure and she says oh this is really happening well you know
[02:26:29.760 --> 02:26:35.200]  step one is we have to get out of denial and say this is really happening um you know things are
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:40.480]  very different the we have an official story of what's supposed to be happening we need to let go
[02:26:40.480 --> 02:26:47.120]  of that and start looking what's really going on and the reality is um we we literally have a group
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:55.040]  of people alex who has now gotten a hold of much more advanced technology not only that that you
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:01.360]  know that it is adopted generally but is beyond what we know exists and they literally have become
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:07.520]  and this is richard dolin's expression of breakaway civilization they no longer consider themselves
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:13.360]  of the same species as us and they never you know they no longer consider themselves subject to the
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:18.800]  same laws and rules that we're subject to and by the way the globalist all write books and
[02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:23.600]  make statements about this i covered my film in game they believe we're animals it's social
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:30.480]  Darwinism and it's their right to dumb us down get us in control grids and then kill us and then
[02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:35.360]  i'm here warning the general public a lot of them are listening others make jokes and the globalists
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:43.680]  say see they want us to kill them they deserve it well there's no doubt there's a cycle of disrespect
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:49.760]  between the between the general population and the people who are who are governing and one of
[02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:56.080]  the reasons that there is alex is because and i speak as somebody who at a very minor lower
[02:27:56.080 --> 02:28:02.720]  level has been part of that group um you know when you try and and govern when you try and
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:10.960]  build a consensus for turning an aircraft carrier and turning it in time it is it is such a frustrating
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:16.960]  experience that at some point you you give up you give up trying to have an intelligent conversation
[02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:23.840]  with the general population and you just decide to manipulate and and you decide to manipulate
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:29.760]  because you've got to turn the aircraft carrier in time and and essentially what you learn is
[02:28:29.760 --> 02:28:36.160]  eventually you know the crowd will always do what makes the crowd the most money there was a really
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:41.200]  brilliant comment in the in an interview that julien assange did with time magazine about a
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:47.440]  month or two ago which he said you know political change in america doesn't result in in change and
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:52.800]  that's because america's been fiscalized and what he meant by that is if you drill down and look at
[02:28:52.800 --> 02:28:59.440]  every household in america and where their income comes from and every county level you know
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:05.760]  municipal infrastructure and where their income comes from up to the state the federal government
[02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:11.840]  is the primary source of income at this point i mean we're much more socialized um financially than
[02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:18.720]  the than the soviet union was before it fell and and literally the dependency on on the federal
[02:29:18.720 --> 02:29:24.000]  till is so enormous that that even when you get political change you don't get changed because
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:29.920]  everybody's on the dole and and that's why i keep coming back to the money and dealing with the money

[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:33.600]  you got this new article up on salari uh that just came out today uh with some very important
[02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:39.680]  information de-capitalizing housing what do we see in the markets that you talk about things
[02:35:39.680 --> 02:35:46.800]  reaching a tipping point or v2 point of no return i talked to alex that when we first started about
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:53.520]  this uh this shift between bonds and equities and one of the things that means given the pressure
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:58.800]  on the bond market the sort of the end of the bull bond market is now financing the things we
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:04.480]  financed with fixed income is is now going to shift and it's going to be much more expensive
[02:36:04.480 --> 02:36:08.320]  and what that means is mortgage financing is going to be much harder to get it's going to be more
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:15.040]  expensive tougher terms and conditions now that's part of policy uh a policy determination by as you
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:20.480]  would call the globalist but it's one that that would have to happen anyway because of the amount
[02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:26.480]  of paper that we've printed in the sort of the day of reckoning being here so this is very tough news
[02:36:26.480 --> 02:36:31.760]  on the housing market at the same time we see the federal government and and part and parcel of that
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:38.720]  is interest rates starting to creep up and the risk that they could go up even much higher um but
[02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:43.600]  we see the federal government announcing that they're going to basically liquidate shutdown or
[02:36:43.600 --> 02:36:50.560]  end fanny and freddy in some way so that that means tremendous subsidy that's a bit of flowing and
[02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:56.400]  keeping the housing market going um cut off and in the decapitalizing housing i just list a whole
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:00.960]  lot of other things so the other shoe is beginning to drop the other shoes beginning to drop and
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:06.000]  believe it or not one of the biggest shoes is not direct on housing it's that everybody's living
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:12.560]  in housing is experiencing rising expenses and falling uh income it's what i call the slow burn
[02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:18.080]  but i was up in philadelphia for a couple months at the end of the year and i had one person very
[02:37:18.080 --> 02:37:23.280]  you know tiny lovely little row house their their utility bill last year was $200 a month
[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:28.560]  this year it's $800 a month they're choking and and you do you know during all the blizzards you
[02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:34.800]  heard that from all over the country so that means the cost of maintaining repairing heating a home
[02:37:34.800 --> 02:37:39.520]  is is the skyrocket and the head of the energy department said last week they're going to shut
[02:37:39.520 --> 02:37:45.920]  down at least 500 uh power plants china's building three to five a week we can't build new ones uh
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:49.520]  and they're literally saying they're going to bankrupt the coal industry whether you like coal
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:55.680]  or not that's more than half of our energy i mean this is economic warfare a post-industrial world
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:01.280]  well what what this means is a tremendous amount of the growth americans most americans have always
[02:38:01.280 --> 02:38:06.240]  thought of their home as an investment we're going into a world where your home is not an
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:12.000]  investment it's a consumption good you know it's a consumption good just like uh you know
[02:38:12.720 --> 02:38:20.560]  buying a car okay or or uh i don't know buying a buying a dress okay so it's now a consumption
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:25.920]  good and a lot of the growth in the value of homes has come from the debasement of the currency
[02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:32.160]  and from larger homes so we've had a massive infusion of federal credit to make mortgage
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:36.800]  financing cheaper more accessible and that's financed everybody having more and more space
[02:38:36.800 --> 02:38:41.680]  now it's going to reverse and go the other way and so whether it's the expense part of your
[02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:47.840]  of maintaining and owning a home or the financing or simply the size what we're going to see is
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:53.040]  smaller and smaller homes driven by people's it's going to look like people's preferences so we're
[02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:58.720]  going to see a rear reversal of where we've been and that has a very important strategy
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:03.680]  or implications to the strategies of most households on what kind of home they're going
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:06.320]  to have where they're going to have it what they're going to pay for and how they're going to
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:10.160]  finance it i'll tell you what's incredible and i want to get your inside baseball take on this
[02:39:10.160 --> 02:39:16.560]  working at the highest levels of government two weeks ago the winehouse about 28 hours 30
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:21.280]  hours after we wrote a report that it was energy policies causing a lot of the blackouts because
[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:26.400]  of increased consumption and not having enough power and the texas reliability energy energy
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:31.520]  commission agreed with us heritage agreed with us in their analysis the winehouse actually responded
[02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:37.840]  on their front page and said that we were liars but then the next day the energy secretary comes
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:42.480]  out and says we're going to shut down a lot of the plants i mean it's incredible why would the
[02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:47.040]  white house respond to us are we are we hitting pretty close to the bone they're not they're not
[02:39:47.040 --> 02:39:58.160]  concerned with libel law yeah i know i i i think i think uh you know i think there's um real
[02:39:58.160 --> 02:40:05.280]  sensitivity here and um and they're you know essentially there's tremendous effort being
[02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:11.520]  put into keeping the official story going and but the official story is wearing thin and so i
[02:40:11.520 --> 02:40:16.800]  think there's real sensitivity on these issues now what we need is we need for everybody in
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:23.280]  america to realize look you know you've got to be on one side of the other most american
[02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:28.080]  thinks that they can stay in the middle of the road and that's the work workable strategy the
[02:40:28.080 --> 02:40:34.160]  reality is you know there is no middle of the road anymore if you if you look at what's going on and
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:40.800]  i just spent uh i just spent a half an hour with a naturopath yesterday going through the details
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:45.840]  of what is in the chem trails and what that does to your body and and what you have to do to try
[02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:52.160]  and mitigate it it's the most you know it's uh i don't know if you've ever done more uh show on
[02:40:52.160 --> 02:40:58.480]  margillan's disease but if you really get down and look at what is being sprayed overhead by the
[02:40:58.480 --> 02:41:04.000]  government and you really face that you know it's a real day of reckoning alex because you have to
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:08.880]  say well why am i financing this because every one of us with our money whether it's where we
[02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:14.720]  think or how we pay our tax we're financing that yeah we've gotten so snuggled in with accepting
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:20.640]  being abused that they can come out and admit they're radiating kids radiating tsa shooting people
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:26.800]  up with syphilis and guatemala un caught giving kids live polio constantly in the news and it's
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:31.920]  just oh they're killing us for our own good let's love the government i mean the the people running
[02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:40.640]  things are literally i don't i don't think people i you know my personal experience with most americans
[02:41:40.640 --> 02:41:47.520]  is they're scared they're scared and and the control is so complete including through their
[02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:54.000]  household income that they don't see a pathway to do something about it and and that's why it's so
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:58.880]  so important that we be free to talk about it which is why i'm a member in good standing in the alex
[02:41:58.880 --> 02:42:03.440]  jones fan club because you know you're leading the conversation and i think part of it is getting a
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:08.960]  critical amount of people to face you know this is really happening this is really going on and
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:13.520]  and we have the power to do something about it but we have to be prepared to talk about it we
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:19.200]  have to be prepared to face it and the reality is alex we have to be prepared to face our own
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:25.040]  financial and operational complicity i mean we've we've watched drugs coming to our neighborhood
[02:42:25.040 --> 02:42:32.080]  targeted our kids for 50 years and and you know we've let it go on and let's face it a lot of
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:37.040]  you know a lot of households in our community are financially dependent on killing our own kids
[02:42:37.040 --> 02:42:43.200]  you know and so well that was my next point i mean i'm sure you saw bloomberg and ap a few
[02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:52.320]  months ago uh we're one of the biggest banks uh in the uh uh country um what wacovia admittedly had
[02:42:52.320 --> 02:42:59.840]  360 plus billion dollars in just a three-year period of drug money and own the planes delivering
[02:42:59.840 --> 02:43:06.960]  it around i mean what more do we need i mean well what we need is we need a financially
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:13.920]  practical pathway out of the dependency on all this stuff and now it's very interesting when i
[02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:19.840]  when i realized how bad things were in 1998 i said you know i have to come clean i have to get
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:25.360]  financially i have to withdraw and stop making money from the system and so i've tried as much as
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:30.560]  possible to withdraw so is you so as many others we need thousands and thousands of people to
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:36.080]  realize you know we don't have to go along another world is possible let's start to shift shift our
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:42.400]  money and time shift our attention get as put as many degrees of separation between you and the
[02:43:42.400 --> 02:43:45.760]  people are trying to kill you and let me throw a quick example out on this and get your take
[02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:51.760]  and we'll go to the phone calls if you go back 12 13 years ago or so no matter where you lived in
[02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:57.200]  the country it was almost impossible to find truly organic food but as people began to purchase it
[02:43:57.760 --> 02:44:04.240]  it built a market for it and so now you've got as much choice with organic as you do with the
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:10.160]  horrible poison stuff but the system comes in then to change the rules where they don't have to list
[02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:16.000]  that salmon is a cross species chimeric clone or where they don't have to tell you that some grapes
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:20.400]  are really gmo and i see that same thing now in wisconsin where they're saying you know what
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:24.800]  we're going to take even more money out of your paycheck and put it into pension and it'll run
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:29.680]  right down out of the hole into the ground they'll never get so i see them moving to seize
[02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:33.760]  everybody's paychecks homeland securities announcing they will control the paychecks
[02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:38.720]  everything will be wired through them you'll have to have a homeland security uh you know check on
[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:44.080]  your deal to be able to have a job this is already happening so they know that people are going to
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:49.520]  figure out the emergency exit they're now moving to try to block them they know we could see uh
[02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:55.200]  with the financial system people withdrawing like they did from gmo and so they're trying to block
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:45:00.000]  those exits right but let me give you an example because ultimately i think they're going to fail
[02:45:00.720 --> 02:45:06.880]  um what you're watching are desperate measures by desperate people they're scared and and you
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:11.920]  you wouldn't be seeing the kind of things we're seeing if they weren't now i'm not uh you know i
[02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:17.120]  don't underestimate the resources they have because you you're you're literally looking at a group
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:21.840]  of people that have incredible technology and have essentially stolen and now control all the
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:27.040]  efforts on the planet so i'm not saying that they're not incredibly incredibly financially
[02:45:27.040 --> 02:45:33.520]  powerful and they don't have with bank technology but the reality is um it it takes you know
[02:45:34.080 --> 02:45:39.520]  traditionally to run a civilization it takes an organizing principle and and it takes what i
[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:44.960]  what the chinese refer to as the mandate of heaven and these folks clearly you know they don't have
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:48.160]  that and if anything the thing that's going to destroy them is they're going to kill each other
[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:55.600]  because they they don't have they're not grounded in in a higher you know positive organizing principle
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:45:59.440]  so ultimately i just don't think it's going to work so all the evil men and tyrants need to
[02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:04.320]  flourish is that good men and women do nothing we have to put out or our organizing principle
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:09.600]  versus theirs and we're going to beat them if we stand up and take action incredible
[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:13.920]  gathrin austin fits let's go to some phone calls natin pennsylvania thanks for holding her on the

[02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:06.560]  cause of autism and uh i sat down i just couldn't believe it here's dr awes having a wonderful
[02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:14.400]  discussion with the audience and a panel of doctors and for all intents and purposes it i mean it's
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:19.600]  coming out uh this i mean i want to say this about dr awes and again i watch glenn beck maybe
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:26.400]  once a month i watch dr awes maybe once a month i'm busy but i saw a piece when he had um mr
[02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:33.120]  smith on uh what's his first name um he's the expert on gmo's i've interviewed him yeah yeah
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:38.560]  jeffrey smith he had him on and let him lay out the facts of gmo killing people i mean that shows
[02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:44.320]  how far we've come that beck has to talk about the new world order and that awes can now talk
[02:47:44.320 --> 02:47:50.240]  bad about gmo on national tv and you're saying a pretty fair piece uh and playing a clip for my
[02:47:50.240 --> 02:47:55.360]  show whoa that's amazing yeah i i was floored i mean he said it said at the top of the screen
[02:47:55.360 --> 02:48:01.040]  courtesy info wars dot com and i was thinking oh my goodness i mean you just got fun to airtime on
[02:48:01.040 --> 02:48:05.840]  there so i'm just i'm just thinking i'm hoping those people go and check it out but the the
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:11.040]  discussion the audience i mean everybody was just involved and i hope you get a chance to see it
[02:48:11.040 --> 02:48:16.720]  well listen i had a jump but i appreciate that call nate uh how exciting how exciting is that
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:23.200]  um that uh that we're seeing things like that katherine well what it means is they have to
[02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:29.680]  protect their channel in other words what you're watching is the mainstream will will blank it out
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:34.640]  until they're forced to itself interest again right well what's happening is they're losing market
[02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:40.720]  share so so they'll shift when they absolutely have to uh and when they think they have enough
[02:48:40.720 --> 02:48:46.640]  control i mean i think they think with the food safety bill and the new usda regulations um you
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:51.680]  know that that they have to shift this way and they need to kind of process the grief through
[02:48:51.680 --> 02:48:57.680]  the mainstream to get the channel but you know it's it's good that it's moving but it's still not
[02:48:57.680 --> 02:49:03.280]  not you know you still have to shift the money yeah interesting to shift the money it's not
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:08.080]  enough to shift the conversation you have to shift the money too but it starts first with
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:12.720]  the conversation absolutely use other chinese proverb journey of a thousand miles starts with
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:17.280]  a single step and you're taking us a lot of steps here katherine jeff in iowa you're on the year
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:23.680]  yeah hi i would like to get both your takes on a defensive and an offensive economic strategy
[02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:30.240]  against the globalist one defensive let's pick a few regions or areas that have enough libertarianism
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:37.920]  and enough subsistence farming and hunting along with the cosmopolitan uh city type environment to
[02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:43.200]  sustain us through the cracks that's coming say austin or new hampshire maybe the foothills of
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:48.880]  california and put our money in there locally so we can survive with subsistence farming well
[02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:54.560]  there are already a lot of communities like that and uh i my job is to generally try to wake people
[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:58.720]  up and let them know what's happening but yes these moves even if it's you and 20 friends
[02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:03.200]  that move into a general area and promise to support each other or you and your friends move
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:07.840]  outside the city i've now done that i mean i'm now doing what katherine challenged me to do
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:13.920]  two years ago on air katherine well i you know i think it is a great idea we encourage people to
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:20.240]  do circles but anytime you can get together with uh like-minded people in your area or even by phone
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:25.600]  by network and start to talk about how you can shift your money to finance the strategic resources
[02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:31.840]  you need whether it's energy or food it's a it's a wonderful thing to do um because the reality is
[02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:38.480]  the way to have a resource is to finance it and you know or absolutely uh jeff jeff that's a great
[02:50:38.480 --> 02:50:44.720]  idea uh what's the other one yeah the offensive one non-violent siege of bilderberg shut it down
[02:50:44.720 --> 02:50:50.080]  shut it down i agree bilderberg coming up in a few months there should be a million people there
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:55.760]  not 500 but we've gone from none to 500 so let's do it it's up to you your listeners still got the
[02:50:55.760 --> 02:51:02.640]  resources identify the globalist we'll be right back more calls right ahead is it really possible

[02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:46.800]  ever since i was really born and like i believe in destiny and i was born on february 6 the same
[02:54:46.800 --> 02:54:53.520]  day as bob marley and adam flushed out you know what that is uh i think so yeah he's the creator
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:55:00.240]  of the luminati and my whole point behind that is is that i think i was born to you know expose
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:05.200]  some of this stuff too and my whole thing is i'm one of you know i thought you said i's adam
[02:55:05.200 --> 02:55:11.040]  weisabh it didn't sound quite quite like it go ahead yeah he's german so i know it's an
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:15.120]  engelstein university real quick give a question or comment for uh i wish we had more time and
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:20.960]  my thing is i just want to um you know i've been riding around alana and they have you know cameras
[02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:26.720]  all over our they took our street lights down to install cameras you know every few hundred feet
[02:55:26.720 --> 02:55:32.560]  from each other but my whole point is i'm going to um ask why haven't we started a march or something
[02:55:32.560 --> 02:55:38.320]  yet i appreciate your call well i mean we're all atomized it's hard to get together we are starting
[02:55:38.320 --> 02:55:43.680]  a march in our own daily lives making decisions with the way we spend money that will bring down
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:49.600]  the globalist kathryn one of uh one of my favorite books that i read in the last year is a book called
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:58.080]  prophetic imagination uh by a guy named walter brugerman and and he talks alex about how uh
[02:55:58.080 --> 02:56:03.280]  the way moses brought down the empire was to to leave it in first and foremost in his mind
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:09.680]  and imagination to just persuade people that they don't have to go along and that they can withdraw
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:19.120]  and i think it's the same year um we need to we need to take it by the system and and proceed to
[02:56:19.120 --> 02:56:25.040]  make other plans on our own so come out of her come out of babelon yeah just just you know and
[02:56:25.040 --> 02:56:28.480]  before you can leave a place you need to leave in your mind and then you need to leave it in your
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:34.400]  pocketbook and you need to find other people who want to leave with you and and a lot of that's
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:38.960]  turning off television and that's why they're having to put some of the truth on tv to keep
[02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:43.440]  people tuned in to all the other lies they lay well i would turn off your you know one of the
[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:48.320]  things the three things you can all do in the next 30 days is turn off your tv you don't need
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:53.280]  any more entrainments of little programming eat fresh food the food system is killing us you've
[02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:58.880]  got to find local farmers and local food sources are learned to grow your own and and make sure
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:05.280]  you get fresh water so so and and for heaven's sakes get your money out of paper and out of
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:09.840]  out of the big bang well what you just said is so beautiful just getting our body straight and
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:14.800]  i'm trying to do that and it's so hard to get off the coffee and all those type of things and and
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:20.240]  the fattening food but just as you get more sleep just as you i mean it makes everything clearer
[02:57:20.240 --> 02:57:25.200]  that's why the globalists try to poison the food and water they want us off balance the last seven
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:31.520]  months do you know what sugar futures are up in the last seven months 88 percent so if you're not
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:41.040]  off sugar yet you're going to get off sugar you know so so really what we have you know look at
[02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:46.400]  what you have under your power and can do in the next 30 days to protect yourself and your family
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:50.480]  and the more you do that the more people who do that the more we stop being atomized and can connect
[02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:55.920]  and find each other and support alternative media and organizations and radio stations and people
[02:57:55.920 --> 02:58:00.320]  that tell the truth even if you don't have money spread the word about those this is how we're
[02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:05.520]  going to change the world i apologize to michael george sam ed and others he'll call back in tomorrow
[02:58:05.520 --> 02:58:10.720]  but i appreciate you trying katherine austin fits salari.com always amazing to have you on god bless

[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:34.080]  are melting because they've almost got their world government but we woke up to them and so
[02:58:34.080 --> 02:58:59.680]  it's all badly coordinated if you stand up and say no they will fall
