[00:00.000 --> 00:14.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.200 --> 00:39.240]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen thank you
[00:39.240 --> 00:48.840]  for joining us on this Tuesday the 23rd day of October 2012 edition I am your host Alex Jones
[00:48.840 --> 00:55.800]  and we're going to be here for the next three hours today and we are going to be breaking down
[00:55.800 --> 01:06.000]  the fact that there is election fraud looming from both political parties in different ways a lot
[01:06.000 --> 01:10.400]  of that is now showing up on the radar screen we're going to be breaking that down today some
[01:10.400 --> 01:16.200]  I got Bev Harris a black box voting joining us tomorrow we are also going to be looking at the
[01:16.200 --> 01:20.800]  debate last night even though both men are bought and paid for by the globalist it's important to
[01:20.800 --> 01:26.760]  look at what they're saying and what they're planning to do kind of like the debate last week
[01:26.760 --> 01:31.960]  with Obama and Romney Obama said yeah I don't want to just ban your rifles your semi-autos I'm
[01:31.960 --> 01:36.480]  gonna ban your handguns too and I'm gonna come after your guns and I'm gonna put people on
[01:36.480 --> 01:42.800]  psychological list extra judicially so we already knew that but it's good to see the little tidbits
[01:42.800 --> 01:50.680]  and nuggets we get out of those events so we're gonna be breaking all of that down here there's
[01:50.680 --> 02:00.200]  also a business insider report and video that we have up at info wars.com and it's just a minute
[02:00.200 --> 02:06.160]  and a half video we're gonna play it coming up in the next segment pointing out that Obama and
[02:06.160 --> 02:13.800]  Romney agree on so many things that it makes your head spin so we're gonna be breaking that down a
[02:13.800 --> 02:23.360]  bit today I've got to say just being honest Obama barely won the debate last night with zingers
[02:23.360 --> 02:30.840]  and jokes and things and I think that Mitt Romney really laid down to a great extent the Republicans
[02:30.840 --> 02:41.160]  began spinning it that well you know what really happened here with this is that Romney was looking
[02:41.160 --> 02:47.680]  more presidential well that's what the that's why they say Obama lost the first debate because he
[02:47.680 --> 02:54.320]  was quiet and not combat combative and basically let Romney run over him Obama was also doing the
[02:54.320 --> 02:59.000]  point one point two point three thing where they go through a bunch of points that impresses the
[02:59.000 --> 03:07.680]  sheeple overall I had to walk out during the last 20 minutes of it for whatever reason I was becoming
[03:07.680 --> 03:15.600]  nauseated during it for whatever reason I mean maybe it was dinner I don't know but I felt nauseated
[03:15.600 --> 03:26.720]  and went into the children's playroom and they tend to congregate in my younger daughter's room
[03:26.720 --> 03:31.840]  and they were in there listening to a book on tape and I went in there and listen to that I mean
[03:31.840 --> 03:36.880]  I could not watch the rest of it I thought I've got a duck out of here and get out here and I know
[03:36.880 --> 03:43.280]  why I started getting nauseated because it was like living in the matrix or something or go into a
[03:43.280 --> 03:48.080]  funhouse where you walk over a gangplank and they've got a big cylinder spinning around you and no
[03:48.080 --> 03:53.200]  matter what you do you get dizzy I mean it was it was that effect because everything was based on
[03:53.200 --> 04:01.040]  the tissue of lies and they were debating within a universe of lies basically rearranging deck chairs
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.960]  in a virtual reality on a virtual titanic and it was just ridiculous to hear them talk about how
[04:06.960 --> 04:13.600]  they were fighting al-Qaeda now they've got to go after Assad and al-Qaeda and Obama did add a few
[04:13.600 --> 04:17.520]  provisos because he knows this is coming out well well we don't want to arm the wrong groups
[04:18.400 --> 04:23.680]  in Syria well that's who they're arming that's the main force is al-Qaeda so they're already acting
[04:23.680 --> 04:29.280]  like oh we didn't know we armed the wrong groups so that a year from now two years from now when the
[04:29.280 --> 04:35.120]  10,000 missiles they got out of Libya 2,000 of them heat seeking or radar guided start blowing
[04:35.120 --> 04:41.280]  airliners out of the sky well they can say oh boy we didn't know they got it and then the media will
[04:41.280 --> 04:48.320]  of course cover all that up so that's coming up it's just a giant broadcast today and we're
[04:48.320 --> 04:52.640]  going to attempt to go over all of it straight ahead on the other side of this quick break I'm

[07:12.240 --> 07:16.880]  it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly
[07:16.880 --> 07:20.720]  i'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since
[07:20.720 --> 07:24.560]  the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being
[07:24.560 --> 07:30.000]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today japanese eat miso africans eat fermented

[08:57.920 --> 09:04.480]  wars nightly news and info wars news dot com and thanks to listeners and their support with a 48
[09:04.480 --> 09:10.960]  hour broadcast last week moving on to the different satellite systems worldwide here in the next three
[09:10.960 --> 09:14.480]  to six months we're getting it all geared up right now we begin want to thank all of you out
[09:14.480 --> 09:20.800]  there for spreading the word about the broadcast all of you out there in media in the general public
[09:20.800 --> 09:27.360]  all of you who have have supported this transmission in different ways our success in getting the word
[09:27.360 --> 09:33.280]  out is to great extent due to you and also the great crew in there and the job they do
[09:33.280 --> 09:37.280]  yeah if you just joined us i'm alex jones i'm a constitutionalist who loves freedom
[09:38.720 --> 09:45.680]  and i am simply here to try to defend our republic and to restore our republic and to
[09:45.680 --> 09:51.280]  kick the private federal reserve out of our country and to get due process back and to
[09:51.280 --> 09:58.480]  end or at least curtailed the massive crony capitalism or monopoly capitalism going on
[09:58.480 --> 10:05.120]  we're inside mega banks and others go in and buy off our governments and then have governments pay
[10:05.120 --> 10:09.920]  our tax money to them and bailouts and have those governments shut down their competition
[10:09.920 --> 10:14.640]  in a planned economy so that's basically what i stand against and i want everybody to have
[10:14.640 --> 10:19.360]  prosperity i want this country to continue to be the greatest nation the world's ever seen
[10:19.920 --> 10:25.280]  but to do that we've got to get our republic back from the clutches of the new world order
[10:25.280 --> 10:30.720]  that is using us as a giant military force and economic force to dominate the planet
[10:32.320 --> 10:36.000]  if you want to take over the world you've got to control the united states and that's why
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.320]  so many powerful interests have come in over the last 50 60 years and and infiltrated the
[10:42.320 --> 10:49.840]  institutions and taken them over and and now we've reached the point of a serious rot setting in
[10:50.720 --> 10:54.080]  and the corrupt elites being able to get away with basically anything they want
[10:55.840 --> 11:00.240]  and so we are hurtling like a out of control freight train down a mountainside right now
[11:00.880 --> 11:05.920]  and if you think things have gotten crazy so far strap yourselves in you ain't seen nothing yet
[11:05.920 --> 11:12.400]  okay where are we going today here i do want to open the phones up about the debate last night i
[11:12.400 --> 11:16.480]  want to open the phones up about geopolitical developments things that are happening uh watching
[11:16.480 --> 11:20.960]  the debate hearing both men talk about how we've got to fight al-qaeda in the middle east
[11:21.600 --> 11:25.440]  and they would both talk about fighting al-qaeda and then they would say we've got to deal with
[11:25.440 --> 11:30.960]  syria we've got to deal with iran knowing the general public thinks syria and iran or al-qaeda
[11:30.960 --> 11:37.040]  when one is a secular government and the other is a shia government both historical enemies of
[11:37.040 --> 11:42.560]  al-qaeda based out of saudi arabia and the sunnis and i'm not bashing 80 percent of muslims happen
[11:42.560 --> 11:47.520]  to be sunni but that's where that will hobbyist sect comes from and it's run by saudi intelligence
[11:47.520 --> 11:53.600]  and british intelligence and that's on record and so i literally got nauseated watching the debate
[11:53.600 --> 11:58.720]  because my brain was going a million miles an hour during it because it was like people
[11:58.720 --> 12:04.560]  debating virtual reality for all these games they've got where kids go and our adults go and
[12:04.560 --> 12:11.840]  actually pay money for lamborghini's and mansions in imaginary worlds and they go and meet at physical
[12:11.840 --> 12:17.760]  parties and uh you know the uh you know you know the gorgeous woman i've seen this in the news
[12:17.760 --> 12:22.720]  goes and tries to pick up the nerd because he's got the lamborghini in the mansion or as a movie
[12:22.720 --> 12:29.840]  star you know in the virtual reality i mean it that's what goes on my son uh you know who goes
[12:29.840 --> 12:36.640]  different homeschool events and and and academies and groups more and more he says all they talk about
[12:36.640 --> 12:42.240]  are these virtual realities that they live in and he just can't stand it i mean he's reading adult
[12:42.240 --> 12:49.120]  history books uh he's reading uh books on you know quantum mechanics and he's and and he's you know
[12:49.120 --> 12:56.720]  he's a tough little you know job type guy and he's not like he's some bookworm he he recognizes
[12:57.440 --> 13:03.760]  uh that it's totally false and he says i want to be around adults he's uh i mean i could take him to
[13:04.960 --> 13:10.240]  adult cocktail parties where other people bring their children and and have them around
[13:10.240 --> 13:15.440]  billionaires and and and rocket scientists and you know people and they absolutely sit around
[13:15.440 --> 13:19.280]  and have conversations with him he doesn't want to hang around with their 10 year olds but it's
[13:19.280 --> 13:24.560]  not just that they don't want to go play in the woods in a fort they don't want to uh wrestle
[13:24.560 --> 13:33.120]  they want to talk about video games my mother teaches sunday school and uh i mean i see it in
[13:33.120 --> 13:37.760]  restaurants when kids don't have their video games they will sit there and imagine that they're playing
[13:37.760 --> 13:44.880]  and there's major studies out um then a couple last month uh where video games are
[13:44.880 --> 13:53.360]  lowering iq reducing uh the cognitive abilities and rewiring brains where you've got like a mentally
[13:53.360 --> 14:00.800]  ill chicken they've done pavlovian uh scanarian test with a chicken over a few years where it pecks
[14:00.800 --> 14:07.360]  at a you know tic-tac-toe grid and grain comes out and if you take that chicken out of there after
[14:07.360 --> 14:14.480]  just six months or a year depending on the study of doing that it can't stop pecking and imagining
[14:14.480 --> 14:20.720]  a tic-tac-toe grid on the wall and sometimes we'll just starve even if there's food right next to it
[14:20.720 --> 14:26.880]  because it just keeps pecking the wall and i mean i see these kids i mean the children are
[14:26.880 --> 14:32.880]  wrecks ladies and gentlemen just wrecks and and that's upper middle class kids you go see inner
[14:32.880 --> 14:37.920]  city kids and people i mean they look like brain damaged zombies white black is spanish doesn't
[14:37.920 --> 14:43.760]  matter the system is just killing everyone the gmo the dies the additives the television
[14:43.760 --> 14:50.400]  the video games people are now being inserted into the matrix all the auto accidents i see
[14:50.400 --> 14:54.800]  it people can't stop texting while they're driving i see it everywhere some woman last night as i'm
[14:54.800 --> 15:01.600]  driving on a country road pulls out in front of me stops in a road i'm going 50 miles an hour
[15:02.640 --> 15:07.520]  i see her way up ahead she pulls out stops and as i get closer i start applying the brakes
[15:07.520 --> 15:14.320]  she's looking at her phone and i barely stopped in time and then she just looked at me like a zombie
[15:14.880 --> 15:20.240]  hit me a dirty look and then just drove on and i mean i would have t-boned her folks in my big
[15:20.240 --> 15:27.200]  giant truck going 50 i mean she'd have been in bad shape if i hadn't seen her she would have been in
[15:27.200 --> 15:34.080]  bad bad bad shape and i'm telling you she was in a zombie world you see the report people walking
[15:34.080 --> 15:39.040]  off cliffs people walking into fountains people walking into traffic uh Richard Reeves for years
[15:40.720 --> 15:45.280]  drives cabs uh works here in the office and i've been a truck driver for that
[15:46.160 --> 15:50.400]  and Reeves said oh yeah people all the time downtown would just walk out in the middle of
[15:50.400 --> 15:56.560]  traffic and be hit by cars in front of him he said one time a guy got hit not very hard fell down
[15:56.560 --> 16:01.920]  and just kept looking at his phone and got up stumbling around and and that's that's what
[16:01.920 --> 16:07.200]  that debate was targeting show called politically aware people that you know that 23 percent that
[16:07.200 --> 16:12.880]  read newspapers that think they're real informed they were tuning in and and it was just it was
[16:12.880 --> 16:21.680]  like watching people debate the different virtual reality video games they play it's like man i don't
[16:21.680 --> 16:27.200]  want that i don't want the fantasy woman i don't want the fantasy house i don't want the fantasy car
[16:27.200 --> 16:33.200]  you understand i want the real thing that's why i have likened sports not playing sports that's
[16:33.200 --> 16:37.920]  great but but obsessing on it saying oh when lance armstrong and then i'll get to the top news when
[16:37.920 --> 16:42.880]  lance armstrong got defrocked yesterday i meant to get into it i heard local talk show host saying
[16:42.880 --> 16:49.600]  man it sure felt good for austin having those seven turd differences i mean lance armstrong i know
[16:49.600 --> 16:56.160]  lance armstrong uh very well for multiple people uh very close to me that have had a chance to be
[16:56.160 --> 17:03.360]  around him quite a bit i'll just leave it at that uh through a couple twists of fate multiple people
[17:03.360 --> 17:10.080]  with multiple connections and he is literally an egomaniac demon monster and i and as he's been
[17:10.080 --> 17:16.240]  falling i haven't talked about that or the fact that he hates me and calls me the effing conspiracy
[17:16.240 --> 17:22.640]  nuthead and i mean that's a quote and i got that from multiple sources uh not not from my family
[17:22.640 --> 17:28.320]  uh people bring me up to lance armstrong the the cussing begins i was talking to somebody about
[17:28.320 --> 17:32.240]  how when he went for one of these celebrity shows to pick up his custom car that would have been
[17:32.240 --> 17:36.480]  given to him for free all the cussing and yelling and yelling at sheryl crow and the rest of it
[17:37.040 --> 17:44.320]  you know i mean we're talking about a maniac psycho okay probably psycho definitely egomaniac
[17:44.320 --> 17:53.600]  uh somewhat sadistic totally domineering uh well what's the proper term for him he's not a psychopath
[17:53.600 --> 18:02.240]  a definitely a sociopath but i don't revel and get off on watching him fall but to hear these
[18:02.240 --> 18:07.200]  talk show hosts that have defended him because their egos tied up in it now reveling and watching
[18:07.200 --> 18:13.520]  him fall that's disgusting too i don't get off on watching lance armstrong fall makes me feel
[18:13.520 --> 18:19.600]  bad for the species and then i hear the arguments well there's so many lessons in this well everybody
[18:19.600 --> 18:24.000]  at the top's blood doping and taking roids and taking all these other things i mean you got to
[18:24.000 --> 18:29.600]  do it to win well see that's how society gets corrupt hey everybody cheats on their wife
[18:29.600 --> 18:33.920]  hey everybody cheats on their husband well even if some of that goes on it doesn't mean you're
[18:33.920 --> 18:39.440]  supposed to be proud of it you see what i'm saying and and you know oh everybody doesn't
[18:39.440 --> 18:44.160]  spend time with their kids let's them watch tv all day oh everybody takes prozac oh everybody eats
[18:44.160 --> 18:48.880]  gmo oh everybody's dying of cancer oh that's just the way it is it's the saddest just give
[18:48.880 --> 18:56.160]  into it just go with it so that went on and on and i was thinking about lance armstrong now
[18:56.160 --> 19:00.080]  just just just watching people celebrate the fall of lance armstrong i mean that that's the
[19:00.080 --> 19:06.320]  type of thing you see in a civilization that's just absolutely rotting where people don't feel
[19:06.320 --> 19:13.040]  good about themselves and so when they see somebody who's big fall they get off on it
[19:18.800 --> 19:23.360]  taking a bunch of drugs to win a competitive sport if he would have just been lying about
[19:23.360 --> 19:28.160]  that and being arrogant about that i i wouldn't dislike lance armstrong so much it's knowing
[19:28.160 --> 19:37.040]  everything about him and knowing how he dominated other people it's like a sword snager type that's
[19:37.040 --> 19:41.520]  what i don't like but but here's the rest of the story you know it's come out that the entire
[19:41.520 --> 19:45.920]  you know big international cycling organizations he was involved with help cover it up and he had
[19:45.920 --> 19:51.280]  lots of positives it's just that when he was going up they didn't want to let it come out then
[19:51.280 --> 19:56.880]  they destroyed him later after it came out to have their cake and eat it too so this is more
[19:56.880 --> 20:02.640]  of burning some little demons so the big devil looks good the worst drought in 50 years continues

[24:12.240 --> 24:17.040]  Alex Jones okay I digressed off into Lance Armstrong but I've been meaning to talk about him for days
[24:17.040 --> 24:24.320]  so I've made my point about that only because you can take a big mainstream hype story and then
[24:24.320 --> 24:30.240]  use it to illustrate other things that are happening in society like hey everything's corrupt go ahead
[24:30.240 --> 24:37.520]  and go with it or how they didn't want to expose his cheating when he was making cycling billions
[24:37.520 --> 24:44.160]  of dollars but now they can destroy him after I mean the examples just go on and on or how these
[24:44.160 --> 24:49.600]  egomaniacs the greater the bigger they are the harder they fall because they're in it for the wrong
[24:49.600 --> 24:57.680]  thing now I haven't gotten to our top story yet it's up at drudgereport.com the left hand side
[24:57.680 --> 25:05.680]  and amongst all the other amazing debate news it is a info wars.com story if you go to info wars.com
[25:06.400 --> 25:13.840]  and go to the featured news area you can see two articles that break this down both by
[25:13.840 --> 25:21.600]  Paul Watson to tie together Obama supporters continue threats to riot assassinate Romney
[25:23.360 --> 25:26.560]  that's the headline Obama supporters continue threats to riot
[25:27.200 --> 25:33.360]  assassinate Romney and this time Watson I don't know gives like 30 examples and links to a bunch
[25:33.360 --> 25:39.280]  of others where the people say I'm gonna hunt Romney down and I'm going to kill him close quotes
[25:39.280 --> 25:44.960]  I'm going to shove a shotgun in his mouth and blow his head off I'm going to come to the next
[25:44.960 --> 25:50.320]  campaign event and kill him I mean it's just off the charts in fact some of these were so explicit
[25:50.320 --> 25:55.520]  Paul told me he wasn't even adding them for whatever reason I said no I want those in there
[25:57.680 --> 26:01.920]  so there it is I want people to see this and understand what's going on again even if you
[26:01.920 --> 26:07.440]  don't support Romney this is an amazing double standard I will assure you if conservatives
[26:07.440 --> 26:12.560]  or libertarians or constitutionalists were saying anything like this about Obama there would be
[26:12.560 --> 26:19.840]  arrest all over the news it would be national news right now and it's not two weeks ago the
[26:19.840 --> 26:27.360]  drudge report started linking to our stories uh first uh George Soros controlled White House run
[26:27.360 --> 26:31.200]  think progress and others I mean literally the White House has their transition chief in there
[26:31.200 --> 26:38.240]  began writing articles implying it wasn't even true or that we were racist uh and slime bowl uh Chris
[26:39.360 --> 26:48.400]  pumpkins uh he is on uh CNBC or MSNBC MSNBC running around I have an article here today
[26:48.400 --> 26:54.320]  saying it is racist not to vote for Obama so if I don't want to turn my guns in I'm racist
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.360]  if I don't like government running healthcare written by the insurance companies I'm racist
[26:59.360 --> 27:05.040]  uh if I don't want completely open borders I'm racist uh if I don't want world government I'm
[27:05.040 --> 27:11.520]  racist uh if I don't want to put al-qaeda into Libya and Syria I'm racist uh if I want freedom
[27:11.520 --> 27:15.600]  and states rights I'm racist I'm sick of it you're the people that talk about race all day
[27:16.400 --> 27:21.840]  I walked into gas station last time they had MSNBC on with Al Sharpton saying it isn't about
[27:21.840 --> 27:26.240]  Obama it's about Joe mama and he was you know then it cut back to him on the show talking
[27:26.240 --> 27:30.720]  about how you're racist if you don't vote for Obama these people that's all they do is invoke
[27:30.720 --> 27:34.800]  race and then that will create racism because people are designed to be tribal and they're
[27:34.800 --> 27:38.560]  hearing all day how they're racist a lot of people that aren't sophisticated will start
[27:38.560 --> 27:46.640]  becoming racist because of people that race pimp all day in fact here it is uh breaking it down
[27:46.640 --> 27:52.400]  post-debate MSNBC's Matthews claims Romney supporters fueled by racial hatred of Obama
[27:52.400 --> 27:57.840]  really I'd love to have a black president that got rid of all the gun laws and got rid of the
[27:57.840 --> 28:05.040]  private fellow reserve uh man you could have an all-black cabinet you could have everybody
[28:05.760 --> 28:12.240]  seriously I could get as if white people on average you know don't like Obama because he's black
[28:12.240 --> 28:16.400]  how about white people I know and black people I know and everybody else I know who's not a
[28:16.400 --> 28:23.040]  complete idiot don't like Obama because of what he stands for but here here's the bigger issue they
[28:23.040 --> 28:28.400]  are literally folks Obama supporters in overdrive saying they're going to riot and kill people
[28:28.400 --> 28:33.360]  ensure most morons that are going to get online and say they're going to kill the presidential
[28:33.360 --> 28:38.800]  candidate are so stupid they're they're probably not very motivated I mean they're probably pretty
[28:38.800 --> 28:44.400]  darn lazy and they think it's just trash talk like you can do about some you know non-governor
[28:44.400 --> 28:50.240]  or non-president type person but the secret service is now confirmed they are quote visiting these
[28:50.240 --> 28:56.560]  people well I want to say this they need to be arrested because if I said something like this
[28:56.560 --> 29:02.560]  or if I was just a private citizen because I've seen it I've seen private citizen conservatives
[29:03.600 --> 29:09.440]  say that you know Romney uh you know was a great guy basically and Obama needs to be
[29:09.440 --> 29:16.880]  be taken out those quotes and the secret service comes and puts them in jail puts them in jail
[29:18.560 --> 29:24.080]  we had a listener posting of those years ago on the message board they were gonna kill bush
[29:24.080 --> 29:29.520]  and the secret service went and arrested them in Tennessee and it was on the news listeners
[29:29.520 --> 29:34.880]  sent me the newspaper where it was all you know on alex jones's show did this secret service came
[29:34.880 --> 29:41.680]  and arrested him and he got seven years in prison for saying he was gonna go after bush so these
[29:41.680 --> 29:46.400]  people need to be arrested or it's discriminatory and it's saying democrats are allowed to call
[29:46.400 --> 29:52.720]  for murder and mayhem that's why this is a big issue we're on the march the empires on the run

[33:26.320 --> 33:31.200]  well like i said we're getting between five and ten new affiliates every uh week or so
[33:32.480 --> 33:43.520]  and in the last couple days we've got kd kt 14 10 am uh in north dakota kd kt 14 10 am north
[33:43.520 --> 33:51.840]  dakota and k in a 9 10 am in selena kansas this is written so small here i don't want to say the
[33:51.840 --> 33:59.680]  name of the town in beautiful north dakota wrong kd kt 14 10 am in b e u l a h how do you pronounce
[33:59.680 --> 34:08.160]  that to show my ignorance balooa is that right but bula bula north dakota well whatever we're
[34:08.160 --> 34:14.400]  on there so very very exciting and a lot of other affiliates here the affiliate list is
[34:14.400 --> 34:19.680]  starting to get very very long very very exciting and it's also kind of scary uh funny that you know
[34:19.680 --> 34:23.200]  the neural order coming after me doesn't really scare me or the national media demonizing me
[34:23.200 --> 34:29.680]  doesn't scare me but yours truly screwing up with an audience this big that's what scares me
[34:29.680 --> 34:33.360]  it's very very humbling but i guess that's good i've seen so many other people get a little bit
[34:33.360 --> 34:39.440]  of power and they just go crazy uh and start getting real reckless i see that a lot people just
[34:39.440 --> 34:45.120]  destroy themselves when they finally start having success my dad the older i get i realize
[34:45.120 --> 34:50.800]  how much good advice he gave me you know he said big fish eat little fish he said you got to watch
[34:50.800 --> 34:59.040]  the little ones though that have nothing to lose uh and uh he of course uh also said so many people
[34:59.040 --> 35:06.240]  he's known right when they start having success destroy themselves and uh i guess it's the
[35:06.240 --> 35:10.880]  difference between being godfair and not being godfairing okay that's enough let's just stop
[35:10.880 --> 35:17.360]  right there uh this is a big deal i mean i've been attacked no exaggeration along with that drudge
[35:17.360 --> 35:22.880]  of drudgereport.com i don't know more than 15 different publications i and i wasn't even looking
[35:22.880 --> 35:28.480]  for these articles and i saw them saying that we were basically evil and horrible racist because we
[35:28.480 --> 35:36.160]  were covering literally thousands of tweets and facebook posts and youtube videos with real accounts
[35:36.160 --> 35:42.880]  saying they were going to kill Mitt Romney if he wins and or riot and or both and the secret
[35:42.880 --> 35:49.680]  service has gone and quote question these people i've gotten emails uh of people being picked up
[35:49.680 --> 35:54.640]  by the secret service like going to hey alex they are responding but that was before it was
[35:54.640 --> 35:59.600]  confirming the news i got several emails going no they took my brother to jail but they've now
[35:59.600 --> 36:07.920]  released him so it looks like they're doing something but i'm here to tell you if a conservative
[36:07.920 --> 36:12.720]  threatened george w bush which did happen they went and arrested him and he spent seven years in
[36:12.720 --> 36:16.720]  prison or got seven years last time i checked that was like six years ago i guess the guy's about to
[36:16.720 --> 36:20.880]  get out or has already got out i just saw the newspaper article about his conviction other
[36:20.880 --> 36:25.920]  people i know that have mildly shot their mouths off about obama have gotten secret service visits
[36:25.920 --> 36:33.120]  with them screaming at them screaming at them and we've heard callers who mildly you know said
[36:33.120 --> 36:40.400]  yeah i put on my you know website uh my little facebook yeah too bad uh that one you know obama
[36:40.400 --> 36:45.520]  and and george soros over there at davos both of them didn't just fall off the edge of the earth
[36:45.520 --> 36:51.680]  closed quote secret service came drug them in screamed at them so my point is why are these
[36:51.680 --> 36:58.160]  obama supporters allowed to do this by the thousands and threaten to riot because if i said i'm going
[36:58.160 --> 37:04.000]  to riot that's it i'm that's me saying i'm going to commit a crime i'm going to go out and burn
[37:04.000 --> 37:09.680]  some things down that's not free speech that is premeditated statement of the intent to commit
[37:09.680 --> 37:18.480]  a crime and there's state and federal laws out the yin yang uh to stop that and it's all selectively
[37:18.480 --> 37:25.760]  enforced it's like going back 15 years ago or longer i had several stalkers who were saying
[37:25.760 --> 37:31.920]  we're going to come and kill you and some of them would publicly say it and i would call the police
[37:31.920 --> 37:37.200]  and i went in and saw an osa detective and the detective was like well we don't know he's really
[37:37.200 --> 37:42.000]  serious about that alex and i've got a lot of stuff to do and don't you you know have a second
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.400]  amendment and then when the people started talking about my sister and and knowing where she went to
[37:48.400 --> 37:54.560]  high school she's 14 years younger than me uh you know i was already on the air and everything
[37:54.560 --> 37:58.560]  and you know she was in high school then i had to file suit to stop it and the courts did do
[37:58.560 --> 38:05.360]  something of civil you get a lot of stuff done so i have some experience with this and i just
[38:05.360 --> 38:09.600]  happened to know that you can do this to private citizens to get away with it but you can't get
[38:09.600 --> 38:14.720]  away with it with governors and senators and judges and the president so i want to know
[38:14.720 --> 38:21.040]  know why the media either says this doesn't exist or says i'm racist to cover it when this is a
[38:21.040 --> 38:27.200]  news story i mean look we covered people with threats to obama when he was uh running for president
[38:29.680 --> 38:34.480]  i mean that's that's something you cover and i wasn't accused of being anti-white
[38:34.480 --> 38:38.240]  because i was saying i didn't want anybody to assassinate obama by the way the last thing
[38:38.240 --> 38:43.600]  i want is for obama to get assassinated that would turn this horrible demon this globalist
[38:43.600 --> 38:51.360]  miscreant into a hero and a uh a martyr same reason the globalists see me as a horrible person
[38:51.360 --> 38:55.280]  and horrible you know demon they want to get but they they're they're a little hesitant to kill me
[38:55.280 --> 39:00.960]  or set me up because they know my nose is pretty darn clean a b it will highlight everything i've
[39:00.960 --> 39:06.960]  said and done but uh enough about that here are the articles they're both up uh at info wars.com
[39:06.960 --> 39:15.600]  and prisonplanet.com obama supporters continue threats to riot assassinate romney secret service
[39:15.600 --> 39:22.000]  attention fails to dampen violent twitter comments now that story is up at dredgerport.com
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.640]  on the left hand side we've also got the new article out which i forgot to print guys you
[39:26.640 --> 39:33.680]  print me the latest articles up at info wars.com thank you establishment plays race card to bury
[39:33.680 --> 39:40.480]  violent threats by obama supporters and there's also you know we haven't played this card yet
[39:40.480 --> 39:46.000]  because i tend to shy away from it but i'm gonna i'm gonna call watson up right now there are racial
[39:46.000 --> 39:52.000]  components towards romney and you know what i'm tired of being called a racist when i'm not so uh
[39:52.000 --> 39:55.760]  we're gonna go ahead and put that shoe on the other foot i guess i gotta have nemo or adan
[39:55.760 --> 40:00.960]  salazar or erin dykes or melissa melton or one of our in-house people uh cover this i'm gonna call
[40:00.960 --> 40:09.120]  paul watson right now uh in england uh right now on speakerphone here uh she gives me answers and
[40:09.120 --> 40:14.960]  sounds like a pink floyd song uh you know hey watson i got you live on air how you doing
[40:15.840 --> 40:19.840]  all right how are you good hey listen i just thought of an angle here you got chris mathews
[40:19.840 --> 40:24.640]  and everybody running around saying it's racist to talk about the rioting threats and you know and
[40:24.640 --> 40:29.680]  the threats against romney and we've got media as you know in the last few weeks saying it's you
[40:29.680 --> 40:36.240]  know racist to point all this out or that it doesn't exist i saw a bunch of uh racial epithets towards
[40:36.240 --> 40:42.160]  romney republicans and whites in general uh why don't you uh i mean i've even done two articles
[40:42.160 --> 40:46.960]  on this today but i mean why not just go all the way i mean they want to say we're racist
[40:46.960 --> 40:52.000]  when we're not raising racial issues uh why not point out that there are racial epithets
[40:52.000 --> 40:57.120]  or epithets whatever you call them uh being thrown uh i mean you could find them right there
[40:57.120 --> 41:02.560]  i was looking just through them this morning and found a bunch uh why not go there uh i mean
[41:02.560 --> 41:08.160]  since we're being accused of it why not point out that uh me thinks they are protesting too much how's
[41:08.160 --> 41:14.560]  that sound oh there's definitely those kind of terms i mean some of them are included in my
[41:14.560 --> 41:19.520]  article whether it's referred to yeah yeah i mean i mean i know they're included in your article what
[41:19.520 --> 41:26.560]  were you saying guys oh hold the phone closer you can't hear watson where is the speaker on this
[41:26.560 --> 41:31.280]  right here watson go ahead and talk to everybody yeah i'm just saying there was some of those in
[41:31.280 --> 41:38.320]  my article this morning but um there's a lot of references to the term cracker refer to romney
[41:38.320 --> 41:43.920]  or romney supporters in the tweet no no i know i know i know it's it's worse than that and listen
[41:43.920 --> 41:47.600]  you held back the stuff all the premeditated stuff where they laid out how they're gonna kill him
[41:47.600 --> 41:53.360]  put that in there listen now i didn't hold it back i just fined it until later i'm not in the second
[41:53.360 --> 41:57.920]  okay it's in the second article listen tell what let's just get you on air right now we're gonna
[41:57.920 --> 42:04.240]  call your skype right now so we can discuss this on air okay okay go to your skype right now guys
[42:04.240 --> 42:10.240]  just get him on skype right now thank you i mean i'm tired of this listen nine times out of ten
[42:10.240 --> 42:15.280]  we're holding back okay and and that's what i've told my writers just go with what the truth is
[42:15.280 --> 42:23.520]  is we're going to be accused of exaggerating let them have it okay stop holding back okay
[42:23.520 --> 42:27.520]  we're going to be accused if we said the sky was blue they'd say we were exaggerating so just
[42:27.520 --> 42:33.840]  say the sky's blue okay anyways those articles are up there and i want to know your take on
[42:33.840 --> 42:37.920]  this the toll free number to join us i mean are we wrong to point these out as a news organization
[42:39.840 --> 42:42.960]  i mean obviously we're not we would be censoring if we didn't cover this
[42:42.960 --> 42:47.600]  and uh there you go i mean i mean he links to some of them in there where they make the racial
[42:47.600 --> 42:53.280]  comments but my issue is the left always says it's okay to be racist towards white people
[42:54.400 --> 43:01.120]  and then that's what creates a culture of racism because they don't call it racism and then white
[43:01.120 --> 43:06.480]  people start seeing blacks as racist and then that creates racism see it's divide and conquer
[43:06.480 --> 43:13.840]  we have to call this racism out so it's not acceptable so that it doesn't cause more division
[43:13.840 --> 43:19.440]  i'm covering this to try to stop this division and i want to try to get people on the liberal
[43:19.440 --> 43:25.520]  plantation to realize it's a plantation like the native american uh russell mean said the left
[43:25.520 --> 43:29.520]  loved him till about 10 years ago when he woke up at the fellow reserve the new world order
[43:30.400 --> 43:33.600]  started supporting the constitution bill of rights found out it was inspired
[43:33.600 --> 43:42.000]  by a bunch of uh eastern uh north american and canadian tribes and as soon as russell
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.000]  means started talking like that boy the left turned against it because when you realize
[43:46.000 --> 43:50.480]  it's about putting you on a plantation it's about putting you on a reservation that doesn't
[43:50.480 --> 43:54.960]  mean the republicans are any different i mean last night we sat there do we have that clip
[43:54.960 --> 44:01.040]  let's play that clip out of business insider the article uh is up at info wars dot com
[44:01.040 --> 44:06.960]  where where and this is just some of the examples where romney kept agreeing with obama and obama
[44:06.960 --> 44:11.840]  with him because they're both globalist puppets and again they kept talking about the threat of
[44:11.840 --> 44:17.520]  al qaeda when the west is arming al qaeda and putting them in libya and syria and and i told
[44:17.520 --> 44:21.840]  you a year ago when they killed qaddafi i said you watch within a year to two i said two years
[44:21.840 --> 44:25.040]  actually i said within a year and a half two years you can look it up i said they're going to be
[44:25.040 --> 44:29.840]  bombing in libya and invading again to take out al qaeda and the media won't point out our own
[44:29.840 --> 44:34.560]  government put al qaeda in well it happened quicker than i thought within less than a year
[44:34.560 --> 44:40.080]  they're now got drones and stuff in there attacking quote al qaeda i mean this is ridiculous
[44:40.080 --> 44:44.720]  people are like well you know that's how the policy works destabilize the muslims destabilize the
[44:44.720 --> 44:49.760]  muslims even if you're a muslim hater and you're ignorant and bigoted like that out there and and
[44:49.760 --> 44:54.640]  bind all this is lamaphobia stuff that's that's been created and and accentuated by british
[44:54.640 --> 45:02.240]  intelligence and others on record don't you get the police states for you it was never for habip
[45:03.280 --> 45:11.120]  okay it was never for mr. ali it was never for them it's for the american people the west
[45:11.120 --> 45:16.480]  the police state they say is for gun owners conservatives veterans libertarians okay you're
[45:16.480 --> 45:22.560]  the target i'm the target everything they've used in feluja with checkpoints and facecans
[45:22.560 --> 45:27.760]  mit magazine and mitch is coming here we're prisoners if they get this done they hate our
[45:27.760 --> 45:33.120]  troops they hate us the globalists are using us they're playing us off against each other class
[45:33.120 --> 45:38.240]  of civilizations the great game divide and conquer balkanization divide and rule
[45:41.280 --> 45:47.120]  well but again here they are here they are basically on the same page obama and romney
[45:47.120 --> 45:54.400]  not two cents worth of difference between them mit romney agreed with barack obama so much last
[45:54.400 --> 46:02.480]  night it was shocking says the business insider and i agree here's the club we were together
[46:02.480 --> 46:07.520]  at a humorous event a little earlier and it's nice to maybe be funny this time not on purpose
[46:07.520 --> 46:12.720]  we'll see what happens would you have stuck with mabari uh no i i believe is the president
[46:12.720 --> 46:18.320]  indicated and instead of the time that i supported his his action there we have to do as the president
[46:18.320 --> 46:23.280]  is done i i congratulate him on i'm taking out a summit in london and going after the leadership
[46:23.280 --> 46:29.040]  in al-qaeda well first of all um i i want to underscore the the same point the president made
[46:29.040 --> 46:34.000]  which is that if i'm president united states when i'm president united states we will stand with
[46:34.000 --> 46:40.080]  israel there's no question but the nuclear iran a nuclear capable iran is unacceptable to america
[46:40.080 --> 46:45.600]  crippling sanctions were number one and they do work you're seeing it right now in the economy it's
[46:45.600 --> 46:49.600]  absolutely the right thing to do to have crippling sanctions i'd have put them in place earlier
[46:49.600 --> 46:55.200]  but it's good that we have them i don't blame the administration for the fact that the relationship
[46:55.200 --> 47:00.880]  with with pakistan is strained we had to go into pakistan we had to go in there to get
[47:00.880 --> 47:05.280]  oh some of it land that was the right thing to do and uh it's widely reported that drones are
[47:05.280 --> 47:10.560]  being used in drone strikes and i support that entirely and feel the president was right to up
[47:10.560 --> 47:15.200]  the usage of that technology and believe that we should continue to use it to continue to go after
[47:15.200 --> 47:21.520]  the people who represent a threat to this nation continue to use drones against international
[47:21.520 --> 47:26.800]  law and dozens of countries to get al-qaeda no you mean anybody fighting a takeover by the
[47:26.800 --> 47:34.720]  globalist who you then just call al-qaeda while real al-qaeda our criminal government runs al-qaeda
[47:34.720 --> 47:38.800]  is magic for the new world order they can use them to take our liberty they can use them to attack
[47:38.800 --> 47:45.200]  the serbs the russians uh the uh libians the syrians the iranians while telling i showed
[47:45.200 --> 47:52.400]  articles yesterday where hillary is in the news saying syria is with al-qaeda and that iran is
[47:52.400 --> 47:57.360]  with al-qaeda while they use al-qaeda to attack them i mean that is such an insult to everyone's
[47:57.360 --> 48:05.040]  intelligence and that's why i physically this has never really happened to me i got nauseated last
[48:05.040 --> 48:08.960]  night had an actual psychological response an hour into the debate an hour and ten minutes
[48:09.520 --> 48:16.320]  and had to leave the room and then it went away i mean because it was such a fraud it was all lies
[48:16.320 --> 48:22.720]  and they were debating different variations of lies it's just such an insult to everyone's uh
[48:22.720 --> 48:29.440]  intelligence now here are the articles obama supporters continue threats to riot
[48:29.440 --> 48:34.400]  assassinate romney secret service attention fails to dampen violent twitter comments
[48:35.360 --> 48:40.880]  and then we have a another uh report out here establishment plays race card to bury violent
[48:40.880 --> 48:47.040]  threats by obama supporters and we have links to that showing um should threatening to shoot
[48:47.040 --> 48:51.840]  a presidential candidate in the face earn you a secret service visit and it just goes over that
[48:51.840 --> 48:56.720]  paul watson and paul i know it's in your latest article the mention of the racist stuff but you
[48:56.720 --> 49:00.640]  know what if chris mathews and only people are going to say we're racist if we don't support
[49:00.640 --> 49:07.440]  obama we need to point out the racism that is coming out of the democratic party supporters
[49:07.440 --> 49:16.240]  who think it's cute in culture movies everywhere uh you know it's like a movie with a name like
[49:16.240 --> 49:22.240]  white men can't jump imagine if you made a movie like uh you know something something
[49:22.240 --> 49:29.040]  derogatory and said black men can't this again and it's not that i get what it's all about
[49:30.160 --> 49:36.000]  but i'm tired of it and and i think it should be exposed not hey you're the racist back but
[49:36.000 --> 49:43.760]  hey this is cultural manipulation paul watson your take on that well i mean the media got up in arms
[49:43.760 --> 49:49.840]  a couple of weeks ago if you remember there were a few reports of some old guys hanging empty chairs
[49:49.840 --> 49:56.000]  in their lawns in response in reference to the clinton eastwood rnc speech that was like a big
[49:56.000 --> 50:02.800]  story you know was it a threat against obama and then this happens literally thousands of tweets
[50:02.800 --> 50:08.160]  threatening directly to shoot romney in the face with a shotgun if you look at the latest article
[50:08.160 --> 50:15.040]  that's what they say and not only is it not an issue in the media but we get blamed for it simply
[50:15.040 --> 50:20.560]  for drawing attention to it by think progress kind of like you wrote a story yesterday saying that
[50:20.560 --> 50:25.200]  fukushima had not melted down again and it was a hoax it's admitted to be a hoax today but we're
[50:25.200 --> 50:32.080]  still bad we're still bad yeah because i mean we call it out as a hoax all the experts on
[50:32.080 --> 50:39.040]  fukushima backs us up but because we said it we're bad and we're going tell pro how that works i don't
[50:39.040 --> 50:43.120]  know but and of course we're not talking about the original meltdowns of over a year ago we're
[50:43.120 --> 50:48.880]  talking about the story yesterday that it melted down and blown up and you know it was a hundred
[50:48.880 --> 50:54.960]  times bigger than uh chair noble coming our way uh and of course we've been proven right yet yet
[50:54.960 --> 50:59.120]  again which is why we're bad in fact we did fukushima probably paul that'll be the new thing

[53:09.360 --> 53:13.280]  heard about this yet because the liberal media has been suppressing what has fast become in the
[53:13.280 --> 53:20.240]  most shocking news story of 2012 obama's secret war on coal that could increase your already high
[53:20.240 --> 53:26.160]  power bill as much as 400 percent in coming months as shocking as it sounds it may well be just a
[53:26.160 --> 53:31.520]  matter of time before the lights start going out across america but here's some good news there's
[53:31.520 --> 53:37.600]  an underground video at exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end
[53:37.600 --> 53:44.080]  their slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly the video at exposed123.com has already been banned
[53:44.080 --> 53:49.200]  by google and the liberal media is doing everything in its power to take it down and keep america in
[53:49.200 --> 54:10.800]  the dark so watch it now at exposed123.com before it's too late again that's exposed123.com folks

[54:31.920 --> 54:37.200]  ahead of a special guest joining us i haven't really talked about this yet but it's now in
[54:37.200 --> 54:43.120]  pre-sales and we'll be shipping out in a couple weeks strategic relocation documentary film featuring
[54:43.120 --> 54:49.040]  joles calzen took us five months to produce it it was going to be basically a presentation but it's
[54:49.040 --> 54:54.560]  more of a film and he gets into geopolitical stuff he gets into the globalist master plan
[54:55.280 --> 55:00.480]  it's not just a strategic relocation safe house information and there's like three hours of material
[55:00.480 --> 55:08.160]  on it and it's really amazing you can get the strategic relocation dvd and the book and more
[55:08.160 --> 55:20.080]  at info wars shop.com or by calling 888 253 3139 888 253 3139 okay paul yeah my only point here is
[55:20.880 --> 55:28.880]  i think we should expose the racism angle because media ignores you know racial attacks on romney
[55:28.880 --> 55:35.520]  death threats riots everything and i mean i think we need to expose that because and and then point
[55:35.520 --> 55:40.320]  out the irony that we're supposedly racist because we're pointing this out because obama supporters
[55:40.320 --> 55:45.760]  can do no wrong and and like chris matthew said if you don't support obama you're a racist it's now
[55:45.760 --> 55:50.320]  just down to that i mean it's not that i don't like socialist healthcare i mean i obviously love it
[55:50.320 --> 55:56.480]  it's the fact that he's black i mean that's just ridiculous paul well i just typed in the words
[55:56.480 --> 56:02.240]  romney and cracker on youtube and uh there's literally a ton of them again there's one guy who's
[56:02.240 --> 56:09.200]  actually a black guy who says how you'll call romney a racist but you'll call him a white cracker
[56:09.200 --> 56:14.640]  all day long and then apart from that there's ones that say if romney win i'm at assassinate that
[56:14.640 --> 56:19.760]  cracker romney said kids kids overdosing from marijuana never in my life have i heard such a
[56:19.760 --> 56:25.280]  thing that cracker is stupid there's literally dozens of them so when they try to play the race
[56:25.280 --> 56:30.320]  card i mean it just doesn't work because it's coming from both sides but yeah i mean they pulled
[56:30.320 --> 56:36.960]  the guy over in 2009 secret service visited him after having a sign saying abort obama he was against
[56:36.960 --> 56:42.880]  obama's um abortion policies now the guy a 16 year old kid actually who made a youtube video
[56:42.880 --> 56:50.560]  criticizing obama over his ndaa policy he got a secret service visit so i mean he got to look at
[56:50.560 --> 56:57.760]  the double standard here um left the leftist can you know spout violence all day long nothing happens
[56:57.760 --> 57:02.640]  but when somebody so much as has a sign critical of obama they're the ones getting the secret
[57:02.640 --> 57:07.760]  service visit well clearly if you have an anti-abortion thing saying abort obama's administration
[57:07.760 --> 57:11.920]  that means get rid of his administration i remember that guy got pulled over and taken to jail or
[57:11.920 --> 57:17.760]  whatever uh that was in oklahoma and we've got all these other examples of this going on where
[57:17.760 --> 57:24.480]  somebody puts obama in a spider web with joe biden as a clown it's clearly a funny halloween thing
[57:24.480 --> 57:28.800]  and the secret service comes and the house gets vandalized i mean it's crazy they're using the
[57:28.800 --> 57:34.640]  secret service as a tool of intimidation and then letting obama supporters run around talk about
[57:34.640 --> 57:40.560]  mass murder and death and racism yeah and we're bad for pointing it out we're bad for drawing
[57:40.560 --> 57:46.240]  attention to it we're the ones race baiting when think progress is the one going on about race all
[57:46.240 --> 57:52.000]  the time i mean just look at these latest tweets quote i want to shoot romney in the forehead and
[57:52.000 --> 57:58.960]  skull f him quote lord forgive me but i'll shoot romney dead in his face quote i would love to shoot
[57:58.960 --> 58:05.200]  romney with a shotgun imagine if there were hordes of romney supporters on the on their twitter account
[58:05.200 --> 58:11.840]  saying that it'd be a national need they'd say romney militia planning violent overthrow
[58:11.840 --> 58:17.200]  insurrection call out the military it'd be oh my gosh into the world run for the hills
[58:17.200 --> 58:22.320]  they're terrors now what are we gonna do but instead whenever it's against romney's like well
[58:22.320 --> 58:28.240]  that's reasonable you racist yeah and a lot of these people are even black i mean there were
[58:28.240 --> 58:32.240]  several in the ones this month they're mostly black people but some of them aren't even black and
[58:32.240 --> 58:35.840]  they're they're threatening to kill wrong oh now you're now you're racist against whites
[58:36.560 --> 58:37.920]  why do you hate white people paul
[58:37.920 --> 58:47.200]  this is gcn the genesis communications radio network
[58:50.480 --> 58:55.280]  the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half
[58:55.280 --> 59:00.560]  year on record 78 percent of the midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only corn but
[59:00.560 --> 59:06.320]  soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock
[59:06.320 --> 59:10.800]  is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy
[59:10.800 --> 59:16.080]  to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods
[59:16.080 --> 59:20.800]  from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have to raise
[59:20.800 --> 59:25.600]  prices too now is the time to get your supply i recently increased my supply from e-foods direct
[59:25.600 --> 59:30.160]  because we've all known this was coming you know about their delicious long-term storable foods
[59:30.160 --> 59:34.640]  the fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it stores for 25 years

[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:12.560]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:21.600]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:31.520]  paul watson what's your gut tell you you just enjoyed weeks of riots a year ago or so over in
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:39.280]  england uh over some things a lot smaller than election results uh we see riots now over uh
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:45.120]  you know skateboarders mainly white skateboarders were anti-wife were saying that um you know if
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.120]  they can't get into a movie theater i mean rioting is the new thing to do with these flash mobs
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.640]  that the department of defense has talked so much about including your department of
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.240]  fence over in england uh as well but you know i mean i guess if we talk about riots in france
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:02.960]  we're racist against frenchmen uh i mean this isn't going to work anymore what do you think's
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:08.240]  going to happen if romney does lose i mean i guess the obama supporters will be happy but
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:15.280]  what if romney happens to win which most poll shows he's gonna win um i think if it's narrow
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.080]  and this is what a lot of people are saying that there will be riots i mean whether that's on a
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:25.920]  widespread basis who knows but certainly if it's a very narrow decision which if romney does win it
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:31.280]  looks like it will be narrow because the in trade still has obama quite clearly ahead and he's still
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:36.640]  ahead in the key states but if it does come down to the wire and it's narrow then yeah i think you
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:42.160]  will see some civil unrest because that's how a lot of these leftists react to losing and not
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.040]  getting their way and we don't even support romney i mean listen to that speech last night it was
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:51.200]  insane they were just agreeing on everything you know funding al-qaeda in the middle east
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:55.120]  no i physically got it i physically got nauseated i've never had that happen before
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.960]  yeah so we're not we're non-partisan we're not saying vote for anyone we're just pointing out
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:06.160]  the double standard because we we're often on the end of it we got blamed for richard pop loski
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:11.840]  shooting those cops in pittsburgh when in fact he hated us he said he said that you were a sellout
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.000]  or whatever but well i wasn't a white supremacist so he didn't like me you know no that was the
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.520]  point and and yeah it's yeah we're always trying to retract it all well listen i think you should
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.600]  write an update specifically with all the racism stuff and then put it as updates at the top of
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:36.320]  each article and like you know you know media media covers up uh you know racial attacks on on romney
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:41.920]  or something like that to point out that we're being called racist by chris matthews and others
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.760]  and and the white house run group uh uh think more um think tyranny or whatever it's called
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:55.440]  we need to cover that and show that uh that there's a double standard here well precisely i mean
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:00.080]  we're always on the end of this think progress group because they're an admitted obama front
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:06.000]  you know they say their focus is around quote driving the white house's message and agenda
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:10.400]  and then they claim their non-partisan so why do you think they're attacking us all the time
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.880]  and then they then claim that we're a sideline you know fringe website and yet we get about
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.720]  15 times the amount of traffic they do so it's just fun it's it's fun no it's all part of these
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:28.240]  control freaks lecturing to us that they control reality and just like they're always telling drudge
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.720]  you better stop linking to info wars i mean it's it's like they think they control reality these
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.080]  people are legends in their own minds but they've all got our tax money that's why we can't get them
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:42.640]  out of our lives because they've got a bunch of dependent idiots who are too dumbed down to know
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.760]  what's going on with their slaves and then they've got our tax money to use against us paul well
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.200]  yeah and they've got three million dollar checks from george soros to helton you know if we take
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:59.920]  us what six years of money bombs just to get in what one check they got from george soros and yet
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:05.600]  we're still kicking their butts because at least we try and tell the truth well they are jokes and
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:09.440]  that's why they're gonna try to shut down web freedom and everything that's why obama supporters
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:14.400]  are calling for ban and free speech they can't beat us in ideas and so they want to cheat and it
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:19.280]  isn't going to work your losers everybody's waking up to you and as far as i'm concerned you can go
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:26.320]  right to the devil that's all i have to say and they're always the ones pushing the dhs you know
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:31.920]  right-wing extremist reports that we're all violent and deadly yet when obama supporters come out
[01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:37.040]  publicly and say they want to shoot romney in the head that's nothing and it's not only a non-issue
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.920]  it's our fault for drawing attention to it it's the complete double standard it's insane and it
[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:47.200]  just highlights their rampant hypocrisy well hit them and hit them hard great job paul watson at

[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:35.200]  i am alex jones your host we are here monday through friday again from 12 noon to 3 p.m eastern
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:41.040]  look i want to go to your phone calls if you just joined us uh recapping uh disgusting yesterday
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.800]  i watched the debate romney and obama agreeing with each other on almost everything because
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:51.040]  they're globalist puppets and being told we've got to go into the middle east because of al-qaeda
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:57.120]  when our own criminal government and nato and others run al-qaeda uh just unbelievable and
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:02.880]  now obama supporters continue threats to riot assassinate romney secret service attention
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:08.960]  fails to dampen violent twitter comments that story has gone viral we have another uh report here
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:15.120]  as well establishment plays race card to bury violent threats by obama supporters and it goes
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.440]  on this morning paul wadzing and paul the list of tweets from obama supporters threatening to
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:24.000]  assassinate mint romney and provoke riots obama loses the election which now looks like he may do
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.040]  unless there's election fraud the article has since been picked up by the drudge report but i
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:33.280]  subsequently came across a number of tweets even more violent and offensive than the ones featured
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:37.600]  in the article twitchy has discovered yet more tweets from obama supporters threatening violent
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.840]  murder of romney which include the following and i'm not even going to read these on air
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:49.920]  but uh this is all very premeditated uh people could get you know many years in prison for these
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.760]  and and hey if later they selectively enforce this is going to be brought up to juries when you're
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:10:00.080]  trying to put patriots in jail for no reason or mild stuff this is going to be brought up
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.360]  the establishment has tried to bury the issue by blaming the likes of info wars for drawing
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:09.600]  attention to it because most of the tweets are being made by black people it's our fault and we
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:14.320]  are engaging in race paving apparently according to the likes of george sorrell's run think progress
[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:18.320]  who downplayed the issue it's no big deal to threaten to shoot a presidential candidate in
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:23.760]  the face so long as your skin color is black imagine how this organization which claims it's
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:29.280]  non-partisan yet simultaneously admits its goal is centered around driving the white house's message
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:34.480]  and agenda would react to thousands of tweets threatening violence against obama and it goes
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:40.640]  on here too there's also a lot of racial comments i'm going to get paul watson to update on that it's
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:48.480]  just just just amazing here's fox news post debate msnbc's matthew's claims romney supporters fueled
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:54.240]  by racial hatred of obama listen i would have supported herman kane if he wasn't a former
[01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:00.320]  fed governor if he wouldn't call calling for 9999 this is another nine in there the fike attacks
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:07.440]  and uh you know if he hadn't been caught lying i don't i would vote for i don't care what color
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:12.400]  your skin is and i shouldn't even have to say that point is it's the people constantly talking
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:17.120]  about race like chris mathews are the ones using race for control and more and more people are
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:25.120]  figuring that out okay let me go over some more of the uh election uh news here election 2012
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:32.320]  colorado colorado romney 50 obama 46 that's one of the key battleground states uh that romney or
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:38.560]  obama need to get to win has now reached a 50 mark for the first time in colorado and uh
[01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:44.240]  leads president obama by four in critical swing state that's out of rass mason and a whole bunch
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.320]  other polls are showing the same thing so what do we expect to see well there's election fraud
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.720]  going on out there and we've got bev harris uh coming on to go over some of this but i did
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:00.080]  confirm when i heard about weeks ago forbes is reporting heart inner civics is basically now
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.640]  controlled by the romney family and it controls a lot of the balloting but then there's obama
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.680]  supporting groups uh that also controls some of the other machines so i guess in america it's
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:15.280]  how many machines you control i mean that's a total conflict of interest here's the associated press
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:22.800]  obama romney pumped for the dash to the finish yeah it's uh not long now uh how many days are we
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:31.040]  talking about here like eight days and then six days i mean how many days is that 14 days 13 days
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:40.160]  wow uh can continuing what what's that you popped in my ear there brother yeah no i i know how many
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:46.800]  days it is thank you uh and then continuing here uh sometimes they pop in my ear i heard the mic open
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.760]  but nothing was said so i was asking what was going on uh continuing here obama romney
[01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:57.200]  tangle on al qaeda foreign policy and final presidential debate i mean that's just totally
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:03.760]  ridiculous just uh they're doing nothing but discussing uh uh fantasy there romney won the
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:10.400]  presidential debate by looking presidential obama had a painful case of biden's smile
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:16.800]  that's the one in telegraph uh that's their view of that uh and that was the republican spin i was
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:22.480]  seeing last night uh was that immediately well he looked presidential and obama didn't well that's
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:26.160]  what the democrats tried to say for obama when he lost the first debate was obama was trying to
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:32.000]  look presidential i don't think he lost it as bad as obama lost the first one but i mean again it's
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.280]  all rearranging deck chairs on the titanic uh but i have to say obama i couldn't watch the last 20
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:46.160]  minutes but from when i saw obama won the debate just because well they were interrupting him so
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:52.160]  much too uh so we've got more news on that this is interesting article here on the washington
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:58.480]  examiner walmart air funding obama big time well yeah walmart gets a lot of its money from welfare
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.200]  recipients that's where they a lot of shop and so that's good all the economy that's left now
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:08.560]  for 50 million americans is food stamps and well it's 90 plus million on welfare
[01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:15.040]  so i mean yeah now the washington times uh describing obama donor sam walton as walmart
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:20.400]  chairman in truth the obama donor is walmart air sam walton and it goes on i guess that's
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:24.240]  in the correction at the top here can we stop pretending that brocco obama's can and see
[01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:29.680]  is some grassroots uprising and then it just goes on with them breaking down the fact that the walmart
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:37.200]  air of sam walton is funding that uh so that's just some of the news that we have on that front
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:43.520]  florida republican 71 arrested for penny attack on democratic party offices he reportedly threw
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:47.360]  some pennies on the ground and said here's all i've got left have the rest of my money and he's
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:53.120]  been arrested they're calling it they're calling it an attack uh so that's just some of that news
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:58.640]  and it's all a distraction to a great great extent like i said tomorrow we're going to be
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:04.240]  looking at this with bev harris a black box voting one of the premier experts in election fraud who
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.080]  is nonpartisan to a great extent voter fraud is a felony billboards removed i mean outcry from
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:18.800]  critics and this is a mark salvo story up at info wars dot com and i you know he makes the point
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.520]  that you've got a habit to get a gym membership you've got to get it to rent a movie to purchase a
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:29.680]  six pack of beer or a wager at a blackjack table nothing sort of ridiculous the same standards
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:34.080]  are not required to cast a vote well you got democratic operatives caught saying vote once
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:40.720]  vote often vote twice vote often but feds to probe possible vote fraud in florida because
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:44.800]  some groups are sending letters to people saying if you're an illegal alien don't vote
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:49.760]  trying to hope to act like there's some one order in this country when obviously there isn't
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:55.840]  so that's going on but again democrats like the low level retail fraud they're famous for that
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:01.120]  ballot box stuffing voting repeatedly and some electronic fraud but republicans have proven
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:08.480]  they're the real mac daddy's of that and here's forbs romney's family investment ties to voting
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:15.520]  machine company that could decide the election causing concern and forbs goes over to confirm
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.480]  that romney's ties the voting machine makers raise alarms pretty much the same headlines everywhere
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:26.160]  romney family buys voting machines through bane capital investment supreme court rejects
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:32.640]  early voting appeal show hardener civics based here in austin so i'll give them a heads up
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.680]  we're going to get bev harris on here what she has to say about this then i'm going to try to
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.120]  get an interview with hardener civics or if you don't i'm sending reporters over there so
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:48.000]  get ready for that because you know hardener civics been caught with her pants down repeatedly
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:55.200]  and i really do think that there's an issue with george soros tied into election systems
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:00.880]  uh romney tied into them i mean it's just you know what there's so many laws in this country
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.200]  how about a conflict of interest laws you know where are the ethics in this country
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:12.720]  where where where these big politicians who's the one senator hagel who started one of the
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:19.760]  biggest companies in the in in in the us now you can look this up and then 90 plus percent of the
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:25.120]  vote that got him into office was on machines where he was literally the the head guy and the owner
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:30.960]  not like it's just some investment i mean come on man your people are voting for you on machines you
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:39.920]  own i mean come on it just destroys the integrity of the entire voting system folks i don't know
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:45.360]  who's going to win this and again they're both puppets but it will vary and if obama gets back
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:51.040]  in he will he won't be facing reelection he'll have executive orders he'll have the pardon power
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:54.880]  but that may backfire maybe will really wake up and say no to him
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:01.040]  or he could just totally take over or does the establishment want romney in there
[01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.160]  because he's a new face and people kind of go back to sleep for a while and then he can
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:08.080]  quote get things done like legalize the illegals and all the stuff he's promised to do i don't know
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:13.200]  i don't know uh but i'm telling you at the grassroots people are really you can see it
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:19.040]  you can feel it you can tell romney is ahead in this and the numbers all show that not from
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:25.200]  one polling company or two or three or five or ten it's everyone we've looked at across the wide
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:31.520]  spectrum uh this is going on and so it's not just in popular vote too you know they got major
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.000]  universities like the university of colorado they're at denver uh who's been a stunningly accurate
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.400]  the last 20 years or so in elections saying that romney's who they think's going to win he's going
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:47.120]  to win 76 percent uh 76 chance he'll win the popular vote was the number i saw last week
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:51.760]  week and uh that now he's starting to pick up dead heats are passing in the key battleground
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:58.960]  states uh like colorado so regardless could there be an october surprise if romney wins
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:06.400]  rioting and what will that do i'm not the one saying that's going to happen his supporters
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:10.080]  obama supporters are the ones saying that now if there aren't riots or there are only a few
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:14.800]  little ones the media you can better believe is going to come out and say mr jones you said
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:21.520]  there'd be riots no no no we're saying thousands of people are saying riots and killing and and
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:25.840]  everything else so that's the issue and and so we need to get that straight on the record
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:30.960]  get that straight on the record we're gonna come back and go to your phone calls and then i thought
[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:35.360]  i might tell you about something in case you didn't know it uh it's now admitted what we

[01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:41.520]  to have people backdoor them of course the chips in the defense department stuff has backdoor chips
[01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:46.160]  but the chinese government who's terrible by the way i'm not defending them they didn't put that in
[01:25:46.160 --> 01:25:52.480]  there because they wanted to do it that that's globally standardized you can't shell computer
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:26:00.400]  chips in europe north america you can't shell under federal law a cell phone since 1996 that they
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:05.840]  can't gps triangulate off cell towers and that they can't dial into and well i'd talk about this
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:10.400]  in 96 and get death threats out the wazoo and engineers calling me saying you're not supposed
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:16.160]  to know that it was all in the it was all in the telecommunications acts i'm already covering this
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:22.720]  i said i get to it later it's so frustrating that paul watson i am due the article will you
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:27.760]  guys print that for me please he did one last week again because it finally broke mainstream news
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:33.120]  i never covered it i want to cover it now uh i can call him again and have him send it again
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:41.760]  because uh but the point is is that all of that is going on all of that is happening and you know
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:46.880]  they call it hacks now that oh people go in and they take photos and turn your camera on oh even
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:52.160]  when your phone's off they can be doing it i have nothing to hide the government says well just let
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:57.680]  us watch you but the point is i like my privacy it's reason i have walls it's the reason i live
[01:26:57.680 --> 01:27:03.040]  out in the countryside and so i've known for years in my house all the cameras are covered
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:08.320]  on the computers in my hand and people come over the years and say why is there a sticker over the
[01:27:08.320 --> 01:27:13.200]  camera oh they watch you people always laugh at me even though it's admitted that public schools
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:20.160]  are doing it you name it it's going on everywhere it's happening everywhere all right i'm gonna shut
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:24.400]  up and go to your calls let's get one in before we go to break here kirk in illinois you're on the
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:33.920]  air hey i'll say nice job getting through the news without going on a rant that was pretty good yeah i
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:39.520]  can understand you call her there they were talking in my ear go ahead oh yeah hey i just had that nice
[01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.680]  job actually being able to get through the news without going on a rant that was pretty good
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:49.600]  yeah i'm trying my best here hey i also you know i'm i'm not a twitter user but uh and i did read
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:55.600]  that article about paul joseph watching today and i'm just wondering how is it possible that all these
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:01.120]  obaminoids can spell assassinate correctly when everything else is a big mess right could this
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:05.840]  be like a provocateur opera anything like that well we've talked at length about that and and
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:11.040]  noted that in the earlier articles uh i've learned to tell dummy accounts that you know they're usually
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:15.680]  a few months old a few days old we'll have a few videos on them that aren't theirs we went in and
[01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:20.320]  drilled into these accounts and undoubtedly now this is a big national story i will imagine there
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:25.840]  are some spoofs is what it's called uh spoofing uh i would imagine that some of that is happening
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:31.520]  but you you can't spoof a two-year-old twitter account with 5000 tweets with photos of people's
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:37.360]  family and you go look it is a real family it's a whole history uh so i know the secret service
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:44.240]  has gone to real people's houses uh the uh the news reported that last week uh these are real people
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:49.200]  also the secret service actually is doing something although probably not enough
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:54.960]  well yes it was reported as we said by the weekly standard and others the secret service has
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:29:00.480]  responded we've had listeners who've had family members arrested for it but they're releasing
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:06.400]  them but they are arresting them and my point is they may be charged but you separately have the
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:11.920]  george soros media implying that none of this is happening and it's not real or we're racist or we're
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:19.200]  liars yeah okay all right well regardless even if it is a provocateur up i'm not gonna live in fear of
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:25.840]  it oh well it's not about living in fear it's about asking what's going to happen if there are riots
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:32.960]  you see what i'm saying yeah because we have massive preparation for riots being carried on by
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:38.240]  homeland security level never foreseen i'm saying it may be provocative they may let this spread as
[01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:45.040]  a provocateur action do you get my drift now i do i bless you thank you sir all right we're gonna
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:50.480]  come back try to rattle through more calls jeff zack jim calling bill others stay with us we're on

[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:06.400]  as a distraction we're going to be looking at that but by the way this film took about five
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:12.560]  months to make and i was going to call it just a presentation but it really is a film
[01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:19.920]  and we're just now getting around to the trailer for it right now the film is actually done
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:25.040]  it's been manufactured we're going to start shipping it out in a couple weeks strategic

[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:11.760]  had built a whole bunch of different retreats here over the years because it's one of the only
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:16.560]  safer places in texas and then i was asking about east texas and he knew everything about it i was

[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:57.120]  or facebook allows for its partners they allow them into your private stuff they sell it uh
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:38:04.800]  and then you get to be part of the porn factory that's like a 1984 wenson's torturing uh
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:10.080]  or bryan's torturing wenson and he says he says well he goes of course we know you're
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:14.960]  having sex with that woman uh we've got all the the film footage of it and he goes what you do
[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:19.040]  with that he goes oh it's being recycled for proletariat he is being being shown in the porno
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:25.920]  theaters or the pros the general public so you're a party member you're not allowed to have
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:30.880]  extramarital sex but the general public they're allowed to it's only the politicians and minions
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:34.480]  that aren't they always keep them in a greater tyranny that's why those of you that like to
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:38.800]  live under tyranny those of you that think you're going to get power out of it you're you're blowing
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.440]  off your own feet you know i had lou rockwell on yesterday and always paraphrase uh you know different
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:49.520]  uh parables and and and and allegories and he corrected me well he didn't correct me he unknowingly
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:57.920]  corrected me i'm always telling the the fable of the frog and the scorpion and i always talk about
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:04.640]  the scorpion says hey carry me across the river the scorpion says the frog carry me across the
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:09.440]  river and the frog says no you you'll you'll you'll sting me and he goes no i won't i promise so
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:15.600]  so they get to the other side and the scorpion stings him and the frog rolls over dying says
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:19.840]  why'd you do that he says well i'm a scorpion it's my nature but but but but rockwell told it
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.880]  better i was saying you know the elites are destroying their own future they're getting
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:27.600]  rid of their own due process they're going to create a hellish world and rockwell said well
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:31.200]  yeah that's the frog in the scorpion where the frog asked the scorpion take me across and
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:35.200]  the frog says but you'll sting me and the scorpion says i promise i won't and halfway across the
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:42.000]  scorpion stings him they both are sinking you know beginning to drown and he says why'd you do that
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:48.640]  he says well i'm a scorpion so that is the proper fable that the proper allegory that's that's what's
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:54.880]  going on here and but this is what elites do throughout history smart elites even if they're
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:40:00.240]  corrupt don't get rid of the checks and balances and don't engage in this type of stuff and don't
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:07.280]  create giant welfare hordes roam went through all this babelon went through this every culture has
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:14.640]  gone through this the aztecs had welfare they went through this and we're now going through this
[01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:19.600]  and the globalists actually write white papers admitting they know they're doing this but they
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:24.640]  say they hate humanity so much they just want to see everything go up in flames so they're
[01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:31.760]  setting up an elaborate world government to make sure they destroy everything linen wrote poetry
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:37.680]  about wanting to blow the earth up i mean these are these are mentally ill people and and and you
[01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:44.640]  have to understand that and they have to be stopped okay they have to be stopped i'm not afraid of
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:49.760]  dying i'm afraid of species death i'm afraid of not having great great great great grandchildren
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:55.520]  because i love humanity and the interactions and our art and our literature and what we've done i
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:01.120]  have this connection to the past i can feel but also understand intellectually to my ancestors
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:07.360]  who hand by hand touched through the people that came before me right back to them you have a direct
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:12.640]  physical connection to your ancestors six seven thousand years ago you have a direct connection
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:19.680]  to your ancestors but you also have a connection to those coming in the future and i look for
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:25.440]  forward into the future and see a foggy outcome i don't know if we're going to make it that doesn't
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:30.480]  mean i can tell you know what's going to happen in the future or that i'm a fortune teller what
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:34.080]  i'm saying is i intellectually have enough knowledge of history and where things are going
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:39.520]  that my electrochemical supercomputer that god gave me you have one too just use it can look out
[01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:47.760]  into the future and i i i don't see a clear outcome for our species i i see some type of survival
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:54.480]  of the species but it may be irrevocably damaged and see the globalists are into vandalizing things
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:01.120]  that they they're into ugliness and see i'm into stepping on them i don't take pleasure in crushing
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:09.600]  evil it must be crushed it must be crushed it must be crushed and if you don't have a basic
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:15.280]  understanding of that at a fundamental core level if evil doesn't upset you if persecution of widows
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:21.120]  and children and the innocence and if bullies and injustice doesn't get you angry at a fundamental
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:25.440]  level well then you aren't living and so many people talk about how unhappy they are at record
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:31.760]  numbers of course you're living in fantasy football and fantasy sports and fantasy culture
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:39.760]  and fantasy tv and video games and fantasy you're not living in the real world you're not satisfied
[01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:48.000]  the matrix can never deliver long term it can deliver up front and you can give yourself to
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000]  it and for a while it feels okay but down the road it gets very nasty let me tell you what's
[01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:03.520]  going to deliver you to valhalla reality biting into it the real grit the real visceral thing
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:09.760]  this is what's real this okay not this fake globalist projection where they're where the
[01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:14.080]  you think when you're awake that the propaganda is ridiculous and stupid it's not meant for you
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:19.840]  you're awake it's designed for the zombies you can't get mad at the public that they're totally
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:25.440]  dumb down and don't know which end is up they are under scientific attack thank god almighty
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:31.280]  thank your lucky stars think whatever it is you think that you're awake to a certain extent
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:36.800]  you should be horrified by the dumb down public i see some people get off on how dumb people are
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.960]  makes you feel superior yeah i mean i'll tell you something they will drag everybody down you
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:46.560]  better not feel superior over people floundering around i see people that feel superior all the
[01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:51.520]  time over people that aren't as smart or aren't as informed aren't as successful as them and it's
[01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:57.520]  disgusting it's disgusting and it's disgusting when little people look up at those that are
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:44:02.480]  successful and pull them down as well it's disgusting and it's inhuman and it's a lower
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:06.640]  order and it's what we need to recognize as bad and say no to it i'm done ranting

[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:19.440]  debate last night it was it was like watching two demons trading lies about fairy tales

[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:28.400]  probably why i was getting nauseated that could describe it i i'm going to tweet that right now
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:33.280]  gosh you finally said it that is exactly what i was thinking and i couldn't say it last i was like
[01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:37.600]  i had some mental block to the point of let me just see was it was so disgusting i had to
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:45.840]  let me tweet this of course my tweets not loading my little spy phone here say that again
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:56.880]  the debate was watching let me see if i'll do it the debate was like promise it's always too
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:07.280]  short was like watching two demons trading lies about fairy tales to the that's it two demons
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:16.000]  clear genius two demons anyways keep going go ahead make your point so anyway yeah and i just it was
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:21.280]  i just to me was like they were competing for the america you know for the soul of america
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:26.320]  it was like a contest of of liars you know who's the best liar boy he was really a convincing
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:33.200]  liar i don't know maybe obama was a better liar you know that's just what it looked it just i don't
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:38.720]  know there's just disgusting you know i'm not just saying this that's one of the most concise
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:44.080]  almost haiku like poetry you just said because i was trying to figure out how to tweet last night
[01:45:44.080 --> 01:45:48.560]  in a short enough span and i had all these drafts because it kept denying me it was always a little
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:55.360]  too long how do you say this is all a fraud and then they're debating little intricacies of the
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:46:00.640]  lies and how do you say there's scum on top of it and that's it the debate was like watching two
[01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:12.240]  demons trading lies about fairy tales that's it yeah so well i'm looking for a job too i just lost
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:22.160]  my job i mean houston you still hiring hey uh why don't you start writing some pieces uh
[01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:26.960]  and submitting them to us and if they're good you know write us five six seven pieces you might end
[01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:32.640]  up getting to be a you know a writer that we you know pay part time to write or something my problem
[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:36.560]  is i don't have the capital to hire more people you know i'd thank god the money bomb was a success
[01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:40.480]  want to thank all the listeners we're gonna be able to do some big things uh if if the lord's
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:45.280]  willing it keeps blessing us uh in the fight against the globalist thanks to uh most of five
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:48.880]  hundred thousand dollars came in sounds like a lot it's not with tv equipment and up links but it
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:53.360]  should be enough to do the job so thank you folks you're not behind us you're right beside us but
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:58.000]  yeah i mean i wish i could hire 50 more people the other problem is then managing folks and all
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.720]  the things that come with that but uh we're trying our best here just keep praying for us any other
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:08.800]  points about the debate you know that was really the main thing it just was it was it was hard to
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:15.680]  watch it was the lies were just so it was unbelievable it was it was like you said that
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:21.760]  you know it was like and you're in the matrix so and well it was just it was just all but but
[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:26.800]  then in real time you could see obama throwing in provisos finally right and by the way we don't
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:31.040]  want to arm the wrong guys there while they're arming al-qaeda they're already getting the next
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:36.880]  story ready you know to keep bombing after they've gotten rid of a solid it's a perpetual war plan
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:41.520]  to actually just deindustrialize and wreck those poor countries and then and then you realize
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:47.440]  you're under the same attack here and it's just so sick it's like it's a nightmare that never ends
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:55.680]  and it's like why can't people see obama was like some weird space alien debating count Dracula is
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:48:00.960]  how my wife described it last night and obama looked like he had jaundice and romney looked completely
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:10.800]  insane anything else sir and and black magic basically no but i mean you're right they were
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:15.360]  there like like two vampires fighting over the woman they've gotten the ditch you know they're
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:19.520]  you know they've run the wagon off the road and they've killed the horseman driving the wagon
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:23.840]  and then they've got the young maiden knocked out in the back and and and rindfield's running
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:28.160]  around there and it's it's two counteraculous fighting over who gets to shuck all the blood out
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:35.680]  of her i hear your brother great points yep the debate was like watching two demons trading lies
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:43.360]  about fairy tales yeah that's it because it's lies within lies uh zak in tennessee you're on
[01:48:43.360 --> 01:48:51.120]  the air go ahead yes uh in my opinion it was obama the un uniter versus romney the builder
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:56.800]  burg bill businessman and uh i was just gonna ask two questions if i could after that go ahead brother
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:02.400]  they're gonna be uh we heard the clip you played earlier where uh romney was praising the use of
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:08.720]  u.s. drones foreign formally will he increase their use both foreign and domestically and uh
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:14.160]  also post-election will obama or romney sign on today he went gun grab that they previously
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:18.160]  pushed under the table yeah they're both gonna sign on to it that's why the globalist have an
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:22.880]  agenda that's why they agreed so much on foreign policy uh that's why they had trouble even fighting
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:30.480]  with each other because it's all smoke and mirrors but uh the air force has 20 000 drones
[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:37.280]  assigned to the cia it's it's 20 000 last time i checked 20 000 operable and they're in the news
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:42.560]  today calling for more drones and yes the plan is to have them operate everywhere weaponized
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:49.760]  uh and to have blimps chattered over every city uh it's just a hellish future i mean look
[01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:56.320]  it's crazy people with unlimited power that we're funding who want to play god uh who who are you
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.720]  genesis that also love to poison our food supply i mean you couldn't come up with a more sickening
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:08.000]  uh perspective than what we're facing right and uh also or this is by 2016 is that when
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.920]  they're allowed to use them uh officially domestically that's what i've heard or uh
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:17.280]  have you heard anything else sir they're already rolling them out uh in the next uh it was 60 something
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:24.720]  no it's 46 billion uh that they put in the funding uh for domestic drones in the f a a funding uh
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:30.240]  just uh last year uh it was earlier this year 30 000 drones lawson post reported on that's the
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:36.320]  main source uh and uh they're buying them everywhere and already weaponizing them so it's it's here
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:42.960]  and uh they're also uh gonna have ground robots too i mean they're already the street lights in

[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:34.000]  that not only one is this not a a new thing um but as a matter of fact yeah i'm i'm a pretty young
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.920]  guy here when i was 18 a couple years ago um and go into college at uh the ohio state university
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:46.320]  right i had a a tweet that i actually put out one day um actually on the 24th of september
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:54.240]  2010 that uh was i had had a particularly bad day i tweeted that i was hungry angry and that uh
[01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:59.200]  i was frustrated enough to uh you know potentially shoot some apple store employee i was being uh
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:04.240]  using hyperbole but they had to take it serious because of the shootings or they would have but
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:08.400]  here's the deal there was a guy when that cop shot the poor black guy in the back that was bound in
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:14.240]  san francisco and then the cop got off i think it was like a year in jail a guy on my site said
[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:20.480]  somebody ought to kill that guy close quote and they went arrested him got you know the subpoena
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:28.160]  got our records got him and took him to jail and he got a big prison sentence so my message to people
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:33.840]  is this stuff's all being watched i mean i you know what people all the time threaten me online
[01:57:33.840 --> 01:57:36.880]  and i'm not really afraid of him because i know cowards do that if you're really going to go after
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:41.040]  somebody you don't threaten it but the point is there's all these punks that think in the internet
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:45.600]  world they can just threaten people all day and that's not how it works i'm sorry go ahead
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:50.560]  and absolutely i was just gonna say what i found amazing about that is you know i i tweeted that
[01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:55.280]  out on like 24th of september and that was yeah i at best i mean that is a threat i guess and you
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:58.400]  know that probably should have been some of the reason i've even left it in there is because
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:03.520]  and that was a threat against uh an employee of a store that i was upset with and i had the
[01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:10.720]  department of homeland security with the university police department um come into the storm that i
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:15.200]  was living at now interestingly enough i wasn't there at the time let's see there you go it
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:20.240]  shouldn't have been the feds the feds are taking everything over through the threat fusion centers
[01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:23.920]  and then they're always involved because i know they can say well it's the internet it's federal
[01:58:23.920 --> 01:58:30.800]  well then everything's federal so so how how the story end well i ended up they uh you know they
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:34.960]  they came in with university police officer and a homeland security agent and everything and sat
[01:58:34.960 --> 01:58:45.360]  down with me in the lobby of the dorm i want to hear the rest of this you are listening to gcn visit

[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:21.680]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:28.640]  you know i don't get into the pettiness of the internet a lot unless it's to illustrate the
[02:00:28.640 --> 02:00:34.240]  the the the pettiness i was just pointing out there's all these tough guys on the internet
[02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:39.200]  who don't even use their real names or whatever a caller calls in and says the debate was like
[02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:43.760]  watching two demons trading lines about fairy tales i say hey that's great i'm going to tweet
[02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:49.840]  out what you just said i announced it on air i tweeted 15 minutes ago or start talking about
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:55.600]  a 15 minutes ago someone obviously heard that tweeted it before i ever finished it
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:59.200]  because i waited till i proofread her in the break and sent it out they tweeted like a two
[02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:03.440]  minutes before me so there could be a new controversy of how i stole a tweet that will
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:08.160]  punch it up on screen for people who are watching on prison planet dot tv it's not about two demons
[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:14.560]  uh you know trading lies about fairy tales that's that's not what we're talking about no it's how
[02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:18.720]  alex is bad in fact i should be put in prison for this uh it says that the debate was like
[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:21.760]  watching two demons trading lines about fairy tales i told the guy i'm going to tweet out what
[02:01:21.760 --> 02:01:27.600]  he said on air then this one goes uh initiated demons they are i guess in the yoda style talk
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:34.080]  and this guy says you look at this tweet from at f u c t not cool bro well i'm not cool i'm just bad
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:42.640]  see so so i tweet this out after and obviously this guy over here heard the caller tweeted
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:47.200]  at the same time and then i'm reported on for stealing tweets and that and that's how this
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:53.440]  craziness works uh just absolutely amazing uh so there you go um but you can follow us at
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:02:01.040]  twitter.com forward slash real alex jones or of course at prisonplanet.tv or streaming video right
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:10.320]  now uh just mindlessness uh let's go back to jim in ohio show you shout a thing about i was at
[02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:16.320]  this apple store i'm so mad i could shoot that person and homeland security shows up uh at your
[02:02:16.320 --> 02:02:21.760]  dorm go ahead and finish the story quickly yeah well anyways they you know they showed up and uh
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:26.640]  you know were sitting me down and you know giving me this talking to about how i i shouldn't be doing
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:31.520]  this and that whatever and how serious it was and that you know you could be around this and
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:38.080]  all these different things well in any case you know i i didn't even put the dots together but
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:44.080]  turns out that they were probably most likely doing this in advance of uh obama coming to
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:49.840]  campus not you know uh three weeks or so later after this meeting they had with me which someone
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:52.800]  mentioned to when i was telling the story later that you know it was probably because the president
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:57.440]  was coming i didn't even catch it i know yeah exactly they got data mining deals that scoop
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:02.320]  everything up it's an incredible technocracy good to hear from you my friend uh let's go to
[02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:09.360]  collin in georgia you're on the air welcome how you doing alex good welcome okay um first
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:16.800]  up i think i have two things first is um what's your uh take on the anonymous movement well
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:21.200]  anytime you hear an anonymous movement there's going to be good people and bad people now the
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:29.040]  government can project onto all hackers false flags or things they do to set up hacking in general
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:35.600]  and they can also blame attacks on anonymous and then so anonymous takes credit anytime
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:41.040]  something's anonymous it's perfect for black bag operations cloak and dagger type stuff
[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:46.800]  where they can generally blame hackers period for stuff the globalists have done to bring in
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:53.680]  their cyber security takeover system well i know what they've done with operation blackout and
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:58.880]  stop and stop and type and stuff they get some pretty good things but uh yeah but see that's
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:04.080]  just because now anything good will be attributed to anonymous anything bad will be because it's
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:08.000]  just anonymous it's like saying hey we need to occupy wall street against the corrupt banks
[02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:13.280]  all these good people show up then the democrats come who put the call out through their operatives
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:17.200]  and try to take it over when that didn't work they arrested everybody and shut it down
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:24.000]  in a federal coordinated raid nationwide soon i'm saying it's a projection yeah okay well okay
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:30.560]  that brings me to my second question i saw a video on youtube about operation b that they're
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:37.360]  trying to execute and they're actually declaring war against the united states government yeah that
[02:04:37.360 --> 02:04:41.360]  that's because they're listen listen they're trying to pass cyber security obama's getting
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:45.520]  ready with his executive order to take the web over i'll get i don't know about the particular
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:51.680]  operation but guaranteed they launched stuxnet against iran and so they wanted to take the
[02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:58.160]  web over because of stuxnet okay we don't have a us government we have a banker government okay that
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:06.480]  alex jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers the prognosis for the entire planetary

[02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:42.800]  brian tui here in a moment i've interviewed him on the nightly news but i wanted to get him back
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:50.960]  on the full radio show he wrote the fixes in the show biz manipulations of the nfl mlb nba nhl
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:57.120]  and nascar and uh the fact that you know gambling basically runs the whole deal and i know people
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:03.040]  know this to a certain extent but you realize how staged and how fake and what a fraud it is
[02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:09.760]  and how taxpayers subsidize it uh here's a article uh i was at the washington post
[02:09:11.200 --> 02:09:18.080]  playing by the nfl's tax exempt rules uh here's another report on business week in stadium building
[02:09:18.080 --> 02:09:24.880]  spree us taxpayers lose four billion and you know that's my big problem if you want to have
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:31.200]  formula one that's one thing outside austin but why on god's green earth are they being
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:36.240]  given basically total tax exemption and a bunch of it paid for on top of that by taxpayers
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:43.280]  while the guy that owns formula one gives you know just earlier this year he gave one daughter
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:48.480]  what was it four billion dollars and the other one a bunch of money as well i mean and again i'm all
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:53.040]  i'm all people making money if it's done in the free market but it's almost always some crony rip
[02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:57.440]  off and then those are guys always lecturing lower middle class and middle class people we
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:02.000]  got to pay more taxes because we're rich and we're bad when really the money's just taken
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:09.040]  and given to these guys so that's just uh some of the news and information i have on that front
[02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:13.040]  we'll be talking about that in a second uh going to info wars dot com punch that up on
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:18.880]  screen for people watching uh at prison planet dot tv obama supporters continue threats to riot

[02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:40.080]  stage cyber attacks then blaming on anonymous because anonymous is easy to blame it on because
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:45.680]  it's anonymous also world bank luminary breed smaller people to increase metabolic efficiency

[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:05.200]  you're in the sports my kids are on swim team stuff like that you know soccer all that i love
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:10.320]  sports if it's your team if you're in it and if it's old people playing softball i'll go watch it
[02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:16.240]  but because it's about them it's about us little guys uh it's so sick though when kids only have
[02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:22.160]  lance armstrong on their wall you know why don't they have uh you know fearless felix you know the
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:32.160]  guy jumping from 24 miles up there uh some folks mailed us some um 1950s books about the founding
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:36.640]  fathers and davie crocket and all this stuff and i was reading the back of that what listeners
[02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:41.760]  sent me i gave to my son it was all the incredible stuff they were reading about madame currie and
[02:12:41.760 --> 02:12:46.400]  about and you read them they're entertaining books too about history that's how i got into it and i
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:51.440]  think about the average kids today it's either sports or it's video games at least sports is in
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:55.040]  the real world to some extent and i'm not even saying video games are all bad except these
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:59.760]  virtual realities and it's all people will talk about or you or you go to the bar to pick up food
[02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:04.000]  you've ordered a restaurant and men look at you go hey alex jones how you doing hey man how about
[02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:08.640]  the game blah blah and it's all just fake it's not real i don't want to talk about a bunch of
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:15.120]  overpaid arrogant professional athletes that think they're god and are egomaniacs okay i'm sick
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:21.760]  of people that are egomaniacs i'm sick of people that are that get off on all this narcissism
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:28.000]  never take my aggression and my anger and my focus is narcissism it's the opposite's why
[02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:32.560]  i can't stand being told how great i am i know how transitory i am i know the bigger they are the
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:38.560]  harder they fall i'm incredibly humble i'm angry at the globalist and i'm a fan of human ingenuity
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:43.280]  and passion and beauty and discovery and everything i see being forced fed by the mainstream media
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:49.520]  is to dumb us down and is ugly it's ugly and i had to sit here for years knowing what a dirt bag
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:56.080]  lance armstrong was but you know i mean my parents have been at tour de france in the box with you
[02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:00.880]  know with lance armstrong's family okay i'm not going to get into the you know whole thing how
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:04.720]  that ended up happening a few times but the point is and i didn't really hear much from them i heard
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:12.400]  it from other people okay i mean lance armstrong lives in austin okay and uh and and i did not talk
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:16.160]  to the big wall street guy that knows lance armstrong it was on a board with him how much
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:21.200]  lance armstrong hates me then i found out from somebody else uh at one of his uh i'm not even
[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:26.960]  going to say where the point is did i ever talk about lance armstrong no the last few years with
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:33.040]  a scandal because lance armstrong doesn't amount to a hill of beans ladies and gentlemen another
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:40.720]  shelf-centered ego maniac who treats his wife and his kids and everybody around him like trash
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:46.160]  who treats his girlfriends like trash who who treats everybody like dirt who promises people
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:52.640]  things and doesn't deliver okay he's nobody folks he's a nobody and i never talked about
[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:57.360]  lance armstrong i could tell you a lot of stories about lance armstrong i'm not going to do it but
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:08.720]  it's disgusting it's disgusting disgusting okay and but what's more disgusting is it's now come out
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:14.160]  but it's back of the paper that of course the big international associations and different races he
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:17.760]  was in knew he was doping and when it would come when he would get caught it would get shut down
[02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:23.200]  and lance told his team don't worry i'm getting it all fixed because he was making the sport from
[02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:31.120]  obscure to incredibly giant and popular he was expanding it and so they let it build up and
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:35.440]  then is it oozed out and stuff well now they're going to let it come out so the system can act
[02:15:35.440 --> 02:15:41.360]  like it's a good it's a ritual like burning uh you know for tiny stock stuff that wasn't even
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:48.000]  an impropriety in my view researching it martha stewart okay this is what they do oh martha stewart
[02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.080]  the average person thinks she's rich she's nothing compared to the globalists let's burn her while
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:57.520]  you know globalists can steal trillions that's my issue show this ceremony of building up lance
[02:15:57.520 --> 02:16:03.680]  armstrong and then destroying him i want no part of it i want no part of it uh lance armstrong is a
[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:10.480]  joke another inflated ego brought down to size uh another life that's worthless i mean it's just
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:16.880]  it's an empty husk pushing the cancer industry raising money to to create more expensive treatments

[02:24:14.960 --> 02:24:18.880]  doing here when you wait try to wake somebody up when you give them a copy in fore's magazine when
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:24.720]  you send them a link to one of our films online that's a message in a bottle and i say fire and
[02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:28.640]  forget to start dropping the messages in a bottle and put them out there and people that all they
[02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:32.960]  could talk about video games and sports you know what i'm not saying you're bad because you like it
[02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:39.360]  but do something else some of the time it's so sick all these self-propelled stomachs wandering around
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:44.800]  in their in their football jerseys acting tough and anyways i'm ranting brian too he is on the
[02:24:44.800 --> 02:24:51.600]  line with us even here in my rant the last 15 minutes brian uh what's your take on the points
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:56.560]  i've been making and this is a short segment long segment coming up boil down the fraud you've
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:02.320]  discovered as a sports fan as a sports writer and uh you know why you've basically turned against
[02:25:02.320 --> 02:25:09.040]  this unholy thing well the big thing is is that i found out that professional sports can legally
[02:25:09.040 --> 02:25:13.600]  fix their own games they can fix their own outcomes and they would want to do this because
[02:25:13.600 --> 02:25:18.000]  obviously you'd give them more fan interest you know higher tv ratings more ad revenue and thus
[02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.160]  make a more profit and that's the scary part that's the part i think fans should really take away
[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:27.040]  from all this is that there's no law protecting them from the professional sports leagues and
[02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:30.960]  like you point out there's really no oversight on the professional sports leagues either i mean
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:34.880]  the media didn't do anything really against flance armstrong and in a very real way they
[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:38.800]  still kind of protect them and that's the same thing with professional sports you look at the
[02:25:38.800 --> 02:25:44.000]  nfl the nba major league baseball they're kind of protected by the sports media because in fact the
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:49.680]  sports media funds them i mean the nfl makes nearly six billion dollars a season from the likes of
[02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:55.760]  fox cbs espn all these major networks and nba makes a couple million dollars a year for or i
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:26:00.560]  should say billion dollars a year from espn so are they really going to investigate these sports
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:05.680]  leagues are they going to really investigate the athletes when they know exposing such corruption
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:09.920]  would actually hurt their own bottom line so they're kind of all in this together and i think
[02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:14.880]  they're in this together to make money and in a sense if they have to do the fans do so they will
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:21.440]  and that's what makes it a joke it's a big gambling casino rigged to fleece idiots and the public
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:26.960]  talks about the sports teams like it's them like oh austin so bummed out we lost our seven
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:32.720]  turd to frances you didn't lose anything you morons go ahead well that's exactly right the big thing
[02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:37.280]  is is you hear this when you listen to sports radio when fans call in they'll say we as if
[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:41.600]  they're part of the team well you're not part of the team you may be funding the team and maybe
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:45.840]  funding the league because you're giving them so much money and so much of your time but the fact
[02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:50.560]  is is that you know researchers and psychologists have studied this and they've shown that people
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:54.320]  do get some benefits from watching professional sports because it does release some of their
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:26:59.600]  anger which is probably good for the government and it's also you know it it's one of those things
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:04.400]  that makes up their personal identity so when it takes the tribalism that a man would use to be
[02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:10.000]  successful in business you're supposed to be angry and warlike in business not cheating but focused
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.480]  you're supposed to be focused in politics you're supposed to be informed and know about all the
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:19.600]  ins and outs of government instead you know all the ins and outs of the soap opera of you know
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:25.280]  what size jockstrap the the quarterback wears well exactly i'm sure there's guys you know in
[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:30.000]  chicago near where i live who could name the starting lineup of the 1984 chicago cubs but they
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.720]  couldn't tell you who their alderman is who their mayor is who their senators are any of that i mean
[02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:38.560]  i think even like last night you had the debates on which were kind of a joke because you can't
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:43.600]  include a third party candidate at all in these because the republicans democrats own the debates
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:47.840]  but yet how many people were instead watching you know game seven of the national league you know
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:51.840]  championship series or how many people are watching monday night football as opposed to informing
[02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:57.120]  themselves maybe more about their own government sure and i mean again it's one thing you know to
[02:27:57.120 --> 02:28:01.920]  pop a beer watch a baseball game but it's the mental illness of getting more and more obsessed and
[02:28:01.920 --> 02:28:06.960]  it's the parallel in history that as societies collapse they always get more and more into sports
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:11.680]  it's just a major red flag well and that's what the romans did i mean they used to glad either
[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:16.480]  contest to distract the populace and today it's almost the same thing with you know the national
[02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:20.400]  football league they're almost the modern day gladiators they're in publicly funded stadiums
[02:28:20.400 --> 02:28:25.760]  they get taxed tax exempt status for having these stadiums they're actually the nfl is just revealed
[02:28:25.760 --> 02:28:31.040]  they're actually a non-profit organization not the teams but the nfl the court the headquarters
[02:28:31.040 --> 02:28:35.520]  are not a profit organization how is that possible and like their commissioner is making 10 million
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:39.520]  dollars a year you're getting 10 million dollars a year to run a non-profit organization is that
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:44.480]  something wrong there well that's where all this is going they teach harvard courses for ceo's
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:48.400]  everything's going to be tax-free foundations and they're going to run all the businesses and
[02:28:48.400 --> 02:28:52.960]  really make profits but then none of us are going to be allowed to be in that we all pay taxes to
[02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:58.480]  give it to them well exactly and i think that's another thing that makes it kind of proves that
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:02.960]  the fact that these leagues can fix their own games where it may only benefit one team but in
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:08.640]  effect benefits the entire league the nfl shares 75 to 80 percent of all the revenue they take in
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:13.040]  they take in nearly 10 billion dollars a season and most of it is distributed equally to all the
[02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:18.160]  teams so if one team succeeds if you have like tim tebow succeeding and millions of people are
[02:29:18.160 --> 02:29:22.640]  tuning in to watch tebow and they're buying tebow jerseys well that's not just profiting one team
[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:28.320]  it's profiting them all well it's just sad to see men especially you who don't have any life
[02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:35.680]  anything anything they've conquered any destiny they're just these empty men who act tough all day
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:40.880]  and watch sports and think it's a manly to know all these details meanwhile their kids
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:45.520]  water their drinking has a chemical weapon in it and i have the white house science are saying
[02:29:45.520 --> 02:29:49.600]  it's to hurt your child and they don't care they they beat their kids brains out for sports

[02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:52.320]  article about the massive waves of theft by tsa and then i was reading about police all over the
[02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:56.880]  country are now taking cash out of people's wallets that's even legal even if it's in the bank
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:04.560]  withdraw pack with the receipt they're taking it uh thousands of dollars um and that's what the new

[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:30.720]  it's freedom that drones got a weapon system if you don't lick the boots of it now let's let's go
[02:34:30.720 --> 02:34:37.280]  back to brian tully author of the fixes in the show business manipulations of the nfl mlb nba
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:43.360]  nhl nascar you name it and again you know about fixing and boxing all of it i want to ask him
[02:34:43.360 --> 02:34:48.240]  what he from his research in the fbi files what the most fixed stuff is the the the numbers of
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:53.680]  billions we're talking about here and the societally this is obviously getting worse where is it going
[02:34:53.680 --> 02:35:00.960]  like forced sports viewing i mean how bad will the cult of this situation get well which question
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:04.960]  do you want me to answer first you got the floor break it down i mean you know your greatest hits
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:10.320]  of the loving fraud that all the schmucks and suckers and people loved toadie around and be
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:15.520]  ripped off by the mafia that runs sports well the fbi files for example that i have there's over
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:20.400]  400 of them and they cover investigations of violations of the sports bribery act which is
[02:35:20.400 --> 02:35:25.680]  passed in 1964 and basically makes it illegal for someone to pay someone else to fix the outcome
[02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:30.480]  of the game and the files cover everything from horse racing to boxing to college football
[02:35:30.480 --> 02:35:36.400]  college basketball the nba the nfl and major league baseball and the scary thing is is in
[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:41.040]  1999 which is the last time anybody did any sort of estimate on how much money is gambled
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:45.920]  illegally in the united states right now on sports they estimate anywhere from 80 billion to
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:51.680]  380 billion dollars is wagered illegally each year on professional sports now this is nearly
[02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:57.360]  even the low estimate the conservative estimate of 80 billion is nearly four times the amount of money
[02:35:57.360 --> 02:36:03.040]  the nfl nba national hockey league and major league baseball make combined they made about 25
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:07.600]  billion dollars last year well professional sports gamblers are betting more than that maybe four
[02:36:07.600 --> 02:36:13.520]  times as much as every year so what's not to say that that money does not influence the outcome
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:17.600]  of the sports that we are watching because no one's monitoring for that money no one's looking
[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:22.720]  out for fixed games the major media doesn't believe fixed games can happen so they're not looking out
[02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:27.040]  for the sports leagues don't want to admit that it's possible that the game can be fixed so they're
[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:31.280]  completely ignoring it even though they have their own security divisions which are literally staffed
[02:36:31.280 --> 02:36:37.040]  with former members of the fbi cia dea secret service and local law enforcement they don't
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:41.520]  reveal anything to you know actual law enforcement in terms of what's going on within their leagues
[02:36:41.520 --> 02:36:45.680]  so the league's not looking out for sports gamblers are more apt to be the ones fixing the games
[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:49.840]  because they're associated a lot of times with organized crime who run the illegal underground
[02:36:49.840 --> 02:36:55.120]  and you've also got massive gambling by the players the the uh the refs all of them and you look at
[02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:59.760]  pete rose this is well known well taking with pete rose and the thing that people a lot of times
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:03.600]  they give pete rose the benefit of the doubt because he was supposedly gambling on himself well
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:09.360]  pete wasn't gambling on 162 games that he played in for him on himself a lot of times he was not
[02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:13.280]  betting on himself which tipped off the other gamblers he was working with and the bookmakers
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:17.280]  that said hey maybe we should be getting betting against pete because he doesn't he doesn't even
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:22.240]  think he's going to win tonight so i mean there's even so much gambling going on by the players
[02:37:22.240 --> 02:37:27.040]  like you say the referees the coaches no one's monitoring all this and then also seem to think
[02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:32.480]  it's so cool to gamble and it's so trendy i mean it's all a big joke i mean it's one thing if you
[02:37:32.480 --> 02:37:36.320]  go play poker with your buddies and bet a few dollars here and there but i mean the you know
[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:41.280]  this whole thing of this whole culture of gambling i mean it's it's literally like begging to be a
[02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:46.560]  loser begging to be a schmuck well yeah most most gamblers do not win and it's funny because you
[02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:51.520]  only have to win about 56 percent of your bets to be successful but most people can't do that
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:56.960]  professionals who do do it who can do it literally work 70 to 80 hours a week and they get what they
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:38:01.600]  call inside information stuff that no one else gets about these games about these athletes because
[02:38:01.600 --> 02:38:05.680]  that's one of the things is people don't quite understand is that you think that your favorite
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:10.320]  athlete maybe wants to give 100 in every game well that's not true you don't know if he was out drinking
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:15.040]  the night before if you know is getting divorced you don't know what is going on in his private
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:19.520]  life so you don't know what's really mentally going on yeah but i mean look at the guys with
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:26.000]  the pit bulls and everything i mean it's just it people think trashiness is cool nowadays and so
[02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:30.480]  there's just a bottomless to it i mean looking at this from the outside reading your book undoubtedly
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:35.760]  things are getting worse quickly how far will it go well if you look around the world and that's
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:40.080]  a lot of thing american sports fans don't do is if you look to soccer you look to tennis cricket
[02:38:40.080 --> 02:38:45.360]  there's matches matches being fixed constantly in countries all over this world by organized crime
[02:38:45.360 --> 02:38:50.160]  by gamblers now supposedly that's never touched our shores but i don't believe that's the case i
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:54.240]  believe it's going on now it's just the fact is no one's looking for it i mean i'm about the only
[02:38:54.240 --> 02:38:59.440]  person in america unfortunately who's looking into this the espn the sports illustrated to the world
[02:38:59.440 --> 02:39:04.480]  they just ignore this as if it's not happening because they're being dictated to well remember
[02:39:04.480 --> 02:39:08.560]  six seven eight years ago we heard this lands Armstrong stuff and we're told we were conspiracy
[02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:14.560]  theorist but not being a conspiracy theorist just means you're totally gullible and walk around in
[02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:19.440]  dark parking lots at night begging people to rob you i mean being a conspiracy theorist means you
[02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:24.400]  just don't believe what known liars tell you over and over again it's like jadger hoover testified
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:28.560]  in the early fifties before congress and said there was no such thing as organized crime or
[02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:34.080]  lakosa nostra and then people still think organized crimes only italian that's a tiny part of it it
[02:39:34.080 --> 02:39:40.080]  just shows the not total naivete oh i agree with you i mean i've been called the number one sports
[02:39:40.080 --> 02:39:45.440]  conspiracy theorist in america and that's because i don't trust the leagues i'm skeptical of the
[02:39:45.440 --> 02:39:49.360]  leagues and that's a big thing i don't get with conspiracy theorists i mean why am i not the
[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:53.600]  skeptic why are the skeptics one who always attack the conspiracy theorists are supposed to
[02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:58.320]  well i mean they want to keep the public sheep like and gullible i mean they're not the skeptics
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:01.760]  that's the funny part they're the ones who are just telling the line the skeptics are the ones
[02:40:01.760 --> 02:40:06.320]  questioning why is the line there why is this the way it is i mean and that's what i'm doing i'm
[02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:10.560]  questioning the major sports leagues and saying they're not telling the fans the entire truth of
[02:40:10.560 --> 02:40:14.800]  explain to people the court rulings where the nfl all of this is for entertainment purposes only
[02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:20.480]  they say that uh break that down for people well the biggest thing it came out of the spy gate
[02:40:20.480 --> 02:40:24.640]  scandal which happened between the new england patriots and a jetspan he sued the patreons over
[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:29.200]  this whole spy gate incident which took place a few years back when those patreons were videotaping
[02:40:29.200 --> 02:40:34.000]  the other teams coaching signals and they went all the way to the third circuit court of appeals
[02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:37.920]  and then the judge who ruled on the case said your ticket when you buy the ticket to a football
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:42.320]  game basketball game would have you it even says on the tickets for entertainment purposes only but
[02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:46.720]  your ticket only entitles you to see a football game for example it doesn't mean it has to be
[02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:51.040]  played by any certain rules that any certain players have to appear that those rules have to
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:55.520]  be followed that a team can't cheat it basically the nfl provides you with a football game that
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:41:00.560]  she'll fill their under the contract so you couldn't even go after like the league for fraud
[02:41:00.560 --> 02:41:05.760]  for fixing games because the courts have already ruled that it's not fraud it's just an entertainment
[02:41:05.760 --> 02:41:09.440]  product you consume it and that's the end of the story what do you think about the whole
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:14.640]  lance armstrong thing you heard my rant but and i followed the case a little bit just because uh
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:20.400]  you know it deals with the fact that they like to burn the minion when it turns out from the
[02:41:20.400 --> 02:41:26.080]  witnesses that that that armstrong and others were failing but people up the chain were fixing it for
[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:31.520]  failing well and the scary thing to me is that he's not alone i mean they know cycling has been
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:36.080]  you know rampant with performance enhancing drugs but you know what it's already nfl so is the nba
[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:42.160]  the nhl all the major sports leagues are and the thing is the major leagues drug testing programs
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:46.320]  really are just pr campaigns they don't care if the athletes are doing drugs they don't care if
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:50.400]  they're doing cocaine or if they're doing steroids or it have you as long as they perform as long as
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:54.400]  they put on a show and don't forget performance enhancing drugs are gonna actually improve the
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:59.440]  show that they're putting on the leagues are good with it they just have to have these programs in
[02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:04.240]  place so they can reassure the fans oh everything's good everything's clean don't worry about it we
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:08.640]  got it taken care of but i don't think that's the case i think they know in fact i had a former
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:13.680]  or actually a current member of the football writers for america tell me on his radio program
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:20.400]  that at least 75 of the nfl the players are doing hg human growth hormone but at the time the league
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:24.400]  wasn't testing for it so it was free for them to do so and the league knew it and they didn't care
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:33.120]  and again there's this idea of well everybody's corrupt we're just gonna do it once you get in
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:40.000]  that space then the sky's the limit once you just give in to corruption completely then it takes over
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:44.800]  society points its finger at you and says you're the extremist you're the conspiracy theorist
[02:42:44.800 --> 02:42:48.560]  you're the bad guy and that's what we've now reached not just in this but in in all the
[02:42:48.560 --> 02:42:54.000]  different corruption where the homeland security says the people exposing the bad we're the terrorists
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:59.520]  now oh yeah i'm sure i'm on a government watch list for the fbi files that i've requested just because
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:04.160]  they deal with professional sports i mean again if the government is to a certain extent funding
[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:08.160]  professional sports for the reasons you and i kind of think they are in terms of you know
[02:43:08.160 --> 02:43:12.640]  controlling the populace and making them distracted then they're watching what i'm doing and i know
[02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:16.160]  the leagues are watching what i'm doing as well because they're afraid i'm going to expose the
[02:43:16.160 --> 02:43:20.400]  fact that you know the emperor has no clothes on that these games can be corrupted and are being
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:25.520]  corrupted and no one's looking out for well that's the thing it's inherently corrupt it's inherently
[02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:32.720]  a joke it's inherently bad uh and it's it's totally sick and it's been sold as healthy and good it's a
[02:43:32.720 --> 02:43:38.560]  dirty joke and i think everybody should just boycott professional sports uh if you want to
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:44.240]  support your local teams uh colleges even gotten corrupt you know your high school team whatever
[02:43:44.240 --> 02:43:48.240]  if your kids are in it or you're in the sports i think it's healthy and great but this whole
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:54.000]  narcissism this obsession with it all of it has gotten really nasty well yeah because you gotta
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:58.160]  remember they don't put the games on just for fun i mean they put on college games they put on
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:02.880]  the professional games to sell you things they put it on for advertising that's why it exists
[02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:07.840]  and one of the reasons why it's so highly sought after by the networks is because it's really one
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:12.160]  of the few things that still goes on live that people have to watch while it's going on if they
[02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:16.880]  want to know the results that many people record sporting events to watch them later they have to
[02:44:16.880 --> 02:44:20.960]  watch them now they have to know what's going on now as opposed to all the other team it's made
[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:26.480]  it's there to waste your time uh how much because i mean i see numbers of five billion the last few
[02:44:26.480 --> 02:44:32.640]  years on sports stadiums how much is our taxpayers fit in the bill for for all these disgusting
[02:44:32.640 --> 02:44:38.160]  parasitic sports teams i couldn't tell you an exact number but it's interesting to note that you
[02:44:38.160 --> 02:44:43.520]  know many economists who have studied the impact of these stadiums on cities have said that sports
[02:44:43.520 --> 02:44:47.920]  stadiums do absolutely nothing for a city's economy i mean as soon as like the colts left
[02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:53.680]  baltimore you know the city baltimore didn't fall apart in fact it actually stepped up it got better
[02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:57.520]  because that entertainment money that was being spent on the colts instead went to other local
[02:44:57.520 --> 02:45:02.400]  things local theater local music and that sort of thing so it doesn't really help a city to have a
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:07.520]  major league sports league team it just is it's kind of a mental thing as people want it they
[02:45:07.520 --> 02:45:12.400]  want to be able to identify with it for whatever reason that's their ego that's their accomplishment
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:17.680]  is to go watch a bunch of drug addicts and have tsa train goons grope their family and then be
[02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:22.880]  overcharged and yelled at and tasered for no reason and they and they bring a little girl in
[02:45:22.880 --> 02:45:27.520]  michigan a a they order eliminate they bring an alcoholic lemonade she doesn't even drink it
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:33.040]  but they still arrest the dad and cps the kid you're just asking to be abused in a giant disgusting
[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:38.320]  mafia operation oh yeah i mean that's it's a scary thing what's going on with professional
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:42.720]  sports day because there is so much money involved and there's so much money on the line for these
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:46.880]  people that they don't want to let it go and that's why i think they're willing to manipulate the
[02:45:46.880 --> 02:45:50.320]  outcome of their own games because they have to keep increasing things they have to keep
[02:45:50.320 --> 02:45:55.120]  upping the stakes upping the ante making more people watch almost compelling more people to
[02:45:55.120 --> 02:45:58.640]  watch and that's why i don't think they can just leave it up to chance i mean i asked people would
[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:03.360]  you leave a multi-billion dollar industry up to chance especially when you don't have to
[02:46:03.360 --> 02:46:08.160]  because i mean if you took like mcdonald's for example and mcdonald's had the ability to manipulate
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:12.240]  and control the taste of their food while you consumed it to make it more appealing to you
[02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:16.160]  they would do that well professional sports these can do the exact same thing
[02:46:16.160 --> 02:46:19.520]  they can alter the game they can manipulate the game while you're consuming it while you're
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:24.640]  watching it and make it better make it more enjoyable and so why do people think they don't
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:29.840]  do that no it's all ridiculous i want to go to some phone calls everybody should get this book
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:35.360]  and give it to your sport zombie friends the fixes in info our store.com let's go to chris
[02:46:35.360 --> 02:46:39.120]  in florida chris you're on the air for a question for our guests go ahead thank you
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:47.280]  hey okay brian um when i was uh younger i went and i saw the the bowls uh at the hotel before
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:52.400]  the game because i was a huge fan and um i was real innocent and i i wanted to meet the players
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:59.440]  and i actually saw some escorts getting sent up to the rooms and i saw some of the players walking
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:04.640]  with the girls few feet behind them and um you know i innocently was trying to ask for autographs
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:09.120]  and snap pictures so i have these pictures of them with the girls so i'm not just you know
[02:47:09.120 --> 02:47:15.840]  rumoring this and um you know a lot of my illusions were shattered after that and well i mean you know
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:22.720]  yeah obviously their prostitution is ubiquitous in sports you know but the question i wanted to ask
[02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:30.240]  brian was um uh you know like with the whole coby brian thing and uh in colorado and then how they
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:35.280]  just want to let them go back and play do you think that they like kind of like send people to set
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:40.800]  these guys up so they can tell you absolutely brian talk about that oh absolutely i have a video
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:44.960]  that i got actually from the fbi through the free my information act and there's a video
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:50.080]  they used to show to the players to warn them about being corrupted and get you know sucked
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:54.960]  into you know game fixing schemes and one of the things they mentioned was the fact that these guys
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:48:01.280]  will use women to lure these guys into these plots so i mean it's very easy to use you know
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:05.040]  women use prostitutes to get them and they say we're going to tell your wife the same way they
[02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:10.320]  get politicians have you put that video out yet brother no i haven't i just recently got it hey hey
[02:48:10.320 --> 02:48:14.960]  hey you want to have you want to i would love to have you on and premiere that and get it out as a
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:20.000]  big story i'm sure you can do it somewhere else but that those training videos i got to see that
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:23.680]  that that would be dynamite because here they are saying there's no fixing but they're showing
[02:48:23.680 --> 02:48:28.160]  them videos going here's how you get set up well that's the really interesting part of it is because
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:32.080]  they're talking about things that's never come out in the public but they're obviously showing and
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:35.760]  it's only meant to be shown to the athlete hey listen i wouldn't sit on that too long and get
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:40.560]  that out quick no i plan on doing something with it very soon because it is it's really interesting
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:44.240]  because people don't think games have been fixed and yet they're talking openly about games that
[02:48:44.240 --> 02:48:49.120]  have been fixed no that that is bombshell that you got that okay caller i think that answers
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:54.480]  your question thank you sir uh let's talk to eddie in wisconsin you're on the air go ahead hi it's
[02:48:54.480 --> 02:49:00.960]  eddie i'm sorry go ahead that's okay um i had a couple of comments one kind of went back to your
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:06.560]  earlier discussion about um candidates and the debates and the squandering power and the other
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:13.360]  has to do with the sport situation i'll go with the sports one first um and that is um i guess
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:18.880]  i'm wondering exactly what the proof is as far as it being fixed and then the other thing i was
[02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:24.640]  wondering about for quite a while there was a big association and commercials and things like that
[02:49:24.640 --> 02:49:32.320]  um combining sort of a gang lifestyle with sports and then we ended up with all these gangs you
[02:49:32.320 --> 02:49:37.680]  know getting bigger and bigger yeah no no they're selling that to ruin the kids they're piggybacking
[02:49:37.680 --> 02:49:42.880]  destructive i've talked to high level people that were there with mtv when they said the mid 90s
[02:49:42.880 --> 02:49:47.920]  we're going to push gangster rap to just you know to wreck people that's how this works they want a
[02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:52.240]  dumbed-down culture so the kids act like gang members and the cops are trying to put them in
[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:56.800]  prison uh can you comment on that brian well i'll go back to what she asked me about the proof of
[02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:02.560]  this and the proof the hard part with proof is the fbi investigated like i said i have over 400
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:07.280]  files of them investigating fixed games and fixed war tracies and boxing matches and they had an
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:12.000]  extremely hard time proving these things because you can watch the game film of a particular game
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:17.040]  and you can't tell if a quarterback threw an interception for example on purpose or feet just
[02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:21.280]  threw an interception i mean that's the way things go these things are very hard to prove because
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:25.840]  there is no concrete evidence of them but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen i mean i mean
[02:50:25.840 --> 02:50:30.000]  there are there are a lot of documented cases they always say it was an individual player did it
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:34.560]  for themselves but the point is they show them training videos saying don't get set up to fix
[02:50:34.560 --> 02:50:39.920]  games it's it's been proven fixed all over the world we're just the most naive people on the planet
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:47.280]  ma'am does that answer your question uh yeah i had one more comment which was
[02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:52.800]  is when you were talking about candidates was wondering power i was thinking that a lot of the
[02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:57.360]  conservative you know programs like this are really good why aren't we using our power to
[02:50:57.360 --> 02:51:03.760]  promote the constitution taylor stay there erin fullen here as the food police shut down food
[02:51:03.760 --> 02:51:08.800]  co-ops the amish and small farmers americans are losing access not just a raw milk and homemade
[02:51:08.800 --> 02:51:13.760]  cheeses but to healthy home crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kiefer
[02:51:13.760 --> 02:51:18.400]  it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly
[02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:22.240]  i'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been around since
[02:51:22.240 --> 02:51:26.000]  the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:31.360]  found across the globe in almost every culture even today japanese eat miso africans eat fermented
[02:51:31.360 --> 02:51:36.480]  porges koreans eat kimchi and in india fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's

[02:53:59.200 --> 02:54:10.160]  some of the biggest problems facing our society are the video game heads the sports heads
[02:54:12.880 --> 02:54:16.800]  people really aren't living they're just watching a television they're watching a game
[02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:24.720]  and then it's all got messages that are destructive on purpose because we have a criminal elite
[02:54:24.720 --> 02:54:30.000]  running the architecture of the world right now and they see you as dumb animals so they're putting
[02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:37.040]  out propaganda to make you become what they say you are and you know they sell that sports is so
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:46.560]  wholesome and good it's not professional sports is sick and it's empty and it's not fulfilling
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:52.960]  anybody and it's riddled with fraud and the tsa groping you and troops of the kanduki derby
[02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:59.680]  searching people all of it is just used to sell a fraud it's like the running man we're going to
[02:54:59.680 --> 02:55:11.040]  take a few more calls here we were talking to a caller in wisconsin and she was bringing up points
[02:55:11.040 --> 02:55:16.560]  what was your point about the constitution ma'am i was just going to say it's going back to your
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:22.080]  earlier conversation about the candidates all of us you know so many of us feel very upset by
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:29.920]  only being given the choice of romney or obama and what i'm wondering at this point you're talking
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:35.440]  about spondering power and i think all these you know i listened to some celebrity radio and
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:40.960]  different programs and i guess what i'm wondering is why aren't we using our platform i mean move
[02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:46.320]  on dot org has certainly done enough of it to promote the constitution party candidate
[02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:53.840]  virgil good because he is on i think just about every state's ballot now and to me it's a better
[02:55:53.840 --> 02:55:59.040]  choice than sure sure how they get us is the lesser of two evils i appreciate your call
[02:55:59.760 --> 02:56:05.680]  where just like the two parties are subsidized just like sports is subsidized they make it
[02:56:05.680 --> 02:56:10.800]  such a big spectacle that then the third party is such a side show people go well there's not
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:15.120]  much difference but you know i like romney or i like obama if you have any comments with sports
[02:56:15.120 --> 02:56:20.800]  analogies tied into politics here brian well i think one of the interesting things is one of
[02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:25.920]  the other stuff things i studied is continuity government programs and national emergencies
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:30.480]  i actually wrote a book on it i haven't had published yet and um they do you know people
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:34.160]  say well that's impossible you know the government can't round you up and that sort of thing well
[02:56:34.800 --> 02:56:39.280]  they can they just haven't done it yet they could do it tomorrow and it's the same with you know
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:43.360]  professional sports you know people don't think a game can be fixed but you know what it could be
[02:56:43.360 --> 02:56:48.720]  fixed this sunday it could be fixed tomorrow it can happen it's just a question of whether they
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:53.520]  will do it and how often they do it but there's things out there that can be done by these leagues
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:56.960]  and they can be done by our government that people just don't want to believe as possible
[02:56:58.320 --> 02:57:07.440]  it's funny you raise that um in cog sports stadiums are where they first round everybody up
[02:57:07.440 --> 02:57:13.280]  and then process who goes to a camp who goes to force labor that's all on record the sports stadium
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:18.320]  are actually the giant government takeover centers well and they're supposed to be able to
[02:57:18.960 --> 02:57:24.000]  if your stadium is funded by public money they're supposed to even house the indigents like when
[02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:28.160]  they're not playing games but i mean you know is our digging allows you know a bunch of homeless
[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:32.000]  people to wander into like soldier field in chicago when they spent you know 500 million
[02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:36.320]  dollars renovating it just to take care of them i don't think so but yeah you're right they can
[02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:40.160]  they'll use those places when then if they need to oh you saw what happened at the super dome
[02:57:40.160 --> 02:57:43.920]  they wouldn't let people walk out of new orleans they made them go there and then the cops wouldn't
[02:57:43.920 --> 02:57:48.960]  go protect people and the troops sat there for six seven days on giant piles of food and water
[02:57:48.960 --> 02:57:54.960]  and were ordered don't help anyone just to see what would happen and then they destroyed the
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:57:59.120]  super dome the inside of the super dome and then public money had to be spent to you know
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:03.680]  re-bring it back to a state where they could play a football game and then the nfl took all the
[02:58:03.680 --> 02:58:08.320]  credit for bringing back new orleans which i just don't believe and now government
[02:58:08.320 --> 02:58:12.560]  is going to run health care the way they've run everything else it is going to be a nightmare
[02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:15.360]  it's been a nightmare everywhere else government runs things i want to do five more minutes with
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:20.720]  you take a few more calls from courtney uh eaty thank you for your call those were good questions
[02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:29.520]  and a few others uh here on the other side but the book is the fix is in the showmiz manipulation

[03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:34.480]  training video for professional athletes of how to not get set up by sex operatives and then fix
[03:00:34.480 --> 03:00:38.160]  games because you know i went right to the heart of the matter you notice i mean i get what you're
[03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:43.760]  saying this is proving that they know that this is going on oh exactly and that's the thing that's
[03:00:43.760 --> 03:00:48.880]  so shocking about this video is they say you know the NFL has never had a game fixed ever in its 90
[03:00:48.880 --> 03:00:53.600]  year history why not in this video it seems to indicate that there's a complete nother lie
[03:00:55.840 --> 03:00:59.920]  well of course there's been players or rafts or people that have tried to throne things when
[03:00:59.920 --> 03:01:05.520]  there's billions every year being embedded just on the nfl alone well it's it how much is it every
[03:01:05.520 --> 03:01:10.320]  years on the nfl it's some giant number well they say anywhere from one to four billion dollars a
[03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:16.960]  week on nfl games alone but again i said it's 80 to 380 billion dollars a year on illegal sports gambling
[03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:24.400]  and you remember that's all really going to organize crime it's incredible you know if i go cash a
[03:01:24.400 --> 03:01:30.800]  thousand dollar check the bank acts like i'm al qaeda or al capone uh and meanwhile the big
[03:01:30.800 --> 03:01:35.840]  mega banks on record just run the drug aircraft ship their money out the wall street journal reported
[03:01:35.840 --> 03:01:41.280]  yesterday middle class wealthy people that have a few million dollars trying to move to switzerland
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:47.760]  with tech post tax money uh the government says you can't leave there's no law they just won't
[03:01:47.760 --> 03:01:52.000]  let you leave because the banks run america and they don't want that money leaving i mean this is
[03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:57.600]  getting creepy man when you can't even get out of this country oh yeah let's go to a caller here
[03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:01.840]  i want to talk to you after the uh here in the break uh cortney in canada you're on the year go
[03:02:01.840 --> 03:02:07.520]  ahead yes hi alex and also hi brian i just want to thank both of you and especially alex for standing
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:12.080]  up for the truth even at times when you had to stand alone um and also being such a strong
[03:02:12.080 --> 03:02:19.280]  influence on twitter i have actually two questions and the first question uh hello yes ma'am okay uh
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:24.720]  is regarding with everything that's going on and because it's all tied together right and sports
[03:02:24.720 --> 03:02:31.200]  just like uh politics um you know it's to control the people and regarding the way that especially
[03:02:31.200 --> 03:02:37.360]  obama was being mockingly yesterday about technology and new different things are you worried
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:42.560]  that because everything is is in the digital age and moving towards an even more digital age
[03:02:43.680 --> 03:02:49.440]  company is like rare chip and um for instance on your ipad and everything everything is with
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:02:54.800]  touch now how that's going to affect the sports industry in regards to this will become some
[03:02:54.800 --> 03:03:00.640]  sort of thing that will be obligated in order to enjoy or not to enjoy i don't personally enjoy it
[03:03:00.640 --> 03:03:05.360]  but for the people who are kind of hooked at this moment they're going to have to
[03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:09.280]  they're going to have to some print and stuff just like very chip makes you get chips to go in these
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:15.520]  uh baha beach clubs yes they're they're going to force more and more police state stuff as a beta
[03:03:15.520 --> 03:03:20.960]  test on the sport zombies knowing the sports addicts will do anything including feed their
[03:03:20.960 --> 03:03:26.480]  children and the meat grinders uh probably they told them to uh comments on that brian i think
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:30.400]  you're right i think in a lot of ways that they are just like say they're just trying to suck more
[03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:33.760]  and more people into this sports thing and they're now they're bringing in more sports they're bringing
[03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:38.960]  in like the known corrupt sports of sackers especially like in idli they're feeding those
[03:03:38.960 --> 03:03:42.960]  broadcasts live into american homes now even though they know that those games have been
[03:03:42.960 --> 03:03:46.640]  outright fixed i mean it's public knowledge in idli but here no one knows but they'll keep
[03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:50.960]  showing them here because it's getting more and more people to watch sports yeah but i mean it's
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:56.960]  like well known that don king has fixed matches i mean the guys have you know been arrested for
[03:03:56.960 --> 03:04:01.760]  murder and stuff but i mean people kind of figured that out about professional boxing it's not as
[03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:07.520]  big as it used to be does the whole spectacle of sports endanger itself uh as more of the corruption
[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:12.080]  comes out no i don't think so because you can look at professional wrestling which you know many
[03:04:12.080 --> 03:04:17.760]  people know is scripted and basically fixed no yeah and you're not a conspiracy theorist are you
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:22.720]  it's real oh well but you get people who you know pay hundreds of dollars for these pay-per-view
[03:04:22.720 --> 03:04:27.920]  events and big tickets to go see these things well you know they don't care oh i know i know lots of
[03:04:27.920 --> 03:04:35.600]  adults that say it's real oh yeah but if you look at you know mixed martial arts now in the ufc
[03:04:35.600 --> 03:04:39.920]  it's very comparable to boxing and we know boxing's been fixed i mean look at the picture behind me
[03:04:39.920 --> 03:04:44.560]  dammit it goes back you know 120 years that we know boxing has been fixed but you know people
[03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:49.120]  don't think the ufc can be fixed are you crazy of course you could fix it my actually in there
[03:04:49.120 --> 03:04:54.560]  i mean it's very easy you need one guy and it's done amazing the book the fix is in the fix is in
[03:04:54.560 --> 03:05:01.280]  on so many fronts wake up stop being naive and we can turn this around big retransmission coming up
