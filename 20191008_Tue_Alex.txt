[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:04.858]  Gavin McInnes is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.TV.
[00:00:04.858 --> 00:00:09.547]  Gavin McInnes, Joe Biggs, Miley Yiannopoulos, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.TV.
[00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.403]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:00:30.403 --> 00:00:35.107]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:06.597]  I've been trying to figure out how to make more money selling weed.
[00:01:06.597 --> 00:01:08.979]  And last night, it came to me.
[00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:17.342]  We could grow the family business by selling Tegrity to the Chinese.
[00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:18.763]  I did a little research.
[00:01:18.763 --> 00:01:21.764]  Turns out there's a lot of people in China.
[00:01:21.764 --> 00:01:28.587]  If we can get like 2% of that market to buy our weed, we'd make millions of millions of dollars.
[00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:30.248]  I'm flying to China tomorrow.
[00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:32.169]  I've got to get in on this before anyone else thinks of it.
[00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.572]  First time going to China?
[00:01:44.572 --> 00:01:45.934]  No, not really.
[00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:47.255]  It's my first time.
[00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:50.459]  I'm going out to try and drum up a little business.
[00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.020]  What are you heading out for?
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.622]  I work for a clothing company.
[00:01:53.622 --> 00:01:56.465]  We're trying to break into the market and get the Chinese people as customers.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.020]  Oh, hey!
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.561]  F*** you!
[00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:01.881]  Huh?
[00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:04.162]  I had that idea like three days ago.
[00:02:04.162 --> 00:02:05.102]  So what?
[00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:07.023]  So when did you come up with it?
[00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:09.023]  Hey, Mitchell, you're on this flight?
[00:02:09.023 --> 00:02:10.124]  Yeah, that's so funny.
[00:02:10.124 --> 00:02:14.065]  I'm working for Google now, overseeing the expansions into the Chinese user base.
[00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:18.246]  He had still with the NBA, doing some press with the players to try to get more Chinese viewers.
[00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:22.410]  Oh, for Christ's sake!
[00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.954]  You have a good idea and everyone wants to copy you!
[00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:25.615]  Fine!
[00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:28.139]  I can handle some healthy competition!
[00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:32.906]  Who else wants to go to China and get some of their money?
[00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:34.187]  Oh, for crying out loud!
[00:02:40.683 --> 00:02:44.266]  Let me guess, you work for a company trying to get Chinese people as customers.
[00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:44.927]  Wow!
[00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:46.268]  Where'd you get that idea?
[00:02:46.268 --> 00:02:48.630]  It's okay, it's okay.
[00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:58.098]  I'm sure there's plenty of Chinese people for all of us.
[00:02:58.098 --> 00:03:02.082]  Hello.
[00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:03.903]  Howdy.
[00:03:03.903 --> 00:03:06.766]  I'm a small business owner from the United States.
[00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:08.107]  You guys know any money people here?
[00:03:09.915 --> 00:03:11.396]  Can I give you guys my card?
[00:03:11.396 --> 00:03:19.461]  I'm just starting to grow my business here in China.
[00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:22.463]  What is this, sir?
[00:03:22.463 --> 00:03:23.204]  Oh, that?
[00:03:23.204 --> 00:03:24.645]  That's weed.
[00:03:24.645 --> 00:03:25.666]  Marijuana!
[00:03:35.306 --> 00:03:38.048]  Oh, here we go.
[00:03:38.048 --> 00:03:42.830]  Oh, hey, everything all right?
[00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:43.750]  What's going on?
[00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.651]  Hey, don't forget my suitcase.
[00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:47.052]  Could you grab my suitcase?
[00:03:47.052 --> 00:03:48.112]  All my weed is in there.
[00:03:48.112 --> 00:03:48.973]  Excuse me.
[00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:16.994]  I am a proud member of the Communist Party.
[00:04:16.994 --> 00:04:19.658]  The party is more important than the individual.
[00:04:45.134 --> 00:04:48.095]  Oh, hello there.
[00:04:48.095 --> 00:04:49.715]  Oh, who's there?
[00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:50.755]  Nobody.
[00:04:50.755 --> 00:04:52.536]  Just a bear.
[00:04:52.536 --> 00:04:57.737]  I was wondering, since you're new, if you might have some honey?
[00:04:57.737 --> 00:05:00.798]  No, I don't have any honey.
[00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:02.618]  Are you prisoners here?
[00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:06.219]  Some people said fool looked like the Chinese P-P-P-President.
[00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.180]  So we're illegal in China now.
[00:05:09.252 --> 00:05:12.034]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish.
[00:05:12.034 --> 00:05:13.975]  They think the West is dead.
[00:05:13.975 --> 00:05:17.556]  They think if they censor nationalists and patriots off the internet, you'll just forget about us.
[00:05:17.556 --> 00:05:19.377]  And then they'll be the only information out there.
[00:05:19.377 --> 00:05:21.919]  Well, so far, that's not been working too well for them.
[00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.782]  Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly that the resistance to globalism is alive and well at Banned.Video.
[00:05:28.782 --> 00:05:29.923]  And now we've added a lot of
[00:05:29.923 --> 00:05:30.323]  I think so.
[00:05:53.424 --> 00:06:04.413]  The power of America, the power of freedom, the power to build a better world and stand in the face of the censors and the tyrants is alive and stronger than ever at Band.Video.
[00:06:04.413 --> 00:06:07.575]  But it's up to you to unleash its full potential.
[00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:07.956]  Band.Video.
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.951]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:49.681 --> 00:06:52.484]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:06:52.484 --> 00:06:59.750]  I am your host, Alex Jones, on this Tuesday, October 8th, 2019, Global Transmission.
[00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:07.738]  And to say that our plate is incredibly over-full of just earth-shaking information is a understatement.
[00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:10.561]  It's unbelievable what's happening.
[00:07:10.561 --> 00:07:20.084]  We are entering, as I've said, this major geopolitical, cultural, economic, spiritual quickening, the likes of which this planet has never seen.
[00:07:20.084 --> 00:07:29.286]  Obama launched the Arab Spring and the invasions of Syria and other parts of the Middle East and Africa.
[00:07:29.286 --> 00:07:31.267]  Then, seven years later,
[00:07:32.895 --> 00:07:49.804]  Here is Trump in the middle of that trying to contain all these different factions from Iran to Turkey to Iraq and others that want control.
[00:07:49.804 --> 00:07:56.728]  You've got a Shiite Sunni civil war that's kicked off in martial law in Iraq to the east of Syria.
[00:07:58.089 --> 00:08:03.830]  You've got Iran launching proxy wars in different areas of the Middle East as well.
[00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:16.774]  You've got Turkey, that's enemies with Iran, moving in to areas of northern Syria.
[00:08:16.774 --> 00:08:24.936]  Erdogan threatened just a few months ago to flood Europe with millions of, quote, refugees, most of them playing close Al-Qaeda and ISIS.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:36.763]  Turkey wasn't given part of northern Syria to repatriate these individuals.
[00:08:36.763 --> 00:08:47.386]  It was Obama and the globalists that took over the sovereign state, the Baathist state of Syria, that's been stable for 50 years.
[00:08:47.386 --> 00:08:50.907]  It was the neocons and the globalists that created this crisis.
[00:08:50.907 --> 00:08:52.328]  Now they've handed it to Trump.
[00:08:55.054 --> 00:09:06.998]  And Turkey has said, we're either going to flood Europe in a new disaster, or we're going to move these people back into Syria.
[00:09:06.998 --> 00:09:15.581]  And so Trump said, well, I'm not going to go to war with you if you try to do that.
[00:09:15.581 --> 00:09:21.523]  And then Pat Robertson comes out and says that Trump will lose the mandate of heaven
[00:09:23.018 --> 00:09:25.381]  I guess we don't go to war with Turkey.
[00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:35.335]  The idea is if we didn't leave a few thousand troops, it wasn't a few hundred, in that area as a force threatening to go to war with Turkey,
[00:09:39.281 --> 00:09:43.284]  That this was all gonna happen, but who triggered this all to begin with?
[00:09:43.284 --> 00:09:47.126]  Who launched the Arab Spring with Google and Facebook?
[00:09:47.126 --> 00:09:48.187]  Obama and Hillary.
[00:09:48.187 --> 00:09:49.207]  Who took over North Africa?
[00:09:49.207 --> 00:09:50.348]  Who took over the Middle East?
[00:09:50.348 --> 00:09:52.909]  Who launched the attack into Syria and did all this?
[00:09:52.909 --> 00:10:00.874]  And then Muslims from all over the world, not just from the Middle East and Africa, went to Syria to take over!
[00:10:00.874 --> 00:10:05.517]  And most of these people that have now gone into Turkey are not Syrian!
[00:10:05.517 --> 00:10:06.258]  They're invaders.
[00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:15.202]  Most of them are military age men.
[00:10:15.202 --> 00:10:17.444]  So they knew all of that.
[00:10:17.444 --> 00:10:21.226]  So we've got that huge report and Pat Robertson saying all this.
[00:10:21.226 --> 00:10:27.070]  And by the way, you probably heard of Mandate of Heaven.
[00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:27.891]  That is an exact
[00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:35.466]  Chinese proverb, when different Chinese emperors were successful, they had the mandate of heaven.
[00:10:35.466 --> 00:10:37.848]  When they didn't, they had lost the mandate.
[00:10:37.848 --> 00:10:45.514]  The Communist Chinese talk about the mandate of the Communist Party being the mandate of heaven.
[00:10:45.514 --> 00:10:51.638]  So that is just all part of the Chinification, the Chi-comification of everything.
[00:10:51.638 --> 00:10:55.441]  And that leads us, obviously, to the next big area I'm going to cover today.
[00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:57.163]  And that's the world awakening.
[00:10:58.609 --> 00:11:04.193]  To the fact that China's bought up Hollywood, our debt, and already controls most of our media.
[00:11:04.193 --> 00:11:10.977]  Chinese communists didn't like a Tiffany's ad running where a model is covering one eye and has a diamond ring on.
[00:11:12.858 --> 00:11:22.667]  They said, well, some of the Hong Kong protesters do that, so you're virtue signaling, so we're going to ban you, and so Tiffany's just removed the ad.
[00:11:22.667 --> 00:11:31.956]  This is just a headlong worship of whatever the shycoms say, because we don't stand for anything, because we won't stand up, because we accept censorship now.
[00:11:31.956 --> 00:11:34.338]  The dam broke.
[00:11:34.338 --> 00:11:36.440]  And so you got a billion, 400 million shycoms.
[00:11:38.462 --> 00:11:40.944]  And whatever their government says is now king.
[00:11:40.944 --> 00:11:43.265]  Because they'll call the shots!
[00:11:43.265 --> 00:11:45.747]  They're now the king, culturally.
[00:11:45.747 --> 00:11:51.651]  The cultural revolution of Mao is now global, via Xi Jinping.
[00:11:51.651 --> 00:11:53.252]  From Hollywood to Chollywood.
[00:11:53.252 --> 00:11:56.314]  That's years ago.
[00:11:56.314 --> 00:11:59.696]  The sinister Chinese takeover of movie land.
[00:11:59.696 --> 00:12:03.098]  And boy, they finance the right wing, the left wing, they finance it all.
[00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:07.081]  That's why you talk about this, and I would always have weird right-wing groups attack me.
[00:12:08.098 --> 00:12:08.999]  You're making that up!
[00:12:08.999 --> 00:12:10.040]  China has no power!
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:10.700]  Leave them alone!
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.643]  I'm like, what?
[00:12:14.643 --> 00:12:24.491]  Everything from the new Red Dawn movie to the new Top Gun coming out is all CHICOM-funded, owned, and approved.
[00:12:24.491 --> 00:12:26.352]  And now Apple denied it six months ago.
[00:12:26.352 --> 00:12:33.738]  Now they admit, okay, we do ban the Taiwanese flag and other flags that China doesn't want in our emojis.
[00:12:34.983 --> 00:12:39.326]  So Apple's based officially for now a year plus in China.
[00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:40.567]  They moved over there early last year.
[00:12:40.567 --> 00:12:44.249]  And they take their orders from them and they've got all the code Ts of your phones.
[00:12:44.249 --> 00:12:46.290]  This is just the new world we live in.
[00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:51.874]  So we're going to look at all of those angles and the NBA literally groveling.
[00:12:51.874 --> 00:12:59.199]  Don't look for all the NBA players saying how much America sucks and how bad Trump is and how this country's racist and evil.
[00:12:59.199 --> 00:13:00.820]  Don't look for LeBron James.
[00:13:02.185 --> 00:13:05.908]  In between taking his knees to say anything, he's in China next week.
[00:13:05.908 --> 00:13:09.011]  And don't look for any of it.
[00:13:09.011 --> 00:13:12.814]  Because these are evil corporations.
[00:13:12.814 --> 00:13:20.320]  And the CFR and the globalists have set it up where China is the future and America's done.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.584]  And Trump's like a dose, in full words, like a dose of antibiotics when somebody's got gangrene.
[00:13:24.584 --> 00:13:27.546]  But you know what?
[00:13:27.546 --> 00:13:30.809]  The left doesn't want us to get the medicine, they want us to go down the tubes.
[00:13:32.526 --> 00:13:36.169]  So all the Rolling Stone and CNN are now critical of the NBA.
[00:13:36.169 --> 00:13:41.213]  Oh, you're not standing up for human rights in China or Hong Kong or all these people getting shot and killed for no reason.
[00:13:41.213 --> 00:13:48.618]  All because they don't want to be secretly arrested and disappeared and their organs harvested.
[00:13:48.618 --> 00:13:59.506]  Well, Rolling Stone and CNN and all these groups just cheerleaded when I was taking off all these platforms.
[00:13:59.506 --> 00:13:59.947]  Let's see now.
[00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.731]  CNN and Rolling Stone, you're banned in China.
[00:14:04.731 --> 00:14:08.093]  And then next week they're going to want you banned here.
[00:14:08.093 --> 00:14:10.734]  Because all the investment, all the money, all of it's been set up there.
[00:14:10.734 --> 00:14:11.995]  So that's the second big thing.
[00:14:11.995 --> 00:14:17.317]  We've got the huge war that could trigger world war in the Middle East.
[00:14:17.317 --> 00:14:23.520]  We've got China openly flexing its muscles and the level of groveling, even major video games.
[00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:32.252]  It's as big as NFL games now, these big video game tournaments.
[00:14:32.252 --> 00:14:57.257]  Well, a well-known champion video game player, fiction becomes reality, like Ready Player One, playing in the big Blizzard games, criticized Communist China and said that they were with the protesters in Hong Kong, and so that person's been kicked out of the tournament.
[00:14:58.332 --> 00:15:09.260]  Oh, now international video game companies say, as a gamer, up there playing games, you're winning.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:09.920]  You're a celebrity.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:11.021]  Everybody can see you.
[00:15:11.021 --> 00:15:12.482]  Millions are watching.
[00:15:12.482 --> 00:15:16.725]  You open your fat mouth against the GICOMS.
[00:15:16.725 --> 00:15:17.606]  You're banned.
[00:15:17.606 --> 00:15:19.167]  You can't win that $300,000 prize money now.
[00:15:22.162 --> 00:15:23.923]  This is how freedom dies.
[00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:34.489]  Once you give in to censorship, the dam breaks, the doors blow off, and like a submarine opening a bulkhead, you flood and sink.
[00:15:34.489 --> 00:15:36.571]  We're at that point.
[00:15:36.571 --> 00:15:43.755]  And then we learned, oh, there's more whistleblowers, but they're going to be secret with their faces blurred or blacked out when they testify to Congress.
[00:15:43.755 --> 00:15:45.176]  Never before done.
[00:15:45.176 --> 00:15:47.177]  Secret testimony over video feeds.
[00:15:50.069 --> 00:15:53.873]  I guess Schiff will go in the other room and they'll black him out and he'll just speak.
[00:15:53.873 --> 00:15:55.815]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:15:55.815 --> 00:16:00.501]  It's an assault on everything we hold dear, on every check and balance.
[00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:04.645]  We've got all that coming up.
[00:16:04.645 --> 00:16:06.167]  And so much more today.

[00:17:16.961 --> 00:17:25.326]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:18:09.173 --> 00:18:11.296]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:18:11.296 --> 00:18:12.437]  Alex, God bless you.
[00:18:12.437 --> 00:18:15.040]  I have an idea for a new InfoWars t-shirt.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:20.987]  Instead of, this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[00:18:20.987 --> 00:18:21.688]  Ooh, yeah.
[00:18:21.688 --> 00:18:23.029]  Showing your brain getting fried.
[00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:24.891]  Then I have some comments on your supplements, man.
[00:18:24.891 --> 00:18:25.932]  Totally changed my life.
[00:18:25.932 --> 00:18:28.976]  I use TurboForce bodies, AlphaPower, BrainForce.
[00:18:29.176 --> 00:18:29.917]  Well, you're right.
[00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.651]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong?
[00:18:46.651 --> 00:18:47.611]  Trying to fact check the present.
[00:19:13.899 --> 00:19:26.007]  The deceptive, humpty-dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and to censor us.
[00:19:26.007 --> 00:19:29.909]  And of course he famously said, along with many others, that Trump is the InfoWars president.
[00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:37.354]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[00:19:37.594 --> 00:19:38.114]  And you know what?
[00:19:38.114 --> 00:19:39.075]  It's true.
[00:19:39.075 --> 00:19:47.378]  Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew, and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists of power around the world.
[00:19:47.378 --> 00:19:53.300]  And now Trump's openly coming out and declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.062]  So this is a day of great victory, and I salute you all, but now we're in the thick of the fight.
[00:19:58.062 --> 00:20:00.963]  So, Infowarsstore.com for products you need.
[00:20:00.963 --> 00:20:06.925]  Massive sales now, so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end.
[00:20:07.225 --> 00:20:12.146]  Until we've defeated them!
[00:20:12.146 --> 00:20:14.847]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:35.876 --> 00:20:51.029]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:57.734]  Okay, at the start of the next segment, I'm going to get up in front of the map here of your TV viewer.
[00:20:57.734 --> 00:20:59.716]  The radio listeners all walk through it as well.
[00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:03.019]  I'll narrate it and write down geopolitically what really happened.
[00:21:04.341 --> 00:21:29.176]  In the Middle East, in the last seven years, and how after they took out Gaddafi in Northern Africa, they then transferred that ISIS-Al Qaeda force up from Northern Africa into Syria to then completely break the borders of Europe so that Turkey and Europe could be flooded with the Islamic invasion.
[00:21:29.176 --> 00:21:30.417]  That's the admitted UN plan.
[00:21:32.481 --> 00:21:54.038]  And how to sit there now and blame Trump, when he's saying, okay, I got two bad decisions, but the least bad is to let Turkey go into northern Syria, a place up until, what, World War I or so, that they controlled.
[00:21:54.038 --> 00:21:58.682]  So 100 years ago, 102 years ago or so, Turkey still controlled that area.
[00:22:01.067 --> 00:22:05.271]  And there's constant civil war going on between the Kurds and Turkey.
[00:22:05.271 --> 00:22:15.701]  The United States geopolitically has used the Kurds as a set piece and has used it as an excuse to stay in the region.
[00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:17.483]  And when I talk to U.S.
[00:22:17.483 --> 00:22:20.786]  military, including quote, special forces people, they're so brainwashed.
[00:22:20.786 --> 00:22:23.068]  They go, well, the Kurds are Christians.
[00:22:23.068 --> 00:22:23.548]  No, they're not.
[00:22:23.548 --> 00:22:25.130]  They're 90% plus Muslim.
[00:22:27.503 --> 00:22:33.226]  I mean, just the level of brainwashing our own troops are given about why the Kurds are our buddies and why we need to be there.
[00:22:33.226 --> 00:22:37.469]  Obama launched the entire attack.
[00:22:37.469 --> 00:22:38.809]  They started it, not Trump.
[00:22:38.809 --> 00:22:42.171]  And Trump's absolutely right to say, time to get out of there, time to bring our people home.
[00:22:42.171 --> 00:22:47.374]  We're going to play those clips, start on the next segment, and that's going to be the first big thing we're going to cover.
[00:22:47.374 --> 00:22:55.839]  Then, as I said, I'm going to get into the huge developments in China and how they are extending their control.
[00:22:56.991 --> 00:23:15.201]  Not just through our debt and our media, but in the private companies everywhere and how there is a collapse of resistance to the Chinese edicts.
[00:23:15.201 --> 00:23:23.745]  When I say collapse, I mean they call the shots.
[00:23:23.745 --> 00:23:24.606]  If you're in a room
[00:23:27.162 --> 00:23:33.606]  And there's only one little window and there's a fan blowing through that window and that's the only force coming into the room.
[00:23:33.606 --> 00:23:38.970]  It's going to control what happens in that room.
[00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:41.531]  There's no countervailing force.
[00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:42.912]  None of us stand for anything.
[00:23:42.912 --> 00:23:45.094]  None of us will stand up for anything.
[00:23:45.094 --> 00:23:50.257]  We've had a bunch of jellyfish put in power who were there because they follow orders.
[00:23:50.257 --> 00:23:52.538]  And then now they're killing babies after they're born.
[00:23:52.538 --> 00:23:54.560]  China's openly selling political dissidents organs.
[00:23:56.451 --> 00:24:02.393]  Children are being forcibly sterilized all over the world.
[00:24:02.393 --> 00:24:03.353]  They're tricked into it.
[00:24:03.353 --> 00:24:05.554]  Their parents were thrown aside.
[00:24:05.554 --> 00:24:07.174]  There's genetic engineering going on.
[00:24:07.174 --> 00:24:09.055]  There's human-animal clones being made.
[00:24:09.055 --> 00:24:11.516]  We've gone over the edge.
[00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:14.056]  We're not going over the edge.
[00:24:14.056 --> 00:24:15.137]  We've gone over the edge.
[00:24:15.137 --> 00:24:17.697]  So I'm going to cover all of that.
[00:24:17.697 --> 00:24:21.759]  And then the latest, ladies and gentlemen, with the so-called whistleblowers.
[00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:26.020]  What do you call a disgruntled Democrat that's being taken out of power who's corrupt?
[00:24:26.943 --> 00:24:35.407]  Well, I mean, they all know that Clapper and Brennan and all the usual suspects, like Andy McCabe and all of them that are getting indicted, are discredited.
[00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:42.231]  So they come out and say their names, they'll go, oh, that's a partisan that was involved politically trying to stop Trump using intelligence agencies.
[00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:51.015]  So they call themselves whistleblowers and claim that Trump's doing to them what they did to him.
[00:24:51.015 --> 00:24:53.116]  And now you know the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:54.557]  They did this a couple times last year.
[00:24:55.697 --> 00:24:58.539]  And they're doing it again.
[00:24:58.539 --> 00:25:05.042]  Clapper and Brennan are going on TV saying, Obama ordered us to do the spying, we can't go to jail.
[00:25:05.042 --> 00:25:07.604]  Now that is rats leaving a sinking ship.
[00:25:07.604 --> 00:25:14.688]  So again, they say Trump used executive power to try to stop Biden from winning.
[00:25:14.688 --> 00:25:17.029]  When Biden's a loser, Biden can hardly talk.
[00:25:19.042 --> 00:25:24.165]  Trump has a job to go after corruption when he's giving more money to these countries, and to find out it's not going to Democrats.
[00:25:24.165 --> 00:25:30.748]  He better damn well have asked that question, but they make that the crime.
[00:25:30.748 --> 00:25:32.849]  That's all coming up today.
[00:25:32.849 --> 00:25:46.076]  And then we've got Joel Skousen, World Affairs Brief, hopping in for several segments, and then Lee Stranahan, syndicated talk show host, very informed investigative journalist, as well on all this, and Paul Joseph Watson, big
[00:25:47.332 --> 00:25:53.316]  Four hours lined up, we're now 25 minutes into it.
[00:25:53.316 --> 00:25:59.100]  But let me tell you, I'm gonna reserve my statements for the start of the next segment, but I'm gonna lay it all out.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:07.104]  It's really happening in Syria and where all this is going and what I really think of what Trump's doing for the next segment.
[00:26:07.104 --> 00:26:11.166]  So please stay with us and please share the live link at band.video.
[00:26:11.166 --> 00:26:22.513]  Tell people what the local radio stations you're listening to or local TV stations you're watching because this show goes to number one on every radio station and every cable system or TV system we're on.
[00:26:22.513 --> 00:26:24.574]  That's why they take us off everything.
[00:26:24.574 --> 00:26:26.295]  We've been on cloud TV a year.
[00:26:26.295 --> 00:26:27.556]  We're number one.
[00:26:27.556 --> 00:26:29.717]  More viewers than all the other news shows combined.
[00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:36.215]  That's the blaze, that's OAN, that's all of them, that's RT combined.
[00:26:36.215 --> 00:26:42.201]  Because of you, spreading the word and because of how we don't pull any punches and people know, we know what we're talking about.
[00:26:42.201 --> 00:26:43.802]  You want next year's news today?
[00:26:43.802 --> 00:26:45.024]  You get it here.
[00:26:45.024 --> 00:26:53.252]  I was the first to specifically lay out exactly how the globalists set up communist China to take over the world, gave them one-sided policies.
[00:26:54.585 --> 00:26:59.688]  Gave them all the rare earth minerals, all the secrets, all the codes, and now they're maneuvering us for total collapse.
[00:26:59.688 --> 00:27:08.033]  Now, exactly as I said, is the countervailing Pentagon prospectus and is the truth.
[00:27:08.033 --> 00:27:15.798]  I literally wrote the Future Warfare Doctrine on information warfare response to the CHICOMs, if America wants to survive.
[00:27:15.798 --> 00:27:19.340]  And I'm not bragging, but it's time to just get down to brass tacks.
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.801]  This is the spirit of the Republic.
[00:27:21.801 --> 00:27:23.042]  This broadcast is it.
[00:27:25.219 --> 00:27:32.701]  And I don't mean that to brag, that's a very dangerous position to be in, and it shows how cowardly everybody else was, or how they just bought into all these fake doctrines.
[00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:36.421]  The real globalist doctrine is public!
[00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:46.063]  That said, I got behind this weekend, as you know, I didn't even really plug on the Sunday show, I barely even plugged yesterday because I'm so busy and so focused, and if I don't plug, we won't be here.
[00:27:46.063 --> 00:27:48.524]  I don't promote the great products, plus these are great products you need.
[00:27:49.571 --> 00:28:02.548]  Now tomorrow we are having new specials, but we've had the biggest special since we've had Christmas, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, 50% off on all the supplements and preparedness items like storable foods, water filtration, air filtration.
[00:28:02.548 --> 00:28:04.971]  I have to end the special because we already have.
[00:28:06.121 --> 00:28:07.703]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion sold out.
[00:28:07.703 --> 00:28:09.365]  DNA Force Plus sold out.
[00:28:09.365 --> 00:28:12.588]  Super Silver Skin Cream in the large bottles sold out.
[00:28:12.588 --> 00:28:14.270]  Winter Sun Plus sold out.
[00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:15.391]  Pollen Block sold out.
[00:28:15.391 --> 00:28:17.534]  Bio PCA sold out.
[00:28:17.534 --> 00:28:24.161]  And more than 15 other best-selling items, they're all good sellers, are set to sell out in the next couple days.
[00:28:24.161 --> 00:28:25.722]  So I'm having to end the special.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:35.607]  We're selling out now Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Ultimate Bone Broth, Carnivore, Honor Roll, Super Silver Skin Cream One Ouncers, Super Mel Vitality.
[00:28:35.607 --> 00:28:41.191]  No wonder the Super Silver Cream is selling out with Hyaluronic Acid and all of it.
[00:28:41.191 --> 00:28:42.072]  We sold it at cost.
[00:28:42.072 --> 00:28:45.335]  We made a mistake on the special so tomorrow it's going to like 25% off.
[00:28:47.975 --> 00:28:48.996]  Black Friday comes early.
[00:28:48.996 --> 00:28:49.996]  It all ends today.
[00:28:49.996 --> 00:28:53.058]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:28:53.058 --> 00:28:53.998]  And these are great items.

[00:29:26.784 --> 00:29:34.670]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:36.631]  Not a security IPO or note.

[00:32:38.476 --> 00:32:43.498]  And you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[00:32:43.498 --> 00:32:44.498]  This was amazing.
[00:32:44.498 --> 00:32:46.999]  And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[00:32:46.999 --> 00:32:51.080]  So InfoWars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.862]  And we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at Band.Video.
[00:32:56.682 --> 00:33:02.825]  And I gotta tell you, we've done great video work, we've done great films, we've done so much, but websites are not our thing.
[00:33:02.825 --> 00:33:03.785]  Well, now they are!
[00:33:03.785 --> 00:33:05.626]  I'm so proud of Bandai Video, folks.
[00:33:05.626 --> 00:33:11.669]  Check it out, there's a lot of new features for Bandai Video.
[00:33:11.669 --> 00:33:14.290]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:40.154 --> 00:33:48.897]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:48.897 --> 00:33:52.698]  It's October 8th, 2019 on this Tuesday, Global Edition.
[00:33:52.698 --> 00:33:54.198]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:33:54.198 --> 00:34:06.922]  For radio and TV viewers, I am about to lay out what's really happening in the Middle East and this huge situation between Turkey and Syria and the headlines and AP Reuters everywhere.
[00:34:06.922 --> 00:34:08.823]  The poor Pentagon's stuck between Trump
[00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:13.371]  Turkey and Syria.
[00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:14.692]  And oh, Trump's a buffoon.
[00:34:14.692 --> 00:34:15.872]  Trump's an idiot.
[00:34:15.872 --> 00:34:16.813]  He's compulsive.
[00:34:16.813 --> 00:34:18.453]  He's an idiot.
[00:34:18.453 --> 00:34:21.735]  He's caused the whole crisis in the Middle East.
[00:34:21.735 --> 00:34:28.397]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is a total lie and I'm about to prove it, but anyone can go to the historical record.
[00:34:28.397 --> 00:34:34.720]  Seven plus years ago, right when Benghazi happened, Obama and Hillary let ISIS Al Qaeda forces take over Libya.
[00:34:36.305 --> 00:34:39.446]  Then those forces invaded with Western support.
[00:34:39.446 --> 00:34:41.227]  This was on record.
[00:34:41.227 --> 00:34:46.790]  Remember Senator Rand Paul and Senator Cruz, all of them exposed it.
[00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:56.635]  To go into Syria and try to take over the Ba'athist party that had stabilized the whole region for more than 50 years.
[00:34:56.635 --> 00:35:03.598]  Now, Trump has said that he has to clean up all of Obama's messes.
[00:35:03.598 --> 00:35:05.279]  And that Obama was the founder of ISIS.
[00:35:06.067 --> 00:35:07.287]  Along with Hillary.
[00:35:07.287 --> 00:35:08.548]  And then he had to clean it up.
[00:35:08.548 --> 00:35:11.808]  So we made a deal, let the Russians come in and do most of the fighting.
[00:35:11.808 --> 00:35:12.368]  Clean it out.
[00:35:12.368 --> 00:35:15.709]  We told Iran, you'll have to leave.
[00:35:15.709 --> 00:35:19.350]  And we told Turkey, you're not going to be able to take over either.
[00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.010]  And then, once we stabilize the country, Assad will have elections.
[00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:23.771]  He's agreed to leave.
[00:35:23.771 --> 00:35:26.491]  Well, we're to that point.
[00:35:26.491 --> 00:35:34.873]  Except the 10 million plus, quote, refugees that came from all over the Muslim world to take over Syria.
[00:35:36.032 --> 00:35:36.853]  That's what Muslims do.
[00:35:36.853 --> 00:35:38.775]  They do pilgrimages, jihads.
[00:35:38.775 --> 00:35:43.479]  They came from as far away as Chechnya and the United States and England.
[00:35:43.479 --> 00:35:45.321]  They all came there.
[00:35:45.321 --> 00:35:48.384]  They took over.
[00:35:48.384 --> 00:35:52.128]  Well, now there's estimates of 5 to 10 million.
[00:35:52.128 --> 00:35:53.049]  They say most have left.
[00:35:53.049 --> 00:35:59.555]  Well, we've heard numbers of 2, 3, as high as 4 plus million refugees are in Turkey right now.
[00:35:59.555 --> 00:36:00.576]  I'm going to go over the map in a moment.
[00:36:01.786 --> 00:36:22.428]  So Erdogan has been saying for a year, if you don't give me $23 billion to build settlements in Turkey for these millions of people, and to vet them all, I'm going to push them into Europe, or you can give me $5 billion for the security forces, and I will kick them into Syria where they came from, or they can just go back home.
[00:36:23.237 --> 00:36:23.918]  Just like the U.N.
[00:36:23.918 --> 00:36:37.549]  gives thousands of euros to people to invade Europe, or thousands of dollars to invade here, through Guatemala, people come from Africa, they fly on U.N.-paid planes, and they get a couple thousand dollars on debit cards, no name on them, and they just come up to the U.S.
[00:36:37.549 --> 00:36:41.532]  Erdogan said, I'll give them all a couple thousand euros, give me the money, wherever they came from.
[00:36:41.532 --> 00:36:45.275]  And I'm not defending Erdogan, he's a dictator.
[00:36:45.275 --> 00:36:45.876]  I don't like him.
[00:36:45.876 --> 00:36:49.278]  But he's right in this, and Trump's like, yeah, you're right, these aren't your people.
[00:36:49.278 --> 00:36:51.020]  So, we let them flood Europe?
[00:36:52.574 --> 00:36:55.376]  Or do we let them go back to where they came from?
[00:36:55.376 --> 00:36:56.997]  In Syria.
[00:36:56.997 --> 00:36:58.678]  Because again, Obama started all this.
[00:36:58.678 --> 00:37:02.580]  But here's the president who's right, saying it's time to come back home.
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.241]  He promised to get us out of Syria.
[00:37:04.241 --> 00:37:05.842]  He promised to get us out of Afghanistan.
[00:37:05.842 --> 00:37:07.403]  He's ordered the withdrawal.
[00:37:07.403 --> 00:37:09.304]  It's down to almost nothing in Afghanistan.
[00:37:09.304 --> 00:37:11.305]  And he's now withdrawing everybody out of there.
[00:37:11.305 --> 00:37:16.969]  And Turkey always said, we're going to move in and take over northern Kurdistan because it's always launching attacks on us.
[00:37:18.544 --> 00:37:21.486]  And then that's where they'll kick the invaders back in.
[00:37:21.486 --> 00:37:24.988]  And yeah, it's going to be a mess, because the globalists destabilize it on purpose.
[00:37:24.988 --> 00:37:26.049]  Not our problem.
[00:37:26.049 --> 00:37:27.009]  Trump's fixing it.
[00:37:27.009 --> 00:37:28.410]  Here's the President.
[00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:42.539]  The fact that I was going to bring our soldiers home, and bring them home as rapidly as possible, I, we, all together, you, we defeated and took over 100% of the ISIS caliphate.
[00:37:42.539 --> 00:37:44.940]  Everybody said that was going to be an impossible thing to do.
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.542]  I did it, and I did it quickly, because we have a great military now.
[00:37:48.334 --> 00:37:51.338]  When I took over our military, we didn't have ammunition.
[00:37:51.338 --> 00:37:58.145]  I was told by a top general, maybe the top of them all, sir, I'm sorry sir, we don't have ammunition.
[00:37:58.145 --> 00:38:03.452]  I said I'll never let another president have that happen to him or her.
[00:38:03.452 --> 00:38:04.453]  We didn't have ammunition.
[00:38:05.231 --> 00:38:06.531]  Now we've captured ISIS.
[00:38:06.531 --> 00:38:07.812]  We've done what we've done.
[00:38:07.812 --> 00:38:11.133]  We had 50 soldiers in the area you're talking about.
[00:38:11.133 --> 00:38:13.774]  And I said, we want to bring our soldiers back home.
[00:38:13.774 --> 00:38:15.074]  It's been a long time.
[00:38:15.074 --> 00:38:20.236]  Again, we were supposed to be in there for just a tiny spot, like a 30 to 90 day period.
[00:38:20.236 --> 00:38:21.656]  That was many years ago.
[00:38:21.656 --> 00:38:24.337]  It's time.
[00:38:24.337 --> 00:38:26.578]  Beautiful.
[00:38:26.578 --> 00:38:30.439]  A president doing what he said he'd do, and the left hates him.
[00:38:30.439 --> 00:38:33.040]  Obama launched more wars than Bush did.
[00:38:34.076 --> 00:38:39.158]  And I didn't like those wars because they were destabilizing countries and putting things far worse in.
[00:38:39.158 --> 00:38:39.858]  Look at Iraq.
[00:38:39.858 --> 00:38:40.878]  It's in a civil war.
[00:38:40.878 --> 00:38:43.159]  They're under martial law right now.
[00:38:43.159 --> 00:38:45.500]  The whole Middle East is fighting over control.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.761]  It's what the Muslims do.
[00:38:47.761 --> 00:38:51.302]  They never stop fighting with themselves or anybody else.
[00:38:51.302 --> 00:39:01.426]  Trump said I was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars, America's longest war, Afghanistan, where our great military functions as a policing operation for the benefit of people who don't even like the USA.
[00:39:02.363 --> 00:39:07.164]  The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia and China because they love seeing us bogged down.
[00:39:07.164 --> 00:39:16.027]  Well, it's bigger than that, ladies and gentlemen, because in the case of China, they've never spent one dollar on security in Afghanistan.
[00:39:16.027 --> 00:39:21.248]  We've spent now over a trillion, just past that a month ago, in the last 18 plus years.
[00:39:21.248 --> 00:39:23.289]  Over a trillion.
[00:39:23.289 --> 00:39:27.290]  Where does China get hundreds of billions a year of rare earth minerals?
[00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:28.990]  Afghanistan, right on their border.
[00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:29.710]  So let's continue.
[00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.631]  Let's go to Pat Robertson, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:33.243 --> 00:39:41.942]  Last night saying Trump will... Well here, just see the clip of Pat Robertson quoting the Communist Chinese saying, the mandate of heaven.
[00:39:42.776 --> 00:39:59.984]  They say the Communist Party, that's what Mao said, it's a quote, Mao Zedong said when he took over in 1949, he said the mandate of heaven has now been achieved by the Communist Party and we will rule for a thousand years and China will dominate the globe with our system of Marx and Lenin.
[00:39:59.984 --> 00:40:00.785]  Go pull his quotes up.
[00:40:00.785 --> 00:40:05.627]  You can read pages of this crap with David Rockefeller drooling.
[00:40:05.627 --> 00:40:09.249]  Well here he is quoting Mao Zedong.
[00:40:09.249 --> 00:40:11.110]  Two weeks ago he came out and said abortion's okay.
[00:40:11.897 --> 00:40:12.397]  Yeah.
[00:40:12.397 --> 00:40:14.499]  Time to retire this guy.
[00:40:14.499 --> 00:40:15.300]  Okay?
[00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.902]  So let's hear from El Diablo.
[00:40:18.902 --> 00:40:20.363]  Here's Pat Robertson.
[00:40:20.363 --> 00:40:34.694]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to say right now, I am absolutely appalled that the United States is going to betray those democratic forces in northern Syria, that we possibly are going to allow the Turkish to come in against the Kurds.
[00:40:36.336 --> 00:40:38.018]  Erdogan is a thug.
[00:40:38.018 --> 00:40:42.762]  He has taken control of his country as a dictator.
[00:40:42.762 --> 00:40:49.289]  He is a strong leader and to say he's an ally of America is nonsense.
[00:40:49.289 --> 00:40:50.570]  He is in for himself.
[00:40:51.491 --> 00:41:05.593]  And the President, who allowed Khashoggi to be cut in pieces without any repercussions whatsoever, is now allowing the Christians and the Kurds to be massacred by the Turks.
[00:41:05.593 --> 00:41:18.756]  And I believe, and I want to say this with great solemnity, the President of the United States is in danger of losing the Mandate of Heaven if he permits this to happen.
[00:41:18.756 --> 00:41:19.916]  The Mandate of Heaven.
[00:41:20.711 --> 00:41:24.573]  Now, let's go back to the map, because here are the facts, just at the end of this segment, quickly.
[00:41:24.573 --> 00:41:27.294]  Here are the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:27.294 --> 00:41:31.576]  The globalists went in and took out the Ba'athist party that stabilized Iraq for more than 50 years.
[00:41:31.576 --> 00:41:32.836]  All civil war then broke out.
[00:41:32.836 --> 00:41:34.077]  It's still going on today.
[00:41:34.077 --> 00:41:35.498]  Over 3 million dead.
[00:41:35.498 --> 00:41:38.519]  Sanctions put on by the Clintons killed half of those.
[00:41:38.519 --> 00:41:43.741]  You got Syria, attacked 7 years ago by Obama, Hillary, and the globalists, broken up in all these parts.
[00:41:43.741 --> 00:41:44.802]  Now, it's been cleaned out.
[00:41:45.885 --> 00:41:57.516]  Now the millions that have come into Turkey had to be pushed back in, or Turkey's going to dump them into Europe and open that causeway into Europe for the Islamification, which the globalists and Obama admit was their plan all along.
[00:41:57.516 --> 00:42:02.220]  So this is the best of all the bad deals there are, and it's not our business what
[00:42:03.578 --> 00:42:07.862]  What does Saudi Arabia and Turkey do with each other if they're killing each other's operatives?
[00:42:07.862 --> 00:42:08.843]  Like Khashoggi.
[00:42:08.843 --> 00:42:09.964]  Like Trump's God.
[00:42:09.964 --> 00:42:11.545]  Like he's supposed to tell everybody what to do.
[00:42:11.545 --> 00:42:12.266]  Trump's not God.
[00:42:12.266 --> 00:42:13.307]  He's trying to be the president.
[00:42:13.307 --> 00:42:18.532]  But you see, Pat Robertson says Trump will lose the mandate of heaven like he's God.
[00:42:18.532 --> 00:42:23.016]  The truth is these neocons and globalists have sold America out and almost bankrupted us with all of this.
[00:42:24.554 --> 00:42:35.784]  They're the ones that have run the country into the ground and now they want to say Trump doesn't have the mandate of God if he doesn't lie to everybody and violate his campaign promises and keep all this crap going.
[00:42:35.784 --> 00:42:36.665]  Hey!
[00:42:36.665 --> 00:42:37.926]  Pat Robertson!
[00:42:37.926 --> 00:42:40.228]  Obama hates God!
[00:42:40.228 --> 00:42:42.110]  Obama kills babies after they're born!
[00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:43.151]  Obama's a globalist!
[00:42:43.151 --> 00:42:48.156]  Obama helped fund Al Qaeda and ISIS to take over that area and kill hundreds of thousands of women and children!
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:54.747]  Why don't you talk about how Obama launched the attack to bring down the sovereign country and create the whole mess?
[00:42:54.747 --> 00:42:56.249]  No, now it's Trump's fault!
[00:42:56.249 --> 00:43:02.237]  You guys burned the house down, Trump shows up with a firetruck, you say he's not shooting the water on the dam's smoldering embers right!
[00:43:02.237 --> 00:43:04.140]  AHHHHH!
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.742]  IT'S INFOWAR!
[00:43:05.742 --> 00:43:06.423]  STAY WITH US!
[00:43:08.117 --> 00:43:15.425]  The globalists and their democrat minions are on the verge of taking this cold civil war hot.
[00:43:15.425 --> 00:43:27.217]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship and sabotage of the economy and attacks run by the UN on the border that are nothing short of war!
[00:43:27.697 --> 00:43:38.182]  And that's because it is a war by multinational corporations allied with the Psycoms and others with the Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating filth to try to capture the United States.
[00:43:38.182 --> 00:43:41.023]  This is 21st century war.
[00:43:41.023 --> 00:43:43.844]  And wars need money to be prosecuted.
[00:43:43.844 --> 00:43:45.085]  And we're actually winning the war.
[00:43:45.465 --> 00:43:47.626]  The enemy's throwing their full weight at us right now.
[00:43:47.626 --> 00:43:49.107]  That's why we need financial support.
[00:43:49.107 --> 00:43:50.728]  It's a total 360 win.
[00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:51.689]  Double pay for your points.
[00:43:51.689 --> 00:43:52.770]  50% off.

[00:43:54.491 --> 00:43:57.172]  We're running out of a lot of these products at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:43:57.172 --> 00:44:03.676]  But I need you to get in there, step to the plate, get high quality products you already need, and fund the information war.

[00:44:33.916 --> 00:44:35.578]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[00:44:36.158 --> 00:44:38.259]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.

[00:45:09.464 --> 00:45:11.265]  I'm up here with the crew.
[00:45:11.265 --> 00:45:16.827]  It's late at night, but I can't leave the office because history's happening right now.
[00:45:16.827 --> 00:45:21.909]  This is a battle of wills between those that want a free world and those that want tyranny.
[00:45:21.909 --> 00:45:25.231]  Those who've bet against humanity and those who've bet on humanity.
[00:45:25.971 --> 00:45:27.693]  So I'm so thankful to you, the listeners.
[00:45:27.693 --> 00:45:28.874]  You are the salt of the earth.
[00:45:28.874 --> 00:45:34.600]  You're the people that understand what's happening and who've helped launch a worldwide revolution against tyranny.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:47.133]  So I thank you again, but please understand how important you are and understand that your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support is absolutely more critical than ever, not just for President Trump, but for him, for worse, who is President Trump's bullhorn of
[00:45:47.273 --> 00:45:48.914]  Nationalism and patriotism.

[00:46:09.425 --> 00:46:15.148]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[00:46:15.148 --> 00:46:29.975]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're gonna have an authoritarian corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic immunity, that runs around saying it's communist and socialist, power to the people, but then meanwhile is tax-exempt again offshore?
[00:46:29.975 --> 00:46:31.076]  Well, Trump got that.
[00:46:31.656 --> 00:46:33.578]  And all these other populists get it.
[00:46:33.578 --> 00:46:42.606]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures just so you can say the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller put in power are better than everybody?
[00:46:42.606 --> 00:46:45.449]  That is a sick, freakish joke!
[00:46:45.449 --> 00:46:49.253]  And I will not stand by and watch humanity turned over to these people.
[00:46:49.253 --> 00:46:55.559]  And I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat!
[00:46:55.879 --> 00:47:00.984]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is great!
[00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:03.346]  Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ!
[00:47:03.346 --> 00:47:12.655]  And now let's move forward against the NWO!
[00:47:12.655 --> 00:47:15.337]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:28.217 --> 00:47:33.741]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:33.741 --> 00:47:42.108]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:42.108 --> 00:47:54.518]  It's Tuesday, October 8th, 2019, and I'm wearing, and I'll sponsor, a gray Stetson Open Road hat.
[00:47:55.894 --> 00:47:58.395]  Why am I doing that starting this segment?
[00:47:58.395 --> 00:48:07.020]  You know, I've noticed if I wear a pair of sunglasses on the show when I talk about something or I'm outside when we're doing the news feed, people just pay attention more.
[00:48:07.020 --> 00:48:15.464]  But I was walking out the door this morning and I decided, well, I'm not really going out on the range or anything.
[00:48:15.464 --> 00:48:17.485]  I'm not going to the family ranch.
[00:48:17.485 --> 00:48:20.867]  Every once in a while, they'll actually take a cowboy hat with me.
[00:48:20.867 --> 00:48:22.188]  We're going to be riding horses or something.
[00:48:22.964 --> 00:48:30.206]  I'm one of the few folks you'll see that every once in a while wears a cowboy hat that actually owns some cattle through our family ranch.
[00:48:30.206 --> 00:48:38.469]  But I thought I ought to wear the hat just to make people think about a little bit of nostalgia.
[00:48:38.469 --> 00:48:41.970]  Because this is the real type of cowboy hat people wore.
[00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:46.371]  Hollywood popularized the big giant jug hats and all the rest of that.
[00:48:46.371 --> 00:48:48.372]  But this is what cowboys actually wear right here.
[00:48:50.037 --> 00:48:54.180]  Unless you're on a really big, long trail ride, then that'll be a little bit bigger straw hat.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.522]  But this is a real cowboy hat right here.
[00:48:56.522 --> 00:48:58.904]  This is what they look like.
[00:48:58.904 --> 00:49:01.226]  Not the stuff you see in Hollywood.
[00:49:01.226 --> 00:49:04.529]  Both my grandfathers wore this.
[00:49:04.529 --> 00:49:06.370]  Like my dad's got his dad somewhere.
[00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.591]  Motor oil all over it.
[00:49:07.591 --> 00:49:09.613]  Holes in it.
[00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:12.015]  Awesome hat.
[00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:18.440]  But the reason I'm wearing this hat is, again, just to get people out of their normal zone.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:19.461]  And just think about how
[00:49:21.365 --> 00:49:24.906]  Nancy Pelosi and Schiff, you know, they're the chairman of committees.
[00:49:24.906 --> 00:49:26.987]  She's the Speaker of the House.
[00:49:26.987 --> 00:49:30.488]  And so she sits there with this so-called authority.
[00:49:30.488 --> 00:49:33.469]  But really, she's just wearing a costume.
[00:49:33.469 --> 00:49:38.590]  Because she works for the globalists and the sellout of the nation.
[00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:43.171]  And so somebody wearing a big cowboy hat doesn't necessarily own any cattle.
[00:49:43.171 --> 00:49:46.072]  It's the saying, all hat, no cattle.
[00:49:46.072 --> 00:49:48.033]  It's kind of like saying a mile wide, an inch deep.
[00:49:50.401 --> 00:49:54.064]  And that's really what it comes down to is what made America different.
[00:49:54.064 --> 00:49:57.046]  It's that we strove to have more freedom.
[00:49:57.046 --> 00:50:19.085]  We strove with our imperfect union to try to find a better place and to have more freedom and to free the slaves and empower women and a place where people could come out of caste systems, out of systems where there was the rich and everybody else the poor, and to come to a nation where they had a chance to really fulfill their dreams.
[00:50:20.592 --> 00:50:26.776]  That's the American dream is being able to have a chance to follow your dream, not a guarantee.
[00:50:26.776 --> 00:50:36.162]  Anyone guaranteeing you some utopia is a cult leader and will only deliver hell.
[00:50:36.162 --> 00:50:46.669]  Now, the next story I'm going to get into is of the greatest import because it shows really positive things are happening.
[00:50:48.476 --> 00:50:58.202]  A lot of folks just now waking up will say, no, negative things are happening, but that's not the case.
[00:50:58.202 --> 00:51:14.652]  China, for well over a decade, has been basically in control of our media, because any criticism of what they're doing results in that media not just having its own systems banned in China, but any companies associated with it blocked.
[00:51:16.755 --> 00:51:22.598]  And so now the good news is this has been happening for a long time.
[00:51:47.671 --> 00:51:51.873]  But just now, is there a big, giant debate about it?
[00:51:51.873 --> 00:52:00.797]  Because when this stuff has been going on by stealth, I would get up here and say, hey, you know, most of these films have to get approved by Chinese censors.
[00:52:00.797 --> 00:52:06.800]  Not just for distribution in China, but for release period.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:16.685]  Because the majority of the stock and management in the big six Hollywood studios is now Chai Com owned and run.
[00:52:19.215 --> 00:52:35.319]  So when you see all the vile race war, and all the vile garbage, and all the anti-American propaganda, and America sucks, and people taking a knee at the Super Bowl, and Nike producing its tennis shoes in China, that's all paid for by the CHICOMS.
[00:52:35.319 --> 00:52:37.679]  They are doing that to demoralize us.
[00:52:37.679 --> 00:52:41.660]  And so there's a debate now about, oh, China
[00:52:44.682 --> 00:52:49.424]  Is telling us what we can and can't say in America and approving most of the movies and scripts.
[00:52:49.424 --> 00:52:50.084]  That's terrible.
[00:52:50.084 --> 00:52:50.985]  That's un-American.
[00:52:50.985 --> 00:52:52.466]  We've sold our soul for money.
[00:52:52.466 --> 00:52:54.286]  But it's way beyond money.
[00:52:54.286 --> 00:52:58.008]  Our establishment put communists in charge in 1949.
[00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:00.449]  That's public.
[00:53:00.449 --> 00:53:04.511]  To set them up as the managed economy to dominate the entire world.
[00:53:04.511 --> 00:53:06.632]  The ring of Mordor.
[00:53:06.632 --> 00:53:08.873]  One ring.
[00:53:08.873 --> 00:53:09.793]  To find them.
[00:53:09.793 --> 00:53:13.335]  One ring to call them together and in the darkness bind them.
[00:53:15.606 --> 00:53:20.367]  So of course Nike pulls an American flag off their shoe and says it's evil.
[00:53:20.367 --> 00:53:23.008]  They're Chicom.
[00:53:23.008 --> 00:53:28.350]  Of course Gillette comes out and says families are inherently bad in America and men are inherently evil.
[00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:29.850]  It's Chicom.
[00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:32.851]  Controlled.
[00:53:32.851 --> 00:53:40.473]  Because they've got a state-run system there that has produced tens upon tens of trillions of fiat currency and has bought everyone off.
[00:53:40.473 --> 00:53:42.514]  They are the ones devaluing currency worldwide.
[00:53:47.878 --> 00:54:01.627]  This has been the plan to take us down, but the globalists needed a base outside of America that was powerful and had a billion people and had trillions of fake dollars and had hard-working smart people that would carry out orders.
[00:54:01.627 --> 00:54:08.192]  And you can see now the spiritual and cultural sickness and how we are on death's doorstep as a nation.
[00:54:08.192 --> 00:54:14.496]  But with Trump and Infowars and you, we are fighting back because we know what's happening now.
[00:54:18.174 --> 00:54:29.100]  And so, the Rockets General Manager just a few days ago says, I stand with the demonstrators in Hong Kong who want basic freedom.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.762]  Who have a deal that China wouldn't take them over for decades.
[00:54:31.762 --> 00:54:34.103]  Who have a deal that they have basic freedoms that the Chinese don't have.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.881]  And then the team said, oh, we'll fire him.
[00:54:41.881 --> 00:54:42.982]  Oh, we apologize.
[00:54:42.982 --> 00:54:44.763]  China then cancelled games.
[00:54:44.763 --> 00:54:46.884]  Tencent, the company that bought Reddit.
[00:54:46.884 --> 00:54:49.945]  They bought Reddit for $150 million.
[00:54:49.945 --> 00:54:52.947]  Banned the Donald right after they bought it.
[00:54:52.947 --> 00:54:55.368]  Election meddling right there.
[00:54:55.368 --> 00:54:57.149]  Trump's biggest website was the Donald subreddit.
[00:54:57.149 --> 00:54:58.990]  About 10 million visitors a day.
[00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.370]  Not anymore.
[00:54:59.370 --> 00:54:59.851]  It's all gone.
[00:54:59.851 --> 00:55:01.992]  It's all frozen.
[00:55:01.992 --> 00:55:05.834]  That same group owns the distribution of the NBA with 668 million viewers per season.
[00:55:11.767 --> 00:55:14.869]  And they said, uh-uh, we're not going to show it.
[00:55:14.869 --> 00:55:15.549]  We're going to block it.
[00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:19.192]  We're going to block all the games of the Rockets.
[00:55:19.192 --> 00:55:22.654]  Because you didn't submit, even though you're groveling and apologizing, it's not enough.
[00:55:22.654 --> 00:55:30.419]  And then the Chinese communists complained, oh, we saw Tiffany's ad in a magazine of a woman covering her eye, like, oh, she's so excited with a diamond ring.
[00:55:30.419 --> 00:55:33.080]  We think that's secret code against us.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.181]  Ban it.
[00:55:34.181 --> 00:55:35.962]  Just like Winnie the Pooh's ban.
[00:55:35.962 --> 00:55:40.005]  And just like Disney's agreed to have no Winnie the Pooh characters and anything put in China.
[00:55:41.442 --> 00:55:43.623]  Because Xi Jinping doesn't like Winnie the Pooh.
[00:55:43.623 --> 00:55:45.283]  By the way, that's not a joke.
[00:55:45.283 --> 00:55:46.824]  You say, well, that doesn't make sense.
[00:55:46.824 --> 00:55:48.704]  Doesn't make sense to say, don't say mother or father.
[00:55:48.704 --> 00:55:50.285]  It's a hate term.
[00:55:50.285 --> 00:55:52.006]  Doesn't make sense to say men can have babies.
[00:55:52.006 --> 00:55:53.106]  It's not true.
[00:55:53.106 --> 00:55:58.848]  If authoritarians can make you say 2 plus 2 equals 10, they've broken your will.
[00:55:58.848 --> 00:56:00.128]  It's called double think.
[00:56:00.128 --> 00:56:01.049]  Crime stop.
[00:56:01.049 --> 00:56:04.310]  Read 1984.
[00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:08.471]  He was a member of the Communist Party, the Fabian Socialists in England.
[00:56:08.471 --> 00:56:09.491]  Eric Blair.
[00:56:09.491 --> 00:56:10.792]  George Orwell was his pen name.
[00:56:11.752 --> 00:56:13.933]  He was Winston Smith of the BBC.
[00:56:13.933 --> 00:56:15.354]  For the OSS.
[00:56:15.354 --> 00:56:16.395]  For the CIA.
[00:56:16.395 --> 00:56:21.558]  For MI6.
[00:56:21.558 --> 00:56:23.860]  And he wrote a book about the future we live under.
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:26.041]  And this is it.
[00:56:26.041 --> 00:56:27.942]  We're winning the poos in prison.
[00:56:27.942 --> 00:56:29.483]  We're 2 million people are in death camps.
[00:56:29.483 --> 00:56:31.024]  We're trying to advertise this.
[00:56:31.024 --> 00:56:32.685]  They sell political dissidence organs.
[00:56:32.685 --> 00:56:33.966]  And people just can't believe it.
[00:56:33.966 --> 00:56:36.387]  Hell, we keep babies alive here and do it!
[00:56:36.387 --> 00:56:38.969]  Evil is exercising itself out in the open.
[00:56:40.367 --> 00:56:51.976]  When we come back, I'm going to play the groveling in the NBA and all the rest of it, and then the lone media outlet, Comedy Central, Viacom of all places, biggest media company in the U.S.
[00:56:51.976 --> 00:57:00.343]  saying no, we'll allow them to do this, but China has banned the episode, and we're going to play large excerpts of it that's very factual and very accurate.
[00:57:00.343 --> 00:57:03.326]  They catch you with marijuana, they execute you.
[00:57:03.326 --> 00:57:05.307]  You're gay, they kill you.
[00:57:05.307 --> 00:57:05.688]  And again,
[00:57:06.388 --> 00:57:07.929]  The left doesn't care about that.
[00:57:07.929 --> 00:57:09.651]  They want power!
[00:57:09.651 --> 00:57:17.617]  And if they think the godless Chai Kams can overthrow America, they spiritually feel satisfied on the left because it's a spiritual battle.
[00:57:17.617 --> 00:57:22.021]  Even though it will destroy their own future, they want to burn it all down!
[00:57:22.021 --> 00:57:23.602]  Everything must go!
[00:57:23.602 --> 00:57:26.825]  That's the first sign you see in Joker.
[00:57:26.825 --> 00:57:28.326]  And no one in the review points it out.
[00:57:28.326 --> 00:57:29.287]  Here he is with a big sign.
[00:57:29.287 --> 00:57:30.448]  Everything must go.
[00:57:30.448 --> 00:57:31.569]  Everything must burn.
[00:57:31.569 --> 00:57:32.510]  Everything must fall.
[00:57:35.498 --> 00:57:38.299]  So the Uber mention can rise out of the mud.
[00:57:38.299 --> 00:57:42.541]  The beautiful... Nile Lily.
[00:57:42.541 --> 00:57:44.401]  It's all sick.
[00:57:44.401 --> 00:57:47.402]  They sold the poison, they poisoned the country, they killed it.
[00:57:47.402 --> 00:57:51.044]  Now they tell you it's about to collapse and that they'll rise up out of it.
[00:57:51.044 --> 00:57:53.605]  I'll be dead before I see that!
[00:57:53.605 --> 00:57:55.205]  You'll never succeed.
[00:57:55.205 --> 00:57:56.386]  Hour 2, straight ahead.
[00:57:59.471 --> 00:58:01.932]  The gauntlet has been thrown down.
[00:58:01.932 --> 00:58:08.153]  Every major Democrat candidate has come out and said they want to confiscate all semi-auto firearms.
[00:58:08.153 --> 00:58:13.274]  And now Buttigieg has come out and said that it's about political power.
[00:58:13.274 --> 00:58:14.694]  That's why they want the guns.
[00:58:14.694 --> 00:58:16.935]  Well, finally they're being honest.
[00:58:16.935 --> 00:58:20.495]  Because all their lies haven't gotten to the point they want.
[00:58:20.495 --> 00:58:22.836]  So now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny.
[00:58:23.516 --> 00:58:26.037]  It shows what incredible followers these people are.
[00:58:26.037 --> 00:58:29.418]  The globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war.
[00:58:29.418 --> 00:58:35.299]  And they know that the minions trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position in that civil war.
[00:58:35.299 --> 00:58:37.540]  But it's up to us to understand the big picture.
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:42.521]  To carry the fight to the enemy in the information war before they can kick off a hot civil war.
[00:58:42.901 --> 00:58:45.304]  That's our mission, if you choose to accept it.
[00:58:45.304 --> 00:58:53.715]  So please, spread the word about InfoWars.com, port slash show, band dot video, and all the powerful transmissions and reports, and take advantage of store-wide free shipping.
[00:58:53.715 --> 00:58:57.220]  Double Patriot points, 50% off, it's about to end, at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:58:59.321 --> 00:59:02.103]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish.
[00:59:02.103 --> 00:59:04.044]  They think the West is dead.
[00:59:04.044 --> 00:59:07.606]  They think if they censor nationalists and patriots off the internet, you'll just forget about us.
[00:59:07.606 --> 00:59:09.447]  And then they'll be the only information out there.
[00:59:09.447 --> 00:59:11.969]  Well, so far, that's not been working too well for them.
[00:59:11.969 --> 00:59:18.833]  Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly that the resistance to globalism is alive and well at Banned.Video.
[00:59:18.833 --> 00:59:19.974]  And now we've added a lot of
[00:59:19.974 --> 00:59:20.394]  I think so.
[00:59:43.473 --> 00:59:54.483]  The power of America, the power of freedom, the power to build a better world and stand in the face of the censors and the tyrants is alive and stronger than ever at Band.Video.
[00:59:54.483 --> 00:59:57.646]  But it's up to you to unleash its full potential.
[00:59:57.646 --> 01:00:02.150]  Band.Video.
[01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:04.812]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:27.602]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.602 --> 01:00:34.546]  So, most of the NBA put their tail between their legs and began peeing on themselves like a little puppy does when it's scared.
[01:00:34.546 --> 01:00:41.111]  When the Chai Kong said we'll ban the NBA in China, the most popular sport there.
[01:00:41.111 --> 01:00:42.732]  Basketball's huge in North Korea, as you've noticed.
[01:00:42.732 --> 01:00:44.053]  They just love it.
[01:00:44.053 --> 01:00:46.735]  It's one of the most watchable sports.
[01:00:46.735 --> 01:00:47.315]  I'll agree with them.
[01:00:47.315 --> 01:00:48.616]  I like track and field personally, but
[01:00:51.957 --> 01:00:53.917]  We're literally losing our soul here.
[01:00:53.917 --> 01:01:02.439]  So now the NBA chairman Adam Silber came out and countered other top NBA owners and others groveling and said, no, no, we stand for free speech.
[01:01:02.439 --> 01:01:06.359]  Well, now they've banned the Lakers game coming up.
[01:01:06.359 --> 01:01:07.720]  So they're just banning more, more, more.
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:07.980]  Good.
[01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:10.060]  Let's call their whole bluff.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.741]  China wasn't self-sustaining.
[01:01:12.741 --> 01:01:15.261]  They didn't have their own oil, their own minerals, anything.
[01:01:15.261 --> 01:01:18.041]  The globalists gave them everything.
[01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:19.542]  And the people got none of it.
[01:01:19.542 --> 01:01:21.082]  The people got herded off their land.
[01:01:22.575 --> 01:01:23.035]  No, you're not.
[01:01:23.035 --> 01:01:24.436]  You're not gonna see that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:24.436 --> 01:01:25.776]  You're not gonna see that.
[01:01:25.776 --> 01:01:26.317]  I don't think.
[01:01:26.317 --> 01:01:28.457]  Because look at James Harden, the NBA player.
[01:01:44.807 --> 01:01:45.467]  We apologize, you know.
[01:02:02.927 --> 01:02:03.807]  You know, we love China.
[01:02:03.807 --> 01:02:06.249]  We love, you know, playing there.
[01:02:06.249 --> 01:02:11.291]  I know for both of us individually, we go there, you know, once or twice a year.
[01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:12.632]  They show us the most important love.
[01:02:12.632 --> 01:02:17.114]  So, you know, we appreciate them as a fan base and we love everything, you know, they're about.
[01:02:17.114 --> 01:02:22.077]  And, you know, we appreciate their support that they give us individually and as an organization.
[01:02:22.077 --> 01:02:25.218]  So, you know, we love you.
[01:02:25.218 --> 01:02:27.300]  They show us the most important love.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:27.920]  You mean money?
[01:02:29.633 --> 01:02:36.436]  You know, the NBA exists, America exists, and all this diversity of ideas, which is definitely a strength.
[01:02:36.436 --> 01:02:41.158]  If you embrace the diversity of ideas instead of being police state and telling people what to think.
[01:02:41.158 --> 01:02:43.920]  It all came out of America, dumbass.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.021]  Didn't come out of Communist China.
[01:02:47.021 --> 01:02:50.362]  And so, that's what they're all doing, except a few people.
[01:02:50.362 --> 01:02:55.365]  And again, you've got the manager of the Rockets, who apologized and groveled.
[01:02:55.365 --> 01:02:56.785]  In fact, will you print me his apology?
[01:02:56.785 --> 01:02:57.566]  I saw it a few days ago.
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:01.021]  We're going to cover it all when we come back.
[01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:06.184]  And then I'm going to air excerpts from South Park that knocks it out of the park.
[01:03:06.184 --> 01:03:07.745]  Good for South Park.
[01:03:07.745 --> 01:03:12.788]  And they put out their official apology to China.
[01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:16.289]  Official apology to China from Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
[01:03:16.289 --> 01:03:20.772]  Like the NBA, we welcome the Chinese censors in our homes and into our hearts.
[01:03:20.772 --> 01:03:23.513]  We too love money more than freedom and democracy.
[01:03:23.513 --> 01:03:26.395]  Xi doesn't look just like Winnie the Pooh at all.
[01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:30.450]  Tune in to our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10.
[01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:32.851]  Long live the great Communist Party of China.
[01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:37.713]  May this autumn's sorghum harvest be bountiful.
[01:03:37.713 --> 01:03:41.814]  We good now, China?
[01:03:41.814 --> 01:03:43.275]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:43.275 --> 01:03:53.639]  And China and the Communists that our own corrupt rulers put in power 70 years ago, they just celebrated it last week by murdering a bunch of innocent people and shooting them and starving them and killing them.
[01:03:55.538 --> 01:04:01.741]  Videos got released of them marching people at concentration camps off to execution.
[01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:07.324]  Our response, ladies and gentlemen, is supposedly just to grovel to all of this and just roll over to it.
[01:04:07.324 --> 01:04:14.208]  But the good news is, it's now all out in the open.
[01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:15.488]  It's now all out in the open.
[01:04:15.488 --> 01:04:23.793]  And by setting up a climate of hardworking, smart people that are slaves, a billion plus of them, with no environmental standards, electricity three times cheaper,
[01:04:26.252 --> 01:04:34.884]  Everyone should go move their business to China, make a little extra money up front, but lose everything in the process and be de-industrialized.
[01:04:35.899 --> 01:04:37.780]  You can barely buy anything that isn't made in China.
[01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:38.240]  I understand.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.721]  It's just like the internet.
[01:04:39.721 --> 01:04:44.183]  They get you all on the big tech, all on Google, all on Facebook, all on Twitter, all on YouTube.
[01:04:44.183 --> 01:04:48.285]  And then they start taking it away incrementally, because you're on their platform, until you have nothing.
[01:04:48.285 --> 01:04:49.346]  You invested in them.
[01:04:49.346 --> 01:04:50.367]  You made the content.
[01:04:50.367 --> 01:04:51.367]  You pushed them.
[01:04:51.367 --> 01:04:52.388]  You made YouTube.
[01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.008]  You made all these things.
[01:04:54.008 --> 01:04:55.689]  Now they've made you dependent on them.
[01:04:55.689 --> 01:04:57.570]  They're telling you how to think and what to do.
[01:04:57.570 --> 01:04:58.711]  They're absorbing you.
[01:04:58.711 --> 01:04:59.771]  It's all been planned.
[01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:02.533]  And big tech works with the chi-coms in the censorship.
[01:05:18.297 --> 01:05:22.599]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[01:05:22.599 --> 01:05:26.100]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:29.362]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[01:05:29.362 --> 01:05:32.903]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[01:05:32.903 --> 01:05:35.164]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:36.565]  I suggest Band.Video.
[01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:42.708]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[01:05:42.708 --> 01:05:51.173]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[01:05:51.173 --> 01:05:57.877]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[01:05:57.877 --> 01:06:00.699]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[01:06:08.086 --> 01:06:08.706]  You've got it.
[01:06:08.706 --> 01:06:15.209]  This transmission is coming to you.
[01:06:15.209 --> 01:06:19.611]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:19.611 --> 01:06:25.254]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:50.151 --> 01:06:53.173]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[01:06:53.173 --> 01:06:56.255]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:06:56.255 --> 01:07:07.341]  And this whole situation with Communist China, controlling our banks, controlling our currency, controlling almost all of our resources now, is hitting the news everywhere.
[01:07:07.341 --> 01:07:09.302]  South Park's been banned in China.
[01:07:09.302 --> 01:07:18.568]  All these NBA games are being banned, all because a manager of the Rockets said he supports the demonstrators and their right to demonstrate and have freedom in Hong Kong.
[01:07:19.434 --> 01:07:24.115]  Tiffany's had an ad with a woman with a diamond ring on covering her eye like she was so excited.
[01:07:24.115 --> 01:07:26.776]  China said that was secret code to the protesters.
[01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:30.237]  They apologized, removed the ad.
[01:07:30.237 --> 01:07:36.259]  Nike removes American flags off when the NBA and NFL players don't like it.
[01:07:36.259 --> 01:07:39.500]  But don't expect any people to be kneeling and getting on their knees.
[01:07:41.803 --> 01:07:45.844]  When the Chinese anthem is played with all these exhibition games in China.
[01:07:45.844 --> 01:07:53.905]  Because they only bash America because they're on the Hollywood globalist payroll and Chi-Com payroll that owns Hollywood to do that.
[01:07:53.905 --> 01:08:01.826]  Well, since you'll bash America and say how much freedom sucks, the next step is to worship China.
[01:08:01.826 --> 01:08:05.687]  But South Park hasn't bowed to them.
[01:08:05.687 --> 01:08:11.088]  Put out a powerful episode, I'm going to play some excerpts of, where it shows the local control in America versus the control in China.
[01:08:12.841 --> 01:08:19.024]  And now the kids are starting a boy band, and the producer comes by and says, well, China's gonna run this.
[01:08:19.024 --> 01:08:21.144]  And so they have to approve the script.
[01:08:21.144 --> 01:08:24.526]  Well, you can't talk about how your sick friend needs an organ, because China's selling organs.
[01:08:24.526 --> 01:08:30.468]  And you can't talk about how America's great, because America sucks.
[01:08:30.468 --> 01:08:32.729]  You can't criticize authority, because China won't allow that.
[01:08:32.729 --> 01:08:38.272]  And you can't talk about, you know, somebody being gay, because China executes you for that.
[01:08:38.272 --> 01:08:41.193]  But then the dad who owns a marijuana farm of weaponized dope,
[01:08:42.674 --> 01:08:44.255]  Flies over to China thinking they'll be like us.
[01:08:44.255 --> 01:08:47.258]  He gets arrested and put in a death camp.
[01:08:47.258 --> 01:08:50.341]  But later he learns, oh, I'll just get them to say you need to buy integrity.
[01:08:50.341 --> 01:08:51.482]  I stay on my farm.
[01:08:51.482 --> 01:08:54.165]  So they buy his farm so China has integrity.
[01:08:54.165 --> 01:08:56.787]  Showing the soulless of the chi-comps.
[01:08:56.787 --> 01:09:05.115]  So then he runs around the dad, kills Winnie the Pooh, supports all the tyranny, censorship, because he has integrity when they bought it from him.
[01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:11.452]  So it all shows, really, genius level sophistication at multiple levels.
[01:09:11.452 --> 01:09:14.554]  But also it has a kid level for young people watching it.
[01:09:14.554 --> 01:09:16.075]  It is an adult program, obviously.
[01:09:16.075 --> 01:09:17.796]  We bleeped it out.
[01:09:17.796 --> 01:09:22.360]  But that illustrates everything we're dealing with.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.802]  But Joker is, oh, beautiful loser killing people.
[01:09:25.802 --> 01:09:26.883]  Oh, it's genius.
[01:09:26.883 --> 01:09:27.684]  Oh, it's so smart.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:38.423]  Well, I could sit there and chain somebody up and pull their teeth out with pliers and shoot HD of it, and you'd call it genius because it was so damn intense.
[01:09:38.423 --> 01:09:39.123]  It's not.
[01:09:39.123 --> 01:09:40.703]  It's meant to be cultural poison.
[01:09:40.703 --> 01:09:42.304]  Trigger mass shootings.
[01:09:42.304 --> 01:09:55.869]  Take all these desperate people, disenfranchised, made desperate, made alone, on purpose by the system, actually classified, to now tell you you're beautiful and wonderful, come out of your cocoon, murder people, have an uprising, antifa, you'll be somebody!
[01:09:55.869 --> 01:09:57.089]  That's all CHICOM funded.
[01:09:57.089 --> 01:09:59.990]  You know a Chinese-controlled production house put the movie out.
[01:10:01.937 --> 01:10:04.579]  And they put all the other ones out.
[01:10:04.579 --> 01:10:12.245]  You ever wonder why almost every movie the Chi-Coms are the heroes?
[01:10:12.245 --> 01:10:16.568]  So, let's go ahead and go to Adam Silver, who first groveled to the Chi-Coms.
[01:10:16.568 --> 01:10:17.669]  There was a backlash.
[01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:21.652]  So he came out and said, let's just all accept free expression, but we also understand China.
[01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:22.333]  Oh, that's not enough.
[01:10:22.333 --> 01:10:23.834]  Now they're going to ban all the games.
[01:10:23.834 --> 01:10:24.575]  Ban the Lakers.
[01:10:27.148 --> 01:10:29.509]  Versus the Nets.
[01:10:29.509 --> 01:10:38.534]  Because once you give in to a pirate, once you give in to a blackmailer, once you give in, once you ban Alex Jones, well next week it's Mitch McConnell getting banned on Twitter.
[01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:41.095]  Because the tyrants tested you and you failed.
[01:10:41.095 --> 01:10:42.135]  You gave in.
[01:10:42.135 --> 01:10:42.936]  You submitted.
[01:10:42.936 --> 01:10:45.997]  You weren't Americans.
[01:10:45.997 --> 01:10:47.618]  Think John Wayne tried to take your free speech?
[01:10:51.027 --> 01:10:55.733]  Only if you're trying to corrupt little kids, then the left goes, oh, you're censoring us.
[01:10:55.733 --> 01:10:57.455]  No, that's going after kids.
[01:10:57.455 --> 01:11:00.018]  But now, the sky's the limit, you notice.
[01:11:00.018 --> 01:11:06.005]  The left totally is the guard dog of censorship, not the guard dog of freedom of speech.
[01:11:06.005 --> 01:11:07.567]  So let's go to Adam Silver.
[01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:07.868]  Here it is.
[01:11:09.689 --> 01:11:22.397]  Essentially, what I've said in that statement is the long-held values of the NBA are to support freedom of expression, and certainly freedom of expression by members of the NBA community.
[01:11:22.397 --> 01:11:27.500]  And in this case, Daryl Morey, as the general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:40.993]  As one of our employees, what I also try to suggest is I understand that there are consequences from that exercise of, in essence, his freedom of speech.
[01:11:40.993 --> 01:11:45.258]  And we will have to live with those consequences.
[01:11:45.258 --> 01:11:48.761]  It's my hope that for our Chinese fans,
[01:11:49.622 --> 01:11:59.291]  And our partners in China, they will see those remarks in the context of now a three decade, if not longer, relationship.
[01:11:59.291 --> 01:12:08.779]  CCTV announced that because of my remarks supporting Daryl Morey's freedom of expression,
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:13.083]  Not the substance of his statement, but his freedom of expression.
[01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:20.108]  They were no longer going to air the Lakers-Nets preseason games that are scheduled for later this week.
[01:12:20.108 --> 01:12:24.011]  Again, it's not something we expected to happen.
[01:12:24.011 --> 01:12:27.294]  I think it's unfortunate.
[01:12:27.294 --> 01:12:37.182]  But if that's the consequences of us adhering to our values... So that's where America's got
[01:12:38.905 --> 01:12:43.146]  That was a groveling milquetoast statement after he completely groveled.
[01:12:43.146 --> 01:12:48.108]  And there was a backlash by Americans saying that isn't American values.
[01:12:48.108 --> 01:12:51.709]  Well, it's not the National Basketball League.
[01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:57.091]  It's the New World Order system.
[01:12:57.091 --> 01:13:02.892]  And so that's how we've gotten to this place is capitulation and groveling to the system.
[01:13:02.892 --> 01:13:04.233]  And it's only going to get worse
[01:13:05.649 --> 01:13:22.845]  Until we learn to say no again, and learn to be the leaders in the promotion of freedom, instead of the leaders of bowing and kissing ass to the college professors, and the leftist pundits, and the thought police, and the controlled corporate media, and all of the language police, and the chi-coms.
[01:13:22.845 --> 01:13:25.107]  Because all of this is pure authoritarianism.
[01:13:25.107 --> 01:13:26.669]  It didn't happen by accident.
[01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:27.830]  That's the plan.
[01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:29.612]  Let's go to this clip from South Park.
[01:13:31.391 --> 01:13:34.353]  And then we'll come back and break down more of this geopolitically and what this means.
[01:13:34.353 --> 01:13:41.837]  But here's the dad who's in the death camp in China.
[01:13:41.837 --> 01:13:43.818]  Clip 17.
[01:13:43.818 --> 01:13:46.540]  Drumroll, please.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:53.184]  It seems to me like your music is kind of... Hey, let's just stop.
[01:13:53.184 --> 01:13:53.724]  Let's just stop.
[01:13:53.724 --> 01:13:54.544]  It's okay.
[01:13:54.544 --> 01:13:55.065]  No big deal.
[01:13:55.973 --> 01:13:59.336]  You know, we have had a lot of computer problems and it's not a big deal.
[01:13:59.336 --> 01:14:01.017]  I'm happy with it.
[01:14:01.017 --> 01:14:05.460]  We'll try next hour after our guest leaves us to go to these clubs.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.501]  We'll do it then.
[01:14:06.501 --> 01:14:07.221]  It'll be nice.
[01:14:07.221 --> 01:14:08.022]  It'll be cool.
[01:14:08.022 --> 01:14:09.043]  I tried it the first show.
[01:14:09.043 --> 01:14:10.284]  I tried again now.
[01:14:10.284 --> 01:14:14.607]  We're going to do this in the third hour.
[01:14:14.607 --> 01:14:16.448]  These are the clubs we're going to play in the third hour.
[01:14:16.448 --> 01:14:17.989]  17, 18, and 19.
[01:14:17.989 --> 01:14:20.391]  Those are the clubs we're going to play.
[01:14:20.391 --> 01:14:20.711]  All right.
[01:14:22.449 --> 01:14:24.131]  We'll try our best here today.
[01:14:24.131 --> 01:14:33.339]  Continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, Joel Skousen, cowboy hat on here, Joel Skousen is coming up to give you the geopolitics of the huge wars they're trying to start in the Middle East.
[01:14:33.339 --> 01:14:35.201]  Here's Trump right about what he's doing.
[01:14:35.201 --> 01:14:41.086]  We'll give you the real facts, the history of it, how Obama started this whole thing and how the media is totally covering all of that up.
[01:14:42.067 --> 01:14:49.833]  And then we will also have Paul Watson on, and we have another investigative journalist, Lee Stranahan, coming on.
[01:14:49.833 --> 01:14:54.236]  And we have the latest on how they're going to have the so-called whistleblower testify in secret.
[01:14:54.236 --> 01:14:56.698]  So that's all coming up today.
[01:14:56.698 --> 01:15:03.843]  Please remember, the globalists are doing everything they can to take this broadcast off of the air.
[01:15:04.443 --> 01:15:12.866]  They're working to censor us everywhere, just like you've just seen with the Chi-Coms, trying to come in and fire everybody, or block games that don't, you know, totally submit to them.
[01:15:12.866 --> 01:15:16.007]  And once you give in to one demand, it's more, more, more, as I said.
[01:15:16.007 --> 01:15:23.290]  So that's why it's essential to get on Twitter and YouTube and everywhere else and say, oh, it was Alex Jones last year, now it's the NBA this year.
[01:15:23.290 --> 01:15:24.731]  And oh, well, it's a government.
[01:15:24.731 --> 01:15:25.671]  It's their right to do it.
[01:15:25.671 --> 01:15:27.312]  Oh, a communist government.
[01:15:27.312 --> 01:15:29.413]  Now dictating to us because we don't have any values.
[01:15:30.578 --> 01:15:35.261]  Please tell everybody about the local AM and FM stations that you're listening to, local TV stations you're watching.
[01:15:35.261 --> 01:15:36.823]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:15:36.823 --> 01:15:44.688]  You can find my broadcast, David Knight, Owen Schroer, Will Johnson, Tom Papert, all the other great shows, Billy Weaver, Caitlin Bennett.
[01:15:44.688 --> 01:15:47.811]  Band.video and Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:15:47.811 --> 01:15:51.974]  And that's how we reach more people so they get the big picture of what's going on.
[01:15:52.694 --> 01:16:01.186]  We woke up and suddenly learned, ladies and gentlemen, that the Chinese communists tell us what we can say and do.
[01:16:01.186 --> 01:16:04.710]  That's how you go over the edge of the Slippery Slope and fall into the abyss of the cliff.
[01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:12.045]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.

[01:16:24.875 --> 01:16:32.741]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[01:16:32.901 --> 01:16:34.701]  Not a security IPO or note.

[01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:08.330]  Hunters, anglers, campers and survivalists.

[01:17:28.994 --> 01:17:37.002]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:37.002 --> 01:17:40.926]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:40.926 --> 01:17:42.468]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:42.468 --> 01:17:45.411]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:50.616]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:50.956 --> 01:17:52.157]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:52.157 --> 01:17:55.101]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:55.101 --> 01:17:57.323]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:57.323 --> 01:18:01.768]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.
[01:18:01.768 --> 01:18:03.469]  That's DanPilla.com.
[01:18:03.469 --> 01:18:04.090]  DanPilla.com.
[01:18:07.389 --> 01:18:11.914]  The truth is, President Trump is the most investigated president in history.
[01:18:11.914 --> 01:18:15.878]  He is working for American interests steadfastly.
[01:18:15.878 --> 01:18:27.171]  He is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders, bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist Chinese control who now own Hollywood and the majority of our debt.
[01:18:27.691 --> 01:18:31.053]  We have been maneuvered towards collapse and bankruptcy.
[01:18:31.053 --> 01:18:36.096]  But at the 11th hour, 58th minute, the American people put a populist in power.
[01:18:36.096 --> 01:18:38.097]  And it's happening all over the world.
[01:18:38.097 --> 01:18:39.657]  So great things are happening.
[01:18:39.657 --> 01:18:41.659]  But the enemy is striking back.
[01:18:41.659 --> 01:18:44.720]  They're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.541]  It has bipartisan support.
[01:18:46.541 --> 01:18:49.883]  And I'm telling you, President Trump needs our prayers and info wars.
[01:18:50.123 --> 01:18:52.104]  Need your prayers and support.
[01:18:52.104 --> 01:18:54.686]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[01:18:54.686 --> 01:19:05.713]  But right now, it's easier than ever to financially support us while getting great products at the same time with Black Friday comes two months early with store-wide free shipping, double Patreon points, and ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[01:19:07.014 --> 01:19:11.416]  My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump just like you have.
[01:19:11.416 --> 01:19:18.838]  And my goodness, yesterday's press conference, when they came in on him with all their garbage, the foreign reporters, the U.S.
[01:19:18.838 --> 01:19:24.100]  reporters, these little political sellouts, these whores, he just tore them to bits.
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:26.362]  And it's one thing to hear it if you're a radio listener.
[01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:26.902]  It's powerful.
[01:19:26.902 --> 01:19:30.185]  But if you see it, it's all at Band.Video.
[01:19:30.185 --> 01:19:32.406]  We've got the full press conference.
[01:19:32.406 --> 01:19:35.069]  We've got my boil down of how epic it is.
[01:19:35.069 --> 01:19:36.270]  It's all at Band.Video.
[01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:41.274]  And you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[01:19:41.274 --> 01:19:42.274]  This was amazing.
[01:19:42.274 --> 01:19:44.796]  And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[01:19:44.796 --> 01:19:48.860]  So InfoWars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening.
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:53.644]  And we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at Band.Video.
[01:19:54.464 --> 01:20:00.608]  And I gotta tell you, we've done great video work, we've done great films, we've done so much, but websites are not our thing.
[01:20:00.608 --> 01:20:01.549]  Well, now they are!
[01:20:01.549 --> 01:20:03.410]  I'm so proud of Bandai Video, folks.
[01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:10.195]  Check it out, there's a lot of new features for Bandai Video.
[01:20:10.195 --> 01:20:12.837]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:27.802 --> 01:20:33.470]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:39.558]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:39.558 --> 01:20:41.140]  The globalists shut up China.
[01:20:42.090 --> 01:20:51.453]  To economically leverage out the rest of the world and become the model of internet censorship, the model of surveillance, and also a base they can run to and launder money.
[01:20:51.453 --> 01:20:53.254]  Here's a headline out of CNBC today.
[01:20:53.254 --> 01:21:00.497]  China's surveillance tech is spreading globally, raising concerns about Beijing's influence.
[01:21:00.497 --> 01:21:06.839]  They have no rules on human cloning, on killing Buddhists and Christians, putting people in concentration camps.
[01:21:10.623 --> 01:21:13.745]  But Antifa says China's the model.
[01:21:13.745 --> 01:21:22.950]  And the Washington Post just a month ago had the headline, Xi must destroy Trump to save America.
[01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:25.611]  Remember those headlines?
[01:21:25.611 --> 01:21:30.694]  And now you've got the NBA first bowing, then not bowing, China banning their games.
[01:21:30.694 --> 01:21:37.818]  I'm gonna go over some of these headlines.
[01:21:37.818 --> 01:21:38.759]  It all ties together.
[01:21:40.828 --> 01:22:03.881]  But I wanted to get Joel Scowls in a World Affairs Brief on with us, the editor of World Affairs Brief, because he's a smart historian, and he's a former Marine Corps naval aviator, and of course a popular guest on this show to get his take on the war situation and the situation in Syria, and the situation with the supposed whistleblowers
[01:22:05.171 --> 01:22:07.993]  Now they say they're going to testify in secret with their faces blacked out.
[01:22:07.993 --> 01:22:08.894]  Never before done.
[01:22:08.894 --> 01:22:13.237]  It's the Democrats who bring forward people to make fake accusations so they can't be challenged.
[01:22:13.237 --> 01:22:17.541]  But will it be Clapper or Brennan in a blacked out room?
[01:22:17.541 --> 01:22:19.082]  This is just all unprecedented.
[01:22:19.082 --> 01:22:20.323]  We'll talk to Joel Schaus in a moment.
[01:22:20.323 --> 01:22:23.765]  Please don't forget, today is the last day for Black Friday comes early.
[01:22:23.765 --> 01:22:25.407]  Mega sale we've had for the last two weeks.
[01:22:26.516 --> 01:22:28.817]  I got so busy this weekend that I didn't come up with the new sales.
[01:22:28.817 --> 01:22:30.438]  We do have some new sales tomorrow.
[01:22:30.438 --> 01:22:32.298]  This has been the biggest sale we've had since Christmas.
[01:22:32.298 --> 01:22:41.502]  Storewide free shipping, double patriot points for your next order, 50% off on all the amazing supplements and preparedness, water filters, air filters, and storable foods.
[01:22:41.502 --> 01:22:44.003]  But the air filters and water filters are things you use every day, folks.
[01:22:44.003 --> 01:22:46.444]  You don't want to drink the glyphosate and all the chemicals in the water.
[01:22:46.444 --> 01:22:49.525]  Pro-Pure and Alexa Pure are the very best gravity-fed filters out there.
[01:22:49.525 --> 01:22:51.226]  These are the best prices you're going to find.
[01:22:51.226 --> 01:22:54.207]  It supports the broadcast, but you should act now for your own family and take action.
[01:22:54.847 --> 01:22:58.951]  And all the supplements, again, a bunch of them have already sold out.
[01:22:58.951 --> 01:23:01.653]  So we're going to have to stop the sale today.
[01:23:01.653 --> 01:23:03.735]  So take advantage of the huge sale, support the broadcast.
[01:23:03.735 --> 01:23:13.824]  I want to thank everybody that has taken advantage of it, gotten a fluoride-free toothpaste, four to five o'clock of silver and iodine, Superbloom, people that have gotten the Great Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, the Vaso Beats is very popular.
[01:23:14.384 --> 01:23:18.306]  That helps reduce the nitrous oxide in your body that's so good for your heart and blood and everything else.
[01:23:18.306 --> 01:23:19.206]  Just amazing.
[01:23:19.206 --> 01:23:20.306]  It's beet concentrate.
[01:23:20.306 --> 01:23:21.807]  Very special.
[01:23:21.807 --> 01:23:23.288]  Brain Force Plus.
[01:23:23.288 --> 01:23:24.268]  Turbo Force.
[01:23:24.268 --> 01:23:25.028]  It's all there.
[01:23:25.028 --> 01:23:26.429]  50% off.
[01:23:26.429 --> 01:23:27.149]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:28.210]  Double Patriot points.
[01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:28.970]  It has to end today.
[01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:30.330]  So thank you for your support.
[01:23:30.330 --> 01:23:31.431]  Joel Skousen.
[01:23:31.431 --> 01:23:33.052]  We've got the whistleblower saga.
[01:23:33.052 --> 01:23:33.932]  The impeachment push.
[01:23:35.555 --> 01:23:40.061]  We've got the impeachment push and that whole saga with the whistleblowers.
[01:23:40.061 --> 01:23:43.947]  We've got the whole situation blowing up between Turkey and Syria.
[01:23:45.657 --> 01:23:49.679]  Well, let's talk about Syria since that's really on the hot burner right now.
[01:24:14.438 --> 01:24:28.748]  It's one of the most confusing situations I've run into in the past three or four months because all of the globalists, of course, are condemning Trump for pulling out of Syria, but it really isn't a pullout.
[01:24:28.748 --> 01:24:34.612]  It's two observation posts, less than 24 individuals.
[01:24:34.612 --> 01:24:39.656]  I mean, these are not combat troops, but their presence, of course, in the line of fire has
[01:24:41.252 --> 01:24:45.496]  The removal of their presence has given Turkey the green light.
[01:24:45.496 --> 01:24:46.397]  And the U.S.
[01:24:46.397 --> 01:24:51.503]  yesterday said there was no green light given, but there were clear indications there were a green light.
[01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:56.749]  Back in December, Trump told Erdogan, we're leaving Syria.
[01:24:56.749 --> 01:25:00.053]  When he was sending the first pullout, it's all yours.
[01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:01.154]  Handing it over to Syria.
[01:25:02.659 --> 01:25:17.046]  The big problem is that Syria, Turkey has already attacked the Kurds with airstrikes yesterday and have moved up border troops and armored vehicles ready for the big push and Trump has done nothing.
[01:25:17.046 --> 01:25:19.587]  Trump said that he was going to crush their economy.
[01:25:20.302 --> 01:25:22.624]  In his bragging tweet, you know, like I've done before.
[01:25:22.624 --> 01:25:23.984]  Well, he's never done it before.
[01:25:23.984 --> 01:25:32.130]  I really don't understand what this is coming to, but he's clearly not coming through with his threat to Turkey not to do anything.
[01:25:32.130 --> 01:25:38.273]  And he said, you know, in my infinite wisdom, you know, if they do something that I think is wrong, then I'm going to destroy their economy.
[01:25:38.273 --> 01:25:39.894]  It's just braggadocious.
[01:25:39.894 --> 01:25:40.915]  But he's not doing anything.
[01:25:40.915 --> 01:25:44.157]  And worse, Alex, Russia isn't doing anything.
[01:25:44.157 --> 01:25:48.500]  I mean, Turkey's playing both one foot in NATO and one foot in the Russian camp.
[01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:50.571]  And neither the U.S.
[01:25:50.571 --> 01:25:55.833]  or Russia are interfering, and both of them are running air patrols in the area.
[01:25:55.833 --> 01:26:01.234]  They're not stopping Turkish fighters from attacking the Kurds.
[01:26:01.234 --> 01:26:05.855]  And that's obviously regrettable, but Trump's trying to get us out of Afghanistan as well.
[01:26:05.855 --> 01:26:08.276]  He promised to bring the troops home.
[01:26:08.276 --> 01:26:11.016]  Turkey historically has been involved in that area.
[01:26:11.016 --> 01:26:12.817]  I don't like Erdogan as much as you do.
[01:26:15.103 --> 01:26:20.426]  When Obama started all this with Hillary, they sent in the proxy armies, they took it over.
[01:26:20.426 --> 01:26:23.087]  How are we supposed to sit there and stay in the middle of this mess?
[01:26:23.087 --> 01:26:25.668]  I mean, Turkey has said they're going to invade.
[01:26:25.668 --> 01:26:26.929]  They've said that for a year.
[01:26:26.929 --> 01:26:30.550]  Or they're going to push the millions of refugees into Europe.
[01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:32.251]  Europe has said, no, don't do that.
[01:26:32.251 --> 01:26:34.412]  Just keep them yourself, but give them no money.
[01:26:34.412 --> 01:26:36.173]  So what is Turkey supposed to do?
[01:26:38.396 --> 01:26:41.077]  Well, Turkey wants portions of Syria.
[01:26:41.077 --> 01:26:44.318]  They want the Kurds out because the Kurds are not terrorists.
[01:26:44.318 --> 01:26:53.062]  The Kurds are, in fact, trying to establish a Kurdish republic and trying to get liberty for their Kurdish people that are living in Turkey.
[01:26:53.062 --> 01:26:57.103]  And, you know, Turkey's a ruthless aggressor versus the Kurds.
[01:26:57.103 --> 01:27:00.504]  The Kurds have helped the United States fight ISIS.
[01:27:00.504 --> 01:27:02.745]  In fact, the Kurds did most of the fighting because the U.S.
[01:27:02.745 --> 01:27:04.806]  did nothing except save ISIS.
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:12.664]  In the Battle of Mosul and in the Battle of Raqqa, they're the ones who paid for the 50 semi-trucks to haul ISA.
[01:27:12.664 --> 01:27:20.407]  Well undoubtedly the Kurds have been caught between Iraq and Syria and Saudi Arabia forever and have been wanting their autonomy and I understand that.
[01:27:20.407 --> 01:27:22.509]  But why is it our place to stay there?
[01:27:22.509 --> 01:27:25.170]  I mean we've all wanted to stop being the policemen of the world.
[01:27:25.170 --> 01:27:27.351]  We've all wanted to right get the troops home.
[01:27:27.351 --> 01:27:30.112]  That was Trump's campaign promise.
[01:27:30.112 --> 01:27:31.313]  Yeah, but this isn't doing it.
[01:27:32.128 --> 01:27:37.870]  I mean, look at what happened in Afghanistan when he came very, very close to that deal with the Taliban.
[01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:44.371]  And I believe what happened when a faction of the Taliban carried out that attack, which sabotaged the talks.
[01:27:44.371 --> 01:27:49.132]  I don't believe that was done from Taliban headquarters because they don't control all the factions.
[01:27:49.132 --> 01:27:50.273]  I think... Well, no, let's do this.
[01:27:50.273 --> 01:27:51.153]  We're going to break.
[01:27:51.153 --> 01:27:51.813]  You're a smart guy.
[01:27:51.813 --> 01:27:52.693]  I respect you.
[01:27:52.693 --> 01:27:54.674]  You're right about 98% of the time.
[01:27:54.674 --> 01:27:57.275]  I'm right about 95% of the time on geopolitics.
[01:27:57.275 --> 01:27:58.195]  So when we come back,
[01:27:59.341 --> 01:28:05.882]  I want to get your big view on why is civil war breaking out in Iraq and martial law?
[01:28:05.882 --> 01:28:09.683]  Why is there proxy wars going on between India and Pakistan heating up?
[01:28:09.683 --> 01:28:13.303]  Most analysts say the most dangerous spot for nuclear war, flashpoint on the planet.
[01:28:13.303 --> 01:28:16.704]  Why is China moving against Hong Kong and Taiwan right now?
[01:28:16.704 --> 01:28:20.185]  Why is the UN trying to break down our borders and the EU's borders?
[01:28:20.185 --> 01:28:24.905]  Geopolitically, what are the factions, what are the reasons that we see the world going into crisis?
[01:28:24.905 --> 01:28:28.446]  We got 40 seconds to break, but just in summation, why is this happening?
[01:28:29.818 --> 01:28:33.705]  Well, it's impossible to answer all of those questions with one theory.
[01:28:33.705 --> 01:28:38.434]  I mean, there are many specific reasons for each of these regional battles.
[01:28:38.434 --> 01:28:39.235]  The U.S.
[01:28:39.235 --> 01:28:41.820]  is in the Middle East to create conflict.
[01:28:42.631 --> 01:28:44.672]  To justify taking down Iran.
[01:28:44.672 --> 01:28:46.193]  That's the target.
[01:28:46.193 --> 01:28:47.514]  The target is not Syria.
[01:28:47.514 --> 01:28:51.496]  It was only a temporary target because Israel said we're not going to attack Iran.
[01:28:51.496 --> 01:28:53.156]  You did answer the question though.
[01:28:53.156 --> 01:28:55.458]  What's happened in the Middle East is all about Iran.
[01:28:55.458 --> 01:28:59.740]  We'll come back and talk about that with Joel Skousen on the other side of WorldAffairsBrief.com.
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:02.201]  I'm Alex Jones with Banned.Video.
[01:29:02.201 --> 01:29:03.622]  Have you shared Banned.Video today?
[01:29:06.727 --> 01:29:11.791]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.
[01:29:11.791 --> 01:29:17.155]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the outleft sanctuary state until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[01:29:17.155 --> 01:29:25.201]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.
[01:29:25.201 --> 01:29:30.666]  If you're ready to flee the city to the freedom of Idaho or Montana, our Black Rifle Real Estate team is here to help.

[01:30:07.386 --> 01:30:13.129]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[01:30:13.129 --> 01:30:27.956]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're gonna have an authoritarian corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic immunity, that runs around saying it's communist and socialist, power to the people, but then meanwhile is tax-exempt again offshore?
[01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:29.077]  Well, Trump got that.
[01:30:29.637 --> 01:30:31.558]  And all these other populists get it.
[01:30:31.558 --> 01:30:40.583]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures just so you can say the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller put in power are better than everybody?
[01:30:40.583 --> 01:30:43.444]  That is a sick, freakish joke!
[01:30:43.444 --> 01:30:48.967]  And I will not stand by and watch humanity turned over to these people, and I beg God for the strength
[01:30:49.227 --> 01:30:53.849]  And the will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat!
[01:30:53.849 --> 01:30:58.952]  And I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years, and God is delivering because God is great!
[01:30:58.952 --> 01:31:01.313]  Thank God for His Son, Jesus Christ!
[01:31:01.313 --> 01:31:03.874]  And now let's move forward against the NWO!
[01:31:18.314 --> 01:31:22.616]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[01:31:22.616 --> 01:31:26.097]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[01:31:26.097 --> 01:31:29.379]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[01:31:29.379 --> 01:31:32.920]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.161]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[01:31:35.161 --> 01:31:36.562]  I suggest Band.Video.
[01:31:37.262 --> 01:31:42.707]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[01:31:42.707 --> 01:31:51.194]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[01:31:51.194 --> 01:31:53.596]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech.
[01:31:53.596 --> 01:31:57.900]  And click the share buttons below, on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.722]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[01:32:09.767 --> 01:32:13.890]  You have all the power in the world, but you must use it.
[01:32:13.890 --> 01:32:16.512]  You must take action.
[01:32:16.512 --> 01:32:19.614]  As of taping this, it's Wednesday afternoon.
[01:32:19.614 --> 01:32:23.416]  We're running the biggest sale we've had since last Christmas.
[01:32:23.416 --> 01:32:31.502]  It's store-wide free shipping, 50% off the high quality supplements from Forest Life, and all the preparedness items like water filtration, air filtration.
[01:32:32.542 --> 01:32:35.324]  Storeable foods, shortwave radios, and so much more.
[01:32:35.324 --> 01:32:36.485]  This is a huge special.
[01:32:36.485 --> 01:32:44.070]  We need to sell a lot of product to fund ourselves, and these sales are a great way for you to get great prices, but also support the M4.
[01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:45.111]  Please take action today.
[01:32:45.111 --> 01:32:52.016]  I've got to end this sale by Sunday or Monday at the max, because a bunch of the items are about to sell out.
[01:32:52.016 --> 01:32:54.398]  Again, too many deals to fit them all in here.
[01:32:54.398 --> 01:32:59.741]  Just please go to m4store.com and realize they're in this critical time, with the globalists trying to take us off the air.
[01:32:59.741 --> 01:33:01.763]  Your support is absolutely essential, so thank you.
[01:33:03.630 --> 01:33:04.731]  InfoWars.
[01:33:04.731 --> 01:33:05.911]  Tomorrow's news.
[01:33:05.911 --> 01:33:06.312]  Today.
[01:33:06.312 --> 01:33:12.855]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:34.276 --> 01:33:41.438]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.438 --> 01:33:53.621]  This is a big deal taking place over the Middle East between Syria and Turkey, bordering it to the Northwest, the gateway into Europe.
[01:33:53.621 --> 01:33:57.142]  Obama and the globalists invaded the country, destabilized it, took it down.
[01:33:57.142 --> 01:34:02.003]  Trump had the right policy to work with Russia to try to stabilize it, kick Al Qaeda and ISIS out.
[01:34:03.223 --> 01:34:07.646]  Now the Kurds who did work with the West to do that were a big part of it.
[01:34:07.646 --> 01:34:11.028]  There's been a constant conflict with Turkey.
[01:34:11.028 --> 01:34:13.590]  Are reportedly being betrayed.
[01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:17.412]  Because these few outposts, they said a couple hundred special operators.
[01:34:17.412 --> 01:34:21.715]  Skousen saying it was not even that many.
[01:34:21.715 --> 01:34:24.437]  Leaving green lights.
[01:34:24.437 --> 01:34:25.898]  Erdogan's invasion.
[01:34:25.898 --> 01:34:29.000]  Erdogan's been saying let me take this area over and repatriate.
[01:34:29.625 --> 01:34:31.887]  All these refugees are all sick among Europe.
[01:34:31.887 --> 01:34:36.570]  I mean, that's geopolitically what's been happening, if you just look at it from Turkey's perspective.
[01:34:36.570 --> 01:34:38.312]  Turkey reportedly is against Iran.
[01:34:38.312 --> 01:34:43.716]  We're allied with Saudi Arabia, but you've seen them in big fights as well.
[01:34:43.716 --> 01:34:48.479]  But we were talking about Iran and the Sunni-Shiite civil war going on.
[01:34:48.479 --> 01:34:50.781]  Iraq has descended into martial law.
[01:34:50.781 --> 01:34:51.662]  Reportedly, 6,000-7,000 dead.
[01:34:53.763 --> 01:34:54.424]  We're good to go.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:20.881]  Well, Turkey has long been lobbying for them to take control of a buffer zone in northern Syria, which are occupied by the Kurds.
[01:35:20.881 --> 01:35:26.282]  In other words, let us do this buffer zone will be a no military zone, but we'll control it.
[01:35:26.282 --> 01:35:27.443]  And we're going to build
[01:35:41.215 --> 01:35:44.139]  Three billion dollars worth of housing to house these refugees.
[01:35:44.139 --> 01:35:51.668]  What Turkey is in essence saying is, if we're going to build these houses and take control of it, we're going to own this area after this war is over.
[01:35:51.668 --> 01:36:00.679]  That's what Turkey wants to do is to expel the Turks and control this area of northern Syria, which is a violation of Syrian sovereignty.
[01:36:01.693 --> 01:36:03.334]  And you know, the U.S.
[01:36:03.334 --> 01:36:06.957]  is essentially giving them the green light and go too far.
[01:36:06.957 --> 01:36:09.419]  You know, heaven knows what that means.
[01:36:09.419 --> 01:36:12.241]  But they're bombing the Kurds right now as we speak.
[01:36:12.241 --> 01:36:13.603]  And it has gone too far.
[01:36:13.603 --> 01:36:16.365]  Trump has done nothing and Russia has done nothing.
[01:36:16.365 --> 01:36:17.826]  But here's what I think is happening.
[01:36:18.599 --> 01:36:26.507]  I think the reason all the globalists are upset about this, 24 troops leaving, you know, and all that that means, I mean, that's not a withdrawal.
[01:36:26.507 --> 01:36:35.575]  In fact, I want to tell you that there are several much more larger bases with combat troops south of that area in Syria that aren't leaving.
[01:36:35.575 --> 01:36:40.720]  And so Trump has been given some false intelligence that you're going to be leaving Syria if you take out these two outposts.
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:41.401]  It's just not true.
[01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:43.611]  And so I think he's been snookered.
[01:36:43.611 --> 01:36:55.680]  But I think the larger agenda is to have a major war start with Turkey and the Kurds that will then justify pushing Trump into letting armed forces come back into Syria.
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:05.888]  In other words, it's a backdoor to get more troops into Syria by letting a massacre occur between Turkey and the Kurds.
[01:37:05.888 --> 01:37:08.170]  Turkey's one of the largest conventional militaries.
[01:37:13.268 --> 01:37:15.269]  Can you speak to that, Joel?
[01:37:15.269 --> 01:37:15.809]  Oh, yes.
[01:37:15.809 --> 01:37:16.850]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:31.858]  Now, they're not top-of-the-line fighters by any means, but they've got equipment, they've poured all of their money into armored divisions, and I think that they're going to be a tough row to hoe for the Syrians.
[01:37:31.858 --> 01:37:35.379]  I think the Syrians are going to go to battle with the Turks.
[01:37:35.379 --> 01:37:39.722]  At some point, the Russians are going to get involved there.
[01:37:39.722 --> 01:37:42.183]  I just don't understand why somebody isn't
[01:37:42.842 --> 01:37:46.304]  Threatening Turkey right now to stay out of Syria.
[01:37:46.304 --> 01:38:03.691]  And the only reason that they're not doing that, because the deep state controls the military in the U.S., they're not doing that is because I think they want a bigger war to justify the entire thing going up in flames and to justify more troops coming back into Syria in retrospect.
[01:38:03.691 --> 01:38:05.812]  Ultimately, it points at Iran.
[01:38:06.636 --> 01:38:15.699]  Every one of these neocons, whether it's Lindsey Graham or Dick Cheney and others keep talking about, and Marco Rubio, Iran is the real target here.
[01:38:15.699 --> 01:38:16.919]  Iran controls Syria.
[01:38:16.919 --> 01:38:24.441]  Well, Iran has been in Syria supporting Assad now for over 30 years, so this isn't anything new about Iran being in Syria.
[01:38:24.441 --> 01:38:32.984]  But the reason Iran is in Syria is it's the only military force, independent military force, in the Middle East that is fighting U.S.-backed terrorism.
[01:38:32.984 --> 01:38:33.424]  This whole
[01:38:35.218 --> 01:38:36.439]  And let's be clear.
[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:02.860]  I agree with you.
[01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:28.067]  Obama started this, the globalists sent in Al-Qaeda, Islamic State changed the name to ISIS, and now Trump has the right instinct trying to get out, but the way this is being done and the way Turkey's coming in is going to be used as the excuse now to try to make Trump look like an idiot and have a pretext for a real re-occupation of parts of the country by the United States.
[01:39:29.554 --> 01:39:31.815]  Now, remember that Obama didn't start this.
[01:39:31.815 --> 01:39:34.557]  Obama merely signed the nuclear agreement with Iran.
[01:39:34.557 --> 01:39:37.698]  But remember, that was a globalist trap.
[01:39:37.698 --> 01:39:41.901]  They had to... Sure, I'm talking about the takedown of Libya and the invasion of Syria.
[01:39:41.901 --> 01:39:46.123]  I'm not talking about the ongoing build-up to proxy war and war with Iran.
[01:39:47.142 --> 01:39:48.603]  But that's a globalist thing.
[01:39:48.603 --> 01:39:49.804]  That isn't Iran.
[01:39:49.804 --> 01:39:51.345]  Obama's just a puppet.
[01:39:51.345 --> 01:39:52.306]  Obama didn't... No, I know.
[01:39:52.306 --> 01:39:56.069]  I'm just talking about the left and the globalists did all this.
[01:39:56.069 --> 01:39:58.530]  Now they're trying to blame the mess on Trump.
[01:39:58.530 --> 01:40:02.433]  I mean, I agree what Turkey's doing is not a good thing.
[01:40:02.433 --> 01:40:04.695]  I'm just saying this is going to be blamed on Trump and you're agreeing with that.
[01:40:04.695 --> 01:40:05.635]  I mean, it's already happened.
[01:40:05.635 --> 01:40:06.616]  Yes.
[01:40:06.616 --> 01:40:07.557]  Absolutely.
[01:40:07.557 --> 01:40:12.460]  In other words, I think they're making a big deal out of it because, I mean, what Trump is doing is nothing.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:12.701]  What?
[01:40:12.701 --> 01:40:13.381]  Taking out 24 troops?
[01:40:14.822 --> 01:40:16.864]  Less than 24 out of 2 observations.
[01:40:16.864 --> 01:40:18.945]  There aren't even combat troops.
[01:40:18.945 --> 01:40:22.688]  The only thing that does is prove that there's a green light to Turkey.
[01:40:22.688 --> 01:40:24.029]  That it's okay now to attack.
[01:40:24.881 --> 01:40:29.985]  And so I'm very, very disappointed with Trump that he isn't making good on his promise to stop them.
[01:40:29.985 --> 01:40:36.790]  And notice he didn't stop threatening any military force against Turkey, he just threatened economic force, which would take months to do.
[01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:39.272]  We're talking about sanctions against Turkey.
[01:40:39.272 --> 01:40:42.495]  We'll talk about that more in a moment, but this is bombshell and you're absolutely right.
[01:40:42.495 --> 01:40:43.015]  There's U.S.
[01:40:43.015 --> 01:40:43.936]  troops still in Syria.
[01:40:45.837 --> 01:40:52.601]  Well, as I say, I think the globalists want a larger war in Syria to justify either an attack on Iran, having Iran coming to the defense of Syria.
[01:40:52.601 --> 01:40:54.862]  There's going to be a larger confrontation between Syria and Turkey.
[01:41:12.222 --> 01:41:20.227]  They set Trump up basically to say that he started this by withdrawing a puny, you know, couple of dozen troops.
[01:41:20.227 --> 01:41:25.189]  And in fact, somebody gave the green light to Erdogan, whether or not they planted that in Trump's ear.
[01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:26.990]  And, you know, he's subject to flattery.
[01:41:26.990 --> 01:41:28.391]  He likes to flatter other leaders.
[01:41:28.391 --> 01:41:34.314]  He keeps having good conversations with Erdogan, who is a ruthless dictator.
[01:41:34.314 --> 01:41:35.675]  And I think he shouldn't do that.
[01:41:35.675 --> 01:41:38.537]  But I think that without intent,
[01:41:39.272 --> 01:41:43.135]  Trump gave an unknowing green light to Erdogan, certainly going forward.
[01:41:43.135 --> 01:41:50.719]  But I think it's going to lead to a larger war in Iran, I mean with Iran, in Syria, and somehow Russia's going to have to get involved too.
[01:41:50.719 --> 01:42:04.048]  So Trump's instincts are right to try to get out of these wars, but these neocon advisors aren't telling him, sir, you just greenlit Erdogan, and so now they're trying to hang this around Trump's neck like the Bay of Pigs.
[01:42:04.048 --> 01:42:05.269]  Absolutely, and in fact,
[01:42:06.098 --> 01:42:12.484]  The proof that he hasn't been told the truth is that he thinks he's getting out of Syria by taking out 24 troops.
[01:42:12.484 --> 01:42:19.490]  He's not taking out the hundreds of other troops and Blackwater mercenaries that are deeply in these other bases in Syria.
[01:42:19.490 --> 01:42:21.933]  So he's being lied to by his intelligence.
[01:42:24.053 --> 01:42:27.134]  Let me ask you this question when we come back with Joel Skousen.
[01:42:27.134 --> 01:42:33.295]  What does President Trump do to get out of this mess, this bear trap that he's obviously stepped into?
[01:42:33.295 --> 01:42:35.255]  And again, Trump's not God.
[01:42:35.255 --> 01:42:36.375]  He makes mistakes, folks.
[01:42:36.375 --> 01:42:40.676]  And I agree with Joel Skousen that the way this has all been maneuvered, he's being set up.
[01:42:40.676 --> 01:42:45.637]  We know that people like Pat Robertson basically does what he's told to say.
[01:42:45.637 --> 01:42:49.758]  In my view, I don't think he's a bad person, but I mean, he's up there saying Trump's about to lose the
[01:42:50.458 --> 01:42:52.961]  You know, blessings of heaven or whatever.
[01:42:52.961 --> 01:42:55.784]  Chinese communist quotes, basically.
[01:42:55.784 --> 01:42:57.205]  The edict of heaven.
[01:42:57.205 --> 01:42:59.968]  That's all coming up as well in those clips with Joel Skousen.
[01:42:59.968 --> 01:43:00.989]  We know Trump's in a trap.
[01:43:00.989 --> 01:43:02.190]  We know America's in a trap.
[01:43:02.190 --> 01:43:03.292]  How do we get out of the trap?
[01:43:03.292 --> 01:43:03.892]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:03.892 --> 01:43:04.273]  Stay with us.
[01:43:07.543 --> 01:43:10.004]  The gauntlet has been thrown down.
[01:43:10.004 --> 01:43:16.225]  Every major Democrat candidate has come out and said they want to confiscate all semi-auto firearms.
[01:43:16.225 --> 01:43:21.346]  And now Buttigieg has come out and said that it's about political power.
[01:43:21.346 --> 01:43:22.786]  That's why they want the guns.
[01:43:22.786 --> 01:43:25.007]  Well, finally they're being honest.
[01:43:25.007 --> 01:43:28.567]  Because all their lies haven't gotten to the point they want.
[01:43:28.567 --> 01:43:30.908]  So now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny.
[01:43:31.588 --> 01:43:34.110]  It shows what incredible followers these people are.
[01:43:34.110 --> 01:43:37.513]  The globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war.
[01:43:37.513 --> 01:43:43.378]  And they know that the minions trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position in that civil war.
[01:43:43.378 --> 01:43:45.620]  But it's up to us to understand the big picture.
[01:43:45.620 --> 01:43:48.303]  To carry the fight to the enemy in the information war.
[01:43:48.643 --> 01:43:50.985]  Before they can kick off a hot civil war.
[01:43:50.985 --> 01:43:53.388]  That's our mission, if you choose to accept it.
[01:43:53.388 --> 01:44:01.797]  So please, spread the word about InfoWars.com, port slash show, band dot video, and all the powerful transmissions and reports, and take advantage of store-wide free shipping.

[01:44:06.081 --> 01:44:13.405]  The globalists and their democrat minions are on the verge of taking this cold civil war hot.
[01:44:13.405 --> 01:44:25.172]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship and sabotage of the economy and attacks run by the UN on the border that are nothing short of war.
[01:44:25.692 --> 01:44:36.183]  And that's because it is a war by multinational corporations, allied with the shycoms and others, with the Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating filth to try to capture the United States.
[01:44:36.183 --> 01:44:39.027]  This is 21st century war.
[01:44:39.027 --> 01:44:41.850]  And wars need money to be prosecuted.
[01:44:41.850 --> 01:44:43.031]  And we're actually winning the war.
[01:44:43.251 --> 01:44:45.613]  But the enemy's throwing their full weight at us right now.
[01:44:45.613 --> 01:44:47.074]  That's why we need financial support.
[01:44:47.074 --> 01:44:48.716]  It's a total 360 win.
[01:44:48.716 --> 01:44:49.657]  Double Patriot points.
[01:44:49.657 --> 01:44:50.017]  50% off.

[01:44:51.698 --> 01:44:52.479]  It's about to end.
[01:44:52.479 --> 01:44:55.141]  We're running out of a lot of these products at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:44:55.141 --> 01:45:01.647]  But I need you to get in there, step to the plate, get high quality products you already need, and fund the information war.
[01:45:01.647 --> 01:45:02.488]  InfoWareStore.com!
[01:45:07.287 --> 01:45:10.069]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish.
[01:45:10.069 --> 01:45:12.011]  They think the West is dead.
[01:45:12.011 --> 01:45:15.574]  They think if they censor nationalists and patriots off the internet, you'll just forget about us.
[01:45:15.574 --> 01:45:17.415]  And then they'll be the only information out there.
[01:45:17.415 --> 01:45:19.957]  Well, so far, that's not been working too well for them.
[01:45:19.957 --> 01:45:26.823]  Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly that the resistance to globalism is alive and well at Banned.Video.
[01:45:26.823 --> 01:45:27.944]  And now we've added a lot of
[01:45:27.964 --> 01:45:28.344]  I think so.
[01:45:51.425 --> 01:46:02.455]  The power of America, the power of freedom, the power to build a better world and stand in the face of the censors and the tyrants is alive and stronger than ever at Banned.Video.
[01:46:02.455 --> 01:46:05.618]  But it's up to you to unleash its full potential.
[01:46:05.618 --> 01:46:06.338]  Banned.Video.
[01:46:18.416 --> 01:46:22.718]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[01:46:22.718 --> 01:46:26.199]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[01:46:26.199 --> 01:46:29.481]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[01:46:29.481 --> 01:46:33.022]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[01:46:33.022 --> 01:46:35.283]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[01:46:35.283 --> 01:46:36.684]  I suggest Band.Video.
[01:46:37.364 --> 01:46:42.807]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[01:46:42.807 --> 01:46:51.292]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[01:46:51.292 --> 01:46:53.694]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech.
[01:46:53.694 --> 01:46:59.157]  And click the share buttons below, on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.

[01:47:09.733 --> 01:47:23.619]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:23.619 --> 01:47:29.942]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:37.489 --> 01:47:45.254]  So, we've had all the big neocons and republicans come out and freak out on the president about the Turkey situation.
[01:47:45.254 --> 01:47:51.538]  But none of them pointed out that the deep state, the globalists under Obama and Hillary engineered all this.
[01:47:51.538 --> 01:47:58.662]  Or that Turkey has one of the biggest conventional militaries in the world and has been saying they're gonna dump these millions of refugees on Europe or kick them into Syria.
[01:48:00.188 --> 01:48:03.009]  And so Trump signals, well, okay.
[01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:09.193]  And then Turkey turns into a giant invasion, knowing it'll be embarrassing for Trump when they do 50 times more than they were planning.
[01:48:09.193 --> 01:48:13.655]  So Trump now, hey, warns you better back off, you better, you know, not double cross me.
[01:48:14.833 --> 01:48:19.094]  It's a mess, ladies and gentlemen, that Trump didn't create it, but the media is making it about him.
[01:48:19.094 --> 01:48:20.354]  Joel Skousen's a smart guy.
[01:48:20.354 --> 01:48:21.555]  I respect his views on this.
[01:48:21.555 --> 01:48:23.875]  WorldAffairsBrief.com editor.
[01:48:23.875 --> 01:48:26.336]  What would you do if you were the president right now?
[01:48:26.336 --> 01:48:28.016]  And what do you expect the deep state to do?
[01:48:28.016 --> 01:48:32.117]  Because I agree, they're licking their lips about this as a way to try to embarrass Trump.
[01:48:32.117 --> 01:48:38.739]  Even if this thing turns into a giant disaster or fiasco, isn't it the deep state that basically helped engineer this to begin with?
[01:48:38.739 --> 01:48:40.539]  So they certainly shouldn't be on a high horse.
[01:48:42.281 --> 01:48:43.122]  Well, that's right.
[01:48:43.122 --> 01:48:54.211]  And as long as the Deep State continues to control terrorism and ISIS, Lindsey Graham's prophecy about terrorists or ISIS coming back that, I mean, he's absolutely right.
[01:48:54.211 --> 01:48:56.774]  ISIS was not defeated.
[01:48:56.774 --> 01:49:01.558]  And the reason is, which Lindsey Graham may or may not know because he's part of the Deep State,
[01:49:02.242 --> 01:49:12.629]  The reason ISIS was not defeated is it's created by the Deep State and it simply blends back and forth into the Syrian rebels and then back into ISIS as needed.
[01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:17.853]  Well, as you've said every time, they're at bases being protected by the West right now.
[01:49:17.853 --> 01:49:18.253]  That's right.
[01:49:19.171 --> 01:49:25.173]  And, you know, they've been saved every time they've been in battle, at least their leaders and most of their heavy weapons have been saved.
[01:49:25.173 --> 01:49:37.138]  Now, there's a lot of ISIS people from Europe that are in these refugee camps or these prison camps that are controlled by the Kurds right now, which are going to be abandoned and given over to Turkey when Turkey drives the Kurds out.
[01:49:37.138 --> 01:49:41.740]  And Turkey's using that as leverage to get the EU to try to give him money to build
[01:49:42.398 --> 01:49:45.501]  How is it he knows that Europe doesn't want these people back.
[01:49:45.501 --> 01:49:53.407]  So he wants to build housing there in this so-called demilitarized zone, which then he will control and it will become part of Turkey.
[01:49:53.407 --> 01:49:55.008]  That's his whole plan there.
[01:49:55.008 --> 01:49:58.611]  And the only way that Trump can win this battle is to somehow
[01:49:59.369 --> 01:50:06.732]  Get an advisor, get some information so that he understands what the deep state doing, what the false intelligence is that's coming.
[01:50:06.732 --> 01:50:13.354]  It's like Chuck Todd on Meet the Press excoriated a GOP senator and he cried out, don't you trust the FBI?
[01:50:13.354 --> 01:50:14.995]  Don't you trust the CIA?
[01:50:14.995 --> 01:50:19.696]  How dare you as an American congressman not trust our intelligence agencies?
[01:50:19.696 --> 01:50:25.198]  Well, the GOP's senator, of course, had to parrot that he does trust them, but I don't trust them at all.
[01:50:25.198 --> 01:50:27.599]  They're deep state and they lie to Trump continually.
[01:50:28.414 --> 01:50:31.401]  Iran is not the biggest launch of terror in the world.
[01:50:31.401 --> 01:50:32.043]  The U.S.
[01:50:32.043 --> 01:50:34.348]  is, along with Israel and Saudi Arabia.
[01:50:35.828 --> 01:50:49.297]  That's the only thing he's got to do is start understanding and get the information, get somebody who's got his ear and to tell him what the Deep State is doing that is wrong and buck up against it.
[01:50:49.297 --> 01:50:56.281]  Now, you're not going to just simply solve this by pulling American troops out of Syria because they're going to do another false flag.
[01:50:56.281 --> 01:51:02.165]  They're going to do this Turkey invasion of the Kurds and it's going to blow up into another larger war.
[01:51:02.165 --> 01:51:03.946]  Eventually they want war with Iran.
[01:51:04.972 --> 01:51:10.915]  They've continued and failed three times now to induce a war with Iran in the past three months.
[01:51:10.915 --> 01:51:14.377]  Iran is too smart to take the bait right now, but eventually it's going to happen.
[01:51:15.191 --> 01:51:19.976]  And, you know, it's going to be a large one and it's probably going to involve killing American troops.
[01:51:19.976 --> 01:51:26.482]  That's the only thing that's going to goad Americans into agreeing to attack Iran or get Trump to agree to attack Iran.
[01:51:26.482 --> 01:51:33.808]  I totally agree with you, Joel Skousen, but isn't Trump's instinct and like his speech saying time to bring him home, time to come back, trying to follow his promise.
[01:51:33.808 --> 01:51:38.833]  I mean, isn't that really a very positive sign that Trump is at least trying to not be the world's policeman?
[01:51:39.741 --> 01:51:49.143]  Yeah, but it's not going to do any good because he's not going to be able to resist the next false flag in Afghanistan that justifies keeping the troops there.
[01:51:49.143 --> 01:51:58.085]  No, I understand that geopolitically and the climate, it's still not going to be enough because we have evil people willing to destabilize the world because then that gives them power.
[01:51:58.085 --> 01:52:04.327]  And that's the secret of evil is it just has to break things to be in charge instead of trying to fix things, which is much, much harder.
[01:52:05.307 --> 01:52:06.288]  We need to support the President.
[01:52:06.288 --> 01:52:07.409]  We need to contact the President.
[01:52:07.409 --> 01:52:09.911]  Everybody needs to let the President know that he's being set up.
[01:52:09.911 --> 01:52:14.114]  I think he should come out and talk about who destabilized Syria, who brought the country down.
[01:52:14.114 --> 01:52:17.536]  He should expose the deep state like he's done the intelligence agencies.
[01:52:17.536 --> 01:52:21.459]  And I think he should speak out about how they created the climate for this.
[01:52:21.459 --> 01:52:25.402]  And I think that might scare them back into their holes.
[01:52:25.402 --> 01:52:27.324]  No, he has not exposed the deep state.
[01:52:27.324 --> 01:52:30.346]  He keeps naming deep state people to high position.
[01:52:31.098 --> 01:52:32.519]  He has not exposed the Deep State.
[01:52:32.519 --> 01:52:33.600]  He's talked about it.
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:38.905]  He thinks of it in general terms, but he can't... Sure, I'm saying compared to anybody else, but you're right.
[01:52:38.905 --> 01:52:41.547]  He keeps, though, calling up Deep State people.
[01:52:41.547 --> 01:52:45.651]  They lie to him and say they're loyal, and then they stab him in the back.
[01:52:45.651 --> 01:52:46.091]  That's right.
[01:52:46.091 --> 01:52:49.534]  And he's talking about lie detector tests for everybody in the staff.
[01:52:49.534 --> 01:52:54.598]  They've got hundreds of people in there that are leaking to the press about Donald Trump.
[01:52:54.598 --> 01:52:56.460]  I mean, this is never going to end.
[01:52:56.460 --> 01:52:58.722]  You know, going to switching to the impeachment topic,
[01:52:59.441 --> 01:53:13.485]  I am suspicious, because this is such a flimsy pretext for impeachment, that if they keep pushing this, it means they do have an agenda to get rid of the President, and it's got to involve mainstream Republicans.
[01:53:13.485 --> 01:53:15.205]  In other words... Oh, I totally agree.
[01:53:15.205 --> 01:53:16.265]  They're making their move.
[01:53:16.265 --> 01:53:18.006]  They've been changing impeachment rules.
[01:53:18.006 --> 01:53:18.946]  They're really serious.
[01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:21.851]  Yeah, it looks like they are.
[01:53:21.851 --> 01:53:29.758]  It looks like they're setting up Mitt Romney to take Trump's place if they can impeach him and get him out so that he can't run for president.
[01:53:29.758 --> 01:53:32.080]  Now, if Trump's smart, he'll run again.
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:36.043]  You know, even if you've been impeached, you can run again in the next election.
[01:53:36.043 --> 01:53:39.686]  And he could actually win if he didn't drop out like Ross Perot.
[01:53:39.686 --> 01:53:39.887]  Yeah.
[01:53:40.706 --> 01:53:48.352]  But Ross Perot was kind of bought and sold by the other side to pave the way for Bill Clinton to come into office.
[01:53:48.352 --> 01:53:52.055]  He didn't maybe realize it, but that's what he did to split the vote.
[01:53:52.055 --> 01:53:54.197]  But if Romney votes
[01:53:54.963 --> 01:53:56.264]  For impeachment.
[01:53:56.264 --> 01:53:58.144]  Now, it takes two thirds of the Senate.
[01:53:58.144 --> 01:54:01.946]  That means they've got to have, you know, a dozen Republicans go along.
[01:54:01.946 --> 01:54:19.392]  But if they're going to run Romney in his place, and I think Romney wants to run for president again, I think they're going to have to have him vote against impeachment so that he's clear with Romney, with Trump supporters, and then have other rhino Republicans vote for impeachment and get the president out.
[01:54:19.392 --> 01:54:20.753]  Now, I'm not sure it's going to work.
[01:54:21.354 --> 01:54:22.835]  But Jeff Flake was very clear.
[01:54:22.835 --> 01:54:29.460]  There's about 35 senators that secretly want Trump out of the way and would vote for impeachment if it didn't embarrass them.
[01:54:29.460 --> 01:54:31.682]  Well, it's going to embarrass them if they do it openly.
[01:54:31.682 --> 01:54:34.704]  And that's the big problem that the Republicans have.
[01:54:34.704 --> 01:54:41.449]  And now they're talking about whistleblowers testifying via CCTV camera with their faces blacked out.
[01:54:41.449 --> 01:54:44.031]  That's never been done where you can't even face your accuser.
[01:54:44.031 --> 01:54:45.412]  They can just make up whatever they want.
[01:54:45.412 --> 01:54:48.554]  I mean, this is all getting very, very Costa-esque.
[01:54:50.066 --> 01:55:01.551]  Yes it is, and it's creating the political divide even stronger in the United States against those that see that these controlled freaks, these socialists and things, are adamant for power.
[01:55:01.551 --> 01:55:08.374]  And, you know, Trump is the only one standing against them, incompetent as he is to actually fight the battle.
[01:55:08.374 --> 01:55:13.596]  He is verbalizing what everybody wants, and that's why his speeches are so tremendous.
[01:55:13.596 --> 01:55:18.318]  I wish to God that he had the intelligence and the experience to be able to follow through
[01:55:19.161 --> 01:55:28.125]  With what his speechwriters are writing for him, but I'm fearful that this isn't going to end well, Alex.
[01:55:28.125 --> 01:55:29.166]  I have that feeling, too.
[01:55:29.166 --> 01:55:31.327]  I have a real feeling of dread.
[01:55:31.327 --> 01:55:32.928]  The crews noticed it, you know, with me.
[01:55:32.928 --> 01:55:34.749]  I mean, it's just, it's...
[01:55:36.004 --> 01:55:42.231]  This is just incredible, and the Chi-Coms exercising their will over us now, that all being out in the open, and Big Tech groveling.
[01:55:42.231 --> 01:55:43.873]  It's disgusting.
[01:55:43.873 --> 01:55:45.756]  At least we're on air, at least a lot of people are awake.
[01:55:45.756 --> 01:55:47.918]  These speeches he's giving are dynamite.
[01:55:47.918 --> 01:55:50.541]  I mean, it's absolutely like sunlight to vampires.
[01:55:50.541 --> 01:55:53.565]  So, think how bad it'd be if Hillary was in, though.
[01:55:53.565 --> 01:55:54.846]  Wow!
[01:55:54.846 --> 01:55:56.008]  Well, Hillary's gonna run again.
[01:55:57.169 --> 01:56:01.836]  She's setting herself up and all of the other candidates are shooting themselves in the foot.
[01:56:01.836 --> 01:56:03.178]  Joe Biden is dead.
[01:56:03.178 --> 01:56:05.381]  There's no way he can go up against Trump.
[01:56:05.381 --> 01:56:06.583]  Bernie's still in the hospital.
[01:56:07.611 --> 01:56:09.212]  That's right.
[01:56:09.212 --> 01:56:11.033]  Stay there and do five more minutes with us.
[01:56:11.033 --> 01:56:16.737]  I want to get your look into the campaign and then we're going to play those South Park clips that have been banned in China.
[01:56:16.737 --> 01:56:20.640]  And then we've got another really important investigative journalist, Lee Stranahan, joining us today.
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:22.741]  I want to thank the listeners and viewers making the show possible.
[01:56:22.741 --> 01:56:24.242]  I want to thank the great crew in there.
[01:56:24.242 --> 01:56:27.885]  I want to thank our great affiliates across the nation.
[01:56:27.885 --> 01:56:29.446]  But yeah, this is a very, very serious time.
[01:56:29.446 --> 01:56:34.949]  I mean, I've never been under so much stress just trying to just really get to the bottom of all this.
[01:56:34.949 --> 01:56:36.730]  And every indicator I get is
[01:56:38.312 --> 01:56:41.836]  Get yourselves ready, folks, because the globalists take Trump out.
[01:56:41.836 --> 01:56:43.358]  They're coming after everybody.
[01:56:43.358 --> 01:56:49.525]  A real reign of terror, a real reign of evil is about to take place, and just God bless Trump.
[01:56:49.525 --> 01:56:53.529]  You know, he means well, but he's totally surrounded, and he's for real, though.
[01:56:53.529 --> 01:56:56.753]  I mean, you see that by their response to the actions, and this is just biblical.
[01:56:56.753 --> 01:56:58.175]  That's all I can say is this is biblical.
[01:56:59.055 --> 01:57:03.136]  And as they say, you know, the spider sense is just off the charts right now.
[01:57:03.136 --> 01:57:04.617]  To quote Spider-Man.
[01:57:04.617 --> 01:57:05.357]  We're gonna go on a break.
[01:57:05.357 --> 01:57:06.998]  Please don't forget, again, it's the last day.
[01:57:06.998 --> 01:57:07.758]  It is the last day.
[01:57:07.758 --> 01:57:10.299]  I've been so busy, I haven't come up with new specials.
[01:57:10.299 --> 01:57:12.199]  This has been the biggest special since Christmas.
[01:57:12.199 --> 01:57:13.140]  Storewide free shipping.
[01:57:13.140 --> 01:57:16.181]  50% off all the high quality supplements and products.
[01:57:16.181 --> 01:57:17.901]  That means protein bars.
[01:57:17.901 --> 01:57:19.241]  That means just everything.
[01:57:19.241 --> 01:57:19.682]  50% off.
[01:57:21.974 --> 01:57:23.735]  On hundreds of items.
[01:57:23.735 --> 01:57:27.737]  And then we've also got that on the storable foods, the high-quality water filters, air filtration.
[01:57:27.737 --> 01:57:28.857]  It's all 50% off.
[01:57:28.857 --> 01:57:30.078]  A lot of those are at cost.
[01:57:30.078 --> 01:57:37.101]  We sold out of all the big tubes of the high-quality skin cream that has the silver salt and the hyaluronic acid, because that was at cost.
[01:57:37.101 --> 01:57:38.361]  That was a mistake.
[01:57:38.361 --> 01:57:39.922]  And so we had the little tubes left.
[01:57:39.922 --> 01:57:43.884]  Tomorrow, they go to 25% off or whatever, because they're about to sell out.
[01:57:43.884 --> 01:57:45.424]  So take advantage of the sales.
[01:57:45.424 --> 01:57:46.685]  Really great products.
[01:57:46.685 --> 01:57:47.745]  And it funds our operation.
[01:57:47.745 --> 01:57:49.026]  InfoMoreStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:57:51.627 --> 01:57:54.152]  Joel Skousen, World First Briefing, is our guest today.
[01:57:56.192 --> 01:57:58.034]  Do you feel that my style is wrong?
[01:57:58.034 --> 01:57:59.335]  Or my substance is wrong?
[01:57:59.335 --> 01:58:00.656]  Trying to fact check the president.
[01:58:00.656 --> 01:58:12.766]  The deceptive, humpty-dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter and his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and to censor us.
[01:58:12.766 --> 01:58:16.669]  And of course he famously said, along with many others, that Trump is the InfoWars president.
[01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:24.115]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[01:58:24.335 --> 01:58:24.876]  And you know what?
[01:58:24.876 --> 01:58:25.816]  It's true.
[01:58:25.816 --> 01:58:34.124]  Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew, and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists of power around the world.
[01:58:34.124 --> 01:58:40.070]  And now Trump's openly coming out and declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:44.314]  So this is a day of great victory, and I salute you all, but now in the thick of the fight,
[01:58:44.814 --> 01:58:47.718]  So, Infowarsstore.com for products you need.
[01:58:47.718 --> 01:58:57.451]  Massive sales now, so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end, until we've defeated them.
[01:58:57.451 --> 01:59:00.315]  I know most of you realize this, but I'm going to say it again very, very clearly.
[01:59:01.778 --> 01:59:07.043]  You are just as important as I am or the rest of the crew at InfoWars, and we are.
[01:59:07.043 --> 01:59:12.068]  The individuals that have done the research to understand the Global's battle plan, and we know how to take them down.
[01:59:12.068 --> 01:59:13.529]  That's why they're so upset.
[01:59:13.529 --> 01:59:15.491]  Think how far we've come together.
[01:59:15.491 --> 01:59:24.979]  You know, even if we were losing, we'd all still keep fighting on because it's the right thing to do against the truly satanic forces of the New World Order who've really taken the mask off.
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:27.901]  The line's in the sand for everybody now.
[01:59:27.901 --> 01:59:32.482]  But you'd already chosen to fight the corruption, and to stand with God, and to stand with the unborn.
[01:59:32.482 --> 01:59:39.203]  So I just wanted to take time out again to salute the audience, because you are truly activists in the arena.
[01:59:39.203 --> 01:59:46.785]  And without you, and your prayers, and your word of mouth, and your financial support, this operation that you built, that's your operation, would not be here.
[01:59:46.785 --> 01:59:50.126]  We've got some giant specials running right now at mfulworthstore.com.
[01:59:50.126 --> 01:59:50.846]  A lot of items are 50% off.
[01:59:52.363 --> 02:00:00.667]  Please take advantage of it at InfoWarsTore.com to help us fight even harder into the future.
[02:00:00.667 --> 02:00:08.471]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:08.471 --> 02:00:13.514]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:00:13.514 --> 02:00:16.395]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:16.395 --> 02:00:18.096]  You know, I'm not trying to be dramatic.
[02:00:21.254 --> 02:00:26.336]  But there's articles up on Infowars that I didn't write that are like, you know, America takes its last gasp.
[02:00:26.336 --> 02:00:30.817]  I don't think that's the case, but we're on the knife's edge of which way we're going to go.
[02:00:30.817 --> 02:00:39.840]  And if you don't probably feel the danger like standing at the edge of a cliff or pulling a pet out of a hand grenade and sitting there with it in your hand, something's wrong with you.
[02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:42.721]  Joe Skousen, what would you call this period of time we're in?
[02:00:42.721 --> 02:00:47.122]  And then I held you over just to give your prognosis.
[02:00:48.544 --> 02:00:49.685]  Well, I guess it isn't over yet.
[02:00:49.685 --> 02:00:56.650]  I guess give your diagnosis on this incredible campaign we see right now.
[02:00:56.650 --> 02:00:59.573]  Because I agree, Hillary's always been intending to run.
[02:00:59.573 --> 02:01:00.774]  I've talked to people that are around her.
[02:01:00.774 --> 02:01:08.059]  They say, no, she still runs the Democratic Party, and that they intend to have Trump all embroiled in impeachment, and that they think he'll be gone.
[02:01:08.059 --> 02:01:11.122]  Now, again, they're delusional, so maybe they're not going to act.
[02:01:11.122 --> 02:01:14.804]  But they have the look in their eyes, the behavior, all the actions.
[02:01:14.804 --> 02:01:15.665]  The knives are out.
[02:01:15.665 --> 02:01:16.486]  They're going for Trump.
[02:01:18.462 --> 02:01:22.404]  Well, and they're also coming for conservatives and their guns.
[02:01:22.404 --> 02:01:24.764]  It's very, very clear that this is a crucial election.
[02:01:24.764 --> 02:01:31.547]  The 2020 election is going to decide whether we ever, as conservatives, win another election again or not.
[02:01:31.547 --> 02:01:36.589]  Now, I personally think we've already lost the majority, the affected majority.
[02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:38.830]  If it weren't for Trump's populism pulling in
[02:01:39.881 --> 02:01:43.062]  People from outside the conservative and libertarian movement.
[02:01:43.062 --> 02:01:45.663]  He wouldn't have won in 2016, and he wouldn't have won in 2020.
[02:01:45.663 --> 02:01:50.125]  But he is capable of bringing in that wider basket of votes.
[02:01:50.125 --> 02:02:00.629]  And so, if the Democrats win, if Hillary Clinton runs again and wins again, it's going to be a juggernaut against gun owners and things.
[02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:03.230]  And there's certainly going to be, you know, some legislation.
[02:02:03.230 --> 02:02:05.410]  It won't be an all-out gun ban at first.
[02:02:05.410 --> 02:02:06.751]  They're still going to do it slowly.
[02:02:07.535 --> 02:02:13.141]  But I think by 2024, probably gun rights will be gone in the United States.
[02:02:13.141 --> 02:02:15.304]  That's how long it will take, even for the Democrats.
[02:02:15.304 --> 02:02:21.250]  They remember the last time they banned assault weapons and lost a lot of people in Congress.
[02:02:21.250 --> 02:02:27.277]  But if Trump cannot win again with this onslaught against him,
[02:02:28.084 --> 02:02:32.187]  It's going to show that we're going to be in the permanent minority, and then everything changes.
[02:02:32.187 --> 02:02:34.748]  Because unfortunately, we're in a raw democracy now.
[02:02:34.748 --> 02:02:36.929]  We're not in a constitutional republic anymore.
[02:02:36.929 --> 02:02:39.671]  There are no limitations on what Congress can do.
[02:02:39.671 --> 02:02:47.616]  The courts are controlled by the deep state, as well as most members in Congress through NSA spying and the dirt that they have on them.
[02:02:48.998 --> 02:02:55.081]  So it's only through the office of Donald Trump that we've been able to survive this long in another four years.
[02:02:55.081 --> 02:03:00.843]  God literally gave us Trump as a reprieve, as a last chance to say, you really sure you want to do this America?
[02:03:00.843 --> 02:03:06.526]  I think we're being given that last chance that we see historically and biblically that tends to come before real judgment.
[02:03:08.137 --> 02:03:16.001]  But it's important for your listeners to understand that it isn't the slow or the even quickening of the socialist agenda that's going to take down this nation.
[02:03:16.001 --> 02:03:19.803]  The real threat is Russian-China intending to strike the West and the U.S.
[02:03:19.803 --> 02:03:23.785]  is going to let that first strike fall and get us into a global New World Order.
[02:03:23.785 --> 02:03:26.286]  And if you see how tough it's been for the U.K.
[02:03:26.286 --> 02:03:31.248]  to get out of the EU, you just try after World War III getting out of the global government.
[02:03:31.248 --> 02:03:33.149]  It's not going to happen.
[02:03:33.149 --> 02:03:35.930]  And so that's the real ultimate threat.
[02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:36.791]  That's when you have
[02:03:37.352 --> 02:03:41.554]  Prison camps on a global basis, taking down people who believe in conspiracy.
[02:03:41.554 --> 02:03:43.635]  It's not just banning their videos.
[02:03:43.635 --> 02:03:49.458]  We're looking at a major onslaught of prison camps against people who believe in conspiracy.
[02:03:49.458 --> 02:03:54.220]  Because that is the target, ultimately, you and I. They want total submission.
[02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:57.002]  They want to sterilize the children, brain chip everybody.
[02:03:57.002 --> 02:03:57.902]  Total world government.
[02:03:57.902 --> 02:03:59.223]  It's all being announced, Joel.
[02:03:59.223 --> 02:04:02.064]  Can you believe you were talking about this 40-something years ago?
[02:04:02.064 --> 02:04:05.246]  Your famous uncle, Sepp, 65, 70 years ago.
[02:04:05.246 --> 02:04:06.927]  And now it's just all out in the open, Joel.
[02:04:08.106 --> 02:04:09.907]  Yeah, it's happening as we speak.
[02:04:09.907 --> 02:04:14.931]  And yet, how many Americans are still fat, dumb and happy and listen to the evening news and don't see it?
[02:04:14.931 --> 02:04:16.812]  That's what omitting the truth does.
[02:04:16.812 --> 02:04:26.739]  That's why your banned video is so important, Alex, because finally there's an alternative to YouTube to get these banned videos and opinions out there in the open.
[02:04:26.739 --> 02:04:27.640]  I applaud you for it.
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:28.781]  Well, thank you.
[02:04:28.781 --> 02:04:30.262]  I mean, we plan to get even more contributors.
[02:04:30.262 --> 02:04:30.943]  We are.
[02:04:30.943 --> 02:04:32.604]  So there's big events.
[02:04:32.604 --> 02:04:36.788]  News reporters and other people have a place where they can put something where it's not going to be blocked.
[02:04:36.788 --> 02:04:42.734]  Because anything viral that exposes tyranny, like Hillary falling down three years ago, now that would never be allowed up.
[02:04:42.734 --> 02:04:46.177]  They took it down back then, but then it had to go back up, but now they've got control.
[02:04:46.177 --> 02:04:51.382]  So that's why things like Band-Odd Video are checkmate for them, because it'll bypass them.
[02:04:51.382 --> 02:04:52.643]  Thank you, Joel Skousen.
[02:04:52.643 --> 02:04:53.224]  God bless you, sir.
[02:04:54.511 --> 02:05:02.317]  My pleasure, Alex, and help your subscribers remember they can get a free copy of my newsletter, editor, at worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:05:02.317 --> 02:05:03.137]  That's right.
[02:05:03.137 --> 02:05:05.219]  Send the email there.
[02:05:05.219 --> 02:05:09.622]  My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump, just like you have.
[02:05:09.622 --> 02:05:17.027]  And my goodness, yesterday's press conference, when they came in on him with all their garbage, the foreign reporters, the U.S.
[02:05:17.027 --> 02:05:22.331]  reporters, these little political sellouts, these whores, he just tore them to bits.
[02:05:22.811 --> 02:05:24.552]  And it's one thing to hear it if you're a radio listener.
[02:05:24.552 --> 02:05:25.092]  It's powerful.
[02:05:25.092 --> 02:05:28.374]  But if you see it, it's all at Band.Video.
[02:05:28.374 --> 02:05:30.595]  We've got the full press conference.
[02:05:30.595 --> 02:05:33.256]  We've got my boil down of how epic it is.
[02:05:33.256 --> 02:05:34.437]  It's all at Band.Video.
[02:05:34.437 --> 02:05:39.459]  And you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[02:05:39.459 --> 02:05:40.460]  This was amazing.
[02:05:40.460 --> 02:05:42.981]  And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[02:05:42.981 --> 02:05:47.063]  So InfoWars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening.
[02:05:47.063 --> 02:05:51.826]  And we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at Band.Video.
[02:05:52.646 --> 02:05:58.788]  And I gotta tell you, we've done great video work, we've done great films, we've done so much, but websites are not our thing.
[02:05:58.788 --> 02:05:59.748]  Well, now they are!
[02:05:59.748 --> 02:06:01.588]  I'm so proud of Banned.On.Video, folks.
[02:06:01.588 --> 02:06:07.830]  Check it out, there's a lot of new features at Banned.On.Video.
[02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:10.551]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:10.551 --> 02:06:15.672]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:33.474 --> 02:06:37.635]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I've been interviewing Lee Stranahan for a long time.
[02:06:37.635 --> 02:06:46.297]  He'll be with us until about 40 after or so that I'm going to get into South Park being banned in China and the NBA and that huge fight that's really waking a lot of people up.
[02:06:46.297 --> 02:06:49.197]  But Lee Stranahan, I hear his name on the streets all the time.
[02:06:49.197 --> 02:06:50.178]  People call in about him.
[02:06:50.178 --> 02:06:54.038]  They're like, wow, he's doing a lot of really great investigative journalism.
[02:06:54.038 --> 02:06:56.419]  He's worked for major conservative publications like Breitbart.
[02:06:56.419 --> 02:07:01.420]  He's worked for, you know, leftist publications out there as well, like Coverage and Post.
[02:07:02.654 --> 02:07:06.096]  He has a syndicated radio and TV show, and he writes for The Populist.
[02:07:06.096 --> 02:07:28.886]  But he has done a bunch of investigations into what's really happening with Ukraine, and what's really happening with these whistleblowers, and the real corruption of Hillary, and Biden, and Hunter Biden, and Mitt Romney, and these neocons, and the billions that got laundered out during the ongoing conflict of the last decade.
[02:07:28.886 --> 02:07:32.168]  They're not just the civil war of the last five years.
[02:07:33.297 --> 02:07:40.360]  He's interviewed some of the real whistleblowers in all of this and he also has a lot of great analysis on the impeachment.
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:51.325]  But now they're announcing that they are looking to hold these hearings with a video feed with a blacked out face of whoever the whistleblowers are.
[02:07:51.325 --> 02:07:54.367]  Now the first whistleblower was third person.
[02:07:54.367 --> 02:07:59.029]  Now the new whistleblower is second person and is the person that reportedly
[02:08:00.816 --> 02:08:02.217]  Worked with the first whistleblower.
[02:08:02.217 --> 02:08:06.000]  So it's a CIA feedback loop.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:10.444]  And we're going to be going over all of that here today.
[02:08:10.444 --> 02:08:12.126]  We'll also look at Pat Robertson.
[02:08:12.126 --> 02:08:12.786]  I've mentioned him.
[02:08:12.786 --> 02:08:15.489]  I haven't gotten to the clip.
[02:08:15.489 --> 02:08:21.894]  Basically saying that Trump's about to lose the, you know, divine mandate of heaven.
[02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:23.916]  That's a CHICOM statement, literally.
[02:08:23.916 --> 02:08:27.319]  I mean, things are reaching twilight zone.
[02:08:29.164 --> 02:08:34.466]  Level situations, but here is some of the headlines.
[02:08:34.466 --> 02:08:39.628]  House Democrats consider masking identity of whistleblower.
[02:08:39.628 --> 02:08:40.008]  Boom!
[02:08:40.008 --> 02:08:45.451]  Rush Limbaugh plays clip of Clapper audio admitting Obama made them spy on Trump.
[02:08:45.451 --> 02:08:48.412]  When I saw this morning, I said, he said that two years ago and a year ago.
[02:08:48.412 --> 02:08:49.172]  No, this is news.
[02:08:49.172 --> 02:08:50.813]  We've got all three of those clips.
[02:08:50.813 --> 02:08:52.974]  Yeah, they're now blaming Obama, which is true.
[02:08:52.974 --> 02:08:55.635]  Of course, it goes higher than him, but it shows rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[02:08:56.704 --> 02:09:01.506]  So that's the information that we've got right there.
[02:09:01.506 --> 02:09:07.129]  So let's go ahead and go to Lee Stranahan right now.
[02:09:07.129 --> 02:09:11.411]  Coming up at the start of the next segment.
[02:09:11.411 --> 02:09:14.093]  Let's go ahead and do this.
[02:09:14.093 --> 02:09:16.554]  Let's play the clapper clip.
[02:09:19.246 --> 02:09:30.711]  This is one of the Obama intelligence minions who famously lied to Congress, just like Brennan did, and said there was no surveillance of Trump, there was no surveillance of Americans, period.
[02:09:30.711 --> 02:09:36.794]  Here he is just recently saying it, and again he said it last year, and then he said it two years ago.
[02:09:36.794 --> 02:09:42.137]  So understand, they said back at the time that, oh don't worry, we're going to bust
[02:09:44.110 --> 02:09:47.013]  Trump, because we were listening to him and know he's a Russian spy.
[02:09:47.013 --> 02:09:49.916]  Well, everybody went, wow, that's illegal if you don't have warrants.
[02:09:49.916 --> 02:09:51.498]  Well, they didn't have warrants.
[02:09:51.498 --> 02:09:53.299]  So they went and parallel constructed.
[02:09:53.299 --> 02:09:54.761]  You're already legally surveilling.
[02:09:54.761 --> 02:09:55.301]  You then go.
[02:09:56.531 --> 02:10:08.895]  And you create a new investigation, you have new whistleblowers or new informants who make up a story, they go to the court, they lie, to then get you a warrant to claim that you were legally spying on people.
[02:10:08.895 --> 02:10:11.436]  But then you use the spying to insert disinfo into it.
[02:10:11.436 --> 02:10:15.717]  So that's what I'd call a dirty parallel construction.
[02:10:15.717 --> 02:10:18.378]  So here again is Clapper.
[02:10:19.827 --> 02:10:28.273]  As you know, the President now has sitting members of this government, the Attorney General, traveling the world now, meeting with U.S.
[02:10:28.273 --> 02:10:34.497]  intelligence partners, trying to find out, in his view, whether they participated in some sort of
[02:10:35.257 --> 02:10:40.820]  Obama administration-led effort to undermine President Trump in the last election here.
[02:10:40.820 --> 02:10:51.325]  You also know that John Durham, who is a former prosecutor, senior Justice Department official, he's pursuing his own investigation on the origins of that probe.
[02:10:51.325 --> 02:10:59.950]  Are you concerned that Barr's or Durham's investigation will find wrongdoing and seek to punish former intelligence officials?
[02:11:01.536 --> 02:11:05.678]  Well, I don't know.
[02:11:05.678 --> 02:11:07.679]  I don't think there was any wrongdoing.
[02:11:07.679 --> 02:11:16.322]  I think at the time all of us were trying to navigate a very, very difficult, politically fraught, highly charged situation.
[02:11:16.322 --> 02:11:26.047]  I know for my part, my main concern was the Russians and the threat posed by the Russians to our very political fabric.
[02:11:26.947 --> 02:11:48.640]  And the message I'm getting from all this is apparently what we were supposed to have done was to ignore the Russian interference, ignore the Russian meddling and the threat that it poses to us, and oh by the way, blown off what the then Commander-in-Chief, President Obama, told us to do, which was to assemble all the reporting that we could
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:53.983]  So that's a clip from yesterday, and that's Clapper, former head of National Intelligence,
[02:12:16.451 --> 02:12:21.053]  On CNN, issuing the Nuremberg defense.
[02:12:21.053 --> 02:12:33.278]  The Nazis at the Nuremberg trials in 1946, Harman Goring and the rest of them, said, hey, we were following orders of our military commander, Adolf Hitler.
[02:12:33.278 --> 02:12:37.640]  And so, when I saw this a year and a half ago, I said, uh-oh.
[02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:39.761]  They know rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[02:12:39.761 --> 02:12:40.742]  They know they've committed crimes.
[02:12:40.742 --> 02:12:42.563]  They know they're being looked at by grand juries.
[02:12:42.563 --> 02:12:44.683]  So they said, hey, the commander in chief told me so.
[02:12:44.683 --> 02:12:45.624]  So that's yesterday.
[02:12:46.872 --> 02:12:48.413]  Here he is a year ago.
[02:12:48.413 --> 02:12:49.294]  Here's Clapper again.
[02:12:49.294 --> 02:12:51.155]  So it's he who tasked us.
[02:13:15.410 --> 02:13:17.131]  Intelligence assessment.
[02:13:17.131 --> 02:13:18.952]  Illegally spying.
[02:13:18.952 --> 02:13:21.533]  Then they go, oh, Trump got elected.
[02:13:21.533 --> 02:13:22.914]  Hillary's not in.
[02:13:22.914 --> 02:13:24.414]  You've got to go parallel constructs.
[02:13:24.414 --> 02:13:27.336]  You've got to go to the FISA court.
[02:13:27.336 --> 02:13:31.117]  You've got to make up all these reasons you're going after Trump.
[02:13:31.117 --> 02:13:39.501]  You've got to have all these intelligence operatives go out and talk to all his campaign people down to low level and tell them you've got stuff from the Russians.
[02:13:39.501 --> 02:13:40.602]  Well, none of them even bit.
[02:13:44.087 --> 02:13:51.649]  But they convicted Papadopoulos of forgetting somebody who had a connection to Russians talked to him at a bar.
[02:13:51.649 --> 02:13:56.450]  And of course that person was MI6.
[02:13:56.450 --> 02:13:58.170]  So it goes on and on and on.
[02:13:58.170 --> 02:14:05.412]  Folks, I've had them, I've had the Democrats try to pull the crap where they have the Russians reach out with money.
[02:14:05.412 --> 02:14:09.833]  And of course I called the FBI and sent a letter to the FBI and it was not
[02:14:10.643 --> 02:14:12.805]  Hell, I went into the FBI.
[02:14:12.805 --> 02:14:15.928]  It was not the Russians.
[02:14:15.928 --> 02:14:18.191]  Okay?
[02:14:18.191 --> 02:14:21.955]  That's how out of control all this is.
[02:14:21.955 --> 02:14:22.115]  And...
[02:14:25.154 --> 02:14:26.795]  It's ridiculous.
[02:14:26.795 --> 02:14:29.817]  Lee Stranahan, I'm not keeping him on hold.
[02:14:29.817 --> 02:14:35.821]  I love technology, but it's got more and more bugs on it because it's all got surveillance on it.
[02:14:35.821 --> 02:14:39.904]  And Skype and all these browsers, all these systems, not just Skype.
[02:14:39.904 --> 02:14:42.346]  I know Skype is a communications system, not a browser.
[02:14:42.346 --> 02:14:45.028]  But they've all got stuff piggybacked on them.
[02:14:45.028 --> 02:14:46.589]  And that's why they have so many problems today.
[02:14:46.589 --> 02:14:49.251]  And it's been like a haunted house around here with the equipment.
[02:14:50.009 --> 02:14:51.730]  And everybody else's equipment's been like a haunted house.
[02:14:51.730 --> 02:14:53.091]  So that's nobody's fault.
[02:14:53.091 --> 02:14:55.892]  It's kind of what's fun about live radio.
[02:14:55.892 --> 02:14:58.033]  What's fun about live TV.
[02:14:58.033 --> 02:14:59.874]  And at least Skype isn't working soon.
[02:14:59.874 --> 02:15:03.816]  We'll do something old-fashioned called the Landline.
[02:15:03.816 --> 02:15:06.157]  If he still has a landline.
[02:15:06.157 --> 02:15:07.938]  It's an old Joe Rogan skit from like 2000.
[02:15:07.938 --> 02:15:10.820]  I saw him do it live.
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:16.643]  And he's like, man, the world, back when I was a kid, you know, back in the early 70s,
[02:15:18.558 --> 02:15:23.528]  We all thought by the year 2000 we'd be flying around in silver spacesuits with jetpacks.
[02:15:23.528 --> 02:15:27.175]  Instead the year 2000 is here and I get behind a bush and my cell phone craps out.
[02:15:28.459 --> 02:15:29.479]  And that's absolutely true.
[02:15:29.479 --> 02:15:32.320]  And all the studies show us technology does not make us happy.
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:34.100]  Technology makes us depressed.
[02:15:34.100 --> 02:15:35.821]  It makes us really more alone.
[02:15:35.821 --> 02:15:38.801]  We don't have really valuable interactions because of it.
[02:15:38.801 --> 02:15:43.102]  Whereas going fishing, or camping, or hiking, or in the forest, that empowers us.
[02:15:43.102 --> 02:15:44.543]  That brings us back closer to God.
[02:15:44.543 --> 02:15:49.584]  And I know I'm saying something incredibly simple here, but it's the simple things that are really the most powerful, aren't they?
[02:15:49.584 --> 02:15:55.385]  So, Lee Stranahan's coming up, and then I'm going to air the incredibly informative South Park.
[02:15:55.385 --> 02:15:56.506]  You talk about genius.
[02:15:56.506 --> 02:15:57.626]  I don't even want to, you know,
[02:15:58.806 --> 02:15:59.807]  Kiss the butt of those guys.
[02:15:59.807 --> 02:16:04.370]  I disagree with a lot of stuff they've done, but they agree with free speech, so we'll play their clips.
[02:16:04.370 --> 02:16:05.631]  Maybe not today.
[02:16:05.631 --> 02:16:06.912]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:16:06.912 --> 02:16:10.654]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:10.654 --> 02:16:11.735]  Forget bonkers.
[02:16:11.735 --> 02:16:13.216]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[02:16:13.556 --> 02:16:23.066]  You need Survivalist Camps, the ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.

[02:16:34.124 --> 02:16:35.364]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:35.364 --> 02:16:39.266]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:39.266 --> 02:16:40.806]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:40.806 --> 02:16:43.767]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:43.767 --> 02:16:49.329]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:49.329 --> 02:16:50.529]  I can help you, too.
[02:16:50.529 --> 02:16:53.470]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:16:53.470 --> 02:16:55.691]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:16:55.691 --> 02:17:00.132]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[02:17:00.132 --> 02:17:02.413]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[02:17:04.102 --> 02:17:06.063]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:17:06.063 --> 02:17:11.365]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:17:11.365 --> 02:17:12.966]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:17:12.966 --> 02:17:21.310]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:17:21.310 --> 02:17:27.013]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.

[02:19:23.759 --> 02:19:25.980]  Cardiovascular and heart health support is one of the biggest.

[02:19:27.500 --> 02:19:30.841]  Helps support the body's natural nitric oxide production.

[02:20:08.107 --> 02:20:10.729]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:29.275 --> 02:20:35.658]  We have a president who's openly trying to restore sovereignty back to the nation and trying to jumpstart our economy.
[02:20:35.658 --> 02:20:41.681]  The globalists have purposely moved our economy over to China.
[02:20:41.681 --> 02:20:44.603]  And now we're in the middle of a massive economic war.
[02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:47.741]  Again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:20:47.741 --> 02:20:51.003]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:20:51.003 --> 02:20:59.088]  We have investigative journalist, Lee Stranahan, joining us to look at what's happening geopolitically overseas.
[02:20:59.088 --> 02:21:01.530]  They moved to impeach the president.
[02:21:01.530 --> 02:21:05.933]  What's happening with the so-called whistleblowers out of
[02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:10.131]  Ukraine and out of the United States.
[02:21:10.131 --> 02:21:13.694]  Lee Stranahan, ThePopulist.us investigative journalist.
[02:21:13.694 --> 02:21:20.999]  Why don't you boil it all down in summation, the climate we're in, how it all ties together, the impeachment first.
[02:21:20.999 --> 02:21:25.642]  Then let's get into these so-called whistleblowers and why the deep state's so upset about Ukraine.
[02:21:25.642 --> 02:21:33.188]  Then we'll have the exclusive audio with a real Ukraine whistleblower about what's really going on that you're providing for us here to break on air.
[02:21:33.188 --> 02:21:34.549]  So I'm very appreciative of that.
[02:21:34.549 --> 02:21:35.569]  We'll do that next segment.
[02:21:35.569 --> 02:21:36.310]  Lee, thanks for coming on.
[02:21:37.113 --> 02:21:38.454]  Well, Alex, thanks for having me.
[02:21:38.454 --> 02:21:40.895]  And once again, thanks for having me over the years as well.
[02:21:40.895 --> 02:21:44.737]  You know, I've been covering this story for about two and a half years.
[02:21:44.737 --> 02:21:54.342]  I've been saying everything we've been seeing about this Russiagate story for the past three years now all comes down to Ukraine.
[02:21:54.924 --> 02:21:59.706]  And for a long time, Alex, for years now, nobody would listen.
[02:21:59.706 --> 02:22:04.588]  And every time I would talk about Ukraine, I was like screaming into the desert.
[02:22:04.588 --> 02:22:11.991]  And the one outlet that consistently has been having me on, you, David Knight, other people, has been InfoWars.
[02:22:11.991 --> 02:22:16.753]  And I've got to say, this is the biggest information war.
[02:22:16.753 --> 02:22:18.554]  That's what we're seeing right now.
[02:22:18.554 --> 02:22:22.435]  They are trying to hide the truth about this from the American people.
[02:22:22.435 --> 02:22:23.496]  That's what they're trying to do.
[02:22:24.236 --> 02:22:26.537]  And so let's go over this.
[02:22:26.537 --> 02:22:30.678]  You know, some people are calling this Russiagate 2.0.
[02:22:30.678 --> 02:22:34.399]  But really, Alex, this is Russiagate .9.
[02:22:34.399 --> 02:22:36.159]  This is where it started.
[02:22:36.159 --> 02:22:44.141]  And the reason I say that is that this was a plan by the Democrats to tie Donald Trump to Russia.
[02:22:45.077 --> 02:22:51.920]  And let's be clear, you've been coming on the show specifically about this for three years since it ever began.
[02:22:51.920 --> 02:22:56.883]  You've been at the tip of the spear here, explaining that the way to bring down the deep state is Ukraine.
[02:22:56.883 --> 02:23:01.205]  They realize that, so they're turning it around against Trump, just like they did Russia.
[02:23:01.205 --> 02:23:04.046]  That's right, and they're accusing him of what they've been doing.
[02:23:04.046 --> 02:23:05.087]  So here's the reality.
[02:23:05.686 --> 02:23:06.607]  Here's the reality.
[02:23:06.607 --> 02:23:11.351]  The hoax is that Trump colluded with Russia.
[02:23:11.351 --> 02:23:14.334]  Now that seemed to fall apart in the Mueller investigation.
[02:23:14.334 --> 02:23:19.138]  And so what you're seeing now is they're trying to do a cover-up of the actual story.
[02:23:19.138 --> 02:23:24.123]  The actual story was that Democrats colluded with the government of Ukraine
[02:23:24.583 --> 02:23:30.727]  That they put into power, remember what happened in 2014 with the so-called People's Coup?
[02:23:30.727 --> 02:23:34.509]  That was not, that was a, that was the Revolution of Dignity, they call it.
[02:23:34.509 --> 02:23:36.950]  That was not the Revolution of Dignity.
[02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:51.338]  What that was, Alex, was that was a coup put into place by the Obama administration, set up by Hillary Clinton, and people like Victoria Nuland, who she put into place, and people like John Kerry,
[02:23:52.418 --> 02:23:54.679]  Who was the Secretary of State at the time?
[02:23:54.679 --> 02:23:56.720]  So let's just go back to that real briefly.
[02:23:56.720 --> 02:24:00.221]  You got to start there.
[02:24:00.221 --> 02:24:05.804]  In 2013, they used Occupy style tactics to do what was called the Euro Madone, right?
[02:24:05.804 --> 02:24:07.865]  They called it the Euro Madone.
[02:24:07.865 --> 02:24:13.527]  And it was supposedly like Occupy Wall Street, organic, you know, an organic movement.
[02:24:13.527 --> 02:24:15.668]  And because I'd covered Occupy Wall Street,
[02:24:16.400 --> 02:24:21.363]  I knew the tactics, and my ears perked up, and I said, this is not organic.
[02:24:21.363 --> 02:24:24.084]  This is something that is being funded.
[02:24:24.084 --> 02:24:34.290]  And sure enough, it's funded by George Soros, who has the biggest NGO, non-government organization in Ukraine, called International Renaissance.
[02:24:34.870 --> 02:24:48.457]  Now, all anybody has to do to figure this out is go to YouTube, look up Victoria Nuland Ukraine brag, and you'll see that Victoria Nuland bragged that $8 billion in U.S.
[02:24:48.457 --> 02:24:52.199]  tax dollars was used to subvert Ukraine.
[02:24:52.199 --> 02:24:58.181]  Then, you can look up George Soros and his international renaissance, and he's also bragged about it.
[02:24:58.181 --> 02:25:01.063]  So again, not conjecture, Alex, this is a fact.
[02:25:02.054 --> 02:25:15.898]  Then what they did was, after they threw out the democratically elected government of Ukraine, Yanukovych, after they did that, they put into place the government they wanted through this guy Petro Poroshenko.
[02:25:15.898 --> 02:25:21.779]  Now, how did this work out for the people of Ukraine, the citizens of Ukraine?
[02:25:21.779 --> 02:25:24.940]  Answer, Ukraine became the poorest country in Europe.
[02:25:25.818 --> 02:25:31.963]  And Petro Poroshenko was voted out eventually by a comedian named Zelensky.
[02:25:31.963 --> 02:25:34.445]  That's the president who Trump was on the phone with.
[02:25:34.445 --> 02:25:41.851]  And the reason he got voted out, Alex, Poroshenko was the least popular leader in the world.
[02:25:41.851 --> 02:25:45.835]  He had a 6% approval rating right before the election.
[02:25:45.835 --> 02:25:52.020]  He presided over the looting by the deep state of that wealthy country, Ukraine.
[02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:53.301]  So now we move forward.
[02:25:54.093 --> 02:25:56.014]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:25:56.014 --> 02:25:56.694]  And he's important.
[02:25:56.694 --> 02:25:58.175]  Now, let's talk about the audio.
[02:25:58.175 --> 02:26:00.136]  We'll play this after the break.
[02:26:00.136 --> 02:26:05.838]  But the viceroy, the person who was the point person, as you'll hear in this audio, was Joe Biden.
[02:26:06.733 --> 02:26:08.935]  And Joe Biden ran that country.
[02:26:08.935 --> 02:26:09.776]  He was the fixer.
[02:26:09.776 --> 02:26:10.937]  They called him Uncle Joe.
[02:26:10.937 --> 02:26:12.419]  You'll hear all of this.
[02:26:12.419 --> 02:26:22.789]  So, the other thing is, there's an article that came out in Politico in January of 2017, right before the inauguration.
[02:26:22.789 --> 02:26:30.997]  Politico, Ken Vogel, he's not a, he's a lib, he's not a Trump supporter, but it was a well-reported article, Alex, and it detailed this
[02:26:31.617 --> 02:26:39.141]  Collusion, and how a woman named Alexandra Chalupa, a Deep State DNC operative, was right behind this.
[02:26:39.141 --> 02:27:00.272]  And she, what she had done is at the 2016, the beginning of 2016, she went to the Ukrainian embassy and she, with the help of the ambassador, Ambassador Chaly, and this woman named Oksana Shalour, who ran the embassy, they told, she came in, she said I'm with the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[02:27:01.207 --> 02:27:09.493]  And they told a guy named Andrei Telezenko, who worked there, don't coordinate with Trump and we're looking for dirt on Trump.
[02:27:09.493 --> 02:27:12.655]  Now, this is all in that Politico article, Alex.
[02:27:12.655 --> 02:27:15.037]  It's all right there in black and white.
[02:27:15.037 --> 02:27:18.960]  And what they're petrified about now is people like Ron Johnson.
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:24.884]  Did you see him going toe to toe with Chuck Todd on Meet the Press?
[02:27:24.884 --> 02:27:25.104]  Yes.
[02:27:25.985 --> 02:27:28.267]  He brought up this article.
[02:27:28.267 --> 02:27:35.613]  The media is scared to death that you or anybody out there is going to read this because it's very well reported.
[02:27:35.613 --> 02:27:37.614]  And by the way, we're not bragging here.
[02:27:37.614 --> 02:27:51.966]  I literally had you and a bunch of other people on, including in studio during the Trump campaign, talking about all the Ukraine stuff and how this was the way to bring down Hillary and the rest of them.
[02:27:51.966 --> 02:27:53.907]  And so it's just asinine now
[02:27:55.046 --> 02:27:58.967]  To have them turn all this around and make it criminal.
[02:27:58.967 --> 02:28:04.989]  If Trump was saying to somebody, wow, did you see Joe Biden bragging, he got the prosecutor fired for investigating his son.
[02:28:04.989 --> 02:28:07.070]  That's like bragging about killing people on TV.
[02:28:07.070 --> 02:28:12.172]  It's just incredible how they've turned this all around, but that shows you why, because they're so scared.
[02:28:13.345 --> 02:28:15.106]  That's exactly right.
[02:28:15.106 --> 02:28:16.828]  And here's the thing, Alex.
[02:28:16.828 --> 02:28:18.729]  This is where the info wars come in.
[02:28:18.729 --> 02:28:23.714]  Because, in fact, every media outlet, CNN's been part of a cover-up.
[02:28:23.714 --> 02:28:26.476]  The Washington Post has been part of a cover-up.
[02:28:26.476 --> 02:28:31.920]  But people can find this article, read it for themselves, and go, gee, there's something going on here.
[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:36.384]  So when we come back from the break, I'm going to play you exclusive audio, an interview I did
[02:28:37.208 --> 02:28:40.751]  Back in March, with this whistleblower, Andre Telezenko.
[02:28:40.751 --> 02:28:46.076]  This guy's a hero, and I want to tell you about him right when we come back from break, okay?
[02:28:46.076 --> 02:28:49.319]  We'll do that with Lee Stranahan straight ahead, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:28:49.319 --> 02:28:51.841]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[02:28:51.841 --> 02:28:52.962]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:28:52.962 --> 02:28:53.363]  Stay with us.
[02:29:04.019 --> 02:29:08.583]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:29:08.583 --> 02:29:10.665]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:10.665 --> 02:29:12.407]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:12.407 --> 02:29:18.953]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:18.953 --> 02:29:24.037]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:24.037 --> 02:29:28.742]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:29.162 --> 02:29:32.285]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[02:29:58.144 --> 02:30:05.187]  That's 800-506-6740.
[02:30:05.187 --> 02:30:07.008]  I'm up here with the crew.
[02:30:07.008 --> 02:30:12.550]  It's late at night, but I can't leave the office because history's happening right now.
[02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:17.632]  This is a battle of wills between those that want a free world and those that want tyranny.
[02:30:17.632 --> 02:30:20.974]  Those who've bet against humanity and those who've bet on humanity.
[02:30:21.694 --> 02:30:23.396]  So I'm so thankful to you, the listeners.
[02:30:23.396 --> 02:30:24.596]  You are the salt of the earth.

[02:32:05.074 --> 02:32:09.597]  The truth is, President Trump is the most investigated president in history.
[02:32:09.597 --> 02:32:13.559]  He is working for American interests steadfastly.
[02:32:13.559 --> 02:32:24.865]  He is trying to preserve our country as the globalists try to break our borders, bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist Chinese control, who now own Hollywood and the majority of our debt.
[02:32:25.385 --> 02:32:28.747]  We have been maneuvered towards collapse and bankruptcy.
[02:32:28.747 --> 02:32:33.789]  But at the 11th hour, 58th minute, the American people put a populist in power.
[02:32:33.789 --> 02:32:35.790]  And it's happening all over the world.
[02:32:35.790 --> 02:32:37.351]  So great things are happening.
[02:32:37.351 --> 02:32:39.352]  But the enemy is striking back.
[02:32:39.352 --> 02:32:42.413]  They're very serious with this impeachment plan.
[02:32:42.413 --> 02:32:44.234]  It has bipartisan support.
[02:32:44.234 --> 02:32:47.576]  And I'm telling you, President Trump needs our prayers and info wars.
[02:32:47.816 --> 02:32:49.797]  Need your prayers and support.
[02:32:49.797 --> 02:32:52.379]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are trying to shut us down.
[02:32:52.379 --> 02:33:08.027]  But right now, it's easier than ever to financially support us while getting great products at the same time with Black Friday comes two months early with store-wide free shipping, double Patreon points, and ladies and gentlemen, 50% off.
[02:33:08.027 --> 02:33:10.649]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:22.179 --> 02:33:24.020]  Big Brother.
[02:33:24.020 --> 02:33:26.361]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:26.361 --> 02:33:29.663]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:29.663 --> 02:33:31.584]  You want answers?
[02:33:31.584 --> 02:33:33.485]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:33.485 --> 02:33:40.989]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:40.989 --> 02:33:41.890]  Now, I want to be clear.
[02:33:43.675 --> 02:33:46.697]  Most of our audience tunes in on a routine basis.
[02:33:46.697 --> 02:33:49.159]  You already heard us talking about this three years ago.
[02:33:49.159 --> 02:33:51.041]  You already know all about it.
[02:33:51.041 --> 02:33:56.665]  But remember, we're on a lot of radio stations and TV stations, and we're like number one on cloud TV and a bunch of other systems.
[02:33:56.665 --> 02:34:05.492]  There are literally hundreds of thousands of new viewers and listeners every hour, conservatively, that's a low number, that are tuned in and they don't know any of this.
[02:34:05.492 --> 02:34:10.136]  They literally believe that Trump's done something corrupt in Ukraine.
[02:34:11.542 --> 02:34:24.936]  And this is the reality management, the war on reality going on because you got a bunch of Republicans involved second off of the crisis, off the war zone, off the looting of Ukraine.
[02:34:24.936 --> 02:34:26.738]  It's been going on a long time.
[02:34:26.738 --> 02:34:30.642]  And you've got these big boards that Republicans are on and that Nancy Pelosi's son is on.
[02:34:31.502 --> 02:34:39.630]  And so, I mean, I gotta say, Lee Stranahan is one of the top two or three people that have been really dug into this, exposing it.
[02:34:39.630 --> 02:34:49.419]  And that's another reason that they want us off air, is because we have these type of guests on the broadcast.
[02:34:50.313 --> 02:34:53.895]  That other people in the establishment don't want you to hear.
[02:34:53.895 --> 02:34:58.998]  I mean, you heard Lee, he said, you've been the most continuous person as this has developed to have me on.
[02:34:58.998 --> 02:35:01.940]  Well, I mean, the guy's a great investigative journalist.
[02:35:01.940 --> 02:35:04.381]  And now you see how important Ukraine is.
[02:35:04.381 --> 02:35:09.024]  Because like I said, China buying up our media, controlling what people can say behind the scenes.
[02:35:09.024 --> 02:35:14.987]  For 10 years, almost every script has to be approved by the Chinese government.
[02:35:14.987 --> 02:35:19.250]  And I would say that to people, and people thought I was crazy.
[02:35:20.202 --> 02:35:22.564]  Because that would be crazy, wouldn't it?
[02:35:22.564 --> 02:35:25.386]  We would never allow that.
[02:35:25.386 --> 02:35:29.610]  Now the NBA is apologizing to the Chai Kongs.
[02:35:29.610 --> 02:35:32.773]  Major video game makers are apologizing.
[02:35:32.773 --> 02:35:41.840]  They're stopping video game tournaments that have millions of viewers and kicking top stars off because they support Hong Kong independence.
[02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:43.522]  That's the real world, folks!
[02:35:43.522 --> 02:35:44.523]  This isn't a game!
[02:35:46.385 --> 02:35:48.827]  And so yes, we're next year's news today.
[02:35:48.827 --> 02:35:53.690]  Hillary and the globalists, because she's already going to be running again, knew that we helped get Trump in.
[02:35:53.690 --> 02:35:56.532]  So they looked at everything I'd ever done, my timeline.
[02:35:56.532 --> 02:36:04.217]  Imagine like a PowerPoint timeline or like a computer timeline on Final Cut Pro or Premiere editing.
[02:36:04.217 --> 02:36:05.718]  You've got all these little thousands of clips.
[02:36:05.718 --> 02:36:07.259]  That's what we've done on air.
[02:36:07.259 --> 02:36:08.440]  Hundreds of thousands of clips, really.
[02:36:09.295 --> 02:36:14.819]  And they just zoom in on a few little sub areas, like a grain of sand at the beach, and go, that's who I am.
[02:36:14.819 --> 02:36:16.941]  And say, oh, he's discredited.
[02:36:16.941 --> 02:36:17.822]  Oh, he's a liar.
[02:36:17.822 --> 02:36:20.824]  Oh, he's a kook.
[02:36:20.824 --> 02:36:25.508]  Because if you really listen to this show, you go, my gosh, these people really know what they're talking about.
[02:36:26.974 --> 02:36:29.136]  And it's not because we're geniuses.
[02:36:29.136 --> 02:36:31.058]  The real global government's out there.
[02:36:31.058 --> 02:36:31.899]  It's in white papers.
[02:36:31.899 --> 02:36:37.684]  The globalists communicate with each other about how they're getting rid of the family, national sovereignty, how they cut off U.S.
[02:36:37.684 --> 02:36:44.051]  energy to build the command base of China because they'll have the management system the globalists want for the world.
[02:36:44.051 --> 02:36:51.278]  I mean, this is all David Rockefeller writes op-ed pieces in the New York Times praising Mao Zedong and saying we need to live like that!
[02:36:56.115 --> 02:36:57.596]  So, that's why they want us off air.
[02:36:57.596 --> 02:37:04.220]  That's why when you share a Band-Aid video, or InfoWars.com, or an article, or when you tell people word of mouth, it changes the world.
[02:37:04.220 --> 02:37:06.561]  That's why when you buy the products, it keeps us on air.
[02:37:06.561 --> 02:37:10.584]  I mean, I've been really stressed out trying to get the funding to keep this place going.
[02:37:11.554 --> 02:37:14.015]  And I don't like coming to you with that pitch.
[02:37:14.015 --> 02:37:16.256]  The real pitch is, we got the best fish oil out there.
[02:37:16.256 --> 02:37:19.837]  You know what fish oil does for your brain, your heart, your sleep, your life?
[02:37:19.837 --> 02:37:21.658]  If it's really good, clean stuff, we've got it.
[02:37:21.658 --> 02:37:27.040]  You know what turmeric does for inflammation and fighting stuff in the body that's really destructive?
[02:37:27.040 --> 02:37:27.941]  I mean, just look at the turmeric.
[02:37:27.941 --> 02:37:29.541]  We got the strongest, best.
[02:37:29.541 --> 02:37:32.823]  You know how great our energy bars are and our protein bars?
[02:37:32.823 --> 02:37:33.583]  It's all great.
[02:37:33.583 --> 02:37:37.965]  It's all 50% off, store-bought free shipping and double Patriot points and a bunch more right now.
[02:37:39.636 --> 02:37:41.159]  But this is the final day.
[02:37:41.159 --> 02:37:48.175]  So Lee, I want to invite you back up, especially when your Skype's working again, to come on and get into impeachment because I wanted to hit...
[02:37:49.855 --> 02:37:53.599]  The Ukraine canard, and that ties into the impeachment.
[02:37:53.599 --> 02:37:56.121]  In all your inside baseball, you live in D.C.
[02:37:56.121 --> 02:37:58.003]  and have a lot of great sources.
[02:37:58.003 --> 02:38:02.187]  But, of course, we have to cover what really happened in Ukraine before we ever get to that point.
[02:38:02.187 --> 02:38:08.473]  But finishing up on that and playing this clip from when you did interview the whistleblower, I'm told you haven't heard this piece yet, so this is exclusive.
[02:38:08.473 --> 02:38:10.075]  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't carry it away.
[02:38:10.075 --> 02:38:10.815]  It's important history.
[02:38:11.696 --> 02:38:13.817]  And then, just briefly, on impeachment.
[02:38:13.817 --> 02:38:15.957]  I mean, I think this is very serious this time.
[02:38:15.957 --> 02:38:17.697]  They're making their move now.
[02:38:17.697 --> 02:38:19.978]  Other stuff was just priming the pump, getting ready.
[02:38:19.978 --> 02:38:26.879]  Because Trump's threatening the bipartisan corruption state that they're really going to make their move.
[02:38:26.879 --> 02:38:28.880]  Give me your view on both, please.
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:29.760]  Well, yeah.
[02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:33.021]  This impeachment, this is part of the cover-up of what really happened.
[02:38:33.021 --> 02:38:34.681]  That's what they want to do, Alex.
[02:38:34.681 --> 02:38:36.301]  They want to cover up the involvement.
[02:38:36.301 --> 02:38:38.622]  Now, what you're about to hear, this audio,
[02:38:39.441 --> 02:38:40.561]  Is shocking.
[02:38:40.561 --> 02:38:47.023]  And I got to tell you, if this audio were about Donald Trump, it would be on every network immediately.
[02:38:47.023 --> 02:38:50.264]  They would cut into programming to play it for people.
[02:38:50.264 --> 02:38:52.945]  What you're going to hear is a guy named Andrei Telezenko.
[02:38:52.945 --> 02:38:57.946]  Now, Andrei was the whistleblower featured in that Politico article.
[02:38:57.946 --> 02:39:01.587]  It took me a year to get this guy to talk to me.
[02:39:01.587 --> 02:39:06.708]  And the reason is because I host a show on Sputnik, so that's Russian funded media.
[02:39:06.708 --> 02:39:08.249]  And this guy is a Ukrainian
[02:39:09.029 --> 02:39:10.210]  Patriot.
[02:39:10.210 --> 02:39:13.451]  And he was skeptical, but I got to tell you, they've been very good to me.
[02:39:13.451 --> 02:39:15.192]  It's been like they let me do what I do.
[02:39:15.192 --> 02:39:16.732]  Otherwise, I'd quit.
[02:39:16.732 --> 02:39:22.895]  And so what you're about to hear is an interview I did months ago with Andre.
[02:39:22.895 --> 02:39:32.739]  And he explained to me the role of Joe Biden and also what happened when that Politico article came out in January of 2017.
[02:39:34.446 --> 02:39:39.287]  Joe Biden was in Ukraine a few days after that article came out.
[02:39:39.287 --> 02:39:44.188]  And Alex, I want you to hear what Joe Biden... Now, again, this guy's a whistleblower.
[02:39:44.188 --> 02:39:45.128]  Let me explain.
[02:39:45.128 --> 02:39:49.849]  When they came to him and said, hey, don't help the Trump campaign.
[02:39:49.849 --> 02:39:52.830]  We're just going to work with Hillary.
[02:39:52.830 --> 02:39:54.750]  We're looking for dirt on Trump.
[02:39:54.750 --> 02:39:59.111]  Andre, partially because he's a... By the way, partially because he's a Christian, Alex.
[02:40:00.572 --> 02:40:09.961]  He said this is wrong, this is immoral, and this is also stupid because he's also a smart political player.
[02:40:09.961 --> 02:40:11.562]  I want you to hear this.
[02:40:11.562 --> 02:40:16.667]  This is what happened when Joe Biden read that Politico article.
[02:40:16.667 --> 02:40:19.249]  Let's hear that clip.
[02:40:19.249 --> 02:40:21.151]  He used to come here and tell people what to do.
[02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:22.520]  Yeah, right, right.
[02:40:40.195 --> 02:40:47.841]  His last meeting with Poroshenko, I know what happened because basically that's when the political article came out, when he was here before the inauguration.
[02:40:47.841 --> 02:40:58.790]  And I know what happened, what they talked about, Biden basically gave this to Poroshenko and said, you f***ed up because it all leaked to the press about what we were working on.
[02:40:58.790 --> 02:41:02.092]  That's when Poroshenko called me in that night.
[02:41:02.092 --> 02:41:03.153]  Poroshenko called you in?
[02:41:04.082 --> 02:41:12.725]  Yeah, when the political article came out, when Biden was in Kiev that night, a week before the inauguration, I think the 11th of January.
[02:41:12.725 --> 02:41:17.387]  Yeah, and so what happened when Poroshenko called you?
[02:41:17.387 --> 02:41:24.850]  He yelled at me for the article, because I leaked everything to both the DNC stuff on the political article.
[02:41:24.850 --> 02:41:26.270]  So Poroshenko personally yelled at you?
[02:41:29.781 --> 02:41:32.341]  Yeah, he called me up to his office.
[02:41:32.341 --> 02:41:40.263]  I was working with the former prosecutor general, Yoram, at the time, consulting him on private issues, basically private financial stuff.
[02:41:40.263 --> 02:41:43.423]  And he called him up and he called me up together.
[02:41:43.423 --> 02:41:52.365]  And he yelled at me for an hour, basically threatened me and whatever to block my career and my business and what I'm going to do in Ukraine.
[02:41:52.365 --> 02:41:53.625]  Yeah.
[02:41:53.625 --> 02:41:54.606]  Yeah.
[02:41:54.606 --> 02:41:57.206]  Because he was so mad because Biden gave him that article.
[02:41:58.734 --> 02:42:00.801]  Biden personally gave him that article.
[02:42:00.801 --> 02:42:01.002]  Yes.
[02:42:02.233 --> 02:42:07.816]  Now the reason that's so massive is that is the source for the big Politico article that you see all over the news now.
[02:42:07.816 --> 02:42:10.777]  And long before it was ever big, you see Stranahan hammering it.
[02:42:10.777 --> 02:42:12.958]  And before it ever got published, Stranahan hammering it.
[02:42:12.958 --> 02:42:24.563]  But he actually went out and got the source to tell you that the installed globalist that looted Ukraine with the Bidens as the viceroy, that Biden was very, very pissed when he learned that.
[02:42:24.563 --> 02:42:28.525]  What a window into these guys' world, Lee Stranahan.
[02:42:29.748 --> 02:42:31.249]  And think about this, Alex.
[02:42:31.249 --> 02:42:42.699]  When they're out there, when everybody in the mainstream media is talking about whistleblowers, they don't defend Julian Assange or a guy like John Kiriakou, who's a CIA whistleblower, or Andrei Telezenko.
[02:42:42.699 --> 02:42:46.882]  They're protecting the CIA, and these guys aren't even whistleblowers.
[02:42:46.882 --> 02:42:47.803]  So think about that.
[02:42:48.143 --> 02:42:51.246]  Let's do a few more minutes on that, because that's a great point.
[02:42:51.246 --> 02:42:58.233]  I mean, Obama waged war on whistleblowers and the press, and then meanwhile Trump's done nothing to the press to act like he's Adolf Hitler.
[02:42:58.233 --> 02:43:00.675]  I mean, it's upside down world.
[02:43:00.675 --> 02:43:03.658]  Then I'm getting to the clips from South Park, then Paul Watson.
[02:43:03.658 --> 02:43:06.581]  Stay with us.
[02:43:06.581 --> 02:43:10.705]  You have all the power in the world, but you must use it.
[02:43:10.705 --> 02:43:11.586]  You must take action.
[02:43:13.326 --> 02:43:16.227]  As of taping this, it's Wednesday afternoon.
[02:43:16.227 --> 02:43:20.208]  We're running the biggest sale we've had since last Christmas.
[02:43:20.208 --> 02:43:28.291]  It's store-wide free shipping, 50% off the high quality supplements from Forest Life, and all the preparedness items like water filtration, air filtration.
[02:43:29.351 --> 02:43:32.134]  Storeable foods, shortwave radios, and so much more.
[02:43:32.134 --> 02:43:33.274]  This is a huge special.
[02:43:33.274 --> 02:43:40.861]  We need to sell a lot of product to fund ourselves, and these sales are a great way for you to get great prices, but also support the InfoWar.
[02:43:40.861 --> 02:43:41.901]  Please take action today.
[02:43:41.901 --> 02:43:48.807]  I've got to end this sale by Sunday or Monday at the max, because a bunch of the items are about to sell out.
[02:43:48.807 --> 02:43:51.209]  Again, too many deals to fit them all in here.
[02:43:51.209 --> 02:43:56.533]  Just please go to InfoWarStore.com and realize they're in this critical time, with the globalists trying to take us off the air.
[02:43:56.533 --> 02:43:58.575]  Your support is absolutely essential, so thank you.
[02:44:00.422 --> 02:44:03.643]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[02:44:03.643 --> 02:44:10.946]  The globalists and their democrat minions are on the verge of taking this cold civil war hot.
[02:44:10.946 --> 02:44:22.691]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship and sabotage of the economy and attacks run by the UN on the border that are nothing short of war.
[02:44:23.231 --> 02:44:33.718]  And that's because it is a war by multinational corporations, allied with the shycoms and others, with the Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating filth, to try to capture the United States.
[02:44:33.718 --> 02:44:36.559]  This is 21st century war.
[02:44:36.559 --> 02:44:39.381]  And wars need money to be prosecuted.
[02:44:39.381 --> 02:44:40.602]  And we're actually winning the war.
[02:44:40.802 --> 02:44:43.164]  But the enemy's throwing their full weight at us right now.
[02:44:43.164 --> 02:44:44.684]  That's why we need financial support.
[02:44:44.684 --> 02:44:46.265]  It's a total 360 win.
[02:44:46.265 --> 02:44:47.206]  Double Patriot points.
[02:44:47.206 --> 02:44:47.566]  50% off.
[02:44:47.566 --> 02:44:49.247]  Storewide free shipping.
[02:44:49.247 --> 02:44:50.028]  It's about to end.
[02:44:50.028 --> 02:44:52.870]  We're running out of a lot of these products at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:44:52.870 --> 02:44:59.194]  And I need you to get in there, step to the plate, get high quality products you already need, and fund the information war.
[02:44:59.194 --> 02:44:59.894]  InfoWareStore.com!
[02:45:05.054 --> 02:45:10.798]  Globalism was doomed to fail if we just exposed it and then resisted it.
[02:45:10.798 --> 02:45:25.647]  Didn't I say a thousand times that there's no way you're gonna have an authoritarian corporate world government above the law that doesn't pay taxes, that has diplomatic immunity, that runs around saying it's communist and socialist, power to the people, but then meanwhile is tax-exempt again offshore?
[02:45:25.647 --> 02:45:26.728]  Well, Trump got that.
[02:45:27.308 --> 02:45:29.230]  And all these other populists get it.
[02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:38.257]  Why would you throw away wealthy, successful countries and cultures just so you can say the communist Chinese that David Rockefeller put in power are better than everybody?
[02:45:38.257 --> 02:45:41.119]  That is a sick, freakish joke!
[02:45:41.119 --> 02:45:44.902]  And I will not stand by and watch humanity turned over to these people.
[02:45:44.902 --> 02:45:51.207]  And I beg God for the strength and the will to have the discernment to help be part of their defeat!
[02:45:51.647 --> 02:45:56.612]  I've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and God is delivering because God is great!
[02:45:56.612 --> 02:45:58.975]  Thank God for his son, Jesus Christ!
[02:45:58.975 --> 02:46:01.537]  And now let's move forward against the NWO!
[02:46:15.956 --> 02:46:20.260]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:46:20.260 --> 02:46:23.763]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[02:46:23.763 --> 02:46:27.026]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:46:27.026 --> 02:46:30.569]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:46:30.569 --> 02:46:32.231]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:46:32.811 --> 02:46:34.892]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.
[02:46:34.892 --> 02:46:40.356]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:46:40.356 --> 02:46:48.841]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:46:48.841 --> 02:46:55.545]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:46:55.545 --> 02:46:58.367]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:47:08.082 --> 02:47:16.844]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.844 --> 02:47:19.964]  He never gives up.
[02:47:19.964 --> 02:47:20.524]  He's Alex Jones.
[02:47:20.524 --> 02:47:23.545]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[02:47:23.545 --> 02:47:24.165]  Worldwide.
[02:47:42.991 --> 02:47:45.351]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:45.351 --> 02:47:49.732]  You know, I was only going to have Lee Stranahan on for two segments, but he's just covering so much important stuff.
[02:47:49.732 --> 02:47:54.253]  And listen, I know, as listeners, you know the Ukraine thing's fake.
[02:47:54.253 --> 02:47:58.895]  And you know Obama went in there with Hillary and Biden and looted the living hell out of it.
[02:47:58.895 --> 02:48:02.215]  And they're on the CHICOM payroll, the Russian payroll.
[02:48:02.215 --> 02:48:04.376]  If the Easter Bunny was real, they'd be on its payroll.
[02:48:05.731 --> 02:48:06.452]  We know that.
[02:48:06.452 --> 02:48:09.554]  That's what globalists do is they sell out the nations they control.
[02:48:09.554 --> 02:48:10.875]  They're just corporate raiders.
[02:48:10.875 --> 02:48:13.136]  Like Mitt Romney was a corporate raider?
[02:48:13.136 --> 02:48:14.257]  Of course he wants to be president.
[02:48:14.257 --> 02:48:16.479]  He'd raid the country.
[02:48:16.479 --> 02:48:18.460]  Trump is a service guy.
[02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:20.521]  And he wants to see a prosperous nation.
[02:48:20.521 --> 02:48:27.406]  He really cares about the country and doesn't like seeing it run down the tubes by a bunch of people that have a religion of destroying America.
[02:48:27.406 --> 02:48:30.488]  America was never great and will never be that great.
[02:48:30.488 --> 02:48:35.052]  But Lee Stranahan, I should have just said up front, because I remember this interview we did a year ago.
[02:48:36.454 --> 02:48:41.556]  I know he played some clips here that he's never gotten to, and I'm glad he aired that here, but think about that.
[02:48:41.556 --> 02:48:46.819]  Because, you know, back then in the interview he did, that was just an average thought.
[02:48:46.819 --> 02:48:50.581]  Oh, getting mad about the Politico piece and Joe Biden and, you know, the president of...
[02:48:52.219 --> 02:48:53.819]  Ukraine calling up angry.
[02:48:53.819 --> 02:49:14.685]  But now, think in context how big that is, and the chutzpah, the bravado, the brass huevos, the confidence that Hillary and Biden have to be on TV and say, I fired that prosecutor, you know, I threatened to hold back a million dollars, quid pro quo, that's a crime right there.
[02:49:14.685 --> 02:49:16.066]  Then he, son of a bitch, got fired.
[02:49:16.066 --> 02:49:17.666]  That's a quote.
[02:49:17.666 --> 02:49:20.667]  How the hell are they carrying this out with a straight face?
[02:49:21.994 --> 02:49:27.242]  And they're now trying to impeach the president with it, and Lee Stranahan, what's the word?
[02:49:27.242 --> 02:49:27.923]  You're in D.C.
[02:49:27.923 --> 02:49:29.385]  I mean, you always amaze me, your sources.
[02:49:30.219 --> 02:49:32.280]  That's what we have on as folks that are right over and over again.
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:34.480]  You know, mainstream media is trying to lie, folks.
[02:49:34.480 --> 02:49:36.181]  We're like political weathermen.
[02:49:36.181 --> 02:49:39.782]  Weathermen want to tell you the answer, because when they're right, they're popular.
[02:49:39.782 --> 02:49:42.543]  Well, when we're right, we live in a free country.
[02:49:42.543 --> 02:49:51.025]  But we're wrong sometimes, but maybe 5% of the time, because we already kind of know where the globalists are going, so it's a lot easier to predict than the weather.
[02:49:51.025 --> 02:49:59.188]  So, what's the current thing on impeachment, Lee Stranahan, and what's the word on what's coming next as a political weatherman?
[02:50:00.598 --> 02:50:04.350]  Well, okay, so here's what I think the story is going to go immediately.
[02:50:05.137 --> 02:50:11.822]  I think you've got already the biggest disconnect I've ever seen between the people and the media.
[02:50:11.822 --> 02:50:13.783]  Everybody knows the media is lying to them.
[02:50:13.783 --> 02:50:22.470]  You've been doing this for decades, Alex, and you know that at first you were a conspiracy theorist and you were nuts, and when you went to Bohemian Grove that was crazy.
[02:50:22.470 --> 02:50:29.955]  Now Bohemian Grove has, you know, the Bilderberg Group has a website now where people can go up and see their own official website.
[02:50:29.955 --> 02:50:30.655]  Exactly.
[02:50:30.655 --> 02:50:33.998]  Okay, we're child molesters, we worship the devil, big deal, move along.
[02:50:34.963 --> 02:50:35.563]  That's right.
[02:50:35.563 --> 02:50:37.784]  And now we have a pretty website about it.
[02:50:37.784 --> 02:50:39.664]  So here's what's going on.
[02:50:39.664 --> 02:50:42.344]  The disconnect is unbelievable.
[02:50:42.344 --> 02:50:45.005]  This impeachment thing is going to blow up in their face.
[02:50:45.005 --> 02:50:47.626]  And I'll tell you two places this is going to go.
[02:50:47.626 --> 02:50:53.647]  Now, one of the things they've been trying to do, you talked about Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and the Russian angle.
[02:50:53.647 --> 02:50:56.087]  Let me talk about that for a second.
[02:50:56.087 --> 02:51:00.588]  I'm going to name somebody who nobody in the media ever talks about.
[02:51:00.588 --> 02:51:02.669]  He is a Russian oligarch.
[02:51:02.669 --> 02:51:04.669]  He was involved in money laundering.
[02:51:05.518 --> 02:51:08.799]  He was a criminal, convicted criminal.
[02:51:08.799 --> 02:51:14.262]  The CIA said he was involved in money laundering, but now the CIA are on his side.
[02:51:14.262 --> 02:51:19.484]  And he was supported, and I will say, everybody can look this up.
[02:51:19.484 --> 02:51:23.825]  There's nothing, no conjecture, and nobody's covered it, Alex.
[02:51:23.825 --> 02:51:31.308]  Now, so let's talk about, you know, you've been covering secret societies for a long time, and you know the way Bohemian Grove or Bilderberg works.
[02:51:31.308 --> 02:51:35.110]  You can see in the Bilderberg panel, you got Eric Schmidt and Peter Thiel,
[02:51:35.836 --> 02:51:41.099]  Two guys, one a Hillary supporter, one a Trump supporter, they're both on the same steering committee.
[02:51:41.099 --> 02:51:43.200]  Okay, so we get how that works.
[02:51:43.200 --> 02:51:54.465]  What if I told you they were a Russian oligarch, criminal oligarch, once the richest guy in Russia, who was supported by both presidential candidates in 2008?
[02:51:54.465 --> 02:51:59.027]  That guy's name is Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
[02:51:59.027 --> 02:51:59.868]  Khodorkovsky
[02:52:00.569 --> 02:52:01.570]  That's skull and bones.
[02:52:28.436 --> 02:52:29.857]  Senate Resolution 3.
[02:52:29.857 --> 02:52:31.437]  I'm not making this up.
[02:52:31.437 --> 02:52:33.097]  I've seen your reports on it.
[02:52:33.097 --> 02:52:34.658]  So here's the bottom line.
[02:52:34.658 --> 02:52:35.818]  Where is it going against Trump?
[02:52:35.818 --> 02:52:38.099]  I mean, I agree that it's super unpopular.
[02:52:38.099 --> 02:52:39.359]  It's making Trump more popular.
[02:52:39.359 --> 02:52:41.660]  But it's going to be unpopular if they blow his head off.
[02:52:41.660 --> 02:52:43.060]  They intend to remove him.
[02:52:43.060 --> 02:52:44.721]  I'm just saying gut level.
[02:52:44.721 --> 02:52:45.861]  I'm not saying they're going to remove him.
[02:52:46.943 --> 02:52:48.244]  No, I don't think they will.
[02:52:48.244 --> 02:52:50.124]  But look at 322.
[02:52:50.124 --> 02:52:55.767]  It supported one sponsor, Joe Biden, two co-sponsors, Obama and McCain.
[02:52:55.767 --> 02:52:58.128]  This is that Russian funding you're talking about.
[02:52:58.128 --> 02:52:59.509]  Isn't that incredible?
[02:52:59.509 --> 02:53:02.670]  There's Joe Biden with a bill to protect the oligarch.
[02:53:03.700 --> 02:53:04.961]  That's exactly right.
[02:53:04.961 --> 02:53:09.904]  And nobody in the media, you talk about chutzpah, nobody in the media is talking about this.
[02:53:09.904 --> 02:53:17.810]  Just McCain and Obama and Biden that were launching ISIS and Al Qaeda in the Middle East.
[02:53:17.810 --> 02:53:18.571]  That's right.
[02:53:18.571 --> 02:53:23.895]  But what you don't have, the difference Alex, is I just showed you, anybody can look this up.
[02:53:23.895 --> 02:53:26.016]  So this is where that disconnect comes in.
[02:53:26.016 --> 02:53:27.577]  Where's this going to go?
[02:53:27.577 --> 02:53:28.778]  Two things are going to happen.
[02:53:28.778 --> 02:53:30.859]  You're going to start hearing about Khodorkovsky.
[02:53:30.859 --> 02:53:31.640]  That's number one.
[02:53:33.730 --> 02:53:39.614]  Once the media tries to bury this, it's the most obvious thing in the world.
[02:53:39.614 --> 02:53:46.159]  This is the guy, and the reason I mention Khodorkovsky, his lawyer is a guy named Jonathan Weiner.
[02:53:46.159 --> 02:53:51.843]  Jonathan Weiner, Alex, is the guy who brought Christopher Steele into the State Department.
[02:53:51.843 --> 02:53:55.306]  Look up an article called, Devin Nunes is Investigating Me.
[02:53:55.886 --> 02:54:00.387]  Jonathan Weiner admits he's the guy who was being briefed in the Steele dossier.
[02:54:00.387 --> 02:54:01.708]  So when I say... Sure, sure.
[02:54:01.708 --> 02:54:06.949]  So they're crazy to try to cover up their Ukraine dealings by claiming Trump's doing bad.
[02:54:06.949 --> 02:54:14.492]  All that brings us more attention on them when at every level they have been implicated in massive crimes.
[02:54:14.492 --> 02:54:20.354]  How do they think they're going to try to have a trial about Trump on Ukraine when all that does is bring them up?
[02:54:20.354 --> 02:54:24.855]  It does sound like they think just because mainstream media is going to lockstep the
[02:54:24.875 --> 02:54:27.576]  Alex Jones is becoming passe out there in the climate.
[02:54:27.576 --> 02:54:29.936]  People don't believe a damn thing these people say.
[02:54:55.275 --> 02:54:55.955]  And they shouldn't.
[02:54:55.955 --> 02:55:08.739]  And when you can just look up on your cell phone, Senate Resolution 322, and see it's Biden as the co-sponsor, the only two co-sponsors, Biden's the sponsor, the only two co-sponsors are McCain and Obama.
[02:55:08.739 --> 02:55:09.319]  No, it's incredible.
[02:55:09.319 --> 02:55:10.180]  Listen, we're out of time.
[02:55:10.180 --> 02:55:12.420]  As soon as you get your Skype working, join us again.
[02:55:12.420 --> 02:55:16.322]  I want to get your take on the situation.
[02:55:16.322 --> 02:55:17.942]  We'll just roll fast to 60 seconds.
[02:55:17.942 --> 02:55:20.943]  What do you make of Turkey and the situation in Syria?
[02:55:22.529 --> 02:55:23.870]  I've been covering Syria a long time.
[02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:27.373]  I went over to Lebanon in 2013.
[02:55:27.373 --> 02:55:37.000]  I think it's very complex, but I think when Trump tries to remove troops as he's doing here, you notice everybody comes out against him.
[02:55:38.544 --> 02:55:51.615]  I'm not an Erdogan fan at all, and I think he is dangerous and does need to be contained, but as soon as Trump tries to pull troops, one other quick thing, Alex, if people, the other name people got to listen for is Alexandra Chalupa.
[02:55:51.615 --> 02:55:53.097]  They can't keep it under wraps.
[02:55:53.097 --> 02:55:56.640]  Nunes has talked about her, and I will just, if I can plug one thing.
[02:55:57.100 --> 02:55:58.181]  It's my Twitter feed.
[02:55:58.181 --> 02:56:00.722]  I got a Twitter at Stranahan.
[02:56:00.722 --> 02:56:02.142]  I've got a huge thread.
[02:56:02.142 --> 02:56:05.424]  If people want to get into the weeds on this, I make it very clear.
[02:56:05.424 --> 02:56:06.084]  No, I understand.
[02:56:06.084 --> 02:56:11.606]  And listen, your research and getting everybody else's research together is now the blueprint for Nunes, Trump, everybody.
[02:56:11.606 --> 02:56:12.707]  That's why we had you on.
[02:56:12.707 --> 02:56:13.487]  Congratulations.
[02:56:13.487 --> 02:56:15.348]  Keep kicking butt, brother.
[02:56:15.348 --> 02:56:18.549]  Yeah, will do, Alex, and love you anytime you need me.
[02:56:18.549 --> 02:56:19.369]  Thank you, sir.
[02:56:19.369 --> 02:56:23.011]  He just flashed up his Twitter with an image of the young Bill and Hillary.
[02:56:23.011 --> 02:56:23.991]  God help us.
[02:56:23.991 --> 02:56:25.112]  It's just, I literally...
[02:56:26.537 --> 02:56:28.038]  You'd have like a nightmare seeing that.
[02:56:28.038 --> 02:56:31.019]  I mean, I just thought, I hope we can defeat these people.
[02:56:31.019 --> 02:56:32.339]  I'm so sick of them.
[02:56:32.339 --> 02:56:33.860]  It's so obvious of the bad guys.
[02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:36.041]  It's so obvious Trump's the good guy.
[02:56:36.041 --> 02:56:37.681]  He's completely surrounded.
[02:56:37.681 --> 02:56:39.262]  We're surrounded.
[02:56:39.262 --> 02:56:44.244]  But we've got the truth on our side, and I've got you, this great audience of activists that have been so incredibly supportive.
[02:56:45.585 --> 02:56:48.227]  I meant to read this on air yesterday and I forgot.
[02:56:48.227 --> 02:56:52.710]  It's Cicero on the traitor and how that ties into the man of the arena.
[02:56:52.710 --> 02:57:01.477]  I'm going to reprint those or pull both those and I'm going to shoot a special report on that because that's so important that'll air one of the other shows today.
[02:57:01.477 --> 02:57:02.938]  Paul Watts is going to be taking over next.
[02:57:04.099 --> 02:57:11.104]  Next hour, and I'm not going to cut into his time because he is very, very informative and very, very popular.
[02:57:11.104 --> 02:57:18.729]  And Paul, despite the fact they banned him on Facebook, has not bowed to all the other pressure when they threatened to de-platform him if he doesn't turn to the dark side.
[02:57:18.729 --> 02:57:21.991]  We really appreciate Paul being steadfast.
[02:57:21.991 --> 02:57:24.273]  A lot of other people have not been steadfast, folks.
[02:57:24.273 --> 02:57:26.274]  The threats, the offers, the things that go on.
[02:57:26.274 --> 02:57:31.678]  A lot of people joined with Soran or with Darth Plagueis.
[02:57:32.648 --> 02:57:37.614]  Darth Plagueis is so wise.
[02:57:37.614 --> 02:57:38.895]  So wise you join the devil.
[02:57:38.895 --> 02:57:41.117]  That's not very wise at all.
[02:57:41.117 --> 02:57:41.978]  We'll be back, though.
[02:57:41.978 --> 02:57:44.621]  I'll do the first five minutes, then Paul Joseph Watts is ready to go.
[02:57:44.621 --> 02:57:46.824]  This is the last day for store-wide free shipping.
[02:57:46.824 --> 02:57:50.708]  50% off all the supplements, from preparing to silence a double-pagered punch.
[02:57:50.708 --> 02:57:51.649]  It's got to end today.
[02:57:51.649 --> 02:57:53.932]  As soon as I get off air, I'm going to get the new specials.
[02:57:54.452 --> 02:58:01.880]  There are few things in this universe that are a sure bet, but I'm here to tell you, the products at Infowarslife.com are.
[02:58:01.880 --> 02:58:15.155]  We go out, we find out what is the best rated, best tested, most loved, most documented substances that God gave us through Mother Nature, and then we make it even stronger, even better, and lower the price.
[02:58:15.675 --> 02:58:22.323]  Now, turmeric has been known for thousands of years to help with inflammation, headaches, it's good for the immune system, so many things.
[02:58:22.323 --> 02:58:24.105]  It sells itself.
[02:58:24.105 --> 02:58:33.036]  But, normal turmeric only has 3-5% curcuminoid, the active enzyme or system in the plant.
[02:58:33.036 --> 02:58:34.218]  Originally, obviously, from India.
[02:58:35.479 --> 02:58:47.082]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula has a 95% curcuminoid level, but it's got other natural things that help boost it, help your body absorb it, and that's why people absolutely love it.
[02:58:47.082 --> 02:58:50.443]  I'm doing this offer for people that haven't tried it yet.
[02:58:50.443 --> 02:58:52.244]  50% off on Body's at InfoWarsLife.com.

[02:59:20.223 --> 02:59:22.484]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:59:22.484 --> 02:59:23.885]  I suggest Band.Video.
[02:59:24.565 --> 02:59:30.010]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:59:30.010 --> 02:59:38.497]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:59:38.497 --> 02:59:46.364]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[02:59:46.364 --> 02:59:48.026]  Be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:59:57.544 --> 03:00:13.492]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:13.492 --> 03:00:19.756]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:26.014 --> 03:00:29.116]  We're good.
[03:00:45.825 --> 03:00:48.267]  Ladies and gentlemen, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:00:48.267 --> 03:00:50.669]  I just talked to him via Skype during the break.
[03:00:50.669 --> 03:00:56.834]  He's going to be covering how China has basically conquered America and is now taking over the world.
[03:00:56.834 --> 03:00:58.015]  That's really what's happening.
[03:00:58.015 --> 03:01:00.917]  We can pull back, but we have to admit what's happened.
[03:01:00.917 --> 03:01:08.523]  They just told Big Tech and everybody introduces us to QICOM Control and we just kind of roll over and accept it and die.
[03:01:08.523 --> 03:01:09.224]  And we'll look at
[03:01:10.134 --> 03:01:17.399]  The left financing all this nihilistic, end-of-the-world garbage, how it ties into the Joker movie, and so much more.
[03:01:17.399 --> 03:01:24.983]  Paul Watson has the articles up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, and don't forget Summit.News, his own excellent site.
[03:01:24.983 --> 03:01:27.365]  We're redesigning Infowars right now.
[03:01:27.365 --> 03:01:37.231]  As well, Professor Slams Extinction Rebellion as a carnival for middle classes who love to dress up as activists and act like they're saving the world.
[03:01:38.558 --> 03:01:40.598]  Now I mentioned this four or five times during the show.
[03:01:40.598 --> 03:01:41.459]  I didn't get to it.
[03:01:41.459 --> 03:01:42.459]  I should have led with it.
[03:01:42.459 --> 03:01:44.599]  This is Pat Robertson.
[03:01:44.599 --> 03:01:46.640]  Hated by the left.
[03:01:46.640 --> 03:01:47.440]  Demonized.
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:48.420]  He's been pro-life.
[03:01:48.420 --> 03:01:49.600]  He's done a lot of good stuff.
[03:01:49.600 --> 03:01:51.661]  I don't want to be enemies with Pat Robertson.
[03:01:51.661 --> 03:01:58.082]  But let me tell you, he looks like my grandmother two days before she died when I saw her.
[03:01:58.082 --> 03:02:00.682]  I mean, he's reading off a script that somebody else wrote.
[03:02:00.682 --> 03:02:04.663]  And it's kind of like when, uh, what was his name?
[03:02:04.663 --> 03:02:07.124]  Uh, Tarleton Heston, who I talked to a few times off air.
[03:02:07.124 --> 03:02:07.964]  He was on the show a few times.
[03:02:09.292 --> 03:02:16.414]  When they rolled him on national TV, Dateline NBC, to say he was against guns, the NRA, and he apologized, he died like two weeks later.
[03:02:16.414 --> 03:02:17.674]  I mean, his brain was gone.
[03:02:17.674 --> 03:02:18.434]  Alzheimer's.
[03:02:18.434 --> 03:02:21.835]  He could read off a script, he'd look at the script, and that was it.
[03:02:21.835 --> 03:02:25.115]  So I think that they're basically holding Orpat Robertson hostage.
[03:02:25.115 --> 03:02:32.277]  But here he is, quoting the Chinese communist who picked up on this famous Chinese emperor saying,
[03:02:34.082 --> 03:02:35.002]  Word for word.
[03:02:35.002 --> 03:02:35.963]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:02:35.963 --> 03:02:37.163]  Here it is.
[03:02:37.163 --> 03:02:52.007]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to say right now, I am absolutely appalled that the United States is going to betray those democratic forces in northern Syria, that we possibly are going to allow the Turks to come in against the Kurds.
[03:02:52.007 --> 03:02:54.708]  That Odo Erdogan is a thug.
[03:02:55.285 --> 03:02:59.568]  He has taken control of his country as a dictator.
[03:02:59.568 --> 03:03:06.093]  He is a strong leader, and to say he's an ally of America is nonsense.
[03:03:06.093 --> 03:03:08.294]  He is in for himself.
[03:03:08.294 --> 03:03:21.584]  And the president, who allowed Khashoggi to be cut in pieces without any repercussions whatsoever, is now allowing the Christians and the Kurds to be massacred by the Turks.
[03:03:22.404 --> 03:03:36.047]  And I believe, and I want to say this with great solemnity, the President of the United States is in danger of losing the Mandate of Heaven if he permits this to happen.
[03:03:36.047 --> 03:03:40.008]  Oh, Mandate of Heaven!
[03:03:40.008 --> 03:03:41.348]  Literally.
[03:03:41.348 --> 03:03:44.029]  We're not becoming Anglophiles like we did in the 20s in the U.S.
[03:03:44.029 --> 03:03:46.509]  It was fashionable to speak with British accents.
[03:03:46.509 --> 03:03:48.730]  We're becoming Communist Chinophiles.
[03:03:50.171 --> 03:03:51.492]  I mean, this is out of control.
[03:03:51.492 --> 03:03:53.813]  So he's clearly been reading off a teleprompter.
[03:03:53.813 --> 03:03:55.634]  Somebody loaded that in for him.
[03:03:55.634 --> 03:03:59.377]  Trump said it's time to bring the troops home.
[03:03:59.377 --> 03:04:05.400]  And then we learned from Joel Skousen, I looked it up, he's right, it's not 1,000 troops, it's not 100 troops, it's 24 troops.
[03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:08.482]  We still have troops there.
[03:04:08.482 --> 03:04:13.225]  Lindsey Graham, Nikki Haley, Meghan McCain, outraged that Trump removes 50 troops from northern Syria.
[03:04:13.225 --> 03:04:15.187]  The word is now it's half of that.
[03:04:15.187 --> 03:04:17.208]  These people are warmongering pigs.
[03:04:18.524 --> 03:04:25.429]  The left just wants to harvest babies' organs and teach living children how to perform sex acts.
[03:04:25.429 --> 03:04:28.511]  They're crazy scum.
[03:04:28.511 --> 03:04:29.892]  And they've signed on to the Chi-Coms.
[03:04:29.892 --> 03:04:30.732]  It's insane.
[03:04:30.732 --> 03:04:32.093]  So Paul Watson's taking over.
[03:04:32.093 --> 03:04:35.315]  Then, in 55 minutes, the war room with Owen Schreier!
[03:04:35.315 --> 03:04:36.296]  And then firepower!
[03:04:37.176 --> 03:04:40.937]  With Will Johnson and Tom Papert and more.
[03:04:40.937 --> 03:04:42.458]  We told you we're expanding broadcasting here.
[03:04:42.458 --> 03:04:44.299]  We're doing it thanks to your support.
[03:04:44.299 --> 03:04:45.599]  So please, spread the word.
[03:04:45.599 --> 03:04:48.640]  Your power to spread the word about Band.Video.
[03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:51.101]  Your power to spread the word about the live radio show.
[03:04:51.101 --> 03:04:53.582]  And Infowars.com forward slash show is incredible.
[03:04:53.582 --> 03:04:54.683]  And you've been doing it?
[03:04:54.683 --> 03:05:00.385]  So Band.Video and Infowars.com forward slash show, the visits are growing exponentially every week.
[03:05:02.938 --> 03:05:05.720]  Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish.
[03:05:05.720 --> 03:05:07.661]  They think the West is dead.
[03:05:07.661 --> 03:05:11.244]  They think if they censor nationalists and patriots off the internet, you'll just forget about us.
[03:05:11.244 --> 03:05:13.065]  And then they'll be the only information out there.
[03:05:13.065 --> 03:05:15.607]  Well, so far, that's not been working too well for them.
[03:05:15.607 --> 03:05:22.471]  Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly that the resistance to globalism is alive and well at Banned.Video.
[03:05:22.471 --> 03:05:23.592]  And now we've added a lot of
[03:05:23.612 --> 03:05:24.012]  I think so.
[03:05:47.073 --> 03:05:58.103]  The power of America, the power of freedom, the power to build a better world and stand in the face of the censors and the tyrants is alive and stronger than ever at Banned.Video.
[03:05:58.103 --> 03:06:01.266]  But it's up to you to unleash its full potential.
[03:06:01.266 --> 03:06:02.006]  Banned.Video.
[03:06:30.384 --> 03:06:32.967]  We are live on the fourth hour of the show.
[03:06:32.967 --> 03:06:39.213]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to play why the boat establishment hates Joker.
[03:06:39.213 --> 03:06:45.939]  The frothing outrage in response to this film still continues to dominate four or five days after it was released.
[03:06:45.939 --> 03:06:51.505]  So we're going to play that video, which I just put up on InfoWars.com about an hour ago.
[03:06:51.505 --> 03:06:53.327]  Meanwhile, as I tweeted,
[03:06:54.321 --> 03:07:12.903]  All across America, the very same corporations that relentlessly virtue signal about how much they support minorities and LGBT domestically are grovelling and cowering to China, one of the most abusive nations towards minorities and LGBT on the planet.
[03:07:13.618 --> 03:07:17.181]  They literally put Muslims in concentration camps.
[03:07:17.181 --> 03:07:19.583]  It's all a giant scam.
[03:07:19.583 --> 03:07:22.305]  We have to get lectured about how offensive we are.
[03:07:22.305 --> 03:07:37.398]  Meanwhile, China, the most abusive, one of the most abusive, at least, anti-human rights regimes on the planet, not only gets a free pass, but basically gets to conquer and take over America through the media, through the sports entertainment industry.
[03:07:37.398 --> 03:07:42.482]  And if you spent the last year arguing for big tech to censor people you don't like,
[03:07:43.280 --> 03:07:52.603]  You have no right to criticise China for censoring South Park or the NBA because you're literally as bad as them and that's literally what they've done.
[03:07:52.603 --> 03:07:56.784]  They've yanked all the NBA broadcasts off their networks.
[03:07:56.784 --> 03:08:00.045]  They've yanked all the South Park episodes off their networks.
[03:08:00.045 --> 03:08:11.449]  They've even gone into South Park forums and wiped them off the internet because South Park dared to make fun of China in the last episode because this NBA coach
[03:08:12.105 --> 03:08:16.806]  Dared to express support for pro-democracy protesters in Ukraine.
[03:08:16.806 --> 03:08:21.087]  And the reaction has been vehement, to say the least, from China.
[03:08:21.087 --> 03:08:31.269]  The reaction from corporate America has been to genuflect, bow down, grovel and apologize because their proclaimed wokeness is a complete scam.
[03:08:31.269 --> 03:08:32.269]  It's fairy dust.
[03:08:32.269 --> 03:08:34.449]  Headline out of Breitbart.
[03:08:34.449 --> 03:08:37.710]  NBA's woke warriors silent on human rights abuses in China.
[03:08:38.638 --> 03:08:52.448]  The National Basketball Association considers itself one of the most progressive organisations in America and is always ready to criticise President Donald Trump or other Americans who are members of the league think are not woke enough.
[03:08:52.448 --> 03:08:56.411]  But this weekend's apology to China, and they did apologise.
[03:08:56.411 --> 03:09:00.333]  There are stories claiming they didn't apologise and they're going to refuse to apologise.
[03:09:00.333 --> 03:09:03.836]  Yes, they did on two separate occasions over the weekend.
[03:09:04.793 --> 03:09:11.077]  Shows that the NBA is quick to attack Americans while turning a blind eye to China's serious human rights abuses.
[03:09:11.077 --> 03:09:21.183]  Over the weekend, the NBA rebuked Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, who tweeted his support of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong.
[03:09:21.183 --> 03:09:29.248]  Which, by the way, the administrative leader of Hong Kong has now basically said that they're about to send in the Chinese troops, so that's going to get very fruity in a heartbeat.
[03:09:30.106 --> 03:09:36.409]  The League apologised to the oppressive Chinese government for Maury's support of the democracy activists.
[03:09:36.409 --> 03:09:41.772]  But according to a recent report, Human Rights Watch, China is still one of the worst abusers of human rights in the world.
[03:09:41.772 --> 03:09:56.740]  In its 2018 report, the organisation reported China has, quote, dramatically stepped up repression and systematic abuses against the 13 million Turkic Muslims, including Uighurs and ethnic Kazakhs, in China's north-western Xinjiang region.
[03:09:57.819 --> 03:10:04.440]  And of course in China, in Hong Kong, they're now talking about shutting down the internet to shut down these protests.
[03:10:04.440 --> 03:10:06.501]  That is their go-to method.
[03:10:06.501 --> 03:10:09.401]  Every step of the way is censorship.
[03:10:09.401 --> 03:10:17.042]  And now because big tech and corporate America has aligned itself with that agenda, they censor just as flagrantly as China does now.
[03:10:17.042 --> 03:10:21.183]  They're backing down in a heartbeat.
[03:10:21.183 --> 03:10:25.664]  China warns brands to accept communism, freedom of speech ridiculous.
[03:10:26.437 --> 03:10:44.919]  They put this out in their official Global Times Communist Party mouthpiece, warning global brands, that's corporate America, to make their members speak cautiously on Chinese political issues Monday in response to an ongoing controversy following an NBA executive lending support pro-democracy protest in Hong Kong.
[03:10:46.129 --> 03:10:52.899]  Following condemnation from the Communist Party and its puppets in Chinese society, the NBA issued a statement condemning Maury.
[03:10:52.899 --> 03:10:58.627]  Yes, they did do that, despite the mainstream media in America today claiming they never apologized.
[03:10:58.627 --> 03:11:00.110]  They did on two separate occasions.
[03:11:01.181 --> 03:11:18.838]  But now in an article published Monday titled, Global Brands Better Stay Away From Politics, this is the Chinese government lecturing corporate America on controlling people's freedom of speech, what they're allowed to say, what they're not allowed to say, and they backed down in a heartbeat.
[03:11:18.838 --> 03:11:22.542]  The Global Times article warned Americans and international actors
[03:11:23.522 --> 03:11:31.787]  The Chinese authoritarian speech restrictions now apply worldwide and any protests in the name of free speech are, quote, ridiculous.
[03:11:31.787 --> 03:11:33.688]  China says jump.
[03:11:33.688 --> 03:11:37.190]  Corporate America says how high.
[03:11:37.190 --> 03:11:41.553]  The only people who didn't back down, of course, were the creators of South Park.
[03:11:41.553 --> 03:11:44.234]  But then we have corporations like Apple.
[03:11:44.234 --> 03:11:48.017]  Headline, Apple bows to China by censoring Taiwan flag emoji.
[03:11:48.017 --> 03:11:51.979]  In a recent update to its iOS, Apple's iPhone operating system,
[03:11:52.990 --> 03:12:01.077]  Apple removed the Taiwanese flag emoji from its keyboard for users in Hong Kong and Macau, China's two special administrative regions.
[03:12:01.077 --> 03:12:06.262]  Oh, the horror of somebody being able to send a Taiwanese flag emoji to their friend.
[03:12:06.262 --> 03:12:08.504]  We have to shut that down!
[03:12:08.504 --> 03:12:16.431]  Imagine how insecure you have to be to delete a flag of a country from an iOS update.
[03:12:16.431 --> 03:12:18.573]  Is that going to cause unrest?
[03:12:18.573 --> 03:12:19.314]  Or is the fact that
[03:12:20.569 --> 03:12:22.511]  You know, troops are about to roll into Hong Kong.
[03:12:22.511 --> 03:12:25.273]  You've got riot police literally shooting people in the chest.
[03:12:25.273 --> 03:12:28.476]  Maybe that's more likely to cause unrest.
[03:12:28.476 --> 03:12:32.839]  Apple makes no mention of the change in its release notes for iOS 13.11.
[03:12:32.839 --> 03:12:40.666]  The company did not immediately reply to Quartz's inquiry about whether the Chinese government requested censorship of the Taiwanese flag.
[03:12:40.666 --> 03:12:45.050]  Taiwan is in an independently run democracy, so far.
[03:12:45.050 --> 03:12:46.971]  So Apple caved in.
[03:12:46.971 --> 03:12:48.713]  Tiffany caved in.
[03:12:49.611 --> 03:12:53.214]  Headline, Tiffany removes advert over Hong Kong controversy.
[03:12:53.214 --> 03:13:01.439]  Tiffany and co removed a tweet showing a woman covering one eye after Chinese consumers accused the jeweler of supporting the Hong Kong protesters.
[03:13:01.439 --> 03:13:07.384]  Of course, that one eye symbol is because they shot a woman in the eye early on in the protest.
[03:13:07.384 --> 03:13:08.344]  She lost her eye.
[03:13:08.344 --> 03:13:10.426]  So then that became a symbol of the movement.
[03:13:11.015 --> 03:13:17.520]  The photo posted on Monday showed Chinese model's son, Fei Fei, wearing a Tiffany ring on her right hand as it covers her right eye.
[03:13:17.520 --> 03:13:19.421]  It wasn't even deliberate, probably.
[03:13:19.421 --> 03:13:21.923]  And yet, Tiffany and co.
[03:13:21.923 --> 03:13:23.825]  backed down immediately.
[03:13:23.825 --> 03:13:25.646]  Guess who else backed down?
[03:13:25.646 --> 03:13:28.468]  Vans sneakers!
[03:13:28.468 --> 03:13:30.250]  China's just conquering everything at this point.
[03:13:30.250 --> 03:13:35.033]  They're all being steamrolled into submission, into apology.
[03:13:35.033 --> 03:13:38.116]  Vans faces Hong Kong boycott over sneaker design controversy.
[03:13:39.665 --> 03:13:40.986]  Report CNN.
[03:13:40.986 --> 03:13:50.634]  Skateboarding brand Vans is facing a boycott in Hong Kong after it removed a shoe, alluding to the city's anti-government protest from a Sika design competition.
[03:13:50.634 --> 03:14:01.983]  So they had a competition for somebody to design a shoe, and then somebody put some characters on this shoe that looked vaguely like the Hong Kong protesters, and that had to go.
[03:14:01.983 --> 03:14:04.565]  It can't even be represented.
[03:14:04.565 --> 03:14:06.707]  Again, this is another form of deplatforming.
[03:14:06.707 --> 03:14:09.009]  Their likeness can't even be represented.
[03:14:10.086 --> 03:14:25.739]  In corporate America, or indeed in this case in Hong Kong, the company's decision to withdraw the proposed design was met with outrage on social media, where users began uploading videos and photos of themselves throwing their van sneakers in the trash and setting them on fire.
[03:14:25.739 --> 03:14:26.740]  So they've backed down.
[03:14:27.847 --> 03:14:33.589]  Tiffany backed down, Apple backed down, the NBA backed down and apologised and grovelled.
[03:14:33.589 --> 03:14:41.032]  The only people who haven't backed down to this conquering of corporate America by the Chinese are the creators of South Park.
[03:14:41.032 --> 03:14:46.854]  South Park creators offer sarcastic apology after China bans episode We Good Now China.
[03:14:46.854 --> 03:14:54.436]  The creators of South Park sarcastically acknowledged Monday the Chinese government's decision to ban clips, episodes and online discussions.
[03:14:54.436 --> 03:14:56.637]  They deleted entire internet forums
[03:14:57.495 --> 03:15:00.547]  But the animated show after an episode critical of the country!
[03:15:01.249 --> 03:15:15.414]  The episode Banned in China, which was then Banned in China, which originally aired last Wednesday, satirizes the entertainment and sports industry's willingness to abide by Chinese censors in order to corner its business market.
[03:15:15.414 --> 03:15:22.717]  And look what happened in the days, the week since that South Park episode has aired.
[03:15:22.717 --> 03:15:24.978]  Apple removing a Taiwanese flag.
[03:15:24.978 --> 03:15:28.639]  Tiffany and Company removing a tweet because it shows a woman covering one eye.
[03:15:29.239 --> 03:15:43.546]  Vans withdrawing sneakers from a design competition because they show a likeness of the Hong Kong protesters, and of course the NBA groveling and apologizing in an attempt to get its broadcasts back on Chinese television.
[03:15:43.546 --> 03:15:46.768]  China says jump, corporate America says how high.
[03:15:46.768 --> 03:15:50.390]  They censor people domestically, so why not kowtow?
[03:15:50.390 --> 03:15:54.632]  Why not cowardly genuflect to the communist Chinese authoritarians?
[03:15:55.313 --> 03:15:58.520]  When they give them their orders, we'll be back.
[03:15:58.520 --> 03:15:59.041]  Don't go away.
[03:16:02.079 --> 03:16:03.320]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:03.320 --> 03:16:07.242]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:07.242 --> 03:16:08.783]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:08.783 --> 03:16:11.725]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:11.725 --> 03:16:17.288]  I wrote the book on tax debt suppression, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:17.288 --> 03:16:18.308]  I can help you too.
[03:16:18.308 --> 03:16:21.410]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:21.410 --> 03:16:24.272]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:24.272 --> 03:16:28.094]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:28.094 --> 03:16:31.016]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:31.576 --> 03:16:37.940]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:37.940 --> 03:16:40.982]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:40.982 --> 03:16:46.906]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:46.906 --> 03:16:50.689]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:50.689 --> 03:16:51.970]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:51.970 --> 03:16:53.311]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:53.311 --> 03:16:59.515]  The deep state began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:59.515 --> 03:17:00.936]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:17:01.656 --> 03:17:04.637]  Happies is a tincture that you take under the tongue.

[03:18:03.826 --> 03:18:10.029]  We are working with Silicon Valley to make you behave yourself.
[03:18:10.029 --> 03:18:18.412]  Once we have full control, we send you to re-education camp like we do our people when they talk back to the party.
[03:18:18.412 --> 03:18:23.535]  Whatever you do, do not visit Band.Video.
[03:18:23.535 --> 03:18:30.998]  Band.Video is evil Americans whom Silicon Valley is teaching to shut up like China do.
[03:18:34.312 --> 03:18:35.493]  Hey!
[03:18:35.493 --> 03:18:38.656]  I told you, don't go to Bandot Video!
[03:18:38.656 --> 03:18:39.957]  I'm watching you!
[03:18:39.957 --> 03:18:41.358]  Haha!
[03:18:41.358 --> 03:18:43.980]  Our system has been adopted worldwide!
[03:18:43.980 --> 03:18:47.063]  Soon, we will kill you if you don't do what we say!
[03:18:47.063 --> 03:18:50.205]  Haha!
[03:18:50.205 --> 03:18:53.988]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[03:18:53.988 --> 03:18:59.353]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandot Video or I have to hurt you!
[03:19:02.850 --> 03:19:04.691]  Do you feel that my style is wrong?
[03:19:04.691 --> 03:19:05.971]  Or my substance is wrong?
[03:19:05.971 --> 03:19:07.332]  Trying to fact-check the president.
[03:19:07.332 --> 03:19:19.416]  The deceptive, humpty-dumpty troll known as Ryan Stelter and his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy, have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and to censor us.
[03:19:19.416 --> 03:19:23.317]  And of course he famously said, along with many others, that Trump is the Infowars president.
[03:19:23.317 --> 03:19:25.898]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action.
[03:19:26.238 --> 03:19:30.979]  Showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the InfoWars president.
[03:19:30.979 --> 03:19:31.519]  And you know what?
[03:19:31.519 --> 03:19:32.479]  It's true.
[03:19:32.479 --> 03:19:40.761]  Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew, and my drive and your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists of power around the world.
[03:19:40.761 --> 03:19:46.702]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their unelected anti-human tyrannies.
[03:19:46.702 --> 03:19:50.963]  So this is a day of great victory and I salute you all, but now in the thick of the fight,
[03:19:51.463 --> 03:19:54.365]  So, Infowarsstore.com for products you need.
[03:19:54.365 --> 03:20:06.475]  Massive sales now, so we can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end, until we've defeated them!
[03:20:06.475 --> 03:20:09.137]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:24.162 --> 03:20:25.303]  Big Brother.
[03:20:25.303 --> 03:20:27.105]  Mainstream media.
[03:20:27.105 --> 03:20:28.987]  Government cover-ups.
[03:20:28.987 --> 03:20:30.708]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:20:30.708 --> 03:20:32.350]  Well, so does he.
[03:20:32.350 --> 03:20:37.055]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:38.905 --> 03:20:52.529]  We are back, live on the show, fourth hour, and we're gonna go in the next segment to that new video which went up a couple of hours ago, Why the Woke Establishment Hates the Joker Movie, a key video for you to get out and share.
[03:20:52.529 --> 03:21:05.712]  For the time being though, speculation about whether Hillary Clinton, yes Hillary Clinton, will run for a third time as president continues to rage, and in fact about 15 minutes ago,
[03:21:06.815 --> 03:21:09.579]  She responded to Donald Trump's tweet from earlier today.
[03:21:09.579 --> 03:21:10.741]  Of course, Trump said, quote,
[03:21:17.108 --> 03:21:27.776]  Only one condition, the crooked one, must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors, including how and why she deleted 33,000 emails after getting C subpoena.
[03:21:27.776 --> 03:21:35.261]  Hillary Clinton responded to that on Twitter about 15 minutes ago, said, don't tempt me, do your job.
[03:21:35.261 --> 03:21:43.687]  And then the initial responses I'm reading to this are Trump supporters begging Hillary Clinton to run, just as Trump wants her to run.
[03:21:43.687 --> 03:21:44.188]  Meanwhile,
[03:21:46.013 --> 03:21:50.697]  Hillary jumps to third place on Predict It as rumours of 2020 run swirl.
[03:21:50.697 --> 03:22:01.065]  Is the Democratic field that weak and that pathetic that Hillary Clinton could actually have a chance of winning, having failed twice previously?
[03:22:01.065 --> 03:22:05.528]  She's now jumped to third place behind Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden on Predict It.
[03:22:05.528 --> 03:22:14.495]  As rumours of her entering the race for a 2020 presidential run continue to build, Clinton is enjoying a bounce due to the fact that all the rest of them are even more pathetic than her.
[03:22:15.805 --> 03:22:25.432]  Because of scandals surrounding Biden's profiteering in Ukraine and claims Warren lied about being fired from a teaching job for being visibly pregnant, we now know that was almost certainly not the case.
[03:22:25.432 --> 03:22:30.076]  Yet another complete fabrication from her, just like her ancestry.
[03:22:30.076 --> 03:22:36.741]  The odds of Hillary becoming 2020 Democratic nominee amongst a poor field of candidates are also at the highest in months.
[03:22:36.741 --> 03:22:44.967]  You can see there on the graph from Predict It, basically going parabolic over the last day or so, odds of Hillary Clinton as 2020 Democratic nominee.
[03:22:47.074 --> 03:22:51.078]  A Rasmussen poll has Trump and Hillary running neck and neck in a hypothetical rematch.
[03:22:51.078 --> 03:22:57.164]  And then as we highlighted last week, she appeared on this Stephen Colbert show with her daughter.
[03:22:57.164 --> 03:23:00.567]  And she was asked if she would endorse any of the Democratic candidates.
[03:23:00.567 --> 03:23:07.534]  She said she refused to endorse any of them, fueling speculation she may yet enter the race.
[03:23:07.534 --> 03:23:11.518]  And then Steve Bannon went on Fox Business Network last week also and said,
[03:23:12.961 --> 03:23:15.802]  Clinton was trying to find a way to wedge herself into the race.
[03:23:15.802 --> 03:23:17.702]  He said, they think they have a weak field in there.
[03:23:17.702 --> 03:23:19.282]  It's like in chess.
[03:23:19.282 --> 03:23:22.603]  They're prepared to get sacrificed a rook to take down a king.
[03:23:22.603 --> 03:23:29.724]  They will throw Biden away to get to Trump and hope Elizabeth or I think even Hillary Clinton or Bloomberg or some centrist comes in here.
[03:23:29.724 --> 03:23:31.924]  She is running, said Bannon.
[03:23:31.924 --> 03:23:35.645]  She's just trying to decide how to fit her way in.
[03:23:35.645 --> 03:23:40.386]  And now she literally tweeted, at Donald Trump, don't tempt me.
[03:23:41.129 --> 03:23:55.177]  Could we have the absolute joy, the meme explosion of having Hillary Clinton, crooked Hillary, run for a third time and to fail as a third time presidential contender?
[03:23:55.177 --> 03:24:01.660]  It would be extremely hilarious to say the least and the memes would be off the charts.
[03:24:01.660 --> 03:24:09.925]  Meanwhile in Hong Kong, we talked about all these giant corporations who again, virtue signal all day about how woke they are.
[03:24:10.572 --> 03:24:22.222]  How much they pander to LGBT and minorities while literally groveling and begging to China, one of the biggest abusers of LGBT people and minorities on the planet.
[03:24:22.222 --> 03:24:28.047]  Now Chinese army ready to step in against rioters, Hong Kong's Carrie Lam warns for first time.
[03:24:28.047 --> 03:24:34.893]  Following a renewed surge in protests, unrest and violence in the wake of the controversial mask ban, which basically had no effect.
[03:24:34.893 --> 03:24:36.515]  The militants are still out on the streets.
[03:24:37.358 --> 03:24:47.705]  Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has for the first time issued public warning that the Chinese military could step in, saying this drastic step would only happen if it becomes so bad.
[03:24:47.705 --> 03:24:51.948]  Expressing hope it won't come to that, the situation will resolve itself under local authorities.
[03:24:51.948 --> 03:24:58.973]  She noted that the four-month-long raging protests were no longer a peaceful movement for democracy and urged outside critics to understand this.
[03:24:58.973 --> 03:25:01.414]  She's saying no options could be ruled out.
[03:25:01.414 --> 03:25:02.235]  We know now there are
[03:25:03.024 --> 03:25:09.089]  Three times the amount of Chinese troops in Hong Kong as there were just a few months ago.
[03:25:09.089 --> 03:25:18.496]  They did that bait and switch where they had the rotation of troops when they were actually bringing thousands and thousands of more troops into the area.
[03:25:18.496 --> 03:25:22.359]  And then of course we had this story which was up on Drudge yesterday.
[03:25:22.359 --> 03:25:26.202]  Hong Kong government considering internet ban to stop protests.
[03:25:27.498 --> 03:25:34.723]  That was the Executive Council of the local government, Ip Kwok Him, who said they wouldn't rule out an internet ban in the future.
[03:25:34.723 --> 03:25:50.733]  The reason that's important is because whenever there are mass riots or civil unrest in these areas of China where they have large minority populations who are being oppressed and literally put in concentration camps and re-education camps,
[03:25:51.764 --> 03:25:57.788]  Their first response, the Chinese government authorities, is always to block, ban and censor the internet.
[03:25:57.788 --> 03:26:04.712]  And hey, if it's good enough for Apple and YouTube and Twitter and Facebook, why not?
[03:26:04.712 --> 03:26:07.894]  So that's what they always do to try and quell unrest.
[03:26:07.894 --> 03:26:16.900]  Whether that's going to work in Hong Kong, a far more technologically advanced region than somewhere like Tibet, where they normally do it, remains to be seen.
[03:26:16.900 --> 03:26:20.522]  But now they're talking about sending in the troops.
[03:26:21.525 --> 03:26:29.648]  Meanwhile in Europe, Germany, Syrian migrant shouting Allah plows truck into traffic, nine injured.
[03:26:29.648 --> 03:26:34.811]  This is an absolute miracle that he plowed the truck into other cars and not people.
[03:26:34.811 --> 03:26:40.333]  It was in the city of Limburg, I guess because this attack happened last night.
[03:26:40.333 --> 03:26:49.717]  There weren't many pedestrians out walking around, so he just decided to plow it into a bunch of other cars, which probably in a roundabout way is for the better because nobody died.
[03:26:51.255 --> 03:26:57.039]  A Syrian migrant shouting in Arabic about Allah plowed a truck into traffic in the German city of Olymburg, injuring nine people.
[03:26:57.039 --> 03:26:59.100]  They're treating it as a terrorist attack.
[03:26:59.100 --> 03:27:06.185]  The suspect dragged the driver of a white Mercedes truck from his vehicle before accelerating into other cars at a traffic light.
[03:27:06.185 --> 03:27:09.967]  Witnesses said he said Allah several times and spoke Arabic.
[03:27:09.967 --> 03:27:10.488]  Now, of course,
[03:27:11.741 --> 03:27:16.625]  Angela Merkel opened Germany's borders to mass migration back in 2015.
[03:27:16.625 --> 03:27:23.269]  Around 1.5 to 2 million refugees, many of them from Syria, flooded into the country.
[03:27:23.269 --> 03:27:28.473]  Many of those refugees were subsequently involved in terrorist attacks.
[03:27:28.473 --> 03:27:36.258]  We also know that the Paris massacre culprits used fake passports posed as Syrian refugees to get into France.
[03:27:36.258 --> 03:27:41.262]  The deadlier 2016 truck attack, you probably remember that, at a Christmas market in Berlin,
[03:27:42.068 --> 03:27:49.054]  Which killed 12 people and injured 56 others, was carried out by a failed Tunisian asylum seeker.
[03:27:49.054 --> 03:27:51.736]  And then last week, of course, we had another attack.
[03:27:51.736 --> 03:28:02.004]  It seemed that these ISIS-inspired terror attacks were starting to die down over the past year or so, but now we've had apparently two in the space of a week.
[03:28:02.699 --> 03:28:13.167]  Because last week a knife man who had converted to Islam and had been radicalised by ISIS propaganda killed four people in a terrorist attack on a police station in Paris, France again.
[03:28:14.173 --> 03:28:31.085]  That was somebody who had converted to Islam about 18 months ago, once again proving that Islam is not a race, it's a belief system, so we seem to have an uptick in terrorist attacks occurring throughout Europe and that's very bad news indeed.
[03:28:31.085 --> 03:28:36.649]  I'm going to come back and talk about the Extinction Rebellion
[03:28:37.344 --> 03:28:50.388]  The streets of London and other major cities brought to a standstill, and what a top professor is saying about the true motivations behind these well-dressed, middle-class performing activists.
[03:28:50.388 --> 03:28:53.329]  This is the Alex Jones Show live breaking news at Summit.
[03:28:53.329 --> 03:28:56.970]  Dot News, don't go away, we'll be back in two minutes.
[03:29:02.216 --> 03:29:04.178]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:29:04.178 --> 03:29:09.503]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:29:09.503 --> 03:29:11.085]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:11.085 --> 03:29:19.433]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:19.433 --> 03:29:25.139]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:25.299 --> 03:29:27.120]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:27.120 --> 03:29:29.400]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:29.400 --> 03:29:33.782]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:33.782 --> 03:29:35.962]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:29:35.962 --> 03:29:43.825]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:32:03.016 --> 03:32:07.437]  My friends, I've seen a lot of Donald Trump, just like you have.
[03:32:07.437 --> 03:32:20.120]  And my goodness, yesterday's press conference, when they came in on him with all their garbage, the foreign reporters, the US reporters, these little political sellouts, these whores, he just tore them to bits.
[03:32:20.640 --> 03:32:22.361]  And it's one thing to hear it if you're a radio listener.
[03:32:22.361 --> 03:32:22.901]  It's powerful.
[03:32:22.901 --> 03:32:26.202]  But if you see it, it's all at Band.Video.
[03:32:26.202 --> 03:32:28.423]  We've got the full press conference.
[03:32:28.423 --> 03:32:31.065]  We've got my boil down of how epic it is.
[03:32:31.065 --> 03:32:32.425]  It's all at Band.Video.
[03:32:32.425 --> 03:32:37.287]  And you've got to share this with people because Trump was hitting on all 45 cylinders.
[03:32:37.287 --> 03:32:38.268]  This was amazing.
[03:32:38.268 --> 03:32:40.789]  And he turned the nitrous oxide on top of it.
[03:32:40.789 --> 03:32:44.871]  So InfoWars, America, Trump, all of us, incredible things are happening.
[03:32:44.871 --> 03:32:49.633]  And we're sharing the ideas that are going to defeat the tyrants at Band.Video.
[03:32:50.473 --> 03:32:56.615]  And I gotta tell you, we've done great video work, we've done great films, we've done so much, but websites are not our thing.
[03:32:56.615 --> 03:32:57.575]  Well, now they are!
[03:32:57.575 --> 03:32:59.416]  I'm so proud of Bandai Video, folks.
[03:32:59.416 --> 03:33:05.838]  Check it out, there's a lot of new features at Bandai Video.
[03:33:05.838 --> 03:33:08.499]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:32.699 --> 03:33:34.983]  You're live on the fourth hour of the show.
[03:33:34.983 --> 03:33:38.089]  Without further ado, we're gonna go straight to this video which is up on YouTube.
[03:33:38.089 --> 03:33:39.271]  Get it, get it out there.
[03:33:39.271 --> 03:33:43.819]  It is Why the Woke Establishment Hates Joker.
[03:33:43.819 --> 03:33:44.240]  Here it is.
[03:33:49.133 --> 03:33:55.016]  Joker was undoubtedly one of the most authentic, watershed cultural moments of the last ten years.
[03:33:55.016 --> 03:34:02.119]  Which, given how saturated and vapid banality our culture has become, those moments are few and far between.
[03:34:02.119 --> 03:34:09.302]  There are very few movies that stay with you, but Joker's claustrophobic nihilism clings on like nothing else.
[03:34:09.302 --> 03:34:11.903]  But how do we know for sure that it was so good?
[03:34:12.583 --> 03:34:14.985]  Because all the right people hated it!
[03:34:14.985 --> 03:34:17.548]  The Guardian, Slate, The Wall Street Journal.
[03:34:17.548 --> 03:34:24.474]  This Guardian Easter implored people to ditch Joker and instead see a movie that was literally about how to become an incel.
[03:34:24.474 --> 03:34:31.501]  Before the movie's release, we were bombarded with relentless hysteria about how it was going to cause mass shootings, how it was...
[03:34:32.081 --> 03:34:36.646]  Irresponsible, how we needed cops at theatres to keep us safe.
[03:34:36.646 --> 03:34:40.069]  Why was the establishment so afraid of this movie?
[03:34:40.069 --> 03:34:43.813]  Why did they try to actively discourage people from seeing it?
[03:34:43.813 --> 03:34:51.841]  Because Joker points a finger at the true reason why our society produces the diseased minds responsible for mass shootings.
[03:34:51.841 --> 03:34:55.785]  Because our entire culture is bathed in atomising consumerists.
[03:34:55.905 --> 03:34:58.486]  Celebrity at all costs nihilism.
[03:34:58.486 --> 03:35:06.368]  Because the way we've been brainwashed into living and consuming creates a breeding ground for loneliness, despair and mental illness.
[03:35:06.368 --> 03:35:15.310]  Because we've been taught that people who think differently are a danger to society and that they must be ostracised, bullied and censored into silence.
[03:35:15.310 --> 03:35:21.632]  Because we've castigated an entire generation of young men that they're worthless incels who deserve nothing but contempt.
[03:35:21.852 --> 03:35:23.874]  Who's responsible for all that?
[03:35:23.874 --> 03:35:25.035]  The media.
[03:35:25.035 --> 03:35:26.217]  Silicon Valley.
[03:35:26.217 --> 03:35:28.799]  Puritanical, woke, outrage mobs.
[03:35:28.799 --> 03:35:37.969]  The movie holds up a mirror to how a society that humiliates, shames and disenfranchises people is itself responsible for generating violence.
[03:35:38.169 --> 03:35:45.812]  Joker's murder of the talk show host is literally motivated by him being humiliated and cancelled cultured by the media.
[03:35:45.812 --> 03:35:53.374]  So is it any wonder that the same forces responsible for doing exactly that in our society hate this movie?
[03:35:53.374 --> 03:35:54.775]  So, this movie is...
[03:35:55.795 --> 03:35:56.696]  It's such a heart warmer.
[03:35:56.696 --> 03:35:59.198]  I cried three times during the course of it.
[03:35:59.198 --> 03:36:00.959]  I don't believe you've ever cried in your life.
[03:36:00.959 --> 03:36:01.459]  As T.J.
[03:36:01.459 --> 03:36:14.088]  Kirk writes, this film is being treated as dangerous by the media and by the powers that be, not only because they're afraid it will inspire violence, but because it challenges their narrative about why violence happens in the first place.
[03:36:14.088 --> 03:36:23.555]  It challenges the cartoonish notion that every mass shooter is just a random sicko with a gun who snapped, or even more idiotically, was just born evil.
[03:36:23.715 --> 03:36:27.377]  Joker makes an explicit connection between mental illness and violence.
[03:36:27.377 --> 03:36:29.778]  Here's why that's dangerous and wrong.
[03:36:29.778 --> 03:36:33.819]  Because it doesn't fit with our partisan agenda to blame mass shootings on gun ownership.
[03:36:33.819 --> 03:36:42.503]  See, they don't want you talking about how mental illness leads to violence because they're responsible for exacerbating mental illness.
[03:36:42.503 --> 03:36:46.084]  Big Pharma, Silicon Valley, the rage bait media.
[03:36:50.649 --> 03:36:52.610]  Or is it getting crazier out there?
[03:36:52.610 --> 03:36:57.913]  They also tried to put people off from seeing this movie by terrifying us about how violent it was.
[03:36:57.913 --> 03:36:59.193]  That's rich, isn't it?
[03:36:59.193 --> 03:37:12.600]  The same news networks that plaster the names, faces and manifestos of mass shooters across the world while the bodies are still warm, inspiring copycat attacks, are blaming a comic book movie about a clown for mass shootings.
[03:37:12.600 --> 03:37:14.741]  And anyway, it's not even that violent.
[03:37:14.881 --> 03:37:17.223]  Yeah, there were like three brutal murders.
[03:37:17.223 --> 03:37:25.771]  But one of the biggest movies of the year, John Wick 3, was literally just two hours of straight violence and nobody got their panties in a bunch over that.
[03:37:25.771 --> 03:37:27.472]  There was no moral panic.
[03:37:27.472 --> 03:37:32.877]  There were no cops posted outside theaters in case Keanu Reeves radicalized anyone to go postal.
[03:37:32.877 --> 03:37:34.198]  Good to see you too.
[03:37:34.198 --> 03:37:41.945]  And unlike many movies that pander to wokeness in return for artificially inflated critic reviews, Joker didn't subject us to that.
[03:37:42.025 --> 03:37:44.186]  And that's also what makes them mad.
[03:37:44.186 --> 03:37:56.069]  They crave the power, which allows them to disincentivise people from making movies, which don't even deviate from the progressive consensus, but merely refuse to worship its sacred cows.
[03:37:56.069 --> 03:38:03.831]  They're engaged in a cultural revolution to cleanse the entertainment industry of anything that doesn't regurgitate their dogma.
[03:38:03.831 --> 03:38:08.492]  That's why there's a significant gap between the critic score and the audience score.
[03:38:08.592 --> 03:38:17.856]  Bear in mind, these are the same critics who gave Hustlers, some god-awful feminist cringe-fest, a better review score than Joker.
[03:38:17.856 --> 03:38:23.879]  Joker, an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films of the 21st century, gets 69%.
[03:38:23.879 --> 03:38:29.821]  Hustlers, some slut-fest dressed up as a tawdry, moralising girl power flick, gets 88%.
[03:38:31.542 --> 03:38:35.723]  How out of touch are these people going to get before we stop listening to them?
[03:38:35.723 --> 03:38:37.864]  Take the recent Dave Chappelle special.
[03:38:37.864 --> 03:38:43.945]  The difference between the critic score and the audience score was 35% to 99%.
[03:38:43.945 --> 03:38:49.567]  Merely because Chappelle made fun of LGBT people once during the entire show.
[03:38:49.567 --> 03:38:51.327]  Any deviation from the dogma.
[03:38:51.707 --> 03:38:56.791]  Any hint of dissent and the transgressor must be punished as a message to others.
[03:38:56.791 --> 03:39:05.898]  The critics' knives were out as soon as Joker director Todd Phillips dared engage in the wrong think of asserting that woke outrage culture has killed comedy.
[03:39:05.898 --> 03:39:13.224]  He also previously suggested that people realizing the system was rigged created the environment that allowed Trump to be elected.
[03:39:13.224 --> 03:39:15.045]  And for that reason alone, for not
[03:39:15.225 --> 03:39:18.188]  Genuflecting to the cult of political correctness.
[03:39:18.188 --> 03:39:25.136]  Numerous lefty reviewers probably walked into the cinema with a stick up their butt and their minds already made up.
[03:39:25.136 --> 03:39:29.081]  According to a CNN op-ed, Joker was racist!
[03:39:29.081 --> 03:39:33.686]  It's an insidious validation of the white male resentment that helped bring President Donald Trump to
[03:39:33.766 --> 03:39:34.427]  Power!
[03:39:34.427 --> 03:39:35.688]  Bullshit!
[03:39:35.688 --> 03:39:39.393]  Whatever politics form the backdrop to the movie are left-wing.
[03:39:39.393 --> 03:39:41.275]  It's an anti-capitalist thing.
[03:39:41.275 --> 03:39:47.522]  But the Joker character himself repeatedly emphasizes how his motivations are not political.
[03:39:47.522 --> 03:39:52.248]  All of the people he murders are white, and his love interest is a black single mom.
[03:39:52.648 --> 03:39:53.709]  God, so racist!
[03:39:53.709 --> 03:40:05.022]  But how revealing is it that the mere existence of a character, a mere analysis of the struggles of a mentally ill poor white man, is enough to prompt accusations of racism?
[03:40:05.022 --> 03:40:07.245]  That's why they hate this movie.
[03:40:07.245 --> 03:40:07.445]  God!
[03:40:07.585 --> 03:40:08.225]  Forbid!
[03:40:08.225 --> 03:40:14.069]  Could the existential angst of a white male be allowed to be represented in 2019?
[03:40:14.069 --> 03:40:19.932]  They also hate the Joker because it riffed on one of the more viral recent memes, Clown World.
[03:40:19.932 --> 03:40:30.319]  This idea that the only rational reaction to the increasing insanity that identity politics and political correctness has wrought on the world is to don a clown mask and honk a horn.
[03:40:33.543 --> 03:40:39.969]  The media, of course, savaged this meme as another dog whistle for white supremacists and deadly incels.
[03:40:39.969 --> 03:40:49.759]  For me, the Joker's erratic yet strangely satisfying dance moves were kind of a cathartic realisation and embracement of the whole clown world meme.
[03:40:49.759 --> 03:40:56.345]  The casting of Robert De Niro as the smug talk show host was also a stroke of genius because, as this tweeter points out,
[03:40:56.505 --> 03:41:07.897]  The actor himself has more or less become the condescending, self-righteous and elitist entertainment industry archetype who much of the working class has come to loathe over the last 20 years.
[03:41:07.897 --> 03:41:15.665]  As John Daniel Davidson points out, the movie also emphasises how maybe the thing people need most in life is friendship and love and community.
[03:41:16.025 --> 03:41:22.030]  Maybe we need to rethink the way we've torn down the institutions and traditions that used to support these things.
[03:41:22.030 --> 03:41:29.056]  Maybe the radical atomization and isolation and autonomy of modern life doesn't foster prosperity and happiness.
[03:41:29.056 --> 03:41:32.298]  Maybe we need to start taking these things seriously.
[03:41:32.298 --> 03:41:39.785]  If we do, that will mean rethinking a half-century of progressive thought and questioning whether it has all been a pack of lies.
[03:41:39.785 --> 03:41:43.868]  And maybe that's the real reason woke media hate Joker.
[03:41:44.048 --> 03:41:53.415]  As we can glean from his rant during his appearance on the talk show near the end of the film, one of Joker's main gripes is the breakdown of civility in society.
[03:41:53.415 --> 03:41:56.057]  He just wants people to be nicer to each other.
[03:41:56.057 --> 03:41:57.218]  Ask yourself this.
[03:41:57.218 --> 03:42:03.503]  Does a media establishment whose very existence is dependent on maintaining an endless cycle of rage bait
[03:42:03.783 --> 03:42:07.926]  A torrential shitshow of feigned outrage and partisan bickering.
[03:42:07.926 --> 03:42:18.153]  A drab deluge of hollow, meaningless plastic culture that shows nothing but vicious hostility to anything or anyone trying to express authenticity.
[03:42:18.153 --> 03:42:22.336]  Really want a message that exposes all of that to be heard.
[03:42:22.336 --> 03:42:30.781]  That is why, quote, establishment hates the Joker.
[03:42:30.781 --> 03:42:31.782]  There was in fact a tweet
[03:42:32.412 --> 03:42:40.597]  That I posted about an hour ago from a BuzzFeed journalist who said in this tweet, there's a moment where the Joker tells an offensive joke.
[03:42:40.597 --> 03:42:48.061]  Robert De Niro scolds him and tells him that you can't tell jokes like that and the Joker goes on a rant about how people are too easily offended these days.
[03:42:48.061 --> 03:42:49.923]  Seriously!
[03:42:49.923 --> 03:42:52.084]  Yes, he was triggered by that fact.
[03:42:52.084 --> 03:42:53.445]  That's why they hate it.
[03:42:53.445 --> 03:42:54.806]  That video is up on YouTube.
[03:42:54.806 --> 03:42:55.806]  Please get it.
[03:42:55.806 --> 03:42:56.206]  Get it out.
[03:42:56.206 --> 03:42:58.208]  We'll be back in the next segment.
[03:42:58.208 --> 03:42:58.708]  Don't go away.
[03:43:01.684 --> 03:43:08.987]  The globalists and their democrat minions are on the verge of taking this cold civil war hot.
[03:43:08.987 --> 03:43:20.732]  They have pushed and pushed and pushed and engaged in hoaxes and crimes and censorship and sabotage of the economy and attacks run by the UN on the border that are nothing short of war.
[03:43:21.272 --> 03:43:31.757]  And that's because it is a war by multinational corporations, allied with the shycoms and others, with the Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating filth, to try to capture the United States.
[03:43:31.757 --> 03:43:34.598]  This is 21st century war.
[03:43:34.598 --> 03:43:37.419]  And wars need money to be prosecuted.
[03:43:37.419 --> 03:43:38.660]  And we're actually winning the war.
[03:43:38.840 --> 03:43:41.201]  But the enemy's throwing their full weight at us right now.
[03:43:41.201 --> 03:43:42.642]  That's why we need financial support.
[03:43:42.642 --> 03:43:44.302]  It's a total 360 win.
[03:43:44.302 --> 03:43:45.263]  Double Patriot points.

[03:44:17.067 --> 03:44:20.568]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[03:44:20.568 --> 03:44:23.830]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[03:44:23.830 --> 03:44:27.391]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[03:44:27.391 --> 03:44:29.632]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[03:44:29.632 --> 03:44:31.033]  I suggest Band.Video.
[03:44:31.713 --> 03:44:37.178]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[03:44:37.178 --> 03:44:45.645]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[03:44:45.645 --> 03:44:52.371]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[03:44:52.371 --> 03:44:55.173]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[03:45:02.897 --> 03:45:04.738]  I'm up here with the crew.
[03:45:04.738 --> 03:45:10.260]  It's late at night, but I can't leave the office because history's happening right now.
[03:45:10.260 --> 03:45:15.342]  This is a battle of wills between those that want a free world and those that want tyranny.
[03:45:15.342 --> 03:45:18.684]  Those who've bet against humanity and those who've bet on humanity.
[03:45:19.404 --> 03:45:21.125]  So I'm so thankful to you, the listeners.
[03:45:21.125 --> 03:45:22.306]  You are the salt of the earth.
[03:45:22.306 --> 03:45:28.049]  You're the people that understand what's happening and who've helped launch a worldwide revolution against tyranny.
[03:45:28.049 --> 03:45:40.355]  So I thank you again, but please understand how important you are and understand that your word of mouth and your prayer and your financial support is absolutely more critical than ever, not just for President Trump, but for him, full wars, who is President Trump's bullhorn.
[03:45:40.715 --> 03:45:42.337]  Nationalism and patriotism.
[03:45:42.337 --> 03:45:48.542]  Please spread the word about InfoWars.com, port slash show, ban not video, and all the powerful transmissions and reports.
[03:45:48.542 --> 03:45:51.645]  Support yourselves with great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:45:51.645 --> 03:45:55.068]  This big mega sale that I call Black Friday comes early is about to end.
[03:45:55.068 --> 03:46:01.794]  Storewide free shipping, double patriot points, 50% off all the amazing supplements and all the emergency goods at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:46:03.880 --> 03:46:06.342]  The gauntlet has been thrown down.
[03:46:06.342 --> 03:46:12.565]  Every major Democrat candidate has come out and said they want to confiscate all semi-auto firearms.
[03:46:12.565 --> 03:46:17.688]  And now Buttigieg has come out and said that it's about political power.
[03:46:17.688 --> 03:46:19.129]  That's why they want the guns.
[03:46:19.129 --> 03:46:21.350]  Well, finally they're being honest.
[03:46:21.350 --> 03:46:24.912]  Because all their lies haven't got them to the point they want.
[03:46:24.912 --> 03:46:27.254]  So now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny.
[03:46:27.934 --> 03:46:30.435]  It shows what incredible followers these people are.
[03:46:30.435 --> 03:46:33.836]  The globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war.
[03:46:33.836 --> 03:46:39.718]  And they know that the minions trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position in that civil war.
[03:46:39.718 --> 03:46:47.320]  But it's up to us to understand the big picture, to carry the fight to the enemy in the information war before they can kick off a hot civil war.
[03:46:47.320 --> 03:46:49.721]  That's our mission, if you choose to accept it.
[03:46:49.721 --> 03:46:54.462]  So please, spread the word about InfoWars.com forward slash show, ban.video, and all the power
[03:46:54.462 --> 03:46:55.884]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:47:26.414 --> 03:47:34.256]  We'll be back live on the fourth hour of the show before I get into some final news stories to talk about the Extinction Rebellion protest.
[03:47:34.256 --> 03:47:39.116]  Once again, blocking the streets of London, I want to tell you about the final days of the Black Friday sale.
[03:47:39.116 --> 03:47:51.119]  We have 50% off double Patriot points and free shipping on a whole host of products, including bodies, the whole body support formula with the turmeric available right now for 50% off.
[03:47:53.765 --> 03:47:55.689]  216 reviews on that one.
[03:47:55.689 --> 03:47:56.210]  4.9 out of 5.
[03:47:56.210 --> 03:47:58.274]  You can't get much better than that.
[03:47:58.274 --> 03:48:03.324]  We have the Knockout Sleep Supplement, which is also 50% off as part of this deal.
[03:48:04.500 --> 03:48:08.422]  And we have the Turbo Force Energy Drink Energy Metabolism Alertness.
[03:48:08.422 --> 03:48:11.003]  That is powerful, powerful stuff available right now.
[03:48:11.003 --> 03:48:19.586]  Again, for a whopping 50% off as part of the Black Friday special available right now at infowarsstore.com.
[03:48:19.586 --> 03:48:22.587]  We're not funded by fat checks from George Soros.
[03:48:22.587 --> 03:48:24.188]  We're funded by you.
[03:48:24.188 --> 03:48:27.889]  Tell you who is funded by fat checks from George Soros.
[03:48:27.889 --> 03:48:30.150]  Groups like the Extinction Rebellion.
[03:48:30.945 --> 03:48:39.033]  Now I was on their website earlier today and they make a really strong point about emphasising how transparent they are with their funding.
[03:48:39.033 --> 03:48:44.037]  You follow the links to exactly where their funding comes from and they don't tell you.
[03:48:44.037 --> 03:48:52.665]  Basically a PowerPoint presentation without any information whatsoever about who these NGOs are that are backing this group.
[03:48:52.665 --> 03:48:56.669]  Obviously it's going to be the usual suspects but they don't even put it on their website.
[03:48:58.194 --> 03:49:02.597]  They brought London to a standstill yesterday, they're bringing other cities to a standstill.
[03:49:02.597 --> 03:49:09.543]  Headline, Professor slams Extinction Rebellion as a carnival for middle-classers who love to dress up as activists.
[03:49:09.543 --> 03:49:21.551]  In fact, there's a video in this article where Katie Hopkins, the British journalist, gets confronted by one of these Extinction Rebellion protesters, bombarding her with questions.
[03:49:21.551 --> 03:49:24.734]  As soon as she asks him one particular question,
[03:49:25.603 --> 03:49:28.824]  doesn't seem to be too keen on answering it.
[03:49:28.824 --> 03:49:30.604]  And it's a very simple question.
[03:49:30.604 --> 03:49:32.365]  Where did you go to school?
[03:49:32.365 --> 03:49:42.888]  Because this protest group seems to be very privileged, very white, very middle class, doesn't really seem to be representing the interests of the poor.
[03:49:42.888 --> 03:49:49.050]  Of course, if we followed their advice, poor countries, third world countries wouldn't be able to develop.
[03:49:49.050 --> 03:49:53.691]  They're already destroying their forests in many areas to grow palm oil.
[03:49:54.508 --> 03:49:57.771]  This is very interesting, the makeup of this crowd.
[03:49:57.771 --> 03:49:59.312]  Very privileged background.
[03:49:59.312 --> 03:50:07.980]  People have also noted this amazing coincidence whereby if you go on their Instagrams, they're always taking photos out of airplane windows.
[03:50:07.980 --> 03:50:09.561]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:50:09.561 --> 03:50:20.050]  They worship Greta Thunberg, the child actress who pals around with Arnold Schwarzenegger who's got a garage full of muscle cars and tanks.
[03:50:21.129 --> 03:50:26.813]  She pals around with Leonardo DiCaprio, who takes private jets to collect environmental awards.
[03:50:26.813 --> 03:50:33.378]  She pals around with Prince Harry, who took four private jet trips in 11 days to save the planet!
[03:50:33.378 --> 03:50:36.921]  No, to go and visit Elton John and party in his mansion.
[03:50:36.921 --> 03:50:39.202]  These are the people behind this movement.
[03:50:39.202 --> 03:50:49.390]  Rich elitists at the top, privileged middle class posh boys in the middle lecturing you on how to live your life while they're on literally like a dozen
[03:50:50.313 --> 03:50:59.917]  Commercial airline trips or even private jet trips a year taking selfies in airplanes and putting it on Instagram saying how much they care about the planet.
[03:50:59.917 --> 03:51:10.141]  Well now professor and sociologist Frank Ferendi has slammed the Extinction Rebellion climate change protests as a carnival for middle-classers who love to dress up as activists and that's what it is.
[03:51:10.141 --> 03:51:13.042]  This isn't a protest, this is a show-and-tell.
[03:51:13.042 --> 03:51:17.044]  This is just a huge virtue signaling exercise where they can put it on Instagram
[03:51:17.691 --> 03:51:22.293]  And make themselves feel warm and cosy about it and tell their friends about it.
[03:51:22.293 --> 03:51:24.714]  Make themselves look better in front of their friends.
[03:51:24.714 --> 03:51:26.855]  Oh my God, look at me, I'm such a good person.
[03:51:26.855 --> 03:51:29.317]  I care so much about the planet.
[03:51:29.317 --> 03:51:32.958]  When I'm not using diesel generators to actually power all this.
[03:51:32.958 --> 03:51:36.800]  We had another video about that.
[03:51:36.800 --> 03:51:41.462]  The group has embarked on a two-week campaign to bring 60 major world cities to a complete standstill.
[03:51:41.462 --> 03:51:43.343]  That's sure to win hearts and minds.
[03:51:43.343 --> 03:51:44.464]  Oh, by the way, they're literally
[03:51:45.788 --> 03:51:52.152]  They literally have given themselves the right to stop ambulances trying to get across some of these roads that they've blocked.
[03:51:52.152 --> 03:52:01.097]  And their leaders have given interviews saying, oh yeah, we'll have a chat with the person who's trying to get to their dying loved one to visit them for a last time.
[03:52:01.097 --> 03:52:05.920]  We'll have a chat with the emergency case in the ambulance who could die at any minute.
[03:52:05.920 --> 03:52:07.741]  Maybe we'll let them through, maybe we won't.
[03:52:08.416 --> 03:52:10.817]  And the police do absolutely nothing.
[03:52:10.817 --> 03:52:15.999]  They just sit there, stand there, in some cases frolic and dance with them.
[03:52:15.999 --> 03:52:26.844]  If anyone else did this, if this was the Countryside Alliance or a pro-Brexit march or whatever, who were literally blocking major roads and bridges in London, they'd all be arrested instantly.
[03:52:26.844 --> 03:52:28.645]  These guys get to do it all day.
[03:52:28.645 --> 03:52:32.006]  A few of them got arrested at the end of it.
[03:52:32.006 --> 03:52:33.167]  By the way, this guy here was
[03:52:33.860 --> 03:52:36.882]  There to save the Amazon rainforest, that's what that woman said.
[03:52:36.882 --> 03:52:44.308]  He was literally stopped in that moment from saving the Amazon rainforest because he was arrested.
[03:52:44.308 --> 03:52:49.852]  So this sociologist has written a really good op-ed about this which you should go and read.
[03:52:49.852 --> 03:52:57.557]  By the way, they're very proud to display their PVC yoga mats in the middle of Westminster Bridge.
[03:52:57.557 --> 03:53:02.141]  Probably not aware of the fact that PVC yoga mats are made literally from petroleum.
[03:53:04.600 --> 03:53:14.706]  Ferendi said, quote, The ease with which Extinction Rebellion has succeeded in occupying the moral high ground has little to do with the quality of their arguments and the strength of the case.
[03:53:14.706 --> 03:53:26.652]  In all but name that political establishments of the Western world have given up the attempt to exercise moral authority, the elite no longer upholds the values of their ancestors and is all too aware of its loss of legitimacy.
[03:53:26.652 --> 03:53:32.095]  It no longer believes in itself and is evidently prepared to be flagellated by its environmentalist critics.
[03:53:33.340 --> 03:53:40.427]  In turn, Extinction Rebellion knows that when it instructs its posh friends to jump, their answer is likely to be how high.
[03:53:40.427 --> 03:53:42.009]  This is the key point.
[03:53:42.009 --> 03:53:48.876]  A lot of people on the streets of London and elsewhere are of course really miffed and angry about the way this carnival of reaction has disrupted their life.
[03:53:49.835 --> 03:54:06.003]  In private conversations they murmur and swear at these wastrels, but as long as the performers enjoy backing of the media, the cultural elites, a significant section of the political establishment, and of course the all-important celebrities, their voice can be safely ignored by the protesters.
[03:54:06.003 --> 03:54:07.163]  And that is the point.
[03:54:07.163 --> 03:54:10.105]  This is not an organic grassroots movement.
[03:54:10.105 --> 03:54:14.627]  What they're calling for is widely supported by the political establishment itself.
[03:54:15.228 --> 03:54:24.996]  And if you drill down deeper into who actually operates these groups, who owns the carbon trading systems that make vast profits from this, it's the usual suspects.
[03:54:24.996 --> 03:54:27.839]  George Soros, Rothschilds, Al Gore.
[03:54:27.839 --> 03:54:31.722]  They're all well invested and these people are the useful idiots.
[03:54:31.722 --> 03:54:37.587]  They're out on the front lines making it very lucrative for them indeed.
[03:54:37.587 --> 03:54:42.471]  There was another video or another photo, sorry, which I put at the end of this article
[03:54:43.661 --> 03:54:51.324]  And it's literally three celebrities out of the UK proudly displaying Extinction Rebellion badges.
[03:54:51.324 --> 03:54:52.764]  Three of them.
[03:54:52.764 --> 03:55:00.567]  All three of them recently produced lucrative commercials for the Britain's biggest airport, Heathrow Airport.
[03:55:00.567 --> 03:55:05.189]  The one all the environmentalists are supposed to hate because they keep trying to expand it.
[03:55:05.189 --> 03:55:10.791]  And British Airways, the biggest commercial airliner in the country.
[03:55:10.791 --> 03:55:11.791]  Olivia Colman.
[03:55:12.401 --> 03:55:18.423]  Stephen Fry and Asim Chowdhury posing with Extinction Rebellion climate change badges.
[03:55:18.423 --> 03:55:20.604]  They're all for the cause.
[03:55:20.604 --> 03:55:26.686]  Apart from when they're being paid like Fry was to front a commercial for Heathrow Airport.
[03:55:26.686 --> 03:55:33.389]  Apart from when Coleman and Chowdhury appeared in a recent British Airways ad that plays before all flights.
[03:55:34.241 --> 03:55:39.043]  And I've seen it a million times, because they play it before every flight sets off.
[03:55:39.043 --> 03:55:52.968]  They're literally being paid by the biggest airport in the country, the biggest airliner in the country, while claiming to be denizens and vocal proponents of climate change reduction activism.
[03:55:52.968 --> 03:56:00.651]  Absolutely incredible, sheer hypocrisy, but it's par for the course, given who's at the top of this, people like.
[03:56:01.232 --> 03:56:09.696]  Prince Harry, people like Leonardo DiCaprio, people like Arnold Schwarzenegger, who are even bigger hypocrites.
[03:56:09.696 --> 03:56:15.759]  Meanwhile, new peer-reviewed academic study finds diversity is not a strength.
[03:56:15.759 --> 03:56:18.501]  This is out of a Danish university.
[03:56:18.501 --> 03:56:23.323]  It's entitled Ethnic Diversity in Social Trust, a Narrative and Meta-Analytical Review.
[03:56:23.323 --> 03:56:26.605]  It's not put out by the Heritage Foundation.
[03:56:26.605 --> 03:56:28.746]  It's not put out by Breitbart.com.
[03:56:30.197 --> 03:56:41.419]  It's put out by Danish university academics who were seeking to answer whether continued immigration and corresponding growing ethnic diversity was having a positive impact on community cohesion.
[03:56:41.419 --> 03:56:44.780]  But the study found the opposite to be the case.
[03:56:44.780 --> 03:56:46.100]  Well, what a surprise!
[03:56:46.100 --> 03:56:50.861]  Mass immigration, uncontrolled integration goes by the wayside.
[03:56:50.861 --> 03:56:56.522]  The study studied existing literature and also carried out a meta-analysis of the 1001 estimates from 87 studies
[03:56:58.380 --> 03:57:09.106]  And the research has concluded we find a statistically significant negative relationship between ethnic diversity and social trust across all studies.
[03:57:09.106 --> 03:57:16.771]  Not to say that you can't have some limited skilled immigration, but when you bombard a country, as we do in the case of the UK with almost
[03:57:18.739 --> 03:57:38.651]  300,000 immigrants every year into a tiny island country that has a total population of what now about 70 million and you don't integrate them and many of them can't even speak the language you're going to have big problems with social trust and social cohesion and that's exactly what this study has found out.
[03:57:39.392 --> 03:57:40.876]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[03:57:40.876 --> 03:57:43.663]  Coming up next is Ballroom with Owen Schroyer.
[03:57:43.663 --> 03:57:45.307]  Breaking news at InfoWars.com.
[03:57:45.307 --> 03:57:47.051]  Thanks for joining us and we'll be back.
[03:57:47.051 --> 03:57:47.593]  Don't go away.
