[00:00.000 --> 00:04.740]  Gavin McInnis is back with his all-new online network, FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:04.740 --> 00:32.900]  Gavin McInnis, Joe Biggs, Miley Unopolis, and Soph, all at FreeSpeech.tv.
[00:32.900 --> 00:34.900]  Here are the videos. It's Alex Jones.
[01:03.300 --> 01:08.100]  I've been trying to figure out how to make more money selling weed, and last night it came to me.
[01:08.820 --> 01:13.860]  We could grow the family business by selling Tegrity to the Chinese.
[01:17.140 --> 01:23.460]  I did a little research. Turns out there's a lot of people in China. If we can get like 2% of that
[01:23.460 --> 01:30.020]  market to buy our weed, we'd make millions of millions of dollars. I'm flying to China tomorrow.
[01:30.020 --> 01:32.100]  I've got to get in on this before anyone else thinks of it.
[01:42.180 --> 01:48.100]  First time going to China? No, not really. It's my first time. I'm going out to try and
[01:48.100 --> 01:53.780]  drum up a little business. What are you heading out for? I work for a clothing company. We're trying
[01:53.780 --> 02:02.660]  to break into the market and get the Chinese people as customers. Oh, hey, f*** you. I had that idea
[02:02.660 --> 02:08.820]  like three days ago. So what? So when did you come up with it? Hey Mitchell, you're on this flight?
[02:08.820 --> 02:12.980]  Yeah, that's so funny. I'm working for Google now, overseeing the expansions into the Chinese
[02:12.980 --> 02:17.780]  user base. He had still with the NBA, doing some press with the players to try to get more Chinese
[02:17.780 --> 02:25.780]  viewers. Oh, for Christ's sake. You have a good idea and everyone wants to copy you. Fine. I can
[02:25.780 --> 02:30.660]  handle some healthy competition. Who else wants to go to China and get some of their money?
[02:32.660 --> 02:34.100]  Oh, for crying out loud.
[02:40.580 --> 02:44.180]  Let me guess. You work for a company trying to get Chinese people as customers.
[02:44.180 --> 02:50.420]  Wow. Where'd you get that idea? It's okay. It's okay. I'm sure there's plenty of Chinese people
[02:50.420 --> 02:51.220]  for all of us.
[03:00.740 --> 03:07.860]  Hello. Howdy. I'm a small business owner from the United States. You guys know any money people
[03:07.860 --> 03:17.300]  here? Can I give you guys my card? I'm just starting to grow my business here in China.
[03:20.900 --> 03:28.180]  What is this, sir? Oh, that. That's weed. Marijuana. You know.
[03:28.180 --> 03:35.860]  Oh, here we go.
[03:41.220 --> 03:46.180]  Hey, everything all right? What's going on? Hey, don't forget my suitcase. Could you grab my
[03:46.180 --> 04:01.860]  suitcase? Oh, my weed is in there. Excuse me. JT Dama.
[04:01.860 --> 04:19.540]  I am a proud member of the Communist Party. The party is more important than the individual.
[04:32.020 --> 04:53.300]  Oh, hello there. Oh, who's there? Nobody. Just a bear. Who's wondering,
[04:53.300 --> 04:57.540]  since you're new, if you might have some honey?
[04:57.540 --> 05:04.340]  No, I don't have any honey. Are you prisoners here? Some people said fool looked like the
[05:04.340 --> 05:11.860]  Chinese president. So we're a leader in China now. Silicon Valley thinks you're a dumb jellyfish.
[05:11.860 --> 05:16.340]  They think the West is dead. They think of a censored nationalist and patriots off the internet.
[05:16.340 --> 05:20.340]  You'll just forget about us. And then they'll be the only information out there. Well, so far,
[05:20.340 --> 05:24.580]  that's not been working too well for them. Thanks to you spreading the word steadfastly,
[05:24.580 --> 05:30.100]  but the resistance to globalism is alive and well at banned.video. And now we've added a lot of new
[05:30.100 --> 05:34.580]  functions and a lot of new hosts and contributors to banned.video. So please bookmark it and check
[05:34.580 --> 05:38.740]  it daily and even more importantly, tell folks about banned.video and realize you can take it

[05:43.620 --> 05:49.060]  in defiance of big tech. Whether it's Apple or droid, you simply click the share button on your
[05:49.060 --> 05:54.020]  phone and then add to home screen. And then there's nothing the scumbags can do. The power of
[05:54.020 --> 05:59.380]  America, the power of freedom, the power to build a better world and stand in the face of the
[05:59.380 --> 06:06.260]  censors of the tyrants is alive and stronger than ever at banned.video. But it's up to you to unleash
[06:06.260 --> 06:36.100]  its full potential. Banned.video live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[06:36.660 --> 06:40.100]  Oh,
[06:49.540 --> 06:55.460]  ladies and gentlemen, we're live broadcasting worldwide. I am your host Alex Jones on this Tuesday,
[06:55.460 --> 07:03.060]  October 8th, 2019 global transmission. And to say that our plate is incredibly over full of
[07:03.060 --> 07:10.420]  and just earth shaking information is a understatement. It's unbelievable what's happening.
[07:10.420 --> 07:16.020]  We are entering, as I've said, this, this, this major geopolitical, cultural, economic, spiritual,
[07:16.820 --> 07:22.980]  quickening the likes of which this planet has never seen. Obama launched the Arab Spring and
[07:22.980 --> 07:31.220]  the invasions of Syria and other parts of the Middle East and Africa. Then seven years later,
[07:31.220 --> 07:39.300]  here is Trump in the middle of that, trying to contain all these different factions from Iran
[07:40.420 --> 07:53.380]  to Turkey to Iraq and others that want control. You've got a Shiite Sunni civil war that's kicked
[07:53.380 --> 08:01.700]  off in martial law in Iraq to the east of Syria. You've got Iran launching proxy wars in different
[08:01.700 --> 08:11.300]  areas of the Middle East as well. You've got Turkey that's enemies with Iran moving in to areas of
[08:11.300 --> 08:20.660]  northern Syria. Erdogan threatened just a few months ago to flood Europe with millions of,
[08:20.660 --> 08:29.860]  quote, refugees, most of them playing close al Qaeda and ISIS, if Turkey wasn't given part of
[08:29.860 --> 08:38.740]  northern Syria to repatriate these individuals. It was Obama and the globalist that took over
[08:38.740 --> 08:45.460]  the sovereign state, the bath estate of Syria that's been stable for 50 years.
[08:45.460 --> 08:52.340]  It was the neocons and the globalists that created this crisis. Now they've handed it to Trump
[08:54.900 --> 09:00.260]  and Turkey has said we're going to flood Europe in a new disaster or we're going to move these
[09:00.260 --> 09:09.460]  people back into Syria. And so Trump said, well, I'm not going to go to war with you
[09:09.460 --> 09:18.100]  if you try to do that. And then Pat Robertson comes out and says that
[09:19.380 --> 09:24.500]  Trump will lose the mandate of heaven if I guess we don't go to war with Turkey.
[09:25.220 --> 09:31.780]  The idea is if we didn't leave a few thousand troops, it wasn't a few hundred, in that area as a
[09:31.780 --> 09:41.780]  force threatening to go to war with Turkey, that this was all going to happen. But who triggered
[09:41.780 --> 09:47.940]  this all to begin with? Who launched the Arab Spring with Google and Facebook, Obama and Hillary?
[09:47.940 --> 09:51.780]  Who took over North Africa? Who took over the Middle East? Who launched the attack into Syria
[09:51.780 --> 09:56.660]  and did all this and then muzzles from all over the world, not just from the Middle East and Africa,
[09:56.660 --> 10:03.940]  went to Syria to take over. And most of these people that have now gone into Turkey are not Syrian.
[10:05.300 --> 10:06.260]  They're invaders.
[10:10.580 --> 10:12.340]  Most of them are military aged men.
[10:15.060 --> 10:21.380]  So they knew all of that. So we've got that huge report and Pat Robertson saying all this and
[10:21.380 --> 10:30.500]  by the way, you probably heard of mandate of heaven. That is an exact Chinese proverb when
[10:30.500 --> 10:36.100]  different Chinese emperors were successful. They had the mandate of heaven. When they didn't,
[10:36.100 --> 10:40.420]  they had lost the mandate. The communist Chinese talk about the mandate
[10:43.380 --> 10:47.460]  of the Communist Party being the mandate of heaven. So that that is just all part of the
[10:47.460 --> 10:53.220]  China vacation, the chai commification of everything. And that leads us obviously to the
[10:53.220 --> 10:59.060]  next big area I'm going to cover today. And that's the world awakening to the fact that
[10:59.060 --> 11:04.500]  China's bought up Hollywood, our debt and already controls most of our media. Chinese
[11:04.500 --> 11:10.420]  communists didn't like a Tiffany's ad running where a model is covering one eye and has a diamond
[11:10.420 --> 11:19.380]  ring on. They said, well, some of the Hong Kong protesters do that. So you're your virtue signaling.
[11:19.380 --> 11:24.500]  So we're going to ban you. And so Tiffany's has removed the ad. This is just a headlong
[11:24.500 --> 11:29.460]  worship of whatever the chai comms say because because we don't stand for anything because
[11:29.460 --> 11:35.060]  we won't stand up because we accept censorship. Now the dam broke. And so you got a billion,
[11:35.060 --> 11:41.380]  400 million chai comms. And whatever their government says is now king, because they'll
[11:41.380 --> 11:48.660]  call the shots. They're now the king culturally. The cultural revolution of Mao is now global
[11:48.660 --> 11:57.700]  via GG ping from Hollywood to Charlie would. That's years ago, the sinister Chinese takeover
[11:57.700 --> 12:03.140]  of movie land. And boy, they finance the right wing, the left wing, they finance it all. That's
[12:03.140 --> 12:07.060]  why you talk about this. And I would always have weird right wing groups attack me.
[12:07.860 --> 12:11.940]  You're making that up. China has no power. Leave them alone. I'm like, what?
[12:14.500 --> 12:23.060]  Everything from the new Red Dawn movie to the new top gun coming out is all chai comm funded,
[12:23.060 --> 12:28.420]  owned and approved. And now Apple denied it six months ago. Now they admit, okay, we do ban the
[12:28.420 --> 12:36.180]  Taiwanese flag and other flags that the China doesn't want in our emojis. So Apple's based
[12:36.180 --> 12:41.860]  officially for now a year plus in China. They moved over early last year. And they take their
[12:41.860 --> 12:46.020]  orders from them and they've got all the code keys to your phones. This is just the new world we live
[12:46.020 --> 12:52.420]  in. So we're going to look at all of those angles and the NBA literally groveling. Don't look for
[12:52.420 --> 12:57.540]  all the NBA players saying how much America sucks and how bad Trump is and how this country's racist
[12:57.540 --> 13:04.660]  and evil. Don't look for LeBron James in between taking his knees to say anything was in China
[13:04.660 --> 13:10.740]  next week. And don't look, don't look for any of it because these are evil corporations.
[13:12.580 --> 13:17.220]  And the CFR and the globalists have set it up where China is the future and America's done.
[13:20.100 --> 13:24.500]  And Trump's like a dose. Info wars like a dose of antibiotics when somebody's got game green.
[13:24.500 --> 13:30.820]  You know what? The left doesn't want us to get the medicine. They want us to go down the tubes.
[13:32.340 --> 13:37.300]  So all the Rolling Stone and CNN are now critical of the NBA. Oh, you're not standing up for human
[13:37.300 --> 13:41.380]  rights in China or in Hong Kong or all these people getting shot and killed for no reason.
[13:41.380 --> 13:44.260]  Always they don't want to be secretly arrested and disappeared. They're organs harvested.
[13:44.260 --> 13:55.380]  Oh, Rolling Stone and CNN and all these groups just cheerleaded when I was taking off all these
[13:55.380 --> 14:05.380]  platforms. But see now, CNN and Rolling Stone, you're banned in China. And then next week they're
[14:05.380 --> 14:10.100]  going to want you banned here because all the investment, all the money, all of it's been
[14:10.100 --> 14:13.940]  set up there. So that's the second big thing. We've got the huge war that could trigger world
[14:13.940 --> 14:21.620]  war in the Middle East. We've got China openly flexing its muscles and the level of groveling,
[14:21.620 --> 14:23.460]  even major video games.
[14:28.020 --> 14:31.380]  You know, it's as big as NFL games now, these big video game tournaments.
[14:32.100 --> 14:38.420]  Well, a well-known champion video game player fiction becomes reality like
[14:38.420 --> 14:47.220]  Ready Player One, playing in the big blizzard games,
[14:49.620 --> 14:54.420]  criticized Communist China and said that they were with the protesters in Hong Kong.
[14:54.420 --> 15:00.900]  And so that person's been kicked out of the tournament. Oh, now international video game
[15:00.900 --> 15:10.100]  companies say as a gamer up there playing games, you're winning. You're a celebrity. Everybody
[15:10.100 --> 15:17.460]  can see you. Millions are watching. You open your fat mouth against the chai comms, your banned.
[15:17.460 --> 15:24.580]  You can't win that $300,000 prize money now. This is how freedom dies. Once you give in
[15:24.580 --> 15:31.540]  to censorship, the dam breaks, the doors blow off, and like a submarine opening a bulkhead,
[15:31.540 --> 15:39.540]  you flood and sink. We're at that point. And then we learned, oh, there's more whistleblowers,
[15:39.540 --> 15:42.980]  but they're going to be secret with their faces blurred or blacked out when they testify to
[15:42.980 --> 15:50.740]  Congress. Never before done, secret testimony over video feeds. I guess Schiff will go in
[15:50.740 --> 15:55.620]  the other room and they'll black him out and he'll just speak. I mean, this is unbelievable.
[15:55.620 --> 16:02.580]  It's an assault on everything we hold dear, on every check and balance. We've got all that coming
[16:02.580 --> 16:11.460]  up. And so much more today. Stay with us. Attention GCN self-reliance listeners. If you've ever
[16:11.460 --> 16:16.500]  wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass
[16:16.500 --> 16:20.660]  up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear. Bill Hyde, I want to tell you
[16:20.660 --> 16:25.860]  about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you
[16:25.860 --> 16:30.420]  produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid. The clearance price is a result of the
[16:30.420 --> 16:34.900]  historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi. Because of the flooding,
[16:34.900 --> 16:39.380]  we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location. And rather than move it back
[16:39.380 --> 16:43.780]  to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable
[16:43.780 --> 16:47.860]  if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory. So here's what you should do right now. Check out
[16:47.860 --> 16:55.220]  the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com. That's myownpowergrid.com. Over a thousand dollars
[16:55.220 --> 16:59.380]  in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too. And the best part, you're not going to pay
[16:59.380 --> 17:18.260]  750 or $500, 300 or even 200. Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more. That's myownpowergrid.com.

[18:09.060 --> 18:13.700]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead. Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new
[18:13.700 --> 18:19.060]  info wars t-shirt instead of this is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. This is your brain.
[18:19.060 --> 18:24.020]  This is your brain on 5G. Showing your brain getting fried. Then I have some comments on your
[18:24.020 --> 18:29.060]  supplements man. Totally changed my life. I use turbo force, bodies, album power, brain force,
[18:29.060 --> 18:34.820]  fish oil, ultra 12 daily, X2 every several days. Now what I've found is is really combining them
[18:34.820 --> 18:40.340]  is a totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products and I
[18:40.340 --> 18:43.620]  just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them. I just want to say why not. Well,
[18:43.620 --> 18:47.940]  you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric or whether
[18:47.940 --> 18:52.740]  it's the fish oil or the krill oil or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and bio PQQ
[18:52.740 --> 18:56.420]  and all the rest of it. All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body. You take
[18:56.420 --> 19:01.220]  these bases together, then you have your foundation. Now you can build the big strong temple. With
[19:01.220 --> 19:04.980]  these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them, it makes my life so much better and
[19:04.980 --> 19:09.300]  then it funds the information war, which is so critical. Thank you so much. God bless you.
[19:09.300 --> 19:13.860]  Do you feel that my style is wrong or my substance is wrong? Trying to fact check the present.
[19:13.860 --> 19:21.460]  The deceptive, Humpty Dumpty troll known as Brian Stelter, his little weasel minion, Oliver Darcy
[19:21.460 --> 19:26.420]  have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air and to censor us. And of course he
[19:26.420 --> 19:30.980]  famously said on many others that Trump is the info wars president. President Trump's furious
[19:30.980 --> 19:37.460]  reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the info wars president.
[19:37.460 --> 19:42.500]  And you know what? It's true. Our audience of activists, our guests, our crew and my drive and
[19:42.500 --> 19:47.140]  your drive has brought Trump to the White House and other nationalists to power around the world.
[19:47.140 --> 19:51.380]  And now Trump's openly coming out declaring war on these globalist tyrants and their
[19:51.380 --> 19:56.740]  unelected anti-human tyrannies. So this is a day of great victory and I salute you all but now
[19:56.740 --> 20:02.340]  in the thick of the fight. So infowarstore.com for products you need massive sales now so we
[20:02.340 --> 20:07.060]  can continue on to the future and give these bastards one hell of a fight right until the end
[20:07.060 --> 20:22.980]  until we've defeated them. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:22.980 --> 20:44.580]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[20:44.580 --> 20:56.580]  Okay at the start of the next segment, I'm going to get up in front of the map here of your TV
[20:56.580 --> 21:02.020]  viewer. The radio listeners all walk through it as well. I'll narrate it and break down geopolitically
[21:02.020 --> 21:08.980]  what really happened in the Middle East in the last seven years and how after they took out
[21:08.980 --> 21:19.700]  Gaddafi in Northern Africa, they then transferred that ISIS al-Qaeda force up from Northern Africa
[21:20.660 --> 21:26.500]  in to Syria to then completely break the borders of Europe so that Turkey and Europe
[21:27.060 --> 21:30.420]  could be flooded with the Islamic invasion. That's the admitted UN plan.
[21:30.420 --> 21:40.180]  And how to sit there now and blame Trump when he's saying okay I got two bad decisions but the
[21:40.180 --> 21:50.500]  least bad is to let Turkey go into Northern Syria a place up until World War I or so that they
[21:50.500 --> 22:01.300]  controlled. So 100 years ago 102 years ago or so Turkey still controlled that area. And there's
[22:01.300 --> 22:07.060]  constant civil war going on between the Kurds and Turkey. The United States geopolitically has used
[22:07.060 --> 22:17.380]  the Kurds as a set piece and has used it as an excuse to stay in the region. And when I talk to U.S.
[22:17.380 --> 22:22.020]  military including quote special forces people they're so brainwashed they go well the Kurds are
[22:22.020 --> 22:29.220]  Christians no they're not they're 90 plus Muslim. I mean just the level of brainwashing our own
[22:29.220 --> 22:34.980]  troops are given about why the Kurds are our buddies and we need to be there. Obama launched the entire
[22:35.780 --> 22:41.220]  attack. They started it not Trump and Trump's absolutely right to say time to get out of there
[22:41.220 --> 22:44.100]  time to bring our people home we're going to play those clips start in the next segment
[22:44.100 --> 22:49.780]  that's gonna be the first big thing we're gonna cover. Then as I said I'm gonna get into the huge
[22:49.780 --> 22:58.020]  developments in China and how they are extending their control not just through our debt and our
[22:58.020 --> 23:12.340]  media but into private companies everywhere and how there is a collapse of resistance
[23:12.340 --> 23:19.620]  to the Chinese edicts. When I say collapse I mean they call the shots.
[23:23.540 --> 23:30.980]  If you're in a room and there's only one little window and there's a fan blowing through that
[23:30.980 --> 23:34.420]  window and that's the only force coming into the room it's going to control
[23:34.420 --> 23:43.220]  what happens in that room there's no countervailing force none of us stand for anything none of us
[23:43.220 --> 23:47.860]  will stand up for anything we've had a bunch of jellyfish put in power who were there because
[23:47.860 --> 23:53.380]  they follow orders and then now they're killing babies after they're born China's openly selling
[23:53.380 --> 23:59.060]  political dissidents organs children are being forcibly sterilized all over the world
[23:59.060 --> 24:07.060]  they're tricked into it their parents were thrown aside there's genetic engineering going on
[24:07.060 --> 24:12.900]  there's human animal clones being made we've gone over the edge we're not going over the edge
[24:13.940 --> 24:19.700]  we've gone over the edge so i'm going to cover all of that and then the latest ladies and gentlemen
[24:19.700 --> 24:24.100]  with the so-called whistleblowers that what do you call a disgruntled democrat that's being taken
[24:24.100 --> 24:29.220]  out of power who's corrupt well i mean they all know that clapper and brennan and all the usual
[24:29.220 --> 24:35.860]  suspects like andy mccabe and all of them that are getting indicted are discredited so they come out
[24:35.860 --> 24:39.860]  and say their names they'll go oh that's a partisan that was involved politically trying to stop
[24:39.860 --> 24:44.740]  trump using intelligence agencies so they call themselves whistleblowers and claim that trump's
[24:44.740 --> 24:52.900]  doing to them what they did to him and now you know the rats are leaving the sinking ship
[24:52.900 --> 24:59.940]  they did this a couple times last year and they're doing it again clapper and brennan are going on
[24:59.940 --> 25:06.500]  tv saying obama ordered us to do the spying we can't go to jail now that is rats leaving a
[25:06.500 --> 25:14.660]  sinking ship so again they say trump used executive power to try to stop biden from winning when
[25:14.660 --> 25:21.300]  biden's a loser biden can hardly talk trump has a job to go after corruption when he's giving more
[25:21.300 --> 25:24.980]  money these countries and to find out it's not going to democrats he better damn well
[25:24.980 --> 25:33.460]  have asked that question but they make that the crime that's all coming up today and then we've got
[25:34.260 --> 25:39.940]  joel scowles and world affairs brief popping in for several segments and then least ran a hand
[25:39.940 --> 25:44.020]  syndicated talk show house very informed investigative journalist as well on all this
[25:44.020 --> 25:54.420]  and paul joseph watson big four hours lined up we're not 25 minutes into it but let me tell you
[25:54.420 --> 25:59.060]  i'm going to reserve my statements for the start of the next segment but i'm going to lay it all out
[25:59.780 --> 26:04.740]  it's really happening in syria and where all this is going and what i really think of what
[26:04.740 --> 26:10.020]  trump's doing for the next segment so please stay with us and please share the live link at
[26:10.020 --> 26:14.100]  bandot video tell people about the local radio stations you're listening to or local tv stations

[26:43.620 --> 26:49.540]  you get it here i was the first to specifically lay out exactly how the globalist set up communist
[26:49.540 --> 26:55.780]  china to take over the world gave them one-sided policies gave them all the rarest minerals all
[26:55.780 --> 27:01.380]  the secrets all the codes and how they're maneuvering us for total collapse now exactly as i said
[27:01.380 --> 27:10.340]  is the countervailing pentagon prospectus and is the truth i literally wrote the future warfare
[27:10.340 --> 27:16.100]  doctrine on information warfare response to the chicoms give america wants to survive and i'm not
[27:16.100 --> 27:21.860]  bragging but it's time to just get down to brass tacks this is the spirit of the republic this
[27:21.860 --> 27:28.580]  broadcast is it and i don't mean that to brag that's a very dangerous position to be in and it shows
[27:28.580 --> 27:33.140]  how cowardly everybody else was or how they just bought into all these fake doctrines the real
[27:33.140 --> 27:39.700]  globalist doctrine is public that said i got behind this weekend as you know i didn't really plug on

[33:54.900 --> 34:00.020]  viewers i am about to lay out what's really happening in the middle east and this huge situation
[34:00.020 --> 34:07.700]  between turkey and syria and the headlines and ap roiders everywhere the poor pentagon
[34:07.700 --> 34:16.900]  stuck between trump turkey and syria and oh trump's a buffoon trump's an idiot he's compulsive he's
[34:16.900 --> 34:22.820]  an idiot he's caused the whole crisis in the middle east ladies and gentlemen that is a total
[34:22.820 --> 34:29.540]  line i'm about to prove it but anyone can go to the historical record seven plus years ago
[34:29.540 --> 34:36.580]  right when ben gazi happened obama and hillary let isa salcata forces take over libya then those
[34:36.580 --> 34:42.900]  forces invaded with western support this was on record remember senator rand paul and senator
[34:42.900 --> 34:52.020]  cruz all of them exposed it to go into syria and try to take over the bat this party that
[34:52.020 --> 35:00.980]  stabilized the whole region for more than 50 years now trump has said that he has to clean
[35:00.980 --> 35:07.220]  up all of obama's messes and that obama was the founder of isis along with hillary and
[35:07.220 --> 35:10.900]  that he had to clean it up so we made a deal with the russians come in and do most of the fighting
[35:11.620 --> 35:17.700]  clean it out we told iran you'll have to leave and we told turkey you're not gonna be able to
[35:17.700 --> 35:23.380]  take over either and then once we stabilize the country Assad will have elections he's agreed to
[35:23.380 --> 35:32.340]  leave well we're to that point except the 10 million plus quote refugees that that that
[35:32.340 --> 35:36.820]  that came from all over the muslim world to take over syria that's what muslims do they
[35:36.820 --> 35:42.660]  do pilgrimages jihad's that came from as far away as chechnya and the united states in england
[35:42.660 --> 35:52.100]  they all came there they took over well now there's estimates of five to ten million they
[35:52.100 --> 35:57.380]  say most have left well we've heard numbers of two three as high as four plus million refugees
[35:57.380 --> 36:02.900]  are in turkey right now i'm gonna go over the map in a moment so herd of gun has been saying for a
[36:02.900 --> 36:09.060]  year if you don't give me 23 billion dollars to build settlements in turkey for these millions of
[36:09.060 --> 36:15.860]  people and to vet them all i'm going to push them into europe or you can give me five billion
[36:15.860 --> 36:21.380]  dollars for the security forces and i will kick them in to syria where they came from or they
[36:21.380 --> 36:26.100]  can just go back home just like the un gives thousands of euros to people to invade europe
[36:26.100 --> 36:30.100]  or thousands of dollars to invade here through guatemala people come from africa they fly on
[36:30.100 --> 36:34.980]  un paid planes and they get a couple thousand dollars on debit cards no name on them and they
[36:34.980 --> 36:39.940]  just come up to the u.s. herd of gun said i'll give them all a couple thousand euros give me the
[36:39.940 --> 36:45.380]  money else wherever they came from now i'm not defending herd of gun he's a dictator i don't
[36:45.380 --> 36:50.260]  like him but he's right in this and trumps like yeah you're right these aren't your people so we let
[36:50.260 --> 36:57.700]  him flood europe or do we let him go back to where they came from in syria because again obama
[36:57.700 --> 37:02.980]  started all this but here's the president who's right saying it's time to come back home he promised
[37:02.980 --> 37:07.220]  to get us out of syria he promised to get us out of afghanistan he's ordered the withdrawal
[37:07.220 --> 37:11.140]  it's down to almost nothing in afghanistan and he's now withdrawing everybody out of there
[37:11.140 --> 37:15.780]  and turkey always said we're going to move in and take over northern kurtistan because it's always
[37:15.780 --> 37:21.620]  launching attacks on us and then that's where they'll kick them the invaders back in and yeah
[37:21.620 --> 37:25.860]  it's going to be a mess because the globalist he's stabilizing on purpose not our problem
[37:25.860 --> 37:31.140]  trumps fixing it here's the president and the fact that i was going to bring our our soldiers home
[37:31.140 --> 37:40.900]  and bring them home as rapidly as possible i we all together you we defeated and took over 100
[37:40.900 --> 37:45.220]  percent of the isis caliphate everybody said that was going to be an impossible thing to do i did it
[37:45.220 --> 37:49.540]  and i did it quickly because we have a great military now when i took over our military we
[37:49.540 --> 37:57.060]  didn't have ammunition i was told by a top general maybe the top of them all sir i'm sorry sir we
[37:57.060 --> 38:02.500]  don't have ammunition i said i'll never let another president have that happen to him or her
[38:03.300 --> 38:08.980]  we didn't have ammunition now we've captured isis we've done what we've done we had 50 soldiers in
[38:08.980 --> 38:14.260]  the area you're talking about and i said we want to bring our soldiers back home it's been a long
[38:14.260 --> 38:19.380]  time again we were supposed to be in there for a just a tiny spot like a 30 to 90 day period
[38:19.380 --> 38:28.420]  that was many years ago it's time beautiful a president doing what he said he'd do and the
[38:28.420 --> 38:35.700]  left hates him obama launched more wars than bush did and i didn't like those wars because
[38:35.700 --> 38:40.340]  they were destabilizing countries and putting things far worse in look at iraq it's in a civil
[38:40.340 --> 38:45.860]  war they're under martial law right now the whole middle east is fighting over control it's what the
[38:45.860 --> 38:51.620]  muslims do they never stopped fighting with themselves or anybody else from said i was
[38:51.620 --> 38:56.660]  elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars americas longest war afghanistan
[38:56.660 --> 39:00.580]  where our great military functions is a policing operation to the benefit of people who don't even
[39:00.580 --> 39:05.220]  like the usa the two most unhappy countries at this move are russia and china because they
[39:05.220 --> 39:11.940]  love seeing us bogged down well it's bigger than that ladies and gentlemen because in the case of
[39:11.940 --> 39:17.700]  china they've never spent one dollar on security in afghanistan we've spent now over a trillion
[39:17.700 --> 39:25.140]  just passed that a month ago in the last 18 plus years over a trillion where does china get hundreds
[39:25.140 --> 39:29.860]  of billions a year of rare as minerals afghanistan right on their border so let's continue let's go
[39:29.860 --> 39:37.700]  to pat robertson ladies and gentlemen last night saying trump will well here just see the clip of
[39:37.700 --> 39:43.780]  pat robertson quoting the communist chinese saying the mandate of heaven they say the communist party
[39:43.780 --> 39:49.540]  that's what mao said it's a quote maosik tongue said when he took over in 1949 he said the mandate
[39:49.540 --> 39:54.820]  of heaven has now been achieved by the communist party and we will rule for a thousand years
[39:54.820 --> 40:01.140]  and china will dominate the globe with our system of marx and lennon go pull his quotes up you can
[40:01.140 --> 40:07.780]  read pages of this crap what david rogerfeller drooling well here he is quoting maosik tongue
[40:09.060 --> 40:15.700]  two weeks ago he came out and said abortions okay yeah time to retire this guy okay so let's hear
[40:15.700 --> 40:22.100]  from uh let's hear from ld oblo now here's pat robertson ladies and gentlemen i want to say
[40:22.100 --> 40:29.460]  right now i am absolutely appalled that the united states is going to betray those democratic forces
[40:29.460 --> 40:35.060]  in northern syria that we're possibly going to allow the turkish to come in against the Kurds
[40:35.060 --> 40:45.140]  the odor erdogan is a thug he has taken control of his country as a dictator he is a strong leader and
[40:46.260 --> 40:53.540]  to you say he's an ally of america is nonsense he is in for himself and the president who allowed
[40:53.540 --> 41:01.300]  kashoggi to be cut in pieces and without any repercussions whatsoever is now allowing the
[41:01.300 --> 41:07.700]  christians and the courage to be massacred by the turks and i believe and i want to say this with
[41:07.700 --> 41:15.860]  great uh solemnity the president of the united states is in danger of losing the mandate of heaven
[41:15.860 --> 41:22.100]  if he permits this to happen the mandate of heaven now let's go back to the map because here are the
[41:22.100 --> 41:27.620]  facts just at the end of this segment quickly here are the facts ladies and gentlemen the globalists
[41:27.620 --> 41:32.260]  went in took out the baddest part of the stabilized iraq for more than 50 years all civil war then
[41:32.260 --> 41:36.420]  broke out it's still going on today over three million dead sanctions put on by the clinton's
[41:36.420 --> 41:41.860]  killed half of those you got syria attacked seven years ago by obama hillary and the globalists
[41:41.860 --> 41:47.060]  broke it up in all these parts now it's been cleaned out now the millions that have come into
[41:47.060 --> 41:52.180]  turkey had to be pushed back in or turkey's gonna dump them into europe and open that causeway into
[41:52.180 --> 41:57.780]  europe for the islamification which the globalists and obama admit was their plan all along so this
[41:57.780 --> 42:05.060]  is the best of all the bad deals there are and it's not our business what saudi arabia and turkey
[42:05.060 --> 42:10.100]  do with each other if they're killing each other's operatives like kashoggi like trumps god like he's
[42:10.100 --> 42:13.620]  supposed to tell everybody what to do trumps not god he's trying to be the president but you see
[42:13.620 --> 42:19.460]  pat robertson says trump will lose the mandate of heaven like he's god the truth is these neocons
[42:19.460 --> 42:24.980]  and globalists have sold america out almost bankrupted us with all of this they're the ones
[42:24.980 --> 42:28.660]  that have run the country in the ground and now they want to say trump doesn't have the mandate of
[42:28.660 --> 42:35.620]  god if he doesn't lie to everybody and violate his campaign promises and keep all this crap going
[42:35.620 --> 42:43.380]  hey pat robertson obama hates god obama kills babies after they're born obama's a globalist obama
[42:43.380 --> 42:47.700]  helped fund al qaeda and isis to take over that area kill hundreds of thousands of women women and
[42:47.700 --> 42:52.340]  children why don't you talk about how obama launched the attack to bring down the sovereign
[42:52.340 --> 42:57.380]  country and create the whole mess no now it's trump's fault you guys burn the house down
[42:57.380 --> 43:01.860]  trump shows up with a fire truck you say he's not shooting the water on the damn smoldering embers
[43:01.860 --> 43:12.820]  right it's in full war stay with us the globalist and their democrat minions are on the verge of
[43:12.820 --> 43:18.500]  taking this cold civil war hot they have pushed and pushed and pushed and engaged in hoaxes
[43:18.500 --> 43:25.060]  and crimes and censorship and sabotage of the economy and attacks run by the un on the border
[43:25.060 --> 43:31.380]  that are nothing short of war and that's because it is a war by multinational corporations ally with
[43:31.380 --> 43:37.060]  the chikams and others with the hollywood america hating god hating filled to try to capture the
[43:37.060 --> 43:44.340]  united states this is 21st century war and the wars need money to be prosecuted and we're actually

[46:17.220 --> 46:20.260]  that there's no way you're gonna have an authoritarian corporate world government
[46:20.260 --> 46:24.580]  above the law but doesn't pay taxes that has diplomatic immunity that runs around saying
[46:24.580 --> 46:29.860]  it's communist and socialist power to the people but then meanwhile his tax exempt again offshore
[46:29.860 --> 46:35.540]  well trump got that and all these other populace get it why would you throw away wealthy successful

[46:57.940 --> 47:04.260]  and god is delivering because god is great thank god for his son jesus christ and now let's move
[47:04.260 --> 47:25.220]  forward against the nw you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:25.220 --> 47:36.260]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:41.860 --> 47:45.220]  it's tuesday october 8th 2019
[47:45.220 --> 47:57.060]  and i'm wearing you're not a sponsor a gray stetson open road pad why am i doing that starting
[47:57.060 --> 48:01.860]  this segment you know i've noticed if i wear a pair of sunglasses on the show when i talk about
[48:01.860 --> 48:06.260]  something or i'm outside when we're doing the the news feed people just pay attention more
[48:06.900 --> 48:14.580]  but i was walking out the door this morning and uh i decided well i'm not really going out on the
[48:14.580 --> 48:20.020]  range or anything i'm not going to the family ranch every once in a while to actually take a cowboy
[48:20.020 --> 48:23.940]  hat with me we're going to be riding horses or something i'm one of the few folks you'll see
[48:23.940 --> 48:27.860]  that every once in a while wears a cowboy hat that actually owns some cattle through our family ranch
[48:30.020 --> 48:35.780]  but i thought i ought to wear the hat just to make people think about a little bit of nostalgia
[48:38.260 --> 48:43.780]  because this is the real type of cowboy hat people wore hollywood popularized the big giant
[48:43.780 --> 48:48.340]  jug hats and all the rest of that but this is this is what cowboy is actually wearing right here
[48:49.860 --> 48:53.940]  unless you're on a really big long trail ride and then that'll be a little bit bigger straw hat
[48:53.940 --> 48:59.620]  but but this is a real cowboy hat right here this is what they look like not the stuff you see in
[48:59.620 --> 49:07.300]  hollywood oh my grandfather's wore this like my dad's got his dad's somewhere motor oil all over
[49:07.300 --> 49:15.060]  it holes holes in it awesome hat but the reason i'm wearing this hat is again it is to get people
[49:15.060 --> 49:23.780]  out of their normal zone and just think about how Nancy Pelosi and Schiff you know they're the
[49:23.780 --> 49:28.420]  chairman of committees she's the speaker of the house and so she sits there with this so-called
[49:28.420 --> 49:35.460]  authority but really she's just wearing a costume because she works for the globalist and the sell
[49:35.460 --> 49:42.340]  out of the nation and so somebody wearing a big cowboy hat doesn't necessarily own any cattle
[49:43.060 --> 49:47.940]  it's the saying all hat no cattle it's kind of like saying a mile wide an inch deep
[49:50.260 --> 49:55.380]  and that's really what it comes down to is what made america different it's that we strove to
[49:55.380 --> 50:02.820]  have more freedom we strove with our imperfect union to try to find a better place and to have
[50:02.820 --> 50:08.580]  more freedom and to free the slaves and empower women and a place where people could come out of
[50:08.580 --> 50:13.220]  caste systems out of systems where there was the rich and everybody else the poor and to come to a
[50:13.220 --> 50:22.180]  nation where they had a chance to really fulfill their dreams that's the american dream is being
[50:22.180 --> 50:28.900]  able to have a chance to follow your dream not a guarantee anyone guaranteeing you some utopia
[50:28.900 --> 50:39.860]  is a cult leader and will only deliver hell now the next story i'm going to get into
[50:40.900 --> 50:46.580]  is of the greatest import because it shows really positive things are happening
[50:48.260 --> 50:55.220]  a lot of folks just now waking up will say no negative things are happening but that's not the
[50:55.220 --> 51:03.620]  case china for well over a decade has been basically in control of our media because any
[51:03.620 --> 51:12.020]  criticism of what they're doing results in that media not just having its own systems banned in
[51:12.020 --> 51:19.060]  china but any companies associated with it blocked then the chai comms will also finance systems
[51:19.060 --> 51:25.860]  and proxy groups to come after you so we've been bullied by china for a long time they've really
[51:25.860 --> 51:31.860]  been in the catbird seat for 10 years or longer it really accelerated once obama got in the
[51:31.860 --> 51:36.660]  missile secrets all our technology all our science one-sided trade deals no environmental standards
[51:41.940 --> 51:45.700]  and so now the good news is this has been happening for a long time
[51:45.700 --> 51:53.620]  but just now is there a big giant debate about it because when this stuff has been going on by
[51:53.620 --> 51:58.980]  stealth i would get up here and say hey you know most these films have to get approved by chinese
[51:58.980 --> 52:07.940]  censors not just for distribution in china but for release period because the majority
[52:07.940 --> 52:16.660]  of the stock and management in the big six hollywood studios is now chai com owned and run
[52:19.060 --> 52:24.660]  so when you see all the vile race war and all the vile garbage and all the anti american
[52:24.660 --> 52:29.860]  propaganda and america sucks and people taking a knee at the super bowl and nike producing its
[52:29.860 --> 52:37.540]  tennis shoes in china that's all paid for by the chai comms they are doing that to demoralize us
[52:37.540 --> 52:47.140]  and so there's a debate now about oh china is telling us what we can and can't say in america
[52:47.140 --> 52:51.780]  and approving most the movies and scripts that's terrible that's unamerican we've sold our soul
[52:51.780 --> 52:58.500]  for money but it's way beyond money art establishment put communists in charge in 1949 that's public
[53:00.340 --> 53:05.460]  to set them up as the managed economy to dominate the entire world the ring of mordor
[53:05.460 --> 53:13.300]  one ring to find them one ring to call them together and in the darkness bind them
[53:15.380 --> 53:21.060]  so of course nike pulls an american flag off their shoe and says it's evil their chai come
[53:22.820 --> 53:27.620]  of course jolette comes out and says families are inherently bad in america and men are inherently
[53:27.620 --> 53:36.260]  evil it's chai come controlled because they've got a state-run system there that has produced tens
[53:36.260 --> 53:41.380]  upon tens of trillions of fiat currency and has bought everyone off they're the ones the value
[53:41.380 --> 53:51.780]  and currency worldwide this has been the plan to take us down but the globalist needed a base
[53:51.780 --> 53:57.540]  outside of america that was powerful and had a billion people and had trillions of fake dollars
[53:57.540 --> 54:03.380]  and had hard-working smart people that would carry out orders and you can see now the spiritual
[54:03.380 --> 54:09.540]  and cultural sickness and how we are on death doorstep as a nation but with trump and info wars
[54:09.540 --> 54:21.700]  in you we're fighting back because we know what's happening now and so the rocket's general manager
[54:21.700 --> 54:27.620]  just a few days ago says i stand with the demonstrators in hong kong who want basic freedom
[54:28.900 --> 54:32.580]  who have a deal that china wouldn't take them over for decades who have a deal that they have
[54:32.580 --> 54:42.900]  basic freedoms the chinese don't have and then the team said oh we'll fire him oh we apologize
[54:42.900 --> 54:48.180]  china then cancelled games 10 cent the company that bought reddit they bought reddit for 150 million
[54:48.180 --> 54:54.020]  ban the donald right after they bought it election meddling right there
[54:55.220 --> 54:59.380]  trump's biggest website was the donald subreddit about 10 million visitors a day not anymore it's
[54:59.380 --> 55:07.220]  all gone it's all frozen that same group owns the distribution of the mba with 668 million viewers
[55:07.220 --> 55:15.780]  per season and they said uh-oh we're not going to show it we're going to block it we're going to
[55:15.780 --> 55:21.060]  block all the games of the rockets because you didn't submit even though you're grobbling and
[55:21.060 --> 55:25.860]  apologizing it's not enough and then the chinese communists complained oh we saw a tiffany's ad
[55:25.860 --> 55:30.740]  in a magazine of a woman covering her eye like oh she's so excited with a diamond ring we think
[55:30.740 --> 55:37.300]  that's secret code against us ban it just like winnie the pooh's band and just like disney's agreed
[55:37.300 --> 55:43.220]  to have no winnie the pooh characters and anything put in china because gg ping doesn't like winnie
[55:43.220 --> 55:47.540]  the pooh by the way that's not a joke you said well doesn't make sense doesn't make sense to say
[55:47.540 --> 55:52.900]  don't say mother or father it's a hate term doesn't make sense to say men can have babies is not true
[55:52.900 --> 55:59.540]  if authoritarians can make you say two plus two equals 10 they've broken your will it's called double
[55:59.540 --> 56:08.340]  think crime stop read 1984 he was a member of the communist party the fabian socialist in england
[56:08.340 --> 56:16.260]  eric blair towards our wells his pen name he was winston smith of the bbc for the oss for the cia
[56:16.260 --> 56:26.900]  for mi6 and he wrote a book about the future we live under and this is it where winnie the pooh's
[56:26.900 --> 56:31.700]  in prison where two million people are in death camps where china advertises they sell political
[56:31.700 --> 56:36.180]  distance organs and people just can't believe it hell we keep babies alive here and do it
[56:36.180 --> 56:42.180]  evil is exercising itself out in the open and we come back i'm going to play the groveling
[56:42.180 --> 56:48.020]  and the nba and all the rest of it and then the lone media outlet comedy central via com of all
[56:48.020 --> 56:55.060]  places biggest media company u.s saying no we'll we'll allow them to do this but china has banned
[56:55.060 --> 57:00.340]  the episode and we're going to play large excerpts of it that's very factual and very accurate they
[57:00.340 --> 57:07.300]  catch you with marijuana they execute you you're gay they kill you and again the left doesn't care
[57:07.300 --> 57:13.140]  about that they want power and if they think the godless chai comms can overthrow america
[57:13.700 --> 57:17.460]  they spiritually feel satisfied on the left because it's a spiritual battle
[57:17.460 --> 57:23.460]  even though it will destroy their own future they want to burn it all down everything must go
[57:23.460 --> 57:28.820]  that's the first sign you see in joker and no one in the review points it out here he is with a big
[57:28.820 --> 57:37.300]  sign everything must go everything must burn everything must fall so the uber mention can rise
[57:37.300 --> 57:46.420]  out of the mud the beautiful nile lily it's all sick they sold the poison they poisoned the country
[57:46.420 --> 57:51.460]  they killed it now they tell you it's about the collapse that they'll rise up out of it i'll be
[57:51.460 --> 58:01.700]  dead before i see that you'll never succeed our tool for it the gauntlet has been thrown down
[58:01.700 --> 58:07.940]  every major democrat candidate has come out and said they want to confiscate all semi-auto firearms
[58:07.940 --> 58:14.100]  and now buda judge has come out and said that it's about political power that's why they want the
[58:14.100 --> 58:20.340]  guns well finally they're being honest because all their lies haven't got them to the point they want
[58:20.340 --> 58:25.300]  so now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny it shows what incredible followers these
[58:25.300 --> 58:30.020]  people are the globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war and they know that
[58:30.020 --> 58:35.060]  the minions trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position in that civil war
[58:35.060 --> 58:39.940]  but it's up to us to understand the big picture to carry the fight to the enemy and the information
[58:39.940 --> 58:45.940]  war before they can kick off a hot civil war that's our mission if you choose to accept it so please

[1:00:25.300 --> 1:00:33.540]  so most of the nba put their tail between their legs and began peeing on themselves a little puppy
[1:00:33.540 --> 1:00:40.340]  does when it's scared and the chai com shed will ban the nba in china the most popular sport there
[1:00:40.900 --> 1:00:45.140]  basketball is huge in north korea as you've noticed they just love it one of the most
[1:00:45.140 --> 1:00:48.500]  watchable sports i'll agree with them i like track and field personally but
[1:00:48.500 --> 1:00:56.660]  we're literally losing our souls here so now the nba chairman adam silber came out
[1:00:57.780 --> 1:01:02.340]  encountered other top nba owners and others grobbling and said no no we stand for free speech
[1:01:02.340 --> 1:01:08.100]  well now they've banned the lakers game coming up so they're just banning more and more good let's
[1:01:08.100 --> 1:01:14.580]  call their whole bluff china wasn't self-sustaining they didn't have their own oil their own minerals
[1:01:14.580 --> 1:01:20.020]  anything the globalists gave them everything and the people got none of it the people got
[1:01:20.020 --> 1:01:25.300]  herded off their land by the hundreds of millions of the great leap forward the cultural revolution
[1:01:25.300 --> 1:01:31.940]  and forced into slave factories so let's hear from lebron james no you're not
[1:01:34.580 --> 1:01:39.460]  you're not going to see that ladies and gentlemen you're not going to see that
[1:01:39.460 --> 1:01:47.380]  that i don't think because look at james harden the nba player coming out and grobbling two people
[1:01:47.380 --> 1:01:52.500]  that killed a hundred plus million of their own people who have two million muslim wiggers in
[1:01:52.500 --> 1:02:01.620]  concentration camps not a damn word instead we get grobbling here it is we apologize you know

[1:02:32.900 --> 1:02:38.420]  of ideas which is definitely a strength if you embrace the diversity of ideas instead of being
[1:02:38.420 --> 1:02:44.340]  police state and telling people what to think it all came out of america dumbass didn't come out of
[1:02:44.340 --> 1:02:51.540]  common as china and so that's what they're all doing except a few people and again you've got the
[1:02:51.540 --> 1:02:57.300]  manager of the rockets who apologized and grobbled that we print me as apology i saw it a few days
[1:02:57.300 --> 1:03:04.900]  ago we're going to cover it all when we come back and then i'm going to air excerpts from south park
[1:03:04.900 --> 1:03:11.780]  that knocks it out of the park good for south park and they put out their official apology to china

[1:06:45.220 --> 1:06:55.140]  the earth ladies and gentlemen we're back live broadcasting worldwide i am your host alex jones
[1:06:56.100 --> 1:07:02.500]  and this whole situation with communist china controlling our banks controlling our currency
[1:07:02.500 --> 1:07:08.020]  controlling almost all of our resources now is hitting the news everywhere south park's been
[1:07:08.020 --> 1:07:15.060]  banned in china all these mba games are being banned all because a manager of the rocket said he supports
[1:07:15.060 --> 1:07:20.740]  the demonstrators of their right to demonstrate and have freedom in hong kong tiffany's had an ad
[1:07:20.740 --> 1:07:25.140]  with a woman with a diamond ring on covering her alex she was so excited china said that was secret
[1:07:25.140 --> 1:07:32.660]  code to the protesters they apologized remove the ad nike removes american flags off when the
[1:07:32.660 --> 1:07:39.460]  mba and nfl players don't like it but don't expect any people to be kneeling and getting on their knees
[1:07:41.620 --> 1:07:47.140]  when the chinese anthem is played with all these exhibition games in china because they only bash
[1:07:47.140 --> 1:07:52.100]  america because they're on the hollywood globalist payroll and chicon payroll that owns hollywood
[1:07:52.100 --> 1:07:58.580]  to do that well since you'll bash america and say how much freedom sucks the next step is to worship
[1:07:58.580 --> 1:08:07.460]  china but south park hasn't bowed to them without a powerful episode i'm going to play some excerpt
[1:08:07.460 --> 1:08:13.380]  south where it shows the local control america versus the control in china and now the kids are
[1:08:13.380 --> 1:08:18.020]  starting a boy band and the producer comes by and says well china is going to run this
[1:08:18.820 --> 1:08:23.220]  and so they have to approve the script well you can't talk about how your sick friend needs an organ
[1:08:23.220 --> 1:08:28.020]  because china's selling organs and you can't talk about how america's great because america sucks
[1:08:30.260 --> 1:08:33.460]  you can't criticize authority because china won't allow that and you can't talk about
[1:08:34.100 --> 1:08:39.860]  you know somebody being gay because china executes you for that but then the dad who owns a marijuana
[1:08:39.860 --> 1:08:45.140]  farm of weaponized dope flies over to china thinking they'll be like us he gets arrested and put in a
[1:08:45.140 --> 1:08:50.740]  death camp but later he learns oh i'll just get them to say you need to buy integrity let's say on my
[1:08:50.740 --> 1:08:56.900]  farm so they buy his farm so china has integrity showing the soleness of the chai comps so then
[1:08:56.900 --> 1:09:01.860]  he runs around the dad kills one of the poo supports all the tyranny censorship because
[1:09:01.860 --> 1:09:09.860]  he has integrity when they bought it from him so it all shows really genius level sophistication
[1:09:09.860 --> 1:09:15.380]  in multiple levels but also it has a kid level for young people watching it it is an adult program
[1:09:15.380 --> 1:09:23.540]  obviously we've bleeped it out but that illustrates everything we're dealing with but joker is oh
[1:09:23.540 --> 1:09:27.620]  beautiful loser killing people oh it's genius oh it's so smart
[1:09:30.340 --> 1:09:34.260]  i could sit there and change somebody up and pull their teeth out with pliers and shoot hd of it and
[1:09:34.260 --> 1:09:40.580]  you'd call it genius because it was so damn intense it's not it's meant to be cultural poison
[1:09:40.580 --> 1:09:46.260]  trigger mass shootings take all these desperate people disenfranchised made desperate made alone
[1:09:46.260 --> 1:09:50.420]  on purpose by the system that's declassified to now tell you you're beautiful and wonderful
[1:09:50.420 --> 1:09:56.100]  come out of your cocoon murder people have an uprising antifa you'll be somebody that's all
[1:09:56.100 --> 1:10:02.180]  chai comp funded you know a chinese controlled uh production house put the movie out and they put
[1:10:02.180 --> 1:10:10.660]  all the other ones out everyone who almost every movie the chai comps of the heroes
[1:10:12.100 --> 1:10:17.460]  so let's go ahead and go to adam silver who first groveled to the chai comps there was a backlash
[1:10:17.460 --> 1:10:21.460]  so he came out and said let's just all accept free expression but we also understand china
[1:10:21.460 --> 1:10:24.500]  oh that's not enough now they're gonna ban all the games ban the lakers
[1:10:24.500 --> 1:10:32.980]  versus the nets because once you give in to a pirate once you give in to a blackmailer once
[1:10:32.980 --> 1:10:37.380]  you give in once you ban alex jones well next week it's mitch pecanals getting banned on twitter
[1:10:38.340 --> 1:10:43.860]  because the tyrants tested you and you failed you gave in you submitted you weren't americans
[1:10:45.780 --> 1:10:47.620]  think john wane tried to take your free speech
[1:10:47.620 --> 1:10:55.780]  only if you're trying to corrupt little kids then the left was oh you're censoring us no
[1:10:55.780 --> 1:11:01.780]  that's going after kids but now the sky's the limit you notice the left totally is the guard dog
[1:11:01.780 --> 1:11:07.860]  of censorship not the guard dog of freedom of speech so let's go to adam silver here it is
[1:11:08.820 --> 1:11:15.460]  and essentially what i've said in that statement is the long had held values of the mba are to
[1:11:15.460 --> 1:11:22.180]  support freedom of expression and certainly freedom of expression by members of the mba community
[1:11:22.180 --> 1:11:27.140]  and in this case darryl moray as the general manager of the houston rockets enjoys that
[1:11:27.140 --> 1:11:34.100]  right as one of our employees what what i also try to suggest is i understand that there are
[1:11:34.100 --> 1:11:43.620]  consequences from that exercise of in essence his freedom of speech and you know we will have to
[1:11:43.620 --> 1:11:51.220]  live with those consequences it's my hope that for our chinese fans and our partners in china
[1:11:51.220 --> 1:11:58.100]  they will see those remarks in the context of now a three decade if not longer relationship
[1:11:59.140 --> 1:12:08.740]  cctv announced that because of my remarks supporting darryl moray's freedom of expression
[1:12:08.740 --> 1:12:13.780]  not the substance of his statement but his freedom of expression they were no longer
[1:12:13.780 --> 1:12:20.340]  going to air the lakers nets preseason games that are scheduled for later this week again
[1:12:21.860 --> 1:12:25.460]  it's not something we expected to happen i think it's it's unfortunate
[1:12:27.140 --> 1:12:33.780]  but um if that's the sort of the consequences of us adhering to our values
[1:12:33.780 --> 1:12:42.100]  so that's where america's gotten that was a groveling milk toast statement after he completely
[1:12:42.100 --> 1:12:48.420]  groveled but there was a backlash by americans saying that isn't american values well it's not
[1:12:48.420 --> 1:12:53.780]  the national basketball league it's the new world order system
[1:12:56.900 --> 1:13:01.540]  and so that's how we've gotten to this place is capitulation and groveling to the system
[1:13:01.540 --> 1:13:08.340]  and it's only going to get worse until we learn to say no again and learn to be the
[1:13:08.340 --> 1:13:12.500]  leaders in the promotion of freedom instead the leaders of bowing and kissing ass to the
[1:13:12.500 --> 1:13:18.580]  college professors and the leftist pundits and the thought police and the controlled corporate
[1:13:18.580 --> 1:13:24.900]  media and all of the language police and the chai comms because all of this is pure authoritarianism
[1:13:24.900 --> 1:13:29.620]  it didn't happen by accident that's the plan let's go to this clip from south park
[1:13:29.620 --> 1:13:34.740]  and then we'll come back and break down more of this geopolitically and what this means but
[1:13:34.740 --> 1:13:37.860]  here's the dad who's in the death camp uh in china
[1:13:41.700 --> 1:13:48.340]  clip 17 drum roll please it seems to me like your music is kind of

[1:14:36.420 --> 1:14:41.060]  of it how obama started this whole thing and how the media is totally uh covering all of that up

[1:14:59.460 --> 1:15:06.260]  they can to take this broadcast off of the air they're working to censor us everywhere just like
[1:15:06.260 --> 1:15:11.460]  you just seen with the chai comms trying to come in and fire everybody or block games that don't
[1:15:11.460 --> 1:15:15.780]  you know totally submit to them and once you give into one demand it's more more more as i said

[1:20:35.140 --> 1:20:44.500]  jones the globalist set up china to economically leverage out the rest of the world and to become
[1:20:44.500 --> 1:20:49.620]  the model of internet censorship the model of surveillance and also a base they can run to
[1:20:49.620 --> 1:20:55.540]  and launder money here's a headline out of cnbc today china's surveillance tech is spreading

[1:23:47.540 --> 1:23:53.700]  trump may lose the mandate of heaven i'm just an ancient chinese imperial saying uh we've got
[1:23:53.700 --> 1:23:59.700]  uh the chai comms exerting their full force of censorship we've just got all of this insanity
[1:23:59.700 --> 1:24:03.700]  going on thank you for joining us sir on short notice we really respect your views at world
[1:24:03.700 --> 1:24:09.460]  affairs brief dot com what do you want to tackle first well let's talk about syria since that's
[1:24:09.460 --> 1:24:17.780]  really on the hot burner right now it's it's one of the most confusing situations i've run into
[1:24:17.780 --> 1:24:24.100]  in the past three or four months because uh all of the globalists of course are condemning
[1:24:24.100 --> 1:24:30.020]  trump for pulling out of syria but it really isn't a pullout it's two observation posts
[1:24:30.020 --> 1:24:37.780]  less than 24 individuals i mean these are not combat troops but their presence of course in
[1:24:37.780 --> 1:24:44.900]  the line of fire has uh or the removal of their presence has given turkey the green light and the
[1:24:44.900 --> 1:24:49.620]  and the u.s. yesterday said there was no green light given but there were clear indications
[1:24:49.620 --> 1:24:56.180]  there were a green light clear back in december uh trump told erdogan we're leaving syria when
[1:24:56.180 --> 1:25:02.820]  he was threatening the first pullout it's all yours handing it over to syria the big problem
[1:25:02.820 --> 1:25:10.740]  is syria turkey has already attacked the curds with airstrikes yesterday and have moved up
[1:25:10.740 --> 1:25:16.740]  border troops and armored vehicles ready for the big push and trump has done nothing trump said
[1:25:16.740 --> 1:25:21.700]  that he was going to crush their economy in his bragging tweet you know like i've done before
[1:25:21.700 --> 1:25:26.740]  well he's never done it before i really don't understand what this is coming to but he's clearly
[1:25:26.740 --> 1:25:32.740]  not coming through with his threat to uh turkey not to do anything and he said you know in my
[1:25:32.740 --> 1:25:36.740]  infinite wisdom you know if they do something that i think is wrong and i'm going to destroy
[1:25:36.740 --> 1:25:42.740]  their economy it's just braggadocious but he's not doing anything and worse alex russia isn't
[1:25:42.740 --> 1:25:48.420]  doing anything i mean turkey's playing both one foot in nato and one foot in the russian camp
[1:25:49.380 --> 1:25:55.140]  and neither the us or russia are interfering and both of them are running air patrols in the area
[1:25:55.140 --> 1:26:02.980]  they're they're not stopping turkish fighters from attacking the curds and that's obviously regrettable
[1:26:02.980 --> 1:26:07.220]  but trump's trying to get us out of afghanistan as well he's promised to bring the troops home
[1:26:08.100 --> 1:26:12.740]  turkey historically has you know been involved in that area i don't like her to gun as much as you do
[1:26:13.700 --> 1:26:19.060]  but when obama started all this with hillary they sit in the proxy armies they took it over
[1:26:20.260 --> 1:26:24.020]  how are we supposed to sit there and stay in the middle of this mess i mean turkey has said they're
[1:26:24.020 --> 1:26:28.740]  going to invade they've said that for a year or they're going to push the millions of refugees
[1:26:28.740 --> 1:26:34.900]  into europe europe has said no don't do that just keep them yourself but give them no money so what
[1:26:34.900 --> 1:26:42.740]  is turkey supposed to do well turkey wants portions of syria they want the Kurds out because the
[1:26:42.740 --> 1:26:49.060]  Kurds are not terrorists the Kurds are in fact trying to establish a Kurdish republic and trying
[1:26:49.060 --> 1:26:54.740]  to get liberty for their Kurdish people that are living in turkey and you know turkey's a ruthless
[1:26:54.740 --> 1:27:01.060]  aggressor versus the Kurds the Kurds have helped the united states fight isis in fact the Kurds
[1:27:01.060 --> 1:27:07.300]  did most of the fighting because the us did nothing except save isis in the battle of mozal and in
[1:27:07.300 --> 1:27:13.140]  the battle of raqqa they're the ones who paid for the 50 semi trucks to haul isa it's well undoubtedly
[1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:18.100]  the Kurds have been caught between iraq and and syria and saudi arabia forever and have been
[1:27:18.100 --> 1:27:22.740]  wanting their autonomy and i i understand that but why is it our place to stay there i mean we've
[1:27:22.740 --> 1:27:26.820]  all wanted to stop being the policeman of the world we've all wanted to right get the troops
[1:27:26.820 --> 1:27:32.660]  home and that that was trump's campaign promise yeah but this isn't doing it i mean look at what
[1:27:32.660 --> 1:27:38.500]  happened in afghanistan when he came very very close to that deal with the taliban and i believe
[1:27:38.500 --> 1:27:43.620]  what happened when a faction of the taliban carried out that attack would sabotage the talks
[1:27:44.180 --> 1:27:47.940]  i don't believe that was done from taliban headquarters because they don't control all
[1:27:47.940 --> 1:27:52.500]  the factions i think well no let's do this we're going to break you're a smart guy i respect you
[1:27:52.500 --> 1:27:57.060]  you're right about 98 percent of the time i'm right about 95 percent of the time on geopolitics
[1:27:57.060 --> 1:28:04.500]  so when we come back i want to get your big view on why is civil war breaking out in iraq and
[1:28:04.500 --> 1:28:10.100]  martial law why is there proxy wars going on between india and pakistan heating up most analysts
[1:28:10.100 --> 1:28:14.020]  say the most dangerous spot for nuclear war flashpoint of the planet why is china moving
[1:28:14.020 --> 1:28:19.380]  it's hong kong and taiwan right now uh why is the un trying to break down our borders and the us
[1:28:19.380 --> 1:28:24.420]  borders geopolitically one of the factions one of the reasons that we see the world going into
[1:28:24.420 --> 1:28:30.820]  crisis we got 40 seconds to break but just in summation why is this happening well it's impossible
[1:28:30.820 --> 1:28:36.340]  to answer all of those questions with one theory i mean there are many specific reasons for each of
[1:28:36.340 --> 1:28:44.180]  these regional uh battles the us is in the middle east to create conflict to justify taking down
[1:28:44.180 --> 1:28:49.860]  iran that's the target the target is not syria it was only a temporary target because israel said
[1:28:49.860 --> 1:28:53.460]  i'm we're not going to attack iran so you didn't answer the question though what's happened to
[1:28:53.460 --> 1:28:58.020]  middle east is all about iran we'll come back and talk about that with joel scowson on the other

[1:33:53.380 --> 1:33:57.380]  obama and the globalist invaded the country destabilized it took it down trump had the
[1:33:57.380 --> 1:34:01.940]  right policy to work with russia to try to stabilize it kick al-qaeda and ice us out
[1:34:02.980 --> 1:34:06.180]  now the Kurds who did work with the west who do that were a big part of it
[1:34:06.180 --> 1:34:14.740]  it's been a constant conflict with turkey are reportedly being betrayed because these few outposts
[1:34:14.740 --> 1:34:19.380]  they said a couple hundred special operators scowls and saying it was not even that many
[1:34:21.620 --> 1:34:27.380]  leaving green lights urtagun's invasion urtagun's been saying let me take this
[1:34:27.380 --> 1:34:33.540]  area over and repatriate all these refugees are all sick among europe i mean that's geopolitically
[1:34:33.540 --> 1:34:37.380]  what's been happening if you just look at it from turkey's perspective turkey reportedly is
[1:34:37.380 --> 1:34:43.540]  against iran we're alive in saudi arabia but you've seen them uh in uh big fights as well
[1:34:43.540 --> 1:34:49.300]  but we were talking about iran and the sunni sheites civil war going on iraq has descended
[1:34:49.300 --> 1:34:55.460]  into martial law reportedly six seven thousand dead joe scowls and the world of first brief
[1:34:55.460 --> 1:35:00.900]  dot com has looked at all the angles of this what do you think trump thinks he's doing versus
[1:35:00.900 --> 1:35:08.100]  what is happening and you've got pat robertson saying trump has you know is in the process of
[1:35:08.100 --> 1:35:16.660]  committing a huge disaster trump then says well all economically destroy turkey if they go too far
[1:35:16.660 --> 1:35:22.420]  so that does note that some type of back channel agreement was made here and if that's the case
[1:35:22.420 --> 1:35:28.500]  then what would that agreement be joe scowls well turkey has long been lobbying for them to take
[1:35:28.500 --> 1:35:34.740]  control of a buffer zone in northern syria which are occupied by the Kurds in other words let us
[1:35:34.740 --> 1:35:40.340]  do this buffer zone will be a no military zone but we'll control it and we're going to build
[1:35:41.060 --> 1:35:46.500]  three billion dollars worth of housing to house these refugees what turkey is in essence saying is
[1:35:46.500 --> 1:35:50.180]  if we're going to build these houses and take control of it we're going to own this area after
[1:35:50.180 --> 1:35:55.780]  this war is over that's what turkey wants to do is to expel the Turks and control this area of
[1:35:55.780 --> 1:36:03.940]  northern syria which is a violation of syrian sovereignty and you know the us has essentially
[1:36:03.940 --> 1:36:09.620]  given them the the green light and go too far you know heaven knows what that means but they're
[1:36:09.620 --> 1:36:14.980]  bombing the Kurds right now as we speak and it has gone too far trump has done nothing and russia
[1:36:14.980 --> 1:36:20.660]  has done nothing but here's what i think is happening i think the reason all the globalists
[1:36:20.660 --> 1:36:26.340]  are upset about this 24 troops leaving you know and all that that means i mean that's not a withdrawal
[1:36:26.340 --> 1:36:32.500]  in fact i want to tell you that there are several much more larger bases with combat troops south
[1:36:32.500 --> 1:36:37.780]  of that area in syria that aren't leaving and so trump has been given some false intelligence
[1:36:37.780 --> 1:36:41.300]  that you're going to be leaving syria if you take out these two outposts it's just not true
[1:36:42.100 --> 1:36:48.420]  and so i think he's been snookered but i think the larger agenda is to have a major war start with
[1:36:48.420 --> 1:36:55.220]  turkey and the Kurds that will then justify pushing trump into letting armed forces come back into
[1:36:55.220 --> 1:37:01.220]  syria in other words it's a back door to get more troops into syria by letting a massacre occur
[1:37:01.220 --> 1:37:08.100]  between turkey and the Kurds turkey's one of the largest conventional militaries
[1:37:08.100 --> 1:37:18.500]  can you speak to that joel oh yes there's no doubt about it now they're not top of the line
[1:37:18.500 --> 1:37:24.100]  fighters by any means but they've got equipment they've got they poured all of their money into
[1:37:24.100 --> 1:37:32.020]  armored divisions and i think that they're going to be a tough road to hoe for the syrians i think
[1:37:32.020 --> 1:37:38.260]  the syrians are going to go to battle with the the turks at some point the russians are going to get
[1:37:38.260 --> 1:37:45.860]  involved there i just don't understand why somebody isn't threatening turkey right now to stay out of
[1:37:45.860 --> 1:37:50.660]  syria and the only reason that's that they're not doing that because the deep state controls the
[1:37:50.660 --> 1:37:55.780]  military in the us they're not doing that is because i think they want a bigger war to justify
[1:37:55.780 --> 1:38:02.500]  the entire thing going up in flames and to justify more troops coming back into syria in
[1:38:02.500 --> 1:38:08.980]  in retrospect ultimately it it points to iran every one of these neocons whether it's lindsey
[1:38:08.980 --> 1:38:14.740]  graham or dick chaney and others keep talking about and and marco rubio iran is the real target
[1:38:14.740 --> 1:38:21.220]  here iran controls syria well iran has been in syria supporting Assad now for over 30 years so
[1:38:21.220 --> 1:38:26.580]  this isn't anything new about iran being in syria but the reason iran is in syria is the only
[1:38:27.220 --> 1:38:32.820]  military force independent military force in the middle east that is fighting us back terrorism
[1:38:32.820 --> 1:38:38.980]  this whole uh notion that iran is the biggest sponsor of terror in the world is absolutely
[1:38:38.980 --> 1:38:45.620]  false it's the us deep state that sponsors al qaeda sponsors isis all of the is a syrian rebels
[1:38:45.620 --> 1:38:51.940]  which there are no moderates in those syrian rivers they're all vicious islamist militants and
[1:38:51.940 --> 1:38:56.580]  iran is the only force fighting those things and that's why they call those forces terrorists
[1:38:56.580 --> 1:39:02.020]  because they're fighting our terrorists as the us and let's be clear i agree with you
[1:39:02.660 --> 1:39:07.700]  obama started this the globalist sent in al qaeda islamic state changed the name to isis
[1:39:07.700 --> 1:39:15.700]  and now trump has the right instinct trying to get out but the way this is being done and
[1:39:15.700 --> 1:39:20.660]  the way turkey's coming in is going to be used as the excuse now to try to make trump look like an
[1:39:20.660 --> 1:39:28.020]  idiot and have a pretext for a real reoccupation of parts of the country by the united states
[1:39:29.380 --> 1:39:34.420]  now remember that obama didn't start this obama merely signed the nuclear agreement with iran
[1:39:34.420 --> 1:39:39.620]  but remember that was a globalist trap they had to sure i'm talking about i'm talking about the
[1:39:39.620 --> 1:39:44.580]  takedown of libya and the invasion of syria i'm not talking about the ongoing build up to proxy
[1:39:44.580 --> 1:39:50.100]  war and war with iran right but that's a that's a globalist thing that isn't iran i mean obama is
[1:39:50.100 --> 1:39:55.380]  just a puppet obama didn't know i know i'm just talking about the left and the globalists did all
[1:39:55.380 --> 1:40:00.820]  this now they're trying to blame the mess on trump i mean i agree what turkey's doing is not a good
[1:40:00.820 --> 1:40:04.980]  thing uh i'm just saying this is going to be blamed on trump and you're agreeing with that i mean
[1:40:04.980 --> 1:40:10.020]  it's already happening yes absolutely in other words i think they're making a big deal out of it
[1:40:10.020 --> 1:40:16.180]  because i mean what trump is doing is nothing what taking out 24 troops less than 24 out of two
[1:40:16.180 --> 1:40:21.380]  observations there aren't even combat troops the only thing that does is prove that there's a green
[1:40:21.380 --> 1:40:27.460]  light to turkey that it's okay now to attack and so i'm very very disappointed with trump that he
[1:40:27.460 --> 1:40:32.260]  isn't uh making good on his promise to stop them and notice he didn't stop threatening any military
[1:40:32.260 --> 1:40:36.820]  force against turkey he just threatened economic force which would take months to do what we're
[1:40:36.820 --> 1:40:41.300]  talking about sanctions against turkey we'll talk about that more in a moment but this is mom's shell
[1:40:41.300 --> 1:40:46.180]  and you're absolutely right there's us troops still in syria we didn't you know uh green light
[1:40:46.180 --> 1:40:51.780]  what what erdogan's doing with that and so that really is something that the pentagon must be telling
[1:40:51.780 --> 1:40:58.740]  uh trump so so why would they want to hoodwink him like that well as i say i think the globalists
[1:40:58.740 --> 1:41:04.260]  want a larger war in syria to justify either an attack on iran having iran coming to the defense
[1:41:04.260 --> 1:41:10.740]  of syria there's going to be a larger conflict uh confrontation between syria and turkey and so
[1:41:12.020 --> 1:41:17.940]  they set trump up basically to say that he started this by withdrawing a puny you know
[1:41:17.940 --> 1:41:23.220]  a couple of dozen troops uh and in fact somebody gave the green light to erdogan whether or not
[1:41:23.220 --> 1:41:27.700]  they planted that in trump's ear and you know he he's subject to flattery he likes to flatter
[1:41:27.700 --> 1:41:34.260]  other leaders he keeps having good conversations with erdogan who is a ruthless dictator um and
[1:41:34.260 --> 1:41:40.980]  i think he shouldn't do that but i think that without intent trump gave an unknowing green
[1:41:40.980 --> 1:41:44.980]  light to erdogan and it's certainly going forward but i think it's going to lead to a larger war
[1:41:44.980 --> 1:41:50.980]  in iran i mean with iran in syria and somehow russia's going to have to get involved too so this
[1:41:50.980 --> 1:41:55.860]  is over the instincts are right to try to get out of these wars but the neocon advisors aren't
[1:41:55.860 --> 1:42:01.620]  telling him sir you just greenlit erdogan and so now they're trying to hang this around trump's
[1:42:01.620 --> 1:42:08.180]  neck like the bay of pigs absolutely and in fact the proof that he hasn't been told the truth is
[1:42:08.180 --> 1:42:14.100]  that he thinks he's getting out of syria by taking out 24 troops he's not taking out the hundreds of
[1:42:14.100 --> 1:42:19.780]  other troops and blackwater mercenaries that are deeply in these other bases in syria so these
[1:42:19.780 --> 1:42:26.340]  being lied to bison is intelligence but let me ask you this question when we come back with jules
[1:42:26.340 --> 1:42:32.500]  calzen what does president trump do to get out of this mess this bear trap that he's obviously
[1:42:32.500 --> 1:42:38.020]  stepped into and again trump's not god he makes mistakes folks and i agree with jules calzen that
[1:42:38.020 --> 1:42:42.980]  the way this has all been maneuvered he's being set up we know that people like pat robertson
[1:42:42.980 --> 1:42:47.060]  and it basically does what he's told to say it might be you don't think he's a bad person but
[1:42:47.060 --> 1:42:52.500]  i mean he's up there saying trumps about to lose the you know blessings of heaven or whatever uh
[1:42:52.500 --> 1:42:58.100]  the chinese communist quotes basically uh the edict of heaven that's all coming up as well
[1:42:58.100 --> 1:43:02.420]  with those clips with jules calzen we know trumps in a trap you know america's in a trap how do we
[1:43:02.420 --> 1:43:10.260]  get out of the trap well they're right back stay with us the gauntlet has been thrown down every
[1:43:10.260 --> 1:43:16.020]  major democrat candidate has come out and said they want to confiscate all semi-auto firearms
[1:43:16.020 --> 1:43:22.260]  and now buda judge has come out and said that it's about political power that's why they want the
[1:43:22.260 --> 1:43:28.420]  guns well finally they're being honest because all their lies haven't got them to the point they want
[1:43:28.420 --> 1:43:33.380]  so now they're just trying to normalize all this tyranny it shows what incredible followers these
[1:43:33.380 --> 1:43:38.100]  people are the globalists know they're not going to get this without a civil war and they know that
[1:43:38.100 --> 1:43:43.140]  the minions trying to carry this out are not going to be in a good position in that civil war
[1:43:43.140 --> 1:43:48.020]  but it's up to us that understand the big picture to carry the fight to the enemy in the information

[1:47:12.260 --> 1:47:21.940]  go
[1:47:23.460 --> 1:47:29.940]  defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[1:47:29.940 --> 1:47:42.580]  so we've had all the big neocons and republicans come out and freak out on the president about the
[1:47:42.580 --> 1:47:48.180]  turkey situation but none of them pointed out that the deep state the globalist under obama
[1:47:48.180 --> 1:47:53.620]  and hillary engineered all this or that turkey has one of the biggest provincial militaries in the
[1:47:53.620 --> 1:47:58.180]  world and has been saying they're gonna dump these millions of refugees on europe or kick them into
[1:47:58.180 --> 1:48:05.620]  syria and so trump signals well okay and then turkey turns into a giant invasion knowing it'll be
[1:48:05.620 --> 1:48:10.420]  embarrassing for trump when they do 50 times more than they were planning so trump now hey warns you
[1:48:10.420 --> 1:48:15.860]  better back off you better you know not double cross me it's a mess ladies and gentlemen that
[1:48:15.860 --> 1:48:20.740]  trump didn't create it but the media is making it about him jones galson's a smart guy respect his
[1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:25.540]  views on this world affairs brief dot com editor what would you do if you were the president right
[1:48:25.540 --> 1:48:29.700]  now and what do you expect the deep state to do because i agree they're looking their lips about
[1:48:29.700 --> 1:48:34.580]  this is what i try to embarrass trump even if this thing turns into a giant disaster or fiasco
[1:48:35.620 --> 1:48:39.540]  isn't it the deep state that basically helped engineer this to begin with so they certainly
[1:48:39.540 --> 1:48:46.020]  shouldn't be on a high horse well that's right and as long as the deep state continues to control
[1:48:46.020 --> 1:48:53.700]  terrorism and isis lindsay grams prophecy about terrors or isis coming back that i mean he's absolutely
[1:48:53.700 --> 1:49:00.260]  right isis was not defeated and the reason is which lindsay grand may or may not know because
[1:49:00.260 --> 1:49:06.500]  he's part of the deep state the reason isis was not to be just part it's created by the deep state
[1:49:06.500 --> 1:49:12.820]  and it simply blends back and forth into the syrian rebels and then back into isis as needed well as
[1:49:12.820 --> 1:49:18.180]  you said every time they're at bases being protected by the west right now that's right
[1:49:18.900 --> 1:49:22.820]  and uh you know they've been saved every time they've been in battle at least their leaders and
[1:49:22.820 --> 1:49:27.540]  most of their heavy weapons have been saved now there's a lot of isis people from europe that
[1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:32.500]  are in these refugee camps or these prison camps that are controlled by the curbs right now which
[1:49:32.500 --> 1:49:37.140]  are going to be abandoned and given over to turkey when turkey drives the curbs out and
[1:49:37.140 --> 1:49:43.140]  turkey's using that as leverage to get the e you to try to give him money to build housing he knows
[1:49:43.140 --> 1:49:48.260]  that europe doesn't want these people back so he wants to build housing there in this so-called
[1:49:48.260 --> 1:49:54.020]  demilitarized zone which then he will control and it will become part of turkey that's his whole
[1:49:54.020 --> 1:50:00.500]  plan there and the the only way that trump can win this battle is to somehow get an advisor get
[1:50:00.500 --> 1:50:05.700]  some information so that he understands what the deep state doing what the false intelligence is
[1:50:05.700 --> 1:50:11.860]  is coming it's like chuck todd and meet the press excoriated a g.o.p.s editor and he cried out and
[1:50:11.860 --> 1:50:16.980]  don't you trust the f.b.i. don't you trust the c.i.a. how dare you as an american congressman
[1:50:16.980 --> 1:50:23.060]  not trust our intelligence agencies well the g.o.p.s senator of course had to parrot that he
[1:50:23.060 --> 1:50:27.620]  does trust them but i don't trust them at all they're deep state and they lie to trump continually
[1:50:28.260 --> 1:50:33.540]  aran is not the biggest amounts of terror in the world the u.s. is along with israel and
[1:50:33.540 --> 1:50:40.500]  saudi arabia and so that's the only thing he's got to do is start understanding and get the
[1:50:40.500 --> 1:50:46.260]  information get somebody who's got his ear and to tell him what the deep state is is doing that is
[1:50:46.260 --> 1:50:52.580]  wrong and and and buck up against it now you're not going to just simply solve this by pulling
[1:50:52.580 --> 1:50:56.980]  american troops out of syria because they're going to do another false flag they're going to do this
[1:50:56.980 --> 1:51:02.660]  turkey invasion of the courage and it's going to blow up into another larger war eventually they
[1:51:02.660 --> 1:51:08.740]  want war with aran they've continued and failed three times now to induce a war with aran in
[1:51:08.740 --> 1:51:13.780]  the past three months and ran is too smart to take the bait right now but eventually it's
[1:51:13.780 --> 1:51:18.580]  going to happen and you know it's going to be a large one and it's probably going to involve
[1:51:18.580 --> 1:51:22.820]  killing american troops that's the only thing that's going to go to americans into agreeing to
[1:51:22.820 --> 1:51:28.100]  attack aran or get trump to agree to attack aran but it is i totally agree with you jill scousen but
[1:51:28.100 --> 1:51:32.740]  isn't trump's instinct and like his speech saying time to bring him home time to come back trying
[1:51:32.740 --> 1:51:37.700]  to follow his promise i mean isn't that really a very positive sign that trump is at least trying
[1:51:37.700 --> 1:51:43.060]  to not be the world's policeman yeah yeah but it's not going to do any good if because he's not
[1:51:43.060 --> 1:51:48.820]  going to be able to resist the next false flag in afghanistan that that justifies keeping the troops
[1:51:48.820 --> 1:51:53.540]  there you know i understand that geopolitically and the climate it's still not going to be enough
[1:51:53.540 --> 1:51:58.340]  because we have evil people willing to destabilize the world because then that gives them power and
[1:51:58.340 --> 1:52:02.420]  that's the secret of evil is it just has to break things to be in charge instead of trying to fix
[1:52:02.420 --> 1:52:06.900]  things which is much much harder so i think we need to support the president we need to contact
[1:52:06.900 --> 1:52:10.340]  the president everybody needs to let the president know that he's being set up i think you should come
[1:52:10.340 --> 1:52:14.820]  out and talk about who destabilized syria who brought the country down he should expose the
[1:52:14.820 --> 1:52:18.900]  deep state like he's done the intelligence agencies and i think he should speak out about
[1:52:18.900 --> 1:52:23.540]  how they created the climate for this and i think that might scare them back into their holes
[1:52:24.900 --> 1:52:30.260]  no no he has not exposed the deep state he keeps naming deep state people to high position
[1:52:30.900 --> 1:52:35.540]  he has not exposed the deep state he's talked about it he he thinks of it in general terms but
[1:52:35.540 --> 1:52:40.900]  he can't sure i'm saying compared to anybody else but you're right he keeps though calling up deep
[1:52:40.900 --> 1:52:46.020]  state people they lie to him and say they're loyal and they stab him in the back that's right
[1:52:46.020 --> 1:52:50.660]  and he's talking about lie detector tests for everybody in the staff they've got hundreds of
[1:52:50.660 --> 1:52:55.380]  people in there that are leaking to the press about the donald trump i mean this is never
[1:52:55.380 --> 1:53:00.980]  going to end you know going to switching to the impeachment topic i am suspicious because this
[1:53:00.980 --> 1:53:08.180]  is such a flimsy pretext for impeachment that if they keep pushing this it means they do have an
[1:53:08.180 --> 1:53:14.020]  agenda to get rid of the president and it's got to involve mainstream republicans in other words
[1:53:14.020 --> 1:53:18.500]  i totally agree they're making their move they've been changing impeachment rules they're really
[1:53:18.500 --> 1:53:24.100]  serious yeah it looks like they are it looks like they're setting up mit rom need to take
[1:53:25.300 --> 1:53:29.620]  trump's place if they can impeach him and get him out so that he can't run for president
[1:53:29.620 --> 1:53:34.260]  now if trump's smart he'll run again you know even if you've been impeached you can run again
[1:53:34.820 --> 1:53:38.580]  in the next election and he he could actually with him he didn't drop out like ross perot
[1:53:39.540 --> 1:53:45.940]  yeah but ross perot was kind of bought and sold by the the other side to to you know
[1:53:45.940 --> 1:53:49.700]  paid the way for bill clinton to come into office and he didn't maybe realize it but
[1:53:49.700 --> 1:53:56.980]  that's what he did to split the vote but uh if romney votes for impeachment now that it takes
[1:53:56.980 --> 1:54:01.780]  two-thirds of the senate that means they've got to have you know dozen republicans go along
[1:54:01.780 --> 1:54:06.580]  but if they're going to run romney in his place and i think romney wants to run for president again
[1:54:07.140 --> 1:54:12.660]  i think they're going to have to have him vote against impeachment so that he's clear with romney
[1:54:12.660 --> 1:54:18.580]  with trump supporters and then have other rhino republicans vote for impeachment and get the
[1:54:18.580 --> 1:54:23.700]  president out now i'm not sure it's going to work but jeff flake was very clear there's about 35
[1:54:23.700 --> 1:54:29.060]  senators that secretly want trump out of the way and would vote for impeachment if it didn't embarrass
[1:54:29.060 --> 1:54:33.380]  them well it's going to embarrass them if they do it openly and that's the big problem that the
[1:54:33.380 --> 1:54:39.860]  republicans have and now they're talking about whistleblowers testifying in via cctv camera with
[1:54:39.860 --> 1:54:44.340]  their faces blacked out that's never been done where you can't even face your accuser they can just
[1:54:44.340 --> 1:54:51.300]  make up whatever they want i mean this is all getting very very cost-fasc yes it is and it's
[1:54:51.300 --> 1:54:56.980]  it's creating the political divide even stronger the united states against those that see that these
[1:54:56.980 --> 1:55:03.380]  controlled freaks these socialists and things are adamant for power and you know the trump is the
[1:55:03.380 --> 1:55:09.220]  only one standing against them incompetent as he is to actually fight the battle he is verbalizing
[1:55:09.220 --> 1:55:15.700]  what everybody wants and that's why his speeches are so tremendous i wish to god that he had the
[1:55:15.700 --> 1:55:20.580]  intelligence and the experience to be able to follow through with what his speech writers are
[1:55:20.580 --> 1:55:29.140]  writing for him but i i'm fearful that this isn't going to end well alex i have that feeling too i
[1:55:29.140 --> 1:55:34.900]  have a real feeling of dread the crews noticed it you know with me i mean i it's just it's it's
[1:55:35.860 --> 1:55:39.700]  this is just incredible and the chai comms exercising they're well over us now that all
[1:55:39.700 --> 1:55:44.580]  being out in the open and big tech groveling it it's it's disgusting at least we're on air at
[1:55:44.580 --> 1:55:49.140]  least a lot of people are awake at these speeches he's giving her dynamite i mean it's absolutely
[1:55:49.140 --> 1:55:55.460]  like sunlight to vampires so they got bad to be if hillary was in though wow well hillary's gonna
[1:55:55.460 --> 1:56:01.380]  run again she's setting herself up and all of the other candidates are shooting themselves in
[1:56:01.380 --> 1:56:06.580]  the foot joe biden is dead there's no way he can go up against trump marnie's still in the hospital
[1:56:07.460 --> 1:56:12.100]  that's right and uh he'll stay there and do five more minutes with us i'm gonna get your look

[1:58:06.420 --> 1:58:12.580]  minion oliver darcy have made it their life's mission to take patriots off the air into censor us
[1:58:12.580 --> 1:58:16.580]  and of course he famously said along with many others that trump is the info wars president
[1:58:16.580 --> 1:58:22.420]  president trump's furious reaction to facebook's action showcases that he is i'm sorry to say

[1:59:20.020 --> 1:59:24.980]  against the truly satanic forces of the new world order who've really taken the mask off
[1:59:24.980 --> 1:59:30.820]  the lines in the sand for everybody now but you'd already chosen to fight the corruption and to
[1:59:30.820 --> 1:59:35.060]  stand with god and to stand with the unborn so i just want to take time out again to salute the
[1:59:35.060 --> 1:59:40.660]  audience because you are truly activist in the arena and without you and your prayers and your

[2:00:08.340 --> 2:00:14.900]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's alex jones
[2:00:14.900 --> 2:00:22.900]  you know i'm not trying to be dramatic but there's articles up on info wars that isn't
[2:00:22.900 --> 2:00:27.700]  right that are like you know america takes its last gasp i don't think that's the case but
[2:00:28.660 --> 2:00:32.340]  we're on the knife's edge at which we were going to go and if you don't probably feel the danger
[2:00:32.340 --> 2:00:37.460]  like standing at the edge of a cliff uh or pulling a pet out of a hang grenade and sitting there
[2:00:37.460 --> 2:00:42.020]  with it in your hand something's wrong with you jones calzen what would you call this period of
[2:00:42.020 --> 2:00:49.540]  time we're in and then i held you over uh just to give your prognosis well i guess it isn't over yet
[2:00:49.540 --> 2:00:56.820]  i guess give your diagnosis uh on the on this incredible campaign we see right now because i
[2:00:56.820 --> 2:01:01.220]  agree hillary's always been intending to run i've talked to people that are around or they say no she
[2:01:01.220 --> 2:01:05.220]  still runs a democratic party and that they intend to have trump all embroiled in impeachment
[2:01:05.860 --> 2:01:09.140]  and that they think he'll be gone i mean that's now again they're delusional
[2:01:09.140 --> 2:01:14.020]  so maybe they're not going to act but they have the look in their eye the behavior all the actions
[2:01:14.580 --> 2:01:20.580]  the knives are out they're going for trump well and they're also going coming for conservatives
[2:01:20.580 --> 2:01:25.700]  and their guns uh it's very very clear that this is a crucial election the 2020 election
[2:01:26.260 --> 2:01:32.500]  is going to decide whether we ever as conservatives win another election again or not now i personally
[2:01:32.500 --> 2:01:38.580]  think we've already lost the majority the effective majority if it weren't for trump's populism pulling
[2:01:38.580 --> 2:01:44.420]  in people from outside the conservative and libertarian movement he wouldn't have won in 2016
[2:01:44.420 --> 2:01:50.420]  and he wouldn't win in 2020 but he is capable of bringing in that wider basket of votes uh and so
[2:01:51.140 --> 2:01:57.060]  if the democrats win if hillary clinton runs again and wins again it's going to be a juggernaut
[2:01:58.740 --> 2:02:03.620]  against gun owners and things and there's certainly going to be you know some legislation it won't be
[2:02:03.620 --> 2:02:09.460]  an all-out gun ban at first they're still going to do it slowly but i think by 2024
[2:02:10.740 --> 2:02:14.580]  probably gun rights will be gone in the united states that's how long it will take even for
[2:02:14.580 --> 2:02:19.300]  the democrats they remember the last time they banned assault weapons and got lost a lot of people
[2:02:19.300 --> 2:02:28.100]  in in congress but if we if trump cannot win again uh with this onslaught against him it's
[2:02:28.100 --> 2:02:32.020]  going to show that we're going to be in the permanent minority and then everything changes
[2:02:32.020 --> 2:02:36.820]  because unfortunately we're in a raw democracy now we're not in a constitutional republic anymore
[2:02:36.820 --> 2:02:42.180]  there are no limitations on what congress can do this the the courts are controlled by the deep
[2:02:42.180 --> 2:02:47.620]  state as well as most members in congress through nsa spying and the dirt that they have on them
[2:02:48.820 --> 2:02:53.060]  so it's only through the office of donald trump that we've been able to survive
[2:02:53.060 --> 2:02:58.660]  this long another four years god literally gave us trump as a reprieve as the last chance
[2:02:58.660 --> 2:03:02.020]  to say you're really sure you want to do this america i think we're being given
[2:03:02.020 --> 2:03:06.500]  that last chance that we see historically and biblically that tends to come before real judgment
[2:03:07.940 --> 2:03:11.860]  but it's important for your listeners to understand that it isn't the slow or the even
[2:03:11.860 --> 2:03:17.460]  quickening of the socialist agenda that's going to take down this nation the real threat is russian
[2:03:17.460 --> 2:03:22.260]  china intending to strike the west and the u.s is going to let that first strike fall and get us
[2:03:22.260 --> 2:03:27.380]  into a global new world order and if you see how tough it's been for the uk to get out of the e u
[2:03:27.380 --> 2:03:32.260]  you just try after world war three getting out of the global government it's not going to happen
[2:03:32.980 --> 2:03:39.300]  and so that's the real ultimate threat that's when you have prison camps on a global basis
[2:03:39.300 --> 2:03:44.660]  taking down people who believe in conspiracy it's not just banning their videos we're looking at a
[2:03:44.660 --> 2:03:50.420]  major onslaught of prison camps against people who believe in conspiracy because that is the
[2:03:50.420 --> 2:03:55.460]  target ultimate that you and i they want total submission they want to sterilize the children
[2:03:55.460 --> 2:03:59.780]  brain chip everybody total world government it's all being announced joel can you believe you were
[2:03:59.780 --> 2:04:05.860]  talking about this 40 something years ago your famous uncle sep 65 70 years ago and now it's just
[2:04:05.860 --> 2:04:12.340]  all out in the open joel yeah it's happening as we speak and yet how many americans are still fat
[2:04:12.340 --> 2:04:16.660]  dumb and happy listen to the evening news and don't see it that's what omitting the truth does
[2:04:16.660 --> 2:04:22.580]  that's why your band video is so important alex because finally there's an alternative to youtube
[2:04:22.580 --> 2:04:28.660]  to get these banned videos and opinions out there in the open and i applaud you for it well thank you
[2:04:28.660 --> 2:04:33.380]  i mean we plan to get even more contributors we are so there's big events news reporters and other
[2:04:33.380 --> 2:04:37.300]  people have a place where they can put something where it's not going to be blocked because anything
[2:04:37.300 --> 2:04:42.180]  viral that exposes tyranny like hillary falling down three years ago uh now that would never be
[2:04:42.180 --> 2:04:46.020]  allowed up they took it down back then but then it had to go back up but now they've got control
[2:04:46.020 --> 2:04:51.140]  so uh that that's why things like band on video are checkmate for them because it'll uh bypass
[2:04:51.140 --> 2:04:56.900]  them thank you jose calzen god bless you sir my pleasure alex and help your subscribers remember

[2:05:22.900 --> 2:05:27.940]  one thing to hear out of your radio listeners powerful but if you see it it's all at band

[2:05:44.340 --> 2:05:49.460]  trump all of us incredible things are happening and we're sharing the ideas that are going to
[2:05:49.460 --> 2:05:55.300]  defeat the tyrants at band dot video and i gotta tell you we've done great video work we've done
[2:05:55.300 --> 2:06:00.260]  great films we've done so much but websites are not our thing well now they are i'm so proud of
[2:06:00.260 --> 2:06:03.380]  band on video folks check it out there's a lot of new features band on video
[2:06:03.380 --> 2:06:19.300]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[2:06:33.380 --> 2:06:38.580]  well ladies and gentlemen i've been interviewing leah stranahan for a long time to be with us
[2:06:38.580 --> 2:06:43.140]  about 40 after or so that i'm going to get into south park being banned in china and the nba and
[2:06:43.140 --> 2:06:48.260]  that huge five that's really waking a lot of people up but leah stranahan i hear his name on
[2:06:48.260 --> 2:06:51.940]  the streets all the time people call in about him they're like wow he's doing a lot of really great
[2:06:51.940 --> 2:06:56.660]  investigative journalism uh he's worked for major conservative publications like bright marty's worked
[2:06:56.660 --> 2:07:03.540]  for uh you know leftist publications uh out there as well i covered in post he has a syndicated radio
[2:07:03.540 --> 2:07:09.540]  and tv show and he writes for the populist but he has done a bunch of investigations into what's
[2:07:09.540 --> 2:07:16.340]  really happening with ukraine and what's really happening with these whistleblowers and the real
[2:07:16.340 --> 2:07:23.300]  corruption of hillary and biden and honor biden and mit romney and these neocons and the billions
[2:07:23.300 --> 2:07:29.220]  that got laundered out during the ongoing conflict of the last decade they're not just
[2:07:29.220 --> 2:07:35.940]  a civil war uh of the last five years and he's interviewed some of the real whistleblowers
[2:07:35.940 --> 2:07:40.820]  and all of this and he also has a lot of great analysis on the impeachment but now they're
[2:07:40.820 --> 2:07:48.340]  announcing that they are looking to hold these hearings with a video feed with a blacked out
[2:07:48.340 --> 2:07:54.980]  face of whoever the whistleblowers are now the first whistleblower was third person now the new
[2:07:54.980 --> 2:08:02.100]  whistleblower is second person and is the person that reportedly worked with the first whistleblower
[2:08:02.100 --> 2:08:10.820]  so it's a cia feedback loop and we're going to be going over all of that here today we'll also
[2:08:10.820 --> 2:08:16.500]  look at pat robertson i've mentioned him i haven't gotten to the clip uh basically saying
[2:08:16.500 --> 2:08:23.380]  that trump's about to lose the uh you know divine uh mandate of heaven that's a chi com statement
[2:08:23.380 --> 2:08:33.060]  literally i mean things are reaching twilight zone level situations but here he is some of the
[2:08:33.060 --> 2:08:42.180]  headlines house democrats consider masking identity of whistleblower boom rush limbaugh plays clip of
[2:08:42.180 --> 2:08:47.220]  clapper audio admitting obama made them spy on trump when i saw this morning i said he said that
[2:08:47.220 --> 2:08:51.140]  two years ago in a year ago no this is news we've got all three of those clips yeah they're down
[2:08:51.140 --> 2:08:54.980]  blaming obama which is true of course it was higher than him but it shows rats are leaving the
[2:08:54.980 --> 2:09:02.900]  sinking ship so that's the information that we've uh got right there so let's go ahead and go to
[2:09:02.900 --> 2:09:12.180]  least ran a hand uh right now uh coming up uh at the start of the next segment let's go ahead
[2:09:12.180 --> 2:09:21.140]  and do this let's play the clapper clip and this is one of the obama intelligence minions
[2:09:21.940 --> 2:09:26.500]  who famously lied to congress like brennan did and said there was no surveillance of trump
[2:09:26.500 --> 2:09:33.380]  there was a surveillance of americans period here he is just recently saying it and again he said it
[2:09:33.380 --> 2:09:40.020]  last year and then he said it two years ago so understand they said back at the time that oh
[2:09:40.020 --> 2:09:46.900]  don't worry we're going to bust trump because we were listening to him and know he's a russian spy
[2:09:47.460 --> 2:09:51.300]  well everybody went wow that's illegal if you don't have warrants well they didn't have warrants
[2:09:51.300 --> 2:09:55.300]  so they went went in parallel constructed you're already legally surveilling you then go
[2:09:55.300 --> 2:10:01.140]  up and you create a new investigation you have new whistleblowers or new informants who make up a
[2:10:01.140 --> 2:10:07.540]  story they they go to the court they lie to then get you a warrant to claim that you were legally
[2:10:07.540 --> 2:10:12.420]  spying on people but then you use the spying to insert this info into it so that's what i'd call
[2:10:12.420 --> 2:10:22.740]  a dirty parallel construction so here again is clapper as you know the president now has
[2:10:22.740 --> 2:10:27.460]  uh sitting members of this government the of the attorney general traveling the world now
[2:10:27.460 --> 2:10:33.700]  meeting with us intelligence partners uh trying to find out in his view whether they participated
[2:10:33.700 --> 2:10:39.860]  in some sort of obama administration led effort to undermine uh president trump in the last election
[2:10:39.860 --> 2:10:45.780]  here uh you also know that john durham uh who is a former prosecutor senior justice
[2:10:45.780 --> 2:10:50.580]  department official he's pursuing his own investigation on the origins of that probe
[2:10:50.580 --> 2:10:56.820]  so are you concerned that that bars or durham's investigation will will find wrongdoing and
[2:10:56.820 --> 2:11:04.900]  sink to seek to punish uh former intelligence officials well i don't i don't know i i uh i
[2:11:04.900 --> 2:11:10.260]  don't i don't think there was any wrongdoing i think at the time all of us were trying to
[2:11:10.260 --> 2:11:17.460]  navigate a very very difficult politically fraught highly charged situation uh i know for my part
[2:11:17.460 --> 2:11:23.860]  my main concern was with the russians and the threat posed by the russians uh to our
[2:11:24.500 --> 2:11:31.060]  our very political fabric and uh the message i'm getting from all this is apparently what
[2:11:31.060 --> 2:11:36.820]  we were supposed to have done was to ignore the russian interference ignore the russian meddling
[2:11:36.820 --> 2:11:44.100]  and the threat that it poses to us and oh by the way uh blown off what the then commander chief the
[2:11:44.100 --> 2:11:48.580]  president obama told us to do which was to assemble all the reporting that we could
[2:11:49.300 --> 2:11:54.740]  that we had available to us and put it in one report that the president could pass on to the
[2:11:54.740 --> 2:12:01.460]  congress and to the next administration and while we're at it uh declassify as much as we possibly
[2:12:01.460 --> 2:12:08.980]  could to make it public and that and that's what we did so that's a clip from yesterday
[2:12:08.980 --> 2:12:19.460]  and that's clapper former head of national intelligence on cnn issuing the nurenberg
[2:12:19.460 --> 2:12:25.540]  defense the nazis at the nurenberg trials in 1946 harman glering and the rest of them
[2:12:26.580 --> 2:12:33.620]  said hey we were following orders of our military commander adolf hitler and so
[2:12:34.340 --> 2:12:38.900]  when i saw this a year and a half ago i said uh oh they know rats are leaving the singing
[2:12:38.900 --> 2:12:42.340]  ship they know they've committed crimes they know they're being looked at by grand juries
[2:12:42.340 --> 2:12:48.500]  so they said hey the commander in chief told me so so that's yesterday here he is a year ago here's
[2:12:48.500 --> 2:12:54.820]  clapper again the work for president obama we might not have done the intelligence community
[2:12:54.820 --> 2:13:00.500]  assessment that we did that set off a whole sequence of events which are still unfolding today
[2:13:00.500 --> 2:13:06.500]  notably special counsel molars investigation president obama is responsible for that and
[2:13:06.500 --> 2:13:11.220]  was he who tasked us to do that intelligence community assessment uh in the first place
[2:13:11.220 --> 2:13:19.940]  i think so it's it's he who tasked us intelligence assessment illegally spying then they go oh
[2:13:19.940 --> 2:13:25.300]  trump got elected hillary's not in you got to go parallel constructs you got to go
[2:13:25.300 --> 2:13:31.140]  to the fires of court you got to make up all these reasons you're going at for trump you've
[2:13:31.140 --> 2:13:35.460]  got to have all these intelligence operatives go out and talk to all his campaign people
[2:13:35.460 --> 2:13:40.500]  down to low level and tell them you've got stuff from the russians well none of them even bit
[2:13:43.860 --> 2:13:50.020]  but they convicted papadopoulos of forgetting somebody who had a connection to russians talk
[2:13:50.020 --> 2:13:58.820]  to him at a bar and of course that person was m i six so it goes on and on and on and folks i've
[2:13:58.820 --> 2:14:04.580]  had them i've had the democrats try to pull the crap where they have the russians reach out with
[2:14:04.580 --> 2:14:10.980]  money and of course i call the fbi and send a letter to the fbi and it was not hell i went
[2:14:10.980 --> 2:14:22.020]  into the fbi it was not the russians okay that's how out of control all this is and
[2:14:24.980 --> 2:14:30.820]  it's ridiculous at least ran a hand i'm not keeping him on hold it's i love technology
[2:14:30.820 --> 2:14:36.660]  but it's got more and more bugs on it because it's all got surveillance on it and skype and all
[2:14:36.660 --> 2:14:41.220]  these browsers and all these systems not not just skype i know skype is a communication system on
[2:14:41.220 --> 2:14:46.100]  a browser but but they've all got stuff piggybacked on them and that's why they have so many problems
[2:14:46.100 --> 2:14:50.500]  today and it's been like a haunted house around here with with the equipment and everybody else's
[2:14:50.500 --> 2:14:54.260]  equipment's been like a haunted house so that's nobody's fault it's kind of what's fun about live
[2:14:54.260 --> 2:15:00.580]  radio what's fun about live tv and at least skype is working soon we'll do something old
[2:15:00.580 --> 2:15:07.700]  fashioned called the landline if he still has a landline it's an old joe rogan skit from like
[2:15:07.700 --> 2:15:15.860]  2000 i saw him do it live and uh he's like man the world back when i was a kid you know back
[2:15:15.860 --> 2:15:22.180]  in the early 70s we all thought by the year 2000 we'd be flying around in silver spacesuits with
[2:15:22.180 --> 2:15:27.140]  jetpacks instead of the year 2000s here and i get behind a bush and my cell phone craps out
[2:15:27.140 --> 2:15:32.740]  and that's absolutely true and all the studies show us technology does not make us happy technology
[2:15:32.740 --> 2:15:38.100]  makes us depressed it makes us really more alone we don't have really valuable interactions because
[2:15:38.100 --> 2:15:43.540]  of it whereas going fishing or camping or hiking or in the forest that empowers us that brings us
[2:15:43.540 --> 2:15:47.620]  back closer to god and i know i'm saying something incredibly simple here but it's the simple things
[2:15:47.620 --> 2:15:51.460]  that are really the most powerful aren't they so least ran of hands coming up and then i'm going
[2:15:51.460 --> 2:15:57.540]  to air the incredibly informative south park you talk about genius i don't even want to you know

[2:21:39.300 --> 2:21:43.780]  having me over the years as well you know i've been covering this story for about two and a half
[2:21:43.780 --> 2:21:50.180]  years i've been saying everything we've been seeing about this russia gate story for the past three
[2:21:50.180 --> 2:21:59.540]  years now uh all comes down to ukraine and for a long time alex for years now nobody would listen
[2:21:59.540 --> 2:22:05.220]  and even when every time i would talk about ukraine i was like screaming into the desert and the one
[2:22:05.220 --> 2:22:11.860]  outlet that consistently has been having me on you david night other people has been info wars
[2:22:11.860 --> 2:22:18.820]  and i've got to say this is the biggest information war that's what we're seeing right now they are
[2:22:18.820 --> 2:22:23.460]  trying to hide the truth about this from the american people that's what they're trying to do
[2:22:24.100 --> 2:22:30.020]  and uh so let's let's go over this you know some people are calling this russia gate 2.0
[2:22:30.020 --> 2:22:37.460]  but really alex this is russia gate 0.9 this is where it started and the reason i say that
[2:22:38.020 --> 2:22:46.100]  is that this was a plan by the democrats to tie donald trump to russia that they had and let's
[2:22:46.100 --> 2:22:51.780]  be clear you've been coming on the show specifically about this for three years since it ever began
[2:22:51.780 --> 2:22:56.740]  you but at the tip of the spear here explaining that the way to bring down the deep state is ukraine
[2:22:56.740 --> 2:23:01.300]  they realize that so they're turning it around against trump just like they did russia that's
[2:23:01.300 --> 2:23:06.500]  right and they're accusing him of what they've been doing so here's the reality here's the reality
[2:23:06.500 --> 2:23:12.660]  that the the the hoax is that trump colluded with russia now that seemed to fall apart in the
[2:23:12.660 --> 2:23:18.260]  Mueller investigation and so what you're seeing now is they're trying to do a cover-up of the actual
[2:23:18.260 --> 2:23:25.620]  story the actual story was the democrats colluded with the government of ukraine that they put into
[2:23:25.620 --> 2:23:31.940]  power remember what happened in 2014 with the so-called people's coup that was not that was a
[2:23:31.940 --> 2:23:37.460]  that was the revolution of dignity they call it that was not the revolution of dignity what that
[2:23:37.460 --> 2:23:45.300]  was alex was that was a coup put into place by the obama administration set up by hillary clinton
[2:23:45.300 --> 2:23:52.740]  and people like victoria newland who she put into place and people like john carrey who was the
[2:23:52.740 --> 2:23:57.620]  secretary of state at the time so let's just go back to that real briefly you got to start there
[2:23:59.220 --> 2:24:06.100]  in 2013 they used occupy style tactics to do what was called the euro madame right they called it
[2:24:06.100 --> 2:24:13.380]  the euro madame and it was supposedly like occupy wall street organic you know an organic movement
[2:24:13.380 --> 2:24:20.260]  and because i'd covered occupy wall street i knew the tactics and my ears perked up and i said this
[2:24:20.260 --> 2:24:27.460]  is not organic this is something that is being funded and sure enough it's funded by george soros
[2:24:27.460 --> 2:24:34.740]  who has the biggest ngo non-government organization in ukraine called international renaissance
[2:24:34.740 --> 2:24:42.340]  now all anybody has to do to figure this out is go to youtube look up victoria newland ukraine
[2:24:42.340 --> 2:24:50.420]  brag and you'll see that victoria newland brag that eight billion dollars in us tax dollars was used to
[2:24:50.420 --> 2:24:57.380]  subvert ukraine then you can look up george soros and his international renaissance and he's also
[2:24:57.380 --> 2:25:04.020]  bragged about it so again not conjecture alex this is the facts then what they did was after the
[2:25:04.020 --> 2:25:10.020]  after they threw out the democratically elected government of ukraine janikovic after they did
[2:25:10.020 --> 2:25:16.020]  that they put into place the government they wanted through this guy petro poroshenko now
[2:25:16.660 --> 2:25:22.980]  how did this work out for the people of ukraine right the citizens of ukraine answer ukraine
[2:25:22.980 --> 2:25:30.980]  became the poorest country in europe and petro poroshenko was voted out eventually by a comedian
[2:25:30.980 --> 2:25:35.780]  named solinsky that's the president who trump was on the phone with and the reason he got voted out
[2:25:35.780 --> 2:25:44.260]  alex poroshenko was the least popular leader in the world he had a six percent approval rating
[2:25:44.900 --> 2:25:50.740]  right before the elec he presided over the looting by the deep state of that wealthy country
[2:25:51.380 --> 2:25:56.900]  ukraine so so now we move forward yeah that's right and and he and he's important now let's
[2:25:56.900 --> 2:26:02.020]  talk about the audio we'll play this after the break but the viceroy the person who was the
[2:26:02.020 --> 2:26:09.300]  point person as you'll hear in this audio was joe biden and joe biden ran that country he was the
[2:26:09.300 --> 2:26:15.380]  fixer they called him uncle joe you'll hear all of this so the other thing is uh there's an article
[2:26:15.380 --> 2:26:24.260]  that came out in politico in january of of 2017 right before the inauguration politico ken bogel
[2:26:24.260 --> 2:26:30.020]  he's not a easel lib he's not a trump supporter but it was a well reported article alex and it
[2:26:30.020 --> 2:26:37.060]  detailed this collusion and how a woman named alexandric chalupa a deep state dnc operative
[2:26:37.700 --> 2:26:45.060]  was right behind this and she what she had done is at the at the 2016 the beginning of 2016
[2:26:45.060 --> 2:26:52.100]  she went to the ukrainian embassy and she with the help of the ambassador ambassador chale
[2:26:52.100 --> 2:26:58.820]  and this woman named oxana chalur who ran the embassy they told she came in she said i'm with
[2:26:58.820 --> 2:27:05.620]  the hillary clinton campaign and they told a guy named andre tell zenko who worked there don't
[2:27:05.620 --> 2:27:11.860]  coordinate with trump and we're looking for dirt on trump now this is all in that political article
[2:27:11.860 --> 2:27:17.700]  alex it's all right there in black and white and what they're petrified about now is people
[2:27:17.700 --> 2:27:25.060]  like ron johnson did you see him going you know toe to toe with chuck todd on meet the press yes
[2:27:25.060 --> 2:27:33.060]  he brought up this article they the media is scared to death that you or anybody out there
[2:27:33.060 --> 2:27:37.540]  is going to read this because it's very well reported and by the way we're not bragging here
[2:27:38.660 --> 2:27:46.020]  i literally had you and a bunch of other people on including in studio during the trump campaign
[2:27:46.660 --> 2:27:51.220]  talking about all the ukraine stuff and how this was the way to bring down hillary and the rest of
[2:27:51.220 --> 2:27:57.380]  them and so it's just asinine now to have them turn all this around and make it criminal
[2:27:58.820 --> 2:28:03.460]  if trump was saying to somebody wow just see joe biden bragging he got the prosecutor fired for
[2:28:03.460 --> 2:28:08.420]  investigating his son that's like bragging about killing people on tv it's just incredible
[2:28:08.420 --> 2:28:14.100]  how they've turned this all around but that shows you why because they're so scared that's exactly
[2:28:14.100 --> 2:28:20.420]  right and and here's the thing alex this is where the info wars come in because in fact
[2:28:20.420 --> 2:28:25.780]  every media outlet cnn's been part of a cover-up the washington post has been part of a cover-up
[2:28:26.340 --> 2:28:31.220]  but people can find this article read it for themselves and go gee there's something going
[2:28:31.220 --> 2:28:36.340]  on here so when we come back from the break i'm going to play you exclusive audio an interview i did

[2:32:09.460 --> 2:32:16.020]  he is working for american interests steadfastly he is trying to preserve our country as the
[2:32:16.020 --> 2:32:21.380]  globalists try to break our borders bankrupt and devalue our dollar and sign us over to communist
[2:32:21.380 --> 2:32:26.740]  chinese control who now own hollywood and the majority of our debt we have been maneuvered
[2:32:26.740 --> 2:32:32.900]  towards collapse and bankruptcy but at the 11th hour 58th minute the american people put a populist
[2:32:32.900 --> 2:32:38.340]  in power and it's happening all over the world so great things are happening but the enemy is
[2:32:38.340 --> 2:32:44.020]  striking back you're very serious with this impeachment plan it has bipartisan support

[2:33:02.260 --> 2:33:22.820]  ladies and gentlemen 50 percent off you're listening to the alex jones show big brother
[2:33:22.820 --> 2:33:35.700]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he live from austin texas
[2:33:35.700 --> 2:33:44.740]  broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones now i want to be clear most of our audience tunes
[2:33:44.740 --> 2:33:49.860]  and routine basis you already heard us talking about this three years ago you already know all
[2:33:49.860 --> 2:33:54.180]  about it but remember we're on a lot of radio stations and tv stations and we're like number
[2:33:54.180 --> 2:33:59.620]  one on cloud tv and a bunch of the systems there are literally hundreds of thousands of new viewers
[2:33:59.620 --> 2:34:04.900]  and listeners every hour conservatively that's a low number that are tuned in and they don't know
[2:34:04.900 --> 2:34:10.100]  any of this they literally believe uh that trump's done something corrupt in ukraine
[2:34:11.380 --> 2:34:16.100]  and this is the reality management the war on reality going on because you got a bunch of
[2:34:16.100 --> 2:34:23.460]  republicans involved second off of the crisis off the war zone uh off the looting of ukraine
[2:34:24.660 --> 2:34:28.980]  this has been going on a long time and you've got these big boards that republicans are on and
[2:34:28.980 --> 2:34:35.060]  that nancy polosi's son is on and so i mean i got to say lee strana hand is one of the top
[2:34:35.060 --> 2:34:41.460]  two or three people that have been really dug into this uh exposing it and and that's another reason
[2:34:41.460 --> 2:34:51.300]  that they want us off air is because we have these type of guests on the broadcast that other people
[2:34:51.860 --> 2:34:56.020]  in the establishment don't want you to hear i mean you heard lee said you've been the most
[2:34:56.020 --> 2:34:59.940]  continuous person as this has developed to have me on well i mean the guy's the great
[2:34:59.940 --> 2:35:05.380]  investigative journalist and and now you see how important ukraine is because like i said china
[2:35:05.380 --> 2:35:10.500]  buying up our media controlling what people can say behind the scenes for 10 years almost every
[2:35:10.500 --> 2:35:16.260]  script has to be approved by the chinese government and i would say that to people
[2:35:17.780 --> 2:35:23.700]  and people thought i was crazy because that would be crazy wouldn't it we would never allow that
[2:35:25.220 --> 2:35:32.580]  now the nba is apologizing to the chi-coms major video game makers are apologizing um
[2:35:32.580 --> 2:35:36.340]  they're they're they're stopping video game tournaments that have millions of viewers
[2:35:36.340 --> 2:35:43.380]  and kicking top stars off because they support hong kong independence that's the real world folks
[2:35:43.380 --> 2:35:50.020]  this isn't a game and so yes we're next year's news today hillary and the globalist because
[2:35:50.020 --> 2:35:54.420]  he's already going to be running again knew that we helped get trump in so they looked at everything
[2:35:54.420 --> 2:36:01.060]  i'd ever done my timeline imagine like a powerpoint timeline or like a uh computer timeline on final
[2:36:01.060 --> 2:36:06.180]  cut pro or uh premiere editing you've got all these little thousands of clips that's what we've done
[2:36:06.180 --> 2:36:12.020]  on air hundreds of thousands of clips really and they just zoom in on a few little sub areas
[2:36:12.020 --> 2:36:17.620]  like a grain of sand at the beach you go that's who i am and say oh he's discredited oh he's a liar
[2:36:17.620 --> 2:36:24.420]  oh he's a cook because if you really listen to this show you go my gosh these people really
[2:36:24.420 --> 2:36:30.500]  know what they're talking about and it's not because we're geniuses the real global governments out
[2:36:30.500 --> 2:36:34.100]  there it's in white papers the globalists communicate with each other about how they're
[2:36:34.100 --> 2:36:39.540]  getting rid of the family national sovereignty how they cut off u.s energy to build the command base
[2:36:39.540 --> 2:36:44.260]  of china because they'll have the management system the globalists want for the world i mean
[2:36:44.260 --> 2:36:49.700]  this is all david oracle filler writes op-ed pieces in the new york times praising mousetong
[2:36:49.700 --> 2:36:58.020]  and saying we need to live like that so that's what they want to solve fair that's why when you
[2:36:58.020 --> 2:37:03.220]  share bandod video or info wars dot com for slash or an article or when you tell people word of
[2:37:03.220 --> 2:37:06.980]  mouth it changes the world that's why when you buy the products it keeps us on air i mean i've been
[2:37:06.980 --> 2:37:12.580]  really stressed out trying to get the funding to keep this place going and i don't like coming to
[2:37:12.580 --> 2:37:16.740]  you with that pitch the real pitch is we got the best fish oil out there you know what fish oil
[2:37:16.740 --> 2:37:21.460]  does for your brain your heart your sleep your life if it's really good clean stuff we've got it
[2:37:21.460 --> 2:37:25.780]  you know what turmeric does for inflammation and you know fighting uh you know stuff in the body
[2:37:25.780 --> 2:37:29.780]  that's really destructive i mean just look at a tumor we got the strongest best uh you know how
[2:37:29.780 --> 2:37:35.540]  great our energy bars are and our protein bars and just it's all great it's all 50 off store
[2:37:35.540 --> 2:37:40.980]  wide free shipping and double patriot points and a bunch more right now but this is the final day
[2:37:40.980 --> 2:37:45.700]  so lee i want to invite you back up especially when your skype's working again uh you know to
[2:37:45.700 --> 2:37:52.260]  come on and get into impeachment because i wanted to hit the ukraine canard and and then that ties
[2:37:52.260 --> 2:37:57.780]  into the impeachment and all your inside baseball you live in dc and have a lot of great sources
[2:37:57.780 --> 2:38:01.220]  but of course we have to cover what really happened to ukraine before we ever get to that point
[2:38:01.860 --> 2:38:04.900]  but but finishing up on that and playing this clip from when you did interview the
[2:38:04.900 --> 2:38:08.180]  whistleblower i'm told you haven't heard this piece yet so this is exclusive
[2:38:08.180 --> 2:38:10.820]  i correct me if i'm wrong but i don't care either way it's important history
[2:38:11.540 --> 2:38:15.860]  and then just just briefly on impeachment and i mean i think this is very serious this time
[2:38:15.860 --> 2:38:20.100]  they're making their move now other stuff was just priming the pump getting ready because
[2:38:20.100 --> 2:38:25.700]  trump's threatening the bipartisan corruption state uh that they're really gonna make their move
[2:38:25.700 --> 2:38:31.860]  uh give me your view on both places well yeah this impeachment this is part of the cover-up
[2:38:31.860 --> 2:38:36.180]  of what really happened that's what they want to do alex they want to cover up the involvement
[2:38:36.180 --> 2:38:42.260]  now what you're about to hear this audio is shocking and i got to tell you if this audio
[2:38:42.260 --> 2:38:48.820]  were about donald trump it would be on every network immediately they would cut into programming
[2:38:48.820 --> 2:38:54.020]  play it for people what you're going to hear is a guy named andrei telizenko now andrei
[2:38:54.020 --> 2:39:00.340]  was the whistleblower featured in that political article i it took me a year to get this guy to
[2:39:00.340 --> 2:39:06.500]  talk to me and the reason is because i host a show on sputnik so that's russian-funded media
[2:39:06.500 --> 2:39:12.580]  and this guy is a ukrainian patriot and he was skeptical but i got to tell you they've been
[2:39:12.580 --> 2:39:18.340]  very good to me it's sputnik they let me do what i do otherwise i'd quit and so what you're about
[2:39:18.340 --> 2:39:25.460]  to hear is an interview i did months ago with andrei and he explained to me the role of joe
[2:39:25.460 --> 2:39:35.140]  biden and also what happened when that political article came out in january of 2017 joe biden
[2:39:35.140 --> 2:39:42.180]  was in ukraine a few days after that article came out and alex i want you to hear what joe biden
[2:39:42.180 --> 2:39:46.900]  now again this guy's a whistleblower let me explain when they came to him and said hey
[2:39:46.900 --> 2:39:54.020]  don't help the trump campaign we're just going to work with hillary we're looking for dirt on
[2:39:54.020 --> 2:40:01.300]  trump andrei partially because he's by the way partially because he's a christian alex he said
[2:40:01.300 --> 2:40:09.060]  this is wrong this is immoral and this is also stupid because he's he's also a a smart political
[2:40:09.060 --> 2:40:15.860]  player i want you to hear this this is what happened when joe biden read that political
[2:40:15.860 --> 2:40:22.900]  article let's hear that clip he used to come here and tell people what to do he used to tell
[2:40:22.900 --> 2:40:29.060]  who to fire he used to tell who to hire he used to tell who to support and that's how it went
[2:40:29.060 --> 2:40:34.420]  and that's how the democrats ruled here with him if nobody else could solve things he would come in
[2:40:34.420 --> 2:40:42.820]  and solve them yeah right right i basically his last thing with poroshenko i know what happened
[2:40:42.820 --> 2:40:46.660]  because basically that's when the political article came out when he was here before the
[2:40:46.660 --> 2:40:51.380]  integration and i know what happened what they talked about biden basically gave him this to
[2:40:51.380 --> 2:40:57.620]  poroshenko and said you fucked up because it all leaked to the press about what we were working on
[2:40:58.580 --> 2:41:05.220]  that's when poroshenko called me in that night poroshenko called you in yeah when when the
[2:41:05.220 --> 2:41:09.940]  political article came out that was when biden wasn't here that night when a week before the
[2:41:09.940 --> 2:41:15.620]  integration i think the 11th of january yeah and so and what what happened when poroshenko called
[2:41:15.620 --> 2:41:21.780]  you they yelled at me for the article because i leaked everything to the political to about the
[2:41:21.780 --> 2:41:27.460]  dmc stuff on on the political article because i don't think i i don't think i knew so poroshenko
[2:41:27.460 --> 2:41:34.500]  personally yelled at you yeah he called me up to his office i was working with the former
[2:41:34.500 --> 2:41:40.020]  proctor general yaram at the time consulting him on private issues basically a private national self
[2:41:40.020 --> 2:41:45.540]  and he called him up and he called me up together and he yelled at me for an hour
[2:41:45.540 --> 2:41:51.380]  basically threatened me and whatever to block my career and my business and what am i going to do
[2:41:51.380 --> 2:41:59.620]  in ukraine yeah yeah because he was so mad because biden gave him that article biden personally gave
[2:41:59.620 --> 2:42:05.140]  him that article yes now the reason that's so massive is that is the source for the big
[2:42:05.140 --> 2:42:09.300]  political article that you see all over the news now and long before it was ever big you see
[2:42:09.300 --> 2:42:13.220]  strana hand hammering it and before i ever got published strana hand hammering it but he actually
[2:42:13.220 --> 2:42:19.620]  went out and got the source to tell you that the installed globalist that looted ukraine with the
[2:42:19.620 --> 2:42:26.260]  biden's as the viceroy that biden was very very pissed when he learned that what a window into
[2:42:26.260 --> 2:42:32.740]  these guys uh world at least rana hand and think about this alex when they're out there when everybody
[2:42:32.740 --> 2:42:38.020]  in the mainstream media is talking about whistleblowers they don't defend julian assange or a guy like
[2:42:38.020 --> 2:42:45.060]  john kiriak who is the cia whistleblower or andre telesenko they're protecting the cia and these
[2:42:45.060 --> 2:42:50.180]  guys aren't even whistleblowers so think about that this guy let's do a few more minutes on that
[2:42:50.180 --> 2:42:55.540]  because that's a great point i mean obama waged war on whistleblowers and the press and then meanwhile
[2:42:55.540 --> 2:43:00.500]  trump's done nothing to the press they act like he's at off hitler i mean it's upside down world
[2:43:00.500 --> 2:43:04.100]  then i'm getting to the clips from south park then paul watson stay with us

[2:45:20.420 --> 2:45:25.780]  communist and socialist power to the people but then meanwhile his tax exempt began offshore well
[2:45:25.780 --> 2:45:31.140]  trump got that and all these other populace get it why would you throw away wealthy successful
[2:45:31.140 --> 2:45:36.100]  countries and cultures just so you can say the communist chinese that david rockfeller put in

[2:45:43.060 --> 2:45:48.900]  humanity turn over to these people and i beg god for the strength and the will to have the discernment
[2:45:48.900 --> 2:45:54.260]  to help be part of their defeat and i've been saying that prayer for 20 plus years and god is

[2:47:16.980 --> 2:47:32.980]  god
[2:47:32.980 --> 2:47:38.980]  in the heart of texas
[2:47:38.980 --> 2:47:45.940]  the day i met you you were me as a lamb welcome back ladies and gentlemen you know i was only
[2:47:45.940 --> 2:47:49.860]  in hamley straddlehand on for two segments but he's just covering so much important stuff and
[2:47:49.860 --> 2:47:55.860]  listen i know as listeners you know that ukraine thinks fake and you know obama went in there
[2:47:55.860 --> 2:48:00.580]  with hillary and biden and looted the living hell out of it and they're on the chycom payroll the
[2:48:00.580 --> 2:48:06.980]  russian payroll if the easter bunny was real they'd be on its payroll we know that that's what globalists
[2:48:06.980 --> 2:48:11.060]  do is they sell out the the the nations they control they're just corporate raiders like
[2:48:11.060 --> 2:48:14.980]  mitt romney was a corporate raider of course he wants to be president he'd raid the country
[2:48:16.340 --> 2:48:21.380]  trump is a service guy and he wants to see a prosperous nation he really cares about the
[2:48:21.380 --> 2:48:26.180]  country and doesn't like seeing it run down the tubes by a bunch of people that have a religion
[2:48:26.180 --> 2:48:32.580]  of destroying america america was never great it'll never be that great at least train a hand i should
[2:48:32.580 --> 2:48:36.820]  have just set up front because i remember this interview we did a year ago and i knew he played
[2:48:36.820 --> 2:48:41.460]  some clips here that he's ever gotten to and i'm glad he aired that here but think about that
[2:48:44.020 --> 2:48:47.220]  because you know back then in the interview he did that was just an average thought oh get mad
[2:48:47.220 --> 2:48:52.740]  about the politico piece and show biden and you know the the president of of uh ukraine calling
[2:48:52.740 --> 2:49:02.020]  up angry but now think in context how big that is and the the hutzpah the bravada the brass wavos the uh
[2:49:02.900 --> 2:49:10.580]  confidence that hillary and all and and biden have to be on tv and say i fired that prosecutor
[2:49:10.580 --> 2:49:14.500]  you know i threatened to hold back a billion dollars quid pro quo that's a crime right there
[2:49:14.500 --> 2:49:19.940]  and then he son of a bitch got fired that's a quote how the hell are they carrying this out with a
[2:49:19.940 --> 2:49:25.460]  straight face and they're now trying to impeach the president with it and at least train a hand
[2:49:26.420 --> 2:49:30.820]  what's the word you're in dc i mean you always amaze me your sources that's what we have on
[2:49:30.820 --> 2:49:34.340]  is folks that are right over and over again you know mainstream media is trying to lie folks
[2:49:34.340 --> 2:49:38.420]  we're like political weathermen weathermen want to tell you the the answer because when they're
[2:49:38.420 --> 2:49:43.140]  right they're popular well when we're right we live in a free country so but but but we're wrong
[2:49:43.140 --> 2:49:47.940]  sometimes but maybe five percent of the time because we already kind of know where the globalists
[2:49:47.940 --> 2:49:53.860]  are going so it's a lot easier to predict than the weather so what's the current thing on impeachment
[2:49:53.860 --> 2:50:01.460]  least ran and what's the word on what's coming next as a political weatherman well i okay so
[2:50:01.460 --> 2:50:07.060]  here's what i think that the story is going to go immediately i think you've got already a the
[2:50:07.060 --> 2:50:13.060]  biggest disconnect i've ever seen between the people in the media everybody knows the media is
[2:50:13.060 --> 2:50:18.420]  lying to them you've been doing this for decades alex and you know that at first you were a conspiracy
[2:50:18.420 --> 2:50:23.540]  theorist and you were nuts and when you went to bohemian grove that was crazy now bohemian grove
[2:50:23.540 --> 2:50:29.540]  has you know the builder group has a website now where people can go up and see their own official
[2:50:29.540 --> 2:50:34.020]  website exactly if we've okay we're child molesters we worship the devil big deal move along
[2:50:34.820 --> 2:50:38.740]  that's right and now here's now we have a pretty website about it so here's what's going on
[2:50:38.740 --> 2:50:45.220]  on the disconnect is unbelievable this impeachment thing is going to blow up in their face and i'll
[2:50:45.220 --> 2:50:49.700]  tell you two places this is going to go now one of the things they've been trying to do
[2:50:49.700 --> 2:50:54.820]  you talked about hillary clinton and joe biden and the russian angle let me talk about that for a
[2:50:54.820 --> 2:51:02.580]  second i'm going to name somebody who nobody in the media ever talks about he is a russian oligarch
[2:51:02.580 --> 2:51:10.340]  he was involved in money laundering he was a criminal convicted criminal he the cia said he
[2:51:10.340 --> 2:51:16.740]  was involved in money laundering but now the cia are on his side and he was supported and i will
[2:51:16.740 --> 2:51:23.700]  say everybody can look this up there's nothing i'm no conjecture and nobody's covered it alex
[2:51:23.700 --> 2:51:28.180]  now so let's talk about you know you know you've been covering secret societies for a long time
[2:51:28.180 --> 2:51:32.820]  and you know the way a bohemian grover bill deberg works you can see in the bill deberg panel
[2:51:32.820 --> 2:51:38.580]  you got eric schmidt and peter teal two guys one a hillary supporter one a trump supporter
[2:51:38.580 --> 2:51:44.580]  they're both in the same steering committee okay so we get how that works what if i told you
[2:51:44.580 --> 2:51:52.020]  they were a russian oligarch criminal oligarch wants the richest guy in russia who was supported
[2:51:52.020 --> 2:51:59.860]  by both presidential candidates in 2008 that guy's name is michael kortikovsky kortikovsky
[2:52:00.500 --> 2:52:07.380]  was the richest man in russia because he took over yukos oil now by the way not to sound too
[2:52:07.380 --> 2:52:13.540]  conspiratorial here but after and putin put this guy in jail because he was such a criminal
[2:52:13.540 --> 2:52:19.940]  and he's wanted his revenge against putin ever since then if you look up senate resolution
[2:52:19.940 --> 2:52:26.820]  and alex do you know what the senate resolution on this is three two two that's scullin box
[2:52:27.620 --> 2:52:33.140]  so senate resolution three i'm not making this up senate i know i've seen your reports on it so
[2:52:33.140 --> 2:52:36.980]  so here's the bottom line where is it going against trump i mean i agree that it's super
[2:52:36.980 --> 2:52:41.540]  unpopular it's making trump more popular but it's going to be unpopular they blow his head off
[2:52:41.540 --> 2:52:45.860]  they intend to remove him i'm just saying gut level i'm not saying they're going to remove him
[2:52:45.860 --> 2:52:52.180]  no i i don't think they will but look look at three two two it's supported one sponsor
[2:52:52.180 --> 2:52:58.020]  joe biden two co-sponsors obama and mccain this is that russian funding you're talking about
[2:52:58.020 --> 2:53:02.660]  isn't that incredible there is there's joe biden with a bill to protect the oligarch
[2:53:03.540 --> 2:53:08.820]  that's exactly right and nobody in the media you talk about hootspot nobody in the media
[2:53:08.820 --> 2:53:16.260]  is talking about this just like mccain and obama and biden that were launching isis and al-qaeda
[2:53:16.260 --> 2:53:22.260]  in the middle east that's right but what you don't have the difference alex is i just showed you
[2:53:22.260 --> 2:53:26.820]  anybody can look this up so this is where that disconnect comes in where's this going to go
[2:53:27.460 --> 2:53:32.020]  two things are going to happen you're going to start hearing about kortikovsky that's number one
[2:53:32.020 --> 2:53:39.460]  because once the media tries to bury this it's the most obvious thing in the world
[2:53:39.460 --> 2:53:45.060]  this is the guy and the reason i mentioned kortikovsky his lawyer is a guy named jonathan
[2:53:45.060 --> 2:53:51.700]  weiner jonathan weiner alex is the guy who brought christopher steele into the state department
[2:53:51.700 --> 2:53:57.620]  look up an article called devin unies is investigating me jonathan weiner admits he's
[2:53:57.620 --> 2:54:02.820]  the guy who is being briefed in the steele dossier so when i say there's a sure so they're crazy
[2:54:02.820 --> 2:54:07.460]  to try to cover up their ukraine dealings by claiming trump's doing bad all that brings
[2:54:07.460 --> 2:54:14.340]  his more attention on them when at every level they haven't been implicated in massive crimes
[2:54:14.340 --> 2:54:19.300]  how do they think they're going to try to have a trial about trump on ukraine when all that
[2:54:19.300 --> 2:54:24.180]  does is bring them up it does sound like they think just because mainstream media is going to
[2:54:24.180 --> 2:54:29.380]  lockstep put out lies that somehow that's going to keep them coming out but info wars dot com
[2:54:29.380 --> 2:54:34.660]  is still here news wars dot com bandot video uh your great website and all these independent
[2:54:34.660 --> 2:54:39.140]  shows and the foreign press and like you said all the numbers show the american people are buying
[2:54:39.140 --> 2:54:44.180]  none of this i have people walk up to me on the street least ran a hand and say i'm not
[2:54:44.180 --> 2:54:51.060]  hard core enough thinking everything's a conspiracy alex jones is becoming passe out there in the

[3:00:55.620 --> 3:01:01.780]  world that's really what's happening we can pull back but if you admit what's happened they just hope
[3:01:01.780 --> 3:01:06.980]  big tech and everybody introduces us to chai com control and we just kind of roll over and accept
[3:01:06.980 --> 3:01:15.060]  it and die and we'll look at the left financing all this nihilistic into the world garbage how it
[3:01:15.060 --> 3:01:20.020]  ties into the joker movie and so much more all watching as the articles up on info wars.com and
[3:01:20.020 --> 3:01:26.020]  news wars.com and don't forget summit dot news his own excellent site we're redesigning info wars
[3:01:26.020 --> 3:01:32.980]  right now as well professor slams extinction rebellion as a carnival for middle classes
[3:01:32.980 --> 3:01:39.380]  who love to dress up as activists and act like they're saving the world now i mentioned this four
[3:01:39.380 --> 3:01:43.620]  or five times during the show i didn't get to it i should have led with it this is pat robertson
[3:01:44.420 --> 3:01:49.780]  hated by the left demonized he's been pro-life he's done a lot of good stuff i don't want to
[3:01:49.780 --> 3:01:56.020]  be enemies with pat robertson but let me tell you he looks like my grandmother two days before she
[3:01:56.020 --> 3:02:01.940]  died when i saw her i mean he's reading off a script that somebody else wrote and it's kind of like
[3:02:01.940 --> 3:02:07.300]  when uh what was his name uh charleston has to like to talk to a few times off air he was on the
[3:02:07.300 --> 3:02:13.540]  show a few times when they rolled him on national tv dateline mbc to say he was against guns the
[3:02:13.540 --> 3:02:18.260]  nr a and he apologized he died like two weeks later i mean his brain was gone all simmers
[3:02:18.260 --> 3:02:22.580]  he could read off a script he'd look at the script and that was it so i think that they're
[3:02:22.580 --> 3:02:27.780]  basically holding uh or pat robertson hostage but here he is quoting the chinese communist who
[3:02:27.780 --> 3:02:36.260]  picked up on this uh famous chinese emperor saying word for word i mean this is crazy here it is
[3:02:37.060 --> 3:02:43.620]  ladies and gentlemen i want to say right now i am absolutely appalled that the united states is
[3:02:43.620 --> 3:02:49.860]  going to betray those democratic forces in northern syria that we possibly going to allow the turkish
[3:02:49.860 --> 3:02:58.340]  to come in against the Kurds the odor urdogan is a thug he has taken control of his country as a
[3:02:58.340 --> 3:03:06.740]  dictator he is a strong leader and uh to you say he's an ally of america is nonsense he is in for
[3:03:06.740 --> 3:03:15.060]  himself and the president who allowed kashoggi to be cut in pieces uh and without any repercussions
[3:03:15.060 --> 3:03:22.660]  whatsoever is now allowing the christians and the courage to be massacred by the turks and i
[3:03:22.660 --> 3:03:29.380]  believe and i want to say this with great uh solemnity the president of the united states is
[3:03:29.380 --> 3:03:37.860]  in danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits this to happen oh a mandate of heaven
[3:03:39.860 --> 3:03:44.820]  literally we're not becoming anglophiles like we did in the 20s in the us it was fashionable to
[3:03:44.820 --> 3:03:51.700]  speak with british accents we're becoming communist china files i mean this is out of control so he's
[3:03:51.700 --> 3:03:56.580]  clearly been reading off a teleprompter somebody loaded that in for him trump said it's time to
[3:03:56.580 --> 3:04:01.940]  bring the troops home and then we learned from jill scowles and i looked it up he's right it's not
[3:04:01.940 --> 3:04:06.340]  1,000 troops not a hundred troops it's 24 troops we still have troops there
[3:04:08.260 --> 3:04:13.140]  lindsey graham nicky hayley megah mckayam outrageous trump removes 50 troops from northern syria the
[3:04:13.140 --> 3:04:19.620]  word is now it's half of that these people are warmongering pigs the left just wants to harvest
[3:04:19.620 --> 3:04:27.140]  babies organs and teach living children how to perform sex acts and it's just that they're crazy
[3:04:27.140 --> 3:04:32.740]  scum and they've signed on to the chai comms it's insane so paul watchtons taken over then in 55

[3:06:35.540 --> 3:06:42.180]  why the woke establishment hates joker the frothing outrage in response to this film still
[3:06:42.180 --> 3:06:47.060]  continues to dominate four or five days after it was released so we're going to play that video
[3:06:47.060 --> 3:06:55.220]  which i just put up on info wars dot com about an hour ago meanwhile as i tweeted all across america
[3:06:55.220 --> 3:07:02.420]  the very same corporations that relentlessly virtue signal about how much they support minorities in
[3:07:02.420 --> 3:07:09.780]  lgbt domestically are groveling and cowering to china one of the most abusive nations towards
[3:07:09.780 --> 3:07:17.780]  minorities and lgbt on the planet they literally put muslims in concentration camps it's all
[3:07:17.780 --> 3:07:23.780]  a giant scam we have to get lectured about how offensive we are meanwhile china the most abusive
[3:07:23.780 --> 3:07:30.020]  one of the most abusive at least anti-human rights regimes on the planet not only gets a free pass
[3:07:30.020 --> 3:07:35.060]  but basically gets to conquer and take over america through the media through the sports
[3:07:35.060 --> 3:07:41.700]  entertainment industry and if you spent the last year arguing for big tech to censor people you
[3:07:41.700 --> 3:07:49.460]  don't like you have no right to criticize china for censoring south park or the nba because you're
[3:07:49.460 --> 3:07:54.660]  literally as bad as them and that's literally what they've done they've yanked all the nba
[3:07:54.660 --> 3:07:59.860]  broadcasts off their networks they've yanked all the south park episodes off their networks
[3:07:59.860 --> 3:08:05.860]  they've even gone into south park forums and wiped them off the internet because south park
[3:08:05.860 --> 3:08:13.700]  dared to make fun of china in the last episode because this nba coach dared to express support
[3:08:13.700 --> 3:08:20.180]  for pro-democracy protesters in ukraine and the reaction has been vehement to say the least from
[3:08:20.180 --> 3:08:27.140]  china the reaction from corporate america has been to genuflect bow down grovel and apologize
[3:08:27.140 --> 3:08:33.460]  because their proclaimed wokeness is a complete scam it's very dust headline out of bright spot
[3:08:34.260 --> 3:08:40.420]  nba's woke warriors silent on human rights abuses in china the national basketball association
[3:08:40.420 --> 3:08:46.180]  considers itself one of the most progressive organizations in america and is always ready
[3:08:46.180 --> 3:08:50.420]  to criticize president donald trump or other americans who are members of the league think are
[3:08:50.420 --> 3:08:57.380]  not woken off but this weekend's apology to china and they did apologize there are stories claiming
[3:08:57.380 --> 3:09:02.980]  they didn't apologize and they're going to refuse to apologize yes they did on two separate occasions
[3:09:02.980 --> 3:09:08.180]  over the weekend shows that the nba is quick to attack americans while turning a blind eye to
[3:09:08.180 --> 3:09:15.540]  china's serious human rights abuses over the weekend the nba rebuked houston rockets general
[3:09:15.540 --> 3:09:21.380]  manager darryl moary who tweeted his support of the pro-democracy movement in hong kong which by
[3:09:21.380 --> 3:09:26.020]  the way the administrative leader of hong kong has now basically said that they're about to send in
[3:09:26.020 --> 3:09:31.220]  the chinese troops so that's going to get very fruity and a heartbeat the league apologized to
[3:09:31.220 --> 3:09:36.820]  the oppressive chinese government for moary's support of the democracy activists but according
[3:09:36.820 --> 3:09:40.660]  to a recent report human rights watch china is still one of the worst abusers of human rights
[3:09:40.660 --> 3:09:46.500]  in the world it's 2018 report the organization reported china has quote dramatically stepped
[3:09:46.500 --> 3:09:52.500]  up repression and systematic abuses against the 13 million turkic muslims including weavers and
[3:09:52.500 --> 3:09:59.940]  ethnic khazaks in china's northwestern shing shang region and of course in china in hong kong they're
[3:09:59.940 --> 3:10:06.340]  now talking about shutting down the internet to shut down these protests that is their go-to method
[3:10:06.340 --> 3:10:12.500]  every step of the way is censorship and now because big tech and corporate america has aligned
[3:10:12.500 --> 3:10:19.140]  itself with that agenda they censor just as flagrantly as china does now they're backing down
[3:10:19.140 --> 3:10:26.660]  in a heartbeat china warns brands to accept communism freedom of speech ridiculous they put
[3:10:26.660 --> 3:10:34.020]  this out in their official global times communist party mouthpiece warning global brands that's
[3:10:34.020 --> 3:10:39.140]  corporate america to make their members speak cautiously on chinese political issues monday
[3:10:39.140 --> 3:10:43.620]  in response to an ongoing controversy following an mba executive lending supports pro-democracy
[3:10:43.620 --> 3:10:49.220]  protests in hong kong following condemnation from the communist party and its puppets in chinese
[3:10:49.220 --> 3:10:55.540]  society the mba issued a statement condemning moary yes they did do that despite the mainstream
[3:10:55.540 --> 3:11:00.020]  media in america today claiming they'd never apologize they did on two separate occasions
[3:11:00.020 --> 3:11:07.220]  but now in an article published monday titled global brands better stay away from politics this is
[3:11:07.220 --> 3:11:14.500]  the chinese government lecturing corporate america on controlling people's freedom of speech what they're
[3:11:14.500 --> 3:11:19.460]  allowed to say what they're not allowed to say and they backed down in a heartbeat the global times
[3:11:19.460 --> 3:11:25.620]  article warned americans and international actors that chinese authoritarian speech restrictions
[3:11:25.620 --> 3:11:33.540]  now apply worldwide and any protests in the name of free speech are quote ridiculous china says jump
[3:11:33.540 --> 3:11:40.100]  corporate america says how high the only people who didn't back down of course with the creators
[3:11:40.100 --> 3:11:46.020]  of south park but then we have corporations like apple headline apple bows to china by
[3:11:46.020 --> 3:11:51.940]  censoring taiwan flag emoji in a recent update to its ios apple's iphone operating system
[3:11:51.940 --> 3:11:57.220]  and apple removed the taiwanese flag emoji from its keyboard for users in hong kong and
[3:11:57.220 --> 3:12:04.020]  macau china's two special administrative regions all the horror of somebody being able to send a
[3:12:04.020 --> 3:12:10.260]  taiwanese flag emoji to their friend we have to shut that down imagine how insecure you have to be
[3:12:10.260 --> 3:12:18.820]  to delete a flag of a country from a from an ios update is that going to cause unrest or is the
[3:12:18.820 --> 3:12:24.180]  fact that you know troops are about to roll into hong kong you've got riot police literally shooting
[3:12:24.180 --> 3:12:29.620]  people in the chest maybe that's more likely to cause unrest apple makes no mention of the
[3:12:29.620 --> 3:12:34.660]  change in its release notes for ios 13.11 the company did not immediately reply to quotes
[3:12:34.660 --> 3:12:40.900]  as inquiry about whether the chinese government requested censorship of the taiwanese flag taiwan
[3:12:40.900 --> 3:12:50.340]  is in an independently run democracy so far so apple caved in tiffany caved in headline tiffany
[3:12:50.340 --> 3:12:56.020]  removes that vert over hong kong controversy tiffany and co removed a tweet showing a woman
[3:12:56.020 --> 3:13:00.660]  covering one eye after chinese consumers accused the jeweler of supporting the hong kong protesters
[3:13:01.300 --> 3:13:07.220]  of course that one eye symbol is because they shot a woman in the eye early on in the protest
[3:13:07.220 --> 3:13:12.420]  she lost her eye so then that became a symbol of the movement the photo posted on monday show
[3:13:12.420 --> 3:13:17.300]  chinese model sun feifei wearing a tiffany ring on her right hand as it covers her right eye
[3:13:17.300 --> 3:13:24.420]  it wasn't even deliberate probably and yet tiffany and co backed down immediately guess who else

[3:13:45.380 --> 3:13:50.900]  looting to the city's anti-government protests from a sneaker design competition so they had
[3:13:50.900 --> 3:13:56.020]  a competition for somebody to design a shoe and then somebody put some characters on this shoe
[3:13:56.020 --> 3:14:03.780]  that looked vaguely like the hong kong protesters and that had to go it can't even be represented
[3:14:04.420 --> 3:14:08.980]  again this is another form of de-platforming their likeness can't even be represented
[3:14:09.940 --> 3:14:14.740]  in corporate america or indeed in this case in hong kong the company's decision to withdraw the
[3:14:14.740 --> 3:14:18.900]  proposed design was met with outrage on social media where users began uploading videos and
[3:14:18.900 --> 3:14:24.900]  photos of themselves throwing their vans sneakers in the trash and setting them on fire
[3:14:24.900 --> 3:14:32.340]  so they've backed down tiffany backed down apple backed down the nba backed down and apologized
[3:14:32.340 --> 3:14:37.540]  and groveled the only people who haven't backed down to this conquering of corporate america by

[3:15:01.860 --> 3:15:07.380]  banned in china which was then banned in china which originally had last wednesday satirized as
[3:15:07.380 --> 3:15:13.700]  the entertainment and sports industry's willingness to abide by chinese sensors in order to corner
[3:15:13.700 --> 3:15:21.460]  its business market and look what happened in the days the week since that south park episode
[3:15:21.460 --> 3:15:27.460]  has aired apple removing a taiwanese flag tiffany and company removing a tweet because it shows a
[3:15:27.460 --> 3:15:33.060]  woman covering one eye vans withdrawing sneakers from a design competition because they show

[3:20:45.380 --> 3:20:50.900]  video which went up a couple of hours ago why the woke establishment hates the joker movie a key
[3:20:50.900 --> 3:20:57.380]  video for you to get out and share the time being though speculation about whether hillary clinton
[3:20:57.380 --> 3:21:04.340]  yes hillary clinton will run for a third time as president continues to rage and in fact about
[3:21:04.340 --> 3:21:10.740]  15 minutes ago she responded to donald trump's tweet from earlier today of course trump said quote
[3:21:10.740 --> 3:21:15.540]  i think that crooked hillary clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from uber left
[3:21:15.540 --> 3:21:20.820]  elizabeth warren only one condition the crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors
[3:21:20.820 --> 3:21:29.060]  including how and why she deleted 33 000 emails after getting c subpoena hillary clinton responded
[3:21:29.060 --> 3:21:36.180]  to that on twitter about 15 minutes ago said don't tempt me do your job and then the initial
[3:21:36.180 --> 3:21:42.740]  responses i'm reading to this or trump supporters begging hillary clinton to run just as trump
[3:21:42.740 --> 3:21:50.500]  wants her to run meanwhile hillary jumps to third place on predictor as rumors of 2020 runs swirl
[3:21:50.500 --> 3:21:56.980]  is the democratic field that weak and that pathetic that hillary clinton could actually
[3:21:56.980 --> 3:22:02.660]  have a chance of winning having failed twice previously she's now jumped to third place behind
[3:22:02.660 --> 3:22:07.620]  elizabeth warren and joe biden on predictor as rumors of her entering the race for a 2020
[3:22:07.620 --> 3:22:12.500]  presidential run continue to build clinton is enjoying a bounce due to the fact that
[3:22:12.500 --> 3:22:17.140]  all the rest of them are even more pathetic than her because of scandals surrounding biden's
[3:22:17.140 --> 3:22:21.140]  profiteering in ukraine and claims warren lied about being fired from a teaching job for being
[3:22:21.140 --> 3:22:26.420]  visibly pregnant we now know that was almost certainly not the case yet another complete
[3:22:26.420 --> 3:22:33.140]  fabrication from her just like her ancestry the odds of hillary becoming 2020 democratic nominee
[3:22:33.860 --> 3:22:37.380]  amongst a poor field of candidates are also at the highest in months you can see there on the
[3:22:37.380 --> 3:22:43.460]  graph from predictor basically going parabolic over the last day or so odds of hillary clinton as
[3:22:43.460 --> 3:22:49.780]  2020 democratic nominee the rasmussen poll has trump and hillary running neck and neck in a
[3:22:49.780 --> 3:22:55.380]  hypothetical rematch and then as we highlighted last week she appeared on this steven colbert show
[3:22:55.380 --> 3:23:00.820]  with her daughter and she was asked if she would endorse any of the democratic candidates she said
[3:23:00.820 --> 3:23:06.100]  she refused to endorse any of them fueling speculation she may you may get into the race
[3:23:07.380 --> 3:23:11.460]  and then steve bannon went on fox business network last week also and said
[3:23:12.820 --> 3:23:16.420]  clinton was trying to find a way to wedge herself into the race he said they think they
[3:23:16.420 --> 3:23:21.140]  have a weak field in there it's like in chess they're prepared to get sacrificed a rock to
[3:23:21.140 --> 3:23:25.780]  take down a king they will throw biden away to get to trump and hope elizabeth or i think even
[3:23:25.780 --> 3:23:32.020]  hillary clinton or bloomberg or some centrist comes in here she is running said bannon she's
[3:23:32.020 --> 3:23:39.460]  just trying to decide how to fit her way in and now she's literally tweeted at donald trump
[3:23:39.460 --> 3:23:47.220]  don't tempt me could we have the absolute joy the meme explosion of having hillary clinton
[3:23:47.220 --> 3:23:54.020]  crooked hillary run for a third time and to fail as a third time presidential contender
[3:23:54.980 --> 3:24:00.340]  it would be extremely hilarious to say the least and the memes would be off the charts
[3:24:01.460 --> 3:24:07.300]  meanwhile in hong kong we talked about all these giant corporations who again
[3:24:07.300 --> 3:24:13.300]  virtue signal all day about how woke they are how much they pander to lgbt minorities while
[3:24:13.300 --> 3:24:19.620]  literally groveling and begging to china one of the biggest abusers of lgbt people and minorities
[3:24:19.620 --> 3:24:26.580]  on the planet now chinese army ready to step in against rioters hong kong's carryland warns for
[3:24:26.580 --> 3:24:31.460]  first time following a renewed surge in protest unrest and violence in the wake of the controversial
[3:24:31.460 --> 3:24:37.620]  mask ban which basically had no effect the militants are still out on the streets hong kong
[3:24:37.620 --> 3:24:42.740]  leader carry lamb has for the first time issued public warning that the chinese military could
[3:24:42.740 --> 3:24:48.740]  step in saying this drastic step would only happen if it becomes so bad expressing hope it won't come
[3:24:48.740 --> 3:24:52.660]  to that the situation will resolve itself and the local authorities she noted that the four
[3:24:52.660 --> 3:24:57.300]  months long raging protests were no longer a peaceful movement for democracy and urged outside
[3:24:57.300 --> 3:25:03.300]  critics to understand this she's saying no options could be ruled out we know now there are three
[3:25:03.300 --> 3:25:09.620]  times the amount of chinese troops in hong kong as there were just a few months ago they did that
[3:25:09.620 --> 3:25:15.380]  that bait and switch where they had the rotation of troops when they were actually bringing
[3:25:15.380 --> 3:25:20.580]  thousands and thousands of more troops into the area and then of course we had this story
[3:25:20.580 --> 3:25:26.100]  which is up on drudge yesterday hong kong government considering internet ban to stop protests
[3:25:27.380 --> 3:25:32.820]  that was the executive council the local government it quack him who said they wouldn't
[3:25:32.820 --> 3:25:38.660]  rule out an internet ban in the future reason that's important is because whenever there are
[3:25:38.660 --> 3:25:45.940]  mass riots or civil unrest in these areas of china where they have large minority populations who
[3:25:45.940 --> 3:25:50.660]  are being oppressed and literally put in concentration camps and reeducation camps
[3:25:51.620 --> 3:25:57.060]  their first response the chinese government authorities is always to block ban and censor
[3:25:57.060 --> 3:26:03.700]  the internet and hey if it's good enough for apple and youtube and twitter and facebook why not
[3:26:03.700 --> 3:26:09.220]  so that's what they always do to try and quell unrest whether that's going to work in hong
[3:26:09.220 --> 3:26:14.740]  kong far more technologically advanced region than somewhere like tibet where they normally do it
[3:26:15.300 --> 3:26:22.740]  remains to be seen but now they're talking about sending in the troops meanwhile in europe
[3:26:24.180 --> 3:26:30.020]  germany syrian migrant shouting a la plaza truck into traffic nine injured this this is an
[3:26:30.020 --> 3:26:36.340]  absolute miracle that he plowed the truck into other cars and not people it was in the city of
[3:26:36.980 --> 3:26:42.340]  limburg i guess because this attack happened last night there weren't many pedestrians out walking
[3:26:42.340 --> 3:26:47.860]  around so he just decided to plow it into a bunch of other cars which probably in a roundabout way
[3:26:47.860 --> 3:26:53.620]  is for the better because nobody died the syrian migrant shouting in arabic about a la plow the
[3:26:53.620 --> 3:26:57.700]  truck into traffic in the german city of limburg and during nine people they're treating it as a
[3:26:57.700 --> 3:27:03.220]  terrorist attack the suspect dragged the driver of a white Mercedes truck from his vehicle before
[3:27:03.220 --> 3:27:08.340]  accelerating into other cars at a traffic light witnesses said he said alex several times about
[3:27:08.340 --> 3:27:17.620]  arabic now of course angela merkel opened germany's borders to mass migration back in 2015 around 1.5
[3:27:17.620 --> 3:27:24.900]  to 2 million refugees many of them from syria flooded into the country many of those refugees
[3:27:24.900 --> 3:27:30.740]  were subsequently involved in terrorist attacks we also know that the paris massacre culprits
[3:27:31.380 --> 3:27:38.660]  used fake passports posed as syrian refugees to get into france the deadlier 2016 truck attack
[3:27:38.660 --> 3:27:43.540]  we probably remember that at a christmas market in berlin which killed 12 people and injured
[3:27:43.540 --> 3:27:50.340]  56 others was carried out by a failed tunisian asylum seeker and then last week of course we
[3:27:50.340 --> 3:27:56.020]  had another attack it seemed that these isis inspired terror attacks were starting to die down
[3:27:56.820 --> 3:28:02.820]  over the past year or so but now we've had apparently two in the space of a week because
[3:28:02.820 --> 3:28:08.180]  last week a knife man who had converted to islam and had been radicalized by isis propaganda killed
[3:28:08.180 --> 3:28:15.780]  four people in a terrorist attack on a police station in paris france again that was somebody
[3:28:15.780 --> 3:28:21.860]  who had converted to islam about 18 months ago once again proving that islam is not a race it's a
[3:28:21.860 --> 3:28:28.580]  belief system so we seem to have an optic in terrorist attacks occurring throughout europe
[3:28:28.580 --> 3:28:36.580]  and that's very bad news indeed gonna come back and talk about the extent extinction rebellion
[3:28:37.140 --> 3:28:43.220]  the streets of london other major cities brought to a standstill and what a top professor is saying
[3:28:43.220 --> 3:28:50.660]  about the true motivations behind these well-dressed middle-class performing activists this is the

[3:33:29.700 --> 3:33:37.060]  live on the fourth hour of the show without further ado gonna go straight to this video which
[3:33:37.060 --> 3:33:44.180]  is up on youtube get it get it out there it is why the woke establishment hates joker here it is
[3:33:48.980 --> 3:33:54.900]  joker was undoubtedly one of the most authentic watershed cultural moments of the last 10 years
[3:33:54.900 --> 3:34:01.460]  which given how saturated in vapid banality our culture has become those moments are few and far
[3:34:01.460 --> 3:34:07.780]  between there are very few movies that stay with you but joker's claustrophobic nihilism clings
[3:34:07.780 --> 3:34:14.180]  on like nothing else but how do we know for sure that it was so good because all the right people
[3:34:14.180 --> 3:34:19.540]  hated it the guardian slates the wall street journal this guardian easter implored people to
[3:34:19.540 --> 3:34:24.820]  ditch joker and instead see a movie that was literally about how to become an incel before the
[3:34:24.820 --> 3:34:30.180]  movies released we were bombarded with relentless hysteria about how it was going to cause mass
[3:34:30.180 --> 3:34:37.220]  shootings how it was irresponsible how we needed cops at theaters to keep us safe why was the
[3:34:37.220 --> 3:34:43.060]  establishment so afraid of this movie why did they try to actively discourage people from
[3:34:43.060 --> 3:34:47.940]  seeing it because joker points a finger at the true reason why our society produces the
[3:34:47.940 --> 3:34:54.820]  diseased minds responsible for mass shootings because our entire culture is bathed in atomizing
[3:34:54.820 --> 3:35:00.580]  consumerists celebrity at all costs nihilism because the way we've been brainwashed into
[3:35:00.580 --> 3:35:06.500]  living and consuming creates a breeding ground for loneliness despair and mental illness because
[3:35:06.500 --> 3:35:12.100]  we've been taught that people who think differently are a danger to society and that they must be
[3:35:12.100 --> 3:35:17.940]  ostracized bullied and censored into silence because we've castigated an entire generation of
[3:35:17.940 --> 3:35:23.060]  young men that they're worthless incels who deserve nothing but contempt who's responsible for all
[3:35:23.060 --> 3:35:30.580]  that the media silicon valley puritanical woke outrage mobs the movie holds up a mirror to how a
[3:35:30.580 --> 3:35:37.380]  society that humiliates shames and disenfranchises people is itself responsible for generating
[3:35:37.380 --> 3:35:43.300]  violence joker's murder of the talk show host is literally motivated by him being humiliated and
[3:35:43.300 --> 3:35:49.540]  canceled cultured by the media so is it any wonder that the same force is responsible for doing
[3:35:49.540 --> 3:35:57.380]  exactly that in our society hate this movie so this movie is it's such a hard one i cried three
[3:35:57.380 --> 3:36:02.180]  times during the course of it i don't believe you've ever cried in your life as tj kerke writes this
[3:36:02.180 --> 3:36:06.660]  film is being treated as dangerous by the media and by the powers of the b not only because
[3:36:06.660 --> 3:36:11.940]  they're afraid it will inspire violence but because it challenges their narrative about why
[3:36:11.940 --> 3:36:17.140]  violence happens in the first place it challenges the cartoonish notion that every mass shooter is
[3:36:17.140 --> 3:36:24.020]  just a random sicko with a gun who snapped or even more idiotically was just born evil joker
[3:36:24.020 --> 3:36:29.060]  makes an explicit connection between mental illness and violence here's why that's dangerous and
[3:36:29.060 --> 3:36:33.700]  wrong because it doesn't fit with our parties and agenda to blame mass shootings on gun ownership
[3:36:33.700 --> 3:36:40.100]  see they don't want you talking about how mental illness leads to violence because they're responsible
[3:36:40.100 --> 3:36:47.380]  for exacerbating mental illness big pharma silicon valley the rage bait media is it just me
[3:36:50.420 --> 3:36:55.220]  or is it getting crazier out there they also try to put people off from seeing this movie by
[3:36:55.220 --> 3:37:01.140]  terrifying us about how violent it was that's rich isn't it the same news networks that plaster the
[3:37:01.140 --> 3:37:07.140]  names faces and manifestos of mass shooters across the world while the bodies are still warm
[3:37:07.140 --> 3:37:13.060]  inspiring copycat attacks blaming a comic book movie about a clown for mass shootings and anyway
[3:37:13.060 --> 3:37:18.500]  it's not even that violent yeah there are like three brutal murders but one of the biggest movies
[3:37:18.500 --> 3:37:23.700]  of the year john wick three was literally just two hours of straight violence and nobody got
[3:37:23.700 --> 3:37:29.140]  their panties in a bunch over that there was no moral panic there were no cops posted outside
[3:37:29.140 --> 3:37:34.820]  theaters in case keanu reeves radicalized anyone to go postal good to see you too and unlike many
[3:37:34.820 --> 3:37:40.740]  movies that pander to woken us in return for artificially inflated critic reviews joker didn't
[3:37:40.740 --> 3:37:46.420]  subject us to that and that's also what makes them mad they crave the power which allows them to
[3:37:46.420 --> 3:37:52.260]  disincentivize people from making movies which don't even deviate from the progressive consensus
[3:37:52.260 --> 3:37:58.820]  but merely refused to worship its sacred cows they're engaged in a cultural revolution to cleanse
[3:37:58.820 --> 3:38:04.500]  the entertainment industry of anything that doesn't regurgitate their dogma that's why there's a
[3:38:04.500 --> 3:38:09.940]  significant gap between the critic score and the audience score bear in mind these are the same
[3:38:09.940 --> 3:38:17.780]  critics who gave hustlers some godawful feminist cringe fest a better review score than joker
[3:38:17.780 --> 3:38:24.580]  joker an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films of the 21st century gets 69 percent hustlers
[3:38:24.580 --> 3:38:32.260]  some slot fest dressed up as a tawdry moralizing girl power flick gets 88 percent how out of touch
[3:38:32.260 --> 3:38:37.220]  are these people going to get before we stop listening to them take the recent dave chapelle
[3:38:37.220 --> 3:38:43.780]  special the difference between the critic score and the audience score was 35 percent to 99 percent
[3:38:43.780 --> 3:38:50.660]  merely because chapelle made fun of lgbt people once during the entire show any deviation from
[3:38:50.660 --> 3:38:57.380]  the dogma any hint of dissent and the transgressor must be punished as a message to others the critics
[3:38:57.380 --> 3:39:02.660]  knives were out as soon as joker director todd philips dared engage in the wrongthink of asserting
[3:39:02.660 --> 3:39:08.660]  that woke outrage culture has killed comedy he also previously suggested that people realizing the
[3:39:08.660 --> 3:39:14.260]  system was rigged created the environment that allowed trump to be elected and for that reason
[3:39:14.260 --> 3:39:20.180]  alone for not genuflecting to the cult of political correctness numerous lefty reviewers probably
[3:39:20.180 --> 3:39:25.780]  walked into the cinema with a stick up their butt and their minds already made up according to a
[3:39:25.780 --> 3:39:32.020]  cnn op-ed joker was racist it's an insidious validation of the white male resentment that
[3:39:32.020 --> 3:39:37.700]  helped bring president donald turp to power bullshit whatever politics formed the backdrop to the
[3:39:37.700 --> 3:39:43.780]  movie a left wing it's an anti-capitalist thing but the joker character himself repeatedly
[3:39:43.780 --> 3:39:49.860]  emphasizes how his motivations are not political all of the people he murders are white and his
[3:39:49.860 --> 3:39:56.500]  love interest is a black single mom god so racist but how revealing is it that the mere existence
[3:39:56.500 --> 3:40:02.980]  of a character a mere analysis of the struggles of a mentally ill poor white man is enough to
[3:40:02.980 --> 3:40:09.860]  prompt accusations of racism that's why they hate this movie god forbid could the existential angst
[3:40:09.860 --> 3:40:15.540]  of a white male be allowed to be represented in 2019 they also hate the joker because it
[3:40:15.540 --> 3:40:22.100]  rift on one of the more viral recent memes clown world this idea that the only rational reaction
[3:40:22.100 --> 3:40:27.540]  to the increasing insanity that identity politics and political correctness has wrought on the world
[3:40:27.540 --> 3:40:37.140]  is to don a clown mask and honk a horn the media of course savaged this meme as another dog whistle
[3:40:37.140 --> 3:40:43.540]  for white supremacists and deadly incels for me the joker's erratic yet strangely satisfying dance
[3:40:43.540 --> 3:40:49.700]  moves were kind of a cathartic realization an embracement of the whole clown world meme the
[3:40:49.700 --> 3:40:55.220]  casting of robert deniro as the smug talk show host was also a stroke of genius because as this
[3:40:55.220 --> 3:41:01.060]  tweeter points out the actor himself has more or less become the condescending self-righteous and
[3:41:01.060 --> 3:41:06.340]  elitist entertainment industry archetype who much of the working class has come to loathe
[3:41:06.340 --> 3:41:11.700]  over the last 20 years as john daniel davidson points out the movie also emphasizes how maybe
[3:41:11.700 --> 3:41:17.140]  the thing people need most in life is friendship and love and community maybe we need to rethink
[3:41:17.140 --> 3:41:21.940]  the way we've torn down the institutions and traditions that used to support these things
[3:41:21.940 --> 3:41:27.060]  maybe the radical atomization and isolation and autonomy of modern life doesn't foster
[3:41:27.060 --> 3:41:33.220]  prosperity and happiness maybe we need to start taking these things seriously if we do that will
[3:41:33.220 --> 3:41:37.700]  mean rethinking a half century of progressive thought and questioning whether it has all
[3:41:37.700 --> 3:41:44.660]  been a pack of lies and maybe that's the real reason woke media hate joker as we can glean
[3:41:44.660 --> 3:41:49.780]  from his rant during his appearance on the talk show near the end of the film one of joker's main
[3:41:49.780 --> 3:41:56.100]  gripes is the breakdown of civility in society he just wants people to be nicer to each other ask
[3:41:56.100 --> 3:42:01.620]  yourself this does a media establishment whose very existence is dependent on maintaining an
[3:42:01.620 --> 3:42:07.780]  endless cycle of rage bait a torrential shit show of feigned outrage and partisan bickering
[3:42:07.780 --> 3:42:14.340]  a drab deluge of hollow meaningless plastic culture that shows nothing but vicious hostility
[3:42:14.340 --> 3:42:20.980]  to anything or anyone trying to express authenticity really want a message that exposes all of that
[3:42:20.980 --> 3:42:33.700]  to be heard establishment hates the joker there was in fact a tweet that i'd posted about an hour
[3:42:33.700 --> 3:42:39.220]  ago from a buzzfeed journalist who said in this tweet there's a moment where the joker tells an
[3:42:39.220 --> 3:42:43.540]  offensive joke robert deniro scolds him and tells him that you can't tell jokes like that and the
[3:42:43.540 --> 3:42:50.500]  joker goes on a rant about how people are too easily offended these days seriously yes he was
[3:42:50.500 --> 3:42:55.780]  triggered by that fact that's why they hate it that video was up on youtube please get it get

[3:48:26.100 --> 3:48:32.420]  checks from george soros groups like the extinction rebellion now i was on their website earlier
[3:48:32.420 --> 3:48:38.100]  today and they make a really strong point about emphasizing how transparent they are with their
[3:48:38.100 --> 3:48:43.140]  funding you follow the links to exactly where their funding comes from they don't tell you
[3:48:43.860 --> 3:48:48.980]  basically a powerpoint presentation without any information whatsoever about who these
[3:48:48.980 --> 3:48:54.980]  NGOs are that are backing this group obviously it's going to be the usual suspects but they
[3:48:54.980 --> 3:49:00.740]  then even put it on their website they brought london to a standstill yesterday they're bringing
[3:49:00.740 --> 3:49:06.100]  other cities to a standstill headline professor slams extinction rebellion as a carnival for
[3:49:06.100 --> 3:49:12.980]  middle classes who love to dress up as activists in fact there's a video in this article where
[3:49:12.980 --> 3:49:18.180]  katie hopkins the british journalist gets confronted by one of these extinction rebellion
[3:49:18.180 --> 3:49:24.660]  protesters bombarding her with questions as soon as she asks him one particular question
[3:49:25.460 --> 3:49:31.860]  doesn't seem to be too keen on answering it and it's a very simple question where did you go to
[3:49:31.860 --> 3:49:39.460]  school because this protest group seems to be very privileged very white very middle class
[3:49:39.460 --> 3:49:44.500]  doesn't really seem to be representing the interests of the poor of course if we follow
[3:49:44.500 --> 3:49:49.620]  their advice poor countries third world countries wouldn't be able to develop they're already
[3:49:50.500 --> 3:49:55.700]  destroying their forests in many areas to grow palm oil so it's just very interesting the
[3:49:55.700 --> 3:50:01.620]  makeup of this crowd very privileged background people have also noted this amazing coincidence
[3:50:01.620 --> 3:50:07.780]  whereby if you go on their instagrams they're always taking photos out of airplane windows
[3:50:07.780 --> 3:50:15.300]  isn't that interesting they worship Greta Thunberg the child actress who pals around with all
[3:50:15.300 --> 3:50:21.860]  Arnold Schwarzenegger who's got a garage full of muscle cars and tanks she pals around with
[3:50:21.860 --> 3:50:27.380]  leonardo de caprio who takes private jets to collect environmental awards she pals around
[3:50:27.380 --> 3:50:33.940]  with prince harry who took four private jet trips in 11 days to save the planet no
[3:50:33.940 --> 3:50:38.500]  to go and visit elton john and party in his mansion these are the people behind this movement
[3:50:39.060 --> 3:50:45.780]  rich elitists at the top privileged middle class posh boys in the middle lecturing you
[3:50:45.780 --> 3:50:51.140]  on how to live your life while they're on literally like a dozen commercial airline
[3:50:51.140 --> 3:50:56.900]  trips or even private jet trips a year taking selfies in airplanes and putting it on instagram
[3:50:56.900 --> 3:51:01.780]  saying how much they care about the planet well now professor and sociologist frank
[3:51:01.780 --> 3:51:06.580]  frendy has slammed the extinction rebellion climate change protests as a carnival for
[3:51:06.580 --> 3:51:11.140]  middle classes who love to dress up as activists and that's what it is this isn't a process this
[3:51:11.140 --> 3:51:16.420]  is a show and tell this is just a huge virtue signaling exercise where they can put it on
[3:51:16.420 --> 3:51:21.140]  instagram and make them felt make themselves feel warm and cozy about it and tell their friends
[3:51:21.140 --> 3:51:25.700]  about it make themselves look better in front of their friends oh my god look at me i'm such a
[3:51:25.700 --> 3:51:32.420]  good person i care so much about the planet when i'm not using diesel generators to actually power
[3:51:32.420 --> 3:51:39.300]  all this we had another video about that the group has embarked on a two-week campaign to bring 60
[3:51:39.300 --> 3:51:43.700]  major world cities to a complete standstill that's sure to win hearts and minds that oh by the way
[3:51:43.700 --> 3:51:49.300]  they're literally they literally have given themselves the right to stop ambulances trying
[3:51:49.300 --> 3:51:53.700]  to get across some of these roads that they've blocked and their leaders have given interviews
[3:51:53.700 --> 3:51:59.140]  saying oh yeah we'll we'll have a chat with the person who's trying to get to their dying loved
[3:51:59.140 --> 3:52:03.940]  one to visit them for a less time we'll have a chat with the emergency case in the ambulance
[3:52:03.940 --> 3:52:09.940]  who could die at any minute maybe we'll let them through maybe we won't and the police do absolutely
[3:52:09.940 --> 3:52:16.580]  nothing they just sit there stand there in some cases frolic and dance with them if anyone else
[3:52:16.580 --> 3:52:22.100]  did this if this was the countryside alliance or a pro-brexit march or whatever who were literally
[3:52:22.100 --> 3:52:28.020]  blocking major roads and bridges in london they'd all be arrested instantly these guys get to do it
[3:52:28.020 --> 3:52:34.580]  all day a few of them got arrested at the end of it by the way this guy here was there to save the
[3:52:34.580 --> 3:52:40.100]  amazon rainforest that's what that woman said he was literally stopped in that moment from saving
[3:52:40.100 --> 3:52:47.140]  the amazon rainforest because he was arrested so this sociologist has written a really good
[3:52:47.140 --> 3:52:53.060]  op-ed about this which you should go and read by the way they're very proud to display their
[3:52:53.060 --> 3:52:59.540]  pvc yoga mats in the middle of west minster bridge probably not aware of the fact that pvc
[3:52:59.540 --> 3:53:07.620]  yoga mats are made literally from petroleum frendy said quote the ease with which extinction
[3:53:07.620 --> 3:53:11.940]  rebellion has succeeded in occupying the moral high ground has little to do with the quality of
[3:53:11.940 --> 3:53:16.740]  their arguments and the strength of the case in all but name the political establishments of the
[3:53:16.740 --> 3:53:21.700]  western world have given up the attempt to exercise moral authority the elite no longer upholds the
[3:53:21.700 --> 3:53:27.460]  values of their ancestors and is all too aware of its loss of legitimacy it no longer believes in
[3:53:27.460 --> 3:53:34.180]  itself and is evidently prepared to be flagellated by its environmentalist critics in turn extinction
[3:53:34.180 --> 3:53:39.140]  rebellion knows that when it instructs its posh friends to jump their answer is likely to be how
[3:53:39.140 --> 3:53:44.660]  high this is the key point a lot of people on the streets of london and elsewhere are of course
[3:53:44.660 --> 3:53:48.820]  really miffed and angry about the way this carnival of reaction has disrupted their life
[3:53:49.700 --> 3:53:54.100]  in private conversations they murmur and swear at these waste rules but as long as the performers
[3:53:54.100 --> 3:54:00.340]  enjoy backing of the media the cultural elites a significant section of the political establishment
[3:54:00.340 --> 3:54:05.860]  and of course the all-important celebrities their voice can be safely ignored by the protesters
[3:54:05.860 --> 3:54:11.220]  and that is the point this is not an organic grassroots movement what they're calling for
[3:54:11.220 --> 3:54:16.740]  is widely supported by the political establishment itself and if you drill down deeper into who
[3:54:16.740 --> 3:54:22.900]  actually operates these groups who owns the carbon trading systems that make vast profits from this
[3:54:22.900 --> 3:54:30.580]  it's the usual suspects George Soros Rothschild's Al Gore they're all well invested and these people
[3:54:30.580 --> 3:54:36.020]  are the useful idiots they're out on the front lines making it very lucrative for them indeed
[3:54:36.020 --> 3:54:43.940]  there was another video or another photo sorry which I put at the end of this article and it's
[3:54:43.940 --> 3:54:51.620]  literally three celebrities out of the UK proudly displaying extinction rebellion badges three of
[3:54:51.620 --> 3:54:58.980]  them all three of them recently produced lucrative commercials for the Britain's biggest airport
[3:54:58.980 --> 3:55:03.780]  Heathrow Airport the one all the environmentalists are supposed to hate because they keep trying
[3:55:03.780 --> 3:55:12.340]  to expand it and British Airways the biggest commercial airliner in the country Olivia Coleman
[3:55:12.340 --> 3:55:17.700]  Stephen Fry and Asim Chowdhury posing with extinction rebellion climate change badges
[3:55:18.340 --> 3:55:25.060]  they're all for the cause apart from when they're being paid like fry was to front a commercial
[3:55:25.060 --> 3:55:30.740]  for Heathrow Airport apart from when Coleman and Chowdhury appeared in a recent British Airways ad
[3:55:30.740 --> 3:55:37.060]  ad that plays before all flights and I've seen it a million times because they play it before
[3:55:37.060 --> 3:55:42.740]  every flight sets off they're literally being paid by the biggest airport in the country
[3:55:42.740 --> 3:55:48.900]  the biggest airliner in the country while claiming to be denizens and vocal proponents
[3:55:48.900 --> 3:55:57.140]  of climate climate change reduction activism absolutely incredible sheer hypocrisy but it's
[3:55:57.140 --> 3:56:03.060]  part of the course given who's at the top of this people like Prince Harry people lightly
[3:56:03.060 --> 3:56:10.180]  in order to caprio people like Arnold Schwarzenegger who are even bigger hypocrites meanwhile
[3:56:11.140 --> 3:56:16.900]  new peer reviewed academic study finds diversity is not a strength this is out of a Danish
[3:56:16.900 --> 3:56:22.420]  university it's entitled ethnic diversity and social trust and narrative and meta analytical
[3:56:22.420 --> 3:56:30.500]  review it's not put out by the heritage foundation it's not put out by Breitbart.com it's put out
[3:56:30.500 --> 3:56:35.700]  by Danish university academics who were seeking to answer whether continued immigration and
[3:56:35.700 --> 3:56:40.580]  corresponding growing ethnic diversity was having a positive positive impact on community cohesion
[3:56:41.220 --> 3:56:46.900]  but the study found the opposite to the case well what a surprise you have mass immigration
[3:56:46.900 --> 3:56:53.940]  uncontrolled integration goes by the wayside the study studied existing literature and also
[3:56:53.940 --> 3:56:59.140]  carried out a meta analysis of the thousand and one estimates from 87 studies and the research
[3:56:59.140 --> 3:57:06.100]  has concluded we find a statistically significant negative relationship between ethnic diversity
[3:57:06.100 --> 3:57:12.340]  and social trust across all studies not to say that you can't have some limited skilled immigration
[3:57:12.340 --> 3:57:19.220]  but when you bombard a country as we do in the case of the UK with almost 300 000 immigrants
[3:57:19.220 --> 3:57:25.940]  every year into a tiny island country that has a total population of what now about 70 million
[3:57:25.940 --> 3:57:30.820]  and you don't integrate them and many of them can't even speak the language you're going to have
[3:57:30.820 --> 3:57:38.580]  big problems with social trust and social cohesion and that's exactly what this study has found out
[3:57:38.580 --> 3:57:43.860]  that's going to wrap it up for the show coming up next is war room with Owen shroyer breaking
[3:57:43.860 --> 3:58:09.140]  news at info wars dot com thanks for joining us and we'll be back don't go away
