[00:44.480 --> 00:49.120]  and it was William Shakespeare who of course inculcated that into his famous
[00:49.120 --> 01:00.440]  play Julius Caesar beware the Ides of March Andrew Breitbart is dead an icon
[01:00.440 --> 01:05.160]  of alternative trailblazing media whether you agree with his politics or not
[01:05.160 --> 01:11.040]  he was very close to bringing down the Obama administration with Acorn and with
[01:11.040 --> 01:16.760]  the energy companies and the rest of it and was effectively endangering a
[01:16.760 --> 01:26.720]  second term he announced of course in February just last month that he would
[01:26.720 --> 01:33.440]  soon release footage of Obama in college damning footage and that he would vet
[01:33.440 --> 01:40.880]  him and expose him as a confirmed Marxist in college and that he would
[01:40.880 --> 01:48.680]  bring down Obama just shooting down Acorn which was a way to funnel billions
[01:48.680 --> 01:53.920]  of dollars into their different Democratic Party in Chicago Mafia
[01:53.920 --> 02:05.440]  apparatus systems just going after Acorn alone cut off money to big city
[02:05.440 --> 02:11.200]  machines across the United States who are very very nasty people I don't have
[02:11.200 --> 02:17.640]  to tell you Chicago is a mafia city of mafia cities and the mayor of Chicago

[02:57.920 --> 03:02.440]  he had a few heart issues and he was walking along and fell down and went to
[03:02.440 --> 03:06.200]  the hospital and died and we want to tell you just a few hours into it you know
[03:06.200 --> 03:11.880]  no autopsy no nothing he died of natural causes kind of like we were told the
[03:11.880 --> 03:15.520]  Pulitzer Prize winner Gary Webb who had a new book coming out soon he was
[03:15.520 --> 03:20.320]  finishing it exposing CIA drug dealing confirming his previous investigation
[03:20.320 --> 03:26.240]  and vindicating himself he shot himself twice in the head and the police that
[03:26.240 --> 03:30.360]  dropped by said oh that's quite normal of course he told friends and family who
[03:30.360 --> 03:35.000]  he had on the show that men have been breaking into his house he'd seen men
[03:35.000 --> 03:39.160]  scaling down the drainage pipes off his roof special forces types in plain
[03:39.160 --> 03:45.640]  clothes ransacking his home he just moved and was worried for his safety I
[03:45.640 --> 03:51.840]  had multiple witnesses on who said this but there's no foul play he got people
[03:51.840 --> 03:55.720]  breaking in your house you're moving there's special forces guys and coming
[03:55.720 --> 03:59.480]  down off your second-story roof scaling down the pipe on the side of the house
[03:59.480 --> 04:04.480]  oh they're just sliding down it you know special forces types it's no big deal

[04:09.880 --> 04:14.440]  like monkeys down the down from the second story and then he moved into a
[04:14.440 --> 04:18.760]  one-story and the media spun it and said don't listen to Jones's witnesses he
[04:18.760 --> 04:22.400]  lived in a one-story yeah six months before it was a two-story and it's
[04:22.400 --> 04:26.200]  normal to shoot yourself twice in the head blow your jaw for the first shot
[04:26.200 --> 04:31.000]  and shoot yourself in the side of the head it's normal it's no big deal of
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.440]  course the DC madam I said look don't kill yourself she said I would never kill
[04:34.440 --> 04:37.920]  myself I said well you better either say you destroy the list of names you got

[08:33.520 --> 08:39.000]  outside of town traveling across the United States speaking to overflow
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.640]  crowds of fellow Liberty lovers thank you so much for joining us it is March
[08:44.640 --> 08:55.520]  1st 2012 on this Thursday addition and we are going to be live here for the
[08:55.520 --> 09:00.380]  next three hours obviously we need to beware the
[09:00.380 --> 09:07.360]  aides of March an unlucky time even before the assassination the stabbing
[09:07.360 --> 09:14.880]  in the Roman Senate of Julius Caesar popularized in more modern times by
[09:14.880 --> 09:23.480]  William Shakespeare and his theatrical portrayal of the stabbing death in the
[09:23.480 --> 09:32.000]  Roman Senate of Julius Caesar beware the aides of March and we know what befell
[09:32.000 --> 09:38.920]  the individuals that did stab Caesar to death I will get into the death of
[09:38.920 --> 09:46.320]  Breitbart media trailblazer and we have an article up at info wars com linked in
[09:46.320 --> 09:57.240]  red will damning Obama footage he'll be released after Breitbart's death
[10:01.600 --> 10:09.640]  that is the question he had just said a few weeks ago that he's got incredibly
[10:09.640 --> 10:15.960]  damning footage of Obama in college and damning information about who funded
[10:15.960 --> 10:20.520]  him and the foundations and the communist connections and the criminal
[10:20.520 --> 10:23.720]  connections to the weathermen and the rest of it and of course he's somebody
[10:23.720 --> 10:28.720]  who did bring down acorn which cost the globalist billions you know they've got
[10:28.720 --> 10:32.760]  their energy deals where they're paying people off that way and he made a lot of
[10:32.760 --> 10:38.840]  mafia groups angry and if you don't question his death and the establishment
[10:38.840 --> 10:41.960]  saying within you know hours of the news coming out oh it's completely natural
[10:41.960 --> 10:46.600]  don't worry about it go to sleep everything's fine if you don't question
[10:46.600 --> 10:51.280]  this something is wrong with you so we're gonna be getting to that here in a
[10:51.280 --> 10:55.480]  few minutes and I'll go over it and I'll open the phones up so you can give us
[10:55.480 --> 10:59.760]  your take on it and then we got it as they're on for about 20 minutes a few
[10:59.760 --> 11:03.600]  weeks ago got some time zone issues or something scrambled so it'll be almost a
[11:03.600 --> 11:07.880]  full hour today because he's obviously the former head of the screen actors
[11:07.880 --> 11:12.680]  Guild famous Hollywood star in hundreds of films from JFK to you name it
[11:12.680 --> 11:18.560]  Mary Tyler Moore show his own Lou Grant show and he's a very interesting
[11:18.560 --> 11:25.000]  fellow and I want to get him on for a full hour interview and also take some
[11:25.000 --> 11:30.720]  calls for him and in the third hour will continue with the news obviously the
[11:30.720 --> 11:34.000]  news gets heavier and heavier and crazier by the minute we'll get into the
[11:34.000 --> 11:48.640]  whole bright bar death here in just a moment and then we have Sheriff or Pio
[11:48.640 --> 11:52.400]  who's been raided by the feds as you know as soon as he announced he was
[11:52.400 --> 11:56.880]  gonna investigate Barack Obama's eligibility in the state because they're
[11:56.880 --> 12:01.320]  the state house is trying to pass laws but I think Arizona has demanding you
[12:01.320 --> 12:05.720]  know last year to see the birth certificate and to actually see the
[12:05.720 --> 12:10.320]  long form and to see an original and you've got other states with court
[12:10.320 --> 12:14.000]  hearings demanding to see it and he got raided by the feds as soon as he did
[12:14.000 --> 12:23.840]  that and he says he's now about to release the findings of this six month
[12:23.840 --> 12:27.840]  investigation world that they least got a report on that it's also linked up at
[12:27.840 --> 12:32.280]  Grudge Report we've got a report at infowars.com democratic lawmaker tells
[12:32.280 --> 12:38.160]  DC Metro to remove ad that profanes Obama the ad said Barack Obama wants
[12:38.160 --> 12:43.720]  politicians and bureaucrats to control America's entire medical system and
[12:43.720 --> 12:48.080]  they've are demanding that be taken down because they go on to say go to Hades
[12:48.080 --> 12:58.920]  Morocco we'll be going over that report also big news up at infowars.com
[12:58.920 --> 13:05.560]  Hillary Clinton admits US and Al Qaeda are on the same side in Syria in a TV
[13:05.560 --> 13:09.800]  interview so it's they can't hide that our troops are ordered to grow opium in
[13:09.800 --> 13:16.600]  Afghanistan now 90 plus percent of world supply up from 10% a decade ago so they
[13:16.600 --> 13:19.600]  just put the troops on TV growing it and just hide it in plain view and say big
[13:19.600 --> 13:24.440]  deal we grow it we ship it in you go to prison when you use it and the cops pull
[13:24.440 --> 13:27.160]  you over want to search your car looking for drugs their bosses shipped in I
[13:27.160 --> 13:32.720]  mean it's just a total hoax and she's saying yeah we work with Al Qaeda so
[13:32.720 --> 13:36.560]  it's hurting them bad that this is coming out last year we got news almost
[13:36.560 --> 13:41.440]  time for Bilderberg again hard to believe that that Bilderberg was very very
[13:41.440 --> 13:53.640]  very very very very very very upset over the fact that it was in the LA Times and
[13:53.640 --> 13:59.000]  Washington Post and other places that Al Qaeda was being used to invade out of
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.920]  the east into the west of Libya and engaging in ethnic cleansing they mean
[14:03.920 --> 14:09.280]  they don't want that type of information out there that legitimizes the those of
[14:09.280 --> 14:14.080]  us in the 6 9 11 commissioners of the 10 that said they were lied to that it was
[14:14.080 --> 14:19.120]  a criminal conspiracy involving the Pentagon I mean those are quotes go look
[14:19.120 --> 14:25.320]  it up and then hijackers trained at US bases on record you know the heads of
[14:25.320 --> 14:29.480]  bases going public and saying I don't know what's going on but I taught Muhammad
[14:29.480 --> 14:33.760]  Atta for a year at the defense language school he sat in my class something's
[14:33.760 --> 14:39.840]  going on Colonel Butler you're gonna be court-martialed unless you come out and
[14:39.840 --> 14:46.560]  say you're gonna shut up I mean Colonel Butler's like this guy was in my class
[14:46.560 --> 14:53.720]  and so were a couple others they're like shut up shut up and then it's like Alex
[14:53.720 --> 14:58.240]  Jones is an anti-American traitor he shouldn't point out that the Colonel went
[14:58.240 --> 15:01.960]  public and it was in the Associated Press and San Jose Mercury news I'm just
[15:01.960 --> 15:05.720]  supposed to go oh and I interviewed the head of the US Embassy visa department
[15:05.720 --> 15:09.280]  who reported they were ordered to let Muhammad Atta and what seven others in
[15:09.280 --> 15:13.200]  from an al-Qaeda summit and they were like but they're flagged as top terrorists
[15:13.200 --> 15:17.560]  they're like that's their cover their CIA I mean I've had springmen and others on
[15:17.560 --> 15:21.480]  I mean these are facts do you understand the government got the
[15:21.480 --> 15:25.480]  underwear bomber on Christmas Day on the plane I told you that a month and a
[15:25.480 --> 15:29.720]  half before it was on C-span because I had an eyewitness Kurt Haskell and his
[15:29.720 --> 15:33.800]  wife that saw it happen they're at the gate saying he doesn't have ID he doesn't
[15:33.800 --> 15:38.360]  have a visa or they got him to visa he doesn't have a passport what are you
[15:38.360 --> 15:42.240]  doing and this guy had such authority he got Atta on the plane and then there's
[15:42.240 --> 15:45.800]  some guy for the last hour filming him two seats behind him and they're acting
[15:45.800 --> 15:50.000]  all weird and Haskell's watching what is this
[15:50.520 --> 15:55.840]  kind of like the actor James Woods who was on the plane two weeks for 9-11 and
[15:55.840 --> 15:59.160]  saw Muhammad Atta and others getting up out of their seats drilling for a
[15:59.160 --> 16:05.760]  hijacking and he got off told everybody and nobody wanted to talk to him it's
[16:05.760 --> 16:08.720]  just like when they have the air marshals practice taking bombs on planes
[16:08.720 --> 16:14.680]  air marshals they can give you a real bomb especially if you're a Muslim don't
[16:14.680 --> 16:19.120]  ever do that if you're another got Muslim air marshals put you on the plane
[16:19.120 --> 16:23.480]  blow it up and then just take you off the route roster that you ever even on
[16:23.480 --> 16:26.960]  the plane and they'll just have some cut out with a fake Muslim name and put a
[16:26.960 --> 16:33.320]  guy on the news I mean that's how they do it we know the 7-7 guys
[16:34.440 --> 16:37.600]  and I had some cracker jacks out there during the break and I've got one of
[16:37.600 --> 16:42.760]  those little pits right underneath my tongue is driving me crazy
[16:42.760 --> 16:58.760]  all right continuing here we've got all of that happening and again there's
[16:58.760 --> 17:02.480]  hundreds of these headlines all of them totally insane but Hillary Clinton
[17:02.480 --> 17:06.280]  Mitch US and Al Qaeda on same side in Syria they use the group to take over
[17:06.280 --> 17:10.760]  Libya they're using them to attack Iran they use them to attack the Serbs used
[17:10.760 --> 17:16.240]  them to attack the Russians used them to take the fall for attacking the US
[17:16.240 --> 17:21.360]  you're like well what is Al Qaeda get well the bin Laden family had their US
[17:21.360 --> 17:27.400]  government contracts tripled through the Carl all group and other systems the
[17:27.400 --> 17:32.360]  year after 9-11 tripled the number I saw was they made an extra 4 billion in US
[17:32.360 --> 17:38.040]  government military contracts the bin Laden construction builds almost every
[17:38.040 --> 17:43.000]  US military base in the Middle East and Central Asia and the London Guardian
[17:43.000 --> 17:46.920]  reported the head of the bin Laden family in George Herbert Walker Bush were
[17:46.920 --> 17:51.680]  at breakfast that the morning of 9-11 at the same table at a Carlisle group
[17:51.680 --> 17:56.400]  luncheon in DC and then of course for three days air traffic was grounded for
[17:56.400 --> 18:00.840]  two and a half days and only the bin Laden flights more than 15 were allowed
[18:00.840 --> 18:06.000]  to go all over the US pick people up with US government guarding them and you
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.480]  know FBI to tell locals no you let them go Roger Roger you know these are the
[18:10.480 --> 18:14.680]  bosses and get them on those aircraft including bin Laden's brother bin Laden
[18:14.680 --> 18:21.120]  sister get them out get them out bin Laden family hanging out with the
[18:21.120 --> 18:25.320]  president former president and again these are real articles these are this
[18:25.320 --> 18:30.880]  is Miami Herald this is London Guardian this is this is all happening we've got
[18:30.880 --> 18:35.360]  Forbes representative Marsha Blackburn I want to try to get her on the TSA is
[18:35.360 --> 18:39.240]  coming to a highway near you and she's freaking out saying they're in Tennessee
[18:39.240 --> 18:43.280]  running checkpoints and she says they're not sworn law enforcement and the feds
[18:43.280 --> 18:48.880]  are out of their jurisdiction and she wants it stopped and she first grovels
[18:48.880 --> 18:52.520]  to regular police and military for a couple pages to say look I want to say
[18:52.520 --> 18:56.200]  I'm not criticizing good law enforcement and real law enforcement these are
[18:56.200 --> 19:00.280]  basically potbelly thugs and she's right government created that because the
[19:00.280 --> 19:03.480]  police have been trained to know there's a bill of rights and Constitution they
[19:03.480 --> 19:06.920]  can't stick their hands down your pants so you create a brown shirt group like
[19:06.920 --> 19:10.720]  Hitler did Stalin did the same thing of the new group of thugs who were so
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.480]  stupid they'll follow any order and sit there in front of microwave ovens frying
[19:14.480 --> 19:18.000]  but I mean it's all coming out I mean they're in Dallas they're everywhere and
[19:18.000 --> 19:23.840]  then we tell you they are doing that the genital grope on the highway they're
[19:23.840 --> 19:27.520]  pulling you out and do a little gropey gropey there and that's my line in the
[19:27.520 --> 19:34.960]  sand you crazy authoritarian jackboot people trying to break our will and beta
[19:34.960 --> 19:38.920]  test here running okay I don't even scratch the surface but I'm gonna get into
[19:38.920 --> 19:47.440]  the Andrew Breitbart situation on the other side and it's funny I never thought

[19:50.680 --> 19:55.900]  weeks ago and it was gonna happen and he's dead so that link up I guess won't
[19:55.900 --> 19:59.720]  happen I guess I need to try to get whoever's over there in charge now on
[19:59.720 --> 20:04.560]  the show a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why

[20:08.440 --> 20:12.880]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[20:12.880 --> 20:16.200]  here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[20:16.200 --> 20:21.280]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that

[27:03.160 --> 27:07.520]  down more than anybody and put the news and and gave the investigators the
[27:07.520 --> 27:11.600]  funding and the forum to break Acron and their crimes and to shut down a

[35:22.560 --> 35:26.600]  think they'd kill him I mean they're saying he's walking around he collapses
[35:26.600 --> 35:30.320]  and I went and looked it up this morning when I got up at about 6 a.m. it
[35:30.320 --> 35:33.800]  started getting calls and instant messages on my phone about this and
[35:33.800 --> 35:39.040]  emails I went and looked it up within a couple hours of him being at the
[35:39.040 --> 35:43.320]  hospital it was already in the LA Times and news that it's totally natural we
[35:43.320 --> 35:47.720]  don't know why he died but it's natural nothing to see here move along now if
[35:47.720 --> 35:50.640]  they came out and said I we don't know why he's dead we're gonna look at it I
[35:50.640 --> 35:54.320]  would say okay maybe he died of something maybe an infection maybe a heart
[35:54.320 --> 36:00.040]  attack but the fact that they were immediate immediate folks within hours
[36:00.040 --> 36:04.360]  of the DC madam hanging herself they said oh suicide note oh she killed
[36:04.360 --> 36:07.440]  herself oh and then some guy came out of the woodwork there was no proof she
[36:07.440 --> 36:11.200]  ever knew saying oh she told me she was gonna kill herself really she told me
[36:11.200 --> 36:14.480]  on air she would never kill herself and then I and then she was being followed
[36:14.480 --> 36:18.840]  off air she told me that and then I talked to her apartment manager condo
[36:18.840 --> 36:22.800]  manager she was friends with on record had him on the show and he said she was
[36:22.800 --> 36:27.160]  being followed and threatened and was scared and was getting documents to her
[36:27.160 --> 36:35.320]  mother for safekeeping and then was found dead in the shed at mommy's they
[36:35.320 --> 36:40.880]  murdered the DC madam even Fox News said she may have been murdered and had me
[36:40.880 --> 36:45.960]  on to cover it on her Aldo Rivera show of all places and he agreed it was
[36:45.960 --> 36:52.080]  suspicious now I don't know what happened to Andrew Breitbart I don't know and
[36:52.080 --> 36:57.280]  they're saying well he might have had some hard issues before whatever 43 dead
[36:57.280 --> 37:02.840]  and out of the gates they say nothing to see here move along now what did I say
[37:02.840 --> 37:06.320]  three weeks ago and I'm actually got our limited crew trying to dig it up
[37:06.320 --> 37:11.120]  remember like a whole week I said they're they're blackmailing Rupert Murdoch I
[37:11.120 --> 37:15.560]  said on a Sunday show a Monday show and like a Thursday show I mean it was like
[37:15.560 --> 37:19.800]  two three weeks ago it's about three weeks ago and I said they're blackmailing
[37:19.800 --> 37:24.000]  Rupert Murdoch they've already arrested eight more people they're using this to
[37:24.000 --> 37:27.560]  make them back off-fashioned furious and have news corps come out and tell all
[37:27.560 --> 37:30.760]  their hosts and I've talked to people behind the scenes back off Obama
[37:30.760 --> 37:36.040]  Soros wins media matters wins anybody talking about the New World Order's
[37:36.040 --> 37:41.760]  fired media matters had called for Judge Andrew Napolitano's firing it
[37:41.760 --> 37:48.120]  happened they called for it because he'd come on my show and other issues and
[37:48.120 --> 37:51.600]  because he was talking about Ron Paul being the real front-runner he's gone
[37:51.600 --> 37:55.880]  and I took night he's not the guy I talked to behind the scenes I talked to
[37:55.880 --> 38:01.800]  a couple other people the point is is I said you watch they may even indict
[38:01.800 --> 38:06.880]  Rupert Murdoch or his son and you may start seeing media people getting
[38:06.880 --> 38:12.160]  indicted getting set up getting arrested or dying and I said on that show if
[38:12.160 --> 38:16.800]  something starts happening to the real alternative media and I even said one of
[38:16.800 --> 38:22.280]  those shows people like Breitbart people like Drudge people like Buchanan
[38:22.280 --> 38:27.360]  people like myself you notice Buchanan got fired even though he's one of the
[38:27.360 --> 38:33.240]  most popular people on MSNBC and he said he was told shut up don't be anti-war
[38:33.240 --> 38:39.600]  shut up don't be anti-patriot act shut up don't be anti-NDAA shut up don't be
[38:39.600 --> 38:43.600]  anti-Obama and so for six months he couldn't go on air because he wouldn't
[38:43.600 --> 38:46.640]  compromise and shut up so he was off the air for six months still being paid
[38:46.640 --> 38:52.760]  contracts up you're gone Pat Buchanan get out of here you're gone judge the
[38:52.760 --> 38:55.920]  Politanos see I know what's going on behind the scenes I talked to people and
[38:55.920 --> 39:01.280]  I know how this works let me give you some news Fox News pundits have been
[39:01.280 --> 39:06.880]  told back off Obama at least 50% and that's why you suddenly saw Huckabee
[39:06.880 --> 39:11.000]  and others say he's a man of the Lord he's a good man he loves America Obama's
[39:11.000 --> 39:16.760]  a good person you and you're seeing a lot of them start going I like Obama
[39:16.760 --> 39:22.560]  O'Reilly and others you're now seeing it Glenn Beck's gone you notice as soon as
[39:22.560 --> 39:26.160]  this investigation started a year ago a news score bribing people paying off
[39:26.160 --> 39:30.560]  police which is wrong but it's standard procedure at that level of media paying
[39:30.560 --> 39:34.920]  police for info paying police for access for murders for politicians for
[39:34.920 --> 39:40.000]  anything that's how it's done I've never done it but I happen to know even local
[39:40.000 --> 39:48.680]  media it's about access you invite the market even get into it the point is you
[39:48.680 --> 39:53.200]  know it goes on so they're going after him for basically dirt under their
[39:53.200 --> 39:56.200]  fingernails and I'm not saying it's good I do not sing news course a good
[39:56.200 --> 40:00.240]  organization the point is Obama's caught shipping guns into Mexico he's caught
[40:00.240 --> 40:03.880]  blaming the second amendment he's caught is giving it billions of dollars the
[40:03.880 --> 40:08.720]  energy companies is fronts acorn all of it I mean this is a mafia group gutting
[40:08.720 --> 40:14.120]  the nation and they're playing hardball so they start firing police the main
[40:14.120 --> 40:19.240]  witness who blew the whistle on Murdoch dies at his house and within hours they
[40:19.240 --> 40:23.960]  say nothing to worry about he his neighbors all came out five different
[40:23.960 --> 40:27.400]  neighbors at least and said he was hiding had the blinds closed and said
[40:27.400 --> 40:31.760]  they were threatening to killing whoever they are and then he's dead in his
[40:31.760 --> 40:36.880]  house and the police within hours say nothing to worry about suicide no big
[40:36.880 --> 40:40.760]  deal I mean you're hiding in your house telling your neighbors watch my house
[40:40.760 --> 40:43.960]  if anything happens to me they killed me they're after me and then you're dead
[40:43.960 --> 40:48.880]  and the police come and say nothing to worry about that's like Princess Diana
[40:48.880 --> 40:55.120]  she wrote letters her diary and a video that was confiscated by Scotland Yard
[40:55.120 --> 41:00.200]  this is all in the mainstream news years ago years after it was rumors it all
[41:00.200 --> 41:05.200]  came out told her butler everybody her butler is the one that blew the whistle
[41:05.200 --> 41:09.040]  her assistant really is what a butler is
[41:09.440 --> 41:13.320]  she told him she shot a video with professional lighting everything saying
[41:13.320 --> 41:19.000]  Prince Charles told me if I marry this guy I will die in a fake auto accident
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.040]  because Charles obviously talked to his intel people that's how they liked it
[41:22.040 --> 41:27.760]  their favorite way to kill you is to drug you put you in a vehicle smash a
[41:27.760 --> 41:31.480]  truck into it and then that doesn't kill you killing the way the hospital or
[41:31.480 --> 41:36.080]  they remote control the car wait here going fast steering into a pylon that's
[41:36.080 --> 41:39.720]  gone on for decades and that's declassified went on in the 50s well
[41:39.720 --> 41:44.600]  that's how they started to kill Patton but he was too tough they they they drove
[41:44.600 --> 41:49.280]  a truck into him shot and this has all been leaked as well shot him in the
[41:49.280 --> 41:54.240]  face with a bolt gun a big bolt to break his neck didn't break his neck as he was
[41:54.240 --> 41:58.440]  as strong as a horse then they poisoned it but well that's what they do they
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.960]  slam a truck into you this is on record favorite way but I'm digressing
[42:02.960 --> 42:08.920]  anybody slams the truck into me I wear my seatbelt I've got airbags I buy
[42:08.920 --> 42:14.240]  cars that have steel safety cages I'm okay I've been killed I want an
[42:14.240 --> 42:18.040]  investigation of why the ambulance takes an hour to get there like Princess
[42:18.040 --> 42:22.640]  Diana who was moving around and seemed fighting by witnesses they went killed
[42:22.640 --> 42:26.520]  her in the back of that car then drove around waiting for 45 minutes when it
[42:26.520 --> 42:30.960]  was a hospital three minutes away and the roads were blocked all the cameras
[42:30.960 --> 42:35.240]  turned off five minutes before the wreck I can go on here and she did a video a
[42:35.240 --> 42:40.200]  letter a diary and eyewitnesses the cameraman have gone public her butler
[42:40.200 --> 42:43.480]  did the media called it a conspiracy theory until the government admitted yes
[42:43.480 --> 42:47.960]  we confiscated that tape Charles told her I'm gonna have you killed in a fake
[42:47.960 --> 42:53.000]  auto accident do you understand you're not marrying that rich Arab guy well she
[42:53.000 --> 42:59.320]  got pregnant with him that was it the Royals are extremely into race I mean
[42:59.320 --> 43:03.160]  the Kingdom King of England who had to advocate was an open Nazi look it up he
[43:03.160 --> 43:06.840]  was in Europe when World War two started and barely got out of Spain through
[43:06.840 --> 43:12.600]  Portugal it was over there with Franco he was gonna be the puppet king when the
[43:12.600 --> 43:18.080]  point is ladies and gentlemen is that you can even have videos saying here's
[43:18.080 --> 43:22.160]  the guy's gonna kill me in a fake auto accident I've been warned it doesn't
[43:22.160 --> 43:31.240]  matter honey if they want to kill you they do of course so dr. David Kelly
[43:31.240 --> 43:35.040]  what even the foreign secretary went public and said Al Qaeda's fake so they
[43:35.040 --> 43:41.400]  killed him in a fake heart attack a few weeks later what page then then there's
[43:41.400 --> 43:43.920]  dr. David Kelly they had weapons inspector says it's totally fake but I've
[43:43.920 --> 43:47.360]  been told he sent us to emails to over 50 people over all bunch of colleagues
[43:47.360 --> 43:54.480]  I'll be killed in a and found dead in the woods locals even saw the police in
[43:54.480 --> 43:58.160]  black uniforms who ran who were dumping the body and ran away that was even in
[43:58.160 --> 44:03.080]  a few of the papers witnesses even saw the guys in black uniforms dumping his
[44:03.080 --> 44:08.520]  body his wrists were slit no blood undissolved pills in his stomach the
[44:08.520 --> 44:11.880]  coroners have gone public said yeah he was murdered but you're a conspiracy
[44:11.880 --> 44:16.240]  terrorist they killed dr. David Kelly they kill Pulitzer prize winner Gary Webb
[44:16.240 --> 44:20.680]  for his Dark Alliance series on government drug dealing they killed
[44:20.680 --> 44:25.760]  Princess Diana they killed Kennedy out in front of everybody and I'm telling you
[44:25.760 --> 44:36.160]  Andrew Breitbart spawned by the great drudge was you could disagree with his
[44:36.160 --> 44:40.640]  pro-war stance you could disagree with all that but he was an anti-globalist
[44:40.640 --> 44:44.480]  anti-New World Order guy they were starting to carry some of my stuff he
[44:44.480 --> 44:51.120]  doesn't like communist or didn't he doesn't like elitism it's over now he
[44:51.120 --> 44:56.480]  may I give it 20% chance he died of natural causes and and why do I say
[44:56.480 --> 44:59.720]  that and of course the family and others I don't blame them you want to be
[44:59.720 --> 45:02.600]  naive you don't want to be scared they're coming after you people get
[45:02.600 --> 45:05.600]  threatened when this happens I've later confirmed that with others down the
[45:05.600 --> 45:12.400]  rub police get threatened I've had police officers on this show multiple of
[45:12.400 --> 45:16.720]  three different ones over the years last one was Browning head of the canine
[45:16.720 --> 45:21.920]  unit sergeant sees the feds in Oklahoma City minutes after starts talking about
[45:21.920 --> 45:25.600]  it and they came in his office and in the hallway two separate occasions and
[45:25.600 --> 45:31.200]  said you keep investigating us you and your wife are dead you understand he went
[45:31.200 --> 45:36.720]  to you know goes this police chief is told well you're being investigated buddy
[45:36.720 --> 45:44.720]  so it's time to grow up in America and I know what I'm facing I know what I'm
[45:44.720 --> 45:49.320]  facing they don't come to me offering me national TV shows anymore they don't come
[45:49.320 --> 45:52.800]  to me offering you know the big establishment syndicated show I don't
[45:52.800 --> 45:58.480]  get offers anymore they know I'm real they know I built my own system thanks
[45:58.480 --> 46:04.280]  to your support and don't cry for me if they kill me realize they killed me
[46:04.280 --> 46:07.880]  because it was a life worth leading and I did it with pride for human dignity
[46:07.880 --> 46:13.560]  and I was a man of courage and action and dedication because I know the cost
[46:13.560 --> 46:17.120]  somebody's got to say no to these people they're their own worst enemies
[46:17.120 --> 46:20.800]  they're gonna destroy us if someone doesn't start saying no to them they're
[46:20.800 --> 46:25.000]  out of control they have hubris they have the same disease Napoleon and Caesar
[46:25.000 --> 46:32.360]  had they're crazy crazy like a fox nevertheless crazy if they do kill me
[46:32.360 --> 46:36.160]  who will take my place that's what you've got to understand ideas are
[46:36.160 --> 46:40.560]  bulletproof and for heaven's sakes don't let them blow my brains out and kill
[46:40.560 --> 46:44.400]  some hooker or something and put me in a hotel room or shoot pull me over shoot
[46:44.400 --> 46:48.440]  me up with heroin or something and 70 if any of that happens or I die of a
[46:48.440 --> 46:55.920]  heart attack at 39 or whatever it's bull okay it's bull and if Ron Paul dies
[46:55.920 --> 47:01.520]  they go well he's 75 it's baloney folks because look at the time when all this
[47:01.520 --> 47:06.800]  is happening this is real these retirees that have taken over our country they
[47:06.800 --> 47:10.600]  think it's theirs and and I told you look that they got rid of Buchanan the
[47:10.600 --> 47:16.000]  same week they got rid of Judge Napolitano the same week they're doing
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.440]  all sorts of dirty tricks behind us behind the scenes and I'm not even gonna
[47:18.440 --> 47:24.520]  give attention just pray for us they are pulling out all the stops because
[47:24.520 --> 47:27.320]  they're getting ready for a big war and and this open global government take
[47:27.320 --> 47:32.520]  over and here it is I told you this was coming London independent Murdoch
[47:32.520 --> 47:36.160]  junior flies away from trouble but it may follow him to America the Fox
[47:36.160 --> 47:42.640]  executives are all running from England from Britain from the UK I told you that
[47:42.640 --> 47:46.080]  was coming next and they're talking about the Justice Department and
[47:46.080 --> 47:49.560]  guiding him here and that's why suddenly it's going to be the Obama
[47:49.560 --> 47:55.080]  worship channel you think they like me up here exposing the Obama wrote the
[47:55.080 --> 47:58.680]  NDAA and then said he was against it and then signed it you think they like me
[47:58.680 --> 48:03.480]  covering fascin furious every day these are crooks they can be brought down but
[48:03.480 --> 48:08.840]  I'm going up against murderers and I need your support let me tell you if Matt
[48:08.840 --> 48:14.080]  drudge gets set up or killed yeah and they say he fell off a fell off a you
[48:14.080 --> 48:18.560]  know his his bicycle or whatever if more of this starts happening ladies and
[48:18.560 --> 48:25.520]  gentlemen we know what's going on we know who did it okay the system will
[48:25.520 --> 48:28.480]  find out if you got a heart problem whatever they'll make it look like it
[48:28.480 --> 48:32.680]  that's all been declassified and the answer is don't bow down to these guys
[48:32.680 --> 48:39.640]  the answer is turbo charge in their face if we don't see the Breitbart Empire
[48:39.640 --> 48:43.600]  release the video he said he would release of Obama if we don't see all
[48:43.600 --> 48:48.520]  this exposed if we don't see all this brought out if we see them start backing
[48:48.520 --> 48:53.120]  off we know that people are being infiltrated and you got to know there's
[48:53.120 --> 48:56.440]  an infiltration of a group that big you've got to know they're under
[48:56.440 --> 48:59.760]  surveillance you've got to know people have been threatened or paid off we
[48:59.760 --> 49:04.920]  better see that video release right now for all your own safety you idiots if
[49:04.920 --> 49:09.720]  anybody inside his organization is a mole you're gonna be killed later don't
[49:09.720 --> 49:12.720]  think you're gonna be infiltrated and paid off by the White House and by the
[49:12.720 --> 49:16.640]  CIA and by these foreign banking espionage groups and that you're not
[49:16.640 --> 49:21.200]  gonna be dealt with later if you know anything about this your only hope is
[49:21.200 --> 49:28.600]  to go public right now with a YouTube video right now or you're dead you
[49:28.600 --> 49:32.880]  understand that they'll kill you after the election if we start seeing more
[49:32.880 --> 49:38.120]  people over there die the only answer to this is to fire up and go head up
[49:38.120 --> 49:42.880]  against them I mean I know the telltale signs oh we might have had some heart
[49:42.880 --> 49:48.480]  problems we're not sure but we know it's it's nothing fishy when law says the
[49:48.480 --> 49:53.880]  coroner medical examiner by law law law law I mean Fannie Malik the Arkansas
[49:53.880 --> 49:57.240]  medical examiner people would have their heads cut off people be found in trash
[49:57.240 --> 50:01.960]  dumps burned arms and legs cut off they would machine gun police off the road
[50:01.960 --> 50:06.360]  that we're doing investigations and then say they committed suicide with with
[50:06.360 --> 50:12.480]  hundreds of bullet holes in their car Fannie Malik Arkansas and your
[50:12.480 --> 50:17.200]  conspiracy theorist if you look at it okay I've interviewed the police
[50:17.200 --> 50:21.160]  officers where the FBI comes into their office and says you and your wife are
[50:21.160 --> 50:30.880]  dead if you don't back off look the FBI and ATF and Delta Force on record burn
[50:30.880 --> 50:34.360]  down Waco blew up the church records vault with the kids hiding in it and
[50:34.360 --> 50:38.640]  then posed with their skulls on top of tanks I mean even if you got to kill

[54:22.120 --> 54:26.280]  video there's also text where Andrew Breitbart said that he was going to go
[54:26.280 --> 54:33.000]  public and basically destroy Obama and he got up he challenged him he was not
[54:33.000 --> 54:38.240]  controlled right you can say what you want he was real and because you know
[54:38.240 --> 54:40.880]  the mainstream folks aren't trying to bring down organizations because they
[54:40.880 --> 54:45.360]  know it's mafia I mean you think a current some estimates were getting more
[54:45.360 --> 54:48.600]  than 10 billion a year you think they're a little upset over not getting that
[54:48.600 --> 54:53.880]  money now to find their takeover local government or they can then get the
[54:53.880 --> 54:58.680]  larger public purse into their troughs think they're a little mad about that
[54:58.680 --> 55:03.520]  think when he says I got footage folks here's the telltale sign if they don't
[55:03.520 --> 55:08.440]  release the footage you know they're being threatened I'm telling them and
[55:08.440 --> 55:15.600]  by the way I got some inside sources I've got a reporter who knew Andrew
[55:15.600 --> 55:19.320]  Breitbart very well personally he was offered a job there but didn't want to
[55:19.320 --> 55:23.920]  move to California we're gonna get him on during the third hour after Ed
[55:23.920 --> 55:28.920]  Hasner comes up at the eight after I'm gonna try to get that reporter on right
[55:28.920 --> 55:33.600]  now he says he knew him he was fine this just stinks to high heaven was been
[55:33.600 --> 55:38.920]  calling us in 6 a.m. this morning and that's what man Cal saying who knew him
[55:38.920 --> 55:43.000]  maybe it was a heart attack maybe he had held stuff but I'm telling you this
[55:43.000 --> 55:48.960]  stinks let's go ahead and go to this video of him just a couple weeks ago
[55:48.960 --> 55:54.320]  what is this this is February 11th the day
[55:57.760 --> 56:03.400]  yeah I had the date earlier it's on one of the videos but I'll get it here he is
[56:03.400 --> 56:09.720]  just a few weeks ago speaking out here it is and so what do we get now in
[56:09.720 --> 56:15.040]  Barack Obama well I've got videos by the way this election we're going to vet
[56:15.040 --> 56:22.440]  him I've got videos this election we're going to vet him from his college days to
[56:22.440 --> 56:38.240]  show you why to show you why racial division and class warfare are central
[56:38.240 --> 56:45.080]  to what hope and change was sold in 2008 the videos are going to come out the
[56:45.080 --> 56:50.240]  narrative is going to come out the Barack Obama met a bunch of silver pony
[56:50.240 --> 56:57.600]  tails back in the 1980s like Bill and Bernadine Dorn who equally radical said
[56:57.600 --> 57:02.760]  one day we're gonna have the presidency and the rest of us slept well they
[57:02.760 --> 57:06.920]  plotted and they plotted and they plotted and they oversaw hundreds of
[57:06.920 --> 57:11.680]  millions of dollars in the Annenberg challenge and they had real money from
[57:11.680 --> 57:16.520]  real capitalists who gave it on to their children and their children's
[57:16.520 --> 57:20.720]  children and then they become communists we got to work on that we got to work on
[57:20.720 --> 57:23.960]  that that's a parenthesis
[57:25.920 --> 57:32.200]  Barack Obama is a radical we should not be afraid to say that okay alright
[57:32.200 --> 57:38.320]  folks the rest of the clip is up at info wars.com and he gave that speech to the
[57:38.320 --> 57:46.840]  American conservative Union on February 10th about 20 days ago and up at info
[57:46.840 --> 57:54.720]  wars.com right now we've got Kurt Nemo's report establishment Gadfly Andrew
[57:54.720 --> 58:00.160]  Breitbart dead at 43 Soros media matters and Acorn can now breathe a sigh of
[58:00.160 --> 58:06.480]  relief and Paul Watson and the Alex Jones report will damning Obama footage
[58:06.480 --> 58:12.880]  still be released after Breitbart's death and he said we got video we got a
[58:12.880 --> 58:20.840]  plan we're gonna expose him boom dead boom and that's the exact time they come
[58:20.840 --> 58:26.280]  after you when you got something like the DC Madame's client list and stuff
[58:26.280 --> 58:31.640]  like that that's when you better release it the minute you get it you do not shit
[58:31.640 --> 58:35.280]  on this stuff we've gotten big bombshell stuff and let me tell you
[58:35.280 --> 58:40.960]  something I don't sit on it not five seconds
[58:42.440 --> 58:51.720]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.720 --> 58:55.440]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.440 --> 58:59.040]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[58:59.040 --> 59:03.360]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[59:03.360 --> 59:07.320]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[59:07.320 --> 59:11.680]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[59:11.680 --> 59:16.000]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.760]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[59:19.760 --> 59:23.880]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[59:23.880 --> 59:27.840]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[59:27.840 --> 59:31.680]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[59:31.680 --> 59:34.400]  really believe in the solar powered generators offered by solutions from
[59:34.400 --> 59:40.400]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[59:40.400 --> 59:44.120]  that's my solar back up dot com remember the government doesn't own the
[59:44.120 --> 59:54.760]  sun so go to my solar back up dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 waging war on
[59:54.760 --> 01:00:00.680]  corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:12.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:19.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:25.760]  Alex Jones okay Ed Asner former head of the Screen Actors Guild hundreds of
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:33.200]  films top TV shows icon who I don't agree with some of his financial ideas you
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:36.680]  know socialism but I know he means well he understands the big banks steal it
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.600]  all through systems so he says why not redistribute but I respect him because
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:46.480]  of his courage on 9-11 truth exposing vaccines and more he's a real guy and I
[01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:49.880]  wanted to do a you know close to an hour interview with him he joined us for about
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:55.240]  20 minutes a few weeks ago so he's joined us for a full most of a full hour
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.800]  coming up and then in the third hour I'll get into all the other news your
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:03.520]  phone calls we have a reporter popping in who knew Andrew Breitbart and he just
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:09.600]  says this thing that stinks to I Heaven is a death sometime after midnight he was
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:13.920]  supposedly walking around and collapsed went to the hospital and then died and
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.280]  within hours they said well it's totally natural we don't know why I died
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.520]  everybody go back to sleep and that's what suspicious now they're saying well
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.600]  it might have been a heart problem well again why you have a medical examiner is
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:29.840]  they said that Sirhan Sirhan didn't shoot RFK you know that's on record the
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.720]  police at that time actually weren't corrupt enough to lie the LAPD came out
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.200]  and said no he was shot with a different caliber Sirhan Sirhan's arm was pinned
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:43.800]  down and shot into the side in the ceiling first it was held up and then
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.360]  pinned down and the coroner said he was shot with another caliber that's all
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:51.480]  public been public but the public never get digs into that so it just becomes a
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:59.120]  rumor that was in the LA Times back you know the days after they killed Bobby
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.960]  Kennedy then Attorney General who was winning in the primaries and it turned
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.320]  out top CIA guys were in attendance and they had a CIA guy from the local
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.320]  skunks works doing the shooting who was right behind him as his assigned
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:15.560]  security that day that's where the coroner said he was shot with that
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.560]  caliber in the back we know the names everything but because people don't go
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:25.160]  dig up the original info it's like oh I heard they killed him I heard that no
[01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:29.400]  now it's on record they drug Sirhan Sirhan with an amnesiac rolled him in
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:34.200]  he plays the part of the patsy oldest thing in the book they drugged up
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:41.240]  Marinus Vanderloop a Dutch illegal alien stripped him down naked throwing
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.040]  down the side of the road by the Capitol building and had the Nazis
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:49.400]  arresting for firebombing their own Capitol February 27th 1933 and you
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.880]  know the rest of the story terrorists have hit the Capitol the Fuhrer has to
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:59.560]  take all your rights down become dirt leader to protect us oldest trick in the
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:04.960]  book nudging us pushing us into accepting it and I'm telling you they're
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:08.040]  gonna go after all of us with stage terror attacks that's on the front
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.720]  burner that's a real possibility I'm not saying it's gonna happen but they're
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.560]  looking at it I mean all these White House advisors are putting out policy
[01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.400]  reports saying it sure helped have an Oklahoma City we can blame it on the
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:24.400]  libertarian right wingers Obama that's only gonna save you financial times of
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:31.840]  London Robert Shapiro a bunch of others we've read their quotes you're like but
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:37.000]  why are they so obvious because they think you're idiots that's why and so
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:41.400]  if you're a Fed in a federal building and a bomb goes off just have a video
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.440]  camera get through the smoke if you've survived and videotape and wonder why
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:48.960]  there's gonna be federal agents right there dressed up in bomb gear I mean
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:59.360]  because and I know maybe it's like Stockholm syndrome where a lot of you
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.440]  will see them there and you won't even care you'll never even think because
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.800]  they're good guys you're good guys what matter they just tried to kill you what
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.800]  matter they just killed a bunch of people you're so mentally weak even though a
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:12.760]  lot of feds catch feds doing stuff it's like what are you doing loading opium on
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:17.680]  this C-130 well we're told to in Afghanistan and so so much of that came
[01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:21.400]  out they just said we'll just put it on the news they grow it they ship it to
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.600]  America when you use it you go to a prison owned by a defense contractor
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.760]  who ships in the drugs that's why when a cop pulls me over and asks can I
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.520]  search your car I just heard laughing I mean like I mean is this a joke buddy
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:40.560]  boy is this a joke you ship the drugs in been caught over and over again from
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:46.280]  Vietnam through Iran contra right through to today and you're wanting to
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:50.240]  search my car you work for the government by extension you've probably
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.800]  got drugs in your car I'm not saying you do but you are more guilty than me if
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:05:00.400]  we've got this presumed guilt you make me want to throw up

[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.640]  minutes Ed Asner is our guest he visited with us for about 20 minutes a few
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:33.960]  weeks ago but he's come back for a most of a full hour with us today that will
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:38.160]  continue with phone calls and incredible news Forbes is reporting the TSA is
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:41.680]  coming to a highway near you that's 10 years after I told you that was their
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:46.160]  official plan I was watching c-span saw him say it I like I'm a rocket scientist
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:50.560]  here it's pretty much this program of total takeover is a public we'll be
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:55.720]  getting into that as well but Ed Asner joins us to talk about a host of issues
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.680]  I'm going to be talking to and getting one of those Navy seals on very very
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.200]  soon that have warned Ed that they're planning a false flag it's funny a few
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.840]  days after Ed talked about that clapper the head of the National Security
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:14.000]  Council went public and said in a Brookings Institute report a provocation
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.120]  is needed with Iran of course we know Dick Cheney wrote the PNAC document the
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:25.960]  year before 9-11 and said we need a new Pearl Harbor as a pretext so they talked
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:30.040]  to us like we're idiots they they operate out in the open with this it was
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:34.560]  Sy Hirsch bullet surprise winner a year after Bush was out of office he was
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.200]  scared to do it while he was in office because I know we exchanged emails and I
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:42.360]  talked to her and he wasn't ready to come on at the time but but later after
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:46.440]  Bush was out he published it high-level White House folks told him Cheney
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:54.440]  wanted to paint up boats like Navy seals basically use but but camouflage them
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.440]  to look like Iranian boats paint them up like Iranian boats to then attack U.S.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.680]  destroyers and of course Admiral Fox foul on the head of scent comes said no
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:08.840]  and spoke out against Bush and was basically removed from command via that
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:13.440]  Esquire article so there been same people in the military that have already
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.720]  stopped this repeatedly so false flags are real and when Navy seals are warning
[01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:23.760]  Ed Asner you you've got to know it's serious I want to get back into that
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:26.960]  with Ed and then I asked him the question off air we're talking about it on
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:32.560]  air why don't more celebrities why don't more people period go public and talk
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:36.440]  about what's happening and point out that the Emperor has no clothes but but
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.760]  first off Ed thank you so much for coming on with you you really don't need
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:46.400]  any introduction you're an award-winning actor director hundreds of films you
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:49.840]  name it with all the greats out there former head of the screen actors Gil I
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.720]  think one of the longest serving the star of the Mary Tyler Moore show your own
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.360]  Lou Grant show and of course that got politically attacked we should probably
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:03.760]  talk about that censorship all of this going on and you join us now here today
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.480]  but but but out of the gates days after you came on about false flags Ed then it
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:13.600]  actually started coming out in the news where they're openly talking about a
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:18.560]  pretext with Iran and or trying to prod them into something I mean why do you
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:27.120]  think they're so brazen now sir I think they they they create a witch's brew
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:36.840]  and they got to keep stirring it and they certainly will keep looking for new
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:43.680]  ways to create the false flag so that as as much as the public may get alerted to
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:49.520]  the idea of false flag trying to make it as convincing as possible will will be
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:55.640]  the only way that they can sell this this this new witches brew you know a new
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:06.120]  improved formula let's call it I and and by talking about false flag now making
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:13.320]  it common parlance we we are all on our toes and and and and ready to receive
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:18.960]  these these rumors and we get all excited and they accomplish their mission by
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:26.640]  keeping us off balance even if they don't do it so that so that we are ready
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:31.880]  for any provocation and we're jittery over any provocation and if the
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:36.760]  provocation doesn't come then we can pat ourselves on the back by saying well
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:44.200]  we stopped it but they'll come up with I mean one one good example if for some
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:52.400]  reason they found a way for Israel to to to trigger a an action against Iran and
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.640]  and they they have to be careful in responding to that action the Iranian
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:04.840]  that is so they respond within a limited way and then it'll be a limited war but
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.560]  of course if they go beyond that and attack some of the US boats in the Gulf
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:16.960]  of Hormuz the Straits of Hormuz then it can easily expand and of course that's
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:24.040]  why we talk about false flag operations the danger of it somehow becoming more
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:31.600]  magnified than it was originally planned to be now Israel and Iran strictly
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:37.280]  restrict their actions against each other and it doesn't go wide spread from
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:43.000]  that then everything's okay we we're still not responsible for Israel
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.160]  supposedly but what happens if it expands if there's a mistake and we get
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:55.800]  involved what is more American troops pouring into the Middle East well
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:59.760]  undoubtedly I have family in the military I have a lot of sources and since
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.320]  I reported on this a year ago now it's it's an open secret that they're
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:08.760]  massing US troops in and around Iran in and around Syria they're using al-Qaeda
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:13.080]  proxy groups to attack Libya and now Syria and I'm not a fan of Qaddafi I'm not
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:18.080]  a fan of Assad but compared to what they're putting in bringing in the Arab
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.920]  fighters out of Saudi Arabia exterminating blacks genocide black
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:27.720]  Africans that's now admitted and the witches brew is destabilization that's
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:33.240]  the goal and they're now now the admitted al-Qaeda groups are on record saying
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:39.040]  once they've taken over Syria they're going to purge and pogrom the Christians
[01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:42.480]  and Jews that have been there for thousands and thousands years Christians
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.440]  for 2,000 Jews for over 3,000 in Syria this is all being announced in
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:52.400]  Hillary's in the BBC today we have an article in infowars.com ad Hillary
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:57.040]  Clinton admits US and al-Qaeda on same side as Syria US and France arm rebels
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:01.680]  with anti-aircraft missiles in an interview of BBC she said quote we have
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:06.160]  a very dangerous set of actors in the region al-Qaeda Hamas and those who are
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.520]  on our terrace list to be sure supporting claiming to support the
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.920]  opposition in Syria so they're having the cake and eating it to acting like
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:17.200]  they're not arming them I mean how do they say we should give up all our rights
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.760]  ahead and have checkpoints on highways and TSA groping us and all of this
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.160]  because of al-Qaeda but then it's on record the US government got the
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.320]  underwear bomber on the plane because Kurt Haskell our listener saw it happen
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:34.080]  reported it and then a month and a half later the State Department had to admit
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:37.400]  in Congress they were ordered to get him on the plane I mean how obvious is this
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:46.280]  again and well you strike up you know I could where I'm like Alice falling down
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:54.800]  the rabbit hole how can we speak of of any conversation with al-Qaeda how can
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:00.480]  how can we in any way show any familiar you can say well the Taliban are a
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:08.000]  religious group within within Afghanistan you you you will try to maybe
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:15.440]  make a deal with them but when al-Qaeda who is expressly opposed to anything we
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:24.920]  stand for and wish our destruction and is credited with 9-11 supposedly how
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:32.120]  could we even talk about talking to them how does this take place and we sit here
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:39.040]  numbing our heads oh so we're talking to al-Qaeda well since when and who said
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:45.520]  it's okay it is the twilight zone it is Alice in wonderland believe me I feel
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:50.600]  like I'm in wonderland every day I mean here's Forbes today the TSA is coming to
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:54.200]  a highway near you and then it reports that they're setting up checkpoints from
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:59.800]  Dallas to Nashville from New York to San Francisco and now they pull you over
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:03.600]  without a warrant and they don't just search your car they try to grab on you
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:14.640]  I mean this is crazy yeah well it's the exercise of mind control in the good old
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:24.360]  you us of a I I have no answers I can only say where are the people what are
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:32.720]  the people saying about this where are their outspoken outspoken voices the
[01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:38.000]  challenges to bring it on the floor of that so-called Congress but what is
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:46.760]  going on we nod our heads and say oh oh oh I see I see and we accept we cannot
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:51.500]  accept we've got a protest they've got to go on the streets was going in the
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:57.560]  streets didn't do much for Iraq did it well that brings up the next point why
[01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:04.720]  don't we see more stars you know more people like yourself who have the courage
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:09.600]  that you have at I mean we don't really see that very often and then even when
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.400]  somebody who supported Obama like Matt Damon says man Obama's keeping the
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:17.840]  wars going the torture you didn't do what you say you do he gets attacked like
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:23.000]  he can't even have an opinion in America yeah yeah I didn't know that he had
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:31.680]  outspokenly questioned Obama on that but it's a it's a striking point the the
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:37.680]  reason that board don't is out of fear I mean that the example I point to his
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:41.480]  Meryl Streep who had never been outspoken on any subject that I know of
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:50.120]  third Oscar now winner when she chose to speak out against Alar coding on
[01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:57.040]  apples being unhealthy and she was so slapped down at the time Meryl Streep
[01:18:57.040 --> 01:19:03.000]  is never outspoken again and that's why most of them don't speak they don't
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.760]  want to hurt their box office look at the Dixie chicks I happen to know their
[01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:12.640]  listeners of my show here in Austin I've talked to some of them they come out
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:17.240]  and mildly criticize the war and say they don't like George Bush they're
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:21.560]  Americans they they have first amendment they stopped playing their music on the
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:25.800]  radio for a full year now they ended up being even more popular in the end but
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.840]  they still now have shut up and again since when do they blacklist people in
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:38.520]  this country Ed well that's been going on for a long time yeah a long time it
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:47.040]  takes on various shades various colors and in it works in mysterious ways but
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:55.080]  I use the Meryl Streep example as the most telling and it's a lot of
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:20:01.560]  trouble to shoot your mouth off because for the most part most people don't want
[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:06.320]  to hear it for two reasons one they don't want the myth of America being
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:12.600]  duplicitous accepted its fact they don't want to say they want to think that
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:20.240]  Santa Claus still exist they they believe in the the myth that America came
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:26.880]  into bloom without bloodshed forgetting about the Indians forgetting about the
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:34.880]  black slavery all of forgetting about all of the wars which so many of them
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:40.120]  were generated by false flag operations but which we have a very strong
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:48.200]  history of war in this country whether they believe it or not we we are a
[01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:55.440]  militaristic country and if we we're not fighting using our troops themselves
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.080]  we're certainly the greatest arms supplier in the world for everybody else
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:05.480]  who wants to start shooting well yeah the United States just the military of
[01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:09.200]  the US and in 2011 numbers just came out from the Congressional Budget Office
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:17.760]  is 53% of all armaments spending worldwide 53% just our military is 53% of
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:21.280]  all spending worldwide out of a hundred and seventy plus countries but get this
[01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:27.800]  it gets worse then of arms sales worldwide the United States is at least
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:33.080]  half of what's left so we're talking about 70 plus percent and of all
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:41.080]  armament spending and sales worldwide is the United States now ask your
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:50.200]  American citizen why why he won't have an answer that's to keep peace will be
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:59.440]  the answer keep peace you need guns to keep peace is the answer and God bless
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:11.280]  the what's his name the low man on the totem pole Ron Paul yeah who what an
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:16.760]  earth-shaking event if his ideas could to take root at least in some of the
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:23.240]  areas he proposed yeah well since when is it revolutionary to not want to be an
[01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:27.920]  empire and to follow the Constitution since when is that such a great evil and
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:31.760]  it's when we're naive as you've pointed out when we think America can do no
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:35.840]  wrong that's what allows us to become this corrupt system instead of our
[01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:41.000]  greater you know angels you know our better aspects we we sink into the mud
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.680]  when we just say no we're the good guys that's the end of it we it's like a
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.920]  schizophrenic thing where we say we have the moral authority and other people are
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:53.360]  bad when they torture but we're good when we torture me how did Bush I want to
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:57.960]  ask you this how did Bush send a bunch of people to prison who got caught
[01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:02.000]  torturing under orders in Afghanistan and Iraq including contractors and I'm
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.920]  not saying they don't deserve to go to jail when he gave the order on record
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:09.040]  and the White House memos are public and then he wrote a book last year
[01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.640]  bragging that he ordered torture him and do it again now wait a minute what
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:17.320]  should that say to the minions that they'll order you to torture when you
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:20.720]  get caught you'll go to jail and then Bush says he gave the order publicly and
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:25.520]  doesn't get in trouble I mean that's that's just that's la la landed I know
[01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:31.360]  it I know it and it's part of the mind control that we all exist under there
[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:39.880]  the the alternative sources of information are are enormous but how
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:46.640]  how many people read them how many people see them here and and and you're
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:53.480]  one of those few voices that challenges the authority of this country and and
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:59.480]  you you you should be a star blazing on Hollywood Boulevard oh well you're kind
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.840]  all I want to do is like I know you want is not have World War three and have my
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:06.960]  children have a future and I'm in this so deep there's no pulling out now but
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:09.880]  we're all in it together you know yeah you've talked a lot about history you're
[01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:14.880]  an informed guy we've seen this with Napoleon and Hitler and countless others
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:19.400]  they always think they're invincible and go wild and every historian every top
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:24.040]  general even the former head of the Mossad they're all saying but 80 plus
[01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:28.760]  percent of them are saying the US and Israel are crazy don't start these wars
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:35.120]  back off on Syria back off on Iran Russia and China the Chinese the Chinese
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:41.720]  president I went and looked it up had in 60 years of the Chinese over there with
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:45.440]  the communists they've never made statements like prepare for war with the
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.360]  US a month ago their president said in a speech prepare for war with the US
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:53.640]  they're moving troops in and around us which is admitted and if they attack
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:57.320]  Pakistan or anybody we're gonna have war with them the Russians are saying that
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:02.440]  and it's not even in our news Ed it's in the British European news but but it's
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:06.840]  like when the Chinese with thousands of high-tech nukes are saying prepare for
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.640]  war and US ships are massing off their coast and it's not even an issue Ed I
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:18.280]  mean what do you think's going on here I think we're being dazzled and knocked
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:27.080]  off balance and we'll continue to be so because you know it all comes down to
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:36.080]  economics doesn't it it does we we we get in liberal presidents who who pass
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:41.000]  anti-tariff laws who create fair trade laws those fair trade laws have now
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:49.720]  created much of the unemployment that now exists in our country and when when
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:56.920]  you know I never thought I'd be be saying this when does this country begin
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:07.880]  to worry about its internal poverty and we're slipping on every element okay
[01:26:07.880 --> 01:26:14.040]  the unemployment figures go down but it's still way too high for the richest
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:20.400]  country in the world to have that that high level of unemployment that's not
[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:27.200]  right and it's mostly due to the fact that the fair trade laws that were
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:34.000]  created are unemployed Americans well they're not fair I mean our country was
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.920]  built with tariffs and it's not they're not fair trade you know they claim they
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.840]  are but I've looked at the agreements they're all one-sided and it's not even
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:45.040]  helping the Chinese and the Mexicans and the Indians with the jobs it I mean
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.920]  they're they're having to compete to race to the bottom I guess Ross Perot was
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:55.760]  right about that look at the labels on your clothes on your shoes I'm on your
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:03.080]  on your watches anything you wear where does it come from not here no
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:10.760]  tradesmen is allowed to exist in this country anymore I I'm aghast and I I
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:17.200]  suppose if you think that there's a great power come by which is trying to
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:24.120]  create a balance in the world I guess our children will suffer until that
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:28.920]  balance is achieved throughout the world but while we're getting there it's
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:32.800]  certainly causing us suffering well you know sir that's their cover I've had
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:36.240]  globalist you know these big corporate fascists give me the speech if yeah we're
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:39.720]  setting this up it's to balance things but you read their internal documents
[01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:43.200]  that have been leaked they want everybody in poverty because we're easier to
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:50.240]  control they're not trying to lift anybody up yeah yeah well they're doing
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.360]  a good job so far yeah they are what about other Hollywood folks I mean you're
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.920]  you're one of the most well-connected people in Hollywood history former head
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:01.920]  of the Screen Actors Guild hundreds of films with every major star you can
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:08.700]  imagine I mean privately when you talk to people are do do they realize our
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:14.760]  peril just a sense of where Hollywood is well on 9-11 I'm regarded as the
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:22.720]  nutcase at the same time maybe I have special dispensation because I I became
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:28.440]  regarded as the nutcase long ago when I was talking about Central America and
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:36.840]  and our involvement there so maybe they allow me to dangle out there to serve as
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:44.880]  a typical nutcase and I'd gladly accept that as long as I can keep getting some
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:52.400]  work and and that's always the important thing to be able to pay the rent I
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:29:00.000]  would say most of them just don't want to get into that added trouble that added
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:06.600]  fatigue we're fighting a battle now in our Union they're they're pushing very
[01:29:06.600 --> 01:29:15.000]  hard to and they have an enormous majority behind them to merge the two
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:25.920]  actors unions on television and a small group of old die-hard Union members are
[01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:32.400]  trying to fight it with a suit to get an injunction to discount our election

[01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:04.920]  don't a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even
[01:32:04.920 --> 01:32:08.480]  if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led
[01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.000]  me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.960]  the United States and across the industrialized world are almost
[01:32:15.960 --> 01:32:21.120]  completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that
[01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:25.720]  our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:30.560]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:35.640]  all right Ed as nerf former head of the screen actors guild is our guest and
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.880]  we're talking about the economy and he was bringing up what we've seen some of
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:44.600]  the news how they're trying to change even the union system out in California
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:49.080]  out in Hollywood and again I think some unions get out of control they get
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:53.000]  politically controlled they take the dues they use it to get rid of naphtha and
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.400]  gat which is the opposite of what the unions should want but I do believe in
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:00.160]  a counterbalance you know we saw the Rockefellers and others and
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:05.400]  Pickerton security writing down people you know shooting you know folks that
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:11.160]  tried to unionize in the last 80 90 years so people fought for this and it's
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.600]  certainly done some good so it's a complex issue with the unions I believe
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:20.000]  people also have the right to quote work if it's separate from within a system but
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:23.400]  there needs to be some balance and we're definitely out of balance and the big
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.960]  neural-order globalist they don't want it so we couldn't have a better expert on
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:30.680]  about what's happening right now with the unions out there please continue Ed
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:37.400]  where we left off out we went to break well you know I always question myself
[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:45.000]  because I don't know enough Alex and I constantly found myself on my head trying
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:54.720]  to say I'm not qualified to sufficiently to carry this banner alone I asked too
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:59.400]  many questions and I and I don't do enough research to give the answers I do
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:10.480]  what I can here in here in in film we're faced with a huge consortium of power
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:19.600]  which will create a merger with the after the American Federation television
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:26.920]  radio artists and the screen actors guilt of which I am a former president we
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:32.720]  have worked for seventy-some years in creating this strong union and in the
[01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:39.960]  past few years after they used to negotiate with us conjointly for actors
[01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:47.760]  contract in film has chosen to depart on its own and undercut us they've done
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:57.360]  this with the the power of the AFL CIO who would be happy to see a larger
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:03.360]  merged union even though it's a weaker union because they like numbers they
[01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:09.240]  like the dues coming in from that increased number of actors but here we
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:17.560]  have after who has negotiated weaker contracts with producers producers are
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:26.800]  gladly accepting most shows now are on after formerly they were all sad the the
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:34.240]  forays which normally governs the policy between the two unions has not done
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:41.520]  anything in terms of after taking over our jurisdiction and the powers in sag
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:50.560]  of late have not pursued their rightful course in demanding their protection of
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:58.880]  their authority so that producers have signed with after which gives on the
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:08.280]  surface more or less the same wages or first-time production but their
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:14.600]  contracts are weaker in terms of residuals their contracts are weaker in
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:20.880]  terms of our pension and health and what this band of brothers with me has done
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:29.400]  is to try to show to the membership who are snowed by all of this authority
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:38.480]  that's coming down from all other areas producers agents the the power of New
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:44.240]  York who has never been happy with the power of Hollywood actors who can
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:54.280]  control 53% of the actors in the business they they have snowed the most of
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:59.360]  the membership out there so that they're not aware that if this merger takes
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:06.040]  place without a feasibility study of what will happen to their pensions and to
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:11.840]  their health and welfare plans that they will suffer their dues will increase
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:19.920]  they'll be in bed with broadcasters who work non-union and it did they've
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:25.760]  created yet another witches brew which is symptomatic of our country and which
[01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:30.720]  is symptomatic of the weakening of unions in this country and if you don't
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:35.840]  believe in unionism then there's no sense in listening to me because unions are
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:41.240]  what stands for the working man and the working man generally has been
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:48.920]  destroyed in this country by those fair trade acts by the resistance of
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:54.840]  isolationist senators and congressmen who create laws which create right to
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:39:03.080]  work states which create strong enforcement on Taft Hartley so that
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:09.200]  people are boggled by the pressures working against them and we end up the
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:15.640]  average working actor ends up on the short end of the stick well again every
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.520]  system becomes corrupt and has problems but obviously unions were needed when
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.760]  they first came in when people were falling into sausage falling into
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:26.920]  sausage machines and you know the the Rockefellers and robber barons were
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:31.920]  selling chalk fake powdered milk so those excesses created the unions people
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:35.800]  had to fight and die to create the unions I think the problem of the unions
[01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:39.760]  now is that you alluded to they become so political that a lot of them push for
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:44.160]  NAFTA and get and all this so it's like they don't even exist anyways and so
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:48.800]  then a lot of people see the unions basically is just siding with big
[01:39:48.800 --> 01:39:52.560]  corrupt government that's siding with big corrupt corporations it's like no
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:56.680]  matter what you do these insider manipulators come of the crony capitalist
[01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:01.160]  model they get in and corrupt anything and I don't know how you deal with it I
[01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:04.920]  think you get the public aware you get him involved and you get him angry and
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:09.000]  that transparency is the answer and people being involved and you know we've
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:12.440]  talked about getting people involved realize you you're uninvolved at your
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:18.520]  own peril I want to give the I could I'd only barge in and say that when I was a
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:23.440]  young man and hoping to be an actor I took a job at the bill it goes we own
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:30.200]  Pontiac plant in Kansas City that was really my first exposure big time to the
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:36.800]  real world that was an open shop plan and we were working overtime forced to
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:44.960]  work overtime and you were punished if you didn't and and I it was a slave
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.200]  ship is what it turned out to be so when I finally quit there and went back to
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:54.800]  Chicago and tried to be a more of an actor and I still had to get jobs and I
[01:40:54.800 --> 01:41:00.200]  said I'd never work in an auto plant again and finally seeing my friends
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:05.800]  working for $1.90 an hour which was impossible I went and got a job at the
[01:41:05.800 --> 01:41:11.440]  Ford plant there and that Ford plant played $1.90 an hour and that was big
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:17.920]  time so I said okay and I work as a middle finisher there and I worked there
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:23.160]  for about nine months and I want to say that the difference between that close
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:29.280]  shop plant that union shop as opposed to the open shop that I worked in was the
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:33.960]  difference between night and day and that's where I became a union man because
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:38.760]  I was treated like a human being and I was treated like a respectable worker
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:44.760]  which I was never treated at the Buick plant so I became a union man and I've
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:50.600]  been so ever since the difference between working union and doing an honest
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:56.600]  day's work and working non-union and I would point out the fact to you that
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:04.240]  every time a non-union man works the wages he's getting are there because a
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:11.000]  union shop established a level that he can work under if there was no union
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:17.480]  he'd be working at slave wages himself without that creation of a higher weight
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:22.520]  scale let me make this point look at China which they call communist it's not
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:27.920]  communist it's a it's a top-down elitist insider group and they've got
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.600]  people committing suicide and mass at these iPod and iPhone plants and the
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:37.240]  rest of it they're made to work in some cases 18 hours a day seven days a week
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:42.680]  when they've got big orders in the there's blood all over the textiles now
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:48.560]  from little kids fingers they had to put suicide nets all around it so that Apple
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:53.480]  and others that say they're liberal can make bigger profits and they will kill
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:58.880]  you in China if you try to unionize and that's just people getting together
[01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:03.640]  saying we need to live and folks you can pull this up in China the main day
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:09.880]  cares are people chain their children to the light poles or to greats and then
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:14.320]  they work all day and try to get out by dark to bring their child food and then
[01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:18.880]  go back and live in their hovel and globalism isn't even lifting up the
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:23.400]  average Chinese you know for the elites it is in a small middle class that
[01:43:23.400 --> 01:43:27.760]  manages them but it's just creating I mean that's where we're going when you
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.400]  don't demand standards and you don't demand that people be paid enough to
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:35.560]  live decently you just destroy the society and you look at Mexico where
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:39.400]  they used to Jenna 21 to force people off their rural land the last 20 years of
[01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:44.560]  the Mexico City as a staging ground up to the maquiladoras and the borders it
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:47.880]  didn't build them up it forced them off their land where they could sustain
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:52.480]  themselves and live happily and they forced them up to Mexico City that's
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:56.720]  gone from 10 million to 30 plus million and half the population lives in cardboard
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:01.880]  boxes I mean it is it is it is I don't know what we do because I want America to
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:07.720]  know it is the giant sucking sound we are going to become that now my problem
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:11.040]  that is how do you stop the unions from getting bought off by the big
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:15.040]  corporations and politicians I mean you do agree that I mean the big unions have
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:21.160]  totally sold their people out a lot of them have I will I will grant you but I
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:26.320]  would say that you you will always there was a wonderful publication I used to
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:31.240]  subscribe to I don't get it anymore I know what happened to it Herman Benson
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:35.680]  was the creator of it called Union democracy in action and they would cover
[01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:42.400]  all of the stories of rebel unions of unions trying to achieve the voices of
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:50.800]  their masses and fighting against corrupt leadership now hopefully Union
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:57.160]  democracy still exists there are big unions that certainly I think are
[01:44:57.160 --> 01:45:05.720]  democratic I know some of those leaders and have met them I worked with Bill
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:10.320]  Wimpersinger of the machinists when he was president and that was one of the
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:19.120]  greatest fighting Democrats you ever saw they do exist out there and you I can't
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:25.720]  blow the whistle and who isn't and who is but I I was the teamsters for years
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:31.440]  became became recognized as the gangster union but I think they've done a lot
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:36.760]  since then sure to achieve a cleaner image than they said sure sure anything's
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.720]  gonna have problems my point is is that once you have globalism and we have no
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:45.040]  tariffs and these other countries have hidden ones built in it doesn't matter
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:50.040]  the unions all of us just gonna go down the drain because it's an unfair playing
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:54.400]  field once you're competing with China India Mexico where people chain their
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:59.560]  kids up and go work 18 hours a day literally till their fingers bleed once
[01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:05.520]  you're competing against that I mean it's competing against slavery and so
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:09.200]  the until we put tariffs up and of course they're gonna do it once we
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:12.560]  collapse and they'll blame the terrorists for the collapse there's
[01:46:12.560 --> 01:46:18.720]  nothing you see where I'm going with that Ed I do I the problems for me exist
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:27.320]  that we lived we live or have lived in a in a very comfy society a comfy
[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:32.600]  society that put its tradesmen to work that put it steel workers auto workers
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:39.320]  to work and and we're then able to sell to the world and and our workers could
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:44.880]  live a nice middle-class living we were living beyond the standards of the rest
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:51.480]  of the world yes now if you start talking about granting the rest of the
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:57.880]  world the ability to earn a decent wage you'll start taking away those jobs
[01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:03.040]  from here so that we can provide the rest of the world but we can start
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:08.720]  importing well we're now importing all over the places I said earlier look at
[01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:16.640]  your clothing labels all over the world we're getting this material in but what
[01:47:16.640 --> 01:47:22.200]  are you doing for the Americans here where are the jobs that you can put them
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:27.800]  where's the education which sucks in terms of comparison to the rest of the
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:33.640]  world where's the education that it can uplift your worker to qualify for those
[01:47:33.640 --> 01:47:38.640]  better jobs that he's not going to be a tradesman if he's not going to be sure
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:41.720]  in the fact well we know what you're gonna be there gonna be bureaucrats
[01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:44.280]  they're gonna be police they're gonna be prison guards they're shifting the
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:50.480]  economy from even a service to now a surveillance police state with 30,000
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:56.360]  drones that's the new economy the new economy is kind of a nightmare empire
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.760]  where you've got to serve the empire and join the military and or work in
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:04.280]  defense or work in prisons because that's all there's gonna be Ed that's the
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:08.560]  plan that's what the Rand Corporation said they were gonna do yeah well as
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.000]  I think we're there you go to the airport you'll see a lot of formerly
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:20.400]  employed workers check groping you and checking out your your your your your
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:28.680]  luggage that the point is we've got a cryo halt to it we've got to create jobs
[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:32.200]  in this country well by the way you're right this is pure social engineering
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:35.320]  towards the police state I've talked to the TSA there's three different types of
[01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:39.320]  people there's either people that had other jobs they lost and they need the
[01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:42.120]  money and they don't like it and they apologize to me and say look I know this
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:45.480]  then you've got those that are kind of oblivious and just don't care then you
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:49.440]  got the folks that enjoy abusing people and they're always the boss the little
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:53.400]  guys are all the little ladies are always nice and when you say no to it then
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:49:00.280]  they call over the thug the the we've become a nation of waiters of cab
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:10.720]  drivers of telephone repairman of TV repairman of salesman if you can get a
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:19.200]  job selling someplace we become a nation of law enforcement of nurses of and
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:23.760]  and and then you go to any hospital and the vast majority of nurses are from the
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:31.880]  Philippines so where are where are we providing jobs you know we look and act
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:38.280]  just like Rome before it collapsed Ed yeah I said where are the circuses I
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:46.120]  want some circuits but God's sake I guess that's you call me I'm a circus
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:49.200]  performer no you're not you know I forgot to even get the number out we're
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.880]  gonna come back and take one or two quick questions for Ed Asner while he's
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:58.400]  here the toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 I forgot to give the
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:02.600]  number out but specific quick question for Ed Asner kind of a grab bag wild
[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:08.240]  card straight ahead 800-259-9231 Ed you know whether people love you or hate you

[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:15.120]  courage you never even really talk about this but your show was doing very well
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:19.160]  on TV correct me if I'm wrong didn't they cancel it basically because of your
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:25.960]  political statements I think so I think they will deny it they will fight the
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:32.240]  that they were worried about the future and therefore cancel it but it was a
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:43.360]  viable very very full of present-day conflict and ideas and they can't yeah
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:46.600]  they don't want serious issues one way or the other they want to dumb it all
[01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:51.160]  down and that's what they've done and it's social engineering playing in
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:55.200]  simple Ed Asner former head of the screen actors Guild hundreds of films TV
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:00.040]  shows you name it and he knew Ted Knight that's a biggie right there they're

[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:52.720]  go see him what in Texarkana in April let's go to Wayne in Tennessee and then
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:58.840]  Darryl Lane what's your question for Ed Asner it's really not a question it's a
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:04.480]  comment it's a little short sided to discount the American spirit and the
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:09.160]  human spirit I believe a properly functioning free enterprise system will
[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:14.840]  create enough industry to revive our economy if we just get the DC criminals
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:19.360]  in New York criminals off our back and I want to call to action one million
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:26.120]  patriots educate 300 people in the next 12 months if people did that it would
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:31.720]  work but again we're getting into debates here about systems we can't we
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:35.200]  don't have a free market system because it's all rigged and they have tariffs
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:41.080]  that's what I keep explaining is that it's rigged and by the insiders Ed
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:46.160]  what would happen if people all tried to wake up somebody every day I mean
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:49.520]  clearly folks didn't used to know what false flag was you pointed out more
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:55.520]  people do today what do you think of that solution it's great but then how
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:59.440]  many are going to quit once they they find the other guy coming up with a
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:03.320]  salient point I'll give you a very good example I argued with a friend today
[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:11.080]  about 9-11 and and and he cited the popular mechanics rebuttal on the idea
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:16.880]  of conspiracy on 9-11 I didn't read the 9-11
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:22.320]  popular mechanic pure bold what it did well what they do is they build strong
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:26.440]  in they take things that aren't true about 9-11 that no one ever said and
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:31.440]  then they debunk that and they lie they say norad never intercepted one plane
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:36.720]  in 50 years except paying Stuart and then I had the very same person norad
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:42.120]  spokesman they they quote in a Reuters article saying 167 intercepts that year
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:50.440]  I mean it's just total deception well he posed the question well if 9-11 as the
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:57.240]  towers were brought down why weren't there explosive material besides the
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:02.960]  thermite and the sulfur why weren't there evidence of explosives being used but
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:06.440]  there was you see the blast squid points you you can you can see them saying
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:10.640]  we're gonna bring down seven and then they blow it up I mean the seven I I
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:14.360]  totally agree because you got Larry Silverstein saying we've got a full
[01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:19.840]  the building I talked to the head of emergency management another person
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:22.720]  who died two weeks after we had them on and he said they were there and they
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:26.400]  said there were bombs in the building with deputy head thank you Wayne let's
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:30.960]  go to Darrell in Pennsylvania you're on the air with that as their quick
[01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:36.480]  question I yeah back I want to go back to talking about the unions I was a I'm
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:42.640]  a former electrical union member IDW basically what I was seeing with the
[01:57:42.640 --> 01:57:47.680]  unions was a microcosm of what our government is like it became so corrupt
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:52.760]  and they you know the way they forced you who you had the forced upon you who
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:58:00.880]  you had to vote for what's your comments on that all right I'm I'm will be the
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:07.280]  last person to deny that there has been union corruption IDW I'm sure headed
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:13.240]  share it's an evil that you have to be on the watch born and try to fight
[01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:16.920]  against I think it happens because Americans have gotten so sheep like no
[01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:21.000]  matter what it is or what system it's gonna become corrupt until we start
[01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:25.560]  getting involved getting informed and demanding our rights and liberties thank
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:30.400]  you so much for that point as Alex pointed out would you rather not have
[01:58:30.400 --> 01:58:36.720]  unions what are you going to have without unions because they at least are
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:41.600]  the last gap between heads stay there got a break well hold on one second you
[01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:52.280]  are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today this is Alex Jones with five
[01:58:52.280 --> 01:58:56.520]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:00.320]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:04.400]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:08.640]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:12.920]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:16.920]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:21.040]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:25.000]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:29.160]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:32.960]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar

[01:59:53.440 --> 02:00:01.320]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:12.680]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:20.200]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:26.040]  Alex Jones all right I'm gonna get into all the news I haven't covered yet and
[02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:28.800]  a huge blitz after the break and then we're gonna open the phones up we have a
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:36.320]  guest popping in as well Ed Asner is with us and again all I'm saying is the
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:40.360]  globalist the Rockefellers fought unions then they figured out how to have
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:43.840]  NAFTA and GATT so that they wouldn't even really matter then they figured out
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:47.160]  how to take them over and I there's a lot of bad stuff comes out of the unions
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:50.280]  I don't like them giving money to you know try to restrict my private
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:55.080]  property second amendment all of that I get that I can see Ed Asner's point the
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:59.160]  communist China kills you if you try to unionize you know you've got to
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:04.120]  understand there's a check and a balance there and anything that gets too big
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:07.680]  it's out of control and I know the globalists want to shut down the unions
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:12.880]  Obama's been trying to bust up unions and doing it with left cover and Ed
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:15.720]  Asner was just making that point we didn't really mean to start a whole
[02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:21.800]  union discussion somebody ought to do a whole whole show looking at it and you
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:25.720]  expand a discussion about it but you got cut off by the break edge we held you
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:29.760]  over to finish your point well you know my point to your last caller is that
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:35.440]  yeah I'm sure that that he found corruption with the IBEW and it may
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:39.760]  have been just that particular branch or local that he was identified with I
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:47.160]  won't say that you know that the National Union is corrupt as well so
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:51.640]  that so that I can only say to the members what are you going to do without a
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:56.560]  union if you don't have a union you're going to be getting at certainly less
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:01.160]  than whatever you're making with the union and it as far as corruption within
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:06.320]  union you've got to keep fighting and sacrificing yourself to make it more
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:11.760]  democratic it's a how do you deal with it if a Mexican truck driver will drive
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:16.480]  for $7 an hour which nobody can live on here and American truck drivers that
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:19.720]  were getting 30 bucks an hour and could live pretty good are now getting cut
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:25.680]  down to you know 12 $15 an hour and all the fines and fees I mean how does the
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:29.800]  union idea because I get you know truck drivers being paid more for example or
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:33.320]  because they need to be able to live and then buy things that's what makes an
[02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:37.200]  economy you know rising tide does raise all ships how do you deal with then
[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:41.240]  Mexican truck drivers out of Mexico well you supposed to deal with it
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:47.840]  nationally there should be I mean once again it's another example of fair
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:53.600]  trade they're allowing these things to come in and you're denying your
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:59.680]  American workers this way and I and I think that it's a failing nationally by
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:03.800]  the president by the Congress to allow this to happen I don't see any reason
[02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.600]  why it should happen unless you want to take care of your Mexican neighbor and I
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:12.560]  feel that that's going on anyway because the illegals who are here they're
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:20.080]  taking jobs that that citizens don't want or won't take so and they're sitting
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:27.600]  in the money to Mexico oh absolutely and all I know is this country that was so
[02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:32.320]  wealthy is falling apart and there's so many working poor in this country and
[02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:37.920]  it's it's it's just getting worse by the minute and again Ed Asner as FDR you're
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:41.040]  doing a theater all over the country very interesting I'm gonna try to come and
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:45.520]  see that's that you invited me off air there in Texarkana in April
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:49.520]  complimentary ticket oh well that's nice of you well I may have to come out there
[02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:52.960]  because I got some family near there it's always so I never come and see him so
[02:03:52.960 --> 02:03:58.080]  maybe I need to take a trip over there well well I know my father-in-law is a
[02:03:58.080 --> 02:04:02.120]  big Ed Asner fan as well and so maybe I'll bring him along well Ed thank you
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:05.040]  so much for coming on with us we appreciate your courage on 9-11 truth
[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:09.200]  and speaking out against this World War 3 they're trying to start thank you so
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:15.120]  much sir we gotta watch out all right folks there goes there goes Ed Asner
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:20.880]  we're gonna go to break and we're going to come back and get into incredible
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:26.960]  news and again I know the elites don't want unions but then I don't like what I
[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:30.800]  see the unions doing politically I know everything Bill Gates is doing is trying
[02:04:30.800 --> 02:04:35.200]  to shut down unions but then my experiences with unions that have not
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:42.120]  been too nice just trying to do things in the media you know you go rent a
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:45.560]  theater and you find out a union runs it and I don't even want you to be able to
[02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:49.640]  videotape your speech well nobody told me that you know so so the rules can get
[02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:54.320]  really bureaucratic I mean again it checks and balances and we don't have
[02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.800]  those we're just at the mercy of the globalist people that are worried about
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:03.520]  unions what about China that's Robin on your wage hi folks this is Alex Jones

[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:13.320]  because there's a war on for your mind. Alright during the break I saw some
[02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:17.520]  footage that really upset me I don't know I don't know we'll have it ready for
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:20.880]  the nightly news tonight or it'll be Friday because they've got to you know

[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:30.120]  they're taking taxpayer money and buying drones here in Texas robots that are like
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:36.240]  a million plus dollars a piece for bombs they're buying these giant 690 something
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:42.240]  thousand dollar speed boats for lakes and rivers that have giant machine guns
[02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:47.520]  mounted all over them and they didn't have the machine guns mounted three
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:50.480]  months ago when we first went out and talked to in a lake they didn't know

[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:57.240]  there are multiple states moving to block of the state level the secret
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:04.360]  arrest of citizens and the disappearance of citizens you call other states you
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:06.840]  understand the government saying it'll secretly arrest citizens and
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:11.200]  disappear us and the states are telling state police and others you do not be
[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:18.400]  part of kidnappings that's illegal you will report you will stop that I mean
[02:14:18.400 --> 02:14:21.720]  can an FBI agent because they're an FBI agent pull over they see a toddler
[02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:25.200]  walking down the street and shoot them for fun no but wait a minute I thought
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:29.040]  government can do whatever it wants is this North Korea is this King George is
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:33.440]  this the New World Order and look I've I've had state police pull me over who
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:36.720]  are nice I've been in a car wrecked and state police came were both listeners
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:41.280]  I'm not saying you're all bad but the little political types that they had out
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:45.600]  at that speedboat thing and Darren McBrain did a fair report last time
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:49.640]  because they talked to us we did a nice report well why is it you know almost
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:53.920]  $700,000 why do we need this when you could buy six or seven of the boats oh
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:58.280]  that hit a little close to the bone we're now getting statistics about light
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:01.760]  rail killing people everywhere because trains can't yield you're supposed to
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:05.240]  yield by law even if you have the right of way if it's gonna cause an accident
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:08.080]  why are trains exempt why are they putting them down on the ground with
[02:15:08.080 --> 02:15:11.840]  cars we're trying to get an interview with that they won't talk to us because
[02:15:11.840 --> 02:15:17.600]  we'll ask real questions and I mean I was watching this footage of Darren who
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:22.560]  you know as a reporter is just as polite as he gets by the way Darren both his
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:26.240]  parents are were cops are retired of course but just a really nice guy
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:32.400]  Darren goes up totally polite and they're like no we're not talking to you uh-uh
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:37.600]  and all sudden the cops all bow up I mean you people are shameful you're
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:41.800]  shameful and it was shameful when I drove by that weird checkpoint whatever they
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:45.080]  were doing and I walked up today I was ago this morning the cops are like oh
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:50.520]  it's a citizen walking up talking to me go back get back and I'm like 60 yards
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:54.440]  away I'm like huh what do you mean I was doing a psychological test and he was

[02:15:58.680 --> 02:16:02.400]  don't have to yell at me he said I told you and he was putting his hand on his
[02:16:02.400 --> 02:16:09.000]  gun I'm like oh you want to destroy America you you I'm a slave I said all
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:12.480]  this I'm not supposed to talk to you and I said you make me want to throw up I
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:18.240]  said enjoy your evil but you talk about being a cursed weak man you talk about
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:22.160]  being a slug when I watch those North Korean soldiers and police with the
[02:16:22.160 --> 02:16:26.040]  people in formation walking in at Kim Jong-il's thing and crying for days and
[02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:28.800]  if you didn't cry hard enough they put you know labor camp that that's
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:33.400]  associated guys search the term if you didn't cry hard enough or didn't cry
[02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:38.200]  enough at Kim Jong-il's funeral you went to labor camp I think it's like BBC
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:46.440]  the point is that when I see the crazed eyes of a Soviet soldier from old
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:51.720]  black and white films I just you can see it the evil when I see North
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:56.600]  Korean for film of the modern ones I'm just like they are palpably evil they
[02:16:56.600 --> 02:17:00.520]  have a palpable weird petty power trip almost like a five-year-old who's
[02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:03.840]  spoiled and bad and a bully beating up a two-year-old you ever seen something
[02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:08.360]  like that they have this craze look they get off on the fear they feed on this
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:12.840]  the weakness oh man I'm seeing cops more and more that look in their eye I'm
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:16.560]  either seeing cops that are awake and I am seeing more cops change in tires

[02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:27.820]  grabbing her genitals I guess and I guess it is a new DPS they've learned to
[02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:31.120]  keep their mouth shut about the abuse at the Texas Youth Commission make sure
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:36.320]  all the locals get to have their fun with those kids to be clear they followed
[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:39.640]  the guys out of the parking lot for miles with the state police right on
[02:24:39.640 --> 02:24:45.520]  their bumper and then you turned right in the street and drove off and then
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:50.120]  whenever we go out and do interviews you know the the the the media is always
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:57.120]  like the media people with the police are always like well your media where
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:25:00.160]  are you on info wars I've heard of that but what that's not real media we're

[02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:16.640]  break I get a call from the 590 guy saying the state police have called
[02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:24.640]  them and saying what's why are the state police calling us and then of course
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:28.840]  they try to twist it like we're saying we're 590 a.m. when we're not when I air
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:32.880]  these reports here people say well what media oh it's info wars.com it was a

[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:17.280]  and my reporters go out to cover this big armored machine gun boat and to ask
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:23.360]  them about that in drones and they freak out and won't talk to them and then on
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:26.520]  top of it follow them out of the parking lot for a couple miles right on their
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:42.160]  hind end actually did something wrong and then I start getting messages it goes

[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:17.760]  why I'm mad about this video the cops are bowing up because my reporters are
[02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:21.800]  there to ask about their $700,000 or whatever boats they're buying a whole
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:25.320]  bunch of them with our tax money the state police are all over the place

[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:03.960]  industries they sell out too later and they think they own us and they own the
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:07.800]  First Amendment and they can't stand the fact that we reach tens of millions of
[02:28:07.800 --> 02:28:13.800]  people and they can't stand the fact that I did a report three or four months
[02:28:13.800 --> 02:28:18.200]  ago that I even thought was milk toast where we go out and show the boat and
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:21.560]  have them talk about it and then I say I think we're spending too much money on
[02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:26.920]  this plus drug interdiction clitting on lakes inside the state the state wouldn't
[02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:30.080]  even do anything when when when Mexican drug dealers on Texas lakes that border

[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:51.560]  it you lose you don't think I haven't been attacked you don't think I haven't
[02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:58.080]  gone you think calling up to complain on our reporters thinking KLBJ's our boss
[02:35:58.080 --> 02:36:00.880]  because you're asking well where's info wars well we're on this station that
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:05.560]  station in our standard thing you think you're getting me in trouble you think

[02:36:15.200 --> 02:36:19.560]  it is the ultimate danger to our society to have guys in uniforms trying to
[02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:23.640]  intimidate reporters I mean in Mexico they kill reporters they kill a lot of
[02:36:23.640 --> 02:36:31.680]  reporters here man I tell you I listen I'm having to have phone calls here over

[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:08.880]  spokespeople spokespersons were already on video being interviewed by some of
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:13.160]  the local media not real sure who they were but these guys were on camera you
[02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:17.360]  know and and you know somebody in a uniform obviously willing to talk to
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:22.640]  the press well I recognized Tom from last time I said well you I knew he was

[02:39:25.280 --> 02:39:30.240]  absolutely you're evil so go and talk to him and I immediately got this vibe
[02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:35.560]  that I did not receive the last time this time he wasn't happy to see me so
[02:39:35.560 --> 02:39:38.160]  we're so they're now interfering with the press they need to move to North
[02:39:38.160 --> 02:39:42.320]  Korea condenium yeah so I said hey you know we're here to do an interview again
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:45.720]  he says we're not doing any media interviews today I explain well it looks
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:49.240]  like you are right now and he says we you have to you're an American you're to
[02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:51.880]  be lied to you're the enemy well he's part of the occupational bankers
[02:39:51.880 --> 02:39:54.760]  continue so we got to schedule these ahead of time bring him a chair guys

[02:39:59.720 --> 02:40:04.320]  called in advance you guys knew we were coming here oh that's the problem then
[02:40:04.320 --> 02:40:09.240]  he said how would you be okay thank you guys misrepresented ourselves because we
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:12.840]  said we're with KLBJ but that's not the total truth we said we were with Alex
[02:40:12.840 --> 02:40:16.240]  Jones show in fours KLBJ you know sometimes you're on them you're all
[02:40:16.240 --> 02:40:19.440]  over the place so that's because they always ask when you call info wars and
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:23.640]  we always say yeah it's on KLBJ here locally absolutely and people in locally
[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:26.720]  intent I've won best of Austin repeatedly and then reader polls the
[02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:30.400]  newspaper we went they always act like we're not media yeah yeah oh so you're
[02:40:30.400 --> 02:40:34.680]  misrepresenting you're bad it's always that moral thing of we're bad yeah I
[02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:41.040]  hear you so shall continue well I had the wireless mic with me and bound had the
[02:40:41.040 --> 02:40:45.320]  camera rolling so I went ahead and asked him questions anyway so he didn't like
[02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:49.120]  the fact that you didn't talk to the hand now I don't I don't believe so you
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:53.160]  know and the thing is is like I said we didn't get a very warm welcome like we
[02:40:53.160 --> 02:40:57.960]  like we received last time this time it just seemed like the cold shoulder you
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:01.120]  know and and we had this was a different spokesman but you said oh I know who
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:04.600]  Alex Jones is he you know he's that's what he said he goes oh I know who Alex
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:09.760]  Jones is was his exact where we got we got that on camera and then now they're
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:13.920]  calling up complaining saying we're met we're like like like they call up an
[02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:19.120]  affiliate we're on where we air the news reports and they're calling up because
[02:41:19.120 --> 02:41:24.040]  they always be they always ask okay you know what is it for us well where is it
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:26.840]  on well it's on I know the standard thing I tell you to tell them it's on
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:30.880]  channel 10 TV look like we are these reports there as well yeah and it's on
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:35.200]  590 a.m. how dare you ask well what did you tell them last time I've seen the
[02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:38.720]  video report you what we did the same thing and they you know but I think you
[02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:42.360]  know they must have saw the report last time and maybe felt that it wasn't very
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:45.240]  favorable or whatever so I think that's what happened they saw the YouTube
[02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:50.400]  report from last time and then and then didn't welcome us back let me explain
[02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:53.120]  something I know they've told you behind the scenes you're taking over martial
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:58.120]  law you rule haha you're about to get a lot of power boys but nobody likes the
[02:41:58.120 --> 02:42:01.680]  press getting messed with this is gonna become a big issue what is the punk's
[02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:11.360]  name forgot Tom Venger Venger yeah yeah so you know I'm gonna work now to get
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:14.920]  their funding cut and I'm gonna work now because they got way too much money
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:18.360]  they the government helps bring the drugs in stay police find truck loads of
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:22.260]  cocaine or order to give it to the FBI that's been in the Associated Press we
[02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:25.440]  all know you help the feds with fast and furious all the rest of it and help
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:29.280]  deliver the little kids over the DPS of the you know youth centers for the fund
[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:35.800]  and it's over okay so every week now I want a DPS report sure okay I want you
[02:42:35.800 --> 02:42:39.040]  at every one of their events and do whatever you're gonna do criminals I
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:43.680]  don't care they're spending six hundred thousand dollars on these six hundred
[02:42:43.680 --> 02:42:49.520]  plus yeah for and for a total of six of them and this is the unveiling of the
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:53.580]  second one with machine guns militarizing and they don't like it well
[02:42:53.580 --> 02:42:58.520]  I'll definitely the next legislature be there talking about this sure and again
[02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:02.360]  it is criminal what the state of Texas has done the so-called state going along
[02:43:02.360 --> 02:43:06.560]  with fast and furious all the rest of this and it's wrong to sit there and
[02:43:06.560 --> 02:43:10.760]  try to violate press freedom in this country can you believe calling up our
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:14.360]  affiliate trying to imply we're doing something wrong playing weird legalese
[02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:19.520]  games and that was quick we just got back I mean they called you right away
[02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:22.920]  well I was already yelling on air before I knew about this because I'd
[02:43:22.920 --> 02:43:26.160]  already seen the footage of them bowing up to you and stuff yeah that's a man
[02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:29.720]  tell us about the following you out they escorted you out what they told you
[02:43:29.720 --> 02:43:33.120]  leave we didn't really realize you know there's a lot of police cars there a lot
[02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:36.720]  of state troopers and then it wasn't tell you know we will we turn the very
[02:43:36.720 --> 02:43:39.960]  first corner out of the parking lot and we're like is this guy following us and
[02:43:39.960 --> 02:43:44.720]  sure enough you know almost all the way to the freeway so and then I was getting
[02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:47.240]  the camp I thought we're gonna get pulled over so I was getting the cameras
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:51.440]  ready and then he decided to once we got close to the on ramp he turned around
[02:43:51.440 --> 02:43:57.680]  and bowed face and took off well he's got the NDAA he'd love to throw you in a
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:00.240]  underground present and don't worry they'll get your pension funds though
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:03.920]  they're gonna hurt you too the evil you commit is gonna come back on you ten
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:08.240]  times by your masters not by us and by them following us it seemed like
[02:44:08.240 --> 02:44:11.480]  intimidation you know it was pure intimidation well I mean he's calling
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:15.200]  yeah what about the guys get in your space I saw that on the video yeah he
[02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:20.240]  just you know he was right there real close by just as as I asked them
[02:44:20.240 --> 02:44:23.240]  questions and it was another intimidation for well that's what I like
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:26.200]  about our day survey is that he doesn't act like a crazy person even though I
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:28.520]  don't agree with some of what he does yeah I mean I used to go out and try to
[02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:32.920]  talk to this the police at public events and press conferences and they'd have
[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:37.080]  guys come start bumping into me and I'm like I know you think you can assault me
[02:44:37.080 --> 02:44:40.200]  because you're God but do you want to turn America into North Korea that's
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:45.560]  always been my line I mean the other police chiefs were just like crazy and
[02:44:45.560 --> 02:44:48.560]  then they would like like that they were doing this let's say I had a lot of me
[02:44:48.560 --> 02:44:50.920]  already so Vita would never act like that they're just out of their minds
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:54.680]  there's our evil report showing their boat all right I'm gonna go to our next
[02:44:54.680 --> 02:44:57.560]  guest Aaron I'm gonna try to not get hot about this it's funny that I saw the
[02:44:57.560 --> 02:45:03.480]  video and got mad and then boom they're calling trying to get us in trouble like
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:08.920]  you can get us in trouble I mean listen police I've been physically attacked I've

[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:41.360]  Griffin was able to pop in with us I apologize he's been holding while I went
[02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:46.920]  to that ranting a red dirt report calm is a great newspaper publication up at
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:51.920]  Oklahoma and they've investigated Oklahoma City and more Andrew Griffin got
[02:45:51.920 --> 02:45:57.760]  to know Andrew Breitbart who died in the early morning hours out in Los Angeles
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:01.360]  while walking and they said right away though it's not suspicious even though
[02:46:01.360 --> 02:46:05.480]  he released a video did a video saying I'm gonna release stuff it'll destroy
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:09.520]  Obama about his college film of him in college incredible stuff with
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:13.960]  communists and stuff you know we're gonna take Obama down and he drops dead
[02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:20.080]  and very very suspicious and Andrew Griffin joins us to break that down
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:27.240]  Andrew thanks for coming on tell us what you know about mr. Breitbart and
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:33.400]  what you think well well immediately when I got the news I was another town
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:38.080]  covering Randall Terry the anti-abortion activist who's running for president
[02:46:38.080 --> 02:46:43.240]  actually on the Democratic ticket I was in his RV interviewing him and got a
[02:46:43.240 --> 02:46:48.240]  message about this and immediately I thought to these videos that he was
[02:46:48.240 --> 02:46:51.640]  talking about at the conservative political action conference in DC a
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:57.280]  couple weeks ago where he said you know I have videos that's gonna really show
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:02.120]  who Obama really is and his connections to the elements of the new left from the
[02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:07.960]  60s and 70s the Bernadine Dorn and Bill Ayers and it's gonna show his college
[02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:14.240]  years and his time in Chicago and I thought wow that's a huge story and for
[02:47:14.240 --> 02:47:18.000]  the past two weeks there hasn't been much said about it although I had watched
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:22.680]  it a video of Andrew Breitbart talking about it he mentioned it and the media
[02:47:22.680 --> 02:47:26.080]  really has that they've been doing their best to ignore this information well why
[02:47:26.080 --> 02:47:32.840]  hasn't he released the videos yet because if they don't release that info I mean
[02:47:32.840 --> 02:47:38.480]  if it suddenly doesn't come out now wow well I just hope that he I'm sure he
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:43.480]  did he's a smart savvy guy I'm sure he had copies and not the various people
[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:48.240]  because this is this is red hot radioactive stuff that he's got and if
[02:47:48.240 --> 02:47:51.800]  you know he was already putting out there it's coming out this is coming out
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:55.400]  so that was kind of in the sense kind of maybe putting him in danger I mean he
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:58.720]  said just a couple years ago he's public enemy number one with the
[02:47:58.720 --> 02:48:02.440]  Democratic Party and and by the way it did come out in newspapers three years
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:07.160]  ago on the list of what top 30 enemies the White House I'm like 24 he was like
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:12.080]  number three so yeah I mean he's right up there on the enemies list and notice
[02:48:12.080 --> 02:48:15.760]  how they're kicking Buchanan off the air they're kicking Judge Napolitano
[02:48:15.760 --> 02:48:19.480]  they're purging and now I got the state police calling up trying to get me off
[02:48:19.480 --> 02:48:27.240]  the air right no it's interesting how the establishment is running scared but
[02:48:27.240 --> 02:48:31.160]  they're they're also lashing out it's from from my experience I mean just
[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:35.200]  talking to a guy like Randall Terry who is is considered sort of a fringe
[02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:40.120]  presidential candidate and and the problem he has run with the established
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:43.400]  media here and elsewhere with the associated press interviewing him three
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:47.160]  times never running stories they don't want to hear his you know stories about
[02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:53.480]  abortion and but they you know they're fine with Obama and you know this is
[02:48:53.480 --> 02:48:59.960]  what they billion dollar campaign this year Obama there's a lot at stake now
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:05.000]  now now you knew Breitbart somewhat I never thought to even try to get him on
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.960]  and I just a few weeks ago said get him on we were close to getting him and
[02:49:07.960 --> 02:49:12.680]  he's dead just amazing timing on that front but right he says he's about to
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:16.840]  release this footage and he's dead I mean you know now they could say maybe a
[02:49:16.840 --> 02:49:20.000]  heart problem well they're experts at making you look like you've died and
[02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:23.440]  maybe he did but I tell you it needs to be investigated I mean what do you know
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:29.200]  about Andrew Breitbart well I reviewed his book righteous indignation last
[02:49:29.200 --> 02:49:34.880]  year I spoke with him he was actually offer me a position to write for big
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:39.880]  journalism calm two years ago and I just taken on another writing gig at the
[02:49:39.880 --> 02:49:44.000]  time which I'm no longer involved with and so I said you know I've got to stay
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.360]  with these guys in the same I can you know get you your stories heard you know
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:52.280]  talked about on Rush Limbaugh show or Ingraham and all this you know all his
[02:49:52.280 --> 02:49:56.280]  connections in the conservative media and it's very tempting but I yeah you
[02:49:56.280 --> 02:50:00.160]  should have doubled down and done the one media and that but I understand being
[02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:04.560]  loyal go ahead yeah so anyway I didn't do it but I stayed in touch with the
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:09.640]  couple of big journalism calm reporters and they would repost some of the stuff
[02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:15.040]  that I've written on Red Dirt Report by my current website and you know he would
[02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:18.960]  exchange emails he would just kind of talk about issues of the day on occasion
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:23.680]  but I hadn't talked to him in a while but I point is he was a real guy and now
[02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:29.080]  he's dead and I don't blame his his outfit saying well they say it's natural
[02:50:29.080 --> 02:50:33.360]  causes we he'll be missing the family but I mean it's so quick though it's so
[02:50:33.360 --> 02:50:37.080]  quick right am you there gonna be an autopsy is that gonna be publicly
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:43.440]  released and this is a public figure of brash you know who said I got stuff to
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:47.120]  destroy Obama I'm about to release any drop set of a heart attack at 43 I mean
[02:50:47.120 --> 02:50:51.600]  come on folks we'd be crazy not question this what if other people start
[02:50:51.600 --> 02:50:58.400]  dying all right we'll be just stay there stay there we'll be right back

[02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:17.200]  I just talked to one of the news directors producers over at Five Dining
[02:54:17.200 --> 02:54:22.240]  who called me and doesn't know that Todd Jeffries has called me doesn't know or
[02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:27.760]  contacted me doesn't know that Mark Caesar has contacted me and he says
[02:54:27.760 --> 02:54:32.160]  yeah it's weird people keep calling asking questions about Alex Jones and
[02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:38.360]  state police and really weird stuff before today so the state police are
[02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:43.760]  just crazy people I guess they're so mad that we showed these 600 plus
[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:47.520]  thousand dollar boats that we think shouldn't cost more than maximum 200
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:50.880]  thousand we know the making model even counting all the equipment just the
[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:56.280]  boats are 600 plus thousand so I must have hit a big nerve one time I said
[02:54:56.280 --> 02:54:59.720]  the police don't need another helicopter and a bunch of harassment started
[02:54:59.720 --> 02:55:04.760]  again that was local they do not what was the county they do not want their
[02:55:04.760 --> 02:55:08.400]  goodies getting touched again I apologize to our guest Andy Riffin a red
[02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:12.440]  dirt report I've just got totally blown away my crew getting harassed followed
[02:55:12.440 --> 02:55:16.000]  by the police now they're the state police are calling a radio station like
[02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:20.160]  this is Mexico or North Korea do you ever run into this up in Oklahoma I mean
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:22.560]  what would happen in Oklahoma the state police started calling somebody's
[02:55:22.560 --> 02:55:25.840]  affiliate complaining about what the I'm not even talking about the state
[02:55:25.840 --> 02:55:32.040]  police what is this this is just another mission of the tyranny we're staying
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:36.240]  throughout the country and we're not immune from it here in Oklahoma
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:41.520]  certainly we have real problems with it I see the police everywhere so you know
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:47.280]  it's it's a real tragedy that was happening in the United States it's
[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:51.000]  really happened and I just love this country and these guys they just think
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:55.880]  the bill of rights is toilet paper and it's criminal it's criminal to harass
[02:55:55.880 --> 02:55:59.600]  media like this and you're gonna get the opposite response I guess they think
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:05.280]  I'm cowards like them and that's not how this works all right going back we went
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:09.640]  to break show I'm glad you contacted us this morning because everybody I know
[02:56:09.640 --> 02:56:13.400]  says this things to I haven't and here's my biggest smoking gun the fact with
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:17.840]  Andrew Breitbart that I checked it within two hours was about an hour and
[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:21.120]  fifty minutes of him being announced dead in early morning hours like after
[02:56:21.120 --> 02:56:26.280]  midnight tonight Pacific within hours of it the LA Times and others were already
[02:56:26.280 --> 02:56:30.640]  saying natural causes nothing to see here when a coroner or medical examiner
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:34.920]  has to make that determination go ahead right and in fact we just thought
[02:56:34.920 --> 02:56:38.800]  something like this happened and I reported on this on record about the
[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:43.160]  videographer Jeff Wright he was from Edmond, Oklahoma originally and was in
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:51.400]  Uganda and was there doing a documentary film on something that it turns out it
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:54.560]  wasn't going to be what he said it was that that's what I'm hearing Wayne
[02:56:54.560 --> 02:56:59.920]  Madsen's reported on this as well that he may have been murdered also and the
[02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:05.360]  reports changed within a day or so they said he was poisoned by thugs and then
[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:10.440]  oh he had cocaine in his system he had a stomach full of cocaine which is odd so
[02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:15.840]  you know he was looking into corruption connecting Uganda with the sort of
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:20.440]  what dominionist that family out of Washington DC and senators are involved
[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:25.280]  in the in the troops that Obama sent to Uganda last fall I mean we haven't heard
[02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:28.360]  any more about that it looks like they were doing an investigative report on
[02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:32.440]  that the guy ends up dead so this is happening all over the yeah and I'm
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:36.640]  over here getting more calls from 590 right now when they're just pouring in
[02:57:36.640 --> 02:57:41.440]  here as the state police bombard them the spokesman call like like like like
[02:57:41.440 --> 02:57:49.240]  they're calling my mommy or something that's oh man I tell you and again it
[02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:53.720]  it discussed to me for them that this is happening what's your gut tell you
[02:57:53.720 --> 02:57:58.320]  because now they're saying maybe heart maybe something else what's your gut
[02:57:58.320 --> 02:58:02.480]  tell you about Andrew right I mean he was a he was pretty wild part of your
[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:08.040]  back in college days but you know who wasn't I guess no I wasn't you know I
[02:58:08.040 --> 02:58:12.920]  don't know he was 43 you know I'm close to that age and you know I I'm not
[02:58:12.920 --> 02:58:17.720]  slowing down or anything but I'm not like I was when I was 23 so I don't know
[02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:21.760]  I think I might just tell me something happened here he was outside
[02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:25.880]  something happened to the guy as they were probably monitoring him he was
[02:58:25.880 --> 02:58:29.280]  going to release this explosive information and I think it was been
[02:58:29.280 --> 02:58:32.160]  the best it's the best is what Mike hasn't told us well they admit they've got
[02:58:32.160 --> 02:58:35.760]  microwave systems that'll make your heart stop I tell you what stay there

[03:01:23.200 --> 03:01:27.960]  if this stuff doesn't get released then what do you think we ought to do oh we
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:32.880]  we have to demand full release of everything I think and I don't know
[03:01:32.880 --> 03:01:37.360]  what his family will say but you know this is a guy who who early on saw the
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:42.880]  internet as a sort of free for all libertarian haven and took to it like a
[03:01:42.880 --> 03:01:47.600]  duck to water he was really looking for direction in his life and found it with
[03:01:47.600 --> 03:01:53.000]  the new media and that new media has been a real threat as as you well know to
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:58.240]  the old media they're in their death row and Breitbart was leading charge and
[03:01:58.240 --> 03:02:03.160]  that was taking a rightward direction and as you know the old left media didn't
[03:02:03.160 --> 03:02:08.800]  uh isn't liking it and they're gonna go down kicking and screaming and family
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:12.760]  looks like a Breitbart may have been a casualty of this and but Breitbart's
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:16.800]  obviously to continue I want to talk to you at the show who you think ought to
[03:02:16.800 --> 03:02:20.840]  contact over there to talk to or try to get on but they need to they need to get
[03:02:20.840 --> 03:02:25.360]  all that info out of they do have they have that info that is like a time bomb
[03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:30.480]  they are all in danger folks if they did kill him at be over this video they've
[03:02:30.480 --> 03:02:34.640]  got to get it out now I don't know what he was thinking having that and going
[03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:37.760]  you know we're gonna just we can bring down Obama I'm gonna release it I mean I
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:43.880]  get hyping it so it but I mean that's I guess he thought he was bulletproof see
[03:02:43.880 --> 03:02:48.320]  I know I'm not bulletproof I'm just ready to take whatever happens right
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:51.800]  and that's why I thought he was gonna be pretty immediate after the CPAC
[03:02:51.800 --> 03:02:55.280]  conference that he was gonna release it but what is he waiting for let's let's
[03:02:55.280 --> 03:03:00.480]  get this out there and that way we can really vet Obama which the media didn't
[03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:05.680]  do in 2008 you know the American people may never see those videos now and
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:09.360]  that's what's really concerning I don't really see anyone really addressing that
[03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:13.560]  right now we've got to keep talking about it that's the important thing well
[03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:17.120]  yes sir you're addressing it we're addressing it at info wars.com right
