[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:23.240]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:23.240 --> 00:30.720]  hello and welcome to the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams the health
[00:30.720 --> 00:35.360]  ranger filling in for Alex who's working on other projects today the guy
[00:35.360 --> 00:40.940]  never quits working super busy we've got a huge lineup of news for you today the
[00:40.940 --> 00:47.280]  world continues to veer towards insanity it seems we've got three maybe
[00:47.280 --> 00:51.200]  even four hard-hitting guests lined up for you throughout the show today
[00:51.200 --> 00:57.080]  including James Stewart and Raw some foods is now history it has been
[00:57.080 --> 01:03.720]  disassembled sold off sanitized eliminated from California so the
[01:03.720 --> 01:06.400]  bureaucrats there think they've won a victory we're gonna have James Stewart
[01:06.400 --> 01:11.120]  talking about that but even bigger issues what this means for America and
[01:11.120 --> 01:15.440]  the government's assault on farms and food freedom I want to thank you for
[01:15.440 --> 01:21.880]  joining me today I really put the word out about this show and the focus on the
[01:21.880 --> 01:25.000]  government's assault on farms and food freedom but of course we're going to
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.840]  cover much more than that in the third hour for example we have attorney Dale
[01:28.840 --> 01:34.760]  Carson joining us he's a former FBI agent and also a former South Miami cop
[01:34.760 --> 01:39.840]  he's the author of a book called arrest proof yourself he's an expert on how to
[01:39.840 --> 01:44.520]  not get arrested which is a very important skill today given that the
[01:44.520 --> 01:49.640]  police are sometimes anxious to throw people behind bars and we're gonna find
[01:49.640 --> 01:53.800]  out why it turns out there is kind of a point system a tally system that they
[01:53.800 --> 01:58.360]  use where their careers advance if they can arrest you for a felony crime even
[01:58.360 --> 02:02.240]  if you never get convicted of it the cops still gets the points or the tally
[02:02.240 --> 02:07.600]  for having made that arrest regardless of the merits of that arrest so Dale
[02:07.600 --> 02:11.640]  Carson will be joining us in the third hour in the second hour also we've got
[02:11.640 --> 02:17.280]  Mark Baker from bakersgreenacres.com he is the farmer whose pigs are
[02:17.280 --> 02:22.640]  threatened with being shot by the authorities in the state of Michigan
[02:22.640 --> 02:27.640]  who have decided that now all these backyard pigs are so-called feral pigs
[02:27.640 --> 02:32.600]  and they've threatened to go in and destroy these herds these light livestock
[02:32.600 --> 02:36.760]  all across the state so we're gonna have some thoughts from him he's a veteran
[02:36.760 --> 02:40.760]  of the United States Air Force and many veterans are getting extremely
[02:40.760 --> 02:45.320]  frustrated and wanting to speak out more about what they see as government
[02:45.320 --> 02:51.720]  intimidation and tyranny and oppression aimed at them now in another case that
[02:51.720 --> 02:56.480]  exemplifies the abuse of government power against American citizens we're
[02:56.480 --> 03:00.920]  also going to be covering the breaking news that's just up today about Andrew
[03:00.920 --> 03:07.280]  wordies he's the backyard chicken man from Roswell Georgia and Andrew took his
[03:07.280 --> 03:13.080]  life set himself on fire set his house on fire with himself in it just what two
[03:13.080 --> 03:18.240]  weeks ago roughly March 26th I believe was the day after being intimidated
[03:18.240 --> 03:23.640]  oppressed abused by government authorities there in Roswell Georgia for
[03:23.640 --> 03:27.440]  many years we've got a timeline of events how the bureaucrats there
[03:27.440 --> 03:33.560]  escalated the events and threw him in jail and resulted in his home being looted
[03:33.560 --> 03:37.520]  his chickens being poisoned all his valuables being stolen and then they
[03:37.520 --> 03:41.600]  tried to take his land as a green zone even though they are the ones who were
[03:41.600 --> 03:46.160]  causing the flooding that affected his land we're gonna have that story more
[03:46.160 --> 03:49.760]  details for you on that coming up right here on the Alex Jones show plus all

[05:06.680 --> 05:11.240]  working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well
[05:11.240 --> 05:16.240]  as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could eat half of what

[08:21.120 --> 08:25.280]  Adams the health ranger sitting in for Alex today thank you for joining us
[08:25.280 --> 08:30.120]  today we've got a huge lineup of not just great guests but also breaking news
[08:30.120 --> 08:37.040]  on the freedom and liberty front as always pushing the boundaries of awareness
[08:37.040 --> 08:40.040]  and awakening so that we can help people actually stand up for their liberties
[08:40.040 --> 08:45.040]  and freedoms right here on the Alex Jones show we are it sometimes is
[08:45.040 --> 08:48.560]  difficult to know where to even begin with the news we've got again piles of
[08:48.560 --> 08:52.360]  news here we're going to get right into it but I want to mention the overarching
[08:52.360 --> 08:59.240]  theme here first number one we are under chemical assault in America today by
[08:59.240 --> 09:04.560]  chemical assault I'm talking about the SSRI drugs which Alex covered yesterday
[09:04.560 --> 09:08.960]  in some detail which the LA Times even found the courage to write about the
[09:08.960 --> 09:14.040]  soldiers being drugged with SSRIs and other psychiatric drugs leading to
[09:14.040 --> 09:18.040]  violence and mayhem and murder and that's an absolute fact that is something
[09:18.040 --> 09:22.040]  that I've been harping on for years because we've seen the school shootings
[09:22.040 --> 09:26.480]  we've seen the violence we've seen the death and normally the mainstream media
[09:26.480 --> 09:31.120]  doesn't even cover the psychiatric drugs that are involved so I don't have a lot
[09:31.120 --> 09:34.440]  of nice things to say about the LA Times but kudos to them for actually
[09:34.440 --> 09:38.360]  covering that over the last few days and especially thumbs up to Alex for
[09:38.360 --> 09:42.680]  covering it here on the on the show it's not just the chemical assault on humans
[09:42.680 --> 09:46.480]  it's also the chemical assault on the insects why does that matter you might
[09:46.480 --> 09:50.560]  be laughing why does that matter well the honey bees of course about one third
[09:50.560 --> 09:55.520]  of all the food that you eat is pollinated by honey bees and without
[09:55.520 --> 09:59.320]  those pollinators of course the food supply collapses literally just
[09:59.320 --> 10:05.440]  collapses in one season and three new hard-hitting scientific studies have
[10:05.440 --> 10:10.040]  come out recently within the last just couple of weeks two of them just in the
[10:10.040 --> 10:16.520]  last week that all but prove a link between these pesticides these chemical
[10:16.520 --> 10:20.520]  synthetic pesticides and the collapse of the honey bees now I know there are other
[10:20.520 --> 10:24.400]  issues involved such as the cell phone towers there's electromagnetic
[10:24.400 --> 10:28.600]  radiation and interference and so on GMOs probably have a role in the in the
[10:28.600 --> 10:32.960]  collapse of the honey bee populations but now we know for sure that the
[10:32.960 --> 10:38.840]  pesticides do so we have this chemical assaults on humans and on insects
[10:38.840 --> 10:42.320]  affecting the food supply and at the same time that's going on we've got all
[10:42.320 --> 10:46.720]  the GMOs out there which is just another form of a really a genetic assault on
[10:46.720 --> 10:51.040]  humanity and then at the same time that's going on we've got the Obama
[10:51.040 --> 10:54.000]  administration and the government attacking all of our liberties and all
[10:54.000 --> 10:58.840]  of our freedoms and I believe based on what I've been reading and the research
[10:58.840 --> 11:02.400]  that I've been doing remember I work 16-hour days at natural news I'm the
[11:02.400 --> 11:07.280]  editor there in case you don't know so I work just like the guys here work
[11:07.280 --> 11:11.120]  Arandykes and Alex Jones and Kurt Nemo everybody worked so hard doing the
[11:11.120 --> 11:17.440]  research I believe that there is an agenda to destroy America's economy to
[11:17.440 --> 11:24.120]  take over America to centralize all the resources I mean we saw it with not just
[11:24.120 --> 11:27.080]  the attacks on the farmers which we're going to be covering here on the show in
[11:27.080 --> 11:31.520]  great detail with our guests but also with Obama signing that March 16th
[11:31.520 --> 11:36.240]  executive order that takes over control of the farms and the livestock and the
[11:36.240 --> 11:40.480]  seeds the farming equipment the food processing equipment just seizing
[11:40.480 --> 11:47.120]  control over that we saw the the member Senate bill last year what was it 501
[11:47.120 --> 11:53.520]  the Food Safety and Modernization Act that is still set to unleash a wave of
[11:53.520 --> 11:57.040]  inspectors all across the country to come in and start finding people and
[11:57.040 --> 12:02.680]  arresting people for growing gardens and having the wrong setup in their in
[12:02.680 --> 12:06.520]  their garden in their home garden in their farm situation and then this story
[12:06.520 --> 12:10.960]  we're going to cover this today the city of Roswell Georgia a total abuse of
[12:10.960 --> 12:16.280]  government power that led to the death of Andrew wordies Andrew was a backyard
[12:16.280 --> 12:22.840]  chicken farmer he is now dead having taken his life after being abused and
[12:22.840 --> 12:29.120]  tormented by the regulators there in the city of Roswell this just makes me so
[12:29.120 --> 12:32.880]  sick because this is a guy I think we could have we could have helped if we
[12:32.880 --> 12:37.600]  had known about this big remember you've heard the saying info wars saves
[12:37.600 --> 12:42.560]  lives right you know that info wars covered Julie Bass the Michigan
[12:42.560 --> 12:47.640]  Gardner who was facing jail time charges were dropped info wars and natural
[12:47.640 --> 12:52.520]  news also especially covered Mary Ann Godboldo the Detroit Michigan mother who
[12:52.520 --> 12:56.360]  refused to drug her daughter with psychiatric drugs and then was subjected
[12:56.360 --> 13:01.080]  to a SWAT team raid all the charges were dropped against her even though they
[13:01.080 --> 13:04.520]  alleged that she fired a warning shot at the police to try to defend her home
[13:04.520 --> 13:08.160]  and defend her daughter they dropped the charges why because of the public
[13:08.160 --> 13:13.480]  attention brought to the issue but this man in Roswell Georgia Andrew wordies
[13:13.480 --> 13:18.920]  is dead today because we didn't know about him because we couldn't get to him
[13:18.920 --> 13:22.760]  quickly enough we couldn't bring attention to this issue quickly enough we
[13:22.760 --> 13:26.640]  couldn't bring attention to the bureaucrats there at the city to tell
[13:26.640 --> 13:31.280]  them to stop their tyranny to stop what they're doing to stop bullying these
[13:31.280 --> 13:34.520]  innocent citizens to the point where they feel like they have nothing to lose
[13:34.520 --> 13:38.480]  and they want to kill themselves and this man did kill himself Andrew wordies
[13:38.480 --> 13:42.560]  he's dead today because of what these bureaucrats in Roswell Georgia did to
[13:42.560 --> 13:46.840]  him and we're going to go into more detail about that on the show today and
[13:46.840 --> 13:53.040]  it really I get incensed about this because we are under assault in America
[13:53.040 --> 13:57.040]  and what we saw there in Roswell Georgia was this example of what I called
[13:57.040 --> 14:00.520]  right here on the Alex Jones show last year trickle down tyranny which was
[14:00.520 --> 14:04.440]  when the federal government becomes tyrannical and oppressive then those
[14:04.440 --> 14:10.040]  ideas those those dark evil philosophies of stealing people's freedoms and
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.200]  oppressing the people and and laughing about it and having fun as the people
[14:14.200 --> 14:19.240]  suffer those ideas trickle down into the local municipalities they get down to
[14:19.240 --> 14:22.200]  the state level they get down to the local county level and the city level
[14:22.200 --> 14:26.640]  and then those bureaucrats think well we can act like little devils too then we
[14:26.640 --> 14:31.760]  can just oppress people and we can use our sick power their ego tripping ego
[14:31.760 --> 14:36.600]  maniac power to go after their political enemies people that don't bow down to
[14:36.600 --> 14:40.760]  them and lick their boots and that's what we saw in Roswell Georgia and
[14:40.760 --> 14:45.640]  that's why that man is dead today and we see it over and over again here's a
[14:45.640 --> 14:50.560]  piece out of courthouse news service right here a woman claims a cops ran
[14:50.560 --> 14:55.240]  off with her baby at the hospital she was waiting for a hospital nurse to find
[14:55.240 --> 15:00.560]  someone to remove the hospital identification bracelet and from the
[15:00.560 --> 15:05.520]  baby as a last step before leaving the hospital and then the the police
[15:05.520 --> 15:11.880]  officers there this is Maryland the MPD officers appeared and quote forcibly
[15:11.880 --> 15:18.520]  separated her from her baby causing injury to her hand and then they ran
[15:18.520 --> 15:23.800]  down the corridor in the hospital with her newborn son to the nursery while
[15:23.800 --> 15:27.320]  blocking the mother from following her child they then forced the mother to
[15:27.320 --> 15:32.360]  return to her hospital room where they stood guard so that she could not leave
[15:32.360 --> 15:36.840]  she claims after about two hours a nurse told her that child protective
[15:36.840 --> 15:41.600]  services of course had approved the separation you see how this works and
[15:41.600 --> 15:45.920]  then she was forcibly escorted out of the hospital without her baby you see
[15:45.920 --> 15:50.880]  how that works first they call the cops they make up some excuse to take your
[15:50.880 --> 15:55.760]  baby from you and then oh they call in CPS if you don't totally go along with
[15:55.760 --> 15:59.640]  it and then the CPS can take state custody of your child and force them to
[15:59.640 --> 16:04.560]  be vaccinated we saw that in Pennsylvania just what ten days ago a
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.680]  mother was forced out of the hospital she had to sleep in her car in a Walmart
[16:08.680 --> 16:12.120]  parking lot all night long so that she could then come in every few hours and
[16:12.120 --> 16:16.800]  breastfeed her baby which the the hospital staff and the CPS staff allowed
[16:16.800 --> 16:21.720]  her to breastfeed oh because they're so generous after stealing her baby and
[16:21.720 --> 16:25.440]  after forcing the baby to be vaccinated against the wishes in the will of the
[16:25.440 --> 16:28.560]  mother they then allowed her to come back in so that she could breastfeed oh
[16:28.560 --> 16:34.480]  aren't they so gracious yeah what how wonderful these people are but this is
[16:34.480 --> 16:38.680]  these are the overriding themes of what we are seeing in America today we're
[16:38.680 --> 16:45.440]  seeing runaway oppression tyranny intimidation of the people by agents of
[16:45.440 --> 16:50.200]  the government both state and local and at the city level as we mentioned and
[16:50.200 --> 16:53.480]  then we're seeing this chemical assault at the same time so these two themes I
[16:53.480 --> 16:57.640]  want you to keep these in your mind as you listen to the Alex Jones show today
[16:57.640 --> 17:03.040]  we're going to see how these themes weave throughout the stories the news the
[17:03.040 --> 17:06.720]  narratives the guests that we have on today in every one of these cases you're
[17:06.720 --> 17:11.120]  going to see these two themes becoming even more and more apparent in your mind
[17:11.120 --> 17:15.720]  because this is what's happening an assault on our freedoms a destruction of
[17:15.720 --> 17:20.360]  our economy takeover of our farms and food and a complete government takeover
[17:20.360 --> 17:25.040]  of your individual rights as parents and your individual liberties just just as
[17:25.040 --> 17:33.560]  an individual just as a person it's I'm a little angry today as you can probably
[17:33.560 --> 17:38.760]  tell look I like to come in here and do satire from time to time we do jokes
[17:38.760 --> 17:42.360]  sometimes you know we would we make fun of the of the global elite and the new
[17:42.360 --> 17:46.920]  world order and I just things are getting so serious I can't even I can't
[17:46.920 --> 17:50.600]  even get into that space anymore I can't find humor right now I'm sorry I don't I
[17:50.600 --> 17:56.240]  don't know all I all I feel is outrage at what's going on and I just I hope and
[17:56.240 --> 18:01.160]  pray that we're not going to descend into some kind of violence and we're
[18:01.160 --> 18:04.720]  going to have Patrick Henningson on in the second hour he's an info wars.com
[18:04.720 --> 18:08.200]  reporter and he's going to be talking to us about the escalation of the so-called
[18:08.200 --> 18:15.200]  race war and it just it pains my heart to to hear the talk out there of the
[18:15.200 --> 18:19.600]  the Black Panthers and these people out there the Al Sharptons and the Jesse
[18:19.600 --> 18:24.520]  Jacksons who are who are spewing hate speech and inciting hatred and inciting
[18:24.520 --> 18:29.000]  the kind of violence that they claim to be against and they're inciting it and
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.440]  if if white people were out there or radio hosts like myself or Alex were
[18:33.440 --> 18:37.040]  we're saying those things on the radio they'd be arrested immediately why is it
[18:37.040 --> 18:42.640]  okay for one group to say those things but not not another group why can't we
[18:42.640 --> 18:49.080]  all just chill out I mean we're all 99.8% genetically identical we're all
[18:49.080 --> 18:54.520]  brothers and sisters literally it's not it's not black versus white you know
[18:54.520 --> 18:59.040]  what it is it's it's the people versus the power elite versus the corporate
[18:59.040 --> 19:02.680]  controllers versus the government controllers and they know that they
[19:02.680 --> 19:06.560]  win when they get you and I and people of different skin colors and people of
[19:06.560 --> 19:10.040]  different religions to fight against each other and start a shooting war
[19:10.040 --> 19:14.920]  between each other they win the globalists win and that's why you can't
[19:14.920 --> 19:20.440]  be manipulated by it you've got to stay calm you've got to maintain your
[19:20.440 --> 19:24.800]  emotional control don't pull out the guns just because you have them we've

[23:34.800 --> 23:38.360]  bank having it led back at interest forcing taxes to service debt this
[23:38.360 --> 23:41.680]  capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the
[23:41.680 --> 23:44.440]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a
[23:44.440 --> 23:47.640]  standing army hi Ted Anderson I'm placing a silver dollar in a book
[23:47.640 --> 23:53.120]  explains our monetary system call for your copy 800-686-2237 it's time to
[23:53.120 --> 24:00.680]  understand the system call 800-686-2237 that's 800-686-2237
[24:06.960 --> 24:12.360]  yeah we're back welcome back to the Alex Jones show on Tuesday April 10th
[24:12.360 --> 24:19.320]  2012 we are fired up here at the info war studios in Austin Texas and guess
[24:19.320 --> 24:24.720]  what we're joined right now via phone by Alex Jones himself Alex are you on the
[24:24.720 --> 24:29.020]  phone with us yes coming to you via my cruddy cell phone you were just so on
[24:29.020 --> 24:34.200]  fire in the last segment I had to call in because you're absolutely right but
[24:34.200 --> 24:37.080]  but the reason we're gonna get from every angle is because we're more aware of
[24:37.080 --> 24:41.560]  it now and because the enemy knows that we're waking up and it's desperate to
[24:41.560 --> 24:46.120]  clamp back down on us but I just want to say this when you mentioned the article
[24:46.120 --> 24:50.160]  of him taking the woman's baby and that was in the news that happens all the
[24:50.160 --> 24:55.600]  time now for not vaccinating folks just understand there is no law the police
[24:55.600 --> 25:01.120]  are so brainwashed by child protective services that is just a family planning
[25:01.120 --> 25:05.520]  slash eugenics groups set up in the US around 1950 it's outside of the regular
[25:05.520 --> 25:09.800]  court that all over the place they're taking children and vaccinating at
[25:09.800 --> 25:14.920]  public schools during h1n1 three and a half years ago we were getting reports
[25:14.920 --> 25:18.960]  for parents everywhere in Alabama and Texas at New York California they were
[25:18.960 --> 25:23.520]  shooting their kids up and then it came out that indeed oh it's an accident we
[25:23.520 --> 25:28.200]  shot up hundreds of kids whose parents had said no with the h1n1 on record it
[25:28.200 --> 25:32.160]  made them sick and reduced their immunity and had all these extra viruses in it I
[25:32.160 --> 25:36.320]  mean all that's come out all that's been admitted so so it's a hoax that it's
[25:36.320 --> 25:40.920]  good for you it's a hoax that it's the law but but if parents don't know what
[25:40.920 --> 25:44.240]  they're doing or they think you're poor and ignorant your blackest panic white
[25:44.240 --> 25:47.240]  that matter of color you are asian but they think you're poor and ignorant they
[25:47.240 --> 25:51.080]  call him police they say we believe this is a bad parent because they won't
[25:51.080 --> 25:56.040]  vaccinate even though there's no law and the state takes your child shoots it up
[25:56.040 --> 26:00.080]  with a bunch of stuff we understand we're now into one and fifty one and sixty
[26:00.080 --> 26:05.520]  or so depending on the actuary with autism we are a society collapsing there's
[26:05.520 --> 26:13.160]  a video report I did up on info wars.com last night when I was on RT where I broke
[26:13.160 --> 26:17.440]  down the fact that the club of Rome through an MIT report has come out and
[26:17.440 --> 26:21.720]  said at least 50% of us in some actuaries towards will be dead within
[26:21.720 --> 26:25.960]  twenty-something years because of the total collapse of society they're
[26:25.960 --> 26:30.880]  engineering it folks you've got to realize that this is happening and the
[26:30.880 --> 26:35.440]  system is desperate there's another element to this to remember when
[26:35.440 --> 26:39.840]  the state steals your child and vaccinate that child they have their
[26:39.840 --> 26:44.680]  vaccine courts where you can't take it to a regular court they you can't make
[26:44.680 --> 26:48.920]  a claim but the damage is on your shoulders as the parents you have to pay
[26:48.920 --> 26:53.800]  for the vaccine damage it's happening so so what's happening is this hoax is
[26:53.800 --> 26:57.720]  coming down and so parents are saying no in fact many areas California more than
[26:57.720 --> 27:01.600]  seventy percent in the highly educated counties are saying no so then they pass
[27:01.600 --> 27:06.040]  the law saying we'll shoot your kid up without telling you these are criminal
[27:06.040 --> 27:11.320]  out-of-control tyrants just like the Soviets and others and it's real and
[27:11.320 --> 27:15.880]  it's happening and enclosing the system is getting desperate to be publicly
[27:15.880 --> 27:21.400]  having NBC and it takes to make George Zimmerman sound racist to have the
[27:21.400 --> 27:24.880]  black panthers the new black panthers saying we're angry there's not a race
[27:24.880 --> 27:29.280]  war get it going they the system is desperate to get us fighting with each
[27:29.280 --> 27:32.760]  other because the bankers want to sit offshore and rob us the enemy is
[27:32.760 --> 27:37.160]  Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan and crony capitalism is the opposite of free
[27:37.160 --> 27:41.800]  markets they are the enemy that's the problem that's who's setting this up
[27:41.800 --> 27:46.920]  that's who's pushing this whole thing that's the problem and so the system
[27:46.920 --> 27:50.320]  knows this is all coming to a head and enclosing that Patrick Hinnickson
[27:50.320 --> 27:53.960]  article that's at info wars calm because he's a real journalist like you over
[27:53.960 --> 27:59.640]  national news he has talked to the source inside the prosecutor's office and
[27:59.640 --> 28:04.480]  said the decision has been made not to not to even try to go to the grand jury
[28:04.480 --> 28:09.200]  and you know try and then it's gonna be a no-bill even if it does and that the
[28:09.200 --> 28:14.280]  media knows that and is still trying to play it up so when it comes out there's
[28:14.280 --> 28:18.320]  a bunch of violence that is criminal and that's what the whole new world order
[28:18.320 --> 28:22.880]  precedent media does when Nightline comes to visit me our MSNBC or the
[28:22.880 --> 28:26.080]  Southern Prairie Law Center writes articles they say we're inciting violence
[28:26.080 --> 28:30.400]  when it's the opposite this is the hoax and the fraud of these enemies of
[28:30.400 --> 28:34.760]  America these offshore propaganda arms trying to cause a civil war here in
[28:34.760 --> 28:38.400]  America it's gonna get a lot of people of all colors and police and fire
[28:38.400 --> 28:43.000]  department people killed this is going to be an absolute disaster and and and
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.280]  these terrorists are preparing to try to launch a race war in this nation to play
[28:47.280 --> 28:52.560]  us off against each other this is such a giant magnitude and Mike Adams I'm so
[28:52.560 --> 28:55.840]  honored to have sitting in for me to such an amazing job God bless you any
[28:55.840 --> 28:58.520]  that's more news coming back from break them in one of the guests that's been
[28:58.520 --> 29:02.560]  persecuted but this is real folks the government is trying to force
[29:02.560 --> 29:07.360]  inoculations on children and taking them away when there's no law that's
[29:07.360 --> 29:11.640]  kidnapping and that shows how brazen these crooks are and how far this
[29:11.640 --> 29:15.240]  tyranny's gone but they only do it the folks they think the poor and ignorant
[29:15.240 --> 29:19.720]  showing the premeditated evil of this ladies and gentlemen so speak out and
[29:19.720 --> 29:23.280]  expose it Mike Adams thank you so much for sitting in the day thank you Alex

[29:26.680 --> 29:31.560]  the system attacks you Alex when you call for restoring the Bill of Rights
[29:31.560 --> 29:35.320]  somehow they equate that with calling for violence that's absurd yet they
[29:35.320 --> 29:40.040]  allow these race wars to escalate and escalate leading to shootings and
[29:40.040 --> 29:43.360]  killings that they know are going to play in their favor they're the ones
[29:43.360 --> 29:47.120]  pushing violence we're going to keep telling the truth right here on the

[32:06.520 --> 32:11.080]  starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils
[32:11.080 --> 32:13.960]  that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[32:13.960 --> 32:18.240]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the

[33:52.160 --> 33:57.280]  is suffering from widespread paralysis caused by the vaccines themselves that
[33:57.280 --> 34:02.080]  was a story by Aaron Dykes and we we have cited Aaron Dykes as a source on
[34:02.080 --> 34:06.920]  that so there's there's a lot of cross pollination going on between info wars
[34:06.920 --> 34:10.760]  and natural news as we all try to cover this and bring you the information that

[34:15.640 --> 34:21.520]  Stewart joining us in just a minute he is the the Rossum Foods founder one of
[34:21.520 --> 34:27.240]  the founders the operator there who was thrown in jail tortured by LA County
[34:27.240 --> 34:31.280]  there's a lot more to that story you probably heard much of his story he's
[34:31.280 --> 34:35.680]  gonna be talking to us today about a lot more about what his experience being
[34:35.680 --> 34:41.120]  intimidated and being arrested and tortured by the the bureaucrats there in
[34:41.120 --> 34:46.480]  LA County and Ventura County what that means for the nation at large he he's
[34:46.480 --> 34:51.320]  got first-hand experience and he's going to lend us some insight into what that
[34:51.320 --> 34:55.040]  means for the future of America but real quickly check this out you know how
[34:55.040 --> 34:58.680]  you collapse the honeybee populations you feed them corn syrup laced with
[34:58.680 --> 35:04.320]  pesticides that's the additional news that's that's come out and in fact in
[35:04.320 --> 35:08.840]  order to remember I was talking about these pesticides these neo-nicotinoids
[35:08.840 --> 35:15.320]  is the class of pesticides that has been found yet again to collapse honeybee
[35:15.320 --> 35:19.640]  populations the way that they simulated that collapse in the lab was to feed the
[35:19.640 --> 35:26.600]  bees corn syrup with that chemical in it there you go check out more stories
[35:26.600 --> 35:29.960]  about that on infowars.com by the way I know they're posting stories right now
[35:29.960 --> 35:35.280]  as we speak I want to bring in James Stewart with a quick background just so
[35:35.280 --> 35:39.480]  you know James Stewart is the raw some foods guy he's been called the California
[35:39.480 --> 35:44.680]  milkman by the judge that reduced his bail from the $1 million level down to
[35:44.680 --> 35:50.480]  $100,000 he spent eight days lost in the LA County jail system they they sort of
[35:50.480 --> 35:56.320]  lost him in the system they flooded his jail cell with raw sewage they subjected
[35:56.320 --> 36:03.160]  him to hypothermia to denial a food basic starvation to involuntary medical
[36:03.160 --> 36:07.680]  procedures and tests had him shackled in chains and what is his crime he was
[36:07.680 --> 36:11.840]  distributing food distributing food to infants and children and many mothers
[36:11.840 --> 36:17.560]  there in California were using raw some as a distribution point for the raw
[36:17.560 --> 36:20.400]  goats milk that they were feeding their babies because they couldn't breastfeed
[36:20.400 --> 36:25.280]  so we're talking about basic nutrition for humanity we're talking about basic
[36:25.280 --> 36:31.320]  human rights and they destroyed James's food distribution point and he now faces
[36:31.320 --> 36:34.800]  many years potentially in prison the case is still pending against him he
[36:34.800 --> 36:39.200]  joins us by phone thank you James Stewart for having the courage to speak
[36:39.200 --> 36:43.640]  out and join us once again here on the Alex Jones show are you with us good
[36:43.640 --> 36:48.240]  morning Mike yes I am good morning James I I hope you're fired up man because I
[36:48.240 --> 36:53.480]  don't know about you but I'm sick of the oppression I'm I'm sick of the way they
[36:53.480 --> 36:56.760]  treat farmers and and people like you who are providing real food to real
[36:56.760 --> 37:02.200]  mothers and real infants in America I've just had it and I want to be an
[37:02.200 --> 37:05.920]  optimist long-term but in the short term it just feels like we're all under
[37:05.920 --> 37:10.240]  attack what are your thoughts on what's happening in America today based on what
[37:10.240 --> 37:13.960]  has happened to you personally well the first thing I want to say is since when
[37:13.960 --> 37:20.640]  did being involved with food and and on on top of that high quality food become
[37:20.640 --> 37:25.200]  an act of terrorism I mean really that's really the question that we asked for a
[37:25.200 --> 37:31.360]  long time when we were initially under attack from different sources you know
[37:31.360 --> 37:35.120]  who's authorizing it and for what purpose and of course we still don't have
[37:35.120 --> 37:40.320]  a real answer although as you know many people who admit there might be some new
[37:40.320 --> 37:44.760]  people on here as well a couple years ago in Massachusetts there was another
[37:44.760 --> 37:48.680]  food club that was closed and basically the FDA who was sued had to answer their
[37:48.680 --> 37:53.920]  their questions because they were sued and the the bottom line of that was is
[37:53.920 --> 37:58.080]  that you and I and the public have no right to decide and what we're going to
[37:58.080 --> 38:01.400]  put into our own bodies or our children's bodies that the FDA has the
[38:01.400 --> 38:05.040]  ultimate authority I remember that statement by the FDA shocking that we
[38:05.040 --> 38:08.360]  don't we don't even own our own bodies in essence in fact remember the FDA has
[38:08.360 --> 38:12.800]  gone after women who are who are pumping breast milk to sell it to other women
[38:12.800 --> 38:16.480]  who can't breastfeed so they're helping to save a child they're being
[38:16.480 --> 38:19.880]  intimidated by the FDA the FDA basically says you don't even own your own body
[38:19.880 --> 38:24.600]  fluids it's it's insane and you know we see it every day it's not just with
[38:24.600 --> 38:29.360]  Rossum or you know farm to fork or you know Hershberger or all the other
[38:29.360 --> 38:33.520]  people out there they're doing it now with pig farmers and the state of
[38:33.520 --> 38:38.280]  Michigan and I mean it's everywhere and so at this point it's hard to
[38:38.280 --> 38:42.640]  understand why people can't actually see that their actual freedom of choice is
[38:42.640 --> 38:47.720]  being removed well I think part of that let's remember that the mainstream media
[38:47.720 --> 38:52.320]  hasn't really even covered your story I mean did did the Washington Post did
[38:52.320 --> 38:56.360]  even the LA Times they didn't report how you were tortured in the LA County
[38:56.360 --> 39:00.360]  Jail they didn't report that at all so I think the the mainstream person out
[39:00.360 --> 39:04.360]  there who's watching CNN or Fox News or whatever especially since they they
[39:04.360 --> 39:10.160]  canceled the best show on there Judge Napolitano it's it's watered down now
[39:10.160 --> 39:14.760]  and the people don't see what's really happening so it's like how can we even
[39:14.760 --> 39:18.080]  expect the mainstream people out there to have an understanding of the reality
[39:18.080 --> 39:24.160]  of what's going on I completely agree the mainstream media is I don't think
[39:24.160 --> 39:28.880]  they're asleep I think they're part of the problem as you and I both know so
[39:28.880 --> 39:34.480]  you know at this point by the way Rossum is gone and the property has now
[39:34.480 --> 39:39.720]  been returned to vacant land so all of the so-called illegal structures and the
[39:39.720 --> 39:45.840]  community has now been completely wiped out no James I got it you know what you
[39:45.840 --> 39:49.960]  know what your problem is James you're not black enough if you were black and
[39:49.960 --> 39:54.320]  you were running Rossum foods and they came after you with guns the entire
[39:54.320 --> 39:59.280]  African-American community would be up in arms over it you're too white that's
[39:59.280 --> 40:02.960]  the problem James you're too white so the media won't cover it you got that
[40:02.960 --> 40:09.320]  yeah well you know I like I hate to bring and I would I just refuse to bring race
[40:09.320 --> 40:12.920]  into anything because you know Rossum was a community in which was open to
[40:12.920 --> 40:16.960]  everybody and it didn't matter who you were what you ate or anything else and
[40:16.960 --> 40:21.360]  that's the way I still want it and you know I don't know of what you said is
[40:21.360 --> 40:26.360]  true it probably is a little bit but I'd rather not you know bring up that
[40:26.360 --> 40:30.480]  subject because I'd rather be inclusive rather than exclusive well no no
[40:30.480 --> 40:36.040]  you're exactly right I I I was not trying to be exclude anyone what my
[40:36.040 --> 40:41.280]  point was that the media is very selective in reporting who is being
[40:41.280 --> 40:47.280]  oppressed so a white guy like you selling raw milk gets no media attention
[40:47.280 --> 40:51.040]  but if an African-American had been running that operations and sheriffs
[40:51.040 --> 40:54.560]  came in and put them in handcuffs like they did you and tortured you in the
[40:54.560 --> 41:00.960]  jail and put guns or brought guns to the scene then that would have been made
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.440]  into a much bigger issue let's be honest about it I probably can't disagree
[41:06.440 --> 41:09.640]  with you Mike and you know that's that's one of the other you know divisions
[41:09.640 --> 41:14.040]  that are going on out there they want you know people to be divided so they
[41:14.040 --> 41:19.440]  can't form a beautiful alliance with each other and I appealed to everybody
[41:19.440 --> 41:23.840]  especially in this the industry that we're in that health alternative health
[41:23.840 --> 41:27.920]  industry whatever you want to call it I appeal to people not to fight each other
[41:27.920 --> 41:32.280]  but to join forces with each other even if you respectfully disagree with the
[41:32.280 --> 41:36.880]  person that you're in but you know that you are in competition with you know
[41:36.880 --> 41:41.080]  that's the main reason why corporations are basically probably behind all of
[41:41.080 --> 41:44.600]  this is because they're trying to eliminate the competition that you and I
[41:44.600 --> 41:49.640]  both know that sales of pasteurized dairy products pharmaceuticals and whatnot
[41:49.640 --> 41:54.000]  are in the decline yes why they're in the decline as people have decided to take
[41:54.000 --> 41:58.360]  charge of their own health I agree with you completely James and in fact you you
[41:58.360 --> 42:03.280]  know I wrote a story last week about freedom is based on tolerance that we
[42:03.280 --> 42:08.440]  have to deescalate violence that we have to be inclusive of other people's views
[42:08.440 --> 42:11.480]  and other people's behaviors other people's choices even if we don't agree
[42:11.480 --> 42:15.440]  with them so I know you and I are on the same page with that I'm just I'm a
[42:15.440 --> 42:21.600]  little bit angry at the the complete unfair treatment of a person like you
[42:21.600 --> 42:25.760]  being who was so oppressed who was so mistreated who's now even now facing
[42:25.760 --> 42:31.560]  decades in prison potentially and a total media blackout on it because I
[42:31.560 --> 42:38.600]  guess what your story doesn't fit their agenda I get it Mike you know and I
[42:38.600 --> 42:43.120]  myself you know I'm appreciative of you in that article by the way in which we
[42:43.120 --> 42:48.360]  have to have tolerance of others you know otherwise we don't have freedom at
[42:48.360 --> 42:51.920]  all and that was a very well-written article my friend and I really appreciate
[42:51.920 --> 42:57.440]  it well let me take a deep breath here man because ultimately I know you and
[42:57.440 --> 43:01.120]  I are both optimists I know you and I both believe in restoring freedom
[43:01.120 --> 43:04.440]  restoring the Republic let's talk about that for a second you and I were on the
[43:04.440 --> 43:07.680]  phone just the other day talking about the difference between a democracy and a
[43:07.680 --> 43:12.240]  Republic there's a film out there on YouTube that explains that I think it's
[43:12.240 --> 43:15.440]  only a ten minute film it's very important James what what are your
[43:15.440 --> 43:21.120]  thoughts on why we need a republic and the restoration of law to put these
[43:21.120 --> 43:25.360]  tyrants in check so they can't just run rampant over everybody well first of all
[43:25.360 --> 43:29.480]  real law I mean a republic is based on the rule of law and you know that's what
[43:29.480 --> 43:33.240]  most people don't know but they're actually now they whatever the other
[43:33.240 --> 43:37.400]  force out there they're actually trying to make people like myself and you and
[43:37.400 --> 43:41.640]  Alex Jones it looked like anarchist when we're actually just the opposite we're
[43:41.640 --> 43:46.640]  totally into the you know government and and the right form of government that's
[43:46.640 --> 43:50.320]  controlled by laws of course but when they get out of hand with which if
[43:50.320 --> 43:55.280]  they're done now this is not you know we've become again what many other
[43:55.280 --> 43:58.720]  countries around the world for thousands of years have become and that's an
[43:58.720 --> 44:02.800]  oligarchy and whatnot where a group of people are controlling it and it's not a
[44:02.800 --> 44:07.040]  republic people are not protected any longer and a republic if you were if you
[44:07.040 --> 44:12.480]  actually go online and you just type into YouTube democracy versus republic
[44:12.480 --> 44:19.840]  the first video on there is amazing it's so well done you know that it informs us
[44:19.840 --> 44:24.440]  about how it all really works and what's going on in the idea of government
[44:24.440 --> 44:30.520]  and I urge people to educate themselves but you know right now I think that
[44:30.520 --> 44:34.720]  people need to stand up I think people are in fear Mike and I and I'm hoping
[44:34.720 --> 44:38.520]  that they'll get over their fears because you know they're only creating
[44:38.520 --> 44:42.960]  their own demise by not putting anything into action and I don't mean that you
[44:42.960 --> 44:47.000]  know meanly or whatnot to people but you know that's the reason why you know Ben
[44:47.000 --> 44:52.200]  Franklin said you know I gave you a republic if you can keep it now why
[44:52.200 --> 44:56.320]  did he use the word if well maybe he was suspect even from the beginning whether
[44:56.320 --> 45:00.400]  people would actually take charge and responsibility for keeping the republic
[45:00.400 --> 45:05.360]  and as we view now it's not happening well he was a student of history he saw
[45:05.360 --> 45:09.040]  what happens when power always gets corrupted always becomes more
[45:09.040 --> 45:12.760]  centralized everybody in a position of power or every organization of power
[45:12.760 --> 45:17.960]  whether it's a government or a union or a city council every body of power wants
[45:17.960 --> 45:22.880]  to grab more power it's it's actually like a nation of cancer tumors running
[45:22.880 --> 45:26.320]  around a cat cancer tumors work the same way they try to bring in blood vessels
[45:26.320 --> 45:29.440]  and bring in more nutrients so they can grow and become more powerful so we're
[45:29.440 --> 45:35.360]  looking at the cancerous government the ruling over the people without honoring
[45:35.360 --> 45:39.680]  the rule of law that's set out in the Bill of Rights in the Republic yeah well
[45:39.680 --> 45:43.400]  you know what when they start calling people like myself terrorists and I
[45:43.400 --> 45:47.600]  never used the word myself but sovereigns and you know anytime that they
[45:47.600 --> 45:51.880]  can grab a hold of the of a term or a word and use it against us because one
[45:51.880 --> 45:57.040]  one person out there who claimed he was decided to do something in violence
[45:57.040 --> 46:01.680]  which I never advocated all then they can use that word so you know we have to be
[46:01.680 --> 46:06.560]  careful as a mass of people not to actually do things I don't believe in
[46:06.560 --> 46:11.120]  violence I believe in non-violence so you know I believe that all we have to do
[46:11.120 --> 46:17.280]  is take back the power that we so unwillingly allowed to not you know
[46:17.280 --> 46:21.840]  that we don't want to take responsibility you know I completely agree with you
[46:21.840 --> 46:26.720]  um you guys all Ross and was was a community of people like-minded to
[46:26.720 --> 46:32.440]  computing a community of people that wanted to take the opportunity to
[46:32.440 --> 46:37.000]  obtain things that they couldn't find anywhere else now why is that by the way
[46:37.000 --> 46:42.120]  your comment about Judge Napolitano show Freedom Watch being taken off is
[46:42.120 --> 46:47.680]  really suspect that you know that he did a very he did an excellent job and I
[46:47.680 --> 46:52.440]  hope that he's back on someplace else yeah well he was clearly getting very
[46:52.440 --> 46:57.800]  close to the target right because that that kind of the power in his in his
[46:57.800 --> 47:00.800]  voice and the issues that he was willing to cover is probably what got him
[47:00.800 --> 47:04.000]  kicked off the air but I want to get back to the sovereign citizen issue
[47:04.000 --> 47:09.720]  because when when LA County took you into custody there and threw you in jail
[47:09.720 --> 47:14.520]  there they then took you into a little room and had a mini interrogation of
[47:14.520 --> 47:18.680]  you as I recall you relating to me and then they accused you of claiming that
[47:18.680 --> 47:22.320]  you were a sovereign citizen and then put an armband on you which of course
[47:22.320 --> 47:26.480]  echoes right back to Nazi Germany in the way those prisoners were treated
[47:26.480 --> 47:29.160]  there before they were hauled off to the gas chambers and then you were
[47:29.160 --> 47:34.200]  subjected to extra torture extra chains and shackles around your waist because
[47:34.200 --> 47:38.960]  you had this armband is that not correct James or that it is exactly correct
[47:38.960 --> 47:43.520]  and I never mentioned the word at all but no that's what they did and so they
[47:43.520 --> 47:47.360]  put a red armband which meant I was a danger to the community we're not
[47:47.360 --> 47:51.000]  talking about the community outside the jail we're talking about they said they
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.280]  were saying that I was a danger to the community inside the jail right like you
[47:55.280 --> 47:58.520]  the milkman are more dangerous than the murderers and rapists that were also
[47:58.520 --> 48:05.960]  in there really yep the gangbangers yeah unbelievable yeah it was you know I
[48:05.960 --> 48:10.240]  just find it ludicrous but you know that it just shows you I'm sharing these
[48:10.240 --> 48:15.040]  things with people so they understand that this is now happening to people
[48:15.040 --> 48:18.680]  out there you know I'm a perfect example so you know I share those things
[48:18.680 --> 48:23.560]  without any you know try to be not exaggerated oh yeah they shackled me
[48:23.560 --> 48:28.080]  and chained me to a bench for like six hours in the medical pod in the
[48:28.080 --> 48:34.480]  beginning there was a nice sheriff or whatnot inside there that I appealed to
[48:34.480 --> 48:39.440]  who not only was I shackled you know around my waist and whatnot but then
[48:39.440 --> 48:44.360]  additionally in my hands behind my back for hours but they also handcuffed me to
[48:44.360 --> 48:48.600]  the bench which meant I couldn't move more than six inches in either direction
[48:48.600 --> 48:52.400]  for hours you try that for a while and you know without actually having to
[48:52.400 --> 48:56.440]  physically touch you and torture you it's pretty torturous and but this one
[48:56.440 --> 49:00.840]  guy came over and he was a little confused as to why I would be you know
[49:00.840 --> 49:05.360]  you know shackled doubly so he actually undid the handcuffs so at least I could
[49:05.360 --> 49:08.960]  move on the bench a little bit well a little bit of mercy for you there by one
[49:08.960 --> 49:15.120]  of the prison guards I've been interviewing small farmers around Texas
[49:15.120 --> 49:18.240]  by the way that hasn't come out yet so don't want to give away that whole story
[49:18.240 --> 49:26.280]  but people cited your story James as a reason that they were afraid to start
[49:26.280 --> 49:32.160]  selling raw dairy now I'm announcing this for the first time on national radio
[49:32.160 --> 49:36.800]  I own dairy goats now in fact I milked goats before I came into the show this
[49:36.800 --> 49:42.800]  morning we've got Nigerian dwarf goats that have super sweet milk and we milk
[49:42.800 --> 49:47.360]  them twice a day and they're just amazing little creatures just just a joy
[49:47.360 --> 49:50.400]  to be around and I'm getting actual milk nutrition I'm actually starting to
[49:50.400 --> 49:54.560]  drink raw milk again because I haven't consumed milk for a long time a decade
[49:54.560 --> 49:59.560]  or more and I can't when I'm milking these goats and I'm I'm seeing this
[49:59.560 --> 50:05.320]  milk come out I can't imagine that this is a criminal substance if I go barter
[50:05.320 --> 50:09.200]  it with my neighbor I can't imagine that I could be thrown in jail for this
[50:09.200 --> 50:13.640]  substance and then I talked to these other farmers around Texas and they
[50:13.640 --> 50:16.280]  say they're afraid to sell it they don't want to get involved because they
[50:16.280 --> 50:20.560]  don't want to go to jail so there is a suppression effect happening because of
[50:20.560 --> 50:23.720]  what they did to you do you think James that's part of the reason why they're
[50:23.720 --> 50:27.880]  trying to make such a big deal out of your case I absolutely do I think they
[50:27.880 --> 50:33.160]  want to make examples of people so they will force people into not wanting to
[50:33.160 --> 50:40.600]  move into a direction that their actual creativity is is I like to stay with us
[50:40.600 --> 50:43.240]  James we got to take a quick break here we'll be right back on the Alex Jones
[50:43.240 --> 50:47.560]  show with more on food freedom with James Stewart stay with us we'll be right
[50:47.560 --> 51:05.760]  back you don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis everyone
[51:05.760 --> 51:11.080]  can feel it we know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces
[51:11.080 --> 51:16.800]  of freedom and those who love darkness bondage and enslavement yes my friends
[51:16.800 --> 51:23.120]  evil is rising but take heart for every action there is an equal and opposite
[51:23.120 --> 51:27.000]  reaction recently new world order operative Hillary Clinton admitted

[54:18.280 --> 54:22.280]  filling in for Alex today who actually called in joined us for a few minutes in
[54:22.280 --> 54:25.760]  the last segment we're talking with James Stewart the founder Ross and foods
[54:25.760 --> 54:31.400]  rossum is now completely disassembled it is gone so Ventura County has
[54:31.400 --> 54:36.560]  succeeded temporarily in their mission to destroy a food distribution center and
[54:36.560 --> 54:43.640]  denied parents the right to acquire milk that they already own because they own
[54:43.640 --> 54:47.880]  a portion of the farm a portion of the cow a portion of the goat and so on I
[54:47.880 --> 54:54.080]  want to mention a note here as James joins us about authenticity authenticity is
[54:54.080 --> 54:58.280]  crucial when you decide where to get your information who to believe who to
[54:58.280 --> 55:01.680]  listen to and these people in Washington these people at the state
[55:01.680 --> 55:05.520]  capitals and these people these bureaucrats who live in these these
[55:05.520 --> 55:09.480]  shining cities like out of Hunger Games and they and they live in their
[55:09.480 --> 55:12.560]  offices all day long and they never get out in the real world they don't know
[55:12.560 --> 55:18.400]  what real food is okay right now you are listening to James Stewart and myself
[55:18.400 --> 55:21.960]  who are two people who are intimately and authentically involved in raising our
[55:21.960 --> 55:26.120]  own food I really do milk my goats I really milk them this morning before I
[55:26.120 --> 55:30.400]  came here I don't just say that okay I'll send pictures or I'm going to shoot a
[55:30.400 --> 55:34.520]  video actually to show you how what terrorists these little goats are
[55:34.520 --> 55:38.840]  according to the FDA but we don't just say these things we are involved in
[55:38.840 --> 55:43.000]  raising our own food as much as we can it is authentic we know what we're
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.120]  talking about James what do you think about those people who sit in their
[55:47.120 --> 55:52.600]  palaces and comment on you and talk about how you should be criminalized
[55:52.600 --> 55:56.200]  even though it's people like you who are producing the food that keeps them
[55:56.200 --> 56:00.760]  alive well this is very true and by the way I want to correct to something it
[56:00.760 --> 56:06.440]  is the the county of Los Angeles that originally and most and most powerfully
[56:06.440 --> 56:11.080]  most completely is the one that eliminated Ross okay my my bad sorry
[56:11.080 --> 56:16.680]  LA Ventura is part of it in a whole another way which is also insanity
[56:16.680 --> 56:21.400]  their contention that I was involved in ripping off people is just insane
[56:21.400 --> 56:27.080]  everybody knows who I am on that level but you know again what was the question
[56:27.080 --> 56:30.840]  Mike filly well just what you think about authentic food and how it's the
[56:30.840 --> 56:34.400]  farmers across America who are feeding the tyrants who are oppressing their
[56:34.400 --> 56:41.800]  liberties it is pretty insane isn't it I mean you know we're the people who
[56:41.800 --> 56:45.360]  actually the blood sweat and the tears come from the people who were actually
[56:45.360 --> 56:49.920]  involved with their hands and doing something you know quite a few times
[56:49.920 --> 56:56.240]  people complain can they contended that they actually helped start Ross and I
[56:56.240 --> 57:00.280]  won't mention names and whatnot where they put a finger into it so to me it
[57:00.280 --> 57:03.640]  reminds me of the same thing that whoever you want to call them the
[57:03.640 --> 57:07.320]  bureaucracy the other side whatever I don't even understand and by the way
[57:07.320 --> 57:11.680]  have some a really interesting piece of news for you that happened when I was
[57:11.680 --> 57:17.160]  dismantling Ross and over the last three or four days and that was this I was at
[57:17.160 --> 57:21.520]  the last stage of removing some of the shipping containers on the lot and a
[57:21.520 --> 57:25.840]  black and white unit showed up and I won't tell from what city and I thought
[57:25.840 --> 57:29.720]  they were coming for me again the police instead the other police and they
[57:29.720 --> 57:33.560]  instead they went next door to the coffee shop and I happened to be standing
[57:33.560 --> 57:39.360]  on the sidewalk about 10 minutes later and the two officers came out one of
[57:39.360 --> 57:42.400]  them walked up to me and said are you James Stewart he said aren't you James
[57:42.400 --> 57:48.120]  Stewart I said yes I was thinking about what and he said you probably don't know
[57:48.120 --> 57:52.320]  me because I never came into your place dressed in uniform but I was one of your
[57:52.320 --> 57:58.120]  members and he said what I think has happened here is a travesty now I'm
[57:58.120 --> 58:02.360]  not gonna mention his name or what city he works for whatnot but that just shows
[58:02.360 --> 58:06.360]  you that there are people actually there were many people inside government
[58:06.360 --> 58:09.560]  that actually were members of Rossam there were you know attorneys and
[58:09.560 --> 58:14.400]  medical doctors and you name it the list was long hey James we're out of time
[58:14.400 --> 58:18.200]  believe it or not I'm gonna start in a rough but I gotta thank you for for
[58:18.200 --> 58:21.960]  being here today all right is there a website real quick that where people
[58:21.960 --> 58:27.480]  can stay informed about Rossum you know more through you than anybody else Mike

[58:49.760 --> 58:53.760]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[58:53.760 --> 58:58.120]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[58:58.120 --> 59:02.280]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[59:02.280 --> 59:06.360]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[59:06.360 --> 59:10.240]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[59:10.240 --> 59:14.520]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[59:14.520 --> 59:18.680]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[59:18.680 --> 59:23.000]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[59:23.000 --> 59:26.680]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[59:26.680 --> 59:30.880]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[59:30.880 --> 59:34.240]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution
[59:34.240 --> 59:37.960]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[59:37.960 --> 59:43.480]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government

[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:19.880]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:28.440]  alex jones we are into the second hour on the alex jones show this is Mike
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.720]  Adams the health ranger the editor of natural news filling in for alex today
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.880]  we just completed an interview with James Stewart founder of awesome foods
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.680]  about food freedom and much more gonna give you some more breaking news right
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:44.880]  now well or comments on some of the news that's out there the Red Cross calls
[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:51.640]  for drug decriminalization this is part of the ongoing wave the momentum of
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:57.120]  international and national calls for decriminalizing medical marijuana in
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:02.160]  particular and also just small quantities of recreational marijuana
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:06.000]  regardless of what you think about marijuana and by the way on the record I
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.400]  am not a recreational drug user and have never been that's right never I don't
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:17.960]  even drink alcohol but that's just my choice the what's clear from this war on
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.640]  drugs is that it really just benefits the the prison system it it benefits the
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.080]  police it benefits that that whole system that keeps people suppressed it
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:32.880]  does not in fact treat drug users for their health their medical condition
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:39.280]  which is an addiction so if we want to overcome this this drug abuse which is
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.440]  widespread across America then of course we've got to start treating this like a
[01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:48.320]  health and medical condition and not just a criminal situation now speaking of
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.920]  drug addiction here's another story the US DEA has now extended its crackdown on
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:02:00.440]  prescription painkillers to Walgreens pharmacies yes the DEA rated a Walgreens
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:07.000]  store in Jupiter Florida and it found that literally two-thirds of all the
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.720]  painkillers that were prescribed in that zip code were prescribed by this one
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:15.880]  pharmacy gee you think that's a you think someone's overdoing the
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.520]  prescriptions there a little bit you bet they are the truth is more people are
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:23.440]  addicted to prescription drugs than recreational drugs certainly a lot more
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.280]  than marijuana and the truth is a lot of the prescription drugs are just
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.520]  different patents and synthetic variations of what used to be street
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:35.000]  drugs and another truth is that the psychiatric druging of soldiers which is
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.320]  causing on just massive problems in guys could you bring up that infographic by
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:43.960]  the way on the site drugging of soldiers we created that it's very informative
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:48.840]  but that is just another way for big pharma to make more money by using human
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:53.440]  bodies as a profit-generating mechanism so for those of you on the radio you
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.680]  can't see this but on on prisonplanet.tv you can see this infographic we
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:01.280]  created over at natural news this is the psych drugging of US soldiers and it
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:05.320]  breaks it down with the statistics we have over a hundred thousand active
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:09.280]  duty soldiers on mind-altering drugs right now the side effects are suicide
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:16.320]  accidents violence and drug addiction 300% increase in illegal drug use also in
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.360]  the US military over a three-year period beginning or ending in 2008 we've got a
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:25.480]  third of the US army is now on drugs we're talking people in the field when
[01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:31.440]  they send them out into the field they give them a 180-day supply of mind
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:36.560]  altering psychiatric drugs to take into the field with them you think they you
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.960]  think the soldiers don't barter that and trade that back and forth of course
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:45.040]  they do they're all into that and it's being pushed on them even when the
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.800]  soldiers don't want it they may go to the VA hospital and say I want to be
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:51.720]  treated like a human being I want to be treated with dignity I help protect the
[01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:55.000]  freedoms of this country give me some medical assistance and you know what
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.160]  they say shut up and take these pills shut up and take this Xanax or the
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:03.880]  these painkillers or these psychotropic mind-altering drugs go home and stop
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.440]  complaining and then they go home and occasionally one of them gets violent and
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:14.320]  shoots somebody or kills themselves kills themselves or causes a problem and
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:18.000]  then they blame the soldiers they blame the soldiers and the press doesn't
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.400]  even blame the pharmaceutical industry but again kudos to the LA Times for
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:28.240]  pointing out the widespread use of those drugs by the military today in
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.640]  Houston it's a it's illegal to feed the homeless now how's that for compassion

[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.480]  chemicals and our farms and food freedoms are under assault by our
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:18.280]  government you can talk about Obama's executive order from March 16th the
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:23.280]  government seizure of farms and food and seeds and all that you talk about it
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:26.360]  thing you want ask me a question if you want but just remember I'm not a I am
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:29.600]  not a doctor so I can't give you specific health advice now let's get to
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.360]  some of the other news that has been breaking recently Alex reported on this
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.120]  yesterday and and the day well just yesterday I think you focus on this MIT
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:43.280]  predicts half of humanity could be cold in a post-industrial crash Alex miss
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:49.400]  spoken and cited that as a 90% reduction it's actually about a 50% reduction he
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:55.000]  he called me to ask me to clarify that with all of you today the chart is right
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.800]  here this is an article by Aaron Dykes on info wars calm and it is true that the
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:05.200]  MIT scientists have conducted a study in which they predict a global collapse of
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:11.880]  the population right here beginning here this dotted line at 2030 following a
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:17.160]  global economic collapse all right so we've got other other lines that they
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:21.760]  say represent global pollution industrial output per capita food per capita
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:27.000]  notice that the food decline precedes the population decline so first right
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.800]  here the food collapses that's this dotted line right there for those of you
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:36.040]  watching on prisonplanet.tv and then the population collapse soon follows well
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:41.960]  why would we have a food collapse the MIT scientists have their own theories about
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:47.400]  that but of course you as info wars listeners you probably know even more
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.320]  about why the food supply might collapse and those reasons include the
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:56.440]  genetic pollution of our agricultural system the unleashing of GMOs the rise
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:02.880]  of resistant superweeds that take over farms now the destruction of local
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:07.600]  farming and food production centers all across America by tyrannical out of
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:13.120]  control maniac governments you know food diversity it's funny in America they
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.640]  talk about strategic oil reserves and then the diversity of being able to
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.440]  produce oil in Alaska produce oil in the Gulf produce oil in Texas importing a
[01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.680]  lot of our oil but being able to have national security by producing oil
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.080]  domestically right that makes sense to everybody well what about producing food
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:36.720]  domestically and not just in the hands of the corporate food producers food that
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:41.160]  is produced in your local town in your neighborhood or nearby where you can
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:45.360]  drive out to a farmers market and actually buy some basic food such as
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:51.200]  raw fresh milk from a local farmer all of that is under attack so that is a
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.680]  national strategic resource that the country that the government doesn't
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:59.520]  seem to care about it's funny isn't it you know the government is into storing
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:05.040]  ammunition storing guns the government stores food and medicine and
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.880]  communications gear but then they're destroying the food production and going
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.120]  against guns and ammunition for the people so you see how that works the
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:18.240]  total contradiction what's good for the government to survive hard times makes
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:24.000]  you a potential terrorist if you dare do the same thing so just another
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.680]  contradiction out there but it's true the MIT study is talking about a global
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:31.440]  collapse now we've got some callers on the line let's see who's on the line and
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.520]  thank you for calling John in California you're on the air with the health
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.960]  ranger go ahead please hey my god I'm a long-time listener first on caller on
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:44.280]  reason why I'm calling is I've discussed Fukushima real quick I got many things
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:48.440]  to bring out on it one my girlfriend was there recently about two weeks ago came
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.120]  back with some illness nosebleeds she's reported she's never had nosebleeds her
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:57.560]  whole life so then I gave her some kombucha tea that seemed to kind of have
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:03.400]  an effective result past that I saw the Steven L. Manley's piece and you guys
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:08.320]  probably seen it on any news about a 500% increase in redactivity at I-131 in
[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:12.720]  the bed throughout all of the California he took samples from Santa Cruz
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:16.640]  Pacific Grove Coronel Amar just up the coast from here showing the highest
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:21.520]  readings then I thought well who else has seen this I contacted surf shops down
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.120]  here they hadn't heard the news I printed out and gave it down to them then I
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:27.720]  thought I'm gonna contact local government I called the mayor's office in
[01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.160]  Newport Beach and they never got back to me I called the city government here in
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.680]  Laguna Beach I talked to a Werner Rowlinger who's a city councilwoman and
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:38.200]  I talked to the mayor as well they hadn't seen the article so they were
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:41.240]  appreciative on that however Werner Rowlinger said that she was going to
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:46.040]  actually print out that piece off of any news and then hand it in in a discussion
[01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.720]  at a meeting that she was going to meet with Senator Diane Feinstein about the
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:54.920]  San Onofre plant that's maybe shut may be still open so what you're getting at
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.560]  here what you're describing is this massive media cover-up and you're right
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.600]  when the radiation is falling onto North America and in hitting California and
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.960]  hitting the coast there's a total blackout on that information they even
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:10.200]  change them the meters themselves then they change the EPA regulations are
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:13.880]  when you bring this information to people John are they are they paying
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.880]  attention to it then are they are they taking action on it I don't know I'm
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:21.840]  still kind of waiting to hear back and I feel like there's a slow wheel turning
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:25.440]  on that so what I decided to do was go and this weekend because I talked to them
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:28.320]  on Friday just a few days ago so then I started doing research to this whole
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.680]  matter going look free choice we have free choice if nothing else is gonna be
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:36.240]  done about this mess you know whatever the government everyone else is like
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.240]  focus on other things their own distractions I don't need to be
[01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.840]  distracted I know what's happening you know what's happening your listeners
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:45.960]  knows what's happening so we're getting dose so let's take action the one thing
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:50.320]  I want to talk about is on health the Belrad Institute out of the Belarus
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:55.120]  Ukraine our Kiev has done incredible studies with this product called vita
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:59.720]  pect and it's basically a form of pectin with additional you know natural
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:04.160]  supplements of vitamins and minerals to where they've shown in studies where
[01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:08.320]  it actually pulls cesium 137 out of the organs oh yeah there's there's children
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:12.080]  there are a lot of supplements that work in that way we've seen spirulina we've
[01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:16.200]  seen chlorella we've seen CLG use historically even in in the post-World
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:20.720]  War two Japan we've seen that in use in Russia following Chernobyl accident
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:24.240]  there's there's a lot of there are a lot of supplements that can actually pull
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:28.880]  radiation out of your body but of course once the radiation damage has happened
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:32.400]  especially to your thyroid then that's permanent damage hence the use of
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:36.920]  potassium iodide to specifically pre fill up your thyroid with that mineral
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.280]  so that more radiation isn't attracted to it I want to thank you John for your
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.440]  call and bringing up those very very important points and some possible
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:45.200]  solutions for people to check out very good information thank you for your
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:50.080]  call and your energy CJ in Michigan you are on the air go ahead please what's
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:56.240]  your question or comment hey Mike this CJ from Michigan and just want to inform
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.800]  everybody I've done some research here we know we're battling the police day

[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:15.560]  problems last year got a goat neighbors went ballistic so I did some
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:20.480]  research I'm getting be eyes enough in the big I told me hey don't worry there's
[01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:26.040]  something called Michigan right the farm act okay really look this up yeah oh
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.560]  yeah look this up Michigan right the farm act I'm a little nervous here
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:36.960]  no go ahead you're doing fine go ahead okay so as long as you're practicing the
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:44.560]  GAA M P which stands for the good you know generally accepted agricultural
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.200]  management practices that's the that's the publication every year by the
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:52.640]  Michigan State University as long as you're following that you're protected
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:56.600]  by this act and this act protects everything that has to do with the farm
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:03.840]  that sounds noises everything and it and it supersedes any zoning law this is the
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:09.880]  beauty of this law and it's that's fascinating I didn't know Michigan had
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.640]  that I wonder if other states have that let me ask you to comment on this CJ the
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:17.280]  case in Roswell Georgia that we're reporting on and by the way folks I
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.120]  don't know if that story is posted on info wars.com yet but it is the top
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:25.440]  story right now on natural news.com it involves Andrew wordies that's the
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.680]  backyard chicken farmer the lawsuit filed against him by the city of Roswell
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:32.800]  includes this text they said they declared his property to be a quote
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.360]  nuisance property which they said gave them the right to to take it over and
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.360]  what your comment on this CJ they said a nuisance property quote the property is
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:45.440]  not kept clean and sanitary and free from all accumulations of offensive
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:50.200]  matter including dead organic matter well that's just compost people kitchen
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:56.680]  compost continuing rubbish junk animal intestinal waste and urine well come on
[01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:01.120]  I urinate on my own farm is that does that make it a nuisance animal
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:06.040]  intestinal waste doesn't that just mean animal droppings I mean come on that's
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:12.040]  that's that's no big deal. Mike do a study on this law it protects all that
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:17.200]  as long as you're following you know the those practices you know you're doing
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:24.440]  certain things and then this act is so beautiful it was written very broad and
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:30.200]  inclusive there's no size limitation there's it was intentionally written
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:34.680]  like this to protect everyone now you have to be a farm what is a farm is
[01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:38.560]  someone who actually sells something so I gotta do just put a little sign out
[01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:43.600]  front eggs for sale you become a farm. Well CJ but remember remember you're
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:49.040]  you're citing law you're citing state law just as we could cite the Bill of
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:53.440]  Rights in the Constitution but now these tyrants that exist today they say
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.360]  those laws don't matter we're gonna do whatever we want because we can because
[01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:02.200]  we have the guns because we're the government tyrants they just nullify
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:06.360]  all your laws ignore it and go ahead and seize your ranch and farm and make you
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.520]  look like a criminal anyway what do you what do you say about that CJ?
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:15.320]  Exactly exactly but you know what and everyone says oh forget about it you
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:20.440]  know what I'm going to fight I'm going to fight for my rights if you don't you
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.760]  lose your rights. Absolutely. And the thing is the thing is about this law
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:32.800]  is it has in the act if someone calls on you three times and if the inspector
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.400]  comes out and sees you're following the guidelines after that then they become
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:44.240]  charged so. Wow okay. We're almost out of time CJ sorry to cut you off there you

[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:08.400]  them started using them had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.560]  regimen every day but Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:18.240]  when I saw those results I said I better follow my own advice I started taking

[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:20.920]  technology that can locate you to within centimeters not just on the x y grid but
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:24.200]  vertically as well so in other words if you have one of these chips in your
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:30.440]  cell phones they will know what floor of an apartment building at which you are
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:35.960]  residing this is from well this is by Paul Joseph Watson posted on info wars
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:39.160]  dot com right now and it's being linked to by Matt drudge over at the drudge
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.160]  report dot com so I want to thank Matt for that link the title is new microchip
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:47.120]  knows your location to within centimeters forget a chip in your
[01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:52.080]  forehead the mark of the beast is the cell phone by Paul Joseph Watson and the
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:56.960]  MIT technology review reports quote Broadcom has just rolled out a chip for
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:01.680]  smartphones that promises to indicate location ultra precisely possibly within
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:06.480]  a few centimeters vertically and horizontally indoors and out it even
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:12.080]  that they're saying that this will be useful for shopkeepers and retailers to
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:18.120]  know when you're walking by so they can then hit you with their personalized
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:23.280]  advertising messages didn't we see what what what was the movie that this was
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:29.280]  made famous by with Tom Cruise was it a Philip K Dick minority report that's
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.280]  right that was in minority reports so and now of course you got to ask well how
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.720]  would the shop how would this retailer know what your preferences are well
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:39.680]  because you've been surfing the internet and Google cookies have been tracking
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:44.200]  everything you search for and everything you visit and therefore if they share
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:47.720]  that with brick and mortar retailers and they can then know your profile the
[01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:52.240]  minute you walk by wouldn't that be weird you're on the internet one day
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.080]  searching for storeable food and MREs and then you're walking through the mall
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:26:00.800]  with your new microchip cell phone all of a sudden a billboard in front of you
[01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:06.320]  shows an ad MREs on sale for long-term preparedness and survival and you say
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.000]  whoa wait a minute how did they know that that's the kind of invasion of
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.600]  privacy that we're talking about being made possible by these microchips not
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:21.080]  to mention the ability for local police to locate you and have you arrested for
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.320]  whatever reason they might come up with and by the way we are going to have an
[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:27.480]  interview coming up in the third hour with attorney Dale Carson the author of
[01:26:27.480 --> 01:26:31.720]  arrest proof yourself who gives you tips and strategies for avoiding being
[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:36.120]  arrested how to how to handle confrontations with police in a way that
[01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:40.280]  keeps your butt out of jail basically is what that's all about you know don't
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.440]  escalate things for one thing but they could use this microchip to find you
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:49.880]  and come arrest you so let's say you milk your goat and and you have your milk
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:54.520]  on on the internet for sale I'm going to sell milk to people within the zip
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:58.800]  code or within the city they could then use your cell phone chip to come find
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:03.160]  you arrest you throw you in jail and have you tortured and chained up and
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:07.280]  shackled as a quote sovereign citizen because you're crazy to think that you
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:12.120]  should be able to milk your own goats and offer that milk for sale or trade to
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:17.880]  your neighbors pretty amazing is it now coming up just after this next break
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:22.400]  which is still a few minutes away we're gonna have an interview with Mark Baker
[01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:27.360]  he is the Michigan pig farmer whose entire herd was threatened by the
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.680]  Department of Natural Resources bureaucrats in the state of Michigan and
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:35.160]  they threaten to actually come in and just shoot all the pigs just open fire
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:38.920]  on your livestock even though they're in your fences they're in your farm you've
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:42.040]  been farming them for five or six years some of these guys out there in
[01:27:42.040 --> 01:27:46.600]  Michigan have been farming for 10 20 years the same kind of breeds state just
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.960]  wants to come in and open fire and use your livestock as target practice doesn't
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:55.360]  make any sense does it but that's what's happening so we're gonna talk to Mark
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:59.560]  Baker about that but before we get to that I've got a comment about Michigan
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:04.360]  what is wrong with Michigan bureaucrats what is wrong with these people remember
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:08.560]  this is where Julie Bass was threatened with jail time for growing a garden in
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:14.000]  Oak Park Michigan remember that town and in fact Alex Jones and Info Wars helped
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.760]  publicize that information and get all the charges dropped against Julie Bass
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:22.400]  we also had the case of Marianne Godboldo in Detroit remember the Detroit mom who
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:27.480]  refused to Medicaid her child and she was assaulted by a SWAT team and guess
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:31.120]  guess who spoke out for Marianne Godboldo in addition to her local
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:36.480]  community yeah a couple of white guys myself and Alex Jones natural news and
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.000]  Info Wars were two of the biggest alternative news sources actually
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.760]  covering that story so you know there's just another example of how we speak
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:48.120]  out for African Americans when we see injustice so anybody out there who
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:53.240]  thinks that Info Wars or Alex is racist or if they think I'm racist forget it we
[01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.440]  stand up for liberty and justice for people of all races and colors and
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:01.640]  religions and backgrounds just consistently I can't stand the justice
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:06.840]  no matter who it's being waged against and in that case Marianne Godboldo was
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:13.400]  being set up and SWAT teamed we out of completely irrationally by the state
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:18.480]  now what else is happening in in Michigan this state just seems to be
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.920]  losing its mind when it comes to farmers so we're gonna talk to Mark Baker
[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:25.120]  about that in more detail and try to get a sense of what's happening in Lansing
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:28.400]  there and why these bureaucrats are running rampant over the rights of
[01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:32.280]  citizens but it's about more than just food and farms it's about state
[01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:35.920]  bureaucrats could come to your door and your house at any time and take away
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:40.240]  your children if you don't agree to have them vaccinated or medicated in the way
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:44.280]  that the state wants you to all that strain ahead on the Alex Jones show
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.640]  state with us this is Mike Adams the health ranger and we'll be right back
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:53.440]  after this quick message stay with we're on the March the Empire's on the run
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:58.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:05.680]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had
[01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:09.480]  a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:13.600]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:17.080]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:21.800]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:26.320]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:31.080]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:15.760]  couple of minutes we've got Mark Baker from bakersgreenacres.com he is the
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:19.480]  Michigan pig farmer whose livestock has been threatened by the state of
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:24.720]  Michigan excuse me but before that we've got some got something fun for you
[01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:29.120]  here and you know that we've had this big discussion about SSRIs and psychiatric
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:32.560]  drugging of soldiers and all of that going on it's a it's a big deal and
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:39.400]  finally people are waking up to it back in 2009 I wrote a song called SSR lies
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:44.640]  and in the spirit of the creativity that goes on here at Info Wars where Alex
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:47.960]  does his parodies and the whole crew they're super talented a bunch of
[01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:52.440]  musicians here super creative crew I wanted to play for you about 45 seconds
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:57.360]  of that song while we're getting our guests online so that you can hear some
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:02.340]  of what what I was talking about back in 2009 that is now becoming more
[01:34:02.340 --> 01:34:29.440]  mainstream so go ahead and cue that song for a little bit
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:45.340]  all right so some of the some of the words there you got to take your life
[01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:50.260]  back put the knife back down throw the medication on the ground because those
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:54.100]  medical suckers are gonna psych that and if you're speaking your mind they're
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:58.260]  gonna strike that that those are the words of what you just heard there might
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:01.940]  have been a little hard to make out from the song because I wasn't really using
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:06.500]  that grade of a microphone back in 2009 but you know that's what we've got to
[01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:10.020]  get to in this country we've got to de-escalate the violence we've got to
[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:14.580]  de-escalate the the race war we've got to get the drugs out of people's minds
[01:35:14.580 --> 01:35:18.380]  stop the fluoride poisoning of America stop the GMO poisoning of our crops
[01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:22.580]  stop the electromagnetic poisoning of our brains we've got to be able to retain
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:26.780]  the consciousness and the awakening and the basic love for humanity and love
[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:29.940]  for life that's going to give us a future in this world and that means
[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:33.220]  throwing the medication away you know Whitney Houston could probably still be
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:37.220]  alive today if she wasn't using all those psychiatric drugs or pain killers in
[01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:41.780]  her case Heath Ledger is another Hollywood legend who was killed by an
[01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:45.900]  overdose of FDA approved prescription drugs it's a very long list Marilyn
[01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:50.220]  Monroe Elvis Presley Michael Jackson these their deaths were all caused in
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:56.500]  part or entirely by FDA approved pain killers and prescription drugs that is
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:02.140]  the epidemic that's really haunting us in America today now joining us to
[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:06.660]  continue our conversation about farming in America is Mark Baker from Bakers
[01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:12.060]  green acres calm he is the Michigan pig farmer that we mentioned earlier Mark are
[01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:15.860]  you with us right now I'm here Mike thank you mark for joining us today man it's
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:19.060]  great to hear from you you're very courageous American just want to give a
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:23.220]  quick background you're an Air Force veteran you've been a farmer there for
[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:27.740]  in Michigan for what five or six years something around that time about eight I
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:32.620]  got out of the service and oh for okay eight years okay I didn't know that so on
[01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:39.140]  April 1 you were there at your farm thinking oh my goodness the state is
[01:36:39.140 --> 01:36:45.180]  going to come murder slaughter my herd what actually happened that night before
[01:36:45.180 --> 01:36:50.620]  April 1 when that that regulation was going to kick in well we got tipped off
[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:55.260]  on Friday that they were coming and I called my lawyer and he made a few phone
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:37:01.500]  calls apparently the Attorney General in Michigan stepped in and said that there
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:09.420]  would not be any movement against us until our court case is settled so I had
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:14.220]  some reassurance but I there's a bit of a trust issue with these guys so I moved
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:19.780]  my family off Saturday afternoon anyway just as a precaution and then I I
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:31.620]  stood from 12 to 12 the next day waiting they didn't show all right so you could
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:36.860]  still be rated at any time under this invasive species order that the DNR in
[01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:40.620]  Michigan has actually put into place correct they had I suppose so I don't
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:46.460]  see any any concrete block from doing what they want to do they've said they
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:50.700]  won't or the Attorney General said that he's restrained them but but isn't this
[01:37:50.700 --> 01:37:55.300]  like Obama signing the NDAA that that quote legalizes secret arrest and secret
[01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:58.660]  torture and detainment of American citizens and then saying well I won't
[01:37:58.660 --> 01:38:02.260]  use it isn't that similar to what's really happening to you in Michigan it's
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:06.740]  very similar so they they want to claim they have this power over you but then
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:10.300]  they they say they will selectively restrain it in your case because you went
[01:38:10.300 --> 01:38:15.540]  public you made a YouTube video you have a family that it looks nice on on YouTube
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:20.540]  they don't want to obviously be seen as as you know rating your farm but what
[01:38:20.540 --> 01:38:25.100]  about all your other friends and neighbors and farmers are they afraid of
[01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:29.700]  being rated not only they afraid of it but they're being aggressively searched
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:36.340]  as we speak DNR has shown up at a friend of ours Ron McKendrick up in
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:46.260]  shaboy and tried to get on his farm to inspect it what they're looking for is probable cause and he
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:50.020]  told him no get a warrant well they came back the next day and then they
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:57.460]  trespassed illegally they had binoculars they were looking out into the onto his
[01:38:57.460 --> 01:39:01.180]  property to see if they could see something so there's surveilling is his
[01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:06.180]  his farm yeah and then they they parked down the road I guess I'm told
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:11.820]  it was two trucks and they were there for two days you would think that they
[01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:15.220]  would have something better to do to stake out actual terrorists if you can
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:22.180]  even find any in America you know this is the DNR that they are supposed to be
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:27.460]  just protecting wild animals out the woods and clearing trails and things like
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:30.580]  that well let me ask you this mark well first of all let me give out your
[01:39:30.580 --> 01:39:34.140]  website bakersgreenacres.com for those who want to read your blog who want to
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:39.180]  see your videos your ongoing updates and so on but I want to ask you as a United
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:45.020]  States Air Force veteran someone who put your effort your life your time on the
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:49.780]  line to help protect America and its values and its freedoms and now here
[01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:54.460]  you are being subjected to the threat of having your animals killed at gunpoint
[01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:59.060]  by the state in which you are a resident how does that make you feel I think it's
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:05.180]  a disgrace grace and I think state government here should really be a
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:11.540]  shame of what they're allowing to have happened to their citizens it seems to
[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:16.420]  me that it there's got to be more to this also because it's not just that
[01:40:16.420 --> 01:40:20.540]  they're going to back off selectively in your case that law is still on the
[01:40:20.540 --> 01:40:26.940]  books those bureaucrats have conspired to threaten you and destroy your property
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:31.340]  and put your lively destroy your livelihood in essence isn't that a crime
[01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:35.580]  or shouldn't it be a conspiracy to destroy the livelihood of an honest
[01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:42.300]  hard-working farmer well yeah in reality it is they've they've leveled a
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:48.500]  declaratory ruling at us that is it is unconstitutional and therefore illegal
[01:40:48.500 --> 01:40:59.060]  and we're duty found that American citizens who disobey orders that are illegal or unconstitutional and then it's their
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:04.860]  responsibility to try and prosecute us in the prosecution phase it'll be found
[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:10.020]  out that the orders that they have leveled are unconstitutional and then
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:15.140]  it will turn on them and now the courts will will want to know what they are
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:20.580]  doing and why they are doing that are you planning on seeking justice through
[01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:24.540]  the legal system to hold those accountable in Michigan government who
[01:41:24.540 --> 01:41:28.340]  have conspired to destroy your livelihood and slaughter your animals yes
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:34.420]  we are we a group of us farmers have sued the Michigan DNR and we probably go
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:40.220]  to court with them this summer sometime have you thought about civilly filing a
[01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:43.300]  civil suit that names the specific individuals and attempting to hold them
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:49.300]  accountable yes we have we we sued Rodney Stokes who is the director of the
[01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:53.260]  Michigan DNR would you please keep me posted on the updates on that and I'll
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:57.460]  share that information with Kurt Nemo and in the entire Info Wars team we want
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:01.780]  to see this is this is the thing mark it is time for the American people
[01:42:01.780 --> 01:42:05.860]  especially the farmers to stop just laying down and taking it and I don't
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:09.140]  mean escalating into violence I mean using the court system using the jury
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:12.940]  system for as long as we have it to take back the liberties to hold these
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:15.620]  bureaucrats and these tyrants accountable when they violate the
[01:42:15.620 --> 01:42:19.420]  Constitution and they violate our civil rights and they put us in positions that
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:23.300]  leave us no other alternative but to seek redress that's true Mike there's
[01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:27.660]  several legal defense funds out there for farmers to use we started off with
[01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:32.700]  the farm to consumer legal defense fund and they're the ones that got us going
[01:42:32.700 --> 01:42:38.860]  on this and they're in place to protect the rights of farmers but the farmers
[01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:42.180]  really have to know that a lot of this work they have to do on their own they're
[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:46.780]  the first thing they have to do is think about resistance you know if they're if
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:51.020]  they're asked to do something that unconstitutional unfair first they have
[01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:57.740]  to resist and like in in our case here the DNR if you tell them that they can't
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:02.820]  come on there's really nothing more they can do than get a search warrant and I
[01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:09.180]  think that if they go to the the judge and the county judge and ask for a search
[01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:13.660]  warrant to search for illegal pigs that I think that's gonna go over very well
[01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:18.460]  that's insane but what we saw what we just reported on another breaking news
[01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:23.500]  today the the case with Andrew wordies in Roswell Georgia this the bureaucrats
[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:29.820]  there in that city they kept pushing to try to just fabricate something or find
[01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:34.660]  something they had their own culvert clogged up that ended up flooding his
[01:43:34.660 --> 01:43:38.380]  property to create a nuisance that they then charged him with having a nuisance
[01:43:38.380 --> 01:43:43.260]  property that it's it's like once you're on their target list they can invoke all
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:48.660]  these ridiculous rules and even even create a situation where they can cite
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:52.900]  you for a violation and then throw you in jail for having that violation yeah I
[01:43:52.900 --> 01:43:57.700]  guess so but I think things are changing I think Americans to get that up
[01:43:57.700 --> 01:44:02.820]  and like in our case so people have said to me that all you have problem with the
[01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:07.260]  DNR I don't think that's the case I think the DNR has a problem with me
[01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:14.140]  because we're not gonna let up on this ever you know we're we're just not gonna
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:18.420]  let up they could do away with the declaratory ruling tomorrow and we would
[01:44:18.420 --> 01:44:24.140]  still be on them to find out why this was done who was behind it you know where
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:28.540]  the money goes we know that they're working with Michigan Pork Grows
[01:44:28.540 --> 01:44:34.380]  Association which is the concentrated animal feeding operation outfits that
[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:39.660]  are here in Michigan and those guys definitely want more market share and
[01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:45.100]  so they're they're using the DNR the strong arms small farms and put them
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:49.780]  out let me mention the farm to consumer legal defense fund because they have
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:55.100]  done some excellent work in this area their website is ftcldf.org it's
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:58.580]  obviously the acronym for their for their name farm to consumer legal defense
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:03.780]  fund but it seems like mark what you're doing and I really I really love to see
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:08.700]  your courage in doing this is you are putting the the tyrants on notice and I
[01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:12.660]  think that's what we have to do across America whether it's the farmers whether
[01:45:12.660 --> 01:45:16.140]  it's the the milkman in California whether it's the backyard chicken farmer
[01:45:16.140 --> 01:45:21.140]  in Georgia whether it's the the front yard gardener in Oak Park Michigan we
[01:45:21.140 --> 01:45:25.220]  have to put the bureaucrats on notice and say we will not be trampled on any
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:30.300]  longer we have the God given natural right to grow our own food and to not be
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:35.060]  interfered with and and and oppressed by local government tyrants just because
[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:39.900]  they're not into farming and food that's right hey and people got to remember
[01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:45.100]  first of all they're American citizens there's a lot that goes with being an
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:49.300]  American a lot of privileges with that and then these guys that are trying to
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:56.220]  push these the unconstitutional laws down our throat they have names they have
[01:45:56.220 --> 01:46:01.300]  faces they have careers and they can be sued individually and they will know
[01:46:01.300 --> 01:46:05.020]  that that's gonna affect their life profoundly just like they want to affect
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:08.980]  my life I mean they don't have a problem with you know doing away with half my
[01:46:08.980 --> 01:46:12.660]  farming operation yeah well they were gonna put you out of business basically
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:17.740]  destroyer an entire livelihood well they've done it too at least 70 Michigan
[01:46:17.740 --> 01:46:22.500]  farmers that have just just done away with their herds just because they were
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:27.740]  afraid and I think that they don't know who they are in being an American
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:33.660]  citizen they have the Constitution and you know people I've heard since this
[01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:37.500]  the starter I've heard people say well the government's just wipe wiping
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:41.540]  themselves with the Constitution well not if you don't let them that's right
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:48.900]  your fourth amendment right it's very clear and they cannot trespass on you
[01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:55.980]  unless they have or you seem like a very action-oriented individual and I don't
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:59.260]  mean that in the context of an escalation just that you're willing to
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:02.780]  take a stand for the rights that you have been granted as an American citizen
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:08.700]  in those same rights of which for which you have donated your time to help
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:14.180]  protect as a an Air Force active duty person what is the sense there in
[01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:19.900]  Michigan as you talk to others is there a sense of people getting fed up and and
[01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:23.260]  I don't want to say rising up because I don't I don't want to imply an armed
[01:47:23.260 --> 01:47:26.540]  resistance I just want to say people asserting their rights against the
[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:29.660]  bureaucrats who are clearly out of control is that happening or are people
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:34.260]  giving up and surrendering and giving in and licking boots here in Michigan
[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:41.740]  locally there's more giving up than standing up and that's sad but Michigan
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:45.580]  alright I served in the military for 20 years and I served with a lot of people
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:49.940]  from different services that were from Michigan and Michigan people are very
[01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:57.580]  hardcore people they're hard workers you know fast runners hard-living people but
[01:47:57.580 --> 01:48:02.700]  they are petrified of their government and I come here to live I'm from
[01:48:02.700 --> 01:48:06.300]  Massachusetts I came here to live because this is my wife's home and I'm just
[01:48:06.300 --> 01:48:11.420]  amazed at how how fearful these people are of their government so I I can only
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:16.820]  assume that that's just been a lifelong operation of instilling fear in these
[01:48:16.820 --> 01:48:21.020]  people especially of the DNR they're petrified of the DNR well that's part of
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:24.900]  the tactic of government is to paint people as terrorists that to then run
[01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:28.820]  these giant screens in Walmart where you've got Janet the politano saying
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:32.380]  be afraid of your neighbors spy on your neighbors watch what they do if you see
[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:36.100]  something say something your your neighbor might be a terrorist that
[01:48:36.100 --> 01:48:38.780]  might be planting a bomb no they're just they just set their purse down on the
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:42.540]  table for a second it's not a bomb okay but they train you're right mark they
[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:48.540]  train people to be afraid of each other but across the country now that's
[01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:51.860]  different story there's lots of people that are standing up and they're saying
[01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:56.980]  that we are with you and I don't mean like a hundred I mean thousand my inbox
[01:48:56.980 --> 01:49:01.900]  fills up ten times the course of the day and it's just one after another of
[01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:07.500]  support there's only been like maybe a one-tenth of one percent that has had
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:11.260]  anything negative to say about it it's usually because they misunderstand the law
[01:49:11.260 --> 01:49:17.820]  right I'll tell you something about me it's not the Air Force that put this
[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:21.980]  patriotism in me I'm from New England and when I was a kid I used to have to
[01:49:21.980 --> 01:49:27.260]  walk past a monument that told about a man named Nathan Howe that dropped his
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:32.820]  plow in the furrow to respond to the election alarm of April 18, 1776 my
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:37.660]  grandfather used to tell me about that and here was a guy that that let his power
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:42.660]  over to the side and he went back to the farmhouse probably got his gun if he
[01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:50.780]  owned one or a pitchfork and then went to the Concord Bridge to help Bob the
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:56.980]  alarm yeah and that was a blockade against Boston the British had blockaded
[01:49:56.980 --> 01:50:02.060]  Boston and were allowing people out to get food only if they'd surrender their
[01:50:02.060 --> 01:50:05.980]  fire up oh really turn in your guns and we'll and we'll give you food well that
[01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:10.100]  may be coming again in America looks like they're trying to control our food
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:14.700]  yeah that's pretty clear that's pretty clear no no question about that well
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:19.460]  look at March 16th Obama seized control over all farms and food and seeds and
[01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:22.140]  and tractors all across the country you're are you familiar with that
[01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:26.260]  executive order that was signed I heard a little bit about that well it's it's
[01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:29.180]  right there in the language it was covered here on Info Wars I covered it
[01:50:29.180 --> 01:50:32.660]  as well it's right there in plain language and it's not some throwback to
[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:36.820]  history it's actually reactivated right now in peacetime we got to go to a break

[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:28.660]  of freedom issues related to farmers food and much more the bigger picture
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:33.260]  Mark Bakers joining us right now from bakersgreenacres.com in Michigan which
[01:54:33.260 --> 01:54:36.460]  for some reason has been the hotbed of a lot of government assaults on
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:39.940]  individual liberties and rights and I don't I I'm wondering what's in the
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:44.340]  water in Michigan but I know it's probably fluoride what do you think
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:48.780]  Mark what do you think about your state what's why are they so tyrannical with
[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:54.060]  everybody there I don't know it almost it almost seems like Michigan is a place
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:58.500]  where they test things out they try to see what they can do what exactly what
[01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:04.700]  people will take well and as you said most people are taking a lot they're
[01:55:04.700 --> 01:55:09.220]  they're putting up with it and that's the it gives me hope on one hand to
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:13.860]  interview you Mark and to to hear your patriotism and your courage and your
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:17.100]  understanding of the key concepts of liberty but then you tell me these
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:20.460]  things that that make me feel kind of down that that a lot of people are
[01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:24.700]  surrendering and giving in instead of standing up I that doesn't make me feel
[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:28.900]  good well yeah we look back in history like especially at the revolution there
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:35.420]  was there was really only 20% of the colonists that resisted King George and
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:40.700]  then less than less than 2% actually picked up arms and it doesn't take a
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:48.820]  whole lot of people it just depends on you know the fervor that's in them what
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:53.220]  you've hit upon it that's exactly right Alex says it all the time a lot of
[01:55:53.220 --> 01:55:57.500]  people who are just sitting still doing nothing they don't count no the the
[01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:01.460]  revolution as you say was less than 5% of the population and and yet they won
[01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:05.540]  because they had it in their hearts they had it in their spirit to protect their
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:10.860]  liberties like you mark you're not just fighting for some legal precedent you're
[01:56:10.860 --> 01:56:13.820]  fighting for your livelihood you're fighting for your family for your
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:20.060]  future right and not just mine either Mike because they're going after right
[01:56:20.060 --> 01:56:23.900]  now it's heritage breeds the swine that they're going after but they could just
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:30.900]  as easily say that certain types of beef are invasive species or poultry that we
[01:56:30.900 --> 01:56:35.780]  like to grow out on pasture is invasive because it hurts the wild birds
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:40.460]  something like that we've actually heard those rumbling oh yeah that's coming but
[01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:44.180]  wasn't the the origin of this invasive species act you actually explained this
[01:56:44.180 --> 01:56:49.340]  to me was was originally written by Michigan to prevent the the tankers the
[01:56:49.340 --> 01:56:53.620]  big ships coming into the lake and and dumping their ballast water that was
[01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:58.420]  full of of ocean saltwater creatures that became invasive wasn't that the
[01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:03.900]  original intent behind the law yes it was it's a good law we really got to
[01:57:03.900 --> 01:57:10.180]  protect our natural resources everybody knows that but to add farm animals on to
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:15.260]  an invasive species order it's just a little over the top I think well but
[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:18.340]  here's where it's going man here's what you want to know where it's really going
[01:57:18.340 --> 01:57:22.620]  mark and all the listeners out there they're going to label humans the
[01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:26.900]  invasive species that's what's coming that's what was in depicted in hunger
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:31.260]  games that the people are the invaders and all the land belongs to the kingship
[01:57:31.260 --> 01:57:36.660]  and that humans are not allowed outside their zones everything's a green zone
[01:57:36.660 --> 01:57:41.260]  and they take your land I mean that this is part of the story in in Roswell
[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:45.300]  Georgia today well let me ask you this mark what what's ahead for you what's
[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:49.620]  what's the next step well I'm actually heading up to the upper peninsula today
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:53.340]  and we're going to have a little strategy meeting with a couple of the other
[01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:58.860]  farmers that have chosen to resist and our lawyers and just talk about what
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:03.020]  our next move is there's going to be some depositions happening and these
[01:58:03.020 --> 01:58:08.340]  people from the DNR by name will have to come in and explain the things that they
[01:58:08.340 --> 01:58:12.900]  have said these are people that have gone to college and then have made
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:18.140]  ludicrous statements about how biology works they don't know what a feral pig

[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:41.660]  including an interview with Patrick Henningson the info wars com reporter
[02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:45.900]  who has some breaking news for us about the escalation of the race war in
[02:00:45.900 --> 02:00:50.540]  America of course we are here trying to de-escalate that meanwhile the mainstream
[02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:54.420]  media and many of these other so-called nonprofits out there are actually pushing
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:58.020]  for a race war escalation all of that straight ahead here on the Alex Jones
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:01.780]  show following well that starts in the next segment also with the bottom of this
[02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:05.860]  hour in about 30 minutes we've got an interview with Dale Carson he's the
[02:01:05.860 --> 02:01:11.100]  author of this book arrest proof yourself and he's a former FBI agent he is a
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:15.500]  former Miami cop a very interesting individual I've interviewed him once
[02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:19.020]  before he's got a lot of valuable information to share with you about how
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:24.860]  to avoid arrest and confront police or handle police confrontations in a way
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:31.260]  that keeps you out of prison and doesn't doesn't cause trouble all right so I
[02:01:31.260 --> 02:01:36.580]  know that we're all trying to resist tyranny but that doesn't mean you should
[02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:40.860]  mouth off to the state trooper that just pulled you over that's not going to
[02:01:40.860 --> 02:01:44.860]  help in many cases these cops aren't the bad guys all right the cops are just
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:48.380]  doing their jobs and and some of them are actually listeners to the show some
[02:01:48.380 --> 02:01:52.460]  of them are actually quite quite well-informed patriots so we don't want
[02:01:52.460 --> 02:01:56.340]  to offend the people the good cops in the system that are actually trying to
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:01:59.820]  help us the sheriffs and the deputies especially you know Sheriff Richard
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:03.660]  Mack has been educating a lot of people we want to teach you how to properly
[02:02:03.660 --> 02:02:08.380]  interface with those individuals in law enforcement so that you don't tick them
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:11.860]  off and end up being punished as a result especially if you're not guilty of
[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:16.060]  anything so stay tuned for that at the bottom of this hour now I want to go to

[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:45.220]  refused and I cited to them the Fourth Amendment right that I have and I told

[02:08:14.180 --> 02:08:21.300]  okay we're back here on the Alex Jones show thank you for joining us today this
[02:08:21.300 --> 02:08:24.540]  is Mike Adams filling in for Alex and we're going to be joined in this segment
[02:08:24.540 --> 02:08:28.700]  by Patrick Henningson the info wars.com reporter who's been covering the
[02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:34.260]  escalation of the race wars in America he's got a feature story up on info
[02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:38.700]  wars.com right now entitled Trayvon Martin disinformation fake reporting
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:43.260]  fueling the illusion of the American race war and now joining us in studio right
[02:08:43.260 --> 02:08:47.620]  here is one of the key researchers who's been digging into the details to
[02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:52.980]  give us a truthful view not the typical mainstream lamestream media spin but the
[02:08:52.980 --> 02:08:57.180]  truthful reporting on this none other than Aaron Dykes Aaron hey man good
[02:08:57.180 --> 02:09:00.140]  to have you on today bringing me in yeah well you know the real reporting is
[02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:04.020]  coming up with Patrick because he called sources he's found out that they're
[02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:07.260]  most likely not going to be charging Zimmerman with first-degree murder
[02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:10.980]  instead his sources suggest they're going to go after that stand your ground
[02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:15.300]  thing in Florida and try to fight him on the gun rights thing overall but
[02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:18.700]  meanwhile they've been spinning this racial war thing and trying to pump it
[02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:23.580]  up and he's got mainstream reports where they reported neo-nazis marching and
[02:09:23.580 --> 02:09:27.420]  trying to stir things up only it didn't happen it didn't happen but the media
[02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:30.780]  went with it anyway okay so wait a minute wait a minute I saw this in the
[02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:34.380]  mainstream media to the neo-nazis marching through the town with their
[02:09:34.380 --> 02:09:38.380]  guns I saw pictures on the mainstream media with all their all their military
[02:09:38.380 --> 02:09:41.900]  looking gear you're saying that didn't happen well that's what Patrick
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:46.460]  Henningson's reporting he's got all the details but it came out in a Miami blog
[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:50.980]  or Florida blog only it was a total misreport he called the police station
[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:54.740]  locally found out this was not going on according to their reports and so it
[02:09:54.740 --> 02:09:59.260]  appears to be yet another hyped up thing just to stir it up in the media all
[02:09:59.260 --> 02:10:02.700]  right so we do have Patrick Henningson joining us by Skype video we're gonna go
[02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:05.980]  to you Patrick in just a second I know you're standing by to give us the the
[02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:10.460]  breakdown of that story anything anything else that's crucial to give us
[02:10:10.460 --> 02:10:13.700]  the context for the story Aaron yeah let me give you some background not on
[02:10:13.700 --> 02:10:19.060]  the Zimmerman and Trayvon case but on stirring up racial hatred in general in
[02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:24.500]  the Orlando area the same area where this case is going on back in 2006 there
[02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:29.420]  was a neo-nazi group led by a guy named David Glede he deliberately marched
[02:10:29.420 --> 02:10:34.060]  through the black community and tried to stir up hatred with his little clownish
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:38.220]  neo-nazi uniforms and the flags and whatever else I believe it was less than
[02:10:38.220 --> 02:10:41.740]  a dozen of them marching they were protected by the police the only problem
[02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:47.300]  is it came out a year later he was 100% an FBI informant just trying to stir up
[02:10:47.300 --> 02:10:51.900]  hatred and you know groups like the SPLC are not going to be far behind and it's
[02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:55.940]  interesting that a lot of the neo-nazi's continued to defend this guy David Glede
[02:10:55.940 --> 02:11:02.020]  who was outed in the Orlando Sentinel back in February 15 2007 and so there
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:05.540]  they are all you know for years trying to stir this stuff up trying to punch
[02:11:05.540 --> 02:11:09.460]  the buttons and unfortunately people have a tendency to fall for it they
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:13.620]  really shouldn't they want to divide us to keep the attention away from the
[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:17.380]  oligarchy all the looting going on in the country and divide us amongst
[02:11:17.380 --> 02:11:21.300]  ourselves on these issues yes I think we're out growing as a country no you
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:23.740]  hit it with the phrase punching our buttons they know that there are
[02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:28.060]  emotional buttons that can be punched relentlessly across the American
[02:11:28.060 --> 02:11:31.860]  population that are going to lead to a rise in hatred and violence now let's
[02:11:31.860 --> 02:11:34.780]  go ahead and go to Patrick Henningson who I believe is has joined us by Skype
[02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:38.740]  video is Patrick with us on Skype yeah I'm here can you hear me okay awesome
[02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:42.180]  yeah Patrick I can I can hear you go ahead man what would you like to lead
[02:11:42.180 --> 02:11:47.020]  in with on this story well firstly I'll preface this story with saying that I
[02:11:47.020 --> 02:11:51.780]  was able to get access to some people I won't name it who the person is but
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:56.220]  let's just say they are a judge in the Sanford court system central court
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:12:02.220]  central Florida court system the reason is is because as a child I lived very
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:07.260]  close to Sanford and my mother worked in downtown Sanford for a number of years
[02:12:07.260 --> 02:12:11.740]  so we still have some some links there so I just had to go into my little black
[02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:18.500]  book it's amazing that the if you you look at the whole spectrum of of guessing
[02:12:18.500 --> 02:12:23.500]  and not saying much which the mainstream media are very good at which is
[02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:28.340]  making headlines that don't actually declare something we've gone out here
[02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:33.380]  and just made a few basic inquiries and we're able to actually report something
[02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:38.540]  that is really going on amidst all the hype and all the race baiting and
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:44.100]  everything else which the media seems content to go into so let's very
[02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:47.020]  quickly just an overview for for those who really want to understand the
[02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:52.700]  context here who benefits from the escalation of the race war can you name
[02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:56.940]  who are the key beneficiaries in in the power structure who want this to happen
[02:12:56.940 --> 02:13:03.180]  okay well the the story about neo-nazis armed neo-nazis running patrols in
[02:13:03.180 --> 02:13:08.380]  Sanford Florida was synchronized magically on the southern poverty law
[02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:13.780]  centers website at the same time it appeared in the article in the Miami
[02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:20.700]  Newtimes okay we've dispelled this as a piece of fake news nonetheless the
[02:13:20.700 --> 02:13:26.620]  the liberal leaning blogs and so forth ran with it now Florida is got a
[02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:32.860]  reputation of being especially central Florida Stanford in particular is one
[02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:38.060]  of the best examples of racial harmony in the state of Florida believe it or not
[02:13:38.060 --> 02:13:44.020]  and this this is from long-term Florida residents who have served public office
[02:13:44.020 --> 02:13:49.740]  there who have spoken to doctors lawyers and so forth now the what we have in the
[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:53.900]  media is we have political opportunists who are looking for some cheap
[02:13:53.900 --> 02:14:01.540]  political mileage out of a racial divide white versus black rich versus poor and
[02:14:01.540 --> 02:14:06.460]  so forth and then you have members of the media who are basically addicted to
[02:14:06.460 --> 02:14:11.220]  crisis opportunity and you can say the same thing about politicians I'm not
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:15.300]  talking I'm not just talking about Al Sharpton and some of these reactionary
[02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:23.100]  foundation funded unemployable talking heads of which the comments made by
[02:14:23.100 --> 02:14:28.620]  President Obama a few weeks ago where he said if I had a son sure he looked like
[02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:32.940]  Trayvon Martin that is basically along the same lines as what Al Sharpton is
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:36.940]  doing by having marches down there the Southern Poverty Law Center believe it
[02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:42.220]  or not Mike I called them directly I spoke to the director Mark Potec and we
[02:14:42.220 --> 02:14:44.940]  had a little discussion about what was going on there I asked about the
[02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:50.580]  neo-nazis he gave me their laundry list of events going back to Jasper Texas
[02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:56.020]  with the James Bird lynching in 98 and then Toledo Ohio named all the names and
[02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:00.180]  I said well what about the new Black Panther movement I said what about these
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:04.860]  guys they're calling for a dead or alive bounty on the head of George Zimmerman
[02:15:04.860 --> 02:15:11.500]  and also calling for a race war on Tampa radio which Kurt Nemo chronicled
[02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:16.020]  very much in detail in his article yesterday I said what about this I said
[02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:19.980]  what about hate speech this is a quote from the Southern Poverty Law Center
[02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:23.660]  and I wish Alex Jones was here he'd be jumping out of his chair yeah I'm sure
[02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:30.060]  that Mark Potec said to me there's no such thing as hate speech what no such
[02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:33.300]  thing as hate speech wait a minute he means there's no such thing as hate
[02:15:33.300 --> 02:15:37.260]  speech when it comes out of their mouths but when anybody else is saying
[02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:41.060]  something then they claim that's hate speech right so total contradiction just
[02:15:41.060 --> 02:15:45.300]  as usual that's what we keep hearing in this well according to Mark you said
[02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:51.340]  it's only hate speech if there's a incitement or there is a what's legally
[02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:56.340]  termed as a true threat but they are inciting they they're openly inciting
[02:15:56.340 --> 02:16:02.100]  violence so and I went around in circles with him on this point and you know what
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:08.380]  can I say and they're one of the biggest attack dogs on the left as far as
[02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:15.140]  anti-semitic this or calling for censorship of domestic patriot groups
[02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:19.180]  and so forth this other part we lost there and I won't even get into the
[02:16:19.180 --> 02:16:24.740]  Oklahoma City bombing Elohim City incident Alex Jones can can really sink
[02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:33.020]  his teeth into that tomorrow but so the beneficiaries are people who have short
[02:16:33.020 --> 02:16:38.700]  term gains to make out of dividing society into its respective parts I'm
[02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:43.180]  working on another longer feature which I hope to have finished later today but
[02:16:43.180 --> 02:16:47.940]  definitely by tomorrow morning which is entitled we don't need another race war
[02:16:47.940 --> 02:16:53.220]  in America yeah and what it what I'm saying Mike and you can comment on this
[02:16:53.220 --> 02:16:59.900]  is this race war is a short-term warm-up phase for what's coming next which is a
[02:16:59.900 --> 02:17:06.500]  class war and that is already been ceded by the occupying movement by using
[02:17:06.500 --> 02:17:12.300]  terms like 1% and 99% and also the Black Panther movement they're saying they
[02:17:12.300 --> 02:17:16.260]  want to get rid of capitalism the new socialist neo-nazi movement they want
[02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:20.300]  to get rid of capitalism it reminds me of the climate change conference in
[02:17:20.300 --> 02:17:24.340]  Copenhagen when I went and reported for info wars where you had the foundation
[02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:29.860]  funded hippies outside wanting to break into the conference to ruin the meeting
[02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:33.940]  of all the collectivist corporate collectivists inside their collectivists
[02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:38.060]  on both sides you're on to something huge here Patrick very good analysis as
[02:17:38.060 --> 02:17:41.980]  usual so folks look for that article tomorrow on info wars.com or maybe even
[02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:45.580]  later today I want to go to Aaron here and ask Aaron a comment on these
[02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:49.100]  contradictions that Patrick just pointed out we've got this contradiction where
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:54.860]  where according to his conversation with Southern Law Poverty Center there is no
[02:17:54.860 --> 02:17:58.780]  hate speech yeah that's huge I mean they do nothing but label patriot groups who
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:03.780]  have not exhibited any hate speech as hate speech groups and then when you've
[02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:08.540]  got someone in a recording openly just calling for a sea of blood that is
[02:18:08.540 --> 02:18:12.860]  somehow not hate speech. The larger system is what gets me you ask who would
[02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:17.060]  benefit from this look at the way groups the George Soros handles have brought
[02:18:17.060 --> 02:18:21.540]  about the Arab Spring they also brought about the action in Africa that we saw
[02:18:21.540 --> 02:18:25.740]  with the Coney 2012 thing they have the groups poised to benefit from that you've
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:29.940]  got a number of oligarchical benefactors to the Occupy Wall Street why
[02:18:29.940 --> 02:18:34.220]  because they want this larger world government system built on the idea of
[02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:40.380]  social justice of a way to get justice for groups that are not represented but
[02:18:40.380 --> 02:18:44.780]  when you go back for decades for instance if you read Webster Tarpley's Obama
[02:18:44.780 --> 02:18:49.460]  unauthorized biography you see how he's a product of a number of
[02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:53.460]  extremist groups who are again trying to punch these buttons and in many cases
[02:18:53.460 --> 02:18:57.300]  it goes back to what the Ford Foundation was trying to do giving grants
[02:18:57.300 --> 02:19:02.420]  specifically to radical groups denying grants to more mainstream groups groups
[02:19:02.420 --> 02:19:06.380]  that at least are not seeking violence right got people like McGeorge Bundy the
[02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:11.340]  skull and bones acolyte pushing these programs through big money foundations
[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:15.060]  like the Ford Foundation well it's incredible when they do it it's okay
[02:19:15.060 --> 02:19:19.740]  right but when somebody else tries to actually deescalate and speak out for
[02:19:19.740 --> 02:19:22.820]  basic justice basic liberty basic common law in America they're labeled
[02:19:22.820 --> 02:19:27.740]  sovereign citizens which is now being equated with terrorism common sense has
[02:19:27.740 --> 02:19:30.380]  been thrown out the window and just the basic facts have been thrown out the
[02:19:30.380 --> 02:19:37.100]  window for example Zimmerman he's not white I mean he's not a white guy he's
[02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:40.820]  but they want to start a race war where the average white person's a honky but
[02:19:40.820 --> 02:19:44.660]  the elitist at skull and bones who are steering the whole mechanism they're not
[02:19:44.660 --> 02:19:48.460]  a hunt you know we gotta go break Aaron the term but I know I know no you're
[02:19:48.460 --> 02:19:53.700]  using it yeah exactly thank you Patrick we'll be right back stay with us on the
[02:19:53.700 --> 02:19:58.140]  Alex Jones show a lot more straight ahead stay with us
[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:06.180]  you don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis everyone
[02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:11.460]  can feel it we know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces
[02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:17.260]  of freedom and those who love darkness bondage and enslavement yes my friends
[02:20:17.260 --> 02:20:22.980]  evil is rising but take heart for every action there is an equal and
[02:20:22.980 --> 02:20:27.420]  opposite reaction recently new world order operative Hillary Clinton admitted
[02:20:27.420 --> 02:20:33.020]  they're losing the info war we are in an information war and we are losing that
[02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:38.340]  war the globalist are scared they've overreached the future of the info war

[02:24:16.820 --> 02:24:20.180]  reporter this is Mike Adams the health ranger filling in for alex today in case
[02:24:20.180 --> 02:24:25.620]  you're wondering this just in Santorum suspends GOP presidential campaign so
[02:24:25.620 --> 02:24:32.220]  Rick Santorum is out of the race clearing the path for Mitt Romney to become
[02:24:32.220 --> 02:24:36.220]  the nominee yeah after they stole it from Ron Paul
[02:24:36.220 --> 02:24:39.900]  I mean let's be honest about it as long as we're telling the truth you know
[02:24:39.900 --> 02:24:44.980]  Zimmerman isn't white and they stole the election from Ron Paul there you go for
[02:24:44.980 --> 02:24:48.820]  the record but continuing with Patrick Henningson we are talking about the
[02:24:48.820 --> 02:24:53.060]  escalation of the race for in America who benefits from that escalation and why
[02:24:53.060 --> 02:24:57.900]  we must resist it because remember our buttons are being pushed all of us white
[02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:02.260]  people black people brown people every no matter what your race or color the the
[02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:07.100]  global elite is messing with your head if you feel angry about this whole
[02:25:07.100 --> 02:25:11.780]  situation you have been manipulated so you have to resist that chill out calm
[02:25:11.780 --> 02:25:16.100]  down and realize that it's all about us working together as people to resist
[02:25:16.100 --> 02:25:19.580]  tyranny and not allowing that tyranny to make us fight against each other
[02:25:19.580 --> 02:25:24.860]  Patrick I'd like to have your thoughts on that topic actually yeah Mike I just
[02:25:24.860 --> 02:25:29.700]  want to point out that before this whole Trayvon Martin shooting media circus
[02:25:29.700 --> 02:25:34.860]  began you know things like the neo-nazi or the white supremacist movement was
[02:25:34.860 --> 02:25:40.460]  it was just about dead and buried you know it was on a life support system and
[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:46.260]  what the left-leaning media and the Al Sharptons and the Barack Obama and the
[02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:50.820]  Jeremiah rights of the world have done is they've resuscitated the white
[02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:56.300]  supremacist movement and somehow made it kind of sexy for the lowest common
[02:25:56.300 --> 02:26:02.460]  denominator of society likewise the new Black Panther movement has no appeal to
[02:26:02.460 --> 02:26:07.380]  to really anybody in today's modern America but sure enough after this
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:11.700]  circus they've now kind of risen up to have some people listening to them and
[02:26:11.700 --> 02:26:16.300]  and they are getting you know some credence and in very sort of dark and
[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:23.060]  moldy circles but you know this is a typical kind of controlled cutout two
[02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:27.180]  sides of a cardboard cutout you have the national socialist movement on one
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:31.700]  side new Black Panthers on the other and I will bet you the house that both of
[02:26:31.700 --> 02:26:39.340]  those movements have a federal informant steering their media operations and so
[02:26:39.340 --> 02:26:44.820]  forth oh you bet right there in the top of their organization yeah and any
[02:26:44.820 --> 02:26:50.300]  Americans learn one thing from this is to understand that point exactly right
[02:26:50.300 --> 02:26:54.500]  this is racial escalation theater I'm not talking about the shooting itself
[02:26:54.500 --> 02:26:57.420]  that was obviously a real event the shooting did take place but everything
[02:26:57.420 --> 02:26:59.860]  that surrounds that the context that they're building around it the
[02:26:59.860 --> 02:27:04.660]  escalation the the the words that are putting out there the poison in the
[02:27:04.660 --> 02:27:09.100]  minds of the people this is racial escalation theater taking place is there
[02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:13.820]  any other evidence Patrick that there are FBI informants or other sort of
[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:17.860]  controllers that are steering groups that specific details that you know of
[02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:23.060]  right now I can't I can't say for certain but all I can do is I could look at
[02:27:23.060 --> 02:27:27.060]  history and I can read these reports about the the weather the weather
[02:27:27.060 --> 02:27:31.020]  underground I mean it's quite likely and a lot of people don't talk about this
[02:27:31.020 --> 02:27:35.540]  but Bill Ayers if you look at his MO and you look at the MO the weather
[02:27:35.540 --> 02:27:40.100]  the weather underground Bill Ayers is anything but a radical leftist Bill
[02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:45.180]  Ayers looks to me like he was a career federal informant because otherwise he'd
[02:27:45.180 --> 02:27:50.020]  be in a federal penitentiary right now doing back-to-back life sentences so
[02:27:50.020 --> 02:27:54.940]  let's let's get real and most of these sort of radical guys who are allowed to
[02:27:54.940 --> 02:27:59.940]  be big media personalities are federal under protected under the federal
[02:27:59.940 --> 02:28:06.140]  informant cloak so to speak but you know there's another more disturbing trend
[02:28:06.140 --> 02:28:12.420]  okay if it was and this is a foundation funded thing on PBS I watched a show
[02:28:12.420 --> 02:28:18.580]  called finding your roots and there was a black professor with a white in a black
[02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:22.940]  classroom and they were talking about the founding fathers and they were
[02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:27.540]  they were basically focusing on the fact that George Washington and Thomas
[02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:31.260]  Jefferson and these guys were slave owners and then they would they're
[02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:34.380]  going to the black students and saying what do you think about this and the
[02:28:34.380 --> 02:28:37.460]  black students were saying well that that that means they're part of the
[02:28:37.460 --> 02:28:41.300]  problem you know and we thought the Constitution was this and the Constitution
[02:28:41.300 --> 02:28:47.620]  was that but these are children being manipulated by academics and foundation
[02:28:47.620 --> 02:28:52.580]  funded older people to make them say throw out the Constitution throw out the
[02:28:52.580 --> 02:28:56.220]  law of the land and that's something that this federal government and the one
[02:28:56.220 --> 02:29:01.460]  before it under George W. Bush make no mistake has been working to minimize the
[02:29:01.460 --> 02:29:05.700]  influence of the Constitution within the greater society of the United States
[02:29:05.700 --> 02:29:10.220]  that's not applying to laws what's astonishing to this to me in all this
[02:29:10.220 --> 02:29:14.860]  Patrick is that they have taken this one event which is tragic of course as any
[02:29:14.860 --> 02:29:19.300]  loss of life is tragic but in the bigger context it is tiny compared to the
[02:29:19.300 --> 02:29:23.460]  number of lives lost every single day by just prescription drugs for example
[02:29:23.460 --> 02:29:27.460]  or soldiers committing suicide because they're on psychiatric drugs or taser
[02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:31.540]  or taser guns yeah right so it's all out of context they don't have the
[02:29:31.540 --> 02:29:35.020]  priorities straight about what's really killing Americans we're all the
[02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:39.020]  victims of a police state every one of us absolutely Patrick want to thank you

[02:31:01.580 --> 02:31:06.100]  year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good

[02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:18.420]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost

[02:33:25.140 --> 02:33:31.020]  that the desperation of the system shows that we are winning why do they have to
[02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:35.260]  resort to this this race for escalation why do they have to resort to the
[02:33:35.260 --> 02:33:40.060]  fabrication of fake news why do they have to resort to the fake science to the
[02:33:40.060 --> 02:33:44.180]  dumbing down the chemical drugging the chemical lobotomizing of our children
[02:33:44.180 --> 02:33:49.060]  with vaccines and fluoride and GMOs why do they have to do that the answer is
[02:33:49.060 --> 02:33:54.700]  because we're winning the truth is winning enlightenment is winning people
[02:33:54.700 --> 02:33:59.980]  are waking up you know truth is more powerful than fiction light is more
[02:33:59.980 --> 02:34:04.100]  powerful than darkness God is more powerful than the devil to use to use
[02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:08.180]  that metaphor and the information that that we are uncovering here and
[02:34:08.180 --> 02:34:13.100]  reporting and bringing to you every day here on the info wars com team is the
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:16.540]  kind of information that's going to set humanity free it's the kind of
[02:34:16.540 --> 02:34:21.980]  information that's going to allow humanity to attain that that higher
[02:34:21.980 --> 02:34:28.420]  spiritual awareness and achievement to be free from the the bonds of tyranny to
[02:34:28.420 --> 02:34:33.140]  be free from being enslaved and oppressed by governments and in other
[02:34:33.140 --> 02:34:35.860]  organizations that have operated throughout history of course governments
[02:34:35.860 --> 02:34:42.020]  being the most dangerous of all but light will win over darkness truth will
[02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:45.820]  win over over fiction and lies and deception and that's why they're so
[02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:50.460]  desperate so when you see these tactics being used just remember in your in your
[02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:54.980]  mind just remember that this is evidence that we are winning the fight for true
[02:34:54.980 --> 02:35:00.300]  freedom and liberty and justice for all of us and our children all our future
[02:35:00.300 --> 02:35:07.420]  now one of the side effects of this growing police state is that we as the
[02:35:07.420 --> 02:35:11.940]  free individuals of America or wherever you're listening from we will have more
[02:35:11.940 --> 02:35:17.300]  interaction with police and law enforcement that interaction needs to be
[02:35:17.300 --> 02:35:22.060]  handled very very carefully in order to keep yourself out of jail to not have an
[02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:25.460]  arrest record because just an arrest record even if you're not guilty of
[02:35:25.460 --> 02:35:30.740]  anything just the record of being arrested can ruin your life and here to
[02:35:30.740 --> 02:35:36.540]  talk to us about that is Dale Carson he he's the author of this book arrest
[02:35:36.540 --> 02:35:41.700]  proof yourself give you a little more intro here he is a former FBI agent a
[02:35:41.700 --> 02:35:46.820]  former law enforcement in South Miami he's a very knowledgeable individual he
[02:35:46.820 --> 02:35:52.100]  now runs a defense law practice in Florida and he joins us to talk about
[02:35:52.100 --> 02:35:55.900]  how we can interface with law enforcement in an intelligent way that
[02:35:55.900 --> 02:35:59.820]  protects our rights asserts our rights but doesn't escalate the situation and
[02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:04.900]  I believe he's joining us by Skype video do we have Dale on Skype audio we're
[02:36:04.900 --> 02:36:09.260]  still working on the video here all right Dale it's good to have you with us
[02:36:09.260 --> 02:36:14.540]  via Skype audio good to have you on the show man how you doing I'm doing real
[02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:18.180]  well I'm doing well I got dressed up today and now you can't see me so there
[02:36:18.180 --> 02:36:21.580]  you go well we've got a still picture of you on there and you look dressed up
[02:36:21.580 --> 02:36:27.180]  there too so good well what okay we talked about this this interface with
[02:36:27.180 --> 02:36:32.660]  police I think in your book arrest proof yourself you you open my eyes I read
[02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:36.060]  this book and was just blown away you talk about how people are always
[02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:39.540]  interacting with police in ways that they they're not even aware of what are
[02:36:39.540 --> 02:36:42.900]  the most important points that people need to know right now and when they're
[02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:48.660]  out driving around that they may not be aware of good manners good manners
[02:36:48.660 --> 02:36:53.740]  always good manners there's no no replacement for that I think one of
[02:36:53.740 --> 02:36:58.540]  the keys is that as young as youngsters we learn that law enforcement's here to
[02:36:58.540 --> 02:37:03.100]  help us there's officer friendly a number of groups that try to convince us
[02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:07.260]  that that law enforcement is helpful now in an absolute crisis I don't think
[02:37:07.260 --> 02:37:11.180]  there's any question that they are helpful but any in anything other than an
[02:37:11.180 --> 02:37:17.300]  absolute crisis they are there to put you in jail and if you can understand that
[02:37:17.300 --> 02:37:21.580]  if you can put your arms around that very concept then you realize and jails
[02:37:21.580 --> 02:37:26.180]  a bad place being arrested is a bad place if you can put your arms around
[02:37:26.180 --> 02:37:30.740]  that you understand the dynamic and then when you see law enforcement you you
[02:37:30.740 --> 02:37:36.260]  appreciate the fact that with little effort they can put you in jail that's
[02:37:36.260 --> 02:37:40.500]  what they're trained to do that's what they get promoted internally based on
[02:37:40.500 --> 02:37:45.300]  the number of arrests that they make so when you see them it should make the
[02:37:45.300 --> 02:37:48.340]  hair on the back of your head stand up now when you talk about these tally
[02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:52.660]  sheets that law enforcement uses to advance their career and while they may
[02:37:52.660 --> 02:37:55.740]  say it's not a quota system it is a tally sheet where they mark down how
[02:37:55.740 --> 02:37:59.980]  many felony arrests how many non felony arrests or so on you also talk about how
[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:05.620]  when they are stopping your vehicle they don't really care about writing traffic
[02:38:05.620 --> 02:38:08.940]  tickets they're there to stop your vehicle to look for a possible felony
[02:38:08.940 --> 02:38:14.180]  arrest right that that's exactly right and and and most arrests that we see
[02:38:14.180 --> 02:38:19.020]  certainly here in my law officer from car stops I had a young fellow who was
[02:38:19.020 --> 02:38:27.580]  stopped yesterday the officer walked up to the car smelled marijuana emanating
[02:38:27.580 --> 02:38:32.580]  from the interior of the car and as a result of that he asked the individual
[02:38:32.580 --> 02:38:37.060]  to step out of the car and then he began a search now that's illegal I say that's
[02:38:37.060 --> 02:38:42.180]  illegal that's not permitted under current federal law just to search someone's
[02:38:42.180 --> 02:38:46.300]  car without either consent or a search warrant but as a practical matter when
[02:38:46.300 --> 02:38:50.860]  that happens in the field who's there to contest that right I mean the individual
[02:38:50.860 --> 02:38:54.340]  who's arrested certainly has a vested interest in saying wait wait wait it
[02:38:54.340 --> 02:39:00.100]  wasn't me I never authorized the search but of course the courts are not are
[02:39:00.100 --> 02:39:05.540]  disinclined as I think jurors are as well to believe the words coming out of
[02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:08.940]  the mouth of an individual who's been stopped for a criminal violation and
[02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:13.820]  it's odd when you think about it we know carrying dope in the car with us
[02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:20.540]  cocaine or heroin or oxycodone or rocksycodone where however its term we
[02:39:20.540 --> 02:39:25.100]  know that's illegal but anyway but let me ask you this sorry to interrupt but
[02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:29.780]  isn't it true that if you have a friend who is on a powerful psychiatric drug
[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:33.940]  or a powerful narcotic painkiller and that friend rides in the passenger seat
[02:39:33.940 --> 02:39:36.700]  of your car and they've got their pills with them in their prescription bottle
[02:39:36.700 --> 02:39:41.820]  and they drop a pill accidentally under under the seat then if you're later
[02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:46.060]  driving by yourself a cop pulls you over asks me do you mind if I look in
[02:39:46.060 --> 02:39:49.460]  your vehicle you don't have weapons do you you say no go ahead you're consenting
[02:39:49.460 --> 02:39:54.220]  to a search the cop finds that pill you go to jail for felony possession of
[02:39:54.220 --> 02:40:00.100]  illegal substances right that's a hundred percent correct yes so you're
[02:40:00.100 --> 02:40:02.900]  not gonna have an explanation you're not gonna have you don't even know it was
[02:40:02.900 --> 02:40:08.860]  there so the key to this is to not consent to a search because with absent
[02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:13.380]  consent the law enforcement officer has to obtain old search warrant so how do
[02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:17.140]  you do that they may say at this what a way of search warrants gathered is you
[02:40:17.140 --> 02:40:21.340]  have to take information in the form of an affidavit you take that to a neutral
[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:25.660]  magistrated judge the judge looks at the information you have and then makes a
[02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:28.460]  determination as to whether or not they're going to issue a search warrant
[02:40:28.460 --> 02:40:33.820]  I mean how do you as the driver say no politely so that you're not consenting
[02:40:33.820 --> 02:40:39.140]  to a search how do you have a recipe I've been around for a number of years
[02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:44.660]  officer and frankly I just can't in all good conscience consent to permitting
[02:40:44.660 --> 02:40:50.020]  you to search my car so just take it on note that that I'm refusing and not
[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:53.140]  giving my consent to search my car that's all you have to say you don't have
[02:40:53.140 --> 02:41:00.820]  to get all in their face oh no so you can just calmly and confidently assert
[02:41:00.820 --> 02:41:05.300]  your your rights right there and you can also say you know my attorneys Dale
[02:41:05.300 --> 02:41:10.180]  Carson he has told me on more than one occasion never to permit law enforcement
[02:41:10.180 --> 02:41:14.060]  to search my car and I would defer to him in this circumstance so if you'd like
[02:41:14.060 --> 02:41:17.700]  to call him please feel free you also talk about in your book arrest proof
[02:41:17.700 --> 02:41:21.220]  yourself you talk about carrying a card that I think is a really brilliant idea
[02:41:21.220 --> 02:41:25.060]  and the card has the name of your attorney it has the name of maybe someone
[02:41:25.060 --> 02:41:29.100]  you know in law enforcement it has some statements on it do you think does this
[02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:33.340]  card really work if you if you present it to a state trooper who just pulled
[02:41:33.340 --> 02:41:38.260]  you over well you know Ed Ball who was a guy who owned Dupont Corporation for
[02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:44.020]  many years used to say confusion to the enemy and certainly if you present a
[02:41:44.020 --> 02:41:51.260]  document to law enforcement that that is bonafide it's it has stapled to it a
[02:41:51.260 --> 02:41:56.340]  business card from an attorney a business card from a local police officer or
[02:41:56.340 --> 02:42:03.220]  sheriff's officer all those things tell the officer that you are legitimate that
[02:42:03.220 --> 02:42:07.780]  you're not a reason for concern for people or property in the area in
[02:42:07.780 --> 02:42:12.820]  addition to which it's confusing the officers never gotten anything like that
[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:15.820]  before yeah certainly they're gonna look at it and say well yeah wait a minute
[02:42:15.820 --> 02:42:19.540]  this guy goes to the same church my brother does I'll call my brother maybe
[02:42:19.540 --> 02:42:24.860]  he's not such a bad guy and in that way you avoid being arrested and that's the
[02:42:24.860 --> 02:42:31.260]  key if if you can complete a police citizen encounter and walk away a free
[02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:36.500]  man or woman you have won believe me you've won and let me let's get to this
[02:42:36.500 --> 02:42:40.740]  point to the police officer they're on the scene in a traffic stop situation
[02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:44.580]  they have a tremendous amount of discretion to decide what they wish to
[02:42:44.580 --> 02:42:49.100]  do with you for example even if you are committing some kind of a minor offense
[02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:52.420]  they don't necessarily have to arrest you can't they also just give you a
[02:42:52.420 --> 02:42:56.700]  notice to appear in a court and not arrest you they could they can ignore it
[02:42:56.700 --> 02:43:02.460]  entirely so just say don't do that anymore how could you have been so dumb
[02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:06.660]  and you just did the response from the the citizen should be you know your
[02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:11.140]  officer you're a hundred percent correct and I do apologize for my stupid
[02:43:11.140 --> 02:43:15.620]  behavior it won't happen again that's more likely to get you let off with
[02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:19.740]  nothing than getting in his face and saying you know there are real criminals
[02:43:19.740 --> 02:43:23.740]  around here and it makes sense to me since I am paying your salary you should
[02:43:23.740 --> 02:43:27.900]  go arrest some of those folks right don't don't get a smart mouth with them
[02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:33.820]  there are times to be polite let me give you a website Dale Carson law calm is
[02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:37.980]  that I get that right okay that's right Dale Carson law calm and the book is a
[02:43:37.980 --> 02:43:41.100]  rest proof yourself which is a good read I actually read this when someone that I
[02:43:41.100 --> 02:43:45.660]  know in in the natural health industry got arrested for marijuana position and
[02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:50.140]  they were in the process of being licensed as a medical marijuana provider
[02:43:50.140 --> 02:43:54.740]  but hadn't completed that and yet they were carrying marijuana in their vehicle
[02:43:54.740 --> 02:43:58.460]  they got arrested and it really got me thinking about wow how does this whole
[02:43:58.460 --> 02:44:01.900]  system work but let me ask you this Dale many of us who are law-abiding
[02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:06.700]  citizens such as myself I've never been arrested I've never committed any felony
[02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:10.780]  crime anything like that never been in jail even we are not concerned about
[02:44:10.780 --> 02:44:15.460]  being arrested with pot or crack because we don't carry that stuff what we're
[02:44:15.460 --> 02:44:20.540]  concerned about is being falsely arrested being set up what can innocent
[02:44:20.540 --> 02:44:25.780]  citizens do to avoid being falsely arrested or having a corrupt cop drop a
[02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:30.700]  bag of cocaine or a TSA officer they even admit to this a drop a bag of cocaine
[02:44:30.700 --> 02:44:33.980]  in your luggage what what can we do in those cases well I don't think you can
[02:44:33.980 --> 02:44:37.940]  do much about a TSA officer I mean if you're gonna fly you know you're just
[02:44:37.940 --> 02:44:42.580]  subject to their control and that's horrifying as that sounds but when
[02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:48.060]  you're in the open city and you're just traveling around the key is this and
[02:44:48.060 --> 02:44:52.460]  you're not gonna like this but I found it to be terribly true okay nothing good
[02:44:52.460 --> 02:44:57.780]  happens after about 10 or 11 o'clock at night nothing so if you're out on the
[02:44:57.780 --> 02:45:03.780]  road and you're traveling around at night okay where police have a heightened
[02:45:03.780 --> 02:45:08.420]  concern for people and property in the area you're just subject to encounter
[02:45:08.420 --> 02:45:14.140]  law enforcement and it's just better not to be there one of my ex-wives once
[02:45:14.140 --> 02:45:20.020]  asked me well you know I need to have a gun and I thought better of that frankly
[02:45:20.020 --> 02:45:25.460]  and and my answer to her was this you just don't need to be if you're if
[02:45:25.460 --> 02:45:28.540]  you're going somewhere where you think you need a gun you don't need to be
[02:45:28.540 --> 02:45:33.500]  there that's that's a good point too yes you know I think probably just staying
[02:45:33.500 --> 02:45:38.300]  out of areas where there is a high crime incident of high crime and the other
[02:45:38.300 --> 02:45:43.140]  thing is looking suspicious look it's really easy when you think about it if
[02:45:43.140 --> 02:45:48.540]  you put on a suit and tie and you drive a crown Vic that's modestly colored and
[02:45:48.540 --> 02:45:53.180]  looks like a law enforcement car and you're traveling 85 miles an hour how
[02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:56.100]  often do you think you're gonna get stopped you got a suit and a tie on and
[02:45:56.100 --> 02:45:59.820]  you're riding down the road and and it looks like a law enforcement car you're
[02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:03.300]  never gonna get stopped right right on the other hand if you're driving down
[02:46:03.300 --> 02:46:08.900]  the road like a Cheech and Chomp bomber in El Camino 1973 are you gonna get
[02:46:08.900 --> 02:46:13.580]  stopped the answer is absolutely 100% of the time right because that's where the
[02:46:13.580 --> 02:46:16.940]  arrests are right the guys got a warrant out for him the buddies that are in a
[02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:21.420]  car hiding weapons I can remember stopping a car in Miami arresting
[02:46:21.420 --> 02:46:25.740]  everybody and and finding under the backseat of the car literally hundreds
[02:46:25.740 --> 02:46:30.380]  of rounds of ammunition and four handguns so anytime you get the style
[02:46:30.380 --> 02:46:35.140]  and that was for felony arrest right yeah so anytime you're with a bunch of
[02:46:35.140 --> 02:46:40.260]  guys in a car it's like a six pack you know you can't just drink one doesn't
[02:46:40.260 --> 02:46:44.460]  this also I'm sorry go ahead no no so so if you're riding around with a bunch
[02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:48.380]  of guys in a car that's not properly licensed or tagged you're gonna get
[02:46:48.380 --> 02:46:52.220]  stopped you're gonna get questioned and if you don't have the right answers or
[02:46:52.220 --> 02:46:56.600]  if there are warrants you're gonna have a problem for example frankly you're
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:46:59.820]  riding in a car the driver is the only person who should be displaying a
[02:46:59.820 --> 02:47:03.380]  driver's license but how often if my client's been stopped and everybody in
[02:47:03.380 --> 02:47:07.820]  the car has got to produce an ID and the officer just has everybody show me your
[02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:12.860]  ID of course but but think about it what would happen if one of the guys said
[02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:17.140]  I'm not showing you anything I don't have under my fifth amendment privilege
[02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:21.700]  against self-incrimination I'm not showing you dental buddy pound salt what
[02:47:21.700 --> 02:47:25.420]  do you think is gonna happen to that kid he's gonna get pulled out and beat well
[02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:29.740]  maybe he won't get beat but he's going to jail I think he's gonna get beat and
[02:47:29.740 --> 02:47:33.180]  then he's gonna get thrown in jail and then and then they're gonna start a
[02:47:33.180 --> 02:47:38.620]  race war out of it if if he's if he's not white that's what I think it's it's a
[02:47:38.620 --> 02:47:43.820]  real problem with law enforcement and selective sorts of enforcement and it's
[02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:48.420]  been going on look we all profile that's that's a shorthand for being able
[02:47:48.420 --> 02:47:52.380]  to survive in the world you're walking down a street and you see somebody hit
[02:47:52.380 --> 02:47:56.540]  up in an alley somewhere it doesn't matter what race the individual is you're
[02:47:56.540 --> 02:48:01.540]  gonna shy away from that person hiding up in the alley right yeah profiling so
[02:48:01.540 --> 02:48:05.180]  you're so situational I think so you're saying I shouldn't ride my Harley with my
[02:48:05.180 --> 02:48:11.340]  bandana my tattoos my long sideburns I mean just just to mention a stereotype
[02:48:11.340 --> 02:48:15.140]  and you also talk about body work on your car if your car looks like it's in
[02:48:15.140 --> 02:48:19.380]  bad mechanical condition that's also another reason to get stopped huh yeah
[02:48:19.380 --> 02:48:24.020]  of course we had a favorite thing in Miami you know if you're driving down a
[02:48:24.020 --> 02:48:28.660]  road and your backup lights are on that's a violation oh yeah right so
[02:48:28.660 --> 02:48:34.060]  anything that's not right with your automobile it causes you to get stopped
[02:48:34.060 --> 02:48:38.780]  it causes you to get searched remember the officers in an elevated stance from
[02:48:38.780 --> 02:48:42.580]  you anyways looking down into your car right that's right so if you've got any
[02:48:42.580 --> 02:48:46.420]  kind of contraband or any questionable items in your car you got a problem
[02:48:46.420 --> 02:48:50.980]  because that's plain view and the officer has every right based on that to
[02:48:50.980 --> 02:48:55.700]  do what he needs to do or she needs to do let me ask you this you you probably
[02:48:55.700 --> 02:49:00.260]  you did a lot of traffic stops in your days as a Miami cop I'm sure so I loved
[02:49:00.260 --> 02:49:04.500]  them I love you loved them guess the adrenaline going you never know when you
[02:49:04.500 --> 02:49:08.260]  turn on your lights whether or not the guy's gonna rabbit from you flee from
[02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:12.140]  you and that's exciting rabbits from you everybody likes a chase right right
[02:49:12.140 --> 02:49:16.900]  it's better than there's nothing better but sliding around corners with your
[02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:22.300]  headlight and sirens and all that on man it's it's to die for sure but that's a
[02:49:22.300 --> 02:49:26.100]  good point you about the psychology of law enforcement is sometimes I mean you
[02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:29.780]  even describe them sometimes as sharks who are out on the roads looking for
[02:49:29.780 --> 02:49:34.140]  prey life can be boring as a cop if you're behind a desk a lot you need a
[02:49:34.140 --> 02:49:37.300]  little adrenaline rush you need a little excitement we know the DEA loves
[02:49:37.300 --> 02:49:41.700]  smashing indoors of marijuana clinics in California isn't there an element of
[02:49:41.700 --> 02:49:47.300]  just you know really fun excitement from time to time of course that's why we do
[02:49:47.300 --> 02:49:52.300]  it to the uninitiated you seem surprised at that boy it's a kick yeah I'm
[02:49:52.300 --> 02:49:58.740]  guys you all get white hats right and you rush into the darkness so yeah of
[02:49:58.740 --> 02:50:02.660]  course it's exciting and you're on the right side of the law you're doing what
[02:50:02.660 --> 02:50:05.580]  you're supposed to be doing at least that's what we're led to believe of
[02:50:05.580 --> 02:50:10.420]  course right so it's it's a there's a dynamic there that absolutely cannot be
[02:50:10.420 --> 02:50:16.900]  denied so it our job as innocent citizens then is to not invoke that kind of
[02:50:16.900 --> 02:50:21.420]  adrenaline response from the officer who's interacting with us then that's a
[02:50:21.420 --> 02:50:25.380]  fair point yeah I'd say that's a fair point yes because I I've I actually I
[02:50:25.380 --> 02:50:29.540]  volunteered with the police in Tucson and I remember in the in the defensive
[02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:34.260]  tactics training there they always said that resistance has met with force so if
[02:50:34.260 --> 02:50:39.100]  you bring up force the officer escalates it to more force if you chill out
[02:50:39.100 --> 02:50:43.620]  they will chill out of course of course then all right we get we've got a lot
[02:50:43.620 --> 02:50:46.580]  more stay with us Dale when I have you on the other side of this break it's

[02:54:11.860 --> 02:54:16.900]  attorney Dale Carson joining us in this final segment here on the Alex Jones
[02:54:16.900 --> 02:54:20.940]  show Tuesday April 10th this is Mike Adams the health ranger thank you for
[02:54:20.940 --> 02:54:25.180]  joining us and Dale I've got an interesting question for you you know
[02:54:25.180 --> 02:54:29.500]  what about in your book you talk about how the biggest problem that the day-to-day
[02:54:29.500 --> 02:54:33.900]  criminals have is they don't show up for court they they their alarm clock
[02:54:33.900 --> 02:54:36.420]  doesn't work they don't get out of bed and go to court and show up for the
[02:54:36.420 --> 02:54:39.580]  hearings and pay the fines and so on and then it just escalates and gets worse
[02:54:39.580 --> 02:54:44.420]  and worse but what about innocent people like James Stewart who was a guest in
[02:54:44.420 --> 02:54:48.060]  the first hour of this show where he shows up in court he goes to court on
[02:54:48.060 --> 02:54:52.100]  time on schedule to face these bogus charges because he was distributing milk
[02:54:52.100 --> 02:54:56.860]  in California he's the milkman and then he's in court one day in LA County and
[02:54:56.860 --> 02:55:02.140]  then the Ventura County Sheriff's people deputies arrest him there in the LA
[02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:07.580]  court for bogus financial crimes that they dreamed up in in Ventura County and
[02:55:07.580 --> 02:55:13.620]  he gets hauled into the system as a completely innocent victim of it how do
[02:55:13.620 --> 02:55:18.780]  you even begin to try to assert your rights in those kinds of situations well
[02:55:18.780 --> 02:55:26.460]  it's an odd thing you in in the United States if you violate a law you can
[02:55:26.460 --> 02:55:30.620]  violate a federal law a state law and municipal law and you could be charged
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:35.660]  independently by each of those agencies and what has to happen is anytime you're
[02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:40.020]  in trouble with the police law enforcement and there's a pending criminal
[02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:44.300]  case you need to be in constant communication with your the investigators
[02:55:44.300 --> 02:55:48.060]  in the other side of the case in my opposition the law enforcement people
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:52.340]  and also the state attorney's office and perhaps the US Attorney's office to
[02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:57.300]  make certain that there are no more pending charges the most shocking thing
[02:55:57.300 --> 02:56:01.580]  happens when my clients get arrested for let's say possession narcotics case
[02:56:01.580 --> 02:56:07.420]  simultaneously DEA on the federal side is working on narcotics case they
[02:56:07.420 --> 02:56:13.140]  bond out on a half million dollar bond so they put up five hundred or a hundred
[02:56:13.140 --> 02:56:16.540]  thousand dollars to bond at five hundred fifty thousand dollars they would put up
[02:56:16.540 --> 02:56:21.620]  10% they get out but before they can actually reach the jailhouse door the
[02:56:21.620 --> 02:56:25.460]  federal government hits them with a charge and so they're right back in jail
[02:56:25.460 --> 02:56:30.900]  and they're out fifty thousand dollars right you've got to coordinate that with
[02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:34.540]  your attorneys and with law enforcement to make sure those kinds of things are
[02:56:34.540 --> 02:56:39.580]  not going to happen because when they do as you mentioned there you are you've
[02:56:39.580 --> 02:56:44.980]  already expended money on law enforcement an attorney finds your bail bond and now
[02:56:44.980 --> 02:56:49.060]  all of a sudden all of that's washed away and that's just tragic well and in
[02:56:49.060 --> 02:56:52.940]  James case they slapped him with a million dollars in bail now what what
[02:56:52.940 --> 02:56:56.620]  kinds of things you've seen firsthand what what kinds of things would typically
[02:56:56.620 --> 02:57:00.100]  earn a million dollars in bail you know it's interesting you should mention that
[02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:03.980]  Jacksonville has probably the highest bonds of any place in the country that I
[02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:08.620]  know of so I often see million dollar bonds I had a case where a guy was an
[02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:14.180]  insurance fraud case minor amounts of money he'd been charged his bill bond
[02:57:14.180 --> 02:57:18.620]  was set at a million dollars and it's often punitive in other words law
[02:57:18.620 --> 02:57:21.980]  enforcement those are the people who talk to the judges and get the bonds set
[02:57:21.980 --> 02:57:26.180]  because typically you're not represented when you show up so a million dollar bond
[02:57:26.180 --> 02:57:30.820]  is not uncommon in certain of our cases but generally and this is particularly
[02:57:30.820 --> 02:57:35.740]  true in federal court bonds are never that high in federal court with rare rare
[02:57:35.740 --> 02:57:41.740]  exceptions most everyone goes home with basically a sturdy bond that's not even
[02:57:41.740 --> 02:57:47.340]  paid yet in the federal side so what it tells me is someone of your folks gets a
[02:57:47.340 --> 02:57:52.180]  million dollar bond somebody's trying to send him a real message oh yeah they
[02:57:52.180 --> 02:57:56.020]  were and they did as they tortured him and abuse him in the LA County jail look
[02:57:56.020 --> 02:57:59.180]  we're almost out of time but Dale I want to thank you for joining us and encourage
