[00:24.840 --> 00:29.960]  welcome to thank you for joining us we are live it is Sunday the 23rd day of August
[00:29.960 --> 00:35.600]  2009 we're gonna be live here for the next two hours we're gonna have wide open phones
[00:35.600 --> 00:42.280]  any news item any issue any story you want to cover any question any comment the phones

[00:56.760 --> 01:04.400]  okay where to start where to begin I have several large very important stacks of news
[01:04.400 --> 01:13.440]  and information here number one we have Rasmussen and other national scientific highly respected
[01:13.440 --> 01:24.320]  polls showing that Obama now has a this is staggering 41% approval rating the lowest
[01:24.320 --> 01:32.000]  previous to this was Jimmy Carter with a 46 eight months into his administration eight
[01:32.000 --> 01:42.360]  months and two days this is the lowest ever for any president so the bigger they are the
[01:42.360 --> 01:47.080]  harder they fall people expected this guy to walk on water they expected to have their
[01:47.080 --> 01:52.080]  houses paid for their cars paid for the wars to end the warrantless wiretapping to end the
[01:52.080 --> 01:57.640]  police state to end and of course they're just getting more of it Obama is their closer
[01:57.640 --> 02:03.200]  he is meant to take all of the George Bush's policies and make them look trendy and progressive
[02:03.200 --> 02:14.120]  and basically repackage them he's a great case point for a college advertising class
[02:14.120 --> 02:22.160]  in RTF of what advertising is take something that it isn't and repackage it and sell it
[02:22.160 --> 02:26.480]  as something that it isn't where people buy into the idea of the fraud but when you're
[02:26.480 --> 02:32.160]  losing your job losing your house losing your country losing your future all the slick
[02:32.160 --> 02:39.880]  teleprompters all the Harvard lawyer trained speech all the fancy suits it means nothing
[02:39.880 --> 02:47.560]  reality is beginning to set in on the propaganda of Barack H Obama.
[02:47.560 --> 02:52.720]  So we're going to talk about that today also more congressmen more governors coming out
[02:52.720 --> 02:58.560]  saying they don't want martial law under the staged flu pandemic coming up in just a few
[02:58.560 --> 03:05.600]  months at the media has been hyping and we keep seeing stories about Miami Dolphins getting
[03:05.600 --> 03:11.160]  it and baseball teams getting it Taylor made to hype the fear and then weeks later it always
[03:11.160 --> 03:17.840]  comes out they didn't really have the dreaded swine flu.
[03:17.840 --> 03:23.840]  And remember you've had less than less than 2000 deaths worldwide less than 200 here in
[03:23.840 --> 03:29.520]  the US but the media is acting like it's the end of the world when your normal flu every
[03:29.520 --> 03:36.040]  year kills almost half a million people worldwide 36 and a half thousand close to 37,000 people
[03:36.040 --> 03:37.440]  in the US alone.
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.640]  What is going to happen when the regular flu season hits and tens of thousands die if
[03:41.640 --> 03:47.200]  they've almost shut down our society under a level six pandemic global police state under
[03:47.200 --> 03:51.160]  a few hundred people dying in the US what is going to happen when tens of thousands
[03:51.160 --> 03:56.520]  die that's why we continue to cover this a lot of new big developments on that front
[03:56.520 --> 04:05.440]  as well also of all people Larry Flynn who is very influential has the 10th largest magazine
[04:05.440 --> 04:11.760]  in the world has been a mainline Democrat his entire life a mainline liberal he's coming
[04:11.760 --> 04:15.640]  out saying both parties are controlled by the new world order by the Rothschilds by
[04:15.640 --> 04:22.200]  the Rockefellers the article he wrote is just unbelievable and I happen to know because
[04:22.200 --> 04:30.600]  I ran into the one of the main editors at hustler he came to our event in 2006 in L.A.
[04:30.600 --> 04:35.440]  our 9-11 event that was on c-span that it's our material that's woken up Larry Flynn and
[04:35.440 --> 04:40.080]  love him or hate him it's a big deal to have Larry for Flint coming out attacking Obama
[04:40.080 --> 04:45.280]  so people are seeing through the left right paradigm if Larry Flint can then phony right

[06:08.240 --> 06:16.960]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network we are live thank you for joining us it is Sunday
[06:16.960 --> 06:25.040]  edition 23rd day of August 2009 President Barack Obama has the lowest approval rating
[06:25.040 --> 06:32.880]  of any president in US history 8 months into his administration we're now 8 months and
[06:32.880 --> 06:39.040]  2 days in he has the lowest ever and he's dropping faster and faster and faster and
[06:39.040 --> 06:49.440]  faster he has a full a full 4 points under what Jimmy Carter the previous title holder
[06:49.440 --> 06:56.320]  had this according to Rasmussen similar numbers out of Gallup similar numbers out of Zogby
[06:56.320 --> 07:04.440]  this guy is a political nightmare he is a political implosion because the hype was
[07:04.440 --> 07:11.000]  just messianic he was our Lord he was our savior he was the one he was like Jesus the
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.520]  media said he was going to save us he was the world's president it just went on and
[07:16.520 --> 07:23.480]  on we covered my film the Obama deception but here is the danger he may be politically
[07:23.480 --> 07:29.840]  wounded but he's extremely dangerous because the people controlling him know that when
[07:29.840 --> 07:34.600]  his agenda became public his approval ratings would implode that's what what a week after
[07:34.600 --> 07:42.440]  he was elected vice president Biden vice president elect was out on the west coast and he was
[07:42.440 --> 07:46.920]  talking to their big you know half a million dollar donors their biggest donors in a closed
[07:46.920 --> 07:51.320]  door meeting but somebody recorded it on their iPhone and we played the clip many times he
[07:51.320 --> 07:56.160]  said look six seven eight months in he's going to be hated because of our policies he's going
[07:56.160 --> 07:59.960]  to be hated but you've got to stick with us you know you're the insiders don't worry
[07:59.960 --> 08:05.400]  you're going to get paid off with the taxpayer money and we're going to have a crisis coming
[08:05.400 --> 08:10.880]  so they're going to stage a crisis and it could be a new war as the ran corporation
[08:10.880 --> 08:15.280]  is calling for it could be this bird flu as the governors are saying and his congressmen
[08:15.280 --> 08:19.520]  are saying from congressman Brown to former congressman Dick army are saying they may
[08:19.520 --> 08:25.520]  use this flu as a pretext to get his agenda through I mean when you've got the governor's
[08:25.520 --> 08:29.640]  association writing letters saying we don't want martial law to the White House when
[08:29.640 --> 08:34.400]  you've got major members of congressman Ron Paul congressman Brown and others the good
[08:34.400 --> 08:41.280]  news is at least people are getting the game of stage crisis he got Michael Savage on four
[08:41.280 --> 08:45.800]  hundred and some radio stations third biggest show in the country coming out every week
[08:45.800 --> 08:50.480]  and saying Obama's going to blow up buildings like Hitler did with the Reichstag to bring
[08:50.480 --> 08:58.400]  in martial law I mean this is exciting in fact I want to come in the so-called right
[08:58.400 --> 09:04.680]  wing in this country for finally waking up the left woke up to bus staging terror congress
[09:04.680 --> 09:09.520]  now has an eleven percent approval rating it had gone up to about twenty depending on
[09:09.520 --> 09:13.840]  the poll nineteen to twenty two depending on the poll when Obama got elected there was
[09:13.840 --> 09:21.360]  this fresh wave of euphoria thinking that okay maybe things will change but people figured
[09:21.360 --> 09:26.640]  out real quick same scam just a new slicker version reading off a teleprompter in a five
[09:26.640 --> 09:34.240]  thousand dollar suit Harvard educated you know with the you know sweet sweet eyes you
[09:34.240 --> 09:41.120]  can believe those are lying eyes though ladies and gentlemen like the Elvis song walks like
[09:41.120 --> 09:47.520]  an angel talks like an angel but is the devil in disguise in fact let's cue that up I know
[09:47.520 --> 09:53.480]  we've got that but let's play that sometime during the show today she walks like an angel
[09:53.480 --> 10:02.680]  talks like an angel but I got wise oh she's a devil in disguise oh yes you are devil in
[10:02.680 --> 10:10.120]  disguise I'm sorry I'm really putting shame to Elvis he just had his his anniversary of
[10:10.120 --> 10:16.640]  his death last week I was a two weeks ago I forget but I'm addicted to the Elvis channel
[10:16.640 --> 10:23.280]  on serious I'm sorry it's problem I have so we've got that going on I want to discuss
[10:23.280 --> 10:28.400]  that with the listeners because don't think the establishment spent over a billion dollars
[10:28.400 --> 10:32.520]  putting him into office that's right over a billion bucks McCain raised over five hundred
[10:32.520 --> 10:39.400]  mill I mean he got Obama just from Wall Street got four plus it's almost five times the money
[10:39.400 --> 10:45.200]  that McCain got I'm not saying vote for McCain is like a Don King fight McCain was taking
[10:45.200 --> 10:52.280]  a dive what do you think putting that dingbat Palin in there was meant to do and the the
[10:52.280 --> 10:58.240]  advisors she's got are definitely on globalist payroll telling her to quit the governorship
[10:58.240 --> 11:04.120]  that destroyed her political future but that that doesn't matter the issue that I'm trying
[11:04.120 --> 11:11.160]  to cover here is that we we told everybody it was essential to show him as a fraud and
[11:11.160 --> 11:16.040]  a liar because they were building him up as this messianic savior they hope the public
[11:16.040 --> 11:23.000]  wouldn't get wise but their better political brains all said that the people get wise within
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.520]  a year their their their top brains knows had six to eight months and they were right
[11:30.520 --> 11:35.560]  and they said we need a crisis to resell him so what is that stage crisis going to be I
[11:35.560 --> 11:42.200]  want to ask the listeners that in other news here in my stack they are rehyping the flu
[11:42.200 --> 11:46.320]  we're going to get into that they talk about the Miami Dolphins a bunch of them have it
[11:46.320 --> 11:51.040]  perfect way to hype this is to you know talk about how they have it when this is a mild
[11:51.040 --> 11:55.280]  flu compared to other flues again the question is why are they hyping it well governors and
[11:55.280 --> 11:59.600]  congressmen are saying as a pretext to have the whole government shut down during the
[11:59.600 --> 12:05.340]  fall so Obama composes the savior and ran through his anti gun legislation his open
[12:05.340 --> 12:09.880]  border legislation his new bank of the world legislation handing over our sovereignty
[12:09.880 --> 12:16.120]  expanding NAFTA and get the North American Union SPP his socialized health care agenda
[12:16.120 --> 12:20.880]  I want to go over some of the new versions of the bill subsection by subsection what's
[12:20.880 --> 12:27.000]  really in there but I just wanted to mention this and if I have time near the end of the
[12:27.000 --> 12:32.400]  show I'm going to play some of these newscast and get into it they are now on New York TV
[12:32.400 --> 12:39.880]  California TV Texas television reporting like it's the end of the world with my Joker my
[12:39.880 --> 12:47.800]  Obama Joker contest I mean they are with pinched faces like they're talking about a meteorite
[12:47.800 --> 12:52.000]  approaching the earth that will kill all life on the planet in six months I mean they are
[12:52.000 --> 12:57.200]  talking like like like the black plague has been released there they're talking like the
[12:57.200 --> 13:02.920]  end of the world has happened with grave faces about how scary it is and how frightening
[13:02.920 --> 13:08.480]  it is and how the public is scared and police are investigating and state attorney generals
[13:08.480 --> 13:14.760]  are looking at it in Florida and no one knows what to do it's so deadly scary these people
[13:14.760 --> 13:20.960]  are putting up posters with info wars dot com under Obama as the Joker and socialist and
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.560]  fascist people keep saying why do you have socialist posters why do you have fascist
[13:24.560 --> 13:29.200]  posters why do you have new world order posters because socialism fascism it's all forms
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.520]  of command and control different people it means different things okay there's different
[13:34.520 --> 13:41.160]  definitions to it I could spend 10 hours on it if you wanted to the point is it's collectivism
[13:41.160 --> 13:45.520]  and the establishment fooled you with false choices of collectivism instead of saying
[13:45.520 --> 13:49.400]  I want to be a libertarian or I want to be somebody who wants freedom I want a constitutional
[13:49.400 --> 13:56.320]  republic they confuse everybody with questions of liberal versus conservative fascist versus
[13:56.320 --> 14:02.480]  socials but but that isn't the issue here is the washington post flicker versus free
[14:02.480 --> 14:09.320]  speech where is their courage washington post there's a sydney mourning herald article
[14:09.320 --> 14:17.360]  talking about censorship in america not allowed to criticize Obama defending us meanwhile
[14:17.360 --> 14:24.080]  here's the haze county free press freedom of hate speech then it says haze county doesn't
[14:24.080 --> 14:30.880]  have laws against posting these info wars dot com obama joker posters but we need one

[15:05.920 --> 15:10.520]  the altered picture of the president was made by a college student and has since gone worldwide
[15:10.520 --> 15:15.960]  via youtube up to 20 posters were put on tree signs and windows the only message was the
[15:15.960 --> 15:21.940]  image and the website address info wars dot com that's the online site and it goes tyler

[21:31.960 --> 21:39.040]  that front coming up later in the next hour i'm also going to read in its entirety larry
[21:39.040 --> 21:44.040]  flint of all people has come out against the new world order and the democratic party saying
[21:44.040 --> 21:49.040]  both parties are controlled and obama is a new world order frontman this is a huge democratic
[21:49.040 --> 21:55.160]  supporter huge in hollywood always trying to set up republicans always trying to catch
[21:55.160 --> 22:00.280]  him you know with hookers and things he's coming out saying he understands the left
[22:00.280 --> 22:05.760]  right paradigm that it's all controlled now this is a big deal this is a big deal so i'm
[22:05.760 --> 22:11.040]  going to go over that because when larry flint's kind of a canary in the coal mine when he
[22:11.040 --> 22:15.080]  becomes nonpartisan when he finally gets it and by the way i've talked to the editor
[22:15.080 --> 22:20.520]  at hustler it's from my films our material very exciting people say why is your stuff
[22:20.520 --> 22:25.000]  published in hustler they ask we let them i mean you know whatever audience i can get
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.960]  to is the point and about three years ago i found out we want to publish your articles
[22:28.960 --> 22:33.440]  in hustler they published three of them in there so but the point is larry flint is
[22:33.440 --> 22:37.320]  now completely awake to the new world order coming out against obama will look out on
[22:37.320 --> 22:42.360]  that front uh... so uh... that said ladies and gentlemen
[22:42.360 --> 22:47.400]  i want to get into the the flu big new developments there obama's approval ready in case you haven't
[22:47.400 --> 22:48.120]  heard
[22:48.120 --> 22:50.160]  rasmussen reports
[22:50.160 --> 22:55.680]  the daily presidential tracking poll for sunday shows a twenty seven percent of the nation's
[22:55.680 --> 22:57.600]  of voters strongly approve
[22:57.600 --> 23:01.880]  of the way the barack obama's performing his role as president forty one percent strongly
[23:01.880 --> 23:03.080]  disapprove
[23:03.080 --> 23:08.140]  giving obama a presidential approval index rating of minus fourteen
[23:08.140 --> 23:13.420]  these figures mark the lowest approval index rating yet recorded for this president
[23:13.420 --> 23:18.520]  or any previous president
[23:18.520 --> 23:20.600]  this is this is just unbelievable
[23:20.600 --> 23:23.240]  i mean he was forty nine two weeks ago
[23:23.240 --> 23:24.920]  in rasmussen
[23:24.920 --> 23:26.640]  ladies and gentlemen
[23:26.640 --> 23:28.220]  george bush had a
[23:28.220 --> 23:30.400]  thirty nine percent when he left
[23:30.400 --> 23:33.400]  i mean this is again this is eight months in
[23:33.400 --> 23:34.240]  art art
[23:34.240 --> 23:37.840]  i know i've already said that it's just
[23:37.840 --> 23:42.000]  trying to explain though we've got to expose that he's a new world order frontman
[23:42.000 --> 23:46.440]  when he had power and was strong because he's pulling through their entire agenda
[23:46.440 --> 23:51.040]  of carbon taxing and global government and u n treaties in north american union
[23:51.040 --> 23:52.520]  anti-gun bills and
[23:52.520 --> 23:55.400]  hate speech bills and
[23:55.400 --> 23:57.680]  government-controlled health care
[23:57.680 --> 24:01.680]  hijacking twenty percent of the economy but he's still dangerous
[24:01.680 --> 24:05.920]  but now we've got a point out that the other parties controlled as well
[24:05.920 --> 24:09.360]  and and and both parties are going to continue to be unpopular as long as they
[24:09.360 --> 24:12.520]  continue to follow the orders of the special interests that put them in
[24:12.520 --> 24:13.200]  office
[24:13.200 --> 24:17.020]  instead of what the people want and what the bill rights and constitution states
[24:17.020 --> 24:19.840]  so this isn't over they'll just put a new pop it in
[24:19.840 --> 24:23.160]  and people find out they're bad and another pop another pop it and that's
[24:23.160 --> 24:25.160]  why this country's going into revolution
[24:25.160 --> 24:28.320]  people are finally getting it no matter who they put in
[24:28.320 --> 24:31.080]  i mean previously it took years for people to find out
[24:31.080 --> 24:34.600]  a president was scamming now they find out six seven eight months
[24:34.600 --> 24:37.080]  the jigs up folks in the information age

[25:12.000 --> 25:14.200]  during their vacation
[25:14.200 --> 25:16.560]  uh... one of many

[25:25.920 --> 25:29.160]  it's either from health and services over to the control

[25:35.320 --> 25:36.560]  uh...
[25:36.560 --> 25:39.440]  but that's what i think what you're going to have a good deal with
[25:39.440 --> 25:41.360]  it though and it
[25:41.360 --> 25:42.960]  all talk about epidemic
[25:42.960 --> 25:45.600]  epidemic pandemic epidemic pandemic
[25:45.600 --> 25:47.640]  they've got this thing playing
[25:47.640 --> 25:51.160]  but this is no secret for them there are there and uh... and uh...
[25:51.160 --> 25:53.800]  but i don't know what the other we can replayed it
[25:53.800 --> 25:55.440]  and what you said is
[25:55.440 --> 25:59.200]  i thought about uh... well we need to pay her to take control of everything
[25:59.200 --> 26:01.880]  make sure that they want her children blah blah blah
[26:01.880 --> 26:02.960]  and then he says
[26:02.960 --> 26:04.480]  and we're working along with it
[26:04.480 --> 26:06.320]  with the department of defense
[26:06.320 --> 26:11.280]  and you know what that means that's that's that's a code for military
[26:11.280 --> 26:15.920]  well why it why it why it there's no code why it there's no code about it
[26:15.920 --> 26:19.880]  the pentagon has gone to congress and said we want funding additional for
[26:19.880 --> 26:24.840]  four hundred thousand regular army and marines to patrol america to fight
[26:24.840 --> 26:25.840]  terrorism
[26:25.840 --> 26:29.080]  i mean this is associated press the hill
[26:29.080 --> 26:32.040]  this is all mainstream news and yes that's the point
[26:32.040 --> 26:33.120]  for listeners
[26:33.120 --> 26:35.960]  and and new listeners that don't study how government works
[26:35.960 --> 26:38.080]  we said in january
[26:38.080 --> 26:41.760]  that they were building mass graves getting ready for martial law training
[26:41.760 --> 26:46.160]  local emergency managers and police that this was coming in the fall
[26:46.160 --> 26:47.240]  ten months later
[26:47.240 --> 26:50.520]  i went on air did show after show
[26:50.520 --> 26:53.960]  we correctly said and i'm not to do or horn i'm saying
[26:53.960 --> 26:56.400]  because it's obvious it's out in the open
[26:56.400 --> 26:59.280]  uh... april was just a fear-mongering
[26:59.280 --> 27:02.760]  the priming the non-event two or three dat americans
[27:02.760 --> 27:07.440]  uh... two so people wouldn't notice how obvious it was that they were building
[27:07.440 --> 27:09.200]  up making the vaccine
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.080]  openly coming out with announcements about forced inoculations and army on
[27:13.080 --> 27:14.040]  the streets
[27:14.040 --> 27:18.040]  so that was the the smokescreen for them to go public and you're right they
[27:18.040 --> 27:19.240]  are gearing up
[27:19.240 --> 27:23.520]  like that any congressman governors are saying what you're saying why it
[27:23.520 --> 27:28.200]  this is what i think i don't know if i don't know what i want to hear
[27:28.200 --> 27:30.920]  what i think
[27:30.920 --> 27:34.680]  what you said what you didn't know if you said department of defense
[27:34.680 --> 27:35.960]  that's what i think
[27:35.960 --> 27:38.720]  she's using exactly that's it right
[27:38.720 --> 27:40.720]  so i don't know if i think what i think

[28:00.560 --> 28:03.040]  and make it about that's right

[33:31.080 --> 33:35.240]  moment I did want to go to the Washington Post this was from Friday
[33:35.240 --> 33:43.600]  August 21st Ridge fellow cabinet members pushed terror alerts former
[33:43.600 --> 33:48.800]  Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge says pressure from fellow cabinet members
[33:48.800 --> 33:53.760]  to raise the nation's terror alert level just before the 2004 presidential
[33:53.760 --> 33:58.480]  election helped convince him it was time to quit working for President George
[33:58.480 --> 34:04.240]  W. Bush in a new book Ridge says that despite the urgings of former Defense
[34:04.240 --> 34:07.400]  Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and then Attorney General John Ashcroft he
[34:07.400 --> 34:11.760]  objected to raising the security level according to publicity released for the
[34:11.760 --> 34:17.240]  book's publisher and see that's a spin why did the owner of the World Trade
[34:17.240 --> 34:21.360]  Center or the leaseholder Larry Silverstein go on PBS right after 9-11
[34:21.360 --> 34:25.840]  and say that they had controlled demolition to building seven because he
[34:25.840 --> 34:29.480]  knew that police and firemen were speaking out about it and see now when
[34:29.480 --> 34:33.920]  it comes out he's just like well I told you we blew it up why do you think Ari
[34:33.920 --> 34:42.320]  Fleischer in 2003 and 2004 both was in the AP saying oh yeah we issue these all
[34:42.320 --> 34:47.360]  the time for political purposes or whenever there's a scandal he did that
[34:47.360 --> 34:51.200]  so he wouldn't be criminally charged down the road that's why these guys just
[34:51.200 --> 34:54.800]  come out like it's no big deal like yeah I beat my wife what's the big deal or
[34:54.800 --> 34:59.840]  you know it's it's it's hiding it in plain view and that's why Ashcroft's
[34:59.840 --> 35:03.880]  coming out now saying oh I didn't like issuing fake terror alerts and I didn't
[35:03.880 --> 35:07.240]  like the warrantless wiretapping that's illegal on the American people and then
[35:07.240 --> 35:11.320]  as soon as they pass a congressional law making it retroactively legal now he
[35:11.320 --> 35:15.520]  comes out and says he loves it these guys know they committed all these crimes
[35:15.520 --> 35:23.560]  had nothing to do with keeping you safe homeland security in 2008 issued the DHS
[35:23.560 --> 35:29.080]  report we broke in 2009 it wasn't Barack Obama saying gun owners and veterans of
[35:29.080 --> 35:36.160]  the number one terror threat oh he likes it he he reissued it no this is unified
[35:36.160 --> 35:42.160]  these political parties have the same agenda just different ways of packaging
[35:42.160 --> 35:45.400]  what they're doing they're nothing but corporate frontmen for this offshore
[35:45.400 --> 35:50.960]  corporate banking takeover look I told you five years ago we had guest on we
[35:50.960 --> 35:55.240]  had reporters about blackwater running hit teams all over the world Israel
[35:55.240 --> 35:59.800]  Bragg and her Ritz and Jerusalem Post they had hit teams in the US killing US
[35:59.800 --> 36:04.480]  citizens it wasn't like I was breaking some big news now it's an AP it's in
[36:04.480 --> 36:10.320]  Reuters unwritten CIA death contract awarded to blackwater here's another
[36:10.320 --> 36:17.040]  one report CIA hired blackwater contractors for secret hit squad
[36:17.040 --> 36:21.600]  totally illegal but see they spent two months ago we told you this was coming
[36:21.600 --> 36:26.200]  out and we told you they were gonna lie and say oh it was only hit teams to kill
[36:26.200 --> 36:33.280]  al-qaeda it wasn't illegal to kill al-qaeda suppose it al-qaeda they're
[36:33.280 --> 36:37.200]  lying when you actually read the what Panetta told Congress and what's now
[36:37.200 --> 36:41.640]  admitted it was killing political enemies it was killing people in foreign
[36:41.640 --> 36:46.120]  governments it was killing corporate people remember the Merck article in ABC
[36:46.120 --> 36:49.840]  news where Merck got caught in federal court quote hiring seek and destroy hit
[36:49.840 --> 36:54.160]  teams and they didn't say what those hit teams meant and Merck said oh we mean
[36:54.160 --> 37:00.080]  just figuratively send hit teams to your house folks every major fortune 100 has
[37:00.080 --> 37:04.200]  private hit teams okay this is how the world works now why don't they kill me
[37:04.200 --> 37:08.640]  because they don't want to highlight everything I'm saying because we lay it
[37:08.640 --> 37:14.440]  all out we know exactly how their program works all we do is study this oh
[37:14.440 --> 37:20.560]  my gosh and if you think of any of this has stopped under Obama you've got
[37:20.560 --> 37:27.040]  another thing coming okay wake up we have corruption running rampant homeland

[39:08.280 --> 39:13.080]  policy and that is to sterilize you to the food and water and you better
[39:13.080 --> 39:16.760]  believe it when you tell people it makes the rats not have basically have
[39:16.760 --> 39:20.680]  testicles it shrivels them down to nothing when you tell them that 50
[39:20.680 --> 39:24.960]  plus percent of corn syrup products have high levels of mercury for no reason
[39:24.960 --> 39:28.720]  it's not even the manufacturing it's being added when you tell people that

[47:39.680 --> 47:48.160]  article I entitled gun propaganda and the healthcare reform illusion you
[47:48.160 --> 47:53.160]  posted today on your site and yes I'm the one that I'm the person that posted it
[47:53.160 --> 47:58.560]  a few hours ago I thought it was good article thank you the two previous
[47:58.560 --> 48:02.460]  articles that I wrote about that were about also about the healthcare reform
[48:02.460 --> 48:11.720]  issue and they were reflecting my opinion that the the legislators in
[48:11.720 --> 48:17.280]  Washington DC need to read their bills before they even vote on them well
[48:17.280 --> 48:21.040]  that's the thing the healthcare bill does have that the feds access your bank
[48:21.040 --> 48:24.400]  accounts whenever they want it does have they surveil you it's the same stuff in
[48:24.400 --> 48:28.240]  Europe it's a carbon copy what they have in the continent in Europe even worse
[48:28.240 --> 48:33.000]  than England almost what they have in Finland it's got all this anti gun
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.760]  where the pediatricians and the doctors won't treat you of your own guns in the
[48:36.760 --> 48:41.440]  house where they asked you on the gun you know we talk about death boards they
[48:41.440 --> 48:48.440]  have the bioethics boards and we know what those hospice panels have done we
[48:48.440 --> 48:53.720]  know that they withhold care we know that Obama has openly said we're gonna
[48:53.720 --> 48:57.480]  decide what care you get what you don't and then everybody said no their plan
[48:57.480 --> 49:01.520]  so then they tried to lie and they say oh no our plan doesn't say that that made
[49:01.520 --> 49:05.840]  him lose all his credibility you know it's bad enough if he comes out and
[49:05.840 --> 49:09.800]  says yeah that's my plan what's wrong with it but to lie about it and to say
[49:09.800 --> 49:14.560]  that that stuff isn't in the bill I mean I was watching CNN last night they just
[49:14.560 --> 49:18.040]  keep digging a hole deeper and deeper for themselves it's not just Obama
[49:18.040 --> 49:22.520]  crashing and burning right now it's all the media that hooks their wagon up to
[49:22.520 --> 49:28.120]  him go ahead I'm sorry yeah right he all that is in the bill I agree and then
[49:28.120 --> 49:32.640]  you'll get your congressman or your senator and you will bring something
[49:32.640 --> 49:36.760]  like that up to him and he'll go well no that's not in the bill or no I didn't
[49:36.760 --> 49:41.800]  beat the bill or it was you know it wasn't let me tell folks I have I've not
[49:41.800 --> 49:46.960]  read the five six thousand pages of three versions but I've gone through
[49:46.960 --> 49:52.560]  synopses written by different groups and I've clicked on the links to go check
[49:52.560 --> 49:57.240]  the bill in the subsection they say and I've spot checked it I've probably spent
[49:57.240 --> 50:02.200]  10 hours the last two months probably more on it and it's worse than people
[50:02.200 --> 50:06.200]  say and you know why because it gives unlimited power to the feds to do
[50:06.200 --> 50:11.360]  whatever they want and it federalizes health care it gets federal control over
[50:11.360 --> 50:16.840]  it and you talk about camel's nose under the tent flap go ahead yeah and see it
[50:16.840 --> 50:22.240]  takes people like you and your normal guy going up up to the these town hall
[50:22.240 --> 50:26.840]  meetings they have read the bills their own legislators have not read these
[50:26.840 --> 50:30.560]  bills or at least claim that they haven't read the bills or lie about it or a
[50:30.560 --> 50:34.520]  lot of them will say yeah I know it says your son that's got muscular disher fee
[50:34.520 --> 50:40.520]  wouldn't be covered but we're gonna take that out see some congressman like
[50:40.520 --> 50:45.120]  dingle was actually honest but then that same day the same question got brought
[50:45.120 --> 50:49.600]  up to another congressman he said that's not in there it's in there you lying
[50:49.600 --> 50:59.720]  well I agree with that I I understand that I pointed those out in articles I
[50:59.720 --> 51:04.080]  try to be very nice when I write my articles I tell folks briefly the other
[51:04.080 --> 51:09.200]  callers your articles up on screen right now at prison planet on TV folks on the
[51:09.200 --> 51:13.280]  radio it's titled gun propaganda and the health care reform allusion tell
[51:13.280 --> 51:19.280]  folks briefly that the sections or the areas that get into guns
[51:19.280 --> 51:28.640]  about the third or fourth paragraph down I talk about William who I met at the
[51:28.640 --> 51:34.160]  Liberty Forum in March and I explained that you know one of the things he said
[51:34.160 --> 51:39.680]  I'm on the interview with Chris Matthews was that his gun is for defense well
[51:39.680 --> 51:44.120]  that's what your gun is for it's not there showing force to these people it's
[51:44.120 --> 51:47.640]  not they're saying hey we're gonna come get you it's they're saying look if you
[51:47.640 --> 51:50.960]  come after us we're gonna defend ourselves absolutely I appreciate your call
[51:50.960 --> 51:54.600]  yeah there's all this knitting and hyperventilating and freaking out
[51:54.600 --> 51:58.520]  over citizens showing up in New Hampshire and Arizona we've had both
[51:58.520 --> 52:03.760]  men on both our listeners of course it's so great just no matter what the big
[52:03.760 --> 52:07.920]  news is it's our listeners that's because we have active incredible involved
[52:07.920 --> 52:12.160]  informed and they're there to break the paradigm and say my guns aren't dirty
[52:12.160 --> 52:16.920]  my guns aren't bad so that I won't have a carpet cleaner at my house again try to
[52:16.920 --> 52:21.400]  call the cops on me when he sees a shotgun in a gun rack eight years ago in
[52:21.400 --> 52:26.840]  Austin that happened to me the guy watches TV where every TV shows based in
[52:26.840 --> 52:30.160]  New York City where the cops catch you with a gun you go to jail these
[52:30.160 --> 52:34.360]  idiots on fluoride and all these drugs they believe it's illegal well we got
[52:34.360 --> 52:38.080]  to wear our guns openly so they understand they're not there's only a few
[52:38.080 --> 52:43.000]  cities Chicago New York maybe four or five others half a dozen others where you
[52:43.000 --> 52:47.040]  can't carry a firearm openly and those city rules are being overthrown as
[52:47.040 --> 52:51.680]  unconstitutional and you know why the cops supported the people in New Hampshire
[52:51.680 --> 52:58.720]  and in and in Phoenix there are more than 15 people out there with guns all
[52:58.720 --> 53:04.200]  counted now outside an Obama event because the cops aren't stupid they know
[53:04.200 --> 53:07.960]  the real gun they got to worry about is the concealed gun they know there's
[53:07.960 --> 53:12.720]  people with guns all over the place with concealed carry or carrying concealed
[53:12.720 --> 53:16.840]  illegally it's illegal to carry a gun concealed under common law that's why
[53:16.840 --> 53:21.680]  you need a permit to carry a gun concealed not one to carry it open so the
[53:21.680 --> 53:26.040]  government makes it the illusion that you can't own a gun or carry one by saying
[53:26.040 --> 53:29.240]  we'll give you a permit to have it concealed that then sets the precedent
[53:29.240 --> 53:35.920]  to only have them concealed but the issue here is we're sick of it every
[53:35.920 --> 53:40.800]  couple days I hear about some old man it's usually an old man eat clean in his
[53:40.800 --> 53:45.240]  gun in his garage it could be in Texas it could be in Vermont shameful these
[53:45.240 --> 53:49.800]  supposed Liberty states it happens to I see it in Virginia and I see it you know
[53:49.800 --> 53:54.360]  in Illinois and I see stories in Massachusetts where it happens it'll be
[53:54.360 --> 53:59.480]  man arrested for arsenal neighbor saw garage with five guns thousand rounds
[53:59.480 --> 54:04.640]  of ammo called police man and psychiatric custody to see they can't hold
[54:04.640 --> 54:07.840]  them for the guns that weren't illegal they can hold them and say we're taking
[54:07.840 --> 54:11.440]  them and saying you may be mentally ill because some chicken neck
[54:11.440 --> 54:16.520]  domesticated cowardly moron neighbor little snitch I've got all these
[54:16.520 --> 54:22.160]  newscasts pouring in from across the country right now and YouTube videos
[54:22.160 --> 54:26.120]  our listeners are shooting as they peacefully put up obama joker info
[54:26.120 --> 54:32.240]  wars dot com posters citizens run up rip them down say I'm reporting you to
[54:32.240 --> 54:36.280]  police go get the police and bring the police and the police go over everybody
[54:36.280 --> 54:40.520]  else hangs up posters then the mayor gets involved and orders the police to
[54:40.520 --> 54:43.960]  come after them the police don't want to do this you think the police want to go
[54:43.960 --> 54:48.760]  raid some old man for his legal guns but they get fired if they don't by the
[54:48.760 --> 54:53.880]  dirt bag new world order CIA police chiefs and by the way CIA's had most
[54:53.880 --> 54:57.760]  major city police chiefs under their control since the early 1960s and that's
[54:57.760 --> 55:02.200]  come out major congressional reports in the 1970s the church committee
[55:02.200 --> 55:07.000]  documented that but that's coming up later ladies and gentlemen they are
[55:07.000 --> 55:11.400]  calling for me to be arrested their international Spanish TVs calling for my
[55:11.400 --> 55:16.080]  arrest the haze county newspaper says freedom or of hate speech and says I'm
[55:16.080 --> 55:20.360]  basically a criminal I mean this is just insane but meanwhile the Washington
[55:20.360 --> 55:26.200]  Post comes out and the Sydney Morning Herald and defend us and say this is our
[55:26.200 --> 55:30.520]  first amendment and say it's wrong that flicker and Facebook are banning these
[55:30.520 --> 55:34.520]  any images criticizing Obama not just the Joker and you know why the
[55:34.520 --> 55:40.160]  establishment CIA run Washington Post is coming out defending us because they
[55:40.160 --> 55:45.920]  know this blew up in their face they know that it made everybody go crazy go
[55:45.920 --> 55:50.160]  print the posters off info wars dot com and put them up a hundred times what
[55:50.160 --> 55:56.000]  they were going to do the establishment is going what is your problem local
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.840]  branches you shouldn't have censored this and given an attention and they're
[55:59.840 --> 56:03.680]  like but we hate America we hate freedom of speech we can't wait to be turned
[56:03.680 --> 56:08.520]  loose on the people you can't let them know we're tyrants so quickly you can't
[56:08.520 --> 56:13.800]  come out and do that that only proves their point stand down if you would the
[56:13.800 --> 56:18.800]  more you suppress them this poster stuff could totally cause what Alex Jones is
[56:18.800 --> 56:24.240]  causing is calling the poster revolution stand down stop censoring the
[56:24.240 --> 56:29.200]  poster that's why all these major outlets the big top government run ones
[56:29.200 --> 56:35.120]  Washington Post admitted OSS since before the CIA that's on record just
[56:35.120 --> 56:40.680]  Google Washington Post CIA operation mockingbird they've got top editors they've
[56:40.680 --> 56:47.480]  got stuff they're putting out directly as the mouthpiece of the Washington Post
[56:47.480 --> 56:52.440]  saying do not take the posters down off the walls do not take them off the web
[56:52.440 --> 56:57.040]  and you know why because they realize ladies and gentlemen that they are
[56:57.040 --> 57:02.080]  doing exactly what I plan for them to do all along walking right into the first
[57:02.080 --> 57:07.920]  amendment trap to make tyrants act like tyrants and you just can't help it

[1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:54.040]  Shepard Ferry yeah those of you who don't know yeah he's the front man for the
[1:00:54.040 --> 1:00:59.600]  obey propaganda campaign the same guy who did the Obama Hope poster and he's the
[1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:04.520]  guy that for like a decade had Andre's got a posse that people who wonder why
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:11.000]  they see Andre the giant with the word obey that's him yeah I mean even George
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:15.400]  Orwell he taught us to be aware of the sign on the wall reading obey you know
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:21.240]  I know now he turns out he everything's communist red stars it's sold in the
[1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:26.400]  shopping malls everywhere he makes the linen-esque posters of Obama looking out
[1:01:26.400 --> 1:01:30.960]  and and again that's the phony foundation phony left rebellion the
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:34.740]  elites know the people are going to rebel against their fascist model so
[1:01:34.740 --> 1:01:38.880]  they create the socialist communist model of false rebellion to suck us into
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:42.240]  it yeah I've been studying propaganda art
[1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:46.280]  psychology society for some time now and I work for one of the largest obey
[1:01:46.280 --> 1:01:50.320]  retailers in the world and I've watched this whole Obama Cole phenomenon play out
[1:01:50.320 --> 1:01:54.440]  slowly and how they're trying to control how we think how we act in shaping the
[1:01:54.440 --> 1:01:59.560]  young public opinion mostly in politics I've been exposing shepherd fairy and
[1:01:59.560 --> 1:02:03.520]  all this plagiarized propaganda for the last two years now and trying to show
[1:02:03.520 --> 1:02:06.840]  the dumb down people that he is using the same power used by the ruling elite
[1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:11.200]  of our society giving us a mass psychology test and for those who fall
[1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:16.400]  into the trap to the propaganda the final grade is his Armageddon yeah notice
[1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:21.400]  on his site he wants everybody to print and post his crap and what I've done is
[1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:28.200]  I'm declaring war on Obama's poster teams he was in the Washington Post telling
[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:34.400]  people to stick his posters on stop signs I'm saying follow law don't do that
[1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:39.720]  notice though that's okay but so if you put up red stars and Obama and then I
[1:02:39.720 --> 1:02:45.960]  notice he sells little red brigade toys little commas are in the commas are in
[1:02:45.960 --> 1:02:52.400]  the political speech police are the good guys on his site go ahead yeah I'm a
[1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:56.440]  shepherd fairy knows the agenda and he's a frontman for it for a huge dangerous
[1:02:56.440 --> 1:02:59.760]  cold following I mean all you need all you need to do is look at his symbolism
[1:02:59.760 --> 1:03:04.200]  his obey logo is a star with a circle around it what does that remind you of
[1:03:04.200 --> 1:03:12.720]  the communist yeah or or a pentagram as well if you look at it I mean look look
[1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:15.920]  look good guys go back to the image you had on screen a minute ago that the red
[1:03:15.920 --> 1:03:20.560]  brigade commas are I mean to him his his site the commas are is are good they're
[1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:24.280]  gonna teach you how what you can say they're going because you know oh they're
[1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:31.840]  gonna teach you good oh yeah go ahead sir all of his ideas I'm sure you've
[1:03:31.840 --> 1:03:37.560]  seen John Carpenter as they live yes that's sort of where all is all of his
[1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:43.320]  foundation comes from for the obey propaganda campaign well also I see the
[1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:46.920]  death the death rune on his site most people don't know the peace symbol is
[1:03:46.920 --> 1:03:55.000]  actually the death rune or the rune rune of death the eugenics symbol all of it
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.800]  I mean shepherd fairies is a Satanist and he's working for the elite many he
[1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:05.080]  wants our minds so you said so you work for him still or you're now left his
[1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:09.760]  organization I I'm in the process of leaving the organization I still work
[1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:14.120]  for one of the largest retailers that sell his clothing line well notice how
[1:04:14.120 --> 1:04:18.120]  he was always anti-corporate and these guys that always are anti anybody
[1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:21.040]  selling their material they're libertarian but then they are the

[1:06:29.680 --> 1:06:34.760]  government to control the drug dealing until things got out of control and so
[1:06:34.760 --> 1:06:37.880]  now they're being forced to decriminalize because they know that will
[1:06:37.880 --> 1:06:42.640]  lessen the war that's going on also artificial life is only months away as
[1:06:42.640 --> 1:06:49.200]  biologist Craig vintner times of London CBS to run video ad in magazine this

[1:06:54.240 --> 1:07:01.880]  has a small chip in it that transmits through it like a TV screen the news
[1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:07.880]  articles it's 20 year old technology is now being phased in very exciting we'll
[1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:12.200]  cover some of that also more on the flu how the establishment's hyping that up

[1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:20.360]  air Cyrus Alex it's a pleasure to speak with you
[1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:24.280]  pleasure to talk to you what's on your mind today hey Alex I'm calling you
[1:07:24.280 --> 1:07:29.800]  regarding an email I sent you earlier today yesterday morning I attended a
[1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:34.960]  CDC sponsored supposing regarding the swine flu I don't know if you had a
[1:07:34.960 --> 1:07:38.560]  chance to look at that I've been getting a lot of emails and listeners have been
[1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:44.320]  sending me video of CDC federalization brainwashing meetings where they train
[1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:48.480]  everybody to go under Pentagon Department of Defense regular army control
[1:07:48.480 --> 1:07:52.120]  mass graves again we got laughed at eight months ago now it's all over the
[1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:56.600]  news the mass graves and incinerators are good and then even if the feds don't
[1:07:56.600 --> 1:08:00.400]  launch this bio attack in the fall they're setting the pretext for control
[1:08:00.400 --> 1:08:04.600]  but but tell us what you saw at this meeting well at first you'll be happy
[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:07.760]  to know a lot of people were talking about Alex Jones and there were a lot of
[1:08:07.760 --> 1:08:11.360]  really informed people about what we're going on there weren't too many people
[1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:15.960]  that were in the dark at least to attend at the meeting that I was at the meeting
[1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:19.400]  it was billed as sort of an informational meeting for the public
[1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:23.800]  but once we got there it almost immediately it seemed to me it was sort
[1:08:23.800 --> 1:08:28.080]  of a public opinion survey like a Nielsen sort of a focus group no no they're
[1:08:28.080 --> 1:08:32.440]  finding out if the slaves are gonna not notice when their kids you know have
[1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:37.360]  convulsions and Gillian's Bernice exactly correct it was a focus group down to
[1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:41.520]  the point where they gave us each electronic buttons and asked us to ask
[1:08:41.520 --> 1:08:46.040]  answer certain questions that they read to us which I didn't participate in that
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:50.960]  end of it at all but by the way we've confirmed what a caller gave us a tip
[1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:55.120]  on Friday at Boston Logan and other airports they're taking DNA samples
[1:08:55.120 --> 1:09:00.680]  scrapings off people's hands to get us ready for DNA databases that the feds
[1:09:00.680 --> 1:09:03.800]  already admit they want to make for all Americans they're taking blood from all
[1:09:03.800 --> 1:09:08.640]  babies at birth putting in any legal databases that's now mainstream news but
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:12.680]  but I just wanted to confirm before I forgot that they're using this flu thing
[1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:19.000]  this is a cover for total federal takeover go ahead the when I got there
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:22.960]  there was a woman who tried to make a point regarding something that happened
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:26.600]  in Texas apparently there's a school district down there that wants to have
[1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:30.120]  the swan you talk about this quite regularly by the way it's a school
[1:09:30.120 --> 1:09:34.480]  district down there that wants to make mandatory the swine flu vaccine before
[1:09:34.480 --> 1:09:39.440]  the children can attend school this fall and the narrator tried to shut her down
[1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:45.520]  which I jumped in right at that point and after I sort of spoke up to the
[1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:50.800]  audience it turned into a little bit of a town meeting if you will and so that
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:55.120]  nonsense stopped right from the get-go but once once that portion of the of the
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:59.520]  meeting calmed down one of the narrators came to me I guess because I was a
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:04.600]  little bit vocal and actually introduced me to both the CDC head who was a
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:10.040]  paper person not a scientist but a PR person as well as a woman from the state
[1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:16.440]  of Pennsylvania her title was director of there with of course a director of the
[1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:20.480]  office of public health for poor preparedness of Pennsylvania her name
[1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:25.920]  was Sharon Fitzgerald and I asked her directly whether Pennsylvania was a
[1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:30.560]  signature to the emergency health preparedness act which as you know was
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:35.560]  passed some time ago by the model states emergency powers act yeah yes sir and
[1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:40.000]  she wouldn't ask me directly she said she'd have to check with her with
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:44.840]  her legal department before she could answer but I well a lot of states didn't
[1:10:44.840 --> 1:10:48.760]  a lot of states didn't pass accompanying laws with the index into the federal to
[1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:53.120]  nexus in but they still have the bureaucracies that take federal money
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:56.680]  have implemented and then the feds themselves first the feds get is
[1:10:56.680 --> 1:11:02.240]  federalized then they are under UN level six the World Health Organization
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:07.720]  admittedly is running this so we're under UN control and the UN brag back in
[1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:13.240]  April this is a great for global governance one of the reasons I asked
[1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:17.240]  her about that because I had seen another meeting I think through your
[1:11:17.240 --> 1:11:21.760]  your website at info wars where a gentleman from the Department of the
[1:11:21.760 --> 1:11:26.760]  Navy who worked for the CDC had said that martial law or or wouldn't be
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:30.760]  declared nationally would be sort of up to the states to implement and it would
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:34.600]  be through that emergency health project which is which is what let's see that's
[1:11:34.600 --> 1:11:39.120]  true but it's not everything with these guys is a very slick language of lies
[1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:43.720]  to protect them liability the states have signed agreements with the feds
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:48.760]  that when the federal emergency management liaison to the state
[1:11:48.760 --> 1:11:54.760]  preparedness a directorate when they tell them to go to it the state then goes
[1:11:54.760 --> 1:12:00.520]  I I and flips the switch so it's all legalese games they're playing but yes
[1:12:00.520 --> 1:12:03.880]  that's what I've been predicting they're gonna have regional freakouts
[1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:09.280]  regional control to go look the army was out helping oh look nothing happened
[1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:11.600]  they already have the army doing drills all over the country we played those
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:16.560]  newscast played them last week so again it's all part of acclimating you know the
[1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:20.720]  troops are yeah we're on the street just for the flu or just to stop drunk
[1:12:20.720 --> 1:12:25.960]  drivers it's all to get you comfortable but then when you actually go to the
[1:12:25.960 --> 1:12:30.200]  army drills it's for gun confiscation well just two other quick points that I
[1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:34.000]  wanted to tell you that I asked her about one and she was surprised at both of
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:40.440]  one I asked her whether Pennsylvania had a plan to deputize non-doctors to give
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:44.960]  the injections and what was the definition the legal definition of
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:49.600]  deputization and she heard I carried back and forth she didn't really want to
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:53.640]  answer and finally what it what she said to me was Pennsylvania will not
[1:12:53.640 --> 1:12:56.760]  deputize because I said what are you going to death to deputize them as police
[1:12:56.760 --> 1:13:01.920]  officers sheriffs officers the court will they be able to detain me or those
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:07.760]  that don't know a bunch of states have deputized doctors and other people to
[1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:11.120]  forcibly inject that's under the model states of the emergency powers act
[1:13:11.120 --> 1:13:15.640]  that's all admitted and I don't believe her every state that we've looked at is
[1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:22.760]  deputizing emergency people and it's absolutely hellish but go ahead but I
[1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:26.320]  believe you because she did not want to answer and what it came down to after
[1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:31.480]  five minutes of her and I going back and forth and Mike having pressed the issue
[1:13:31.480 --> 1:13:36.160]  further and further each at each retort as she said Pennsylvania wouldn't use
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:40.520]  the verbiage of deputize what Pennsylvania would do was would be to
[1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:45.040]  immunize those people so that they couldn't be sued and I let that drop at
[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:52.560]  that yeah yeah the the word is give them immunity yes yeah give them immunity
[1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:59.400]  indemnifies the word indemnify she's gonna do she say indemnify no she said
[1:13:59.400 --> 1:14:02.880]  immunity she just didn't know how oh yes immunity is the same thing as an
[1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:06.960]  indemnity listen I got a job great great point video take those meetings put
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:11.000]  them up on YouTube yourself look you're gonna get nothing but lies and gobbledygook
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:16.280]  from local PR people they go to central meetings they're told what to say they go
[1:14:16.280 --> 1:14:19.880]  out and and then sell you a lot of bologna you can go directly to the

[1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:41.520]  is total martial law total forced inoculation quarantines lockdowns of
[1:14:41.520 --> 1:14:46.640]  cities now I told people that in April because I had the eyewitness reports and
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:50.800]  the documents wasn't hard it's like reading the TV guide people couldn't
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:57.080]  believe it now you've seen Fox CNN ABC CBS all saying martial law might be
[1:14:57.080 --> 1:15:01.600]  needed the army may lock down cities and forcibly inoculate you they're gonna
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:07.280]  give immunity to locals that forcibly inject you and now you see governors

[1:21:08.080 --> 1:21:12.640]  is gonna really have to stage a crises or something and I think that's gonna be
[1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:19.120]  the flu what do you think I mean it's now come out Washington Post Associated
[1:21:19.120 --> 1:21:23.320]  Press Governor Ridge had a Homeland Security said they were staging fake
[1:21:23.320 --> 1:21:28.760]  terror alerts for elections to get their approval ratings up this is the name of
[1:21:28.760 --> 1:21:36.640]  the game fellow cabinet members pushed terror alerts Washington Post if you
[1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:44.160]  don't think Obama isn't gonna stage some stuff then you need to get your head

[1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:54.760]  State you're on the air welcome hey thank you Alex God bless for what to do you
[1:21:54.760 --> 1:21:58.320]  woke me up nine months ago I just have a comment and a question
[1:21:58.320 --> 1:22:02.640]  everybody out there posting up the posters do not pass down I mean these
[1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:08.120]  Obama'soid yes they're crazy I mean I've been spit on ripped the posters ripped
[1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:12.840]  down right in the face you know and be or be informed with the facts because I've
[1:22:12.840 --> 1:22:16.880]  gotten into conversations with them and I think I've opened up a couple of their
[1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:20.520]  minds yeah I would neutralize them I would say I don't like Bush I don't like
[1:22:20.520 --> 1:22:25.240]  Bush I don't like Bush and if you say that they'll go cannot compute like Robbie
[1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:28.880]  the robot I go to YouTube Robbie the robot cannot compute with smoke cannot
[1:22:28.880 --> 1:22:33.920]  compute and left right there and I'm like you know the smoke comes out the
[1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:39.040]  ears try to explain to them let me guess that's what you've been doing and but
[1:22:39.040 --> 1:22:44.120]  but some won't listen will they it's more like especially white yuppies they
[1:22:44.120 --> 1:22:48.440]  run up with this crazy look going you're a white supremacist you know you're not
[1:22:48.440 --> 1:22:54.040]  allowed to talk about our God I'm sorry go ahead exactly exactly and you know
[1:22:54.040 --> 1:22:59.840]  what fascism is you're partaking in fascism right now by suppressing my
[1:22:59.840 --> 1:23:05.880]  criticism of the government but anyways the question was that Obama's approval
[1:23:05.880 --> 1:23:10.200]  ratings are going down and I'm just wondering if they're just gonna go
[1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:15.240]  straight into martial law and not stage a you know like a terrorist attack or
[1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:18.440]  something over in Iran or something to do with Russia or is it gonna be
[1:23:18.440 --> 1:23:23.360]  something else I don't well the Rand corporation says they want to start
[1:23:23.360 --> 1:23:26.840]  World War three with Russia and China to get us out of the new world order I
[1:23:26.840 --> 1:23:30.020]  mean to get the new world order out of this crisis they're in into the new
[1:23:30.020 --> 1:23:35.880]  world order they also talk about continuing staging an economic crisis
[1:23:35.880 --> 1:23:39.520]  but that wasn't working for them so now they're trying to get us out of this
[1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:45.440]  with a new bubble of all this fiat currency so who knows what they're
[1:23:45.440 --> 1:23:51.280]  gonna do all the forces are lined up for a giant staged flu pandemic where the
[1:23:51.280 --> 1:23:55.800]  feds will come in as saviors clamp down but then boost their approval ratings
[1:23:55.800 --> 1:23:59.320]  just because people will be happy to be alive at the end of it I don't know
[1:23:59.320 --> 1:24:02.680]  what's gonna happen but I appreciate your call in fact let me just now go
[1:24:02.680 --> 1:24:06.760]  ahead and briefly get to this then back to your calls here is the Hayes County
[1:24:06.760 --> 1:24:12.120]  press the county south of Austin the county paper freedom of hate speech and
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:19.880]  this article has our Obama fascism poster on the front our variant of it we
[1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:24.720]  also have a socialist one you've seen on the news and it says info wars calm and
[1:24:24.720 --> 1:24:28.600]  Alex Jones are doing it in the sit in the county needs to pass a law making
[1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:32.080]  it illegal because it's not illegal and they've got they found a few idiot
[1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:36.880]  citizens to go tell the paper that they think it's great to ban free speech and
[1:24:36.880 --> 1:24:43.000]  that there needs to be a law now if you go read the comments though on the 50 60
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.080]  70 a hundred I don't it's more than 50 articles I've seen I'll always look at
[1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:51.960]  the comments and nine out of ten or more say free speech it was okay to put up
[1:24:51.960 --> 1:24:56.200]  posters of Bush as a monkey or Bush is a vampire Bush is the Joker remember I
[1:24:56.200 --> 1:25:01.640]  mean in Austin Texas those were every other car why is there such a freak out
[1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:07.600]  over Obama because he is the new world order's golden boy he is the guy they're
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:12.480]  counting on getting it all done for him he was the guy that was slick the guy
[1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:15.920]  that looks like a movie star that can read right off the teleprompter you know
[1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:22.600]  better than an Academy Award-winning actor but it doesn't matter the substance
[1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:26.720]  isn't there I mean Ron Paul is not that good of a speaker but people loving
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:33.320]  because the information is true the issue is then the Washington Post comes out
[1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:39.240]  and defends the posters and defends people having them because they're even
[1:25:39.240 --> 1:25:44.000]  taking them off the web Yahoo Facebook flicker they're banning them saying
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:48.160]  they're racist and evil they banned our videos on YouTube with the posters
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:53.000]  saying racism you can't show Obama as a criminal you can't show him with
[1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.840]  horns on his head you can't show him as a devil you can't show him as a Joker
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:02.480]  because he's above that he's your new god it's a hate crime as the local paper
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:08.760]  says now here is Tyler up in northeast Texas freaking out over it and I played
[1:26:08.760 --> 1:26:12.720]  phone tag with the reporter I gave him quotes those aren't in the story and
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:18.000]  they just reported ominously like the police are out investigating and you
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:23.600]  know they're gonna well here it is posters depicting President Obama as
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:28.440]  the Joker started appearing in Tyler Texas yesterday the altered picture of
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:31.800]  the president was made by a college student and has since gone worldwide
[1:26:31.800 --> 1:26:37.640]  via YouTube up to 20 posters were put on trees signs and windows the only
[1:26:37.640 --> 1:26:43.280]  message was the website address info wars dot com that's the online site for
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:47.760]  a syndicated radio talk show host who offered $1,000 to the person who puts
[1:26:47.760 --> 1:26:52.520]  up the most obama joker posters some believe the presidential jab is hardly
[1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:56.600]  a joke Tyler police took photos and collected some of the posters as
[1:26:56.600 --> 1:27:03.320]  evidence oh my gosh the person on light poles taped them up and I don't have time
[1:27:03.320 --> 1:27:07.560]  to play and we posted them on info wars dot com on prison planet dot com where
[1:27:07.560 --> 1:27:11.720]  they are calling for my arrest I'm a racist you know they asked the guy on
[1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:17.040]  international Spanish TV all over North America they ask him why do you think
[1:27:17.040 --> 1:27:20.720]  they put him up and they said they need to arrest the person that had the idea
[1:27:20.720 --> 1:27:25.720]  for this contest he doesn't like brown people my wife speaks Spanish I had to
[1:27:25.720 --> 1:27:29.960]  drag her over to the computer and say what's he saying I mean this is
[1:27:29.960 --> 1:27:35.240]  craziness and so it's backfiring though people are going wait a minute you can't
[1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:41.960]  you can't put a poster up and again in Hays County south of where I live
[1:27:41.960 --> 1:27:46.320]  they're saying well we don't have a law against it but we're trying to pass one
[1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:52.560]  right now I mean this is so un-American this is shameful what is their problem
[1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:57.800]  you know if you live in Hays County or any of these places Miami San Francisco
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:00.960]  where they're calling for the banning of this you ought to go to city council
[1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:04.720]  even we disagree with me criticizing Obama and say look it's the first
[1:28:04.720 --> 1:28:09.520]  amendment if we ban people criticizing him it's over and everybody sees through
[1:28:09.520 --> 1:28:13.400]  this that's why I'd say nine out of ten see through this that's why the
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:16.680]  Washington Post and Sydney Morning Herald and all these big papers are
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:23.880]  coming out and saying leave it alone don't pull them down so I I'm getting a
[1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:28.560]  lot of emails a lot of videos sent to me of people putting them up in San

[1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:50.560]  yes good afternoon Alex thank you very much for taking the call quick question
[1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:55.120]  to you I'm sure a lot of you wishers would like to hear your response if you
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:38:00.320]  would please could you confirm or dispel the rumor that's been circulating
[1:38:00.320 --> 1:38:05.360]  about an upcoming bank holiday you know a lot of people like to put dates on
[1:38:05.360 --> 1:38:09.400]  things and there's every month or so people say there's a bank holiday I did
[1:38:09.400 --> 1:38:15.720]  confirm that two months ago or almost two months ago that major embassies
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:21.360]  around the world were told don't just have dollars at least two-thirds of your
[1:38:21.360 --> 1:38:28.160]  currency reserves have it in your local currency or euros or gold and then
[1:38:28.160 --> 1:38:31.600]  and then the embassies were told because there may be a dollar devaluation in the
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:35.920]  fall or winter we do see a lot of big banks going under several big ones last
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:41.000]  week we know this 23.7 trillion that's starting to hit the streets is going to
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  cause a dollar devaluation now will that bubble pop in a month or two years from
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:50.800]  now or will they somehow spin golly it into a new bubble I don't know the point
[1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:55.760]  is it's like the establishment is running around with a sparkling torch with
[1:38:55.760 --> 1:39:00.600]  embers dropping off of it in a fireworks factory with with with with black
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:05.440]  powder all over the ground so when is the factory gonna blow up I don't know
[1:39:05.440 --> 1:39:10.840]  but they're running around with burning torches inside a fireworks factory so
[1:39:10.840 --> 1:39:19.760]  your guess is as good as mine thank you sir thank you I appreciate the call Dan
[1:39:19.760 --> 1:39:26.840]  in Colorado you're on the air go ahead that was down okay still on the screen
[1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:36.840]  Philip in Canada go ahead Philip I grew up in Dallas Texas and now I'm living in
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:41.600]  Canada as an artist so it's spreading the word around up here and telling
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:45.400]  everyone about the Fed each one and one and pretty much everything that you've
[1:39:45.400 --> 1:39:49.280]  been talking about but they all kind of come to one question which is what's
[1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:55.000]  going to happen in Canada exact same exact same bull all over the Western
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:59.520]  world it's the same bureaucracies the same names the same groups the same
[1:39:59.520 --> 1:40:03.400]  global corporate takeover and and and of course it's admitted it's a world
[1:40:03.400 --> 1:40:07.320]  government run by a select few corporations but but I mean for anybody
[1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:12.280]  that won't even go research that it's the same program the same names it's all
[1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:20.080]  a global corporate parasite that sits on top of the nation states wrecking them
[1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:25.360]  because by wrecking things they can have their corporate takeovers and then
[1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:29.280]  people say well let us live under corporations these are eugenicist
[1:40:29.280 --> 1:40:33.760]  control freak Nazis so you don't want to live under their world government
[1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:39.680]  because it's an authoritarian hell system I guess more specifically about
[1:40:39.680 --> 1:40:43.880]  the swine fleet you think they're going to use that to push through the security
[1:40:43.880 --> 1:40:48.960]  and prosperity partnership yes yes as the SPP meetings in vamp Canada reported
[1:40:48.960 --> 1:40:53.320]  that are in my film in game of two years ago they said we'll use crises
[1:40:53.320 --> 1:40:59.200]  economic crises biological crises like the flu terrorist crises to bring in the
[1:40:59.200 --> 1:41:03.320]  North American Union yes okay because I haven't seen anything like the the
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:06.600]  female camps up here and I was wondering you know are they are certain
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:09.920]  that are under the Canadian and I appreciate your call under the Canadian
[1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:15.000]  top-off drills and NLE drills that they took part in national level exercise
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:21.240]  your sports stadium is the FEMA camp the local prison that's half empty is the
[1:41:21.240 --> 1:41:25.880]  FEMA camp hey the FEMA camps are all I mean they have a FEMA camp in Taylor Texas
[1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:30.080]  north of me they admit is for political dissidents now there's FEMA's website
[1:41:30.080 --> 1:41:37.680]  foreign governments 14 nations and I tell you they're getting fast on the

[1:47:45.280 --> 1:47:50.880]  it it's common since 2009 Huffington Post we got it up on info wars.com and I
[1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:54.320]  will tell you who woke this guy up and I don't agree with everything he does or
[1:47:54.320 --> 1:47:58.200]  says but he reaches a lot of people and was a big Democratic Party operative
[1:47:58.200 --> 1:48:04.080]  and that's Larry Flint the American government which was once called our
[1:48:04.080 --> 1:48:07.400]  government has been taken over by Wall Street the mega corporations and the
[1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:11.240]  super rich yes mr. Flynn it's called the New World Order but he says that later
[1:48:11.240 --> 1:48:16.600]  that's what's incredible they are the ones who decide our fate it is this group
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:20.320]  of powerful elites people which president Franklin D. Roosevelt called
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:24.440]  economic royalist who choose our elected officials indeed our very form of
[1:48:24.440 --> 1:48:28.320]  government both Democrat Republicans dance the tune of their corporate
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:34.640]  masters in America corporations do not control the government in America
[1:48:34.640 --> 1:48:39.400]  corporations are the government yeah global governance is run by private
[1:48:39.400 --> 1:48:43.320]  corporations this was never more obvious than with the Wall Street bailout
[1:48:43.320 --> 1:48:48.640]  whereby the very corporations that caused the collapse of our economy were
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:53.560]  rewarded with taxpayer dollars so arrogant so smug were they that without a
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:57.840]  moment's hesitation they took our money yours in mind to pay their executives
[1:48:57.840 --> 1:49:03.440]  multi-million dollar bonuses yeah 27 23.7 trillion Larry something they
[1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:08.000]  continue doing to this very day they have no shame they don't care what you
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:15.320]  think about them Henry Kissinger refers to us as useless eaters and again I
[1:49:15.320 --> 1:49:19.760]  happen to know the editor of hustler and they I'm again we don't try to get him
[1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:26.120]  on because I just it's interesting that Larry Flint of all people's a fan and
[1:49:26.120 --> 1:49:29.640]  now talking about eugenics the article goes into that this is I mean this is
[1:49:29.640 --> 1:49:33.600]  wild folks this is this is a big supporter the Democratic Party I mean a
[1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:41.360]  icon out there but you say we have elected a candidate of change to which I
[1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:46.200]  respond do these words of President Obama sound like change a culture
[1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:49.680]  responsibility irresponsibility took root from Wall Street to Washington to
[1:49:49.680 --> 1:49:56.400]  Main Street there it is right there we are Main Street we must accept according
[1:49:56.400 --> 1:50:03.120]  to our president share the blame he went on to say a and a regulatory regime
[1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:07.360]  basically created in the wake of the 20th century economic crisis the Great
[1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:11.960]  Depression was overwhelmed by the speed scope and sophistication of a 21st
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:17.720]  century global economy Flint goes on to say this is nonsense the reason Wall
[1:50:17.720 --> 1:50:22.680]  Street was able to game the system the way it did knowing that they would become
[1:50:22.680 --> 1:50:27.000]  rich at the expense of the American people oh yes they most certainly knew
[1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:31.920]  that was because the financial elite had bribed our legislators to roll back the
[1:50:31.920 --> 1:50:38.040]  protections enacted after the stock market crash of 1929 and that's exactly
[1:50:38.040 --> 1:50:41.320]  what happened and he goes into how Republicans and Democrats were part of
[1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:44.640]  it how Bill Clinton's the one that got rid of it and Bush went along with it
[1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:50.120]  and then Obama comes in and blames the American people Congress gutted the
[1:50:50.120 --> 1:50:53.160]  Glass-Steagall Act which separated commercial lending banks from
[1:50:53.160 --> 1:50:56.960]  investment banks and passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act which
[1:50:56.960 --> 1:51:01.920]  allowed the self-regulation with no oversight the Securities and Exchange
[1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:07.080]  Commission subsequently revisited and revised its rules to allow for even
[1:51:07.080 --> 1:51:11.960]  less oversight and we've all seen how well that worked out to date no serious
[1:51:11.960 --> 1:51:16.520]  legislation has been offered by the Obama administration to correct these
[1:51:16.520 --> 1:51:19.960]  problems instead Obama wants to increase the oversight and power the
[1:51:19.960 --> 1:51:24.440]  Federal Reserve never mind that it already had significant oversight and
[1:51:24.440 --> 1:51:30.040]  power before our most recent economic meltdown yet failed to take action well
[1:51:30.040 --> 1:51:33.920]  yeah because it's a holding company for the very same banks that did it never
[1:51:33.920 --> 1:51:38.120]  mind the Fed is not a government agency but a cartel of private bankers that
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:41.600]  cannot be held accountable by Washington whatever the Fed does with the
[1:51:41.600 --> 1:51:45.960]  supposed new oversight powers will be behind closed doors mr. Flint it's a
[1:51:45.960 --> 1:51:50.600]  new bank of the world so they can run the whole planet run these scams Obama's
[1:51:50.600 --> 1:51:55.160]  failure to act since one message loud and clear he cannot stand up to the
[1:51:55.160 --> 1:51:58.480]  powerful Wall Street interest that supplied the bulk of his campaign money
[1:51:58.480 --> 1:52:03.360]  for the 2008 election nor for that matter can Congress much the same reason
[1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:08.760]  consider what multi-billionaire banker David Rockefeller wrote in his 2002
[1:52:08.760 --> 1:52:15.440]  memoirs we cover this in truth rising some even believe we are part of a
[1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:18.600]  secret cabal working against the best interest of the United States
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:23.440]  characterizing my family and me as internationalist and of conspiring with
[1:52:23.440 --> 1:52:27.000]  others around the world to build a more integrated global political and
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:31.760]  economic structure one world if you will if that's the charge I stand guilty
[1:52:31.760 --> 1:52:36.400]  and I am proud of it just like you're proud of funding Hitler huh read Rock
[1:52:36.400 --> 1:52:41.240]  of Fellers words again he actually admits to working against the best
[1:52:41.240 --> 1:52:49.320]  interest of the United States and Larry Flint's article is now making big
[1:52:49.320 --> 1:52:56.080]  headlines around the country and he goes on having read half of it need more
[1:52:56.080 --> 1:53:01.080]  here's what Rockefeller said in 94 to UN dinner we are on the verge of a
[1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:05.120]  global transformation all we need is the right major crisis and the nations
[1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:10.400]  will accept the new world order they're gaming us our country has been stolen
[1:53:10.400 --> 1:53:16.840]  from us journalist Matt Tabby or Tabby writing and Rolling Stone notes that
[1:53:16.840 --> 1:53:23.240]  esteemed economist John Kenneth Galbraith laid the 1929 crash at the feet of
[1:53:23.240 --> 1:53:28.000]  the banking giant Goldman Sachs Taibi goes on to say that Goldman Sachs has
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:31.920]  been behind every other major economic downturn as well including the most
[1:53:31.920 --> 1:53:36.520]  recent one as if that wasn't enough Goldman Sachs even had a hand in pushing
[1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:40.920]  gas prices up to pass four dollars a gallon the problem with the bankers is
[1:53:40.920 --> 1:53:44.680]  long-standing here's what one of our founding fathers Thomas Jefferson had
[1:53:44.680 --> 1:53:47.680]  to say about them before I read the Thomas Jefferson quote I want to read
[1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:54.880]  the Taibi quote this Matt Taibi guy wrote a book attacking me and others
[1:53:54.880 --> 1:53:59.400]  about the new world order a few years ago and then now acts like he he's the
[1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:03.760]  leader of us but kind of white washes it so he's kind of like the Glenn Beck of
[1:54:03.760 --> 1:54:08.760]  the left watch out for him the problem with bankers is long-standing here's
[1:54:08.760 --> 1:54:11.800]  what one of our founding fathers Thomas Jefferson to say about him if the
[1:54:11.800 --> 1:54:15.320]  American people ever allow private banks to control the issuance of their
[1:54:15.320 --> 1:54:18.960]  currency first blank inflation and then by deflation the banks and the
[1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:23.160]  corporations that will grow up around them will just deprive the people of all
[1:54:23.160 --> 1:54:27.320]  property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers
[1:54:27.320 --> 1:54:33.360]  conquered and then it goes on we all know that the first American revolution
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:38.280]  officially began in 1776 with the Declaration of Independence less well
[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:42.920]  known as the single strongest motivating factor for revolution was the colonists
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:46.920]  attempt to free themselves from the Bank of England but how many of you know
[1:54:46.920 --> 1:54:51.520]  that the second revolution referred to as by historians as the Shays rebellion
[1:54:51.520 --> 1:54:57.480]  it took place in 1886 1887 and once again the banks were the cause because
[1:54:57.480 --> 1:55:01.640]  they make up fiat money and buy everything up and send mercenaries they
[1:55:01.640 --> 1:55:05.880]  hire to throw you out of your house continuing with when he has to say this
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:10.360]  time they were putting the screws to America's farmers Daniel Shays was the
[1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:14.640]  farmer in western Massachusetts like many other farmers of the day he was being
[1:55:14.640 --> 1:55:18.880]  driven into bankruptcy by the bankers predatory lending practices sounds
[1:55:18.880 --> 1:55:24.640]  familiar rallying other farmers to his side Shays led his rebels in an attack
[1:55:24.640 --> 1:55:28.920]  on the courts and the local armory the rebellion itself failed but the message
[1:55:28.920 --> 1:55:32.080]  had been sent the bankers and the politicians who supported them
[1:55:32.080 --> 1:55:36.600]  ultimately backed off as Thomas Jefferson famously quipped in regard to the
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:40.320]  insurrection a little rebellion now and then is a good thing the Tree of
[1:55:40.320 --> 1:55:44.340]  Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and
[1:55:44.340 --> 1:55:47.800]  tyrants and that's the same thing happened at the Alamo they killed those
[1:55:47.800 --> 1:55:52.080]  hundred and eighty six people but out of that came the victory for the state and
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:57.000]  the freedom we enjoy today over that despotism Mexico and they could smash
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:01.640]  me flattered in a pancake it only makes us rise up like a phoenix a thousand
[1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:05.800]  times stronger and that's why they're now asking their minions not to pull down
[1:56:05.800 --> 1:56:11.760]  our Obama posters nationwide because it's blowing up in their face that's
[1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:15.240]  why I'm not worried my children my grandchildren my great-grandchildren
[1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:19.920]  your children are what matters to me I understand posterity I understand life
[1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:24.520]  is but a twinkling of an eye and it's our species and our people and ideas and
[1:56:24.520 --> 1:56:32.120]  values that have true value and that will do anything to protect those that's
[1:56:32.120 --> 1:56:36.240]  why we cannot lose all their North com the army massed against us the troops
[1:56:36.240 --> 1:56:40.520]  are waking up the number one support they give us for Ron Paul the police are
[1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:44.160]  waking up we don't have to be at each other's throats these offshore bankers
[1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:47.880]  have almost got full control they've almost fully bankrupted this by design
[1:56:47.880 --> 1:56:52.400]  so they can pose as the saviors we've got to stand up and say no to them we can
[1:56:52.400 --> 1:56:56.160]  stand up and be heard we can stand up and go past black white liberal
[1:56:56.160 --> 1:57:01.240]  conservative Hispanic Asian white whatever Catholic Protestant we can
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:04.880]  come together doesn't matter what religion what creed and say we want
[1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:09.200]  liberty we want freedom we don't want foreign offshore banks creating tens of
[1:57:09.200 --> 1:57:15.240]  trillions in fiat made up currency to buy off the planet and bankrupt us because
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:20.240]  the fiat money they create we've got to pay them for the right to use it you
[1:57:20.240 --> 1:57:25.680]  understand that we have to pay them for the money that we gave them we become
[1:57:25.680 --> 1:57:31.800]  their slaves in payment to make them king the article goes on just go to info
