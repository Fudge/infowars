[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.440 --> 00:09.440]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.480 --> 00:17.480]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:24.560 --> 00:27.680]  It's the day of the big game
[00:27.680 --> 00:33.800]  And during the big game Super Bowl 2013
[00:35.800 --> 00:42.200]  From the season of 2012 technically Super Bowl 2012 we are going to be
[00:42.880 --> 00:46.060]  brainwashed by ads against the Second Amendment
[00:47.240 --> 00:51.280]  financed by the globalists and other collaborators against our liberty and the
[00:52.440 --> 00:53.680]  exploited
[00:53.680 --> 00:56.240]  children of Sandy Hook survivors
[00:56.240 --> 00:58.240]  with their choir
[00:58.560 --> 01:02.600]  to tear jerk and demonize the second amendment on
[01:03.880 --> 01:06.880]  believably opportunistic and disgusting but
[01:07.520 --> 01:12.840]  Don't ever expect the criminals that run this system to not be opportunistic and over the top
[01:12.920 --> 01:18.640]  They think you are stupid. They think you are utterly and totally mindless
[01:18.840 --> 01:21.560]  They think there's nothing you won't buy
[01:21.560 --> 01:25.600]  We're going to be going over the latest on the second amendment today
[01:26.480 --> 01:34.280]  But there is an article out of Forbes. It's excellent that we have linked up at info wars calm and prison planet calm
[01:34.280 --> 01:42.720]  It's also I found it at drudge report calm on the left hand side in all array winning the influence battle over gun control
[01:42.720 --> 01:49.160]  And I don't just believe polls when I hear them or see them. I've studied polls. I've studied statistics
[01:49.160 --> 01:57.960]  I've studied how they work and I'm able to gauge polls over a long period of time from what I read in quasi internal government white papers
[01:58.880 --> 02:03.120]  Plus what I see on the streets and this told me what I already knew
[02:03.120 --> 02:06.600]  They went to one of the biggest and most respected data mining companies
[02:06.600 --> 02:10.960]  and that's really the polling agency of the future and found that it is a
[02:11.520 --> 02:13.520]  total route of
[02:13.520 --> 02:19.480]  The anti gunners the victim disarmament a kleptocratic crowd that wants to disarm their quarry
[02:20.440 --> 02:26.400]  In fact, they find with military precision organically individual gun owners
[02:27.520 --> 02:29.520]  supported through the
[02:29.960 --> 02:34.080]  NRA that we've taken control of it. It was under globalist control about 20 years ago
[02:34.080 --> 02:40.960]  There's there's no doubt Larry Pratt agrees with me that that with laser military laser like focus is the quote
[02:40.960 --> 02:46.360]  That we are annihilating the enemy now that that that's a big plus
[02:46.360 --> 02:52.720]  And it's because we realize they're an enemy a deceptive group who don't want to take guns to keep kids safe
[02:52.920 --> 02:58.720]  Don't want to register guns to actually stop criminals. They want to target the American people
[02:58.920 --> 03:04.640]  We've seen them take the guns in any city the globalist during control of we've seen them disarm people in more than
[03:04.880 --> 03:10.040]  30 something nations the last 50 years or so. We know their game plan. We know their program
[03:10.040 --> 03:12.040]  We know how it works
[03:12.560 --> 03:15.760]  And because one of the last countries to hold out like Switzerland
[03:15.800 --> 03:20.640]  We've we've gotten to have front row seats to all the tricks and the globalist are global
[03:20.640 --> 03:23.640]  They run the same program the same plays
[03:24.160 --> 03:28.360]  They switch them up a little bit, but it's basically the same playbook in country after country
[03:28.360 --> 03:32.200]  They try to take over and not just on guns when they go for the guns
[03:32.600 --> 03:38.440]  It means they're insecure and they're afraid of politically that they're not going to get away with what they've done
[03:38.440 --> 03:44.320]  And and it means they want to use authoritarianism on the public now that said we're gonna be getting into that
[03:44.520 --> 03:46.520]  we're gonna be getting into an
[03:47.080 --> 03:54.160]  Amazing report up at info wars calm that ties into like seven other links just in the article that Kurt Nemo did and
[03:54.360 --> 03:57.600]  I was even able to find some more. We're gonna play some of these clips coming up
[03:58.400 --> 04:00.400]  Reverend Jesse Jackson
[04:00.880 --> 04:02.720]  To rip off Rush Limbaugh's
[04:02.720 --> 04:09.360]  He says it but well, that's how Reverend Jackson always says it the Reverend Jesse Jackson
[04:10.080 --> 04:14.520]  Says gun supporters are domestic terrorist. I shouldn't laugh
[04:15.720 --> 04:22.400]  There was a video saying on the on the comments and info wars calm right for showtime like ten minutes for air
[04:22.400 --> 04:24.400]  I laugh so hard. I can hardly go on air
[04:25.280 --> 04:28.320]  You ever laugh so hard it you know makes you start coughing and you can't quit
[04:28.320 --> 04:36.240]  It said Jesse Jackson responds to info wars calm and I thought well, let me put that let me put that YouTube URL in
[04:36.640 --> 04:39.280]  And it was chunk from the goonies
[04:40.480 --> 04:42.480]  And then I realized that actually
[04:43.000 --> 04:46.760]  There is a resemblance to Jesse Jackson. I couldn't believe that
[04:46.760 --> 04:56.760]  Oh my gosh, he's the black chunk
[04:59.120 --> 05:02.440]  You prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms
[05:02.520 --> 05:08.320]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection
[05:08.560 --> 05:14.000]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders check out simply safe
[05:14.000 --> 05:20.880]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless. Go to get simply safe calm
[05:21.400 --> 05:28.120]  Simply safe is independent and off the grid. It runs on battery power. So even if the grid goes down, you're protected
[05:28.240 --> 05:36.800]  It's completely customizable so you can use it in your home business boat trailer storage unit or shed get simply safe calm
[05:37.480 --> 05:41.880]  Simply safe is also ridiculously easy to install yourself in under 20 minutes
[05:41.880 --> 05:46.520]  So there's no need to let a stranger into your home if you move or need to relocate
[05:46.520 --> 05:48.520]  You can take the system with you wherever you go
[05:48.680 --> 05:55.440]  You aren't always at home, but simply safe will stand guard protecting your property 24 hours a day seven days a week
[05:55.840 --> 05:58.200]  Again, that's get simply safe calm
[05:58.200 --> 06:10.440]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[06:10.440 --> 06:12.440]  No
[06:27.160 --> 06:29.160]  Nobody rides for free
[06:30.840 --> 06:38.640]  The globalist are not going to make our servicemen women mainly men serve two three four five six seven eight nine
[06:38.640 --> 06:44.160]  Tours in the last 12 years and not have massive suicides
[06:45.120 --> 06:46.480]  massive
[06:46.480 --> 06:50.600]  mental problems massive health problems as well
[06:50.600 --> 06:53.920]  Did you know that they make US military personnel?
[06:53.920 --> 07:01.320]  You can look this up go into combat and force them back into combat when they've had legs blown off. Oh, you didn't know that
[07:01.800 --> 07:04.520]  Thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen. It is
[07:04.520 --> 07:08.680]  Sunday Sunday the third day of
[07:09.480 --> 07:11.480]  February
[07:11.720 --> 07:19.520]  2013 I am Alex Jones your syndicated radio talk show host and I am very very thankful that you have joined us today
[07:21.120 --> 07:27.600]  Wow, where to begin number one, there's new numbers out new numbers out 22
[07:28.560 --> 07:32.960]  Servicemen and women commit suicide every single day
[07:32.960 --> 07:41.720]  That is more than seven times the previous record from the end of the Vietnam War in 1973 74 75
[07:41.880 --> 07:47.000]  When they had bad suicides that is 20 to military veterans commit suicide
[07:48.040 --> 07:53.160]  Every day and I want you to know they're going to talk about the veterans and talk about how great they are and talk about how
[07:53.160 --> 07:59.960]  They love them and and try to connect the veterans and their valor and their their heroism in many cases
[07:59.960 --> 08:07.080]  To the establishment and the criminals that run our government from both political parties and the whole police state
[08:07.080 --> 08:12.640]  They're setting up and even though a lot of these wars have been fraudulent and wrong and have been done for globalist interest
[08:13.280 --> 08:19.000]  Still the men and women of the military that I've met that I know that I've talked to and I've researched
[08:19.160 --> 08:22.880]  they are the most focused awake people out there and
[08:23.720 --> 08:27.920]  They joined because they wanted to defend this Republic
[08:27.920 --> 08:34.800]  And I am sick of all the fake patriotism of oh, thank you for your service to the you know to the country
[08:34.800 --> 08:39.240]  And then okay. Well, can I have a job? Oh, I got to go. I got to go
[08:39.440 --> 08:46.440]  There is a demonization program going on behind the scenes against veterans that's now busting out into the surface
[08:46.440 --> 08:47.440]  and
[08:47.440 --> 08:54.520]  There is a public cover that all the government the media and the system loves veterans
[08:54.520 --> 08:58.520]  There's a lot of charities out there that have been caught raising money for veterans
[08:58.520 --> 09:00.520]  it really doesn't go to the veterans and
[09:00.520 --> 09:05.280]  So I just wanted to mention up front today that we're going to see lots of stuff tonight at the Super Bowl
[09:06.000 --> 09:13.320]  Connecting football and mom and apple pie, you know to the veterans and and and trying to make the political system look good
[09:13.320 --> 09:19.600]  They want you to have the memory of America and the Republic and the Bill of Rights and Constitution that our troops reportedly
[09:20.080 --> 09:21.960]  protect
[09:21.960 --> 09:25.840]  While they dismantle the entire thing in the background
[09:27.200 --> 09:30.920]  While they go to combat ground robots not just drones in the air
[09:31.560 --> 09:36.240]  Humans the globalists believe the ruling technocratic class are obsolete
[09:36.720 --> 09:40.560]  We are not obsolete the tyrants are obsolete the old
[09:41.200 --> 09:42.120]  oligarchal
[09:42.120 --> 09:49.080]  Systems of control that have pledged humanity in every civilization in every culture for more than 6,000 years are obsolete
[09:49.080 --> 09:53.800]  We either end this this system of dumbing down the public and
[09:54.120 --> 10:01.120]  Of playing groups off against each other and Balkanization and divide and conquer or humanity isn't going to make it
[10:02.320 --> 10:06.360]  All right, we got a big broadcast lined up for you again
[10:06.360 --> 10:13.360]  I'm live here on the all holy day of Super Bowl Super Bowl Sunday, and I'm here because
[10:13.360 --> 10:20.600]  Football is not America football is not freedom football is a game that has been turned into nothing
[10:20.600 --> 10:26.320]  But a giant propaganda arm of the globalist and you're going to see ads paid for by the billionaire
[10:26.320 --> 10:33.360]  Bloomberg who got his money from insider operations on the stock exchange the gangsters got armed guards and helicopters and the rest
[10:33.360 --> 10:40.200]  Of it who flies above us. He is sponsoring. He's the main guy giving money to mayors against gun violence like the guns did it
[10:40.200 --> 10:43.880]  Themselves and we're going to play this ad coming up. He's running an ad
[10:43.880 --> 10:51.080]  There's other ads and they're and they're trying to get donations out there to create an anti-gun anti-second amendment move
[10:51.640 --> 10:53.640]  Across the country. They're going to have
[10:54.000 --> 11:00.240]  The little children of Sandy Hook from the choir are being exploited by the globalist mafia
[11:00.240 --> 11:05.000]  They're going to be singing during the halftime. This is this is something I personally
[11:05.000 --> 11:09.880]  personally in boycotting our country's in deep trouble folks and
[11:10.640 --> 11:17.200]  I hear all these other talk show hosts about man. The good thing about being America's Super Bowl. I'm going to savor this big game
[11:17.200 --> 11:23.000]  I'm gonna I want my bill of rights and Constitution. I want my factories back. I want my jobs back
[11:23.000 --> 11:27.520]  I don't want the government shutting down our power plants while China builds three new ones a week
[11:27.520 --> 11:32.880]  I think going into depression is a bad thing. I'm not watching games. I'm defending my
[11:32.880 --> 11:39.920]  Constitutional Republic on this Sunday broadcast and I'm not I don't need to be thanked for coming in on a Sunday
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.320]  It's an honor to be here. It's an honor to be on the radio six days a week
[11:44.840 --> 11:46.840]  Broadcasting all over the world
[11:47.480 --> 11:54.260]  Warning not just the United States, but the planet about the global private crime syndicate known as the New World Order
[11:54.320 --> 11:59.120]  Okay, let me stop right there and tell you what's coming up on the second amendment front today
[11:59.120 --> 12:05.840]  Not just the Super Bowl being turned into a giant anti-gun extravaganza anti-liberty extravaganza
[12:06.880 --> 12:14.400]  Reverend Jesse Jackson says gun supporters are domestic terrorists. The video is up there. He told the Wall Street Journal this
[12:15.200 --> 12:18.960]  four days ago and it made it into two newspapers
[12:20.040 --> 12:23.280]  about Jesse Jackson on gun violence and economic summit and
[12:23.280 --> 12:28.080]  The big bombshell is he says we're gonna have to have reconstruction
[12:28.880 --> 12:31.200]  We're gonna have to have the North take over the South
[12:31.880 --> 12:35.320]  Gun owners are racist. They're the new they're the new
[12:36.480 --> 12:41.040]  What do you call it a Confederacy and and again, that's a talking point
[12:41.040 --> 12:44.400]  I got a bunch of clips we're gonna play right now and they're coming into the next segment
[12:44.640 --> 12:49.280]  We're on all these different shows. You've seen it. You've read it race has nothing to do with it
[12:49.280 --> 12:51.280]  And
[12:52.320 --> 12:57.840]  They're just injecting this to create division. It is unprecedented
[12:58.680 --> 13:04.240]  And you've got Bob Schaefer on CBS saying we defeated Hitler and the Nazis we can defeat gun owners
[13:04.240 --> 13:11.120]  We can take their guns on CBS. He said the president defeated Hitler or the Nazis. No, our grandparents and great-grandparents did
[13:11.840 --> 13:18.040]  Just amazing. We've got other clips of Fox Sports saying look, you know the NRA gun owners of the Ku Klux Klan
[13:18.040 --> 13:20.240]  We've got Jesse Jackson saying
[13:21.240 --> 13:25.240]  And then meanwhile, I see this every few days now. This is just from a few days ago
[13:25.960 --> 13:31.760]  MSNBC has host on mainly white house saying all the racist crackers need to give their guns up
[13:31.800 --> 13:37.480]  Yeah, the Republicans are all just racist crackers. Let me like using the n-word to talk about black people
[13:37.480 --> 13:40.880]  And it's meant to fire up racial division
[13:41.400 --> 13:45.560]  In this country and then politically correct groups can slam
[13:45.560 --> 13:50.440]  Anybody that says hey, I don't like you, you know trying to put me down and everybody else will just their guilt
[13:50.960 --> 13:52.960]  Basically submit to that. So that's coming up
[13:53.680 --> 13:55.680]  also Chris Kyle
[13:55.960 --> 13:57.960]  the
[13:58.480 --> 14:03.340]  Sniper the Navy SEAL sniper was gunned down yesterday up outside Dallas
[14:04.000 --> 14:10.880]  With with the head of his foundation and a PTSD Marine. They've reportedly taken out there. He's been arrested there
[14:10.880 --> 14:16.120]  They've charged him today and and they're saying that this individual and I'll give you his name
[14:16.520 --> 14:21.560]  This individual who had PTSD was under psychiatric care Eddie Ray Roth
[14:22.160 --> 14:25.160]  Is the main suspect in the killing as a three million dollar bond?
[14:25.960 --> 14:31.000]  Now again, you have 22 service people killing themselves a day and that's why I brought that up and
[14:31.440 --> 14:37.320]  Then every couple weeks, you'll hear about a service person killing their wife or their boss or something
[14:37.920 --> 14:39.600]  statistically out of
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.920]  300 and it's now 20 million people. I mean statistically we've shown the statistics FBI gov
[14:46.160 --> 14:51.080]  Mass shootings are 80 80 year 88 people about half those gang related
[14:52.040 --> 14:56.480]  Veterans killing people is not even a thousand a year sounds like a big number
[14:56.480 --> 15:01.440]  But it's it's not even the top hundred causes of death in this country
[15:01.440 --> 15:06.880]  But the media creates this illusion and I remember seeing these Homeland Security reports four years ago
[15:06.880 --> 15:10.040]  When Obama got in suddenly saying veterans gun owners
[15:10.440 --> 15:17.520]  Conservatives libertarians. They're the terrorists. They're gonna attack veterans will use IEDs at every city to bomb police departments
[15:17.520 --> 15:20.800]  Remember that they were given the cops the training and I thought well that doesn't make sense
[15:21.600 --> 15:26.720]  Sure, you've got troops committing suicide. You've got them putting them on psychotropics that say on the insert
[15:26.720 --> 15:33.720]  They can make you commit suicide or go on a psychotic rampage. That's there, but still those numbers won't be high enough to
[15:33.720 --> 15:40.960]  The point is they're going to initiate and stage events. I've been saying that I'm not saying this is staged, but it fits the MO
[15:41.920 --> 15:43.920]  With these psych
[15:43.920 --> 15:49.040]  Psychotropically hopped up mind control subjects to start this stuff and look who it is. It's Chris Kyle
[15:49.160 --> 15:57.200]  We're gonna break that down as well all this and more coming up today. I'm Alex Jones info wars comms the new site

[20:18.000 --> 20:23.440]  All right, we are back live here. I'm gonna race through the key developments in the battle
[20:23.840 --> 20:26.560]  It's happening right now for the silver
[20:26.560 --> 20:28.480]  Silver is the silver
[20:28.480 --> 20:30.480]  Silver is the silver

[20:32.480 --> 20:34.480]  Silver is the silver
[20:34.480 --> 20:36.480]  Silver is the silver
[20:36.480 --> 20:38.480]  Silver is the silver
[20:38.480 --> 20:40.600]  Silver was just for the second amendment and we're winning the
[20:41.800 --> 20:47.760]  war right now but that doesn't mean we'll continue to win unless we continue to fight and Forbes is a big article where they
[20:47.960 --> 20:49.960]  contracted a large data mining firm
[20:50.560 --> 20:52.560]  But it's actually tracking what you're saying
[20:52.640 --> 20:58.160]  Not just what fake polls are putting out and they find that we are routing them on the second amendment
[20:58.280 --> 21:00.840]  But we were routing them on Obamacare and
[21:01.440 --> 21:03.880]  the fact that it was written by the insurance companies as a
[21:03.880 --> 21:08.780]  as a forced corporate tax to rip people off and would double premiums the first year.
[21:08.780 --> 21:09.780]  That's this year.
[21:09.780 --> 21:18.260]  It's now happening and have the average family yearly premium be $20,000 a year by 2016.
[21:18.260 --> 21:19.980]  That's now official, but it doesn't matter.
[21:19.980 --> 21:20.980]  They got it in place.
[21:20.980 --> 21:22.780]  They're going to ram it down your throat.
[21:22.780 --> 21:26.940]  Just because we're winning the fight for hearts and minds doesn't mean we're winning.
[21:26.940 --> 21:31.260]  We have to go a step further and I'm going to get to that Forbes article coming up in
[21:31.260 --> 21:34.820]  R.A. winning the influence battle over gun control.
[21:34.820 --> 21:38.340]  I'm going to explain how most of these big polls are fake.
[21:38.340 --> 21:40.780]  Now you can tell if a poll is accurate or not.
[21:40.780 --> 21:41.780]  Okay.
[21:41.780 --> 21:43.020]  Let's just stop right there.
[21:43.020 --> 21:49.140]  Again, up at infowars.com and our other sister site, prisonplanet.com, Reverend Jesse
[21:49.140 --> 21:57.480]  Jackson says gun supporters are domestic terrorists and the full interview and video is up there.
[21:57.480 --> 22:00.660]  But first I wanted to play some other clips.
[22:00.660 --> 22:08.060]  Here is Jason Whitlock of Fox Sports elaborating on how he believes the NRA.
[22:08.060 --> 22:09.060]  That means gun owners.
[22:09.060 --> 22:10.060]  It's never the second amendment.
[22:10.060 --> 22:11.580]  He doesn't have to talk about that.
[22:11.580 --> 22:13.780]  It's the NRA.
[22:13.780 --> 22:14.780]  It's never we the people.
[22:14.780 --> 22:20.140]  It's the NRA speaks for us and they're the new KKK.
[22:20.140 --> 22:21.860]  Nothing racially involved.
[22:21.860 --> 22:26.500]  The NRA set up to train at the end of the Civil War, Northern recruits and soldiers
[22:26.500 --> 22:31.420]  out of chute, including blacks has nothing to do with the KKK.
[22:31.420 --> 22:37.340]  Never has the KKK in the South got the first gun control laws passed in 1868 because they
[22:37.340 --> 22:39.700]  didn't want blacks who were newly freed to get guns.
[22:39.700 --> 22:46.100]  The truth is the anti gunners have the KKK history, but it's just amazing.
[22:46.100 --> 22:47.380]  It's just so incredible.
[22:47.380 --> 22:48.380]  Let's go to that club.
[22:48.380 --> 22:55.780]  I did not go as far as I would like to go because my thoughts on the NRA and America's
[22:55.780 --> 22:56.780]  gun culture.
[22:56.780 --> 23:06.020]  I believe the NRA is the new KKK and that the arming of so many black youths and loading
[23:06.020 --> 23:11.300]  up our communities with drugs and then just having an open shooting gallery is the work
[23:11.300 --> 23:14.100]  of people that obviously don't have our best interests.
[23:14.100 --> 23:15.100]  You know what's funny?
[23:15.100 --> 23:18.700]  You know what's funny?
[23:18.700 --> 23:23.540]  Drugs in this country when they started making me legal in the 30s, the first places it was
[23:23.540 --> 23:26.500]  kind of left alone was the lower income areas.
[23:26.500 --> 23:31.700]  So in a way what this guy's actually saying is true, that the drugs were allowed in the
[23:31.700 --> 23:37.020]  minority communities because it was a pretext to basically get control of those communities.
[23:37.020 --> 23:42.080]  But that's corrupt mafias knowing they could operate somewhere because others would say
[23:42.080 --> 23:43.480]  not in my backyard.
[23:43.480 --> 23:46.380]  They always try to build the chemical plant in the poor neighborhood.
[23:46.380 --> 23:50.900]  They always try to, it didn't matter if it's India and all it is is Indians living there.
[23:50.900 --> 23:52.900]  They go put the chemical plant in the poor neighborhood.
[23:52.900 --> 23:58.700]  It's not about race so much as it is about not in my backyard of the rich people.
[23:58.700 --> 24:02.900]  But just injecting the NRA is the new KKK.
[24:02.900 --> 24:08.980]  No, sir, the people in New York and Chicago in the last 55, 60 years that took all the
[24:08.980 --> 24:13.300]  guns out of your cities so that only criminals have them, see of the highest crime rates
[24:13.300 --> 24:19.540]  in the world in places like Chicago and New York, Chicago's number one, that's what allowed
[24:19.540 --> 24:25.140]  this culture and MTV promoting gangster rap and cop killer rap, where I just saw some
[24:25.140 --> 24:28.100]  other famous rappers just shot each other last week.
[24:28.100 --> 24:32.060]  I mean, it's crazy.
[24:32.060 --> 24:36.420]  That's black rappers putting that out and then the media and Sumner Redstone putting
[24:36.420 --> 24:40.900]  it out via Viacom and MTV.
[24:40.900 --> 24:41.900]  That's not my fault.
[24:41.900 --> 24:43.500]  I don't want you to die.
[24:43.500 --> 24:47.500]  I'm sick and tired of hearing because I'm white, I inherently don't like you.
[24:47.500 --> 24:50.780]  Now, a lot of whites who weren't racist hear all this and go, well, you know what, I don't
[24:50.780 --> 24:51.780]  like you either.
[24:51.780 --> 24:57.340]  Well, you know what, I'm not going to stoop to the level of Jesse Jackson and people like
[24:57.340 --> 24:59.140]  the individual, Jason Whitlock.
[24:59.140 --> 25:02.740]  I mean, these people are a joke and they're the racist.
[25:02.740 --> 25:03.740]  It's clear.
[25:03.740 --> 25:07.700]  And it's how they sit there and are in our identity politic people.
[25:07.700 --> 25:12.060]  And notice, they always tell whites and conservatives, don't be identity politic.
[25:12.060 --> 25:13.060]  You know why they say that?
[25:13.060 --> 25:15.100]  Because that's effective.
[25:15.100 --> 25:16.100]  It's effective.
[25:16.100 --> 25:17.740]  I don't want to just be some gang.
[25:17.740 --> 25:22.940]  I want people to identify with the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Declaration of
[25:22.940 --> 25:28.780]  Independence and freedom and all men are created equal and doubted by their creator.
[25:28.780 --> 25:34.540]  An idea our founders had that didn't even get expressed to the last few decades.
[25:34.540 --> 25:40.100]  I have a dream that will judge people by the character of their deeds, the content of what
[25:40.100 --> 25:42.260]  they stand for, not of what color they are.
[25:42.260 --> 25:43.940]  But let me tell you something.
[25:43.940 --> 25:50.180]  The Democratic Party is now the party of institutional racism and aggression.
[25:50.180 --> 25:51.180]  And it's disgusting.
[25:51.180 --> 25:52.540]  Let's go ahead and go to another clip.
[25:52.540 --> 25:58.420]  Here's Jesse Jackson bumbling around, but if you listen to it, he implies that states'
[25:58.420 --> 26:01.540]  rights movement, it's inherently racist.
[26:01.540 --> 26:03.100]  It's the new confederacy.
[26:03.100 --> 26:08.020]  Well, what do you call it when the federal government's run by foreign banks overturning
[26:08.020 --> 26:09.460]  the entire Bill of Rights Constitution?
[26:09.460 --> 26:12.540]  The states are supposed to step in with a check and a balance.
[26:12.540 --> 26:18.020]  That's the three branches of government, and then those two are split into two again.
[26:18.020 --> 26:19.900]  Just like the legislative split into two.
[26:19.900 --> 26:21.940]  It's meant so you don't get a dictator.
[26:21.940 --> 26:23.180]  But oh, no, it's just racist.
[26:23.180 --> 26:24.680]  Here's Jesse Jackson.
[26:24.680 --> 26:28.420]  These weapons, we're not talking about guns for your house and guns for hunting.
[26:28.420 --> 26:29.900]  These are military weapons.
[26:29.900 --> 26:32.300]  It's always the same script.
[26:32.300 --> 26:33.300]  Back it up, please.
[26:33.300 --> 26:36.260]  We're not talking about guns for your house, guns for hunting.
[26:36.260 --> 26:40.780]  Chicago, New York, and a bunch of other cities where these people run things, where the globalist,
[26:40.780 --> 26:44.420]  liberal, socialist, collectivist authoritarians, they're not really liberals, where they run
[26:44.420 --> 26:46.700]  things, they take all the guns.
[26:46.700 --> 26:51.540]  And then people like Jesse Jackson has bodyguards and a concealed carry, and Dian Feinstein
[26:51.540 --> 26:57.300]  does, and Bloomberg does, and Michael Moore has guns and bodyguards.
[26:57.300 --> 27:01.100]  Charlie Sheen, who I know well for seven years, you know, probably stayed at his house 20
[27:01.100 --> 27:04.380]  times, you know, he's like, well, I got bodyguards and nobody needs guns.
[27:04.380 --> 27:08.660]  Hey, Charlie, and I told him this, not everybody makes $3 million a week like you, bro.
[27:08.660 --> 27:13.060]  It's all about, oh, we feel sorry for the kids, let's turn the guns in, just as a sign
[27:13.060 --> 27:14.180]  we're sad for them.
[27:14.180 --> 27:18.660]  The globalist, we should be mad at the globalist, the PR propagandist, using the dead kids
[27:18.660 --> 27:20.340]  to go after our guns.
[27:20.340 --> 27:25.340]  Again, here is Jesse Jackson, oh, we don't want your guns, not for hunting, the second
[27:25.340 --> 27:27.860]  amendment in four of that, you know, it's a script, folks.
[27:27.860 --> 27:28.860]  He knows that.
[27:28.860 --> 27:30.820]  He's following a script.
[27:30.820 --> 27:36.220]  They want the government to be able to totally take over while it arms the teeth against us.
[27:36.220 --> 27:39.220]  Let's go back to that clip, here it is.
[27:39.220 --> 27:42.700]  I went out to the hot guy's house who killed the people at Aurora.
[27:42.700 --> 27:45.300]  He was right near the airport runway.
[27:45.300 --> 27:48.220]  He could blow up airplanes with that stuff.
[27:48.220 --> 27:54.020]  Oh, we're waiting for that, that's like the next step, these anti-American people, we're
[27:54.020 --> 27:59.540]  really arming to stop the government from taking our, taking, they're fighting the government.
[27:59.540 --> 28:00.980]  This is a Confederate ideology.
[28:00.980 --> 28:06.340]  This is like serious, so with power to do something about how they feel.
[28:06.340 --> 28:12.100]  In places like Chicago, we need homeland security, not just the local police.
[28:12.100 --> 28:17.820]  Local police, if this is Chicago, and this is Chuck's gun shop right here, half of all
[28:17.820 --> 28:21.500]  guns that killed put the last five years come from this gun shop, they can do them and look
[28:21.500 --> 28:22.500]  at it.
[28:22.500 --> 28:25.980]  They know, they know where the guns, if this is Iraq, they know where the guns are made.
[28:25.980 --> 28:26.980]  All right, here's pause.
[28:26.980 --> 28:29.780]  We're going to go to Brighton, come back with the rest of it, and I got a bunch of other
[28:29.780 --> 28:35.340]  clips where MSNBC's Finney says, you know, it's the crackers, everything's their fault.
[28:35.340 --> 28:37.460]  White people, evil flows from white people.
[28:37.460 --> 28:42.220]  I mean, the ultimate bigotry unit, just like the Nazis saying evil flows from the Jews,
[28:42.220 --> 28:46.500]  but it's okay because it's the Democratic Party run by foreign banks who want to get
[28:46.500 --> 28:48.540]  a race war going in this country.
[28:48.540 --> 28:49.540]  That's their goal.
[28:49.540 --> 28:51.300]  I mean, no doubt we'll be right back.
[28:51.300 --> 28:57.380]  These people are terrorists.
[28:57.380 --> 29:04.540]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[29:04.540 --> 29:05.780]  tyranny is here.
[29:05.780 --> 29:09.700]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[29:09.700 --> 29:12.100]  It really says that the state is God.
[29:12.100 --> 29:16.620]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[29:16.620 --> 29:17.880]  on earth.
[29:17.880 --> 29:22.700]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[29:22.700 --> 29:24.540]  expanded nationwide.
[29:24.540 --> 29:29.220]  Each documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[29:29.220 --> 29:30.620]  shadow state.
[29:30.620 --> 29:34.620]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[29:34.620 --> 29:39.100]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[29:39.100 --> 29:44.940]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[29:44.940 --> 29:48.420]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[29:48.420 --> 29:50.460]  The police state isn't coming.

[33:05.020 --> 33:15.460]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:15.460 --> 33:21.620]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[33:21.620 --> 33:26.180]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:26.180 --> 33:28.940]  I will give the number out coming up here in the next segment.
[33:28.940 --> 33:31.380]  We'll have open phones in the second hour.
[33:31.380 --> 33:33.100]  We are into the first hour.
[33:33.100 --> 33:35.140]  We're already three minutes into it right now.
[33:35.140 --> 33:42.260]  Okay, if you just joined us, I played a clip of Fox Sportscaster Jason Whitlock.
[33:42.260 --> 33:48.180]  He's also a syndicated columnist saying the NRA is the new KKK and I have similar clips
[33:48.180 --> 33:55.060]  here by, well, we had Al Sharpton say, quote, in fact, I forgot to get that clip queued
[33:55.060 --> 33:56.060]  up.
[33:56.060 --> 33:58.380]  We'll play that after these clips if you can find it.
[33:58.380 --> 34:04.300]  Say that we've got to overcome the South and Whites and the Constitution.
[34:04.300 --> 34:05.860]  He even said the Constitution.
[34:05.860 --> 34:11.020]  You saw that a few weeks ago in the niche and it's every couple days I see prominently
[34:11.020 --> 34:17.300]  the talking point by white, black, Hispanic commentators, you name it, that gun ownership
[34:17.300 --> 34:20.340]  is racist and they know how politically correct Americans are.
[34:20.340 --> 34:27.740]  If they said put your child in ongoing traffic or throw your child into the oven or the microwave
[34:27.740 --> 34:32.100]  or you're racist, I think most Americans would probably go stick their child in the microwave
[34:32.100 --> 34:33.100]  and turn it on.
[34:33.100 --> 34:34.660]  And I'm not even being sarcastic.
[34:34.660 --> 34:37.980]  I think we've gotten the politically correct point that if they came to your house and
[34:37.980 --> 34:44.140]  said, slit your wrist or you're racist, the average white American would slit their wrist.
[34:44.140 --> 34:47.940]  They would absolutely do that.
[34:47.940 --> 34:51.180]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to the Jesse Jackson clip.
[34:51.180 --> 34:52.180]  Here it is.
[34:52.180 --> 34:53.180]  Come in.
[34:53.180 --> 34:54.180]  You break up the trail.
[34:54.180 --> 35:00.660]  Here we see the guns made in Barrington, Rock Island, sold at trucks and so on and so forth.
[35:00.660 --> 35:03.100]  They make them to sit in and they kill.
[35:03.100 --> 35:06.660]  We stand around feeling helpless.
[35:06.660 --> 35:11.300]  And so you've got some combination in this drug thing, in this gun thing of territorial
[35:11.300 --> 35:14.580]  fights, the gun fights over that.
[35:14.580 --> 35:16.220]  Maybe four percent will kill the salt weapons.
[35:16.220 --> 35:19.660]  They kill these other, these locks in these magazines, but the killing is taking place
[35:19.660 --> 35:20.660]  there.
[35:20.660 --> 35:25.860]  Because it's just, because the culture is into guns as a remedy.
[35:25.860 --> 35:30.780]  My point is, while we're focusing on fiscal cliff and debt ceiling, over here, this stuff
[35:30.780 --> 35:36.020]  is not on the table and it matters, it's metastasizing and it's festering.
[35:36.020 --> 35:39.780]  So we're trying to put some focus on this issue of reconstruction.
[35:39.780 --> 35:44.380]  Not just, we need to talk the job for these zones of heavy unemployment, a bit of black
[35:44.380 --> 35:47.900]  mail in New York, remember around 50 percent employed, around 50 percent big number here
[35:47.900 --> 35:48.900]  in New York.
[35:48.900 --> 35:53.020]  But so beyond just the job, some plan for reconstruction.
[35:53.020 --> 35:55.860]  And we know how to do what we've done and we do it around the world.
[35:55.860 --> 36:01.460]  All right, let's go ahead and go to MSNBC just a few days ago, talking about the real
[36:01.460 --> 36:02.940]  problem in America.
[36:02.940 --> 36:03.940]  Here it is.
[36:03.940 --> 36:09.020]  Those, you know, crazy crackers on the right, like if they start with their very hateful
[36:09.020 --> 36:12.540]  language, that is going to kill them in the 506.
[36:12.540 --> 36:15.900]  The death knell for Republicans is the tone of this conversation.
[36:15.900 --> 36:21.220]  They absolutely, we had evangelical Latinos wanting to meet with Howard Dean at the DNC
[36:21.220 --> 36:24.180]  because, I mean, I'm just saying, like that's a shift, right?
[36:24.180 --> 36:26.060]  It's not the beginning to a bad joke.
[36:26.060 --> 36:31.780]  This is part of the hoax that the Republican party's gone, conservatism's dead, everybody
[36:31.780 --> 36:33.620]  really wants total socialism.
[36:33.620 --> 36:35.820]  Wow, this is a mandate.
[36:35.820 --> 36:39.140]  I'm going to talk about that at the end of the segment when I want to go back to some
[36:39.140 --> 36:42.580]  of these clips here first.
[36:42.580 --> 36:45.220]  Let's go to this next clip.
[36:45.220 --> 36:52.700]  This is Bob Schaefer on CBS saying presidents could defeat racism.
[36:52.700 --> 36:55.380]  Presidents could defeat the Nazis.
[36:55.380 --> 36:58.100]  They can defeat the NRA, i.e. gun owners.
[36:58.100 --> 37:01.300]  They don't want to say gun owners or the second amendment or the bill of rights.
[37:01.300 --> 37:06.340]  They say the NRA, first they demonize the NRA, they're Nazis, they're scum, they're
[37:06.340 --> 37:12.380]  KKK, and then by extension, you and then now Homeland Security met on Monday with the top
[37:12.380 --> 37:16.220]  mayors and sheriffs and police chiefs, as you know, and I've got those reports coming
[37:16.220 --> 37:18.860]  up and said, no, the new terror threat is not al-Qaeda.
[37:18.860 --> 37:23.620]  It's gun owners, conservatives, libertarians, what they call domestic extremists.
[37:23.620 --> 37:26.860]  They're returning veterans, and they're just hyping that.
[37:26.860 --> 37:31.540]  Of tens of millions of veterans, they'll use every week a veteran robs a bank, a veteran
[37:31.540 --> 37:32.540]  shoots somebody.
[37:32.540 --> 37:34.100]  Well, all veterans did that.
[37:34.100 --> 37:38.300]  Oh, somebody does a mass shooting, gets the guns illegally, on a bunch of psychotropic
[37:38.300 --> 37:39.500]  drugs, doesn't matter.
[37:39.500 --> 37:45.980]  It's gun owners killed the children, but a veteran kills his wife.
[37:45.980 --> 37:46.980]  Veterans did that.
[37:46.980 --> 37:50.700]  It doesn't matter statistically, and you can look this up at FBI.gov, we've done reports
[37:50.700 --> 37:51.700]  on it.
[37:51.700 --> 37:55.100]  They've got it broken down in racial groups, demographics, everything.
[37:55.100 --> 37:58.660]  You know that veterans are one of the most law abiding groups out there.
[37:58.660 --> 38:03.380]  Doesn't matter what reality is, you are bad.
[38:03.380 --> 38:05.140]  You are bad.
[38:05.140 --> 38:07.900]  Let's go ahead and go to this next clip with Bob Shafer.
[38:07.900 --> 38:13.700]  What happened in Newtown was probably the worst day in this country's history since
[38:13.700 --> 38:15.100]  9-11.
[38:15.100 --> 38:21.380]  We found Osama bin Laden, we tracked him down, we changed the way that we dealt with that
[38:21.380 --> 38:22.380]  problem.
[38:22.380 --> 38:28.740]  Surely, finding Osama bin Laden, surely passing civil rights legislation as Lyndon Johnson
[38:28.740 --> 38:35.660]  was able to do, and before that, surely defeating the Nazis was a much more formidable task
[38:35.660 --> 38:38.740]  than taking on the gun lobby.
[38:38.740 --> 38:44.620]  This is a turning point in this country, and the president is going to have to do more
[38:44.620 --> 38:46.300]  than just make a speech about it.
[38:46.300 --> 38:49.980]  This is one of the best features I've ever heard him deliver, but it's going to take
[38:49.980 --> 38:51.740]  more than that from the White House.
[38:51.740 --> 38:53.500]  He's going to have to get his hands dirty.
[38:53.500 --> 38:58.940]  He's going to have to get in there and work this problem until he gets it done.
[38:58.940 --> 39:06.140]  But unless we figure out a way to make sure that something like Newtown never happens
[39:06.140 --> 39:10.220]  again, we're not the country that we once were.
[39:10.220 --> 39:11.700]  I think we still are.
[39:11.700 --> 39:12.940]  I think there's hope.
[39:12.940 --> 39:14.780]  I think something's going to happen.
[39:14.780 --> 39:16.820]  Well, there you go.
[39:16.820 --> 39:22.660]  The president overcame the Nazis, so he can overcome the gun owners.
[39:22.660 --> 39:24.660]  See, we are now the Nazis.
[39:24.660 --> 39:28.940]  They say, you are KKK, you are Nazis.
[39:28.940 --> 39:36.020]  Every time I see a clip of MSNBC, they're saying whites are inherently bad.
[39:36.020 --> 39:39.380]  In fact, I've been hearing it's over for conservatives.
[39:39.380 --> 39:45.260]  White women support Obama, black support Obama, Hispanics, Asians, and then the media does
[39:45.260 --> 39:48.940]  this victory dance, oh, it's over.
[39:48.940 --> 39:56.060]  It's all over for the unknown soldier and this big victory dance that, oh, man, it's
[39:56.060 --> 39:57.060]  over.
[39:57.060 --> 39:59.740]  And again, foreign banks are raping you financially.
[39:59.740 --> 40:00.740]  They're robbing you.
[40:00.740 --> 40:04.020]  They've raised the different taxes across the board.
[40:04.020 --> 40:07.500]  They've raised the payroll taxes on people making $30,000 a year.
[40:07.500 --> 40:10.580]  They've raised all these other investment taxes.
[40:10.580 --> 40:15.860]  The Obamacare plan sets it up where the companies cut their full-time employees back to 25 hours
[40:15.860 --> 40:22.340]  so they don't have to get the insurance and the GDP is already shrinking massively.
[40:22.340 --> 40:23.340]  That's the plan.
[40:23.340 --> 40:24.340]  Get you on welfare.
[40:24.340 --> 40:26.700]  But it matters as long as you feel like you're winning.
[40:26.700 --> 40:33.860]  Now, the truth is, the fix was in as I clearly broke down and it's not hard to break down.
[40:33.860 --> 40:35.060]  Mitt Romney is a globalist.
[40:35.060 --> 40:37.260]  Mitt Romney was for gun control.
[40:37.260 --> 40:42.060]  He helped write the assault weapons ban that passed in his state, semi-auto ban.
[40:42.060 --> 40:44.300]  The truth is, he supported carbon taxes.
[40:44.300 --> 40:46.180]  He supported open borders.
[40:46.180 --> 40:47.180]  He supported abortion.
[40:47.180 --> 40:50.140]  Do you want to keep going?
[40:50.140 --> 40:55.620]  But they put out the two guys who were almost identical in reality, but they have a political
[40:55.620 --> 40:56.620]  fight with each other.
[40:56.620 --> 41:01.020]  Romney then becomes a conservative, says some good things, but it's all for show, like a
[41:01.020 --> 41:02.940]  Don King boxing match.
[41:02.940 --> 41:06.540]  And then Obama wins and there's evidence of massive election fraud.
[41:06.540 --> 41:07.540]  I don't just say that.
[41:07.540 --> 41:09.820]  There was evidence of fraud against Al Gore in 2000.
[41:09.820 --> 41:14.100]  I hate Al Gore, but I'm on record saying there was evidence of fraud against him.
[41:14.100 --> 41:17.220]  There is overwhelming evidence that Mitt Romney really won.
[41:17.220 --> 41:21.980]  Beth Harris, a black box voting, who's been a big Democrat, who helped make the HBO documentary,
[41:21.980 --> 41:26.300]  Hacking Democracy, said she saw a lot more fraud towards Romney than towards Obama.
[41:26.300 --> 41:33.500]  The fix was in, show the Republican leadership, Jindal and even Rand, who's a good guy, could
[41:33.500 --> 41:38.460]  be told to come out and buy their consultants and say, we've got to get with the times and
[41:38.460 --> 41:39.700]  then we'll start winning.
[41:39.700 --> 41:46.100]  I guess get with the times become left of Mao Zedong on the false paradigm because that's
[41:46.100 --> 41:47.820]  what's going on in this country.
[41:47.820 --> 41:49.020]  That's what's happening.
[41:49.020 --> 41:54.980]  That's the bill of goods that we've been sold as a society.
[41:54.980 --> 41:59.740]  And it makes me physically, physically nauseous to see this unfolding.
[41:59.740 --> 42:04.540]  The truth is, Congress for about six years, you can look this up, just type it in, Congress
[42:04.540 --> 42:09.660]  has a 9% approval rating and some numbers in data mining companies have put out.
[42:09.660 --> 42:14.100]  I'm going to go over some of that in the next hour, show, or maybe even the next segment,
[42:14.100 --> 42:17.140]  show that it might be as low as 3%.
[42:17.140 --> 42:23.020]  So 90-something percent of people, conservatively, 91% conservatively, probably more, don't like
[42:23.020 --> 42:24.820]  the government.
[42:24.820 --> 42:30.660]  But if they can get it in a Coke, Pepsi, Ford Chevy, Red Skin, Cowboy, Seattle Seahawks
[42:30.660 --> 42:37.940]  versus the Eagles, you know, whatever, if they can get a fight going between two groups,
[42:37.940 --> 42:40.980]  then they can get you to join a bandwagon and kind of join one side.
[42:40.980 --> 42:45.940]  Total con game, oldest trick in the book, false choice.
[42:45.940 --> 42:46.940]  And that's what they've sold.
[42:46.940 --> 42:50.500]  So there are a lot of weak-minded kind of bandwagon folks that had gotten away from
[42:50.500 --> 42:54.540]  Obama the last four years when he didn't deliver all the free goods.
[42:54.540 --> 42:57.020]  They kind of got back on the bandwagon because they want to be winners.
[42:57.020 --> 43:00.420]  Well, by saying you like Obama, you're a winner.
[43:00.420 --> 43:03.980]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement for truth-seekers.
[43:03.980 --> 43:08.400]  We've carried a lot of amazing films and books over the years on the online video bookstore
[43:08.400 --> 43:09.900]  at infowars.com.
[43:09.900 --> 43:15.540]  And out of all the titles we've carried, one stands out because it is just so chillingly
[43:15.540 --> 43:16.540]  convincing.
[43:16.540 --> 43:22.220]  And that's Dreams From My Real Father by Joel Gilbert, available at infowars.com.
[43:22.220 --> 43:25.780]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[43:25.780 --> 43:29.940]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[43:29.940 --> 43:34.220]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.

[45:29.020 --> 45:30.980]  to be able to help my sister and my niece.
[45:30.980 --> 45:35.020]  Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

[47:30.380 --> 47:36.140]  your phone calls on the Second Amendment, but also the overarching police state and more.
[47:36.140 --> 47:41.540]  I'll also be getting into the Navy SEAL and his compatriot who were killed up by Dallas
[47:41.540 --> 47:42.540]  yesterday.
[47:42.540 --> 47:43.540]  Very suspicious story.
[47:43.540 --> 47:45.780]  We're going to be breaking that down as well.
[47:45.780 --> 47:51.460]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALAX, it's a different number than the weekday
[47:51.460 --> 47:52.460]  show.
[47:52.460 --> 48:01.100]  It's 877-789-2539-877-789-2539 and first-time callers, give first-time callers a chance.
[48:01.100 --> 48:06.540]  Please only call if you're a first-time caller on this Sunday edition to give us your breakdown
[48:06.540 --> 48:08.340]  on what's happening and unfolding.
[48:08.340 --> 48:13.340]  Okay, let's continue getting into the Second Amendment attack.
[48:13.340 --> 48:20.460]  In the article up at infowars.com, LinkedIn Red in the featured news area, Reverend Jesse
[48:20.460 --> 48:27.940]  Jackson says gun supporters are domestic terrorists and basically that the new radicalism, the
[48:27.940 --> 48:34.300]  new extremism is this new confederacy in that the gun thing's being used to try to, again,
[48:34.300 --> 48:39.300]  it's just more of what you've heard of, well, Fox Sports Commentator saying the NRA's the
[48:39.300 --> 48:41.460]  new KKK.
[48:41.460 --> 48:43.740]  And that's what's said, if you don't like Obamacare, you're a racist.
[48:43.740 --> 48:45.820]  If you don't like globalism, you're a racist.
[48:45.820 --> 48:48.300]  If you don't like giving up your liberty, you're a racist.
[48:48.300 --> 48:56.100]  It's racial politics because this country now in the under-20s is way more, quote, minority
[48:56.100 --> 48:57.500]  than it is white.
[48:57.500 --> 49:01.460]  But if there's, again, under this system now, that's fine.
[49:01.460 --> 49:06.020]  They don't want whites having racial politics, okay, regardless of which side of that thing
[49:06.020 --> 49:07.020]  you're on.
[49:07.020 --> 49:11.060]  There's a lot of different sides, but they certainly are going to create racial politics
[49:11.060 --> 49:16.100]  and notice it's a bunch of white limousine liberals who are leading it because they represent
[49:16.100 --> 49:20.340]  these foreign megabanks that have signed us on to debt slavery.
[49:20.340 --> 49:24.980]  That's the real civil rights violation that we're going under agenda 21, where globalist
[49:24.980 --> 49:30.740]  corporations are exempt from all these regulations and taxes designed to shut down their competition.
[49:30.740 --> 49:33.060]  That China can have three new coal power plants a week.
[49:33.060 --> 49:36.660]  We can't have any, and hundreds have already been shut down the last four years, and our
[49:36.660 --> 49:39.780]  power prices are going up, and our economy's shutting down.
[49:39.780 --> 49:43.300]  So the whole gun thing is also about scripting Obama.
[49:43.300 --> 49:48.060]  There should never be another child shot again, and if there is, it's gun owners' fault.
[49:48.060 --> 49:55.100]  He puts out that false idea and then diverts everyone from his drone killings, arming al-Qaeda
[49:55.100 --> 50:01.300]  and Libya and Syria, the police state, the secret arrest, the NDAA, the continuing torture,
[50:01.300 --> 50:04.300]  the banker bailouts, all of this tyranny.
[50:04.300 --> 50:10.180]  They don't want us getting in a populist movement unified by the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[50:10.180 --> 50:17.020]  and freedom together, they want to unify disparate racial groups under a socialist ideology where
[50:17.020 --> 50:23.540]  their chief is government versus the middle class, which the establishment sees as predominantly
[50:23.540 --> 50:25.260]  white.
[50:25.260 --> 50:33.020]  And so it is a racial ideology and a racial system for the globalist in what they're doing.
[50:33.020 --> 50:39.460]  They are welding together a racial coalition, and I've known so-called progressives that
[50:39.460 --> 50:47.100]  are really smart people and know what's going on, and they now will, people I used to have
[50:47.100 --> 50:51.500]  on as a guest, they will sit there and say, it is racist to not turn your guns in.
[50:51.500 --> 50:56.540]  It is racist to not support Obamacare, even though it's a rip-off written by insurance
[50:56.540 --> 50:57.540]  companies.
[50:57.540 --> 51:02.820]  It is, and it's like a cult, they are just absorbing into the hive borg.
[51:02.820 --> 51:07.340]  These are authoritarians, and they get a wild, reflected glory.
[51:07.340 --> 51:13.620]  A lot of humans are designed to get wild, reflected, group think, group power out of
[51:13.620 --> 51:20.260]  tribalism, and the government is the big overarching tribe welding in all these different groups,
[51:20.260 --> 51:23.900]  and it doesn't matter if the government's screwing them, it doesn't matter if the government's
[51:23.900 --> 51:27.180]  destroying their future, it doesn't matter if the government's injecting them with deadly
[51:27.180 --> 51:31.180]  vaccines for the cancer viruses and aspartame in thousands of foods.
[51:31.180 --> 51:38.980]  It doesn't matter because they feel like winners, and that's what matters to them.
[51:38.980 --> 51:42.380]  They feel like, hey, the government's my government.
[51:42.380 --> 51:46.020]  In fact, we have an Al Sharpton clip coming up that we will play that one, they'll find
[51:46.020 --> 51:49.180]  the one where he says we've got to get, you know, defeat the Constitution.
[51:49.180 --> 51:52.500]  He says we've got to, you know, we've got to defeat the Constitution, we've got to defeat
[51:52.500 --> 51:53.500]  the South.
[51:53.500 --> 51:58.260]  I played that last week, we have a clip of Sharpton coming up after I played this mayor
[51:58.260 --> 52:03.500]  clip of this new mayor's against gun violence ad, where he says, hey, forget the Second
[52:03.500 --> 52:04.500]  Amendment.
[52:04.500 --> 52:07.380]  Yeah, it was there to protect you from the government, but we got drones now.
[52:07.380 --> 52:12.300]  The government's got drones, and that's what they say when I'm on these different so-called
[52:12.300 --> 52:17.380]  liberal shows, these authoritarian shows in liberal clothing.
[52:17.380 --> 52:18.540]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal.
[52:18.540 --> 52:19.540]  These aren't liberals.
[52:19.540 --> 52:22.460]  I know I say that every day because it's so true, you've got to get that to your head,
[52:22.460 --> 52:23.460]  folks.
[52:23.460 --> 52:27.220]  And I'm sitting there, even before I went on CNN, they're like, oh, we don't want to
[52:27.220 --> 52:28.220]  hear it's for guns.
[52:28.220 --> 52:32.660]  The producer was saying to protect you from government, the government has drones.
[52:32.660 --> 52:35.620]  And I've been on countless shows, you hear it everywhere where they say, well, the government
[52:35.620 --> 52:36.620]  has drones.
[52:36.620 --> 52:37.620]  Yeah.
[52:37.620 --> 52:41.660]  And humans pilot those, and they're under, quote, the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[52:41.660 --> 52:44.900]  They're not, they're not under the declaration of war by Congress.
[52:44.900 --> 52:46.060]  They are illegal.
[52:46.060 --> 52:47.420]  They're attacking countries illegally.
[52:47.420 --> 52:50.660]  But the point is we could get back control of them.
[52:50.660 --> 52:52.620]  Our government couldn't take over Vietnam.
[52:52.620 --> 52:57.020]  Our government running our military couldn't, couldn't hold Baghdad.
[52:57.020 --> 53:00.900]  So I don't want to hear that because there's drones that, you know, forget it.
[53:00.900 --> 53:03.500]  The Hive Borg, you will be assimilated.
[53:03.500 --> 53:06.460]  Nothing can defeat the New World Order.
[53:06.460 --> 53:09.980]  It's our tax money, our energy that built this giant military.
[53:09.980 --> 53:12.620]  Now they're getting rid of Posse Commentatus.
[53:12.620 --> 53:17.020]  They announced last week they're going to use the military for domestic operations to
[53:17.020 --> 53:19.180]  fight terrorists.
[53:19.180 --> 53:24.420]  And now any gun crime, any crime where a gun is used is considered terrorism.
[53:24.420 --> 53:26.260]  That's the big announcement in the news.
[53:26.260 --> 53:28.260]  I told you years ago it was coming.
[53:28.260 --> 53:32.300]  So you're now the terrorists, the spying, the data mining, the checkpoints.
[53:32.300 --> 53:36.780]  They've announced they're going to use the NSA to target, quote, gun crime.
[53:36.780 --> 53:39.780]  They've announced they're going to use it to target domestic extremists.
[53:39.780 --> 53:43.580]  Remember they weren't spying on us five years ago and then, well, we're doing it to fight
[53:43.580 --> 53:44.580]  al-Qaeda.
[53:44.580 --> 53:45.580]  And now forget about al-Qaeda.
[53:45.580 --> 53:49.060]  I even have a CNN article I'm going to get to where they say al-Qaeda is on an issue
[53:49.060 --> 53:50.060]  now.
[53:50.060 --> 53:52.260]  Well, yeah, because it works for the globalist publicly.
[53:52.260 --> 53:55.700]  Even General Boykin's come out and exposed that now.
[53:55.700 --> 54:00.860]  Remember how the special forces, no, no, no, it's you, you're the terrorist, well, no kidding.
[54:00.860 --> 54:02.740]  The thing was always set up for us.
[54:02.740 --> 54:06.400]  It was always set up for the federal government to absorb the states.
[54:06.400 --> 54:09.340]  And now they're saying Obama is the new Lincoln.
[54:09.340 --> 54:12.060]  Anyone that opposes what he does is a confederate.
[54:12.060 --> 54:17.140]  And now you're seeing it on CNN, Fox, Wall Street Journal, all these different pundits
[54:17.140 --> 54:22.220]  saying the new confederacy is any state that resist.
[54:22.220 --> 54:23.220]  Obama is here.
[54:23.220 --> 54:24.220]  He is coming.
[54:24.220 --> 54:25.220]  He knows best.
[54:25.220 --> 54:29.300]  He's going to shut down the plants, shut down the factories, raise the taxes until they bankrupt
[54:29.300 --> 54:33.940]  everything except insiders that are exempt, and then you'll go on food stamps, you'll go
[54:33.940 --> 54:37.980]  on government assistance, and they're going to have national compulsory service.
[54:37.980 --> 54:41.660]  They're already announcing it, and the conservatives will say, hey, don't let those liberals not
[54:41.660 --> 54:47.620]  work since, you know, 100 million, 200 million will be on welfare by the time they're done.
[54:47.620 --> 54:50.940]  And then you're in forced labor.
[54:50.940 --> 54:52.460]  They did it under Roosevelt.
[54:52.460 --> 54:55.020]  They're already calling to bring it back, but 10 times worse.
[54:55.020 --> 54:59.420]  They're not going to be building national park lodges this time.
[54:59.420 --> 55:03.140]  They're going to absolutely have gun control checkpoints.
[55:03.140 --> 55:08.580]  That's in the FEMA core documents from nine years ago in the Baltimore Sun and the Philadelphia
[55:08.580 --> 55:15.140]  Enquirer, how they were training the small units of FEMA core college students to assist
[55:15.140 --> 55:19.340]  the police in finding illegal guns and radioing them in.
[55:19.340 --> 55:24.980]  And they have these weird red uniforms, black trousers and red uniforms, completely fascist
[55:24.980 --> 55:25.980]  students.
[55:25.980 --> 55:26.980]  You've seen the videos.
[55:26.980 --> 55:32.580]  Obama says, we need a national, you know, a defense force, a domestic force, just as
[55:32.580 --> 55:34.860]  big and just as strong as our military.
[55:34.860 --> 55:39.220]  And then the videos of the training course, you know, sitting there worshiping Obama like
[55:39.220 --> 55:43.180]  it's North Korea doing chants about Obama and doing military drills.
[55:43.180 --> 55:49.940]  I mean, it's our typally authoritarian and Bloomberg who made $2 billion off of insider
[55:49.940 --> 55:50.940]  deals.
[55:50.940 --> 55:53.900]  The evidence is clear in the stock market who wants to tell you what you can drink and what
[55:53.900 --> 55:57.780]  you can eat and what you can do as illegal checkpoints and now body scanners all over
[55:57.780 --> 55:58.780]  New York City.
[55:58.780 --> 56:04.900]  A goon with his own private security force that ruffs people up in D.C., the talk radio
[56:04.900 --> 56:07.860]  network reporter who politely asked him a question last week.
[56:07.860 --> 56:14.820]  This goon wants your guns to ensure that his quarry, his property is defanged to make sure
[56:14.820 --> 56:15.820]  you're gelded.
[56:15.820 --> 56:20.100]  And now today, during the Super Bowl coming up, they're going to air this ad like we're
[56:20.100 --> 56:23.700]  children, please take the guns, please have a background check.
[56:23.700 --> 56:29.460]  When they have background checks in 97% of the sales, they want it for when you sell
[56:29.460 --> 56:33.900]  to your neighbor or give a gun to somebody where you can't ever transfer a gun again.
[56:33.900 --> 56:35.740]  That's what her bill says.
[56:35.740 --> 56:39.020]  And every time they register, they then confiscate.
[56:39.020 --> 56:42.940]  Criminals aren't going to follow the law anyways, but the children, please take the
[56:42.940 --> 56:44.620]  guns for us.
[56:44.620 --> 56:45.620]  This is how sick it is.
[56:45.620 --> 56:54.260]  Here's that clip from the upcoming ad today, shows cute little children, the NRA once supported
[56:54.260 --> 56:58.140]  background checks, and they play patriotic music in the background when they're globalist.
[56:58.140 --> 57:03.740]  We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory, instinct criminal background checks for every
[57:03.740 --> 57:06.020]  sale at every gun show.
[57:06.020 --> 57:10.300]  No loopholes anywhere for anyone.
[57:10.300 --> 57:13.180]  America can do this for us.
[57:13.180 --> 57:15.180]  America can do it.
[57:15.180 --> 57:23.340]  And folks, 20 years ago, 20 years ago, Lapierre said that, but Lapierre has now said it doesn't
[57:23.340 --> 57:27.740]  work, criminals still get guns, and he went further.
[57:27.740 --> 57:30.460]  He said the people don't trust the system anymore.
[57:30.460 --> 57:31.460]  That's right.
[57:31.460 --> 57:34.660]  They don't want background checks because they're angels and really want to save kids.
[57:34.660 --> 57:36.220]  The globalists could care less.
[57:36.220 --> 57:39.980]  The government shipped guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment and killed tens
[57:39.980 --> 57:41.900]  of thousands of people.
[57:41.900 --> 57:46.580]  12,000 confirmed, almost 60,000 dead the last six years in Mexico, where they've taken
[57:46.580 --> 57:52.620]  all the guns already.
[57:52.620 --> 57:59.020]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[57:59.020 --> 58:00.660]  Bend Soap Company.
[58:00.660 --> 58:04.860]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.
[58:04.860 --> 58:09.620]  These all-natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils
[58:09.620 --> 58:12.140]  that are earth-friendly and safe.

[58:19.980 --> 58:24.740]  Buy the one to two-month sample package and enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what
[58:24.740 --> 58:30.100]  you're using now, or save big with a one to two-year supply of soaps for all your
[58:30.100 --> 58:31.100]  cleaning needs.
[58:31.100 --> 58:33.340]  This is an amazing deal.
[58:33.340 --> 58:38.540]  You can save thousands of dollars, and you will love the way real soap makes you feel.
[58:38.540 --> 58:50.100]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog.
[58:50.100 --> 58:53.180]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[58:53.180 --> 58:58.220]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[58:58.220 --> 59:04.260]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[59:04.260 --> 59:05.260]  to the global takeover.
[59:05.260 --> 59:11.220]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarshop.com.
[59:11.220 --> 59:14.820]  These are items that I did research on that I personally use.
[59:14.820 --> 59:19.380]  You've got the life straw so you can turn fetted water into safe water anywhere you
[59:19.380 --> 59:20.380]  go.
[59:20.380 --> 59:24.580]  The K-Tor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out
[59:24.580 --> 59:25.580]  in the field.
[59:25.580 --> 59:28.660]  Strategic relocation, third edition by Joel Scousum.
[59:28.660 --> 59:33.780]  When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein, they're a safe used by Homeland Security to protect
[59:33.780 --> 59:36.020]  yourself during any radiological event.
[59:36.020 --> 59:39.140]  Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios.
[59:39.140 --> 59:43.260]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowarshop.com
[59:43.260 --> 59:46.060]  and your purchase makes our info war possible.
[59:46.060 --> 59:47.220]  We're getting prepared.
[59:47.220 --> 59:51.780]  Are you infowarshop.com?
[59:51.780 --> 59:55.140]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[59:55.140 --> 01:00:02.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:08.660]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:11.500]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.980]  All right, I haven't even scratched the tip of the iceberg, but I'm not going to make
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:15.980]  collars wait.
[01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:21.980]  I'm going to get to the strange death, the very suspicious death of Chris Kyle, who
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:25.300]  Jesse Ventura has been suing and winning in court.
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:28.300]  Kyle has had no witnesses.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:32.060]  Jesse had I think like six eyewitnesses that he came, he went, he spoke at the commencement
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.060]  event.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.060]  He left.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:37.020]  Why would he come to a thing full of seals and say, I'm glad seals are dying.
[01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.740]  He never talks like that.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:41.340]  And then no witnesses to him being beat up.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:47.460]  Kyle really was going to probably expose some big wigs in the lawsuit.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.420]  And then he took a lot of vets out who would contact him and say they had problems.
[01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:55.540]  They probably sent a wind up toy out on him, which has been declassified.
[01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.780]  They've got these people, sir, hand, sir, hand, you name it.
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:00.780]  I'm going to give you my to, and I don't just say that, okay?
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:07.900]  It's got a lot of telltale sides, but a real PTSD crazy would have those sides too.
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:12.100]  We know he's under psychiatric care, so the drugs alone do it.
[01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.580]  We're going to look at that.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:19.980]  Also the good news out of Forbes, where it breaks down from data mining, not polling,
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:24.900]  real data mining, the gun grabbers are getting their head handed to them.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.260]  Politically though, they could still go forward.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:29.260]  They don't care.
[01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.260]  But this is the big fight.
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.260]  This is the big issue.
[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:32.260]  As I said before, Obama got reelected.
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:39.900]  Well, I'll tell you, it doesn't wane Lampierre and others get a lot of credibility.
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:40.900]  You know what?
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:47.020]  Remind me tomorrow with the nightly news, John, to go get the clips where Bob Chapman
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:53.420]  before he died talked about this too, but the head of gun owners of America and the
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:58.180]  head of the NRA, who by the way, the head of gun owners of America is back on tomorrow
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.780]  on the nightly news.
[01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:04.460]  They all said, we have our intel, there'll be a huge attack on the Second Amendment once
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:08.700]  Obama gets back again, and Obama and the media said that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.620]  And then now look what's happened.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:16.660]  So pretty, pretty darn, pretty darn amazing that Larry Pratt and so many others said that
[01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:18.380]  and it indeed happened.
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:24.620]  And then we're going to get into this whole skeet shooting thing, and I haven't talked
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:30.980]  too much about the last few shows because I had so many other things on the front burner.
[01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.780]  But Obama says, I've been out skeet shooting.
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:34.180]  I've never seen a shotgun like that.
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:39.700]  He's shooting really weird looking like a smoke gun or something like a pop gun and
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:43.300]  the White House put it out and said, you're not authorized to use this photo.
[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:45.140]  It's only for press and media.
[01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:49.100]  You can't put something out and vaguely say press and media can use it and then nobody
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:51.100]  else can.
[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.540]  Plus it was taken.
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:57.780]  I actually checked into the law and the regulations and precedent on this with fair use.
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:06.140]  If taxpayer money pays for a film production, 100% taxpayer funded, or if a tax-funded
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:11.260]  operation put something out there in public domain, they can't selectively say who can't
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:12.260]  use it.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:17.220]  And the claim that no one has a right to use or alter the photo, knowing people would
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:21.860]  photo shop it, and people thought it was almost a joke like they were baiting people
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:24.100]  to create a new meme of Obama shooting the gun.
[01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:28.940]  No, the White House photos I've been on there now say copyright and you can't use these.
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.740]  Well, of course we use them.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:36.660]  Just because these criminals say we can't use our property, there it is, Obama mocked
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:41.180]  for releasing skeet shooting photo during gun control debate and people have got him
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:47.580]  shooting at the Constitution and like Looney Tunes with a flag comes out of the shotgun.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.140]  Look at that weird looking shotgun.
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:52.180]  I got to say that looks like fake smoke.
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:55.540]  That looks, I've never seen, I've videoed a lot of guns firing.
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:58.540]  I've never seen a shotgun with that weird white thing on the end.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.820]  It looks like a rubber stopper.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:03.460]  And then there's that smoke looks fake.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:09.860]  And then the porting, I know they've got ports on the side, but man something's weird.
[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.420]  And it's almost like they put this fake stuff out to create the debate.
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:17.980]  I mean like that, it wasn't just that they put that out in layers with a computer program
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:18.980]  problem.
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:24.180]  They had different type fonts within the same typeset and it was a fake font that's meant
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:28.540]  to look like old fashioned typewriter, but the C's, the D's, all the letters had the
[01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.100]  same splats around them.
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:33.820]  With a real typewriter, each splat is different even with the same letter because it's like
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:36.140]  a fingerprint or a snowflake.
[01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.140]  I mean it's just it's 100% fake.
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:39.140]  I mean you understand?
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:40.620]  There's no debating.
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.620]  Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake.
[01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:46.940]  And I've got a good eye, anybody's got a good eye that's worked with Photoshop.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.940]  That photo looks fake.
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.060]  That photo looks fake, okay?
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.620]  That I've shot more skeet than I'd care to even remember.
[01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:54.620]  That looks fake.
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:55.820]  What kind of gun is that?
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:59.900]  We'll be right back with your calls.

[01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:14.060]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com We are on the march, the empire is on the run.
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:25.460]  All right, we're into the second hour here of the Sunday Transmission.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:31.460]  I'm back weekdays, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern, that's 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:35.220]  Thank you so much again for joining us on this Sunday broadcast.
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:39.420]  I'm going to go to your calls for the next two segments or so, then I'm going to get
[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:43.900]  back into second amendment news, and then I've also got some postal service news.
[01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:51.820]  They say they're now immune from local traffic laws, and when I saw this Yahoo headline,
[01:06:51.820 --> 01:06:59.380]  I thought a cop must have given them a ticket for being stopped in a no stopping zone, but
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:02.980]  they're able to stop because they're putting mail out.
[01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:07.660]  And then I read the article, and it was about them running red lights and speeding through
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:13.260]  school zones with kids almost being run over, and the judges ruled they're immune.
[01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:15.980]  That is, again, the new royalty.
[01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:20.900]  I mean, and again, on average, post men and women are really good people.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:25.940]  I'm not a big fan of government institutions, but this is one of the first American institutions.
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:31.740]  It's pioneering our postal system invented by Benjamin Franklin, and I like the competition
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:37.620]  that there's a bunch of companies out there like FedEx and UPS and then a government one,
[01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:38.900]  where they can all compete against each other.
[01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.420]  I don't like the fact that it's subsidized now.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.940]  I think it kind of subsidizes the other guys in a way.
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:49.540]  But the point is, is that the fact that a judge has ruled they're above the law, Katie
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:50.540]  bar the door.
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.180]  It's the same with the cops.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.140]  They don't get in trouble when they're speeding and it's not an emergency.
[01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:59.380]  I mean, this is the new governing class where they're above the law, and the UN has diplomatic
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.580]  immunity, all the rest of it.
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:02.740]  I guess I already got to that, didn't I?
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:09.660]  They're in his postal service as it's immune from local traffic laws, running red lights
[01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:12.740]  and speeding in school zones.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:17.420]  I was never a big speeder in neighborhoods, but now that I have children, I mean, I just
[01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:21.400]  drive like five miles an hour when I'm going through neighborhoods, and I still almost
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.140]  have run over people on bikes and little kids right out in front of you.
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.620]  Just this week, I was cutting through a neighborhood going about 10 miles an hour, and little
[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:35.260]  kids came shooting out in front of me on their scooters, little kick scooters, and I was
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:40.860]  going like six miles an hour, and thank God I was, or I almost hit one of them.
[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.620]  I was going six miles an hour.
[01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:44.540]  Yeah, make sure your heart stopped.
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:45.540]  It certainly does, CJ.
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.420]  Yeah, they're in his postal service.
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:48.820]  We're immune from local traffic laws.
[01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:54.940]  My favorite example is the UPS truck driver delivering mail while naked, or USPS, excuse
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:59.180]  me for, I did not mean to defame UPS, it's a USPS.
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:06.660]  Okay, yeah, I guess the USPS is immune, but not FedEx and not UPS.
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:10.820]  Okay, I'm going to go to your calls, then I'm going to get to NRA winning the influence
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:11.980]  battle over gun control.
[01:09:11.980 --> 01:09:15.900]  I don't just believe an op-ed, I don't just believe a poll, unless I've done my own
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:20.100]  back research, because you have internal market studies you can get out that are pretty
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:21.100]  accurate.
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:24.900]  See, corporations want internal market research.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:27.020]  That's where you find the really accurate stuff.
[01:09:27.020 --> 01:09:31.500]  And I'm going to be getting to some of that, a big data mining company, we are routing
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:37.060]  them on the gun issue, but for one reason, we are sustained, and they admit in their
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:41.140]  algorithms we're going to lose the Second Amendment if we don't keep pushing.
[01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:49.740]  So they're telling the anti-gun groups just, you know, it's a war of stamina.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:55.820]  And so that's coming up as well, and the Chris Kyle Navy SEAL that Ventura's suing, he got
[01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.180]  shot and killed yesterday.
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.180]  Very suspicious.
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:01.260]  We're going to be looking at that some, but right now let's go to some of your calls.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:09.020]  Kim, Michael, Daryl, Zane, Jose, John, Frank, Zach, Glenn, Dan, Scott, and others.
[01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:10.020]  We're going to go to you.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:12.820]  Let's start at the bottom of the calls this time, instead of the top.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:15.140]  Let's go to Scott in Colorado.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.140]  You're on the air.
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.140]  Welcome, Scott.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.700]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:22.020]  I'm doing all right, but I tell you, it's getting crazy.
[01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.020]  Absolutely is.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.900]  My mom is taking over.
[01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:30.860]  I got to say that I've never thought it would move this quick, but yeah, he says the UN's
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.300]  over our military.
[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.660]  He can secretly arrest us if he wants.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:39.500]  He's arresting good whistleblowers that expose any government criminal activities.
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:40.500]  It's unprecedented.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.420]  I have a question for you, Alex.
[01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.420]  Yes?
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:48.620]  Who's Mallory Mahoney?
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:52.100]  Mallory Mahoney is one of our graphics people that works here at the office.
[01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:55.220]  Wasn't she formerly with Stratford?
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:58.140]  You guys are mentally ill, and I appreciate your call.
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:03.180]  Whenever we hired six graphics people for the magazine and for working in here, and
[01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:09.220]  the University of Texas is here in Austin, Stratford is like a private intelligence
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:14.900]  gathering firm that, in my opinion, puts out propaganda as like a feedback loop to agree
[01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:15.900]  with the Pentagon.
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:19.060]  They can say, look, this private group said, somebody worked there for a month and a half
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:22.460]  as an unpaid intern and helped write a paper on China.
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:26.260]  I mean, what am I going to do if somebody was ever in the military, or somebody ever
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.260]  in...
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:28.260]  I mean, you know how many people?
[01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:33.580]  You know about a third of the UT journalism people that we bring in here for interviews
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:36.060]  because we hired a couple from UT, actually three of them from UT.
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:40.500]  Did you know about half of them or more had an internship there?
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:42.940]  There's not many places to get a media internship.
[01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:50.100]  The Austin American statesman, the Austin Chronicle, this is for print, the Houston,
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:53.580]  the Texas Observer or whatever it's called, that's small, and then Stratford because it's
[01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.900]  mainly writing thousands of things a day.
[01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:58.220]  That is mental illness, you see.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:00.940]  We're not worried about the New World Order, we're not worried about everything else.
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:03.420]  Listen, people say I work for the government, okay?
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:07.700]  I wouldn't get up here and say don't take the vaccines, the government's pushing that.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:12.420]  I wouldn't get up here and say criminal elements of our government were involved in 9-11 because
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:15.380]  they were or they're running al-Qaeda and Libya and Syria.
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:17.060]  I mean, just use your brain.
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.060]  You know what?
[01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:22.340]  If I work for the government, then I'm the worst government agent the planet's ever seen.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.340]  Total mental illness.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:27.380]  And people always say you need to answer this or you need to answer that and no matter how
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:31.860]  many times I answer something, I will still be asked the same mentally ill question over
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:32.860]  and over again.
[01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:37.260]  People are looking, see what's happened is the public has lost faith in the mainstream
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:40.100]  media and the government, which overall is a healthy thing.
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:44.060]  Our founding fathers stated that, history shows that, but they had judgment.
[01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:48.260]  It doesn't mean that then everything is fake.
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:55.900]  It doesn't mean that I'm Bill Hicks or that I'm really an actor and the professor in Florida
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:13:00.060]  who says that Sandy Hook may have been staged with crisis actors, which they really have,
[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:01.060]  that I'm him.
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:05.420]  I mean, mental illness, mental illness.
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:11.540]  But I understand in a society in crisis, you know, just doesn't believe anything anymore.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:13.040]  Mental illness.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:18.060]  Let's go ahead and talk to another caller, Glenn in New Jersey.
[01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.060]  You're on the air.
[01:13:19.060 --> 01:13:20.060]  Go ahead.
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:21.060]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:22.060]  Can you hear me?
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:23.060]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:24.060]  I'm a listener.
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.060]  Thank you, sir.
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.060]  I'm son to caller.
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.060]  And I got a serious story here.
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:31.660]  A fellow member of We Are Changed New Jersey has just been arrested here in Jersey City
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:36.180]  and they're also trying to link this for gun possession and they're trying to link this
[01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:41.140]  to the Info Wars Obama dictator poster contest that we participated in saying that it's
[01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:46.500]  extreme to print out posters of Obama with dictator scum posted at the bottom of this.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:52.460]  So they're saying in the Jersey Journal, it says right here, nj.com, Jersey City police
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:56.980]  say man had illegal rifle handguns as well as prohibited bullets.
[01:13:56.980 --> 01:14:01.460]  And so they're getting him for the muzzle modification, the flash suppressor, making
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:02.980]  it an illegal weapon in New Jersey.
[01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:06.940]  Yeah, for those that don't know, they're now, they're now, sure, sure, I'm glad you called
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:07.940]  in about this.
[01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:13.140]  And listen, I've told everybody, I didn't just say that last hour to have fun.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:17.660]  They've officially announced gun owners are the number one new terror group along with
[01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:20.660]  returning veterans, libertarians and conservatives.
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:27.540]  The government is so authoritarian, so, so absolutely Marxist at the grassroots of the
[01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:28.540]  government.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:32.140]  It's foreign banks at the top, but they'll use whoever they've got.
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:36.780]  They are so out of control, they're openly saying, and I've already seen this, not the
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:40.700]  article you're talking about, that anyone criticizing Obama as a terrorist, anybody
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:44.900]  who owns the guns are racist, and that we're the new terrorist, not Al Qaeda and Homeland
[01:14:44.900 --> 01:14:51.020]  Security's main job, I'm going to say that again, Homeland Security's main job is going
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.020]  after the American people.
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:55.500]  Now I'm going to get that headline again from you so I can search engine it during the break
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:15:00.660]  and get it up there for me, but you guys can probably just search Alex Jones.
[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.380]  What is my name in the, in the article?
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:07.220]  No, but they're trying to implicate me because I participated in the video.
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.940]  Okay, so they're saying Obama dictator poster contest.
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:17.300]  The name is Keith Panteleon, 33 of Jersey City was set to appear at $75,000 bail.
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:20.980]  He currently is in Carney prison, and my name is Glenn Zarmanov.
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:21.980]  I'm a longtime listener.
[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:22.980]  Let's just stop right there.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.660]  Brother, let's just stop right there.
[01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:30.380]  So they do talk about my contest to, to, to put up signs saying Obama's becoming a dictator
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:34.060]  that I did three years ago that the media said should be illegal.
[01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:38.820]  We are by the way, we brought the t-shirt back, the tyrant scum t-shirt, limited edition,
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:42.220]  a new design is out, available at infowarstore.com.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:43.580]  We should all wear these proudly.
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:47.260]  Yeah, they said on more than 20 TV stations, it should be banned.
[01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:51.660]  I should be arrested for, for saying he's a tyrant, of course he's proving me right.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:16:00.660]  Uh, but yeah, there's a purge against gun owners, we'll be right back, stay with us.

[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:12.020]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:16.540]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:17.780]  on earth.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:22.580]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being

[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:04.940]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:08.900]  through the year from natural disasters like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:12.460]  drought to the family hardships brought on by disastrous economy.

[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:30.860]  to be able to help my sister and my niece.
[01:18:30.860 --> 01:18:35.060]  Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early and one day too late.

[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:19.460]  Our most popular silver based products are the 32 ounce nano silver solutions, our two
[01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:25.180]  ounce nano silver nasal applicators, as well as our all natural silver soaps.
[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:29.220]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[01:19:29.220 --> 01:19:33.860]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:38.980]  leave the silver at the surface, but rather we have formulated our silver gel using the
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.580]  natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the
[01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:47.340]  skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:13.220]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:22.340]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:26.380]  We have to politically get good members of the House and Senate federally but also state
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:32.340]  legislatures to come out authoritatively and say look, these purges are wrong in Connecticut,
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:36.740]  New Jersey, California, New York and other states.
[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:40.100]  What's happening is, and I see these articles all the time now, we're going to go over a
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:49.500]  few of them here in just a moment, where not even the ban of over 10 capacity magazines
[01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:53.580]  where you can't physically possess them, hadn't even fully gone into effect yet and
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:21:00.140]  a Army veteran, no criminal record, who actually ran a charity for other veterans, they have
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:03.660]  a license plate reading software now.
[01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:07.420]  Most police cars in major cities have them.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:11.060]  And they admit, because it's on the Southern Prairie Law Center watch list and ADL watch
[01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:16.620]  list, that whoever they say is a group, you now are a terrorist, you now have no rights
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:21.740]  for turning veterans, gun owners, we are change is a group that's spun off from one of my
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:27.980]  listeners, Luke Radowski, that just goes out and asks journalist, you know, citizen questions.
[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:34.100]  I'm in there, people that don't like the Federal Reserve are in there and these foreign globalist
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:38.780]  organizations like the Southern Prairie Law Center and ADL, they're there saying if you
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:42.740]  believe in a new world order, you're a terrorist and they brainwash the cops, they tell them
[01:21:42.740 --> 01:21:46.940]  the founding fathers are bad, I'm not joking, I have the training videos in my film, Road
[01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:52.460]  to Terrany, they tell them all this, they have four shows now airing on TV, we're set
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:22:00.580]  to air this year, demonizing the founders, whole sitcoms, dramas, like I hate Paul Revere,
[01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:02.420]  this is the new cool thing.
[01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:08.740]  As Al Sharpton said, we quote must, this is a quote, overcome the founding fathers, overcome
[01:22:08.740 --> 01:22:15.380]  the constitution was his exact quote and you're like, but it doesn't make sense, we're racist
[01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:20.100]  because we own guns, well, a lot of people that aren't white owned guns, it's about individualism,
[01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:22.260]  it doesn't matter, they're just going to demonize you.
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:24.900]  So in the news, they say an extremist was arrested.
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:28.500]  Now he brought this up and I actually have the article, we can punch it up on screen
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:36.500]  or go to the document cam shot here for people, Jersey city police say man had illegal rifle,
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:42.700]  prohibited bullets at home and they're saying he had over a 10 round mag and they're saying
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:48.060]  that he had a flash depressor on it, which does nothing.
[01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:53.300]  So this is it, they're going to come after the gun owners and they're now even in the
[01:22:53.300 --> 01:22:56.940]  places that don't have a lot of gun laws, SWAT teaming people because the neighbors
[01:22:56.940 --> 01:23:00.380]  said they saw a gun and going, you'll never get your hundred guns back because you shouldn't
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:03.780]  have a hundred or just like New Orleans where they went to the high and dry areas and took
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:04.780]  the guns.
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:10.860]  So here it is out of Forbes, NRA winning the influence battle over gun control, yes we're
[01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:15.100]  winning in the scientific polls, we're winning in the inner research, we're winning on the
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:19.540]  internet scans, but they don't care, they're just going to say we're terrorists and turn
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:21.820]  homeland security loose on us.
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:27.140]  The government shipped 20,000 guns and hand grenades into Mexico, the memos came out to
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:32.700]  blame the second amendment, they're ruthless, they want our guns, well they buy 1.6 billion
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:37.300]  bullets in armored vehicles and build emergency centers and federalize the police and set
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:43.820]  up warrantless checkpoints now like they have in Austin with the TSA, totally illegal, totally
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:46.460]  unconstitutional, they're just doing it.
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:52.180]  Huge military drills every day in major cities, terrorizing the public, getting us ready for
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:56.780]  military occupation, army times admits they're preparing to have troops on the streets, it's
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:58.100]  already happening.
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:04.180]  Something I warned you about 15, 16, 17 years ago is happening because they announced it
[01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:10.180]  today, government to take control of private pension funds to protect them, that's the
[01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:17.180]  headline at infowars.com, big government announcement Friday and there will be a special tax on
[01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:24.380]  top of the 3.8% tax already there on top of pension funds in Obamacare and the 3.8% increase
[01:24:24.380 --> 01:24:30.780]  in payroll tax and all the new taxes because they love you, no it's the governing class
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:34.940]  is going to take everything we've got, it's happened hundreds of times in other nations,
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:35.940]  it's getting ready to happen here.
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:40.020]  Now I've got to get to all the callers but Glenn in New Jersey, I'll put you on hold
[01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:44.460]  after you go, you can give me all the names and facts, I did find where the other blog
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:50.740]  where they're talking about, yeah this guy who had the 30 round mag, he was part of a
[01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:56.100]  poster contest where they put up posters saying Obama was bad, it should be illegal, these
[01:24:56.100 --> 01:25:00.500]  are extremists, oh my gosh, you don't say somebody, the government's bad in America,
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:02.220]  you don't have freedom of speech.
[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:06.540]  So yes, thank you for giving us a heads up about that, as you were saying during the
[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:10.660]  break when I talked to you, they are going to try a purge of gun owners, they're testing
[01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:15.260]  it right now, we've got to get back in their face and go, you're the terrorists coming
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:19.060]  in and taking over our country, saying our military is under foreign control, that's
[01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:22.140]  official, and saying our guns are illegal, go ahead.
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:26.980]  Absolutely, thank you Alex Jones for having me, don't thank me or I won't have time to
[01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:30.020]  get to all the other callers, no more, I'm going to put you on hold, I'm going to put
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:33.820]  you on hold, Rush Limbaugh did this 20 years ago, I got to do it, you just got to say
[01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:39.220]  Ditto's, folks, all we do is say how great I am, I am not great, okay, I'm angry, I want
[01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:43.420]  to keep my liberties, I don't like a bunch of crooks taking over and running my life,
[01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:45.740]  okay, I'm sorry, go ahead and call her.
[01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:49.820]  Yeah, basically look, he's in jail right now, he has a friend of mine, we did the poster
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:54.940]  contest as other blogs, the post is one of us, question mark, and it says part of his
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:59.380]  legal troubles might be linked to this video that he and a friend made in Jersey City and
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:03.300]  a link to the Facebook post of the Obama poster contest that we entered in, so yeah, they're
[01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:06.860]  trying to smear us, they're trying to do a purge right now, anyone who listens to Alex
[01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:10.780]  Jones Info Wars, anyone who supports liberty, and I don't even own any firearms and that's
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:15.700]  the whole problem here, is that I'm just putting posters out there on behalf of your
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:18.780]  poster contest or any other posters, I've done posters on my own.
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:23.940]  No exactly, look, we have an authoritarian government, obviously authoritarians don't
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:29.020]  like their slaves being armed, the last thing they've taken is our guns, they've already
[01:26:29.020 --> 01:26:33.020]  taken the bank accounts, the dollar, they're going to take everything, they need those
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:37.580]  guns first though, they're going to go ahead with it and have a civil war, they want to
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:43.620]  get as many voluntarily as they can, we've got a Stalin or a Hitler in control but it's
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:48.060]  bigger than Obama, the Republican leadership's been told you better go along with it, that's
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:52.580]  why they're saying oh we got a broken wing, we've got to do whatever big government says,
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:56.780]  it's a mandate, socialism, turn your guns in because they're controlled, I'm going to
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:27:00.780]  put you on hold, I want to get all the info, if you write a blurb about it we can link
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:04.980]  to it, you're going to be okay, don't let them scare you, this is going on where the
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:10.260]  crime bosses run everything, New York, Chicago, areas of Jersey, this is what it's turned
[01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:14.540]  into, let's jam in another call here, I've got to get to more of these, let's talk to
[01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:17.060]  Zach in Tennessee, you're on the air Zach.
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:24.260]  I don't know if you need to, I don't know if you saw the thing today, it says three
[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:28.420]  well-known second amendment supporters, young business owners and I know you've covered
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:34.420]  them all on your show, Chris Kyle, Keith Ratliff, the FPS rusher guy and then also the John
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:40.220]  Nevinsky and then they all died under mysterious circumstances within one month, but that's
[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:43.700]  not even that important, here's what I was really going to say, listen it's really starting
[01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:48.900]  to emerge that they've got killings, I mean, FPS Russian producer was tied up and killed
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:55.060]  execution style, there are more and more pro-gun people getting killed, yep and then there's
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:59.740]  this video out right now called YOLO, it was all over YouTube last weekend, basically it's
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:04.740]  demonizing preppers and saying that anyone who doesn't live life on the edge, it's basically
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:09.780]  a call to the young generation to do whatever they want and live recklessly and then I know
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:13.780]  you covered the Milwaukee Sheriff on Piers Morgan, I was going to comment on that but
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:18.260]  more importantly than that, Bill Maher was demonizing conspiracy theorists about a week
[01:28:18.260 --> 01:28:22.500]  or two ago and they were basically, he had all these left and rightists on there and
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:27.140]  they were saying 9-11 truthers are from the left and whoever thinks the birther thing
[01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:31.540]  is fake then you know they're from the right, so they're just playing, they're saying you're
[01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:38.140]  a bad guy if you don't believe the known liars, but being a conspiracy theorist means I don't
[01:28:38.140 --> 01:28:42.620]  believe a government and a mainstream media system caught lying thousands of times to
[01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:47.980]  me, that's what it is today, if you question, if you don't just on the surface believe whatever
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:52.420]  they say, look, how do you know if media is good, you judge the tree by its fruits, look
[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:59.420]  at the fruits of the political system, absolute tyranny, more calls straight ahead.
[01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:26.700]  Silver is safe enough to consume every day while powerful enough to destroy the causes
[01:29:26.700 --> 01:29:32.780]  of many serious diseases such as streps, staph, pneumonia, colds, flus and other harmful pathogens.
[01:29:32.780 --> 01:29:37.660]  This new technology has the ability to terminate entire colonies of harmful bacteria at several
[01:29:37.660 --> 01:29:41.780]  hundred times the effectiveness of colloidal or ionic silver solutions.
[01:29:41.780 --> 01:29:46.020]  The science digest journal says silver is our mightiest germ fighter, it is virtually
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:51.860]  non-toxic and is emerging as a wonder of modern medicine, go to supernaturalsilver.com today

[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:05.220]  Looking back on 2012, I know personally I'm thanking God that my family and I made it
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:09.180]  through the year from natural disasters like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:12.700]  drought to the family hardships brought on by disastrous economy.
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:15.060]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:19.180]  My friends at eFoodsDirect hear from customers every day, but are fortunate to weather life
[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:21.500]  storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:24.900]  Danny from New York City wrote in following Hurricane Sandy and said,
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:29.180]  Almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time
[01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:31.140]  to be able to help my sister and my niece.
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:35.180]  Bottom line, it's better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.

[01:33:05.340 --> 01:33:32.540]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:44.140]  We're back here and you can hear the frantic voices of the people calling in.
[01:33:44.140 --> 01:33:48.580]  The power structure doesn't want to go after criminals, they are criminals.
[01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:52.460]  The power structure and it's really bad on the east coast, other crime syndicate controlled
[01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:58.860]  areas obviously, they want to target the little guys and teach us that they're basically
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:01.500]  our owners.
[01:34:01.500 --> 01:34:04.780]  That's what all of this is about.
[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:14.900]  Now up on screen, if you are a TV viewer, I have an article out of the Smithsonian Magazine
[01:34:14.900 --> 01:34:21.060]  for 40 years, the Russian family was cut off from all human contact unaware of World War
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:22.900]  II.
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:28.060]  In the 1930s, they came to their Christian village, the Soviet atheist, and they mowed
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:34.020]  down their families mercilessly, this has been declassified by the archives.
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:41.700]  In 1978, geologists were flying around looking for outcroppings, 150 miles from even the
[01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:50.700]  smallest town and the helicopter picked up, tended to look like tilled fields.
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:53.420]  I want to do a whole report on this.
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:58.180]  This family of five lived there, the mother had starved to death when her children were
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:35:02.340]  small, one winter refusing to eat so they had the only food.
[01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:04.740]  They were dressed like cavemen, everything.
[01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:09.860]  They had walked more than 500 miles total from their original village because the Soviets
[01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:13.580]  were always hunting, they wanted to kill every Christian they could get to, it didn't matter
[01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:16.060]  how much money needed to be spent.
[01:35:16.060 --> 01:35:20.780]  You can go read the full annals of this, it was so important to kill Christians and these
[01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:25.820]  were just poor villagers and it describes how they ran into the woods with just a bag
[01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:32.700]  of seeds and then a blight killed their rye crops, the mother starved to death but a year
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:38.380]  later they lived in different camps over the decades that it took them to get 150 miles
[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:45.140]  out in the middle of nowhere and the Soviets killed conservatively off and on around 50
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:52.740]  million people from 1917 through the 1980s and before the Soviets could basically get
[01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:57.420]  to most of them, they caught pneumonia probably because their immune systems were so debilitated
[01:35:57.420 --> 01:36:01.420]  once other humans came around with new strains of viruses, most of them died.
[01:36:01.420 --> 01:36:08.100]  One of them is living today, one of the daughters but you read about the things they said and
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:14.100]  what they went through and there were tens of thousands, they ended up finding decades
[01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:17.780]  later in the woods and exterminated because even though you're living out in the middle
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:22.900]  of nowhere 50 miles, 100 miles, it doesn't matter, you need to die because the all-powerful
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:28.140]  atheist state says so and of course the atheists coming, they're going to have guns.
[01:36:28.140 --> 01:36:32.740]  Pierce Morgan said he'd like to shoot me and a lot of Buzz Bissinger said he'd like to
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:36.740]  shoot me and a lot of others, they talk about how they want to kill us.
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:42.740]  These are horrible people, very, very horrible people but America, that's why they demonize
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:47.260]  preppers, that's why if you don't trust the system and you want to be self-sufficient,
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:48.260]  they don't like you.
[01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:51.300]  They want you under their control.
[01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:56.940]  Like Bob Dylan wrote in 1983, yeah I can see someday when I even have in your own garden
[01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:02.940]  they'll be against the law, yeah it's sundown on the union, what was made in the USA sure
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:11.740]  sounded like a good idea until things got in the way, yeah we used to grow corn in Kansas,
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:19.140]  now we grow it on the moon and eat it raw, talking about somebody that saw the future
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:22.220]  and that's what's going on here, that's what's happening.
[01:37:22.220 --> 01:37:25.380]  That's why they want you shut down, when you punch it back up on screen for folks, I want
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:31.260]  to show the viewers out there, people watching at infowarsnews.com, the 40 years the Russian
[01:37:31.260 --> 01:37:36.500]  family was cut off from all human contact unaware and just amazing helicopter photos
[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:41.940]  of the little shack they built, no hammers, no nails, little daughters that were tiny
[01:37:41.940 --> 01:37:47.340]  girls when they ran and I was looking at some of the other photos on the deeper in the Smithsonian
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:52.580]  site showing the aerial shots, there it is, of the terraces they put up on the side of
[01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:57.740]  the gorge to grow the few plants that they had that they could also keep the seeds from.
[01:37:57.740 --> 01:38:01.420]  In the future you run to the hills with your seeds, they'll only grow once then they don't
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:06.420]  grow the next year, it's all about patentating life, all about centralized control.
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:10.060]  That's the name of the game and that's why they don't want you self-sufficient, that's
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:13.500]  why all over the country now they're saying you can't have a backyard garden, you might
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:19.180]  grow marijuana, you might, so you're guilty until proven innocent, you can't trust a prisoner,
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:23.620]  we're all prisoners now that try to grow a garden in your backyard, don't trust that
[01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:28.300]  in America, government's got to come look, government it's all secret, building bunkers
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:33.180]  and buying billions of rounds of ammo but you, well they're now saying to see something,
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:38.180]  buy something, main program is do you see guns in people's houses and the average anti-gun
[01:38:38.180 --> 01:38:43.380]  are such a dumb mindless domesticated creature that they come in your house, they see a gun
[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:47.580]  case, they call the police and the police come and take it even though it's not illegal
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:51.820]  and they go well there was just a report, you may, Sue has tried to get your guns back,
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:56.860]  you see that in the news, well we've decided you might be a danger, the government is here
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:01.700]  to break us and I'm telling you folks, if you don't wake up and realize how much trouble
[01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:06.620]  we're in it's all over, this transcends liberal conservative garbage, it's down to freedom
[01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:10.180]  versus slavery, let's talk to Kim and Florida, Kim you're on the air.
[01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:17.540]  Hello Alex, I just want to say the same exact thing that people better wake up because it's
[01:39:17.540 --> 01:39:25.180]  unbelievable, I just had a very recent visit from ATF, they, I wasn't home at the time
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:30.460]  but they knew exactly where I was, even the name of the company that I work at.
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:37.340]  Oh it's incredible, I had the ATF like a decade ago say that a gun I had didn't have a right
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:41.380]  serial number randomly, they wanted me to come down there and it's just a way to harass
[01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:46.940]  you, if you're not a Mexican drug cartel, ship a narcotics and you're a bad guy and
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:51.260]  now it is a purge, we are the new criminals, they want to fill all their new private presence,
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:55.500]  it's us the gun owners and we're in trouble, the cops want to keep their jobs, they'll
[01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:57.300]  put us in jail all day long.
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:40:04.700]  Well yeah and you know we were led to believe like ATF works with the police and when we
[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:09.540]  did some inquiring they said well we don't know what ATF is doing, they could be doing
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:10.900]  whatever they want to do.
[01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:13.900]  What was their claim, we need to check a serial number or something?
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:19.660]  No, I guess because we had purchased several guns in a short period of time.
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:24.220]  Oh yeah that's the new thing, if you buy even 100 rounds of ammo they come and visit you,
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:30.260]  like you're dirty and it's all harassment, I mean I see the reports all over the news
[01:40:30.260 --> 01:40:36.300]  where a veteran visited after he bought two new rifles and again it's all about you're
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:41.180]  bad, you're the perp, you're a criminal, you did something wrong, it's this new psychology
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:45.580]  that we're now going to learn how to do the perp walk, that's what TSA is all about,
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:49.340]  learning about lining up, learning about them putting their hands on you, where I live now
[01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:54.340]  has TSA checkpoints, totally illegal, violates the 10th amendment, the 4th amendment, they
[01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:55.340]  don't care.
[01:40:55.340 --> 01:41:03.220]  Yeah and my whole reason for calling today is what would be your advice on how to deal
[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:08.420]  with this situation because at the time I was at home and they spoke to my husband which
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:14.260]  I was the one that purchased the firearms and as far as I'm concerned they got all the information
[01:41:14.260 --> 01:41:15.260]  they needed to know.
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:21.260]  I know that's exactly it, you say this isn't a straw purchase, I bought the guns for us
[01:41:21.260 --> 01:41:26.100]  but I bought them legal and lawfully, you're here to try to create a criminal account,
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:32.620]  a criminal file on us, you know full well so just get on out of here and again these
[01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:37.540]  are the ones that shipped the guns to Mexico and outside of law they tell it was the gun
[01:41:37.540 --> 01:41:42.060]  shop that did it to you, when you buy two or more and they wanted a law two years ago
[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:45.620]  they couldn't get it passed so they just did it extra legislatively, this is a big
[01:41:45.620 --> 01:41:46.620]  issue.
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:52.180]  Now they're saying they may just ban guns without a law, just with a rule making and
[01:41:52.180 --> 01:41:56.700]  that's what they do and then they think you're ignorant, most of these gun arrests I'm seeing
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:42:01.460]  for a flash suppressor or something, they're not even illegal but the juries are so stupid
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:06.860]  they'll put you in jail for a wrong statute and the lawyers are also corrupt, they'll
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:11.140]  put you in jail and make you think you've got a deal, they want to give gun owners
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:16.940]  a record, I'm telling you folks it's a criminal purge, listen you could turn your guns in
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:22.500]  they're not going to stop, they're going to take, listen, heirs and others that were
[01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:27.380]  Obama's mentors, this came out in trials and we played the video clip of it being broken
[01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:31.340]  down, they said we're going to put 50 million Americans in forced labor and we're going
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:35.900]  to kill 25 million of them, their goal is to put us in camps and blow our heads off,
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:39.940]  I mean they want to do what they did in the Soviet Union and they will do it and the
[01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:44.180]  neocons are all a bunch of Trotskyites who helped Trotsky do what he did and they all
[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:49.300]  ran over here, Stalin kicked them out, they're going to try the same thing, these are authoritarians,
[01:42:49.300 --> 01:42:56.380]  folks this isn't rhetoric, we're in deep trouble, the government is run by evil people, they
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:43:01.060]  want a civil war against gun owners.
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:05.060]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses,
[01:43:05.060 --> 01:43:09.500]  don't be one of them, protect yourself with supernatural silver, a revolutionary new

[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:14.040]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce

[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:21.000]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:24.640]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:29.160]  You've got the life straw, so you can turn fetted water into safe water anywhere you
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:30.160]  go.
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.360]  The K-Tor hand crank generator to charge up key equipment during power outages or out
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:35.360]  in the field.
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:38.440]  Strategic relocation, third edition by Joel Scousum.
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:43.540]  When disaster strikes by Matthew Stein, they're a safe used by Homeland Security to protect
[01:46:43.540 --> 01:46:46.120]  yourself during any radiological event.
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.880]  Hand crank shortwave AMFM radios.
[01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:53.040]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at infowarshop.com
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.800]  and your purchase makes our info war possible.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:57.000]  We're getting prepared.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:02.080]  Are you infowarshop.com?
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:05.400]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:12.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:18.560]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:21.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:26.160]  Thomas Jefferson said the level of tyranny that you will live under is the exact amount
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:27.720]  you put up with.
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:34.160]  The government is run by real live authoritarians who have robbed countless third world countries,
[01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:36.880]  the IMF and World Bank.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:38.680]  They want to reeducate America.
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:43.000]  They want to start a civil war and Homeland Security was set up for the American people.
[01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:44.720]  It's a lot bigger than Obama.
[01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:47.360]  This is a long term strategic plan.
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.320]  The reason the Republican leadership is going along with all this globalism is because they're
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:54.600]  bought and paid for by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and others.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.440]  Now, I'm not saying this year they're going to come arrest all the gun owners, though
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:00.240]  they're harassing them and arresting veterans.
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:03.200]  In fact, here's one of the articles right here.
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:08.560]  It was just up on infowars.com, I actually was doing a search on it, where Army veteran
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:14.120]  arrested for 30-mile mag in New York State faces five felonies, had no criminal record.
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.920]  Those mags are illegal now.
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:19.960]  People are saying, well, we're going to defy it and gun shops are saying we're going to
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:20.960]  protest.
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:23.240]  Well, we'll fill the prisons and they will.
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:25.300]  They don't care.
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:30.560]  It's up to juries to nullify unconstitutional laws and it's time for these politicians
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:32.720]  to start getting arrested.
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.840]  They're setting themselves up as God.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:36.040]  It happens everywhere else.
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.640]  Look how decadent America is.
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:43.520]  But we're not all individually decadent and they think America's dumb.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.280]  They think we're done.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:49.280]  They think they can take over and I'm telling you, they're saying gun owners are responsible
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:56.440]  for all crime, we're Nazis, we're scum, we're trash, the government needs to defeat us.
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:59.680]  This is the nomenclature.
[01:48:59.680 --> 01:49:03.960]  Hitler didn't even say things about Jews like that until he'd been in office two or
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:04.960]  three years.
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:08.520]  He didn't even write things that radical.
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:13.040]  They're saying things publicly that Stalin didn't even say about groups.
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:15.200]  He was wiping out.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:17.200]  So we're being demonized.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:22.240]  I mean, can you imagine if they got up on the TV and call black people the n-word when
[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:25.720]  they're calling whites the crackers, whites are on there to create division and they're
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:29.320]  calling gun owners Nazis, you're being demonized.
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:35.000]  But you have American hospitality, you're like, oh, shucks, go ahead, no.
[01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:36.640]  And I mean, it's flooding in.
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:41.600]  People buying ammo are getting ATF visits and they go to people with no criminal records,
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.880]  upstanding members of the society.
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:47.880]  I even saw an article where they visited a cop's house who bought 500 rounds of ammo.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:51.360]  It's the idea that we're all bad, government's good.
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:56.440]  And the small federal family, as they call it, Janet calls it the federal family.
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:59.360]  What are they, Sicilian?
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:01.720]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:04.920]  Michael, in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:05.920]  Thanks for holding.
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:08.640]  Yes, I had a really quick idea.
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:14.720]  I think you ought to put a new sticker at the bottom of your new screen there that has
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:20.000]  the Bill of Rights, or you could also put the Constitution, because I'm an avid reader,
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.760]  I know a lot of people read and you have a lot of information, and this way it would
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:28.080]  just kind of nail it into these people's heads.
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:29.080]  I agree.
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:31.640]  You're talking on the TV shows, start having a scroll?
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.640]  Yes.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:33.640]  Yes.
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:34.640]  That makes sense.
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:37.880]  What do you think about the accelerating gun purge?
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:38.880]  I'm sorry, Collard?
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:49.240]  I said, yes, like they do, a new sticker for the New York Stock Exchange, and they do updates
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:50.240]  and all that.
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:51.240]  Sure.
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:54.360]  The Bill of Rights or the Constitution.
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:55.880]  Is that what you called in about?
[01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:56.880]  Yes.
[01:50:56.880 --> 01:51:04.840]  That was one of the things, and the other thing is, I remembered watching a movie where
[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:11.080]  it was called Kingdom of Heaven or something, and the night had everyone kneel, and he said,
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:15.840]  as of this day, I'm nighting you all, just get out of one knee and make this vote.
[01:51:15.840 --> 01:51:22.920]  I think deputies ought to just deputize their public like Barney Fife and Andy Griffith
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:23.920]  used to do.
[01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:27.160]  Yeah, the problem is, they've taken over most of the police departments.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:31.360]  We've got a lot of good sheriff's departments, because they at least know about the Constitution,
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.360]  and they're elected.
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:33.360]  That's the difference.
[01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.960]  They've said the people more and more.
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:40.800]  It's time for all of us to deputize ourselves before God and country to understand real authoritarianism
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:44.920]  has come to our shores, and the globalists think they can totally take over.
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.280]  God bless you, Michael.
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:48.080]  Let's go to Dan in Pennsylvania.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:49.760]  Dan, you're on the air.
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:50.760]  Welcome.
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:51.760]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:52.760]  Good, sir.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:53.760]  Thanks.
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:54.760]  You and your crew.
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:55.760]  Thank you for holding.
[01:51:55.760 --> 01:51:56.760]  Yeah.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:01.560]  I just was wondering if you have seen House Resolution that was introduced 437.
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:06.720]  It's the assault weapons ban of 2013, and also 449.
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:07.880]  It helps.
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:13.840]  It provides amnesty for the veterans to turn in their guns and register them in for other
[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:14.840]  purposes.
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:15.840]  It's really draconian.
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:16.840]  I know.
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:17.840]  I know.
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:22.360]  It talks about there's a bunch of gun confiscation assault weapons bans in there.
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:26.960]  It was in Feinstein's first version, and it's got language in it.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:28.240]  I don't think people understand.
[01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:32.360]  They're like, we just want to have reasonable background checks, and they've got gun bans
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.960]  where you've got to turn them in like New York just passed.
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:39.480]  Their goal is take our guns while they sit there going, we don't want to take your guns.
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:40.480]  We don't want to take your guns.
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.480]  They've done that everywhere.
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:45.000]  You know, they're now taking the single shots and bolt actions in Australia.
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:48.440]  See, first they take the semi-auto, then they take everything.
[01:52:48.440 --> 01:52:51.240]  What was the particular bill number on that one?
[01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:54.080]  That was 437.
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:59.320]  It's the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013, and it has the text up online, but there was also
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:00.320]  one other one.
[01:53:00.320 --> 01:53:02.880]  It's the House Resolution 40, I believe.
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:06.000]  I was trying to find it online again, and my computer froze up.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.000]  Yeah, we found it.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000]  Punch it up.
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  No, I've seen that one.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  Punch it back up for TV viewers.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  For radio listeners, just go to the Library of Congress.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  It's HR437.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:21.680]  Arm the military in D.C. There's a bill in there that says, you know, to arm the military
[01:53:21.680 --> 01:53:23.680]  in the District of Columbia.
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:24.680]  No, I know.
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:27.240]  And that's like Caesar bringing his troops into Rome.
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:33.920]  Look, they, in the NDAA bill that passed last year to supposedly reform it, it continues
[01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:37.360]  the Secret Arrest Provision and just gets rid of Posse Commentatus.
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:42.400]  That's what I'm telling people, folks, they are going whole hog, and that's why the Republicans
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:46.160]  have gotten real scared and like, yes, sir, whatever we're told, you're right, we're bad.
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:47.160]  You're right.
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:48.160]  You've got a mandate.
[01:53:48.160 --> 01:53:50.000]  It's because it is hammered down.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.680]  I mean, I've never been this concerned.
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:54.360]  This is not a game.
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:57.200]  This is a revolution by foreign banks.
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:58.200]  This is espionage.
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:53:59.200]  God bless you.
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:00.200]  Yes.
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.200]  Thank you for bringing that up.
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:02.200]  Yes.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:03.200]  I'm aware of it.
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:05.440]  That's what I'm telling people.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:07.040]  This isn't a game.
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:12.400]  By the way, you can buy the February issue of Info Wars Magazine on the cover.
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:17.520]  It says, why the tyrants want your guns, about 80% of the 60 page glossy magazine is on that
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:18.520]  subject.
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:22.040]  It explains how they're going to take your guns, why they want to take your guns, their
[01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:24.600]  strategy to do it, the strategy to beat them.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:27.840]  It is available at infowarsstore.com.
[01:54:27.840 --> 01:54:32.840]  That's infowarsstore.com or infowarshop.com also gets you there.
[01:54:32.840 --> 01:54:33.840]  And it's at cost.
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:37.000]  You can buy them in groups of 10 up to 100.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.400]  In fact, John Bowne was at the public library getting books for his daughter yesterday and
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:42.600]  said he saw a stack of them somebody put in there.
[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:43.600]  So good job, folks.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:48.080]  You can also get subscriptions at cost and you can give subscriptions, give subscriptions
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:49.800]  to people you want to wake up.
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:57.960]  There are 12 issues, good chance of waking them up, infowarsstore.com or call 888-253-3139.
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:55:02.240]  We've brought back the Obama joker tyrant shirt redesigned because the first one was
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:03.480]  a limited edition.
[01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:06.640]  So is this one of your purchase supports the broadcast?
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:09.640]  Let's talk to Zach in Tennessee.
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:13.120]  Zach in Tennessee, you are on the air, Zach.
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:14.120]  What is on your mind today?
[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:20.000]  Yes, sir, I was just holding from earlier, but I was going to tell you, did you see the
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.600]  Bill Gates article that he doesn't care about money and he goes on to say he's spiritual
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:25.600]  but doesn't believe in religion?
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:28.200]  Did you see that one?
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.200]  Yes, I did.
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:30.200]  Yes, I did.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:31.200]  They're bringing in an entire system.
[01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:32.200]  We'll look more into that.
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:36.240]  I'm telling you, it's a total global revolution, ladies and gentlemen, designing high tech
[01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.640]  to enslave us not to empower us.
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:39.640]  It's a total blueprint.
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:42.320]  It's called a technocracy in their own words.
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:48.080]  Let's talk to Zane in FEMA region three, formerly Virginia, now globalist occupied territory.
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:49.360]  Go ahead, Zane.
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:50.360]  You're welcome to the airwaves.
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:51.360]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:52.360]  How's it going now?
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:53.360]  Pretty good.
[01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:57.840]  I read an article, I work in one of the few factories left here in Virginia, and someone
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:04.080]  had posted this article, it was out of a magazine, and it was saying that the way they're going
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:08.080]  to get the gun grab is they're going to make it where you can't afford to have a gun.
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:11.080]  They're going to make you get insurance on your guns.
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:12.080]  Have you heard anything about that?
[01:56:12.080 --> 01:56:15.120]  No, they've got state and federal bills.
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:16.240]  Insurance is a power to tax.
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:18.320]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:21.520]  They're hitting us with a thousand torpedoes right now.
[01:56:21.520 --> 01:56:26.360]  They're hitting us from every single angle, and we've got to take their attack and show
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:30.760]  how they're authoritarians with bodyguards and how they've taken guns everywhere else
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:34.640]  and how this is a plan to enslave us and turn it back on them.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:37.080]  We have to go on the offense or we're going to lose everything.
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:43.040]  That's for sure, I am sick and I am tired, and everybody that hears this needs to be
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:44.040]  sick and tired.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:45.040]  Exactly.
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:47.480]  I mean, we are being enslaved.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.720]  Being upset is what got us our liberty.
[01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:51.560]  We need to get upset and awake again.
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:52.560]  God bless you.
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:53.800]  And I meant to get to this, and I didn't.
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:58.080]  I'll cover it tomorrow on The Weekday Show, NRA, Winning the Influence Battle over Gun
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:07.600]  Control, AppInions is one of the biggest data mining public groups, and the company breaks
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:12.440]  down off a variety of data mining what they found, and they have found that Second Amendment
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:19.160]  advocates are absolutely trouncing the gun grabbers, and this is a, again, non-partisan,
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:24.080]  non-political analysis of it, and it says gun rights advocates have more stamina than
[01:57:24.080 --> 01:57:25.840]  gun control advocates.
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:29.280]  Gun rights advocates show military coordination with laser focus.
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:33.040]  Well, yeah, because we're people that actually work and live in the real world.
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:38.240]  Any mainline person that supports gun control who isn't a tyrant is just a jellyfish.
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:41.120]  They think the government loves them and wants to help them.
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:44.840]  Government wants to inject you with cancer viruses and put you six feet under after you're
[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:45.840]  done working.
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.920]  All right, I'll see you back tomorrow at 11amCentralInfoWars.com.
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:55.920]  Great job, crew.
