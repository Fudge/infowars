[00:00.000 --> 00:13.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a massive broadcast coming up for you.
[00:13.280 --> 00:18.080]  Alex Jones is going to break down how the Federal Reserve is rigging the economy to
[00:18.080 --> 00:21.600]  stop the Trump America Revolution.
[00:21.600 --> 00:26.480]  But first, yes, you've seen the Mueller testimony and everything the Democrats have gotten
[00:26.480 --> 00:27.480]  away with.
[00:27.480 --> 00:30.360]  It's above the law.
[00:30.360 --> 00:35.560]  Benjamin Franklin once said, whatever begins in anger ends in shame.
[00:35.560 --> 00:41.160]  That shame born of anger for losing the 2016 election was on full display, and the Democrats
[00:41.160 --> 00:47.120]  couldn't have made the tiny impeachment fantasy world they carved out for themselves any clearer.
[00:47.120 --> 00:51.560]  He may be the first president in quite some time to face the real prospect of jail time.
[00:51.560 --> 00:57.680]  By the time we get to 2020, Donald Trump may not even be president.
[00:57.680 --> 01:01.760]  In fact, he may not even be a free person.
[01:01.760 --> 01:04.880]  Do you believe the president right now has been an agent of the Russians?
[01:04.880 --> 01:05.880]  Yes.
[01:05.880 --> 01:09.280]  The president's chant of no obstruction is nonsense.
[01:09.280 --> 01:15.360]  His chant that he's been totally exonerated is a simple lie.
[01:15.360 --> 01:16.360]  Prosecutors don't exonerate.
[01:16.360 --> 01:19.320]  The legal standard in the United States is not exoneration.
[01:19.320 --> 01:22.280]  You're found guilty or not guilty.
[01:22.280 --> 01:26.960]  And if we thought we could exonerate him, we would do so.
[01:26.960 --> 01:28.960]  He never had that authority in the first place.
[01:28.960 --> 01:32.520]  You didn't use the word impeachable conduct like Starr did.
[01:32.520 --> 01:37.640]  There was no statute to prevent you from using the word impeachable conduct.
[01:37.640 --> 01:43.160]  And I go back to what Mr. Radcliffe said, and that is that even the president is innocent
[01:43.160 --> 01:45.120]  until proven guilty.
[01:45.120 --> 01:50.680]  After finally wheeling in their savior, special counsel for the bogus Russia investigation
[01:50.680 --> 01:56.080]  Robert Mueller, who would prove to us all that he is ripe for retirement and was in
[01:56.080 --> 02:01.560]  desperate need for an afternoon nap rather than an intensive grilling on the hill.
[02:01.560 --> 02:05.520]  When did you become aware that the unverified Steele dossier was included in the FISA application
[02:05.520 --> 02:08.080]  to spy on Carter Page?
[02:08.080 --> 02:10.680]  I'm sorry, what was the question?
[02:10.680 --> 02:17.560]  When did you become aware that the unverified Steele dossier was included in the FISA application
[02:17.560 --> 02:19.280]  to spy on Carter Page?
[02:19.280 --> 02:22.520]  I'm not going to speak to that.
[02:22.520 --> 02:24.400]  Your team interviewed Christopher Steele, is that correct?
[02:24.400 --> 02:25.920]  I'm not going to get into that.
[02:25.920 --> 02:30.920]  You can't tell this committee as to whether or not you interviewed Christopher Steele
[02:30.920 --> 02:33.760]  in a 22 month investigation with 18 lawyers.
[02:33.760 --> 02:36.720]  Mueller fumbled through an investigation he barely understood.
[02:36.720 --> 02:39.080]  I'm not going to talk about that.
[02:39.080 --> 02:40.480]  I'm not going to speak to that.
[02:40.480 --> 02:41.480]  I'm not going to speak to that.
[02:41.480 --> 02:42.480]  I have no idea.
[02:42.480 --> 02:47.480]  Don't recall that one.
[02:47.480 --> 02:52.960]  Wielding the nonsense word exoneration, goaded into appearing by Jerry Nadler and the true
[02:52.960 --> 02:56.360]  author of the Mueller investigation, Andrew Wiseman.
[02:56.360 --> 02:57.360]  The irony?
[02:57.360 --> 03:03.640]  Mueller was surrounded by lawyers that protected Hillary Clinton's email scandal, Hillary ultimately
[03:03.640 --> 03:06.680]  being the catalyst for the entire witch hunt.
[03:06.680 --> 03:11.160]  The Democrats' battle cry, no one is above the law.
[03:11.160 --> 03:16.000]  Any other person who acted in this way would have been charged with crimes.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.680]  And in this nation, not even the president is above the law.
[03:20.680 --> 03:25.720]  Volume 2 of this report was not authorized under the law to be written.
[03:25.720 --> 03:29.640]  It was written to a legal standard that does not exist at the Justice Department.
[03:29.640 --> 03:35.200]  And it was written in violation of every DOJ principle about extra prosecutorial commentary.
[03:35.200 --> 03:39.400]  I agree with the chairman this morning when he said Donald Trump is not above the law.
[03:39.400 --> 03:40.400]  He's not.
[03:40.400 --> 03:44.560]  But he damn sure shouldn't be below the law, which is where Volume 2 of this report puts
[03:44.560 --> 03:45.560]  him.
[03:45.560 --> 03:48.440]  Meanwhile, the Clinton body death count rises unimpeded.
[03:48.440 --> 03:53.880]  Where is the oversight regarding the FBI documents uncovered by Judicial Watch back in April
[03:53.880 --> 03:59.360]  in a folder literally labeled the Clinton cover-up operation, implicating the Obama
[03:59.360 --> 04:01.960]  White House and Barack Obama?
[04:01.960 --> 04:08.040]  This is the true cover-up and obstruction of justice undermining the rule of law.
[04:08.040 --> 04:10.560]  John Bowne reporting.
[04:10.560 --> 04:22.600]  Now, Jeffrey Epstein and Hillary Clinton have been above the law for some time now.
[04:22.600 --> 04:27.880]  It's amazing how Trump all of a sudden is a racist, xenophobe, and even criminal as
[04:27.880 --> 04:29.360]  soon as he becomes president.
[04:29.360 --> 04:36.840]  Folks, Donald Trump is putting America first and the Federal Reserve is trying to ratchet
[04:36.840 --> 04:39.840]  down the growth of the U.S. economy right now.
[04:39.840 --> 04:44.760]  The U.S. dollar, J.P. Morgan Chase is warning, oh, the U.S. dollar is getting weaker, might
[04:44.760 --> 04:45.760]  not be the world reserve.
[04:45.760 --> 04:47.480]  Well, that's all manipulated.
[04:47.480 --> 04:51.760]  Alex Jones is going to explain it all on the other side of this break.
[04:51.760 --> 04:52.760]  Don't go anywhere.
[04:52.760 --> 05:00.960]  This is The Alex Jones Show at infowars.com slash show.
[05:00.960 --> 05:04.880]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[05:04.880 --> 05:09.400]  The other thing that's unique about Infowars is it is the only network of this reach that
[05:09.400 --> 05:12.640]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[05:12.640 --> 05:14.400]  That's not backed by some billionaire.
[05:14.400 --> 05:16.760]  That's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[05:16.760 --> 05:18.480]  It is completely independent of all that.
[05:18.480 --> 05:24.200]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[05:24.200 --> 05:28.040]  and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[05:28.040 --> 05:32.400]  the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[05:32.400 --> 05:34.400]  because this was the kind of press they wanted.
[05:34.400 --> 05:37.760]  And then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[05:37.760 --> 05:41.760]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[05:41.760 --> 05:45.760]  what news and views the person's allowed to have or express or hear.
[05:45.760 --> 05:47.960]  And the Infowars audience has broken through that.
[05:47.960 --> 05:52.880]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[05:52.880 --> 05:53.880]  freedom.
[05:53.880 --> 05:57.640]  And that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation,
[05:57.640 --> 06:27.600]  lawfare and libel targeting youth.
[06:27.600 --> 06:35.840]  We live in a fiat economy.
[06:35.840 --> 06:41.360]  In the last hundred years, private banks have taken over the operation and functioning
[06:41.360 --> 06:47.360]  of the treasury departments of every major European and Western government.
[06:47.360 --> 06:56.320]  They then parlayed that into tens upon tens of trillions of dollars of debt created and
[06:56.320 --> 07:02.440]  foisted on the people's back that they then parlay into global domination.
[07:02.440 --> 07:06.160]  Trump understands that we're way past the point of no return dealing with the debt.
[07:06.160 --> 07:10.800]  And we need to keep the dollars, the world reserve currency while rebuilding our industry
[07:10.800 --> 07:15.520]  and military and love of our culture so we won't be overtaken by the chai comms in the
[07:15.520 --> 07:20.600]  EU and the project that they've developed to demoralize the United States and the West
[07:20.600 --> 07:24.560]  then collapse our borders, flood us with third world populations that have been brainwashed
[07:24.560 --> 07:29.480]  against us and our journey into world government servitude will be complete.
[07:29.480 --> 07:34.640]  But that plan is being thwarted from Brazil to the United States, from Greece to Italy
[07:34.640 --> 07:40.600]  to Japan to South Korea, all over the world, populations understand the score.
[07:40.600 --> 07:47.360]  So yes, Trump to a great extent has abandoned fiscal responsibility because it's been abandoned
[07:47.360 --> 07:52.320]  worldwide and we're in a devaluation race.
[07:52.320 --> 07:56.600]  And it has way, way, way, way more devalue their currency than we have.
[07:56.600 --> 08:00.680]  And if we allow them to continue to do that without us countering it, they will continue
[08:00.680 --> 08:04.480]  to dominate our economy with a 10% growth rate while we have a 3%.
[08:04.480 --> 08:10.440]  Now, the Federal Reserve wouldn't have raised interest rates eight times last year on the
[08:10.440 --> 08:11.640]  last two years.
[08:11.640 --> 08:18.360]  We would have had probably a 4.8, 4.9% growth rate was estimated.
[08:18.360 --> 08:20.520]  We got up to 3.4.
[08:20.520 --> 08:25.560]  Now you've seen the central banks and the private fellow reserve and J.P. Morgan, that's
[08:25.560 --> 08:28.680]  a shareholder, come out and say that, oh, we could lose the World Reserve currency.
[08:28.680 --> 08:30.400]  Oh, America's going to have a crash.
[08:30.400 --> 08:32.120]  Oh, America's going down.
[08:32.120 --> 08:35.480]  Now they announced the revised numbers.
[08:35.480 --> 08:42.400]  Now they announced the new information, ladies and gentlemen, that, oh, because of what's
[08:42.400 --> 08:47.040]  happened, the GDP is at 2.1%.
[08:47.040 --> 08:53.240]  3% growth fee undone by data revisions.
[08:53.240 --> 08:57.920]  But we've had over 3% growth rate for the first two years as Presidency.
[08:57.920 --> 09:02.280]  Now they're revising back saying, oh, look, he didn't really do that.
[09:02.280 --> 09:07.760]  Now the economy sucks to kill the confidence and bring it down.
[09:07.760 --> 09:10.600]  So yes, it's an artificial system.
[09:10.600 --> 09:16.160]  He's trying to make there be more robust profits for the average person.
[09:16.160 --> 09:21.080]  So we actually can pay off some of our debts and actually build some infrastructure.
[09:21.080 --> 09:23.960]  But we're damned if we do, we're damned if we don't.
[09:23.960 --> 09:28.440]  But regardless, we're in the hands of the global private banking cartel that is now
[09:28.440 --> 09:35.720]  trying to strangle our economy and our national sovereignty and our borders and our flag and
[09:35.720 --> 09:40.120]  the term America or American.
[09:40.120 --> 09:41.280]  This is what conquerors do.
[09:41.280 --> 09:43.600]  This is what outside enemies do.
[09:43.600 --> 09:45.800]  And now they're doing it.
[09:45.800 --> 09:49.880]  Now coming up here on the live broadcast today with Owen Schreuer, I'll be back Sunday
[09:49.880 --> 09:56.600]  in studio at 4 to 6 PM Lord Welling, I'm going to lay out a Peggy Noonan article from the
[09:56.600 --> 10:03.200]  Wall Street Journal where she admits, where the Wall Street Journal admits that the Jacobin
[10:03.200 --> 10:09.880]  Revolution was an anti-God, anti-family human enslavement program of control freaks now
[10:09.880 --> 10:15.080]  being carried out in 2019 in the West.
[10:15.080 --> 10:21.560]  And it shows that the academics of the establishment are turning against the system that they originally
[10:21.560 --> 10:22.560]  signed on to.
[10:22.560 --> 10:29.720]  Because it's not just Alex Jones and it's not just Lord Moncton that know that the
[10:29.720 --> 10:33.520]  French Revolution was the precursor of the Communist, that the very same institutions
[10:33.520 --> 10:39.120]  and groups financed the takedown of Russia and China and are trying it now.
[10:39.120 --> 10:42.520]  People are taught this in college, who are part of the establishment.
[10:42.520 --> 10:48.080]  And I've said this many times, I'm not even trying to get by that on the air though, he's
[10:48.080 --> 10:52.880]  not an extrovert these days, like he used to be, he's more of an introvert.
[10:52.880 --> 10:56.240]  But my dad told me all of this when I was a little kid.
[10:56.240 --> 11:01.440]  He gave me books about the French Revolution, he explained how the communists operate and
[11:01.440 --> 11:04.360]  it's just all mainline history.
[11:04.360 --> 11:08.480]  And so Peggy Noonan knows full well when she puts this article out and behaves like she
[11:08.480 --> 11:14.320]  just discovered this, that this is mainline history at the academic PhD level.
[11:14.320 --> 11:16.920]  And so everybody needs to just grow up, and I'm not talking about our audience, but the
[11:16.920 --> 11:22.760]  general public that makes jokes, please just grow up and realize that this system is designed
[11:22.760 --> 11:24.880]  to enslave humanity, not empower it.
[11:24.880 --> 11:30.480]  We know communism enslaves and it's done by ultra rich who manipulate populations off
[11:30.480 --> 11:31.480]  against each other.
[11:31.480 --> 11:37.000]  And we have no future if we don't stand against this, now I want to go to a report and then
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.840]  back to Owen of Rand Paul talking to Breitbart, and I like the way he splits the baby.
[11:41.840 --> 11:46.720]  Instead of saying we're going to deport Ilhan Omar, she has to first be found fraudulent
[11:46.720 --> 11:52.200]  in her citizenship and her name, and that criminal investigation has now begun.
[11:52.200 --> 11:57.880]  How about we just all invite her to pay for a junket to fly her for a few months back
[11:57.880 --> 12:03.280]  to Somalia with a tour guide and show us how great it is, of course you can't get a tour
[12:03.280 --> 12:07.920]  guide because there's seven tribes, and if you go in any area outside your tribal area
[12:07.920 --> 12:13.880]  your kidnapped or killed, but we should really encourage her, since America is so horrible,
[12:13.880 --> 12:18.280]  to go back to Somalia for a few months and just experience how wonderful it is and travel
[12:18.280 --> 12:21.280]  through the seven tribal areas.
[12:21.280 --> 12:28.440]  Again, here is Senator Rand Paul laying it all out, full video and audio is on infowars.com
[12:28.440 --> 12:33.760]  and newswars.com, but we are living in an extremely historic time, and coming up at
[12:33.760 --> 12:42.360]  the start of the next hour, I will air my breakdown of the true history of the Illuminati,
[12:42.360 --> 12:47.040]  the Jacobins, the communists, and what their plans are for America, because knowing who
[12:47.040 --> 12:51.160]  your enemies are and knowing history is half the battle.
[12:51.160 --> 12:52.160]  That's not just a G.I.
[12:52.160 --> 12:56.040]  Joe saying that's a military term, that knowing the enemy's plans is half the battle.
[12:56.040 --> 13:00.080]  In fact, no one even knows who first said that at so many thousands of years old.
[13:00.080 --> 13:03.520]  Knowing is half the battle, then having the will and the personnel and the people ready
[13:03.520 --> 13:06.720]  to take action, having the mass is winning the battle.
[13:06.720 --> 13:11.120]  Well we have that and we have God on our sides, my friends, but we have to know the enemy,
[13:11.120 --> 13:15.440]  and we have to know history or we're doomed to repeat it, so that's coming up next hour.
[13:15.440 --> 13:22.640]  Believe me, it's important because the Wall Street Journal admits the Illuminati roots of
[13:22.640 --> 13:27.080]  the French Revolution and the modern left and communism worldwide.
[13:27.080 --> 13:28.080]  It's all coming up.
[13:28.080 --> 13:32.280]  Now back to Owen Schreuer and the rest of the crew in the ATX.
[13:32.280 --> 13:36.440]  I'm in a town where we have a lot of people who are refugees who have come, some from
[13:36.440 --> 13:38.640]  Somalia, some from Bosnia.
[13:38.640 --> 13:43.720]  I've never heard one of them say that America is a terrible place or be unappreciative of
[13:43.720 --> 13:44.720]  our country.
[13:44.720 --> 13:45.720]  Most of them are thankful.
[13:45.720 --> 13:50.080]  I've met people who have come here from behind the Iron Curtain that got away from communism.
[13:50.080 --> 13:53.360]  They're some of the best Americans we have because they really appreciate how great our
[13:53.360 --> 13:54.360]  country is.
[13:54.360 --> 13:59.360]  And then I hear Representative Omar say, oh America is a terrible place, I'd love to
[13:59.360 --> 14:01.240]  be justice and there's no justice here.
[14:01.240 --> 14:07.480]  It's like she came here and we fed her, we clothed her, she got welfare, she got school,
[14:07.480 --> 14:12.480]  she got health care, and then lo and behold she has the honor of actually winning a seat
[14:12.480 --> 14:16.360]  in Congress and she says we're a terrible country, I think that's about as ungrateful
[14:16.360 --> 14:17.560]  as you can get.
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.120]  And so while I'm not saying we forcibly send her anywhere, I'm willing to contribute to
[14:22.120 --> 14:26.960]  buy her a ticket to go visit Somalia and I think she could look and maybe learn a little
[14:26.960 --> 14:31.800]  bit about the disaster that is Somalia that has no capitalism, has no God-given rights
[14:31.800 --> 14:35.640]  guaranteed in a constitution, and has about seven different tribes that have been fighting
[14:35.640 --> 14:37.560]  each other for the last 40 years.
[14:37.560 --> 14:41.280]  And then maybe after she's visited Somalia for a while she might come back and appreciate
[14:41.280 --> 14:42.280]  America more.
[14:42.280 --> 14:52.160]  All right, there you have it folks, and of course you have Ilhan Omar in a 2012 tweet
[14:52.160 --> 14:55.640]  telling people to go back from where they came from.
[14:55.640 --> 15:02.240]  You have Ilhan Omar in an interview, I think it was a few months back that's going viral
[15:02.240 --> 15:07.920]  now where she's saying white people need to be profiled, white people are the problem.
[15:07.920 --> 15:13.120]  And so Ilhan Omar is just an ungrateful, racist, spoiled brat.
[15:13.120 --> 15:18.720]  But that's the new Democrat party, you see, with AOC up there.
[15:18.720 --> 15:21.760]  Meeting with Pelosi today, probably making demands.
[15:21.760 --> 15:28.440]  So there's all kinds of news we'll get to, we'll hear from Alex again and we will probably
[15:28.440 --> 15:33.960]  be taking some phone calls here on this Friday as well to get your reaction to all of the
[15:33.960 --> 15:34.960]  news.
[15:34.960 --> 15:40.800]  And Google gets a warning shot from Trump today on Twitter, Tulsi Gabbard suing Google.
[15:40.800 --> 15:46.560]  So you've got big tech news as well, more developments in the Epstein case, Google actively
[15:46.560 --> 15:51.120]  censoring the Clinton body count now, again, just like Twitter did.
[15:51.120 --> 15:56.320]  So the wheels are moving, ladies and gentlemen, the wheels are moving and we'll give it all
[15:56.320 --> 16:26.280]  the commentary on the other side.
[16:27.320 --> 16:29.360]  Dan pillow dot com.
[16:29.360 --> 16:33.160]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the US.
[16:33.160 --> 16:37.880]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally
[16:37.880 --> 16:39.840]  at heart and body extract.
[16:39.840 --> 16:43.000]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[16:43.000 --> 16:47.880]  Don't just take my word for it, check out all of the success stories at HBXTrack.com
[16:47.880 --> 16:56.800]  or to order call 866-295-5305, that's 866-295-5305, HBXTrack.com.
[16:56.800 --> 16:58.920]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[16:58.920 --> 17:03.480]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[17:03.480 --> 17:05.400]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[17:05.400 --> 17:07.120]  I had a problem like you once.
[17:07.120 --> 17:12.560]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[17:12.560 --> 17:13.680]  my life.
[17:13.680 --> 17:18.920]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[17:18.920 --> 17:24.120]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[17:24.120 --> 17:27.280]  you need to call the national treatment advisors.
[17:27.280 --> 17:31.960]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits
[17:31.960 --> 17:34.280]  and totally change your life.
[17:34.280 --> 17:39.520]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[17:39.520 --> 17:42.800]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[17:42.800 --> 17:43.800]  Get clean.
[17:43.800 --> 18:00.560]  Call now and learn more, 800-506-6740, 800-506-6740, that's 800-506-6740.
[18:00.560 --> 18:01.800]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[18:01.800 --> 18:02.800]  Marcus, you're on the air.
[18:02.800 --> 18:03.800]  Thanks for holding.
[18:03.800 --> 18:06.400]  Hey, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[18:06.400 --> 18:10.320]  I talk to a lot of people here in New York City and one thing I can tell you is that
[18:10.320 --> 18:12.520]  almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.520 --> 18:16.960]  I think that the neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know
[18:16.960 --> 18:21.200]  that that's the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public approaching
[18:21.200 --> 18:22.200]  2020.
[18:22.200 --> 18:23.200]  That's it.
[18:23.200 --> 18:25.320]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[18:25.320 --> 18:28.120]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:28.120 --> 18:29.400]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.400 --> 18:30.400]  I agree entirely.
[18:30.400 --> 18:33.600]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[18:33.600 --> 18:35.520]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.520 --> 18:38.520]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[18:38.520 --> 18:40.720]  I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.720 --> 18:43.960]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.960 --> 18:48.560]  You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself and many others
[18:48.560 --> 18:49.880]  who are going to continue.
[18:49.880 --> 18:51.800]  We're going to keep fighting in the input war.
[18:51.800 --> 18:55.840]  And even if something does happen to you or your show, know for a fact that you've gotten
[18:55.840 --> 18:58.320]  a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:58.320 --> 19:01.320]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[19:01.320 --> 19:05.240]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people, but I've decided that
[19:05.240 --> 19:08.960]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[19:08.960 --> 19:12.480]  before all the censorship of the tax and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about
[19:12.480 --> 19:16.160]  how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were, and I'd have doctors
[19:16.160 --> 19:18.120]  on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[19:18.120 --> 19:21.440]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[19:21.440 --> 19:22.440]  shut us down.
[19:22.440 --> 19:24.840]  The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[19:24.840 --> 19:25.840]  wonderful they were.
[19:25.840 --> 19:27.640]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[19:27.640 --> 19:31.960]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[19:31.960 --> 19:37.280]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[19:37.280 --> 19:40.640]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it, but then they say you've
[19:40.640 --> 19:42.560]  got to say it's not approved by them.
[19:42.560 --> 19:46.320]  And all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate
[19:46.320 --> 19:47.320]  it and do different things.
[19:47.320 --> 19:48.600]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[19:48.600 --> 19:52.560]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[19:52.560 --> 20:08.840]  God's medicine chest info or store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one,
[20:08.840 --> 20:17.840]  three, nine, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:17.840 --> 20:41.440]  We're going to be hearing from Alex again before the broadcast is over.
[20:41.440 --> 20:48.720]  I'm going through the list of video clips here, going through the stacks of news, trying
[20:48.720 --> 20:55.260]  to decide where to begin here on this Friday.
[20:55.260 --> 21:04.840]  And there's really so much, but what encapsulates the current state of events?
[21:04.840 --> 21:12.000]  What encapsulates the current state of affairs politically in America today?
[21:12.000 --> 21:18.760]  And it really is the failed Mueller testimony, which of course is a distraction.
[21:18.760 --> 21:24.160]  It's all a big hoax, the whole thing.
[21:24.160 --> 21:30.800]  But to curious minds who just observe this from a neutral perspective, they're asking
[21:30.800 --> 21:36.440]  themselves, who are all these Democrat senators and congressmen that have been claiming they
[21:36.440 --> 21:37.440]  have evidence?
[21:37.440 --> 21:39.880]  They've literally claimed multiple times, dozens of times.
[21:39.880 --> 21:40.880]  We have the evidence.
[21:40.880 --> 21:41.880]  We have physical evidence.
[21:41.880 --> 21:42.880]  We've seen the proof.
[21:42.880 --> 21:44.200]  We know it for a fact.
[21:44.200 --> 21:45.680]  Trump colluded with Russia.
[21:45.680 --> 21:48.520]  Where's the evidence?
[21:48.520 --> 21:52.960]  Mueller with dozens of attorneys, years of investigations.
[21:52.960 --> 21:57.000]  Can't find that evidence.
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.960]  And then during the hearings, when you've got the guy right in front of you, you don't
[21:59.960 --> 22:02.640]  present any evidence.
[22:02.640 --> 22:04.760]  Mueller doesn't know what the heck's going on.
[22:04.760 --> 22:13.360]  You've got, and this is the most incredible thing, MSNBC, CNN, all of them.
[22:13.360 --> 22:14.680]  Mueller failed us.
[22:14.680 --> 22:16.180]  Mueller was weak.
[22:16.180 --> 22:17.360]  Where's the collusion?
[22:17.360 --> 22:19.480]  Where's the evidence?
[22:19.480 --> 22:20.480]  There's nothing.
[22:20.480 --> 22:27.400]  Well, you guys are the ones that have been selling it.
[22:27.400 --> 22:33.920]  Hey, that's just a sideshow.
[22:33.920 --> 22:38.600]  The question is, why would the Democrats engage in such fraud?
[22:38.600 --> 22:47.880]  Why would they have a fake investigation to try and destroy one man?
[22:47.880 --> 22:49.680]  And by the way, they're not stopping.
[22:49.680 --> 22:56.320]  They're now subpoenaing everybody and anybody, Ivanka, Jared, McGahn's the big name they're
[22:56.320 --> 22:58.800]  going to build up.
[22:58.800 --> 23:00.160]  And what is it all about?
[23:00.160 --> 23:01.960]  What is really motivating this?
[23:01.960 --> 23:05.900]  What is really the driving force?
[23:05.900 --> 23:07.960]  They hate Trump.
[23:07.960 --> 23:10.160]  They can't stand the fact he got elected.
[23:10.160 --> 23:16.800]  And at the very top of the power structure, Trump is not in the secret societies.
[23:16.800 --> 23:19.160]  Trump is not in the sex cult orgies.
[23:19.160 --> 23:21.440]  Trump is not going to pedophile islands.
[23:21.440 --> 23:26.600]  Trump is not blackmailed to the hilt like the rest of them.
[23:26.600 --> 23:32.560]  Seriously, we have this whole thing where we're not even instinctual anymore.
[23:32.560 --> 23:40.560]  Just look at an Adam Schiff lying to your face, being the most two-faced double standard
[23:40.560 --> 23:48.400]  hypocrite you could ever imagine sitting here, puffing his chest, I've got the evidence.
[23:48.400 --> 23:56.400]  I've seen the evidence, hasn't produced any of it, sits on this committee and says anyone
[23:56.400 --> 24:03.680]  who's willing to look for foreign intelligence against a presidential candidate is a criminal.
[24:03.680 --> 24:12.280]  And then it's literally a recorded phone call of him doing just that.
[24:12.280 --> 24:19.680]  You don't just, you're not just a bull face liar because it's fun.
[24:19.680 --> 24:26.000]  You don't just lie through your teeth because it's advantageous for you personally.
[24:26.000 --> 24:29.000]  No, no, no, no, no.
[24:29.000 --> 24:32.320]  There's something wicked behind that.
[24:32.320 --> 24:37.840]  There's something evil behind that.
[24:37.840 --> 24:49.440]  And so I think America is just asking themselves today, why are these people such frauds?
[24:49.440 --> 24:57.960]  And maybe, just maybe, when all this information comes out about the nix of them sex cult and
[24:57.960 --> 25:03.800]  when all the information comes out about Jeffrey Epstein's little black book, maybe it'll
[25:03.800 --> 25:08.400]  all start to make a little bit more sense.
[25:08.400 --> 25:14.280]  Maybe when it all comes out about how Barack Obama committed treason when he illegally
[25:14.280 --> 25:24.800]  spied, maybe it'll all come out then, maybe it'll all make sense then.
[25:24.800 --> 25:30.920]  And then maybe, just maybe, we can hope and we can pray that that will ease some of the
[25:30.920 --> 25:36.240]  political tensions in this country when one side of the aisle realizes they've been duped,
[25:36.240 --> 25:44.920]  they've been fooled, they've been tricked, they've been bamboozled, but you know, you
[25:44.920 --> 25:52.120]  kind of sit here and say, if you haven't realized that by now, you either never will or you
[25:52.120 --> 25:54.680]  don't want to.
[25:54.680 --> 26:01.440]  You've consciously gone with the side of evil.
[26:01.440 --> 26:08.400]  And so we made all the connections yesterday with Epstein, the Clintons, the Deep State,
[26:08.400 --> 26:17.960]  Mueller, and then a strange situation with an FBI agent in charge of investigating financial
[26:17.960 --> 26:25.760]  fraud like the Clinton Foundation has no doubt been engaged in.
[26:25.760 --> 26:29.000]  And it just continues to pile up.
[26:29.000 --> 26:36.000]  And you see, that's the big story, not a fake Russia collusion narrative.
[26:36.000 --> 26:37.840]  That's the big distraction.
[26:37.840 --> 26:45.920]  That's the big false narrative, fake investigation to try to destroy Donald Trump.
[26:45.920 --> 26:51.280]  That's the truth of Russian collusion.
[26:51.280 --> 27:01.520]  But they can't admit that because then even the lowest IQ leftist would have to admit
[27:01.520 --> 27:03.720]  that yes, they were on the side of the criminals.
[27:03.720 --> 27:07.920]  But again, I think they want that now.
[27:07.920 --> 27:11.760]  They give them the right to go out and engage in domestic terror.
[27:11.760 --> 27:16.440]  They're now using quick creed and milkshakes to throw at people like at the brick.
[27:16.440 --> 27:19.320]  That's assault with a deadly weapon.
[27:19.320 --> 27:21.760]  They're talking about putting acid.
[27:21.760 --> 27:25.280]  They've tried to do that before at conservative events.
[27:25.280 --> 27:27.400]  They firebomb ICE facilities.
[27:27.400 --> 27:32.920]  They attack Republican headquarters, thousands of assaults now against Trump supporters.
[27:32.920 --> 27:35.640]  I mean, this is the modern day Democrat Party.
[27:35.640 --> 27:38.720]  I'll say it a thousand times till I'm blue in the face.
[27:38.720 --> 27:45.000]  The Democrat Party is the largest domestic terror group in the United States of America.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.680]  I will have this debate with anybody and you can't beat me in this.
[27:48.680 --> 27:53.880]  They've been caught by Project Veritas admitting they start riots.
[27:53.880 --> 27:58.840]  They are on tape saying, get in Trump supporters faces, make a crowd.
[27:58.840 --> 28:00.280]  We kicked them when they're down.
[28:00.280 --> 28:05.400]  This is all the Democrat rhetoric and then their supporters go out and do it.
[28:05.400 --> 28:09.520]  Yes, the Democrats are a domestic terror group.
[28:09.520 --> 28:13.320]  Yes, the Democrats are the largest hate group in America.
[28:13.320 --> 28:16.360]  Absolutely 110% cut and dry.
[28:16.360 --> 28:18.880]  No argument.
[28:18.880 --> 28:21.800]  But what's the problem?
[28:21.800 --> 28:26.800]  The problem is the mainstream television media is never going to say any of this because
[28:26.800 --> 28:31.800]  they're in bed with them for whatever reason, whatever makes them bedfellows.
[28:31.800 --> 28:34.840]  Maybe it's literally what they do in bed at night.
[28:34.840 --> 28:36.080]  Maybe it's a political thing.
[28:36.080 --> 28:37.840]  Maybe it's an ideological thing.
[28:37.840 --> 28:38.840]  Maybe they're all blackmailed.
[28:38.840 --> 28:39.840]  I don't know.
[28:39.840 --> 28:42.800]  I call it as I see it.
[28:42.800 --> 28:46.360]  You see Democrats lying to your face.
[28:46.360 --> 28:49.280]  You see mainstream media going along with it.
[28:49.280 --> 28:51.320]  You have a brain in your head.
[28:51.320 --> 28:53.000]  You have two eyes.
[28:53.000 --> 29:21.520]  You have instincts, go with them, you know who these people are.

[31:07.360 --> 31:08.360]  heritage.
[31:08.360 --> 31:14.800]  Together, we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[31:14.800 --> 31:20.200]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they
[31:20.200 --> 31:24.600]  know is right and what they know is true.
[31:24.600 --> 31:31.000]  As long as we stay true to our codes, as long as we remember our great history, as long
[31:31.000 --> 31:38.320]  as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America
[31:38.320 --> 31:51.040]  can not do.
[31:51.040 --> 31:56.040]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today, full power of the republic in the name of Jesus Christ,
[31:56.040 --> 31:57.040]  full power!
[31:57.040 --> 32:00.520]  Damn the torpedoes, go straight at them.
[32:00.520 --> 32:06.000]  Before I started working at Infowars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and Infowars.com,
[32:06.000 --> 32:10.480]  but also the products at Infowarsstore.com, and there's one product that's offered at
[32:10.480 --> 32:15.880]  Infowarsstore.com that is the elite of the supplements, and that's DNA Force Plus.
[32:15.880 --> 32:19.920]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[32:19.920 --> 32:23.680]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[32:23.680 --> 32:28.560]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve
[32:28.560 --> 32:32.080]  your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[32:32.080 --> 32:35.520]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive.
[32:35.520 --> 32:36.520]  Why?
[32:36.520 --> 32:38.640]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[32:38.640 --> 32:42.640]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[32:42.640 --> 32:48.920]  telomere support, and they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[32:48.920 --> 32:50.400]  It is the elite supplement.
[32:50.400 --> 32:55.200]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive, so you should
[32:55.200 --> 33:03.520]  take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at Infowarsstore.com.
[33:03.520 --> 33:10.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:10.520 --> 33:24.080]  I want to thank all of you for tuning in during this live Friday edition.
[33:24.080 --> 33:25.800]  Again, Alex Jones here.
[33:25.800 --> 33:29.800]  I will be back in studio this Sunday at 4 to 6 p.m.
[33:29.800 --> 33:30.800]  Please don't forget.
[33:30.800 --> 33:34.000]  We have Clown World coverage of the Democrat debates.
[33:34.000 --> 33:35.680]  Now dangerous these people are.
[33:35.680 --> 33:39.200]  Clown World 2, Meet America's Enemies is the official name.
[33:39.200 --> 33:44.720]  Find all the live feeds at clownworld.us and please spread them because you are the resistance,
[33:44.720 --> 33:49.600]  you are the modern Paul Revere's, and that's this Tuesday evening right through the next
[33:49.600 --> 33:53.760]  day on Wednesday outside of all the regular shows we do.
[33:53.760 --> 33:59.720]  David Knight, 8 a.m., myself 11 a.m., Owen Schreuer, 3 p.m. all times central.
[33:59.720 --> 34:05.480]  And lastly, if we had the funds to expand and if we had the funds to be operating, I
[34:05.480 --> 34:11.560]  would not be coming to you during the ads and once an hour at least saying please remember
[34:11.560 --> 34:13.920]  without you we won't be on air.
[34:13.920 --> 34:19.000]  We only got into the black when they tried to plant the child porn on us and that blew
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.320]  up in their face.
[34:20.320 --> 34:24.000]  People went, oh my gosh, Alex really isn't kidding.
[34:24.000 --> 34:25.760]  They're really trying to destroy him.
[34:25.760 --> 34:29.520]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I don't want to do them no favor and get into all the things
[34:29.520 --> 34:30.520]  they've done.
[34:30.520 --> 34:32.080]  There's a lot of reasons.
[34:32.080 --> 34:38.200]  I obviously can't get into it on air, but believe me, if you think that's bad, you
[34:38.200 --> 34:39.720]  have no idea.
[34:39.720 --> 34:43.600]  And the stuff they're doing to even local state representatives that are conservative
[34:43.600 --> 34:48.400]  or Christian, the stuff they're doing to anybody who's anywhere close to Trump, it's
[34:48.400 --> 34:49.400]  all the same.
[34:49.400 --> 34:52.280]  It's a nightmare and it lets you know how bad these people are.
[34:52.280 --> 34:57.880]  Now listen, I'm not a victim, I'm a warrior in a fight and I knew these people were bad
[34:57.880 --> 35:00.920]  and quite frankly the fact that they've been so nasty lets me know that I've been right
[35:00.920 --> 35:05.080]  about this the whole time so I don't feel guilty about going after them.
[35:05.080 --> 35:11.040]  Sometimes we were 95% sure about all this, but I would still feel kind of guilty because
[35:11.040 --> 35:12.960]  we're saying some really horrible things about the NWO.
[35:12.960 --> 35:13.960]  Well guess what?
[35:13.960 --> 35:18.600]  It's all true and more so I feel good, I feel committed and I feel strong with the God's
[35:18.600 --> 35:20.800]  hand on my shoulder, but I'm here to tell you.
[35:20.800 --> 35:24.960]  We are in a war and just like in World War II, they told folks, hey, work as hard as
[35:24.960 --> 35:30.160]  you can, produce as much munitions, don't waste food, blah blah blah, that's all real
[35:30.160 --> 35:31.240]  in this fight.
[35:31.240 --> 35:35.480]  So whether you go speak at a city council meeting or whether you go speak at your church,
[35:35.480 --> 35:40.560]  whether you call in to C-SPAN or talk radio, just have your voices be heard and pray to
[35:40.560 --> 35:45.640]  God every day and remember to financially support whatever broadcast you think is the
[35:45.640 --> 35:46.640]  most effective.
[35:46.640 --> 35:51.640]  And I'm here to tell you, we've got actually six projects, I said five the other day, I
[35:51.640 --> 35:54.240]  was thinking I've got six.
[35:54.240 --> 35:58.280]  We are already operational, three more are about to launch and I've got a couple more
[35:58.280 --> 36:02.560]  incubating that I want to get launched and look, we're a year behind launching other
[36:02.560 --> 36:03.560]  shows.
[36:03.560 --> 36:06.280]  That's not one of the secret projects.
[36:06.280 --> 36:13.040]  I'm accelerating everything though and spending every dime we've got and running off no reserves.
[36:13.040 --> 36:17.440]  But again, we couldn't expand until the globalists tried to set us up and people really figured
[36:17.440 --> 36:21.520]  out what was happening and quite a bit of extra money came in, but still it's not what
[36:21.520 --> 36:22.520]  we need for operations.
[36:22.520 --> 36:28.440]  So I'm telling you, you want to see some fireworks politically, you want to see more victory,
[36:28.440 --> 36:30.440]  go to infowarstore.com.
[36:30.440 --> 36:35.480]  We have 50% off DNA force right now for limited time, it's back in stock, it's amazing.
[36:35.480 --> 36:40.920]  We've got so many other great products there as well, SuperMail Vitality 50% off, 40%
[36:40.920 --> 36:44.280]  off the water filters that make some lost leaders.
[36:44.280 --> 36:49.680]  This is, I've been authorized by the factory, ProPure and Alexa Pure and so many other big
[36:49.680 --> 36:52.880]  specials right now at infowarstore.com.
[36:52.880 --> 36:58.600]  Now these aren't giant general store sales where everything's at least 30% off.
[36:58.600 --> 37:04.440]  These are specific best selling items though that are 50% off to 40% off that are unprecedented.
[37:04.440 --> 37:11.000]  Alexa Pure Breeze, Alexa Pure Pro, the whole water filtration family at infowarstore.com.
[37:11.000 --> 37:17.280]  But please, whatever you do, realize that this is an intense fight and it's a battle
[37:17.280 --> 37:21.080]  like a boxing match, 12 rounds and we're entering the 10th round right now.
[37:21.080 --> 37:24.440]  So now's the time to be committed and I want to thank you all for your financial support
[37:24.440 --> 37:29.720]  and remind you that we're going to have to end this DNA force sale sometime next week.
[37:29.720 --> 37:34.280]  We're going to have to end the SuperMail Vitality sometime next week and that again, it is you
[37:34.280 --> 37:36.720]  taking action that will decide this battle.
[37:36.720 --> 37:37.720]  Thank you all.
[37:37.720 --> 37:38.720]  Back to Owen Schreuer in a live show.
[37:38.720 --> 37:43.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we will be hearing again from Alex Jones before the broadcast
[37:43.280 --> 37:44.280]  is over.
[37:44.280 --> 37:50.280]  This is for Clown World Round Two coming up next Tuesday and Wednesday evening at infowars.com
[37:50.280 --> 37:51.560]  slash show.
[37:51.560 --> 37:56.800]  Let me get to some of these clips before I delve into some of this other news here because
[37:56.800 --> 38:03.120]  we've got the Democrat debates coming up where the whole party is run off of hate and hate
[38:03.120 --> 38:08.720]  of America, hate of Trump, hate of whoever really they want to blame.
[38:08.720 --> 38:17.360]  And so also their policies are very detrimental to society because just look at California
[38:17.360 --> 38:24.240]  as an example, where now a recent CBS Los Angeles report, they've highlighted the trash,
[38:24.240 --> 38:28.600]  the homelessness, the tent cities, the disease, all of it coming in rampantly.
[38:28.600 --> 38:33.840]  Now California is being overrun by rats.
[38:33.840 --> 38:40.360]  This report should be a shame on local government officials who've known about this crisis
[38:40.360 --> 38:45.680]  for the past several months, but have tried to sweep it under the rug along with the rat
[38:45.680 --> 38:46.680]  droppings.
[38:46.680 --> 38:50.800]  And Carl DeMile, chairman of the Reform California, was just getting started.
[38:50.800 --> 38:55.520]  As he said, California, not just Los Angeles, is being overrun by rats.
[38:55.520 --> 38:59.200]  Every five to 10 feet, you will see black boxes with numbers on them.
[38:59.200 --> 39:02.600]  What those boxes are, they're rat traps.
[39:02.600 --> 39:07.080]  And there they were, hidden in the shrubs, just outside City Hall, the black boxes he
[39:07.080 --> 39:08.320]  was talking about.
[39:08.320 --> 39:13.240]  Number 97, number 98, we are told, numbered all the way up to 150.
[39:13.240 --> 39:14.240]  Rat traps.
[39:14.240 --> 39:19.440]  At a cost of $10,000, this eight-week study conducted by a number of experts, many of
[39:19.440 --> 39:25.600]  them in the pest control business, predicted there would be dire consequences if politicians
[39:25.600 --> 39:27.400]  simply ignored this problem.
[39:27.400 --> 39:33.640]  This has increased about, how much, for rodent calls for residential about 50% or 60%.
[39:33.640 --> 39:35.000]  People call and say, now I have rats.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.560]  And then going out and actually confirming they actually do have rats.
[39:37.560 --> 39:38.560]  Up to 50%.
[39:38.560 --> 39:39.560]  50, probably almost 60%.
[39:39.560 --> 39:44.520]  So this group today is asking the governor to declare a public health emergency because
[39:44.520 --> 39:51.080]  of the rats, and also urge that the assembly not pass a bill that would ban the use of
[39:51.080 --> 39:54.320]  a very common pesticides that would kill the rodents.
[39:54.320 --> 39:59.320]  The backers of that bill say the current pesticides used is a danger to environment and has been
[39:59.320 --> 40:01.080]  killing innocent wildlife.
[40:01.080 --> 40:05.120]  But to that, DeMile responded, now is not the time to worry about that.
[40:05.120 --> 40:11.920]  If we don't clean up this mess, that our citizens are going to start contracting diseases that
[40:11.920 --> 40:12.920]  are dangerous.
[40:12.920 --> 40:13.920]  Well, they already are.
[40:13.920 --> 40:17.840]  They already got typhuses spreading, tuberculosis, I mean, everything.
[40:17.840 --> 40:20.560]  It's California, baby, piles of trash.
[40:20.560 --> 40:23.600]  They talk about the mountains of Colorado and the Rocky Mountains.
[40:23.600 --> 40:25.760]  It's the trash mountains of California.
[40:25.760 --> 40:29.480]  Come visit the record high trash.
[40:29.480 --> 40:32.920]  Even maybe you can scale the mountain of trash.
[40:32.920 --> 40:34.080]  But it goes on now.
[40:34.080 --> 40:38.160]  So you have trash and rats and disease and infestation in California cities.
[40:38.160 --> 40:46.080]  Now you will also not see any references to God or Lord like they're doing now in South
[40:46.080 --> 40:47.080]  Carolina.
[40:47.080 --> 40:53.960]  New United Six controversy in Tiga K all over this monument, it's dedicated to the Tiga
[40:53.960 --> 40:54.960]  K police department.
[40:54.960 --> 40:57.680]  You can see it's got some scratches on it.
[40:57.680 --> 41:02.680]  The reason, the Bible verse etched into it has the word Lord in it.
[41:02.680 --> 41:07.240]  The city decided to remove the word Lord after backlash from the community.
[41:07.240 --> 41:10.800]  But now social media is buzzing with others who have agreed to do so.
[41:10.800 --> 41:13.400]  That's so big of it for you to believe in a creator.
[41:13.400 --> 41:16.800]  You're just, you've just evolved from pun scum.
[41:16.800 --> 41:17.800]  What a local reaction.
[41:17.800 --> 41:21.680]  Well, police tell us they started getting complaints about the monument.
[41:21.680 --> 41:25.440]  So city leaders held a meeting and now you can see they've removed the word Lord, which
[41:25.440 --> 41:28.840]  appears three times here, but it hasn't stopped the debate.
[41:28.840 --> 41:33.640]  At first, some raising concerns about separation of church and state, but now others pointing
[41:33.640 --> 41:35.480]  to freedom of speech.
[41:35.480 --> 41:39.600]  In the end, the city deciding to remove the words Lord from the monument, but the debate
[41:39.600 --> 41:45.280]  continues on social media, some questioning the legality of having it on public property.
[41:45.280 --> 41:49.360]  One woman commenting, it's nice, but why don't you just love the liberal progressive
[41:49.360 --> 41:50.600]  Democrat policy?
[41:50.600 --> 41:51.880]  This violates separation of churches.
[41:51.880 --> 41:58.160]  You get rats, you get trash, you get disease, you get crime, but you don't get God.
[41:58.160 --> 42:01.480]  Long time Tiga K. resident, Charles Parker, has a different view.
[42:01.480 --> 42:09.920]  We were organized as a Christian nation and I don't see that that's how dare that big
[42:09.920 --> 42:13.160]  of a separation of church and state.
[42:13.160 --> 42:16.560]  Then Congressman Ralph Norman weighing in, posting this Facebook video.
[42:16.560 --> 42:22.360]  The last time I checked was one nation under God, to have this scratched out is sad, to
[42:22.360 --> 42:23.360]  say the least.
[42:23.360 --> 42:29.680]  That's why we're fighting in Washington, DC to put God back in public development like
[42:29.680 --> 42:30.680]  that.
[42:30.680 --> 42:33.280]  So you can't even make a police memorial.
[42:33.280 --> 42:36.520]  Tiga K. resident, telling us the monument was held after other monuments that appear
[42:36.520 --> 42:40.400]  across the country at various levels of government, but after seeking...
[42:40.400 --> 42:45.560]  All right, I'm running for Democrat of your local city here, and I'm going to promise
[42:45.560 --> 42:50.080]  you death and disease and rats and trash and feces in the streets.
[42:50.080 --> 42:55.880]  I promise you that, and I swear, if anybody says anything about Lord or God or America
[42:55.880 --> 42:59.880]  is good, we're going to lock them up and ship them out.
[42:59.880 --> 43:01.600]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[43:01.600 --> 43:05.000]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies, and the way they did so is because
[43:05.000 --> 43:09.440]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political, or legal for their illicit activities
[43:09.440 --> 43:10.440]  over two decades.
[43:10.440 --> 43:13.840]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[43:13.840 --> 43:17.120]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[43:17.120 --> 43:21.400]  audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[43:21.400 --> 43:24.480]  to their course of conduct, otherwise they will never change, and they will become the
[43:24.480 --> 43:28.520]  big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century, who ran American
[43:28.520 --> 43:32.800]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after
[43:32.800 --> 43:33.800]  the Great Depression.
[43:33.800 --> 43:38.520]  The inforward's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world
[43:38.520 --> 43:42.920]  to make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise
[43:42.920 --> 43:44.440]  of an independent free press.
[43:44.440 --> 43:48.960]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[43:48.960 --> 43:52.680]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole
[43:52.680 --> 43:53.920]  time it's not happening.
[43:53.920 --> 43:55.720]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[43:55.720 --> 44:00.080]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw, even it is what you just saw.
[44:00.080 --> 44:05.280]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[44:05.280 --> 44:09.760]  Infowars and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented
[44:09.760 --> 44:14.000]  evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom
[44:14.000 --> 44:18.040]  of my heart to tell you how much it means to me, that when you saw all those lies against
[44:18.040 --> 44:21.920]  us last week, the worst things you can say about people, that you knew they were liars,
[44:21.920 --> 44:25.620]  you went and looked it up and found out the truth, and so I feel very strong, and I feel
[44:25.620 --> 44:29.160]  God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that
[44:29.160 --> 44:32.960]  love is right back at you, and I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of
[44:32.960 --> 44:36.640]  mouth and your prayers and your financial support, because I'm committed to fight to
[44:36.640 --> 44:41.360]  the end, but I want to win, and without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and it's not going
[44:41.360 --> 44:44.760]  to be fun, but that's not what's important, the enemy could win.
[44:44.760 --> 44:49.320]  We're a key chess piece in this fight, we're being used by God, you're being used by God,
[44:49.320 --> 44:53.160]  this is Providence, so I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom
[44:53.160 --> 44:54.160]  of my heart.
[44:54.160 --> 45:00.520]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[45:00.520 --> 45:05.880]  The globalists are hyper-competitive, scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[45:05.880 --> 45:09.960]  control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[45:09.960 --> 45:15.080]  and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with AI Gods.
[45:15.080 --> 45:18.760]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[45:18.760 --> 45:23.280]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[45:23.280 --> 45:26.240]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[45:26.240 --> 45:31.520]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLive.com, I couldn't do it.
[45:31.520 --> 45:35.840]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[45:35.840 --> 45:41.600]  Methylcobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[45:41.600 --> 45:46.360]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're
[45:46.360 --> 45:47.360]  going to find anywhere.
[45:47.360 --> 45:52.640]  It is amazing, experience pure Methylcobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[45:52.640 --> 46:01.160]  Revolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[46:01.160 --> 46:06.920]  Last night, I'm on infowars.com and I read, Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[46:06.920 --> 46:12.280]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned, a Betsy Ross and also another just classic
[46:12.280 --> 46:17.160]  American flag all 50 stars, with the Gadsden Snake superimposed over it.
[46:17.160 --> 46:21.360]  And on the back, America's back infowars.com, but what's better than just an American flag
[46:21.360 --> 46:24.680]  about a don't tread on me under the flag, saying don't tread on the American flag.
[46:24.680 --> 46:25.680]  It's a perfect combo.
[46:25.680 --> 46:26.680]  So great minds think alike.
[46:26.680 --> 46:29.920]  I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same similar
[46:29.920 --> 46:30.920]  design.
[46:30.920 --> 46:35.560]  It is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist
[46:35.560 --> 46:37.840]  of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt.
[46:37.840 --> 46:41.080]  But it's a, you know, battle-cattered flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter.
[46:41.080 --> 46:48.560]  And again, on the back, it says America's back infowars.com, 4,000 of these babies and
[46:48.560 --> 46:49.560]  that's it.
[46:49.560 --> 46:54.440]  So the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at infowars.com, be at printed
[46:54.440 --> 46:59.200]  in the USA right now infowars.com, they'll be right back, the most banned broadcast
[46:59.200 --> 47:03.480]  in the world.
[47:03.480 --> 47:33.320]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:33.320 --> 47:44.000]  On this Friday, we're going to hear from Alex Jones on, well, how the modern day leftist
[47:44.000 --> 47:49.320]  violent revolution has ties to the history of the French Revolution.
[47:49.320 --> 47:55.040]  I talk about all the time how you just say Jacques and the French Revolution is chopped
[47:55.040 --> 47:56.040]  your head off.
[47:56.040 --> 47:59.360]  That's like racist is like the new thing they do now.
[47:59.360 --> 48:01.360]  So we're going to be hearing from Alex on that.
[48:01.360 --> 48:08.800]  I want to do just a news blitz here before we move on into the second hour, open up the
[48:08.800 --> 48:14.560]  phone lines here from Alex Jones and then Nick Beggage takes over in the fourth hour.
[48:14.560 --> 48:15.880]  Where to begin here?
[48:15.880 --> 48:20.840]  Well, let's, let's start where we left off before we get into some of these other developments
[48:20.840 --> 48:25.600]  here with Epstein and Mueller.
[48:25.600 --> 48:28.160]  And let's just go down the list here.
[48:28.160 --> 48:38.840]  Wall Street Journal today, Jeffrey Epstein's pilots are subpoenaed in sex trafficking investigation.
[48:38.840 --> 48:44.880]  Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have subpoenaed Epstein's longtime personal pilots as investigators
[48:44.880 --> 48:49.440]  seek to question the financiers employees in the wake of his indictment on sex trafficking
[48:49.440 --> 48:50.440]  charges.
[48:50.440 --> 48:54.840]  Now, this is obviously pretty big news here.
[48:54.840 --> 49:02.200]  We're talking about the quote unquote Lolita Express, Bill Clinton, a frequent flyer.
[49:02.200 --> 49:10.320]  In fact, Bill Clinton had so many frequent flyer miles on the Lolita Express that, well,
[49:10.320 --> 49:15.160]  it was, it was basically he was just flying for free at this point.
[49:15.160 --> 49:17.400]  He had the companion pass.
[49:17.400 --> 49:20.200]  We'll just put it to that way.
[49:20.200 --> 49:21.700]  So those are all on record.
[49:21.700 --> 49:26.600]  And then Bill, when all this is first breaking, is like, Oh, I don't know anything about this
[49:26.600 --> 49:28.000]  Epstein character.
[49:28.000 --> 49:34.000]  The Daily Beast writes the headline.
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.600]  Bill Clinton's connections to Jeffrey Epstein in the 90s, and you're like, wow, coming from
[49:37.600 --> 49:41.000]  the Daily Beast run by Chelsea Clinton and all these Clintonites.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.400]  And then what's the first line in the story?
[49:44.400 --> 49:49.280]  Bill Clinton separated himself from Jeffrey Epstein in the 90s when the allegations came
[49:49.280 --> 49:50.280]  down.
[49:50.280 --> 49:53.040]  Oh, that's how you try to control news.
[49:53.040 --> 49:56.240]  And then that's the top search result on Google.
[49:56.240 --> 50:02.080]  When you search Epstein Clinton, don't you just love how these people manipulate?
[50:02.080 --> 50:06.780]  Don't you just love how these people deceive and control with their big tech and their
[50:06.780 --> 50:09.000]  fake news?
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.480]  But you're not going to be able to control those pilots that just got subpoenaed.
[50:12.480 --> 50:15.200]  They were flying the Lolita Express.
[50:15.200 --> 50:16.200]  Oh, yeah.
[50:16.200 --> 50:17.200]  Yeah.
[50:17.200 --> 50:18.400]  There's the Daily Beast story.
[50:18.400 --> 50:19.400]  The crew found it.
[50:19.400 --> 50:24.600]  This is the first line, days after Jeffrey Epstein's arrest on sex trafficking charges
[50:24.600 --> 50:25.600]  in New York.
[50:25.600 --> 50:30.760]  Bill Clinton distanced himself from the financier.
[50:30.760 --> 50:33.120]  And then that's the first thing that pops up on Google.
[50:33.120 --> 50:35.560]  But you know what doesn't pop up on Google?
[50:35.560 --> 50:38.960]  Anything info wars.
[50:38.960 --> 50:40.560]  New York Daily News.
[50:40.560 --> 50:45.360]  New Jeffrey Epstein court papers mention ongoing investigation of others, nude photos and evidence
[50:45.360 --> 50:46.360]  headed to defense team.
[50:46.360 --> 50:47.360]  Yeah.
[50:47.360 --> 50:50.720]  In Epstein's house, he's got piles of cash.
[50:50.720 --> 50:51.880]  He's got diamonds.
[50:51.880 --> 50:53.840]  He's got passports.
[50:53.840 --> 51:00.480]  He's got two islands with compounds and tunnels and like temples of doom.
[51:00.480 --> 51:03.680]  But hey, nothing to see here.
[51:03.680 --> 51:05.880]  No, no, no.
[51:05.880 --> 51:07.120]  No, yeah.
[51:07.120 --> 51:12.400]  This guy was, uh, I mean, folks, look, you think they just come out with this whole narrative
[51:12.400 --> 51:20.200]  like in the movie taken out of their out of thin air, this stuff goes on.
[51:20.200 --> 51:22.920]  I don't even want to know what they're doing on Epstein Island.
[51:22.920 --> 51:26.160]  And this is like beyond the nicks of them sex cult stuff where they just are in some
[51:26.160 --> 51:31.680]  weird orgy cult where they brand each other and then they try to use whatever influence
[51:31.680 --> 51:33.720]  over politics and everything.
[51:33.720 --> 51:35.000]  Those stories are coming out.
[51:35.000 --> 51:36.320]  It's all connected.
[51:36.320 --> 51:37.960]  Trump's not involved in any of it.
[51:37.960 --> 51:40.120]  And look, nobody's saying Trump's perfect.
[51:40.120 --> 51:41.120]  He's a man.
[51:41.120 --> 51:42.120]  He has inclinations.
[51:42.120 --> 51:47.120]  Trump is drug free, alcohol free and a focused worker.
[51:47.120 --> 51:49.840]  That's the difference here.
[51:49.840 --> 51:56.480]  Chelsea Clinton denies Epstein's ties to Epstein's alleged madam.
[51:56.480 --> 52:00.400]  You know, I honestly feel bad for Chelsea Clinton in this whole deal.
[52:00.400 --> 52:05.520]  I don't, I don't even know if she has a clue what's going on, but maybe she does.
[52:05.520 --> 52:09.480]  And then just, you know, because it's happening to nobody wants to talk about it.
[52:09.480 --> 52:15.680]  Former Walt Disney VP sentenced to prison and child sex abuse investigation, four counts
[52:15.680 --> 52:20.960]  of first degree sexual abuse involving a seven year old girl, Michael Laney sentenced to
[52:20.960 --> 52:23.120]  81 months.
[52:23.120 --> 52:27.320]  And this guy is 73 years old now.
[52:27.320 --> 52:32.520]  So who knows how long that's been going on.
[52:32.520 --> 52:33.520]  I go on.
[52:33.520 --> 52:37.160]  Oh, and by the way, though, so you've got all these arrests of pedophiles, all these
[52:37.160 --> 52:42.320]  arrests of sex traffickers, there's investigations into the maximum cult and all this stuff.
[52:42.320 --> 52:45.360]  It's all happening during Trump's presidency operation, broken heart.
[52:45.360 --> 52:46.840]  The media barely talks about any of it.
[52:46.840 --> 52:52.760]  I mean, do you just think that's all a coincidence?
[52:52.760 --> 52:56.960]  Do you just think that that is just happenstance?
[52:56.960 --> 53:01.000]  And then on the flip side, Democrats panicking this whole Mueller thing, all the lies and
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.320]  the attacks on Trump.
[53:03.320 --> 53:08.720]  Exclusive, Republicans aware of Mueller frailty ahead of hearing.
[53:08.720 --> 53:17.120]  So this comes from a statement made by originally, I thought it was made by by Lindsey Graham
[53:17.120 --> 53:19.200]  and then other Republicans picked it up.
[53:19.200 --> 53:21.400]  But the point is, they're all saying, oh, we knew Mueller was frail.
[53:21.400 --> 53:23.760]  We knew he was weak, really?
[53:23.760 --> 53:28.880]  I remember listening to CNN and MSNBC, hell, even Fox, all of them, Mueller's the one for
[53:28.880 --> 53:30.040]  the job.
[53:30.040 --> 53:31.540]  Nobody more respected.
[53:31.540 --> 53:32.800]  Nobody more able.
[53:32.800 --> 53:34.140]  Nobody more capable.
[53:34.140 --> 53:35.640]  Nobody bigger hero.
[53:35.640 --> 53:37.920]  Mueller is literally the best person in the history of the world.
[53:37.920 --> 53:39.120]  He's the only man for the job.
[53:39.120 --> 53:44.200]  Oh, now that he's failed, now that he's embarrassed himself, now that he's bumbled and fumbled
[53:44.200 --> 53:47.400]  and stumbled during his testimony, now that it's been exposed, he didn't even write the
[53:47.400 --> 53:49.520]  report, probably didn't even know what's in it.
[53:49.520 --> 53:50.520]  Weissman wrote it.
[53:50.520 --> 53:54.600]  Oh, now it's, well, Mueller was just the wrong man for the job.
[53:54.600 --> 53:58.000]  He was frail and he just wasn't mentally ready.
[53:58.000 --> 54:00.640]  And then now that's what they're saying on CNN and MSNBC.
[54:00.640 --> 54:02.400]  So that's what I'm saying.
[54:02.400 --> 54:07.240]  The average American who just watches this, how can they not see how fraudulent these
[54:07.240 --> 54:08.240]  people are?
[54:08.240 --> 54:12.480]  San Francisco Gate, Democrat, second guest, calling Mueller, divided on path forward.
[54:12.480 --> 54:13.600]  What do you mean second guest?
[54:13.600 --> 54:16.320]  He was the man.
[54:16.320 --> 54:22.280]  He was the most respected, most honorable, most integrity, both sides of the aisle loved
[54:22.280 --> 54:23.280]  him.
[54:23.280 --> 54:24.280]  He could do no wrong.
[54:24.280 --> 54:25.480]  Now it's, he's frail, he's weak.
[54:25.480 --> 54:27.800]  I don't know about him.
[54:27.800 --> 54:32.360]  So yeah, but the average American, do they not see how CNN is a total fraudulent network?
[54:32.360 --> 54:36.400]  Do they not see how MSNBC is a total fraudulent network?
[54:36.400 --> 54:42.640]  They just assume their audience has the memory of a goldfish, which I guess their audience
[54:42.640 --> 54:45.000]  does.
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.480]  Let's move on.
[54:46.480 --> 54:51.160]  AOC, Pelosi to address House Dem infighting.
[54:51.160 --> 54:55.200]  It's big trouble right now in the Democrat party folks.
[54:55.200 --> 55:01.720]  It's big trouble because Nancy Pelosi and Diane Feinstein and Maxine Waters and the
[55:01.720 --> 55:06.880]  powers that be the criminals that be in the Democrat party, they know the average American
[55:06.880 --> 55:12.880]  still likes capitalism and doesn't hate America.
[55:12.880 --> 55:18.640]  So they kind of flirt with that, but they don't go full bore AOC and to leave and Ilhan
[55:18.640 --> 55:22.880]  and all these clowns, their full bore America sucks, conquer it.
[55:22.880 --> 55:23.880]  Nancy's like, wait a second.
[55:23.880 --> 55:28.680]  I mean, I got rich being a criminal in this country, you know, can we not destroy my golden
[55:28.680 --> 55:33.440]  goose here and AOC and these new ones, of course, they don't have a clue what's going
[55:33.440 --> 55:34.440]  on.
[55:34.440 --> 55:37.800]  And so they're just like, oh yeah, everything's bad, climate change, you know, 10 years we're
[55:37.800 --> 55:39.840]  all going to die.
[55:39.840 --> 55:43.240]  And then this story was pushed real hard because here's the Democrats problem.
[55:43.240 --> 55:46.920]  The media is involved in the infighting too.
[55:46.920 --> 55:50.560]  This story was pushed real hard by social media today from the Atlantic.
[55:50.560 --> 55:52.960]  The millennial left is tired of waiting.
[55:52.960 --> 55:55.600]  Yeah, it's all about we have to destroy America now.
[55:55.600 --> 55:57.520]  We have to destroy the borders now.
[55:57.520 --> 56:00.360]  We have to make rich Americans pay now.
[56:00.360 --> 56:05.920]  We have to get white people to be poor and unsuccessful now.
[56:05.920 --> 56:07.600]  That's what it all is about.
[56:07.600 --> 56:10.280]  And they're tired of waiting.
[56:10.280 --> 56:13.480]  They're tired of waiting for their racism to come to fruition.
[56:13.480 --> 56:16.600]  They're tired of waiting of their bigotry to come to fruition.
[56:16.600 --> 56:20.200]  Their hate, their terrorism, they're tired of waiting for the results.
[56:20.200 --> 56:24.760]  They want results now.
[56:24.760 --> 56:27.000]  And so they can't do it legally.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.780]  They can't do it politically, so they're just going to do it violently.
[56:29.780 --> 56:32.840]  But they're going to continue to try to do it politically.
[56:32.840 --> 56:40.000]  House Democrats authorized subpoenas for Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner for emails, text messages.
[56:40.000 --> 56:41.320]  They're going after Don Jr.
[56:41.320 --> 56:42.640]  They're going after Don McGahn.
[56:42.640 --> 56:44.840]  Who's next?
[56:44.840 --> 56:46.680]  Mickey Mouse?
[56:46.680 --> 56:48.720]  Was Mickey Mouse in Trump Hotel?
[56:48.720 --> 56:50.360]  Was Mickey Mouse in Trump Tower?
[56:50.360 --> 56:52.800]  I heard the Easter Bunny showed up one time.
[56:52.800 --> 56:57.440]  Maybe we should subpoena Santa Claus.
[56:57.440 --> 57:00.160]  Maybe we should subpoena.
[57:00.160 --> 57:03.360]  Maybe we should subpoena Peter Rabbit.
[57:03.360 --> 57:15.280]  I've heard, folks, I've, oh, Bigfoot, Bigfoot was spotted at Trump Hotel and Donald Duck.
[57:15.280 --> 57:22.640]  So the Democrats have now subpoena Donald Duck and they've subpoenaed Bigfoot and they've
[57:22.640 --> 57:29.760]  subpoenaed Goofy from the Goof Troop and they are searching for Bugs Bunny and they
[57:29.760 --> 57:32.520]  are searching for Elmer Fudd.
[57:32.520 --> 57:36.640]  They have gone back in time and subpoenaed the Flintstones.
[57:36.640 --> 57:39.440]  They've gone into the future and subpoenaed the Jetsons.
[57:39.440 --> 57:42.720]  They traveled to a different dimension and subpoenaed the Teletubbies.
[57:42.720 --> 57:45.880]  There is no limit to who the Democrats want subpoena.

[58:50.080 --> 58:55.440]  Before I started working at Infowars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and Infowars.com
[58:55.440 --> 59:00.000]  but also the products at InfowarsStore.com and there's one product that's offered at
[59:00.000 --> 59:05.400]  InfowarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[59:05.400 --> 59:09.400]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[59:09.400 --> 59:13.200]  Telomere's and Telomere's support with your DNA.
[59:13.200 --> 59:18.080]  So I started to look into the science and what Telomere's were and how it can improve
[59:18.080 --> 59:21.640]  your health and longevity when you protect your Telomere's.
[59:21.640 --> 59:25.040]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but it's expensive.
[59:25.040 --> 59:26.040]  Why?
[59:26.040 --> 59:28.160]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[59:28.160 --> 59:32.160]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[59:32.160 --> 59:38.440]  Telomere support and they came and they went but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[59:38.440 --> 59:39.960]  It is the elite supplement.
[59:39.960 --> 59:44.760]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive so you should
[59:44.760 --> 01:00:10.960]  take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:18.200]  Alright Devin Nunes and Doug Collins gave comments and statements after the Mueller debacle
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.200]  yesterday.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:24.200]  Here's how that went.
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.640]  Congressman Nunes, let me start with you.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:31.520]  I want to go back and play something that you said the other night on Hannity and kind
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.720]  of get your thoughts about in retrospect now having watched this whole thing play out if
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.240]  you still think this is true.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.800]  Watch.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:44.440]  I fear what's going on right now is that Mueller is working with a lot of his staff who are
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.400]  back channeling to the Democrats.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:52.600]  And so it is very possible that Mueller is going to have a few little sound bites that
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.680]  are going to give the Democrats exactly what they want.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.920]  You still think that might have happened?
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.920]  Yeah I do.
[01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:00.200]  I think they were working with the Democrats.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:05.000]  I think when you look at Mueller's team it was a team that we still don't know how that
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.720]  got put together and that was one of the things that Mr. Mueller didn't ask about.
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.960]  I think what we didn't expect is that Mr. Mueller didn't seem to know a whole lot about
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:14.960]  the report.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.400]  I know he had time to prepare for it.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:21.440]  And then during our hearing it was a little odd because they had another lawyer, Mueller's
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.280]  deputy, was sworn in, which is really unprecedented on our committee.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:31.400]  Now we said that we weren't going to ask the other lawyer any questions and we didn't and
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:36.280]  neither did the Democrats, but it was a little odd to see the special counsel there with
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.640]  the lawyer sitting next to him.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:42.920]  So there was definitely back channeling going on and I think the big problem was is I think
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.800]  they probably figured that Mr. Mueller was going to talk about this office of legal counsel
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:50.440]  issue that happened in Mr. Collins' committee.
[01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.160]  And that was problematic and then luckily somebody got to Mr. Mueller during the break
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.600]  and he had to come out and correct it during our committee.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:03.000]  And think about this, not only did Mueller have to have a lawyer legal counsel there
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.520]  with him, which is very strange.
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:09.200]  Sort of feeling that he was going to come in there and he also was just giving statements
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:13.560]  as a witness, just making statements, asking questions that's unheard of.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560]  It would be useful.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.400]  I just wonder how much Democrats- Even Schiff would say, oh, Mr. Mueller, they would say
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.400]  Mr. Mueller, what would you like to say about this?
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.400]  What are your statements?
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.400]  This is a witness.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400]  This is going to go.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:28.880]  It felt to me like they might have been quite surprised by how it actually came out because
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.040]  it was not a strong performance.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.040]  No it was not.
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.640]  What's really amazing to me is I think that the House, on the history committee, I think
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:40.000]  they're just so delusional about what they wanted the Mueller report to say and what it
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  didn't say.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.360]  And then they tried to convince themselves of a new narrative since then.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.960]  You know, you get to the top of the show, you said Mr. Nadler, his own words where he
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:47.960]  was a watershed moment.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.320]  Well, I'm not sure he's been to a lot of watershed moments because yesterday was not
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:55.400]  one that you would put into that category because Mr. Mueller was honest.
[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.680]  In fact, here's two things that came out of number one, the collusion and conspiracy.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.160]  We put that to rest yesterday.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.400]  One in the same, so any Democrat such as the chairman of Intel, Mr. Schiff, who said
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:07.400]  there's collusion in plain sight, even some of my members on judiciary, that's just a
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.400]  false narrative.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:09.400]  That's a lot of the American people.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.800]  Mr. Mueller put that to bed.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:14.280]  Every time my Judiciary Committee Democrats tried to walk down obstruction, they even
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.160]  used a little chart to put green check marks.
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.880]  Mr. Mueller would come and say, you know, no, I don't subscribe to your analysis.
[01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:20.880]  Kick it out.
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.640]  So these are the kind of problems you saw yesterday.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:26.040]  They were hoping for something they've not been able to do and it fell flat.
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.040]  No, that's it.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:29.640]  The Democrats are trying to beat reality here.
[01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.640]  We're talking about...
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.640]  That's what this is.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:32.640]  They're trying to beat reality.
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:33.880]  There is no Russian collusion with Trump.
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.880]  There's no proof of it.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:35.880]  There never has been.
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.640]  And again, collusion isn't a crime.
[01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.640]  It's just a word that they've hiked up.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:44.040]  I mean, imagine being so stupid to fall for Russian collusion.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.040]  I can't even believe it.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.040]  You know, things that happened before and things that happened from the after.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.040]  Like, come in here.
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.560]  In fact, guys, let's do an experiment.
[01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:53.360]  Come in here and beat me on the head 30 times with a hammer and let's see if I believe Russian
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.360]  collusion.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.360]  Can we do that?
[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.360]  Yeah.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:57.360]  It might take more than that.
[01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.560]  And also, this has been the narrative for a long time about this Trump Tower meeting
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:06.000]  that lasted for a total of 20 minutes, even in his report.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  He says that.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.440]  So, how can you not know?
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.600]  If you've looked at everything to do with that Trump Tower meeting, you know that House
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.920]  Republicans have been talking about this for months.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:21.000]  It was in our report that we wrote about Glenn Simpson and Fusion GPS being meeting with
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.560]  Natalia Vesniskaya, who was the lawyer that met with the Trump Tower at the Trump Tower
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.600]  meeting that supposedly had the dirt.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:32.640]  So, you know, the fact remains that Glenn Simpson, who was working for the Democrats,
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.960]  working for the Clinton campaign, met with that lawyer.
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:39.040]  Just imagine this.
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:44.360]  This is like watching your favorite team compete in the Super Bowl, okay?
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:47.520]  And they lose 30 to nothing.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:51.120]  And then after the game and the next day, you're celebrating like they won, like, we
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.240]  won the Super Bowl.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.800]  Your team literally got skunked.
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800]  That's what the Democrats like.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:55.800]  We got Trump.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:59.200]  You got nothing.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:05.120]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:10.720]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stocked full of high quality

[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:15.520]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:22.440]  I want to thank all of you for tuning in during this live Friday edition.
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.280]  Again, Alex Jones here.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:28.240]  I will be back in studio this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.400]  Please don't forget we're going to have Clown World coverage of the Democrat debates.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.120]  Now dangerous these people are.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.640]  Clown World 2, Meet America's Enemies is the official name.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:43.120]  Get all the live feeds at clownworld.us and please spread them because you are the resistance,
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:48.000]  you are the modern Paul Revere's, and that's this Tuesday evening right through the next
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:54.240]  day on Wednesday outside of all the regular shows we do, David Knight, 8 a.m., myself 11
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:58.120]  a.m., Owen Troyer, 3 p.m. all times central.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:03.920]  And lastly, if we had the funds to expand and if we had the funds to be operating, I would
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:10.360]  not be coming to you during the ads and once an hour at least saying, please remember without
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:12.300]  you we won't be on air.
[01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:17.400]  We only got into the black when they tried to plant the child porn on us and that blew
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.680]  up in their face.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:22.360]  People went, oh my gosh, Alex really isn't kidding.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.000]  They're really trying to destroy him.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.880]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, I don't want to do them no favor and get into all the things
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.880]  they've done.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:35.160]  There's a lot of reasons, I obviously can't get into it on air, but believe me, if you
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:41.200]  think that's bad, you have no idea and the stuff they're doing to even local state representatives
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:46.040]  that are conservative or Christian, the stuff they're doing to anybody who's anywhere close
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:50.280]  to Trump, it's all the same, it's a nightmare and it lets you know how bad these people
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:51.280]  are.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:56.280]  Now listen, I'm not a victim, I'm a warrior in a fight and I knew these people were bad
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.320]  and quite frankly the fact that they've been so nasty lets me know that I've been right
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:03.480]  about this the whole time so I don't feel guilty about going after them.
[01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:09.440]  Sometimes we were 95% sure about all this, but I would still feel kind of guilty because
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.360]  we're saying some really horrible things about the NWO.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:16.400]  Well guess what, it's all true and more, so I feel good, I feel committed and I feel strong
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.920]  with the God's hand on my shoulder, but I'm here to tell you, we are in a war and just
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:25.840]  like in World War II, they told folks, hey, work as hard as you can, produce as much munitions,
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:29.680]  don't waste food, blah blah blah, that's all real in this fight.
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:34.680]  So whether you go speak at a city council meeting or whether you go speak at your church,
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:39.000]  whether you call in to C-SPAN or talk radio, just have your voices be heard and pray to
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.120]  God every day and remember to financially support whatever broadcast you think is the
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.720]  most effective and I'm here to tell you, we've got actually six projects, I said five the
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:55.000]  other day, I was thinking I've got six, three are already operational, three more are about
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.640]  to launch and I've got a couple more incubating that I want to get launched and look, we're
[01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:04.680]  a year behind launching other shows, that's not one of the secret projects.
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:11.440]  I'm accelerating everything though and spending every dime we've got and running off no reserves,
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.560]  but again we couldn't expand until the globe was trying to set us up and people really
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.600]  figured out what was happening and quite a bit of extra money came in, but still it's
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:24.960]  not what we need for operations, so I'm telling you, you want to see some fireworks politically
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:30.360]  or whatever, you want to see more victory, go to m4warstore.com, we have 50% off DNA force
[01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:34.600]  right now for a limited time, it's back in stock, it's amazing, we've got so many other
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:41.640]  great products there as well, SuperMail Vitality 50% off, 40% off the water filters, that makes
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:47.240]  some lost leaders, this is, I've been authorized by the factory, ProPure and AlexaPure and
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:54.940]  so many other big specials right now at m4warstore.com, now these aren't giant general store sales
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:59.640]  where everything's at least 30% off, these are specific best selling items though that
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:05.440]  are 50% off to 40% off that are unprecedented, AlexaPure Breeze, AlexaPure Pro, the whole
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:12.800]  water filtration family at m4warstore.com, but please whatever you do, realize that this
[01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.800]  is an intense fight and it's a battle like a boxing match, 12 rounds and we're entering
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.440]  the 10th round right now, so now's the time to be committed, I want to thank you all for
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:26.200]  your financial support and remind you that we're going to have to end this DNA force
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.840]  sale sometime next week, we're going to have to end the SuperMail Vitality sometime next
[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:35.120]  week and that again, it is you taking action that will decide this battle.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.280]  Thank you all, back to Owen Schreuer in a live show.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.040]  All right ladies and gentlemen, welcome back in studio here, we'll be hearing from Alex
[01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:46.880]  again in this hour and again in the third hour before Nick Beggage takes over the fourth
[01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:53.760]  hour and I'm going to open up phone lines probably at some point in this hour, I do
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.000]  have other news I need to get to including President Trump hammering Google on Twitter
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.840]  today, President Trump calling out which I'm glad he did this, I talked about this yesterday,
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:08.240]  not allowing Apple to leave the United States with manufacturing and then go to China and
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:14.400]  get free, no tariffs, but President Trump said he's not going to let that, President
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:20.320]  Trump hitting Fox News on Twitter for being anti-Trump like they were during the 2016
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:24.120]  election, which he seems to forget, but first, you know, we talk about the expansion and
[01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:32.160]  everything we want to do here and how when you shop at InfowarsStore.com, it just builds
[01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:37.640]  Infowars, this platform, we get bigger, we get new reporters and crew and everything
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:41.480]  like Caitlin Bennett, who is a young and upcoming reporter right now who does such
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:46.120]  great work, here's just a small snippet of some of the stuff that she's been doing lately
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:53.720]  as she starts the Anti-Socialist Social Club, anti-socialist social club, yeah, how's it
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.720]  going?
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:56.720]  Going good, what's that shirt mean?
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:00.480]  It's anti-socialist, a lot of my family has gone through socialist countries in the past
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.120]  and for generations and we hate it, socialism sucks, right?
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:10.480]  It does suck, why do you think we have such a problem with college leftists supporting
[01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:11.720]  socialism?
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:18.680]  I think that the reason why we have this massive push for socialism for our generations is
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.560]  the fact that the government wants more power and that's all they want, more power, more
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:26.720]  money to take our freedoms and rights away and they want to take that away, they start
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.120]  off with the next generation of Americans, that's the way they do it, so they're hitting
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:35.400]  the schools and they're doctorating our kids to believe that socialism is a good thing,
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:39.120]  that there's free stuff out there, there's no such thing as free stuff, I learned this
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.080]  at a young age, there's no such thing as a free lunch and there's no such thing as free
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:47.040]  health care, free college, it's just 70% marginal tax rate, which no one knows what
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:51.440]  that means supposedly and AOC definitely doesn't know what that means, all she wants
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:54.080]  is 70% of your income and my income.
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:59.520]  And I say no, I identified actually, maybe you'll join me in this as a non-tax payer,
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.920]  I identified as that, so they can't tax me, right?
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:06.960]  If we identify and change our gender to non-tax payer, will you change your gender right now
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.960]  with me?
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:08.960]  I'm down.
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:14.760]  So we now, our gender is a non-tax payer, so AOC, you can't take our tax money, you
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:19.440]  can't fund free health care for illegal immigrants, what's it like being this new gender?
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:23.600]  Oh, I feel great, it feels great and they cannot discriminate against me because that
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:26.040]  is wrong, that is wrong and that's not PC.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:30.760]  Okay, alright, there you have it, you know, the way you can support the new gender here
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:36.240]  today is by going to InfowarsStore.com, maybe we can get some new t-shirts to say I identify
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.360]  as a non-tax payer, you'd buy one from InfowarsStore.com?
[01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:40.360]  I would definitely get one.
[01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.280]  Okay, alright, maybe they'll censor that like they did my Instagram post today, alright,
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.240]  go there, maybe you'll see some new t-shirts.
[01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:52.760]  Now speaking of identifying, you know, identifying as a whatever, you know, in this new liberal
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:57.200]  progressive world, this was sent to me on Twitter, this is hilarious and even though
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.720]  this would probably never happen, I kind of wish it would, but even conceptually you
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.080]  think that this concept would show the left how ludicrous they are, but here, this was
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:06.720]  sent to me.
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:12.920]  This is a suggestion to break the left's ridiculous gender ideology and denial of biological reality.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:16.400]  President Trump should make a declaration that he is identifying as a woman.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:21.520]  The left will have to admit the absurdity of their gender ideology or accept and celebrate
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.480]  Donna Trump as the first female president, thus beating Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren,
[01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:31.960]  Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Kristen Gillibrand to the glorious goal of one of their female
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.960]  firsts.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.440]  Furthermore, if he remains married to Melania, he will also be the first gay president and
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:40.720]  the first lesbian president.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:45.760]  He will also be the first lesbian president married to an immigrant.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.600]  What could be a more glorious event for the Democrats to celebrate?
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:53.320]  So now obviously, well, conceptualize this in your head.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:59.400]  If Trump did that, what would the left that says, oh, you know, gender fluidity, gender
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:05.560]  positivity, you can be anything you want, it's all a social construct, but they wouldn't
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.280]  let Trump have it.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:13.800]  So they would either have to deny Trump what they claim is social justice, which is liberal
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:19.360]  progressivism, biology doesn't exist, or they would have to, you know, let's see if they
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.920]  could finally admit they're crazy or if they're going to commit to their mental illness.
[01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.920]  Okay, fine.
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:28.360]  Trump is a woman, Trump is the first female president, Trump is the first lesbian president.
[01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.960]  I mean, and then what does it do?
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:39.840]  And you would think that just that concept alone could show the left how ridiculous their
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:43.400]  social constructs are, their ideologies are.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:47.080]  But the fact that we would have to go to that length to prove it is really sad.
[01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:49.760]  But don't worry, this will happen organically.
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.240]  In 20 years, if we continue this trend, female sports won't exist.
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.760]  It will just be junior varsity male sports dresses women.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:03.920]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:04.920]  Forget bunkers.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.880]  You're not a live underground gopher.

[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:32.520]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.520]  the world.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.560]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:42.520]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars one and two left England broken.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:46.320]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.320]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.840]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:55.400]  The deep state began with World War one, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:57.640]  at Amazon books.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:02.640]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:06.440]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:11.320]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.840]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:19.360]  We hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:20.360]  across America.

[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:28.960]  healthier I feel.

[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:02.600]  It's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena and the public square.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:07.080]  The other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the only network of this reach that
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:10.320]  is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.080]  That's not backed by some billionaire.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.440]  That's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.160]  It is completely independent of all that.
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:21.880]  It is an old school American 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:25.720]  and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:30.080]  the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:33.600]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and that ultimately we now live in an era
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:37.480]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:41.480]  who have been able to control and manipulate what news and views the person is allowed
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.680]  to have or express or hear and the info wars audience has broken through that.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:50.520]  They are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:55.600]  freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming defamation, law
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:00.960]  and tear and libel targeting youth.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:23.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.880]  Ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:32.640]  We're going to be hearing from Alex Jones coming up in the next segment tying in the
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.560]  history of the French Revolution to what we're seeing now.
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:40.800]  You know we got a lot of things working behind the scenes that you may never even know about
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:45.600]  but well I'm not even going to say it.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.040]  I've got some huge news.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:54.960]  I just got some massive news and I can't break it right now but just be sure you're
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:21:00.360]  paying attention to info wars dot com through the weekend and next week because not only
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:04.160]  do I have some big news coming and then Alex has some other exclusive news he's working
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:09.400]  on and we have the clown world part two coming up next week.
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:13.520]  There's nowhere else to be tuned in than better than info wars right now as all of this is
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:18.880]  breaking but look we've got I, I, I, I, wow.
[01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:24.720]  Maybe there is hope but only if we take action.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:25.720]  That's the kicker.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:30.520]  We have to take action and it may be uncomfortable at times.
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:40.040]  The cost may be just never taking a break from life but isn't it worth it to preserve
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:41.040]  freedom in the West?
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:51.600]  Isn't it worth it to preserve America and the independence and the prosperity that we
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:54.240]  have here?
[01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.160]  I believe it is.
[01:21:56.160 --> 01:22:05.160]  I'm not the only one because our independence, our liberty, our values, our traditions were
[01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:17.680]  all paved by the blood of men and women who recognized, who recognized that.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:25.920]  So we really barely even know compared to some people but man we understand how important
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.600]  it is that America exists.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:33.400]  So let me do this in this segment because yes info wars is the place to be.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:45.920]  I mean let's be honest folks and in fact now you've got, you've got MSNBC segments and
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:51.320]  then even, well this is just incredible what's happening on MSNBC and CNN but first let's
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:23:04.960]  go to MSNBC saying that they're basically now the real conspiracy theorists.
[01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:05.960]  Do we have clip 5?
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.280]  This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove.
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:14.000]  Donald Trump, October 31st, 2016, boy I love reading those WikiLeaks.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.760]  Donald Trump, November 4th, 2016.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.080]  As if Trump's the only one reading WikiLeaks.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:34.280]  No one was reading WikiLeaks.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.280]  Think about this.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:42.280]  Hillary Clinton pays for fake information from Russia, that's just ridiculous.
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:49.720]  That moment meant that three years ago and one day today, WikiLeaks was the leading
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:55.840]  edge of an attack on the United States and Robert Mueller recognized that Donald Trump's
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:59.000]  amplification, praise of WikiLeaks-
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  Hold on, hold on, pause this because this is so unbelievably ridiculous.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.760]  Again, when WikiLeaks exposed Bush you people love it.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:12.640]  WikiLeaks is not an attack on the United States in any way, shape or form other than
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:19.360]  the fact Democrat emails got out and just showed how these Democrats were dirtbags
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.360]  and scumbags.
[01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:25.640]  So, if you consider that a crime against America then okay, exposing corrupt politicians
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.640]  then fine.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:31.760]  But again, they say, oh Trump blew up WikiLeaks, Trump put the spotlight on WikiLeaks.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:37.040]  No, no, no, CNN did, MSNBC did, Fox News did, anyone in the media did.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.040]  Of course you did.
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:45.040]  But WikiLeaks is a huge, huge international journalism outlet.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:50.240]  So everybody talks about WikiLeaks, but if Trump does it, it's bad, all right, go back.
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:56.960]  And using people who were in communications with them, knowing that this was already
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:02.640]  popularly being called in media a Russian intelligence operation that he didn't care
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:07.920]  about, that was a narrative after, unpatriotic, and certainly they didn't fall in the realm
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:15.000]  of criminality within this probe, but certainly not something any American should engage in.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.600]  And you talk about WikiLeaks, like you are right now?
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:24.200]  Because so much in Washington is about, does it hurt or help a given side?
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.960]  And how does it look, and how does it play?
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:32.520]  And Bob Mueller from covering him strikes me as someone who doesn't care, which is precisely
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:36.760]  why he is credible on these issues over the long haul, and has disappointed various political
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.520]  factions at various moments.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:43.640]  So with that in mind, Malcolm, take a look at this exchange where, what does Bob Mueller
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:44.640]  really care about?
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.080]  Where does he become more animated?
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:50.240]  It's the idea that Russia continues to do this during a backdrop where everyone knows
[01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:56.840]  the current administration is exactly out there preventing it at all times.
[01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:01.960]  Is this, in your investigation, did you think that this was a single attempt by the Russians
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.720]  to get involved in our election, or did you find evidence to suggest they'll try to do
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:06.720]  this again?
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:07.720]  Well, it wasn't a single attempt.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.720]  They were doing it as we sit here.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:10.720]  Yeah, Russia's all back.
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:14.920]  By the way, this has already been exposed.
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.320]  Mike Cernovich has done documentaries, Alex Jones has talked about this, the Qatari-influenced
[01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:20.320]  funding politicians.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.320]  I mean, this is a joke.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:22.320]  This is a joke.
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.920]  Russia is doing anything that Israel's not doing, Qatar is not doing, Saudi Arabia's
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:28.720]  not doing, China's not doing.
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:33.600]  This is a joke.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:37.800]  Can sit there and actually make a what we would call forward-looking statement, an estimate
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:42.120]  or a prognostication here in the intelligence section, which I know, you know, he would
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:45.840]  never do during the obstruction here, and he would never say, well, if someone lied
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:49.520]  to us a bunch, I predict they'll commit a crime again.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.520]  Such a different approach.
[01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:51.520]  There was no crime.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.520]  They didn't find a crime.
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:59.720]  You know, the part of this report that none of us truly knows the depth of is the intelligence,
[01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:04.120]  the counterintelligence component of this, and the reason that a lot of questions weren't
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:08.640]  answered today, and I saw them, they were black holes, as we call in the intelligence
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.640]  community.
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:10.640]  Because it exposes the Democrats.
[01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:11.640]  It should be there.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:15.760]  All the gravity's moving towards it, and we're not seeing that answer, like the discussion
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:16.760]  about Professor...
[01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:18.200]  Because the Democrats are behind it.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.400]  This guy's like, yeah, why aren't they answering these questions?
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.000]  Because it all leads back to Obama.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:31.160]  There's an FBI apparatus that is still hunting spies or suspected spies within this investigation.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:36.440]  So that being said, he was animated on this point because these are real threats to the
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.440]  United States.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.440]  Oh, yeah.
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:40.200]  These are things which can actually hurt us.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:41.200]  Yeah, Russian Facebook ads.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.440]  He was hobbled on the legal side.
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.160]  There was only so much he can do.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.720]  He's an institutionalist.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.960]  He played to that institution with regards to the OLC memo, but with regards to counterintelligence,
[01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:53.720]  he doesn't want to talk about it.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:57.800]  He just wants the National Security Division and the FBI to go out and start rolling up
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.720]  people or start breaking up plots.
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:02.280]  All right, so just to be clear, because I don't know what happened here.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:08.840]  That's a totally different clip than whatever was in my thing here, because that's not crystal
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:11.960]  ball and that's not them saying, inforged conspiracy theory.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:16.080]  Nonetheless, it's just more nonsense from MSNBC that you can just break down in live
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:18.920]  time.
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:20.520]  It's just hilarious.
[01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:22.440]  Again, where's the crime?
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:23.440]  They don't have it.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.440]  Where's the collusion?
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.560]  They don't have it.
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:27.560]  Where's anything?
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:28.560]  They don't have it.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:31.080]  It's just a bunch of rhetoric.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:33.360]  It's just a bunch of hearsay.
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:35.960]  And then they say, well, there's black holes and all these questions because you don't want
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:36.960]  to go there.
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:40.080]  You don't want to go there how they found the Russian dossier.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:42.920]  You don't want to go there why they spied on Carter Page.
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:46.040]  You don't want to go there why they didn't investigate Christopher Steele.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:51.200]  You don't want to go there because it all leads back to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:58.000]  So it's not a black hole, it's you don't want to go there because you're a damn Democrat.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:03.800]  When you have a pain in the neck, a real pain in the neck, back, shoulder, or legs, you
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:09.240]  now have two convenient choices to get fast relief without taking another pill.

[01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:03.280]  Imagine if somebody told you 20 years ago that in the future, universities would be
[01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:08.200]  saying don't use the term America or American and that American flags would be seen as offensive
[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:12.200]  and that federal courts would be ruling that it's a hate symbol.
[01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.520]  That's all happening.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:15.920]  The left are fascist authoritarians.
[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.920]  They're bullies.
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:17.920]  They're criminals.
[01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:20.320]  And now they're trying to make us take down the American flag.
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:24.920]  They're saying the Betsy Ross flag, our original flag is evil when she was an abolitionist,
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:30.360]  but people are fighting back in this symbol war, in this information war at infowarstore.com.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:36.320]  They're funding our operation, getting great t-shirts, a bunch of great designs, and standing
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.320]  up to the globalists.
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:40.480]  They're trying to shut down info wars, a true 360 win.
[01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:45.240]  So get your Betsy Ross flags and don't tread on me, American flags, original designs at
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:49.960]  infowarstore.com and stand up to the globalists, stand up to the tyrants and let them know
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.280]  these colors don't run and we're flying them proud.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.280]  Alex.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:55.280]  Yes.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:58.280]  I got a plug for the Patriot points I get.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.280]  Oh, thanks.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:05.560]  I got $180 so far this year and I feel like I'm stealing from you.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.760]  I buy so much in the store because I mean, I don't want to get that money to Walmart.
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:11.440]  I don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes I don't
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:12.440]  believe in.
[01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:14.680]  So I'd rather give that money to you and then get a quality product.
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:17.160]  The products that I do receive have changed my life.
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.480]  I mean, the X2 has really done a lot for me.
[01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:20.480]  I've lost weight.
[01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.000]  My brain works a whole lot better.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.800]  My kids, they use the toothpaste.
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:28.000]  My son used to get these little sore throats and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  gets rid of his sore throat.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.040]  Well, sir, let me break this down for you.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.480]  I want high quality stuff in there.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:37.000]  I want a good price, but I've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000]  50% off.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.120]  I get $2 on the toothpaste, 50% off.
[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:43.480]  And so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the bone broth.
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:44.480]  Thank you so much for the plugs.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:48.680]  But listen, when people get the Patriot points, a lot of times it makes things a loss leader
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:52.320]  because if you're already getting 10% off because you're on auto ship, then we'll do
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:54.720]  a 50% off and then you do something like that.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.000]  We have Patriot points.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000]  We lose money, but that's okay.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.400]  Thanks for the support.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:05.160]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:09.800]  That's why we created the Eight Pack PowerStack, your go to option for the building blocks
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:12.800]  of a successful approach to supplementation.
[01:32:12.800 --> 01:32:17.480]  This one stop shop for those looking to simplify or adjust their routine is perfect for new
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:20.400]  and old info warriors alike.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:24.520]  With the Eight Pack PowerStack, there's no trial and error, messy bottles laying across

[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:54.360]  This
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:34:20.320]  is
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:40.920]  a
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:44.880]  that are true, that the average person is too afraid to say.
[01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:47.840]  So, oh, you can't say that.
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.520]  That's extreme.
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:50.520]  You can't say that.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.520]  That's extreme.
[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.800]  No, you know what's extreme?
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:59.360]  Saying tens of millions of Americans are racist because of their politics.
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.720]  You know what's extreme?
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.960]  Saying tens of millions of Americans are bigoted because of their politics.
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:05.080]  You know what's extreme?
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:12.160]  Saying tens of millions of Americans are racist and Nazis and KKK and xenophobes and
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:13.640]  this and that and the other thing.
[01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.160]  You know what's extreme?
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:19.760]  Labeling millions and millions and millions of people something because you don't like
[01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.280]  them.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:24.200]  That's extreme.
[01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:28.560]  But even that wouldn't label you as the largest terror group in America.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.360]  You know what was though?
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:31.920]  You know what's extreme?
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:38.000]  Later bombing ice facilities, calling for ice facilities to be shut down.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.520]  Democrat leaders saying get physically violent to Trump supporters, cause a scene, get in
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:45.320]  their face, kick them.
[01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:51.360]  Democrat supporters throwing quick cement milkshakes at people, showing up to conservative
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:57.760]  speaking events, getting rowdy, causing riots, breaking property, breaking property and
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:04.640]  starting fires when somebody gets elected they don't like, attacking Republican headquarters,
[01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:09.200]  throwing bricks through the windows, going to conservative commentators' houses and
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:14.440]  banging on their door.
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:15.640]  That's extreme.
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.320]  That's terrorism.
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:23.120]  How about when your political rival is having a rally, you inside a riot.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.280]  That's what the Democrats did.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:29.560]  Bob Kramer, Aaron Black on record, on film, on tape.
[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:32.280]  So yeah.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:40.280]  How about the thousands of instances of the Democrats' voter base, Trump haters, powered
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:44.640]  by the media and the Democrat party to go out and commit acts of violence against Trump
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.880]  supporters, people in Trump hats.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:54.880]  So yeah, the Democrat party is the largest domestic terror group in America and it's
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:59.160]  only going to get worse unless they're stopped.
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:03.240]  And at the very top of the Democrat party folks and the people behind them, they're
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:05.360]  never going to stop.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:06.360]  They're wanting criminals.
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.520]  They have to go all the way.
[01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:12.920]  It's like, you know, some mass murderer in his final moments fighting in his shootout
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:14.960]  with the police or something.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:17.800]  It's do or die.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:19.600]  That's the mindset of the Democrat party.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.320]  They've engaged in such treason, they've engaged in such fraud, they've engaged in
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.480]  such criminality.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:25.560]  They're going all the way.
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:29.200]  Now their average voter is so brainwashed and propagandized and they don't have a clue
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.960]  what's going on.
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:34.560]  They're just now the foot soldiers of the Democrat domestic terror group, which again
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:36.840]  has been exposed by Project Veritas.
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:39.960]  Look at the Bob Kramer, Aaron Black, tape.
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:44.160]  Look at what the Democrats are doing calling for violence and then firebombing ICE facilities.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:49.360]  Look at the Democrats having their supporters go out and shoot up Republican baseball practice.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.360]  Hell, there have been stories.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:57.240]  There have actually been multiple Trump supporters shot in the streets for wearing a Trump hat.
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:59.680]  All the assaults, all of it.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:05.320]  This is the Democrat party engaged in domestic terror.
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.720]  So now what?
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:07.720]  Where does this go?
[01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:08.720]  What does history say?
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:15.080]  Well, if you look back at the French Revolution, you get a little bit of an idea of what's
[01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:25.280]  happening here where, see, they used to say if you were a traitor to the French communist
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:31.040]  violent revolution, they would just accuse you of being a traitor and then you would
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:32.320]  go straight to the guillotine.
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:41.600]  They'd lock your head off, no questions, no judge, no jury, just decapitation.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.440]  That's where the left is today.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.800]  Now we've got the story at infowars.com breaking it all down.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:51.240]  We've got the report from Alex Jones coming up in the next segment, breaking it all down.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:57.160]  But if you go to infowars.com, left planning violent revolution modeled after reign of
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.160]  terror.
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:59.160]  That's the French Revolution.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.560]  So again, this is what their plan is.
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:04.520]  Now who knows what level they're going to end up at.
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:07.720]  But this is what they're at right now.
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:08.720]  They say you're racist.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:09.720]  Okay.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:14.600]  That gives you the right to punch someone in the face, throw a milkshake concrete bomb
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:21.280]  at them, fire bomb an ice facility, shoot a Republican congressman, attack or a conservative
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:25.940]  commentator's house, doc's a conservative commentator.
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:28.280]  So this is where they're at now.
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:34.280]  Both the media or the Southern Poverty Law Center or the ACLU or a Democrat labels you
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.640]  a Trump supporter or your public as a Trump supporter.
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.080]  See here's what they've done.
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:40.600]  They've put a blanket statement on all Trump supporters.
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:43.400]  This is the most racist, hateful, bigoted thing that you could ever do.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.440]  And it's all done by the Democrats.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:47.600]  They put a blanket statement on all Trump supporters.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:48.600]  They're racist.
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:49.600]  They're Nazis.
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.600]  They're deplorable.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.520]  They're this, they're that, the other thing.
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:58.040]  And so then their foot soldiers, their violent offenders have now been justified to engage
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.040]  in violence.
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:00.040]  So what do they do?
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:01.040]  They shoot Republicans.
[01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.280]  They fire bomb ice facilities.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.440]  They attack Trump supporters in the streets.
[01:40:05.440 --> 01:40:06.680]  They call for violence.
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:08.320]  They disrupt events.
[01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.520]  They get violent.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:13.920]  They organize at the top of the Democrat Party with Aaron Black and Bob Kramer to start riots
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:14.920]  in Chicago.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:16.600]  That's not the first time they've done it.
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:20.020]  That's the first time it's been caught on camera of them admitting it.
[01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:22.360]  This is what the Democrats do.
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:24.200]  So again, this is where they're at.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:28.160]  This statement on all Trump supporters, you're a Nazi, you're a racist, the brainwashing
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:33.600]  propaganda kicks in, violence is unjustified, and they just kind of step back and act like
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:34.600]  it's not happening.
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:37.360]  Hey, we're just calling out racists here.
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:41.160]  We're just calling out Nazis here.
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:45.360]  And then they say, oh, well, after like, for example, when I confront Al Green, other congressmen
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:49.440]  have been confronted, they don't even disavow it.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:52.840]  Ilhan Omar won't disavow the Democrat terrorism.
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:55.760]  Cortez won't disavow the Democrat terrorism.
[01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:56.760]  They love it.
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.640]  I mean, at least I'll give Al Green credit.
[01:40:58.640 --> 01:41:01.240]  He said, yeah, there shouldn't be violence against you.
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:04.680]  Well, you're the one that lied about me, Al Green.
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.760]  You're the one that lied about Trump, Al Green.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.280]  But it's not just Al Green.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:10.400]  It's the whole Democrat Party.
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:13.120]  And so where does it end?
[01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:17.000]  So can I just go out on the street and just say, oh, you're a racist.
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.880]  You should get your head chopped off.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:21.000]  Oh, you're a Nazi.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.720]  You need to be shot execution style.
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:26.560]  Is that where this goes?
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:30.000]  They're one step away.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:35.320]  And so this is where the cucked conservative will say, you're too extreme.
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:38.080]  You can't use that rhetoric again.
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:40.400]  I'm not the one firebombing ICE facilities.
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:44.240]  I'm not the one seeing anybody in a political hat and punching them in the mouth.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:46.480]  I'm not the one shooting up a political event.
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:48.320]  I'm not the one starting riots.
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:50.120]  I'm not the one starting fires.
[01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.440]  I'm not the one calling for violence.
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.440]  That's the Democrats.
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:42:00.480]  But you see cucked servitives are so cucked that they'll say, I'm extreme.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:01.800]  I'm the problem.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:02.800]  That's what they do.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:03.800]  They literally say, oh, infos are the problem.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:04.800]  They're rhetoric's too extreme.
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:07.480]  Oh, my rhetoric's extreme.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:14.800]  I'm calling out domestic terrorism by the Democrat Party and giving all the examples.
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.520]  And I'm extreme.
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:21.720]  No, you're complicit at that point.
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.000]  So where does it go from here?
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.240]  When we come back, Alex Jones is going to break it all down.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.480]  The story is at infowars.com.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.480]  Left planning, violent revolution, model after reign of terror.
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:33.040]  We've been telling you about this.
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:35.960]  We've been telling you how they've been coordinating with Obama's staybehinds.
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:39.720]  We've been telling you about how they've been coordinating with social media to dox people.
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.400]  This is what they're doing.
[01:42:41.400 --> 01:42:45.120]  So again, Alex is going to break it all down with the French Revolution history.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:50.160]  So if this is the Democrat plan, label you a Nazi, label you a racist, justify violence
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:53.760]  against you, call for violence against ICE and other government facilities and Republican
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:57.720]  commentators and conservatives, and then it's all hell breaks loose.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:03.160]  Last night, I'm on infowars.com, and I read, Chris Pratt criticized for t-shirt choice.
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:08.800]  It is literally the shirt that I envisioned, a Betsy Ross, but also another just classic
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:13.680]  American flag, all 50 stars, with the Gadsden snake superimposed over it.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:16.080]  And on the back, America's back, infowars.com.
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:19.840]  But what's better than just an American flag, about a don't tread on me under the flag,
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:22.080]  saying don't trail the American flag, it's a perfect combo.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:23.080]  So great minds think alike.
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:26.240]  I mean, whoever designed that shirt, we'd already come up with the exact same similar
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.240]  design.
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:32.160]  It is the don't tread on me American flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering of leftist
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:34.400]  of the shirt worn by Chris Pratt.
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:37.640]  But it's a battle tattered flag like the one that flew over Fort Sumter.
[01:43:37.640 --> 01:43:42.440]  And again, on the back, it says, America's back, infowars.com.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:45.680]  There's over 1,000 of these babies, and that's it.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:50.720]  So we've got the Betsy Ross version and the American flag version at infowars.com, you
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:52.720]  printed the USA right now, infowars.com.
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:57.480]  They'll be right back, the most banned broadcast in the world.
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:02.960]  Before I started working at infowars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and infowars.com,
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:04.960]  but also the products at infowars.com.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:11.280]  And there's one product that's offered at infowars.com that is the elite of the supplements.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.800]  And that's DNA Force Plus.
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:16.760]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:20.600]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:25.480]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve
[01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:29.040]  your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:32.440]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive.
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:33.440]  Why?
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:35.560]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:39.560]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:45.840]  telomere support and they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:47.360]  It is the elite supplement.
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:51.200]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[01:44:51.200 --> 01:45:20.720]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at infowarsstore.com.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:42.200]  To make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:46.360]  of an independent free press, real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:50.200]  working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:51.200]  out.
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:46:05.320]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:10.880]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war, borders are being
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:18.240]  broken and sovereignty is being challenged, the world is going to change and how it changes
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:24.240]  will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong when the system fails.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:30.400]  The system is vulnerable, electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.760]  be empty in three days.
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:38.040]  Having storeable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:43.680]  in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:45.440]  to a dying system.
[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:50.960]  Buy storeable foods and an Alexa pure gravity water filter today.
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:47:01.480]  Support mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from infowarsstore.com.
[01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:19.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show crashing through the lies and disinformation it's
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:27.640]  Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[01:47:27.640 --> 01:47:33.600]  It's been said a billion times or more because it's true.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:39.640]  Those that do not know history are doomed to repeat it.
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:48.400]  There's a very important report, a story, a history lesson by Peggy Noonan from the
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:58.880]  Wall Street Journal dealing with the French Revolution and the Jackamins and pointing
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:07.360]  out the parallels between what happened during the original red terror and what is now happening
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:10.120]  here in America.
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:14.560]  Now anyone who's listened to my broadcast over the years or heard Lord Moncton or others
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:22.560]  on would understand that Peggy Noonan's report actually only scratches the surface.
[01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:32.280]  Why she behaves like she has discovered the parallels between the Jackamins and the French
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:41.040]  Revolution and that this is an epiphany that she's sharing with us.
[01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:45.040]  Now I'm not saying that she's plagiarizing history, again I'm thankful that she's pointing
[01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:51.760]  out this key, but it is a little frustrating because it's basically baby food compared
[01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:54.400]  to steak and potatoes.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:02.120]  The French Revolution was executed and carried out by agents of Adam Weithaupt and the Illuminati.
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.800]  That's mainline history.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:10.480]  They were anti-Christian, they were anti-family, they wanted to get rid of the roles of mother
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:16.960]  and father, they wanted to get rid of the regular calendar, they wanted to change the
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:19.640]  days of the week to nine or ten days.
[01:49:19.640 --> 01:49:26.680]  Now all of this is in an article and she parallels it with the modern universities and all their
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:33.320]  new pronouns and saying don't say America, don't say America and she goes it's crazy
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:38.320]  that history is repeating itself or that history is hiccuping.
[01:49:38.320 --> 01:49:46.360]  Now the truth is that the Jacobin Illuminati Revolution and that nightmare system that
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:51.200]  killed so many hundreds of thousands of innocent people there was then kicked off again by
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:52.200]  V.I.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:58.880]  Lenin in Russia where they again targeted the family, attempted to destroy the original
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:05.760]  agrarian farming societies that enrage the Illuminati because they want to overthrow the
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:10.720]  kings, the church to set up their own system and they're most threatened by the family
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:15.520]  and by rugged agrarian individualists that they can't control.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:21.280]  They're worried about self-sufficiency and they know that any centralized system they
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:26.600]  set up will end up being defeated by the rural communities once they discover how corrupt
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:27.600]  and bad it is.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:32.760]  So what the establishment calls this is the final revolution.
[01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:41.360]  So whether it's the Jacobins in the late 1880s or whether it is V.I.
[01:50:41.360 --> 01:50:46.520]  Lenin and the Bolshoi Revolution or Joseph Stalin or Mao Zedong and the Cultural Revolution
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:52.760]  and the Great Leap Forward, it's all the exact same garbage and on the surface they
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:57.720]  claim that they're atheists, they claim that they don't believe in God, that they are quote
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:51:01.200]  school teachers, they are school masters, they are the university professors, that's
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.280]  who led the French Revolution.
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:08.760]  But their own internal documents have been made public, they actually intend to set themselves
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.920]  up as absolute God.
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:17.560]  So if they can take over the libraries worldwide in all western countries and have children
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:24.680]  brought to fat men in clown outfits to be set on their laps, it's an act of psychological
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:29.720]  rape, an act of domination, an act of saying that there aren't two sexes, an act of making
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:32.680]  you submit to their insanity.
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:33.680]  It's called brainwashing.
[01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:39.280]  There was a big article up on infowars.com yesterday out of Estonia which is totally
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:45.200]  run by George Soros now, Estonia is constantly asking the U.S. to go to war with Russia.
[01:51:45.200 --> 01:51:50.680]  There they indoctrinate all the youth into the so-called gay pride events and they mandatorily
[01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:56.960]  take the public school children to the famous art houses there where there's classical art
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:03.760]  of the family together and of men and women in strong roles and a huge fat goblin woman
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:10.760]  hangs, signs over that saying, this is bad, I am good, then she unveils herself with giant
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:19.000]  rolls of fat and begins saying obscene things about sex with huge artificial vaginas and
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:24.640]  bodies and dildos piled up all around her and when the children try to turn away she
[01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:31.720]  moves in with her goblin form like Baron Harkinen and demands that they worship her.
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:38.800]  You can see the look of sickening domination and rape as she's psychically raping and feeding
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:45.280]  off of them and as her other lesbian lieutenants look on with extreme pleasure as the young
[01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:49.840]  males are made to worship the obscenity.
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:51.160]  Why is it the same here?
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:58.680]  Because this is lesser magic, these people are into the occult and if they can openly
[01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:09.040]  unclothe themselves in front of your children then it will normalize it just like John Podesta's
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:16.560]  brother Tony Podesta in 2007 was in the Washington Post and he said I'm into deviant art, I have
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:22.100]  a basement and he showed them photos, the Washington Post, of chained up little three
[01:53:22.100 --> 01:53:30.280]  year olds being tortured and being raped but he said this is art and the media fetishized
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:37.360]  it and posted it and celebrated it that they were showing what they're doing to everyone
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:42.880]  in plain view and there's nothing you can do to stop them.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:50.280]  This is called lesser magic and this is the foundations of the grand grimoires and all
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:55.800]  the things of the satanic church and the rest of it is established in today that at the
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:54:00.840]  bottom of the rat hole is the ritual abuse of children as we now all know and it's more
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:06.200]  of it breaks every day and so you're seeing them try to psychically and spiritually dominate
[01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:10.640]  us and announce we kill babies after they're born, we keep them clumped, you're seeing
[01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:14.040]  all the other announcements when we go out to leftist events where they come up and go
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:19.000]  I don't like these little kids, I don't like hearing their little voices.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.440]  That's the demons letting you know that they are in control and in command hoping you just
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:29.080]  give up by sheer fear or hopelessness.
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:32.640]  The truth is they're beginning to lose their power.
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:37.280]  It's going to get worse before it gets better but I challenge you to go read the article
[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:42.080]  linked up on the left hand side of drivesreport.com, we're going to link it up on infowars.com
[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:43.280]  as well.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:47.160]  I did a lot of reports on this over the years but you can't find them on YouTube because
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:52.360]  my name is unsearchable basically but I'm going to have Lord Mountain who's former chief
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:58.000]  advisor to Margaret Thatcher and quite the historian on to break down the Jacobins, the
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:03.840]  roots of the modern communist party, antifa, globalism, the new world order but he'll explain
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:10.600]  it of course but it goes back further than that to the legalists and others that were
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:15.480]  in ancient China and they create lots of little word rules and lots of little things you've
[01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:21.360]  got to follow or you get imprisoned and or executed and so we're going to be breaking
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:26.440]  this down because historically it's important to get this back on the public record so people
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:31.520]  understand that this is all by design, this isn't a mistake, this isn't an excuse, this
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:36.000]  isn't a malfunction, this isn't some weird thing that keeps popping up everywhere.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:41.400]  This is a formula to dominate you and your family and the answer is thanking God for
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:44.920]  all the great things we have, getting on our knees, being good parents, being good members
[01:55:44.920 --> 01:55:49.840]  of the community, being strong and not submitting to the left and then saying oh just prove
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:54.760]  you're not hateful, prove you're nice, say a big fat man and a clown outfits a woman,
[01:55:54.760 --> 01:56:02.320]  put your child on their lap and let them ride horsey, that is a demonic simulation of pedophilia
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:08.960]  and we all know it, we just say no you are a fat evil man that wants access to children,
[01:56:08.960 --> 01:56:14.360]  we must all stop by increments, try to be friendly and try to get along so we don't
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:18.280]  get bullied, so we don't get attacked, so everybody's friendly and nice, there's no
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:25.280]  level of submission that is ever going to be enough for these people because this is
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:30.480]  Satanism, this is a plan, this is being carried out and this is the reality of what we're
[01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:35.720]  facing and that's why they want infowars.com and newswars.com and prisonplanet.com and
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:40.040]  those URLs taken down, that's why it's so important that you let everyone know that
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:46.040]  the real defense, the real battle cry, the real emergency transmission, the real war
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:50.520]  horn being blown to warn people is infowars.com and I thank you all for breaking through the
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:56.640]  enemy's attempt to block us, their attempt to censor us, you have overridden their AI
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:00.720]  and they're so angry and humanity is coming back from the dead but we've got to realize
[01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:04.640]  just how serious this is and understand why they want to overthrow the existing order
[01:57:04.640 --> 01:57:07.440]  that God gave us so that they themselves can play God.
[01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:12.200]  Now back to Owen Schreuer and the live global transmission that the only way it reaches
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:16.880]  out to people is when you spread the word about infowars.com, port slash show and local radio
[01:57:16.880 --> 01:57:21.040]  and TV stations in your area, we're counting on you, the children are counting on you and
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:25.400]  I know that we're going to win, thank you.
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:48.120]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:52.000]  I talk about this on the air and I know it stinks in the people but I've decided that
[01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.720]  we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements and that if you go back five, six years ago
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:58.880]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:02.320]  talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and
[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:05.640]  I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:09.240]  few years I'm like hey, we need to really support us or they'll shut us down, the biggest
[01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:11.960]  thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful
[01:58:11.960 --> 01:58:17.200]  they were and the left always has headlines everywhere, Jones sells unapproved supplements
[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:23.320]  that he claims are supplements, no under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement
[01:58:23.320 --> 01:58:26.720]  has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:31.080]  then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying
[01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:34.760]  to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:38.680]  work great, they have side effects, not with Mother Nature but Big Pharma doesn't want
[01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:40.960]  you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:48.880]  InfowarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:58:48.880 --> 01:58:53.760]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems and
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:56.640]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:58:56.640 --> 01:59:00.680]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist, that's what a globalist are
[01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:05.320]  obsessed with it trying to shut it down, I didn't invent all this, I went and researched
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:09.960]  the Renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity and I'm simply trying
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:15.200]  to bring it back and lo and behold it's super popular like it's always been.
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:19.200]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:24.640]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine, so whatever you do continue
[01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:28.960]  to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products at InfowarsStore.com, by
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:32.920]  spreading the articles, by spreading the videos and by praying for this operation and for
[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:37.440]  praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment, for myself and the
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:42.240]  whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've done because without
[01:59:42.240 --> 01:59:51.400]  you Infowars is nothing, you are the Infowars and I salute you.
[01:59:51.400 --> 02:00:18.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:34.280]  The
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:38.760]  most extensive investigation in modern American history we found the truth and so tonight
[02:00:38.760 --> 02:00:43.200]  we can say conclusively once again what we told you the day this all started, the whole
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:47.400]  thing is a crock, it never happened, they're relying to you.
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:51.480]  That's clear now, the debate is over, but that doesn't mean the Russia story has quite
[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:53.400]  ended, there are loose ends.
[02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:57.560]  For two and a half years some of the most powerful people in America, supposedly serious
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:04.320]  well educated people, very smart people, these people made wild and untrue and totally reckless
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:10.160]  allegations about issues critical to the life of this country, all on the basis of no evidence
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:11.760]  whatsoever.
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:15.400]  It's hard to believe they did that, but they did do it.
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:20.120]  What should happen to these people now, Congressman Adam Schiff for example, Schiff claimed he
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:26.000]  possessed actual evidence of Russian collusion and he didn't just say that one time, he said
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  it repeatedly.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.520]  And there is significant evidence of collusion, there is ample evidence and indeed there is
[02:01:32.520 --> 02:01:36.720]  of collusion of people in the Trump campaign with the Russians, I think there's plenty
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:39.280]  of evidence of collusion or conspiracy.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:45.240]  Well in the end you know what happened or didn't, Schiff did not produce the evidence,
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:48.200]  he didn't have it because it doesn't exist.
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:53.640]  Schiff was bluffing which is to say lying, he still is actually, as of yesterday Schiff
[02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:58.640]  was continuing to claim that the Trump campaign quote, embraced foreign help, made use of
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:02.160]  it and covered it up, in other words collusion.
[02:02:02.160 --> 02:02:06.520]  Schiff still believes the collusion hoax or does he?
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:11.040]  Today Adam Schiff went on CNN to carry water for his boss Nancy Pelosi, impeachment might
[02:02:11.040 --> 02:02:16.280]  not be a great idea, he told CNN's viewers, but wait, that doesn't seem to make sense.
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:20.920]  If Donald Trump is working for a hostile foreign power, as Adam Schiff has told us countless
[02:02:20.920 --> 02:02:25.280]  times that he is, how can we not impeach him?
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:29.400]  No one on CNN asked Adam Schiff to explain that contradiction unfortunately, not that
[02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:34.040]  it matters because think about it for a second and you'll see exactly what's going on.
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:39.320]  Adam Schiff never believed a word he was saying about Russian collusion, I suppose the good
[02:02:39.320 --> 02:02:44.160]  news is Schiff is not delusional, the bad news though is that Adam Schiff is a soulless
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:48.640]  liar, he's a man willing to say literally anything for political advantage and that's
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:52.960]  really the worst of all, being a lunatic would be much more appealing than that.
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:57.760]  Naturally Washington being the place that it is, Adam Schiff has been richly rewarded
[02:02:57.760 --> 02:02:59.680]  for his shameless deceit.
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:02.520]  He is still the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, that's one of the most powerful
[02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:07.000]  jobs in all of government, Schiff is all but certain to be there for years.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.320]  But what about his enablers, and there are a lot of them, the journalists, the pundits,
[02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:16.600]  the fellow lawmakers, who helped Adam Schiff tell his lies, these are the people you remember
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:21.000]  who blithely accused the sitting president of the United States of treason.
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:26.880]  The evidence suggests indeed Trump is, has been a pawn of the Russians.
[02:03:26.880 --> 02:03:34.080]  When you start to see a pattern where he basically spouts Putin's lies, then we have to ask the
[02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:37.840]  most unusual and frightening question about our own president.
[02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:41.480]  Why this president seems to be putting Russia's interests ahead of our own.
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.280]  Well Chrissy, the president's tweet trying to make the case that he's not a Russian
[02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:49.760]  asset really just undercuts his own defense, the president's tweet couldn't have been
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:52.680]  scripted better if it was written by Putin himself.
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:56.920]  This is nothing short of treasonous because it is a betrayal of the nation, he is giving
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:03:59.080]  aid and comfort to the enemy.
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:05.160]  What is their influence, whether winning or unwitting, by the Russians over President
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:06.160]  Trump?
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:13.760]  The possibility, the very real possibility, that President Putin holds damaging information
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:15.720]  over President Trump.
[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:21.080]  Trump's eagerness to sell out America proves the Russians must have something personally,
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:26.440]  politically, or financially on President Trump.
[02:04:26.440 --> 02:04:31.560]  It proves that Trump is committing treason, think about what you just saw, the last person
[02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:35.880]  in that montage was Nancy Pelosi, as you know she's the speaker of the house, third in line
[02:04:35.880 --> 02:04:36.880]  from the presidency.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:42.800]  She's the country's most powerful lawmaker, supposedly a wise and sober person, and if
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:44.480]  there she was telling you it's been proven.
[02:04:44.480 --> 02:04:48.320]  Well I mean you could ask the question what should happen to these Democrats that engage
[02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:56.320]  in this, but you could also ask the question what's the punishment for treason?
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:05:01.800]  Before I started working at InfoWars I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and InfoWars.com,
[02:05:01.800 --> 02:05:06.240]  but also the products at InfoWarsStore.com and there's one product that's offered at
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:11.640]  InfoWarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:15.680]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:19.440]  Telomere's and Telomere's support with your DNA.
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:24.360]  So I started to look into the science and what Telomere's were and how it can improve
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:27.920]  your health and longevity when you protect your Telomere's.
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:31.320]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive.
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:32.320]  Why?
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:34.440]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[02:05:34.440 --> 02:05:38.440]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[02:05:38.440 --> 02:05:44.720]  Telomere's support and they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[02:05:44.720 --> 02:05:46.240]  It is the elite supplement.
[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:50.080]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive.
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:55.920]  So you should take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:37.120]  I'm having people inquire about InfoWars Life Select's storeable foods.
[02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:41.680]  They're saying, hey, we've heard about storeable foods, but how do we know they're good?
[02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:43.840]  How do we know they're good quality?
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:49.760]  I know enough about Alex Jones and InfoWarsStore.com to know that, A, we wouldn't put anything
[02:07:49.760 --> 02:07:51.960]  out that's not great quality.
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:57.640]  But I know for a fact, because this is the strategy, the InfoWars Life Select storeable
[02:07:57.640 --> 02:08:00.240]  foods is the best quality.
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:02.160]  That's why it's called select.
[02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:07.280]  So most emergency storeable foods, we want everything to be organic, non-GMO and everything,
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:16.720]  but most storeable foods are just mostly meant to sustain for some substance, just emergency
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:17.720]  food.
[02:08:17.720 --> 02:08:25.600]  The select storeable food line is gourmet meals in storeable food fashion.
[02:08:25.600 --> 02:08:31.080]  So it's not just, okay, I have emergency food that I'm going to be able to eat.
[02:08:31.080 --> 02:08:33.760]  I have emergency food that I'm going to enjoy.
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:40.520]  I mean, I don't want to sit here and paint a dystopic future, but it's like, the power
[02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:45.080]  went out for a year and everybody's eating whatever they have, and you're over here literally
[02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:50.680]  having gourmet meals, like you are the elite.

[02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:18.320]  Now, the crew is aggregating the phone calls, and also remember that we will have coverage
[02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:24.360]  of the Clown World Part II, the Democrat debate, two night debate again, where it'll
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:27.920]  be featuring clowns like Beto O'Rourke pulling at 0%.
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:33.200]  So I'm proud to announce that I am now tied with Beto O'Rourke for the Democrat nominee.
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:39.200]  Okay, let me just do a news blitz here before we start taking phone calls.
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:45.040]  President Trump on Twitter today, there may or may not be national security concerns with
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:48.160]  regard to Google and their relationship with China.
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:51.960]  Oh, hey, if there is a problem, we will find out about it.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:54.600]  I sincerely hope there is not.
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:56.160]  Wow.
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:59.360]  Apple, Google should be shaking in their boots right now.
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:05.200]  They're being exposed from the inside, meddling and rigging US elections and colluding with
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:07.240]  China now.
[02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:12.080]  This is a big trouble for Google as antitrust investigations are beginning.
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:13.080]  Good news.
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:17.000]  Trump says Apple will not be given tariff waiver or relief for Mac Pro parts that are made
[02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  in China.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000]  Make them in the USA.
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  No tariffs.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  Love it.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.840]  Love it.
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:27.320]  And then Trump says, Fox News is that again so different from what they used to be during
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:28.600]  the 2016 primaries.
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:32.520]  Actually, President Trump, I know that you have to remember that Fox News did not want
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:34.920]  you to be president or get the Republican nominee.
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:37.160]  I think you're being kind here.
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:42.960]  But now he's calling out how Fox News is running the fake polls that say Biden is beating him.
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:49.960]  Any poll that says Biden is beating Trump is about as fake as a $3 bill.
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:57.760]  Going on, well, Biden basically, he knows he's basically dead in the water.
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:00.720]  And so he's trying to do anything to get his poll numbers up.
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:03.920]  He's saying you can't let people say BS and not respond to it.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:06.880]  That isn't unless you're Trump, then you're not allowed to say anything or Roger Stone
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:09.480]  where they just gag you and you're not allowed to talk when people make up everything and
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:10.920]  lie about you all day long.
[02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:14.400]  And the judge says, oh, Roger, you can't talk job.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:15.400]  Oh, this is great.
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:18.640]  This is classic because I've been talking about this and it's just it's so obvious what the
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:19.640]  Democrats are doing.
[02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:21.920]  It's it's basic stuff.
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:24.840]  But because they're such good con men, they get away with it.
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:28.960]  Job creators, network member warns, Democrats are quietly trying to pass a massive payroll
[02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:29.960]  tax increase.
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:31.200]  So what's the what do you do here?
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:35.760]  If you're the Democrats and you need to increase taxes, you increase money coming in that you
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:37.840]  can steal.
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:42.720]  You first increase the minimum wage to $15 or $20 an hour.
[02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:45.640]  You then increase the taxes on payroll.
[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:49.720]  So that now it's not that the employer is getting $15 an hour.
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:54.880]  The employer is still getting less or whatever they were making before the government gets
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:55.960]  that money.
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:59.640]  So let's say you're making $12 an hour.
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:03.480]  And now your employer says, OK, the government says I have to pay you $15 an hour.
[02:12:03.480 --> 02:12:05.400]  OK, well, now you're getting paid $15 an hour.
[02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:09.520]  But your paycheck doesn't change because the Democrats just took that extra three dollars
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:13.160]  of you from you in taxes.
[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:16.560]  It's the greatest con game right in your face and the Democrats just do it.
[02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:20.880]  And the average Democrat voter can't even see it, stunning.
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:21.880]  So that's what they do.
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:24.920]  Oh, we want to give you a minimum wage.
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:28.920]  And then they're like, oh, yeah, look, we're finally giving people a working wage.
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:31.880]  And then the Democrats come in and say, by the way, we're going to tax that wage.
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:37.920]  And it turns out I guarantee you if this works out and I bet it will in New York, this will
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:41.080]  happen in New York and California, I bet on it.
[02:12:41.080 --> 02:12:43.920]  They'll make the minimum wage law.
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:48.560]  And let's say you're making $12 an hour now, and then they pass the minimum wage law, you're
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:50.760]  making $15 an hour.
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:55.440]  When you're making $12, let's say you're making $9 in change after you get your paycheck
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:57.320]  an hour with taxes.
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:00.920]  And then you're going to see, oh, you're so excited you got your minimum wage increase.
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:03.160]  You're saying that you're so excited you're making $15 an hour, you get your paycheck
[02:13:03.160 --> 02:13:04.160]  back, you turn down.
[02:13:04.160 --> 02:13:05.160]  Wait a second.
[02:13:05.160 --> 02:13:06.800]  I'm only making $8.50 an hour.
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:10.840]  When I was making $12 an hour after taxes, I made $9 in change an hour.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:13.560]  Now that I'm making $15 an hour, I'm only making $8 in change.
[02:13:13.560 --> 02:13:14.560]  What's up with that?
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:17.000]  The Democrats just gave themselves more money.
[02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.240]  That's all they did.
[02:13:18.240 --> 02:13:24.480]  They increased the minimum wage so that they had more taxable income on you.
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:26.240]  And that's what's going to happen in New York and California.
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:27.240]  I guarantee it.
[02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:28.240]  Watch for that headline.
[02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:33.200]  If they are able to get through with this, that's going to be next.
[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:38.080]  Here's still wide open, look, this is what's going on at the border, folks.
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:44.880]  Record 61,000 migrant children surged over border, 230 million spent for snacks, diapers,
[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:49.120]  baby formula, and then we're told, we suck, they're treated like crap, you're a racist
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:50.120]  bigot.
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:53.400]  No, we do more for these people than any other country in the world, all other countries
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:55.080]  in the world combined.
[02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:57.600]  And then we're told we're bad.
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:03.160]  And meanwhile, we become economic slaves and our cities get more violent and dangerous
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:05.360]  with criminals and drugs and everything coming in.
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:08.280]  Don't believe me?
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:11.320]  Just wait until you see these stories.
[02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:18.200]  16 Camp Pendleton Marines arrested by NCIS for alleged human smuggling and drug offenses.
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:19.200]  Where are they doing it?
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:22.000]  The US-Mexico border.
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:23.560]  Here's one from the Independent.
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:29.080]  Like Frankenstein, women's head attached to man's body found lying next to bucket of
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:31.080]  human parts in lab.
[02:14:31.080 --> 02:14:32.080]  Where is this?
[02:14:32.080 --> 02:14:33.080]  Arizona.
[02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:34.080]  Why is this?
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:35.720]  Because the border's wide open.
[02:14:35.720 --> 02:14:41.760]  Video, border agents give illegals hand up hill around wall into America, so now literally
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:44.280]  we're helping them into the country, and so fine.
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:45.600]  And then we're just told we're bad.
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:50.960]  So we give them everything, healthcare, food, shelter, doctors, water, everything they want,
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:54.640]  give them literally a helping hand, and then we're told we're racist, we're running concentration
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:55.640]  camps.
[02:14:55.640 --> 02:14:56.640]  Sick of it, man.
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:02.800]  And by the way, we pay for all of it, all of it.
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:08.800]  In pop culture, if you want to call it that, but it's videos going viral, DC tourists savagely
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:13.280]  beaten, stomped, spit on by gang of youths at Hilton Hotel.
[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:19.000]  Yeah, it's just like the other DC, it looked like they were Korean tourists or Chinese tourists,
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.960]  and the one aggressive anti-Trumper comes up and starts getting in their face, rips
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:25.400]  their hat off, throws it to the ground.
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:26.720]  These people are out of control.
[02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:30.200]  And then, how about all the videos of the police?
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:33.440]  There's a new trend in New York where you just go up and you throw water, buckets of
[02:15:33.440 --> 02:15:36.480]  water, hit them with squirt guns on police, it's out of control.
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:39.560]  Total disrespect for the cops, but the cops are the bad guys.
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:43.200]  And then Judge slashes roundup verdict from 2 billion to 86 million.
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:44.720]  Boy, that's how they do that.
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.520]  Okay, the news is following this.
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:50.200]  Let's hit them with a 2 billion dollar fine to get them off our back, and then all right,
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:51.200]  they're not looking anymore.
[02:15:51.200 --> 02:15:52.640]  Let's slash it down to 86 million.
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:55.320]  Boy, Monsanto and Roundup win again.
[02:15:55.320 --> 02:16:00.520]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:04.760]  backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[02:16:04.760 --> 02:16:06.520]  important message you'll ever hear.
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:10.440]  Bill Hyde here, I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on
[02:16:10.440 --> 02:16:15.040]  our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:16.040]  off the grid.
[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:19.960]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:21.440]  bank of the Mississippi.
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:25.240]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:29.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:33.360]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:34.720]  So here's what you should do right now.
[02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:39.000]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.

[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:45.360]  of bonuses too.

[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:52.360]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.

[02:16:56.080 --> 02:17:00.000]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:01.560]  I sued the IRS in one.
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:04.520]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:07.800]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[02:17:07.800 --> 02:17:10.040]  tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:11.360]  I can help you too.

[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:40.680]  to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun but that's not what's important, the enemy
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:41.680]  could win.
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:43.720]  We're a key chess piece in this fight.

[02:18:47.880 --> 02:18:51.600]  and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:56.520]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:03.360]  As we gather this evening in the joy of freedom we remember that all share a truly extraordinary
[02:19:03.360 --> 02:19:04.360]  heritage.
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:10.760]  Together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told, the story of America.
[02:19:10.760 --> 02:19:16.160]  It is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:20.560]  know is right and what they know is true.
[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:26.960]  As long as we stay true to our cause, as long as we remember our great history, as long
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:34.280]  as we never ever stop fighting for a better future then there will be nothing that America
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:20:02.960]  can not do.
[02:20:04.280 --> 02:20:25.360]  Alright, we're going to your phone calls here before we're joined by Mike Adams, real
[02:20:25.360 --> 02:20:27.480]  quick though.
[02:20:27.480 --> 02:20:33.360]  You saw the president address Google in China today, let me kind of put a bookend on that.
[02:20:33.360 --> 02:20:37.960]  Google's in big trouble, they got exposed twice by Project Veritas for all the election
[02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:43.640]  meddling that they're engaged in, the manipulation of search results, the bias.
[02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:53.720]  You then have Talsy Gabbard suing Google for $50 million because of the manipulation
[02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:56.840]  they engaged in with her advertisements during the first presidential debate.
[02:20:56.840 --> 02:20:59.160]  Look, we told you they would never let Talsy Gabbard win.
[02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:02.440]  I mean, you're seeing the power structure expose itself right now.
[02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:07.760]  Google is keeping Talsy Gabbard out of office or attempting to, just like they want to keep
[02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:08.760]  Trump out of office.
[02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:11.840]  So really, Trump and Gabbard should combine, but Gabbard's a purist, he never would, she
[02:21:11.840 --> 02:21:14.600]  goes for the whole fake Russian collusion hoax.
[02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:21.000]  And then Australia is about to get Facebook and Google to make their algorithms public.
[02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:22.960]  We'll see if that happens.
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:28.280]  And now Facebook co-founder campaigning to break up big tech monopoly he helped create
[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:30.680]  and that's Chris Hughes.
[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:39.520]  So the big tech machine is in trouble for all the power they have co-opted and now used
[02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:44.080]  to collude against the American Republic.
[02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:48.800]  You have China outlines space war plans.
[02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:55.280]  That's from Bill Gertz at the Free Beacon, Joe Manchin, the Democrat Senator from Virginia.
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:58.360]  This is a pretty wild one actually.
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:02.400]  China has promised an $84 billion investment in West Virginia.
[02:22:02.400 --> 02:22:06.160]  The West Virginia annual budget is $4 billion a year.
[02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:11.400]  So China's moving in with $84 billion into West Virginia.
[02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:15.680]  Not a big fan of Joe Manchin, but I mean, at least he's got a head on his shoulders as
[02:22:15.680 --> 02:22:20.080]  a Democrat Senator and is questioning this, yeah.
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:22.160]  What is China doing in West Virginia?
[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:29.360]  One you have, this was pushed all over the national news in Yahoo, Hong Kong protests
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:37.400]  become a global problem and now China is saying that the West specifically the United States
[02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:41.960]  is behind all the Hong Kong protests.
[02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:45.840]  So is that a conspiracy theory or what?
[02:22:45.840 --> 02:22:48.320]  So just some updates there.
[02:22:48.320 --> 02:22:52.760]  Now let's go out to the phone lines.
[02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:55.040]  Let's go to, this is an interesting one.
[02:22:55.040 --> 02:22:57.120]  We've got some callers.
[02:22:57.120 --> 02:23:01.080]  Let's go to Maddie calling in from Alaska today.
[02:23:01.080 --> 02:23:02.080]  Go ahead, Maddie.
[02:23:02.080 --> 02:23:03.080]  Hi.
[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:04.080]  Oh my goodness.
[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:05.080]  I'm so excited.
[02:23:05.080 --> 02:23:11.440]  I just want to plug in on your guys' oxy powder.
[02:23:11.440 --> 02:23:18.240]  I had a hormone imbalance when I was 13 and my breasts would start leaking fluid and then
[02:23:18.240 --> 02:23:21.680]  I told my mom like, mom, let's get some oxy powder, let's just try it.
[02:23:21.680 --> 02:23:26.880]  She's like, okay, so we tried it and after I started taking it, my hormone imbalance
[02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:28.000]  went away.
[02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.000]  It was cleared.
[02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:39.600]  I was healthy as a horse and it was awesome, especially your iodine and your B12, your
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:40.840]  female force, all of it.
[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:41.840]  It's amazing.
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:44.360]  Your guys' products are awesome.
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:46.640]  Well we appreciate you shopping at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:48.760]  We're glad that you've had a good experience.
[02:23:48.760 --> 02:23:49.760]  Yeah.
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:59.640]  And another thing I want to say, people controversy about using what they believe, the calm mood.
[02:23:59.640 --> 02:24:01.520]  For example, I'm Jewish.
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:03.200]  I don't go by that.
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:11.800]  I'm also Patriot, obviously, but it has been edited multiple times and the reason being
[02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:15.160]  has to do with the wagon, the Pope.
[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:21.840]  They hold a lot of the secrets of creation and religious stuff.
[02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:22.840]  Yeah.
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:27.280]  And not only that, I mean, the Vatican, whenever there's like big archeological discoveries
[02:24:27.280 --> 02:24:32.080]  that kind of would raise questions about human history, they immediately claim it and build
[02:24:32.080 --> 02:24:34.960]  a church on it and bury it.
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:39.040]  You've got the story where they're searching for this missing teen for decades ago and
[02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:42.760]  they find a bunch of bones and human remains in the Vatican City.
[02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:49.800]  I mean, yeah, the Vatican and their role in covering up human history and manipulating
[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:51.880]  the power structure is very important.
[02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:53.760]  Thank you so much for the call, Matty.
[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:58.160]  Let's go to Cody calling in from Vancouver.
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:00.120]  I guess Vancouver, you're in Canada.
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:01.120]  Go ahead, Cody.
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:02.120]  I accuse you.
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:03.120]  I accuse.
[02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:04.120]  Off with your head.
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:05.120]  How's it going on?
[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:06.120]  Good.
[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:07.120]  Thanks for calling.
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:08.120]  Yeah.
[02:25:08.120 --> 02:25:13.000]  I just wanted to get in a quick point.
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  I've been listening to you guys for over 10 years.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  I listen every day.
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.880]  I hear you guys, I've been promoting Trump since the beginning and got me on the Trump
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:22.880]  train.
[02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:27.520]  And one thing you guys, I haven't heard you mention much is that our theory that I have
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:34.120]  is that the reason that Trump wants to build the wall or so pro wall is to stop the North
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:39.240]  American Union because I feel like if Hillary Clinton had to become president, 100% right
[02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:41.040]  now we'd be faced with the American Union.
[02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:44.000]  Well, let me answer this though, Cody, before you go any further, do you think Trump wants
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:45.920]  to build a wall?
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:48.240]  I think so, for sure.
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:49.840]  See, I don't know.
[02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:54.160]  I had to question that because he hasn't built the wall and I feel like if he really
[02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:55.800]  wanted to, he could have.
[02:25:55.800 --> 02:26:01.800]  I feel like maybe the Congress and the Democrats are trying everything to stop him from doing
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:02.800]  that.
[02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:04.320]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:05.320]  I'm not denying that.
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:08.400]  I'm just saying he could have built the wall if he really wanted to.
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:11.600]  I've always questioned whether he really wanted a wall or not if it wasn't just a political
[02:26:11.600 --> 02:26:13.600]  pawn.
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:18.840]  My theory on it is he's been aware of the North American Union and it's kind of like
[02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:20.000]  a stopper to it.
[02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.920]  You know, putting a wall there kind of defeats there openly.
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:23.920]  I see.
[02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:27.800]  Yeah, kind of to like stop this from coming like an EU situation.
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:28.800]  Exactly.
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:29.800]  That's what I've always thought.
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:34.920]  Yeah, I mean, you just had a story out of Mexico, there were some family, Mexican drug
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:38.800]  cartels pulled them out of their car, shot them, executed them right in front of their
[02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:39.800]  kid.
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:40.800]  Great.
[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:42.800]  We should open the borders then.
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:46.480]  Yeah, I mean, you know, they're sending their best.
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:50.520]  Another thing I wanted to mention quickly too, there's a breaking story right now in Canada.
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:55.520]  There's not much on it because the RCMP is telling the media to not talk about it.
[02:26:55.520 --> 02:27:00.920]  Two days ago or three, well, I guess it happened a couple of weeks ago, but they've been hunting
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:06.960]  these two teenagers who are 18 and 19, Cam McLeod, the other ones like Briar Schmiglach
[02:27:06.960 --> 02:27:08.360]  here, something like that.
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:10.840]  They're both from Port Albany on the island.
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:15.040]  They thought these two males were missing and part of these murders that were happening
[02:27:15.040 --> 02:27:19.400]  in Northern DC, but they've now made them the suspects.
[02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:23.640]  They're on a ban hunt across Canada for these two, they're saying they're alt-right extremists.
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:29.600]  I read through tons of articles yesterday, like digging into the claims about them being
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:30.600]  alt-right.
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:32.960]  And to be honest, there's not much.
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:38.600]  There's one picture of the Briar kid with a Nazi tattoo or something like that and that
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:44.120]  in army gear, but it also says that that kid was part of the communist, Victoria communist
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:45.120] ...
[02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:47.200]  Well, you know what the media does, if they want to make a story, you know what the media
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:51.200]  does, they'll take anything they can to try to label someone, their political opposition,
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:55.240]  even though it probably, it sounds like this guy's just probably deranged and had communist
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:57.400]  stuff, Nazi stuff, whatever.
[02:27:57.400 --> 02:27:59.040]  But we'll follow that, Cody.
[02:27:59.040 --> 02:28:00.040]  Thanks for the call.
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:01.040]  Let's squeeze one more in here.
[02:28:01.040 --> 02:28:02.040]  Let's go to Jacob in Kansas.
[02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:03.040]  Go ahead, Jacob.
[02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:08.040]  Hey, just give me one second.
[02:28:08.040 --> 02:28:09.040]  Okay.
[02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:11.040]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:12.040]  Good.
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:13.040]  Thanks for calling.
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:17.240]  You're the only one I haven't been able to get a hold of yet.
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:25.200]  I've already called Alex and David Knight one time, but I just had a quick point about
[02:28:25.200 --> 02:28:28.720]  you guys' ability to make money.
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:36.200]  Just one simple change you might be able to make on the website, and that would be like
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:42.880]  all you need to do really is, all the info warriors out here really want to help out
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:47.320]  with the info learning, all you have to do is put a blood on there that says what you
[02:28:47.320 --> 02:28:50.520]  like to pay for the price.
[02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:53.400]  Instead of the discounted price?
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:54.400]  You can donate.
[02:28:54.400 --> 02:28:55.400]  We have a donate tab.
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:00.480]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:04.720]  backup system that we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most
[02:29:04.720 --> 02:29:06.520]  important message you'll ever hear.
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:07.520]  Bill Hyde here.
[02:29:07.520 --> 02:29:11.600]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:15.840]  system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[02:29:15.840 --> 02:29:19.920]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east
[02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:21.400]  bank of the Mississippi.
[02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:25.240]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:29.000]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:33.320]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory.
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:39.000]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.160]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:45.240]  Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[02:29:45.240 --> 02:29:49.600]  In the best part, you're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:52.320]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:56.080]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[02:29:56.080 --> 02:30:00.280]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:01.360]  They are technocrats.
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:05.160]  They are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your
[02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:09.680]  own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:10.680]  with AI gods.
[02:30:10.680 --> 02:30:14.280]  Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:15.280]  third dimension.
[02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:19.480]  But one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control
[02:30:19.480 --> 02:30:21.800]  in our lives is our bodies.
[02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:27.080]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from foreslives.com, I couldn't do it.
[02:30:27.080 --> 02:30:31.400]  That's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:37.120]  medical bottleman and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[02:30:37.120 --> 02:30:42.000]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:43.000]  to find anywhere.
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:48.160]  It is amazing, experience pure medical bottleman B12 for yourself and fund the second American

[02:30:57.040 --> 02:31:04.000]  Serving with info wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee and luckily

[02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:32.360]  Owen Troyer.
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:36.720]  Mike Adams from naturalnews.com joins me now.
[02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:44.040]  We're going to continue to take your phone calls, but Mike, I know you want to weigh
[02:33:44.040 --> 02:33:49.320]  in on the Mueller testimony yesterday, but Mike, I got to share something with you here
[02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:51.920]  real quick before we do this, okay?
[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:53.160]  Are you ready for this?
[02:33:53.160 --> 02:33:55.040]  Are you ready for this devastation?
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:56.040]  Ready.
[02:33:56.040 --> 02:34:04.480]  Now, I'm sure you've seen the heat wave that's been recorded in Europe, Mike.
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:10.000]  And we've had record temperatures in Paris, they're saying it's up to 108 degrees.
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:16.840]  Well, I wanted to bring this exclusive out right here because the geniuses of the Democrat
[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:22.360]  party and the liberal media have figured it out that this is a direct result of Trump
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:26.040]  removing himself from the Paris Climate Accord, obviously.
[02:34:26.040 --> 02:34:28.720]  As soon as Trump removed us from that, the temperatures went up 20 degrees.
[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:31.280]  But actually, Mike, I've got the exclusive.
[02:34:31.280 --> 02:34:32.720]  That's not even accurate.
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:36.840]  I know that's going to blow your mind that Trump removing us from the Paris Climate Accord
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:41.680]  didn't cause temperatures to soar in Paris, but I know what did, Mike.
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:47.320]  President Trump actually has a heat ray, and he's beaming it down on Paris right now.
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:53.440]  And so now Brian Stelter and Rachel Maddow and the rest of them, you guys can have this
[02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:54.440]  exclusive.
[02:34:54.440 --> 02:34:59.040]  Trump is literally beaming a heat ray down on Paris right now.
[02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:01.600]  And so that's why the record temperature.
[02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:03.440]  So this is totally Trump's fault.
[02:35:03.440 --> 02:35:06.160]  He's using his heat ray right now.
[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:08.880]  And he got it from the Russians, by the way, it's Russian technology.
[02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:10.480]  No, you're exactly right.
[02:35:10.480 --> 02:35:11.480]  I think you've nailed it.
[02:35:11.480 --> 02:35:15.680]  And he used the same heat ray to scramble Robert Mueller's brains.
[02:35:15.680 --> 02:35:22.800]  So Robert Mueller has been fried with the global warming beam.
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:24.960]  And that's why he's got no brains.
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:25.960]  Heat ray.
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:26.960]  What's the weather?
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:27.960]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:34.200]  No, look, the mass hallucination over climate change is pervasive, but it's really a sign
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:41.360]  of the insanity of the left, where a generation ago, everybody would have said, oh, it's summer.
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:42.360]  Things get hot.
[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:48.440]  You can go back to photographs in the 1960s or the 50s of people playing in the fire hydrant
[02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:50.760]  water in New York City in the summer.
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:51.760]  Guess what?
[02:35:51.760 --> 02:35:52.760]  Summers are hot.
[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:53.760]  Guess what?
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:35:59.360]  The Earth tilts on its axis, which means northern regions are exposed to more sunlight radiation
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:04.800]  during the summer months as the Earth is orbiting around the sun with a tilt relative to its
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:06.000]  orbital plane.
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:10.840]  But again, you can't explain physics to liberals because to them, it's all pure emotion.
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:14.400]  Hey, maybe they've all had their brains scrambled with the heat beam.
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:16.360]  Maybe it's already happened, Owen.
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:21.560]  Well, look, I don't know, I mean, it's really scrambled by the media.
[02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:25.360]  The media is the heat beam scrambling their brains, where they fall for this whole Mueller
[02:36:25.360 --> 02:36:26.360]  thing.
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:28.880]  And if you just look at the left commentary, they're still claiming victory.
[02:36:28.880 --> 02:36:30.040]  They're saying, oh, more proof.
[02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:31.040]  There's Russian collusion.
[02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:32.040]  There's still no evidence.
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:38.000]  Like, I've never seen this where you claim you know something and there's just nothing.
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:39.000]  There's no evidence.
[02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:40.000]  There's zero.
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:43.080]  Well, and plus the Robert Mueller logic is so twisted.
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:46.040]  So I have a bombshell for you here, Owen.
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:51.120]  After a long extended investigation, we have not found any proof that Robert Mueller is
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:53.440]  not a child raping pedophile.
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:36:56.200]  So that's Robert Mueller logic for you.
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:36:57.200]  You can-
[02:36:57.200 --> 02:36:58.200]  Yeah, no, that's right.
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:02.440]  We can't exonerate Robert Mueller from being a child sex trafficker.
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:04.080]  We can't exonerate him from that.
[02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:05.080]  That's right.
[02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:06.080]  That's right.
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:08.720]  We don't have any evidence to prove it, but that doesn't mean we can't exonerate him.
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:09.720]  Exactly.
[02:37:09.720 --> 02:37:10.720]  That's his logic.
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:12.520]  Of course, we're saying this in satire.
[02:37:12.520 --> 02:37:16.200]  We're mocking his fried brains or scrambled brains.
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:22.800]  That should be a new meme, the scrambled brains for breakfast of Robert Mueller.
[02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:24.640]  Little cannibalism humor there for you.
[02:37:24.640 --> 02:37:29.040]  But the guy is totally insane and his logic is so twisted.
[02:37:29.040 --> 02:37:33.920]  But as we know, the only person in Washington, D.C. who did not read the Mueller report was
[02:37:33.920 --> 02:37:35.400]  Robert Mueller.
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:37.080]  And he obviously didn't write it.
[02:37:37.080 --> 02:37:42.640]  He was obviously created by Rod Rosenstein, right, or Rosenstein, how are you pronounce
[02:37:42.640 --> 02:37:43.640]  it?
[02:37:43.640 --> 02:37:45.080]  That's the mastermind behind all of this.
[02:37:45.080 --> 02:37:46.080]  It's pronounced rat.
[02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:47.080]  Absolutely.
[02:37:47.080 --> 02:37:48.080]  It's pronounced rat.
[02:37:48.080 --> 02:37:49.080]  Thank you.
[02:37:49.080 --> 02:37:50.080]  Thank you.
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:51.080]  Thanks for that, Craig.
[02:37:51.080 --> 02:37:52.080]  It's pronounced vermin.
[02:37:52.080 --> 02:37:58.320]  Well, yeah, it actually, and actually people believe it was actually written by Andrew Weisman,
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:38:02.040]  but it was clear that Mueller didn't write it because, and they say, oh, he didn't memorize
[02:38:02.040 --> 02:38:03.040]  the report.
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:04.040]  No, no, what do you mean that?
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:06.600]  He didn't even have the instincts to know what was in the report.
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:08.760]  He didn't have the instinctual responses.
[02:38:08.760 --> 02:38:09.960]  Now, think about it.
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:16.120]  If you were about to testify before Congress and the world is on your shoulders, you're
[02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:18.720]  supposed to make Trump look guilty.
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:22.400]  You're supposed to underscore the call for impeachment.
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:26.280]  Wouldn't you have studied the report that has your name on it?
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:31.280]  I mean, if Robert Mueller was a college student, he would have failed the class.
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:35.760]  He would have been kicked out of the school for failing to do any homework whatsoever.
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:37.680]  And they say this guy's a hero.
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:39.920]  Look, I salute our veterans.
[02:38:39.920 --> 02:38:45.160]  I salute people who served in our military, but I do not salute somebody who served in
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:51.560]  our military, and then like Robert Mueller, to betray the country is a traitor to America.
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:56.800]  That you don't get a free pass just because you served and then you later betrayed America.
[02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:00.000]  I salute everybody who serves America and then defends America.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.840]  I want to be clear about that.
[02:39:01.840 --> 02:39:06.560]  And by the way, John McCain is in the same treason boat as far as I'm concerned as Robert
[02:39:06.560 --> 02:39:07.560]  Mueller.
[02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:09.560]  So there you go.
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:16.120]  Well, you'd think that this embarrassment of a testimony would end the Russian inclusion
[02:39:16.120 --> 02:39:18.720]  narrative, but it's only breathed more fire into it somehow.
[02:39:18.720 --> 02:39:24.120]  Amazingly, this is the reverse opposite of the real world that we live in now with the
[02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:26.600]  Democrat liberal progressives.
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:34.560]  Let's take a call on this and let's go to Brian in Iowa on the Mueller report.
[02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:37.800]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:41.760]  The guy was asked about the spilled Gatorade up by the TV.
[02:39:41.760 --> 02:39:42.760]  No one knows anything.
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:43.760]  He doesn't know anything.
[02:39:43.760 --> 02:39:46.640]  And then all of a sudden, he didn't read his own report.
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:49.640]  I mean, come on, seriously, who buys this stuff?
[02:39:49.640 --> 02:39:51.120]  Yeah, he can't hear.
[02:39:51.120 --> 02:39:52.120]  He can't think.
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:53.640]  He doesn't know what's in the report.
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:54.640]  I mean, it's an embarrassment.
[02:39:54.640 --> 02:39:59.160]  That's exactly what my kids do when I say, why is there Gatorade over the TV?
[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:01.160]  Yeah, nobody was there.
[02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:02.160]  I don't know anything.
[02:40:02.160 --> 02:40:03.160]  What TV?
[02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:04.160]  Exactly.
[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:05.160]  They have no idea.
[02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:08.360]  There must have been somebody else broke in the house and then spilled the Gatorade and
[02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:09.360]  then left.
[02:40:09.360 --> 02:40:10.360]  It was the cat.
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:11.360]  It was the dog.
[02:40:11.360 --> 02:40:12.360]  We don't have a cat or dog.
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:13.360]  Exactly.
[02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:14.360]  Exactly.
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:18.520]  And my point is that who's buying this stuff?
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:24.960]  Because I'm not on any side of the political aisle and I'm not buying it.
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:28.240]  Well, and that's my biggest, that's kind of my biggest question, Brian.
[02:40:28.240 --> 02:40:32.440]  And I'm glad that you mentioned that because I'm sitting here saying if you're just a consumer
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:37.840]  of news, not even politicized, just neutral watching this, I mean, again, I'm not a Republican.
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:42.080]  I just look at, I mean, I can just decide for what's real, what's not, who's a fraud,
[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:45.440]  who's a phony, who's not, who's got evidence, who doesn't, I mean, so you're saying just
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:50.480]  as a neutral viewer, it's obvious how phony, Mueller and the Democrats are.
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:54.800]  They all use the same exact language like they've been given a press brief, okay, read
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:41:02.400]  from this, line from line, and if you deviate, just call someone a racist or a bigot or whatever.
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:05.720]  The ad hominem attacks that they like to do.
[02:41:05.720 --> 02:41:11.960]  Yeah, that seems to be the lowest form of an argument that they engage in.
[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:16.960]  But I would imagine the average American that saw this is, A, embarrassed that this is what
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:18.440]  the country has gotten to.
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:24.280]  And then, B, curious, why do we have a group of people going with a false narrative that
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:27.680]  they know is fake, everybody knows is fake, why are they committing to this?
[02:41:27.680 --> 02:41:29.000]  Do they have no shame?
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:30.800]  Are they in some sort of criminal collusion?
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:33.320]  And I think the most likely odd is the latter.
[02:41:33.320 --> 02:41:36.120]  Let's squeeze in one more call from Nolan in Illinois before the break.
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:37.120]  Go ahead, Nolan.
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:39.760]  Hey, Nolan and Mike.
[02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:44.880]  Real quick, I just want to plug Mike's documentary, Biosludged.
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:50.320]  Anybody who hasn't seen it should go check that out.
[02:41:50.320 --> 02:41:56.120]  My biggest question from the Mueller report was why didn't any of the Republicans bring
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:04.240]  up Seth Rich and the entire, it was all fabricated around that, there's no way the Russians downloaded
[02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:05.240]  that.
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:10.360]  Well, I think Seth Rich is kind of like an untouchable thing right now, honestly, in
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:11.360]  DC.
[02:42:11.360 --> 02:42:18.480]  Yeah, isn't that amazing that there are still topics that are off bounds, even to the patriots
[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:23.320]  who are trying to defend this country, and by the way, to the caller, thank you for your
[02:42:23.320 --> 02:42:24.640]  mention of Biosludged.
[02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:29.720]  But think about it, you've got people in Congress today still can't question 9-11, and why did
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:34.960]  a third building collapse perfectly when the third building wasn't hit by an airplane?
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:35.960]  There you go.
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:36.960]  Wow, it defies them all.
[02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:37.960]  Stop it, Mike.
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:40.680]  They were as a plane crash in Pennsylvania, even though there was no plane.
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:44.760]  There was a plane that ran into the Pentagon, even though there was no plane.
[02:42:44.760 --> 02:42:45.760]  Wait.
[02:42:45.760 --> 02:42:46.760]  Yeah.
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:47.760]  No, Russian collusion.
[02:42:47.760 --> 02:42:48.760]  Yeah.
[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:51.200]  It's amazing what the media can do to people.
[02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:57.200]  It's like you don't believe your own two eyes, you know?
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:43:01.960]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.
[02:43:01.960 --> 02:43:06.600]  That's why we created the 8-Pack PowerStack, your go-to option for the building blocks

[02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:54.440]  routine.

[02:43:59.480 --> 02:44:03.840]  The other thing that's unique about Infowars is it isn't the only network of this reach
[02:44:03.840 --> 02:44:07.680]  that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate trigger daddy, that's not backed
[02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:11.080]  by some billionaire, that's not being funded by a secret foreign government.
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:13.000]  It is completely independent of all that.
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.720]  It is an old-school American 1776-style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press
[02:44:18.720 --> 02:44:22.440]  and freedom of speech that, in fact, the founders were so concerned with, at the beginning
[02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:26.920]  of the country, they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:30.440]  because this was the kind of press they wanted, and that ultimately we now live in an era
[02:44:30.440 --> 02:44:34.320]  where they've mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies
[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:38.320]  who've been able to control and manipulate what news it views, be it persons allowed
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:43.040]  to have or express or hear, and the Infowars audience has broken through that, that they
[02:44:43.040 --> 02:44:47.840]  are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate American democracy and freedom,
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:52.080]  and that's why there's been an unprecedented onslaught of the platforming, defamation,
[02:44:52.080 --> 02:45:22.000]  lawfare, and liable targeting youth.

[02:51:25.920 --> 02:51:27.760]  because they have the big corporate media
[02:51:27.760 --> 02:51:29.000]  they have the big banks

[02:51:53.200 --> 02:51:57.520]  but the courts were shipping a big fat blob pink lipstick
[02:51:57.520 --> 02:51:59.520]  going in and telling women

[02:52:09.600 --> 02:52:10.640]  it's all
[02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:12.880]  about bringing your twelve-year-old daughters
[02:52:12.880 --> 02:52:14.160]  bring them to me
[02:52:14.160 --> 02:52:16.040]  all of publicity stunt
[02:52:16.040 --> 02:52:18.840]  knowing the more out of control they are the more
[02:52:18.840 --> 02:52:21.240]  defended they're going to be there's a big report
[02:52:21.240 --> 02:52:23.120]  but we put together that's very important
[02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:26.680]  but i thought you could please email out text message spread
[02:52:26.680 --> 02:52:28.120]  that's an alert
[02:52:28.120 --> 02:52:30.360]  the left is now adopted
[02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:33.960]  and preparing for a violent revolution they've already lost the headline is
[02:52:33.960 --> 02:52:36.160]  one for memory here we started today
[02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:37.440]  uh... left
[02:52:37.440 --> 02:52:39.600]  preparing violent revolution
[02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:41.440]  based on the france
[02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:43.720]  uh... great care of the french revolution
[02:52:43.720 --> 02:52:45.680]  and they're actually admitting it
[02:52:45.680 --> 02:52:48.040]  it's an historical record they know it
[02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:51.440]  and they believe this is their third big way
[02:52:51.440 --> 02:52:54.720]  first was the french revolution then the takeover of russia and china and now
[02:52:54.720 --> 02:52:58.280]  this is the big enchilada the takedown of europe and the united states
[02:52:58.280 --> 02:53:00.040]  where they will then openly
[02:53:00.040 --> 02:53:02.440]  uh... established their satanic pedophile kingdom
[02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:05.720]  and it's not going to happen when you see people out there
[02:53:05.720 --> 02:53:08.640]  you know doing all this they're just a low-level golem
[02:53:08.640 --> 02:53:12.000]  they're just the foot soldiers they're just the minions they're the decoys
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.160]  to totally shock us
[02:53:14.160 --> 02:53:17.400]  so the government tries to pass laws that you know pedophilia is legal
[02:53:17.400 --> 02:53:19.640]  you're so sick of it all you just tune out
[02:53:19.640 --> 02:53:22.800]  great job on the show on the fourth hour coming up in the war room

[02:53:39.200 --> 02:53:42.480]  and this is all amazing alex and it
[02:53:42.480 --> 02:53:46.680]  it's impossible for you to get a break away from it but uh... we appreciate you
[02:53:46.680 --> 02:53:49.920]  calling in as all this breaking news is developing here
[02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:53.920]  and so uh... of course the alex jones show back on sundays as well four to six
[02:53:53.920 --> 02:53:56.760]  p.m. central and i will be hosting the war room
[02:53:56.760 --> 02:54:00.000]  uh... once i depart from here it's the veterans call in show so if we have any
[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.360]  veterans that want to call in and discuss some things i opened up the
[02:54:02.360 --> 02:54:04.760]  phone lines for three hours but mike
[02:54:04.760 --> 02:54:07.760]  uh... mike at his natural news dot com i mean
[02:54:07.760 --> 02:54:10.560]  uh... you know it is such a strange thing because a
[02:54:10.560 --> 02:54:15.240]  to me this just shows how look we are honestly tolerant were open-minded we
[02:54:15.240 --> 02:54:18.080]  want to hear all points of view we don't discriminate from people coming on
[02:54:18.080 --> 02:54:19.000]  here
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:22.640]  and we gave this individual a chance to explain their case
[02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:25.880]  obviously you know as more and more stuff comes out this person seems more
[02:54:25.880 --> 02:54:28.080]  and more perhaps deranged
[02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:30.400]  but it's like
[02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:34.040]  we call out the deranged behavior we even give them a platform to try to
[02:54:34.040 --> 02:54:35.280]  explain themselves
[02:54:35.280 --> 02:54:38.520]  nobody else will and then somehow we're still intolerant when we're just trying
[02:54:38.520 --> 02:54:40.680]  to explain this this whole thing but
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:43.960]  to me this individual looks like yes maybe this is somebody that has some
[02:54:43.960 --> 02:54:44.800]  sort of
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:47.280]  uh... maybe a mental disorder i mean
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:50.680]  it's tough to explain when you're behaving so oddly
[02:54:50.680 --> 02:54:52.240]  and you want to promote
[02:54:52.240 --> 02:54:55.160]  uh... pool parties for topless teens
[02:54:55.160 --> 02:54:58.280]  but you're you're you're right i mean the we're watching the attempted
[02:54:58.280 --> 02:55:02.280]  normalization of mass mental illness where if you don't go along with it
[02:55:02.280 --> 02:55:05.680]  that you are called intolerant or you're called filled with hatred but
[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:08.640]  look i want to bring your attention to a a tactic
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:13.720]  being used by this individual according to many many media reports
[02:55:13.720 --> 02:55:16.360]  and it could apply to other people who use the same tactic
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:18.520]  you take a biological man
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:21.480]  first they claim to be a transgender so then they say they're a woman
[02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:24.000]  and then they claim to be a lesbian woman
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:25.600]  which means they wanna
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:28.080]  have sex with young girls
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:32.040]  so now they're a double victim class so number one they're transgender which you
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:33.040]  can't criticize
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:35.760]  and then secondly they're a lesbian transgender
[02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:40.200]  which you can't criticize so then all of a sudden you're supposed to worship
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:43.320]  and embrace and celebrate all the pedophilia like the twelve-year-old
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:46.640]  topless you know pool parties where no parents are allowed
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:47.880]  this is a trick
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:51.160]  see you see one society accepts this idea that there are
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:55.040]  that you can change your gender by waving a magic wand
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:58.200]  then anything goes anybody can claim to be anything
[02:55:58.200 --> 02:56:03.960]  and with each stage of the self-delusion you then have another victimology
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:04.920]  status
[02:56:04.920 --> 02:56:08.040]  that is achieved like badges of victimology
[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:09.280]  you see what i mean on
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:13.000]  how how how this trick is being played about this to my favorite guy
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:16.960]  but what is what is real progressivism because they have this whole
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:19.600]  facade like this is somehow progressive
[02:56:19.600 --> 02:56:21.480]  this is not progressive
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:25.960]  but what is real progressivism real progressivism is building a society
[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:28.440]  you know having having a culture
[02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:30.040]  where society functions
[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:33.280]  like i like to make sports analogies this is like
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:37.280]  if you're a baseball player or you like watching baseball
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:39.560]  and so you're out watching a baseball game
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:43.200]  and there's a guy in center field wearing football uniform in a football
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:45.640]  helmet and he's out there tackling people
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:47.160]  and you're like
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:49.040]  what is going on why is this football player here
[02:56:49.040 --> 02:56:51.400]  and that's a trans athlete now that's a
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:54.240]  where that's a football player in a baseball field if you don't accept that
[02:56:54.240 --> 02:56:55.440]  you'll figure it out
[02:56:55.440 --> 02:56:59.320]  and you're like wait a second this is a baseball game there's rules
[02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:02.400]  it's organized it's like society we have rules in society to keep it
[02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:05.520]  organized and functioning they just want to break it all down they don't want to
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:07.560]  functioning society
[02:57:07.560 --> 02:57:10.800]  well every day you know we publish a lot of science and medicine articles every
[02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:12.240]  day we're publishing articles
[02:57:12.240 --> 02:57:14.360]  research showing that men and women are different
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:17.480]  their brains are different
[02:57:17.480 --> 02:57:18.880]  their biology is different
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:24.200]  they teach this in mainstream college courses but mike adam is a bigot
[02:57:24.200 --> 02:57:25.920]  because he said it
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:27.680]  yeah right exactly
[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:29.840]  if you believe in biology and science
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:31.800]  now you're a bigot that's what you're a bigot
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:34.400]  how dare you believe there in fact
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:39.160]  there is no such thing as reproduction it's a cultural it's a social construct
[02:57:39.160 --> 02:57:42.280]  that reproduction is a social construct all right that does it for me and mike
[02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:45.320]  adam snick baggage takes over
[02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:48.000]  talk to marcus in new york marcus here on the air thanks for holding
[02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.800]  hello yeah i just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a
[02:57:51.800 --> 02:57:55.200]  lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i can tell you is that
[02:57:55.200 --> 02:57:59.080]  almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are trying
[02:57:59.080 --> 02:58:02.920]  desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only
[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:06.760]  way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020
[02:58:06.760 --> 02:58:10.120]  that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's
[02:58:10.120 --> 02:58:12.680]  the only way i think he could be defeated other than assassinating him
[02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:15.720]  it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just
[02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:18.680]  want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the
[02:58:18.680 --> 02:58:22.520]  reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're
[02:58:22.520 --> 02:58:25.640]  80 years old i would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but
[02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:30.520]  if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles
[02:58:30.520 --> 02:58:33.880]  and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to
[02:58:33.880 --> 02:58:36.360]  continue we're going to keep fighting in the info war
[02:58:36.360 --> 02:58:38.920]  and even if something does happen to you or your show
[02:58:38.920 --> 02:58:42.920]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty
[02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:45.880]  thank you sir for calling
[02:58:46.440 --> 02:58:51.960]  as we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history
[02:58:51.960 --> 02:58:57.000]  the globalists are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil
[02:58:57.000 --> 02:59:00.840]  war borders are being broken and sovereignty is being
[02:59:00.840 --> 02:59:06.040]  challenged the world is going to change and how it changes
[02:59:06.040 --> 02:59:09.960]  will likely be decided by those who are prepared to stay strong
[02:59:09.960 --> 02:59:15.480]  when the system fails the system is vulnerable electricity could be gone
[02:59:15.480 --> 02:59:20.280]  in an instant and grocery stores could be empty in three days
[02:59:20.280 --> 02:59:24.120]  having storable foods and the ability to purify water
[02:59:24.120 --> 02:59:27.160]  will give you a fighting chance in the next level
[02:59:27.160 --> 02:59:30.040]  and being without puts you at the mercy of others
[02:59:30.040 --> 02:59:34.760]  or makes you a slave to a dying system buy storable foods
[02:59:34.760 --> 02:59:38.360]  and an alexa pure gravity water filter today
[02:59:38.360 --> 02:59:42.760]  support mankind by being prepared and support freedom
[02:59:42.760 --> 02:59:47.720]  by buying from infowarstore.com
[02:59:47.720 --> 02:59:55.000]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:56.120 --> 03:00:00.280]  what i hate is looking up to seeing
[03:00:00.280 --> 03:00:07.000]  chemtrails in a clear blue sky today
[03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:12.200]  and welcome back to info wars info wars dot com and this is uh nick faggots
[03:00:12.200 --> 03:00:16.680]  standing in in this fourth hour uh you know i i i want to
[03:00:16.680 --> 03:00:20.520]  switch subjects you know we we've been dealing with a lot of news
[03:00:20.520 --> 03:00:24.120]  again this week i mean it's like the endless
[03:00:24.120 --> 03:00:32.040]  chain of events in the clown wars and uh stuff going on with ebbstein and
[03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:36.520]  Mueller all of it but i want to get into a different subject so i'm going to
[03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:42.040]  change the subject today for this uh last hour on a friday afternoon
[03:00:42.040 --> 03:00:48.120]  um i want to talk about rights and uh land and sort of what goes with it
[03:00:48.120 --> 03:00:51.720]  because a lot of people don't get this especially younger listeners and this
[03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:54.840]  again some of that sort of multi-generational
[03:00:54.840 --> 03:00:57.720]  knowledge and past segments have talked about
[03:00:57.720 --> 03:01:02.200]  you know what is the real values national wealth where's it housed and
[03:01:02.200 --> 03:01:05.640]  how does it work and what what is it you know and it's those
[03:01:05.640 --> 03:01:09.240]  things that we hold in common whether it's the airwaves you know the
[03:01:09.240 --> 03:01:12.760]  broadcast waves which used to be held in common
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:16.280]  or the internet you know and that's a whole free speech question right but
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:20.120]  there's a lot of rights that have been confused and lost
[03:01:20.120 --> 03:01:25.400]  in the shuffle over the last decades really and because it's just not common
[03:01:25.400 --> 03:01:29.880]  knowledge people don't think about this stuff but when you think about rights
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:33.880]  and the four factors of economic production which i've talked about before
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:37.240]  and i'm going to just mention them briefly again to bring this into focus
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:40.680]  and those four things of real value are
[03:01:40.680 --> 03:01:47.800]  entrepreneurship as one labor as two natural resources which includes
[03:01:47.800 --> 03:01:51.800]  land which is three and then capital
[03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:55.400]  which is not money but capital equipment things that make other things
[03:01:55.400 --> 03:01:58.440]  from a shovel that you can dig a ditch with to a factory
[03:01:58.440 --> 03:02:02.600]  those are things that are capital and in between all those four factors
[03:02:02.600 --> 03:02:06.440]  is currency cash whatever you use gold coins it doesn't matter
[03:02:06.440 --> 03:02:09.960]  whatever you're using that everybody agrees on between there
[03:02:09.960 --> 03:02:14.360]  and it doesn't matter actually but for this illustration we're just saying
[03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:17.480]  those are the four factors and the one i want to focus on today
[03:02:17.480 --> 03:02:20.360]  is the natural resources and what that really means
[03:02:20.360 --> 03:02:24.600]  and air rights which i kind of touched on you know broadcast rights as being
[03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:28.280]  part of that but also the rights above your land you know you can
[03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:33.400]  sell air rights and in big cities where you're building high rises you know you
[03:02:33.400 --> 03:02:37.640]  might keep the surface estate and you know sell what's above your
[03:02:37.640 --> 03:02:41.640]  house you know if you can finagle it for something to go over your house
[03:02:41.640 --> 03:02:46.120]  so there's a right there there's value there that you can
[03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:49.720]  capture and and sell air rights and it's you know
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:52.920]  for those who can see it on you can see it on the screen
[03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:56.840]  but that's a whole category of rights that we don't even think about
[03:02:56.840 --> 03:03:01.960]  that generally run with your land they go with the surface estate that you buy
[03:03:01.960 --> 03:03:06.120]  when you buy a piece of land but let's talk about that
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:10.520]  surface estate because that varies depending on what you buy and where it
[03:03:10.520 --> 03:03:14.840]  is and how the title reads because when you get into the surface
[03:03:14.840 --> 03:03:19.480]  estate in my part of the world for instance
[03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:24.200]  modern titles don't have in it the mineral rights
[03:03:24.200 --> 03:03:28.840]  as an example and everything pretty much that was
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:35.320]  modern I would say from the 1950s and later at least
[03:03:35.320 --> 03:03:40.760]  west of the Mississippi a lot of those land titles don't have energy rights or
[03:03:40.760 --> 03:03:43.880]  mineral rights they just have the surface estate which is
[03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:48.440]  the use of the surface along with you know reasonable depth for foundations
[03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:52.120]  and water lines and sewers and so on but the minerals
[03:03:52.120 --> 03:03:55.480]  to take them out and sell them you don't have that right
[03:03:55.480 --> 03:04:00.040]  or whether it's metallic minerals like gold and silver and that kind of stuff
[03:04:00.040 --> 03:04:03.720]  or whether it's non-metallic like gravel and sand
[03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:08.840]  you know unless your patents on that land those original titles go back far
[03:04:08.840 --> 03:04:12.760]  enough where those rights ran with the land ran
[03:04:12.760 --> 03:04:16.840]  with the patents and in subsequent deeding of those
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:21.320]  future titles and warranty deeds someone didn't reserve that right to
[03:04:21.320 --> 03:04:24.520]  themselves which often happens when you buy surface
[03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:29.080]  estates and these older properties like in Texas and other areas
[03:04:29.080 --> 03:04:32.360]  people reserve the mineral rights for themselves but we're going to get back
[03:04:32.360 --> 03:04:39.000]  in to the fourth factor of economic production on natural resources when we
[03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.640]  come back and you know we get into this whole
[03:04:41.640 --> 03:04:44.840]  topic because these are things most people don't even think about in the
[03:04:44.840 --> 03:04:47.720]  21st century and they're fundamental to liberty
[03:04:47.720 --> 03:04:52.280]  property rights in the American way they'll be right back
[03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:56.680]  before i started working at info wars i was
[03:04:56.680 --> 03:05:01.160]  not only a fan of alex jones and in force dot com but also the products at
[03:05:01.160 --> 03:05:03.560]  info wars store dot com and there's one product
[03:05:03.560 --> 03:05:06.920]  that's offered at info wars store dot com that is the elite
[03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:10.680]  of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i remember when alex first
[03:05:10.680 --> 03:05:13.480]  started talking about this with some of his special guests
[03:05:13.480 --> 03:05:17.160]  telomeres and telomere support with your dna
[03:05:17.160 --> 03:05:20.520]  so i started to look into the science and what telomeres were
[03:05:20.520 --> 03:05:24.200]  and how it can improve your health and longevity
[03:05:24.200 --> 03:05:28.280]  when you protect your telomere so i started looking into dna force plus but
[03:05:28.280 --> 03:05:32.200]  it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement
[03:05:32.200 --> 03:05:35.720]  and then i started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive
[03:05:35.720 --> 03:05:40.440]  supplements for telomere support and they came and they went but dna force
[03:05:40.440 --> 03:05:44.120]  plus is still there it is the elite supplement
[03:05:44.120 --> 03:05:48.200]  i get excited when dna force plus is on sale because i know it's expensive so
[03:05:48.200 --> 03:05:52.280]  you should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus
[03:05:52.280 --> 03:06:04.120]  at info wars store dot com
[03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:09.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show with
[03:06:09.800 --> 03:06:13.000]  nick baggage
[03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:19.240]  and welcome back this Friday afternoon and you know i want to talk about
[03:06:19.240 --> 03:06:23.800]  where i left off and and i'm talking about this
[03:06:23.800 --> 03:06:28.280]  four factors of economic production the natural resource segment of that
[03:06:28.280 --> 03:06:32.120]  and and why because it has to do with most of us thinking about
[03:06:32.120 --> 03:06:37.880]  where does wealth begin you know land think about land and what it represents
[03:06:37.880 --> 03:06:41.800]  and when you know that was a you know when we think about the 13 colonies even
[03:06:41.800 --> 03:06:45.880]  the very beginning of land rights you know people coming over here and that was
[03:06:45.880 --> 03:06:49.560]  you know the king owned the land and had given it to
[03:06:49.560 --> 03:06:53.160]  people and they had parceled it out and people were buying some titles and
[03:06:53.160 --> 03:06:56.200]  getting titles but what they called original
[03:06:56.200 --> 03:07:00.120]  titles although there's aboriginal title too which is a discussion for another
[03:07:00.120 --> 03:07:03.400]  day but you know it's all about land rights you
[03:07:03.400 --> 03:07:07.480]  know an aboriginal title was a big thing you know and throughout the country
[03:07:07.480 --> 03:07:12.920]  because in alaska my region actually i got to see it in my life my dad settled
[03:07:12.920 --> 03:07:16.600]  the aboriginal titles issue at least part of it
[03:07:16.600 --> 03:07:21.160]  here um in alaska but surface estates became
[03:07:21.160 --> 03:07:25.560]  sort of complex and it was recognized when things under the land became
[03:07:25.560 --> 03:07:29.880]  highly valued like the minerals and the oil and gas because oil and gas wasn't
[03:07:29.880 --> 03:07:32.600]  anything in 250 years ago but it was certain
[03:07:32.600 --> 03:07:36.280]  something a hundred years ago so what started happening
[03:07:36.280 --> 03:07:40.760]  is you see the same globalist sort of hijacked
[03:07:40.760 --> 03:07:44.840]  from the king giving these major deeds of land
[03:07:44.840 --> 03:07:48.440]  across what they called the colonies and eventually you know we said hey those
[03:07:48.440 --> 03:07:52.600]  deeds aren't any good those titles aren't any good we all have a revolution and
[03:07:52.600 --> 03:07:55.000]  get rid of those titles and start something different
[03:07:55.000 --> 03:08:01.080]  and we had homesteading which allowed you to go and stake 160 acres and claim
[03:08:01.080 --> 03:08:05.400]  that boundary and improve upon it in some
[03:08:05.400 --> 03:08:10.280]  manner build a house and agriculture and so on and then you got
[03:08:10.280 --> 03:08:14.680]  a warranty deed a title eventually a patent from the government
[03:08:14.680 --> 03:08:19.000]  for that original land and and with it in the
[03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:22.920]  in the old days were all the rights the water rights the riparian rights
[03:08:22.920 --> 03:08:26.360]  the water flowing through the land was yours and you could dam it and use the
[03:08:26.360 --> 03:08:30.040]  energy and hijack the water for your agriculture you
[03:08:30.040 --> 03:08:34.360]  know do whatever you needed to because those rights ran with the land
[03:08:34.360 --> 03:08:37.320]  you know it was part of your deal you know and so you did you see that on the
[03:08:37.320 --> 03:08:40.760]  eastern united states predominantly with riparian
[03:08:40.760 --> 03:08:43.560]  rights are intact whereas in the west they're not
[03:08:43.560 --> 03:08:47.960]  so again surface estates are pretty complicated and we get back into the
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:54.760]  fundamentals of surface estate and then underneath it
[03:08:54.760 --> 03:09:00.040]  you have the mineral rights which most people again don't think too much about
[03:09:00.040 --> 03:09:04.520]  but if you have those mineral rights these are valuable rights and if you
[03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:07.640]  have mineral patents they give you the mineral
[03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:11.560]  right and if they're old enough the metallic and non-metallic in
[03:09:11.560 --> 03:09:14.440]  other words all the mineral rights and the surface
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:19.560]  estate and the water rights and the timber rights
[03:09:19.560 --> 03:09:23.720]  and the air rights essentially all the rights
[03:09:23.720 --> 03:09:26.920]  and and fundamental uses of the land under mineral
[03:09:26.920 --> 03:09:31.880]  patents under surface estate patents not necessarily
[03:09:31.880 --> 03:09:34.920]  so so you have to look carefully if they're old enough they carry those
[03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:37.320]  rights if they haven't been otherwise reserved
[03:09:37.320 --> 03:09:42.040]  or split titles which often happens I mean most people don't think about this
[03:09:42.040 --> 03:09:46.200]  people in Texas know about this because there's private ownership of oil and
[03:09:46.200 --> 03:09:49.480]  gas rights Pennsylvania too and other parts of these
[03:09:49.480 --> 03:09:53.160]  and so these underlying rights all the sudden
[03:09:53.160 --> 03:09:58.120]  have value when you discover oil and gas or other valuable minerals and you own
[03:09:58.120 --> 03:10:02.520]  all those rights but for the most part the west that's not the case
[03:10:02.520 --> 03:10:11.720]  but we have a lot of other rights when you think about it and here's
[03:10:11.720 --> 03:10:14.200]  some things at BLM and you hear this in the news
[03:10:14.200 --> 03:10:17.960]  every once while you hear people fighting over grazing rights
[03:10:17.960 --> 03:10:21.960]  which is where public lands and private lands both
[03:10:21.960 --> 03:10:28.600]  were leased or granted for reasonable use grazing rights the right to graze
[03:10:28.600 --> 03:10:32.200]  those public lands in a responsible way and
[03:10:32.200 --> 03:10:38.040]  essentially you're farming public lands but it was practical made sense
[03:10:38.040 --> 03:10:41.880]  why should you own the land underneath when you really just need the grazing
[03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:45.720]  right if you can manage that and the same is true with agricultural
[03:10:45.720 --> 03:10:49.400]  rights often people split that title and they allow people to lease their
[03:10:49.400 --> 03:10:54.120]  agricultural land and they may keep their house or something of this nature
[03:10:54.120 --> 03:10:59.320]  and people understand these kind of rights that run with the land but water
[03:10:59.320 --> 03:11:03.320]  rights are pretty special you know in a lot of jurisdictions
[03:11:03.320 --> 03:11:08.600]  you go to the state and get a permit you know or when they cross
[03:11:08.600 --> 03:11:12.200]  state boundaries there's maybe federal jurisdiction in terms of
[03:11:12.200 --> 03:11:15.960]  what goes on with water and what a lot of people don't know about water where it
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:20.520]  comes through your land in the west you need a core of engineers permit if
[03:11:20.520 --> 03:11:23.640]  you're going to take something out or put something in
[03:11:23.640 --> 03:11:27.400]  a lot of people don't know that so you can't you can span it above the high
[03:11:27.400 --> 03:11:32.840]  water mark you can span it not require the core of engineer permit but
[03:11:32.840 --> 03:11:35.240]  you know you think about it you don't really own
[03:11:35.240 --> 03:11:38.360]  what's going on in that waterway when it runs through your land
[03:11:38.360 --> 03:11:43.000]  or if it's wet the same is true and environmental protection agency this
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:47.080]  is interesting you know the Clean Water Act which gives them jurisdiction of
[03:11:47.080 --> 03:11:51.720]  any of drains into the ocean or into navigable waters which
[03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:56.840]  have some value to you know everyone but what they
[03:11:56.840 --> 03:12:00.840]  dump eventually into federal waters and they eventually all do because that's
[03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:03.960]  how it goes so it gives your 60 dpa over any
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:10.440]  discharge into a stream so there's that and but again it's
[03:12:10.440 --> 03:12:13.480]  water rights you know what's going on with water you
[03:12:13.480 --> 03:12:17.480]  you don't really control it's regulated by a number of agencies there are a
[03:12:17.480 --> 03:12:21.480]  couple of them and then navigable and non navigable
[03:12:21.480 --> 03:12:26.520]  waterways you know in the case of navigable waterways you know those
[03:12:26.520 --> 03:12:30.920]  can't be restricted jurisdictions in the west and in my part of the world in
[03:12:30.920 --> 03:12:34.520]  Alaska particularly where you're allowed to transit that the
[03:12:34.520 --> 03:12:38.200]  water column the column of water not the land under it
[03:12:38.200 --> 03:12:42.840]  or around it but the column of water if it's navigable
[03:12:42.840 --> 03:12:49.400]  is is public access because that was a way that people gained access to land
[03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:53.640]  historically and that's why that right of access and water columns
[03:12:53.640 --> 03:12:57.880]  remains so it's a restricted right and an open right you know if you think about
[03:12:57.880 --> 03:13:00.840]  if you got a river running through your land there's some things you can't do
[03:13:00.840 --> 03:13:05.160]  it's navigable water that you could do if it wasn't for instance
[03:13:05.160 --> 03:13:10.600]  so these are things that most people don't really think too much about you
[03:13:10.600 --> 03:13:14.760]  know in terms of land titles and why they're fundamentally important is
[03:13:14.760 --> 03:13:20.280]  this is the base of wealth that you think about so the further you go
[03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:23.960]  west in the which is the later in history you got
[03:13:23.960 --> 03:13:29.320]  the globalist figured out that you want to reserve some rights to government
[03:13:29.320 --> 03:13:32.280]  because it's easier to corrupt the government than it is a whole bunch of
[03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:36.600]  individual people so if you really want to think
[03:13:36.600 --> 03:13:40.600]  about it in a broader bigger picture it's about
[03:13:40.600 --> 03:13:44.520]  retaining rights to government for some public purpose
[03:13:44.520 --> 03:13:47.640]  theoretically but in the end so much of those public
[03:13:47.640 --> 03:13:51.640]  purposes get hijacked private profit which is fine too
[03:13:51.640 --> 03:13:55.720]  in terms of how it should work when it's in a balanced way but it's not balanced
[03:13:55.720 --> 03:13:58.120]  anymore let me give you a couple examples
[03:13:58.120 --> 03:14:02.760]  homesteading up until the 1960s which is not very long ago
[03:14:02.760 --> 03:14:06.440]  I remember as a little kid it was still going on
[03:14:06.440 --> 03:14:11.320]  in the 1960s in Alaska you could still homestead 160 acres if you were 18 years
[03:14:11.320 --> 03:14:15.880]  old and an American and went and homesteaded and
[03:14:15.880 --> 03:14:19.640]  surveyed it within so many years and lived on it within so many years out
[03:14:19.640 --> 03:14:23.080]  of seven then you owned it and I think it was
[03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:25.320]  seven years you had to live on it seven years
[03:14:25.320 --> 03:14:29.080]  and then and then it was reduced to five acre home
[03:14:29.080 --> 03:14:33.640]  sites and commercial sites and trading posts which were
[03:14:33.640 --> 03:14:38.040]  five acre parcels and ten acre parcels that you could claim
[03:14:38.040 --> 03:14:41.960]  you could go out on BLM land federal land that was inappropriate or
[03:14:41.960 --> 03:14:45.080]  undesignated which was most of Alaska at that time
[03:14:45.080 --> 03:14:49.480]  and you could just lay in your four stakes and then survey it later and
[03:14:49.480 --> 03:14:53.400]  reside on it for that period of time
[03:14:53.400 --> 03:14:59.800]  five to seven years and you owned it it was yours you know and
[03:14:59.800 --> 03:15:02.920]  and you had to pay the patent cost it was a dollar and a quarter an acre
[03:15:02.920 --> 03:15:06.920]  it was pretty inexpensive you know when you think about it
[03:15:06.920 --> 03:15:11.960]  and patenting was like the way the recourse into the land and these were
[03:15:11.960 --> 03:15:13.960]  private things that you and I could do on
[03:15:13.960 --> 03:15:17.640]  unappropriated public land and and it was the way the federal
[03:15:17.640 --> 03:15:20.760]  government stayed out of the business of owning everything
[03:15:20.760 --> 03:15:24.840]  because on the east you'll note that there's not much reserve for
[03:15:24.840 --> 03:15:29.160]  public land libraries some parks and preserves but not the massive
[03:15:29.160 --> 03:15:34.280]  taking most land is private in the east in the west most of its public lands
[03:15:34.280 --> 03:15:37.720]  and that's the question of why is it public lands and what are the rights
[03:15:37.720 --> 03:15:40.200]  that are being reserved and what happens in the future
[03:15:40.200 --> 03:15:44.600]  and who owns those rights because those are our rights and it's our wallet
[03:15:44.600 --> 03:15:53.160]  so stay tuned we'll be right back with you brief message

[03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:11.880]  i didn't invent all this i went and researched the renaissance
[03:18:11.880 --> 03:18:15.800]  americana and what really works for humanity and i'm simply trying to bring
[03:18:15.800 --> 03:18:18.920]  it back and lo and behold it's super popular like it's
[03:18:18.920 --> 03:18:21.720]  always been that's why the globalists are trying
[03:18:21.720 --> 03:18:25.480]  to shut it down so desperately because we have the light
[03:18:25.480 --> 03:18:29.800]  in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine so whatever you do
[03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:33.240]  continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products at

[03:18:43.720 --> 03:18:46.760]  family i want to thank all of you for what you've done
[03:18:46.760 --> 03:18:51.320]  because without you info wars is nothing you are the info war
[03:18:51.320 --> 03:18:56.920]  and i salute you i talk about this on the air and i know
[03:18:56.920 --> 03:19:00.280]  it stinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our
[03:19:00.280 --> 03:19:03.560]  supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship
[03:19:03.560 --> 03:19:06.840]  and attacks and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the
[03:19:06.840 --> 03:19:09.880]  products are and how they were the best and why they were and i'd have doctors
[03:19:09.880 --> 03:19:13.000]  on and experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last few years
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:16.120]  i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest
[03:19:16.120 --> 03:19:18.440]  thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and
[03:19:18.440 --> 03:19:21.320]  how wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere
[03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:26.120]  jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under
[03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:29.720]  federal law since 1996 you can't say that a
[03:19:29.720 --> 03:19:32.760]  supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and
[03:19:32.760 --> 03:19:36.120]  won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them
[03:19:36.120 --> 03:19:39.400]  and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and
[03:19:39.400 --> 03:19:42.520]  manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have
[03:19:42.520 --> 03:19:46.040]  side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing
[03:19:46.040 --> 03:19:49.720]  about god's medicine chest infowarstore.com or
[03:19:49.720 --> 03:19:57.080]  triple eight two five three three one three nine
[03:19:57.080 --> 03:20:05.640]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:20:05.640 --> 03:20:18.440]  the alex jones show because there is a war on
[03:20:18.440 --> 03:20:24.440]  for your mind with nick baggage
[03:20:24.440 --> 03:20:29.240]  so land rights and what's the real agenda you know and what is all this
[03:20:29.240 --> 03:20:33.000]  really mean yeah is where we kind of left off in the last segment i was
[03:20:33.000 --> 03:20:37.160]  talking about the the sort of taking of those
[03:20:37.160 --> 03:20:40.280]  rights and i want to elaborate on that theme a bit
[03:20:40.280 --> 03:20:43.880]  um but i want to finish up with the um
[03:20:43.880 --> 03:20:47.080]  water rights because here's things attached to water rights
[03:20:47.080 --> 03:20:51.000]  that's your water column um if your titles are old enough you might own
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:54.840]  your water column uh your your your land under it if your
[03:20:54.840 --> 03:20:58.680]  titles are old enough of course you own that uh the navigate the navigational
[03:20:58.680 --> 03:21:02.200]  aspect is irrelevant if you own it um but being able to
[03:21:02.200 --> 03:21:07.080]  damn it and use the energy off of it or use the water for agricultural uses
[03:21:07.080 --> 03:21:10.120]  these are riparian rights things that you can do when you own
[03:21:10.120 --> 03:21:13.960]  all the rights that ran with the land and the energy aspect
[03:21:13.960 --> 03:21:18.040]  even going back to colonial times where mills you know
[03:21:18.040 --> 03:21:21.720]  that ground uh weed and later were mechanized to
[03:21:21.720 --> 03:21:25.960]  run cotton gins and so on using the mechanical force of
[03:21:25.960 --> 03:21:30.440]  uh water and those techniques are forgotten you know look up old books
[03:21:30.440 --> 03:21:37.400]  on uh water uh uh rights but more importantly look up hydroelectric
[03:21:37.400 --> 03:21:40.920]  today what you can get out of it and you need very little
[03:21:40.920 --> 03:21:44.600]  motion to get a lot of energy and when water just ran through your land
[03:21:44.600 --> 03:21:47.880]  extracting a little energy out of it it was kind of
[03:21:47.880 --> 03:21:52.520]  normal you know they used paddle wheels very simple devices you could buy them
[03:21:52.520 --> 03:21:56.520]  at the hardware store a hundred years ago and they fit in your stream they
[03:21:56.520 --> 03:21:59.640]  generate a certain amount of electricity you plug it direct
[03:21:59.640 --> 03:22:03.400]  in or you use inverters and convert it to ac you know but the
[03:22:03.400 --> 03:22:08.360]  point matter is this is still knowledge available if you
[03:22:08.360 --> 03:22:12.680]  know what runs with your land in terms of your rights and what you might have on
[03:22:12.680 --> 03:22:16.440]  it you've got a lot of potential in land most people don't even think about it
[03:22:16.440 --> 03:22:20.360]  and it's fundamental you know on the image is a uh is a dam
[03:22:20.360 --> 03:22:24.200]  where the water is being used and the head pressure is being used and to
[03:22:24.200 --> 03:22:27.720]  create a a mill uh for saw mill for goodness sake
[03:22:27.720 --> 03:22:31.560]  that's what they were all about right was turn the water turn the blade you know
[03:22:31.560 --> 03:22:35.320]  and reducing gears to get it there you know these are important things
[03:22:35.320 --> 03:22:39.320]  so but today you need permits you put something in the water out of the water
[03:22:39.320 --> 03:22:43.960]  you know there's four of engineers involved in the EPA and everybody else
[03:22:43.960 --> 03:22:48.040]  so it's a different ball game in the 21st century how it all works but you
[03:22:48.040 --> 03:22:51.320]  know there's weight there's work around you know on water rights for instance if
[03:22:51.320 --> 03:22:55.960]  you just lay a hose in your water and lay it in as long as you don't have
[03:22:55.960 --> 03:23:00.040]  anything attached to the uh below the high water mark
[03:23:00.040 --> 03:23:03.960]  cable it up above the high water mark and drop it in and then you bring your
[03:23:03.960 --> 03:23:08.600]  line somewhere downstream out of the stream above the high water mark and
[03:23:08.600 --> 03:23:11.320]  you can take power out of it that way and that's legal
[03:23:11.320 --> 03:23:17.560]  without all the permitting but the point is um to get energy what a great
[03:23:17.560 --> 03:23:22.120]  deal you know out of uh just flow of water and and the use of essentially the
[03:23:22.120 --> 03:23:26.200]  differential in height gravity and water flow to
[03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:29.480]  to get what you need and you know when you think about
[03:23:29.480 --> 03:23:34.200]  again the regulation of the basic rights to the various agencies was sort of
[03:23:34.200 --> 03:23:37.800]  part of it and then the reserving of rights um
[03:23:37.800 --> 03:23:41.320]  the government was the other part of it and then the theory on that was these
[03:23:41.320 --> 03:23:44.200]  rights would be somehow available or the wealth would be
[03:23:44.200 --> 03:23:49.000]  shared by the nation which is not uh the case in most cases um it's
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:52.520]  marginalized pretty much but let's look at
[03:23:52.520 --> 03:23:55.880]  some of the rights I was talking to Connor off here and I'm going to be
[03:23:55.880 --> 03:23:59.400]  headed out to my property in the in the bush that I have with
[03:23:59.400 --> 03:24:03.720]  partners and it's 812 acres of a mineral estate that has
[03:24:03.720 --> 03:24:07.240]  all the rights that run with the land and my original patents were
[03:24:07.240 --> 03:24:11.880]  granted by Roosevelt first one Teddy Roosevelt in the early 1900s
[03:24:11.880 --> 03:24:16.520]  so I have the water rights the mineral rights uh the non metallic mineral rights
[03:24:16.520 --> 03:24:19.160]  surface state timber rights air rights everything
[03:24:19.160 --> 03:24:22.920]  you know the whole package that runs with the land and and it still has
[03:24:22.920 --> 03:24:26.520]  subject to you know modern-day regulation of course but the
[03:24:26.520 --> 03:24:30.200]  point of the matter is I I can still extract the minerals I can still
[03:24:30.200 --> 03:24:34.520]  utilize the water and I can still utilize the land
[03:24:34.520 --> 03:24:38.360]  um in a way that is productive and that's why
[03:24:38.360 --> 03:24:42.040]  mineral patents and homesteads which I was talking about in the last segment
[03:24:42.040 --> 03:24:45.800]  were originally granted it was a way to move land and do the hands of the
[03:24:45.800 --> 03:24:49.480]  public for those willing to put in the prudent man
[03:24:49.480 --> 03:24:53.400]  test which was are you willing to spend your life's blood and your money
[03:24:53.400 --> 03:24:58.040]  to go do something and get it done and if you are then you get to have it
[03:24:58.040 --> 03:25:01.960]  you know and in the old days it was like an axe and a grub steak and you went
[03:25:01.960 --> 03:25:05.240]  out and you were able to homestead so you
[03:25:05.240 --> 03:25:09.880]  staked your 160 acres you know and you chopped down the
[03:25:09.880 --> 03:25:13.800]  trees and made a cabin and you knew how to do all this average man knew how to
[03:25:13.800 --> 03:25:16.440]  do this or you got a book and you figured it
[03:25:16.440 --> 03:25:20.840]  out a lot of people fail that it do miserably uh that came over here with a
[03:25:20.840 --> 03:25:24.520]  dream and not a a reality check on how a back
[03:25:24.520 --> 03:25:29.400]  breaking miserable that was chiseling something out of the wilderness
[03:25:29.400 --> 03:25:33.880]  but the fact is um you had the opportunity
[03:25:33.880 --> 03:25:37.880]  to do it no matter who you were and this was the wonderful part of
[03:25:37.880 --> 03:25:41.960]  what's what was possible in the United States you know so
[03:25:41.960 --> 03:25:47.720]  homesteading was made out outlawed home sites and as I was talking before the
[03:25:47.720 --> 03:25:51.240]  break home sites were these five acre tracks
[03:25:51.240 --> 03:25:55.080]  and then trading post sites or commercial sites for these five acre
[03:25:55.080 --> 03:26:00.200]  tracks that you could still claim on BLM land which was a lot of land in the
[03:26:00.200 --> 03:26:02.280]  west there were still quite a bit of it that was
[03:26:02.280 --> 03:26:07.880]  unappropriate and undesignated and so the fact that they ended that in the
[03:26:07.880 --> 03:26:12.200]  1970s they quit appropriating money and then eventually
[03:26:12.200 --> 03:26:17.320]  regulated it out now you can't do it you just can't do it it's just all
[03:26:17.320 --> 03:26:21.000]  public land now and the the sad story if you look
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:25.720]  under the constitution of the United States it says that the only thing the
[03:26:25.720 --> 03:26:27.880]  federal government is supposed to reserve is
[03:26:27.880 --> 03:26:32.760]  post offices military establishments land for those purposes
[03:26:32.760 --> 03:26:35.720]  and some other you know rational public purposes
[03:26:35.720 --> 03:26:39.000]  transit quarters and so on that we all understand
[03:26:39.000 --> 03:26:43.000]  but to keep the bulk of the land the majority like in Alaska
[03:26:43.000 --> 03:26:47.400]  see Alaska only 1% now first let me put in perspective this is 20%
[03:26:47.400 --> 03:26:53.480]  or actually 18% of the whole nation about about a fifth of the nation
[03:26:53.480 --> 03:26:59.240]  of that only 1% is in private hands in Alaska
[03:26:59.240 --> 03:27:03.080]  because homesteading and all that got shut down way too early
[03:27:03.080 --> 03:27:06.520]  to open the state up to the possibilities of what was here the
[03:27:06.520 --> 03:27:10.840]  state made a couple attempts didn't work because wherever they made homesteading
[03:27:10.840 --> 03:27:14.520]  legally had to build infrastructure schools roads bridges so on
[03:27:14.520 --> 03:27:19.000]  and really what need to be open is where people are not where you
[03:27:19.000 --> 03:27:23.560]  some weird planner thought well let's just give up this this marginal anyway
[03:27:23.560 --> 03:27:28.200]  no you know you you release land where it is so you can develop
[03:27:28.200 --> 03:27:32.440]  footprint rational and then you open up the mineral areas
[03:27:32.440 --> 03:27:35.800]  and the oil and gas areas and the potentials and I want to talk about
[03:27:35.800 --> 03:27:39.880]  mineral rights in the next section because we still have that impact
[03:27:39.880 --> 03:27:44.760]  there's still aspects of that that we still as average Americans 18 years
[03:27:44.760 --> 03:27:49.080]  old and a citizen have certain rights that a lot of people
[03:27:49.080 --> 03:27:52.760]  understand and I want to talk about that in the context of the
[03:27:52.760 --> 03:27:56.760]  21st century because possibilities still exist
[03:27:56.760 --> 03:28:04.200]  for those willing to risk it and and take challenges of what that might be
[03:28:04.200 --> 03:28:08.520]  and and those challenges are being looked at you know Alaska a lot of it
[03:28:08.520 --> 03:28:13.320]  people have never in the modern era walked on and even in the last 10,000
[03:28:13.320 --> 03:28:19.080]  years because a lot of it over 40 of the glaciers have receded and in that
[03:28:19.080 --> 03:28:24.280]  in receding have uncovered lands that were haven't been seen in
[03:28:24.280 --> 03:28:28.920]  12,000 years or 50,000 years

[03:33:22.920 --> 03:33:27.160]  and welcome back again on this friday afternoon and right before the break i
[03:33:27.160 --> 03:33:32.360]  was uh talking about again the basic uh four
[03:33:32.360 --> 03:33:37.400]  factors of economic production when i'm focusing in on today's natural resources
[03:33:37.400 --> 03:33:41.320]  in in the context of my own life you know i mean in alaska
[03:33:41.320 --> 03:33:45.160]  and why alaska is important and i bring it up often
[03:33:45.160 --> 03:33:49.800]  not just because i live here but because this is the treasury ladies and
[03:33:49.800 --> 03:33:52.840]  gentlemen and i'll tell you why and i started to explain this
[03:33:52.840 --> 03:33:56.200]  private land in alaska the land that you and i
[03:33:56.200 --> 03:34:01.800]  own private parties own and court even corporations own for that matter
[03:34:01.800 --> 03:34:06.360]  is one percent of the entire state of alaska that's it
[03:34:06.360 --> 03:34:09.880]  nine percent is indigenous controlled to
[03:34:09.880 --> 03:34:13.320]  native corporations and village corporations are quite different than
[03:34:13.320 --> 03:34:17.400]  what we normally think about it's a hybrid corporate structure
[03:34:17.400 --> 03:34:21.160]  that dealt with native land indigenous settlements and then the
[03:34:21.160 --> 03:34:26.520]  20 percent is owned by the state of alaska it's really ought to be
[03:34:26.520 --> 03:34:31.960]  most of the rest but 70 percent is owned by the federal government
[03:34:31.960 --> 03:34:35.640]  and when you take that into consideration and those who have a map
[03:34:35.640 --> 03:34:39.320]  and look at this you know there's like nothing
[03:34:39.320 --> 03:34:42.760]  that's really privately held now the state has
[03:34:42.760 --> 03:34:46.920]  divested itself in recent days and some boroughs which are equivalent
[03:34:46.920 --> 03:34:50.840]  counties here have done the same and they sell some land from time to time
[03:34:50.840 --> 03:34:53.800]  even some of the native corps have done that but not much
[03:34:53.800 --> 03:34:56.920]  and i don't think they should i think they should keep their land base if
[03:34:56.920 --> 03:35:00.520]  anything we should be expanding the private land base
[03:35:00.520 --> 03:35:04.120]  which i was talking about during the just before the
[03:35:04.120 --> 03:35:08.760]  break and i talked about homesteading ending in the 60s home sites and
[03:35:08.760 --> 03:35:11.640]  trading posts and commercial sites ending in the
[03:35:11.640 --> 03:35:17.080]  1970s but what didn't end is mineral rights the
[03:35:17.080 --> 03:35:21.080]  right to stake and claim unappropriated mineral
[03:35:21.080 --> 03:35:26.520]  rights on federal lands plm lands throughout the united
[03:35:26.520 --> 03:35:29.880]  states and you have to look for the specific jurisdictions
[03:35:29.880 --> 03:35:34.760]  but you're not able to grab usually the oil and gas rights which you can get
[03:35:34.760 --> 03:35:39.720]  are the rocks gravel and the minerals metallic
[03:35:39.720 --> 03:35:45.080]  minerals depending on where those public lands lie so
[03:35:45.080 --> 03:35:49.160]  claiming those rights you can do now but here's the deal
[03:35:49.160 --> 03:35:52.760]  now this is where they catch 22 and those listening in the trump
[03:35:52.760 --> 03:35:56.360]  administration and and in the republican party
[03:35:56.360 --> 03:36:01.880]  and democrats that believe in progress need to re-examine this because the
[03:36:01.880 --> 03:36:06.040]  right patent mineral properties still exist today
[03:36:06.040 --> 03:36:09.880]  where if you go out as a private citizen and stake and locate
[03:36:09.880 --> 03:36:13.560]  a valuable claim you can have what's called an unpatented mining claim
[03:36:13.560 --> 03:36:17.160]  immediately and you can permit it for development
[03:36:17.160 --> 03:36:20.760]  and work but you'll never get it financed unless you have a surface to
[03:36:20.760 --> 03:36:23.960]  state so you got to do that generally out of
[03:36:23.960 --> 03:36:27.720]  cash or risk capital certainly for the state of
[03:36:27.720 --> 03:36:30.360]  alaskia you never own the surface to state either
[03:36:30.360 --> 03:36:35.800]  you get a mineral lease which on state land you can then extract you have a
[03:36:35.800 --> 03:36:38.040]  royalty arrangement with the state and the tax
[03:36:38.040 --> 03:36:42.360]  base for the state and so on but on the federal land
[03:36:42.360 --> 03:36:47.000]  you get that right as an as a unpatented mining claim and you can begin to
[03:36:47.000 --> 03:36:49.560]  develop it in fact you have to do a certain amount of
[03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:52.440]  developmental work every year to keep it
[03:36:52.440 --> 03:36:55.880]  a hundred bucks a year or 200 bucks a year a very minimal amount
[03:36:55.880 --> 03:37:00.840]  on federal land and on state land pretty minimal too
[03:37:00.840 --> 03:37:06.600]  in most cases and what you can do though is under the theory is that as you
[03:37:06.600 --> 03:37:10.360]  discover something that's commercially viable and it's worthy
[03:37:10.360 --> 03:37:14.040]  of substantial investment you used to be able to go to patent
[03:37:14.040 --> 03:37:17.080]  and the law still allows you to go to patent
[03:37:17.080 --> 03:37:21.000]  but it hasn't been funded in a couple of decades
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:27.080]  in other words the law is on the books it says yes of course go out and discover
[03:37:27.080 --> 03:37:33.000]  something and then claim it and but we won't give you a patent because
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:36.120]  there's not a nickel in the federal budget
[03:37:36.120 --> 03:37:44.280]  to effectuate the law to compel the law to grant the patent
[03:37:44.280 --> 03:37:48.440]  now i know that patent fees haven't been revised in
[03:37:48.440 --> 03:37:52.200]  a century so we ought to take a look at this
[03:37:52.200 --> 03:37:56.280]  because these are after all public lands and we ought to get
[03:37:56.280 --> 03:38:06.440]  you know 20,019 value instead of 1880s value which is what you're dealing
[03:38:06.440 --> 03:38:09.800]  with here because a lot of the mining laws go back
[03:38:09.800 --> 03:38:13.400]  to the 1800s and those laws are the ones still on the books with minor
[03:38:13.400 --> 03:38:18.040]  amendment when the income tax came in and i've mentioned this in the past
[03:38:18.040 --> 03:38:22.920]  they created for the mineral owners which were by then oil and gas industry
[03:38:22.920 --> 03:38:26.280]  and mineral estate owners who had gotten public lands
[03:38:26.280 --> 03:38:30.440]  unappropriated public lands by making discovery and making patents
[03:38:30.440 --> 03:38:34.520]  or those original owners that sold to big corporations and globalists or others
[03:38:34.520 --> 03:38:37.800]  you know the Guggenheims and the Morgans and the others that owned all this
[03:38:37.800 --> 03:38:41.640]  stuff especially in my part of the world and then they
[03:38:41.640 --> 03:38:44.920]  developed those resources and exported that money and did all the
[03:38:44.920 --> 03:38:49.400]  stuff they did with the wealth of the nation ladies and gentlemen which
[03:38:49.400 --> 03:38:55.320]  was free and open to us now it's not so what happens is in a national
[03:38:55.320 --> 03:38:59.320]  emergency let me give you the scheme and i'll ask what they did and this is a
[03:38:59.320 --> 03:39:02.280]  longer story that maybe we'll get into today but under the
[03:39:02.280 --> 03:39:06.200]  native land claim settlement act there was a section this is passed for my dad
[03:39:06.200 --> 03:39:09.480]  in the early 70s in the congress and it was
[03:39:09.480 --> 03:39:13.240]  in that was a section called section d2 that my dad unfortunately
[03:39:13.240 --> 03:39:17.000]  was lost on a plane conveniently i should say because
[03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:22.680]  how that got implemented after his disappearance was exactly the wrong way
[03:39:22.680 --> 03:39:27.400]  but in any case what ended up happening is d2 then they defined it later
[03:39:27.400 --> 03:39:31.240]  in 1980 under peace legislation in the Carter administration
[03:39:31.240 --> 03:39:38.680]  that reserved 104 million acres let me say that again 104 million acres
[03:39:38.680 --> 03:39:44.760]  and it was supposed to be the final and last taking hijacking of the mineral
[03:39:44.760 --> 03:39:50.200]  right from Alaska into federal federal hands that could never be developed
[03:39:50.200 --> 03:39:54.280]  except under one condition i'll get to that in a moment
[03:39:54.280 --> 03:39:58.280]  but think about this what was once held in the public estate
[03:39:58.280 --> 03:40:04.200]  all of a sudden got reserved and when we settled our statehood act in 1959 you
[03:40:04.200 --> 03:40:07.880]  know when it passed that's just and i was a territorial citizen i was born when
[03:40:07.880 --> 03:40:12.440]  it was still a territory here but i can tell you what
[03:40:12.440 --> 03:40:20.120]  what happened in all of this is it was supposed to be the final
[03:40:20.120 --> 03:40:24.040]  taking and what was supposed to happen under our statehood act is all oil and
[03:40:24.040 --> 03:40:28.360]  gas and mineral wealth under state land and under all
[03:40:28.360 --> 03:40:32.200]  excuse me under all federal land would go to the state in other words all
[03:40:32.200 --> 03:40:35.560]  rents royalties whatever the federal government made on
[03:40:35.560 --> 03:40:38.600]  federal land in this state went to the state
[03:40:38.600 --> 03:40:42.280]  because under state rights in the sovereignty
[03:40:42.280 --> 03:40:46.200]  theory of states most of that land should transfer to the state
[03:40:46.200 --> 03:40:50.680]  but we decided in the interest of the nation for a lot of reasons and in the
[03:40:50.680 --> 03:40:53.480]  interest of the state under our statehood act
[03:40:53.480 --> 03:40:57.080]  that we would keep 90 percent of the rents and royalties on the land let the
[03:40:57.080 --> 03:40:59.800]  federal government have control of the surf state which we thought was a good
[03:40:59.800 --> 03:41:04.440]  idea until later they decided to lock up 104 million
[03:41:04.440 --> 03:41:08.440]  acres that would never be developed unless
[03:41:08.440 --> 03:41:12.040]  there was a national emergency but here's the story
[03:41:12.040 --> 03:41:15.880]  in these parks and preserves i was a last hard rock minor in an
[03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:21.640]  in an area called cantisna alaska just north of mount mckinley in the
[03:41:21.640 --> 03:41:25.480]  in in the central part of our state mountain alley
[03:41:25.480 --> 03:41:31.080]  today and the cantisna mining district was and is one of the golden
[03:41:31.080 --> 03:41:35.640]  jewels of the world in terms of its minerals and when i was there on the
[03:41:35.640 --> 03:41:38.600]  surface working a surface deposit was running
[03:41:38.600 --> 03:41:42.920]  between a hundred and 130 ounces of silver per ton and one to ten ounces of
[03:41:42.920 --> 03:41:48.120]  gold per ton and 15 led on the surface
[03:41:48.120 --> 03:41:52.440]  a veining structure that i had traced for about a hundred feet
[03:41:52.440 --> 03:41:57.720]  on the surface 10 feet wide and it sunk on 10 feet deep
[03:41:57.720 --> 03:42:02.200]  and i can tell you you know there was this one of many in this one valley and
[03:42:02.200 --> 03:42:06.040]  the whole region was riddled and had a history
[03:42:06.040 --> 03:42:10.520]  all locked up in parks and preserves but under a national emergency
[03:42:10.520 --> 03:42:14.920]  strategic minerals all the sudden the game is alive because they're also
[03:42:14.920 --> 03:42:20.280]  for major deposits of antimony and and lead and zinc and other strategic
[03:42:20.280 --> 03:42:23.800]  minerals vital to national defense and someday in a
[03:42:23.800 --> 03:42:26.840]  national emergency all these parks and preserves will be open for
[03:42:26.840 --> 03:42:32.520]  mineral location but only to the globalists who funded
[03:42:32.520 --> 03:42:37.320]  bankrolling the the taking of 104 million acres as a major reserve
[03:42:37.320 --> 03:42:41.800]  someday they would get to exploit when they exploit the next emergency for
[03:42:41.800 --> 03:42:45.480]  strategic minerals in the united states i want to talk more about that
[03:42:45.480 --> 03:42:50.440]  after these brief messages you're listening to the info wars
[03:42:50.440 --> 03:42:57.880]  before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and
[03:42:57.880 --> 03:43:01.480]  info wars dot com but also the products at info wars store dot com and there's
[03:43:01.480 --> 03:43:05.880]  one product that's offered at info wars store dot com that is the elite
[03:43:05.880 --> 03:43:09.720]  of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i remember when alex first
[03:43:09.720 --> 03:43:12.440]  started talking about this with some of his special guests
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:17.320]  telomeres and telomere support with your dna and so i started to look into the
[03:43:17.320 --> 03:43:21.240]  science and what telomeres were and how it can improve
[03:43:21.240 --> 03:43:25.240]  your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres so i started
[03:43:25.240 --> 03:43:30.440]  looking into dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite
[03:43:30.440 --> 03:43:34.200]  supplement and then i started seeing other competitors coming up with
[03:43:34.200 --> 03:43:38.440]  competitive supplements for telomere support and they came and they went
[03:43:38.440 --> 03:43:44.040]  but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get excited when
[03:43:44.040 --> 03:43:47.720]  dna force plus is on sale because i know it's expensive so you
[03:43:47.720 --> 03:43:53.640]  should take advantage of 50 off dna force plus at info wars store dot com
[03:43:53.640 --> 03:43:59.720]  serving with info wars is a great honor but i still need my morning coffee

[03:44:53.960 --> 03:44:59.160]  the globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators they are technocrats
[03:44:59.160 --> 03:45:02.840]  they are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to
[03:45:02.840 --> 03:45:06.440]  live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great
[03:45:06.440 --> 03:45:10.760]  destiny to merge with ai gods now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace
[03:45:10.760 --> 03:45:13.720]  we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension but one of the
[03:45:13.720 --> 03:45:17.240]  biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of
[03:45:17.240 --> 03:45:21.080]  control in our lives is our bodies if i wasn't taking the highest
[03:45:21.080 --> 03:45:24.840]  quality supplements from fourslife.com i couldn't do it
[03:45:24.840 --> 03:45:28.920]  that's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly
[03:45:28.920 --> 03:45:32.920]  high quality medical bottleman and double the strength of it in a new

[03:45:54.200 --> 03:45:58.440]  imagine if somebody told you 20 years ago that in the future
[03:45:58.440 --> 03:46:01.880]  universities would be saying don't use the term america or american
[03:46:01.880 --> 03:46:04.920]  and that american flags would be seen as offensive and that
[03:46:04.920 --> 03:46:09.320]  federal courts would be ruling that it's a hate symbol that's all happening
[03:46:09.320 --> 03:46:13.560]  the left are fascist authoritarians they're bullies they're criminals
[03:46:13.560 --> 03:46:16.680]  and now they're trying to make us take down the american flag they say the
[03:46:16.680 --> 03:46:19.720]  betsy ross flag our original flag is evil when she was
[03:46:19.720 --> 03:46:23.640]  an abolitionist but people are fighting back in the symbol war

[03:47:19.080 --> 03:47:24.200]  baggage you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:47:24.200 --> 03:47:30.360]  and welcome back you know uh during the breaks i i get a chance to talk to the
[03:47:30.360 --> 03:47:36.600]  conners today producing a program with daria and the uh in texas you know we
[03:47:36.600 --> 03:47:39.320]  do all this from all these different places you know i'm sitting here in
[03:47:39.320 --> 03:47:42.040]  alaska they're down there in austin then uh
[03:47:42.040 --> 03:47:45.400]  here we are talking to you all over the world on issues so
[03:47:45.400 --> 03:47:50.040]  fundamental uh rights basically and we are talking about uh land rights
[03:47:50.040 --> 03:47:53.720]  throughout this segment and sort of some of the fundamentals about that and how
[03:47:53.720 --> 03:47:57.800]  these things interrelate to our lives personally what they have to do with us
[03:47:57.800 --> 03:48:01.160]  in terms of historical knowledge which people don't
[03:48:01.160 --> 03:48:04.520]  grab anymore there's a lot of this gets lost in the shuffle
[03:48:04.520 --> 03:48:08.760]  um and we were talking at one point about giant vegetables in laskin for
[03:48:08.760 --> 03:48:12.520]  those that get the video i don't know if connor found any of those but
[03:48:12.520 --> 03:48:15.880]  you know agriculture rights you know it's just an important thing and you know
[03:48:15.880 --> 03:48:19.720]  climate change is truly happening whether you agree with the
[03:48:19.720 --> 03:48:26.200]  uh lefties uh that it's um you know that all this change is related to man but
[03:48:26.200 --> 03:48:29.400]  i don't necessarily agree with that at all it's
[03:48:29.400 --> 03:48:33.000]  it's mainly nature but giant vegetables you know 100 pound
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:38.120]  cabbages that taste great you know um giant zucchinis as big as a child you
[03:48:38.120 --> 03:48:43.400]  know uh giant vegetables uh here at the uh in
[03:48:43.400 --> 03:48:46.680]  alaska you know and there's the images of our state
[03:48:46.680 --> 03:48:50.840]  paris some of the giant stuff we have and why is that well there's a couple
[03:48:50.840 --> 03:48:55.400]  reasons we don't use pesticides and fertilizers here what we have is uh
[03:48:55.400 --> 03:48:59.800]  colloidal materials and what are those those are micro particles
[03:48:59.800 --> 03:49:04.280]  um sub micron sizes uh nano particles that are
[03:49:04.280 --> 03:49:08.280]  created under uh two uh two ways one is by by
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:12.520]  volcanic eruption which picks up from the deep earth all of the minerals
[03:49:12.520 --> 03:49:16.920]  from deep stratas and scatter them all over for those watching the mineral
[03:49:16.920 --> 03:49:21.080]  feed this feed you can see the pictures but these minerals scatter
[03:49:21.080 --> 03:49:26.680]  and what also you have is glaciers grinding the rock for thousands of years
[03:49:26.680 --> 03:49:31.400]  for millennium upon millennium and then as they receded all the
[03:49:31.400 --> 03:49:36.200]  dust blowing in the air and forming clays and blowing up every
[03:49:36.200 --> 03:49:40.760]  time the wind blows here uh scatters these particulates back on the
[03:49:40.760 --> 03:49:46.760]  leaves of plants and in the morning when plants um uh hear the
[03:49:46.760 --> 03:49:49.960]  songbirds in the morning and if you wake up early enough you'll hear them even
[03:49:49.960 --> 03:49:53.080]  if they're still breathing and you're you're part of the world you'll hear
[03:49:53.080 --> 03:49:56.440]  them and what happens is the plants actually the pores on the plants
[03:49:56.440 --> 03:50:00.520]  dilate and they actually suck in the morning dew or the moisture
[03:50:00.520 --> 03:50:04.440]  and any dust particles that naturally or pollutants for that matter
[03:50:04.440 --> 03:50:08.040]  and they suck them into the plant so plants both feed from the
[03:50:08.040 --> 03:50:11.880]  leaves from the foliar feeds and from the root systems
[03:50:11.880 --> 03:50:15.000]  so minerals are important that's why we have these giant vegetables they they
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:18.360]  say oh it's a long sunlight well certainly that matters
[03:50:18.360 --> 03:50:22.920]  but it's the soil it's that input it's the solar input you know part one
[03:50:22.920 --> 03:50:26.840]  uh water input part two our water is exceptionally good and it's
[03:50:26.840 --> 03:50:30.360]  carrying colloidal minerals also in the glacial
[03:50:30.360 --> 03:50:33.480]  tills and glacial materials and so on that it's
[03:50:33.480 --> 03:50:37.320]  washing through so it's dissolving those that are dissolvable
[03:50:37.320 --> 03:50:41.000]  and so you have this all of the synergies of this region and now
[03:50:41.000 --> 03:50:45.000]  climate is changing now what's happened that people want to fight about i want
[03:50:45.000 --> 03:50:49.560]  to fight about but here's the truth of the matter in
[03:50:49.560 --> 03:50:56.040]  the last 13 000 years the oceans have receded have you know gotten deeper
[03:50:56.040 --> 03:51:02.120]  actually 300 feet in 13 000 years it's about
[03:51:02.120 --> 03:51:07.000]  three feet uh per hundred years what we're forecasting that's the average
[03:51:07.000 --> 03:51:10.840]  three feet per hundred years because the glaciers where i'm sitting right now
[03:51:10.840 --> 03:51:14.840]  used to be just a thousand two thousand years ago
[03:51:14.840 --> 03:51:19.000]  were a mile thick over my head here in Anchorage
[03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:23.720]  so you know things have changed a lot before automobiles and before humans
[03:51:23.720 --> 03:51:29.880]  carbon footprint so that's a show for another day but the fact is driving
[03:51:29.880 --> 03:51:34.920]  all of our regulation today that's defining how our cultures
[03:51:34.920 --> 03:51:39.000]  live and thrive and i want to talk about the regulatory side also on the
[03:51:39.000 --> 03:51:42.360]  surface of state uses you know i mentioned in one of the past segments
[03:51:42.360 --> 03:51:46.840]  the jones act the restriction of moving a ship from a
[03:51:46.840 --> 03:51:51.800]  us port to a us port it must be built in america versus a us port to a foreign
[03:51:51.800 --> 03:51:55.640]  port or foreign port to a us port any ship will do
[03:51:55.640 --> 03:52:01.160]  the difference is massive ten times the difference in the freight costs on
[03:52:01.160 --> 03:52:05.880]  moving freight around so we need to deal with the jones act in real
[03:52:05.880 --> 03:52:11.320]  terms for alaska so we can ship our oil and gas and mineral products on foreign
[03:52:11.320 --> 03:52:15.480]  built ships just like we can to any foreign producer
[03:52:15.480 --> 03:52:19.080]  we ought to be able to do to an american producer and be able to ship alaskan
[03:52:19.080 --> 03:52:22.920]  products to a lot to us ports on the west coast
[03:52:22.920 --> 03:52:26.280]  and we don't have a railroad link i have that it wouldn't be an argument just
[03:52:26.280 --> 03:52:29.000]  move it on the railroad but we don't have that
[03:52:29.000 --> 03:52:35.720]  we need access to west coast ports as americans in alaska developing
[03:52:35.720 --> 03:52:39.320]  resources that are in the nation's interest to develop
[03:52:39.320 --> 03:52:43.880]  by changing the regulations and changing the jones act as it relates to alaska
[03:52:43.880 --> 03:52:48.280]  to move our raw materials into us rust belt
[03:52:48.280 --> 03:52:53.320]  ports that they can move inland to to be turned into value added because the
[03:52:53.320 --> 03:52:58.520]  other big inputs are energy energy transportation
[03:52:58.520 --> 03:53:02.040]  two of the big inputs when you talk about this
[03:53:02.040 --> 03:53:06.760]  infrastructure and information systems that's energy right i mean these farms
[03:53:06.760 --> 03:53:09.880]  require huge prodigious amounts of energy
[03:53:09.880 --> 03:53:14.920]  transportation is all about energy value added in terms of refineries and
[03:53:14.920 --> 03:53:19.720]  plants and factories is about energy alaska 25 percent of our energy in
[03:53:19.720 --> 03:53:23.720]  alaska is an oil and gas it's hydroelectric on southeast
[03:53:23.720 --> 03:53:27.160]  alaska and we have huge hydroelectric potentials
[03:53:27.160 --> 03:53:30.120]  here and throughout the western states it can be
[03:53:30.120 --> 03:53:33.880]  captured and converted to value added because again
[03:53:33.880 --> 03:53:39.240]  it's it's matching the factors of economic production land entrepreneurship
[03:53:39.240 --> 03:53:43.800]  labor and natural resources through investment through cash being invested
[03:53:43.800 --> 03:53:48.040]  to build factories and plants and refineries and things that create
[03:53:48.040 --> 03:53:52.680]  jobs and opportunity by adding value to the raw materials produced here
[03:53:52.680 --> 03:53:56.600]  and the big factors in the modern age is about information transportation
[03:53:56.600 --> 03:54:00.600]  communication systems fundamentally again energy
[03:54:00.600 --> 03:54:05.160]  then it's about ai and robotics and the advancements of technology
[03:54:05.160 --> 03:54:09.800]  that are making it even more relevant to get things developed closer to the core
[03:54:09.800 --> 03:54:14.600]  of where raw resources are produced and the value added as the money rolls through
[03:54:14.600 --> 03:54:17.480]  the economy can happen here and we put a
[03:54:17.480 --> 03:54:21.080]  show cold on alaska in so many different ways
[03:54:21.080 --> 03:54:25.080]  historically and we continue to do so by regulation
[03:54:25.080 --> 03:54:28.600]  transportation regulation that i just mentioned
[03:54:28.600 --> 03:54:33.000]  when you talk about the fact that climate is changing no one can deny it
[03:54:33.000 --> 03:54:36.120]  and then you look at the agricultural potential of alaska
[03:54:36.120 --> 03:54:39.800]  they made attempts on the state level 30 years ago to create
[03:54:39.800 --> 03:54:44.600]  agricultural areas and i would say it was largely a failure although there are
[03:54:44.600 --> 03:54:48.440]  some really pioneering folks out there in delta
[03:54:48.440 --> 03:54:51.800]  and throughout alaska doing some incredible work
[03:54:51.800 --> 03:54:56.200]  with farms and farming and trying to develop an industry that i think is
[03:54:56.200 --> 03:54:59.800]  getting more and more potential not less and less potential
[03:54:59.800 --> 03:55:04.840]  in the face of climate change and the reality is climate change is here
[03:55:04.840 --> 03:55:09.560]  you can argue about its cause or effect or whatever you want but the reality is
[03:55:09.560 --> 03:55:15.160]  the reality of the 21st century and if everyone stopped everything
[03:55:15.160 --> 03:55:19.160]  they say it might decrease in a hundred years by one degree and i can tell you
[03:55:19.160 --> 03:55:24.120]  the planet is not stopping so that is not going to happen
[03:55:24.120 --> 03:55:29.240]  we need to be smarter about our footprint smarter about our futures but
[03:55:29.240 --> 03:55:33.080]  we can do this we've already done this the technologies exist
[03:55:33.080 --> 03:55:38.360]  to do this soundly but let's have the value in the country where we live
[03:55:38.360 --> 03:55:42.040]  when i was talking about mineral rights and the changes before the last break i
[03:55:42.040 --> 03:55:45.320]  mentioned you know the they don't fund some of the things they allow they don't
[03:55:45.320 --> 03:55:50.360]  fund us how does that work you know but the fact is um we didn't even get
[03:55:50.360 --> 03:55:53.720]  into a lot of the rights that still run with the land that i didn't get to talk
[03:55:53.720 --> 03:55:56.200]  about i want to talk more about mineral
[03:55:56.200 --> 03:55:59.480]  rights and what that means i want to talk more about oil and gas and what it
[03:55:59.480 --> 03:56:03.480]  means and what depletion allowances are as it relates to
[03:56:03.480 --> 03:56:08.680]  the income tax of the early 1900s and in the last few minutes we'll
[03:56:08.680 --> 03:56:13.560]  touch on that because fundamentally again when the income tax came in remember
[03:56:13.560 --> 03:56:17.560]  before they amended the constitution this was unconstitutional tax man's
[03:56:17.560 --> 03:56:20.760]  labor and and what happened with the mineral
[03:56:20.760 --> 03:56:24.040]  industry when the income tax came in is they created this
[03:56:24.040 --> 03:56:28.040]  fiction called depletion allowances as well as you deplete the minerals on the
[03:56:28.040 --> 03:56:30.840]  land i mean you get to write off a percentage
[03:56:30.840 --> 03:56:35.480]  against your taxes and this little shell game allows you
[03:56:35.480 --> 03:56:42.040]  to effectively reduce your tax net taxable income by half
[03:56:42.040 --> 03:56:46.200]  let me say it again your net taxable income
[03:56:46.200 --> 03:56:52.040]  effectively is cut to half under depletion allowances and on public
[03:56:52.040 --> 03:56:56.280]  lands i don't believe depletion allowances should apply because
[03:56:56.280 --> 03:57:00.440]  it's not private industry's resource being depreciated and depleted it's
[03:57:00.440 --> 03:57:05.640]  our word for a token royalty is being depleted
[03:57:05.640 --> 03:57:10.040]  over a trillion dollars worth of oil at a hundred bucks a barrel off the north
[03:57:10.040 --> 03:57:14.120]  slope alone in the last couple of decades
[03:57:14.120 --> 03:57:18.280]  you know the fact of the matter is the national resources
[03:57:18.280 --> 03:57:25.080]  are being hijacked by globalists and the structuring of this began with the
[03:57:25.080 --> 03:57:28.280]  land rights what the indigenous got to keep in
[03:57:28.280 --> 03:57:31.640]  Alaska was all the rights that run with the land
[03:57:31.640 --> 03:57:35.480]  fundamentally what all of us should have with our private land this has been
[03:57:35.480 --> 03:57:43.320]  nick baggage on this friday afternoon on the info wars thanks for being here
[03:57:43.320 --> 03:57:47.320]  last night i'm on info wars dot com and i read chris pratt
[03:57:47.320 --> 03:57:52.760]  criticized for t-shirt choice it is literally the shirt that i envisioned
[03:57:52.760 --> 03:57:56.360]  a betsy ross but also another just classic american flag all 50 stars
[03:57:56.360 --> 03:58:00.360]  with the gads and snake super imposed over and on the back
[03:58:00.360 --> 03:58:03.800]  america's back info wars dot com but what's better than just an american flag
[03:58:03.800 --> 03:58:07.160]  about a don't tread on me under the flag say don't trail the american flag it's
[03:58:07.160 --> 03:58:10.040]  a perfect combo so great minds think alike i mean whoever designed that shirt
[03:58:10.040 --> 03:58:14.040]  we'd already come up with the exact same similar design it is the don't tread on
[03:58:14.040 --> 03:58:17.320]  me american flag t-shirt inspired by the triggering
[03:58:17.320 --> 03:58:21.320]  of leftist of the shirt worn by chris pratt but it's a you know battle
[03:58:21.320 --> 03:58:24.520]  tattered flag like the one that flew over for something and again on the back
[03:58:24.520 --> 03:58:28.520]  it says america's back info wars dot com four
[03:58:28.520 --> 03:58:33.160]  thousand of these babies and that's it so we've got the betsy ross version and
[03:58:33.160 --> 03:58:36.520]  the american flag version at info wars store dot com be
[03:58:36.520 --> 03:58:39.400]  printed in the usa right now info wars store dot com
[03:58:39.400 --> 03:58:44.360]  they'll be right back the most banned broadcast in the world
[03:58:44.360 --> 03:58:47.080]  start to marcus in new york marcus here on the air thanks for holding
[03:58:47.080 --> 03:58:50.520]  hey outlook yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i
[03:58:50.520 --> 03:58:53.720]  talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and one thing i could tell
[03:58:53.720 --> 03:58:57.800]  you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons are
[03:58:57.800 --> 03:59:01.720]  trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the
[03:59:01.720 --> 03:59:05.320]  only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching
[03:59:05.320 --> 03:59:09.160]  2020 that's it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency
[03:59:09.160 --> 03:59:11.960]  it's the only way i think he can be defeated other than assassinating him
[03:59:11.960 --> 03:59:14.840]  it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i just
[03:59:14.840 --> 03:59:17.880]  want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the
[03:59:17.880 --> 03:59:21.720]  reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're
[03:59:21.720 --> 03:59:24.840]  80 years old i would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but
[03:59:24.840 --> 03:59:28.520]  if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won
[03:59:28.520 --> 03:59:32.680]  a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who
[03:59:32.680 --> 03:59:36.120]  are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the info war and even if
[03:59:36.120 --> 03:59:39.960]  something does happen to you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a
[03:59:39.960 --> 03:59:45.160]  lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling
[03:59:45.160 --> 03:59:56.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
