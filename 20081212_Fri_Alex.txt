[00:00.000 --> 00:07.800]  Get the t.com.com or you can call us at 928-308-0408.
[00:07.800 --> 00:12.000]  That's 928-308-0408.
[00:12.000 --> 00:18.500]  Lose those unwanted holiday pounds and don't forget, if you don't get the t, it doesn't work.
[00:18.500 --> 00:25.500]  You're listening to GCN.
[00:33.500 --> 00:39.500]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[00:39.500 --> 00:45.500]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:45.500 --> 00:50.500]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59.500 --> 01:03.500]  It is Friday, ladies and gentlemen, the 12th day of December 2008.
[01:03.500 --> 01:06.500]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours. Program note.
[01:06.500 --> 01:13.500]  I did not do that test show from 4 to 5 p.m. yesterday because we had some glitches with the software.
[01:13.500 --> 01:17.500]  We could have gone live, but I wanted to drill people more on the new show.
[01:17.500 --> 01:22.500]  Before we did that, I will be live today, 4 to 5 p.m. of the test show and starting next Monday.
[01:22.500 --> 01:27.500]  This is my last show in the studio, what we've been in for three and a half years, really attached to it.
[01:27.500 --> 01:30.500]  We will be in the new studio starting Monday.
[01:30.500 --> 01:38.500]  But putting out other fires, dealing with other issues, just didn't have time to get that done yesterday.
[01:38.500 --> 01:45.500]  But we will be live with a special test transmission at prisonplanet.tv and on the infowars.com streams.
[01:45.500 --> 01:54.500]  And then we will not normally be live 4 to 5 p.m. This is a test show starting next week, the regular showtime, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[01:54.500 --> 02:03.500]  And we still haven't chosen which hour or hours to go live in from the new studios on prisonplanet.tv.
[02:03.500 --> 02:09.500]  And as I said, we're going to have guest over video feeds on the show, over phone, in studio.
[02:09.500 --> 02:16.500]  I've also got a tablet where I can put up maps or documents on the screen and write on them.
[02:16.500 --> 02:19.500]  On your screen, we're adding a lot of things.
[02:19.500 --> 02:23.500]  And then frankly, I have to get over there and drill myself.
[02:23.500 --> 02:29.500]  That's why we really didn't go live yesterday, because I've been so busy that I have to learn the controls.
[02:29.500 --> 02:35.500]  Because I control part of the show myself. I control some of the computers, the robotic cameras.
[02:35.500 --> 02:40.500]  And I've got guys in the studio, in the control room doing that as well.
[02:40.500 --> 02:45.500]  So I've got to today get off the air at 3 p.m. We're not going live at prisonplanet.tv today at 2 p.m.
[02:45.500 --> 02:47.500]  Because I'm going to be doing it over there.
[02:47.500 --> 02:50.500]  I've got to rush over to the other office and then drill some more.
[02:50.500 --> 02:56.500]  The guys were up late last night themselves working on it so that I can be in control.
[02:56.500 --> 03:03.500]  And be able to have a document cam, the video feeds, a bunch of other stuff.
[03:03.500 --> 03:07.500]  But we'll be phasing that in over the next few weeks.
[03:07.500 --> 03:18.500]  That said, you know that the last time we saw in the news was last Wednesday, now about eight, nine days ago.
[03:18.500 --> 03:30.500]  It was 8.5 trillion according to the Associated Press, San Francisco Chronicle, and Bloomberg, 8.5 trillion that has been stolen by the private Federal Reserve.
[03:30.500 --> 03:36.500]  Now that's not how much Jones is saying that. That's Congress saying that.
[03:36.500 --> 03:39.500]  That's been in the hearings the last few weeks.
[03:39.500 --> 03:44.500]  And it's in Bloomberg today, Fed refuses to disclose recipients of 2 trillion in lending.
[03:44.500 --> 03:55.500]  Now this four year request goes back to six weeks ago, or about a week and a half after the banker takeover.
[03:55.500 --> 04:06.500]  So there did four year request, Freedom of Information Act request, going back almost six weeks ago.
[04:06.500 --> 04:15.500]  And so this is only the first 2 trillion that was stolen and sent offshore. We know the quote bailout is to predominantly foreign banks.
[04:15.500 --> 04:19.500]  The Federal Reserve is predominantly foreign held out of England.
[04:19.500 --> 04:25.500]  And so it's a lot more than 2 trillion. It's just with paperwork and courts and the federal government, it takes a lot of time.
[04:25.500 --> 04:30.500]  So we're dealing with six weeks ago with 2 trillion stolen in a week and a half.
[04:30.500 --> 04:36.500]  Now it's another 6 and a half trill, and that's a week ago's numbers. We don't know. The numbers haven't come out again.
[04:36.500 --> 04:39.500]  I'm sure it's 9 and a half trillion probably by now.
[04:39.500 --> 04:42.500]  Watch will probably come out this weekend and it'll say 10 trillion or something.
[04:42.500 --> 04:47.500]  But every week it's on average 1 trillion, 300 billion stolen.
[04:47.500 --> 04:50.500]  So a week and a half into this, it was 2 trillion stolen.
[04:50.500 --> 04:54.500]  Bloomberg asked for it from the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the Congress. They were told no.
[04:54.500 --> 04:57.500]  Congress said we're not even being given this.
[04:57.500 --> 05:06.500]  Now, a Fed governor and a bunch of other people are on records saying this is War Powers Act martial law.
[05:06.500 --> 05:10.500]  That's in the New York Times, in Bloomberg. People want sources.
[05:10.500 --> 05:15.500]  So this is a big deal. Kurt Nemo has done a story about it.
[05:15.500 --> 05:18.500]  A bankster has refused to honor Bloomberg's FOIA request.
[05:18.500 --> 05:22.500]  So this is even hard for me to believe this level of corruption.
[05:22.500 --> 05:27.500]  And they're telling us we ain't seen nothing yet. So we'll get into that a lot more. Stay with me.
[05:53.500 --> 05:57.500]  When the president is faced with the expected national security incident,
[05:57.500 --> 06:02.500]  the in-place patriot legislation will control transport and distribution of food.
[06:02.500 --> 06:06.500]  Those of us who are able to take care of ourselves must put in supplies of food.
[06:06.500 --> 06:12.500]  This will free up the relief organizations to give food to those unable or not smart enough to prepare.
[06:12.500 --> 06:18.500]  The greatest gift this Christmas is life itself, food for these unknown times.
[06:18.500 --> 06:27.500]  Call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[06:27.500 --> 06:35.500]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do.
[06:35.500 --> 06:37.500]  Or at least we thought we did.
[06:37.500 --> 06:44.500]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[06:44.500 --> 06:53.500]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[06:53.500 --> 07:00.500]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[07:00.500 --> 07:03.500]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[07:03.500 --> 07:09.500]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[07:09.500 --> 07:18.500]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[07:18.500 --> 07:27.500]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the government sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[07:27.500 --> 07:33.500]  The holiday season is here again. A time to appreciate our friends and family and the many blessings we have.
[07:33.500 --> 07:36.500]  It's also time to find unique gift ideas for those we love.
[07:36.500 --> 07:39.500]  This year, why not give a gift that saves your loved ones money?
[07:39.500 --> 07:44.500]  A two ounce bottle of fuel conditioner from FuelSaver Technologies makes a great stocking stuffer.
[07:44.500 --> 07:46.500]  It's also an inexpensive and thoughtful present.
[07:46.500 --> 07:52.500]  A small squeeze of our product in the gas tank improves combustion, boosting fuel economy 10-20% or more.
[07:52.500 --> 07:54.500]  Completely safe for all engines.
[07:54.500 --> 08:00.500]  Our fuel additive also reduces emissions, maintenance costs, and reduces the friction of engine moving parts.
[08:00.500 --> 08:09.500]  Each little bottle treats 100 gallons of gasoline or 50 gallons of diesel. With a case of 16 or 32 bottles, you'll have plenty to give as gifts.
[08:09.500 --> 08:12.500]  And the cost is only $6 per bottle with free shipping.
[08:12.500 --> 08:20.500]  Call us toll free 866-768-7811 or go online at FuelSaverINC.com.
[08:20.500 --> 08:30.500]  That's 866-768-7811, a unique gift that saves everyone money.
[08:30.500 --> 08:51.500]  These are the keys that T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:51.500 --> 09:04.500]  Once a week economic visit from the International Forecaster will be joining us in the final hour and also will be taking your questions on the economy, the worsening control crises that's ushering in world government.
[09:04.500 --> 09:11.500]  So that is coming up today.
[09:11.500 --> 09:21.500]  I have been very reflective the last few days about the journey we're all on of discovery and awakening and development.
[09:21.500 --> 09:27.500]  The journey in life where we are designed to pick up wisdom and knowledge and to grow as we get older.
[09:27.500 --> 09:34.500]  And all of us, I know, look back on things in our lives that we're proud of, things in our lives that we are embarrassed of.
[09:34.500 --> 09:38.500]  Even if nobody knows what we've done, we're embarrassed ourselves. That's our conscience.
[09:38.500 --> 09:44.500]  And overall, I feel really good about my life and the things I've done.
[09:44.500 --> 09:59.500]  I, growing up, thought that everybody else was a nice person or at least overall was a good person and that everybody else liked blue skies and green fields and happiness.
[09:59.500 --> 10:15.500]  But as I got older, I learned that contrary to that belief, by the time I was probably 13, 14 years old, that many people were downright wicked, downright bad for whatever reasons.
[10:15.500 --> 10:22.500]  And I had a lot of experiences growing up that showed me the dark side of the tracks.
[10:22.500 --> 10:41.500]  And I noticed when I was very young that it was generally people who were supposedly the good guys or the guardians who tended to be the truly evil people using that cover of being a guardian or a good guy to carry out their operations.
[10:41.500 --> 10:57.500]  But I had no idea when I started this journey, this fight against the New World Order, when I was 19 years old, I've been active for a little more than 15 years on air for 13 plus now.
[10:57.500 --> 11:19.500]  You know, every time I think I know just how evil our enemies are, I am blown away by new research, new information, things that are confirmed that even shake me to my very core, someone who you would think that I would think that I'm ready to deal with this knowledge.
[11:19.500 --> 11:34.500]  And the full magnitude of it, I know that's why most people, even if they know something's horribly wrong with the world, don't get involved because at their core, they're afraid.
[11:34.500 --> 11:43.500]  And I've certainly had fear in my life, fear of the unknown, fear of rejection.
[11:43.500 --> 11:55.500]  It was a small child fear of the dark. But as I grew older, that fear changed to more of a concern.
[11:55.500 --> 12:05.500]  And the true fear I have is for the species itself, for society itself, because I truly love mankind.
[12:05.500 --> 12:22.500]  I know that there is so much waiting for us if we can just grow up as a species and be a moral people and follow God's laws that we will be blessed.
[12:22.500 --> 12:27.500]  And folks can laugh at that and say there is no God. Well, whose law do you follow then?
[12:27.500 --> 12:35.500]  The eugenicist that you know as the humanist? I don't mean the humanists in the street, but the founders of what we know as humanism.
[12:35.500 --> 12:46.500]  They control the species, they understand how the species works, they are using scientific data against us, but they are men and women themselves.
[12:46.500 --> 12:54.500]  And they have wrought something terrible. Their fruit is poison.
[12:54.500 --> 13:05.500]  Their product is death and pain and ignorance, and quite frankly, stench.
[13:05.500 --> 13:15.500]  And when I consciously face the true magnitude of our enemy, the reason it shakes me,
[13:15.500 --> 13:43.500]  the reason it chills me and braces my soul is that I realize that I am probably, well there is no doubt, the most prominent person, and I am not that prominent, in the world fighting this system.
[13:43.500 --> 13:48.500]  And I don't have the right stuff, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:48.500 --> 13:53.500]  I'm not up to the task.
[13:53.500 --> 13:56.500]  I am worldly.
[13:56.500 --> 14:07.500]  I am a product of this degenerate society, and though I'm more moral than 99% of people,
[14:07.500 --> 14:18.500]  as good a man as some could say I was, it's all dirty rags, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:18.500 --> 14:30.500]  And so I have to turn it all over to God and just say to the spirit of the universe, the Creator,
[14:30.500 --> 14:42.500]  it's in your hands, guide me, lead me, have me do what you would, have done.
[14:42.500 --> 14:53.500]  And I've said for many years that one of my greatest callings, that one of my main mission statements written on my soul,
[14:53.500 --> 15:06.500]  is to try to wake other people up to be leaders, and I know there are leaders out there who are far finer people than I am.
[15:06.500 --> 15:23.500]  If I have any fear, it is that I won't live up to the challenge I've been given, I won't live up to be the man I should be, that I won't have the time to mature,
[15:23.500 --> 15:28.500]  and do the important work that needs to be done.
[15:28.500 --> 15:41.500]  But I get very upset every day by the corruption I see in the world, the corruption I see in the alternative media, the corruption I see in every facet and layer of society.
[15:41.500 --> 15:48.500]  And if I would have known just how evil the New World Order was 13, 14, 15 years ago, if I could have seen what I've seen now,
[15:48.500 --> 15:55.500]  if I would have known what I know now, I would have worked so much harder a decade ago.
[15:55.500 --> 16:00.500]  I would have done things differently, but that's all in the past and we've had some great success.
[16:00.500 --> 16:08.500]  And that's thanks to you, the men and women out there across the world that have spread the word about the stories and films and audio files,
[16:08.500 --> 16:18.500]  the information we put out here because we've done a pretty good job of accurately assessing and tracking and documenting who and what the New World Order is
[16:18.500 --> 16:26.500]  and what their operations are and what their current operations are and what their future plans are.
[16:26.500 --> 16:35.500]  And I guess my bombastic, aggressive style has had the effect of breaking through people stayed during the headlights programming
[16:35.500 --> 16:45.500]  and has shaken a few people out of their zombie mode to wake up and look around them.
[16:45.500 --> 16:57.500]  So I'm also not taking away from the work I've done through all of you and through all the people you've woken up.
[16:57.500 --> 17:08.500]  It's just, I want the listeners to understand that this New World Order is real and this New World Order is very, very bad
[17:08.500 --> 17:16.500]  and this New World Order is soft killing us. They are hurting us.
[17:16.500 --> 17:28.500]  They are sterilizing us. They are implanting the vaccines with cancer viruses and cancer DNA programs.
[17:28.500 --> 17:35.500]  I don't even know what you call a designed DNA fragment. It's not even a virus.
[17:35.500 --> 17:40.500]  They are the ultimate control freaks, the ultimate in wickedness.
[17:40.500 --> 17:50.500]  They enjoy the raw exercise of power and where a normal person would be horrified to see a small child pinned in a car, crushed, bleeding to death, panicking.
[17:50.500 --> 17:57.500]  They gleam and resonate. They are from the dark side.
[17:57.500 --> 18:11.500]  And the dark side is very good at selling you that the dark side is rebellion, the dark side is power, the dark side is strong.
[18:11.500 --> 18:24.500]  And it is strong. But next to light, it isn't even in the same universe.
[18:24.500 --> 18:36.500]  And evil is recruiting everywhere across the globe. It is twisting the minds of our police, twisting the minds of the military, twisting the minds of the public.
[18:36.500 --> 18:42.500]  They are giving us new heroes, gone are the good guys that fight the torturer or the abductor.
[18:42.500 --> 18:47.500]  The new guys do torture. They do abduct.
[18:47.500 --> 18:54.500]  There is an attempt to vomit out pure evil into your minds and into your souls.
[18:54.500 --> 19:01.500]  And just as much as I tell you to eat organic food as much as you can and to try to be healthy and don't take vaccines and don't drink Florida water,
[19:01.500 --> 19:13.500]  it's even more important to not let all of the evil that is on television and the corporate media and the society into your mind.
[19:13.500 --> 19:18.500]  Your eyes are literally windows into your soul. You are interfacing with it.
[19:18.500 --> 19:23.500]  And you may go see a movie with torture and death and destruction and you're like, oh, I'm a good person. It's entertaining.
[19:23.500 --> 19:31.500]  You are literally becoming a torture. You are literally playing the part of it, being part of it, being immersed in it.
[19:31.500 --> 19:39.500]  You're being conditioned. You're being prepared for that to happen in front of you in the real world and to not care.
[19:39.500 --> 19:45.500]  You know, I meant to start the show with a message to black ops.
[19:45.500 --> 19:53.500]  Most of them, of course, are private corporate mercenaries.
[19:53.500 --> 19:58.500]  There are hundreds of thousands in the United States publicly that we know of.
[19:58.500 --> 20:04.500]  In regard to the rest of them, there are hundreds of thousands overseas.
[20:04.500 --> 20:11.500]  And I want to talk to those men, and they're mainly men. You can't find many women to do stuff like this.
[20:11.500 --> 20:16.500]  It's like most men are serial killers, not most men in general are serial killers.
[20:16.500 --> 20:20.500]  Most serial killers are men, what, 98 percent.
[20:20.500 --> 20:26.500]  I want to talk to you about the journey you are on.
[20:26.500 --> 20:28.500]  We'll talk about that when we get back.
[20:28.500 --> 20:35.500]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone generators starting at $299.
[20:35.500 --> 20:42.500]  Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes and cars,
[20:42.500 --> 20:47.500]  making them free from bacteria, moles, viruses, and complete removal of secondhand smoke.
[20:47.500 --> 20:52.500]  Pet owners, you name it, what else can three oxygen atoms, in other words, ozone do?
[20:52.500 --> 20:58.500]  Hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with ozone before and after operations, and have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[20:58.500 --> 21:02.500]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy.
[21:02.500 --> 21:09.500]  Ozone therapy is used, among other things, to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boosts the immune system.
[21:09.500 --> 21:18.500]  You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic Zone ozone generators by going to IonicZone.com or calling 800-549-9535.
[21:18.500 --> 21:27.500]  That's I-O-N-I-C-Zone.com or toll-free 800-549-9535. Ionic Zone.
[21:27.500 --> 21:34.500]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[21:34.500 --> 21:38.500]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[21:38.500 --> 21:39.500]  Bin Laden.
[21:39.500 --> 21:40.500]  This is his MO.
[21:40.500 --> 21:43.500]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[21:43.500 --> 21:50.500]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[21:50.500 --> 21:57.500]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[21:57.500 --> 22:01.500]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[22:01.500 --> 22:08.500]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[22:08.500 --> 22:13.500]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[22:20.500 --> 22:27.500]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[22:27.500 --> 22:41.500]  Today, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, December 12, 2008. Gold opened this morning at 8.18.60. A 1-ounce gold coin can be purchased for 8.43.13, 4.21.57 for a half ounce, and 2.10.78 for the quarter ounce.
[22:41.500 --> 22:45.500]  That's 8.43.13, 4.21.57, and 2.10.78.
[22:45.500 --> 22:49.500]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S.
[22:49.500 --> 22:55.500]  hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S. treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan Revolution.
[22:55.500 --> 23:06.500]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S. housing market, and throwing the economy into a recession.
[23:06.500 --> 23:10.500]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[23:10.500 --> 23:16.500]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.

[24:28.500 --> 24:43.500]  Big John. Big John. Big John.
[24:43.500 --> 24:47.500]  You didn't give no lift to Big John.
[24:47.500 --> 24:48.500]  Big John.
[24:48.500 --> 24:51.500]  So all of us have a journey in life.
[24:51.500 --> 24:55.500]  And many of us get on the path of trying to be good, decent, honorable people.
[24:55.500 --> 24:59.500]  Many times that's because of our parents, our background, where we come from.
[24:59.500 --> 25:01.500]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home.
[25:01.500 --> 25:02.500]  He just drifted in.
[25:02.500 --> 25:05.500]  But other individuals get on the path of evil.
[25:05.500 --> 25:06.500]  He didn't say much.
[25:06.500 --> 25:07.500]  Kind of quiet.
[25:07.500 --> 25:09.500]  There's a lot of different reasons that that happens.
[25:09.500 --> 25:16.500]  The establishment sifts through the police, the military, the FBI, corporations,
[25:16.500 --> 25:19.500]  and finds the ruthless individuals that will carry out evil.
[25:19.500 --> 25:23.500]  There are thousands of examples of this, but going back to the 30s,
[25:23.500 --> 25:30.500]  the army and the navy would go out and find doctors and scientists
[25:30.500 --> 25:36.500]  that would test chemical, biological weapons, even those back to World War I.
[25:36.500 --> 25:42.500]  But some of the first lethal cases in the 30s, and would you kill a mental patient?
[25:42.500 --> 25:44.500]  Would you kill a brain damaged child?
[25:44.500 --> 25:46.500]  They have no good life anyways.
[25:46.500 --> 25:49.500]  It was all a eugenics view of survival of the fittest.
[25:49.500 --> 25:51.500]  We're only getting rid of the weakest anyways.
[25:51.500 --> 25:56.500]  They were teaching this over 100 years ago in Germany and England, the United States.
[25:56.500 --> 26:00.500]  So that mindset of human life not having a value being bad for the environment,
[26:00.500 --> 26:05.500]  that's one of the big areas where this idea started in the intelligentsia.
[26:05.500 --> 26:10.500]  There had always been kings and queens and elites that didn't care about their own troops dying
[26:10.500 --> 26:14.500]  or their own people starving and going back to Malthus in the 1740s,
[26:14.500 --> 26:18.500]  saying we need to figure out ways to kill off most of the population.
[26:18.500 --> 26:26.500]  So those ideas have always been there going back to the Greek philosophers, Plato and others.
[26:26.500 --> 26:32.500]  But they created these eugenics cadres and they started killing.
[26:32.500 --> 26:37.500]  They started killing retarded children.
[26:37.500 --> 26:46.500]  They started in Germany in the 30s, in the United States in the 30s, in England, in Mexico of all places.
[26:46.500 --> 26:57.500]  And out of those cadres, they developed large groups of scientists, of doctors, of clinic workers
[26:57.500 --> 27:04.500]  who would go out and kill people, who would go out and grab poor people off the streets and sterilize them.
[27:04.500 --> 27:14.500]  And so out of that core group, that's why the U.S. government brought over more than 50,000 Nazis,
[27:14.500 --> 27:19.500]  more than 20,000 of them scientists, a large group of them eugenicists,
[27:19.500 --> 27:25.500]  and they put them over huge military bases in government research laboratories.
[27:25.500 --> 27:32.500]  Scores of them today are named after the eugenicist Nazis because they needed those personnel.
[27:32.500 --> 27:41.500]  And then they said, okay, we're going to put some troops in a chamber, tell them it's just a tear gas test,
[27:41.500 --> 27:43.500]  and then they'd hit them with nerve gas and kill them.
[27:43.500 --> 27:46.500]  Those are declassified.
[27:46.500 --> 27:53.500]  And so the public needs to know that they have now gotten hundreds of thousands of these people in the United States alone
[27:53.500 --> 27:57.500]  that work for them and they're hiring foreigners that will do similar things.
[27:57.500 --> 28:04.500]  Anyone who's proven that they're bloodthirsty killers, tens of thousands of former death squad members from Latin America in the 80s,
[28:04.500 --> 28:14.500]  they're being used in Afghanistan, Iraq, Georgia, Eastern Europe, they're being used in the United States.
[28:14.500 --> 28:22.500]  And the news is preparing us, the Associated Press and the Austin Chronicle this week to have foreign troops in America.
[28:22.500 --> 28:24.500]  It's everywhere.
[28:24.500 --> 28:29.500]  And again, there's just so many thousands of different points.
[28:29.500 --> 28:37.500]  It's just that later in the show, when I start the next hour, I'm going to spend 15, 20 minutes speaking directly to the psychopaths
[28:37.500 --> 28:43.500]  because even if you're a psychopath and even if you like killing people and even if you like setting people up and you like provocaturing people
[28:43.500 --> 28:49.500]  and it's a power trip for you to have all this power
[28:49.500 --> 28:56.500]  and to be able to exercise it this way, I want to explain to you in no uncertain terms
[28:56.500 --> 29:03.500]  that your masters are killing you and hurting you as well.
[29:03.500 --> 29:09.500]  And so it's something you need to think about.
[29:09.500 --> 29:11.500]  It's something you need to deal with.
[29:11.500 --> 29:24.500]  And I know a lot of you've hardened your hearts and gone so deep into darkness, so deep into evil
[29:24.500 --> 29:32.500]  that there's no turning back and that you don't feel like you're alive unless you're doing horrible things.
[29:32.500 --> 29:37.500]  I've talked to a lot of top psychiatrists who've studied and interviewed hundreds of serial killers around the world
[29:37.500 --> 29:41.500]  and it's always the same, Russia, China, the United States.
[29:41.500 --> 29:47.500]  They're like zombies. They're in progression.
[29:47.500 --> 29:53.500]  It's like sexual perversion. You've got to have more and more to excite yourself on that end and then nothing makes you happy.
[29:53.500 --> 30:02.500]  Well, it's the same thing with torture and things like this, that when they're killing, when they're torturing, it's like they're alive.
[30:02.500 --> 30:12.500]  So there's a blazing white light. So I want to address the psychopath specifically and the sociopaths coming up in the next hour.
[30:12.500 --> 30:18.500]  I've got a lot of other news coming up first. Stay with us.
[30:18.500 --> 30:28.500]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:28.500 --> 30:35.500]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic. This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[30:35.500 --> 30:41.500]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver
[30:41.500 --> 30:47.500]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates or saline solutions.
[30:47.500 --> 30:53.500]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level
[30:53.500 --> 30:58.500]  and germs can't mutate to be resistant like they can to modern-day antibiotics.
[30:58.500 --> 31:06.500]  Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements including colloidal silver, gold and copper with a money-back guarantee on the colloidal products we produce.
[31:06.500 --> 31:14.500]  For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of health care and freedom of speech.

[31:28.500 --> 31:37.500]  It is a big idea. A new world order in the near future. Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[31:37.500 --> 31:43.500]  It's known as the Bilderberg. Could their objective be world domination?
[31:43.500 --> 31:54.500]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is in hand.
[31:54.500 --> 32:02.500]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[32:02.500 --> 32:06.500]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[32:06.500 --> 32:09.500]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[32:09.500 --> 32:14.500]  They don't have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their after-easy.

[32:36.500 --> 32:41.500]  The market of the beast is at hand. Governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system.
[32:41.500 --> 32:45.500]  Having a long-term food solution is your only hope to stay free.
[32:45.500 --> 32:53.500]  Now, Survival of Seeds introduces their Escape the Beast Kit, 24 varieties of all-natural, non-genetically modified heirloom seeds.

[33:09.500 --> 33:14.500]  Selling the produce from his incredible heirloom seeds back to him, restaurants and small delis.

[34:05.500 --> 34:08.500]  Then I have Richard Gage on later in the show.
[34:08.500 --> 34:14.500]  Someone to hear your prayers. Someone who's there.
[34:14.500 --> 34:20.500]  On the GMOs popping in as well, Jeffrey Smith, Bob Chapman coming on.
[34:20.500 --> 34:29.500]  Let me cover some of the news and then before the shower ends, I'm going to go ahead and start addressing as simply as I can,
[34:29.500 --> 34:35.500]  because what I tend to do is go off into the evidence of every point I make and then never make the full point.
[34:35.500 --> 34:42.500]  I'll just make the point of basic summation and then give some of the data points for people to check it out for themselves.
[34:42.500 --> 34:46.500]  Most of what I'm talking about is all over the news now.
[34:46.500 --> 34:52.500]  It's like my show from 10 years ago is now mainstream nightly news, because they're now rolling it out.
[34:52.500 --> 34:56.500]  They're now doing it. We're now here.
[34:56.500 --> 35:01.500]  It's been a long march to the gallows for free humanity in this nation.
[35:01.500 --> 35:17.500]  We are now being marched up the steps with the leering hangman smiling at us through a ragged hole in the black mask he wears.
[35:17.500 --> 35:25.500]  It's bad, folks. It's bad to say the least what we face.
[35:25.500 --> 35:39.500]  So we'll go over that. In the news, Fed refuses to disclose recipients of $2 trillion in lending.
[35:39.500 --> 35:54.500]  That's Bloomberg today, and I want to make the important point that Bloomberg six weeks ago put in the foyer request to Treasury,
[35:54.500 --> 36:01.500]  to the private Federal Reserve, to the Congress to find out where the first $2 trillion that was served out in the first two weeks,
[36:01.500 --> 36:06.500]  to private, predominantly offshore banks, where that money went.
[36:06.500 --> 36:20.500]  The Federal Reserve responded by saying, we are above government, we run the government, we are private, no president, no judge, the FBI, no one can even question us.
[36:20.500 --> 36:25.500]  Now, previously, the private Federal Reserve ran the country, but at the pleasure of the Congress.
[36:25.500 --> 36:32.500]  In the Banker Takeover Bill, it states that no court can review them, no agency can review them, Congress cannot review them.
[36:32.500 --> 36:36.500]  They are above the law, and no review is even allowed by anyone.
[36:36.500 --> 36:48.500]  Now, obviously, can Congress pass laws saying that children can be loaded into catapults and used for skeet practice on the White House lawn?
[36:48.500 --> 36:52.500]  No.
[36:52.500 --> 36:58.500]  So they can say they're gods, they can say, you know, they can pass a law saying they were going to nuke the United States.
[36:58.500 --> 37:03.500]  We've passed a law, we're killing everyone, fire weapons.
[37:03.500 --> 37:06.500]  You would say, arrest those men, stop them, don't let them.
[37:06.500 --> 37:08.500]  You know, government is not God.
[37:08.500 --> 37:17.500]  Hitler may have said he was the king, the ruler, the furor, the leader, and he could do whatever he wanted, but that's not the case.
[37:17.500 --> 37:34.500]  But we know it's 8.5 trillion stolen so far, but it's key to understand they won't say where the 2 trillion went because this is a process that's the first four year request done, I guess, five and a half weeks ago, back on November 7th, or five weeks ago, whatever.
[37:34.500 --> 37:49.500]  Federal refuses to disclose recipients of 2 trillion in lending. The Federal Reserve refused a request by Bloomberg News to disclose the recipients of more than 2 trillion of emergency loans from U.S. taxpayers.
[37:49.500 --> 37:52.500]  We've got to pay for that in taxes, by the way.
[37:52.500 --> 37:56.500]  In the assets, the central bank is accepting as collateral.
[37:56.500 --> 38:07.500]  So they give them our money and then the private bank gets assets. Bloomberg filed suit on November 7th under the U.S. Freedom Information Act, and to be technical, weeks before they put in the request and refused so they had to file the suit.
[38:07.500 --> 38:13.500]  So I'm right when I say almost seven weeks, but then it became a lawsuit five weeks ago.
[38:13.500 --> 38:28.500]  Bloomberg filed suit on November 7th under the U.S. Freedom Information Act request that tells about the terms of the 11th Fed lending programs most created during the deepest financial crisis since the Great Depression, which is engineered, of course.
[38:28.500 --> 38:46.500]  The Fed respond to December 8th saying it was allowed to withhold internal memos as well as information about trade secrets and commercial information. The institution confirmed that reports search found 231 pages of documents pertaining to some of the request.
[38:46.500 --> 38:59.500]  And Congress is saying that they're not even being told, and now we have Fed governors and others saying we're not even being allowed to know what's going on by Bernanke.
[38:59.500 --> 39:04.500]  And we've been told that war powers have been declared. Well, what was Congress told seven weeks ago?
[39:04.500 --> 39:11.500]  Back on October 2nd and 3rd, they were told, do this or martial law will be declared, and we'll just do it anyways.
[39:11.500 --> 39:24.500]  Then they just signed the piece of paper. They signed into law something that then made those that voted for it basically parties to the crime in Congress.
[39:24.500 --> 39:32.500]  Now, the sheer bigness of the crime is why they may get away with it. I mean, 8.5 trillion in seven weeks.
[39:32.500 --> 39:39.500]  And that's, again, last Wednesday's numbers. It's grown by at least a trillion following the trend in the last week.
[39:39.500 --> 39:46.500]  Hundreds of billions a day, and you're going to pay for it. And that's why suddenly everybody's being audited or the IRS is claiming penalties and interest.
[39:46.500 --> 39:54.500]  And then they're squeezing and the cops admit they're everywhere writing tickets for local government and all these new taxes and regulations when the people don't have it.
[39:54.500 --> 39:56.500]  That's the plan.
[39:56.500 --> 40:11.500]  Now, the compartmentalized local cop or local city council, they don't know that.
[40:11.500 --> 40:15.500]  So this is all part of the just amazing lawlessness.
[40:15.500 --> 40:24.500]  GOP Senator warns of riots if automakers are bailed out.
[40:24.500 --> 40:30.500]  Senator Jim DeMint says, unfair union influence in the bailout culture will anger many Americans.
[40:30.500 --> 40:36.500]  They're saying, Hey, if you won't bail out the automakers, why'd you bail out foreign banks? There'll be riots.
[40:36.500 --> 40:41.500]  Well, that's what North comes for to make sure the heist goes according to plan.
[40:41.500 --> 40:45.500]  Manila reports of Bolivirus and pigs. Financial Times of London. That's huge news.
[40:45.500 --> 40:50.500]  Is Emmanuel the advisor on government tapes? Is it Jesse Jackson? Jesse Jackson Jr.
[40:50.500 --> 40:57.500]  Ronald manual was up to his eyeballs with the governor on tape.
[40:57.500 --> 41:03.500]  So trying to sell the Senate seat. This is part of the course.
[41:03.500 --> 41:09.500]  Secretary of Defense Gates seeks more troops in Afghanistan by spring.
[41:09.500 --> 41:13.500]  That's where Ted Anderson's son's going. He's got out of boot camp.
[41:13.500 --> 41:20.500]  Mexicans. Congress approves widening police powers. Everyone that gets a cell phone will be fingerprinted total police state.
[41:20.500 --> 41:25.500]  Meanwhile, it's the government dealing the majority of the drugs and people can scoff at that in the US, but it's admitted in Mexico.
[41:25.500 --> 41:31.500]  They control the thing. Also a story on prisonplanet.com fed that they've been doing trap truthers.
[41:31.500 --> 41:38.500]  I'm going to get into that later. New York City firefighter accused of calling in false alarms.
[41:38.500 --> 41:44.500]  It's usually an inside job. That's some of the news I have here.
[41:44.500 --> 41:49.500]  But I wanted to get a guest on the show because I've had a lot of them.
[41:49.500 --> 41:53.500]  We're going to do this up until the next break and I'll get back into all this news.
[41:53.500 --> 42:03.500]  I wanted to get Tyler Palmer on the show because we have a sponsor, a cola blue.
[42:03.500 --> 42:13.500]  It's just a fantastic atmospheric water generator.
[42:13.500 --> 42:17.500]  A lot of people have been asking me questions about it. All I know is we got two of them. We love them.
[42:17.500 --> 42:22.500]  It's the best tasting water. It comes from the atmosphere and then goes through five filters.
[42:22.500 --> 42:30.500]  I wanted to spend some time directly talking to Tyler Palmer about this in the great company, a cola blue.
[42:30.500 --> 42:32.500]  Tyler, thanks for coming on with us.
[42:32.500 --> 42:34.500]  I like how you're doing.
[42:34.500 --> 42:35.500]  It's good to have you here.
[42:35.500 --> 42:36.500]  Thank you.
[42:36.500 --> 42:41.500]  You bet. Tell us about yourself. Tell us about the company. Tell us about the technology.
[42:41.500 --> 42:44.500]  People say, what do you mean water from the atmosphere? A lot of folks don't know.
[42:44.500 --> 42:47.500]  There's water in the atmosphere. That's what clouds are.
[42:47.500 --> 42:53.500]  I know most people know that but they don't understand that this is completely fluoride free.
[42:53.500 --> 42:57.500]  There's nothing in it except what was in the air and then it goes through five filters.
[42:57.500 --> 43:09.500]  It's essentially based on the same technology that all of us are familiar with in our air conditioning systems and HVAC systems.
[43:09.500 --> 43:18.500]  I don't know. A lot of listeners may have noticed in the summer they park and they look underneath their car and it looks like water is leaking out.
[43:18.500 --> 43:28.500]  What happens is there's moisture in the air. Even in very dry climates there can be moisture in the air.
[43:28.500 --> 43:37.500]  The machine uses a condenser and it condenses the moisture in the air.
[43:37.500 --> 43:49.500]  That condensate is filtered five times through four activated carbon filters and one reverse osmosis system.
[43:49.500 --> 43:55.500]  It's also blasted with 245 nanometer UV light.
[43:55.500 --> 44:03.500]  It's actually seven filters if you want to be technical like that.
[44:03.500 --> 44:12.500]  When I got into the company my brother-in-law is an ex-retired professional tennis player.
[44:12.500 --> 44:22.500]  He told me about these systems and we tried a few of them out and none of them met our standards.
[44:22.500 --> 44:36.500]  We immediately just taken aback by the potential to bring water to the 1.2 billion people on the planet that do not have access to clean drinking water.
[44:36.500 --> 44:42.500]  That's right. They're saying global water shortages, big companies are grabbing up all the big aquifers, they're jacking up water prices.
[44:42.500 --> 44:50.500]  They're trying to put meters on wells or ban drilling wells all over the western world trying to monopolize it claiming you don't own your own water table.
[44:50.500 --> 44:58.500]  This just completely cuts them out because hey, you've got this system. This is amazing.
[44:58.500 --> 45:06.500]  It gives you complete control. It's the equivalent of being off-grid with your water, your drinking water.
[45:06.500 --> 45:22.500]  Like you said, the water is, I may be accused of being hyperbolic at times, but I tend to say that it tastes like velvety, almost like a mousse.
[45:22.500 --> 45:32.500]  It is so soft and just refreshing. The first time I tasted it, I was really, really impressed.
[45:32.500 --> 45:36.500]  It was just from then on I became passionate about it.
[45:36.500 --> 45:42.500]  I found it has that velvety taste the best I've ever had unless we leave for a week or something.
[45:42.500 --> 45:50.500]  Then we've got to, even though the lights on, we've got to come in and it doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste magic if it's left sitting in there.
[45:50.500 --> 46:08.500]  Any water that's left sitting over a long, long period of time, if it does not have the UV light, we're not putting any chloramine or chlorine or any additives in this.
[46:08.500 --> 46:16.500]  The water is kept fresh through reflux and through the exposure to the UV light.
[46:16.500 --> 46:22.500]  On average, it does seven and a half gallons a day. The key is, folks, that's more than anybody's going to use.
[46:22.500 --> 46:30.500]  That's for cooking, that's for drinking. I'd say seven and a half gallons. That's good for a family of four or five, isn't it?
[46:30.500 --> 46:47.500]  Oh yeah, completely. My sister, I have two nephews. One of the things that surprised me is the amount of women that are interested in this product.
[46:47.500 --> 46:59.500]  Maybe I was just being naive about it, but the women, the mothers, they love this thing because they know what their children are getting.
[46:59.500 --> 47:08.500]  They cook with it. It's enough water to provide a family of four with drinking water.
[47:08.500 --> 47:13.500]  It doesn't run out. It just keeps making more water.
[47:13.500 --> 47:22.500]  Let's be clear, too. This is your small unit. You've got bigger units. In fact, you guys tried to send me a really huge one.
[47:22.500 --> 47:28.500]  I said, no, no, I don't need to take care of my whole neighborhood. I don't have room for it, but you've got a whole bunch of other products.
[47:28.500 --> 47:35.500]  Also, you can plug a solar panel, a small one, into this, a medium-sized one, and then you're even off the electricity grid.
[47:35.500 --> 47:49.500]  The problem with the... We make a 200, a 500, a 1,000, 3,000, and a 5,000 liter per day series of machines.
[47:49.500 --> 47:59.500]  Actually, the 200 liter per day machine is quite affordable. It's not as expensive as a lot of people would think.
[47:59.500 --> 48:13.500]  But the economics of the situation for the smaller machine, unless you already have a solar system set up at your house, it's not really a good match.
[48:13.500 --> 48:28.500]  The larger machines are more appropriate for the solar and wind solution, although we do have and are actively designing a solar model that will run on...
[48:28.500 --> 48:35.500]  We're actually trying to get it to run off of a Ken solar-like system.
[48:35.500 --> 48:45.500]  All right. Now, expanding on that... Well, again, I'm just really excited about it.
[48:45.500 --> 48:50.500]  Folks out there are really excited about it, and I have them, and I use them, and they're great.
[48:50.500 --> 48:57.500]  We looked at a lot of other companies, and we chose to try to go with you guys and contacted you because we liked your system,
[48:57.500 --> 49:03.500]  and also because you guys are a bigger company, and make and sell a whole bunch of these.
[49:03.500 --> 49:08.500]  I hope that people will visit the website, tell people how they can get them, and how fast it ships out to them.
[49:08.500 --> 49:19.500]  Right now, we're in stock. We have 250 units, and we will ship them.
[49:19.500 --> 49:27.500]  If we get... We're going to give listeners a break if they call in, and we can ship those out.
[49:27.500 --> 49:35.500]  I want to say, before Christmas, they will arrive, so next week, we can get them out to listeners.
[49:35.500 --> 49:38.500]  Absolutely. You've got 250 units right now.
[49:38.500 --> 49:40.500]  Yes.
[49:40.500 --> 49:43.500]  So folks can call. Give them the number.
[49:43.500 --> 49:53.500]  Let's see. It's 1-866-585-4044.
[49:53.500 --> 50:01.500]  Absolutely. Again, that's 866-585-4044, or a coloblue.com, an atmospheric water generator for the home.
[50:01.500 --> 50:06.500]  It pays for itself in one year if you buy your water from the store, pure clean water without the fluoride,
[50:06.500 --> 50:13.500]  ultimate water from the humidity in the air, machine produce up to 28 liters of water in 48 hours, or 7.5 gallons.
[50:13.500 --> 50:18.500]  I'll tell you, it does more than that in Texas. It's so humid here. People think we're desert in Austin. It's not.
[50:18.500 --> 50:25.500]  Great tasting, pure H2O, exactly the way nature makes it. Again, I can't say enough about it and the affordability of the unit.
[50:25.500 --> 50:28.500]  You're saying you're giving people a break?
[50:28.500 --> 50:40.500]  Yeah, we're going to give your listeners free shipping, and we're also going to throw in a solar iPhone pod charger
[50:40.500 --> 50:47.500]  to listeners who order a machine by Sunday, midnight, often time.
[50:47.500 --> 50:49.500]  What's an iPhone iPod charger?
[50:49.500 --> 51:00.500]  It's a little photovoltaic cell that will plug into an iPod or an iPhone and charge it with the sun.
[51:00.500 --> 51:01.500]  Wow.
[51:01.500 --> 51:06.500]  You know what? Stay there, because I want to hear more about that when we get back, and then I'm going to get into all the news, folks,
[51:06.500 --> 51:10.500]  and my little message to the New World Order minions out there.
[51:10.500 --> 51:20.500]  So, stay with us. I want to continue discussing this with Tyler Palmer, who heads up AkolaBlue.com,
[51:20.500 --> 51:28.500]  we got big banners up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com. Stay with us.
[51:28.500 --> 51:32.500]  Santa, Christmas Eve, and you haven't left yet?
[51:32.500 --> 51:38.500]  Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho. No. I can't find my keys.
[51:38.500 --> 51:43.500]  Here's the perfect gift. Our patented Find One Find All keyfinder, or FOFA XT for short.
[51:43.500 --> 51:49.500]  Once a FOFA keyfinder is attached to each of those easy to lose things, it can be found by all the rest.
[51:49.500 --> 51:55.500]  Use your wallet to find your keys, your keys to find the remote control, or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.
[51:55.500 --> 52:01.500]  FOFA goes through walls, cushions and laundry baskets up to 30 feet, and projects a loud 90 plus decibel beep.
[52:01.500 --> 52:04.500]  And new for Christmas, there's even a FOFA just for eyeglasses.
[52:04.500 --> 52:07.500]  Where did I put my glasses, Mrs. Claus?
[52:07.500 --> 52:09.500]  Oh, here they are.
[52:09.500 --> 52:13.500]  Luckily, Rudolph's nose isn't the only thing that flashes.
[52:13.500 --> 52:19.500]  Order your FOFA today. With batteries included, along with a 30-day money-back guarantee, call 866-245-8670.
[52:19.500 --> 52:27.500]  That's 866-245-8670, or buy online at FindOneFindAll.com. Again, that's FindOneFindAll.com.
[52:27.500 --> 52:34.500]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[52:34.500 --> 52:38.500]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[52:38.500 --> 52:40.500]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[52:40.500 --> 52:43.500]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[52:43.500 --> 52:50.500]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[52:50.500 --> 52:57.500]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[52:57.500 --> 53:01.500]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[53:01.500 --> 53:08.500]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[53:08.500 --> 53:15.500]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com
[53:15.500 --> 53:20.500]  or see it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[53:20.500 --> 53:27.500]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[53:27.500 --> 53:35.500]  The holidays are right around the corner. The crowds, the countless hours in traffic, finding a parking spot,
[53:35.500 --> 53:38.500]  just to buy a gift you're worried they might not like anyway.
[53:38.500 --> 53:43.500]  How about surprising your loved ones with a gift they can use every day of the year?

[54:43.500 --> 54:50.500]  you need to have water filtration systems so they can cut the water off coming to your house, they can't cut the water coming out of the atmosphere.
[54:50.500 --> 54:54.500]  I'm telling you this is the best tasting water I've ever run into.
[54:54.500 --> 54:59.500]  So I hope you'll check it out at AkolaBlue.com or call 866-585-4044.
[54:59.500 --> 55:05.500]  In closing, by the way, Tyler Palmer was a really easy sell to be a sponsor once we researched all these units
[55:05.500 --> 55:11.500]  and checked him out and got one and then approached him because he was a fan of the show going back many years.
[55:11.500 --> 55:13.500]  So he's also a fellow patriot.
[55:13.500 --> 55:15.500]  Tyler, how long have you been listening to the show?
[55:15.500 --> 55:20.500]  I've been listening to you for about three years, thanks to George Norrie.
[55:20.500 --> 55:25.500]  And I stopped listening to him and started listening to you all the time.
[55:25.500 --> 55:31.500]  Don't say that. Listen, George is a great guy, a great show, and he has done so much for this show.
[55:31.500 --> 55:38.500]  I'm big fans of both, but I was just completely, I resonated with your message.
[55:38.500 --> 55:49.500]  I felt your frustration and your honesty and I am very, very pleased to be able to sponsor the show just in philosophy.
[55:49.500 --> 55:53.500]  Well, I'll tell you what I really like about you guys is you just have the best unit.
[55:53.500 --> 55:55.500]  I went and looked at it and looked at all the ratings.
[55:55.500 --> 56:00.500]  You have a great price and I have friends and family that have ordered your units
[56:00.500 --> 56:03.500]  and they come in about a week and a half or even quicker.
[56:03.500 --> 56:07.500]  And that's what I like, too, because I talked to some other folks that have ordered some other machines.
[56:07.500 --> 56:12.500]  I've drunk out of some of the other machines. They taste okay, but they don't have the seven filters.
[56:12.500 --> 56:14.500]  I thought it was five.
[56:14.500 --> 56:19.500]  And so, I mean, I think you've got the best unit and that's why we've got you guys as a sponsor.
[56:19.500 --> 56:21.500]  I know you've had a huge response as well.
[56:21.500 --> 56:25.500]  And I hope folks don't wait and don't procrastinate. I hope they give you a call.
[56:25.500 --> 56:34.500]  Yeah, and I want to just say your listeners are just the most amazing, intelligent, pleasant people to speak to.
[56:34.500 --> 56:42.500]  And it's just wonderful. It's a great match with us and you guys.
[56:42.500 --> 56:49.500]  Well, the great thing is it's such a small unit. I mean, it looks just like, but it's got hot water, cold water, all these settings.
[56:49.500 --> 56:56.500]  It's real high-tech, but easy to use, very user-friendly, has a nice digital screen on the front so you see everything as you punch.
[56:56.500 --> 57:03.500]  I don't know how you guys kept the price down this low, but it's, again, the thing sells itself, folks.
[57:03.500 --> 57:07.500]  866-585-4044. Get off the water grid.
[57:07.500 --> 57:08.500]  Yeah.
[57:08.500 --> 57:09.500]  AkalaBlue.com.
[57:09.500 --> 57:17.500]  Well, we'll talk to you again in the very near future, Tyler, and get more into the guts, more of the machinery of this thing and how it works.
[57:17.500 --> 57:18.500]  But thanks for coming on with us.
[57:18.500 --> 57:20.500]  Thank you, Alex. You have a good weekend.
[57:20.500 --> 57:21.500]  You too, my friend.
[57:21.500 --> 57:24.500]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[57:24.500 --> 57:29.500]  I was going to have him on earlier and got the time zones mixed up, but we were glad to get him on.
[57:29.500 --> 57:31.500]  And I do believe in the system.
[57:31.500 --> 57:36.500]  Okay, we're going to start the next hour, and I'm going to finish up with the stack of news.
[57:36.500 --> 57:39.500]  Part of the stack of news I have in front of me.
[57:39.500 --> 57:43.500]  And then, as I said, we have Richard Gage coming up in about an hour and five minutes.
[57:43.500 --> 57:45.500]  Then we have Bob Chapman coming on.
[57:45.500 --> 57:46.500]  I feel kind of bad.
[57:46.500 --> 57:54.500]  We double-booked Jeffrey Smith today on the show.
[57:54.500 --> 57:56.500]  And I don't think I told the producer to get that down in the book.
[57:56.500 --> 58:00.500]  It's just all crazy over here, especially finishing up the new studio.
[58:00.500 --> 58:06.500]  And all the other projects working on a Barack Obama slash economy film.
[58:06.500 --> 58:10.500]  And we're working on a lot of other things right now, so it's wild.
[58:10.500 --> 58:15.500]  And we do have more and more reports of feds attempting to approach 9-11 truthers and talking about,
[58:15.500 --> 58:17.500]  hey, let's do violent things.
[58:17.500 --> 58:18.500]  Let's do this and that.
[58:18.500 --> 58:19.500]  They're clearly feds.
[58:19.500 --> 58:24.500]  I've had feds do this to myself over the years many times.
[58:24.500 --> 58:27.500]  And they don't even hide the fact that they're feds after talking to them for 10 minutes.
[58:27.500 --> 58:28.500]  They're just laughing at you.
[58:28.500 --> 58:31.500]  And they are so criminal.
[58:31.500 --> 58:33.500]  I mean, they are so mobster-like.
[58:33.500 --> 58:37.500]  So we'll talk about some of that as well.
[58:37.500 --> 58:41.500]  Coming up today, there's just so many great stories.
[58:41.500 --> 58:46.500]  So informative, the Kurt Nemo, Paul Watson, and others are writing.
[58:46.500 --> 58:51.500]  Steve Watson, Aaron Dyke's up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[58:51.500 --> 58:53.500]  GOP Senator Warns of Riots.
[58:53.500 --> 58:57.500]  If automakers are bailed out, we'll get into that also in Manila.
[58:57.500 --> 59:01.500]  Capital of the Philippines.
[59:01.500 --> 59:03.500]  They're reporting Ebola and pigs.
[59:03.500 --> 59:04.500]  What is this about?
[59:04.500 --> 59:06.500]  This is very disconcerting.
[59:06.500 --> 59:10.500]  Stay with us.
[59:10.500 --> 59:12.500]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[59:12.500 --> 59:18.500]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[59:18.500 --> 59:20.500]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[59:20.500 --> 59:23.500]  I've come with a message of information.
[59:23.500 --> 59:25.500]  9-11 was an inside job.
[59:25.500 --> 59:27.500]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[59:27.500 --> 59:28.500]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[59:28.500 --> 59:31.500]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage.
[59:31.500 --> 59:33.500]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller,
[59:33.500 --> 59:36.500]  the Thrallateral Commission, the CAFAR.
[59:36.500 --> 59:40.500]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day
[59:40.500 --> 59:44.500]  that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[59:44.500 --> 59:47.500]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[59:47.500 --> 59:50.500]  a global awakening has taken place.
[59:50.500 --> 59:57.500]  An inside job? How dare you?
[59:57.500 --> 59:59.500]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[59:59.500 --> 1:00:01.500]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:03.500]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:00:03.500 --> 1:00:06.500]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years,
[1:00:06.500 --> 1:00:20.500]  we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.
[1:00:20.500 --> 1:00:27.500]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:37.500]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:37.500 --> 1:00:40.500]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[1:00:40.500 --> 1:00:44.500]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:00:44.500 --> 1:00:49.500]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:49.500 --> 1:01:09.500]  We're now into the second hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:13.500]  And I want to run through some of the news,
[1:01:13.500 --> 1:01:15.500]  but we won't have time to cover it all right now,
[1:01:15.500 --> 1:01:19.500]  because I want to get into the nature of the police state we're living in,
[1:01:19.500 --> 1:01:22.500]  the type of people they have working for them,
[1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:24.500]  and what as a society we face,
[1:01:24.500 --> 1:01:26.500]  but also a message to the enforcers,
[1:01:26.500 --> 1:01:33.500]  a message to the individuals that are destroying our way of life,
[1:01:33.500 --> 1:01:37.500]  destroying our republic that are engaging in high treason.
[1:01:37.500 --> 1:01:40.500]  So I'll do that coming up in the next segment.
[1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:43.500]  I already covered last hour in some detail
[1:01:43.500 --> 1:01:49.500]  just how big a deal it is that seven weeks after Bloomberg and others
[1:01:49.500 --> 1:01:52.500]  demanded in five weeks after they sued,
[1:01:52.500 --> 1:01:56.500]  the federal government has refused to release any details of the first two trillion,
[1:01:56.500 --> 1:01:59.500]  that's when the suit began, now it's 8.5 trillion.
[1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:01.500]  They will not say where it's gone,
[1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:05.500]  though in some press releases they admit it's going to offshore foreign banks,
[1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:08.500]  because those banks themselves are announcing it.
[1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:10.500]  The head of Goldman Sachs also bragged to the New York Times
[1:02:10.500 --> 1:02:14.500]  three weeks ago that they're giving it to themselves as huge bonuses,
[1:02:14.500 --> 1:02:16.500]  billions of dollars of it,
[1:02:16.500 --> 1:02:20.500]  and buying up other banks and insurance companies that are solving,
[1:02:20.500 --> 1:02:23.500]  and then letting insolve the ones just go under.
[1:02:23.500 --> 1:02:27.500]  They're also continuing the cash freeze to Main Street,
[1:02:27.500 --> 1:02:30.500]  allowing the economy to implode,
[1:02:30.500 --> 1:02:34.500]  and then now the Federal Reserve is announcing that they are going to create their own T-bills
[1:02:34.500 --> 1:02:36.500]  and cut Uncle Sam completely out of it,
[1:02:36.500 --> 1:02:38.500]  and literally you'll buy your quote government bonds,
[1:02:38.500 --> 1:02:42.500]  but they won't be government, from the private Federal Reserve,
[1:02:42.500 --> 1:02:44.500]  with no transparency.
[1:02:44.500 --> 1:02:46.500]  That's in the New York Times yesterday,
[1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:48.500]  I mean that is just massive,
[1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:50.500]  you'll buy your carbon credits from them,
[1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:52.500]  you'll pay your environmental taxes to them,
[1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:55.500]  and then they will meet out some of it to the locals,
[1:02:55.500 --> 1:02:57.500]  they are openly becoming the government.
[1:02:57.500 --> 1:03:00.500]  First they were this illegitimate outside force that could do whatever it wanted,
[1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:03.500]  and issue all the currency and liquidity they wanted,
[1:03:03.500 --> 1:03:05.500]  and get paid interest on it.
[1:03:05.500 --> 1:03:07.500]  Now they're just being the total issue with,
[1:03:07.500 --> 1:03:10.500]  you know, the total issuer of all of this.
[1:03:10.500 --> 1:03:15.500]  It is just earth shattering the magnitude of it,
[1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:18.500]  and I cannot stress that enough.
[1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:21.500]  Meanwhile, GOP Senator Warren's of riots,
[1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:22.500]  of automakers are bailed out,
[1:03:22.500 --> 1:03:24.500]  we have an audio clip of this I'll play later,
[1:03:24.500 --> 1:03:25.500]  Senator Jim Dermott says,
[1:03:25.500 --> 1:03:30.500]  unfair union influence in the bailout culture will anger many Americans.
[1:03:30.500 --> 1:03:34.500]  Time and again we've heard about the lost jobs and economic impact
[1:03:34.500 --> 1:03:39.500]  of failing to bail out the beleaguered American auto manufacturers,
[1:03:39.500 --> 1:03:43.500]  but little mention has been made of the consequences of going through
[1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:45.500]  with the bailout,
[1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:48.500]  and how such an action would be viewed by other Americans.
[1:03:48.500 --> 1:03:51.500]  In an interview following the December 10th press conference,
[1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:57.500]  where he and four other senators aired their opposition to the proposed bailout deal,
[1:03:57.500 --> 1:03:59.500]  struck by congressional leaders in the White House,
[1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:05.500]  and approved by the U.S. House of Representatives 237 to 170,
[1:04:05.500 --> 1:04:08.500]  Senator Jim Dermott,
[1:04:08.500 --> 1:04:11.500]  the Republican South Carolina warned that the perception that some industries
[1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:14.500]  are being bailed out and some aren't, could lead to violence.
[1:04:14.500 --> 1:04:16.500]  Quote, we're going to have riots,
[1:04:16.500 --> 1:04:19.500]  there are already people rioting because they're losing their jobs,
[1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:22.500]  and the media is keeping that quiet, but it is happening.
[1:04:22.500 --> 1:04:24.500]  When everybody else is being bailed out,
[1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:27.500]  the fairness of it becomes more and more evident as we go along.
[1:04:27.500 --> 1:04:29.500]  The auto companies may be hurting, he said,
[1:04:29.500 --> 1:04:31.500]  but there are very few companies that aren't hurting,
[1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:33.500]  and they're going to hurt.
[1:04:33.500 --> 1:04:36.500]  We don't have enough money to bail out everyone.
[1:04:36.500 --> 1:04:38.500]  They went on to say they're going to riot.
[1:04:38.500 --> 1:04:40.500]  Now, here's the deal,
[1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:45.500]  the public's mad and ready to riot over not being bailed out themselves.
[1:04:45.500 --> 1:04:48.500]  What if they knew the bankers engineered all of this on paper,
[1:04:48.500 --> 1:04:50.500]  publicly and IMF and World Bank documents,
[1:04:50.500 --> 1:04:52.500]  and International Bank of Settlement documents?
[1:04:52.500 --> 1:04:55.500]  What if the public knew
[1:04:55.500 --> 1:04:58.500]  that the banks have cut off liquidity by design
[1:04:58.500 --> 1:05:03.500]  and are hoarding all the cash to buy up the economy as it implodes in the stock market?
[1:05:03.500 --> 1:05:05.500]  Well, it's our job to let them know,
[1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:07.500]  but not so they riot,
[1:05:07.500 --> 1:05:11.500]  so that we can somehow take control of the government,
[1:05:11.500 --> 1:05:16.500]  cause the FBI, the military, the Congress to do the right thing,
[1:05:16.500 --> 1:05:20.500]  and say, we're not going to put up with your martial law out of the executive now, Obama.
[1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:25.500]  We are going to go arrest these bankers and stop this.
[1:05:25.500 --> 1:05:27.500]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[1:05:34.500 --> 1:05:36.500]  The time clock is ticking.
[1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:38.500]  Laws could change.
[1:05:38.500 --> 1:05:40.500]  The New World Order is advancing rapidly.
[1:05:40.500 --> 1:05:43.500]  Health consciousness is fading away.
[1:05:43.500 --> 1:05:48.500]  Junk food, fast food, fat food is the New World Order's game.
[1:05:48.500 --> 1:05:50.500]  Don't play the game.
[1:05:50.500 --> 1:05:52.500]  Slim down, detox,
[1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:54.500]  and cleanse yourself from the chemical foods
[1:05:54.500 --> 1:05:57.500]  and processed food that we intake daily.
[1:05:57.500 --> 1:05:58.500]  And now for the holiday special.
[1:05:58.500 --> 1:06:00.500]  Buy one month of super tea,
[1:06:00.500 --> 1:06:02.500]  and we'll throw in an extra two weeks.
[1:06:02.500 --> 1:06:03.500]  That's right.
[1:06:03.500 --> 1:06:04.500]  One month of super tea,
[1:06:04.500 --> 1:06:06.500]  and we'll throw in an extra two weeks.
[1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:07.500]  It won't last long,
[1:06:07.500 --> 1:06:08.500]  so order now.
[1:06:08.500 --> 1:06:10.500]  GetTheTea.com.
[1:06:10.500 --> 1:06:12.500]  That's GetTheTea.com.
[1:06:12.500 --> 1:06:18.500]  Or call us at 928-308-0408.
[1:06:18.500 --> 1:06:22.500]  That's 928-308-0408.
[1:06:22.500 --> 1:06:24.500]  Order now before you can't.
[1:06:28.500 --> 1:06:31.500]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:34.500]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:06:34.500 --> 1:06:37.500]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[1:06:37.500 --> 1:06:38.500]  But who is the enemy?
[1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:39.500]  Aladdin.
[1:06:39.500 --> 1:06:40.500]  This is his MO.
[1:06:40.500 --> 1:06:42.500]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[1:06:42.500 --> 1:06:44.500]  We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:06:44.500 --> 1:06:46.500]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:06:46.500 --> 1:06:48.500]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:06:48.500 --> 1:06:51.500]  to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:06:51.500 --> 1:06:54.500]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again,
[1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:58.500]  very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:06:58.500 --> 1:07:02.500]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:07:02.500 --> 1:07:04.500]  Aladdin's connections to the CIA,
[1:07:04.500 --> 1:07:06.500]  the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[1:07:06.500 --> 1:07:07.500]  the Saudi Arabian connection,
[1:07:07.500 --> 1:07:09.500]  the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:07:09.500 --> 1:07:11.500]  things in war games, the shadow government,
[1:07:11.500 --> 1:07:12.500]  and much, much more.
[1:07:12.500 --> 1:07:13.500]  Fabled Enemies.

[1:07:21.500 --> 1:07:25.500]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[1:07:28.500 --> 1:07:31.500]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases
[1:07:31.500 --> 1:07:34.500]  cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[1:07:34.500 --> 1:07:36.500]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic
[1:07:36.500 --> 1:07:39.500]  due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[1:07:39.500 --> 1:07:41.500]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance
[1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:44.500]  and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[1:07:44.500 --> 1:07:46.500]  People who alkalize the water they drink
[1:07:46.500 --> 1:07:49.500]  experience normalized blood sugar, mental clarity,
[1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:50.500]  and loss of weight.
[1:07:50.500 --> 1:07:53.500]  It was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water.
[1:07:53.500 --> 1:07:56.500]  But due to modern way of life, most people are overly acidic.
[1:07:56.500 --> 1:07:58.500]  The fact is that disease simply cannot exist
[1:07:58.500 --> 1:08:00.500]  in an alkaline environment.
[1:08:00.500 --> 1:08:02.500]  Fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid
[1:08:02.500 --> 1:08:05.500]  on a regular basis and doesn't neutralize it.
[1:08:05.500 --> 1:08:06.500]  Do your part.
[1:08:06.500 --> 1:08:09.500]  Alkalize and supercharge your body now.
[1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:13.500]  Alcovision plasma pH drops contain a special mineral salt concentrate
[1:08:13.500 --> 1:08:15.500]  that raises the pH of the water you drink
[1:08:15.500 --> 1:08:18.500]  up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.
[1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:21.500]  Order your bottle of Alcovision plasma pH drops now
[1:08:21.500 --> 1:08:24.500]  by going directly to alkavision.com.

[1:08:28.500 --> 1:08:30.500]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[1:08:30.500 --> 1:08:33.500]  probably presents the Alex Jones show
[1:08:33.500 --> 1:08:36.500]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[1:08:39.500 --> 1:08:43.500]  All right, in this segment, I've got a message
[1:08:44.500 --> 1:08:51.500]  for the private, corporate spies, the mercenaries,
[1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:55.500]  the intelligence brigades, a message for the FBI,
[1:08:55.500 --> 1:08:58.500]  a message for the Central Intelligence Agency,
[1:08:58.500 --> 1:09:00.500]  a message to Defense Intelligence,
[1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:05.500]  a message to MI6, MI5, Mossad, German intelligence,
[1:09:05.500 --> 1:09:07.500]  all of these individuals.
[1:09:10.500 --> 1:09:13.500]  This radio show and the quest we've been on
[1:09:13.500 --> 1:09:16.500]  to fight the New World Order has proven itself.
[1:09:16.500 --> 1:09:18.500]  We have proven our case of treason.
[1:09:18.500 --> 1:09:20.500]  We have proven that the government works
[1:09:20.500 --> 1:09:22.500]  for foreign offshore banks and corporations.
[1:09:22.500 --> 1:09:24.500]  We have proven that the banks by design
[1:09:24.500 --> 1:09:26.500]  are imploding the world economy
[1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:28.500]  for a criminal consolidation that will hurt
[1:09:28.500 --> 1:09:32.500]  billions of people and will surely in the third world
[1:09:32.500 --> 1:09:34.500]  cause hundreds of millions more to starve to death.
[1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:37.500]  We have proven they're setting up covertly.
[1:09:37.500 --> 1:09:40.500]  Judicial Watch sued and got the four-year documents
[1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:42.500]  that North American Union is being set up,
[1:09:42.500 --> 1:09:45.500]  that troops will be used on the streets of America
[1:09:45.500 --> 1:09:47.500]  to suppress the population,
[1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:50.500]  that the entire Homeland Security Northcom apparatus
[1:09:50.500 --> 1:09:52.500]  is to suppress the American people.
[1:09:52.500 --> 1:09:56.500]  That's now stated by the Secretary of Defense Gates,
[1:09:56.500 --> 1:09:59.500]  but we told you years ago.
[1:10:01.500 --> 1:10:05.500]  And I know most of you are compartmentalized.
[1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:08.500]  I know most of you are fed disinformation
[1:10:08.500 --> 1:10:12.500]  and carefully crafted propaganda by your superiors.
[1:10:12.500 --> 1:10:15.500]  I know your superiors have staged terror attacks
[1:10:15.500 --> 1:10:18.500]  all over the United States that have been kept quiet
[1:10:18.500 --> 1:10:20.500]  so they can scare you into going along
[1:10:20.500 --> 1:10:23.500]  with this whole covert takeover.
[1:10:23.500 --> 1:10:27.500]  There are hundreds of ways they manipulate you.
[1:10:27.500 --> 1:10:30.500]  And I want to challenge people in the system.
[1:10:30.500 --> 1:10:33.500]  I know most of you are brave soldiers
[1:10:33.500 --> 1:10:36.500]  who fought in many different conflicts,
[1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:40.500]  who have slowly been twisted and slowly been lied to
[1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:43.500]  and slowly been taught that it's okay to be involved
[1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:48.500]  in what is manifestly evil, secret arrest, secret torture.
[1:10:48.500 --> 1:10:50.500]  And I know most of you aren't involved in that,
[1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:54.500]  supporting that overall system.
[1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:56.500]  We have to turn this around.
[1:10:56.500 --> 1:10:58.500]  I mean, when we have foreign banks openly stealing
[1:10:58.500 --> 1:11:03.500]  $8.5 trillion in seven weeks, openly.
[1:11:03.500 --> 1:11:07.500]  And then telling Congress and telling Bloomberg,
[1:11:07.500 --> 1:11:11.500]  the news and others that under national security
[1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:13.500]  this is not going to be released.
[1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:15.500]  When we have the Associated Press reporting
[1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:18.500]  seven and a half years ago on the eve of 9-11,
[1:11:18.500 --> 1:11:22.500]  literally, September 10, that $2 trillion
[1:11:22.500 --> 1:11:25.500]  was stolen out of Pentagon pension funds.
[1:11:25.500 --> 1:11:30.500]  There is no doubt that what the bosses
[1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:32.500]  of the New World Order are doing
[1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:35.500]  and what they're using you to help carry it out
[1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:37.500]  is a crime against humanity
[1:11:37.500 --> 1:11:40.500]  and is the blackest of the black, the darkest of the dark.
[1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:42.500]  There is no denial that the government
[1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:45.500]  is bankrupt morally and financially.
[1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:48.500]  There is no doubt that this is designed.
[1:11:48.500 --> 1:11:51.500]  There is no doubt that you're playing on the wrong side
[1:11:51.500 --> 1:11:56.500]  of the field on this.
[1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:58.500]  And I know that the minority of your enforcers
[1:11:58.500 --> 1:12:01.500]  and technocrats are psychopaths or sociopaths.
[1:12:01.500 --> 1:12:04.500]  Most of you are ideologues.
[1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:07.500]  You have been sold on false political paradigms.
[1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:09.500]  You've been sold on false threats.
[1:12:09.500 --> 1:12:11.500]  You've been taught this Machiavellian view
[1:12:11.500 --> 1:12:13.500]  that the end justifies the means.
[1:12:13.500 --> 1:12:15.500]  You've got to kill 3,000 Americans
[1:12:15.500 --> 1:12:18.500]  as sacrificing a pawn to win the game.
[1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:21.500]  It's for Pax Americana. It's for our future.
[1:12:21.500 --> 1:12:22.500]  No, it's not.
[1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:24.500]  Look at what the very elite are doing right now
[1:12:24.500 --> 1:12:26.500]  is destroying the United States
[1:12:26.500 --> 1:12:28.500]  and the Western world by design.
[1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:30.500]  Look at how they attack the family.
[1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:32.500]  Look at how they attack the Second Amendment.
[1:12:32.500 --> 1:12:34.500]  And I'm not defending those of you
[1:12:34.500 --> 1:12:36.500]  that carried out the attacks
[1:12:36.500 --> 1:12:39.500]  and helped carry them out and then helped cover it up.
[1:12:39.500 --> 1:12:41.500]  Many more of you helped do that
[1:12:41.500 --> 1:12:43.500]  for yourselves and accomplices,
[1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:45.500]  even if it really was for the United States,
[1:12:45.500 --> 1:12:47.500]  even if it was a tribal move
[1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:49.500]  that was for the people of this country,
[1:12:49.500 --> 1:12:51.500]  it is evil and wrong.
[1:12:51.500 --> 1:12:54.500]  But on top of it, it wasn't for us.
[1:12:54.500 --> 1:12:57.500]  And that makes it even worse.
[1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:01.500]  I understand the military mind.
[1:13:01.500 --> 1:13:05.500]  I understand the flag officer level training.
[1:13:05.500 --> 1:13:08.500]  I understand that going back thousands of years ago,
[1:13:08.500 --> 1:13:11.500]  there were thousands of people on stage
[1:13:11.500 --> 1:13:14.500]  massacres and blaming on their enemies.
[1:13:14.500 --> 1:13:16.500]  I understand that false flag
[1:13:16.500 --> 1:13:18.500]  is in the official Army manuals
[1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:20.500]  that we've posted in full
[1:13:20.500 --> 1:13:22.500]  at infowars.com.
[1:13:22.500 --> 1:13:25.500]  And I understand this has been inculcated into the culture.
[1:13:25.500 --> 1:13:28.500]  Now, the military and the government
[1:13:28.500 --> 1:13:32.500]  would not carry out the staged attack in 62
[1:13:32.500 --> 1:13:35.500]  when it was proposed as an operation
[1:13:35.500 --> 1:13:37.500]  that they wanted a green light,
[1:13:37.500 --> 1:13:39.500]  not a theoretical operation,
[1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:43.500]  green light to stage terror attacks,
[1:13:43.500 --> 1:13:47.500]  to shoot Americans in the streets of Miami and D.C.
[1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:49.500]  and Maryland and how to frame Patsy's,
[1:13:49.500 --> 1:13:54.500]  to bomb D.C., to bomb other U.S. cities,
[1:13:54.500 --> 1:13:58.500]  to kill Marines and blame it on foreign enemies.
[1:14:02.500 --> 1:14:04.500]  And that is the journey to evil.
[1:14:04.500 --> 1:14:07.500]  That's how they twisted our military to begin with,
[1:14:07.500 --> 1:14:09.500]  is they would give our military
[1:14:09.500 --> 1:14:11.500]  classified briefings,
[1:14:11.500 --> 1:14:14.500]  showing the fact that Stalin and then Khrushchev
[1:14:14.500 --> 1:14:16.500]  had killed tens of millions of people.
[1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:18.500]  They would say the Red Menace is too dangerous.
[1:14:18.500 --> 1:14:21.500]  We have to stage terror attacks to be able to defeat them.
[1:14:24.500 --> 1:14:26.500]  And then the men say,
[1:14:26.500 --> 1:14:28.500]  yeah, we've got the strong mind, the resolve.
[1:14:28.500 --> 1:14:30.500]  We don't like having to kill Americans,
[1:14:30.500 --> 1:14:32.500]  but we're going to do it
[1:14:32.500 --> 1:14:34.500]  because if we don't kill a few Americans,
[1:14:34.500 --> 1:14:36.500]  the Russians are going to win
[1:14:36.500 --> 1:14:39.500]  and they're going to nuke us or communism will succeed
[1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:41.500]  and then we'll lose our way of life,
[1:14:41.500 --> 1:14:43.500]  and so we've got to do it.
[1:14:43.500 --> 1:14:45.500]  And so they stage the liberty.
[1:14:45.500 --> 1:14:47.500]  They stage the Gulf of Tonkin.
[1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:49.500]  They stage other limited events
[1:14:49.500 --> 1:14:51.500]  listed in a catalog of false flag
[1:14:51.500 --> 1:14:53.500]  in Operation Northwoods and other documents
[1:14:53.500 --> 1:14:55.500]  that have been declassified.
[1:14:55.500 --> 1:14:57.500]  You attacked a highly decorated ship
[1:14:57.500 --> 1:14:59.500]  that is now the most decorated ship.
[1:14:59.500 --> 1:15:03.500]  You killed, what, 33 sailors and injured 100 plus others?
[1:15:05.500 --> 1:15:08.500]  The President ordered the aircraft carriers
[1:15:08.500 --> 1:15:10.500]  to not render aid.
[1:15:10.500 --> 1:15:13.500]  A Russian spy ship arrived
[1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:15.500]  and as the Israeli commandos were getting on deck
[1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:18.500]  to mop up and because the Russians were
[1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:20.500]  filming the whole thing,
[1:15:20.500 --> 1:15:22.500]  they had to peel off and stop.
[1:15:24.500 --> 1:15:26.500]  That's wrong.
[1:15:26.500 --> 1:15:29.500]  Now, it's now part of the record.
[1:15:29.500 --> 1:15:32.500]  It's now been declassified to CIA and KGB files.
[1:15:32.500 --> 1:15:34.500]  New York Times had lined three years ago,
[1:15:34.500 --> 1:15:36.500]  McCarthy was right,
[1:15:36.500 --> 1:15:39.500]  that the communists were put into power
[1:15:39.500 --> 1:15:41.500]  by the United States and British government
[1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:43.500]  in 1917 and 1918,
[1:15:43.500 --> 1:15:45.500]  that the entire time they were secretly being funded
[1:15:45.500 --> 1:15:47.500]  and given the bomb,
[1:15:48.500 --> 1:15:50.500]  that the entire time
[1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:53.500]  that was controlled by the West
[1:15:53.500 --> 1:15:55.500]  and that it was a false threat created
[1:15:55.500 --> 1:15:57.500]  just like al-Qaeda,
[1:15:58.500 --> 1:16:00.500]  but real nevertheless
[1:16:00.500 --> 1:16:02.500]  to twist the West
[1:16:02.500 --> 1:16:04.500]  and to train the military and the government
[1:16:04.500 --> 1:16:06.500]  to go along with this evil.
[1:16:08.500 --> 1:16:11.500]  That's only one example of thousands
[1:16:11.500 --> 1:16:13.500]  of how they twisted you.
[1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:15.500]  And now it's on record.
[1:16:15.500 --> 1:16:17.500]  And as soon as McCarthy found out
[1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:20.500]  that communism was being run by the army
[1:16:20.500 --> 1:16:23.500]  and by John Foster Dulles
[1:16:23.500 --> 1:16:25.500]  and by others,
[1:16:25.500 --> 1:16:27.500]  and as soon as he came out and said
[1:16:27.500 --> 1:16:29.500]  it goes all the way to the top of our government,
[1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:31.500]  he was removed because it isn't communism
[1:16:31.500 --> 1:16:33.500]  as the official CIA historian
[1:16:33.500 --> 1:16:35.500]  contracted to write the book,
[1:16:35.500 --> 1:16:37.500]  Tragedy and Hope,
[1:16:37.500 --> 1:16:39.500]  Dr. Carol Quigley,
[1:16:39.500 --> 1:16:41.500]  the head of Georgetown Political Science,
[1:16:41.500 --> 1:16:43.500]  stated the international banker,
[1:16:43.500 --> 1:16:45.500]  Cartel, which he believed in,
[1:16:45.500 --> 1:16:47.500]  controls fascism and communism,
[1:16:47.500 --> 1:16:49.500]  anything that vertically integrates.
[1:16:49.500 --> 1:16:53.500]  Now here we are all these decades later
[1:16:55.500 --> 1:16:57.500]  and they tell you for our way of life
[1:16:57.500 --> 1:16:59.500]  they're going to stage some terror attacks
[1:16:59.500 --> 1:17:01.500]  and you go along with it
[1:17:01.500 --> 1:17:03.500]  because you believe the end justifies the means.
[1:17:03.500 --> 1:17:05.500]  Now that's some of you.
[1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:07.500]  Many others are just flat out psychopaths
[1:17:07.500 --> 1:17:09.500]  and just don't care and have done so many other operations
[1:17:09.500 --> 1:17:11.500]  and been involved in death squads
[1:17:11.500 --> 1:17:13.500]  and murders and everything else worldwide
[1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:15.500]  that they just think it's fun.
[1:17:15.500 --> 1:17:19.500]  And there's no reaching those people.
[1:17:19.500 --> 1:17:21.500]  Other than telling them
[1:17:21.500 --> 1:17:23.500]  they're putting Florida on your waterpal
[1:17:23.500 --> 1:17:25.500]  they're putting mercury in your vaccines
[1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:27.500]  they're feeding you GMO foods
[1:17:27.500 --> 1:17:29.500]  going to kill you dead in a hammer
[1:17:29.500 --> 1:17:31.500]  and your children dead in a hammer
[1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:33.500]  you're not on the winning team
[1:17:33.500 --> 1:17:35.500]  the elite is going to sell you out as well.
[1:17:35.500 --> 1:17:37.500]  So just from a cold-blooded standpoint
[1:17:37.500 --> 1:17:39.500]  you should join the people
[1:17:39.500 --> 1:17:41.500]  and put the brakes on everything you're doing
[1:17:41.500 --> 1:17:43.500]  because you're not going to come out on top of this
[1:17:43.500 --> 1:17:46.500]  they're going to bury your butts out in the desert
[1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:48.500]  and probably already did bury most of you out in the desert
[1:17:48.500 --> 1:17:50.500]  the ones that carried out 9-11.
[1:17:53.500 --> 1:17:55.500]  And that said, I'm not up here macho
[1:17:55.500 --> 1:17:57.500]  saying bring it on, waving my finger at you.
[1:17:57.500 --> 1:17:59.500]  I know how deadly you are
[1:17:59.500 --> 1:18:01.500]  I know how powerful you are
[1:18:01.500 --> 1:18:03.500]  I know how evil you are
[1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:07.500]  and I know my life's in danger
[1:18:07.500 --> 1:18:09.500]  and this isn't fun for me
[1:18:09.500 --> 1:18:11.500]  but somebody's got to stand up against you
[1:18:11.500 --> 1:18:13.500]  somebody's got to tell you no
[1:18:13.500 --> 1:18:15.500]  somebody's got to tell you to stop
[1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:17.500]  somebody's got to have the will
[1:18:17.500 --> 1:18:19.500]  to face the facts and the data
[1:18:19.500 --> 1:18:21.500]  and bring it out
[1:18:21.500 --> 1:18:23.500]  and the American people are doing that
[1:18:27.500 --> 1:18:29.500]  and to all the military people
[1:18:29.500 --> 1:18:31.500]  that come on our websites and the message boards
[1:18:31.500 --> 1:18:33.500]  and attack us and say there's no world government
[1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:35.500]  and nothing we're saying is true
[1:18:35.500 --> 1:18:37.500]  and Northwoods isn't real, shame on you
[1:18:37.500 --> 1:18:39.500]  you know it's true, you know it's real
[1:18:39.500 --> 1:18:41.500]  you know it's all over the newspapers now
[1:18:41.500 --> 1:18:43.500]  shame on you claiming you did
[1:18:43.500 --> 1:18:45.500]  all this evil for the United States
[1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:47.500]  and then out in the open
[1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:49.500]  they're ending the United States and sucking us dry
[1:18:49.500 --> 1:18:51.500]  on top of it
[1:18:51.500 --> 1:18:53.500]  the truth is
[1:18:53.500 --> 1:18:55.500]  you were brought in, you were broken
[1:18:55.500 --> 1:18:57.500]  you were conditioned, you were corrupted
[1:18:57.500 --> 1:18:59.500]  a thousand different ways
[1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:01.500]  one of the big ones is in Iraq
[1:19:01.500 --> 1:19:03.500]  and Afghanistan

[1:33:16.500 --> 1:33:21.500]  no dark stock has them in the classroom
[1:33:21.500 --> 1:33:26.500]  a process of corruption in the country
[1:33:26.500 --> 1:33:29.500]  the general population
[1:33:29.500 --> 1:33:34.500]  the military, the FBI, the bureaucrats
[1:33:34.500 --> 1:33:37.500]  and the establishment is going to use phony environmentalism
[1:33:37.500 --> 1:33:40.500]  as a pretext to micromanage and rule over our lives
[1:33:40.500 --> 1:33:44.500]  and bring in a form of modern feudalism and serfdom
[1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:47.500]  the other prong and the pincer move
[1:33:47.500 --> 1:33:51.500]  the pincer attack is of course
[1:33:51.500 --> 1:33:55.500]  staged terrorism and provocateur terrorism
[1:33:55.500 --> 1:33:58.500]  I mean take the police in Ottawa
[1:33:58.500 --> 1:34:00.500]  this year caught national news
[1:34:00.500 --> 1:34:02.500]  attacking other police
[1:34:02.500 --> 1:34:04.500]  the people know what to look for now
[1:34:04.500 --> 1:34:06.500]  so they could then attack the peaceful crowd
[1:34:06.500 --> 1:34:08.500]  look at Denver this year
[1:34:08.500 --> 1:34:12.500]  the police caught attacking their own officers
[1:34:12.500 --> 1:34:15.500]  in staged events for the news cameras
[1:34:15.500 --> 1:34:17.500]  is that a good government?
[1:34:17.500 --> 1:34:19.500]  is that a legitimate government?
[1:34:19.500 --> 1:34:22.500]  is that a real government?
[1:34:22.500 --> 1:34:25.500]  and it's not just criminal for the army to be going around
[1:34:25.500 --> 1:34:28.500]  trying to provocateur people into violence
[1:34:28.500 --> 1:34:31.500]  Muslims, 9-11 truthers, you name it
[1:34:34.500 --> 1:34:37.500]  it's illegal to try to get somebody to carry out a crime
[1:34:37.500 --> 1:34:39.500]  a crime of violence
[1:34:39.500 --> 1:34:42.500]  that's more than just a sting, that's more than just entrapment
[1:34:42.500 --> 1:34:46.500]  that is literally engaging and racketeering
[1:34:50.500 --> 1:34:52.500]  any lawyer that tries federal cases will tell you
[1:34:52.500 --> 1:34:54.500]  the feds will bring in 10, 20, 30 witnesses
[1:34:54.500 --> 1:34:56.500]  who never even met you to say
[1:34:56.500 --> 1:34:59.500]  you committed every crime under the sun to put you in jail
[1:34:59.500 --> 1:35:01.500]  that's why more than a third of the people on death row
[1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:04.500]  it's turned out are totally innocent through DNA
[1:35:04.500 --> 1:35:07.500]  it's a bankrupt government
[1:35:07.500 --> 1:35:09.500]  and it doesn't end there
[1:35:09.500 --> 1:35:12.500]  there's the million-plus children grabbed a year by CPS
[1:35:12.500 --> 1:35:15.500]  who's five times more likely to abuse the children
[1:35:15.500 --> 1:35:18.500]  than any other group
[1:35:18.500 --> 1:35:20.500]  and no one's allowed to investigate them
[1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:22.500]  no one's allowed to punish them
[1:35:22.500 --> 1:35:24.500]  these are the crimes that are being committed
[1:35:24.500 --> 1:35:27.500]  this is the corruption-wide system
[1:35:27.500 --> 1:35:30.500]  in this illegitimate government
[1:35:30.500 --> 1:35:33.500]  and you're on the wrong side of history
[1:35:36.500 --> 1:35:38.500]  and I know a lot of you are deep into this now
[1:35:38.500 --> 1:35:40.500]  but you don't know how to get out
[1:35:40.500 --> 1:35:42.500]  the only reason that things aren't a lot worse
[1:35:42.500 --> 1:35:44.500]  is because there are a lot of good people in the military
[1:35:44.500 --> 1:35:45.500]  and high levels
[1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:47.500]  and a lot of good people in the FBI
[1:35:47.500 --> 1:35:49.500]  and a lot of good people in the CIA
[1:35:53.500 --> 1:35:56.500]  but you're being manipulated
[1:35:56.500 --> 1:35:58.500]  and I know that many of us have been on the journey
[1:35:58.500 --> 1:36:00.500]  of being good and decent and honorable
[1:36:00.500 --> 1:36:02.500]  and that'll get you into a scary place confronting evil
[1:36:02.500 --> 1:36:04.500]  but you can't turn back
[1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:06.500]  there's no going back
[1:36:06.500 --> 1:36:09.500]  anyway because even if you're not committed
[1:36:09.500 --> 1:36:11.500]  you're committed
[1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:14.500]  well a lot of you think there's no turning back
[1:36:14.500 --> 1:36:16.500]  because you've been involved in so much evil
[1:36:16.500 --> 1:36:19.500]  you've been corrupted and twisted and turned to the dark side
[1:36:19.500 --> 1:36:21.500]  many of you can still turn back
[1:36:21.500 --> 1:36:24.500]  and you'll find that as you have courage and turn back
[1:36:24.500 --> 1:36:26.500]  and say no
[1:36:26.500 --> 1:36:28.500]  there's going to be others around you
[1:36:28.500 --> 1:36:30.500]  that are going to say I didn't know you felt the same way
[1:36:30.500 --> 1:36:32.500]  I didn't know you were thinking the same thing
[1:36:32.500 --> 1:36:34.500]  and we have a chance of not letting
[1:36:34.500 --> 1:36:36.500]  foreign bankers completely suck the country dry
[1:36:36.500 --> 1:36:39.500]  now 8.5 trillion in seven weeks is bad
[1:36:39.500 --> 1:36:42.500]  but if we bring out the point that this is illegal
[1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:44.500]  this is unlawful
[1:36:44.500 --> 1:36:46.500]  and if we somehow get the Congress to stand up
[1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:48.500]  on its hind legs but you see they're being watched
[1:36:48.500 --> 1:36:50.500]  they're corrupt, the FBI uses dirt on them
[1:36:50.500 --> 1:36:52.500]  to keep them under control
[1:36:52.500 --> 1:36:54.500]  the governor's under control
[1:36:54.500 --> 1:36:56.500]  it's a tough road
[1:36:56.500 --> 1:36:58.500]  but if somehow we can get Congress to realize the people are behind them
[1:36:58.500 --> 1:37:00.500]  and educate them of the public
[1:37:00.500 --> 1:37:02.500]  we can reverse this
[1:37:02.500 --> 1:37:04.500]  especially as the fallout
[1:37:04.500 --> 1:37:07.500]  the aftermath of what's been done financially alone
[1:37:07.500 --> 1:37:09.500]  is learned
[1:37:09.500 --> 1:37:11.500]  is discovered
[1:37:11.500 --> 1:37:13.500]  and that's why we the people have to be there
[1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:15.500]  at infowars.com and prismplanet.com
[1:37:15.500 --> 1:37:18.500]  and all the other sites pointing out how the bankers engineered it
[1:37:18.500 --> 1:37:20.500]  pointing out how they stole the money openly
[1:37:20.500 --> 1:37:23.500]  pointing out how the Federal Reserve is becoming the government
[1:37:23.500 --> 1:37:26.500]  pointing out that Greenspan says they're above the law
[1:37:26.500 --> 1:37:27.500]  on Lair NewsHour
[1:37:27.500 --> 1:37:32.500]  showing people how outrageous this is
[1:37:32.500 --> 1:37:34.500]  I've assessed history
[1:37:34.500 --> 1:37:36.500]  I've assessed movements
[1:37:36.500 --> 1:37:38.500]  I've assessed systems
[1:37:38.500 --> 1:37:41.500]  and the New World Order undoubtedly is going to collapse
[1:37:41.500 --> 1:37:44.500]  the New World Order undoubtedly is already in place
[1:37:44.500 --> 1:37:46.500]  and is already falling apart
[1:37:46.500 --> 1:37:48.500]  and it's death throes
[1:37:48.500 --> 1:37:51.500]  it is going to start huge regional wars
[1:37:51.500 --> 1:37:52.500]  minimum
[1:37:52.500 --> 1:37:54.500]  possibly even World War III
[1:37:54.500 --> 1:37:56.500]  and it's death throes
[1:37:56.500 --> 1:37:58.500]  it will release biological weapons
[1:38:01.500 --> 1:38:03.500]  and it's death throes
[1:38:06.500 --> 1:38:09.500]  unspeakable things are undoubtedly going to happen
[1:38:18.500 --> 1:38:20.500]  and for your moral compass
[1:38:20.500 --> 1:38:21.500]  for your soul
[1:38:21.500 --> 1:38:23.500]  for your family name
[1:38:23.500 --> 1:38:26.500]  for everything you've been in your life
[1:38:26.500 --> 1:38:27.500]  before you turned to evil
[1:38:27.500 --> 1:38:29.500]  before you bought into lies
[1:38:29.500 --> 1:38:31.500]  and power for power's sake
[1:38:31.500 --> 1:38:33.500]  turn back now
[1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:39.500]  you see
[1:38:39.500 --> 1:38:41.500]  once a society gives into corruption
[1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:45.500]  once people decide that corruption is the way to go up the ladder
[1:38:45.500 --> 1:38:47.500]  everything falls apart
[1:38:47.500 --> 1:38:49.500]  everything disintegrates
[1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:51.500]  like Mexico is disintegrating
[1:38:51.500 --> 1:38:53.500]  and North Korea
[1:38:53.500 --> 1:38:55.500]  and Greenland
[1:38:55.500 --> 1:38:57.500]  and Argentina
[1:38:57.500 --> 1:38:59.500]  and that's being set up here
[1:38:59.500 --> 1:39:01.500]  they're admitting that's what the trips are for
[1:39:01.500 --> 1:39:03.500]  but they didn't just set up Homeland Security
[1:39:03.500 --> 1:39:04.500]  and Northcom last week
[1:39:04.500 --> 1:39:06.500]  they set it up decades ago
[1:39:06.500 --> 1:39:08.500]  before you ever even heard of Northcom and Homeland Security
[1:39:08.500 --> 1:39:10.500]  it was in government documents
[1:39:11.500 --> 1:39:13.500]  and they stated it was for
[1:39:13.500 --> 1:39:15.500]  the banker takeover
[1:39:15.500 --> 1:39:17.500]  it was for bringing down the United States
[1:39:17.500 --> 1:39:19.500]  it was for bankrupting everything
[1:39:19.500 --> 1:39:21.500]  so everybody basically dependent on a government check
[1:39:21.500 --> 1:39:23.500]  and lowering our standard of living
[1:39:23.500 --> 1:39:25.500]  this is a horrible thing
[1:39:25.500 --> 1:39:26.500]  you were involved in
[1:39:26.500 --> 1:39:27.500]  those of you in the media
[1:39:27.500 --> 1:39:29.500]  those of you in government
[1:39:29.500 --> 1:39:31.500]  those of you in the enforcement arms
[1:39:31.500 --> 1:39:33.500]  and for those of you in the enforcement arms
[1:39:36.500 --> 1:39:37.500]  it's only going to get darker
[1:39:37.500 --> 1:39:39.500]  it's only going to get more horrible
[1:39:39.500 --> 1:39:40.500]  some of you that aren't pure evil
[1:39:40.500 --> 1:39:41.500]  but that go along with it
[1:39:41.500 --> 1:39:42.500]  who hate your job
[1:39:42.500 --> 1:39:44.500]  that hate what you're involved in
[1:39:44.500 --> 1:39:46.500]  it's only going to get a hundred times worse
[1:39:46.500 --> 1:39:48.500]  if you don't put the brakes on it
[1:39:48.500 --> 1:39:50.500]  and if you don't
[1:39:50.500 --> 1:39:52.500]  turn from the dark side
[1:39:54.500 --> 1:39:56.500]  if you don't refuse
[1:40:00.500 --> 1:40:02.500]  to be part of this
[1:40:06.500 --> 1:40:08.500]  so the choice is
[1:40:08.500 --> 1:40:10.500]  in your hands
[1:40:10.500 --> 1:40:12.500]  but it's not just in those that work for the dark side's hands
[1:40:14.500 --> 1:40:16.500]  it is in the hands of the good
[1:40:16.500 --> 1:40:18.500]  and it is to the good
[1:40:18.500 --> 1:40:19.500]  the decent
[1:40:19.500 --> 1:40:20.500]  the honorable
[1:40:20.500 --> 1:40:21.500]  people that have a moral compass
[1:40:21.500 --> 1:40:22.500]  that understand history
[1:40:22.500 --> 1:40:24.500]  that love their families
[1:40:26.500 --> 1:40:28.500]  it is to us that this will be decided
[1:40:30.500 --> 1:40:32.500]  and that's why all of us have to commit
[1:40:32.500 --> 1:40:34.500]  to work in every way we can
[1:40:34.500 --> 1:40:36.500]  waking up neighbors, friends, family
[1:40:36.500 --> 1:40:38.500]  co-workers, pastors
[1:40:40.500 --> 1:40:42.500]  bringing light into the world
[1:40:43.500 --> 1:40:45.500]  reaching out to our fellow man
[1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:47.500]  putting up blogs
[1:40:47.500 --> 1:40:48.500]  doing access TV shows
[1:40:48.500 --> 1:40:49.500]  starting local radio shows
[1:40:49.500 --> 1:40:50.500]  you don't know how?
[1:40:50.500 --> 1:40:52.500]  investigate, it's easy
[1:40:54.500 --> 1:40:56.500]  and taking the fight to the new world order
[1:40:56.500 --> 1:40:58.500]  in the information war
[1:40:58.500 --> 1:40:59.500]  and never surrendering
[1:40:59.500 --> 1:41:00.500]  and never giving up
[1:41:00.500 --> 1:41:02.500]  because they're losing ground fast
[1:41:02.500 --> 1:41:04.500]  people are waking up exponentially
[1:41:04.500 --> 1:41:06.500]  but many of them aren't taking action
[1:41:06.500 --> 1:41:08.500]  knowledge without action
[1:41:08.500 --> 1:41:10.500]  knowledge without deed
[1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:11.500]  is empty
[1:41:11.500 --> 1:41:13.500]  I'm not perfect
[1:41:17.500 --> 1:41:19.500]  but look at what I've been able to do
[1:41:19.500 --> 1:41:21.500]  joining together with other like-minded people
[1:41:21.500 --> 1:41:22.500]  around the world
[1:41:22.500 --> 1:41:24.500]  look at the effect we've had
[1:41:24.500 --> 1:41:26.500]  look at how much we've slowed down the new world order
[1:41:28.500 --> 1:41:30.500]  and everything we talked about has come true
[1:41:30.500 --> 1:41:32.500]  everything we warned people about is unfolding
[1:41:32.500 --> 1:41:34.500]  now our credibility is at all time high
[1:41:34.500 --> 1:41:36.500]  and now is the time to go out
[1:41:36.500 --> 1:41:38.500]  and wake the people up
[1:41:38.500 --> 1:41:40.500]  as we enter the phase of greatest danger
[1:41:40.500 --> 1:41:42.500]  to liberty and freedom
[1:41:42.500 --> 1:41:44.500]  and just life itself
[1:41:47.500 --> 1:41:48.500]  in closing on the subject
[1:41:48.500 --> 1:41:50.500]  and I want to get into the economy some
[1:41:52.500 --> 1:41:53.500]  in closing
[1:41:56.500 --> 1:41:58.500]  there are hundreds of declassified examples
[1:41:58.500 --> 1:42:00.500]  of western government staging terror attacks
[1:42:00.500 --> 1:42:02.500]  that are completely declassified
[1:42:04.500 --> 1:42:06.500]  and it's admitted
[1:42:06.500 --> 1:42:08.500]  in the BBC and under publications that in 2000
[1:42:08.500 --> 1:42:10.500]  they just were admitted in plain view
[1:42:10.500 --> 1:42:12.500]  that it was the government
[1:42:12.500 --> 1:42:14.500]  that it cites all over
[1:42:14.500 --> 1:42:16.500]  Scotland and England itself
[1:42:18.500 --> 1:42:20.500]  on the whole of the island
[1:42:21.500 --> 1:42:23.500]  the government from port and down
[1:42:23.500 --> 1:42:25.500]  went out and gave weaponized foot and mouth
[1:42:25.500 --> 1:42:27.500]  to the cows
[1:42:27.500 --> 1:42:29.500]  and then they killed millions of them
[1:42:29.500 --> 1:42:31.500]  and took over and bankrupted many of the farms
[1:42:32.500 --> 1:42:34.500]  that's just one of
[1:42:34.500 --> 1:42:36.500]  hundreds of biological examples
[1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:38.500]  they're setting up 36 level 4
[1:42:38.500 --> 1:42:40.500]  bioweapons labs
[1:42:40.500 --> 1:42:42.500]  in Texas and Kansas and New York
[1:42:42.500 --> 1:42:44.500]  they're moving them from underground facilities
[1:42:44.500 --> 1:42:46.500]  in the desert or on islands like Plum Island
[1:42:46.500 --> 1:42:48.500]  and they're moving them into major cities
[1:42:48.500 --> 1:42:50.500]  the globalists admittedly plan
[1:42:50.500 --> 1:42:52.500]  to have controlled bioweapons releases
[1:42:52.500 --> 1:42:54.500]  they plan to do hellish
[1:42:54.500 --> 1:42:56.500]  horrible things
[1:42:56.500 --> 1:42:58.500]  and those of you in government cannot
[1:42:58.500 --> 1:43:00.500]  deny this anymore
[1:43:00.500 --> 1:43:06.500]  those of you in government cannot deny
[1:43:06.500 --> 1:43:08.500]  that cancer viruses
[1:43:08.500 --> 1:43:10.500]  are still put in the polio vaccine
[1:43:10.500 --> 1:43:12.500]  and were put in there
[1:43:12.500 --> 1:43:14.500]  and that the inventor of the polio vaccine
[1:43:14.500 --> 1:43:16.500]  brags on tape and laughs about it on CBC
[1:43:16.500 --> 1:43:18.500]  this is disgusting
[1:43:20.500 --> 1:43:22.500]  I mean you may be
[1:43:22.500 --> 1:43:24.500]  into being tough and you know you see
[1:43:24.500 --> 1:43:26.500]  people die from cluster bombs
[1:43:26.500 --> 1:43:28.500]  and you've killed families decades ago
[1:43:28.500 --> 1:43:30.500]  you don't care anymore
[1:43:30.500 --> 1:43:32.500]  but I mean do you really want to be part
[1:43:32.500 --> 1:43:34.500]  of killing Americans and others children
[1:43:34.500 --> 1:43:36.500]  do you really want to be part
[1:43:36.500 --> 1:43:38.500]  of all of this eugenics and bioweapons releases
[1:43:38.500 --> 1:43:40.500]  on the American people
[1:43:40.500 --> 1:43:42.500]  do you really want to sign your name forever
[1:43:42.500 --> 1:43:44.500]  on to all of this
[1:43:44.500 --> 1:43:46.500]  do you really want to be part of it
[1:43:46.500 --> 1:43:48.500]  you know I'm not
[1:43:48.500 --> 1:43:50.500]  upset with the decisions I've made
[1:43:50.500 --> 1:43:52.500]  I'm proud of the decisions I've made
[1:43:52.500 --> 1:43:54.500]  in my life to fight evil
[1:43:54.500 --> 1:43:56.500]  but at the same time it is
[1:43:56.500 --> 1:43:58.500]  to realize just exactly what I'm facing
[1:43:58.500 --> 1:44:00.500]  but even if I didn't fight
[1:44:00.500 --> 1:44:02.500]  it I'd still be in the world
[1:44:02.500 --> 1:44:04.500]  I'd still be facing these people
[1:44:04.500 --> 1:44:06.500]  they'd still be attacking me and my family
[1:44:06.500 --> 1:44:08.500]  and so I'm walking point I'm out in the front
[1:44:08.500 --> 1:44:10.500]  trusting in God
[1:44:10.500 --> 1:44:12.500]  that I'll be able to continue my work
[1:44:12.500 --> 1:44:14.500]  without being set up or killed
[1:44:14.500 --> 1:44:16.500]  or all the things I'm being threatened with
[1:44:16.500 --> 1:44:18.500]  my wife, my family being threatened
[1:44:18.500 --> 1:44:20.500]  I've made a lot of sacrifices
[1:44:22.500 --> 1:44:24.500]  but in the end they aren't sacrifices
[1:44:24.500 --> 1:44:26.500]  what else was I supposed to do
[1:44:28.500 --> 1:44:30.500]  I'm just a normal male
[1:44:30.500 --> 1:44:32.500]  what does a normal headscrewed
[1:44:32.500 --> 1:44:34.500]  on straight male do when he finds out
[1:44:34.500 --> 1:44:36.500]  there's an evil elite
[1:44:36.500 --> 1:44:38.500]  when he finds out there's a corrupt new world order
[1:44:38.500 --> 1:44:40.500]  when he finds out his liberties
[1:44:40.500 --> 1:44:42.500]  and his freedoms and his heritage are being destroyed
[1:44:42.500 --> 1:44:44.500]  when he finds out
[1:44:44.500 --> 1:44:46.500]  that they're
[1:44:46.500 --> 1:44:48.500]  destroying everything good
[1:44:48.500 --> 1:44:50.500]  and erecting evil in its place
[1:44:50.500 --> 1:44:52.500]  what are we supposed to do
[1:44:52.500 --> 1:44:54.500]  what am I supposed to do
[1:44:56.500 --> 1:44:58.500]  even if you won't fight evil
[1:44:58.500 --> 1:45:00.500]  you might as well not help it
[1:45:00.500 --> 1:45:02.500]  you might as well not cheerlead it
[1:45:02.500 --> 1:45:04.500]  and love it
[1:45:10.500 --> 1:45:12.500]  I've spent 45 minutes here
[1:45:12.500 --> 1:45:14.500]  speaking to the establishment
[1:45:14.500 --> 1:45:16.500]  speaking to the new world order
[1:45:16.500 --> 1:45:22.500]  speaking to their minions and enforcers
[1:45:22.500 --> 1:45:24.500]  you can't deny, you can't rationalize
[1:45:24.500 --> 1:45:26.500]  what you're part of anymore
[1:45:26.500 --> 1:45:28.500]  it is world government
[1:45:28.500 --> 1:45:30.500]  it is a tyrannical world government
[1:45:30.500 --> 1:45:32.500]  they've got their talking heads
[1:45:32.500 --> 1:45:34.500]  they've got their proxies
[1:45:34.500 --> 1:45:36.500]  they've got their operatives
[1:45:36.500 --> 1:45:38.500]  in hundreds of newspapers every week
[1:45:38.500 --> 1:45:40.500]  saying world governments the answer
[1:45:40.500 --> 1:45:42.500]  world governments the solution to the environment
[1:45:42.500 --> 1:45:44.500]  to the economic control crisis
[1:45:44.500 --> 1:45:46.500]  to the wars, to terrorism
[1:45:46.500 --> 1:45:48.500]  how many years did we tell you
[1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:50.500]  they would stage all of these things
[1:45:50.500 --> 1:45:52.500]  and then say world government was the answer
[1:45:52.500 --> 1:45:54.500]  and then say that the private banks
[1:45:54.500 --> 1:45:56.500]  are going to make up the world government
[1:45:56.500 --> 1:45:58.500]  and that you're going to pay your taxes to them
[1:45:58.500 --> 1:46:00.500]  and now they're rolling it out
[1:46:00.500 --> 1:46:02.500]  now they're doing it
[1:46:02.500 --> 1:46:04.500]  now we're entering the final phase
[1:46:04.500 --> 1:46:06.500]  and ladies and gentlemen
[1:46:06.500 --> 1:46:08.500]  the final phase is a controlled
[1:46:08.500 --> 1:46:10.500]  sustained never ending world depression
[1:46:10.500 --> 1:46:12.500]  with the currencies being devalued
[1:46:12.500 --> 1:46:14.500]  and the public being forced to take world ID cards
[1:46:14.500 --> 1:46:16.500]  and anyone in security positions
[1:46:16.500 --> 1:46:18.500]  being forced to take implantable microchips
[1:46:18.500 --> 1:46:20.500]  and forced inoculations
[1:46:22.500 --> 1:46:24.500]  they've spent decades
[1:46:24.500 --> 1:46:26.500]  setting up infra-guard
[1:46:26.500 --> 1:46:28.500]  and the clergy response teams
[1:46:28.500 --> 1:46:30.500]  to sell the public on to going into bondage
[1:46:30.500 --> 1:46:32.500]  they've spent decades building the FEMA camps
[1:46:32.500 --> 1:46:34.500]  they've spent decades
[1:46:34.500 --> 1:46:36.500]  preparing the public in Hollywood
[1:46:36.500 --> 1:46:38.500]  and through messages in the media
[1:46:38.500 --> 1:46:40.500]  this is the darkest road we're going down
[1:46:40.500 --> 1:46:42.500]  the most horrible, horrific
[1:46:42.500 --> 1:46:44.500]  can't you smell the stench coming out of the black pit
[1:46:44.500 --> 1:46:46.500]  we're being lowered down into
[1:46:46.500 --> 1:46:48.500]  an elevator straight into hell
[1:46:50.500 --> 1:46:52.500]  where the psychopaths of the new world order
[1:46:52.500 --> 1:46:54.500]  will be able to have their way with us
[1:46:56.500 --> 1:46:58.500]  with lots of mindless new recruits
[1:47:00.500 --> 1:47:02.500]  being brought in on power trips
[1:47:02.500 --> 1:47:04.500]  to have their way with the people
[1:47:04.500 --> 1:47:06.500]  true warriors for liberty
[1:47:06.500 --> 1:47:08.500]  don't want conflict
[1:47:08.500 --> 1:47:10.500]  and they're doing everything they can
[1:47:10.500 --> 1:47:12.500]  to try to reverse this
[1:47:12.500 --> 1:47:14.500]  because they know it won't hurt the new world order
[1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:16.500]  to have thousands of firefights
[1:47:16.500 --> 1:47:18.500]  with police and the military
[1:47:18.500 --> 1:47:20.500]  fights you're going to lose by attrition
[1:47:20.500 --> 1:47:22.500]  the veneer of civilization
[1:47:22.500 --> 1:47:24.500]  already peeling away
[1:47:24.500 --> 1:47:26.500]  as the riots already began
[1:47:26.500 --> 1:47:28.500]  in the United States
[1:47:28.500 --> 1:47:30.500]  as the senator
[1:47:30.500 --> 1:47:32.500]  who was the leader
[1:47:32.500 --> 1:47:34.500]  of the senator
[1:47:34.500 --> 1:47:36.500]  stated
[1:47:36.500 --> 1:47:38.500]  Jim Dement
[1:47:38.500 --> 1:47:40.500]  from South Carolina
[1:47:42.500 --> 1:47:44.500]  this doesn't have to happen
[1:47:44.500 --> 1:47:46.500]  we don't have to have
[1:47:46.500 --> 1:47:48.500]  World War 3
[1:47:48.500 --> 1:47:50.500]  it didn't have to happen in 61 and 62
[1:47:50.500 --> 1:47:52.500]  it didn't have to happen when they
[1:47:52.500 --> 1:47:54.500]  snuck attack the Russians on 888
[1:47:54.500 --> 1:47:56.500]  a few months ago
[1:47:56.500 --> 1:47:58.500]  it doesn't have to happen now
[1:47:58.500 --> 1:48:00.500]  we can turn
[1:48:00.500 --> 1:48:02.500]  this around together
[1:48:04.500 --> 1:48:06.500]  but it's going to take the general public
[1:48:06.500 --> 1:48:08.500]  to get out of denial
[1:48:08.500 --> 1:48:10.500]  and to face just how adverse the situation is
[1:48:10.500 --> 1:48:12.500]  it's going to take those of you that are already active
[1:48:12.500 --> 1:48:14.500]  in the InfoWord to redouble
[1:48:14.500 --> 1:48:16.500]  and then redouble again your efforts
[1:48:16.500 --> 1:48:18.500]  to wake people up and carry the ball
[1:48:18.500 --> 1:48:20.500]  against tyranny
[1:48:20.500 --> 1:48:22.500]  it's going to take
[1:48:22.500 --> 1:48:24.500]  having courage
[1:48:24.500 --> 1:48:26.500]  and not carrying what your boss
[1:48:26.500 --> 1:48:28.500]  or your neighbors or your employees
[1:48:28.500 --> 1:48:30.500]  think
[1:48:30.500 --> 1:48:32.500]  it's going to take aggressive action
[1:48:32.500 --> 1:48:34.500]  like buying a DVD burner
[1:48:34.500 --> 1:48:36.500]  and making 500 copies
[1:48:36.500 --> 1:48:38.500]  in your garage of Terror Storm
[1:48:38.500 --> 1:48:40.500]  or Endgame or Truth Rising
[1:48:40.500 --> 1:48:42.500]  and giving it to your whole church
[1:48:42.500 --> 1:48:44.500]  it's going to take
[1:48:44.500 --> 1:48:46.500]  talking to people you know in the military
[1:48:46.500 --> 1:48:48.500]  about what's happening
[1:48:48.500 --> 1:48:50.500]  it's going to take a grassroots
[1:48:50.500 --> 1:48:52.500]  uprising in the information war
[1:48:52.500 --> 1:48:54.500]  to back off the New World Order
[1:48:54.500 --> 1:48:56.500]  and avert this or if they go ahead with it
[1:48:56.500 --> 1:48:58.500]  we'll then have enough people awake
[1:48:58.500 --> 1:49:00.500]  because once this stuff
[1:49:00.500 --> 1:49:02.500]  the hammer really drops, you think it's dropped so far
[1:49:02.500 --> 1:49:04.500]  it hadn't even started
[1:49:04.500 --> 1:49:06.500]  then as everything we said unfolds
[1:49:06.500 --> 1:49:08.500]  as it already has
[1:49:08.500 --> 1:49:10.500]  but even more so
[1:49:10.500 --> 1:49:12.500]  then people that laughed
[1:49:12.500 --> 1:49:14.500]  they will be listening
[1:49:14.500 --> 1:49:16.500]  and then we've got a good fighting chance inside of this thing
[1:49:16.500 --> 1:49:18.500]  to beat it
[1:49:18.500 --> 1:49:20.500]  I don't want my life
[1:49:20.500 --> 1:49:22.500]  to be for nothing
[1:49:22.500 --> 1:49:24.500]  and I don't want all those other great patriots
[1:49:24.500 --> 1:49:26.500]  right through to today
[1:49:26.500 --> 1:49:28.500]  and those that did stand up for liberty
[1:49:28.500 --> 1:49:30.500]  and decency and honor to be for naught
[1:49:30.500 --> 1:49:32.500]  I don't want the Republic to fall
[1:49:32.500 --> 1:49:34.500]  to a bunch of foreign bankers
[1:49:34.500 --> 1:49:36.500]  who think so little of us they openly steal
[1:49:36.500 --> 1:49:38.500]  8.5 trillion in our faces
[1:49:38.500 --> 1:49:40.500]  and I want the people to get prepared
[1:49:40.500 --> 1:49:42.500]  I want the people
[1:49:42.500 --> 1:49:44.500]  to plan
[1:49:46.500 --> 1:49:48.500]  for really bad things to happen
[1:49:48.500 --> 1:49:50.500]  but to get out and work now to try to avert that
[1:49:50.500 --> 1:49:52.500]  hope for the best
[1:49:52.500 --> 1:49:54.500]  prepare for the worst
[1:49:54.500 --> 1:49:56.500]  and I want
[1:49:56.500 --> 1:49:58.500]  the new world order servants who are wicked
[1:49:58.500 --> 1:50:00.500]  and look forward to all of this evil
[1:50:00.500 --> 1:50:02.500]  that minority of you out there
[1:50:02.500 --> 1:50:04.500]  to know
[1:50:04.500 --> 1:50:06.500]  that you are going to be defeated
[1:50:06.500 --> 1:50:08.500]  and I want our listeners to understand
[1:50:08.500 --> 1:50:10.500]  that we call up somebody like Rothkopf
[1:50:10.500 --> 1:50:12.500]  the head of the Kissinger group
[1:50:12.500 --> 1:50:14.500]  to have him on as a guest as he writes a book about admitting there's a world government
[1:50:14.500 --> 1:50:16.500]  and we call him up and we go
[1:50:16.500 --> 1:50:18.500]  oh we know who you are and who Alex Jones is
[1:50:18.500 --> 1:50:20.500]  yeah I'll come on
[1:50:20.500 --> 1:50:22.500]  show yeah we all know about Alex Jones
[1:50:22.500 --> 1:50:24.500]  again another example
[1:50:24.500 --> 1:50:26.500]  the enemy knows who we are
[1:50:26.500 --> 1:50:28.500]  the enemy is aware of us
[1:50:28.500 --> 1:50:30.500]  the enemy is concerned
[1:50:30.500 --> 1:50:32.500]  the enemy is worried just about
[1:50:32.500 --> 1:50:34.500]  the work I'm doing with you
[1:50:34.500 --> 1:50:36.500]  showing
[1:50:36.500 --> 1:50:38.500]  showing that we're affecting things
[1:50:38.500 --> 1:50:40.500]  that they're having to counter us
[1:50:40.500 --> 1:50:42.500]  they're having to dispatch their people to try to counter us
[1:50:42.500 --> 1:50:44.500]  but it's a catch-22 form because
[1:50:44.500 --> 1:50:46.500]  their system is now coming out to the open
[1:50:46.500 --> 1:50:48.500]  and they lied and said it didn't exist
[1:50:48.500 --> 1:50:50.500]  so they admit it exists
[1:50:50.500 --> 1:50:52.500]  we'll come back into the economy
[1:50:52.500 --> 1:51:18.500]  FACE 1 of the Insiders Plan for a one-world government has been initiated with the recent bailout. International bankers and power brokers have engineered the current crisis to create a new currency and a new world bank to act as saviour. But we've only seen the beginning. Their next engineered crisis will be on a scale never before seen in modern times.
[1:51:18.500 --> 1:51:22.500]  The insiders have discovered that they must control two things to cease total power
[1:51:22.500 --> 1:51:24.500]  FACE 1 is a one-world currency
[1:51:24.500 --> 1:51:26.500]  which we are currently being prepared to accept
[1:51:26.500 --> 1:51:28.500]  FACE 2 of their insidious plan
[1:51:28.500 --> 1:51:30.500]  is complete control of our food supplies

[1:52:02.500 --> 1:52:04.500]  along with hundreds of my fellow troops
[1:52:04.500 --> 1:52:06.500]  I went to grounds here
[1:52:06.500 --> 1:52:08.500]  and we knew what to do
[1:52:08.500 --> 1:52:10.500]  or at least we thought we did
[1:52:10.500 --> 1:52:12.500]  break through 9-11 film
[1:52:12.500 --> 1:52:14.500]  that finally gives first responders a platform

[1:52:22.500 --> 1:52:24.500]  that the air
[1:52:24.500 --> 1:52:26.500]  was safe to breathe
[1:52:26.500 --> 1:52:28.500]  this film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth

[1:52:36.500 --> 1:52:38.500]  he takes his hand off and you hear it
[1:52:38.500 --> 1:52:40.500]  and it was boom boom boom boom boom

[1:52:54.500 --> 1:52:56.500]  they're going to commit more acts
[1:52:56.500 --> 1:52:58.500]  and bring in martial law
[1:53:00.500 --> 1:53:02.500]  now that the election is over
[1:53:02.500 --> 1:53:04.500]  and the shock is beginning to wear off

[1:54:22.500 --> 1:54:24.500]  Ted Anderson

[1:54:30.500 --> 1:54:32.500]  at 740
[1:54:32.500 --> 1:54:34.500]  for the now close to $60
[1:54:34.500 --> 1:54:36.500]  more than $60
[1:54:36.500 --> 1:54:38.500]  close to $80
[1:54:38.500 --> 1:54:40.500]  above what it was
[1:54:40.500 --> 1:54:42.500]  I'm going to spend this segment
[1:54:42.500 --> 1:54:44.500]  and part of the next
[1:54:44.500 --> 1:54:46.500]  then we've got Richard Gage joining us
[1:54:46.500 --> 1:54:48.500]  architects and engineers 9-11
[1:54:48.500 --> 1:54:50.500]  talking to Jim Newcomer
[1:54:50.500 --> 1:54:52.500]  he's the chief broker there
[1:54:52.500 --> 1:54:54.500]  at minus resources under Ted Anderson
[1:54:54.500 --> 1:54:56.500]  and Jim's got a great political brain
[1:54:56.500 --> 1:54:58.500]  and economic mind
[1:54:58.500 --> 1:55:00.500]  I wanted to get his take on what's happening
[1:55:00.500 --> 1:55:02.500]  he's got a BA in business and finance
[1:55:02.500 --> 1:55:04.500]  over 30 years in sales and management
[1:55:04.500 --> 1:55:06.500]  with minus resources for many years
[1:55:06.500 --> 1:55:08.500]  and we really appreciate
[1:55:08.500 --> 1:55:10.500]  him coming
[1:55:10.500 --> 1:55:12.500]  on the show
[1:55:12.500 --> 1:55:14.500]  I wanted the listeners to know just briefly
[1:55:14.500 --> 1:55:16.500]  the gold offer today
[1:55:16.500 --> 1:55:18.500]  do this a few days a week
[1:55:18.500 --> 1:55:20.500]  we told people we had limited
[1:55:20.500 --> 1:55:22.500]  buffaloes that nobody can get
[1:55:22.500 --> 1:55:24.500]  it's very hard to get these
[1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:26.500]  at an incredibly low price
[1:55:26.500 --> 1:55:28.500]  these things are selling for 30-40% premiums
[1:55:28.500 --> 1:55:30.500]  there's basically no premium on this
[1:55:30.500 --> 1:55:32.500]  just a tiny markup
[1:55:32.500 --> 1:55:34.500]  about 4%
[1:55:34.500 --> 1:55:36.500]  just to pay for the transaction
[1:55:36.500 --> 1:55:38.500]  they have these
[1:55:38.500 --> 1:55:40.500]  right now ladies and gentlemen
[1:55:40.500 --> 1:55:42.500]  they have a limited number left
[1:55:42.500 --> 1:55:44.500]  because I said limited number the other day
[1:55:44.500 --> 1:55:46.500]  nobody called to get them
[1:55:46.500 --> 1:55:48.500]  there's 35 of these left
[1:55:48.500 --> 1:55:50.500]  there were 40 there's 35 of those left
[1:55:50.500 --> 1:55:52.500]  they will go quickly
[1:55:52.500 --> 1:55:54.500]  and that's
[1:55:54.500 --> 1:55:56.500]  $1036 gold
[1:55:56.500 --> 1:55:58.500]  billion proof slab MS70
[1:55:58.500 --> 1:56:00.500]  in GC the buffaloes
[1:56:00.500 --> 1:56:02.500]  and then the best deals of course
[1:56:02.500 --> 1:56:04.500]  are the
[1:56:04.500 --> 1:56:06.500]  $168 a roll for the walking half
[1:56:06.500 --> 1:56:08.500]  silver roll of 20 coins
[1:56:08.500 --> 1:56:10.500]  that's what silver weigh up
[1:56:10.500 --> 1:56:12.500]  again they got this golden silver
[1:56:12.500 --> 1:56:14.500]  at much lower prices
[1:56:14.500 --> 1:56:16.500]  than a half ago
[1:56:16.500 --> 1:56:18.500]  I guess now about two weeks ago
[1:56:18.500 --> 1:56:20.500]  they've got British sovereigns
[1:56:20.500 --> 1:56:22.500]  at $242
[1:56:22.500 --> 1:56:24.500]  $195
[1:56:24.500 --> 1:56:26.500]  French or Swiss 20 franc coin
[1:56:26.500 --> 1:56:28.500]  those are
[1:56:28.500 --> 1:56:30.500]  the overall best deal
[1:56:30.500 --> 1:56:32.500]  for gold ounce for ounce
[1:56:32.500 --> 1:56:34.500]  the British sovereign and the French or Swiss 20 franc
[1:56:34.500 --> 1:56:36.500]  they have it available right now
[1:56:36.500 --> 1:56:38.500]  at Midas Resources and this is throughout Sunday
[1:56:38.500 --> 1:56:40.500]  and then that's the end of the deal
[1:56:40.500 --> 1:56:42.500]  and they had about 5 or 6 other coins
[1:56:42.500 --> 1:56:44.500]  Monday those are all gone
[1:56:44.500 --> 1:56:46.500]  at this price you can still get them for a good deal
[1:56:46.500 --> 1:56:48.500]  tell them it's the radio special
[1:56:48.500 --> 1:56:50.500]  800-686-2237
[1:56:50.500 --> 1:56:52.500]  800-686-2237
[1:56:52.500 --> 1:56:54.500]  and
[1:56:54.500 --> 1:56:56.500]  I will tell you that Ted said do this deal
[1:56:56.500 --> 1:56:58.500]  some of the folks don't even want him to do it
[1:56:58.500 --> 1:57:00.500]  because it's ridiculous
[1:57:00.500 --> 1:57:02.500]  you won't find a deal like this
[1:57:02.500 --> 1:57:04.500]  anywhere else
[1:57:04.500 --> 1:57:06.500]  800-686-2237
[1:57:06.500 --> 1:57:08.500]  and we now
[1:57:08.500 --> 1:57:10.500]  go to Jim Newcomer for this segment
[1:57:10.500 --> 1:57:12.500]  the next
[1:57:12.500 --> 1:57:14.500]  Jim have you ever seen a market like this
[1:57:14.500 --> 1:57:16.500]  of just everything that's happening
[1:57:16.500 --> 1:57:18.500]  it's been absolutely crazy Alex
[1:57:18.500 --> 1:57:20.500]  we have oil going down
[1:57:20.500 --> 1:57:22.500]  normally gold the precious metals
[1:57:22.500 --> 1:57:24.500]  and the petroleum move in tandem
[1:57:24.500 --> 1:57:26.500]  we have oil dropping down 66% from the high
[1:57:26.500 --> 1:57:28.500]  and we still have the precious metals on the rise
[1:57:28.500 --> 1:57:30.500]  and increasing
[1:57:30.500 --> 1:57:32.500]  the demand out there has been just unbelievable
[1:57:32.500 --> 1:57:34.500]  it's getting to the point where it's difficult
[1:57:34.500 --> 1:57:36.500]  to find a lot of these coins right now
[1:57:36.500 --> 1:57:38.500]  and you had mentioned the proof slab coins
[1:57:38.500 --> 1:57:40.500]  those MS70
[1:57:40.500 --> 1:57:42.500]  or proof 70 modern $5
[1:57:42.500 --> 1:57:44.500]  modern coins they're selling
[1:57:44.500 --> 1:57:46.500]  I don't know how Ted gets these things
[1:57:46.500 --> 1:57:48.500]  he's had these now for about a month
[1:57:48.500 --> 1:57:50.500]  we do have these in the vault
[1:57:50.500 --> 1:57:52.500]  they're selling for the same price as a $5
[1:57:52.500 --> 1:57:54.500]  Liberty in a VF condition
[1:57:54.500 --> 1:57:56.500]  and these are in the most pristine the best condition
[1:57:56.500 --> 1:57:58.500]  you can buy
[1:57:58.500 --> 1:58:00.500]  they are NGC certified
[1:58:00.500 --> 1:58:02.500]  at MS70 proof coins
[1:58:02.500 --> 1:58:04.500]  so if there's somebody looking for
[1:58:04.500 --> 1:58:06.500]  precious metals for Christmas or something
[1:58:06.500 --> 1:58:08.500]  we'll get that out to them in time
[1:58:08.500 --> 1:58:10.500]  for the original Christmas present
[1:58:10.500 --> 1:58:12.500]  so
[1:58:12.500 --> 1:58:14.500]  but you're absolutely right
[1:58:14.500 --> 1:58:16.500]  with the economy going south
[1:58:16.500 --> 1:58:18.500]  the way that it is
[1:58:18.500 --> 1:58:20.500]  the money that our governments are using
[1:58:20.500 --> 1:58:22.500]  and giving away
[1:58:22.500 --> 1:58:24.500]  literally giving away and the devaluation of the dollar
[1:58:24.500 --> 1:58:26.500]  and the currencies worldwide
[1:58:26.500 --> 1:58:28.500]  these precious metals can do nothing
[1:58:28.500 --> 1:58:30.500]  but increase in value
[1:58:30.500 --> 1:58:32.500]  Jim Newcomer stay there back in 70 seconds

[1:58:50.500 --> 1:58:52.500]  a day unlike any other
[1:58:52.500 --> 1:58:54.500]  in the long course of American history
[1:58:54.500 --> 1:58:56.500]  a terrorist act of war
[1:58:56.500 --> 1:58:58.500]  against this country
[1:58:58.500 --> 1:59:00.500]  the enemies start America on September 11th
[1:59:00.500 --> 1:59:02.500]  but who is the enemy
[1:59:02.500 --> 1:59:04.500]  bin Laden
[1:59:04.500 --> 1:59:06.500]  we have to look to the Middle East
[1:59:06.500 --> 1:59:08.500]  we have to look to Osama bin Laden
[1:59:08.500 --> 1:59:10.500]  fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film
[1:59:10.500 --> 1:59:12.500]  to take a close look at the terrorist ties
[1:59:12.500 --> 1:59:14.500]  to intelligence networks inside the United States
[1:59:14.500 --> 1:59:16.500]  some US investigators believe
[1:59:16.500 --> 1:59:18.500]  that there are Israelis again very much
[1:59:18.500 --> 1:59:20.500]  engaged in spying in and on
[1:59:20.500 --> 1:59:22.500]  the US
[1:59:22.500 --> 1:59:24.500]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens
[1:59:24.500 --> 1:59:26.500]  have been detained
[1:59:26.500 --> 1:59:28.500]  bin Laden's connections to the CIA
[1:59:28.500 --> 1:59:30.500]  the hijackers ties to the FBI
[1:59:30.500 --> 1:59:32.500]  the Israeli intelligence network
[1:59:32.500 --> 1:59:34.500]  warnings and war games
[1:59:34.500 --> 1:59:36.500]  the shadow government and much much more

[1:59:48.500 --> 2:00:00.500]  Waging war on corruption
[2:00:00.500 --> 2:00:20.500]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[2:00:20.500 --> 2:00:34.500]  news
[2:00:34.500 --> 2:00:36.500]  we are going to have just a
[2:00:36.500 --> 2:00:38.500]  super guest on Bob Chapman
[2:00:38.500 --> 2:00:40.500]  finishing up with Jim at Newcomer
[2:00:40.500 --> 2:00:42.500]  a long time I might as a broker
[2:00:42.500 --> 2:00:44.500]  head broker there
[2:00:44.500 --> 2:00:46.500]  Jim
[2:00:46.500 --> 2:00:48.500]  the magnitude of them saying
[2:00:48.500 --> 2:00:50.500]  I read the bill
[2:00:50.500 --> 2:00:52.500]  it said it will all be secret
[2:00:52.500 --> 2:00:54.500]  then the foreign owned Federal Reserve
[2:00:54.500 --> 2:00:56.500]  steals 8.5 trillion
[2:00:56.500 --> 2:00:58.500]  and the lawsuit with Bloomberg
[2:00:58.500 --> 2:01:00.500]  the federal government says
[2:01:00.500 --> 2:01:02.500]  the Federal Reserve is private
[2:01:02.500 --> 2:01:04.500]  they don't have to tell you
[2:01:04.500 --> 2:01:06.500]  this spells curtains for the dollar
[2:01:06.500 --> 2:01:08.500]  people had better move into gold
[2:01:08.500 --> 2:01:10.500]  I agree 100%
[2:01:10.500 --> 2:01:12.500]  these people have never been transparent
[2:01:12.500 --> 2:01:14.500]  they never will be
[2:01:14.500 --> 2:01:16.500]  since the creation of the banking system
[2:01:16.500 --> 2:01:18.500]  they are there to make money
[2:01:18.500 --> 2:01:20.500]  with our money
[2:01:20.500 --> 2:01:22.500]  the precious metals are the only thing
[2:01:22.500 --> 2:01:24.500]  that are true currency
[2:01:24.500 --> 2:01:26.500]  they have real intrinsic value
[2:01:26.500 --> 2:01:28.500]  and they will always maintain their value
[2:01:28.500 --> 2:01:30.500]  no matter what the value of them is
[2:01:30.500 --> 2:01:32.500]  it will always buy you the same amount of goods
[2:01:32.500 --> 2:01:34.500]  and services at any period of time in history
[2:01:34.500 --> 2:01:36.500]  did you see the New York Times
[2:01:36.500 --> 2:01:38.500]  yesterday saying the Federal Reserve
[2:01:38.500 --> 2:01:40.500]  is going to issue its own T-bills
[2:01:40.500 --> 2:01:42.500]  and basically openly become the government
[2:01:42.500 --> 2:01:44.500]  I didn't see it in the New York Times
[2:01:44.500 --> 2:01:46.500]  and on the internet this morning
[2:01:46.500 --> 2:01:48.500]  unbelievable
[2:01:48.500 --> 2:01:50.500]  again how good a deal
[2:01:50.500 --> 2:01:52.500]  as a gold and silver broker
[2:01:52.500 --> 2:01:54.500]  decades of this
[2:01:54.500 --> 2:01:56.500]  is this for Ted to buy this stuff at the 740 range
[2:01:56.500 --> 2:01:58.500]  and with gold up at 815-820
[2:01:58.500 --> 2:02:00.500]  to be selling it now for that price
[2:02:00.500 --> 2:02:02.500]  I don't know where he finds this gold
[2:02:02.500 --> 2:02:04.500]  to begin with
[2:02:04.500 --> 2:02:06.500]  he makes commitments months in advance
[2:02:06.500 --> 2:02:08.500]  to have this delivered to us
[2:02:08.500 --> 2:02:10.500]  and he goes all over the face here
[2:02:10.500 --> 2:02:12.500]  if he's out of town right now looking for new opportunities
[2:02:12.500 --> 2:02:14.500]  for your radio listeners
[2:02:14.500 --> 2:02:16.500]  and more things that we can offer to get people involved
[2:02:16.500 --> 2:02:18.500]  and he looks for
[2:02:18.500 --> 2:02:20.500]  precious metals in all price ranges
[2:02:20.500 --> 2:02:22.500]  so no matter
[2:02:22.500 --> 2:02:24.500]  whether you've got a lot of money or a little bit of money
[2:02:24.500 --> 2:02:26.500]  he wants people to get started to understand
[2:02:26.500 --> 2:02:28.500]  that it's important that they have a portion of their portfolio
[2:02:28.500 --> 2:02:30.500]  in precious metals
[2:02:30.500 --> 2:02:32.500]  because the collapse is coming
[2:02:32.500 --> 2:02:34.500]  the collapse is at hand
[2:02:34.500 --> 2:02:36.500]  I mean we're mid-collapse right now
[2:02:36.500 --> 2:02:38.500]  and it's important for people to take a look at their assets
[2:02:38.500 --> 2:02:40.500]  get the precious metals
[2:02:40.500 --> 2:02:42.500]  as financial security and insurance
[2:02:42.500 --> 2:02:44.500]  and we'd be more than happy to help them
[2:02:44.500 --> 2:02:46.500]  well all the mainline analysts are now saying
[2:02:46.500 --> 2:02:48.500]  30% in gold and silver
[2:02:48.500 --> 2:02:50.500]  and decades ago
[2:02:50.500 --> 2:02:52.500]  or just a year or two ago they'd say 10%
[2:02:52.500 --> 2:02:54.500]  and then this is the best deal you're going to find out there
[2:02:54.500 --> 2:02:56.500]  a huge range of gold and silver
[2:02:56.500 --> 2:02:58.500]  but it will end
[2:02:58.500 --> 2:03:00.500]  it will end Sunday ladies and gentlemen
[2:03:00.500 --> 2:03:02.500]  this is the tail end of it
[2:03:02.500 --> 2:03:04.500]  and we've even got some buffaloes there
[2:03:04.500 --> 2:03:06.500]  available at an insane price
[2:03:06.500 --> 2:03:08.500]  800
[2:03:08.500 --> 2:03:10.500]  686 2237
[2:03:10.500 --> 2:03:12.500]  and the brokers will be there throughout the weekend
[2:03:12.500 --> 2:03:14.500]  and if you happen to call
[2:03:14.500 --> 2:03:16.500]  when somebody's out to lunch or something
[2:03:16.500 --> 2:03:18.500]  there's 26 brokers there now
[2:03:18.500 --> 2:03:20.500]  during the weekend there's about 6, 7, 8
[2:03:20.500 --> 2:03:22.500]  I'm told they have to be out
[2:03:22.500 --> 2:03:24.500]  or at lunch leave your name and number
[2:03:24.500 --> 2:03:26.500]  they'll call you right back if you want in on this deal
[2:03:26.500 --> 2:03:28.500]  they'll be there up until midnight tonight
[2:03:28.500 --> 2:03:30.500]  800 686 2237
[2:03:30.500 --> 2:03:32.500]  and what Ted does
[2:03:32.500 --> 2:03:34.500]  he buys when it's low
[2:03:34.500 --> 2:03:36.500]  and he sells when it's low but then he also sells when it's high
[2:03:36.500 --> 2:03:38.500]  he passes on that savings
[2:03:38.500 --> 2:03:40.500]  and that's why he annihilates
[2:03:40.500 --> 2:03:42.500]  all of his competition ladies and gentlemen
[2:03:42.500 --> 2:03:44.500]  but he's at the end
[2:03:44.500 --> 2:03:46.500]  of the last buy
[2:03:46.500 --> 2:03:48.500]  remember he sold out of the buy at 700
[2:03:48.500 --> 2:03:50.500]  then he bought in at 740 knowing it was going to go up
[2:03:50.500 --> 2:03:52.500]  then it went up to you know it's up at
[2:03:52.500 --> 2:03:54.500]  820 or so and it's at the tail end of that
[2:03:54.500 --> 2:03:56.500]  next week it's going to be up in the 800 range
[2:03:56.500 --> 2:03:58.500]  so pay now
[2:03:58.500 --> 2:04:00.500]  while it's 740 priced in there
[2:04:00.500 --> 2:04:02.500]  800 686
[2:04:02.500 --> 2:04:04.500]  2237
[2:04:04.500 --> 2:04:06.500]  anything else Jim?
[2:04:06.500 --> 2:04:08.500]  no just want to wish everybody out there a good holiday season
[2:04:08.500 --> 2:04:10.500]  absolutely now again
[2:04:10.500 --> 2:04:12.500]  brokers are going to be there all weekend

[2:04:16.500 --> 2:04:18.500]  and if you get in tonight
[2:04:18.500 --> 2:04:20.500]  don't wait folks give them a call
[2:04:20.500 --> 2:04:22.500]  again Jim it's got to feel good
[2:04:22.500 --> 2:04:24.500]  to be able to pitch gold and silver at this low price
[2:04:24.500 --> 2:04:26.500]  this could a deal
[2:04:26.500 --> 2:04:28.500]  absolutely it's always good but we know that we're helping people
[2:04:28.500 --> 2:04:30.500]  well I mean most places have shut down
[2:04:30.500 --> 2:04:32.500]  and saying they're out
[2:04:32.500 --> 2:04:34.500]  again Ted has been in it so long
[2:04:34.500 --> 2:04:36.500]  30 years and is so trusted
[2:04:36.500 --> 2:04:38.500]  by international brokers he's able to get it
[2:04:38.500 --> 2:04:40.500]  absolutely

[2:07:04.500 --> 2:07:06.500]  for the past several months
[2:07:06.500 --> 2:07:08.500]  folks have constantly asked me to give them the date
[2:07:08.500 --> 2:07:10.500]  as to when they should be finished stocking up on food
[2:07:10.500 --> 2:07:12.500]  we've been so beaten up
[2:07:12.500 --> 2:07:14.500]  by stock market banking
[2:07:14.500 --> 2:07:16.500]  housing and unemployment crashes
[2:07:16.500 --> 2:07:18.500]  sensitize and frozen and active like the frog
[2:07:18.500 --> 2:07:20.500]  being unknowingly cooked
[2:07:20.500 --> 2:07:22.500]  in gradually increasingly hot water
[2:07:22.500 --> 2:07:24.500]  we'll snap out of it we now have a deadline
[2:07:24.500 --> 2:07:26.500]  Joe Biden said it's going to happen
[2:07:26.500 --> 2:07:28.500]  former secretary of state
[2:07:28.500 --> 2:07:30.500]  when on CVS meet the press
[2:07:30.500 --> 2:07:32.500]  and pointed to about january 22nd
[2:07:32.500 --> 2:07:34.500]  as the time a major international incident
[2:07:34.500 --> 2:07:36.500]  would force the new president
[2:07:36.500 --> 2:07:38.500]  to make unpopular decisions
[2:07:38.500 --> 2:07:40.500]  while I take the generalist word
[2:07:40.500 --> 2:07:42.500]  my best advice is to have your food in your possession
[2:07:42.500 --> 2:07:44.500]  prior to the inauguration

[2:07:48.500 --> 2:07:50.500]  deadline for disaster
[2:07:50.500 --> 2:07:52.500]  ask yourself is it better to have too much too soon
[2:07:52.500 --> 2:07:54.500]  or too little too late
[2:07:54.500 --> 2:07:56.500]  call 800-409-5633
[2:07:56.500 --> 2:08:18.500]  or on the web efoodsdirect.com
[2:08:18.500 --> 2:08:26.500]  I was talking about last hour with the military
[2:08:26.500 --> 2:08:28.500]  the police being used by the foreign banks
[2:08:28.500 --> 2:08:30.500]  to take over the country
[2:08:30.500 --> 2:08:32.500]  to enforce the takeover
[2:08:32.500 --> 2:08:36.500]  it is not my opinion
[2:08:36.500 --> 2:08:38.500]  it is all over
[2:08:38.500 --> 2:08:40.500]  the news the washington post
[2:08:40.500 --> 2:08:42.500]  cnn cbs news
[2:08:42.500 --> 2:08:44.500]  the army times
[2:08:44.500 --> 2:08:48.500]  that under pdd 51 north com
[2:08:48.500 --> 2:08:50.500]  has now made the united states a military jurisdiction
[2:08:50.500 --> 2:08:52.500]  of the executive
[2:08:52.500 --> 2:08:54.500]  and that congress isn't allowed to see the full text
[2:08:54.500 --> 2:08:56.500]  of pdd 51
[2:08:56.500 --> 2:08:58.500]  and that governors serve at the pleasure
[2:08:58.500 --> 2:09:00.500]  of the president
[2:09:00.500 --> 2:09:02.500]  that they're abolishing the national guard
[2:09:02.500 --> 2:09:04.500]  and making it a total integrated force
[2:09:04.500 --> 2:09:06.500]  under the president
[2:09:06.500 --> 2:09:08.500]  its main mission to suppress the american people
[2:09:08.500 --> 2:09:10.500]  under riot civil insurrection
[2:09:10.500 --> 2:09:12.500]  and we have
[2:09:12.500 --> 2:09:14.500]  board governors the federal reserve and former ones
[2:09:14.500 --> 2:09:16.500]  telling the bloomberg
[2:09:16.500 --> 2:09:18.500]  the new york times and others that they've been told
[2:09:18.500 --> 2:09:20.500]  that we are now under war powers act
[2:09:20.500 --> 2:09:22.500]  and that even the regional federal reserve banks
[2:09:22.500 --> 2:09:24.500]  aren't allowed to be brought into what's happening
[2:09:24.500 --> 2:09:26.500]  i don't completely believe that i believe they have been threatened with it
[2:09:26.500 --> 2:09:28.500]  we know they have
[2:09:28.500 --> 2:09:30.500]  but a lot of them know this is so criminal
[2:09:30.500 --> 2:09:32.500]  they're claiming they're not involved
[2:09:32.500 --> 2:09:34.500]  i mean this is
[2:09:34.500 --> 2:09:36.500]  the hootspot
[2:09:36.500 --> 2:09:38.500]  the just the outrageousness
[2:09:38.500 --> 2:09:40.500]  the arrogance
[2:09:40.500 --> 2:09:42.500]  the
[2:09:42.500 --> 2:09:44.500]  the
[2:09:44.500 --> 2:09:46.500]  wanton
[2:09:46.500 --> 2:09:48.500]  bravada
[2:09:48.500 --> 2:09:50.500]  of what we're seeing just just
[2:09:50.500 --> 2:09:52.500]  stuns the mind
[2:09:52.500 --> 2:09:54.500]  and so the military the police have been
[2:09:54.500 --> 2:09:56.500]  federalized
[2:09:56.500 --> 2:09:58.500]  and they're publicly pointed at the states
[2:09:58.500 --> 2:10:00.500]  and pointed at the congress
[2:10:00.500 --> 2:10:02.500]  which is as powerful or more powerful
[2:10:02.500 --> 2:10:04.500]  than the president in the constitution
[2:10:04.500 --> 2:10:06.500]  and bill of rights the three branches of government
[2:10:06.500 --> 2:10:08.500]  this is classical tyranny
[2:10:08.500 --> 2:10:10.500]  to have a president or a prime minister
[2:10:10.500 --> 2:10:12.500]  or julia caesar the head of the senate
[2:10:12.500 --> 2:10:14.500]  in roam
[2:10:14.500 --> 2:10:16.500]  to tell the senate
[2:10:16.500 --> 2:10:18.500]  i am over you and the military works for me
[2:10:18.500 --> 2:10:20.500]  that's what they mean by he crossed the rubicon
[2:10:20.500 --> 2:10:22.500]  that is the river in the north
[2:10:22.500 --> 2:10:24.500]  over by austria
[2:10:24.500 --> 2:10:26.500]  and for
[2:10:26.500 --> 2:10:28.500]  500 years before
[2:10:28.500 --> 2:10:30.500]  400 years before it was illegal
[2:10:30.500 --> 2:10:32.500]  high treason to bring any of the legions
[2:10:32.500 --> 2:10:34.500]  past the rubicon
[2:10:34.500 --> 2:10:36.500]  to bring them south
[2:10:38.500 --> 2:10:40.500]  and of course he crossed the rubicon
[2:10:40.500 --> 2:10:42.500]  the rubicon and brought them into roam
[2:10:42.500 --> 2:10:44.500]  that's what this is and so i want the military
[2:10:44.500 --> 2:10:46.500]  the police the fbi
[2:10:46.500 --> 2:10:48.500]  you have crossed the rubicon
[2:10:48.500 --> 2:10:50.500]  you have engaged in high treason
[2:10:50.500 --> 2:10:52.500]  i don't care if your commander and chief
[2:10:52.500 --> 2:10:54.500]  order you to do it
[2:10:54.500 --> 2:10:56.500]  this is a tyrannical thing that's happening
[2:10:58.500 --> 2:11:00.500]  nine times out of ten
[2:11:00.500 --> 2:11:02.500]  nations never recover from this
[2:11:02.500 --> 2:11:04.500]  mass looting that occurs and mass looting is now occurring
[2:11:06.500 --> 2:11:08.500]  caesar of course robbed
[2:11:08.500 --> 2:11:10.500]  the rich roman
[2:11:10.500 --> 2:11:12.500]  elite
[2:11:12.500 --> 2:11:14.500]  he used that to pay off the military
[2:11:14.500 --> 2:11:16.500]  it was very bad for actually
[2:11:16.500 --> 2:11:18.500]  the wealthy
[2:11:18.500 --> 2:11:20.500]  as well as the main class
[2:11:22.500 --> 2:11:24.500]  the middle class and the poor and the slaves
[2:11:24.500 --> 2:11:26.500]  and everybody else the bond servants
[2:11:26.500 --> 2:11:28.500]  i mean this is not good for anybody
[2:11:28.500 --> 2:11:32.500]  but caesar
[2:11:32.500 --> 2:11:34.500]  but the globalist plan to be able to checkmate
[2:11:34.500 --> 2:11:36.500]  caesar because they're international
[2:11:36.500 --> 2:11:38.500]  in scope it's a global empire
[2:11:38.500 --> 2:11:40.500]  so it's more like the roman empire
[2:11:40.500 --> 2:11:42.500]  having dictatorships over its
[2:11:42.500 --> 2:11:44.500]  possessions and the united states is a
[2:11:44.500 --> 2:11:46.500]  possession you have this international financial
[2:11:46.500 --> 2:11:48.500]  umbrella that isn't based in any one
[2:11:48.500 --> 2:11:50.500]  country now saying they're going to
[2:11:50.500 --> 2:11:52.500]  issue governments t-bills you'll buy
[2:11:52.500 --> 2:11:54.500]  government bills government notes
[2:11:54.500 --> 2:11:56.500]  government bonds directly from them
[2:11:56.500 --> 2:11:58.500]  you'll pay your carbon taxes directly
[2:11:58.500 --> 2:12:00.500]  to them
[2:12:00.500 --> 2:12:02.500]  this is open complete
[2:12:02.500 --> 2:12:04.500]  tyrannical undemocratic as the
[2:12:04.500 --> 2:12:06.500]  financial times of london said but said it was good
[2:12:06.500 --> 2:12:08.500]  that that's good
[2:12:08.500 --> 2:12:10.500]  effective
[2:12:10.500 --> 2:12:12.500]  management as david rockefeller said
[2:12:12.500 --> 2:12:14.500]  you know that we need to get rid of the
[2:12:14.500 --> 2:12:16.500]  auto determination of democracies
[2:12:16.500 --> 2:12:18.500]  and sovereign nations and go to
[2:12:18.500 --> 2:12:20.500]  a world governed
[2:12:20.500 --> 2:12:22.500]  by the international banking elite
[2:12:22.500 --> 2:12:24.500]  so that
[2:12:24.500 --> 2:12:26.500]  back in the 70s on record
[2:12:26.500 --> 2:12:28.500]  you can pull up the actual quote if you want
[2:12:28.500 --> 2:12:30.500]  that's a paraphrase
[2:12:32.500 --> 2:12:34.500]  and they're now doing it
[2:12:34.500 --> 2:12:36.500]  and this has now happened
[2:12:38.500 --> 2:12:40.500]  and so you can't
[2:12:40.500 --> 2:12:42.500]  live in that gray area anymore people in
[2:12:42.500 --> 2:12:44.500]  government bureaucrats all of you
[2:12:44.500 --> 2:12:46.500]  you can't say all that's just made up
[2:12:46.500 --> 2:12:48.500]  all that's not happening it's all happening
[2:12:48.500 --> 2:12:50.500]  it's all out in the open
[2:12:50.500 --> 2:12:52.500]  hundreds of newspapers but telling you it's good
[2:12:52.500 --> 2:12:54.500]  people say well you're reading mainstream news
[2:12:54.500 --> 2:12:56.500]  i thought we can't believe them
[2:12:56.500 --> 2:12:58.500]  well they lie they spin they do things on certain issues
[2:12:58.500 --> 2:13:00.500]  like the media says it's the law you've got to take vaccines
[2:13:00.500 --> 2:13:02.500]  there's no law
[2:13:02.500 --> 2:13:04.500]  that's a lie but more often than not it's a spin
[2:13:04.500 --> 2:13:06.500]  or they tell the truth but say it's good
[2:13:08.500 --> 2:13:10.500]  you know they say something bad
[2:13:10.500 --> 2:13:12.500]  is good
[2:13:12.500 --> 2:13:14.500]  oh it's good to have trips on the streets
[2:13:14.500 --> 2:13:16.500]  oh it's good for the president to be a dictator
[2:13:16.500 --> 2:13:18.500]  oh it's good and see the establishment
[2:13:18.500 --> 2:13:20.500]  everything behind Obama he's the new puppet
[2:13:20.500 --> 2:13:22.500]  the new figurehead they're bringing
[2:13:22.500 --> 2:13:24.500]  him in to throw it in everybody's face
[2:13:26.500 --> 2:13:28.500]  now this constantly happens with our guest
[2:13:28.500 --> 2:13:30.500]  it's not on our end most of the time it's a time zone issue
[2:13:30.500 --> 2:13:32.500]  Richard Gage bottom
[2:13:32.500 --> 2:13:34.500]  i bet you a million bucks is thinks he's on next hour
[2:13:34.500 --> 2:13:36.500]  but that's when we have Bob Chapman so we'll have to move
[2:13:36.500 --> 2:13:38.500]  Richard Gage
[2:13:38.500 --> 2:13:40.500]  to another day
[2:13:40.500 --> 2:13:42.500]  but that's okay because i want to open the phones up
[2:13:42.500 --> 2:13:44.500]  for the listeners
[2:13:44.500 --> 2:13:46.500]  specifically
[2:13:48.500 --> 2:13:50.500]  hey guys forget the Gage thing
[2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:52.500]  hey Aaron
[2:13:52.500 --> 2:13:54.500]  forget it forget it i don't care if you've got him
[2:13:54.500 --> 2:13:56.500]  i don't want to give the phone number
[2:13:56.500 --> 2:13:58.500]  out and then i'll do it did you get him
[2:13:58.500 --> 2:14:00.500]  yeah just forget it he gets a time zone issue
[2:14:00.500 --> 2:14:02.500]  you've got to tell him over and over again these guests
[2:14:02.500 --> 2:14:04.500]  time zone time zone time zone time zone time zone
[2:14:04.500 --> 2:14:06.500]  time zone time zone time zone time zone
[2:14:06.500 --> 2:14:08.500]  because it's just an endless issue
[2:14:08.500 --> 2:14:10.500]  okay no big deal set him up next week
[2:14:10.500 --> 2:14:12.500]  thank you
[2:14:12.500 --> 2:14:14.500]  okay
[2:14:16.500 --> 2:14:18.500]  now
[2:14:19.500 --> 2:14:21.500]  Americans
[2:14:21.500 --> 2:14:23.500]  have overall been good people throughout their history on average
[2:14:23.500 --> 2:14:25.500]  better than really any other nation
[2:14:25.500 --> 2:14:27.500]  if you study history
[2:14:27.500 --> 2:14:29.500]  and look at the milk and honey look at the success
[2:14:29.500 --> 2:14:31.500]  at bread
[2:14:32.500 --> 2:14:34.500]  but throughout history
[2:14:34.500 --> 2:14:36.500]  corrupt elites come in and take over governments
[2:14:36.500 --> 2:14:38.500]  and it's just been a corporate takeover
[2:14:38.500 --> 2:14:40.500]  our government set up under agencies in a corporate model
[2:14:40.500 --> 2:14:42.500]  the last hundred years it's moved away from a true Republican
[2:14:42.500 --> 2:14:44.500]  form of government
[2:14:44.500 --> 2:14:46.500]  into this kind of robber baron ruled system
[2:14:46.500 --> 2:14:48.500]  and they've been expanding their power
[2:14:48.500 --> 2:14:50.500]  their monopolies ever since
[2:14:50.500 --> 2:14:52.500]  and they're using
[2:14:52.500 --> 2:14:54.500]  the military
[2:14:54.500 --> 2:14:56.500]  and the police
[2:14:56.500 --> 2:14:58.500]  in the name of security
[2:14:58.500 --> 2:15:00.500]  to submit
[2:15:00.500 --> 2:15:02.500]  their gains
[2:15:02.500 --> 2:15:04.500]  to submit
[2:15:04.500 --> 2:15:06.500]  the takeover because they can't
[2:15:06.500 --> 2:15:08.500]  just come into the government and steal
[2:15:08.500 --> 2:15:10.500]  8.5 trillion in seven weeks
[2:15:10.500 --> 2:15:12.500]  and then sail off into the sunset
[2:15:12.500 --> 2:15:14.500]  no no no
[2:15:14.500 --> 2:15:16.500]  that's done to expand their power
[2:15:16.500 --> 2:15:18.500]  to buy up the depressed stock market
[2:15:18.500 --> 2:15:20.500]  to buy up all the assets
[2:15:20.500 --> 2:15:22.500]  while posing as saviors
[2:15:22.500 --> 2:15:24.500]  and they know the public's going to get mad
[2:15:24.500 --> 2:15:26.500]  they know the public's going to find out
[2:15:26.500 --> 2:15:28.500]  they'll just burn a few
[2:15:28.500 --> 2:15:30.500]  scapegoats
[2:15:30.500 --> 2:15:32.500]  and then move forward into the new surf system
[2:15:32.500 --> 2:15:34.500]  they say they want you poor
[2:15:34.500 --> 2:15:36.500]  they say they want you bankrupt on record
[2:15:36.500 --> 2:15:38.500]  this is how they want to manage you
[2:15:38.500 --> 2:15:40.500]  they want to use food as a weapon
[2:15:44.500 --> 2:15:46.500]  and so it is open
[2:15:46.500 --> 2:15:48.500]  tyranny
[2:15:48.500 --> 2:15:50.500]  open despotism
[2:15:50.500 --> 2:15:52.500]  the gauntlet thrown
[2:15:52.500 --> 2:15:54.500]  in everyone's face
[2:15:54.500 --> 2:15:56.500]  and we have a decision to make
[2:15:56.500 --> 2:15:58.500]  are we going to go along with this
[2:15:58.500 --> 2:16:00.500]  the American people
[2:16:00.500 --> 2:16:02.500]  one world war two
[2:16:02.500 --> 2:16:04.500]  we've gone through a great depression
[2:16:04.500 --> 2:16:06.500]  one of the good guys, our government's good
[2:16:06.500 --> 2:16:08.500]  the American people started trusting government
[2:16:08.500 --> 2:16:10.500]  forgot the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[2:16:10.500 --> 2:16:12.500]  it was taken out of schools
[2:16:14.500 --> 2:16:16.500]  the foundations went into high gear
[2:16:16.500 --> 2:16:18.500]  to dumb the population down
[2:16:18.500 --> 2:16:20.500]  to use their public relations psychological warfare systems
[2:16:20.500 --> 2:16:22.500]  to train everybody
[2:16:22.500 --> 2:16:24.500]  to think they were on an endless vacation
[2:16:24.500 --> 2:16:26.500]  and didn't need to be involved in society
[2:16:26.500 --> 2:16:28.500]  and federalization
[2:16:28.500 --> 2:16:30.500]  was radically expanded across this country
[2:16:30.500 --> 2:16:32.500]  and other nations
[2:16:32.500 --> 2:16:34.500]  so the American people went to sleep
[2:16:34.500 --> 2:16:36.500]  they disengaged
[2:16:36.500 --> 2:16:38.500]  and in just one area
[2:16:38.500 --> 2:16:40.500]  suddenly the milk was 90%
[2:16:40.500 --> 2:16:42.500]  the formula was filled with deadly poison melamine
[2:16:42.500 --> 2:16:44.500]  suddenly there was mercury in the shots
[2:16:44.500 --> 2:16:46.500]  and from 1 in 25,000
[2:16:46.500 --> 2:16:48.500]  had autism
[2:16:48.500 --> 2:16:50.500]  to now 1 in 87 the latest numbers
[2:16:50.500 --> 2:16:52.500]  and the cancer rates exploded
[2:16:52.500 --> 2:16:54.500]  and they approved deadly GMO foods
[2:16:56.500 --> 2:16:58.500]  that's just one example of where we're not involved
[2:16:58.500 --> 2:17:00.500]  horrible things happen
[2:17:00.500 --> 2:17:02.500]  what would happen if you owned a business
[2:17:02.500 --> 2:17:04.500]  with 25 employees
[2:17:04.500 --> 2:17:06.500]  and you said I'm going away for 20 years
[2:17:06.500 --> 2:17:08.500]  I'm going to put a manager in charge
[2:17:08.500 --> 2:17:10.500]  and no one can review him
[2:17:10.500 --> 2:17:12.500]  no one can look at him
[2:17:12.500 --> 2:17:14.500]  no one can double check what he's doing
[2:17:14.500 --> 2:17:16.500]  he runs the bank account
[2:17:16.500 --> 2:17:18.500]  he can do whatever he wants
[2:17:18.500 --> 2:17:20.500]  well let's say he was a good manager
[2:17:20.500 --> 2:17:22.500]  but he dies in 5 years
[2:17:22.500 --> 2:17:24.500]  or he goes to a new job
[2:17:24.500 --> 2:17:26.500]  some new guy gets in
[2:17:26.500 --> 2:17:28.500]  that person's corrupt
[2:17:28.500 --> 2:17:30.500]  or a bad manager
[2:17:30.500 --> 2:17:32.500]  overnight
[2:17:32.500 --> 2:17:34.500]  everything is stolen
[2:17:34.500 --> 2:17:36.500]  the thing falls apart and breaks down
[2:17:36.500 --> 2:17:38.500]  now imagine the national security state
[2:17:38.500 --> 2:17:40.500]  1947 set up
[2:17:40.500 --> 2:17:42.500]  by the companies that shipped in the heroin and cocaine
[2:17:42.500 --> 2:17:44.500]  the legal pharmaceutical companies
[2:17:44.500 --> 2:17:46.500]  check out the founding of the CIA out of Yale
[2:17:46.500 --> 2:17:48.500]  predominantly
[2:17:48.500 --> 2:17:50.500]  running all these black ops
[2:17:50.500 --> 2:17:52.500]  they're given unlimited secrecy
[2:17:52.500 --> 2:17:54.500]  unlimited funding, unlimited power
[2:17:54.500 --> 2:17:56.500]  licensed to kill
[2:17:56.500 --> 2:17:58.500]  basically British intelligence already had a big foothold
[2:17:58.500 --> 2:18:00.500]  this is a big issue in the news
[2:18:00.500 --> 2:18:02.500]  in the 20s, 30s, 40s
[2:18:02.500 --> 2:18:04.500]  basically takes over our government
[2:18:04.500 --> 2:18:06.500]  through the round table groups
[2:18:06.500 --> 2:18:08.500]  the council on foreign relations
[2:18:08.500 --> 2:18:10.500]  they write news articles in England bragging about it
[2:18:10.500 --> 2:18:12.500]  in the newspaper that they now run the US
[2:18:12.500 --> 2:18:14.500]  not the British people, the British elite
[2:18:14.500 --> 2:18:16.500]  who know how to manage empires
[2:18:16.500 --> 2:18:18.500]  who know how to covertly take over countries
[2:18:18.500 --> 2:18:20.500]  they have their corporate takeover then and now
[2:18:20.500 --> 2:18:22.500]  they've been expanding it ever since
[2:18:22.500 --> 2:18:24.500]  they use this as an engine to take over the world
[2:18:24.500 --> 2:18:26.500]  they've been doing this out
[2:18:26.500 --> 2:18:28.500]  they've had unlimited secrecy, power and funding
[2:18:28.500 --> 2:18:30.500]  for 60 years
[2:18:30.500 --> 2:18:32.500]  since
[2:18:32.500 --> 2:18:34.500]  1947
[2:18:34.500 --> 2:18:36.500]  for 61 years
[2:18:36.500 --> 2:18:38.500]  now what would happen with your children
[2:18:38.500 --> 2:18:40.500]  if you said I'm going to leave my
[2:18:40.500 --> 2:18:42.500]  10 and 11 year olds
[2:18:42.500 --> 2:18:44.500]  hypothetically somebody out there
[2:18:44.500 --> 2:18:46.500]  I'm going to leave for 6 months
[2:18:46.500 --> 2:18:48.500]  here's the money, here's the credit cards
[2:18:48.500 --> 2:18:50.500]  have fun or teenagers
[2:18:50.500 --> 2:18:52.500]  a 14 and 15 year old
[2:18:52.500 --> 2:18:54.500]  here's the keys to the car, here's the bank account
[2:18:54.500 --> 2:18:56.500]  I'm leaving
[2:18:56.500 --> 2:18:58.500]  what would happen when you came home
[2:19:00.500 --> 2:19:02.500]  but these aren't children you left at home
[2:19:02.500 --> 2:19:04.500]  this is powerful ruthless
[2:19:04.500 --> 2:19:06.500]  power hungry men and now it's their children
[2:19:06.500 --> 2:19:08.500]  and their grandchildren in control
[2:19:08.500 --> 2:19:10.500]  and they've gotten away with millions of things
[2:19:10.500 --> 2:19:12.500]  and so now they just said well we'll just
[2:19:12.500 --> 2:19:14.500]  bankrupt everything, take everything over
[2:19:14.500 --> 2:19:16.500]  everybody will be destitute, we'll have all the currency
[2:19:16.500 --> 2:19:18.500]  and then we'll become absolute kings
[2:19:18.500 --> 2:19:20.500]  and openly have the banks become world government
[2:19:20.500 --> 2:19:22.500]  and that's now happening
[2:19:22.500 --> 2:19:24.500]  and we'll build FEMA camps and train the public
[2:19:24.500 --> 2:19:26.500]  tortures good and secret arrest is good
[2:19:26.500 --> 2:19:28.500]  and we'll stage terror attacks if they try to
[2:19:28.500 --> 2:19:30.500]  remove us from power and blame it on them
[2:19:30.500 --> 2:19:32.500]  as a pretext to stomp on them
[2:19:32.500 --> 2:19:34.500]  and we'll regulate their lives
[2:19:34.500 --> 2:19:36.500]  and tax them and shut down their farms and ranches
[2:19:36.500 --> 2:19:38.500]  and we'll totally enslave them
[2:19:38.500 --> 2:19:40.500]  and that's what's now happening
[2:19:40.500 --> 2:19:42.500]  I want to hear from the military, I want to hear from police
[2:19:42.500 --> 2:19:44.500]  I want to hear from citizens about what you've heard me talk about
[2:19:44.500 --> 2:19:46.500]  the last few hours, how you think we counter it
[2:19:46.500 --> 2:19:48.500]  where you think this is going
[2:19:48.500 --> 2:19:50.500]  here calls it

[2:19:54.500 --> 2:19:56.500]  when we get back
[2:19:56.500 --> 2:19:58.500]  websites are infowars.com
[2:19:58.500 --> 2:20:20.500]  do you take nutritional supplements but don't notice any benefits?

[2:33:02.500 --> 2:33:06.500]  1-800-340-7091

[2:33:18.500 --> 2:33:24.500]  1-800-340-7091
[2:33:24.500 --> 2:33:29.340]  They do want to discredit me with national television hit pieces and hit pieces in newspapers
[2:33:29.340 --> 2:33:33.500]  and everything else, but I am not here to get involved with all the egos and all the
[2:33:33.500 --> 2:33:34.500]  other people out there.
[2:33:34.500 --> 2:33:37.180]  And I don't like folks asking me about stuff like that, because you'll get the truth from
[2:33:37.180 --> 2:33:38.180]  me.
[2:33:38.180 --> 2:33:39.900]  I'm tired of being Mr. Nice Guy.
[2:33:39.900 --> 2:33:42.220]  We don't have time for this.
[2:33:42.220 --> 2:33:45.700]  Bill Cooper's a very sad story, okay?
[2:33:45.700 --> 2:33:49.020]  It's a very sad thing.
[2:33:49.020 --> 2:33:53.220]  And that's all I can say.
[2:33:53.220 --> 2:33:54.220]  It isn't about me.
[2:33:54.220 --> 2:33:55.220]  I'm not in his story.
[2:33:55.220 --> 2:33:59.420]  I'm not part of his story, other than trying to help him and being treated horribly for
[2:33:59.420 --> 2:34:02.140]  it, via egomania.
[2:34:02.140 --> 2:34:07.380]  That's all I do is bring other people on and try to uplift them and put out edifying information
[2:34:07.380 --> 2:34:08.780]  so people know what's happening.
[2:34:08.780 --> 2:34:14.460]  Now, listen, I asked you callers about the New World Order and how we defeat it and what
[2:34:14.460 --> 2:34:19.820]  we do about Northcom being activated against the people and the bank stealing $8.5 trillion.
[2:34:19.820 --> 2:34:21.620]  I mean, does anybody care about that?
[2:34:21.620 --> 2:34:23.740]  Does anybody want to address that?
[2:34:23.740 --> 2:34:25.980]  Let's say Alex Jones is the worst person in the world.
[2:34:25.980 --> 2:34:28.180]  They did steal $8.5 trillion.
[2:34:28.180 --> 2:34:29.780]  They won't say where it went.
[2:34:29.780 --> 2:34:31.300]  This is politically insane.
[2:34:31.300 --> 2:34:40.020]  If we get the word out on this, we may be able to bring him to justice.
[2:34:40.020 --> 2:34:41.020]  It just blows me away.
[2:34:41.020 --> 2:34:42.300]  I mean, am I for real?
[2:34:42.300 --> 2:34:46.220]  Well, do I have video marines training to take your guns?
[2:34:46.220 --> 2:34:49.820]  Do I put up an AP article about them trying to pay off the police chief of San Antonio
[2:34:49.820 --> 2:34:54.500]  Delta Force to take over with secret martial law preparation, and then do I go videotape
[2:34:54.500 --> 2:34:57.140]  the police chief in his office?
[2:34:57.140 --> 2:35:01.660]  Do I have the former head of Pakistani intelligence on to tell you that 9-11's an inside job
[2:35:01.660 --> 2:35:05.260]  and you can make the decision whether he's telling you the truth or not, and that Mumbai
[2:35:05.260 --> 2:35:07.980]  was a staged event?
[2:35:07.980 --> 2:35:11.420]  Do we have governors on and do we have politics and congressmen on?
[2:35:11.420 --> 2:35:13.900]  Do we talk about issues and give you bill numbers?
[2:35:13.900 --> 2:35:16.820]  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[2:35:16.820 --> 2:35:19.940]  Do I spend time attacking other people and other hosts?
[2:35:19.940 --> 2:35:21.220]  No, no, no.
[2:35:21.220 --> 2:35:25.860]  Do I tell us to, folks, that's what COINTELPRO is about, is getting us all fighting with
[2:35:25.860 --> 2:35:27.620]  each other.
[2:35:27.620 --> 2:35:31.300]  I come on here and warn you how provocateurs will try to set you up.
[2:35:31.300 --> 2:35:34.380]  I come on and warn you about patriot scams, but I don't name names.
[2:35:34.380 --> 2:35:37.940]  I just tell you to look out on our end and on their end.
[2:35:37.940 --> 2:35:41.820]  I try to edify with the knowledge and the things I've learned.
[2:35:41.820 --> 2:35:48.700]  I'm just an aggressive Texan who loves liberty and freedom and knows how to read a government
[2:35:48.700 --> 2:35:52.560]  document and I'm here warning you.
[2:35:52.560 --> 2:35:57.760]  We don't have time anymore to sit around sucking our thumbs.
[2:35:57.760 --> 2:36:02.540]  We don't have time.
[2:36:02.540 --> 2:36:05.020]  One in three toys is toxic.
[2:36:05.020 --> 2:36:06.860]  Don't buy your children the toys.
[2:36:06.860 --> 2:36:09.300]  Don't drink fluoridated water.
[2:36:09.300 --> 2:36:15.740]  It's not a law, you've got to take the shots.
[2:36:15.740 --> 2:36:17.060]  Aspartame is killing people.
[2:36:17.060 --> 2:36:21.740]  We have doctors and scientists on all these issues as announcements.
[2:36:21.740 --> 2:36:27.380]  I'm like a lighthouse warning you about the rocks or a buoy over rocks and you're like,
[2:36:27.380 --> 2:36:29.740]  I don't know if that's a good buoy.
[2:36:29.740 --> 2:36:33.500]  We'll go over by the buoy and look under the water and see if you see a rock there
[2:36:33.500 --> 2:36:37.020]  and you go over by the buoy and there's a big fat rock underneath it and I've told
[2:36:37.020 --> 2:36:44.820]  you about a million rocks and there's rocks under every one of them and it isn't that
[2:36:44.820 --> 2:36:46.100]  I care about being attacked.
[2:36:46.100 --> 2:36:49.860]  I expect that because I am hurting the new world order with the good people spreading
[2:36:49.860 --> 2:36:51.380]  the word out there.
[2:36:51.380 --> 2:36:56.420]  We're working as one engine together but we need everybody pulling and fighting and out
[2:36:56.420 --> 2:36:57.420]  there.
[2:36:57.420 --> 2:36:58.420]  It's the information.
[2:36:58.420 --> 2:36:59.420]  It's the information.
[2:36:59.420 --> 2:37:00.420]  It's the information.
[2:37:00.420 --> 2:37:12.620]  It's the information, that's what we need to be focused on, is the information accurate.
[2:37:12.620 --> 2:37:16.220]  The answer is yes, it's accurate, it's hidden in plain view.
[2:37:16.220 --> 2:37:19.220]  Did the Financial Times of London run by the Bilderberg Group?
[2:37:19.220 --> 2:37:22.860]  We have the links to that, the head of it.
[2:37:22.860 --> 2:37:25.340]  Did they announce that they have set up a world government?
[2:37:25.340 --> 2:37:26.340]  The banks are going to run it.
[2:37:26.340 --> 2:37:28.740]  You're going to pay carbon taxes to them.
[2:37:28.740 --> 2:37:30.580]  Yes.
[2:37:30.580 --> 2:37:33.500]  Have they signed a transatlantic agreement between the North American Union and the European
[2:37:33.500 --> 2:37:35.620]  Union in the Rose Garden?
[2:37:35.620 --> 2:37:36.620]  Is it an end game?
[2:37:36.620 --> 2:37:37.620]  Yes.
[2:37:37.620 --> 2:37:38.620]  What are we going to do?
[2:37:38.620 --> 2:37:42.820]  Did judicial watch Sue and get the documents on the North American Union and did it say
[2:37:42.820 --> 2:37:44.140]  they're setting it up?
[2:37:44.140 --> 2:37:45.140]  Yes.
[2:37:45.140 --> 2:37:46.740]  Did they say they're going to have carbon taxes?
[2:37:46.740 --> 2:37:47.740]  Yes.
[2:37:47.740 --> 2:37:50.580]  Did they say they're going to use troops on the streets and foreign troops?
[2:37:50.580 --> 2:37:52.300]  Yes.
[2:37:52.300 --> 2:37:54.820]  What are you going to do about that?
[2:37:54.820 --> 2:37:57.140]  What are you going to do about that?
[2:37:57.140 --> 2:38:00.740]  What are you going to do about it?
[2:38:00.740 --> 2:38:04.300]  But see, people are trained to be lazy.
[2:38:04.300 --> 2:38:11.580]  And psychologically, they obsess on the messenger instead of, oh my God, he's got posted the
[2:38:11.580 --> 2:38:15.980]  Northcom documents, the Possecom and Tottis takeover documents.
[2:38:15.980 --> 2:38:17.460]  He's got all these experts on.
[2:38:17.460 --> 2:38:19.060]  He's giving you the facts.
[2:38:19.060 --> 2:38:24.340]  Instead of going and working on that and then warning others, it's all about Alex Jones.
[2:38:24.340 --> 2:38:30.460]  All right, I'm going to try to go to your calls as quick as possible because I want
[2:38:30.460 --> 2:38:32.580]  to get to a lot of people here.
[2:38:32.580 --> 2:38:34.340]  Kyle and I will go ahead.
[2:38:34.340 --> 2:38:35.340]  Hello.
[2:38:35.340 --> 2:38:36.340]  Hello.
[2:38:36.340 --> 2:38:45.180]  Well, I had one point I wanted to make, and this is actually to the intelligence people
[2:38:45.180 --> 2:38:52.500]  out there and everything, when the New World Order gets its global governance instituted
[2:38:52.500 --> 2:38:55.700]  if it does, and they don't have the middle class to fight anymore.
[2:38:55.700 --> 2:38:57.580]  They don't have anyone else to fight anymore.
[2:38:57.580 --> 2:39:01.420]  They're going to look inward because the guys at the top are going to be like, okay, who
[2:39:01.420 --> 2:39:03.420]  wants to usurp my power now?
[2:39:03.420 --> 2:39:07.980]  So the people that are part of this are splitting their own throats because they're going to
[2:39:07.980 --> 2:39:08.980]  stir up.
[2:39:08.980 --> 2:39:09.980]  And that always happens in history, absolutely.
[2:39:09.980 --> 2:39:10.980]  Always.
[2:39:10.980 --> 2:39:11.980]  And they never listen.
[2:39:11.980 --> 2:39:12.980]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:39:12.980 --> 2:39:18.940]  And also, as far as another solution, I tried uploading it to Google, but it was giving
[2:39:18.940 --> 2:39:24.300]  me problems, but I actually took your Endgame 1.5 and the interview with Lindsay Williams
[2:39:24.300 --> 2:39:27.940]  and mixed-mashed them together and put dates on it.
[2:39:27.940 --> 2:39:29.500]  I'm still trying to get it uploaded on Google.
[2:39:29.500 --> 2:39:30.500]  Good.
[2:39:30.500 --> 2:39:31.500]  You're taking action.
[2:39:31.500 --> 2:39:33.500]  You're taking action.
[2:39:33.500 --> 2:39:40.140]  And I also put up an Obama video that's about two hours long, and that is on Google video.
[2:39:40.140 --> 2:39:44.340]  I actually had to mask my IP address for that because apparently they're blocking out my
[2:39:44.340 --> 2:39:46.420]  IP address because of the other videos I put up.
[2:39:46.420 --> 2:39:47.420]  Absolutely.
[2:39:47.420 --> 2:39:48.420]  It doesn't matter.
[2:39:48.420 --> 2:39:50.540]  It's not going to stop me from putting videos up there.
[2:39:50.540 --> 2:39:51.540]  It doesn't matter what they do.
[2:39:51.540 --> 2:39:56.260]  I'll always find a way around it, so keep trying, guys.
[2:39:56.260 --> 2:40:00.540]  But yeah, I just want to make that point because these people who serve the system are going
[2:40:00.540 --> 2:40:05.540]  to get fed on because, just like I said before, when they don't have anyone else to look at,
[2:40:05.540 --> 2:40:09.100]  the guys at the top are going to be like, who's going to want to take my power from
[2:40:09.100 --> 2:40:10.100]  me now?
[2:40:10.100 --> 2:40:13.420]  And since the people that serve them are just like them, they're going to be like, oh, wow,
[2:40:13.420 --> 2:40:14.420]  they're a vulture.
[2:40:14.420 --> 2:40:16.820]  They're going to want to take my power from me, and that's exactly what they're going
[2:40:16.820 --> 2:40:17.820]  to do.
[2:40:17.820 --> 2:40:21.900]  They're going to kill half of them, so either out of fear or because they want to set an
[2:40:21.900 --> 2:40:25.500]  example, and it's not going to ever stop.
[2:40:25.500 --> 2:40:28.980]  It'll just go back to the way it was before where every three or four months all of a
[2:40:28.980 --> 2:40:34.220]  sudden you got a new leader because the old one got killed by a quick of guys on the inside
[2:40:34.220 --> 2:40:36.500]  that wanted to kill them off and just not going to stop.
[2:40:36.500 --> 2:40:39.940]  And then everything falls apart like every other third-world nation exactly.
[2:40:39.940 --> 2:40:42.700]  This is bad for 99.9% of us.
[2:40:42.700 --> 2:40:44.180]  I appreciate your call.
[2:40:44.180 --> 2:40:45.180]  Great call.
[2:40:45.180 --> 2:40:46.180]  Great points.
[2:40:46.180 --> 2:40:47.180]  Good to hear from you, Kyle.
[2:40:47.180 --> 2:40:48.180]  You're back in Oregon.
[2:40:48.180 --> 2:40:49.180]  You're on the year worldwide.
[2:40:49.180 --> 2:40:50.180]  Morning, Alex.
[2:40:50.180 --> 2:40:51.180]  How you doing?
[2:40:51.180 --> 2:40:53.180]  I'm pretty fired up.
[2:40:53.180 --> 2:41:00.700]  Pretty dug on up to this point in time after 12, 15 years of putting your heart and soul
[2:41:00.700 --> 2:41:09.540]  into this, and you're relying on everyone else to actually make the information work,
[2:41:09.540 --> 2:41:11.860]  what you've worked so hard to put out there.
[2:41:11.860 --> 2:41:18.020]  Alex, I call today that in the light of, I mentioned to you before, you may remember,
[2:41:18.020 --> 2:41:25.540]  but just the word publicity, that hasn't entered into the arsenal of truth to supercharge
[2:41:25.540 --> 2:41:32.260]  it, to actually get the facts into the mass media in this country, which is doing everything
[2:41:32.260 --> 2:41:36.860]  they can to cover up every bit of information, what you've exposed by...
[2:41:36.860 --> 2:41:38.260]  Well, not just me.
[2:41:38.260 --> 2:41:39.260]  It's all of us together.
[2:41:39.260 --> 2:41:44.220]  I have no power, but through you guys, you have no power, but through each other, all
[2:41:44.220 --> 2:41:45.220]  of us together.
[2:41:45.220 --> 2:41:46.220]  Here's an example.
[2:41:46.220 --> 2:41:53.020]  Every time on Fox, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, they show at Koshkari, with Paulson, with Bernanke,
[2:41:53.020 --> 2:41:56.620]  have to say, well, the Democrats, Republicans have to say, if they're pushing the bank or
[2:41:56.620 --> 2:42:01.460]  takeover, but every time it cuts to the congressmen who are saying, you're criminals, you stole
[2:42:01.460 --> 2:42:07.260]  the money, you're liars, it's going on, they cut away, but C-SPAN has it, so I'll flip
[2:42:07.260 --> 2:42:08.260]  over.
[2:42:08.260 --> 2:42:10.860]  I mean, there it is, that's how they're doing it, right there.
[2:42:10.860 --> 2:42:11.860]  Right.
[2:42:11.860 --> 2:42:18.540]  They don't want to even show to the public any kind of fight against what is being done
[2:42:18.540 --> 2:42:19.540]  right in front of them.
[2:42:19.540 --> 2:42:21.060]  Yeah, they don't even know there's a fight against it.
[2:42:21.060 --> 2:42:23.220]  They want us all broken up and unaware this is happening.
[2:42:23.220 --> 2:42:28.420]  I mean, there are so many examples of this, but that's why the alternative media is exploding
[2:42:28.420 --> 2:42:32.700]  and has to grow even faster, because they're rushing to shut down the web.
[2:42:32.700 --> 2:42:35.100]  They're already doing it piece by piece, incrementally.
[2:42:35.100 --> 2:42:38.380]  We have all got to use it now to educate everybody now.
[2:42:38.380 --> 2:42:39.540]  Right, Alex.
[2:42:39.540 --> 2:42:45.340]  The time frame is so doggone short, they are gone at such bliss-creek speed here, that
[2:42:45.340 --> 2:42:50.420]  it seems that the thing that would work the very best may actually at this time because
[2:42:50.420 --> 2:42:55.420]  of the surrounding energies that are happening out of all of the fear and intimidation which
[2:42:55.420 --> 2:43:00.460]  they've generated within people over the years is to a large degree hampered people, even
[2:43:00.460 --> 2:43:03.380]  when they do have the information, from stepping out.
[2:43:03.380 --> 2:43:08.220]  Yeah, they make excuses, subconsciously it's scary to fight this, so they just say, I choose
[2:43:08.220 --> 2:43:10.660]  to say he's a bad guy, it's not true.
[2:43:10.660 --> 2:43:13.140]  Everything I'm saying is on record.
[2:43:13.140 --> 2:43:14.140]  It's all out.
[2:43:14.140 --> 2:43:17.700]  Look, 10 years ago it was on record, they were going to set up Northcom and put troops
[2:43:17.700 --> 2:43:21.460]  on the streets because they were going to economically implode us.
[2:43:21.460 --> 2:43:25.980]  It was in last year's British Ministry of Defense report, they're admitting what they're
[2:43:25.980 --> 2:43:26.980]  doing.
[2:43:26.980 --> 2:43:27.980]  That's right.
[2:43:27.980 --> 2:43:28.980]  It isn't about me.
[2:43:28.980 --> 2:43:33.780]  No, absolutely not, it's about all of the information, what you've made available, what
[2:43:33.780 --> 2:43:38.460]  is the stake that can kill the vampire, but the thing is, is how does that information
[2:43:38.460 --> 2:43:42.300]  get transformed into actual causing them to slow down and stop them from doing it?
[2:43:42.300 --> 2:43:45.140]  Well, people are looking for silver bullets.
[2:43:45.140 --> 2:43:47.580]  We're going to kill the New World Order by a billion cuts.
[2:43:47.580 --> 2:43:50.860]  It's going before your city council, listen, I appreciate your call, let me just give you
[2:43:50.860 --> 2:43:52.660]  a solution right now.
[2:43:52.660 --> 2:43:57.140]  We probably had 10 guests on this week about solutions and ideas.
[2:43:57.140 --> 2:44:02.460]  It's millions of little solutions, hundreds of big solutions, thousands of medium-sized
[2:44:02.460 --> 2:44:03.460]  solutions.
[2:44:03.460 --> 2:44:07.260]  Right after the Patriot Act passed, I read it, I did an analysis, something lawyers
[2:44:07.260 --> 2:44:08.260]  wouldn't do.
[2:44:08.260 --> 2:44:13.900]  I read it, I checked the US code, I wrote a plan of how to fight it and I laid out what
[2:44:13.900 --> 2:44:18.420]  it did and a bunch of law firms and universities went and looked it up and I got a big award
[2:44:18.420 --> 2:44:23.300]  from Project Censored and they found it was all true what I said, only because I spent
[2:44:23.300 --> 2:44:28.780]  a day in a two-day period reading the whole thing and writing up the Patriot Act and then
[2:44:28.780 --> 2:44:35.020]  Patriot Act 2 destroys remaining liberties piece and I said, we need county, cities and
[2:44:35.020 --> 2:44:38.380]  states to declare that they are still constitution zones.
[2:44:38.380 --> 2:44:40.100]  People said, well, it's a federal issue.
[2:44:40.100 --> 2:44:43.500]  No, the states and counties can announce that their people are going to follow the Bill
[2:44:43.500 --> 2:44:48.340]  of Rights and Constitution and then other groups picked up the idea, codified it in 800 plus
[2:44:48.340 --> 2:44:51.540]  cities, seven states throughout the Patriot Act.
[2:44:51.540 --> 2:44:56.780]  It's a moral political issue of saying we rebuke you, we stand up to you, you know, attacking
[2:44:56.780 --> 2:45:03.620]  the letter to the church door, kind of like Martin Luther, but in a political fashion
[2:45:03.620 --> 2:45:09.900]  and throwing down the gauntlet and saying, you are tyrants, you are tyrannous.
[2:45:09.900 --> 2:45:12.020]  But that takes you carrying the ball.
[2:45:12.020 --> 2:45:16.700]  Now, I went to Fredericksburg, Texas, I went to other towns, I went to Austin and in Austin
[2:45:16.700 --> 2:45:20.980]  we passed a resolution saying the Bill of Rights still is in effect and we won't take
[2:45:20.980 --> 2:45:26.780]  federal trips here and we're not going to live under martial law, okay?
[2:45:26.780 --> 2:45:30.060]  So you do similar things, but I can't do it all.
[2:45:30.060 --> 2:45:34.300]  You've got the minds, you've got the intelligence, you pick an issue, you go in there, go speak
[2:45:34.300 --> 2:45:37.740]  before your city council, have the Washington Post, hold it up and say, they say they're
[2:45:37.740 --> 2:45:41.100]  getting rid of the National Guard federalizing and putting trips on the streets for the American
[2:45:41.100 --> 2:45:42.100]  people.
[2:45:42.100 --> 2:45:45.780]  You can laugh, mayor, if you want, this is serious, this is tyranny, we don't want to
[2:45:45.780 --> 2:45:47.020]  be a third world country.
[2:45:47.020 --> 2:45:50.940]  That'll be seen on the local access TV, it'll be seen on the county TV, people hear about
[2:45:50.940 --> 2:45:55.060]  it, you go back every week and you do it, you wear a suit and tie, you bring others,
[2:45:55.060 --> 2:46:00.900]  you invite others, you know, there's, again, let's say there's a lot of retired talk show
[2:46:00.900 --> 2:46:05.020]  host, go get a radio show again, if you have to pay for it on the weekend, get sponsors
[2:46:05.020 --> 2:46:08.700]  so it pays for itself, do it.
[2:46:08.700 --> 2:46:10.740]  Every time I say it, people call me, well, how do I do that?
[2:46:10.740 --> 2:46:13.180]  Do it, it isn't hard, go figure it out.
[2:46:13.180 --> 2:46:17.260]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters, there is no headquarters.
[2:46:17.260 --> 2:46:24.220]  Go to the sound of the guns, ladies and gentlemen, Jim in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[2:46:24.220 --> 2:46:32.340]  Hey, Alex, hey, I'm fighting tooth and nail, fist and fang, hook and claw and blood and
[2:46:32.340 --> 2:46:37.900]  bone against these people and I've been doing it for 53 years, every week I take time off
[2:46:37.900 --> 2:46:43.380]  work to go to the commissioner's court in Williamson County and address them personally.
[2:46:43.380 --> 2:46:46.140]  This is Jim Dylan and you have done a lot of good, Jim.
[2:46:46.140 --> 2:46:50.860]  Well, listen, Alex, the trips are on the streets in Austin, Texas today, right here in front
[2:46:50.860 --> 2:46:59.180]  of me, right in front of Toys R Us, the United States Marine Corps and full battle gear with
[2:46:59.180 --> 2:47:08.860]  with armored 50 caliber equipped humbees right in the middle of the parking lot in front
[2:47:08.860 --> 2:47:09.860]  of Toys R Us.
[2:47:09.860 --> 2:47:15.180]  And this is all part of, you know, first the sports stadiums in Kentucky, yeah, I want
[2:47:15.180 --> 2:47:16.180]  to talk to them.
[2:47:16.180 --> 2:47:22.380]  All right, I got, I got five or six in battle dress uniform with their Kevlar vests and
[2:47:22.380 --> 2:47:31.180]  helmets and everything else on and I got some and I got a guy in dress uniform and allegedly
[2:47:31.180 --> 2:47:36.620]  they're collecting toys for the kids, but I asked them why they need the heavy equipment
[2:47:36.620 --> 2:47:40.780]  and again, it's all part of condition, that's why they have the police do it, the Marines
[2:47:40.780 --> 2:47:44.780]  do it, it's all and they're in the schools now basically force recruiting, threatening
[2:47:44.780 --> 2:47:45.780]  the kids.
[2:47:45.780 --> 2:47:46.780]  Telling us the law.
[2:47:46.780 --> 2:47:50.540]  Well, we had met it, it was for intimidation, but here's the United States Marine Corps
[2:47:50.540 --> 2:47:55.580]  Sergeant Alex, you can ask him about the toy drive in front of Toys R Us, here he is.
[2:47:55.580 --> 2:47:57.420]  Okay, Sergeant, what's your name?
[2:47:57.420 --> 2:47:59.980]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, Alex?
[2:47:59.980 --> 2:48:01.980]  Good Sergeant, what's your name?
[2:48:01.980 --> 2:48:04.140]  I'm Jacob Coronado.
[2:48:04.140 --> 2:48:06.140]  You don't know who I am, do you?
[2:48:06.140 --> 2:48:07.140]  Yeah, I do.
[2:48:07.140 --> 2:48:09.140]  I got a couple other Marines here that want to talk to you.
[2:48:09.140 --> 2:48:10.140]  Hold on.
[2:48:10.140 --> 2:48:15.140]  How you doing, sir, we're up here at Toys R Us collecting toys for Toys for Tots.
[2:48:15.140 --> 2:48:19.020]  Now, but you see, you guys are good guys, but you're being used by the New World Order
[2:48:19.020 --> 2:48:22.140]  to acclimate the public to seeing, I mean, I'm sure you've heard they're going to use
[2:48:22.140 --> 2:48:26.060]  the Army on the streets of America, what do you think of that?
[2:48:26.060 --> 2:48:31.820]  I'm collecting toys for needy children here in the Austin area, that's what I think.
[2:48:31.820 --> 2:48:36.180]  I know it's funny, did you hear about how North Com's going to quote, help at car wrecks?
[2:48:36.180 --> 2:48:43.020]  It's also part of the PR to condition the public to, let me ask you this, listen, Sergeant,
[2:48:43.020 --> 2:48:46.580]  Sergeant, it's great that you're collecting toys for the children.
[2:48:46.580 --> 2:48:49.580]  What they really need is their bill of rights and constitution.
[2:48:49.580 --> 2:48:52.420]  You support the bill of rights and constitution, right?
[2:48:52.420 --> 2:48:58.180]  Absolutely, I also support our collection of toys, so we can put smiles on children's
[2:48:58.180 --> 2:49:00.180]  faces across Austin this Christmas.
[2:49:00.180 --> 2:49:04.460]  What they need is enough to be injected with a mercury shot and an autism, but let me expand
[2:49:04.460 --> 2:49:06.780]  something, Sergeant Coronado, right?
[2:49:06.780 --> 2:49:07.780]  Great.
[2:49:07.780 --> 2:49:12.540]  Well, thank you very much, though, and I hope you can come by and support us and drop
[2:49:12.540 --> 2:49:13.540]  off the toys.
[2:49:13.540 --> 2:49:17.580]  Well, Sergeant, hold on, Sergeant, tell us your location, Sergeant.
[2:49:17.580 --> 2:49:18.580]  Thank you.
[2:49:18.580 --> 2:49:20.580]  Alex, he didn't want to talk to you much longer.
[2:49:20.580 --> 2:49:24.620]  Well, I wanted to ask him, I know he's heard they're getting rid of Posse Commentatus,
[2:49:24.620 --> 2:49:28.940]  will he support troops for combat on the streets of America, but see, Jim, you've heard me
[2:49:28.940 --> 2:49:32.820]  say, they're doing this for PR, they admit it, North Com says they're going to have the
[2:49:32.820 --> 2:49:37.460]  jaws of life, and the Army and the Marines are going to bust open cars.
[2:49:37.460 --> 2:49:39.340]  See how that's for propaganda purposes?
[2:49:39.340 --> 2:49:45.340]  Yeah, they're defending us from our own devices, and they're going to save us.
[2:49:45.340 --> 2:49:51.780]  They're even having pictures with their little kids and on top of their humbees here with
[2:49:51.780 --> 2:49:54.700]  the swivel mounted in a 50 cal.
[2:49:54.700 --> 2:50:02.220]  My last year at Anderson High School, it was 1992, we had a principal who was a retired
[2:50:02.220 --> 2:50:03.220]  Army colonel.
[2:50:03.220 --> 2:50:07.020]  He announced on the PA system, you know, on the last day, enjoy yourselves, you're now
[2:50:07.020 --> 2:50:11.060]  part of the New World Order, and they had Army helicopters land, and everybody went
[2:50:11.060 --> 2:50:12.620]  out and they said, join the military.
[2:50:12.620 --> 2:50:16.100]  So yes, it's all part of getting them, just like they do in third world countries, they're
[2:50:16.100 --> 2:50:18.180]  acclimating us to their presence, Jim.
[2:50:18.180 --> 2:50:19.180]  What else are they doing?
[2:50:19.180 --> 2:50:24.300]  Well, it's a recruitment effort, really, but they're under the guise of collecting toys
[2:50:24.300 --> 2:50:25.300]  for kids.
[2:50:25.300 --> 2:50:26.300]  Yeah, it's brainwashing.
[2:50:26.300 --> 2:50:32.540]  They made toys full of lead and melamine and so on, but I mean, it's right in the middle
[2:50:32.540 --> 2:50:35.580]  of the street, right, between Best Buy and Toys R Us.
[2:50:35.580 --> 2:50:38.300]  When I rounded the corner, I thought I was in Iraq.
[2:50:38.300 --> 2:50:40.220]  Okay, which Toys R Us is this, Jim?
[2:50:40.220 --> 2:50:41.220]  I'm going to send the camera.
[2:50:41.220 --> 2:50:42.220]  Aaron, don't leave.
[2:50:42.220 --> 2:50:47.220]  It's 183, 183 and 620, Make Line Mall.
[2:50:47.220 --> 2:50:52.460]  Okay, I've got to go do the live TV show in an hour and a half, so I can't go, but I'm
[2:50:52.460 --> 2:50:57.020]  going to send Aaron out there, or maybe somebody else from the office, they're all getting ready
[2:50:57.020 --> 2:50:58.020]  for the live show.
[2:50:58.020 --> 2:50:59.020]  I'm going to stay there, Jim.
[2:50:59.020 --> 2:51:03.140]  I want to hear more about this.
[2:51:03.140 --> 2:51:05.700]  Toxic heavy metals negatively impact our health.
[2:51:05.700 --> 2:51:09.860]  There in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, the products we use, and the
[2:51:09.860 --> 2:51:11.540]  objects we touch.
[2:51:11.540 --> 2:51:13.300]  Exposure is impossible to avoid.
[2:51:13.300 --> 2:51:17.180]  Heavy metals build up within the body over a period of time causing poor health.
[2:51:17.180 --> 2:51:21.940]  However, with Keelarex, they can be mobilized and excreted in a safe and effective manner.
[2:51:21.940 --> 2:51:26.500]  Keelarex was developed based on Dr. Alan Greenberg's clinical experience with heavy metal poisoning
[2:51:26.500 --> 2:51:29.140]  during his 25 years of medical practice.
[2:51:29.140 --> 2:51:34.260]  Keelarex does not contain EDTA and is made from all natural ingredients, enhancing the
[2:51:34.260 --> 2:51:38.820]  body's natural mechanisms for excreting heavy metals and preventing their reabsorption.
[2:51:38.820 --> 2:51:42.980]  Keelarex contains antioxidants to protect the liver, kidneys, central nervous system
[2:51:42.980 --> 2:51:47.980]  and immune functions, and effectively mobilizes mercury and 15 other heavy metals including
[2:51:47.980 --> 2:51:50.100]  aluminum, arsenic, lead and more.
[2:51:50.100 --> 2:51:58.500]  Find out what Keelarex can do for you by calling 1-800-675-4568, or visit us online at C-H-E-L-O-R-E-X
[2:51:58.500 --> 2:51:59.500]  dot com.
[2:51:59.500 --> 2:52:01.500]  That's Keelarex dot com today.
[2:52:01.500 --> 2:52:07.940]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war
[2:52:07.940 --> 2:52:09.440]  against this country.
[2:52:09.440 --> 2:52:11.580]  The enemies struck America on September 11th.
[2:52:11.580 --> 2:52:13.580]  But who is the enemy?
[2:52:13.580 --> 2:52:14.580]  Ben Laden.
[2:52:14.580 --> 2:52:15.580]  This is his MO.
[2:52:15.580 --> 2:52:16.580]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:52:16.580 --> 2:52:18.580]  We have to look to Osama Ben Laden.
[2:52:18.580 --> 2:52:23.420]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence
[2:52:23.420 --> 2:52:26.020]  networks inside the United States.
[2:52:26.020 --> 2:52:29.900]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in
[2:52:29.900 --> 2:52:32.660]  spying in and on the U.S.
[2:52:32.660 --> 2:52:36.260]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:52:36.260 --> 2:52:41.780]  Ben Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:52:41.780 --> 2:52:45.940]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much,
[2:52:45.940 --> 2:52:46.940]  much more.
[2:52:46.940 --> 2:52:52.420]  Fabled Enemies, get the DVD at infowars.com, or see it in super high quality, along with
[2:52:52.420 --> 2:52:54.900]  hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:52:54.900 --> 2:53:02.580]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[2:53:02.580 --> 2:53:08.300]  Did you know that it's a documented fact 80% of all Americans and 85% of people around
[2:53:08.300 --> 2:53:11.860]  the world suffer from internal parasites and parasitic infection?
[2:53:11.860 --> 2:53:16.220]  You may be one of millions of people suffering from one of dozens of debilitating chronic
[2:53:16.220 --> 2:53:17.220]  diseases.
[2:53:17.220 --> 2:53:19.900]  From these parasites and your doctor would never know it.
[2:53:19.900 --> 2:53:24.460]  In fact, clinically-detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[2:53:24.460 --> 2:53:27.300]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.
[2:53:27.300 --> 2:53:32.020]  Now you can fight internal parasites, heavy metal poisoning, and high cholesterol, naturally
[2:53:32.020 --> 2:53:33.020]  and safely.
[2:53:33.020 --> 2:53:37.780]  By mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder, also known as FPP, with your favorite beverage
[2:53:37.780 --> 2:53:38.780]  once a day.
[2:53:38.780 --> 2:53:43.980]  FPP is used around the world, has numerous uses, and is now available to you from Fresh
[2:53:43.980 --> 2:53:45.180]  Water Organics.
[2:53:45.180 --> 2:53:50.020]  FPP strengthens skin, hair, and bones, lowers cholesterol, and is an excellent source of
[2:53:50.020 --> 2:53:53.340]  natural plant-based silica with 14 trace minerals.

[2:53:55.340 --> 2:54:12.820]  Again, that's FreshWaterOrganics.com, or call 888-949-357-7.
[2:54:12.820 --> 2:54:15.860]  Let me explain what's happening.
[2:54:15.860 --> 2:54:20.540]  There's government documents on this, we've covered them, but now they admit it.
[2:54:20.540 --> 2:54:24.980]  They say they're going to use the Army, the Marines, and foreign troops, Toronto SCARB,
[2:54:24.980 --> 2:54:28.460]  other publications, admit that.
[2:54:28.460 --> 2:54:32.140]  In the United States, but they say they've got to acclimate the public, so college football
[2:54:32.140 --> 2:54:41.220]  games, we have photos and video, my film Marshall Lobb, in 2003, 2004, with the regular Army
[2:54:41.220 --> 2:54:45.340]  and National Guard, and then a civil defense force out at college football games, searching
[2:54:45.340 --> 2:54:51.100]  little children's bags, and in downtown major cities, searching children all over the country.
[2:54:51.100 --> 2:54:52.100]  It's an acclamation.
[2:54:52.100 --> 2:54:55.460]  Now, in the public schools, they bring them toys, they're there brainwashing them.
[2:54:55.460 --> 2:54:57.420]  Oh, it's all toys for children.
[2:54:57.420 --> 2:55:01.460]  What they need is their Bill of Rights and Constitution, and then now the Army is going
[2:55:01.460 --> 2:55:05.820]  to have troops in every city that, quote, help at car wrecks, as if the fire department
[2:55:05.820 --> 2:55:08.740]  and police couldn't, and that's for PR, with lots of news stories.
[2:55:08.740 --> 2:55:09.740]  The Army's here.
[2:55:09.740 --> 2:55:10.740]  They brought toys.
[2:55:10.740 --> 2:55:11.740]  The Army's here.
[2:55:11.740 --> 2:55:13.420]  They were at the parade helping children.
[2:55:13.420 --> 2:55:17.300]  The Army's here running a checkpoint arresting terrorists.
[2:55:17.300 --> 2:55:20.140]  The Army's here helping with the jaws of life at a car wreck.
[2:55:20.140 --> 2:55:24.700]  They're using Army helicopters to fly the person hurt in the car wreck out.
[2:55:24.700 --> 2:55:29.620]  Jim Dillon, so what were you doing up in North Austin when you ran across the Marines?
[2:55:29.620 --> 2:55:35.740]  Well, Alex, I was taking a shortcut to my job, and I cut through the mall here at 620
[2:55:35.740 --> 2:55:36.740]  and 183.
[2:55:36.740 --> 2:55:42.340]  And now they've got three security officers from the mall on me, not the lights on.
[2:55:42.340 --> 2:55:47.340]  I'm going to try to tell my vehicle and everything, but I'm sure I can handle that.
[2:55:47.340 --> 2:55:51.980]  So they're telling you in America that you aren't allowed, they're operating as if it's
[2:55:51.980 --> 2:55:55.780]  a public place in the parking lot, that you're not allowed to be out there with the Marines
[2:55:55.780 --> 2:55:56.780]  with the children?
[2:55:56.780 --> 2:55:57.780]  Right.
[2:55:57.780 --> 2:56:03.900]  I guess I intimidated the United States Marine Corps, Alex, by asking him why the heavy
[2:56:03.900 --> 2:56:10.260]  artillery, if they're just collecting toys for kids, by trying to acclimate the children
[2:56:10.260 --> 2:56:16.780]  and condition them to accept killing and warfare as a natural part of life in America.
[2:56:16.780 --> 2:56:20.260]  And the troops bring you toys?
[2:56:20.260 --> 2:56:25.460]  Well they have those nice uniforms and everything, and that commands a certain amount of respect
[2:56:25.460 --> 2:56:26.460]  and identity.
[2:56:26.460 --> 2:56:28.860]  That's exactly how in third world countries the force multipliers take control of the
[2:56:28.860 --> 2:56:30.860]  local groups.
[2:56:30.860 --> 2:56:31.860]  Yeah.
[2:56:31.860 --> 2:56:40.860]  Well, we're not fooled by toys being used.
[2:56:40.860 --> 2:56:43.220]  What are these security people doing to you, Dylan?
[2:56:43.220 --> 2:56:49.300]  Well, they've got me surrounded now, they've got their lights on, I'm actually circling
[2:56:49.300 --> 2:56:53.820]  the parking lot now, I went ahead and jumped in the car because it was a little more quiet.
[2:56:53.820 --> 2:57:00.460]  They've got a radio station, a big party set up at the Marine Corps and all the camouflaged
[2:57:00.460 --> 2:57:04.500]  equipment, so they're behaving, well you know Mitt Romney owns Toys R Us.
[2:57:04.500 --> 2:57:05.500]  Oh boy.
[2:57:05.500 --> 2:57:07.940]  Well, he's a moron or is it Mormon?
[2:57:07.940 --> 2:57:12.180]  Dylan, what you need to do is, let's not bash people now, Dylan, what I want you to
[2:57:12.180 --> 2:57:16.940]  do is get out of there and then come back and park somewhere else, that way you evade
[2:57:16.940 --> 2:57:22.180]  them and then my guys, I'm going to have to tell them to park away from it here in the
[2:57:22.180 --> 2:57:27.020]  supposed free country because everything's a corporate state now, just to get up and
[2:57:27.020 --> 2:57:28.420]  get the video and ask questions.
[2:57:28.420 --> 2:57:34.020]  So the Marines, I guess after we dare talk to them, called security, did you see that?
[2:57:34.020 --> 2:57:35.020]  Yes, they did.
[2:57:35.020 --> 2:57:36.020]  Yes, they did.
[2:57:36.020 --> 2:57:37.520]  Oh, in the free country, oh.
[2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:46.140]  Well, that's been lurking in the area, asking the probing questions for the last couple
[2:57:46.140 --> 2:57:49.220]  of hours while you had me on hold anyway, so they knew what was up.
[2:57:49.220 --> 2:57:52.140]  Well, we opened the phones up 45 minutes ago.
[2:57:52.140 --> 2:57:58.220]  Dylan, you should have told John Harmon what was going on, you know, we don't screen
[2:57:58.220 --> 2:58:00.940]  phone calls, so we didn't know, you have to tell us these things.
[2:58:00.940 --> 2:58:05.380]  Well, he just asked a name and what state I was from, so that's what I gave him.
[2:58:05.380 --> 2:58:10.220]  I know, but if you should have volunteered, because we don't screen calls, we don't know.
[2:58:10.220 --> 2:58:11.740]  Should have volunteered to inform me.
[2:58:11.740 --> 2:58:12.740]  Dylan.
[2:58:12.740 --> 2:58:14.380]  I am a volunteer, Alex, I'm a Minuteman.
[2:58:14.380 --> 2:58:15.860]  I understand that, Dylan.
[2:58:15.860 --> 2:58:21.900]  You need to leave the area, throw them off and then come back in the supposed free country
[2:58:21.900 --> 2:58:26.620]  with the Marines tracking you with the security guards and then continue to observe the situation
[2:58:26.620 --> 2:58:28.220]  and call back in.
[2:58:28.220 --> 2:58:32.100]  I'm going to give you the back line right now, okay, Dylan?
[2:58:32.100 --> 2:58:39.740]  And I've got the cavalry on the way, and Erin and Derek are on their way to videotape.
[2:58:39.740 --> 2:58:40.740]  How dare us.
[2:58:40.740 --> 2:58:41.740]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
