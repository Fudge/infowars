[00:00.000 --> 00:16.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny well
[00:16.600 --> 00:32.440]  so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's alex jones I want this to
[00:32.440 --> 00:40.120]  sink in on this Tuesday September 22nd and it's just a time to have our head
[00:40.120 --> 00:43.720]  screwed on straight and get on our knees to God because this is the big one
[00:43.720 --> 00:51.360]  ladies and gentlemen we are not living in normal times we're living in the year
[00:51.360 --> 00:59.240]  2020 but I'll tell you this we're living in such an incredibly amazing and
[00:59.240 --> 01:03.040]  thought-provoking and dangerous time that there was a film made in the early
[01:03.040 --> 01:09.960]  1990s that described exactly what's happening but it condensed it down to
[01:09.960 --> 01:16.080]  something very simple so that happened very quickly
[01:16.480 --> 01:23.760]  there's a real weapon takes it to time so you never know what hit you that way
[01:23.760 --> 01:32.240]  you don't see it creeping up because we knew this was coming down we knew what
[01:32.240 --> 01:43.560]  they were planning and now we're sure of it they are gonna scuttle the whole
[01:43.560 --> 01:54.160]  country and bring it down it's just that simple because where this AI is taking
[01:54.160 --> 01:59.520]  us is a nightmare situation but they are going to try execute their operation
[01:59.520 --> 02:08.320]  even though we're aware of it they don't care this is a doomsday scenario by the
[02:08.320 --> 02:11.960]  way you know what the Pentagon back in the 70s called this satellite grid
[02:11.960 --> 02:15.960]  hooked into the internet tracking everything you do they called it
[02:15.960 --> 02:25.600]  Skynet and we cannot sit here and let them do it because this country is two
[02:25.600 --> 02:29.680]  minutes from destruction total annihilation and war in the streets and
[02:29.680 --> 02:37.640]  everything we've built flushed down the toilet there's red fire in the sky to
[02:37.640 --> 02:41.680]  try to exterminate humanity the technology that they have deployed and
[02:41.680 --> 02:48.720]  developed to replace us we're accepting Skynet and the AI system in
[02:48.720 --> 02:55.240]  I've said it before and I'll say it again resistance is victory that simple
[02:55.240 --> 03:01.800]  initial decision to stand up and to get involved and to take action is the most
[03:01.800 --> 03:06.000]  important decision you can make in the fight for freedom and human dignity
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.240]  do you understand that Soros you think you're gonna have this fight never
[03:10.240 --> 03:23.520]  robots want it no I say to you we are in charge of the planet you pathetic
[03:23.520 --> 03:35.440]  maggot info wars has delivered because you have delivered info wars is organic
[03:35.440 --> 03:40.040]  pro-human resistance for the globalist takeover and the Satan's plan to kill
[03:40.040 --> 03:44.840]  humanity this is real you can see Bill Gates announcing he owns your body you
[03:44.840 --> 03:49.640]  can see the globalist announcing they own your family good news is for every
[03:49.640 --> 03:53.480]  action there's an opposite legal reaction and you are that reaction so
[03:53.480 --> 03:57.480]  understand you are not supporters of the info war you're not calling it to thank
[03:57.480 --> 04:03.200]  me you are the info war you are the resistance you are the future so now
[04:03.200 --> 04:07.920]  with 25 days out from the election spread the word about the broadcast by the
[04:07.920 --> 04:11.520]  products that support us to stay on air in the face of the enemy you kept us in
[04:11.520 --> 04:17.640]  attack formation and pray for us you do that trifecta nothing can stop you you
[04:17.640 --> 04:23.600]  control your destiny you are a victory take action now
[04:23.600 --> 04:40.200]  I made transmission kicks off in T-minus 60 seconds please spread the
[04:40.200 --> 04:57.760]  transmission for wars tomorrow's news today
[04:57.760 --> 05:02.480]  for more than a hundred years the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to
[05:02.480 --> 05:07.080]  establish world government abolish nation-states dumb down the population
[05:07.080 --> 05:10.840]  by taking control of education and most importantly taking control of western
[05:10.840 --> 05:16.520]  medicine now they had a bad name by the 1920s they started converting over and
[05:16.520 --> 05:21.480]  funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their
[05:21.480 --> 05:27.840]  eugenics operations fast forward to the 1980s the baton is handed by IBM via his
[05:27.840 --> 05:32.200]  mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates the third his father of course
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.160]  being had a planned parenthood and now he's been able to position himself over
[05:36.160 --> 05:41.320]  almost every health department in the world every national health system
[05:41.320 --> 05:46.440]  Bill Gates is in control they have spent a hundred plus years getting
[05:46.440 --> 05:50.880]  positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in
[05:50.880 --> 05:54.400]  your body this is the holy grail of their operations and now they're
[05:54.400 --> 06:11.680]  normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body it's October 7th 26 days on
[06:11.680 --> 06:15.920]  from the election 105 from the inauguration and the forces of Satan
[06:15.920 --> 06:22.800]  are launching every attack they've got there's good news when I go on the
[06:22.800 --> 06:26.800]  Trump campaign website and on YouTube I see the fact that they are rolling up the
[06:26.800 --> 06:31.400]  big guns and praying almost every report having prayer meetings online on the
[06:31.400 --> 06:35.560]  official presidential site this is what we need to counter the forces of Satan
[06:35.560 --> 06:44.000]  is Jesus Christ okay I got up at 430 as his customary this morning and I got
[06:44.000 --> 06:52.880]  really mad at myself I was sitting there drinking coffee by about 5 a.m. and I
[06:52.880 --> 06:59.280]  just watched a horrible 24-minute closing arguments of Big Mike also known as
[06:59.280 --> 07:08.040]  Michelle Obama that's what Obama calls it Big Mike calls it Michael and it was
[07:08.040 --> 07:12.240]  just such lies she's like the only way to get the economy going to get into stop
[07:12.240 --> 07:17.000]  the lockdown is to stop Trump and we want you to be successful and we want you
[07:17.000 --> 07:25.080]  to be free it's all just so realized and so then when the campaign ad ended on
[07:25.080 --> 07:30.720]  YouTube it loaded another campaign ad and then it loaded another campaign ad so I
[07:30.720 --> 07:36.000]  watched three of them the next few were on like a minute long and I said you know
[07:36.000 --> 07:40.600]  I've got a feeling let me go over to the Trump campaign website on YouTube where
[07:40.600 --> 07:46.720]  they're spending tens of millions of dollars so far so I go over there and I
[07:46.720 --> 07:51.160]  watch not one not two not three not four five videos we're doing a report on this
[07:51.160 --> 07:57.760]  that will be out before that this broadcast is done and guess what happens
[07:57.760 --> 08:01.640]  on all of the paid Trump ads where he's paying and sending these out to his
[08:01.640 --> 08:07.720]  supporters after it rolls the little minute long or two minute long Trump ad
[08:07.720 --> 08:17.280]  it airs a Joe Biden ad but most of the time it doesn't show a Joe Biden ad it
[08:17.280 --> 08:29.520]  shows a Stephen Colbert anti-Trump piece it shows all of this it shows comedy
[08:29.520 --> 08:34.600]  central it shows the late shows it shows Saturday Night Live because we know
[08:34.600 --> 08:39.760]  they're the surrogate mouthpiece for Democratic Party when you pay to run
[08:39.760 --> 08:45.880]  ads then you expect more of your ads to load in not you send somebody a Trump
[08:45.880 --> 08:49.120]  ad and then all this Democratic propaganda runs at the end of it just
[08:49.120 --> 08:53.520]  like they put Democrat talking points over Trump's tweets now or outright
[08:53.520 --> 08:58.960]  block them so what is this it's total and complete election meddling and
[08:58.960 --> 09:06.680]  scamming and again Biden videos don't roll and then go to a Trump video
[09:06.880 --> 09:13.720]  Biden videos roll and go to more Biden videos but the Trump ads either go to
[09:13.720 --> 09:20.480]  Biden videos which you know are not being paid for or they go to attack
[09:20.480 --> 09:25.800]  pieces on Saturday Night Live or Stephen Colbert or comedy central vicious
[09:25.800 --> 09:31.880]  pieces they went to the Saturday Night Live piece where they call the president
[09:31.880 --> 09:35.720]  a bowl of scum that he's had his face ripped off it's a total maggot that needs
[09:35.720 --> 09:41.120]  to die I mean it was just a horrible Saturday Night Live I watched it on
[09:41.120 --> 09:48.080]  Sunday after today and that's what Trump speeches that he pays and ads he pays
[09:48.080 --> 09:54.000]  to have pushed out there go to so when the campaign sends out these emails and
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.400]  sure enough I went to where I'm signed up for Trump emails where they're
[09:57.400 --> 10:01.560]  sending out YouTube ads this morning I spent like an hour and a half on this
[10:01.560 --> 10:07.040]  and sure enough the campaign ads I'm being sent are in YouTube formats many
[10:07.040 --> 10:12.640]  times and then they roll over and play Biden ads after it I've got so much big
[10:12.640 --> 10:19.080]  breaking news today but we're gonna show you the video clips of this we're
[10:19.080 --> 10:23.400]  preparing it right now where when the video ends for Trump it goes to an
[10:23.400 --> 10:31.600]  anti-Trump video when the Democrats videos in it goes to a pro Biden video
[10:31.600 --> 10:36.520]  this is pure election meddling imagine if you bought a grocery store ad for your
[10:36.520 --> 10:40.800]  grocery store chain and that every time your grocery store ad runs it doesn't
[10:40.800 --> 10:44.080]  roll another one of your ads that you have there it rolls your competitions
[10:44.080 --> 10:49.600]  ad but not vice versa this is election meddling and it shows the
[10:49.600 --> 10:54.320]  unbelievable incompetence of the Trump campaign Trump strong the American
[10:54.320 --> 10:58.280]  people are strong but the incompetence of allowing the censorship the incompetence
[10:58.280 --> 11:04.160]  of having this go on the incompetence or the outright sabotage but the
[11:04.160 --> 11:10.800]  Republican Party is aware of all of this surely and they're letting them do
[11:10.800 --> 11:19.480]  this again they send out these as ads they pay for their ads to roll in the
[11:19.480 --> 11:27.280]  b-roll of Joe Rogan's podcast and so many other shows and when you then click
[11:27.280 --> 11:32.560]  on the Trump ad to go watch more ads you don't get taken to Trump you get
[11:32.560 --> 11:37.440]  taken to the Democrats and because the average Republican in Congress is like
[11:37.440 --> 11:42.000]  80 years old because Trump's people Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump I guess you
[11:42.000 --> 11:46.040]  know God bless them but I mean they're having dinner with Google are they in
[11:46.040 --> 11:53.240]  on this or are they just chumps so there's total election meddling going
[11:53.240 --> 11:57.960]  on on every front voters in four battleground states file lawsuits claiming
[11:57.960 --> 12:03.400]  election meddling funded by Mark Zuckerberg absolutely 99% of the
[12:03.400 --> 12:07.480]  referrals he gives for the Democrat Party websites Democrat Party videos and
[12:07.480 --> 12:12.320]  articles and as we approach election day he says no Republican ads or statements
[12:12.320 --> 12:15.640]  will be allowed there's a shadow ban already on all conservatives including
[12:15.640 --> 12:20.800]  Tucker Carlson that's admitted outright bans are expanding and they have the list
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.360]  of millions and millions of Americans your Facebook will be blocked coming up
[12:25.360 --> 12:30.760]  to election day as well this is the criminal activity of these individuals
[12:30.760 --> 12:35.720]  absolutely massive and they're gonna spin it anywhere Trump wins and say oh
[12:35.720 --> 12:41.440]  it's Russians all right I'm gonna stop right there but we're gonna put together
[12:41.440 --> 12:45.480]  a video report showing you because I sent to the crew what I just told you
[12:45.480 --> 12:49.600]  that the screenshots of the videos and then what it loads to so you can see it
[12:49.600 --> 12:59.240]  for yourself that is so massive in and of itself and they've gotten away with
[12:59.240 --> 13:02.840]  it so they're only gonna do more okay here's the big news obviously we are
[13:02.840 --> 13:10.960]  into our number four of the 40 hour broadcast that is gonna run for the
[13:10.960 --> 13:16.880]  next almost two days I haven't done a fundraiser in a long time I've done a
[13:16.880 --> 13:21.480]  money bomb in over a year it's been about a year and a half but when we sell
[13:21.480 --> 13:24.760]  a lot of product you'll say we sell a hundred thousand dollars with the product
[13:24.760 --> 13:28.680]  but then that only brings in like thirty forty thousand dollars but when we do
[13:28.680 --> 13:32.960]  straight-up donations we can keep about 95% of that to really continue on this
[13:32.960 --> 13:36.520]  is such a special place there's nowhere else like it the enemy totally hates it
[13:36.520 --> 13:41.080]  we break a large portion of the most vital stories that no one else will touch
[13:41.080 --> 13:45.720]  because they're scared we go we're almost no one else dare to go other than
[13:45.720 --> 13:49.240]  project Veritas and a handful of other groups and we wish that there were more
[13:49.240 --> 13:53.080]  groups that were as awake and hardcore as we are we wish there were more people
[13:53.080 --> 13:57.960]  as awake and hardcore as you are but it's our job as this critical world
[13:57.960 --> 14:01.440]  government mark of the beast system comes in and as the pedophilia comes out in
[14:01.440 --> 14:04.320]  the open of the Satanism comes out in the open that we stay on air because
[14:04.320 --> 14:07.440]  we're more effective now than ever so I want to thank you all for your support
[14:07.440 --> 14:11.880]  over the years now I encourage you to go to info wars.com we can put that up on
[14:11.880 --> 14:18.480]  screen website info wars.com you can see up at the top of info wars.com you can
[14:18.480 --> 14:23.160]  sponsor us we're not sponsored by George Soros or the Southern Prairie Law
[14:23.160 --> 14:27.920]  Center or the Rockefellers or the Rothschilds and these aren't donations
[14:27.920 --> 14:34.160]  because technically a donation could be tax exempt it's a sponsorship to make
[14:34.160 --> 14:39.320]  a one-time $10 donation 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 or you can sign up for recurring
[14:39.320 --> 14:44.960]  sponsorship and cancel anytime that way we get roughly 95% of the money to fund
[14:44.960 --> 14:49.400]  the operation and that's so precious and it's been these money bombs throughout
[14:49.400 --> 14:59.000]  the years have taken us over the main yard line into touchdown territory so go
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.400]  to info wars.com and you can find right there on the front page the donate buttons
[15:04.400 --> 15:08.040]  we've got customized we've got one time we've got recurring but again they're
[15:08.040 --> 15:12.200]  not donations it's sponsorship because that's critical that you're sponsoring
[15:12.200 --> 15:17.440]  this content and standing in the gap when others don't so I thank you and I
[15:17.440 --> 15:21.760]  salute you there's also the big info wars total blowout special 30 to 60% off
[15:21.760 --> 15:28.840]  and free shipping so a lot of product to fund ourselves but we do that that
[15:28.840 --> 15:32.880]  sales gonna happen soon because we're effectively blowing out of almost
[15:32.880 --> 15:35.920]  everything we've got and then hopefully the money bomb goes well we'll have
[15:35.920 --> 15:40.400]  money to reorder more product than come in a seed bunny but now's the time to
[15:40.400 --> 15:43.000]  take action in this critical fight we also appreciate you telling everybody
[15:43.000 --> 15:47.720]  that the 40-hour special emergency save America save info wars transmission is

[16:10.960 --> 16:16.360]  the world being built by the technocrats the trap they've now sprung with
[16:16.360 --> 16:21.800]  COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us
[16:21.800 --> 16:28.920]  past domestication into total and complete dehumanization human life will
[16:28.920 --> 16:34.280]  be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year
[16:34.280 --> 16:40.280]  2050 this is their stated goal I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things
[16:40.280 --> 16:45.160]  like this to you but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own
[16:45.160 --> 16:49.320]  decency onto the enemy we turn this around you must study their own
[16:49.320 --> 16:54.120]  writings you must face the facts and you must come to grips with it you're all
[16:54.120 --> 16:59.540]  being incrementally destroyed the Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the
[16:59.540 --> 17:04.080]  earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power unto the one
[17:04.080 --> 17:09.440]  world leader the Antichrist and he has a beast system that no one can buy and
[17:09.440 --> 17:13.840]  or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand and
[17:13.840 --> 17:19.760]  we look back all the warnings you were given and all just the common sense that
[17:19.760 --> 17:24.240]  you don't believe in God or prophecy giving governments corporations the
[17:24.240 --> 17:29.400]  power to control who can buy and who can sell to track everything we do he's not
[17:29.400 --> 17:33.560]  just a recipe it's a blueprint for total enslavement and now you look at Bill
[17:33.560 --> 17:38.480]  Gates you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats we
[17:38.480 --> 17:42.520]  should decide how much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat
[17:42.520 --> 17:46.920]  you get we're technocrats we know best we're now gonna set up the economy with
[17:46.920 --> 17:51.560]  a social score to totally control you you snap your fingers we're here they're
[17:51.560 --> 17:57.120]  just rolling it out and a lot of people are complying with it it's insane
[17:57.120 --> 18:11.760]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[18:27.120 --> 18:41.800]  ladies and gentlemen save America info wars money bomb you cannot doubt that
[18:41.800 --> 18:45.400]  info wars has been absolutely critical in getting Trump elected getting
[18:45.400 --> 18:49.920]  Bolsonaro elected getting Boris Johnson has gone sideways on us but exposing the
[18:49.920 --> 18:55.720]  real architecture of planetary control there's all these fake talking points all
[18:55.720 --> 19:00.960]  these schools of disinformation all these rabbit trails all these distractions
[19:00.960 --> 19:07.600]  but info wars is over the target and our breakdown of the world is extremely
[19:07.600 --> 19:12.280]  accurate extremely historical we also understand there is a giant spiritual
[19:12.280 --> 19:18.960]  component to all of it all right let me tell you what is coming up today I was
[19:18.960 --> 19:21.200]  sitting there looking at all these great guests we've got lined up you know I
[19:21.200 --> 19:26.720]  think I'm gonna cancel most these just because nothing is them I just think we
[19:26.720 --> 19:29.560]  should really open the phones up during a money bomb throughout the whole next
[19:29.560 --> 19:33.680]  40 hours it really is about you the listeners really is about you the viewers
[19:33.680 --> 19:40.680]  you that keep us on air and what you have to say we'll see but we also have a
[19:40.680 --> 19:44.560]  big list of who's gonna be hosting what I'm gonna be giving that roster here in
[19:44.560 --> 19:47.560]  a moment I'll tell you about that next segment the lineup of who's hosting when
[19:47.560 --> 19:54.000]  and a lot more it's all listed there on the front page of info wars.com as well
[19:54.000 --> 19:59.760]  but let me go ahead and just tell you what is coming up supposedly spy gate
[19:59.760 --> 20:04.360]  is gonna be blown wide open tomorrow at this press conference that they're gonna
[20:04.360 --> 20:10.120]  have where it just confirms that Obama was running out of a secret office that
[20:10.120 --> 20:15.800]  they'd established under the White House in the bunker a program from July
[20:15.800 --> 20:19.960]  forward when they knew that Trump was the nominee to spy on him and undermine
[20:19.960 --> 20:22.720]  him and keep him from getting into office and once he got into office I'm
[20:22.720 --> 20:27.360]  gonna get rid of him now that's just more of the same I told everybody four
[20:27.360 --> 20:32.600]  years ago that Obama was spying on Trump before he got elected then we laid out
[20:32.600 --> 20:36.600]  how they were spying on him then we laid out about the FISA court first you
[20:36.600 --> 20:42.000]  would hear crickets when we put this out that's what we were being and I don't
[20:42.000 --> 20:46.200]  bring that up to say oh look we broke this first it's just to say now if Durham
[20:46.200 --> 20:54.320]  doesn't you died a bunch of people if this is Trump's October surprise simply
[20:54.320 --> 21:00.120]  coming out and saying oh look more documents more evidence they were doing
[21:00.120 --> 21:05.320]  this we know they were doing it a year and a half ago when this started to be
[21:05.320 --> 21:10.280]  totally confirmed clapper and Brennan that ran the criminal operation for
[21:10.280 --> 21:15.280]  Obama and Hillary came out and said we're not gonna get in trouble in
[21:15.280 --> 21:24.120]  Congress we were ordered by Obama to do this
[21:26.000 --> 21:32.440]  think about that and then still the Republicans asked G looks like Obama was
[21:32.440 --> 21:36.800]  illegally spying it's like look oh total proof big tech censoring big tech
[21:36.800 --> 21:43.520]  celebrates how they censor nationalist and patriots they're conquering us oh
[21:43.520 --> 21:48.600]  Congress has put out a year-long investigation that big tech has formed
[21:48.600 --> 21:52.640]  a monopoly and that they're working together in an oligopoly as a cartel
[21:52.640 --> 21:58.000]  really they help round up people in China and have their organs harvested
[21:58.000 --> 22:10.560]  yeah they're bad dudes they know they're bad Sundar Pachai Eric Schmidt Tim

[22:55.800 --> 22:59.840]  related to spy gate Hillary email scandal with no redactions but he's
[22:59.840 --> 23:04.520]  ordered stuff before and they just don't do it he told the military stop
[23:04.520 --> 23:09.560]  teaching that white people are inherently evil and the Secretary of Defense said
[23:09.560 --> 23:14.120]  no we're gonna keep doing it because their religion is that America is bad oh
[23:14.120 --> 23:21.760]  and the Communist Chinese are in the news today China North Korea Cuba Iran
[23:21.760 --> 23:27.320]  announced us for systemic racial discrimination China's the most racist

[23:31.120 --> 23:34.640]  people in death camps for their religious beliefs but that's okay because

[23:50.760 --> 23:55.560]  started the show with this I went for a little eight mile hike and there were
[23:55.560 --> 24:01.120]  guys rock climbing wearing masks when they were rock climbing so I was saying
[24:01.120 --> 24:04.320]  hey guys how's it going
[24:04.320 --> 24:11.800]  wearing a mask for COVID is like wearing a diaper to stop farts means it goes
[24:11.800 --> 24:14.040]  right through and some other rock climbers where we're shitting my hand
[24:14.040 --> 24:17.600]  and we're laughing and so I came by some more rock climbers was saying the same
[24:17.600 --> 24:20.720]  thing and I saw this old-looking dude with an old lady with mask on they look
[24:20.720 --> 24:24.680]  pissed they're about 30 feet away and I'm sitting there talking oh yeah I said
[24:24.680 --> 24:28.960]  it like another time maybe I'd said it five times total in the last couple
[24:28.960 --> 24:31.760]  minutes walking by do you know people are laughing they were getting photos oh
[24:31.760 --> 24:36.360]  it's the gay frog guy all of a sudden boom the guys dog bites me he goes good
[24:36.360 --> 24:40.040]  job so I grabbed that dog punched it twice in the head they go you hit our

[24:50.200 --> 24:56.640]  dog good job and when I grabbed it and punched it see it's all like a city it's
[24:56.640 --> 25:09.000]  all one way if that's who they are and I've got all these videos all these
[25:09.000 --> 25:12.680]  videos of them beating up women who aren't wearing masks down the streets of
[25:12.680 --> 25:17.840]  the US and Europe and all the rest of it and the police beating people up and
[25:17.840 --> 25:22.400]  that's all this was oh he's you're oh that guy's exercises first amendment he's
[25:22.400 --> 25:32.360]  standing out in a woodland canyon and I'm communicating with people I've been
[25:32.360 --> 25:36.720]  we talked about five and a half miles when that happened and I had only yelled
[25:36.720 --> 25:40.800]  out maybe three or four times before that when I saw people wearing masks hey
[25:40.800 --> 25:47.760]  wearing a mask for COVID is like wearing a diaper to stop farts it goes
[25:47.760 --> 25:55.560]  right through I'd say like wearing a mask for COVID is like wearing a diaper to
[25:55.560 --> 26:01.800]  stop farts it goes right through it's virtue signalling

[26:06.640 --> 26:10.880]  one lady with yellow hair orange hair like Ronald McDonald she saw us come in
[26:10.880 --> 26:14.720]  30 yards ahead jumped over and ran to the woods with her dog when she saw it was

[26:22.000 --> 26:25.920]  same thing and then again I get to the cliffs about a mile up I'm talking to
[26:25.920 --> 26:30.240]  folks shaking hands and this dude I saw him on 30 feet like looking at me with
[26:30.240 --> 26:33.080]  his wife they're like coming towards me even though I want another path they're
[26:33.080 --> 26:36.440]  on a higher path and he just comes down over the path I'm not really paying
[26:36.440 --> 26:41.120]  attention boom dog hits me so they're now setting it didn't bite me too bad it's
[26:41.120 --> 26:46.480]  over here I did follow police report not 9-1-1 3-1-1 because I know lip tarts
[26:46.480 --> 26:50.360]  man they're lying devils they probably call the police on me probably said I
[26:50.360 --> 26:54.240]  killed the dog and smeared blood all over my face and worship the devil this

[27:06.720 --> 27:10.960]  sellers but because of the COVID supply chain breakdown because there's 13
[27:10.960 --> 27:15.800]  different formulas in a pack power stack we are unable to secure it anymore
[27:15.800 --> 27:21.640]  this is the highest in a MPM pack system you're gonna find where you take half the
[27:21.640 --> 27:24.920]  pills in the morning half the capitals and pills and shell caps at night it's
[27:24.920 --> 27:28.280]  amazing I don't have time to go into everything that's in it but this gets
[27:28.280 --> 27:31.560]  people to remember to take it and that's why it's having such a great effect

[31:05.960 --> 31:09.240]  get into the really massive news with the communist Chinese and Bill Gates and
[31:09.240 --> 31:13.400]  everybody else just ganging up on America and the average American loves it
[31:13.400 --> 31:18.280]  and loves hating their own self-interest and hates love in their future and just
[31:18.280 --> 31:26.720]  absolutely hates themselves and it's really sad and sick to see that we're
[31:26.720 --> 31:30.440]  not totally rejecting the new old order totally rejecting the Democrats totally
[31:30.440 --> 31:38.360]  rejecting Hollywood totally rejecting all these bullies but we don't all right
[31:38.360 --> 31:46.520]  stay with us you are the one they called president I am kneel before
[31:46.520 --> 32:08.680]  you are not the president no one who leads so many could possibly kneel so
[32:08.680 --> 32:33.960]  quickly I'm the man they're protecting I'm the president
[32:33.960 --> 32:39.760]  president Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what
[32:39.760 --> 32:44.760]  he doesn't do that he's mean as a Wolverine
[32:51.280 --> 32:56.120]  it's 1159 at Radio Free America and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth
[32:56.120 --> 33:00.040]  until dawn right now I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in
[33:00.040 --> 33:05.080]  the occupied zone the chair is against the wall the chair is against the wall
[33:05.080 --> 33:10.960]  John has a long mustache John has a long mustache it's 12 o'clock American
[33:10.960 --> 33:15.040]  another day closer to victory and for all of you out there on a behind-the-line
[33:15.040 --> 33:18.720]  this is your song
[33:21.840 --> 33:25.640]  but they took a lot of people away people that they thought we're gonna make
[33:25.640 --> 33:29.160]  trouble for them people that had guns and things they wanted to just go away
[33:29.160 --> 33:34.280]  where we education camps that's what they call it so part of it we have to
[33:34.280 --> 33:38.080]  break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or
[33:38.080 --> 33:42.000]  kids along their families are recognized kids belong to whole communities I
[33:42.000 --> 33:50.800]  have decided we really need camps for adults and we need to have camps that you
[33:50.800 --> 33:55.120]  all run I mean really all persons of Japanese descent were required to
[33:55.120 --> 33:58.720]  register now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the
[33:58.720 --> 34:03.000]  army almost overnight had built assembly centers
[34:04.200 --> 34:08.600]  what kind of a situation in the US would you see that happening
[34:08.600 --> 34:16.200]  a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and
[34:16.200 --> 34:22.760]  the knowledge to to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques these
[34:22.760 --> 34:26.840]  people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're
[34:26.840 --> 34:31.640]  disloyal to the United States it's our right and our obligation to segregate
[34:31.640 --> 34:35.000]  them from the normal community
[34:39.160 --> 34:44.040]  is what we're doing here unless not kid about it with building a domestic army
[34:44.040 --> 34:50.080]  because the government is afraid of its own citizens put your gun down really
[34:50.080 --> 34:56.520]  rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty it's Alex
[34:56.520 --> 35:01.520]  Jones are you some kind of a constitutionalist
[35:01.520 --> 35:09.120]  so these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not nothing more than
[35:09.120 --> 35:13.840]  domestic terrorists if you are receiving this transmission you are the
[35:13.840 --> 35:28.120]  resistance
[35:28.120 --> 35:33.880]  planet Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does what he
[35:33.880 --> 35:54.800]  doesn't do that he's mean as a Wolverine
[35:54.800 --> 36:00.040]  I'm watching the midterms then you would think our country is Mad Max
[36:00.040 --> 36:04.200]  Thunder don't this guy is like they're coming from Guatemala they're coming
[36:04.200 --> 36:06.880]  from Mexico
[36:06.880 --> 36:30.600]  there's a liberal mob that's coming
[36:36.880 --> 36:52.760]  and then you would think everybody in the country's is like to the bunker
[36:58.640 --> 37:04.980]  hello Americans I'm Paul Harvey if I were the devil if I were the Prince of
[37:04.980 --> 37:08.880]  Darkness I'd want to engulf the whole world in darkness and I'd have a third
[37:08.880 --> 37:12.720]  of its real estate and for bits of its population but I wouldn't be happy until
[37:12.720 --> 37:19.520]  I had seized the ripest apple on the tree so I said about however necessary to
[37:19.520 --> 37:26.760]  take over the United States I'd subvert the churches first I'd begin with a
[37:26.760 --> 37:30.680]  campaign of whispers with the wisdom of the serpent I would whisper to you as I
[37:30.680 --> 37:34.680]  whispered to you do as you please to the young I would whisper that the Bible
[37:34.680 --> 37:38.680]  of myth I would convince them that man created God instead of the other way
[37:38.680 --> 37:43.720]  around I would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is square and the
[37:43.720 --> 37:50.160]  old I would teach to pray after me our father which art in Washington and then
[37:50.160 --> 37:54.560]  I'd get organized I'd educate authors in how to make the Lord literature exciting
[37:54.560 --> 37:58.280]  so that anything else would appear dull and uninteresting I'd threaten TV with
[37:58.280 --> 38:02.680]  dirtier movies and vice versa I'd pedal narcotics to whom I could I'd sell
[38:02.680 --> 38:06.880]  alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction I'd tranquilize the rest
[38:06.880 --> 38:12.040]  with pills if I were the devil I'd soon have families at war with themselves
[38:12.040 --> 38:16.880]  churches at war with themselves and nations at war with themselves until
[38:16.880 --> 38:22.280]  each in its turn was consumed and with promises of higher ratings I'd have
[38:22.280 --> 38:28.560]  mesmerizing media fanning the plane the president of the United States is racist
[38:28.560 --> 38:32.360]  if I were the devil I would encourage schools to refine young intellects but
[38:32.360 --> 38:39.640]  in a decade I'd have prisons overflowing I have judges promoting
[38:39.640 --> 38:43.760]  pornography soon I could evict God from the courthouse then from the school
[38:43.760 --> 38:47.600]  house and then from the houses of Congress and in his own churches I
[38:47.600 --> 38:53.240]  would substitute psychology for addiction I would lure priests and pastors
[38:53.240 --> 38:58.240]  into misusing boys and girls and church money if I were the devil I'd take from
[38:58.240 --> 39:03.160]  those who have and give to those who wanted until I had killed the incentive
[39:03.160 --> 39:08.720]  of the ambitious I would caution against extremes I'm here to warn people you
[39:08.720 --> 39:13.320]  keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game in hard work in patriotism in
[39:13.320 --> 39:18.120]  moral conduct I would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned that
[39:18.120 --> 39:23.440]  swinging is more fun that what you see on TV is the way to be and thus I could
[39:23.440 --> 39:29.360]  undress you in public and I could lure you into bed with diseases for which
[39:29.360 --> 39:33.760]  there is no cure in other words why were the devil I just keep right on doing
[39:33.760 --> 39:36.360]  what he's doing
[39:36.360 --> 39:57.040]  we've now entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible
[39:57.040 --> 40:01.320]  and it's killing millions of people via starvation but the good news is it's
[40:01.320 --> 40:06.800]  caused a planetary awakening as well the general public all over the planet
[40:06.800 --> 40:12.000]  hate Bill Gates he's the most unpopular person on earth people know he's not a
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.160]  doctor people know he's a eugenicist the population knows that his vaccines that
[40:17.160 --> 40:20.520]  he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses polio
[40:20.520 --> 40:25.240]  steroids and more it's even in the associated press so now they are
[40:25.240 --> 40:29.440]  beginning to understand that we the people know that there is a corporate
[40:29.440 --> 40:34.080]  global government and the beast top-tech billionaires sit in meetings and decide
[40:34.080 --> 40:38.560]  to pull the type of race war scams the coronavirus scams that we're witnessing
[40:38.560 --> 40:44.000]  so remember that and let them know that we know who they are and what they've
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.040]  done and we hold them responsible for the collapse of civilization they are the
[40:49.040 --> 40:55.280]  enemies of humanity they want you dead the globalists are very very honest
[40:55.280 --> 41:01.640]  about their planetary goals they want private corporate governance above
[41:01.640 --> 41:07.120]  nation-states above religious institutions above the family they want
[41:07.120 --> 41:12.080]  total corporate power there was a great film back in the early 1970s called
[41:12.080 --> 41:19.400]  rollerball with James Kahn it's based on a novel set in the year 2020 and in the
[41:19.400 --> 41:23.600]  book you have mega-corporates that control the planet there are no longer
[41:23.600 --> 41:29.640]  nation-states there are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations
[41:29.640 --> 41:34.000]  if you actually read what the most group of the CFR and the Lionel Commission
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.560]  say in the year 2020 that is their in game that is their goal so we're talking
[41:39.560 --> 41:45.240]  about a hunger games type scenario here run by very very very ruthless people see
[41:45.240 --> 41:49.880]  us as shadow they're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy communist China
[41:49.880 --> 41:57.040]  as their model we must reject it now and perhaps most cruelly of all if
[41:57.040 --> 42:02.360]  Donald Trump has his way the complications from COVID-19 which are
[42:02.360 --> 42:09.440]  well beyond what they should be it's estimated that 200 million people have
[42:09.440 --> 42:15.600]  died 200 million people have died probably by the time I finish this talk
[42:15.600 --> 42:20.600]  right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than 60% of America has
[42:20.600 --> 42:25.080]  died from COVID-19 when it's not even 200,000 reality he would want to say 6
[42:25.080 --> 42:29.320]  million have lung scarring and heart damage it's all made up but you know
[42:29.320 --> 42:32.160]  where you got it the mainstream media that continues to actually say things
[42:32.160 --> 42:38.400]  like that they said that 4% of America would be dead already of course it's
[42:38.400 --> 42:43.200]  point zero zero zero zero and then add a number because the numbers vary it's a
[42:43.200 --> 42:48.960]  real virus just like people being struck by lightning is real but to shut down

[45:37.160 --> 45:40.720]  just trying to control myself right now and if I sound like a primadonna little

[45:50.280 --> 45:54.440]  time in history and they put up with so many outside attacks and so many
[45:54.440 --> 45:58.920]  obstacles and so many things to shut us down from taking our servers to our
[45:58.920 --> 46:04.440]  sponsors to our bank accounts to our the DNC lawsuits and we're not victims
[46:04.440 --> 46:09.280]  we're badasses on the cutting-edge slaughtering the new older lies we are
[46:09.280 --> 46:14.240]  just devastating them info wars is the champion against the enemy and it's
[46:14.240 --> 46:18.520]  that realization it's why I get mad that's why David Knight made me feel so
[46:18.520 --> 46:21.520]  good when he was on air yesterday with us he said listen he said the way I'd do
[46:21.520 --> 46:25.560]  this I don't have another heart attack yes because he gets upset too is David's
[46:25.560 --> 46:29.000]  usually subdued you notice he was wild as I am now because man this is Mark of
[46:29.000 --> 46:35.640]  the Beast total satanic takeover it's real God almighty and I just see all
[46:35.640 --> 46:39.560]  these people going along with it pisses me off but David said Alex off air in
[46:39.560 --> 46:44.560]  honor he said I just God spoke to me and I've got to just be a soldier and God's
[46:44.560 --> 46:49.160]  the boss and I just follow the orders and trust in God it's so true oh God
[46:49.160 --> 46:54.240]  please we trust in you because it's it's I know you're all the same that's why
[46:54.240 --> 46:58.600]  so many veterans commit suicide so many people give up because they feel like
[46:58.600 --> 47:02.360]  it's their fault and they feel like they can't be strong enough we are not
[47:02.360 --> 47:07.160]  strong enough only God can get us through this and when I'm talking about
[47:07.160 --> 47:11.560]  myself it's because I'm talking myself down from getting really pissed off and
[47:11.560 --> 47:15.640]  it's the truth it's not me preaching at you but I know you're feeling the same
[47:15.640 --> 47:20.960]  way everybody I talked to is this is unbelievable I mean Bill Gates literally
[47:20.960 --> 47:27.160]  is coming out with a mRNA vaccine that literally reprograms every cell in your
[47:27.160 --> 47:32.640]  body and they admit it's super deadly I mean this is crazy

[51:29.560 --> 51:33.640]  what I'm doing I mean the truth is it's a verbal demonstration of the spirit of
[51:33.640 --> 51:37.400]  what is about to happen I mean they're coming for humanity they tell us this
[51:37.400 --> 51:42.480]  is to hurt us so we got products that are incredible I mean I'm not the

[51:54.520 --> 51:58.960]  didn't take one or son I'd get sick like everybody else does and I'll tell you
[51:58.960 --> 52:01.440]  before I started taking these supplements that we developed with top
[52:01.440 --> 52:06.360]  researchers eight years ago I was fatter than I am now and wasn't as healthy
[52:06.360 --> 52:12.240]  and did not have the libido that I have now I have the libido my libido is better
[52:12.240 --> 52:17.360]  than when I was 16 years old because I didn't have all the stuff I was 16 I
[52:17.360 --> 52:22.280]  wouldn't take in pure iodine that's clean I wouldn't take in PQQ and CoQ10
[52:22.280 --> 52:29.760]  and I mean I'm a jack rabbit I'm just telling you so this stuff's real okay
[52:29.760 --> 52:33.320]  and that's why they don't want it your food and your water they want the
[52:33.320 --> 52:38.760]  opposite of it in your water fluoride's the opposite of iodine literally so we
[52:38.760 --> 52:42.960]  run off selenium we run off iodine now you got to be careful with this stuff
[52:42.960 --> 52:48.000]  this is this is like nitrous oxide in a race car okay but when I remember to
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.120]  take it I'm healthy my dreams are better everything fish oil best fish oil

[54:14.800 --> 54:18.640]  will you can feel it pouring in and trying to just use the blood of the
[54:18.640 --> 54:24.800]  innocence to power its satanic engine I can feel God's spirit just absolutely
[54:24.800 --> 54:28.960]  pouring even more power in and it's unbelievable but frankly that's it my
[54:28.960 --> 54:33.840]  engine's got too many horsepower and I know yours does as well we've got to
[54:33.840 --> 54:37.280]  learn how to deal with this and contend with the enemy and just pray the name of
[54:37.280 --> 54:40.840]  Jesus Christ that all the new older systems be destroyed and they all be
[54:40.840 --> 54:45.400]  punished they all be thrown in the lake of hell the Bible talks about there being
[54:45.400 --> 54:50.200]  10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power
[54:50.200 --> 54:55.920]  unto the one world leader the Antichrist and he has a beast system that no one
[54:55.920 --> 55:00.120]  could buy and or sell unless he has that marked in the forehead or in the palm of
[55:00.120 --> 55:05.560]  their hand and we look back on all the warnings you were given and all just a
[55:05.560 --> 55:10.600]  common sense that you don't believe in God or prophecy giving governments a
[55:10.600 --> 55:15.240]  corporation the power to control who can buy and who can sell to track everything
[55:15.240 --> 55:19.880]  we do he's not just a recipe it's a blueprint for total enslavement and now
[55:19.880 --> 55:23.480]  you look at Bill Gates you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say
[55:23.480 --> 55:28.560]  we're technocrats we should decide how much salt you get how much alcohol you
[55:28.560 --> 55:32.600]  get how much red meat you get we're technocrats we know best we're now
[55:32.600 --> 55:36.160]  gonna set up the economy with a social score to totally control you you snap
[55:36.160 --> 55:40.920]  your fingers we're here they're just rolling it out and a lot of people are
[55:40.920 --> 55:44.280]  complying with it it's insane
[55:44.680 --> 55:49.560]  computer research scientists engineers working with attorneys have
[55:49.560 --> 55:53.880]  conclusively proven and put out the failed reports at Tablet magazine
[55:53.880 --> 55:58.320]  documenting what any trained eye could already see as plain as day
[55:58.320 --> 56:03.240]  communist Chinese working in tandem with the United Nations and the Democratic
[56:03.240 --> 56:07.800]  Party in the United States as well as the media put out fake videos and total
[56:07.800 --> 56:12.840]  hysteria to make it look like day of the dead into the world in China earlier
[56:12.840 --> 56:16.680]  this year then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the
[56:16.680 --> 56:21.120]  West locked down when China reopened within three months this is the greatest
[56:21.120 --> 56:27.800]  strategic ever this is 21st century warfare being carried out through
[56:27.800 --> 56:31.960]  psychological means for the ultimate style Paul Joseph Watson has written
[56:31.960 --> 56:36.200]  about it in full wars dot com myself Alex Jones David I know and Troy are
[56:36.200 --> 56:40.120]  covering this heavily this is the way to bring down the globalist is exposing
[56:40.120 --> 56:44.760]  how communist China the UN were behind the hysteria
[56:44.760 --> 57:13.000]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.920]  ladies and gentlemen we are back we're in our number two Jason Goodman said
[57:17.920 --> 57:22.200]  amazing investigative journalist crowdsourcetruth.com close for next 30
[57:22.200 --> 57:26.360]  minutes then we have a thought criminal and his lawyer joining us where you get
[57:26.360 --> 57:29.880]  yelled at screamed at kicked out of school if you say you like Trump that's
[57:29.880 --> 57:33.560]  coming up but Jason Goodman has been shooting these viral videos where he
[57:33.560 --> 57:37.600]  walks around in New York and shows the boarded up nature of it the kind of
[57:37.600 --> 57:41.720]  apocalyptic nature of it some stations don't carry this segment some stations
[57:41.720 --> 57:47.000]  do but so we need to meet of this in the next two segments but Jason Goodman
[57:47.000 --> 57:53.600]  what how would you define the time we're in right now with 26 days out and and
[57:53.600 --> 57:57.240]  just the energy level of the left we're seeing plus the energy level we're
[57:57.240 --> 58:00.920]  seeing from humanity and the huge I see an awakening where people really get
[58:00.920 --> 58:06.160]  it's good versus evil what's your view on this time we're in I'm with you on
[58:06.160 --> 58:09.720]  that Alex I mean you know what's happened to New York over the past seven
[58:09.720 --> 58:15.480]  months has been really devastating and depressing and you know Michelle Obama
[58:15.480 --> 58:20.840]  had a YouTube video out last night actually somebody I know was the
[58:20.840 --> 58:25.240]  cinematographer for that posting about on Instagram but they're trying to
[58:25.240 --> 58:30.360]  convince us that these protests are mostly peaceful and I mean Alex to me
[58:30.360 --> 58:34.680]  that's like saying Jeffrey Domler was mostly peaceful I mean he was sleeping
[58:34.680 --> 58:39.280]  he was you know he's only killing people a certain amount of time but it's that
[58:39.280 --> 58:43.800]  small portion of time where they're not peaceful that all this destruction is
[58:43.800 --> 58:47.480]  happening around the city now I'm approaching Fifth Avenue right now and
[58:47.480 --> 58:52.000]  I just want your viewers to see this is one of the most famous shopping
[58:52.000 --> 58:58.680]  districts in the entire world and Alex so many stores it looks like Caracas it
[58:58.680 --> 59:04.240]  looks like Caracas yeah I mean it's it's it's gonna be a disaster and you know
[59:04.240 --> 59:10.160]  we've got now coming from Mayor de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo they're
[59:10.160 --> 59:14.640]  talking about a potential reshut down they've just opened restaurants for
[59:14.640 --> 59:19.680]  indoor dining I think yesterday or two days ago and they're already threatening
[59:19.680 --> 59:25.480]  to shut them back down we can see across the street here retail for rent
[59:25.480 --> 59:30.840]  Eisenberg sandwich shop that's a famous diner that's totally closed this photo
[59:30.840 --> 59:36.600]  place is closed yeah they got great sandwiches yeah right I mean that's
[59:36.600 --> 59:42.400]  like been here forever you know all these places are papered up boarded up for
[59:42.400 --> 59:47.960]  rent these are these are premium flagship retail locations that there are
[59:47.960 --> 59:52.600]  just so many of them now that are unrented and who would want to open a
[59:52.600 --> 59:56.280]  premium retail location in the city where frankly most people with good
[59:56.280 --> 1:00:01.680]  reason are fearful of leaving their homes I've been assaulted so many times
[1:00:01.680 --> 1:00:06.480]  whether it's by homeless people who are becoming increasingly desperate or black
[1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:11.280]  lives matter and antifa supporters who just take one look at me and say I look
[1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:16.880]  like a troll I think they mean I look like somebody who was porch then you
[1:00:16.880 --> 1:00:20.200]  know one of the minions who would go out and destroy these shops in the name of
[1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:26.040]  whatever it is they think but I mean it's really upsetting Alex it sure is and
[1:00:26.040 --> 1:00:28.920]  I've seen some of your videos and others have done them you can walk around for
[1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:34.520]  hours in any direction and it's the same the same other worldliness of all of
[1:00:34.520 --> 1:00:37.680]  this when we come back in a minute I want to get into what's the end game how
[1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:39.840]  do you think it's going over the deep state with their attempt to hold this
[1:00:39.840 --> 1:00:43.480]  hostage but what are the average New Yorkers saying are they still buying
[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:48.320]  into this garbage you know I know a lot of people who are leaving I see moving
[1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:53.200]  trucks around all over just when I left my apartment there's a giant moving
[1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:56.640]  truck yesterday when I went into the elevator in the apartment building one
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:01:00.400]  of my neighbors they were moving guys you know wrapping up all the bedding and
[1:01:00.400 --> 1:01:05.320]  everything and taking it out so people are leaving the tax bases are rotting
[1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:10.400]  businesses aren't paying taxes people aren't going to restaurants it's a
[1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:17.400]  disaster unmitigated disaster and what's crazy is I've seen de Blasio the
[1:01:17.400 --> 1:01:20.600]  mayor and I've seen the governor say keep wearing your mask you're gonna wear
[1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:23.600]  your mask and they all get caught not wearing their mask when that when the
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:28.080]  cameras are off they think we're gonna come back and talk about where all this
[1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:32.600]  goes oh by the way the mayor of LA still saying we'll give you money if you
[1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:35.760]  catch somebody having a party at their house but but then all the big tech guys
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:39.360]  still have their parties they don't get in trouble and now the governor says put
[1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:42.960]  your mask on and off in between bites of food and of course wear your mask during
[1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:47.800]  the act of sex we'll be right back this is a cult seeing how much we'll do when
[1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:51.360]  I order it
[1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:56.240]  for more than a hundred years the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to
[1:01:56.240 --> 1:02:00.840]  establish world government abolish nation-states dumb down the population
[1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:04.640]  by taking control of education and most importantly taking control of Western
[1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:10.280]  medicine now they had a bad name by the 1920s they started converting over and
[1:02:10.280 --> 1:02:15.280]  funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:21.600]  eugenics operations fast forward to the 1980s the baton is handed by IBM via his
[1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:26.000]  mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates the third his father of course
[1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:29.360]  being ahead of Planned Parenthood and now he's been able to position himself
[1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:35.080]  over almost every health department in the world every national health system
[1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:40.240]  Bill Gates is in control they have spent a hundred plus years getting
[1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:44.640]  positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in
[1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:48.120]  your body this is the holy grail of their operations and now they're
[1:02:48.120 --> 1:02:53.480]  normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:07.560]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's Alex Jones you keep saying you've
[1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:18.320]  got something for me something you call love but confess you've been a mess
[1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:26.000]  where you shouldn't have been a mess and now someone else is getting all your
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:32.000]  best these boots are made for walking these boots are made for walking and
[1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:38.320]  that's just what they'll do when I get a journalist Jason Goodman has had a lot
[1:03:38.320 --> 1:03:42.600]  of big viral reports as he walks around poor areas rich areas the fanciest
[1:03:42.600 --> 1:03:50.560]  areas doesn't matter of the once great big Apple I've never liked LA I'd like
[1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:54.160]  me or both people say oh New York's okay I like to feel New York I like all the
[1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:58.280]  shops I like the museums I like I like the action and it was you know I remember
[1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:01.080]  when I was younger it was really bad under Democrats got better under Giuliani
[1:04:01.080 --> 1:04:05.640]  had problems with Juliana still but now it just looks like a third world hell
[1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:11.720]  hole Jason Goodman of crowd source the truth calm has been walking around and
[1:04:11.720 --> 1:04:14.920]  put these viral videos out showing how it's totally broken down how it's
[1:04:14.920 --> 1:04:19.760]  falling apart and he's gonna tell us what he thinks is really behind this
[1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:22.680]  attempt to hold all the blue states of blue cities hostage we know they want to
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:27.800]  hurt the economy blaming on Trump as even Bill Morris said but it seems to be
[1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:32.520]  hurting them people are seeing through it with big Mike aka Michelle Obama in
[1:04:32.520 --> 1:04:35.600]  that speech you talked about earlier last night she called her closing
[1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:39.560]  argument said we're gonna reopen things Trump kept it closed you want the
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:43.360]  economy come back so do we I mean everything she says is an inversion of
[1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:46.720]  truth you're out there Jason Goodman for TV viewers they can see it as you walk
[1:04:46.720 --> 1:04:50.840]  around but but again describe what you're witnessing and then why do you
[1:04:50.840 --> 1:04:55.040]  think they're doing it even though it looks like it's backfired yeah well
[1:04:55.040 --> 1:04:58.720]  Alex right now I'm standing right here on a world-famous Fifth Avenue this is
[1:04:58.720 --> 1:05:02.720]  one of the most exclusive shopping districts not just in New York but
[1:05:02.720 --> 1:05:06.920]  people used to travel from countries all over to just come here and I mean you
[1:05:06.920 --> 1:05:11.160]  can see the garbage behind me this this place here appears to be under
[1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:14.720]  construction I don't know if they're just clearing it out for the real estate
[1:05:14.720 --> 1:05:18.680]  company that owns it Joe Rogan would be happy that they're saying psychedelic
[1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:22.880]  medicine is here I don't know what that's about but there's garbage everywhere
[1:05:22.880 --> 1:05:28.520]  major stores along Fifth Avenue totally closed we can see right next to Sephora
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:34.440]  there's a store for rent over there all of these places are closed is one after
[1:05:34.440 --> 1:05:39.040]  the other this was a clothing store here we had a pizza place right next to it
[1:05:39.040 --> 1:05:44.080]  closed graffiti everywhere I know a lot of people who haven't been to New York
[1:05:44.080 --> 1:05:49.080]  expect that there's graffiti everywhere but I can tell you Alex this is not the
[1:05:49.080 --> 1:05:54.440]  way it was certainly not on Fifth Avenue this fry store is closed yeah New
[1:05:54.440 --> 1:05:58.440]  York I've been about what five six years ago it was still a pretty clean nice
[1:05:58.440 --> 1:06:01.920]  city it wasn't like it was so it's not interrupt Alex but we've got a Karen
[1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:05.040]  right here who just attracted my attention because she doesn't want to be
[1:06:05.040 --> 1:06:09.120]  filmed I was walking down the street minding my own business when you
[1:06:09.120 --> 1:06:12.320]  attracted my attention
[1:06:12.320 --> 1:06:17.760]  they all just look for trouble I had a Karen asking me why I'm not wearing a
[1:06:17.760 --> 1:06:23.080]  mask we'll go back to ask sick a dog on me go ahead doctor yeah the reason I'm
[1:06:23.080 --> 1:06:28.040]  not wearing a mask ma'am is because I'm not an idiot and it's my right to walk
[1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:34.280]  around breathing air why are you wearing a mask why did you attract my
[1:06:34.280 --> 1:06:38.360]  attention I'm not sick no one's gonna get sick from me Keller wearing masks to
[1:06:38.360 --> 1:06:44.920]  stop covid's like wearing diapers to stop farts yeah I'm walking down the
[1:06:44.920 --> 1:06:48.760]  street I wasn't filming you until you attracted my attention now you know have
[1:06:48.760 --> 1:06:54.120]  have have you ever farted and smelled it because it's coming thicker than that
[1:06:54.120 --> 1:06:58.200]  because you've attracted my attention and you're irritating me I'm walking down
[1:06:58.200 --> 1:07:02.640]  the street minding my own business Alex this is this is terrible this is what's
[1:07:02.640 --> 1:07:07.640]  happened I can't leave my apartment without being accosted either by a woman
[1:07:07.640 --> 1:07:13.120]  like that which it always seems to be these like nosy skinny white women who
[1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:17.680]  want to tell me what to do or black lives matter people might have seen just a
[1:07:17.680 --> 1:07:21.600]  week no you're right the stereotype of middle-aged white women nothing is
[1:07:21.600 --> 1:07:24.960]  middle-aged white women but it's a certain subtype literally believe that
[1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:28.440]  they're supposed to run everything I never vape but I've seen how they how
[1:07:28.440 --> 1:07:32.680]  they vape it can blow through the mass showing that they're a fraud right
[1:07:32.680 --> 1:07:37.280]  that's that's a nicotine oh my god this is horrible but anyways let me let me
[1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:40.920]  just let me just illustrate this for folks about the mask okay a I can breathe
[1:07:40.920 --> 1:07:47.080]  through the mask sorry I'm not good at these masks a I can breathe through the
[1:07:47.080 --> 1:07:50.840]  mask and I can breathe out what you
[1:07:51.320 --> 1:08:00.000]  doesn't work see watch yeah see that I mean this is crazy sorry keep keep going
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:03.840]  well I've already been accosted by one Karen because you're a slave out walking
[1:08:03.840 --> 1:08:08.160]  around right now here's a place that was closed but they weren't satisfied that
[1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:12.640]  was close I have to smash the window so now the building owner has to deal with
[1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:17.080]  that I don't know why they think these are victimless crimes there are people
[1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:20.680]  who own these buildings take out big loans to be able to rent them and make
[1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:25.480]  money we're gonna you ask me why I think it's happening well I think this is a
[1:08:25.480 --> 1:08:32.880]  classic economic warfare tactic that was used with a project Phoenix or
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:37.560]  Operation Phoenix in Vietnam where you scare the civilian population you
[1:08:37.560 --> 1:08:42.840]  destroy the business climate property values plumb it oligarchs buy up all
[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:47.080]  this stuff and in 10 or 20 years it'll come back to somebody else owning it
[1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:52.160]  who's not the people who are here right now and that woman attracting my
[1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:56.720]  attention over it where did we get this culture of everybody has to do stuff to
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:00.400]  protect everybody else all these people driving cars they're putting car
[1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:04.400]  synogenic particles into the atmosphere that are increasing my likelihood of
[1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:08.040]  getting sick every one of them should get out of their car and buy an electric
[1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:12.760]  car or take the bus or do something I mean what about people who are smoking I
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:16.400]  see people walking down the street with masks they said you're really impressive
[1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:21.560]  you just said it everything is toxic in life we have to have tradeouts we have
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:26.080]  to get progressively better but they're a sabotaging civilization like prop 65
[1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:30.240]  in California creating expectations are impossible so they can be the the
[1:09:30.240 --> 1:09:35.480]  monitors the hall monitors the wardens of all the infighting and all the snitching
[1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:39.640]  and all the garbage that's our future that's what the mask or about is getting
[1:09:39.640 --> 1:09:44.040]  us all fighting with each other I think so and that woman's falling for it she
[1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:49.080]  told me she told me before not to film her now does that mean that I've seen
[1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:52.480]  her on a previous day and she told me that and she thinks that I remember who
[1:09:52.480 --> 1:09:57.240]  she is I never saw that one before that I can recall but it makes no sense to me
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:10:01.840]  like that is a unwise thing to do she wants to be a victim that's the whole
[1:10:01.840 --> 1:10:06.640]  left's deal they come look I have people today come to me 30 plus feet with a dog
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:13.560]  because I was giving a speech to rock climbers who were up on a 200 foot wall
[1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:17.560]  wearing mask and they were laughing hi Alex okay huh and the guy came and
[1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:22.360]  released his dog and it bit me on the arm whoa yeah these people this this
[1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:28.000]  happened like three two hours ago holy cow I mean that's crazy obviously that
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.200]  you could get sick you're injured you got bit by a dog he told that he told
[1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:38.520]  the dog good job when it bit me wow god what mean this that's crazy Alex I'm
[1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:41.520]  sorry to hear that that happened all right I mean it didn't bleed too much the
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:45.680]  point is is that is that is that I as the dog bit me I grabbed it by the year and
[1:10:45.680 --> 1:10:49.120]  picked it up it was like a 60 pound dog and I and like I said that I went oh
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:53.040]  really you're it's a good dog about that so I I gave the dog a lot worse than it
[1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:57.160]  gave me so but but you know you see my arm you'll see the dog but he shows
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:02.040]  their craziness that he came over with the dog and told it to get me that's
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:07.120]  terrible but this is type of animosity it's just breeding everywhere I mean you
[1:11:07.120 --> 1:11:10.520]  know the smartest thing for that woman to do if she was afraid that whatever is
[1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:14.040]  coming out of my mouth might make her sick you just allow me to continue down
[1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:16.800]  the street and mind her own business I'm six feet away from all these people
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:21.400]  obviously you're the plague carrier of the Chinese virus she should just get
[1:11:21.400 --> 1:11:25.960]  away from you exactly she drew my attention and that's not the first time
[1:11:25.960 --> 1:11:31.040]  that happened Alex I pity these people I think they're victims of cognitive
[1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:35.040]  dissonance you know mind control from the media like you said Michelle Obama
[1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:39.960]  last night everything she was saying was the exact opposite of the truth
[1:11:39.960 --> 1:11:45.280]  Trump wants to open up the city I think if anybody is afraid of getting hit by a
[1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:50.720]  car or mugged or getting sick from another person they should stay home
[1:11:50.720 --> 1:11:55.040]  they should put on a mask but if you're healthy and if you're willing to accept
[1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:58.920]  the risks I could trip and fall off this curb crack my skull get hit by a taxi
[1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:02.120]  anything could happen if you're willing to accept that's right and that's the
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:05.800]  lawyers they got rid of diving boards now the pools are three feet deep they're
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:09.240]  getting rid of jungle gyms everything's being gotten rid of because it's
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:11.920]  dangerous now they're getting rid of vaginal birth because there might be a
[1:12:11.920 --> 1:12:17.520]  problem even though statistically the cesareans more dangerous wow yeah I mean
[1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:21.680]  I don't know I think people should become more responsible for themselves and
[1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:25.360]  worry about what they're doing and and just let everybody else peacefully
[1:12:25.360 --> 1:12:28.160]  coexist I totally agree one of these people think they're gonna do is the
[1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:32.320]  depression this is triggering deepens if Trump is unable and if we're unable to
[1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:36.200]  reopen the economy I guess Jason Goodman is with us on this live October

[1:13:27.960 --> 1:13:31.560]  gonna take action once reelected against big tech and then he's modern
[1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:34.360]  situation well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so we're gonna

[1:14:52.040 --> 1:15:01.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:10.720]  it seemed like yesterday you can walk down the street without contact tracers
[1:15:10.720 --> 1:15:15.800]  not wear a mask but it was long ago
[1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:23.000]  but it was long ago 213 days ago and now Bill Gates has come out and said the
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:29.320]  lockdown never ends and we need to quote reduced vaccine hesitancy
[1:15:29.320 --> 1:15:33.920]  wow Jason Goodman crowd source the truth comms our guest couple join us again
[1:15:33.920 --> 1:15:36.920]  for a longer segment to walk around New York and illustrate things this has been
[1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:42.080]  powerful we know what this is about remember Obama five years ago he went to
[1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:45.600]  South America and he went to Africa and he said you can't have cars and air
[1:15:45.600 --> 1:15:49.160]  conditioning for the earth but of course he has a jumbo jet and 14 million
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:54.360]  dollar palace on the beach and so that's what this really is is the
[1:15:54.360 --> 1:15:57.840]  establishment showing us hey we took everything over we can cut stuff off this
[1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:00.960]  is called siege and I think people need to realize it's predatory what do you
[1:16:00.960 --> 1:16:05.520]  say Jason Goodman absolutely Alex I mean all you need to do is look around I
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:10.160]  don't understand how Michelle Obama can produce a video last night saying that
[1:16:10.160 --> 1:16:14.880]  these are mostly peaceful protests what I see is the remnants of destruction
[1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:21.680]  around the city and you know this mostly thing I was a in count I encountered a
[1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:25.880]  group of Black Lives Matter supporters who were not permitted this was last
[1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:30.160]  week they were blocking 42nd Street which is a major road in New York City
[1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:34.680]  that's not a peaceful protest because what if somebody needs to get through
[1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:38.560]  there in an ambulance and when I asked them do you guys have a permit for this
[1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:45.160]  where the cops they surrounded me accosted me assaulted me smacked my camera
[1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:50.280]  broke one of my cell phones that's not peaceful I think that the news the
[1:16:50.280 --> 1:16:55.280]  mainstream news feels like if you're not shooting someone or actively burning
[1:16:55.280 --> 1:16:59.440]  down a building everything else is peaceful but that's not correct we're
[1:16:59.440 --> 1:17:03.680]  approaching Washington Square Park right now Alex and I want to well I don't know
[1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:07.560]  if we can show this to your viewers because it's foul language spray painted at
[1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:13.800]  the foot of George Washington on the Washington Square Park right here and
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:19.520]  for all the technology we have in New York City and all the Black Lives Matter
[1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:24.000]  banners that have been painted on the street since this occurred I don't know
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:29.040]  what they're doing in this forklift but they're not removing the F-12 graffiti
[1:17:29.040 --> 1:17:38.160]  here at the feet it's disgraceful they are I mean they are a Marxist Bolshevik
[1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:44.120]  group being given free reign yes and you know the park is a little bit more
[1:17:44.120 --> 1:17:48.360]  under control certainly than it was a few weeks ago I don't know if you saw my
[1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:53.320]  encounter with the homeless vagrant who was living in the fountain there and I
[1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:57.040]  tell you something else Alex there's a certain I've lived in New York City I was
[1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:01.360]  born in New York City grew up you know the suburbs and have lived in Manhattan
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:07.040]  for 30 years there is a certain type to homeless people in New York and I don't
[1:18:07.040 --> 1:18:13.440]  mean race I don't mean anything but it is not young healthy-looking white people
[1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:19.600]  with fresh clothes it's usually people black or white or any color with clothes
[1:18:19.600 --> 1:18:23.560]  that they look like they've been wearing for months so I've been noticing
[1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:29.760]  around town younger cleaner-looking people sleeping on suitcases homeless
[1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:34.720]  people don't have suitcases and as I said the park is relatively calm compared
[1:18:34.720 --> 1:18:39.560]  to what it's been but very on guard to be homeless they've set it up to have
[1:18:39.560 --> 1:18:42.800]  crime in the streets this is simply to demoralize us and bring the country down
[1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:47.520]  they admit that yes and we've got anarchy symbols painted all over the place I
[1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:52.400]  don't know this is one I haven't exactly seen before but graffitis rampant you
[1:18:52.400 --> 1:18:57.240]  know petty crime is happening all over the place you know even people who maybe
[1:18:57.240 --> 1:19:02.360]  wouldn't be criminals feel emboldened to start fights and arguments and you know
[1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:07.640]  they're arguing at the cops nothing is happening when they get thrown in jail
[1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:13.440]  they get out the next day you know I was assaulted in this park I walked about
[1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:18.080]  a hundred feet over to an NYPD officer who was standing by the arch and I said
[1:19:18.080 --> 1:19:22.320]  I was assaulted by that guy over there the officer asked me if I had called 911
[1:19:22.320 --> 1:19:27.440]  and I was like wait you're standing right here can't you do anything and they
[1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:31.640]  would not do anything so I gotta be honest it's not safe right now in New
[1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:34.920]  York City this is the breakdown of law this is the breakdown of law and order
[1:19:34.920 --> 1:19:39.480]  how do you think this whole martial law siege is going for the globalist are
[1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:44.600]  they getting what they wanted I have to say I think that President Trump has
[1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:49.640]  been playing it very smart so far you know not having a heavy hand come in
[1:19:49.640 --> 1:19:55.280]  it's amazing to me that these Democrat run cities are refusing to help that we
[1:19:55.280 --> 1:19:59.560]  obviously need I mean the impression that I get from NYPD because most of them
[1:19:59.560 --> 1:20:02.920]  won't speak to me and I understand they can't do that they have their orders but
[1:20:02.920 --> 1:20:05.720]  the impression that I get is that they've been deliberately told to stand
[1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:10.440]  down I mean why would a police officer not walk a hundred feet to where an
[1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:15.240]  assault occurred and at least find out what's going on maybe do an arrest they
[1:20:15.240 --> 1:20:21.080]  just wouldn't do anything and I mean before the George Floyd murder when I
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:24.360]  was walking around the city was basically empty it was really like I am
[1:20:24.360 --> 1:20:29.160]  legend and there were no police whatsoever and when I would you know go
[1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:33.600]  to a police precinct or something and ask them if they've been stood down the
[1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:38.680]  response was very weird they just did not want to answer and the only cops I
[1:20:38.680 --> 1:20:43.840]  saw were traffic cops and the special response group which as I understand NYPD
[1:20:43.840 --> 1:20:49.400]  SRG is some kind of anti-terrorism you know what's happened is the media is
[1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:54.400]  paralyzed local police also the Democrats above them the mayors and others
[1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:58.080]  are part of it and so they know if anything goes wrong they're gonna be
[1:20:58.080 --> 1:21:03.160]  blamed and fired so they've stood down themselves which is the same thing as
[1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:06.320]  being paralyzed it's a very very dangerous scenario and I've seen a lot of
[1:21:06.320 --> 1:21:09.560]  the reports you have posted we should have you back soon or maybe even later
[1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:14.800]  during the commercial free part of this 40-hour broadcast to play some of the
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:18.200]  amazing videos and reports you've got because they are incredible where do
[1:21:18.200 --> 1:21:22.400]  people find all those reports well they can find them on crowdsource to truth
[1:21:22.400 --> 1:21:27.560]  calm that will lead people to all of the YouTube and patreon and all that stuff
[1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:31.480]  you know we've been taking a lot of heat Alex the Emmys have brought a lawsuit
[1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:36.720]  against me and my corporation actually for doing a parody I was speaking with
[1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:40.560]  David Knight about that when the lawsuit was first raised but I've already
[1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:46.240]  started my legal defense and yesterday my appeal to the YouTube legal
[1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:50.600]  department worked and so the YouTube channel has been reactivated and I
[1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:56.280]  think the Emmys are in big trouble when our court date arrives on October 30th
[1:21:56.280 --> 1:22:00.440]  explain to people that they're using copyright law when you're clearly
[1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:04.280]  protected covering something giving analysis and saying you violated them
[1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:09.200]  yeah well what they're actually using is law fair they claim that I violated
[1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:13.680]  their copyright but clearly it's a parody which is protected by section 107 of
[1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:18.560]  the copyright act apparently pretty much the most most most protected under
[1:22:18.560 --> 1:22:21.960]  free speech because you're allowed to imitate it and make fun of it under
[1:22:21.960 --> 1:22:27.080]  satire that's right but because Adam Sharp who's the son of Roger Sharp who
[1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:31.520]  reported from the Dallas police station November 22nd 1963 that Lee Harvey
[1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:36.280]  Oswald had shot John F. Kennedy and went on to win four Emmy awards his son is
[1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:40.080]  now the president and CEO of the National Academy of Television Arts and
[1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:45.160]  Sciences which awards Emmys for the news daytime drama and stuff like that and so
[1:22:45.160 --> 1:22:49.160]  I think that people who report things like Lee Harvey Oswald shot JFK they
[1:22:49.160 --> 1:22:53.640]  win Emmys people who report things like Alex Jones or Jason Goodman get their
[1:22:53.640 --> 1:22:57.880]  channels struck they get lost right I'm not even sure Trump wants a Nobel Peace
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:23:01.160]  Prize for all the wars he's gotten us out of because they give it to Henry
[1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:06.080]  Kissinger they give it to Barack Obama I mean it's it's almost like getting an
[1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:10.960]  iron cross from Hitler exactly and you know right now I'm in the West Village
[1:23:10.960 --> 1:23:15.680]  which you know normally on a autumn day it's beautiful weather today I would
[1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:21.620]  expect most of these restaurants to be full but so many of them Alex are closed
[1:23:21.620 --> 1:23:26.880]  down and I mean this is part of what made New York New York you might come on
[1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:30.520]  a vacation and try a different restaurant every night get into some you

[1:26:50.280 --> 1:27:17.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:22.000]  this world government system is authoritarian Hollywood Communist
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:27.240]  China big universities they promote it because big corporations want to get
[1:27:27.240 --> 1:27:32.400]  rid of nation-states and do process big techs bigger than government big tech
[1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:37.760]  surveils more than I say and government hasn't even figured that out yet though
[1:27:37.760 --> 1:27:41.720]  Congress has put out a report dealing with big tech censorship operating as a
[1:27:41.720 --> 1:27:47.640]  monopoly and election meddling but just a week ago American cyclists
[1:27:47.640 --> 1:27:54.280]  suspended over pro-trump tweet Quinn Simmons reigning world champion of the
[1:27:54.280 --> 1:27:59.760]  junior road race now placing the highest levels in the official top races set
[1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:06.280]  to be the new Lance Armstrong was asked on Twitter well if you don't follow me
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:11.800]  and support Trump you can go the journalist Joe then wrote in a now
[1:28:11.800 --> 1:28:19.640]  deleted tweet by Simmons replied again if you follow me and support Trump you
[1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:27.120]  can go the journalist Jose Ben wrote and now lead a tweet for one word by like
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:33.560]  bye bye he was kicked off the team suspended now kicked off that's how
[1:28:33.560 --> 1:28:38.720]  these systems work ladies and gentlemen were joined by Mark Rondaza with an
[1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:42.640]  exclusive story here in a moment dealing with something that's happened in
[1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:47.720]  Massachusetts in a school but first here's a few short clips of even more
[1:28:47.720 --> 1:28:51.520]  egregious things you're about to hear going on where we're young people get
[1:28:51.520 --> 1:28:55.960]  kicked out of school or get in trouble for their political beliefs absolute
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:01.160]  authoritarianism here it is on what exactly did the teachers say now when
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:07.800]  Bella said Trump was her hero well when she found out that Trump was her hero
[1:29:07.800 --> 1:29:13.000]  she said you're not allowed to pick Trump he spreads negativity and he says
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:22.520]  bad things about women and I was like Floyd when I heard that well for for a
[1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:29.560]  little girl to have the poise to not just buckle under the pressure and
[1:29:29.560 --> 1:29:36.480]  actually come home and Arthur say mom dad this doesn't seem right that's what
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:41.800]  actually gives me a lot of hope is that your little girl Arthur said you know
[1:29:41.800 --> 1:29:48.320]  something no I'm not I'm not giving in that's pretty unusual I have to say
[1:29:48.320 --> 1:30:01.280]  you can hear me over your music over there can we go over there
[1:30:03.880 --> 1:30:06.920]  and this is a teacher telling people they can't be in a park or they're gonna
[1:30:06.920 --> 1:30:13.040]  die it's all just this craziness that our young people go through Jackson Cody
[1:30:13.040 --> 1:30:18.480]  is our guest student at O'Malley Middle School Gloucestershire Public Schools
[1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:23.840]  Massachusetts and I'll let his lawyer and my good friend Mark Rondazzo the
[1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:28.360]  Rondazzo legal group go over this for us this is not like the other crazy
[1:30:28.360 --> 1:30:32.120]  teachers they're following a directive of the school I know Mark is not saying
[1:30:32.120 --> 1:30:34.520]  the teachers of the problem here though I think they're following orders they
[1:30:34.520 --> 1:30:38.160]  shouldn't think the Nuremberg code shows that they are doing something wrong but
[1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:42.320]  I get it they're not the main target they don't mean to be bad it's just that
[1:30:42.320 --> 1:30:45.560]  they're just following orders and gonna cut it it is the school itself I grew
[1:30:45.560 --> 1:30:48.240]  with Mark Rondazzo so Mark lead us through this and thanks for coming on
[1:30:48.240 --> 1:30:56.200]  with this exclusive sure so Jackson here is a very politically astute a very
[1:30:56.200 --> 1:31:03.240]  articulate student who happens to be a young Republican so he was in class and
[1:31:03.240 --> 1:31:08.080]  he was asked whether the teacher I believe asked Jackson told me this is
[1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:13.600]  right they asked if anybody in the class supported Trump yes and then what
[1:31:13.600 --> 1:31:20.760]  happened so she basically told me that I was wrong and that she shaved on a
[1:31:20.760 --> 1:31:26.320]  Trump and she kind of made me feel bad and made the whole class gang up on me
[1:31:26.320 --> 1:31:30.600]  and so she even said to him well I thought I liked you you know and this
[1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:34.840]  is a 12 year old kid who I think we ought to be proud of any 12 year old who
[1:31:34.840 --> 1:31:39.880]  has their own political opinions I don't care if they're you know out there as a
[1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:45.120]  outspoken conservative liberal you know communist anarchists as long as they
[1:31:45.120 --> 1:31:50.800]  are engaged in the process and what we found disappointing was that not only
[1:31:50.800 --> 1:31:55.000]  did his his homeroom teacher first tell him that you know there was something
[1:31:55.000 --> 1:32:00.200]  wrong with him for these beliefs but then in she was in a he was in a later
[1:32:00.200 --> 1:32:03.360]  class I want you tell it tell about what happened in your in your other class
[1:32:03.360 --> 1:32:07.920]  and the teacher just said she was having a bad day and the only good thing that
[1:32:07.920 --> 1:32:13.360]  happened to her today was Donald Trump getting coronavirus so me and my friend
[1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:18.040]  were talking about what Donald Trump's done she told us to be quiet but the
[1:32:18.040 --> 1:32:21.600]  other kids in the back could talk about how bad Donald Trump was she walked by
[1:32:21.600 --> 1:32:26.360]  them and said nothing to them so you got blatant viewpoint discrimination and
[1:32:26.360 --> 1:32:31.080]  you know what I'm one of the things I'm most proud of of Jackson and his family
[1:32:31.080 --> 1:32:35.720]  for is that they have insisted that they don't want to they don't want to shame
[1:32:35.720 --> 1:32:38.120]  anybody you know they don't want to mention the names of the teachers
[1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:42.600]  publicly they did mention them of course the administration and letters that I
[1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:46.440]  sent to the administration but you know they don't want to play the cancel
[1:32:46.440 --> 1:32:51.000]  culture game you know his direct quote to me was you know we're we're not
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:55.880]  liberals we don't do that exactly you don't want it for tech you want them to
[1:32:55.880 --> 1:33:02.640]  uphold the First Amendment yes so what have you learned about the First
[1:33:02.640 --> 1:33:06.600]  Amendment through this Jackson that you just had the right to your own opinion
[1:33:06.600 --> 1:33:11.120]  no matter what your opinion is and you don't let anyone else stop that right
[1:33:11.120 --> 1:33:18.960]  and about your educational process that the teachers and the change and they
[1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:23.480]  need the proper training it's not take one individual teacher they're not bad
[1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:26.360]  they're not wrong they just don't have the right training and they need the
[1:33:26.360 --> 1:33:30.160]  right training well I mean that's a very nice thing for you to say and I say
[1:33:30.160 --> 1:33:33.080]  overall you're absolutely right but and it's going to be measured in your
[1:33:33.080 --> 1:33:36.760]  response but this is all over the country all the world nationalist patriots
[1:33:36.760 --> 1:33:41.960]  conservatives Christians populist anti-war people are being censored and
[1:33:41.960 --> 1:33:46.320]  shut down in organized fashion and I think something's wrong with the teachers
[1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:50.480]  in their training that they think that these are okay orders to be given I mean
[1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:53.720]  they all know you could have a church of Satan event there if the kids wanted to
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:57.680]  have or you could have a voice down event or you could have you know LGBT stuff
[1:33:57.680 --> 1:34:01.400]  if the young people are wanting to have that event but to say that you then can't
[1:34:01.400 --> 1:34:07.400]  say you support the president this is just outrageous yeah I mean I Alex I
[1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:12.760]  think the the graphic you put up about the about Cambodia was was right on
[1:34:12.760 --> 1:34:20.000]  point you know this is this is how when you want to wipe out your opposition you
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:23.480]  start with the kids you know you brainwash the kids you don't let the
[1:34:23.480 --> 1:34:27.200]  kids think that there's any other option you know I don't think that we're ever
[1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:32.560]  gonna be I'll never be so certain of my politics and I think there's no room for
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:37.840]  debate I don't see how in God's name that you know a middle school would do
[1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:41.760]  this to kids and make it you know make it difficult for kids to have their own
[1:34:41.760 --> 1:34:46.160]  thoughts and their own beliefs you know higher education I mean we see this on
[1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:50.200]  college campuses sure you know high schools but now to see this even all
[1:34:50.200 --> 1:34:54.440]  the way down into the middle schools you know that there needs to be systemic
[1:34:54.440 --> 1:34:59.040]  change well we know what's happened the universities that were once founts of a
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:03.360]  free expression have now become horrible bizarre malice brainwashing
[1:35:03.360 --> 1:35:07.280]  facilities that actually adopted that and much of the Khmer Rouge type of
[1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:10.200]  brainwashing and pull pot you're absolutely right Mark Rundhasa I was
[1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:13.840]  a lawyer joining us but now they have externalized that method into the
[1:35:13.840 --> 1:35:17.640]  middle schools the elementary schools I mean this is this is cult programming and
[1:35:17.640 --> 1:35:20.280]  they believe they're backed by the teachers unions this is being directed
[1:35:20.280 --> 1:35:26.400]  by big corporations it needs to stop yeah yeah I mean the I mean I've had you
[1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:30.800]  know a case against this school before where there there was a teacher whose
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:35.320]  First Amendment rights were infringed upon and you know it's funny how when
[1:35:35.320 --> 1:35:40.320]  that wasn't politically charged speech like that the teachers union had no
[1:35:40.320 --> 1:35:44.280]  interest in helping her but I do agree that you know part of the problem you
[1:35:44.280 --> 1:35:49.800]  have is the public service unions are probably not a good idea for us and
[1:35:49.800 --> 1:35:54.360]  when you have these public service unions essentially programming their
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:59.440]  members to try to program the kids you've you've got the a little taste of a
[1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:03.800]  cultural revolution that I don't want to participate in yeah it'd be one thing
[1:36:03.800 --> 1:36:07.560]  of my neighbor was telling my ten-year-old oh this is not my view it's
[1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:10.760]  still be a little pushy but if they told my son you're an idiot you can't have
[1:36:10.760 --> 1:36:14.040]  that view I'd say hey Bob I'm about to beat your ass I mean at the end of the
[1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:17.320]  day this is very cult-like it's very authoritarian it's very dangerous but
[1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:21.160]  have the school doing it it's just next level and it feels so acceptable I want
[1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:24.160]  to hear where you're gonna go and where you think other people with the same
[1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:28.720]  problem Mark Rendazer are gonna go if this continues which it is I mean when
[1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:31.960]  do we start pushing back it's one thing to send a letter to this teacher they'd
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:35.400]  be quiet for a while but move on and abuse the next class what other young
[1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:38.560]  people out there what do you recommend they do when this happens I think what
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:42.240]  Jackson Cody did is the model of goodness I would have been probably a
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:44.320]  little more aggressive but that's why I'm a crazy person
[1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:49.280]  well they're right back in four wars dot com tomorrow's news today the Bible
[1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:53.960]  talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the nation states
[1:36:53.960 --> 1:36:58.400]  and who give their power unto the one world leader the Antichrist and he has
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:03.680]  a beast system that no one can find or sell unless he has that mark in the
[1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:09.000]  forehead or in the palm of their hand and we look back all the warnings you
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:13.520]  were given and all just the common sense that you don't believe in God or
[1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:19.040]  prophecy giving governments corporations the power to control who can buy it who
[1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:23.760]  can sell to track everything we do he's not just a recipe it's a blueprint for
[1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:27.440]  total enslavement and now you look at Bill Gates you look at Bloomberg and
[1:37:27.440 --> 1:37:32.200]  others who openly say we're technocrats we should decide how much salt you get
[1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:36.400]  how much alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're technocrats we know
[1:37:36.400 --> 1:37:40.240]  best we're now gonna set up the economy with a social score to totally control
[1:37:40.240 --> 1:37:45.640]  you you snap your fingers we're here they're just rolling it out and a lot of
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:51.120]  people are complying with it it's insane remember the global lock-downs you're
[1:37:51.120 --> 1:37:55.760]  witnessing the black lives matter antifer riots and racial attacks we're
[1:37:55.760 --> 1:38:01.760]  all saying are publicly directed by a handful of top billionaires led by
[1:38:01.760 --> 1:38:07.880]  people like Bill Gates Jeff Bezos of course Tim Cook and others they set up
[1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:12.360]  there with their trillions of dollars they control in their companies and
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:15.800]  there are hundreds of billions of dollars individually leveraging that
[1:38:15.800 --> 1:38:19.840]  against us and trying to create an artificial revolution against local
[1:38:19.840 --> 1:38:24.760]  government and police and the mayors are again they're playing their political
[1:38:24.760 --> 1:38:28.320]  game try to trigger the complete breakdown of the United States in
[1:38:28.320 --> 1:38:32.240]  Western Europe show these billionaires can come in and buy it all up for
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:36.040]  billions on the dollar that's why I'm so angry at these globalists because when
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:39.480]  you're looking at them they're the ones that sit in their councils and have
[1:38:39.480 --> 1:38:44.160]  decided to run these plans against us they are enemies of humanity and must
[1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:51.840]  be dealt with it's us or them period the Renaissance the great enlightenment
[1:38:51.840 --> 1:38:58.640]  it's all being swept away and being replaced by scientific tyranny that's
[1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:05.640]  establishing a form of planetary digital law where the technocrats are above the
[1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:12.280]  law the public isn't even considered to be as valuable as a cow in fact humans
[1:39:12.280 --> 1:39:16.960]  are seen as garbage it's going to be taken out and removed that is the
[1:39:16.960 --> 1:39:22.800]  post-human extermination plan that is the public ideology of the globalist and
[1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:27.400]  everything they've built with this high-tech grid is to absorb us and
[1:39:27.400 --> 1:39:33.440]  anesthetize our minds as we're slowly killed and any future generations that
[1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:37.920]  happen to strangle out of their mother's wounds will be a mere shadow of what
[1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:44.920]  humans once were this is the satanic ruling elite engaged in mass vandalism
[1:39:44.920 --> 1:39:51.240]  against God's creation humanity this is the essence of evil 2020 elections

[1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:30.080]  going to take action once reelected against big tech and that he's modern
[1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:32.760]  the situation well we know the president's overwhelmed right now so we're

[1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:28.640]  the country you raise your hand then they belittle you they make you feel bad
[1:41:28.640 --> 1:41:32.800]  this is the essence of authoritarianism and I go back to American
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:38.880]  Cyclists suspended over pro-Trump tweet and then you had the football player a
[1:41:38.880 --> 1:41:43.040]  few weeks ago who was a bronze star winner and the rest of football team
[1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:47.360]  decided to stay in during the star-spangled banner well he said I can't
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:50.160]  help but he went out and did it they threatened to kick him off the team so
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:54.200]  he basically apologized which makes it even worse I mean he's willing to get
[1:41:54.200 --> 1:41:59.160]  shot in combat for the country but he's gonna get kicked off the team if he
[1:41:59.160 --> 1:42:04.960]  wants to stand for the anthem this is so cultic and so authoritarian I mean
[1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:09.240]  words don't describe it mark run does it you're up there in the top ten first
[1:42:09.240 --> 1:42:12.360]  Lord is the country you're very well known you take Christian cases you take
[1:42:12.360 --> 1:42:16.360]  a cultic cases you take you know everybody's cases it's first amendment
[1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:20.800]  it's legal you take it I respect that I know in some cases even the Satanist
[1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:24.640]  have gotten mad at you for taking my my case was with some of the cases you for
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:28.840]  us it's just outrageous when did the so-called liberals become the crazy
[1:42:28.840 --> 1:42:36.200]  left and totally not just abandon free speech but actively assaulted well you
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:42.160]  know I think that has been a cornerstone of how people have interpreted
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:46.200]  Marxism I mean you look at Mao you look at Lenin you look at Pol Pot I mean that
[1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:53.640]  that's that's how you use it but you know it is true that you know that they
[1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:58.480]  will often aim at people first who are on the outskirts you know you aim at
[1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:02.640]  people who speak outrageously first they came for Milo then they came for you
[1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:08.720]  and now they're coming for even more and more people and you know just it's not
[1:43:08.720 --> 1:43:13.560]  like I'm representing somebody here who has some kind of outrageous reputation
[1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:19.400]  I mean Jackson's a half decent student right yeah I get all A's and I really
[1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:25.120]  never get in trouble I mean involved in activities absolutely outrageous it's a
[1:43:25.120 --> 1:43:28.640]  total abolition of the job of the teachers and their sacred trust is
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:31.840]  disgusting Jackson you're a stand-up guy what do you want to say about free
[1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:34.960]  speech in America and and what you think of Trump this is your chance to be
[1:43:34.960 --> 1:43:38.440]  heard by millions they want to silence you you stood up you're a model for all
[1:43:38.440 --> 1:43:43.680]  of us to stand up and say no what do you want to impart everybody my friend well
[1:43:43.680 --> 1:43:48.880]  just like all of our windows home idea of the marketplace and freedom of speech
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:52.960]  I just feel like that everyone has the right to their own opinion and I support
[1:43:52.960 --> 1:43:59.080]  Donald Trump and he's done many great things making peace with many countries
[1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:03.880]  not creating a new war he's helped our economy and some people may not agree with
[1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:07.840]  me and they have the right to their own opinion but let me have my own opinion
[1:44:07.840 --> 1:44:12.720]  and don't say anything about it what do you expect to happen now that Mark
[1:44:12.720 --> 1:44:17.840]  Rondazis to help helping you stand up for your rights well I expect the school
[1:44:17.840 --> 1:44:22.720]  to get the proper training I expect the district to get the proper training and
[1:44:22.720 --> 1:44:27.600]  the teachers should not let all students or be biased against religion
[1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:34.160]  politics or any of this anymore it's not right Mark you're taking an even hand
[1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:38.000]  with this should be in you're very judicious but what do they need to do I
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.600]  mean anything to announce they're having some classes about the first amendment
[1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:44.440]  for these damn teachers I think these have apologies I mean and and what
[1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:50.200]  absolute commitments to not act like you know baby Stalin again yeah I mean one
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:54.240]  of one of the teachers already you know in on her own without being pressured I
[1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:58.040]  think thought about it and and apologize to the family and I thought that was a
[1:44:58.040 --> 1:45:04.320]  real stand-up move but there needs to be education yes the teachers need to
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:09.520]  learn because I think you're not a good teacher if your students are aware of
[1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:13.640]  your political or religious views Jackson what went wrong and then mark what
[1:45:13.640 --> 1:45:17.480]  went wrong where just even ten years ago everybody knew free speech was key
[1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:21.360]  unless it was profane or call for violence since when where did we lose
[1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:25.240]  this and where did this sacred amendment that we all agree on someone
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:27.720]  agree with the second that we all agree with free speech I thought when did we
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:34.880]  lose that most American idea probably when Donald Trump became president
[1:45:34.880 --> 1:45:39.280]  everyone didn't like him and they loved him all before he became a politician
[1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:44.160]  and started running for president that's a good answer it really did the floor
[1:45:44.160 --> 1:45:47.880]  fell in the bottom of the pit opened up when Trump got in mark but it was already
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:51.960]  going on before that wasn't it well I think it was you know there was
[1:45:51.960 --> 1:45:57.920]  certainly a current of anti-free speech I mean and I think the right and the
[1:45:57.920 --> 1:46:02.280]  left are equally to blame look you know there was a time when my entire career
[1:46:02.280 --> 1:46:06.560]  was fighting government officials who were on the right who wanted to shut
[1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:12.160]  down speech that they didn't like but you know it it has been it's been a
[1:46:12.160 --> 1:46:17.640]  strategy of the left I think to infiltrate education to make sure that
[1:46:17.640 --> 1:46:21.960]  you just don't feel comfortable expressing certain ideas on college
[1:46:21.960 --> 1:46:26.960]  campuses and high school campuses and now apparently middle school you know I
[1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:33.520]  think that he's right that in 2016 when everybody was shocked at the power of the
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:37.560]  First Amendment because that's what got Trump elected I mean broadcast like
[1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:42.320]  yours you know you were hitting so many people that they weren't taking any
[1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:47.640]  account for that they didn't care we had 20 million people a day which we did but
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:53.080]  afterwards all they went whoa but it was their arrogance yes I think so you know
[1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:59.120]  look I think you know I worked on the Obama campaign in 2008 and we know we
[1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:02.240]  kind of laughed at the fact that the Republicans apparently didn't know how
[1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:06.960]  to use the internet and well they learned over eight years and then they're
[1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:11.240]  just as many if not more conservatives organized online than there were
[1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:16.720]  liberals and you know that that same online marketplace of ideas that I
[1:47:16.720 --> 1:47:22.000]  think helped propel Obama into office propelled Trump into office and that's
[1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:27.120]  just the way the game is played and what you don't do what I won't stand for is
[1:47:27.120 --> 1:47:30.840]  when somebody says well if your communication is so effective that it
[1:47:30.840 --> 1:47:34.800]  got someone elected that I don't like I need to stop you from communicating well
[1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:40.320]  exactly just adopt what's popular if they want to win yeah I'd say that but
[1:47:40.320 --> 1:47:44.280]  what you don't do is you take a fine American like this kid you know
[1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:49.520]  wrestling champion top grades I mean this is a stellar student and you want
[1:47:49.520 --> 1:47:54.840]  to and you look at him and you see he's so politically astute and so like red
[1:47:54.840 --> 1:47:59.600]  beyond what the teachers make him do and you don't want to foster that you don't
[1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:03.520]  want to pull that out of him and I agree and here's the key he knows to go to his
[1:48:03.520 --> 1:48:07.200]  parents and get a good lawyer and stand up that's the final he doesn't just know
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:12.080]  all the info he knows the action is key all right amazing Jackson Cody everybody
[1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:15.640]  wants to contact you do you got an email or through your parents or through Mark

[1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:42.920]  having us on Alex thank you there goes Mark Rindazan Jackson Cody and that's
[1:48:42.920 --> 1:48:46.880]  just another one of those stories you know you can search children punished
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:53.240]  for supporting Trump and they found like a little girl had her Trump pin ripped
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:56.960]  off of her and sent to the principal I mean this is crazed and look I know it's
[1:48:56.960 --> 1:49:04.040]  because of who I am today this guy set his dog on me and it bit me and luckily
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:07.800]  it didn't get blood a little bit most teeth didn't puncture bit me on the arm
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:11.600]  because as soon as I started biting me I grabbed it and punched it got it off me
[1:49:11.600 --> 1:49:18.720]  but the guy told his dog dog good job because it's who I am I mean this is
[1:49:18.720 --> 1:49:24.560]  just ridiculous folks this is absolutely out of control and I did follow police
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:28.560]  report I saw animal control just call me during the break because you know I'm
[1:49:28.560 --> 1:49:32.120]  gonna have to go after that guy he's gonna lie about me that's what the left
[1:49:32.120 --> 1:49:37.880]  us oh I got witnesses buddy I got it all I got it all I got it all I got it all
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:42.240]  but it's gonna get worse and that's the big question we've got to ask is what
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:48.240]  are they gonna start doing now when they lose in 26 days because all hell's gonna
[1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:51.520]  break loose and it's gonna be bad and they're gonna claim that Trump still
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:56.800]  told the election and they they say if he strategically does anything even
[1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:00.320]  defend himself he's a bad person we have to get ahead of that I'm starting to see
[1:50:00.320 --> 1:50:04.760]  that happen it's very very positive all right former head of psychological

[1:52:56.280 --> 1:53:01.480]  film back in the early 1970s called rollerball with James Kahn it's based on
[1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:07.840]  a novel set in the year 2020 and in the book you have mega-corporates that
[1:53:07.840 --> 1:53:12.280]  control the planet and there are no longer nation-states there are only
[1:53:12.280 --> 1:53:17.800]  cities that are the capitals of the corporations. If you actually read what
[1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:21.880]  the day most group of the CFR to the Federal Commission say in the year 2020
[1:53:21.880 --> 1:53:26.280]  that is their end game that is their goal so we're talking about a hunger
[1:53:26.280 --> 1:53:31.840]  games type scenario here run by very very very ruthless people see us as
[1:53:31.840 --> 1:53:36.280]  shadow they're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and communist China as
[1:53:36.280 --> 1:53:40.080]  their model we must reject it now
[1:53:41.680 --> 1:53:53.320]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show right in front of our very eyes we are
[1:53:53.320 --> 1:54:00.000]  seeing the globalist deep state at work black lives matter and and Tifa what a
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:07.720]  terrible terrible blight upon all people and Tifa which they claim means anti
[1:54:07.720 --> 1:54:14.920]  fascist is absurd ludicrous and totally opposite of what they claim to be they
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:21.120]  are not anti-fascist they are the fascists. Black lives matter if they
[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:28.480]  ruse R-U-S-E if black lives matter then why don't we do something about what is
[1:54:28.480 --> 1:54:35.440]  happening black on black killing black in places like Chicago Detroit Baltimore
[1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:41.600]  Washington DC it's an endless list that won't be missed so the bottom line here
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:48.480]  is that it's about divide confusion chaos and conquer what we're watching here
[1:54:48.480 --> 1:54:55.640]  is insanity in particularly the deep state Democrats and their seditious
[1:54:55.640 --> 1:55:02.600]  despicable lying media are fanning the flame I urge all of my brothers and
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:08.680]  sisters don't go for the ghosts okay don't be do good weak fan-buzzle okay
[1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:15.440]  understand that we are in this struggle as patriots as US citizens together what
[1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:22.040]  we have on our side is we have each other each other and that's extremely
[1:55:22.040 --> 1:55:27.680]  powerful and that's something that the media the deep state Democrats and the
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:31.960]  Rhino Republicans for that matter they don't want you to know that they want
[1:55:31.960 --> 1:55:36.600]  you to think that you're alone you're by yourself you're not alone you're not by
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:42.920]  yourself and there are a lot of people millions millions who are thinking just
[1:55:42.920 --> 1:55:50.560]  like you this is our republic this is all about fun and games and hurting
[1:55:50.560 --> 1:55:56.400]  people and destroying not building not serving the people body and soul but the
[1:55:56.400 --> 1:56:04.000]  exact opposite so I plead with implore with to all my brothers and sisters of
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  all colors get a grip on reality stop this madness stop this insanity and
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:16.360]  those who won't stop it need to be stopped
[1:56:16.360 --> 1:56:23.960]  so I would say you know if anything that's happening at CNN and anybody who
[1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:28.480]  buys your book it's really just one of those things that is dividing our nation
[1:56:28.480 --> 1:56:33.920]  and I don't believe in dividing our nation it hurts our great nation and so
[1:56:33.920 --> 1:56:40.240]  CNN is really the enemy of the truth and that's my opinion thank you no American
[1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:46.800]  is an enemy of another American no news outlet is an enemy of America
[1:57:10.240 --> 1:57:40.160] , no news outlet is an enemy of America, Bill Gates wants you.
[1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:50.240]  This is CNN.
[1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:58.240]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:18.080]  Info wars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened because we are
[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:25.800]  effective the great awakening is here go to band.video download the videos and
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:37.320]  share support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the
[1:58:37.320 --> 1:58:51.400]  fight for more than a hundred years the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to
[1:58:51.400 --> 1:58:56.080]  establish world government abolish nation states dumb down the population by
[1:58:56.080 --> 1:58:59.800]  taking control of education and most importantly taking control of Western
[1:58:59.800 --> 1:59:05.440]  medicine now they had a bad name by the 1920s they started converting over and
[1:59:05.440 --> 1:59:10.440]  funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their
[1:59:10.440 --> 1:59:16.760]  eugenics operations fast forward to the 1980s the baton is handed by IBM via his
[1:59:16.760 --> 1:59:21.120]  mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates the third his father of course
[1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:25.080]  being head of Planned Parenthood and now he's been able to position himself over
[1:59:25.080 --> 1:59:30.240]  almost every health department in the world every national health system
[1:59:30.240 --> 1:59:35.400]  Bill Gates is in control they have spent a hundred plus years getting
[1:59:35.400 --> 1:59:39.800]  positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and with those in
[1:59:39.800 --> 1:59:43.320]  your body this is the holy grail of their operations and now they're
[1:59:43.320 --> 1:59:58.680]  normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body all right we're already into
[1:59:58.680 --> 2:00:04.040]  hour number three I'm your host Alex Jones we are into what hour number five
[2:00:04.040 --> 2:00:09.040]  of the global transmission hour for six now and I'm really excited the Dr. Steve
[2:00:09.040 --> 2:00:13.400]  Pachennick's with us he's a best-selling author researcher a veteran and the
[2:00:13.400 --> 2:00:16.160]  former head of psychological operations in the State Department involved in
[2:00:16.160 --> 2:00:19.680]  regime change co-wrote a bunch of books with Tom Clancy is one of his main
[2:00:19.680 --> 2:00:26.360]  sources Steve Pachennick.com's his website his latest e-book American Warrior in
[2:00:26.360 --> 2:00:30.360]  Crisis Tales of a Political Psychiatrist is available he's also a medical
[2:00:30.360 --> 2:00:35.040]  doctor psychiatrist and MIT trained and a bunch of other things and he's with us
[2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:39.080]  here you know who he is at Steve Pachennick on Twitter we really appreciate
[2:00:39.080 --> 2:00:42.640]  him joining us he'll always have a lot to say and he's got his own pro-america
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:46.800]  agenda he's a good guy I agree with about 95% we has to say and he'll get into
[2:00:46.800 --> 2:00:49.680]  his agenda because we don't pre-talk where he comes on but I've got my
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:53.360]  questions and I know he doesn't want to overestimate how powerful the chai
[2:00:53.360 --> 2:00:58.680]  comms and the Hollywood scum are and all the rest of them but just right here
[2:00:58.680 --> 2:01:03.720]  they're out in the open in the communist Chinese newspapers saying China Trump
[2:01:03.720 --> 2:01:07.920]  sets poor example with post-coronavirus White House return even though they've
[2:01:07.920 --> 2:01:11.400]  been reopened for business and now they've got documented reports out that
[2:01:11.400 --> 2:01:15.920]  they are hyping up corona to keep us locked down meanwhile China North
[2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:21.720]  Korea Cuba and Iran denounced US for systemic racial discrimination at UN
[2:01:21.720 --> 2:01:26.520]  I mean China's killed more people than Hitler ever dreamed of talk about
[2:01:26.520 --> 2:01:30.520]  discrimination it's not even it's so laughable but our whole media goes along
[2:01:30.520 --> 2:01:35.560]  with it so I want to ask you this who are America's enemies because we know
[2:01:35.560 --> 2:01:39.360]  there's a deep state and there's an inept state and that's the big enemy and
[2:01:39.360 --> 2:01:42.920]  we know the Chinese have brought their money in and bought up the media and all
[2:01:42.920 --> 2:01:45.720]  the rest of it but I want people to know who the players are because I get asked
[2:01:45.720 --> 2:01:48.960]  all the time who are the players I can see who's aligned the communist Chinese
[2:01:48.960 --> 2:01:54.560]  Hollywood the EU tell they have Deimos meetings and say Gigi Ping will crush
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:01:59.800]  Trump three years ago and he's being saluted on stage by Yunker the Nazi air
[2:01:59.800 --> 2:02:05.520]  stumbling around drunk so so I get there inept and I get we can beat them but I
[2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:10.040]  just should not see more Americans openly supporting Trump and supporting the
[2:02:10.040 --> 2:02:13.040]  rebuilding of our military building our infrastructure pulling us out of these
[2:02:13.040 --> 2:02:17.440]  wars all this is very pragmatic common sense to me to not see that really
[2:02:17.440 --> 2:02:21.320]  frustrates me dr. Pachennick that's a long intro I appreciate you what would
[2:02:21.320 --> 2:02:25.360]  you who are the players people want to know that they know you're smart who are
[2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:28.360]  the players 26 days out what do you think they're gonna pull thanks for joining
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:35.160]  us it's my pleasure number one the greatest enemy of America can only be
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:41.600]  America we have no other enemies Putin is not our enemy he's a strong ally he
[2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:46.560]  can say whatever he wants about the Democrats Republicans president she
[2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:51.560]  knows he's sitting on a very dangerous situation because not only the
[2:02:51.560 --> 2:02:56.400]  coronavirus but they have a real problem economically and then they have a
[2:02:56.400 --> 2:03:02.320]  system that they can't really work the only problem we have is an internal
[2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:07.960]  dissension within our in within our country where the real problem is we
[2:03:07.960 --> 2:03:12.600]  don't know anything about our history we talked about racism yet the civil war
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:18.800]  had nothing to do about racism we talked about economic problems yet the issue
[2:03:18.800 --> 2:03:24.080]  here is we're doing economically quite well we bring forth people who have been
[2:03:24.080 --> 2:03:30.000]  discredited have accomplished absolutely nothing have started wars and occur up
[2:03:30.000 --> 2:03:36.360]  i.e. Biden where is the danger on the outside that it's comparable to the
[2:03:36.360 --> 2:03:43.080]  danger within side what I'm speaking about is internally because we are 37th
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:49.520]  in the world on education that Democrats are able to mobilize these
[2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:56.520]  sayings like oh we have a history of racism really who has more racism than
[2:03:56.520 --> 2:04:01.720]  the Africans who brought the African slaves here to America who has more
[2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:07.240]  racism than the Muslims who brought over the African slaves to America we
[2:04:07.240 --> 2:04:13.520]  didn't create the civil war over racism or the slaves it was done because we had
[2:04:13.520 --> 2:04:21.800]  an idiot Marfan syndrome depressed manic depressive death spot called Abraham
[2:04:21.800 --> 2:04:26.800]  Lincoln but we don't teach that we said that we did the civil war because it was
[2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:33.000]  for the freedom of the slaves wrong you know and here here is the problem of
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:38.440]  America we don't understand where we are if you want to talk about racism in
[2:04:38.440 --> 2:04:44.560]  America fine let's talk about the time in FDR one of the greatest racist of all
[2:04:44.560 --> 2:04:51.240]  time the epitome of democratic values and progress of it he was the eugenicists
[2:04:51.240 --> 2:04:55.720]  people don't know that no let me go on and I'll explain it number one he
[2:04:55.720 --> 2:05:01.160]  allowed the Jews to be exterminated he was warned repeatedly that we have been
[2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:07.080]  exterminated his right-hand man John McCloy who created the CIA said under no
[2:05:07.080 --> 2:05:11.880]  condition will we stop the bombing of anything but we will save certain
[2:05:11.880 --> 2:05:19.040]  factories in Germany he was pro Hitler who whom did they incarcerate the blacks
[2:05:19.040 --> 2:05:26.000]  no the Japanese in World War two FDR initiated the incarceration of them
[2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:32.480]  Japanese the Germans and the Italians does any Democrat know that there wasn't
[2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:37.200]  one black who was incarcerated in the prison camp but I know thousands and
[2:05:37.200 --> 2:05:42.120]  hundreds of thousands of Japanese who were mistakenly because we were at war
[2:05:42.120 --> 2:05:48.920]  at the time who was the one who created the wars in Vietnam it wasn't Eisenhower
[2:05:48.920 --> 2:05:54.280]  Eisenhower a general who served in our military with distinction said we're not
[2:05:54.280 --> 2:05:58.800]  going into Vietnam this is a disaster let the French do it so who did it a
[2:05:58.800 --> 2:06:04.280]  draft dodger who was totally manic depressive another moron who Doris
[2:06:04.280 --> 2:06:09.440]  Lessing loves the liberals love him his name was LBJ he just increased the
[2:06:09.440 --> 2:06:14.680]  number of soldiers we had from 16,000 to half a million and eventually the two
[2:06:14.680 --> 2:06:18.600]  million and you can fall flat gulf a tonkett and you know his letters are at
[2:06:18.600 --> 2:06:23.360]  his presidential museum and library here in Austin where he says that he's
[2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:29.480]  going to suppress a control black people correct he had no desire to read you
[2:06:29.480 --> 2:06:34.440]  free anybody that was the point so you got LBJ who comes next in line
[2:06:34.440 --> 2:06:40.800]  totally out of control mentally psychotic he looks great he's tanned you
[2:06:40.800 --> 2:06:45.160]  got Ted Sorenson once again from the liberal left at Harvard coming in and
[2:06:45.160 --> 2:06:50.600]  making up a story of the 10 days that shook the world but the reality was John
[2:06:50.600 --> 2:06:56.640]  F. Kennedy was at a Sony and he was totally depressed psychotic we don't
[2:06:56.640 --> 2:07:00.200]  talk about it thanks to the fact I was a Cornell medical school with our
[2:07:00.200 --> 2:07:04.000]  doctor classified that he took methamphetamine injections daily he was
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:09.840]  taking more drugs than Elvis correct and as a result of that cruise ship could
[2:07:09.840 --> 2:07:15.440]  not believe that we had a totally incompetent psychotic president so we
[2:07:15.440 --> 2:07:19.960]  got the Cuban missile crisis plus we had wars all over Latin America and the
[2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:25.200]  Middle East and guess what the results were inevitably he had to be stopped and
[2:07:25.200 --> 2:07:31.120]  he was stopped and LBJ was part of it Bush senior then we get to Bush senior
[2:07:31.120 --> 2:07:37.560]  and we start making up stories about Bush senior he was a war hero really he
[2:07:37.560 --> 2:07:43.200]  ejected from his plane and allowed eight of his own servicemen to die while he
[2:07:43.200 --> 2:07:48.440]  saved himself and made sure he became a hero he said I'm gonna go in the CIA in
[2:07:48.440 --> 2:07:55.960]  1972 no Bush senior you went into the CIA in 1957 your father was already in that
[2:07:55.960 --> 2:08:01.480]  business you were corrupt then we get who else the idiot version of Bush senior
[2:08:01.480 --> 2:08:08.040]  Bush junior with Cheney and what do they create 9 11 thousands of Americans
[2:08:08.040 --> 2:08:14.320]  killed then they immediately go into Iraq in Afghanistan with no reasons no
[2:08:14.320 --> 2:08:20.760]  evidence whatsoever but they're not arrested and who comes in Comey
[2:08:20.760 --> 2:08:27.120]  Mueller Hayden all the incompetence is what you're saying is the detritus the
[2:08:27.120 --> 2:08:32.200]  lackeys of all these scumbags are now left hanging on for power but with every
[2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:36.040]  passing week they're losing their power and Trump's bringing in a new residence
[2:08:36.040 --> 2:08:41.640]  that's exactly it but they are the core of disintegration of our American
[2:08:41.640 --> 2:08:47.880]  Republic not our democracy unlike Nancy Pelosi and the group of Democrats do not
[2:08:47.880 --> 2:08:52.360]  understand our country is not a democracy our founding fathers were too
[2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:57.240]  smart they saw exactly what happened in the French Revolution and they said we
[2:08:57.240 --> 2:09:01.960]  do not want the tyranny of the masses so we have exactly George Washington said
[2:09:01.960 --> 2:09:05.160]  in all those letters so it's a great history lesson riveting we love it I'm
[2:09:05.160 --> 2:09:09.320]  asking you currently we're gonna come back I know you know the players the
[2:09:09.320 --> 2:09:12.640]  universities the big corporations are still running this Bolshevik playbook
[2:09:12.640 --> 2:09:16.520]  of divide and conquer major universities everywhere segregating black from white
[2:09:16.520 --> 2:09:21.360]  again these people are crazy they are totally have a plan of division and I
[2:09:21.360 --> 2:09:24.200]  know when Trump is reelected hopefully he's got a battle plan and they say
[2:09:24.200 --> 2:09:27.040]  this intelligence is coming out tomorrow it's gonna expose the deep state coup
[2:09:27.040 --> 2:09:30.120]  against him I don't believe that because I mean Durham hasn't done anything yet
[2:09:30.120 --> 2:09:34.440]  but we'll get your take daughter Steve Pachennick an amazing insider for
[2:09:34.440 --> 2:09:42.280]  America on the other side Steve Pachennick.com I'm with 2020ElectionCenter.com. I'm Ellis Yovest.
[2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:49.760]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would
[2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:55.000]  track your GPS location I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't
[2:09:55.000 --> 2:09:59.920]  believe me because that was un-American now the media admits that almost every
[2:09:59.920 --> 2:10:04.360]  app and every company that are on Apple and on Droids don't just track your
[2:10:04.360 --> 2:10:09.080]  location but your surfing history where you go who you talk to your
[2:10:09.080 --> 2:10:13.320]  relationships and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing
[2:10:13.320 --> 2:10:17.880]  on the apps as well including having apps turn on and listen to what you're
[2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:23.560]  saying just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases transcripts of
[2:10:23.560 --> 2:10:28.080]  everything you say into those systems to be saved forever your phone is spying on
[2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:31.520]  you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on
[2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:35.960]  information this is the global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score get your
[2:10:35.960 --> 2:10:40.400]  protection privacy pockets at infowarstore.com and cut big brother off
[2:10:40.400 --> 2:10:45.320]  dead in his filthy tracks infowarstore.com
[2:10:45.320 --> 2:10:50.560]  The Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:55.040]  nation states and who give their power unto the one-world leader the Antichrist
[2:10:55.040 --> 2:11:00.320]  and he has a beast system that no one can buy and or sell unless he has that
[2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:05.680]  market in the forehead or in the palm of their hand and we look back on all the
[2:11:05.680 --> 2:11:09.640]  warnings you were given and all just the common sense that you don't believe in
[2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:15.720]  God or prophecy giving governments and corporations the power to control who
[2:11:15.720 --> 2:11:19.320]  can buy and who can sell to track everything we do he's not just a recipe
[2:11:19.320 --> 2:11:24.040]  it's a blueprint for total enslavement and now you look at Bill Gates you look
[2:11:24.040 --> 2:11:28.600]  at Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats we should decide how
[2:11:28.600 --> 2:11:32.800]  much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're
[2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:36.920]  technocrats we know best we're now gonna set up the economy with a social score to
[2:11:36.920 --> 2:11:41.760]  totally control you you snap your fingers we're here they're just rolling it out
[2:11:41.760 --> 2:11:46.320]  and a lot of people are complying with it it's insane
[2:11:46.320 --> 2:12:00.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:12:00.840 --> 2:12:07.000]  our guests and made a really important point earlier the only way this
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:11.600]  republic can fall is from within and our real power is our ideals of
[2:12:11.600 --> 2:12:16.440]  individualism that made us the apple of the world's eye but as we lose our
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:24.480]  cultural spiritual identity we become a house divided we can be a bunch of
[2:12:24.480 --> 2:12:27.520]  different color people if we believe in free market in America and rugged
[2:12:27.520 --> 2:12:31.320]  individualism we lose that well then our different colors and different
[2:12:31.320 --> 2:12:34.800]  backgrounds to become our weakness not our diversity it's true that America's
[2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:38.240]  diversity has been its strength in ideas and engineering and food and culture
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:41.520]  because other people places couldn't do it they always fought and destroyed
[2:12:41.520 --> 2:12:45.320]  themselves but our outside enemies the chai comms and others in Hollywood are
[2:12:45.320 --> 2:12:50.120]  doing this the tried and tested game of divide and conquer and so it was the
[2:12:50.120 --> 2:12:56.840]  Roman senator and historian Marcus Julius Cicero quotes on treason a nation
[2:12:56.840 --> 2:13:00.520]  can survive its fools and even the ambitious but it cannot survive treason
[2:13:00.520 --> 2:13:04.400]  from within an enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is known and
[2:13:04.400 --> 2:13:07.400]  carries his banner openly but the traitor moves amongst those within the
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:11.920]  gate freely his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys heard in the
[2:13:11.920 --> 2:13:15.800]  varying halls of government by itself and he goes on to say in the full quote
[2:13:15.800 --> 2:13:21.120]  that we can defeat outside enemies but the traitor is the plague and will bring
[2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:26.440]  down the city and when you look at the Democrats and Antifa and Soros I mean
[2:13:26.440 --> 2:13:32.000]  they say we want no borders no wall no USA at all and I get Dr. Pachennick your
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:38.240]  psychiatrist a smart guy you see that they put out their crisis they mean it
[2:13:38.240 --> 2:13:41.320]  but that you believe America will rise the occasion and counter it and make a
[2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:46.720]  stronger I'd like to not even go through that process and absolutely repudiate
[2:13:46.720 --> 2:13:50.160]  that just completely to deal with it and get rid of it and then have a new
[2:13:50.160 --> 2:13:53.800]  dialectic of excellence and super excellence not horrible communist
[2:13:53.800 --> 2:13:58.120]  collapse and dirt bags and scum and just pedophiles and devil worshipers
[2:13:58.120 --> 2:14:02.240]  versus decent Americans I'd rather have decent Americans versus super Americans
[2:14:02.240 --> 2:14:08.160]  I'd rather not have that that that wing of filth you get what I'm saying sure
[2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:14.320]  but remember one thing Alex you and I grew stronger and bigger because of the
[2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:20.080]  conflict within ourselves and the fact that we were challenged from the outside
[2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:26.200]  when you were stigmatized you went on and created a bigger show and it's not
[2:14:26.200 --> 2:14:30.240]  about you but I'm explaining it to your I don't we got much more powerful and
[2:14:30.240 --> 2:14:34.760]  stronger it's true right and and that is the example I want to talk to the
[2:14:34.760 --> 2:14:38.560]  audience and the facts don't lie that prosperity makes monsters adversity makes
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:45.440]  men correct and the bottom line the essence of our republic has always been
[2:14:45.440 --> 2:14:51.920]  serial entrepreneur the ability to take a risk and go with that risk you've got
[2:14:51.920 --> 2:14:57.520]  Daria from the Soviet Union Russia I'm coming from Cuba you've got immigrants
[2:14:57.520 --> 2:15:02.800]  from all over the world who've become very successful here because only in
[2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:07.880]  America and I've grown up in France Cuban elsewhere but only in America are you
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:13.360]  allowed to make mistakes and a mistake doesn't mean that you're gonna go in a
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:18.040]  bankruptcy a mistake doesn't mean like in France you cannot look you can't go up
[2:15:18.040 --> 2:15:21.940]  the cash system a mistake doesn't mean like in Russia where you go to the
[2:15:21.940 --> 2:15:27.480]  Gulags or in China where you had end up in in Hong Kong or some other prison
[2:15:27.480 --> 2:15:32.720]  here in America you can make those mistakes and the beauty of what we have
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:39.720]  in Trump is the very essence of an American political profile it's not
[2:15:39.720 --> 2:15:45.120]  Biden be kind Biden represent Trump is pure American it really is he's a pure
[2:15:45.120 --> 2:15:50.480]  American specimen you know what's beautiful Trump doesn't say a word
[2:15:50.480 --> 2:15:58.080]  about his uncle who happened to have been one of the greatest professors at MIT
[2:15:58.080 --> 2:16:03.680]  and developed radar in all but MIT now is talking about oh we have to have
[2:16:03.680 --> 2:16:08.560]  courses on integration of blacks what does that have to do with MIT
[2:16:08.560 --> 2:16:14.080]  Trump doesn't talk about the fact that he built 42nd Street he built Fifth
[2:16:14.080 --> 2:16:19.200]  Avenue he built the casinos in New Jersey he built the ice skating rings
[2:16:19.200 --> 2:16:24.000]  for my daughters for free in New York he hasn't talked about that he may say
[2:16:24.000 --> 2:16:27.640]  whatever he wants and I don't care and I've said it repeatedly on your show
[2:16:27.640 --> 2:16:34.120]  it's not what the man says is what he does in contrast we have a decadent
[2:16:34.120 --> 2:16:42.720]  pathetic Biden the complete adverse or converse of what American is about he
[2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:48.320]  became a politician at 27 he lied about his background he lied about how his
[2:16:48.320 --> 2:16:52.560]  wife was killed he lied about his corruption he lied about his
[2:16:52.560 --> 2:16:58.680]  achievements he started wars in Syria Libby Afghanistan and guess what this
[2:16:58.680 --> 2:17:03.000]  draft Dodger started a major war in Iraq and he doesn't want to talk about it
[2:17:03.000 --> 2:17:07.080]  yet and he's also very elitist towards everyone which which a lot of scumbags
[2:17:07.080 --> 2:17:12.000]  are because they're not really elites and he's well known to be a racist he he's
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:18.320]  everything that is a fool a moron and a corrupt into this he personifies the
[2:17:18.320 --> 2:17:25.680]  very opposite of Americanism that is the the man who is completely corrupt
[2:17:25.680 --> 2:17:32.120]  completely infested with evil if you want he's insulated he never has to take
[2:17:32.120 --> 2:17:37.520]  a risk he has the whole system protecting him he's stagnant he's not only stagnant
[2:17:37.520 --> 2:17:44.280]  he is the episode he is the epicenter of regression if we fail it's because we've
[2:17:44.280 --> 2:17:48.760]  come to a man like Biden he does not represent achievement he does not
[2:17:48.760 --> 2:17:53.480]  represent self-respect he does not represent decency he does not represent
[2:17:53.480 --> 2:17:58.680]  serving your republic when he was drafted oh he had asthma he couldn't go but
[2:17:58.680 --> 2:18:04.080]  he had no problems starting the Iraq war with 3,000 men he's specific I asked
[2:18:04.080 --> 2:18:07.000]  you the other day what on on Owens war room I said what would you say if you
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:11.560]  could talk to Biden and repeat that if you really chewed him up good I would
[2:18:11.560 --> 2:18:16.840]  say to him don't even think about running for con for the presidency it's not
[2:18:16.840 --> 2:18:22.400]  gonna happen you won't get there it will not happen the people like myself and
[2:18:22.400 --> 2:18:26.080]  others who know you all too well there you are with Richard House another
[2:18:26.080 --> 2:18:31.600]  disaster at the very essence of the of the Institute that I left the counts on
[2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:38.560]  foreign relations admitting that he had received billions of dollars in Ukraine
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:43.440]  I would make sure he will never run I would make sure that Kamala Harris
[2:18:43.440 --> 2:18:47.320]  that's another point why would he brag I said I'm gonna keep the billion dollars
[2:18:47.320 --> 2:18:50.440]  if you don't stop the investigation my son and they did what I told why would
[2:18:50.440 --> 2:18:55.440]  he admit a giant crime on TV he's a psychotic well he's not psychotic
[2:18:55.440 --> 2:19:00.640]  yes it's arrogance my friend if he was psychotic we will give him
[2:19:00.640 --> 2:19:03.800]  dispensation say oh he doesn't know you're running a real cycle would probably
[2:19:03.800 --> 2:19:07.520]  be smarter than why would you brag about a crime on air because you're a
[2:19:07.520 --> 2:19:11.640]  sociopath because you basically think you're gonna get away with everything
[2:19:11.640 --> 2:19:16.920]  and guess what Biden's gotten away with everything he's done corruption lying
[2:19:16.920 --> 2:19:23.240]  denying sake of thin I mean it's endless we have never and one of the issues
[2:19:23.240 --> 2:19:28.080]  that we talked about and oh no one's gone to jail Bush seat junior hasn't got
[2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:33.520]  to jail Cheney who created more wars and violated our national security never
[2:19:33.520 --> 2:19:39.520]  went to jail Colin Powell our big African-American general who lied like a
[2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:44.520]  banshee about his F his success in Vietnam and then he lied in Iraq
[2:19:44.520 --> 2:19:50.120]  Condoleezza Rice another African-American lied continuously we have
[2:19:50.120 --> 2:19:54.760]  pathological liars and guess what happens we promote them in positions of
[2:19:54.760 --> 2:19:59.520]  power so guys like you and me who want to say hey look you know the emperor has
[2:19:59.520 --> 2:20:04.400]  no clothes we're called conspiracy traitors am I concerned that the New
[2:20:04.400 --> 2:20:09.000]  York Times says I am a white supremacist literally because I wear a
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:15.560]  white shirt on your show that's what they call me no because the more I allow
[2:20:15.560 --> 2:20:20.200]  them to come with all kinds of absurdities and attack me the more they're
[2:20:20.200 --> 2:20:25.000]  going to self-destruct so what I'm saying to you let us continue what we are
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:29.360]  saying and doing and in turn Trump will come exactly stay there we're on the
[2:20:29.360 --> 2:20:33.480]  path to victory I'll look at this big COVID-19 Psyop where you think is going
[2:20:33.480 --> 2:20:36.680]  over see Pachennic he's kicking butt today and yeah they now say Hawaiian
[2:20:36.680 --> 2:20:40.040]  shirts or white supremacist the okay symbol everything is this is just
[2:20:40.040 --> 2:20:51.560]  they're projecting total mental illness on people the answer to 1984 is 1776
[2:20:51.560 --> 2:21:10.040]  Info wars has been banned arrested attacked and threatened because we are
[2:21:10.040 --> 2:21:17.760]  effective the great awakening is here go to band.video download the videos and
[2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:29.080]  share and support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up
[2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:32.080]  the fight
[2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:48.880]  Info wars.com and perhaps most cruelly of all if Donald Trump has his way the
[2:21:48.880 --> 2:21:55.960]  complications from COVID-19 which are well beyond what they should be it's
[2:21:55.960 --> 2:22:02.120]  estimated that 200 million people have died probably by the time I finished
[2:22:02.120 --> 2:22:06.680]  this talk Joe Biden has always been a congenital liar part of the
[2:22:06.680 --> 2:22:13.000]  establishment for close to 50 years but now boy as his brain degenerates we are
[2:22:13.000 --> 2:22:18.520]  seeing walking public dementia on the biggest stage in the world the 2020
[2:22:18.520 --> 2:22:23.640]  election there are 370 million people in the United States if 200 million died
[2:22:23.640 --> 2:22:28.160]  from COVID that'd be more than half of the population we're not even one tenth
[2:22:28.160 --> 2:22:32.720]  of one percent have actually died but him putting these giant lies and he's
[2:22:32.720 --> 2:22:37.080]  incredibly brain damaged statements out is emblematic of the general public
[2:22:37.080 --> 2:22:42.480]  being in a trance how is anyone even putting up with this it is beyond bizarre
[2:22:42.480 --> 2:22:49.880]  the future isn't coming it's here and in the future keeping your humanity saving
[2:22:49.880 --> 2:22:54.280]  your soul your integrity your very essence is going to be your most
[2:22:54.280 --> 2:22:59.720]  valuable asset in fact it's going to be your only asset the world being built
[2:22:59.720 --> 2:23:04.880]  by the technocrats the trap they've now sprung the COVID-19 and the endless
[2:23:04.880 --> 2:23:11.160]  lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into
[2:23:11.160 --> 2:23:17.680]  total and complete dehumanization human life will be impossible to be carried
[2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:24.040]  out in an original biological way by the year 2050 this is their stated goal
[2:23:24.040 --> 2:23:29.280]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you but only by
[2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:34.280]  facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy we turn
[2:23:34.280 --> 2:23:39.280]  this around you must study their own writings you must face the facts and you
[2:23:39.280 --> 2:23:44.400]  must come to grips with it you're all being incrementally destroyed
[2:23:44.400 --> 2:23:50.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:23:59.400 --> 2:24:04.600]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
[2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:10.960]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you got one
[2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:17.960]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:39.440]  I remember going over convincing our team or there's two convincing us that
[2:24:39.440 --> 2:24:44.440]  we should be providing for loan guarantees and I went over I guess the
[2:24:44.440 --> 2:24:50.280]  12 13th time to keep and and I was going supposed to announce that there was
[2:24:50.280 --> 2:24:54.840]  another billion dollar loan guarantee and I had gotten a commitment from
[2:24:54.840 --> 2:25:00.000]  poroshenko and from yachts and yoke that they would take action against the
[2:25:00.000 --> 2:25:03.760]  state prosecutor and they didn't so they said they had it they were walking out
[2:25:03.760 --> 2:25:07.320]  to press conference and I said I'm not gonna we're not gonna give you the
[2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:11.240]  billion dollars they said you have no authority you're not the president the
[2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:15.480]  president said I said call him I said I'm telling you you're not getting the
[2:25:15.480 --> 2:25:18.840]  billion dollars I said you're not getting the billion I'm gonna be leaving
[2:25:18.840 --> 2:25:22.720]  here I think it was what six hours I look I said leaving the six hours if the
[2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:28.160]  prosecutor is not fired you're not getting the money oh son of a bitch got
[2:25:28.160 --> 2:25:36.760]  fired and they put in place someone who was solid oh solid you know so so what
[2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:42.600]  is the need on national TV on ceaseband dr. Steve botanic to brag that you just
[2:25:42.600 --> 2:25:48.040]  ended a criminal investigation with a billion-dollar bribe again you you're
[2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:52.320]  right it's it's hoodspots arrogance is bravado because he's gotten away with it
[2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:58.440]  so far the reason listen Alex and the audience has I'm gonna stand and and we
[2:25:58.440 --> 2:26:03.360]  brought it up with Owen shawyer yesterday if no one is arrested I mean
[2:26:03.360 --> 2:26:09.920]  literally no one we should have arrested Comey for all the violations of the
[2:26:09.920 --> 2:26:16.040]  Constitution we should have arrested the CIA Gina Haskell for torturing we
[2:26:16.040 --> 2:26:21.560]  should have arrested the heads of this FBI for all kinds of intransigence and
[2:26:21.560 --> 2:26:27.320]  corruption we haven't done that as long as no one is arrested and as long as
[2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:34.120]  Trump brought in a John Bolton a Kelly whatever all of these guys who had been
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:39.800]  in the administrations before and had been corrupt and are profiting them as
[2:26:39.800 --> 2:26:44.480]  long as we have Simon and Schuster which is not a publishing company now it's
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:50.320]  now a propaganda machine against Trump we have never held anybody accountable
[2:26:50.320 --> 2:26:55.320]  except those of us on the alternative right or whatever you want to call us
[2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:59.800]  the conservatives we make our own life we don't depend on the kindness of
[2:26:59.800 --> 2:27:05.160]  strangers and we have to and we give our life to the Republic none of which
[2:27:05.160 --> 2:27:09.560]  occurs in this in the Biden administration Biden as I told you he's
[2:27:09.560 --> 2:27:14.040]  totally corrupt he's an idiot he's seen how demanded that New York Times you
[2:27:14.040 --> 2:27:17.080]  said that like two years ago and now they're having a minute so let me ask
[2:27:17.080 --> 2:27:20.960]  you this what are they gonna do with all the publishers all the media all the
[2:27:20.960 --> 2:27:25.680]  foreign money all the King's horses all the Kingsman Hollywood cannot prop him
[2:27:25.680 --> 2:27:30.160]  up when do they start to give up because I agree we have people power we have
[2:27:30.160 --> 2:27:33.800]  common sense humanities awakening what are they gonna do psychologically as a
[2:27:33.800 --> 2:27:38.200]  psychiatrist you know group diagnosing them are they gonna do a new ghost dance
[2:27:38.200 --> 2:27:43.200]  what are they gonna pull now what they're doing right now is they're giving
[2:27:43.200 --> 2:27:48.040]  they're really screaming for the last moments of their own existence let's get
[2:27:48.040 --> 2:27:51.080]  an example of hollywood that's it so that way they can win just to get more
[2:27:51.080 --> 2:27:55.840]  donor money they're like my dad in college was a exterminator and he said
[2:27:55.840 --> 2:27:59.680]  that when you'd spray cockroaches with poison in these horrible places they'd
[2:27:59.680 --> 2:28:03.720]  send them into you like a city contract he said they would start fornicating the
[2:28:03.720 --> 2:28:06.680]  roaches would just party once they were poisoned and so I think what we're
[2:28:06.680 --> 2:28:10.680]  seeing is the last gas like you said kind of a the death rows it's the death
[2:28:10.680 --> 2:28:16.000]  rows because number one who did he put up as vice president cabal Harris
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:22.240]  mother's Indian she attends Camilla attends a Buddhist temple father was a
[2:28:22.240 --> 2:28:27.800]  major professor emeritus from Stanford 20 years of her life were not in
[2:28:27.800 --> 2:28:33.480]  America she did not serve her country she's went to Montreal so she should run
[2:28:33.480 --> 2:28:38.560]  for Prime Minister of Montreal but she's not an American you have in contrast
[2:28:38.560 --> 2:28:44.760]  Mike Pence governor state senator US senator and now the vice president
[2:28:44.760 --> 2:28:50.600]  Christian American clearly understands America clearly will debate her tonight
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:55.760]  but you've got an American persona versus somebody who has been put in from
[2:28:55.760 --> 2:29:00.320]  Canada and doesn't belong like Obama did not have a very American pedigree
[2:29:00.320 --> 2:29:03.080]  certainly in Harvard he said he was from Kenya we know now it's really from
[2:29:03.080 --> 2:29:06.280]  Hawaii why does the why do the globalists ever want to give us a real
[2:29:06.280 --> 2:29:11.880]  American because we have one institution that has to be taken down you asked me
[2:29:11.880 --> 2:29:18.480]  which one it would be the CIA number one all of the operatives that we've had so
[2:29:18.480 --> 2:29:25.600]  far Obama never never was an organizer in Chicago Obama was the son of an
[2:29:25.600 --> 2:29:30.360]  operative in Indonesia she spoke Russian he was the grandson of two
[2:29:30.360 --> 2:29:35.160]  operatives who worked for me in the east-west center in Hawaii I eat east-west
[2:29:35.160 --> 2:29:41.160]  center is the banking institution for the CIA he was CIA never went to Columbia
[2:29:41.160 --> 2:29:46.120]  went to Occidental what's an Occidental College in Los Angeles a second-rate
[2:29:46.120 --> 2:29:52.160]  school but it has third-rate ex CIA operatives teaching there and Occidental
[2:29:52.160 --> 2:29:57.600]  he was an operative that's why he lied he consistently created wars he
[2:29:57.600 --> 2:30:03.000]  consistent he had more wars than anybody I've ever seen Somalia Sudan Yemen
[2:30:03.000 --> 2:30:08.960]  Iraq Afghanistan Syria all with the help of Hillary Clinton another one of your
[2:30:08.960 --> 2:30:15.440]  CIA operatives went to Yale Bill Clinton Bush senior Bush Jr. between Harvard and
[2:30:15.440 --> 2:30:20.680]  Yale you produce more detritus in this country than you could ever imagine the
[2:30:20.680 --> 2:30:26.000]  good news however is the Harvard and the Yale's and the Hollywood's are dying why
[2:30:26.000 --> 2:30:30.640]  because you said 15 years ago Hollywood would die and you know and the
[2:30:30.640 --> 2:30:34.640]  east and west coast would collapse you were all right about that so looking 26
[2:30:34.640 --> 2:30:39.600]  days out they say they're gonna they already have the court some thing they're
[2:30:39.600 --> 2:30:43.800]  gonna hold up the ballots what what about their strategy him to act like
[2:30:43.800 --> 2:30:46.360]  Trump is illegitimate yet again what do you think Trump should do because I
[2:30:46.360 --> 2:30:50.240]  agree without jail time here's some examples breaking handwritten notes by
[2:30:50.240 --> 2:30:55.320]  O.G.C. attorney released day after General Flynn ambush interview DOJ
[2:30:55.320 --> 2:30:59.560]  admits it altered notes President Trump authorizes totally classification of all
[2:30:59.560 --> 2:31:04.520]  doctors related to spy gate DOJ announces press commerce tomorrow are you
[2:31:04.520 --> 2:31:09.920]  expecting any teeth for this because they've got to take action I would hope
[2:31:09.920 --> 2:31:13.920]  this teeth what I would do if I were Trump and again that was an issue that
[2:31:13.920 --> 2:31:17.280]  you and I've talked about I didn't think he was as tough as he should have been
[2:31:17.280 --> 2:31:22.640]  he should have swept out all of these people I would present the fact that we
[2:31:22.640 --> 2:31:26.840]  have a lot of arrests coming in the forefront either for pedophilia
[2:31:26.840 --> 2:31:32.120]  corruption or whatever else he wants to the fact of the matter is he will go
[2:31:32.120 --> 2:31:36.760]  back and he's probably going to announce the arrest to give confidence to people
[2:31:36.760 --> 2:31:39.520]  that are scared under him so if the Democrats keep announcing he's gonna be
[2:31:39.520 --> 2:31:43.600]  impeached he's gonna be killed he's gonna be could they're doing that hoping
[2:31:43.600 --> 2:31:47.600]  someone tries it he actually has the law and history on his hands he needs to
[2:31:47.600 --> 2:31:52.160]  lead upfront saying arrest them now he does that we win I think he needs to do
[2:31:52.160 --> 2:31:58.080]  it I agree with you but will he do it I don't know I don't think so I'm afraid
[2:31:58.080 --> 2:32:03.480]  that's what he needs to do if he speaks to you he speaks to Roger or anyone else
[2:32:03.480 --> 2:32:09.440]  the point of time is now do I think he will come into power again yes the
[2:32:09.440 --> 2:32:14.760]  simple reason is he will refuse to leave the presidency and he should because
[2:32:14.760 --> 2:32:18.680]  there's ballot harvesting what's happening now is the Democrats are
[2:32:18.680 --> 2:32:23.640]  harvesting the ballots that were already procured months ago or weeks ago
[2:32:23.640 --> 2:32:30.360]  you given an example of a Somalian crook Ilana Omar who came from Somalia was
[2:32:30.360 --> 2:32:35.440]  born of another crook her father was a colonel in the Somalian army a total
[2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:40.280]  corrupt individual she was indicted three times but never went to prison for
[2:32:40.280 --> 2:32:45.720]  irregularities in her campaign using campaign money using money in the
[2:32:45.720 --> 2:32:51.760]  campaign for her divorce and now she's hired Mohammed to buy all the ballots up
[2:32:51.760 --> 2:32:57.200]  in Minneapolis and elsewhere and nothing's done to her there has to be a
[2:32:57.200 --> 2:33:03.200]  carry-through action she's totally agree I mean they are publicly saying they're
[2:33:03.200 --> 2:33:06.600]  going to steal the election and not take the results so I just think Trump has
[2:33:06.600 --> 2:33:11.680]  to attack it head-on I agree with you that's what I would do now I would get
[2:33:11.680 --> 2:33:16.360]  in the forefront just as he did as he left Walter Reed Hospital said good bye
[2:33:16.360 --> 2:33:22.640]  to Fauci I said months ago a year ago Tony Fauci was out of his league he is
[2:33:22.640 --> 2:33:27.840]  self-agreed about what you think needs to come next with 26 days out 104
[2:33:27.840 --> 2:33:30.920]  inaugurations they're gonna contest this election but how do we discredit it
[2:33:30.920 --> 2:33:34.160]  up front we know it's fraudulent how do we discredit it now we gotta get ahead
[2:33:34.160 --> 2:33:42.400]  of it now not wait and let them call the shots we'll be right back we've now
[2:33:42.400 --> 2:33:46.560]  entered month number eight of the global lockdown and it's horrible and it's
[2:33:46.560 --> 2:33:50.480]  killing millions of people via starvation but the good news is it's
[2:33:50.480 --> 2:33:55.960]  caused a planetary awakening as well the general public all over the planet
[2:33:55.960 --> 2:34:01.160]  hate Bill Gates he's the most unpopular person on earth people know he's not a
[2:34:01.160 --> 2:34:06.320]  doctor people know he's a eugenicist the population knows that his vaccines that
[2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:11.200]  he pushes have been filled with cancer viruses polio sterilence and more it's
[2:34:11.200 --> 2:34:16.480]  even in the associated press so now they are beginning to understand that we the
[2:34:16.480 --> 2:34:21.000]  people know that there is a corporate global government and the beast top tech
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:25.840]  billionaires sit in meetings and decide to pull the type of race war scams the
[2:34:25.840 --> 2:34:30.560]  coronavirus scams that we're witnessing so remember that and let them know that
[2:34:30.560 --> 2:34:35.440]  we know who they are and what they've done and we hold them responsible for
[2:34:35.440 --> 2:34:40.880]  the collapse of civilization they are the enemies of humanity they want you

[2:35:57.800 --> 2:36:02.440]  a bad name by the 1920s they started converting over and funding other
[2:36:02.440 --> 2:36:07.120]  organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics
[2:36:07.120 --> 2:36:13.360]  operations fast forward to the 1980s the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on
[2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:17.680]  the board of directors to Bill Gates the third his father of course being had a

[2:38:20.240 --> 2:38:24.200]  has your own perspective but and I know you're a confident guy and you did tell
[2:38:24.200 --> 2:38:29.560]  me stuff 16 17 18 years on air that I wasn't rolling my eyes you're like the
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:32.760]  east coast will collapse the west coast will collapse America will be reborn in
[2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:37.880]  the south and the midwest and an area is the western u.s. and the left will be a
[2:38:37.880 --> 2:38:41.120]  joke try to bring down America in the process she definitely did your research
[2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:44.520]  nobody was saying that back then you said hollywood's done and I know you've
[2:38:44.520 --> 2:38:47.120]  made big movies there have been very successful you said that on the air like
[2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:51.840]  15 years ago I was like really all I know is I was on the green belt today and a
[2:38:51.840 --> 2:38:54.840]  guy saw me not wearing a mask or at least a dog that ran over and bit me he
[2:38:54.840 --> 2:38:58.880]  goes good job and when I started smashing the dogs head in he got upset and
[2:38:58.880 --> 2:39:02.200]  said I'm gonna call the police I said go ahead your dog bit me the left is
[2:39:02.200 --> 2:39:08.480]  getting crazed with with with with with with all this here's Chris Hayes info
[2:39:08.480 --> 2:39:16.120]  wars.com MSNBC's Chris Hayes promotes reeducation camps for anti-maskers I've
[2:39:16.120 --> 2:39:21.440]  got all these videos of every 10 minutes trigger Democrat pulls knife on
[2:39:21.440 --> 2:39:24.280]  woman for Trump supporters threatens to kill them because they're Trump
[2:39:24.280 --> 2:39:27.720]  supporters I mean I had a dog attack me today and these people and the guy said
[2:39:27.720 --> 2:39:31.160]  good job I said good job I grabbed his dogs are to punch in it I think it's
[2:39:31.160 --> 2:39:34.400]  funny you just sick he's like you're attacking my dog I said yeah dude you
[2:39:34.400 --> 2:39:38.920]  attack me you're looking at and kill your dog so these people are crazed and
[2:39:38.920 --> 2:39:42.800]  it's like their live-action role-players you know these groups that go out with
[2:39:42.800 --> 2:39:47.960]  rubber swords and shields and beat each other and actually believe they're in
[2:39:47.960 --> 2:39:52.760]  World of Warcraft or Game of Thrones they do that where it's like they'll come
[2:39:52.760 --> 2:39:55.960]  over and punch somebody in the face and when you punch them back they call the
[2:39:55.960 --> 2:40:01.000]  police so you're the psychiatrist and not just some quack psychiatrists you should
[2:40:01.000 --> 2:40:04.720]  be in psychological operations you know for for the State Department what the
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:09.480]  hell is going on with these crazies and what are they trying to do and where
[2:40:09.480 --> 2:40:14.360]  does this go because it's getting out of control basically what they're trying to
[2:40:14.360 --> 2:40:19.960]  do is to intimidate those of us who really want to support Trump and support
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:24.920]  the conservative values and support the ideals of America the simple answer to
[2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:31.080]  what you're really asking is do we create a counter-adject problem I would say yes
[2:40:31.080 --> 2:40:38.560]  but does Trump really can Trump order his US Marshals to arrest Comey to arrest
[2:40:38.560 --> 2:40:45.200]  Flynn to arrest Aiden to arrest a whole bunch of these guys including you know
[2:40:45.200 --> 2:40:50.520]  a brand and let the left explode if they want to fight let's have one no no but
[2:40:50.520 --> 2:40:54.520]  that's what I would do yeah yeah tell us tell us what you do because you used to
[2:40:54.520 --> 2:40:58.080]  be been highly respected you've helped change regimes we have a communist
[2:40:58.080 --> 2:41:01.120]  globalist attempt to throw overthrow of our country how would you counter these
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:04.800]  foreign enemies right now if you were Trump well one of the things I would do
[2:41:04.800 --> 2:41:09.560]  is start arresting all the major players here I'd go after Ilan Omar I would go
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:14.000]  after Biden for saying that you have a history of corruption within the United
[2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:22.360]  States I would go after Brennan for that damaging the CIA I would go after Gina
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:27.280]  Haskell and get rid of her go after Comey and I would arrest him I would leave
[2:41:27.280 --> 2:41:32.440]  Obama alone I would leave Hillary alone but I start to arrest all the people
[2:41:32.440 --> 2:41:38.200]  that are in that purview around the Democrats and start rounding them up and
[2:41:38.200 --> 2:41:42.600]  saying you know what you want to play this game we're gonna play it I have full
[2:41:42.600 --> 2:41:48.080]  respect for Cyrus St. Junior I knew his father but he spent months to find the
[2:41:48.080 --> 2:41:54.120]  tax results on or the tax exemption whatever Trump has done or will do
[2:41:54.120 --> 2:41:59.840]  nobody in the America gives a damn about Trump's taxes and that's my point if
[2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:03.560]  you want to waste your time in American dollars there was no Russia there was no
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:09.440]  Russia there excuse me there was no Russia in the taxes no there was no
[2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:14.080]  Russia there was nothing but if you really want to be ruthless you go in and
[2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:20.800]  start arresting one after another and by the time you've arrested four or five
[2:42:20.800 --> 2:42:25.360]  of these people even when the marshals is showing up even when you're arresting
[2:42:25.360 --> 2:42:31.680]  one of your own in the FBI Comey in particular a Brennan in the CIA I agree
[2:42:31.680 --> 2:42:34.840]  they will all turn on each other overnight they've never had retribution
[2:42:34.840 --> 2:42:39.840]  they've never paid they will fold like a house of cards in a high wind the minute
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:43.280]  Trump engages in real leadership and I'm not an authoritarian they're the ones
[2:42:43.280 --> 2:42:45.760]  trying to overthrow the president they're the ones trying to get me arrested
[2:42:45.760 --> 2:42:50.840]  they're the ones trying to get it's time to punch back well not really let me
[2:42:50.840 --> 2:42:55.520]  explain something I've been involved in a few soft cues in the United States a
[2:42:55.520 --> 2:43:00.000]  soft clue and I'll explain this to your audience means we do not use the
[2:43:00.000 --> 2:43:07.040]  military one was a transfer of power from Nixon to Ford that was a necessity
[2:43:07.040 --> 2:43:11.320]  I wasn't saying use the military when I say punch back I mean understand that
[2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:15.600]  but there's another soft clue that occurred in the Bush junior junior
[2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:19.840]  administration when he was warned by me and others that you will pay the price
[2:43:19.840 --> 2:43:26.160]  for 9-11 for killing our boys in in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as Cheney
[2:43:26.160 --> 2:43:33.400]  they put in a man who would in Rumsfeld who was a disaster and by the ability
[2:43:33.400 --> 2:43:39.680]  what I whatever I did we had gotten rid of Rumsfeld and put in Gates Gates last
[2:43:39.680 --> 2:43:44.640]  message to me in particular and to the country was under no condition should
[2:43:44.640 --> 2:43:50.480]  there be a coup well I will take those words from Gates and say think about
[2:43:50.480 --> 2:43:56.400]  what you just said Gates and 20 years later there will be you know repercussions
[2:43:56.400 --> 2:44:03.800]  for that you do not get away with violating the Constitution violating
[2:44:03.800 --> 2:44:09.840]  the treaties peace treaties and go into war or corrupt our systems and then
[2:44:09.840 --> 2:44:15.960]  think you can profit from it and suddenly get away Bush junior never paid for it
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:20.360]  Bush senior never paid for it Cheney one of the worst chicken hawks in the world
[2:44:20.360 --> 2:44:25.520]  got away with it Steve Hadley Wolf it says a whole bunch of these guys but
[2:44:25.520 --> 2:44:29.600]  now if I were Trump and I were in the White House I'd start bringing in the
[2:44:29.600 --> 2:44:34.520]  U.S. Marshals start to arrest them and let them complain let the New York Times
[2:44:34.520 --> 2:44:39.880]  isn't there under the Constitution the President can sign warrants well he could
[2:44:39.880 --> 2:44:44.560]  demand he could say a state of emergency I wrote that novel 20 years ago where we
[2:44:44.560 --> 2:44:48.080]  created a state and that's what they really fear is the insurrection act I
[2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:51.600]  say he declares it because I'm not a I'm not a martial law guy they're the ones
[2:44:51.600 --> 2:44:55.080]  having leftist martial law they're the ones doing it all I just say declares
[2:44:55.080 --> 2:44:59.240]  insurrection and then arrest the leaders of the globalist operation if you want
[2:44:59.240 --> 2:45:03.840]  to have into father you want to have fascism in the streets you want to kill
[2:45:03.840 --> 2:45:09.240]  people fine I will bring back the insurrection I will bring back the
[2:45:09.240 --> 2:45:14.680]  police I will bring back the national security dicta I will arrest those that
[2:45:14.680 --> 2:45:20.000]  I need to arrest and if I can't complete the action that's fine too I just want
[2:45:20.000 --> 2:45:24.040]  to hold them in prison for a while and make them understand you're not playing
[2:45:24.040 --> 2:45:31.000]  games with Trump is Trump strong enough and fearful enough to do that I'm not
[2:45:31.000 --> 2:45:35.840]  sure I would clearly do that I have no problem I've done it before and I will
[2:45:35.840 --> 2:45:39.320]  do it agree with you that they've they've brought us this point like we're
[2:45:39.320 --> 2:45:42.040]  like starting this they're literally saying they're gonna overthrow the
[2:45:42.040 --> 2:45:45.440]  government and get rid of the country's existence I mean when you you're not an
[2:45:45.440 --> 2:45:48.680]  American when you start talking like that that's not free speech that's
[2:45:48.680 --> 2:45:54.160]  sedition correct let me give you an example when I was I went down to Panama
[2:45:54.160 --> 2:45:59.080]  and I was my mission was to take out Noriega I had a wonderful dinner with
[2:45:59.080 --> 2:46:03.080]  him for three to four hours we talked about everything he wanted to be a
[2:46:03.080 --> 2:46:07.360]  psychiatrist I explained to him the next day I started blowing up things I
[2:46:07.360 --> 2:46:11.600]  started agit prop I started fires he brought in his own people and
[2:46:11.600 --> 2:46:16.640]  eventually he was taken out but the excuse wasn't what I wanted Bush Senior
[2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:20.760]  wanted to bring in paratroopers and I was against that I didn't want to
[2:46:20.760 --> 2:46:26.000]  sacrifice our men for what was already accomplished by taking him out without
[2:46:26.000 --> 2:46:31.400]  using our soldiers so my point of contention is very simple you want to
[2:46:31.400 --> 2:46:36.480]  create a state of emergency let's do it let's start rounding up the people who
[2:46:36.480 --> 2:46:40.360]  are the ones in Intifada let's start rounding up the people who are funding
[2:46:40.360 --> 2:46:45.120]  it and they're gonna understand what a totalitarian government really means
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:49.440]  and the reactionary force my next question I know you say Soros is old in
[2:46:49.440 --> 2:46:53.000]  the front man it's his money who's behind him because every time I kick over a
[2:46:53.000 --> 2:46:57.760]  rock it's his funding shutting down speech funding BLM Antifa what the hell
[2:46:57.760 --> 2:47:03.400]  is George Soros bulletproof for he's bulletproof because it works for us CIA
[2:47:03.400 --> 2:47:10.080]  you don't let me explain something the most lethal organization born none was
[2:47:10.080 --> 2:47:16.800]  is and it has been the CIA most of these people have come in and out why can I
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:22.760]  say that because for 30 years the CIA has wanted me to join them and I said go
[2:47:22.760 --> 2:47:28.280]  to hell there's no way I'm joining you I will arrest your people I will take them
[2:47:28.280 --> 2:47:32.880]  out if I need and I will throw you out but there's no way I'm joining you I
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:37.160]  may have been trained by you but I was trained by the military my loyalty is
[2:47:37.160 --> 2:47:41.800]  to the Republic the Soros the government explain that because people don't get
[2:47:41.800 --> 2:47:45.760]  the different factions of the government when you hear about CIA and the
[2:47:45.760 --> 2:47:48.360]  national security I people think oh that must be the whole government no that's
[2:47:48.360 --> 2:47:53.720]  one group is true Soros ran a bunch of anti-russian operations he is CIA that's
[2:47:53.720 --> 2:47:58.400]  why he's been protected and now they all get immunity once they've been high
[2:47:58.400 --> 2:48:05.520]  level CIA like Obama or Hillary or Soros and then now they can commit any
[2:48:05.520 --> 2:48:10.320]  crime they want stay there back in back in 60 seconds if this is supposedly a
[2:48:10.320 --> 2:48:14.120]  fundraiser I'm not doing a good job but it's info wars dot com we got big
[2:48:14.120 --> 2:48:18.360]  discounts the products and but donate buttons keep us on the year we're more
[2:48:18.360 --> 2:48:21.520]  influential than ever we reach as many people as ever but finance wise the
[2:48:21.520 --> 2:48:24.960]  enemy's been successful cutting us off from fun so you need your support give
[2:48:24.960 --> 2:48:36.120]  a cover to America the Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that
[2:48:36.120 --> 2:48:40.280]  sit above the nation states and who give their power under the one-world
[2:48:40.280 --> 2:48:45.840]  leader the anti-christ and he has a beast system that no one can buy and or sell
[2:48:45.840 --> 2:48:50.000]  unless he has that marked in the forehead or in the palm of their hand and we
[2:48:50.000 --> 2:48:55.840]  look back all the warnings you were given and all just a common sense that
[2:48:55.840 --> 2:49:01.560]  even believe in God or prophecy giving governments corporations the power to
[2:49:01.560 --> 2:49:05.680]  control who can buy and who can sell to track everything we do he's not just a
[2:49:05.680 --> 2:49:09.600]  recipe it's a blueprint for total enslavement and now you look at Bill
[2:49:09.600 --> 2:49:14.560]  Gates you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats we
[2:49:14.560 --> 2:49:18.600]  should decide how much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat
[2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:22.960]  you get we're technocrats we know best we're now gonna set up the economy with
[2:49:22.960 --> 2:49:27.560]  a social score to totally control you you snap your fingers we're here they're
[2:49:27.560 --> 2:49:34.000]  just rolling it out and a lot of people are complying with it it's insane the
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:39.320]  globalists are very very honest about their planetary goals they want private
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:46.120]  corporate governance above nation states above religious institutions above the
[2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:51.120]  family they want total corporate power there was a great film back in the
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:57.280]  early 1970s called rollerball with James Kahn that's based on a novel set in
[2:49:57.280 --> 2:50:02.360]  the year 2020 and in the book you have mega corporations that control the
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:08.160]  planet there are no longer nation states there are only cities that are the
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:12.840]  capitals of the corporations if you actually read what the most group of
[2:50:12.840 --> 2:50:18.240]  CFR trial commission say in the year 2020 that is their in-game that is their
[2:50:18.240 --> 2:50:23.400]  goal so we're talking about a hunger games type scenario here run by very
[2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:28.120]  very very ruthless people see us as shadow they're using COVID-19 as their
[2:50:28.120 --> 2:50:34.240]  takeover strategy communist China as their model we must reject it now
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:45.720]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show the only two things in life that make
[2:50:45.720 --> 2:50:52.840]  it worth living it's guitars too good and firm feeling women all right pulling
[2:50:52.840 --> 2:50:56.240]  back from I don't need my name in the people think this government is
[2:50:56.240 --> 2:50:59.640]  monolithic but it's all different factions different groups and that's why
[2:50:59.640 --> 2:51:03.280]  I would be ashamed to say I'm with the CIA oh Jones does all this I did this with
[2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:07.000]  my listeners and all of you together I'm not worthy of the CIA the CIA is like a
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:09.640]  big diverse different organization as well but not a patient was talking about
[2:51:09.640 --> 2:51:12.560]  where the State Department working in regime change you know we're doing
[2:51:12.560 --> 2:51:15.880]  different camp David Accord's famous you all that stuff back in the past right
[2:51:15.880 --> 2:51:20.480]  through to now and he's here with us for a few more minutes you're talking about
[2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:25.200]  the political rot in there and why Soros is untouchable or even Newt
[2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:30.800]  Enrich criticizes him on Fox and they say you can't do that when Soros is on a
[2:51:30.800 --> 2:51:33.840]  record funding black lives matter and anti-fund gives press conferences
[2:51:33.840 --> 2:51:38.440]  bragging but then if you say he does it Fox won't let you say it but as you said
[2:51:38.440 --> 2:51:43.440]  it's because he represents the same group Obama and Hillary do this old corrupt
[2:51:43.440 --> 2:51:49.280]  entitled just group of parasites who I think you're figuring out now doctor
[2:51:49.280 --> 2:51:56.080]  powers coming to an end that's correct basically what's happening in without
[2:51:56.080 --> 2:52:02.000]  going too far forward you basically said it in your ad the real culprits of the
[2:52:02.000 --> 2:52:07.280]  future the near future right now will be the ones that Trump will go after that's
[2:52:07.280 --> 2:52:15.240]  Facebook Google Amazon and other big tech because they have transformed
[2:52:15.240 --> 2:52:21.360]  themselves way beyond the nation state and they are a function of a small
[2:52:21.360 --> 2:52:26.400]  company that I may have described last time Paul Incutel which was created by
[2:52:26.400 --> 2:52:32.720]  the CIA in 1999 I kind of helped them out where they funded out of Alexandria
[2:52:32.720 --> 2:52:37.400]  Virginia a whole group of these startup companies that which at that time were
[2:52:37.400 --> 2:52:42.120]  little baby high tech companies and eventually became much bigger and became
[2:52:42.120 --> 2:52:46.800]  multi-billion-dollar entities those are the companies that will determine the
[2:52:46.800 --> 2:52:50.800]  outcome in the future of the United States if the president of the United
[2:52:50.800 --> 2:52:56.560]  States does not begin to break them up that's what we need to do in order to
[2:52:56.560 --> 2:53:01.400]  maintain the viability of the Republic which I still believe in even in the
[2:53:01.400 --> 2:53:06.920]  future the big tech companies have to be broken up the people who have
[2:53:06.920 --> 2:53:11.680]  committed crimes or about to make crimes will be rounded up or will be
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:16.880]  arrested there's no other alternative to that because if it's not happening now
[2:53:16.880 --> 2:53:22.360]  then the concept of consequences of gone and you and I will keep talking about it
[2:53:22.360 --> 2:53:27.480]  in that infinitum and we don't have that kind of patience the third part and the
[2:53:27.480 --> 2:53:32.440]  most important part is that Trump will come into power he will remain in power
[2:53:32.440 --> 2:53:37.560]  there'll be no question about that in the process of remaining into power he
[2:53:37.560 --> 2:53:43.760]  has to restruct restructured the economy in such a way that we're
[2:53:43.760 --> 2:53:49.040]  booming again that we have an 8 to 10 percent growth rate that 17 million
[2:53:49.040 --> 2:53:54.200]  unemployed will come back to work and that the small businesses will be
[2:53:54.200 --> 2:54:00.200]  created because that is the backbone of our country we not Americana and the
[2:54:00.200 --> 2:54:03.400]  enjoyment of being here the captain of your own life and obviously covid's a
[2:54:03.400 --> 2:54:08.280]  real thing but been overblown as a power grab other the Democrats are have
[2:54:08.280 --> 2:54:11.400]  failed they thought they could blame Trump for the shutdown when they're the
[2:54:11.400 --> 2:54:17.200]  ones doing it well whoever it is it's not relevant anymore it's he who can
[2:54:17.200 --> 2:54:26.120]  correct it and turn I would fire Fauci I would fire from her sideline him well
[2:54:26.120 --> 2:54:31.520]  it's not enough that the problem is I think it would be repudiated he has to
[2:54:31.520 --> 2:54:35.920]  be fired is no issue whether the South the Grand Dye thing narcissists who
[2:54:35.920 --> 2:54:40.560]  created nothing he didn't create a vaccine I had to run the Ebola epidemic
[2:54:40.560 --> 2:54:46.080]  with 3,000 soldiers thanks to general Dempsey who afforded them to me and in
[2:54:46.080 --> 2:54:50.720]  truth he's created no textbook nothing and then the same thing with Redfield
[2:54:50.720 --> 2:54:57.160]  he's a disaster so it's time for Trump not only to formulate his security but
[2:54:57.160 --> 2:55:02.520]  also to hold all these institutions accountable and start taking them now we
[2:55:02.520 --> 2:55:07.560]  have two million people in the federal government we do not need them I do not
[2:55:07.560 --> 2:55:15.240]  need HHS I do not need CDC I do not need an FBI I do not need a CIA I have 15
[2:55:15.240 --> 2:55:19.920]  other intelligence units that are useless and then they'll just become groups
[2:55:19.920 --> 2:55:23.600]  that shaker tell feather to corporations and foreign governments to sell out
[2:55:23.600 --> 2:55:26.760]  America and then we try to set the country back they say we're traders
[2:55:26.760 --> 2:55:32.240]  Steve Pachinic.com amazing interview sir thank you so much and God bless your
[2:55:32.240 --> 2:55:36.200]  audience God bless them as well yes all right we're gonna come back I'm up the

[2:55:39.200 --> 2:55:48.440]  with us hello my name is Dr. Fauci and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:54.480]  and I've overseen well you know the AIDS pandemic and so many other things and I
[2:55:54.480 --> 2:56:01.120]  take my orders from Bill Gates Dr. Bill Gates I mean he's not a doctor but he
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:06.960]  controls everything you do and he now says you're going to take the shots
[2:56:06.960 --> 2:56:12.320]  and of course in England they are now saying what I told you you will not be
[2:56:12.320 --> 2:56:18.520]  allowed to travel leave your home until you take all the shots Dr. Gates I mean
[2:56:18.520 --> 2:56:24.720]  Bill Gates your owner your master says you will have to take four to five
[2:56:24.720 --> 2:56:33.000]  COVID shots a year for adult to for baby here baby me much more manageable just
[2:56:33.000 --> 2:56:56.760]  like Bill Gates give you polio a vaccine I'm Dr. Fauci reminds you that we owe you
[2:56:56.760 --> 2:57:00.320]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen we're into the fourth hour of this worldwide
[2:57:00.320 --> 2:57:08.480]  transmission that means they've been I was on eight nine ten three hours already
[2:57:08.480 --> 2:57:14.200]  done three hours so that's six hours we're into hour number seven of the 40
[2:57:14.200 --> 2:57:22.040]  hour worldwide broadcast and you know here's my own problem I've been so close
[2:57:22.040 --> 2:57:25.280]  to this problem so close to world government so close to implantable
[2:57:25.280 --> 2:57:29.280]  microchips so close to force inoculations reading it and studying
[2:57:29.280 --> 2:57:33.880]  not what Patriot said but what the establishment said that now that it's
[2:57:33.880 --> 2:57:44.920]  actually here I'm sorry and it's moving so fast it's so evil and I have a
[2:57:44.920 --> 2:57:48.480]  couple questions how do we keep those of us that are awakened aware from not
[2:57:48.480 --> 2:57:54.520]  going crazy and not getting violent because that's there may be a time for
[2:57:54.520 --> 2:57:57.320]  that I'm not gonna lie to you I think you'll know what that is but we're not
[2:57:57.320 --> 2:58:01.440]  there yet but we have this earnestness to get politically involved and
[2:58:01.440 --> 2:58:04.960]  spiritually involved and financially involved and culturally involved
[2:58:04.960 --> 2:58:09.600]  because we're we're moving down the road here I mean Bill Gates is in the
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:13.480]  news again today I'll cover this in a moment saying no we're coming with
[2:58:13.480 --> 2:58:22.400]  force inoculations well you want to assault me you little pig and you don't
[2:58:22.400 --> 2:58:25.320]  think I won't hold you responsible I don't care if you say you've got
[2:58:25.320 --> 2:58:29.280]  liability out of some law out of the government I'm gonna hold you accountable
[2:58:29.280 --> 2:58:33.880]  you don't have liability protection with me by the way talking smack back to
[2:58:33.880 --> 2:58:37.360]  that demon who gets transcripts daily of what I say sent to him it's not some
[2:58:37.360 --> 2:58:41.120]  pissing contest to act tough you know while the monster isn't looking at you
[2:58:41.120 --> 2:58:48.040]  say behind its back you're ready to fight it that's Hitler 2.0 right there
[2:58:48.040 --> 2:58:57.720]  you think I want to take him on for no reason but I'm not scared of him and I
[2:58:57.720 --> 2:59:02.320]  am taking him on and all I need is a little bit of your support stay in
[2:59:02.320 --> 2:59:08.560]  attack formation you've done a great job God we've done incredible things
[2:59:08.560 --> 2:59:14.920]  together we've done amazing things and now everything that was blurry and far
[2:59:14.920 --> 2:59:19.960]  away we weren't sure were we right about it but we had a good good view on it and
[2:59:19.960 --> 2:59:25.240]  then we got real close we went oh my god right it's worse than we thought that's
[2:59:25.240 --> 2:59:39.480]  how I feel like I'm like oh my god and my very cells go war and so we see the
[2:59:39.480 --> 2:59:48.400]  idiots the fools the asleep complying with the increments of their own
[2:59:48.400 --> 2:59:52.280]  destruction we get mad at them we cannot do it and when I tell you that I'm not
[2:59:52.280 --> 3:00:00.800]  lecturing you I'm giving myself an order because it makes me so pissed when
[3:00:00.800 --> 3:00:06.840]  I'm walking down the street and somebody drives by and says put a mask on or
[3:00:06.840 --> 3:00:10.480]  somebody six their dog on me because I'm not wearing a mask and I should just
[3:00:10.480 --> 3:00:15.160]  realize that's a slave I'm not gonna submit to him but I'm not gonna give him
[3:00:15.160 --> 3:00:21.640]  that burning anger I have that's reserved for the devil but even hating the
[3:00:21.640 --> 3:00:25.520]  devil's a form of worship so let's just love God and let's do what we do for love
[3:00:25.520 --> 3:00:29.400]  and I'm talking myself through this this is not a lecture this is me like
[3:00:29.400 --> 3:00:33.680]  talking to God myself right now praying on air like what do I do and God's like
[3:00:33.680 --> 3:00:37.480]  you need to love me and love your family and love humanity you need to not get
[3:00:37.480 --> 3:00:50.400]  into hatred Jones but I'm not gonna put up with these people first store puts
[3:00:50.400 --> 3:00:56.120]  face scanners up like they're doing in Europe and Asia for you go in the store
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:01:04.160]  to face can you I'm smashing and let's pull that footage up there's footage of
[3:01:04.160 --> 3:01:12.880]  a this is in England to the UK a man starts beating a woman up because she's
[3:01:12.880 --> 3:01:17.200]  not wearing a mask on the train and then other guys gonna come in and kick his
[3:01:17.200 --> 3:01:40.560]  ass I mean see and even though she puts the mask on
[3:01:40.560 --> 3:01:57.520]  he comes over to taxi now the man starts kicking her in the face
[3:02:10.560 --> 3:02:38.200]  so little thug wants to beat up a woman he gets his ass be that's what we're
[3:02:38.200 --> 3:02:42.640]  talking about these put when I literally I'm not a victim I mean it was
[3:02:42.640 --> 3:02:47.080]  ridiculous and I was shooting my mouth off they have these rock they had the
[3:02:47.080 --> 3:02:50.720]  rock climbers up there wearing masks like 20 feet apart from each other I
[3:02:50.720 --> 3:02:58.120]  like I was like I wasn't like I said exactly wearing a mask for COVID it's
[3:02:58.120 --> 3:03:03.400]  like wearing a dart for to stop farts I'm into potty humor but it's the only
[3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:08.360]  analogy that works and I said a couple times I saw this guy look at me
[3:03:08.360 --> 3:03:12.640]  aggressive like 30 feet away with his wife with mask on I thought look at me
[3:03:12.640 --> 3:03:16.440]  aggressive and I said oh no I ignore him I turned second slater the dogs attacking
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:24.240]  me and the guy saying good job to his dog but that wasn't what was telling he
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:30.120]  was that when I grabbed the dog and started punching it in the face the guy
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:36.280]  said oh my god call the police he's attacking my dog it's perfect leftist
[3:03:36.280 --> 3:03:41.040]  fights it he comes over and attacks me and then when I fight back like the
[3:03:41.040 --> 3:03:48.400]  McCluskey's I love dogs by the way or dog was told to attack me the McCluskey's
[3:03:48.400 --> 3:03:52.040]  got indicted when people at their house going we're gonna burn your house down
[3:03:52.040 --> 3:03:57.880]  we're gonna kill you they're like oh we got guns didn't even aim them like the
[3:03:57.880 --> 3:04:00.360]  other guy with a shotgun in his house we're gonna burn your house he has a
[3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:04.440]  shotgun like this hell if you were at my house saying I'm gonna burn it down I'd
[3:04:04.440 --> 3:04:07.760]  have a shotgun aimed at your ass
[3:04:08.920 --> 3:04:12.840]  like I watch these videos of anti-food guns they'll walk up to cops and go I'm
[3:04:12.840 --> 3:04:17.080]  gonna kill you cop you got a gun you tell me you're gonna kill me I'd rather
[3:04:17.080 --> 3:04:21.760]  be tried by nine and carried by six I mean actually frightens me to watch the
[3:04:21.760 --> 3:04:26.120]  cops stand down like they do it's pathetic but notice it's all about the
[3:04:26.120 --> 3:04:30.560]  jurisdiction it's all about who's in control of jurisdiction because the cops
[3:04:30.560 --> 3:04:34.520]  are surrounded by leftist below them and their bosses are on the side of Soros
[3:04:34.520 --> 3:04:38.480]  most of the district attorneys are put in place by them so what what would you
[3:04:38.480 --> 3:04:42.320]  do what could you do well you got a resign and then they just put more
[3:04:42.320 --> 3:04:48.000]  commies in I talked to a lot of police they say Alex they said it's 75% leftist
[3:04:48.000 --> 3:04:53.800]  in Austin in Dallas in Houston and San Antonio now there's something else about
[3:04:53.800 --> 3:04:59.120]  leftist cops they sit on their ass and never put their life in risk like you
[3:04:59.120 --> 3:05:02.160]  you call a right-wing cop when you're getting raped or attacked they're coming
[3:05:02.160 --> 3:05:05.840]  into your house they're full testosterone you call a left-wing cop
[3:05:05.840 --> 3:05:09.760]  they're not showing up and the numbers show it in Chicago and New York not all
[3:05:09.760 --> 3:05:14.080]  cops are bad in those places but a lot of Marr they don't show up because for
[3:05:14.080 --> 3:05:19.200]  them it's a job with immunity and power they don't want the risk of being a
[3:05:19.200 --> 3:05:27.840]  warrior they want a gun and a badge to be above the law and it's disgraceful let

[3:11:51.960 --> 3:11:57.760]  earliest oh so over a year at the earliest he's always said that and

[3:13:05.320 --> 3:13:16.320]  bill big bill big bad bill Gates said that by the end of 20 one is that best
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:20.520]  case scenario of course his circuits say the lockdown never stops and that it
[3:13:20.520 --> 3:13:25.200]  remains unknown whether a successful vaccine could be produced but because
[3:13:25.200 --> 3:13:28.200]  there could be any death they can ever be allowed again you could ever leave
[3:13:28.200 --> 3:13:34.320]  your house sorry but he know we still we can read his voice we still don't know
[3:13:34.320 --> 3:13:38.800]  whether these vaccines will succeed to the Microsoft founder now the capacity
[3:13:38.800 --> 3:13:43.800]  will take time to ramp up and there's the allocation in the US between the US
[3:13:43.800 --> 3:13:47.880]  and other countries who will be the point of contention oh everyone will
[3:13:47.880 --> 3:13:53.640]  beg in the media oh we've got to have it oh please give it to us that's an old
[3:13:53.640 --> 3:13:57.960]  tactic that's been documented for over 30 years well for like a hundred but they
[3:13:57.960 --> 3:14:03.240]  only busted them they made movies like turbo doll with Schwarzenegger about it
[3:14:03.240 --> 3:14:06.320]  turbo dolls in the movie I think it's like jingle jingle or something but
[3:14:06.320 --> 3:14:10.760]  they'd hire a local news station usually in New York LA some big Chicago some big
[3:14:10.760 --> 3:14:16.000]  city to say we want the toilet sold out show a fight of two women
[3:14:16.000 --> 3:14:21.760]  hydrochloric acid there you go two women fighting over the toy that then causes
[3:14:21.760 --> 3:14:26.280]  the artificial scarcity idea everyone rushes out to get it

[3:17:48.560 --> 3:17:54.040]  could already see as plain as day communist Chinese working in tandem with
[3:17:54.040 --> 3:17:57.760]  the United Nations and the Democratic Party in the United States as well as
[3:17:57.760 --> 3:18:02.800]  the media put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like day of
[3:18:02.800 --> 3:18:07.360]  the dead into the world in China earlier this year then the UN put out
[3:18:07.360 --> 3:18:11.400]  standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened

[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:36.240]  the globalist is exposing how communist China the UN were behind the hysteria and
[3:18:36.240 --> 3:18:43.120]  perhaps most cruelly of all if Donald Trump has his way the complications from
[3:18:43.120 --> 3:18:51.360]  COVID-19 which are well beyond what they should be it's estimated that 200
[3:18:51.360 --> 3:18:56.880]  million people have died 200 million people have died probably by the time
[3:18:56.880 --> 3:19:01.960]  I finished this talk right after Joe Biden made that statement that more than
[3:19:01.960 --> 3:19:07.320]  60% of America has died from COVID-19 when it's not even 200,000 reality he
[3:19:07.320 --> 3:19:11.480]  would honestly six million have lung scarring and heart damage it's all made
[3:19:11.480 --> 3:19:14.240]  up but you know where you got it the mainstream media that continues to
[3:19:14.240 --> 3:19:19.840]  actually say things like that they said that 4% of America would be dead
[3:19:19.840 --> 3:19:24.840]  already of course it's point zero zero zero zero and then add a number because
[3:19:24.840 --> 3:19:29.720]  the numbers vary it's a real virus just like people being struck by lightning is
[3:19:29.720 --> 3:19:34.960]  real but to shut down society over lightning strikes is hysteria and is

[3:20:12.280 --> 3:20:16.280]  finally figured this out since he's gonna take action once re-elected against
[3:20:16.280 --> 3:20:19.080]  big tech and then he's modern the situation well we know the president's
[3:20:19.080 --> 3:20:22.360]  overwhelmed right now so we're gonna sit here and cry because he has taken action

[3:24:46.200 --> 3:24:51.200]  ask a couple of times a number of people what times do we think we're in what
[3:24:51.200 --> 3:24:57.600]  how would you call this period in time and this Alex I like to offer you my
[3:24:57.600 --> 3:25:06.320]  opinion I think we're in the entering the or in the age of inversion in time in
[3:25:06.320 --> 3:25:10.760]  history there have been some periods of inversion where you know as in Macbeth
[3:25:10.760 --> 3:25:18.080]  fair is foul and foul is fair and where people rely online to get ahead where
[3:25:18.080 --> 3:25:25.040]  capitalism is the opposite is implemented which is totalitarianism or
[3:25:25.040 --> 3:25:28.960]  communism that's very deep you're always amazing calling in for over 15 years or
[3:25:28.960 --> 3:25:33.000]  so you're saying we're in the age of inversion I agree they I'm gonna you're
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:37.280]  right I ought to start a podcast called the age of inversion everything is in
[3:25:37.280 --> 3:25:41.600]  version because they have no creativity they simply invert whatever is real
[3:25:41.600 --> 3:25:47.160]  correct what is the opposite of generosity Alex it's theft what is the
[3:25:47.160 --> 3:25:52.720]  antithesis of love to promote hate what is the antithesis of capitalism the
[3:25:52.720 --> 3:25:57.160]  effort that you brought in through enterprise to generate wealth you can
[3:25:57.160 --> 3:26:01.240]  shut things down exactly what we're seeing right now exactly and you print
[3:26:01.240 --> 3:26:06.920]  money at a thin air you you're doing away with capitalism if you print money
[3:26:06.920 --> 3:26:11.920]  who decides the welfare of the state okay and when you look at it in the
[3:26:11.920 --> 3:26:17.880]  context of you know there's a period of time where you don't understand really
[3:26:17.880 --> 3:26:23.200]  what's going on you know there's a dissonance in the system that's the age
[3:26:23.200 --> 3:26:28.520]  of inversion when you feel that way and you cannot work your way by thinking
[3:26:28.520 --> 3:26:33.200]  inside of the box you'll keep the funding Carlos because I know you're a
[3:26:33.200 --> 3:26:37.880]  really accredited smart guy international consultant described for
[3:26:37.880 --> 3:26:42.680]  listeners the next few minutes the age of inversion will put a video out the age
[3:26:42.680 --> 3:26:47.360]  of inversion is taking place in the past just before the American revolution
[3:26:47.360 --> 3:26:53.360]  and the the revolution that took place in France shortly after 1798 and and all
[3:26:53.360 --> 3:26:59.200]  the disasters that happened subsequent to that there was a loss in in the
[3:26:59.200 --> 3:27:05.000]  perspective of mankind contributing against nature because it was difficult
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:09.640]  at the time to build a society where all of the adversities were there now we
[3:27:09.640 --> 3:27:14.840]  live in ancient inversion where instead of mankind controlling technology it is
[3:27:14.840 --> 3:27:21.160]  technology that's trying to control mankind you follow brother I'm all ears
[3:27:21.160 --> 3:27:27.000]  continue yeah this is a time when we have to think outside of the box we have to
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:32.200]  stop a second and say I'm gonna approach my son and my daughter within the next
[3:27:32.200 --> 3:27:36.080]  few days before this election and I'm going to express to them how I feel
[3:27:36.080 --> 3:27:40.800]  about them what I wish from them the best of the developing their natural
[3:27:40.800 --> 3:27:45.920]  talent America and in my own country Canada there's been a period of time
[3:27:45.920 --> 3:27:51.040]  for the last over 45 years or so where the child has not been given all of the
[3:27:51.040 --> 3:27:56.120]  opportunities to develop in a full society to their full potential they're
[3:27:56.120 --> 3:28:00.120]  always told to state children and the parents never hand the baton and like
[3:28:00.120 --> 3:28:04.440]  invoke like an incantation it's not magic but it is saying you are now the
[3:28:04.440 --> 3:28:07.960]  birthright you are now given the birthright you must you must perform
[3:28:07.960 --> 3:28:14.640]  it's a spiritual transference correct you have to say to your politicians I
[3:28:14.640 --> 3:28:20.040]  want to give my child the opportunity that God given nature to develop to their
[3:28:20.040 --> 3:28:24.360]  fullest potential of all the people had talked at the conference at the at the
[3:28:24.360 --> 3:28:29.960]  GOP convention it was millennia Trump who took the time to talk about that how
[3:28:29.960 --> 3:28:33.480]  to bring the best out of children bring the best out of them because I'm a
[3:28:33.480 --> 3:28:39.120]  pursuit of happiness it well that's exactly that the pursuit of happiness
[3:28:39.120 --> 3:28:43.640]  was the the what the Treaty of Westphalia where we're for a time there
[3:28:43.640 --> 3:28:48.280]  was peace because people were able to think of the other we're able to work
[3:28:48.280 --> 3:28:52.440]  towards the benefit of the community not the community of one but the
[3:28:52.440 --> 3:28:56.320]  community of all and where you know people lying and there was this courage
[3:28:56.320 --> 3:29:01.800]  and where theft was this courage and the work sharing was encouraged and where
[3:29:01.800 --> 3:29:05.920]  people had an opportunity to realize when the communist version they go oh we
[3:29:05.920 --> 3:29:12.720]  the central group will do the sharing no it must all be a community operation
[3:29:12.720 --> 3:29:16.840]  from the individual it cannot be centralized and what happens in now
[3:29:16.840 --> 3:29:20.160]  this is why it's so important in history because we have never had the
[3:29:20.160 --> 3:29:24.800]  technological power that mankind has now and I'm gonna make a prediction which
[3:29:24.800 --> 3:29:28.360]  you're not gonna read in any book anywhere because only a guy like myself or
[3:29:28.360 --> 3:29:32.880]  other people who have been in the mind who've been studying in neuroscience who
[3:29:32.880 --> 3:29:36.760]  been in front of the exposed human brain and could tell you about these zero
[3:29:36.760 --> 3:29:40.960]  these implants and all of this baloney that they're talking about if we don't
[3:29:40.960 --> 3:29:46.720]  stop this and stop and reflect we can build computers that talk to each other
[3:29:46.720 --> 3:29:50.080]  we talked to robots that will talk to each other but the one thing that in
[3:29:50.080 --> 3:29:55.600]  evolution that is safe guarded our freedom Alex is the ability for each
[3:29:55.600 --> 3:30:01.000]  other not to read each other's mind if I were able to read your mind and know
[3:30:01.000 --> 3:30:05.200]  exactly what you're thinking before you know it because mankind has the freedom
[3:30:05.200 --> 3:30:10.080]  to think whatever we would be at each other's throat you understand and that's
[3:30:10.080 --> 3:30:15.400]  yes we need walls we need separation as independent sentient million beings and
[3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:19.680]  as we get all this false knowledge it also allows them to put in fake knowledge
[3:30:19.680 --> 3:30:23.640]  it'll make them be able to kill us Carlos set Carlos up for an hour as a gas set
[3:30:23.640 --> 3:30:26.960]  him up right now you guys are awesome come back with more calls Carlos come on
[3:30:26.960 --> 3:30:30.440]  this for an hour tomorrow we love you Carlos is so damn smart we're right back
[3:30:30.440 --> 3:30:33.040]  on all shows
[3:30:35.480 --> 3:30:40.960]  the Bible talks about there being 10 kings of the earth that sit above the
[3:30:40.960 --> 3:30:45.440]  nation states and who give their power unto the one world leader the anti-Christ
[3:30:45.440 --> 3:30:50.720]  and he has a beast system that no one can buy and or sell unless he has that
[3:30:50.720 --> 3:30:56.080]  market in the forehead or in the palm of their hand and we look back on all the
[3:30:56.080 --> 3:31:00.080]  warnings you were given and all just a common sense that you don't believe in
[3:31:00.080 --> 3:31:06.120]  God or prophecy giving governments corporations the power to control who
[3:31:06.120 --> 3:31:09.720]  can buy and who can sell to track everything we do he's not just a recipe
[3:31:09.720 --> 3:31:14.560]  it's a blueprint for total enslaved but now you look at Bill Gates you look at
[3:31:14.560 --> 3:31:19.000]  Bloomberg and others who openly say we're technocrats we should decide how
[3:31:19.000 --> 3:31:23.200]  much salt you get how much alcohol you get how much red meat you get we're
[3:31:23.200 --> 3:31:27.240]  technocrats we know best we're now gonna set up the economy with a social score
[3:31:27.240 --> 3:31:31.960]  to totally control you you snap your fingers we're here they're just rolling
[3:31:31.960 --> 3:31:36.520]  it out and a lot of people are complying with it it's insane this is your
[3:31:36.520 --> 3:31:41.320]  last chance to get a pack power stack and I'm really bummed out about that it
[3:31:41.320 --> 3:31:45.280]  started out as a sleeper product but the people that did order it loved it and
[3:31:45.280 --> 3:31:48.760]  sort of reordering it they spread the word and became one of our best sellers
[3:31:48.760 --> 3:31:53.040]  but because of the COVID supply chain breakdown because there's 13 different
[3:31:53.040 --> 3:31:58.600]  formulas in a pack power stack we are unable to secure it anymore this is the
[3:31:58.600 --> 3:32:03.560]  highest in a npm pack system you're gonna find where you take half the pills
[3:32:03.560 --> 3:32:06.600]  in the morning half the capitals and pills and shell caps at night it's
[3:32:06.600 --> 3:32:10.000]  amazing I don't have time to go into everything that's in it but this gets
[3:32:10.000 --> 3:32:13.280]  people to remember to take it and that's why it's having such a great effect
[3:32:13.280 --> 3:32:16.480]  because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing what's your last chance to get a
[3:32:16.480 --> 3:32:22.040]  power stack info or store calm it's 60% off and free shipping that is at cost for
[3:32:22.040 --> 3:32:24.960]  all you that already support info wars we're passing these savings on to you
[3:32:24.960 --> 3:32:29.880]  here a pack power stack now or you still can last chance to get it info or store
[3:32:29.880 --> 3:32:39.120]  calm a pack power stacks 60% off and free shipping for more than a hundred years the
[3:32:39.120 --> 3:32:43.240]  Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government abolish
[3:32:43.240 --> 3:32:47.640]  nation-states dumb down the population by taking control of education and most
[3:32:47.640 --> 3:32:52.440]  importantly taking control of Western medicine now they had a bad name by the
[3:32:52.440 --> 3:32:57.000]  1920s they started converting over and funding other organizations and groups
[3:32:57.000 --> 3:33:02.760]  like IBM to continue on with their eugenics operations fast forward to the
[3:33:02.760 --> 3:33:08.680]  1980s the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board directors to Bill
[3:33:08.680 --> 3:33:12.600]  Gates the third his father of course being had a Planned Parenthood and now
[3:33:12.600 --> 3:33:17.440]  he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the
[3:33:17.440 --> 3:33:23.160]  world every national health system Bill Gates is in control they have spent a
[3:33:23.160 --> 3:33:28.080]  hundred plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your
[3:33:28.080 --> 3:33:32.760]  body and what goes in your body this is the holy grail of their operations and
[3:33:32.760 --> 3:33:38.320]  now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body the future isn't
[3:33:38.320 --> 3:33:44.600]  coming it's here and in the future keeping your humanity saving your soul
[3:33:44.600 --> 3:33:49.320]  your integrity your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset in
[3:33:49.320 --> 3:33:54.600]  fact it's going to be your only asset the world being built by the technocrats
[3:33:54.600 --> 3:34:00.600]  the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the
[3:34:00.600 --> 3:34:06.800]  beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and
[3:34:06.800 --> 3:34:12.960]  complete dehumanization human life will be impossible to be carried out in an
[3:34:12.960 --> 3:34:19.800]  original biological way by the year 2050 this is their stated goal I'm sorry to
[3:34:19.800 --> 3:34:24.200]  have to report horrifying things like this to you but only by facing the horror
[3:34:24.200 --> 3:34:29.800]  and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy we turn this around you must
[3:34:29.800 --> 3:34:34.200]  study their own writings you must face the facts and you must come to grips with
[3:34:34.200 --> 3:34:38.440]  it you're all being incrementally destroyed
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:44.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:48.240 --> 3:34:54.160]  I got some goodness and I got some bad news I'll ever get to all these calls
[3:34:54.160 --> 3:34:59.000]  during this segment but I'm gonna come close the war room with Owen Troyer we're
[3:34:59.000 --> 3:35:10.040]  gonna transfer those calls right out there I got some news so huge I'm
[3:35:10.040 --> 3:35:17.640]  actually quite pleased with horrible news one levels bad with the second
[3:35:17.640 --> 3:35:45.400]  level the third level you suckers cut the baby you global has got up front
[3:35:45.400 --> 3:35:53.800]  you did it
[3:36:15.400 --> 3:36:18.600]  Yeah, baby! Straight up fight now, bitch!
[3:36:23.400 --> 3:36:26.400]  For 60 years, we've been laying the groundwork to stop your mood.
[3:36:27.200 --> 3:36:30.000]  And now we force you out to open you dumb bastards.
[3:36:30.300 --> 3:36:33.400]  They think they just released the cavalry in a battle they're losing?
[3:36:35.800 --> 3:36:38.200]  They just destroyed themselves!
[3:36:39.400 --> 3:36:41.000]  This is so good!
[3:36:41.000 --> 3:36:45.000]  Oh, my God! Yes, thank you, Jesus!
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:49.000]  Yeah!
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:53.000]  Oh, man.
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  Yours and yours alone.
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:37:01.000]  I'm here to tell you, honey, that I'm bad to the bone.
[3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  Bad to the bone.
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  B-b-bad.
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:08.000]  B-b-bad.
[3:37:08.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  B-b-bad to the bone.
[3:37:10.000 --> 3:37:11.000]  B-b-bad to the bone.
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  Woo! All right, let's just, I'm going to stop now.
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:16.000]  Because I'm going to cover War Room. I'm going there with Owen.
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:18.000]  I'm coming there in the transmission. We'll do a great job.
[3:37:18.000 --> 3:37:19.000]  But let me tell you.
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:25.000]  The New York Times calling for the UN to take over with troops and to run our elections.
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:31.000]  I mean, we've been working so hard to get these pieces of crap to unclog.
[3:37:31.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  And they're doing it, baby.
[3:37:32.000 --> 3:37:37.000]  I mean, I started the show out with how the chit-coms are pissed and how America sucks
[3:37:37.000 --> 3:37:39.000]  and how we're all racist and all this stuff.
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  And then they just came out and called for the end of the United States with UN troops.
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  Wow! Thank you very much, you dumb sons of bitches.
[3:37:53.000 --> 3:37:54.000]  God almighty.
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  That's as good as getting Churchill to manipulate the Germans into bombing London.
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  I mean, oh my God.
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  I just, I'm sorry. I'm going to stop right now.
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:05.000]  I apologize to the listeners.
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  I just do not like to do world order.
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  And I was looking at this and the stuff they're saying about how we need UN troops
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:14.000]  and the UN to run everything and the UN to run our police.
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:17.000]  I mean, you know how hard we've worked to expose these bastards?
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  I'm sorry.
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:24.000]  Maybe I'm, maybe I'm, maybe I'm miscalculating here.
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:33.000]  But in my, my, my playbook, having the UN ultimately say they're going to run our election is not good for Joe Biden.
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:37.000]  And it shows how illegitimate their attempt to hold the election up is going to be.
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  And how I predicted they'll try to, I said a month ago they'll have the UN troops in here running this damn election
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:45.000]  with the secession claiming the seceded states are legitimate.
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:51.000]  I saw that in my little walnut brain and sure as hell it's happening.
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:54.000]  I want to be yours pretty baby.
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:56.000]  Yours and yours alone.
[3:38:56.000 --> 3:38:59.000]  And I'm here to tell you honey that I'm bad to the bone.
[3:38:59.000 --> 3:39:02.000]  How about our republic man?
[3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  Look, most people will see this and go, you know, well, what does that mean?
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:11.000]  This is desperate behavior.
[3:39:11.000 --> 3:39:12.000]  This is desperate.
[3:39:12.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  Shit.
[3:39:13.000 --> 3:39:14.000]  Your bridge is behavior.
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:19.000]  I'm sorry.
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:20.000]  I'm sorry.
[3:39:20.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  Okay.
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:22.000]  Let's go.
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:23.000]  Who's been home the longest here?
[3:39:23.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  We got Taylor.
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:25.000]  We got Matthew.
[3:39:25.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  We got Emily.
[3:39:26.000 --> 3:39:27.000]  We got Joey.
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  We got Michael.
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:29.000]  We got Greg.
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  We got Noah.
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:32.000]  Who's been home the longest here?
[3:39:32.000 --> 3:39:33.000]  Emily in Florida.
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  Sorry.
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  I'm having a type of information gasm here on air, but welcome.
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  Hi Alex.
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:41.000]  How are you today?
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  I'm doing pretty good right now.
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:45.000]  I'm a first time caller.
[3:39:45.000 --> 3:39:48.000]  I know that's that's incredibly disgusting news.
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  But yeah.
[3:39:49.000 --> 3:39:51.000]  We forced these people out the oven.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:54.000]  We made them run their flag up.
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:56.000]  Look, I know it's bad, but it's already been going on.
[3:39:56.000 --> 3:39:59.000]  They're having to run, they're flying their flags now.
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:01.000]  What does that mean to you?
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  What it means to me.
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:04.000]  Well, I did.
[3:40:04.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  One of the reasons why I wanted to call is because I feel like there's very little
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  female representation on the house.
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:12.000]  We love hearing from you.
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  You're badass.
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:16.000]  Nails that will call in and give their opinion on things.
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:22.000]  And being a mother of children, it's really activated my motherly instincts.
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  I hear you.
[3:40:23.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  I'm going to protect my children at all costs.
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:31.000]  And so really what they're doing is, I mean, it's amazing that they that
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:33.000]  they're putting their hand out there.
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:38.000]  But what I wanted to talk to you about today was section 230.
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  And I've worked for a company and I won't, I won't go into the details here,
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  but I've worked for a company where they developed different software for
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:53.000]  AI to be able to control social media and certain things.
[3:40:53.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  And they actually are paid by companies to use the data in order to sell
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:03.000]  people more items.
[3:41:03.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  So I wanted to talk about the fact that we all think,
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  when is AI going to take over?
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  When is this going to happen?
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:13.000]  And I wanted to, it's happening currently.
[3:41:13.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  It is happening currently.
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:20.000]  It's not necessarily Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos or, you know,
[3:41:20.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  Twitter or any of these companies.
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:25.000]  It's our actions, but it wasn't happening fully.
[3:41:25.000 --> 3:41:28.000]  So they had a COVID lockdown to further kill Main Street.
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  People should not, people should get out of their rhythms.
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:33.000]  They should buy different places.
[3:41:33.000 --> 3:41:35.000]  They shouldn't, they certainly shouldn't support the big guys.
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:37.000]  Keep going.
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:41.000]  Well, I think it's really important right now to realize the control of
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  these companies and what they're doing.
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  And the thing is, it's not even the people in control anymore.
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:50.000]  People have lost control of the technology.
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:54.000]  They don't even really understand what the technology is even doing
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  any longer.
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:57.000]  It's really taken over.
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:41:58.000]  Exactly.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  It just slurps up more info.
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:03.000]  It's its own consciousness, isn't it?
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  Yes.
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  I mean, all of the algorithms and everything were created to generate
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  revenue.
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  They weren't created in a way that was supposed to protect humanity.
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  And so it's evident today in being probably one step away from a
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  civil war, that when this AI pushes you down a certain rabbit hole,
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  it says, okay, Emily is a big supporter of Trump.
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  So we're only going to show her information that has to do with
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  Trump to get her engaged and get her to stay online.
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:36.000]  And that way you create revenue that way with ads and whatever you
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:37.000]  purchase.
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  So I think that it's really become out of the hands of anyone who
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:45.000]  understands what's happening here.
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:47.000]  And you can repeal Section 230.
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:50.000]  You can hit them where it really hurts, which is financially.
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:52.000]  And I think that's wonderful.
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:55.000]  But what really needs to happen is the destruction of these systems,
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:42:58.000]  these computers that are how...
[3:42:58.000 --> 3:42:59.000]  I totally agree.
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:02.000]  And Congress, who's on average like 80 years old,
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:04.000]  he's know how far behind the curve they are.
[3:43:04.000 --> 3:43:07.000]  Now Big Tech does not respect them.
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:09.000]  And this is absolutely beyond monopolies.
[3:43:09.000 --> 3:43:13.000]  This is destroying the fabric of society and a mathematical takeover
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:15.000]  that is totally destructive.
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:18.000]  And I am in Laura Loomer's district.
[3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:21.000]  I wanted to just put her name out there because I absolutely love her.
[3:43:21.000 --> 3:43:22.000]  She's on tomorrow.
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:23.000]  We love her too.
[3:43:23.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  She's a female supporter of you.
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:25.000]  She's on tomorrow.
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:28.000]  And I wanted to say that in my own home,
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:30.000]  and I think that's where a lot of this starts.
[3:43:30.000 --> 3:43:35.000]  I think people are kind of clueless as to how they can change things
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:40.000]  and how they can be a part of the solution here.
[3:43:40.000 --> 3:43:43.000]  And in my home, I've taken away everything.
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:46.000]  I've taken away the video games, the killing video games.
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:48.000]  I've taken away the access to social media.
[3:43:48.000 --> 3:43:51.000]  I've taken away all of the Hollyweird, all of the...
[3:43:51.000 --> 3:43:54.000]  And let me guess, your children are more happy.
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:57.000]  Oh my God, you don't even understand.
[3:43:57.000 --> 3:44:00.000]  My son and I are now on the same wavelength.
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:03.000]  And he is just so much happier.
[3:44:03.000 --> 3:44:05.000]  Our home is so much happier.
[3:44:05.000 --> 3:44:08.000]  And it's amazing the difference that it creates.
[3:44:08.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  And these things spread.
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:13.000]  And I think people feel like, oh, I'm just one person.
[3:44:13.000 --> 3:44:16.000]  Well, you're one person raising maybe four other people
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:19.000]  who are in turn going to do that as well.
[3:44:19.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  And I think we really need to reign in AI.
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:26.000]  I think that we're looking too much at these owners of these companies
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:30.000]  and such and pointing fingers when it is the actual algorithms
[3:44:30.000 --> 3:44:32.000]  and communities that are doing this.
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:33.000]  It is us clicking you on it.
[3:44:33.000 --> 3:44:34.000]  It's us following it that gives us power.
[3:44:34.000 --> 3:44:36.000]  And by the way, we love it when wonderful women like you,
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:38.000]  men, too, call in.
[3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  We're going to take the last four minutes of you, Emily,
[3:44:40.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  and put it out as an informational news piece
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:44.000]  because you're so on target.
[3:44:44.000 --> 3:44:46.000]  We really appreciate you, Emily.
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:49.000]  And we pray and hope you'll tell folks about Band-Aid Video
[3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:51.000]  and infowars.com in 30 seconds.
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:53.000]  How did you find out about the show?
[3:44:53.000 --> 3:44:57.000]  I've been watching the show for, see, since I was 18 years old.
[3:44:57.000 --> 3:44:59.000]  I'm 38 now.
[3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:01.000]  So I've been watching you for the longest.
[3:45:01.000 --> 3:45:05.000]  And I've had people call me absolutely nuts and, you know,
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:08.000]  but I've been watching you forever.
[3:45:08.000 --> 3:45:09.000]  So this is my first time calling.
[3:45:09.000 --> 3:45:13.000]  I really just felt like I needed to put out kind of like a motherly voice.
[3:45:13.000 --> 3:45:19.000]  And I wanted to ask you, too, why are you not creating a social fat form?
[3:45:19.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  Everybody's being banned.
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:23.000]  You know, we tried. We tried. We tried.
[3:45:23.000 --> 3:45:52.000]  We just redesigned M4s. We're going to do it.
[3:45:53.000 --> 3:45:56.000]  And I've decided to run these plans against us.
[3:45:56.000 --> 3:45:59.000]  They are enemies of humanity and must be dealt with.
[3:45:59.000 --> 3:46:24.000]  It's up to us or them, period.
