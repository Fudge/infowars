[02:28.840 --> 02:35.360]  Reserve status greenback sinks following news of Lehman Brothers Bankruptcy
[02:35.360 --> 02:39.600]  with the green bank plummeting after the news of Lehman Brothers bankruptcy
[02:39.600 --> 02:42.800]  top investor Jim Rogers predicts the dollar will lose its status as the
[02:42.800 --> 02:46.440]  World Reserve currency and has resolved to buy more gold despite a recent fall
[02:46.440 --> 02:50.440]  in the price you see before the private bankers fully bankrupted the country and
[02:50.440 --> 02:54.280]  then put the bill on us protecting themselves and literally taking over
[02:54.280 --> 02:59.000]  almost all the real assets in the world in the process before they did that and
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.720]  this is just the beginning they had to first drive down some of the commodities
[03:03.720 --> 03:09.480]  and drive down gold so that they could buy up more of it for themselves during
[03:09.480 --> 03:13.360]  the interim and that's what's been happening I mean inflation massively
[03:13.360 --> 03:19.840]  increasing double digits above 15% annually now compounding just jobs
[03:19.840 --> 03:25.400]  factories in the manufacturing which is now even putting together a hamburgers
[03:25.400 --> 03:29.960]  called manufacturing and plotting service imploding just restaurants closing
[03:29.960 --> 03:34.400]  down all over the place homes for sale everywhere even in quote better off
[03:34.400 --> 03:38.280]  cities like Austin Texas or San Francisco but don't worry there's more
[03:38.280 --> 03:43.880]  police cars more prisons more riot vehicles more riot gear more cameras
[03:43.880 --> 03:49.480]  more helicopters always money for that just pouring out just gushing out the
[03:49.480 --> 03:53.680]  lifeblood of America and the free country just pouring out right into the
[03:53.680 --> 04:00.600]  vampires greedy hungry languishing wide-open maws as the Paul of the new
[04:00.600 --> 04:08.360]  world order spreads across the world as the greedy mindless yuppies giggle and
[04:08.360 --> 04:13.120]  smirking laugh and make jokes about everything as they careen over the
[04:13.120 --> 04:19.280]  cliff a little bit dark here today because things are dark and only by
[04:19.280 --> 04:26.120]  facing just how dark they are can we turn all of this around Wilbur Ross
[04:26.120 --> 04:31.240]  possibly a thousand banks will close another headline here this is from the
[04:31.240 --> 04:36.920]  financial services in an exclusive interview at CNBC Wilbur Ross chairman
[04:36.920 --> 04:41.200]  and CEO of WL Ross and goes to CC's possibility to visit a thousand bank
[04:41.200 --> 04:46.840]  closures in coming months and this will create opportunities for investors
[04:46.840 --> 04:54.400]  snapping up snapping up all the slave goods they'll be right back wide open
[04:54.400 --> 05:01.480]  phones today on the economy almost happening to you politically he's the
[05:01.480 --> 05:24.680]  T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network you know what's
[05:24.680 --> 05:30.080]  going on on top radio and in the front pages of newspapers all over the nation
[05:30.080 --> 05:35.960]  what's being discussed on the Sunday news shows and on the 24-hour news cable
[05:35.960 --> 05:48.280]  networks Sarah Palin and her daughter's boyfriend Levi and it's playing the men
[05:48.280 --> 05:54.520]  off against the women and black off against white all this Balkanization
[05:54.520 --> 06:02.560]  two different candidates that they've given us Barack Obama and of course
[06:02.560 --> 06:10.760]  Sarah Palin both of them Taylor made for the soap opera mentality and then you've
[06:10.760 --> 06:20.400]  got the Teddy Roosevelt war hero type John McCain doesn't matter if he's for
[06:20.400 --> 06:25.760]  total amnesty for illegal aliens open borders gun control war mongering
[06:25.760 --> 06:30.600]  hundred-year wars domestic police states he says he wants to use the US
[06:30.600 --> 06:35.040]  military on the streets to quote fight crime they don't even deny now that
[06:35.040 --> 06:41.440]  they're going to use the military against the American people and ignorant
[06:41.440 --> 06:48.440]  folks say well what's wrong with using the military to fight crime and I was
[06:48.440 --> 06:54.080]  watching the deputy head of Health and Human Services yesterday grandstanding
[06:54.080 --> 07:00.400]  as our saviors on C-Span during the hurricane and the aftermath and it was
[07:00.400 --> 07:05.960]  a rear-admiral and then later I saw the head of another separate federal
[07:05.960 --> 07:09.920]  agency who was a general and then I started thinking about it I mean I mean
[07:09.920 --> 07:15.720]  I know North comes in control I know we are a military district just as China
[07:15.720 --> 07:19.160]  was a military district divided up by Europe and the United States a hundred
[07:19.160 --> 07:24.960]  and twenty years ago study what they didn't shine and that's what the
[07:24.960 --> 07:28.280]  globalists are doing here and another third-world nations and we are now
[07:28.280 --> 07:34.520]  designated as a third-world nation by the New World Order we are designated by
[07:34.520 --> 07:39.240]  the IMF the World Bank and the Club of Rome and others in hundreds of
[07:39.240 --> 07:42.520]  declassified documents we've had guests on and we've covered here to be
[07:42.520 --> 07:46.600]  subdivided to be stripped-mind to be pushed all the way to the wall we are
[07:46.600 --> 07:53.320]  known as the world's suckers and I keep making that point because do you like
[07:53.320 --> 07:59.720]  being suckers I mean do you like being used and abused do you enjoy being
[07:59.720 --> 08:03.640]  fooled these people with the support our trip stickers all over their cars
[08:03.640 --> 08:08.040]  driving around with NRA stickers feeling good about themselves strutting
[08:08.040 --> 08:17.640]  around going that Obama he's a Marxist come in we're gonna deal with him no he
[08:17.640 --> 08:23.840]  is a foundation controlled candidate who is meant to direct the lower classes
[08:23.840 --> 08:31.720]  into a Marxist Leninist system to dispossess and rob the middle class and
[08:31.720 --> 08:39.240]  transfer it to the banking elite and John McCain is going to do the exact same
[08:39.240 --> 08:45.600]  thing just with different nomenclature different window dressing
[08:50.400 --> 08:58.840]  all I'm trying to do desperately is to get the population to look behind the
[08:58.840 --> 09:05.880]  curtain nine years ago and right up into the last two weeks we have had guest
[09:05.880 --> 09:14.520]  after guest after guest respected economic analyst top economist former
[09:14.520 --> 09:20.880]  treasury heads to tell you that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were going to go
[09:20.880 --> 09:28.240]  bankrupt to tell you it was a fraud it was a Ponzi scheme a black hole and the
[09:28.240 --> 09:34.600]  real scam is now happening you're seeing more theft in the months that have
[09:34.600 --> 09:40.000]  passed and the months and years to come then you ever saw in all the history of
[09:40.000 --> 09:49.880]  financial speculation and chicanery and skullduggery you see quote bailing out
[09:49.880 --> 09:55.280]  the home loans that's only the tip of the iceberg that's just a few hundred
[09:55.280 --> 10:00.240]  billion dollars but see it cascades into the fact that those hundreds of
[10:00.240 --> 10:05.480]  billions were then sold as securities as solid gold securities a triple A rated
[10:05.480 --> 10:10.720]  and they were sold out on the world market and then those securities were
[10:10.720 --> 10:15.160]  held and then leveraged out and loaned out 10 to 1 and then they would loan
[10:15.160 --> 10:23.680]  those out 10 to 1 have you done the math when you leverage 200 billion times 10
[10:23.680 --> 10:30.480]  and then you leverage that out times 10 you are into hundreds of trillions of
[10:30.480 --> 10:35.760]  dollars in fact I can't talk on the radio and type into a calculator John
[10:35.760 --> 10:40.040]  Harmon do you have your computer calculator there I could do it about a
[10:40.040 --> 10:43.920]  handheld when I could talk while I entered it what is and we're being
[10:43.920 --> 10:47.440]  conservative or this is just one area and we're giving a low ballpark in the
[10:47.440 --> 10:54.320]  US 200 billion dollars of bad mortgages where from the brokerage houses and the
[10:54.320 --> 11:02.360]  big banks right down to the local brokers the real estate agents the
[11:02.360 --> 11:09.600]  appraisers and the citizens lying the individual see it's a corruption top
[11:09.600 --> 11:16.400]  down straight through and it's only one shiny facet of securities fraud one
[11:16.400 --> 11:23.920]  shiny area you think the scams are big and 200 billion how about four plus
[11:23.920 --> 11:30.240]  trillion missing from the Pentagon in the last decade you think that's a big
[11:30.240 --> 11:37.280]  scam how about trillions for states like Texas and New York in the
[11:37.280 --> 11:41.800]  comprehensive annual financial reports the second set of books you see it'd be
[11:41.800 --> 11:47.680]  like if I made $80,000 a year hypothetically but I told my wife and
[11:47.680 --> 11:50.880]  showed her books on a computer and quick books and said honey here's our
[11:50.880 --> 11:56.760]  budget our budgets only $40,000 and I would never have lied to her I just
[11:56.760 --> 12:00.520]  never told her about the other set of books that had everything on it see
[12:00.520 --> 12:07.680]  what you budget is what you say you have it's a semantical lawyer trick and so
[12:07.680 --> 12:11.880]  your cities and your counties on average have been spending about 20% of the
[12:11.880 --> 12:20.000]  revenue they take in on average we've had the former we've had the former head
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.080]  comptroller the Air Force on who discovered Walter Berion's research
[12:24.080 --> 12:30.200]  more than a decade ago and he's got his own website what kafferman and he goes
[12:30.200 --> 12:33.720]  over the fact that that that now this is before they bankrupted it all so we
[12:33.720 --> 12:39.160]  couldn't get it and so they got real assets they leveraged it to infinity
[12:39.160 --> 12:46.400]  that every American would get around a $50,000 dividend or bonus from
[12:46.400 --> 12:50.720]  government investments every year and they could expand government growth at
[12:50.720 --> 12:55.920]  about 3% a year and in regular size and around 5% this was a few years ago
[12:55.920 --> 13:03.520]  before they did all this and around 5% for inflation just like in a
[13:03.520 --> 13:08.240]  Alaska they get paid around $4,000 dividends a year and don't really pay
[13:08.240 --> 13:14.960]  any state tax that's how I mean that's how much wealth there is see the
[13:14.960 --> 13:19.000]  globalist want to artificially restrict wealth artificially control it they are
[13:19.000 --> 13:29.120]  monopoly institutions monopoly men they work in combines cartels and so you
[13:29.120 --> 13:34.760]  think 200 million from housing loans that was a literal drop in the bucket
[13:34.760 --> 13:40.720]  compared to any of the scams but trillions at the state level city of
[13:40.720 --> 13:45.120]  Austin last time I checked had over five billion dollars in CAF for
[13:45.120 --> 13:48.760]  investments comprehensive annual financial report investments separate
[13:48.760 --> 13:55.520]  off-budget not for pensions not for anything and you see the mayors that'll
[13:55.520 --> 13:59.760]  do a 200 million 400 million dollar bond package and then they never spend the
[13:59.760 --> 14:04.760]  money on the bond it goes to investments and you'll find out oh that mayor got
[14:04.760 --> 14:09.760]  hired as a consultant by the company's brokerage firms they invested that with
[14:09.760 --> 14:15.440]  and it was getting 20 30 40 50 grand a year but the mayor will have dozens and
[14:15.440 --> 14:19.880]  dozens in some cases every mayor every one of the major mayors in my town of
[14:19.880 --> 14:26.120]  consultancies with those companies and he'll go to one meeting a year two
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.520]  meetings a year and be paid to fly there to their 1020 grand and and just sit
[14:30.520 --> 14:36.120]  there and give a speech or talk or be in attendance and oh that's your payment
[14:36.120 --> 14:46.360]  now so you think they're gonna stop any of this this is a legalized crime and
[14:46.360 --> 14:50.120]  the shysters all along as they done in third world countries and as they done
[14:50.120 --> 14:55.760]  in first world countries this is economic warfare they said well why should
[14:55.760 --> 14:58.720]  we just sit here and give ourselves our own private cash machines and our own
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.840]  private equity lines to buy up real assets why not build up a police state
[15:03.840 --> 15:08.160]  grid put the military and control the United States stage a terror attack to
[15:08.160 --> 15:12.240]  sell the public on accepting the end of the bill of rights and then fully take
[15:12.240 --> 15:19.680]  everything and then when they try to squirm it'll be too late and that in a
[15:19.680 --> 15:26.200]  nutshell is what has been done but to fully bankrupt you into fully make you
[15:26.200 --> 15:30.480]  chattel serves now it's all frauds you really don't know these debts right here
[15:30.480 --> 15:36.080]  at the end it is in hundreds of billions a year they're stealing it's
[15:36.080 --> 15:40.920]  trillions it's everything and as they as the quote private
[15:40.920 --> 15:49.680]  Federal Reserve bails out the other quote banks they're bailing themselves out
[15:49.680 --> 15:58.680]  it's not bailing themselves out it's banking consolidations it's the less
[15:58.680 --> 16:04.080]  than 14 private shareholding families of the Federal Reserve that dad is very
[16:04.080 --> 16:07.000]  closely held there's been a few congressional hearings more than 70
[16:07.000 --> 16:09.640]  years ago about it and the families were public at the time
[16:09.640 --> 16:16.760]  Rockefellers Asters Rothmans Oppenheimer same names Saxe Coburg gothers Bank of
[16:16.760 --> 16:25.320]  England they issued unlimited credit to themselves that you and I back up and
[16:25.320 --> 16:29.640]  pay for this is like someone opening a credit card and putting millions of
[16:29.640 --> 16:35.120]  dollars on it you know last time a few years ago last time I checked it was the
[16:35.120 --> 16:41.160]  average American owes about $88,000 in the national debt do the math now as it
[16:41.160 --> 16:50.360]  goes from trillions to thousands of trillions in real debt we all owe tens
[16:50.360 --> 16:54.520]  of millions do the math to them and they're gonna take it at the point of a
[16:54.520 --> 16:59.360]  gun you're not meant to ever pay it off you are a chattel slave unless you say
[16:59.360 --> 17:07.640]  no
[17:10.640 --> 17:18.880]  gigantic banks were absorbed by the Federal Reserve and we get to fit the
[17:18.880 --> 17:28.400]  bill we also get to pay for the police-state apparatus that will squeeze
[17:28.400 --> 17:37.280]  it all out of this we get to watch illegal aliens above the law while it
[17:37.280 --> 17:59.640]  all happens
[17:59.640 --> 18:11.640]  nobody was really sure he was welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[18:11.640 --> 18:23.720]  English army had just won the war crowd of people turned away
[18:23.720 --> 18:43.280]  but I just have to look I'm glad that you have joined us today I'm actually
[18:43.280 --> 18:48.360]  tortured by what's happening and I somehow hope that if we laugh at the
[18:48.360 --> 18:52.080]  yuppies and others they'll somehow find out there is a new world order there is a
[18:52.080 --> 18:56.040]  private banking elite they do have IMF and World Bank documents where they
[18:56.040 --> 19:00.360]  plan to make us complete slaves and bankrupt this nation and just maybe we
[19:00.360 --> 19:03.840]  can turn this around and maybe the police and military won't mindlessly
[19:03.840 --> 19:08.280]  serve this evil I mean folks when they're heading up a whole bunch of main
[19:08.280 --> 19:12.680]  line federal agencies with military officers like they are we're in a lot
[19:12.680 --> 19:16.800]  of trouble when they've got foreign intelligence heads running Homeland
[19:16.800 --> 19:22.040]  Security like Cherdorf I mean it's just we are such a dominated captured company
[19:22.040 --> 19:30.640]  a nation and this country is a company proper Freudian slip there and we are
[19:30.640 --> 19:36.000]  being used like a holding company that's there to liquidate the assets of this
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.400]  nation and the globalists are just bank robbing us they got control of the
[19:39.400 --> 19:43.040]  government they're only in danger is that we might seize control of it back
[19:43.040 --> 19:49.040]  and prosecute them and so they are securing it through arms and it is
[19:49.040 --> 19:55.760]  classic tyranny classic jack booted thievery that's coming on and meanwhile
[19:55.760 --> 19:59.000]  they've got the you know the liberals giggling and laughing on power trips
[19:59.000 --> 20:03.920]  going our times come we got a black man and they've got mindless conservatives
[20:03.920 --> 20:08.520]  running around scared going we got a vulgar McCain or a dirty coming coming
[20:08.520 --> 20:13.440]  marxist black gal get us and Sarah Palin's good oh she says it's of the
[20:13.440 --> 20:17.960]  Lord to me and I reckon that we need to attack Russia she said we need to have a
[20:17.960 --> 20:23.040]  war with Russia completely out of her mind complete puppet runs nothing oh
[20:23.040 --> 20:29.760]  look she's a good-looking woman that'll give us some change
[20:29.760 --> 20:34.320]  meanwhile most people are hearing the mainstream media go everything's fine
[20:34.320 --> 20:39.320]  everything's so what major banks are imploding and being taken over and hundreds
[20:39.320 --> 20:44.320]  of billions of dollars now every day or two are being guaranteed on the backs of
[20:44.320 --> 20:47.880]  the American people through the Treasury for the private Federal Reserve and
[20:47.880 --> 20:51.600]  never mind and they're just going to issue more liquidity more liquidity
[20:51.600 --> 20:55.640]  devalue the dollar while at the same time cutting off liquidity for the average
[20:55.640 --> 20:59.320]  person the average institution the average person the average corporation
[20:59.320 --> 21:04.440]  where they're not getting any credit that's being turned off the the the the credit is
[21:04.440 --> 21:09.800]  all going right into the big baby goblin that is the new world order and it's
[21:09.800 --> 21:16.360]  growing quite large and vicious and my you know getting big for its britches when
[21:16.360 --> 21:20.320]  we watch this unfold I mean we tell you almost a decade ago they were going to
[21:20.320 --> 21:25.480]  implode fanny may and Freddie Mac and it happens and we tell you years ago what
[21:25.480 --> 21:29.720]  they were going to do to commodities and it happens and we break down how they
[21:29.720 --> 21:33.960]  were building this bubble and they told you no it's not true it's conspiracy
[21:33.960 --> 21:37.640]  theorists know it's not true and now they're saying okay there's some shuffling
[21:37.640 --> 21:42.040]  going on but the economy is actually strengthening and everything's fine and
[21:42.040 --> 21:49.320]  support the bailout but it's not a bailout of people who have outstanding
[21:49.320 --> 21:54.560]  mortgages it's not a bailout of people that are upside down in their homes and
[21:54.560 --> 21:59.360]  and the media spins that and says well people who bought say a six hundred
[21:59.360 --> 22:02.960]  thousand dollar house and if you're living in Michigan or Iowa you're
[22:02.960 --> 22:09.160]  thinking man that must be a palace no in most areas of Los Angeles or San
[22:09.160 --> 22:14.440]  Francisco or New York the six hundred thousand dollar house is a fifty thousand
[22:14.440 --> 22:19.920]  dollar house in a rural area I mean you can get a four bedroom house for twenty
[22:19.920 --> 22:24.680]  five thirty thousand forty thousand dollars in areas east Texas the same
[22:24.680 --> 22:29.560]  house in New York would be a million bucks two million dollars so somebody
[22:29.560 --> 22:32.400]  buys a six hundred thousand dollar house and now it's worth three hundred
[22:32.400 --> 22:38.160]  thousand and then the media says oh they're leaving they're leaving because
[22:38.160 --> 22:41.160]  they're upside down no they're leaving because they don't have money to pay for
[22:41.160 --> 22:44.320]  it they were living on interest in double mortgages your calls are straight
[22:44.320 --> 22:58.200]  ahead at one eight hundred two five nine nine two three one stay with us get up
[22:58.200 --> 23:07.120]  get up stand up stand up for your right one eight hundred two five nine ninety
[23:07.120 --> 23:25.560]  two thirty one Mike Roberto Dana Frank Steve and others are coming up I've
[23:25.560 --> 23:29.480]  got a giant factor financial news first I'm gonna take calls and hopefully you
[23:29.480 --> 23:34.720]  want to talk about this because we have a discussion about how do we blame who
[23:34.720 --> 23:41.240]  is at fault for this because for the last decade really and the last nine
[23:41.240 --> 23:46.560]  years or since 1999 intensely we've been discussing this bubble the fact that
[23:46.560 --> 23:50.280]  they didn't just allow the private banks a select few to engage in their
[23:50.280 --> 23:54.120]  fractional reserve banking but that they widened that that they allowed all
[23:54.120 --> 23:58.400]  sorts of other fake securities to be created and allowed those to be sold in
[23:58.400 --> 24:03.960]  the open market that the advertising was massively intensified falsely with all
[24:03.960 --> 24:07.800]  these talking heads telling everyone how wonderful it was to invest in all this
[24:07.800 --> 24:16.520]  crap the stock market is you know supposedly dropping 300 points today
[24:16.520 --> 24:20.360]  but keeping some of its value over the years but if you look at inflation it's
[24:20.360 --> 24:26.200]  lost more than half of its value I mean these are basic economic facts and the
[24:26.200 --> 24:32.120]  public is not aware of them by design so now will the public as America goes into
[24:32.120 --> 24:36.200]  emergency restructuring and restructuring means expansion of raping
[24:36.200 --> 24:40.440]  expansion of taxation regulation government control the only jobs you're
[24:40.440 --> 24:43.680]  gonna be able to get are running prisons or servicing prisons are being in
[24:43.680 --> 24:47.180]  prisons or running the red light cameras the face scanning cameras the
[24:47.180 --> 24:51.440]  biometrics the databases they mean the military industrial complex is becoming
[24:51.440 --> 24:57.600]  the economy and if you think the government kidnapping a million 400
[24:57.600 --> 25:00.520]  thousand kids a year and you think all this corruption is bad you ain't seen
[25:00.520 --> 25:05.880]  nothing yet as they say so how do we discredit these monsters that have
[25:05.880 --> 25:10.720]  organized this and implemented this by design how do we pin the tail on the
[25:10.720 --> 25:15.640]  donkey or do we let them just pass it on to a new old bush has gone he did it
[25:15.640 --> 25:20.920]  Barack Obama or John McCain oh well now that the new president's dealing with
[25:20.920 --> 25:27.240]  the crisis caused by banks and others in the past but even the banks didn't
[25:27.240 --> 25:33.160]  really mean it I mean they did your but but that's how they phrase it if we
[25:33.160 --> 25:37.680]  don't expose these people at the grassroots and show who they are and
[25:37.680 --> 25:40.880]  what they are and what they've done they are going to bring us into the next
[25:40.880 --> 25:44.640]  phase they always give you a crisis then things get worse and they go oh we
[25:44.640 --> 25:51.120]  have another solution but with a new face to Sarah Palin or John McCain a
[25:51.120 --> 25:54.960]  Biden and that is a new face for the American people most of them don't know
[25:54.960 --> 25:58.400]  who senator biden is people that read a newspaper once we think they're
[25:58.400 --> 26:06.120]  intellectuals they'll say this is high information and magical information I
[26:06.120 --> 26:13.960]  know how to read the newspaper I have an IQ of close to the cookie monster
[26:15.480 --> 26:19.760]  oh it doesn't matter it's just your lunacy I sit here watching the ship
[26:19.760 --> 26:23.280]  steaming towards an iceberg at full speed I'm warning everybody hey the
[26:23.280 --> 26:26.840]  captain's crazy he's out of control and they're saying there's no ship there's
[26:26.840 --> 26:32.400]  no iceberg there's no captain a public train to live in denial a public train
[26:32.400 --> 26:39.040]  to go along with anything that's devastating that's dangerous people
[26:39.040 --> 26:42.560]  should be climbing the walls right now they should be at their city councils
[26:42.560 --> 26:45.840]  demanding to know about the double set of books in the comprehensive annual
[26:45.840 --> 26:49.840]  financial reports but you can Google the name of your city county school
[26:49.840 --> 26:53.520]  district and find out about it in five minutes it's not even secret it's hidden
[26:53.520 --> 27:02.440]  in plain view it's just not on budget you should find out the fraud is well I
[27:02.440 --> 27:06.240]  mean imagine giving private banks a national security power to take the
[27:06.240 --> 27:10.000]  entire government over in 1947 and allowing them to have unlimited secret
[27:10.000 --> 27:14.920]  congressional funding and and the power to assassinate kill ship drugs in do
[27:14.920 --> 27:23.880]  whatever they want what's gonna happen in 60 years 61 years since the national
[27:23.880 --> 27:29.160]  security act what is gonna happen in there if the country wasn't already run
[27:29.160 --> 27:35.120]  by robber barons and corrupt before that I mean let me ask you if you just gave
[27:35.120 --> 27:39.520]  say your employers your manager let's see you own a little auto parts store you
[27:39.520 --> 27:44.840]  said I'm gonna leave for 60 years I'm gonna leave for 61 years and in 61
[27:44.840 --> 27:48.400]  years I'm gonna come back here is the family fortune here's the family land
[27:48.400 --> 27:58.120]  here's the auto parts store here's my children's college fund I'll see you in
[27:58.120 --> 28:02.360]  60-something years you'd show up you'd walk in and they'd act like you were a
[28:02.360 --> 28:08.320]  trespasser or or let's say you were the mayor of a town
[28:08.320 --> 28:13.080]  a better analogy is let's say you're an olden king back in the Middle Ages of a
[28:13.080 --> 28:20.720]  little kingdom let's say in brovario and you're a young prince and you say to
[28:20.720 --> 28:30.280]  your master of arms or your ex-checker your person that you know does your
[28:30.280 --> 28:36.200]  banking for you I'm gonna return in 60 years and when I come back I want you
[28:36.200 --> 28:41.200]  to everything good order oh yes Prince I'll handle it all for you and you come
[28:41.200 --> 28:47.360]  back an old man 60 years later and the son of the master of arms meets you there
[28:47.360 --> 28:56.880]  and is waiting to kill you at the front gate swat team you the son of the ex
[28:56.880 --> 29:04.040]  checker of the treasurer is now the king and has told all these horrible
[29:04.040 --> 29:08.320]  stories about how you committed these murders in your faraway journey and
[29:08.320 --> 29:11.360]  they basically arrest you and burn you at the stake I mean you know that's what
[29:11.360 --> 29:15.480]  America is that's what the cameras and the cops running around everywhere and
[29:15.480 --> 29:25.400]  the CPS and the corruption the land grabbing all of it that's all it is and
[29:25.400 --> 29:30.400]  that's why they tell you hey you're a little person sit down and shut up
[29:30.400 --> 29:35.200]  you're not only the sovereign you're not only the kings and queens of your castle
[29:35.200 --> 29:38.360]  of your home you pay a yearly rent that's going to go up and up property tax
[29:38.360 --> 29:41.880]  and you've got environmental cops on your property and you've got people on the
[29:41.880 --> 29:45.360]  public schools that you pay for spying on your children looking for any excuse
[29:45.360 --> 29:51.840]  to have them seized and you think that's a service while the enemy the New World
[29:51.840 --> 29:56.320]  Order wants to overrun the country drive down wages bankrupt the states so they
[29:56.320 --> 30:00.000]  can fully federalize health care and policing overrunning with millions of
[30:00.000 --> 30:04.200]  poor third-world people who were then taught by us funded foundations to hate
[30:04.200 --> 30:07.800]  America want to bring America down with what the globalist want and they're
[30:07.800 --> 30:12.200]  above the law and don't get tickets and don't get DWIs and don't get taken to
[30:12.200 --> 30:15.640]  jail in almost every case and it's even admitted in the newspapers and we like
[30:15.640 --> 30:20.240]  schmucks like jokes sit there and take it
[30:22.720 --> 30:26.560]  and I keep harping on that because that's a big deal that it's all selectively
[30:26.560 --> 30:30.400]  enforced it's legal for foreign drug cartels to invest in the New York stock
[30:30.400 --> 30:36.720]  exchange just a US citizen camp then that's money laundering the Texas
[30:36.720 --> 30:40.240]  legislature and other legislatures can sit there and vote repeatedly and vote
[30:40.240 --> 30:44.160]  for each other which is a felony under state law and they even say on the news
[30:44.160 --> 30:48.160]  in front of cameras yeah I do this but no one enforces it felony felony felony
[30:48.160 --> 30:58.600]  felony just lawless criminal running while doing whatever they want and it's
[30:58.600 --> 31:01.440]  going to get a lot worse
[31:03.040 --> 31:07.000]  now I said I'm gonna go to your calls and I am but I'm gonna get into this more
[31:07.000 --> 31:18.920]  later I told you that when they turned on the Hadron large Hadron to lighter
[31:18.920 --> 31:25.240]  but the world wasn't gonna end what we said is mainline physicists and
[31:25.240 --> 31:30.160]  scientists have surmised that as they do thousands and thousands of tests over
[31:30.160 --> 31:35.080]  the years to come each time there's a very low probability that a strange lit
[31:35.080 --> 31:43.120]  or a uncharged particle or there's hundreds of dangerous scenarios hydrogen
[31:43.120 --> 31:47.880]  explosions anti-matter explosions that as they do thousands of tests that it
[31:47.880 --> 31:56.880]  becomes probable there will be some type of disaster but the public doesn't know
[31:56.880 --> 32:01.360]  that the public doesn't know that at the Manhattan Project the majority of the
[32:01.360 --> 32:05.720]  scientist including the father of the bomb thought that it might catch the
[32:05.720 --> 32:10.440]  atmosphere on fire and that some of their equation showed that and that they
[32:10.440 --> 32:15.480]  thought it was probable and that it might actually burn the earth to a crisp
[32:15.480 --> 32:22.920]  by the way they later built bombs that actually do that now now that's in the
[32:22.920 --> 32:27.520]  mainline books and the interviews I can play some for you here of the inventors
[32:27.520 --> 32:33.400]  of the bomb the a bomb then in the 50s they wanted to test to see if the
[32:33.400 --> 32:38.240]  atmosphere would catch on fire or it would cause a magnetic pulse EMP
[32:38.240 --> 32:43.480]  electromagnetic pulse that would blow out all transitional planet so in one
[32:43.480 --> 32:47.520]  night they detonated what was it 60-something high-powered hydrogen
[32:47.520 --> 32:54.880]  bombs over the New Mexico Arizona desert remember that it's in Trinity that
[32:54.880 --> 33:00.560]  big discovery channel special narrated by William Shatner you go rented it
[33:00.560 --> 33:05.800]  blockbuster Hollywood video you think I'm joking rent it they're firing them up
[33:05.800 --> 33:13.160]  into the upper atmosphere trying to catch it on fire and it did blow out
[33:13.160 --> 33:17.080]  the circuitry but it did it randomly it might blow some out in Chile and blow some
[33:17.080 --> 33:26.680]  out in Africa or blow some out in Japan it was random and so they take the god
[33:26.680 --> 33:30.960]  of death Shiva she represents many things I know Collie's the main Hindu god of
[33:30.960 --> 33:36.320]  death that takes Shiva and they put her above the Hadron heavy collider and then
[33:36.320 --> 33:41.000]  now they're gonna do thousands of tests and by 2012 for some reason they plan to
[33:41.000 --> 33:45.800]  do it at thousands of times the current strength that set taking huge particle
[33:45.800 --> 33:50.120]  beams they've accelerated and running heavy particles uranium plutonium and
[33:50.120 --> 33:55.680]  others together head-on now that's how you get hydrogen bombs that's how you
[33:55.680 --> 34:00.720]  get thermonuclear explosions and there's all these and then I've even seen
[34:00.720 --> 34:04.800]  Hadron scientists go well it could create a black hole but it'll be small and
[34:04.800 --> 34:11.760]  probably won't cause any problems but we're going to do this and so people
[34:11.760 --> 34:15.560]  say well we should have a debate about this this should be assessed and we're
[34:15.560 --> 34:20.040]  crazy people we're bad we're nuts all these top scientists leave different
[34:20.040 --> 34:24.320]  biotech companies we've had them on as guest here they feed them to rats feed
[34:24.320 --> 34:28.800]  them to guinea pigs GMO potatoes GMO carrots they'll change one gene in it
[34:28.800 --> 34:31.480]  and they'll get that one change but it'll randomly change thousands of other
[34:31.480 --> 34:34.880]  things and it's killing the animals shrinking their brains attacking their
[34:34.880 --> 34:45.520]  organs they're dying they know and still it's approved in 1991 an executive order
[34:45.520 --> 34:51.160]  says anything can basically be approved if it looks like a potato or looks like
[34:51.160 --> 34:56.760]  a carrot and so now for more than a decade you can buy glowing rhesus monkeys
[34:56.760 --> 35:01.880]  from China or South Korea or Hong Kong and people have them here in the states
[35:01.880 --> 35:07.040]  but on the news a glowing monkey that in the dark glows blue because it's part
[35:07.040 --> 35:13.040]  jellyfish you know what that does taking a colony animal and then putting its
[35:13.040 --> 35:19.000]  DNA splicing into the skin DNA the DNA that expresses into tissue of a monkey
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.120]  and then putting that toxic waste jumping out dumping the ocean the range
[35:24.120 --> 35:28.680]  forest being chopped down all that serious plankton die-offs overfishing all
[35:28.680 --> 35:33.240]  that's real no we'll just have a global tax and people will drive around with
[35:33.240 --> 35:38.000]  carbon indulgences oh I I give money to an environmental group to steal more
[35:38.000 --> 35:41.720]  private property and then I stick a sticker on my car saying that I have a
[35:41.720 --> 35:47.640]  carbon credit it's like an indulgence oh I commit sin I've committed adultery
[35:47.640 --> 35:53.880]  I'll go buy from the church a carbon indulgence I drive an SUV I'm evil I'll
[35:53.880 --> 36:01.240]  buy a carbon indulgence warning sounded on the future of the web so this is
[36:01.240 --> 36:07.280]  what they're saying now now now again internet to institutions the government
[36:07.280 --> 36:10.440]  are shutting down the old web killing it bringing in filtering control the new
[36:10.440 --> 36:13.920]  web will be highly tax regulated we'll have a subpage with a government or
[36:13.920 --> 36:16.960]  industry domain you'll have no free speech rights that can shut you down
[36:16.960 --> 36:22.160]  whenever they want this is all stated but they claim terrorists are about to
[36:22.160 --> 36:25.720]  attack the internet to shut it down oh they'll kill the old internet but you'll
[36:25.720 --> 36:30.280]  go to the new internet don't worry warnings sounded on web's future because
[36:30.280 --> 36:35.520]  we're crazy and on the web said that the Hadron collider might be dangerous they
[36:35.520 --> 36:41.360]  misrepresented it and said that we said the earth would end last Thursday
[36:42.400 --> 36:48.680]  warnings sounded on web's future BBC the internet needs a way to help people
[36:48.680 --> 36:54.800]  separate rumor from real science oh they will tell you says the creator of the
[36:54.800 --> 37:01.560]  worldwide web kind of like scopes that website about urban legends that tells
[37:01.560 --> 37:05.840]  you there's no such thing as a human pig hybrid doesn't matter what's all
[37:05.840 --> 37:08.120]  admitted in hundreds of mainline publication I just said doesn't exist
[37:08.120 --> 37:12.200]  public so it doesn't exist so you wanted to I guess maybe the urban legend
[37:12.200 --> 37:16.960]  website can tell us that major banks and brokerage houses aren't going bankrupt
[37:16.960 --> 37:20.920]  every day maybe you can tell us there's no inflation because the White House does
[37:20.920 --> 37:28.960]  maybe that it's a world of delusion and denial talking to the BBC sir Tim
[37:28.960 --> 37:36.080]  burners Lee said he was increasingly worried about the way web has been used
[37:36.080 --> 37:42.240]  to spread disinformation you mean like WMD is around Iraq or how the Intel
[37:42.240 --> 37:46.880]  Center run by the CIA uploads fake Al Qaeda videos you mean like that sir
[37:46.880 --> 37:51.520]  Tim spoke prior to the unveiling of the foundation he has co-created that aims
[37:51.520 --> 37:57.800]  to make the web truly worldwide you will also look at ways to help people
[37:57.800 --> 38:02.720]  decide if sites are trustworthy and reliable sources of information yeah go
[38:02.720 --> 38:07.480]  ahead and certify and people will then believe whatever site isn't certified by
[38:07.480 --> 38:13.640]  you you think people listen to any of your bull anymore you really think we're
[38:13.640 --> 38:17.320]  listening to you let all you know it's too late your newspapers are already all
[38:17.320 --> 38:21.260]  going bankrupt it's too late your TV is already totally just Congress has got a
[38:21.260 --> 38:25.800]  9% approval rating you may bring a few suckers in with Palin and Obama's new
[38:25.800 --> 38:30.680]  faces a woman a black guy but people see through that in five minutes it's over
[38:30.680 --> 38:35.120]  for you now you were able to rob and steal everything and poison people and
[38:35.120 --> 38:42.400]  give one in three diabetes and one in three cancer from one in 33 and you were
[38:42.400 --> 38:45.520]  able to kill a lot of us and carry out your eugenics operations but we're
[38:45.520 --> 38:55.120]  getting wise to you a sort of conspiracy theory of sorts and which you
[38:55.120 --> 39:01.000]  can imagine spreading the thousands of people and being deeply damaging he said
[39:01.000 --> 39:07.960]  he goes on to say it was just horrible that people said that the Hadron
[39:07.960 --> 39:12.280]  Collider was going to destroy the world last Wednesday and Thursday no one said
[39:12.280 --> 39:16.160]  that people said there is a potential that hasn't had an environmental
[39:16.160 --> 39:21.200]  assessment done I'm not a fan of giving a website a simple number like an IQ
[39:21.200 --> 39:25.640]  rating because people they can vary in all kinds of different ways he said so
[39:25.640 --> 39:28.360]  I'd be interested in different organizations labeling websites in
[39:28.360 --> 39:33.520]  different ways sir Tim spoke to the BBC to publicize the launch of his
[39:33.520 --> 39:37.320]  worldwide web foundation which aims to improve the web's accessibility and I
[39:37.320 --> 39:39.880]  got to say this guy's claimed he's against internet too and that it is a
[39:39.880 --> 39:44.200]  plan to take over so he says some good things but he says it's discrediting the
[39:44.200 --> 39:47.800]  web all that is info out there and it is but people got to learn that that's
[39:47.800 --> 39:51.080]  what free speech is about there's going to be bull there's going to be stuff
[39:51.080 --> 39:56.720]  that's accurate as you know that's the way it is sir Tim talked to the BBC in
[39:56.720 --> 40:04.200]  the week in which CERN where he did his pioneering work on the web turned on the
[40:04.200 --> 40:09.160]  large Hadron Collider for the first time the use of the web has spread fears
[40:09.160 --> 40:13.560]  that plucking the switch for the light hardened reactor could create a black
[40:13.560 --> 40:15.840]  hole
[40:22.280 --> 40:30.000]  the Babylon system is the vampire sucking the blood of the children
[40:30.000 --> 40:36.120]  the Babylon system is the vampire
[40:36.120 --> 40:41.560]  one eight hundred two five at nine nine two three one
[40:44.400 --> 40:50.040]  well they told us trust the banking system trust panty man Freddy Mack don't
[40:50.040 --> 40:54.280]  listen to conspiracy theorists
[40:54.280 --> 41:01.720]  don't listen to all the physicists saying that these superconducting super
[41:01.720 --> 41:06.920]  colliders turned up on high be really dangerous top scientists back when
[41:06.920 --> 41:10.440]  they were building one in Texas said don't do it before there's more studies
[41:10.440 --> 41:14.400]  but that doesn't matter we've got a government that detonates high-powered
[41:14.400 --> 41:19.360]  hydrogen bombs in the high atmosphere just to see if it'll blow holes in the
[41:19.360 --> 41:23.160]  atmosphere or set the atmosphere on fire we've got a government that's
[41:23.160 --> 41:28.880]  completely psychopathic and and if you don't like it you know if you don't think
[41:28.880 --> 41:32.960]  drinking pesticide in your water tables good for you you're a conspiracy
[41:32.960 --> 41:38.160]  theorist the conspiracy theory label is about people rationalizing and living in
[41:38.160 --> 41:41.840]  denial oh it's a conspiracy theory that if you jump in front of an 18-wheeler
[41:41.840 --> 41:45.800]  going a hundred miles an hour that it might hurt you actually it's good for
[41:45.800 --> 41:49.800]  you I stand in front of 18 wheelers going a hundred miles an hour every day
[41:49.800 --> 41:54.240]  it's a way to just neutralize discussion and that's what the public wants they
[41:54.240 --> 41:58.240]  don't want to think but some people do and that number is growing okay look I
[41:58.240 --> 42:04.360]  said I'd have open phones today I am for the next two hours wide open phones
[42:04.360 --> 42:09.200]  interspersed with financial and military news like Pakistan fires at U.S.
[42:09.200 --> 42:15.080]  helicopters we're gonna go to Mike Roberto Dana Frank Steve and many others
[42:15.080 --> 42:19.760]  that are patiently holding continually going to your phone calls as quickly as
[42:19.760 --> 42:23.640]  possible now let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Texas thanks for holding Mike
[42:23.640 --> 42:27.640]  hey Alex thank you for taking my call sir I'm a hurricane survivor and thank
[42:27.640 --> 42:33.280]  God I only have minor damage the junior relatives are they okay yeah it was not
[42:33.280 --> 42:38.920]  as bad as the media had said as the headline hurricane not as bad as
[42:38.920 --> 42:44.840]  expected but 26 dead and large parts of Galveston and Houston are really torn
[42:44.840 --> 42:50.680]  up and so very very serious well no my family's fine I about my family in
[42:50.680 --> 42:55.200]  Houston ended up coming you know to East Texas while we were there right what
[42:55.200 --> 42:58.200]  I'm gonna tell you last night I was listening to news conference on radio
[42:58.200 --> 43:03.080]  and we go to Pino one of the investigative reporters of Channel 13 was
[43:03.080 --> 43:07.160]  mad at the governor they are not letting anybody fly over Bolivar Peninsula and
[43:07.160 --> 43:12.120]  they're not letting anybody in and they can understand why well they said
[43:12.120 --> 43:15.840]  finally well there might be some unpleasant surprises well what do you
[43:15.840 --> 43:19.680]  think they're trying to hide well a lot of times we know in New Orleans they
[43:19.680 --> 43:23.520]  shot and killed hundreds of people and they gun confiscated and killed a lot
[43:23.520 --> 43:27.320]  of citizens that wouldn't turn their guns in and they had to mop that up and
[43:27.320 --> 43:31.800]  cover that up and under a national security umbrella and FEMA uses this
[43:31.800 --> 43:35.920]  as an excuse to train the public that they'll see people didn't want to leave
[43:35.920 --> 43:38.280]  because they knew they were gonna be locked out now they're talking about
[43:38.280 --> 43:46.800]  people being locked out of Galveston for weeks and a lot of people were poor
[43:46.800 --> 43:50.520]  didn't have cars they wouldn't let them take their pets and so they got on
[43:50.520 --> 43:54.000]  buses they were taken to FEMA camps they were given barcode IDs they were
[43:54.000 --> 43:59.680]  treated like prisoners and now their dogs and cats are gonna die and again
[43:59.680 --> 44:02.520]  people didn't used to leave in the past so it's about the media training is that
[44:02.520 --> 44:06.920]  citizens are bad citizens not listening or bad citizens are stupid the
[44:06.920 --> 44:10.920]  authorities just love us and want to take care of us and and separate from a
[44:10.920 --> 44:13.680]  debate about whether you should leave or not the point is that's up to the
[44:13.680 --> 44:17.920]  people and and it puts the government in the place of being the boss and us
[44:17.920 --> 44:22.360]  being like mindless children that they sit on high and give us our orders that
[44:22.360 --> 44:25.480]  you know that's what all the public service announcements they may sound
[44:25.480 --> 44:28.720]  reasonable but that's setting the precedent that the government is the
[44:28.720 --> 44:32.320]  lawgiver the government sits up there and we're a bunch of you know buffoons
[44:32.320 --> 44:36.360]  they always show scum on the shows like cops and busted they always show
[44:36.360 --> 44:41.560]  dumb people that don't listen they're good we're bad they're good we're bad
[44:41.560 --> 44:47.880]  and yes they've locked out Galveston Bolivar and so and they catch them
[44:47.880 --> 44:50.960]  everywhere the military the gang member military can now loot and steal and
[44:50.960 --> 44:56.360]  rape and kill and do whatever they want stay there we'll talk more about it
[44:56.360 --> 45:08.360]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[45:08.360 --> 45:15.920]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[45:15.920 --> 45:28.480]  Alex Jones I'm not saying that even 5% of the military is looting and robbing
[45:28.480 --> 45:34.160]  and raping in areas of south Texas right now but we know in Louisiana that did
[45:34.160 --> 45:37.840]  happen on record we've interviewed eyewitnesses that came out in the news
[45:37.840 --> 45:41.280]  and even after the police chief came out and said we're confiscating everybody's
[45:41.280 --> 45:46.000]  guns even in high and dry areas the media said that's not true it's a
[45:46.000 --> 45:50.160]  conspiracy theory in the in the police chief and the fed said no we we really
[45:50.160 --> 45:55.080]  are and they put the video out on the news see this is going on they really are
[45:55.080 --> 45:59.040]  using the army to confiscate guns with just a quiet announcement all over
[45:59.040 --> 46:05.600]  Illinois no emergency happened there this is a rogue government period Mike
[46:05.600 --> 46:11.240]  anything else also the radio heard yesterday that this is atrocious the
[46:11.240 --> 46:15.320]  first responders were calling people to say hey we don't have enough food and
[46:15.320 --> 46:19.760]  water for us they were asking the public if they had any spare food or water to
[46:19.760 --> 46:23.240]  bring it to tell the stadium over on the west side of Houston because they didn't
[46:23.240 --> 46:25.920]  have enough food for the first responders that tells me right there
[46:25.920 --> 46:31.320]  that's incompetence well it's not that FEMA can't let any of the money actually
[46:31.320 --> 46:36.720]  go to real gear okay it's got to all go into the no bid contracts fifteen
[46:36.720 --> 46:40.200]  million dollars per plastic tarp and I'm not joking it has to all go into
[46:40.200 --> 46:47.480]  offshore banks see see see FEMA by design cut the power turn the police
[46:47.480 --> 46:52.160]  radios off the police caught them hacking the police radios the towers the
[46:52.160 --> 46:56.000]  police at gunpoint and then the police have been on record saying this they
[46:56.000 --> 46:59.560]  were ordered to disband people ask why the New Orleans police left FEMA ordered
[46:59.560 --> 47:02.480]  them out of the city and cut their radios off and then the cops all tried to
[47:02.480 --> 47:05.680]  go to the police station and they said oh look at the New Orleans cops you know
[47:05.680 --> 47:11.200]  80% of them just walks off the job FEMA cut their lines that's admitted yeah same
[47:11.200 --> 47:15.800]  thing in Houston so it's meant to have the local first responders break down so
[47:15.800 --> 47:21.480]  then FEMA could say oh we screwed up we need more funds more power it's sick it
[47:21.480 --> 47:25.720]  really is you know and our neighbors and I we we all got together last night and
[47:25.720 --> 47:30.640]  had a imp impromptu basically gathering and this disaster I think it's causing
[47:30.640 --> 47:34.360]  communities to get close together again Alex everybody I'm talking to is trying
[47:34.360 --> 47:37.120]  to help each other what I tell my government officials what's on my
[47:37.120 --> 47:40.560]  neighbor on neighbor well no that's what's gonna do it and that's why they
[47:40.560 --> 47:43.120]  shouldn't keep people out of there because letting them back in let them
[47:43.120 --> 47:47.360]  you know let's them fix their their lives fix their homes I appreciate your
[47:47.360 --> 47:55.400]  call good to hear from you Mike listen it is not incompetence it is done by
[47:55.400 --> 48:02.200]  designed to set precedence Roberto in New York then others go ahead
[48:02.200 --> 48:06.920]  hello Alex real quick I just wanted to make a quick point I went down to 9-11
[48:06.920 --> 48:12.680]  and you know about the military I saw military police in American streets over
[48:12.680 --> 48:16.120]  there when I was protesting for 9-11 truth it was just mind-boggling I asked
[48:16.120 --> 48:19.440]  them where posse common totises and you know they just kind of smirked at me and
[48:19.440 --> 48:22.480]  kept walking yeah it's real funny they think they have power hey roll your
[48:22.480 --> 48:27.320]  sleeves up boys Uncle Sam's got something real good for you yeah but
[48:27.320 --> 48:32.360]  anyways listen it's really not too much about the economy but it is because I
[48:32.360 --> 48:36.760]  do pay for security every time you know I work for my check I called you about a
[48:36.760 --> 48:40.000]  week ago but everything was going on yeah more than half of Americans think
[48:40.000 --> 48:43.600]  their refund checks are free then they don't even think they pay taxes they
[48:43.600 --> 48:47.360]  don't know it's taken out of their check yeah well but the point I wanted to get
[48:47.360 --> 48:51.560]  to is that um you know I went into I called you a week ago about the
[48:51.560 --> 48:55.880]  Crohn's disease and I went into Medicaid trying to get because you know I
[48:55.880 --> 48:59.840]  got too sick I lost my job I couldn't work so I went to Medicaid to try and
[48:59.840 --> 49:06.040]  get um you know temporary assistance and they come up to me I get like five
[49:06.040 --> 49:10.160]  forms of ID right they come up to me I was the respectful I did everything I
[49:10.160 --> 49:14.640]  had to do I filled every all the forms out then you know they told me that I
[49:14.640 --> 49:18.200]  would be able to get it because the medication for Crohn's disease is about
[49:18.200 --> 49:23.520]  $400 a bottle so I did everything I had to do on a Medicaid or were they
[49:23.520 --> 49:28.200]  giving you a court of cutopic steroids it's uh it's called pentatum and an
[49:28.200 --> 49:34.320]  accord one of them is a one of them is a steroid so I go into um I go into there
[49:34.320 --> 49:37.680]  and they tell me that they lead me into a room and tell me that I have to give a
[49:37.680 --> 49:42.600]  digital footprint analysis on this little machine in order to get it and I
[49:42.600 --> 49:46.560]  told them I want to hear more about it of course you know they hit you and hit
[49:46.560 --> 49:51.720]  you hard with those vaccines mommy gave you I'm sorry they soft killed you but
[49:51.720 --> 49:57.720]  you'll you'll make it stay with us the Genesis Communications radio network
[49:57.720 --> 50:04.040]  proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[50:04.040 --> 50:10.440]  Crohn's disease didn't exist until the 50s now it's exploded thousands and
[50:10.440 --> 50:17.480]  thousands of percentile every decade there are hundreds of major medical
[50:17.480 --> 50:28.240]  institution studies is a main line where they find viral infections from
[50:28.240 --> 50:35.720]  vaccines in the intestines the body then has an autoimmune response just like
[50:35.720 --> 50:39.880]  there are hundreds of major studies confirming that vaccines are causing
[50:39.880 --> 50:47.560]  inflammation in tissues in organs and in glands and really cause problems for
[50:47.560 --> 50:51.360]  the pancreas and so it doesn't matter if you never had diabetes in your family
[50:51.360 --> 50:55.720]  doesn't matter if you exercise it matter how healthy you are you're gonna get it
[50:55.720 --> 51:02.960]  because you've had your shots because the government is run by eugenicist but
[51:02.960 --> 51:06.800]  hey you can laugh and giggle about that folks I'm just trying to warn you I burn
[51:06.800 --> 51:12.800]  with a desire to warn people somehow shake you out of your slumber you think
[51:12.800 --> 51:15.160]  you're a jail guard you think the system will tell you not to give your kid
[51:15.160 --> 51:19.000]  shots you think you're a cop you think you're a CIA officer you're gonna get a
[51:19.000 --> 51:24.520]  warning you're not gonna get a warning let's say you're some FBI agent who's
[51:24.520 --> 51:29.880]  got a hemophiliac child who's dying at HIV and hepatitis from factor 8 from
[51:29.880 --> 51:35.160]  Bayer did you get a warning no but chances are you're just gonna rationalize
[51:35.160 --> 51:40.800]  and take your kids plant them in a field when they die and cry and boo-hoo and
[51:40.800 --> 51:44.880]  have a preacher there when you bury them because you love the system you're
[51:44.880 --> 51:50.080]  gonna go down with it even if it kills your children going back to Roberto in
[51:50.080 --> 51:55.080]  New York okay so you got five forms of ID they want to register you in this

[52:08.360 --> 52:11.760]  tell them absolutely not and I told them I'd rather be sick instead of do that
[52:11.760 --> 52:15.120]  and compromise my integrity of the human being so I told them you know you can
[52:15.120 --> 52:19.680]  keep your thumb skin and I left and then I called the Social Security
[52:19.680 --> 52:23.960]  Office in New York and actually got a recorded statement you know because they
[52:23.960 --> 52:27.880]  didn't know I was recording it on that I put up on YouTube where they were I was
[52:27.880 --> 52:30.800]  telling them you know look this is violating my constitutional rights and
[52:30.800 --> 52:35.440]  the guy talking to me he's pretty much like well it's for your own safety to
[52:35.440 --> 52:41.000]  violate the privacy act and violates federal law yeah again federal law only
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.800]  exists for slaves exactly and it's and it's you know so I got a recorded

[53:39.840 --> 53:46.720]  autoimmune responses there's a lot of studies showing it triggers the viral
[53:46.720 --> 53:51.880]  scarring that people have in their intestines caused by particularly the
[53:51.880 --> 53:57.480]  measles mumps and rubella shots that especially in the 60s and 70s and 80s
[53:57.480 --> 54:04.120]  were live and there's some other shots that had live virus in them but even the
[54:04.120 --> 54:10.560]  dead virus the DNA is impregnating the gut see the gut is meant to absorb and
[54:10.560 --> 54:16.120]  accept a lot of different viruses and bacteria and it's very complex but that's
[54:16.120 --> 54:21.400]  part of your body's different line of defense is having that wide diversity
[54:21.400 --> 54:29.000]  and also breaking down food but then when you have a bio weapon introduced into
[54:29.000 --> 54:38.800]  you it can find a place to live in your stomach in your intestine upper and
[54:38.800 --> 54:42.120]  lower intestine large and small intestine and that's all the actual
[54:42.120 --> 54:45.040]  medical reports you gonna look that up yourself thank you so much I'm sorry to
[54:45.040 --> 54:52.440]  hear you're going through so much Roberto I would tell you you see I
[54:52.440 --> 54:56.240]  wouldn't got arrested for fusing the thumb scan in 1997 and I said we've got
[54:56.240 --> 55:00.440]  to stop this going in it's a national ID card here's the executive orders I said
[55:00.440 --> 55:03.920]  it's gonna be in gyms it's gonna be in tanning salons public schools are gonna
[55:03.920 --> 55:08.040]  put it in for kids to get their school lunches about a year later it started I
[55:08.040 --> 55:12.320]  was reading federal documents they're gonna use us for global sales tax track
[55:12.320 --> 55:16.160]  everywhere you go even if you have cash and the thumb print and face scan to do
[55:16.160 --> 55:21.800]  it they will turn off your scan if you can even use cash anyone who takes cash
[55:21.800 --> 55:26.080]  from you outside the system will be arrested basically permanently detained
[55:26.080 --> 55:33.920]  I mean this is the running man but now that it's in place why should patriots
[55:33.920 --> 55:38.000]  drive around without driver's license and without their slave cards and go to
[55:38.000 --> 55:42.960]  the prisons and end up in their system because we're coming towards a point
[55:42.960 --> 55:49.640]  where you won't come out and then the argument is well we got to do this to
[55:49.640 --> 55:53.000]  stop illegal aliens they're all above the law I've been at the hospital no ID no
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.400]  nothing they just go to the front of the line it's a federal mandate it's only for
[55:56.400 --> 56:01.640]  us the citizens but I would tell you you know you might as well just go ahead and
[56:01.640 --> 56:05.880]  thumbs cancer every state's already doing it you know all the time not all the
[56:05.880 --> 56:10.320]  time maybe I don't know a whole bunch of times people walk up to me at a grocery
[56:10.320 --> 56:15.560]  store or a church or the mall the street and say I saw your TV show you're a
[56:15.560 --> 56:22.680]  liar there ain't no thumb print to get a driver's license I saw you getting
[56:22.680 --> 56:26.600]  arrested in there that's fake I went in there and there was none of that in
[56:26.600 --> 56:30.920]  there and I go you don't remember putting your finger on a black box with a
[56:30.920 --> 56:36.520]  red light I remember that but there weren't no print I don't know that's a

[57:14.760 --> 57:17.880]  wimp type of things he's tough wearing a UT shirt and he'll just kind of be like
[57:17.880 --> 57:27.240]  huh look he's no exchange you look at him he's a liar liar okay I'm lying to you
[57:27.240 --> 57:30.920]  then pal that's what it takes in your weak little mind your weak little world
[57:30.920 --> 57:36.760]  don't worry you're gonna get everything you want Frank in Mississippi you're on
[57:36.760 --> 57:43.840]  the air welcome Frank dropped I get my list confused here who's up next even
[57:43.840 --> 57:50.480]  Chicago and then Ben and Jerry and sherry Frank you know no who's up to
[57:50.480 --> 57:55.720]  Steven Chicago go ahead yes Alex I enjoy your show but there are a couple of
[57:55.720 --> 58:00.240]  points I take issue with you number one you were talking about some kind of
[58:00.240 --> 58:05.000]  racial bias I said did you see yesterday's the New York Times were in
[58:05.000 --> 58:09.360]  there there was an article about registering of voters who are ex felons
[58:09.360 --> 58:16.080]  or felons and then it said there and I'm gonna quote it last month Obama campaign
[58:16.080 --> 58:19.200]  workers took down a sign at their headquarters in Pottsville Pennsylvania
[58:19.200 --> 58:23.400]  that said felons can both because it might have sent the long message now I
[58:23.400 --> 58:27.360]  called you before and talked to you about sixty five soldiers were killed
[58:27.360 --> 58:34.640]  from Memorial Day to Labor Day while 123 Chicagoans were murdered at this
[58:34.640 --> 58:38.040]  effort that same amount of time now you're telling me there isn't any
[58:38.040 --> 58:44.320]  relationship between Obama and crime no no no there were twice as many murders
[58:44.320 --> 58:52.200]  in Chicago in the same period for dead US troops in Iraq so it's twice as bad as
[58:52.200 --> 58:56.160]  you're saying right and and and the situation is that you can see the
[58:56.160 --> 58:59.640]  direct link because they're recruiting these people and that's a New York Times
[58:59.640 --> 59:04.640]  article the second thing you keep talking about this Randy Scheuerman of
[59:04.640 --> 59:08.640]  the project new century and new American century that he caused the war in
[59:08.640 --> 59:14.160]  Georgia did you say that or there was it the the advisor would know we posted
[59:14.160 --> 59:19.840]  articles about the fact that McCain's one of his advisors is on the payroll of
[59:19.840 --> 59:23.640]  the Georgian government but it's a lot bigger than that our criminal government
[59:23.640 --> 59:27.880]  has been funding them for about eight years okay well I got two articles one
[59:27.880 --> 59:32.480]  was a financial Times-Deutschland and it's quoting the Svenska dog blotted
[59:32.480 --> 59:37.200]  that's a Swedish daily newspaper and it's talking about that new eavesdropping
[59:37.200 --> 59:43.120]  now a lot that they passed at Sweden was the moderate eighty percent are was
[59:43.120 --> 59:49.040]  the monitor the emails from Russia 80% of the emails from Russia go through the
[59:49.040 --> 59:56.280]  Telia TLIA scenario as so any our Swedish switching point and so that's the
[59:56.280 --> 1:00:01.200]  reason why they had that and from that all the government told you so no this
[1:00:01.200 --> 1:00:07.600]  is this is out of the Svenska dog blot I will listen I got some serious issues
[1:00:07.600 --> 1:00:11.800]  here with you I don't know what you're talking about there's a lot of hole on
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:18.880]  a minute a lot of people built straw men here with the show and by that I'm not
[1:00:18.880 --> 1:00:24.160]  saying that Chicago is on a crime-infested hellhole of gun
[1:00:24.160 --> 1:00:28.480]  confiscation for decades because it's run by the son of a mob boss who was a mob
[1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:34.040]  boss himself mayor daily and I just talked last hour about how they're now
[1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:37.960]  confiscating guns all over the state harassing gun owners using the army and
[1:00:37.960 --> 1:00:42.480]  so wherever you have crime bosses ruling they want disarmed slaves and the
[1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:45.560]  Chicago police have been known to be criminal for a hundred years I mean
[1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:49.600]  that's public knowledge so I don't and they even shake down local businesses
[1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:54.680]  they are the mob from the days of Al Capone and before and of course he's
[1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:59.400]  big city corruption you're not getting it I'm saying there isn't a lesser of two
[1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:02.680]  evils they're both puppets none of them will ever run anything
[1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:06.800]  Barack Obama and John McCain are guys at the back of the bus I want you to look
[1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:10.360]  at who's driving the bus instead of having this debate about these two
[1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:15.720]  puppets but the situation is he doesn't have street gangsterism to have
[1:01:15.720 --> 1:01:19.720]  committed heinous crimes fiendish criminals the evilest of evil
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:24.000]  supporting him for his candidacy that's that's a difference both of them are
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:28.720]  world-order new world-order candidates but who's got the street gangsters and
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:34.120]  the muscle to back it up it's Obama well they're all gonna be hurt real bad and
[1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:38.640]  a great depression all the gangster mac daddy ism's gonna go by the wayside real
[1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:47.040]  fast all right I appreciate your call you know I just can't I just it doesn't
[1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:51.120]  matter Sarah Palin none of them they run nothing they are nothing and until we
[1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:55.240]  start realizing that and then realize these are just puppets we're gonna keep
[1:01:55.240 --> 1:01:58.960]  failing have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too
[1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:02.600]  much about your financial affairs I continue to hear stories about property
[1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:06.920]  seizures frozen bank accounts confiscation of stocks and bonds it makes
[1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:10.760]  me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life liberty and
[1:02:10.760 --> 1:02:14.840]  the pursuit of happiness unfortunately with the drug and money laundering act
[1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:19.560]  the IRS revenue ruling 6045 of 1984 and the trading with the enemy act in
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:24.360]  Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933 some precious metal holdings are
[1:02:24.360 --> 1:02:27.840]  subject to government intervention for this reason Midas Resources has
[1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:31.040]  prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals
[1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:34.080]  privately whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas
[1:02:34.080 --> 1:02:37.440]  Resources or not I have instructed my representatives to give this report out
[1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:43.560]  free call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237 when investing always
[1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:49.720]  proceed with caution again call 1-800-686-2237 exercise your legal right
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:56.080]  to trade metals privately 1-800-686-2237
[1:02:58.080 --> 1:03:03.840]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:17.640]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:23.840]  that last guy is a classic good old boy he means well but he always calls in
[1:03:23.840 --> 1:03:29.000]  telling us how Obama has real power and basically flaps around like a vampire
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:35.040]  bat at night gonna suck our blood just picture Barack Obama's head with two
[1:03:35.040 --> 1:03:40.680]  little bat wings the guy runs nothing is nothing he's meant to make the public
[1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:44.800]  think there's change coming that they've actually got power through the corrupt
[1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:51.320]  system instead of power by exposing the system for what it is that's the whole
[1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:55.400]  point here they don't want you talking about how they are repossessing the whole
[1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:59.840]  country bankrupting it and paying off all their debts in our names the private
[1:03:59.840 --> 1:04:06.400]  banks they want us discussing Sarah Palin and Barack Obama these two
[1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:11.840]  candidates were cut out of whole cloth to sell the public on being suckered
[1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:15.840]  back in to discussing this new soap opera
[1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:24.920]  meanwhile for those that are not aware of the situation huge things are
[1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:29.720]  happening Lehman Brothers burdened by over 60 billion in soured real estate
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:33.000]  holdings it's more than that it's all the junk investments they've sold that
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:38.080]  people aren't buying now it's bundling those not just bad real estate holdings
[1:04:38.080 --> 1:04:41.560]  that's a small part of it filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in US
[1:04:41.560 --> 1:04:46.120]  bankruptcy court after attempts to rescue the 158 year old firm failed Bank of
[1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:50.680]  America Corporation said it is snapping up Merrill Lynch in company for 50
[1:04:50.680 --> 1:04:55.360]  billion all-stock transaction Merrill Lynch before was worth a lot more than
[1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:59.800]  that that's pennies on the dollar the demise of the independent Wall Street
[1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:04.000]  institutions names of shock waves from a 14 month old credit crisis
[1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:09.040]  royal to US financial system six months after the collapse of Bear Stearns and
[1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:11.600]  they always say this is the end it's going to get better it's going to get
[1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:16.040]  better they know full well where this leads they just got to make you think
[1:05:16.040 --> 1:05:19.480]  everything's okay and the public likes to rationalize they like to procrastinate
[1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:23.040]  they like to be lied to and they say okay everything's fine so you don't get
[1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:27.400]  politically involved so they can fully implode things so you've got to pay for
[1:05:27.400 --> 1:05:33.200]  all this and you're always thinking well I'll just pass it on to my kids it's not
[1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:37.840]  going to be passed on to your children you understand you understand you
[1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:43.200]  understand that so you can run around and go to church and hear your preacher
[1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:49.400]  talk about how Jesus is about to appear and lead us to war with the Arabs you
[1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:52.320]  haven't read revelations or you know that's what the Antichrist doesn't
[1:05:52.320 --> 1:05:56.040]  matter you're not going to find all that out you're just going to go to church
[1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:59.480]  and worship Sarah Palin and the liberals are going to go to their black
[1:05:59.480 --> 1:06:06.880]  churches and worship Barack Obama and just be suckers again and the cops are
[1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:11.080]  going to be on their power trips and the and the financial advisors are going
[1:06:11.080 --> 1:06:18.080]  to keep sucker in their people but people are going to remember the seeds we
[1:06:18.080 --> 1:06:24.600]  planted and the information we put out and the facts we covered and then as
[1:06:24.600 --> 1:06:29.640]  people see what we have predicted what we have laid out unfolded they will
[1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:37.040]  remember and in that is our hope okay let's talk to Ben in Virginia then Jerry
[1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:42.600]  Sherry Eric Erica and Karen go ahead Ben hey Alex I just had a couple of things
[1:06:42.600 --> 1:06:47.280]  you keep saying get ready for a victory well we had one on Thursday we had the
[1:06:47.280 --> 1:06:53.160]  most people show up in New York at any other event I've ever seen we had over
[1:06:53.160 --> 1:06:57.040]  3,000 people there we're marching through the streets it seemed more like a
[1:06:57.040 --> 1:07:01.240]  police escort than it was a babysitting service and I even saw some police
[1:07:01.240 --> 1:07:04.880]  chanting along with us I think we're having a huge effect and we're turning
[1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:10.880]  the tide so that's that's one thing I wanted to bring up and so hold on a
[1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:14.960]  minute did you get any video the police chanting along with you I know other
[1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:18.080]  people have I'm not sure if they've uploaded it yet because they're just
[1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:21.240]  getting back I mean we had a lot of people from Minnesota we had a lot of
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:25.040]  people from all over the country so yeah I'm totally a lot bigger later in the
[1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:30.760]  afternoon on September 11 oh it was huge we had people who who had no
[1:07:30.760 --> 1:07:35.000]  association with we are changed start marching along with us we grew as we
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:40.440]  walked it was enormous I was so impressed well I wanted to bring up
[1:07:40.440 --> 1:07:46.520]  another thing do you know about general Michael Aquino from the NSA yes yeah
[1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:50.040]  that I mean that's the easiest target that's the perfect example of what
[1:07:50.040 --> 1:07:54.280]  we're dealing with because this guy is so sick he actually he's the he's the
[1:07:54.280 --> 1:08:02.160]  grand commander of the international order of the temple of sat absolutely
[1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:08.040]  yeah this guy is the biggest sicko I'm just so surprised that people like him
[1:08:08.040 --> 1:08:11.760]  are allowed to keep their jobs in there isn't a public outcry for their jobs
[1:08:11.760 --> 1:08:16.320]  and for them to go to jail I can't believe it you know this is this is a
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:21.280]  guy who we have police records on he could be taken down and put in jail at
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:26.600]  any time any time and yet it's not done this is I mean we really need the
[1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:33.400]  brotherhood is the police sat in there what's wrong with Satan that's their
[1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:40.040]  loving mass we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen stay with us the
[1:08:40.040 --> 1:09:00.960]  transmission continuous everybody knows that today's loaded everybody rolls with
[1:09:00.960 --> 1:09:10.600]  their fingers crossed everybody knows the war is over everybody knows the good
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:20.040]  guys lost everybody knows the fight was fixed the poor stay poor the rich get
[1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:33.160]  rich that's how it goes everybody by way of deception everybody knows that that's
[1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:38.280]  what this criminal government's about it's here to extract as much wealth and
[1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:43.640]  labor out of us the cattle they can and then when their new robotic factories
[1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:51.560]  robotic aircraft drones the elites say very soon they won't need us anymore

[1:13:42.360 --> 1:13:50.320]  zero four make no mistake if we don't warn people about the FEMA camps if we
[1:13:50.320 --> 1:13:54.480]  don't warn the general population about the military's training to take our
[1:13:54.480 --> 1:13:58.080]  guns break up our families and put us in camps on video and we have the
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:04.800]  documents if we don't ring the alarm bells they will succeed this is the slow
[1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:14.480]  slide now hastening now coming to a gallop and soon full rushing drive towards
[1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:20.520]  war and increased tyranny I mean the government didn't go for broken start
[1:14:20.520 --> 1:14:26.280]  breaking all laws for no reason in the last 15 years spending tens of
[1:14:26.280 --> 1:14:30.080]  billions a year to buy off reporters and put on fake a newscast I mean that's
[1:14:30.080 --> 1:14:35.520]  admitted people say something this big would be exposed it has been the
[1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:40.400]  criminal government didn't go for broke and decide to put cancer viruses and
[1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:48.720]  vaccines now killing one in three instead of one in 33 the old cancer rate
[1:14:48.720 --> 1:14:55.920]  they didn't decide to and knowingly they knew this 50 years ago to give people
[1:14:55.920 --> 1:15:00.360]  diabetes by attacking their pancreas with the vaccines they didn't decide to
[1:15:00.360 --> 1:15:05.880]  sterilize 500 plus thousand American women and a whole Indian tribes they
[1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:11.560]  didn't decide to do that for no reason to give up or back off and so you can
[1:15:11.560 --> 1:15:15.240]  hope it's gonna go away but it isn't gonna go away until you get angry and get
[1:15:15.240 --> 1:15:20.840]  fired up and get focused and get informed and to decide to not care if
[1:15:20.840 --> 1:15:24.400]  you're cowardly stupid neighbors laugh at you or if your boss does your employees
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:27.520]  do but to give them the facts to give them the information to let them know
[1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:32.400]  they're in great peril but the good news is we always knew this things get
[1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:36.040]  worse and worse a lot of people heard us warn them in the past and laugh they're
[1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:46.200]  not laughing now they're not laughing a lot of cops out there have got a brother
[1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:51.280]  or sister or a child of theirs who was just fine running around the house so
[1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:55.040]  they got that third round of shots now they're in the corner crapping their
[1:15:55.040 --> 1:16:04.440]  pants that'll wake you up real fast I'd much rather not have that happen and have
[1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:08.960]  people wake up to the facts and the studies but you know what we go in the
[1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:14.280]  air a year plus ago and said the HPV is killing women in the trials it's causing
[1:16:14.280 --> 1:16:18.360]  them to have all these horrible autoimmune problems and then and then a
[1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:26.640]  year later people are dropping dead left and right and what's the BBC do they
[1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:29.360]  come out with a big article Steve Watson's written a story about this in
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:34.160]  info wars net saying oh there's internet rumors like the Hadron supercollider was
[1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:38.600]  going to destroy the earth last week we didn't say that we said top scientists
[1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:43.760]  and physicists say it has the potential to create thermal nuclear explosions
[1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:51.000]  antimatter reactions strangelets neutral particles that could silently fall to the
[1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:54.440]  center of the earth and then begin building 40 something years later
[1:16:54.440 --> 1:16:58.800]  destroying the planet you know people with 1900 technology that's when the
[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:04.560]  equations were done by max plank and others design the a bomb a hundred years
[1:17:04.560 --> 1:17:13.680]  ago and now they're doing things even more dangerous and all we're saying it
[1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:17.600]  should be investigated environmental assessment should be done but no no no
[1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:21.800]  the environmental assessments only on what you exhale that's a toxic waste
[1:17:21.800 --> 1:17:26.320]  we're going to tax you we're gonna run uranium and plutonium together at high
[1:17:26.320 --> 1:17:32.680]  speeds fired through particle beams we're gonna do whatever we want whenever
[1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:36.080]  we want and and and now they come out and say oh and also there's all this
[1:17:36.080 --> 1:17:39.880]  disinfo about vaccines people aren't taking the vaccines anymore they're not
[1:17:39.880 --> 1:17:45.920]  listening to the government well whatever you think about vaccines it's a
[1:17:45.920 --> 1:17:49.360]  fact that in England in the United States and Australia and New Zealand we
[1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:54.960]  all have the same vaccine same color of law garbage there's no law to take shots
[1:17:54.960 --> 1:18:00.640]  but the media says it's the law you got to take them and thousands of children
[1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:05.440]  show up under color of law every year at individual facilities millions total
[1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:10.680]  with police dogs barking for intimidation this is on national news to be
[1:18:10.680 --> 1:18:17.480]  shot up thinking it's the law that's a criminal rogue government think about
[1:18:17.480 --> 1:18:26.840]  that they they lie and say it's the law what's not think about the hoaxes all
[1:18:26.840 --> 1:18:29.800]  right I'm gonna shut up and take your calls Ben in Virginia you're on the
[1:18:29.800 --> 1:18:38.600]  air so we just went to Ben okay Jerry in California go ahead hi Alex we love
[1:18:38.600 --> 1:18:43.480]  your show out here and I do have I do have to take issue with you on three or
[1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:49.760]  four points I've been listening for years I can't get enough of your DVDs or
[1:18:49.760 --> 1:18:52.960]  anything brother we love you to you don't have to preface that I do a lot of
[1:18:52.960 --> 1:18:58.920]  stuff that's wrong tell me tell me how I'm wrong okay first of all we're in a
[1:18:58.920 --> 1:19:05.400]  world war and to fight a world war you're gonna need massive funds and we
[1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:10.440]  need a plan somehow if we put our heads together you've got a massive army out
[1:19:10.440 --> 1:19:15.320]  there in four warriors and we need a plan somehow to perform some kind of
[1:19:15.320 --> 1:19:20.520]  organization I would think instead of everybody running around like chickens
[1:19:20.520 --> 1:19:25.240]  with their heads cut off you know we need to what we've got massive numbers
[1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:30.520]  there's got to be some way by God or the will of God or somebody that we can
[1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:35.960]  organize each other and get some kind of organization going on because I've been
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:40.600]  listening to your show for a lot of years and the alarm bell is wrong I mean
[1:19:40.600 --> 1:19:44.680]  you've run the alarm and you're ringing it every day and we all hear it and you
[1:19:44.680 --> 1:19:50.280]  speak well we don't stop you we do not all hear it I'm only on 60 something
[1:19:50.280 --> 1:19:53.920]  am an FM stations most of them little bitty but they're great I'm on shortwave
[1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:57.920]  in the internet and we have reached tens of millions of people but that's not
[1:19:57.920 --> 1:20:02.840]  true that's the alarm bell I'm imagine we're here in a giant fortress with a
[1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:07.400]  huge enemy attacking the gates and I've only my voice only goes as far as it
[1:20:07.400 --> 1:20:11.760]  goes so I yell and I yell about a hundred yards down to you and I need you to
[1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:15.400]  yell the next person a hundred yards down to wake the guards all around the
[1:20:15.400 --> 1:20:23.600]  palace or imagine watchtowers along the edge of a mountain to warn a city you
[1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:27.480]  know that's a hundred miles away every ten miles there's a watchtower on the
[1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:31.840]  hill I've lit my watchtower and folks have lit a couple other watchtowers but
[1:20:31.840 --> 1:20:35.480]  we need to light more watchtowers the public doesn't even know the Federal
[1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:38.440]  Reserve's private now now now I understand you're saying we'll never
[1:20:38.440 --> 1:20:43.320]  wake up everybody but but actually like Chilchescu and Romania or other places
[1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:47.400]  if we fully discredit this government and show people just how outrageous its
[1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:54.000]  crimes are and it's lying and it's criminal activities then if the public
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.280]  doesn't support them their system will fall apart but the public does and let
[1:20:58.280 --> 1:21:03.160]  me explain how this works I'll let you finish they staged some terror attacks
[1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:10.320]  in the early 90s mid 90s claim that patriot groups anti-UN groups anti-new
[1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:17.320]  older groups do it hype that up that was to demonize patriots to the police then
[1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:21.320]  to sell the general public on giving up their rights and having a domestic
[1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:26.480]  stasi and a control grid the criminal government stages a huge terror attack on
[1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:31.200]  9-11 to sell the public on acquiescing control and total federalization and
[1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:34.080]  having North com take over all the federal agencies through homeland
[1:21:34.080 --> 1:21:38.480]  security military runs your local police departments everything they just have
[1:21:38.480 --> 1:21:42.440]  plainclothes liaison officers major media there's only a few pockets they
[1:21:42.440 --> 1:21:46.560]  don't control they're trying to consolidate fast this is a race ladies and
[1:21:46.560 --> 1:21:52.040]  gentlemen and now they've rolled out that it's al-qaeda so the average good old
[1:21:52.040 --> 1:21:57.480]  boy sitting around in his house right now going yeah bush ain't perfect but
[1:21:57.480 --> 1:22:01.880]  he's fighting al-qaeda and we got to give up all our rights and not have any
[1:22:01.880 --> 1:22:06.240]  fourth amendment or al-qaeda is going to hit us again then and then they switch
[1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:11.680]  over to okay now al-qaeda's blonde-haired blue-eyed and gun owners are
[1:22:11.680 --> 1:22:17.360]  associated with al-qaeda and so now they got everybody it's not everybody but
[1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:20.000]  large portion to accept it now they're saying it's blonde-haired blue-eyed
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:24.080]  al-qaeda there's tens of thousands of them they're everywhere all crime is
[1:22:24.080 --> 1:22:30.800]  terrorism and so they're now shifting into that face and we've got to discredit
[1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:34.880]  them like our lives depend on it military and police have got to say no to
[1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:38.600]  these unlawful orders police have got to talk after they're called into these
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:42.200]  meeting rooms and brainwashed about you've got to meet privately and talk and
[1:22:42.200 --> 1:22:45.920]  don't the feds have got spies in your departments I mean this is not a joke
[1:22:45.920 --> 1:22:50.920]  ladies and gentlemen these people are hardcore killers and I don't just mean
[1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:55.240]  killing 3,000 on 9-11 that's nothing compared to again a million plus
[1:22:55.240 --> 1:22:59.280]  ampoules of factor 8 killing every single person that was given it by Bayer
[1:22:59.280 --> 1:23:05.240]  they do this stuff on purpose they like it and every one of us they're going to
[1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:07.960]  use the military they're going to use the police they're going to use all of us
[1:23:07.960 --> 1:23:12.800]  we are all going to be losers if we don't say no to this but we haven't
[1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:17.360]  finished our work on waking people up instead most people in our movement I'd
[1:23:17.360 --> 1:23:21.400]  say about half of them spend their time setting up a group saying we're the
[1:23:21.400 --> 1:23:26.000]  national organization follow us forward or you know this group will have the
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:31.400]  secret plan to take everything back and a silver bullet the silver bullet is a
[1:23:31.400 --> 1:23:35.440]  mass awakening the silver bullet is individuals being leaders and starting
[1:23:35.440 --> 1:23:41.440]  their own smaller organizations that are active and become larger that can't be
[1:23:41.440 --> 1:23:45.040]  stopped I mean I've had a million people tell me you've got to organize a march on
[1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:48.040]  Washington and that will show them let's say we had a million person peaceful
[1:23:48.040 --> 1:23:53.000]  march they would ignore it in the media or they would demonize it they just hire
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:23:56.640]  the Ku Klux Klan to show up be part of the rally and say look the Klan had a
[1:23:56.640 --> 1:23:59.920]  million people rally basically is what they do that they show some toothless
[1:23:59.920 --> 1:24:03.360]  clan feds you know with some ne'er-do-wells following and they didn't know
[1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:08.040]  they're handled by feds provocateurs patsy's up front they do something like
[1:24:08.040 --> 1:24:13.360]  that or they have a car bomb go off or some mentally ill 19-year-old kid who
[1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:17.000]  just got out of a mental institution with a federal handler would throw them all
[1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:21.880]  off cocktail at cops then they grab me and say that I was the commander of it
[1:24:21.880 --> 1:24:27.120]  they just did that up at the RNC to the innocent news people but let's say we
[1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:31.920]  had 10 million March on Washington and we took Washington they just detonated
[1:24:31.920 --> 1:24:37.000]  neutron bomb they'd say al-qaeda did it it would kill the Congress kill the 10
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.440]  million people that marched up there then they declared martial law but they
[1:24:40.440 --> 1:24:45.880]  can't stop you taking over your county taking over your city getting involved
[1:24:45.880 --> 1:24:50.120]  in politics saying no educating people at the grass roots there's no way to
[1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:55.240]  attack that no way to stop that no way for them to deal with that you
[1:24:55.240 --> 1:25:00.200]  understand there is no way if they try to march on the people and take a few
[1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:05.240]  cities first the FEMA camps then the public resists that in a symmetrical
[1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:10.720]  way physically or even non-violently there is nothing they can do you know
[1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:14.440]  what a group of riot cops would do going and rounding people up if one
[1:25:14.440 --> 1:25:18.200]  person engaged them and knew how to use a firearm they would run for the hills
[1:25:18.200 --> 1:25:22.120]  and regroup and then get mad and go burn down some neighborhoods just to act
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:27.520]  tough okay they are cowards they are nothing they can do nothing we don't
[1:25:27.520 --> 1:25:32.120]  want a war though with these cowardly people we want to deprogram them so they
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:35.600]  can be real men and women we want to have them join the battle for the
[1:25:35.600 --> 1:25:39.840]  republic we don't want wars we don't want physical confrontation but that
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:43.040]  matter they're gonna draw first blood they're gonna keep pushing and it's
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:48.080]  gonna start just like in 1775 or if you want to use a Hollywood example just like
[1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:52.600]  V for vendetta when they shoot a little girl in the back the domino's gonna get
[1:25:52.600 --> 1:25:56.840]  flicked and then it's gonna be hell on earth but the globalists may activate
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:00.560]  the little the Metula rasa brigades first to burn down the country they
[1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:02.760]  don't care about burning the country down brother
[1:26:02.760 --> 1:26:07.200]  they want to bring in a breakdown of society so they can then bring in their
[1:26:07.200 --> 1:26:11.760]  national security apparatus north com's gonna sit back in their bunkers and let
[1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:16.840]  the patriots chew up the local police departments we don't want that then
[1:26:16.840 --> 1:26:21.520]  they'll bring in the eye for international force anything else yeah
[1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:26.160]  Alex we're already in a world war whether we choose to accept it or not
[1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:30.000]  whether we want a war or not is irrelevant I think oh you I don't know
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:35.840]  what that means listen here's the deal people talk about these big glistening
[1:26:35.840 --> 1:26:42.840]  national organization you don't understand sir the attack pattern here
[1:26:42.840 --> 1:26:49.080]  okay the attack pattern is grassroots that will bring them down
[1:26:49.080 --> 1:26:59.080]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:27:00.080 --> 1:27:03.080]  okay
[1:27:06.440 --> 1:27:14.680]  talking to Jerry in California Army okay Jerry instead of me arguing with you
[1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:21.240]  what is your point I only disagreed with you on three or four points I agree
[1:27:21.240 --> 1:27:27.960]  with most of the things you say however you've got a lot of friends in the
[1:27:27.960 --> 1:27:33.640]  military ex-curtles ex-generals ex-admirals I wonder if they would
[1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:41.120]  have any advice for us if there be any chance of us having any kind of even
[1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:49.640]  legal or or any kind of military legal leadership as far as fighting a world
[1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:54.920]  war I don't know the first thing about war but I know that world war what are
[1:27:54.920 --> 1:27:59.640]  you talking about well you know we're like that we're a water Alex whether we
[1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:05.200]  wanted or not well the government is criminal and legitimate and is waging
[1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:08.400]  war on us let me just stop you I don't know a lot of generals and colonels and
[1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:14.160]  animals I know some the point is you see Fox Fallon saying he's not gonna be part
[1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:18.040]  of stuff and stepping down you see all these generals quitting and leaving and
[1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:21.520]  they're not even angels they just don't want to be part of the criminality or
[1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:25.200]  part of attacking our own ships and blaming it on Iran that's why he really
[1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:30.840]  left so you know that's the bottom line there is that that's good that's
[1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:36.840]  probably would stop the Iran attack so far and so again that's education
[1:28:36.840 --> 1:28:43.520]  jumping ship I don't really understand you can you speak up yeah if all the
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:47.480]  good generals and all the good admirals jump ship that leaves all the bad ones
[1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:52.080]  who run the show why don't we list the good ones to help us to organize well
[1:28:52.080 --> 1:28:56.720]  you say some legal way of removing the criminal government the criminal
[1:28:56.720 --> 1:29:00.840]  government doesn't make doesn't care about legal they have dumbed down people
[1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:04.720]  that like to act tough that watch GI Joe when they're growing up that shove
[1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:09.000]  women around now they wear black uniforms and put in their helmets with
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:16.160]  skulls so so go ahead why are we always quoting law to claim how we can fight
[1:29:16.160 --> 1:29:19.760]  the new world order not not you just said sir you just said is there some
[1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:25.840]  legal way yeah another was a lawful way for for a military man with the
[1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:30.600]  experience and the and the skill to know how to tell us what to do to fight
[1:29:30.600 --> 1:29:38.280]  these guys yeah well listen I appreciate your call there's a lot of people I'm
[1:29:38.280 --> 1:29:42.760]  not saying you're doing this who always call for violence or just say you need
[1:29:42.760 --> 1:29:46.160]  to go start a war Alex you just start shooting but then they themselves never
[1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:54.640]  start shitting and I've seen so many of these guys get busted get killed go to
[1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:57.880]  prison and then they just can't believe it when they go to prison they can't
[1:29:57.880 --> 1:30:03.880]  believe when they get shot and they just suddenly say I never called for that I
[1:30:03.880 --> 1:30:13.480]  never wanted that when they did we are a bankrupt country our problem isn't just
[1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:19.720]  the criminal elite we are a slovenly dumbed down arrogant know-it-all baby
[1:30:19.720 --> 1:30:24.880]  killing nation I mean imagine if the government lined up 50 million people
[1:30:24.880 --> 1:30:31.680]  and killed them well we did that with abortion and people lie and rationalize
[1:30:31.680 --> 1:30:36.400]  and say they're not people they're not humans but now we euthanize our old
[1:30:36.400 --> 1:30:39.040]  people going on everywhere the public just isn't aware of it because they're
[1:30:39.040 --> 1:30:45.960]  idiots uninformed fools and now the public's being euthanized and being
[1:30:45.960 --> 1:30:50.920]  sterilized with the GMO foods and the vaccines and the sprays and the drugs in
[1:30:50.920 --> 1:30:57.960]  the water I mean you don't think what comes around goes around you reap what
[1:30:57.960 --> 1:31:03.840]  you sow what's good for the goose good for the gander you really think we're
[1:31:03.840 --> 1:31:09.440]  gonna kill our old people and kill our new unborn the daughters visit doctors
[1:31:09.440 --> 1:31:17.840]  so their children won't be born we send our sons and daughters far and shores
[1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:25.080]  fighting other people's wars we send our daughters the doctors their children
[1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:27.640]  won't be born
[1:31:31.080 --> 1:31:38.840]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:31:38.840 --> 1:31:46.400]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:31:46.400 --> 1:31:54.560]  Alex Jones you know there's a lot of people who dream big dreams they're
[1:31:54.560 --> 1:32:02.120]  gonna create a new automobile they're gonna have a big hamburger chain they're
[1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:06.200]  gonna come up with a new widget a lot of times they do but they never put it into
[1:32:06.200 --> 1:32:13.280]  function they never put it into play they never put it into development you
[1:32:13.280 --> 1:32:17.680]  want to bring the new order down start plastering handmills all over your town
[1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:25.440]  one hour a day with a bucket of glue and a paintbrush or a staple gun saying 9
[1:32:25.440 --> 1:32:31.520]  11's an inside job info wash dot com or whatever website you like tribe you've
[1:32:31.520 --> 1:32:36.080]  got the means making a hundred copies a week of say in-game or terror storm
[1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:40.560]  giving those two people try going on message boards and educating people
[1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:44.960]  every day an hour a day try virally spreading videos try calling in the
[1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:54.480]  radio talk shows or bullhorning live radio events try randomly following
[1:32:54.480 --> 1:32:59.000]  corrupt judges peacefully you know we have a little website name or something
[1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:02.680]  so you're press follow them and nine times out of ten they're gonna be
[1:33:02.680 --> 1:33:09.360]  committing crimes and they're off off off the bench time you know put them on
[1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:16.240]  the web cheating on their wife put them on the web buying drugs these people are
[1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:22.840]  crooks all you gotta do I mean I've been out of the legislature maybe 15 times
[1:33:22.840 --> 1:33:28.080]  as a citizen lobbyist and every time we catch bribery or corruption it makes the
[1:33:28.080 --> 1:33:32.880]  newspaper I mean it's just the crime is in the streets the crime is in the
[1:33:32.880 --> 1:33:39.320]  uniforms the crime is everywhere it's all selectively enforced and if we just
[1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:45.280]  come out of our holes and and take over our cities peacefully we'll be able to
[1:33:45.280 --> 1:33:49.280]  make it through this depression that's coming and if the people that are aware
[1:33:49.280 --> 1:33:52.760]  of the new world order get prepared get geared up for whatever's coming down
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:56.520]  the road we'll be able to be the people that are respected and looked up to as
[1:33:56.520 --> 1:34:01.320]  the times get darker let's talk to sherry in Texas then Erica Karen Mike and
[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:06.480]  John sherry you're on the air thanks for holding I'm pretty good talking to
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:11.320]  you okay well I just want to say you guys are doing an excellent job I know
[1:34:11.320 --> 1:34:15.360]  it's really hard to cover all their tyranny and educate people at the same
[1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:19.520]  time when you're short staff the way you are I've been making copies of end game
[1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:23.680]  and truth rising and I actually I didn't know how it's gonna work out but I went
[1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:29.080]  down to the corner store where all the residents here go to and I just started
[1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:32.600]  handing out these because you know I didn't know what else to do now it's
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:37.560]  called action and that that scares the new world order to death that is called
[1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:44.400]  their their doom yeah and I really I got a really good response actually because
[1:34:44.400 --> 1:34:50.600]  it's amazing how powerful a mother can be when she finds out that someone's
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:54.720]  trying to poison her kid absolutely they went like a mother there with their
[1:34:54.720 --> 1:35:00.080]  baby there you know exactly the message baby he's gonna come after you I wanted
[1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:05.000]  to make two points my dad and my stepmom and their kids were in the
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:09.280]  hurricane situation and I wanted to confirm what that gentleman was saying
[1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:13.400]  earlier the mainstream media what they're doing is they're shaping the
[1:35:13.400 --> 1:35:19.520]  coverage to blame the victim as far as like Galveston and Houston yeah there
[1:35:19.520 --> 1:35:23.160]  are a lot of old people and stuff that don't have any money don't have a car
[1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:26.880]  and they're saying move to a shelter in another part of the state for a month
[1:35:26.880 --> 1:35:31.280]  let your dogs die let people loot you everything you've got yeah and and
[1:35:31.280 --> 1:35:36.600]  basically what they don't understand is that my they actually told my dad and my
[1:35:36.600 --> 1:35:41.720]  stepmom not to evacuate because they didn't want a freeway panic like they
[1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:45.880]  did a few years ago and that's what a lot of people don't realize and then they
[1:35:45.880 --> 1:35:51.400]  talked trash about them and the public sits there you know in imaginary
[1:35:51.400 --> 1:35:55.640]  psychology like they're with the anchor I sat around with family this weekend
[1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:59.240]  while they would talk bad about some of them they would go look at those dumb
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:02.880]  people won't leave oh look at them what's their problem and that's creating a
[1:36:02.880 --> 1:36:07.760]  sick relationship between the people and FEMA yeah and I was gonna ask you a
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:11.240]  question do you think they'd be sick enough to hold out the food and water
[1:36:11.240 --> 1:36:16.400]  long enough to be able to trade it say for like guns like a peaceful gun
[1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:20.520]  confiscation oh they always do that and that's what they did in New Orleans yeah
[1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:26.160]  okay well anything else you want to add sherry no I just wanted to add that no
[1:36:26.160 --> 1:36:33.040]  stay there stay there he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN
[1:36:33.040 --> 1:36:36.000]  radio network
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:47.680]  I'm the time between the ocean spring Atlantis and the rise of the Sons of
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:53.840]  Arius there was a time of great adventure
[1:36:53.840 --> 1:37:04.040]  I think how many civilizations have come and gone not just lives but whole
[1:37:04.040 --> 1:37:11.560]  family names and all the adventure all the sorrow all the hardships that our
[1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:14.720]  species has gone through to bring us to where we are now and now a
[1:37:14.720 --> 1:37:22.680]  technocracy a willful technocracy is taking over our society a scientific
[1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:30.160]  elite that understands almost sapien sapien activities mindset what what
[1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:35.080]  makes us tick what what drives us and they understand it in the public doesn't
[1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:39.680]  and so they play games with us and so in a way you you do have this subspecies of
[1:37:39.680 --> 1:37:47.120]  man that understands how man operates and who is conscious of that and you have
[1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:51.400]  them right beside their fellow man who has the capability to become conscious
[1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:57.320]  of their surroundings and society but just can't do it and so they are
[1:37:57.320 --> 1:38:03.560]  enslaved and they are hurt badly sherry what was the other point yeah I just
[1:38:03.560 --> 1:38:08.440]  wanted to also point out that my stepmother has epilepsy so bad she
[1:38:08.440 --> 1:38:14.640]  started having seizures two nights ago and the next day they you know my dad
[1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:17.600]  just decided we're gonna we gotta get out of here they're not helping us with
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:21.720]  you know with medical care like they said they would and my little sister I
[1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:26.480]  already woke her up several several months ago and she said you know that
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:30.280]  I think this is another Katrina we gotta get out of here and the first the
[1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:34.520]  first female worker that they that they came across said basically get back in
[1:38:34.520 --> 1:38:38.960]  your cage please you know like go back to your house and shut up you know we
[1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:42.280]  don't want to hear you and so you know they went back in our house and then they
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:44.840]  waited a while and they came out and the next one was actually you know
[1:38:44.840 --> 1:38:47.880]  sympathetic because she was you know almost having full-blown seizures by
[1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:55.520]  then and actually gave them an evacue an evacue lane that they could go to but
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:39:00.320]  you know do you think maybe they were thinking that people would react like
[1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:04.880]  they didn't can treat Katrina and they didn't and they're mad about that well
[1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:07.840]  the average female workers compartmentalized another head from a
[1:39:07.840 --> 1:39:13.480]  hole in the ground it's just that health and human services has a rear
[1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:18.000]  admiral running I mean the military is being put in everywhere you can see the
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.920]  military dictatorship right in front of your eyes it's hidden in plain view
[1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:26.840]  sherry good to hear from you Erica in Arizona you're on the air
[1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:33.400]  I wanted to get a hold of Elaine Brown because I hadn't heard anything about her
[1:39:33.400 --> 1:39:37.680]  in a while and the one I know I hadn't forgotten about her but I was horrified
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:44.560]  to learn that she was just recently moved to car as well in Texas
[1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:53.040]  do you hello yes I'm listening to you I'm sorry and because that is the prison
[1:39:53.040 --> 1:39:58.920]  where Susan Lindow was just released from and she reported that women that
[1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:04.760]  were being chemically lobotomized and Elaine Brown is currently under 24 hour
[1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:12.440]  lockdown so I'm very concerned I would hope that maybe if a lot of people try to
[1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:19.680]  contact her and give her best wishes they would maybe back off well Edna
[1:40:19.680 --> 1:40:24.400]  Lane Brown are being chemically lobotomized that's what they do and
[1:40:24.400 --> 1:40:28.680]  most people in prisons who are quote political prisoners and I have heard
[1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:32.160]  there's been some forced medication months ago now there have been famous
[1:40:32.160 --> 1:40:40.960]  cases of one doctor in St. Louis Charles T. Sell for some reason that they did a
[1:40:40.960 --> 1:40:45.400]  sting on him and an undercover BATF went to the shooting range with him and said
[1:40:45.400 --> 1:40:50.800]  wouldn't it be nice to shoot of the president and he just joked around and
[1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:53.720]  said yeah that'd be great well they without a judge without a jury he's
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:59.880]  never been tried never went to court he was put in a federal prison and it's
[1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:04.880]  what 12 years now and they gave him anti-psychotic drugs and the man can't
[1:41:04.880 --> 1:41:09.240]  talk he's been seen by family a few times and he can't talk he just drools
[1:41:09.240 --> 1:41:14.600]  and that's like the old Soviet Union and you're just taken to a subterranean pit
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:20.520]  you're just locked up in a dark room and then they just lobotomize you and
[1:41:20.520 --> 1:41:28.440]  that's what they do so God help her I mean look we kill 50 million of babies
[1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:34.080]  this evil culture euthanizes old people of course they chain women up in rooms
[1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:38.520]  and drug them I hope that's not happening to her right now but we'll
[1:41:38.520 --> 1:41:48.560]  try to look into that right to her at PO Box 27137 in Fort Worth Texas with the
[1:41:48.560 --> 1:41:57.400]  registration number 03924-049 Elaine Brown okay anything else well I hope you
[1:41:57.400 --> 1:42:04.320]  can get up to the window on because she was arrested because she went to John
[1:42:04.320 --> 1:42:11.000]  McCain's office to ask him to speak to Congress because he knew she had worked
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:15.760]  with the Iraqis to on every point they used to take us to war she had a
[1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:20.360]  solution which would prevent the need to go to war she demanded to talk to
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:25.600]  Congress and after she went to John McCain's office a few days before she
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:30.480]  was arrested no charges and sent to Congress well for psychological you know
[1:42:30.480 --> 1:42:35.680]  I know they do that I appreciate your call you know I have to bow out of
[1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:45.920]  certain things the Edna Lane Brown situation I heard people talking about
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:53.000]  how they were shooting into the woods when anybody moved around in them you
[1:42:53.000 --> 1:42:56.040]  invite people to your house and say let's have parties but then you shoot
[1:42:56.040 --> 1:43:01.000]  into the woods there were houses are running well houses in the area what if
[1:43:01.000 --> 1:43:06.680]  somebody was walking their dog what if what if somebody was walking off the
[1:43:06.680 --> 1:43:14.200]  road what if somebody was walking in who was a supporter and I'd be I'd tried to
[1:43:14.200 --> 1:43:24.640]  deescalate things I had tried to find a peaceful solution as best I could to
[1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:28.520]  that but you know they don't have to follow my advice I'm not angry with
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:34.200]  them I then just heard about rock concerts there and parties and bring the
[1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:38.680]  whole family and I said listen their feds can move in there any minute that's
[1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:43.000]  fine for adults to go in there but don't bring children there and then I was the
[1:43:43.000 --> 1:43:49.440]  big fat fed oh Alex doesn't want us to shoot randomly into the woods if we see
[1:43:49.440 --> 1:43:57.840]  movement Alex says children shouldn't go there and it's not a party atmosphere
[1:43:57.840 --> 1:44:03.560]  with a surrounded house with feds who got into their line of business because
[1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:12.080]  they like to kill people they like power they like money there might have been a
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:15.840]  time when the government wasn't totally corrupt but the federal agencies are
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:20.800]  very corrupt now the federal marshals the FBI very dangerous people BATF and
[1:44:20.800 --> 1:44:31.400]  the former regulators the Revenuers from the whiskey tax rebellions and I told
[1:44:31.400 --> 1:44:37.040]  people I said if I was you I'd stay away from there because the feds are
[1:44:37.040 --> 1:44:43.800]  saying they are going to investigate and arrest anybody that goes there I mean
[1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:50.200]  this isn't this isn't the alamos last stand custard glass stand I mean the
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:53.480]  bed in the lane brown we're really gonna do that I said on air they better lock
[1:44:53.480 --> 1:45:01.520]  that place down kick everybody out of there and prepare for a showdown and
[1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:06.160]  then the feds might have done what they did with the grays in Texas as soon as
[1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:12.760]  that didn't get any media attention they just left him alone but no it was a big
[1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:17.840]  party atmosphere and escalation and challenging and name-calling and
[1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:23.920]  flapping a red flag in front of a in front of a bowl and so their little
[1:45:23.920 --> 1:45:29.440]  buddies came in to give them security check it that's what the feds do I've
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:34.240]  had the feds probably 50 times show up at events at my office and you're in a lot
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:39.520]  of danger you need weapons you want some weapons I was at the DNC and somebody
[1:45:39.520 --> 1:45:43.400]  was like you want security you want weapons I was like no I don't want
[1:45:43.400 --> 1:45:47.360]  weapons of are you kidding you you go anywhere downtown with a weapon they're
[1:45:47.360 --> 1:45:50.680]  gonna grab you and take it a prison saying you were gonna go after McCain or
[1:45:50.680 --> 1:45:55.680]  somebody oh I I just mean you know do you need a firearm to protect yourself and
[1:45:55.680 --> 1:46:05.960]  I said no I don't of course it was feds I mean it's always the same but I know
[1:46:05.960 --> 1:46:12.840]  Ed and Lee Brown they had it all figured out they knew what to do but they
[1:46:12.840 --> 1:46:19.200]  didn't and then Brown was saying oh I'm taking down basically you know
[1:46:19.200 --> 1:46:28.040]  assassinations are gonna begin but of course everybody that was saying that
[1:46:28.040 --> 1:46:31.080]  was either feds provocaturing that state which we know they were feeding
[1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:35.080]  dead in Lane Brown and then anybody who was dumb enough to ever then become a
[1:46:35.080 --> 1:46:38.560]  real confidant of them and shoot their mouth off with them got grabbed and
[1:46:38.560 --> 1:46:45.280]  taken to prison too on trumped-up charges I mean this government takes a
[1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:49.080]  million plus little kids and a lot of them get put little cages and fed maybe
[1:46:49.080 --> 1:46:52.320]  a hot dog a day till they starve to death and they they do lobotomies and
[1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:55.920]  chemical and biological testing on them and they ready little kids to death you
[1:46:55.920 --> 1:47:01.720]  think they care about you you think these murdering criminals that run
[1:47:01.720 --> 1:47:12.000]  things care for one minute and the feds psychological warfare experts assessed
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:16.800]  all those people and knew none of it was real it was macho talk it was coming of
[1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:23.040]  age people thumping their chest feeling manly and that gets a bunch of people
[1:47:23.040 --> 1:47:25.680]  sent to prison
[1:47:35.680 --> 1:47:41.400]  don't let FEMA take you and your family to a camp and you have to make that
[1:47:41.400 --> 1:47:47.880]  decision of how you're gonna stop that at the time just remember the trash the
[1:47:47.880 --> 1:47:52.920]  dumb down nobody's the wimps the people that want to have a coming of age to be
[1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:58.480]  manly who love those uniforms who revel in the archetypal imagery the type of
[1:47:58.480 --> 1:48:02.320]  scum that would come to a house and take a family to a FEMA camp they're not
[1:48:02.320 --> 1:48:08.080]  even worth bullets it's like stomping on dog crap out on your front porch you
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:11.760]  want to just scrape it up and move it out of the way it doesn't hurt the new
[1:48:11.760 --> 1:48:18.640]  world order to put bullets in those people and so you don't want to put
[1:48:18.640 --> 1:48:23.600]  bullets in them unless you absolutely have to we'll be right back with more
[1:48:23.600 --> 1:48:53.520]  your thoughts the public large portions
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:58.720]  of them come home from work to go on and turn on the television they have no
[1:48:58.720 --> 1:49:04.720]  idea what's really going on around them gonna take away their zombies and it's
[1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:14.120]  our job to go in and shake those zombies awake and they grew me full life out of
[1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:23.320]  the coma they're in and I know I guess cynical and nasty and mean because it
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:29.240]  really freaks me out the truth is I'm a big softy I care about everybody and I
[1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:37.080]  just can't believe how disgusting and sick the society is I know it's hard on
[1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:42.240]  families it's hard on police it's hard on firefighters just everything's a big
[1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:46.840]  mess I don't even blame the government mid-level low-level like I used to
[1:49:46.840 --> 1:49:51.960]  because I realized they're just brain dead to people don't have enough
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:57.280]  sophistication to study how societies and things operate let's go ahead and
[1:49:57.280 --> 1:50:05.200]  go to John in Missouri right go ahead you're on the air John

[1:50:26.400 --> 1:50:33.040]  there in Kansas City and I don't know whether you know it or not but you guys
[1:50:33.040 --> 1:50:38.720]  somehow you need to mend some fences with that radio station I don't know
[1:50:38.720 --> 1:50:41.880]  anything about it there's always well I have to mend fences with it I don't even
[1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:48.040]  really know very well well okay well I'll just try to make it brief here they
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:55.480]  preempt your show a lot okay they only they only they only they only showed or
[1:50:55.480 --> 1:50:59.840]  they only broadcast two hours of your three-hour show anyway but they preempt
[1:50:59.840 --> 1:51:06.440]  you a lot and and they have to say the least to be kind they've been spreading
[1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:13.080]  inaccuracies about some of the things about you they've been they they've talked
[1:51:13.080 --> 1:51:20.720]  about somehow your family having big oil money and well true well I heard you

[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:34.160]  industry right all different let you know levels up because that's big I mean

[1:51:48.160 --> 1:51:53.680]  sorts of talk show hosts that I have debated on that station alone I mean
[1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:58.000]  probably I don't know I probably debated like eight nine ten probably more than
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:02.280]  that different talk show hosts locally they've had on who bash me and attack me
[1:52:02.280 --> 1:52:10.200]  and I don't care as long as an affiliate carries my show that's fine and of
[1:52:10.200 --> 1:52:15.120]  course you know people are gonna say things and do things and do what they
[1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:21.560]  want I don't care it isn't about Alex Jones I mean people say I'm a
[1:52:21.560 --> 1:52:25.440]  Scientologist because there's a Scientologist named Alex Jones is 60

[1:53:10.280 --> 1:53:21.800]  bottom line bottom line there's I don't know what I can say or what I can do to
[1:53:21.800 --> 1:53:27.560]  I mean people are obsessed with me people are obsessed with me and I do get
[1:53:27.560 --> 1:53:30.920]  calls by different hosts on that station saying things about me and doing
[1:53:30.920 --> 1:53:37.960]  stuff and there's a lot of resentment by a lot of people out there for me because
[1:53:37.960 --> 1:53:46.520]  they imagine things about me but it's this radio show is not about me man
[1:53:46.520 --> 1:53:52.480]  folks major brokerage firms are going under major banks are going under we're
[1:53:52.480 --> 1:53:57.960]  talking about a looming depression and instead of anybody ever being able to
[1:53:57.960 --> 1:54:09.080]  criticize what I say or what I cover or what I do here it is all about me and
[1:54:09.080 --> 1:54:15.160]  how I'm bad okay or what I need to do or what I need to say and I just can't
[1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:28.240]  make everybody happy okay before you slip into unconsciousness I like to have
[1:54:28.240 --> 1:54:53.020]  another kid
[1:54:53.020 --> 1:55:06.780]  Everything that our expert guests have laid out here on the economic front is unfolding
[1:55:06.780 --> 1:55:14.060]  in fact a little bit quicker and more severely than they had even said.
[1:55:14.060 --> 1:55:30.180]  I'm going to have Greg Pound pop back in, famous case of a child kidnapping by the government
[1:55:30.180 --> 1:55:35.540]  down there, CPS were convicted of lying, a neighbor's dog just bit the child's hand
[1:55:35.540 --> 1:55:38.580]  and they said well that's negligent, let the neighbor's dog bite your child, see normal
[1:55:38.580 --> 1:55:46.580]  accidents are now criminal, took their children, four of them, his wife got pregnant again,
[1:55:46.580 --> 1:55:52.740]  they're trying to take baby Moses, that's what they named little boy, well he's got
[1:55:52.740 --> 1:55:57.620]  some people he knows, they just took their children, Florida's the worst we found, anybody
[1:55:57.620 --> 1:56:02.300]  lives there I don't know, but nice state, very pretty, she's just got a bunch of mind
[1:56:02.300 --> 1:56:07.260]  numb people not knowing the evil of the states going on all around them and I shy away from
[1:56:07.260 --> 1:56:14.420]  these stories, it causes me very deep pain and rages me, makes me angry, you know you
[1:56:14.420 --> 1:56:19.260]  can say whatever you want about this show but we stand up for the little guy, we try
[1:56:19.260 --> 1:56:24.700]  to give people good advice, we try to bring in the best and most informative guest and
[1:56:24.700 --> 1:56:33.740]  we try to warn people and we try to help people and we try to cover issues of substance and
[1:56:33.740 --> 1:56:39.700]  just remember listeners, this is the biggest quote patriot or truth radio show out there
[1:56:39.700 --> 1:56:50.020]  and I have the most popular films out there, overall, my body of work and the most popular
[1:56:50.020 --> 1:56:58.300]  websites in the alternative media, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, infowars.net, jonesreport.com,
[1:56:58.300 --> 1:57:05.900]  earthnews.us, prisonplanet.tv and so we're going to be attacked here, we're going to
[1:57:05.900 --> 1:57:09.980]  be attacked, in fact I'm not afraid of even being killed or being falsely imprisoned,
[1:57:09.980 --> 1:57:15.020]  I'm not even afraid of that, I've had to face it and deal with it, I am afraid though of
[1:57:15.020 --> 1:57:21.060]  not finishing my work and I'm also upset and frustrated with the fact that I'm not as eloquent
[1:57:21.060 --> 1:57:27.100]  or as well behaved as I should be, I get sick of this, I get tired of it, it's so ridiculous
[1:57:27.100 --> 1:57:40.660]  how corrupt things are and that everybody can't see it and it makes my blood boil and
[1:57:40.660 --> 1:57:44.180]  let me cover the financial news for you, recapping and then getting us some other news and we're
[1:57:44.180 --> 1:57:51.620]  going to go to your calls, Lehman Brothers files for bankruptcy, Wall Street Bank Lehman

[1:58:02.020 --> 1:58:07.540]  bankrupt, confidence in the 150 plus year old investment bank, the fourth largest in
[1:58:07.540 --> 1:58:12.140]  the US crumble last week, I've been growing concerns that it's a large portfolio of mortgage
[1:58:12.140 --> 1:58:18.620]  backed assets, see mortgage backed assets, it's not the mortgages, it's that they sold
[1:58:18.620 --> 1:58:27.620]  them and then leverage them out, 10 times 10 times 10 times 10, amid growing concerns
[1:58:27.620 --> 1:58:32.140]  that it's large portfolio of mortgage backed assets was worth far less than it was originally
[1:58:32.140 --> 1:58:39.500]  valued, during the last year Lehman reported billion dollar losses and saw its share price
[1:58:39.500 --> 1:58:52.780]  plummet more than 95 percent, 95 percent, Wall Street awakens to two storied firms

[1:59:02.700 --> 1:59:07.220]  real estate holdings, see that their own the media is only looking at how many of the
[1:59:07.220 --> 1:59:12.580]  houses are defaulted, they're not looking at the how they how they package those debts
[1:59:12.580 --> 1:59:23.100]  and sold them as securities, sold the debt, filed a chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,
[1:59:23.100 --> 1:59:28.260]  Bank of America corporation said it snapped up Merrill Lynch and Co, Inc. in a 50 billion
[1:59:28.260 --> 1:59:32.340]  dollar all stock transaction, the demise of the independent Wall Street institutions came
[1:59:32.340 --> 1:59:38.460]  as a shockwaves from the 14 month old credit crisis, Royal the US financial system, six
[1:59:38.460 --> 1:59:44.820]  months after the collapse of Barrick Stearns, this is like whole cities being blown off
[1:59:44.820 --> 1:59:51.420]  the map financially and the public doesn't even know what this means, I mean this is
[1:59:51.420 --> 1:59:59.420]  so big I should have been talking about it all day nonstop, but it's so old hat here
[1:59:59.420 --> 2:00:05.180]  is all the real assets were moved at the back door on this into infrastructure and commodities
[2:00:05.180 --> 2:00:14.340]  by the elites, they are instituting all of this on paper, we've broken that down, but
[2:00:14.340 --> 2:00:21.700]  the big news here is that people are being left holding the bag, Rogers says dollar to
[2:00:21.700 --> 2:00:28.740]  lose World Reserve status, prisonplanet.com story greenback sinks following news of Lehman
[2:00:28.740 --> 2:00:32.700]  Brothers bankruptcy, see the globalist prop the dollar up but only getting ready for this
[2:00:32.700 --> 2:00:38.300]  plunge so it wouldn't fully devalue, all the greenback plummeting after the news of Lehman
[2:00:38.300 --> 2:00:41.940]  Brothers bankruptcy, top investor Jim Rogers predicts the dollar will lose its status as
[2:00:41.940 --> 2:00:45.900]  the World Reserve currency and is resolved to buy more gold despite the recent fall in
[2:00:45.900 --> 2:00:50.980]  the price of the commodity, Rogers correctly predicted China's re-assurgence as an economic
[2:00:50.980 --> 2:00:55.540]  superpower back in the 80s as well as crude oil surpassing $100 a barrel since the global
[2:00:55.540 --> 2:00:59.140]  economy is in recession that is going to get much worse while inflation will continue
[2:00:59.140 --> 2:01:03.340]  to skyrocket, some countries lie about it but inflation in all countries is going to
[2:01:03.340 --> 2:01:08.460]  get worse, the next decade is going to see a lot more inflation which is not good, Rogers
[2:01:08.460 --> 2:01:15.980]  told the Indian business standard, frequently since the prices of the commodities go up
[2:01:15.980 --> 2:01:21.100]  before the inflation numbers, one can stay ahead of inflation but if you get it wrong
[2:01:21.100 --> 2:01:25.860]  you might do worse so investing in those commodities which are going to go up first
[2:01:25.860 --> 2:01:29.740]  or selecting the right commodities is the key to stay ahead of inflation and make a
[2:01:29.740 --> 2:01:35.180]  lot of money, turning to the dollar, Rogers dismissed the greenback as a flawed currency
[2:01:35.180 --> 2:01:39.140]  that will continue to deteriorate for two to three decades adding that he would seek to
[2:01:39.140 --> 2:01:43.980]  use the dollar's recent roundly as an opportunity to get out of the currency completely, he's
[2:01:43.980 --> 2:01:48.900]  always bashing the dollar so, but that is where the trend goes with the dollar devaluation
[2:01:48.900 --> 2:01:52.060]  I mean they can prop it up for a while but they're printing them like they're going
[2:01:52.060 --> 2:01:56.540]  out of style, I don't want to own any US dollars also I would not urge you to buy US dollars,
[2:01:56.540 --> 2:02:01.820]  the dollar is going to lose its status as a world reserve currency said Rogers, some
[2:02:01.820 --> 2:02:06.900]  OPEC countries have already started and stated that they no longer take dollars like Venezuela
[2:02:06.900 --> 2:02:11.740]  no longer accepts the dollar, other countries are already looking and may be taking a package
[2:02:11.740 --> 2:02:16.300]  of basket of currencies instead of the dollar, I'm not the only one who knows the dollar
[2:02:16.300 --> 2:02:25.420]  is in trouble, anybody who watches TV knows the dollar is in trouble he added, I am trying
[2:02:25.420 --> 2:02:31.140]  and want to buy some gold however, whether this is low in gold, whether this is the low
[2:02:31.140 --> 2:02:36.620]  in gold I have no idea, but if gold goes lower I will add some more, gold is something I
[2:02:36.620 --> 2:02:41.740]  do not plan to sell, gold is something I will give to my children, concluded Rogers, yeah
[2:02:41.740 --> 2:02:46.660]  you look at 50 year chart, 10 year chart it just goes straight up, 100 year chart goes
[2:02:46.660 --> 2:02:55.860]  straight up, oh god, everybody thinks in the last 5 minutes, in the 5 minutes ahead, Wilbur
[2:02:55.860 --> 2:03:01.020]  Ross possibly a thousand banks will close in an exclusive interview with CNBC, Wilbur
[2:03:01.020 --> 2:03:07.060]  Ross chairman and CEO of WL Ross and Co says he sees the possibility as many as a thousand
[2:03:07.060 --> 2:03:11.940]  banks closures in the coming months and this will create opportunities for investors, I
[2:03:11.940 --> 2:03:17.380]  do think a lot of regional ones will just as they did in the last savings alone crisis
[2:03:17.380 --> 2:03:26.420]  in the 1990s go under, Ross says he will be looking to pick up smaller distressed institutions,
[2:03:26.420 --> 2:03:30.940]  there will be opportunities but we will need federal assistance in them, see the feds are
[2:03:30.940 --> 2:03:35.820]  going to pay the big money man to take over banks which have a bunch of real assets in
[2:03:35.820 --> 2:03:42.860]  them and then we get to fit the bill for that, now if you default on a house or a business
[2:03:42.860 --> 2:03:48.260]  you are going to lose it but they are going to go by banks and brokerage firms and investment
[2:03:48.260 --> 2:03:52.860]  firms and insurance companies that are in trouble and then you are going to pay to make them
[2:03:52.860 --> 2:03:59.980]  solvent, I just make so sick, Ross feels that there will be too many people who will provide
[2:03:59.980 --> 2:04:03.900]  capital to the larger financials which makes them less of a bargain than smaller banks,
[2:04:03.900 --> 2:04:12.740]  oh yeah they are the owners of the country and now they are entering the final phase
[2:04:12.740 --> 2:04:15.740]  and they are not going to prop any of the banks up anymore, they are more than happy
[2:04:15.740 --> 2:04:19.700]  to loan them money to keep them afloat for a while because that is something the taxpayer
[2:04:19.700 --> 2:04:26.100]  is going to be put on the line for but now they are entering the final quadrant of this
[2:04:26.100 --> 2:04:32.980]  operation where they are going to bankrupt these mega banks which are not the super
[2:04:32.980 --> 2:04:38.380]  owner banks but even mega banks below them and then the smaller regional banks as they
[2:04:38.380 --> 2:04:43.500]  are basically all gobbled up but you again will fit the bill at the end of a police
[2:04:43.500 --> 2:04:49.260]  machine gun, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's decision to seize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
[2:04:49.260 --> 2:04:53.500]  may choke off the biggest source of funding for financial companies suffering from the
[2:04:53.500 --> 2:04:57.860]  collapse of the subprime mortgage market, when Paulson took control of Fannie and Freddie
[2:04:57.860 --> 2:05:03.180]  Manson number 7 he scrapped dividends on the preferred stock of the government sponsored
[2:05:03.180 --> 2:05:08.500]  enterprises, he also said the US would buy as much as 200 billion of new securities that
[2:05:08.500 --> 2:05:13.460]  would rank ahead of existing issues, the plan sent shares tumbling on concern will become
[2:05:13.460 --> 2:05:20.100]  a model for the financial institutions reeling from 511 billion of write downs and credit
[2:05:20.100 --> 2:05:25.580]  losses since the start of 2007, financial companies raised 361 billion in capital to
[2:05:25.580 --> 2:05:31.180]  replenish their ballot sheets, data compiled by Bloomberg show banks with the 10 biggest
[2:05:31.180 --> 2:05:38.900]  write downs show at least 85 billion of preferred securities of 47% of the total the data show,
[2:05:38.900 --> 2:05:43.780]  Paulson's decision has been devastating on the market said Marilyn Cohen, President
[2:05:43.780 --> 2:05:52.700]  of Envision Capital Management Los Angeles, AIG shares plummet after Fern seeks financial
[2:05:52.700 --> 2:05:58.100]  help, shares of America International Group held sharply at reports the insurer had turned
[2:05:58.100 --> 2:06:04.180]  to the Federal Reserve for 40 billion in bridge financing to ward off a liquidity crisis and
[2:06:04.180 --> 2:06:17.820]  ratings downgrades, Fed's strategy has moved beyond rate cuts when it comes to a credit
[2:06:17.820 --> 2:06:22.460]  crunch the more things stay the same the more the Fed changes, in other words don't
[2:06:22.460 --> 2:06:27.140]  expect the central bank to cut interest rates today or Tuesday at its regular scheduled
[2:06:27.140 --> 2:06:32.940]  meeting following the Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, AIG developments even though that's
[2:06:32.940 --> 2:06:38.500]  the action it took in March when Bear Stearns was on the ropes, well they can't do that
[2:06:38.500 --> 2:06:43.460]  because the dollar would tank even faster and commodities would shoot back up if they were
[2:06:43.460 --> 2:06:52.820]  to cut interest rates because then no one would buy the stinking cesspit that is U.S.
[2:06:52.820 --> 2:06:57.820]  and European packaged investments and government backed securities I mean already the Treasury
[2:06:57.820 --> 2:07:04.700]  just took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac tens of trillions of dollars leverages up some
[2:07:04.700 --> 2:07:11.120]  say thousands of trillions and so they're barely even buying the dollars now and the
[2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:17.620]  dollar investments but if they cut the interest rates why would you buy bonds U.S. government
[2:07:17.620 --> 2:07:25.900]  bonds and different types of securities if you're making less than inflation?
[2:07:25.900 --> 2:07:30.380]  The Fed has been separating credit facilities with the interest rate reductions for some
[2:07:30.380 --> 2:07:36.140]  time now says Robert Bluska chief economist in fact in opinion economics in interest
[2:07:36.140 --> 2:07:40.380]  rates we're higher there might be some sense in lowering but they're not I think the Fed
[2:07:40.380 --> 2:07:49.380]  wants to keep the powder dry keep the powder dry they can't Europe's raised interest rates
[2:07:49.380 --> 2:07:55.420]  was it like three points higher than the United States?
[2:07:55.420 --> 2:08:05.940]  Oh God help us but let's not talk about this let's talk about Alex Jones and how I'm really
[2:08:05.940 --> 2:08:13.740]  a reptoid Lehman's discusses sale of investment unit with Bain Clayton Lehman Brothers Holdings

[2:09:01.460 --> 2:09:05.340]  but boy those brokers are calling old ladies telling them bye bye bye right now and they

[2:09:58.260 --> 2:10:06.100]  strength and you know wonderfulness but really it's because Merrill Lynch is in trouble that
[2:10:06.100 --> 2:10:15.940]  goes on Lehman follows the biggest bankruptcy in history as shares continue to plunge European
[2:10:15.940 --> 2:10:22.620]  stocks drop as treasury surge on Lehman bankruptcy so it's just sending shock waves through everything
[2:10:22.620 --> 2:10:34.340]  AIG fails after failing to give plan to save rating it lost half its value today that just
[2:10:34.340 --> 2:10:47.460]  came in crisis deepening just goes on and on let's put a caller in queue here Karen

[2:13:35.060 --> 2:13:43.220]  saying he produces a first-class God card federal lord card they bow properly to his
[2:13:43.220 --> 2:13:48.300]  lord ship what happens next the next thing I know I'm taking it and this happened in
[2:13:48.300 --> 2:13:53.780]  the state of Ohio I want to make it known that this happened in the state of Ohio I
[2:13:53.780 --> 2:14:00.340]  was then taken and arrested with a broken collarbone a broken nose a busted eye socket and a
[2:14:00.340 --> 2:14:09.300]  fractured arm caused by him but I was arrested put in jail put in without due process my mug
[2:14:09.300 --> 2:14:15.540]  shot I am nothing but a bloody mess I'm thrown into a cell at that point I'm transferred
[2:14:15.540 --> 2:14:22.100]  into a psych cell I have a concussion I can barely speak and so when the cop showed up
[2:14:22.100 --> 2:14:27.740]  he said she's now one of the right-wing patriots who thinks the IRS is evil she doesn't like
[2:14:27.740 --> 2:14:32.300]  the UN basically they're programming arrest her and you're bleeding in front of them and
[2:14:32.300 --> 2:14:38.340]  they respond and follow orders actually what he told him told them is that I was a threat
[2:14:38.340 --> 2:14:46.260]  to our two children because I obviously had psychiatric problems and just made that up
[2:14:46.260 --> 2:14:51.020]  and the police didn't ask why you were bloody they just said they know they they said that
[2:14:51.020 --> 2:14:57.260]  I was when I tried to speak with a concussion and being injured and being completely out
[2:14:57.260 --> 2:15:03.820]  of consciousness I tried to speak of course it was it made no sense I had a concussion
[2:15:03.820 --> 2:15:10.300]  okay what happened next I was put into the Hamilton County jail after being processed
[2:15:10.300 --> 2:15:15.940]  mug shot at fingerprinted handcuffed with a fractured arm put into the psych ward given
[2:15:15.940 --> 2:15:21.740]  heavy doses of a drug called cerak will up to two hundred and let me guess they told
[2:15:21.740 --> 2:15:27.460]  you that you weren't hurt or you did it to yourself what they said was when I woke up
[2:15:27.460 --> 2:15:34.860]  and I woke up four days later out of a haze I had no clue where I was at why I was there
[2:15:34.860 --> 2:15:40.020]  I was completely terrified I and then that's used as evidence of mental illness that after
[2:15:40.020 --> 2:15:45.980]  being drugged you didn't know where you were exactly sir they took my children from me
[2:15:45.980 --> 2:15:52.700]  they now live with this man in another state I am not allowed to see them except under
[2:15:52.700 --> 2:15:59.540]  supervision and my children are required because they sent them to the child protective services
[2:15:59.540 --> 2:16:05.180]  they sent me to the child protective services I told them what I really felt really believed
[2:16:05.180 --> 2:16:12.260]  I let them know that my husband had been abusing me and they said that no because I had conspiratorial
[2:16:12.260 --> 2:16:18.260]  thoughts I was obviously mentally imbalanced possibly listen listen listen listen they
[2:16:18.260 --> 2:16:22.820]  have over a hundred new designations if you believe the Federal Reserve is private they
[2:16:22.820 --> 2:16:28.140]  have it I'm not listeners this is not a joke that is a special mental illness if you believe
[2:16:28.140 --> 2:16:34.500]  that the government lies that is a mental illness and this is the new Soviet Union this
[2:16:34.500 --> 2:16:39.540]  is how America works now and of course if you believe that Lehman brothers went bankrupt
[2:16:39.540 --> 2:16:44.700]  today you're mentally ill the banks are fine everything's wonderful there's no inflation
[2:16:44.700 --> 2:16:49.260]  but they've had articles saying that's a conspiracy theory they've got articles saying we're mentally
[2:16:49.260 --> 2:16:54.940]  ill vaccines aren't hurting you that needs to be banned stay there I want to hear about
[2:16:54.940 --> 2:17:15.060]  the good part of the story we're talking to a lady whose husband was a big IRS big wick
[2:17:15.060 --> 2:17:21.300]  Peter Ruff called the cops broken arm halfway knocked out he says hey she believes in conspiracies

[2:18:55.340 --> 2:19:00.340]  to this well what was that well just to let you know when I was actually brought in before
[2:19:00.340 --> 2:19:07.140]  the judge in Hamilton county I was so drugged and so completely drugged up I had no clue
[2:19:07.140 --> 2:19:12.220]  what was going on no that's their favorite and they say look look at her she's mentally
[2:19:12.220 --> 2:19:17.500]  ill she's drooling absolutely crazy because I had no clue all I could say and I could
[2:19:17.500 --> 2:19:23.300]  hardly speak I was so drugged up I slurred and I realized that this was probably set
[2:19:23.300 --> 2:19:27.460]  up he had his buddies ready to he beats you up and then called this was all set up but
[2:19:27.460 --> 2:19:33.420]  go ahead all I said to the judge is that I wanted a divorce she sentenced me to six
[2:19:33.420 --> 2:19:41.740]  months in jail no one had ever in the history of Ohio been sentenced to six months in jail
[2:19:41.740 --> 2:19:49.220]  and given a misdemeanor one for what I did not do after that I am unemployable because
[2:19:49.220 --> 2:19:54.860]  there's a law about tearing the workplace and and and if you ever have children again
[2:19:54.860 --> 2:20:00.940]  they'll try to seize those they tried to sterilize me while I was in jail they they were going
[2:20:00.940 --> 2:20:06.780]  through the lawsuit to have me sterilized in between that time I met my new husband
[2:20:06.780 --> 2:20:14.420]  now and I became pregnant my new husband helped me go into hiding my other I was not allowed
[2:20:14.420 --> 2:20:21.700]  by the state of Ohio to get a divorce without the consent of my ex-husband he had to consent
[2:20:21.700 --> 2:20:27.820]  to divorce me it took two and a half years no attorney would represent me I had to represent
[2:20:27.820 --> 2:20:34.980]  myself pro say I'm still not allowed to see my children except supervised I'm not allowed
[2:20:34.980 --> 2:20:42.460]  to go anywhere near their school have any part and the DHS controls every aspect of what
[2:20:42.460 --> 2:20:46.900]  I do with those children and the Department of Human Services which has an NSA guy running

[2:21:07.140 --> 2:21:14.460]  the bagging hearing the sadness the wrongness they just swell up with evil oh yes that's
[2:21:14.460 --> 2:21:19.140]  what it's all about the victory against goodness it's about the victory of evil the victory
[2:21:19.140 --> 2:21:25.740]  of of of injustice the victory of abuse the victory of corruption the victory of inside
[2:21:25.740 --> 2:21:33.580]  jobs the the the victory of cronyism and criminal cliques the victory over goodness that's
[2:21:33.580 --> 2:21:38.980]  what all this is about and these women you know I've seen all the newspapers I've seen
[2:21:38.980 --> 2:21:44.980]  it personally these men they're always so shocked by they think that the establishment
[2:21:44.980 --> 2:21:52.300]  hears their story and cares they love it they love hurting the good they're evil don't worry
[2:21:52.300 --> 2:21:57.620]  there's bigger more powerful evil creatures that are gonna hurt you too just remember
[2:21:57.620 --> 2:22:11.300]  that big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[2:22:11.300 --> 2:22:23.380]  he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:22:23.380 --> 2:22:26.260]  one eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one info wars dot com is the website
[2:22:26.260 --> 2:22:31.180]  we also have prison planet dot com and redesigned again tell us what you think of the new design
[2:22:31.180 --> 2:22:40.340]  of prison planet dot com by Kurt Nemo and crew I mean folks do you realize how big this
[2:22:40.340 --> 2:22:48.420]  economic collapses do you realize how massive it is to have some of the biggest banks and
[2:22:48.420 --> 2:22:53.780]  brokerage firms going under to have Lehman brothers the fourth largest in the country
[2:22:53.780 --> 2:23:01.300]  eighty plus billion dollars of exposure just in two major mutual funds alone where it's
[2:23:01.300 --> 2:23:08.780]  just fake investments they took bad mortgages package them as securities and then sold those
[2:23:08.780 --> 2:23:13.780]  but also use them as the equivalent of assets to then through fractional reserve banking
[2:23:13.780 --> 2:23:23.380]  loan out ten times that in loans to people and as asset back securities the whole system
[2:23:23.380 --> 2:23:33.220]  is rotten it's just it's biblical in proportion just how big all of this really is and this
[2:23:33.220 --> 2:23:40.860]  on the heels of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac trillions and trillions of dollars and that's
[2:23:40.860 --> 2:23:44.740]  just the exposure the media is admitting the government submitting me taken over by the
[2:23:44.740 --> 2:23:53.500]  treasury but then you have all of those securities that were bundled all those mortgages that
[2:23:53.500 --> 2:24:06.980]  were bundled and sold themselves as commodities out there on the open market it is mind boggling
[2:24:06.980 --> 2:24:12.500]  it's mind boggling to see this happening and to know that we are as the American citizens
[2:24:12.500 --> 2:24:17.740]  are going to be put on the hook here two different ways at least one we're going to be made to
[2:24:17.740 --> 2:24:24.500]  quote pay taxes for the bailouts because the same banks that are being bailed out the same
[2:24:24.500 --> 2:24:35.340]  private federal reserve banks when the treasury issues new liquidity interest is paid to those
[2:24:35.340 --> 2:24:43.660]  banks for the right of the government to create the instrument so that's the fractional reserve
[2:24:43.660 --> 2:24:50.180]  banking scam that the Federal Reserve the private Federal Reserve set up back in 1913
[2:24:50.180 --> 2:24:59.860]  and so they're they're instituting this implosion by design to fully suck the entire economy
[2:24:59.860 --> 2:25:05.300]  into it basically we got Joseph Stiglitz Nobel Prize winner to come on and talk about this
[2:25:05.300 --> 2:25:09.860]  tomorrow one of other big economic guests throughout the week coming on to discuss this but right
[2:25:09.860 --> 2:25:16.340]  now let's go to the calls here Mike in New Jersey you're on the air welcome yeah a couple
[2:25:16.340 --> 2:25:19.980]  of things I just want to tell you a couple of weeks ago somebody called up about the
[2:25:19.980 --> 2:25:24.100]  sign of the devil that they see a lot of the rock stars and fans doing I just wanted to
[2:25:24.100 --> 2:25:30.020]  correct that when the thumb is out it's sign language for I love you secondly so this is
[2:25:30.020 --> 2:25:37.580]  I love you and then this is the Diablo right for television I'm holding up like this is
[2:25:37.580 --> 2:25:42.620]  I love you and I think it's that way how is it with sign language it's gentle the basically
[2:25:42.620 --> 2:25:47.220]  it's the pinky the index finger and the thumb is out no I know but I think they also put
[2:25:47.220 --> 2:25:52.340]  their hand I want one direction I forget I have to look it up I just wanted to correct
[2:25:52.340 --> 2:25:58.780]  that and then this is this is hang loose which means surf's up dude yeah the other thing
[2:25:58.780 --> 2:26:03.700]  as far as the food and a lot of the commercials that you have with the eFoods.com I would
[2:26:03.700 --> 2:26:07.780]  definitely suggest people start listening carefully because in my side of New Jersey
[2:26:07.780 --> 2:26:12.700]  the shells have been going bare like the last month and a half and I've been stocking up
[2:26:12.700 --> 2:26:19.220]  on cans and my third point is don't mess with the Illuminati because I was working with
[2:26:19.220 --> 2:26:26.460]  somebody who was a Mason and I did not realize he had as much cloud as he did basically he
[2:26:26.460 --> 2:26:32.780]  was sabotaging my department stealing information etc and somehow or another a big to-do came
[2:26:32.780 --> 2:26:38.340]  about he managed to get the owner of the facility to get rid of me even though the administrator
[2:26:38.340 --> 2:26:43.620]  wanted to keep me since then I've been blacklisted in this entire area I moved to New Jersey
[2:26:43.620 --> 2:26:49.060]  and well it's the same thing in England I mean just type in to the BBC where you can't
[2:26:49.060 --> 2:26:55.660]  be a judge or a barrister a lawyer unless you're a Mason and and and that's the problem
[2:26:55.660 --> 2:27:00.780]  is it becomes this good old boy club you can debate what goes on secretly but but it becomes
[2:27:00.780 --> 2:27:06.540]  this good old boy club where you can't operate or have a job or even basically live in many
[2:27:06.540 --> 2:27:09.820]  areas of the world unless you're part of the you know the brotherhood unless you're a widow
[2:27:09.820 --> 2:27:15.020]  son yeah I mean I basically had a wonderful reputation and career in New York and I moved
[2:27:15.020 --> 2:27:20.660]  out here to New Jersey and I did not realize how pervasive this was and I only learned
[2:27:20.660 --> 2:27:23.820]  about it just basically through you I mean I've had dealt with a lot of different types
[2:27:23.820 --> 2:27:27.660]  of people in New York my entire life but you know you come out here and you realize my
[2:27:27.660 --> 2:27:32.180]  god they've got their claws into everything so much so that I've even gone to switch right
[2:27:32.180 --> 2:27:36.260]  out of the career that I was in just as a means of trying to get employment it's not
[2:27:36.260 --> 2:27:40.820]  happening so it's like if you work with somebody and they tell you they were a Mason look for
[2:27:40.820 --> 2:27:46.540]  another job immediately well I mean let's be clear you've got people that use the Masonic
[2:27:46.540 --> 2:27:54.900]  system power you know for power and control but I mean to generalize most your masons
[2:27:54.900 --> 2:28:00.140]  are what they call useful idiots but one thing even had I've run into even in New York they
[2:28:00.140 --> 2:28:04.980]  were pretty much very egotistical egomaniacs to the point where they were even stealing
[2:28:04.980 --> 2:28:12.020]  money and food from different homeless shelters and what have you I mean I've actually seen
[2:28:12.020 --> 2:28:16.300]  it hurt it and I just walked away from that organization that I was volunteering with so
[2:28:16.300 --> 2:28:20.700]  it's just I okay don't want to generalize but just the few that I've had dealings with
[2:28:20.700 --> 2:28:26.540]  they are utilizing their power for corruption you know so basically it's just there's a
[2:28:26.540 --> 2:28:31.700]  lot going on more than just that I mean even as a civil rights in terms of the employment
[2:28:31.700 --> 2:28:36.580]  we've lost our bill of rights just in the workforce once you get into the workforce
[2:28:36.580 --> 2:28:40.460]  you don't have freedom of speech or any of that other stuff so it started there well
[2:28:40.460 --> 2:28:43.660]  it's more than that I mean they start the drug testing which sounds reasonable and the
[2:28:43.660 --> 2:28:48.420]  government starts making companies drug test and then they DNA test and then you got a thumb
[2:28:48.420 --> 2:28:54.220]  scan to get your school lunch I mean it's just this total control grid people never think
[2:28:54.220 --> 2:28:58.180]  well wait what could the government do with this power could they abuse me then you read
[2:28:58.180 --> 2:29:01.980]  their founding documents for all this big brother stuff it is meant to control you and
[2:29:01.980 --> 2:29:08.620]  dominate you thanks for the call let's take another one here let's talk to Carlos in California
[2:29:08.620 --> 2:29:09.620]  Carlos welcome.
[2:29:09.620 --> 2:29:18.620]  Hey John Alex there's too many critical issues out there you have the controlled economic
[2:29:18.620 --> 2:29:24.100]  collapse you have the weather control hurricanes and then we have the passage of the real ID
[2:29:24.100 --> 2:29:25.100]  here in California.
[2:29:25.100 --> 2:29:27.100]  You hear him?
[2:29:27.100 --> 2:29:28.100]  Yes sir.
[2:29:28.100 --> 2:29:35.980]  And so the real ID just passed the senate here and it's in the government desk for signing
[2:29:35.980 --> 2:29:41.220]  and you know of course that's a trojan horse for a national ID but eventually they're
[2:29:41.220 --> 2:29:45.860]  going to find a way to microchip us and that's really what worries me because what's going
[2:29:45.860 --> 2:29:53.540]  to prevent the government due to the technology that people sense to once they microchip us
[2:29:53.540 --> 2:29:58.980]  to make us part of one big database which will be in essence a real brain.
[2:29:58.980 --> 2:29:59.980]  Well exactly.
[2:29:59.980 --> 2:30:01.980]  A real vital real brain.
[2:30:01.980 --> 2:30:06.300]  But I mean it's not even it's even worse than that with the face scan with the plate
[2:30:06.300 --> 2:30:11.580]  scan when you pay cash having a thumb print if you're not a good little globalist they
[2:30:11.580 --> 2:30:16.100]  just turn your biometric number off and you can't buy and sell.
[2:30:16.100 --> 2:30:20.660]  Now that's not from the Bible that is separately in the Bible that's what the government and
[2:30:20.660 --> 2:30:26.660]  international treaties they say that's what this is for and that's why in Australia and
[2:30:26.660 --> 2:30:33.220]  Germany and England and the U.S. and Canada all over public schools you got a thumb scan
[2:30:33.220 --> 2:30:37.900]  to get your lunch you got a thumb scan to clock in at work you got a thumb scan to get
[2:30:37.900 --> 2:30:42.420]  library books you got a thumb scan to go to a tanning salon you got a thumb scan to clock
[2:30:42.420 --> 2:30:47.860]  in at work at Dillard's you've got a thumb scan they are admittedly this is in their
[2:30:47.860 --> 2:30:54.300]  own documents from the different convention meetings and things they've had where they
[2:30:54.300 --> 2:30:59.940]  promote all this getting us ready for this and then the corruption is going to be a hundred
[2:30:59.940 --> 2:31:00.940]  times worse.
[2:31:00.940 --> 2:31:07.340]  This is a psychopathic control grid a straight jacket so we're chained down so the devils
[2:31:07.340 --> 2:31:10.340]  can have their way.
[2:31:10.340 --> 2:31:16.660]  Okay Alex and you know so we have facial recognition characteristics capabilities
[2:31:16.660 --> 2:31:20.860]  so you walk down the street with those all kinds of cameras they don't know on the spot
[2:31:20.860 --> 2:31:25.300]  you're like that because they got your number they got your facial characteristics but like
[2:31:25.300 --> 2:31:30.700]  I said once you're tied to a real brain they can immediately send a command from their
[2:31:30.700 --> 2:31:36.060]  satellites and say hey I want you to kill your mom or I want you to commit suicide and
[2:31:36.060 --> 2:31:40.020]  the whole world will be tied into the same system they would automatically attack like
[2:31:40.020 --> 2:31:42.420]  robots and carry the command.
[2:31:42.420 --> 2:31:46.100]  The people that want to be God in government for 50 years have been working on different
[2:31:46.100 --> 2:31:51.020]  wavelengths to make you happy to make you sad to make you nauseous to kill you and yes
[2:31:51.020 --> 2:31:56.060]  they have cell tower systems and this has been in the mainstream news they're testing
[2:31:56.060 --> 2:32:03.340]  what looks like cell towers this is DARPA where it can literally control your mood and
[2:32:03.340 --> 2:32:08.340]  of course Bob Woodward is talking about this new super weapon they've got these microwave
[2:32:08.340 --> 2:32:13.740]  guns that fry people and so what happens is the camera face scans you a little drone flies
[2:32:13.740 --> 2:32:21.180]  by and shoots some radiation beams at you and that's what and then you die a week later
[2:32:21.180 --> 2:32:24.900]  and so that's why they're so arrogant that's why they're like look we're going to take
[2:32:24.900 --> 2:32:28.580]  your property we're going to play you all off against each other and when we're going
[2:32:28.580 --> 2:32:34.860]  to kill you and you're going to like it and that's what the soft kill cancer the soft
[2:32:34.860 --> 2:32:39.220]  kill diabetes all the things they're putting in the food and water and the shots everybody
[2:32:39.220 --> 2:32:43.740]  getting sick it's all that I mean we're just like Africa just like Africa they're killing
[2:32:43.740 --> 2:32:47.660]  people there they're doing it here now and and and it's just so sick
[2:32:47.660 --> 2:33:13.980]  the control of the drug networks have perpetrated a wave of crime across Mexico they have justified
[2:33:13.980 --> 2:33:19.340]  now the deployment of so much military all across various cities they've deployed like
[2:33:19.340 --> 2:33:22.740]  thirty thousand oh listen stay there stay there Carlos I'm going to hold you over because
[2:33:22.740 --> 2:33:29.660]  I want to hear about this from an eyewitness but it's admitted one thousand murders in
[2:33:29.660 --> 2:33:34.980]  the way of a Laredo alone and another thousand just just so far this year that was in a headline
[2:33:34.980 --> 2:33:41.900]  Friday out of AFP another thousand in the town across from El Paso and that's all by
[2:33:41.900 --> 2:33:47.460]  design and you said microchips the police are now taking chips and if you want to work
[2:33:47.460 --> 2:33:52.100]  for the Justice Department in Mexico you've got to take a chip so see it's happening but
[2:33:52.100 --> 2:33:55.540]  I say it's happening they'll arrest me for being mentally ill even though it's in the

[2:34:15.980 --> 2:34:21.500]  they call it opposition something disorder they've got all these different disorders
[2:34:21.500 --> 2:34:26.020]  but they say that it is a schizophrenic mental illness to say the government wants to put
[2:34:26.020 --> 2:34:30.220]  chips in you but I've had police chiefs on to say I've got a chip I want to make everybody
[2:34:30.220 --> 2:34:35.420]  take chips in my town Bergen County a police chief they have a police chief for the county
[2:34:35.420 --> 2:34:41.540]  in Bergen County that's across the water from New York and it's around Newark New Jersey
[2:34:41.540 --> 2:34:45.220]  I've had all these other people on I've had the apply digital solutions company owner
[2:34:45.220 --> 2:34:50.420]  on say they want to make people take microchips but then it doesn't exist Carlos and we're
[2:34:50.420 --> 2:35:06.300]  praising the plan Mexico now that there was a plan Colombia where we the US government
[2:35:06.300 --> 2:35:23.180]  used to to create havoc and conflict between both sides and we know that's going that's
[2:35:23.180 --> 2:35:28.220]  going to militarize the whole thing in Mexico and like I say when I go to I see all kinds
[2:35:28.220 --> 2:35:33.420]  of trucks with military people towing their guns and showing up their guns and it's a
[2:35:33.420 --> 2:35:39.580]  state of it's a police state basically people are now intimidated the streets are bears
[2:35:39.580 --> 2:35:46.580]  the tourism has dropped by 50% well notice notice what happened Calderon steals his way
[2:35:46.580 --> 2:35:53.860]  into office and then magically wars and mass death I mean more dangerous than Iraq folks
[2:35:53.860 --> 2:36:00.260]  much more flare up everywhere and then we had Celica still on I keep forgetting let's
[2:36:00.260 --> 2:36:04.700]  look at Celica still all back on the show I'm going to get him back on write that down
[2:36:04.700 --> 2:36:12.020]  for me thanks all of this just explodes and the CIA is funding Los Etas funding the drug
[2:36:12.020 --> 2:36:18.580]  cartels and they're having wars with the smaller cartels so that the US banks get a monopoly
[2:36:18.580 --> 2:36:23.540]  over the drug money and there is a full scale war going on but you hardly hear about it
[2:36:23.540 --> 2:36:30.620]  in our news 2000 dead on the Texas Mexico border this year alone a few years ago we thought
[2:36:30.620 --> 2:36:39.060]  800 and something was bad 2000 dead hundreds dead on our side dead US cops dead citizens
[2:36:39.060 --> 2:36:45.180]  and it's not even hardly in our media again but but but but some some kids shoot somebody
[2:36:45.180 --> 2:36:49.180]  and they say let's ban guns in the US so so tell me what else you're seeing in Mexico
[2:36:49.180 --> 2:36:56.140]  well I mean you know the strides remember strides are being made towards the imposition
[2:36:56.140 --> 2:37:02.340]  of the police day you got in the various cities in Mexico now you got military by the thousands
[2:37:02.340 --> 2:37:11.340]  Kuliacan Tijuana Monterey in Monterey alone people are afraid to go night clubbing because
[2:37:11.340 --> 2:37:16.100]  all the nightclubs they were they were starting to have many attacks on the nightclubs many
[2:37:16.100 --> 2:37:23.500]  killings last week in three different states in Mexico headlines bodies popped up all over
[2:37:23.500 --> 2:37:29.260]  the place well they found eight bodies eight what eight bodies or was it twelve bodies
[2:37:29.260 --> 2:37:38.500]  in one day in Yucatan exactly it all comes from the drug networks in conjunction with
[2:37:38.500 --> 2:37:46.740]  the gangs in conjunction with the CIA and that's all to create an all of fear to justify
[2:37:46.740 --> 2:37:51.420]  the militarization of Mexico and eventually the microchipping of the population well I
[2:37:51.420 --> 2:38:06.220]  agree and and and hold on here we go here we go all right we are back live ladies and
[2:38:06.220 --> 2:38:15.620]  gentlemen we're talking to Carlos in California I skipped that segment for info wars dot com

[2:38:21.020 --> 2:38:27.340]  deaths I mean it's just mass murder all CIA run down there and notice it's how right when
[2:38:27.340 --> 2:38:33.220]  this president who stole his way into power gets in suddenly all the mass killing starts
[2:38:33.220 --> 2:38:38.980]  and Bush is talking about a hundred plus billion dollars to fight the war on drugs and what's
[2:38:38.980 --> 2:38:45.380]  it produce tens of thousands dead total destruction of their tourism people are starting to not
[2:38:45.380 --> 2:38:51.660]  go to Cancun now because of all the murder down there society is unraveling we're becoming
[2:38:51.660 --> 2:38:59.060]  cavemen the crooks that run things now just just just have no sense and we're becoming
[2:38:59.060 --> 2:39:04.180]  a third world nation just like Mexico and that's where we're going to go no middle class Americans
[2:39:04.180 --> 2:39:10.140]  living in cardboard boxes you wanted it you're going to get it anything else Carlos
[2:39:10.140 --> 2:39:33.980]  you know just try to do as much as we can to alert our friends our families and just
[2:39:33.980 --> 2:39:50.460]  get ready well see now that there's mass killings in almost every town every day and then in
[2:39:50.460 --> 2:39:55.940]  government backed now the government can pose as the savior and didn't matter if it's a
[2:39:55.940 --> 2:40:00.740]  total dictatorship down there that's the same thing here they're fighting terrorism thanks
[2:40:00.740 --> 2:40:06.780]  for the call Carlos let's talk to Rick and Indiana Rick you're on the air Alex I get
[2:40:06.780 --> 2:40:12.020]  to talk to you man first-time caller long-time listener I want to reach them to your first
[2:40:12.020 --> 2:40:15.100]  man because I know that you get stressed out I can see it on the video I can see it on
[2:40:15.100 --> 2:40:18.380]  your face I understand you get worked up but I know you're Christian and one of the things
[2:40:18.380 --> 2:40:21.980]  I want to share with you is for everything that was written in the past was written
[2:40:21.980 --> 2:40:26.060]  to teach us so that through interns and the encouragement of the scriptures we might have
[2:40:26.060 --> 2:40:32.020]  hope so keep the light bright brother keep it going listen I work for a broadcast network
[2:40:32.020 --> 2:40:37.100]  that you used to be on globally it was on shortwave and also on one of our FM frequencies
[2:40:37.100 --> 2:40:41.900]  and I asked why you were pulled a while back because they pulled you before I actually
[2:40:41.900 --> 2:40:45.580]  started working for the company I thought well why why would they pull this show you
[2:40:45.580 --> 2:40:50.020]  know because it you didn't do anything or didn't say anything on the air that really
[2:40:50.020 --> 2:40:54.900]  affected anyone in particular so I started looking into it and I was basically told
[2:40:54.900 --> 2:40:59.180]  we could ask him questions you don't want to go there so I started doing some investing
[2:40:59.180 --> 2:41:02.020]  again got to know some people and some higher-ups in the company and one of the things I asked
[2:41:02.020 --> 2:41:06.380]  was you know hey what do you feel about the NAU and one of the things that they looked
[2:41:06.380 --> 2:41:10.380]  at me kind of funny like what do you mean that's you know they gave me a look like whatever
[2:41:10.380 --> 2:41:13.900]  I'm not worried about that you know that's just a bunch of malarkey or one of the conspiracy
[2:41:13.900 --> 2:41:19.620]  theorists but yet they had a concern on the CFR so I thought you know this is a Christian
[2:41:19.620 --> 2:41:25.340]  company that I work for that's supposed to uphold the truth and all things and yet here
[2:41:25.340 --> 2:41:31.980]  we are we're bending backwards for the all-powerful dollar that just keeps seem to fade and it
[2:41:31.980 --> 2:41:37.940]  just makes me wonder you know what can what can somebody in my position anybody that would
[2:41:37.940 --> 2:41:42.380]  be in this position would want to know what's going on and here I am well you know you know
[2:41:42.380 --> 2:41:47.140]  that's what happens they need to destroy me because I'm a symbol of the resistance and
[2:41:47.140 --> 2:41:50.660]  people need to realize that they're trying to destroy and I haven't wanted to be this
[2:41:50.660 --> 2:41:56.340]  one of the symbols or one of the icons of resistance but but they do that so I've been
[2:41:56.340 --> 2:42:03.220]  thrown off a lot of networks a lot of affiliates a lot of subnetworks for talking about 911
[2:42:03.220 --> 2:42:07.220]  million inside job for the things I've done but that isn't enough for the enemy they then
[2:42:07.220 --> 2:42:14.100]  have to fool the weak-minded out there and they come out and say Alex Jones works for
[2:42:14.100 --> 2:42:26.380]  ABC now it isn't true but they repeat it and they say it to then try to discredit me and
[2:42:26.380 --> 2:42:34.180]  they don't care what the truth is people people want to believe a good yarn the truth is there
[2:42:34.180 --> 2:42:41.740]  are three radio satellites anybody can go lease a feed on them and we're on an ABC star guide
[2:42:41.740 --> 2:42:46.540]  we used to also rent a clear channel star guide but they didn't tell us when we signed
[2:42:46.540 --> 2:42:52.100]  up for it that they wouldn't give the descrambling code station owners and managers don't have
[2:42:52.100 --> 2:42:56.340]  ridiculous this rumor that I work for ABC is because they understand you have three kinds
[2:42:56.340 --> 2:43:01.540]  of receivers a Jones receiver an ABC receiver or a star guide receiver they're about to come
[2:43:01.540 --> 2:43:08.340]  out with some new systems you know to get radio people say well XM to but that's that's separate
[2:43:08.340 --> 2:43:12.020]  and we wanted to get on there and they clear channel owns and controls that won't put us
[2:43:12.020 --> 2:43:17.900]  on there as well they know we have a big audience so we're censored at every quarter and so
[2:43:17.900 --> 2:43:22.660]  we found out the most stations of ABC receivers and so we go out and lease one of those and
[2:43:22.660 --> 2:43:28.580]  they say oh we work for ABC we're an affiliate of ABC that's like if I have an AT&T cell
[2:43:28.580 --> 2:43:34.980]  phone no I'm not with AT&T or if I have a Sony camera I don't work for Sony I have you
[2:43:34.980 --> 2:43:41.300]  know it's like I have Time Warner cable I have service from them it's not that I work
[2:43:41.300 --> 2:43:44.100]  for Time Warner but but stay there I want to talk to you during the break is I don't
[2:43:44.100 --> 2:43:59.780]  know what network you're talking about we're on them
[2:43:59.780 --> 2:44:08.860]  we really should be positive people worldwide know that 9-11's an inside job the majority
[2:44:08.860 --> 2:44:16.860]  of people in every major poll I've seen don't believe the official story the bankers propaganda
[2:44:16.860 --> 2:44:21.940]  is not being listened to by the people that count you can have billions of couch potatoes
[2:44:21.940 --> 2:44:26.700]  that would drink cyanide if they were ordered to by the government they don't count what
[2:44:26.700 --> 2:44:32.420]  counts people that are involved and informed informed and involved and that's why I'm just
[2:44:32.420 --> 2:44:36.940]  so honored to be associated with all of you out there I just love you because you are
[2:44:36.940 --> 2:44:40.740]  the people that care people that are involved and we're doing the best job we can reach
[2:44:40.740 --> 2:44:51.100]  out to who we can let's go ahead and talk to James in Ohio then Sam oh no James just
[2:44:51.100 --> 2:44:56.180]  hung up we'll go to Sam and England Carlos Steve and others Sam and England you're on
[2:44:56.180 --> 2:45:04.700]  the air welcome hello sir yeah I want to say I love what you do with Prison Planet dot
[2:45:04.700 --> 2:45:13.220]  TV thank you you made two of the best films ever in my opinion what films for those Tara
[2:45:13.220 --> 2:45:20.100]  Storm and Hengie thank you and Tara Storm when you see a Brian Whore up so popular but
[2:45:20.100 --> 2:45:28.060]  do you remember him the annual protestor yes yeah I'd like spoken to him a few times
[2:45:28.060 --> 2:45:37.940]  so and I just wonder whether you saw an article on about GMO seeds found in Scotland well
[2:45:37.940 --> 2:45:42.740]  I know that it's supposedly banned in England but they but the companies keep coming in
[2:45:42.740 --> 2:45:50.220]  planting it near growth belts to infect the other plants it's a military operation yeah
[2:45:50.220 --> 2:45:54.340]  well I just don't want to say on the article it said that they originated from North America
[2:45:54.340 --> 2:46:00.300]  so I wonder what you thought about that well the big GMO makers is only four big companies
[2:46:00.300 --> 2:46:07.420]  they're all basically Pentagon fronts everything the fake news the propaganda the Northcom Homeland
[2:46:07.420 --> 2:46:15.260]  Security GMO it's all designed by them for full spectrum dominance they've stated this
[2:46:15.260 --> 2:46:19.900]  and so they come into countries and they buy plots of land and they plant their GMO foods
[2:46:19.900 --> 2:46:27.500]  where it's illegal and they've they've caught company workers driving along throwing seeds
[2:46:27.500 --> 2:46:35.060]  out of the backs of trucks into the ditches by farmers land to infect their crops it's
[2:46:35.060 --> 2:46:42.220]  a bio weapon attack it's a eugenics attack I'm not just saying that it really is folks
[2:46:42.220 --> 2:46:52.220]  and to realize the full magnitude of that it is dumbfounding it is dumbfounding to come
[2:46:52.220 --> 2:46:58.620]  to grips with the fact that we have a completely lawless criminal government a criminal elite
[2:46:58.620 --> 2:47:02.540]  but what are people doing up there in your neck of the woods in England are they waking
[2:47:02.540 --> 2:47:08.260]  up to the new world order it seems like they are when I do radio interviews yeah yeah quite
[2:47:08.260 --> 2:47:15.660]  a lot of people are but not not too many in my area because we live in quite a rural area
[2:47:15.660 --> 2:47:20.260]  so there's not so many people waking up around here well are they just keeping it themselves
[2:47:20.260 --> 2:47:25.700]  or what's happening yeah they just yeah they just keep themselves so they're in their own
[2:47:25.700 --> 2:47:34.940]  sort of world down here you say down here where are you in England roster sure it's
[2:47:34.940 --> 2:47:41.820]  like near Wales on the border of Wales England yeah it is is that we got a lot we have a
[2:47:41.820 --> 2:47:45.300]  lot of chemtrails around here and stuff like that but people just don't seem to notice
[2:47:45.300 --> 2:47:51.780]  like and they won't notice either when their kids get diabetes for no reason from the shots
[2:47:51.780 --> 2:47:56.220]  or they die they'll just go to the hospital and die and you know love the government
[2:47:56.220 --> 2:47:59.980]  that's what it's all about loving the government never being free never knowing how the world
[2:47:59.980 --> 2:48:03.860]  really works is living in darkness well my friend I would challenge you to wake people
[2:48:03.860 --> 2:48:09.060]  up one mind at a time and a lot of times you'll find people are just keeping themselves because
[2:48:09.060 --> 2:48:15.500]  they do know what's going on so I challenge you to be a light in your area and to expose
[2:48:15.500 --> 2:48:22.300]  darkness yeah what do you think of all the big banks and things going under and talk
[2:48:22.300 --> 2:48:29.060]  of a thousand u.s. banks going under and hundreds of billions of dollars and losses a day meanwhile
[2:48:29.060 --> 2:48:33.260]  people literally on talk ready or singing economy strong Sarah Palin is going to save
[2:48:33.260 --> 2:48:39.580]  us Barack Obama is going to save us and they're just dancing in the streets loving it with
[2:48:39.580 --> 2:48:45.900]  the difference between like on the American news CNN and things that they are like don't
[2:48:45.900 --> 2:48:49.220]  really admit we're overly do seem to admit more that we're in a recession and seem to
[2:48:49.220 --> 2:48:57.540]  be a bit more open about it well it's very upsetting to me it's very depressing to me
[2:48:57.540 --> 2:49:01.860]  to know that the very same parties have designed all this we have their documents where they
[2:49:01.860 --> 2:49:06.180]  admit they designed it the general public doesn't even know there's an international
[2:49:06.180 --> 2:49:11.060]  architecture or powerful financiers they've been told that doesn't exist I mean it's
[2:49:11.060 --> 2:49:16.460]  just so childlike to talk to adults who just go no I'm in charge of my life and there's
[2:49:16.460 --> 2:49:22.780]  no elite and a Barack Obama and Hillary and all that's real and it's just it sometimes
[2:49:22.780 --> 2:49:28.260]  it really freaks me out I appreciate your call good to hear from you Sam another Carlos
[2:49:28.260 --> 2:49:30.660]  this time in Michigan Carlos you're on the air
[2:49:30.660 --> 2:49:38.380]  good yeah my concern is with the the violence happened in Mexico man I was interested with
[2:49:38.380 --> 2:49:42.380]  because you had to interview with Celica Steele and I listened to that online it was a great
[2:49:42.380 --> 2:49:46.060]  interview by the way and I'm interested in you know you having them back online but
[2:49:46.060 --> 2:49:50.940]  um my mom brought this up yesterday I was born in Chihuahua Mexico and there was an
[2:49:50.940 --> 2:49:55.940]  incident where they found 24 people shot at that execution style close to a ranch that
[2:49:55.940 --> 2:50:00.340]  we have down there and I know people don't realize but the violence is going to spill
[2:50:00.340 --> 2:50:04.660]  over to the US porters and you already don't know because the media doesn't talk about
[2:50:04.660 --> 2:50:09.940]  it what cops don't know about all the dead cops because they're they're only taught
[2:50:09.940 --> 2:50:15.100]  to fear the citizen they're not taught to ever know what's going on on the border or
[2:50:15.100 --> 2:50:20.940]  what's going on anywhere else see just like people fear Al Qaeda like a child doesn't fear
[2:50:20.940 --> 2:50:25.780]  being run over by a car the real threat to them but they fear monsters in the closet
[2:50:25.780 --> 2:50:30.980]  it's that art typal fear so so police fear the citizens but they don't fear what really
[2:50:30.980 --> 2:50:37.660]  kills them like car wrecks you see the public fears Al Qaeda but they don't fear the government
[2:50:37.660 --> 2:50:42.260]  that's taking all their rights those statistically governments are the greatest takers of liberty
[2:50:42.260 --> 2:50:47.100]  and property and life you see but but they've been taught to fear but but yeah tell folks
[2:50:47.100 --> 2:50:52.660]  what's going on in Mexico 2000 dead in the last nine months alone on the Texas Mexico
[2:50:52.660 --> 2:51:02.660]  border 2000 dead and in in in this atmosphere of lawlessness there are rapes and murders
[2:51:02.660 --> 2:51:09.300]  and killings because when society unravels and when the government goes totally rogue
[2:51:09.300 --> 2:51:13.060]  then the other criminals run wild go ahead and tell folks what's happening in Mexico
[2:51:13.060 --> 2:51:18.060]  because I get emails saying it's a conspiracy theory yeah no the 2000 number you said is
[2:51:18.060 --> 2:51:22.820]  a it's it's probably a low number because a lot of the deaths that happen on there a
[2:51:22.820 --> 2:51:25.100]  lot of the bodies that are not found people that are not they're missing they're not
[2:51:25.100 --> 2:51:29.220]  considered dead so they're not even out there in a number so 2000 is a low number so it's
[2:51:29.220 --> 2:51:39.780]  probably higher than that and oh keep going I wanted to hear what he had to say he's still
[2:51:39.780 --> 2:51:46.540]  there are you are are you still there Carlos all right we lost his lines he can call back
[2:51:46.540 --> 2:51:51.660]  in about I want to hear the story now I got a new knife this weekend I was pulling it
[2:51:51.660 --> 2:51:57.380]  out to show people and it seemed to scare Paul in there running the show for some reason
[2:51:57.380 --> 2:52:04.220]  I know I was going to say down in Mexico they don't have a lot of guns the citizens don't
[2:52:04.220 --> 2:52:07.700]  but the criminals down there do have guns and all the citizens have our little knives
[2:52:07.700 --> 2:52:10.620]  to fight back with and if the cops catch you with one of these you get beat up and go to
[2:52:10.620 --> 2:52:16.460]  jail in Mexico so that was my point and we see the same domestication now starting here
[2:52:16.460 --> 2:52:20.100]  in the United States where you know if they catch a teenager with a little knife in their
[2:52:20.100 --> 2:52:23.540]  pocket it's something we all carried as kids I mean for me it's totally normal just have
[2:52:23.540 --> 2:52:27.020]  a pocket knife in there and you know I like pick my fingernails with it pick my teeth
[2:52:27.020 --> 2:52:32.420]  with it I need to cut something I slice it so but no no this is now this is even frowned
[2:52:32.420 --> 2:52:38.460]  upon in the United States now see I'm becoming a slave I'm becoming a a surf a peon and it's
[2:52:38.460 --> 2:52:44.060]  just really sad and as Mexico unravels as it falls apart more and more of these poor
[2:52:44.060 --> 2:52:49.500]  people come up here drives down wages further so it's a quite a mess do Carlos ever get
[2:52:49.500 --> 2:52:57.940]  back in John said again Carlos ever get back in no he dropped off I wanted to hear from
[2:52:57.940 --> 2:53:02.580]  him Steve in Arizona you're on the air go ahead oh sorry but Steve on hold I didn't
[2:53:02.580 --> 2:53:09.140]  see that Brian disagrees so we'll put him on for a minute first people that disagree
[2:53:09.140 --> 2:53:13.860]  go to the preferential treatment which isn't right but we do it go ahead you're on the
[2:53:13.860 --> 2:53:19.580]  air Brian I got a small funding a fundamental disagreement on 9-11 as proposed in one of
[2:53:19.580 --> 2:53:24.620]  your films I like most of them in fact I just caught the new one America or the old one
[2:53:24.620 --> 2:53:28.540]  one of the first ones America destroyed by design which I thought was really enlightening
[2:53:28.540 --> 2:53:33.340]  about the park now they've been turned over to the to the UN that's all in effect that's
[2:53:33.340 --> 2:53:38.780]  all in official executive orders oh I know I've read him but my disagreement is with
[2:53:38.780 --> 2:53:44.980]  you in in the newest film of the the the most recent loose change one they didn't go into
[2:53:44.980 --> 2:53:52.220]  enough enough depth on the Pentagon and pharmacist people had more information I spoke to Craig
[2:53:52.220 --> 2:53:58.260]  Ranky and although of the pentacon dot com out in California and at the payment Monte
[2:53:58.260 --> 2:54:02.980]  Hita's truth rally over a year ago they had actual footage where they interviewed on
[2:54:02.980 --> 2:54:08.340]  site the Pentagon police officers it said the plane came in on the north side which debunked
[2:54:08.340 --> 2:54:13.660]  the government's official story they've got 13 other north side witnesses it thought come
[2:54:13.660 --> 2:54:22.740]  in over the Navy annex and well look I mean listen nothing single-handedly I mean this
[2:54:22.740 --> 2:54:34.900]  radio show my wonderful listeners total have had a bigger effect than the loose change phenomenon
[2:54:34.900 --> 2:54:41.340]  but nothing single-handedly has woken up more people had a bigger effect than loose change
[2:54:41.340 --> 2:54:47.140]  second edition and now loose change final cut the first edition really was kind of an
[2:54:47.140 --> 2:54:53.500]  underground deal most people I didn't see that and second edition was much better was
[2:54:53.500 --> 2:54:58.980]  it perfect or my film is perfect no but but you know 98% accurate going on the right direction
[2:54:58.980 --> 2:55:05.540]  you know the official story is definitely a fraud but to say that you guys didn't do
[2:55:05.540 --> 2:55:12.980]  enough for you guys didn't make the right film it's hard making a film it's hard you
[2:55:12.980 --> 2:55:19.580]  know getting all this stuff done and it was loose change second edition that really exposed
[2:55:19.580 --> 2:55:28.580]  the Pentagon and so to then say that they somehow it's kind of like we're on the football field
[2:55:28.580 --> 2:55:33.820]  and we've run of six touchdowns seven touchdowns and and and other people are in the nose bleed
[2:55:33.820 --> 2:55:40.220]  seats with a curves light and a hot dog I just knocked something off the table here oh thank
[2:55:40.220 --> 2:55:49.020]  God this dressing didn't bust open going you should have run the shotgun I formation you
[2:55:49.020 --> 2:55:53.740]  know I think you should have put in you know this this linebacker other than that one or
[2:55:53.740 --> 2:56:00.900]  this runner and I mean frankly I'm doing everything I can do and the loose change guys doing everything
[2:56:00.900 --> 2:56:10.780]  they can do and I just think it's a distraction to say you had this you had that I know they
[2:56:10.780 --> 2:56:14.860]  had some interviews but they couldn't vet them they couldn't confirm them you know they
[2:56:14.860 --> 2:56:19.740]  couldn't put everything in that film they also had stuff like hard drives die on them
[2:56:19.740 --> 2:56:24.180]  and it was hard even getting that film out it was a three-ring circus while the guys
[2:56:24.180 --> 2:56:28.500]  were going around and speaking and doing radio interviews and having groupies show up out
[2:56:28.500 --> 2:56:34.780]  there and you know all the rest of it yeah but I mean hell I'm sorry I'm bad what can
[2:56:34.780 --> 2:56:39.580]  I do for you I haven't done enough no no it's true we're bad we're covering up the truth
[2:56:39.580 --> 2:56:43.740]  but anyways what else is going on you probably didn't know all I asked is can you have the
[2:56:43.740 --> 2:56:50.220]  people from the Pentagon on or April Gallup that's it April Gallup who that name rings
[2:56:50.220 --> 2:56:55.540]  a bell she was pulled through the hole yeah that's right and then that's right maternity
[2:56:55.540 --> 2:57:01.300]  leave I know April Gallup is yeah sure I believe we've tried to get April Gallup on you know
[2:57:01.300 --> 2:57:06.180]  it doesn't mean that people just come on the show there's a lot of people that we tried
[2:57:06.180 --> 2:57:12.140]  to get on but we'll we'll do that again April Gallup that's actually a good guess to have
[2:57:12.140 --> 2:57:16.620]  on will you make sure that Trey gets down I'm sure he's on their listing okay anything
[2:57:16.620 --> 2:57:21.500]  else I can do for you I will say I will say one more thing I was holding Luke Luke's
[2:57:21.500 --> 2:57:26.700]  camera up there in Denver and in no way did you say kill Michelle Malcolm I videotape
[2:57:26.700 --> 2:57:31.020]  the whole thing well thank you sir I appreciate that for you saying that but we all know that's
[2:57:31.020 --> 2:57:36.500]  a lie we all know I paid you to say that it doesn't matter what all the video shows I'm
[2:57:36.500 --> 2:57:42.580]  not saying it doesn't matter people with her said it I'm evil and you know what I'm happy
[2:57:42.580 --> 2:57:52.420]  to be the bad guy I didn't say it but if you want to say I said it it's fine okay Carlos
[2:57:52.420 --> 2:57:58.860]  is back Carlos is back okay Carlos tell us what's happening in Mexico oh hey I like sorry
[2:57:58.860 --> 2:58:03.860]  about that phone bill it's really sorry about that okay go ahead yeah because of violence
[2:58:03.860 --> 2:58:07.380]  so I have a lot of family back in there and she while she while right the heart of central
[2:58:07.380 --> 2:58:13.260]  of really all the violence that you know my grandparents uncle the last year my my father's
[2:58:13.260 --> 2:58:17.940]  cousin um got picked up and as you know the hijackings and the you know abductions are
[2:58:17.940 --> 2:58:22.060]  at sky high right now he abducted right next to his house they found his body the next
[2:58:22.060 --> 2:58:27.700]  day you know shot again execution style matches like I said it's touched home and um having
[2:58:27.700 --> 2:58:31.740]  so much family down in Mexico you know I basically grew up in the drug violence you know it's
[2:58:31.740 --> 2:58:37.140]  a lot it's like proper a lot of people people live on down there so you know this drug prohibition
[2:58:37.140 --> 2:58:40.140]  the United States is destroying the Latin American countries and started really down
[2:58:40.140 --> 2:58:43.300]  in South America with Columbia and all those countries and as you know it's just it's moving
[2:58:43.300 --> 2:58:46.980]  closer and closer to the United States you know yeah well that's that's that's what
[2:58:46.980 --> 2:58:53.420]  COG did is they made drugs illegal and they set up continental government to battle drugs
[2:58:53.420 --> 2:58:57.940]  while the CIA is always being caught with crashing airplanes and trucks full of cocaine
[2:58:57.940 --> 2:59:03.340]  and heroin our troops openly guard the poppy fields in Afghanistan is eight you know eight
[2:59:03.340 --> 2:59:08.380]  times what was being produced during the Taliban is now being produced I mean again Richard
[2:59:08.380 --> 2:59:13.340]  Grasso head of the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 goes to the FARC guerrillas and says
[2:59:13.340 --> 2:59:18.260]  invest your drug money with us they had a law passed in the US to make it legal and
[2:59:18.260 --> 2:59:22.940]  then they make drugs illegal so it makes a huge black market it makes it energizes criminal
[2:59:22.940 --> 2:59:26.940]  gangs it makes them fight with each other and then you have the US and Columbia and
[2:59:26.940 --> 2:59:35.140]  Mexico and Nicaragua El Salvador in Peru all down there killing each other over the
[2:59:35.140 --> 2:59:41.740]  cocaine marijuana and heroin and and and it's a perfect system to wreck the societies
[2:59:41.740 --> 2:59:47.340]  just like they made alcohol illegal and it turned out that it was big Canadian breweries
[2:59:47.340 --> 2:59:52.420]  and whiskey makers distilleries that had helped get it passed knowing it would quadruple their
[2:59:52.420 --> 3:00:00.580]  and alcoholism tripled prices more than quadrupled it energized the the the the the feds their
[3:00:00.580 --> 3:00:05.980]  excuse their their their prerogative to go out and do stuff and energize the mafia corrupted
[3:00:05.980 --> 3:00:10.460]  the police and and there and but I mean it isn't enough for the drug dealers they're
[3:00:10.460 --> 3:00:14.180]  going to ship drugs in and they're going to put you in jail if you're caught using them
[3:00:14.180 --> 3:00:19.260]  in their private prisons that literally are owned by the money laundering banks and they're
[3:00:19.260 --> 3:00:23.260]  going to take your pension funds and they're going to take all the money out of the Pentagon
[3:00:23.260 --> 3:00:27.060]  and they're going to do it because they've got the weapons and that's it until the dumb
[3:00:27.060 --> 3:00:31.220]  public stops going along with it stops living in La La Land it's only going to get worse
[3:00:31.220 --> 3:00:36.260]  but Carlos tell me more about what's happening in Mexico well as you know the drug war is
[3:00:36.260 --> 3:00:40.020]  basically the driving force behind the police state so you're you're seeing a lot more military
[3:00:40.020 --> 3:00:43.940]  and cops running around everywhere and you know people think it's good but a lot of these
[3:00:43.940 --> 3:00:47.140]  cops are just corrupted the drug dealers themselves you know and again the US takes
[3:00:47.140 --> 3:00:51.100]  fiat dollars that Americans are going to have to pay right pay for and for the interest
[3:00:51.100 --> 3:00:57.900]  on and then just gives tens of millions a year to Mexico to do it so sick so it's just
[3:00:57.900 --> 3:01:02.260]  like Columbia all over again it's just the exact same thing I read um was it Paul Scott's
[3:01:02.260 --> 3:01:05.940]  uh cocaine politics in Central America and uh it was a great book I read that was like
[3:01:05.940 --> 3:01:10.860]  when I was like 16 and it's just it's the exact same as in Colombia it's just you know
[3:01:10.860 --> 3:01:14.300]  just like the 1920s without criminal prohibition it's happening all over again just at a larger
[3:01:14.300 --> 3:01:19.420]  scale and you know people need to wake up to wake up any other stories you want to tell
[3:01:19.420 --> 3:01:24.860]  us about what's happening in Mexico I mean French news agency reports 2000 dead just
[3:01:24.860 --> 3:01:30.020]  in two towns on the Texas border hundreds dead on this side mass death rocket attacks
[3:01:30.020 --> 3:01:34.820]  hand grenade attacks on the US side total media block out here in the US other than
[3:01:34.820 --> 3:01:41.060]  local papers uh it's freedom anything else you want to add Carlos just having Mexican
[3:01:41.060 --> 3:01:44.660]  parents I hear about these stories every morning you know every morning well hold on we're
[3:01:44.660 --> 3:01:49.060]  going to keep talking during the break here uh Carlos I mean keep telling me what's keep
[3:01:49.060 --> 3:01:52.860]  telling the folks what's happening you know we need to add drug prohibition that it's
[3:01:52.860 --> 3:01:57.740]  just destroying our youth destroying this country and it's it's horrible it's horrible
[3:01:57.740 --> 3:02:02.740]  Alex I at this point I can't stress enough we need to add drug prohibition that's going
[3:02:02.740 --> 3:02:06.740]  to be one major you know tool that the new world order will be you know not be going
[3:02:06.740 --> 3:02:10.540]  to use anymore because that's really what they use is you know a tool to inflate us
[3:02:10.540 --> 3:02:15.980]  and drug prohibition is just that well it's the excuse to get involved in people's lives
[3:02:15.980 --> 3:02:20.020]  I mean first it was we got to stop people brewing whiskey a lot of whiskey tax so they
[3:02:20.020 --> 3:02:25.980]  created the BATF the uh the uh revenue as they were called and then it was we're going
[3:02:25.980 --> 3:02:31.420]  to create all these other agencies and they just create more and more of them to go around
[3:02:31.420 --> 3:02:38.860]  eating out our substance yeah yeah exactly yeah and the more they get involved in our
[3:02:38.860 --> 3:02:43.340]  life the worse all the problems get but from their view is it a problem shipping in more
[3:02:43.340 --> 3:02:48.780]  drugs is it a problem putting people in prison no that is a big victory for them it is make
[3:02:48.780 --> 3:02:54.580]  it is modern slavery through drug prohibition God bless you thank you Alex you about good
[3:02:54.580 --> 3:02:59.900]  to hear from you Carlos let's talk to Steve in Arizona you're on the air go ahead Steve
[3:02:59.900 --> 3:03:05.460]  hey Alex how you doing great to talk to you my man listen uh I'm homeless on the forest
[3:03:05.460 --> 3:03:10.660]  do a foreclosure uh from a house that we're renting but um we're still keeping the faith
[3:03:10.660 --> 3:03:15.060]  uh me and my kids and my wife will help you out here and uh I can't listen to you on
[3:03:15.060 --> 3:03:18.740]  the phone so I'll get to the type unless I go into town I can't uh get behind the scenes
[3:03:18.740 --> 3:03:22.900]  on the internet um but I just want to tell you I don't care what anybody else says you
[3:03:22.900 --> 3:03:27.700]  know they call with disagreements you're doing a great job well all your films um and I just
[3:03:27.700 --> 3:03:33.140]  wanted to ask you about uh basically since since Reagan with Bush uh Bush senior being
[3:03:33.140 --> 3:03:38.020]  the vice president they've been in the White House for about 30 years and um I'm just wondering
[3:03:38.020 --> 3:03:41.980]  it what your take is on that as far as uh yeah well they are the continuity of government
[3:03:41.980 --> 3:03:46.820]  it was Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld that set up the current plan for martial law through
[3:03:46.820 --> 3:03:51.980]  drug prohibition as the front to get rid of Posse commentatus now you see generals and
[3:03:51.980 --> 3:03:57.180]  admirals you know running most of the agencies and running local universities uh and and and
[3:03:57.180 --> 3:04:02.100]  this is the bomb makers the weapon makers with the bankers are just taken over and so
[3:04:02.100 --> 3:04:06.580]  Ronald Reagan George Bush senior Bill Clinton they're all just the titular heads of the figure
[3:04:06.580 --> 3:04:13.860]  heads uh for military rule for the bankers of the country the country is in receivership
[3:04:13.860 --> 3:04:20.580]  we're being conquered like a third world nation right right and I wanted to know was uh what
[3:04:20.580 --> 3:04:25.060]  your take is as far as you know with that whole family with them you know being cousins and and
[3:04:25.060 --> 3:04:29.860]  just all the them being in power for this long you know in the United States even though they're
[3:04:29.860 --> 3:04:34.740]  the puppets yeah it's just a sign of that even their puppets staying power it's just a bank
[3:04:34.740 --> 3:04:39.940]  rupture I want to know if what you take was as far as uh if I think they're getting that much
[3:04:39.940 --> 3:04:44.660]  a lot before McCain or Obama all right let me comment on that let me comment on that I appreciate
[3:04:44.660 --> 3:05:00.740]  your call
[3:05:16.740 --> 3:05:17.940]  you know it's one thing
[3:05:22.820 --> 3:05:28.260]  it's one thing to talk about how the international banking crime syndicate
[3:05:29.060 --> 3:05:32.820]  is going to set up a police state so they can loot the treasury and implode the country
[3:05:35.860 --> 3:05:41.060]  it's one thing to know that's their plans another thing to see them doing it it's another thing you
[3:05:41.060 --> 3:05:45.220]  know to be here it's kind of like you're waiting to be executed you're now we're being led up to the
[3:05:45.220 --> 3:05:52.820]  gallows that's a whole another thing and the caller was saying I think they'll have martial law
[3:05:52.820 --> 3:05:57.540]  before the election hey they snuck attack Russia a month ago they could do anything
[3:05:59.220 --> 3:06:05.860]  the globalist did uh they just bankrupt fanny may and freddy mack and a bunch of other companies
[3:06:05.860 --> 3:06:12.100]  that in the last week and a bunch of other consortium slush funds uh they could do anything and
[3:06:12.100 --> 3:06:16.180]  everything these people are bold they fly remote control aircraft into buildings I mean these are
