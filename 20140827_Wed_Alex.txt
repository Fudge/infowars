[01:39.600 --> 01:44.000]  talk about that subject give us your take but when it's a free-for-all all I ask is you have a good
[01:44.000 --> 01:52.640]  telephone and when you hear the that means we're going to you that you talk to me like you're
[01:52.640 --> 01:56.560]  explaining to me what your question is because sometimes when we have a free-for-all people
[01:56.560 --> 02:00.720]  call in and just start talking about subjects that I don't even know what they're talking about
[02:00.720 --> 02:04.640]  and I know the listeners don't in most cases I'm sure there's somebody out there that knows what

[02:21.760 --> 02:28.880]  away shadows and and a and a portend of what's obviously coming in the future why did that
[02:28.880 --> 02:35.920]  end differently than places like Ferguson we ended up having two additional shooting deaths by the
[02:35.920 --> 02:41.520]  police that in both cases appeared to be people threatening to assault them why did that not go
[02:42.160 --> 02:48.400]  haywire in this case as the fegs expand their land grabbing so pop in for 30 minutes at the

[03:09.120 --> 03:15.200]  understand how advertising how establishment advertising works so we're going to look at some
[03:15.200 --> 03:22.560]  of the mind control today as well obviously in big news the IMF chief has been charged with
[03:22.560 --> 03:30.400]  negligence over graft case well that is just classic and it begins the council on farm relations
[03:31.200 --> 03:38.080]  is calling for the mega banks private fellow reserve to issue cash directly to the american
[03:38.080 --> 03:43.120]  people training us to love our new government that's been our government since 1913 they're just

[03:49.120 --> 03:56.640]  all up on info wars dot com and this is done so that when they start quote taking people's
[03:56.640 --> 04:03.040]  private pensions and bank accounts to collectivize them to protect them that's in quotes this has
[04:03.040 --> 04:09.120]  been the model in third world countries in now europe that the giant massive people that actually
[04:09.120 --> 04:15.520]  get a little piece of it who actually get a check from the private fellow reserve will then say oh
[04:15.520 --> 04:20.960]  yeah take over the economy why they're the folks a few years ago that sent us checks they'll send
[04:20.960 --> 04:28.400]  you fiat checks that accelerate the devaluation of earning power they've already given themselves

[10:09.760 --> 10:15.520]  unrest in the country why did this end up being peaceful versus ferguson with the deaths and
[10:15.520 --> 10:27.280]  injuries up there all that and more is coming up today let's first begin with just some of the
[10:27.280 --> 10:33.440]  headlines here that i'm going to read through peace president plots war on syria the obama
[10:33.440 --> 10:38.800]  administration is reportedly preparing to begin airstrikes on syrian territory without the consent
[10:38.800 --> 10:44.320]  of the syrian government claiming they need to take out the ish al qaeda forces that were funded
[10:44.320 --> 10:51.200]  by nato and our own government in the last four years the topple asad the same al qaeda forces
[10:51.200 --> 10:55.760]  that got caught according to even turkish and british news we first broke it of course and
[10:55.760 --> 11:03.200]  info wars dot com launching fake chemical attacks was real chemicals but but faking it saying asad
[11:03.200 --> 11:14.240]  had done it was pretty obvious uh whenever obama came out about a year before two years ago and
[11:14.240 --> 11:18.800]  said if any chemical weapons get used we're going to bomb the government and take over for the rebels
[11:19.600 --> 11:25.680]  and so then three times the rebels fired chemical weapons traced back even by the un weapons
[11:25.680 --> 11:32.800]  inspectors the saudi arabian chemicals this is in the bbc this is in the turkish daily papers
[11:32.800 --> 11:38.800]  this came out and the whole thing got shut down so now they're back wanting to bomb syria
[11:39.760 --> 11:45.280]  and having us aircraft fly over with the cover of the american people wanting isis who's killed
[11:45.280 --> 11:52.160]  300 000 plus people mainly christians in syria dealt with but who gave them bases in eastern
[11:52.160 --> 12:01.040]  or in western iraq to go into eastern syria nato the globalist obama that's a fact this is a real
[12:01.040 --> 12:05.280]  test to the american people and the people of the west are we as politically ignorant and
[12:05.280 --> 12:14.880]  politically illiterate as the political ruling class thinks we are will they bomb the syrian
[12:14.880 --> 12:20.960]  military that lets christians and jews and non radical muslims live in peace and their government
[12:20.960 --> 12:25.600]  doesn't wear burqas and wear suits and ties and women can go to college and not wear hoods on their
[12:25.600 --> 12:31.920]  heads will the liberal west keep trying to overthrow governments that are doing nothing to us that are
[12:31.920 --> 12:39.440]  angelic compared to al-qaeda they're picking out the targets they're getting ready to overthrow
[12:39.440 --> 12:45.280]  the syrian government you watch islamic state video indicates terror group has sophisticated
[12:45.280 --> 12:51.440]  drones they release videos showing their brigades marching and their drones going in so they can
[12:51.440 --> 12:59.200]  target Assad's forces and u.s. forces now in iraq oh by the way it's a real enemy i mean they're
[12:59.200 --> 13:03.040]  going to kill advisors they're going to kill contractors they're these people killed us
[13:03.040 --> 13:08.400]  troops before they bragged about it when they took over libya they said next stop syria
[13:08.400 --> 13:16.480]  vending united states and now we're being told brace for terror attacks in america with is continuing
[13:18.400 --> 13:23.520]  american man reportedly killed fighting for isis dies in syria one of three foreign fighters
[13:23.520 --> 13:32.400]  alleged and aligned with islamic state forces killed in battle in syria fighting syrian forces
[13:32.400 --> 13:39.440]  the truth is america passed the test we've not been proven totally politically and geopolitically
[13:39.440 --> 13:45.120]  illiterate win our own military and our own political class to a great extent rejected openly
[13:45.120 --> 13:52.400]  becoming al-qaeda's air force or is his air force in syria last year continuing gold ends
[13:52.400 --> 13:59.280]  firmer on short covering bargain hunting silver also slightly up as dollar devaluation news
[13:59.280 --> 14:06.080]  since other commodities up as well coast guard cutter fires warning shot at iranian
[14:06.080 --> 14:12.320]  sailboat in brief altercation no it wasn't an iranian boat off the u.s coast it was off the
[14:12.320 --> 14:17.280]  iranian coast coast guards all the way over there coast guard cutter fires warning shot
[14:17.280 --> 14:22.560]  at iranian sailboat in brief altercation claiming that they aim some type of submachine gun at them
[14:22.560 --> 14:28.480]  going back to syria west unlikely to seek Assad's help against isis
[14:29.600 --> 14:35.520]  unlikely western countries will collaborate with Assad to combat isis that's really a sick
[14:35.520 --> 14:41.920]  joke now that the west is so upset that the public knows that they're running al-qaeda this is all a
[14:41.920 --> 14:47.920]  bunch of elaborate baloney bomb a toyota truck bomb an old piece of artillery never do i see
[14:47.920 --> 14:52.880]  troops running away never do i see al-qaeda dead on the ground flopping around blood spraying out
[14:52.880 --> 14:59.440]  like you do on the other infrared videos all i see are flare videos all i see is staged events
[14:59.440 --> 15:05.920]  they're not bombing isis ladies and gentlemen they put them there they armed them they work for
[15:05.920 --> 15:14.400]  saudi arabia and as usual saudi arabia reportedly attacks us on 9 11 we attack iraq al-qaeda is
[15:14.400 --> 15:20.960]  attacking syria we attack syria because saudi arabia is puppeteering this country to a great
[15:20.960 --> 15:27.200]  extent it is disgusting all right so there's that stack of news i'm going to your calls the next
[15:27.200 --> 15:33.200]  segment let me just continue moving right along here ferguson investigates
[15:36.000 --> 15:41.600]  and it's a investigation out of fusion dot net how did america's police departments
[15:41.600 --> 15:48.960]  lose loads of military-issued weapons i'll tell you they sold them out the back door for money
[15:48.960 --> 15:53.360]  just like most police departments when they do gun buybacks end up selling them out the back door
[15:54.800 --> 16:01.680]  and there's all these articles here's another one uh out today out of cbs news davis city council
[16:01.680 --> 16:08.160]  tells police in california to have planned for getting rid of their in rap military vehicle in
[16:08.160 --> 16:13.440]  the next 60 days the public asked why are you getting wheeled tanks and automatic weapons for us
[16:13.440 --> 16:20.080]  which is an important question but congress is now investigating this it's like blaming the tsa
[16:20.080 --> 16:26.240]  that's groping you and congress passes laws to carry this out or it's like blaming the police
[16:26.240 --> 16:31.120]  when they're given the federal training the feds are coming in to federalize police now
[16:31.120 --> 16:36.160]  after giving them this martial law training that turns the public against them then the feds will
[16:36.160 --> 16:42.080]  come in federalizing the police in the name of fixing the problem they basically created it was
[16:42.080 --> 16:50.160]  like oh in ferguson last week in missouri think heaven uh obama has sent holder here he'll fix it
[16:52.240 --> 16:57.360]  holder was clearly involved in the oklahoma city cover up if it was really involved i've interviewed
[16:57.360 --> 17:02.480]  the oklahoma city police officers that witnessed it his deputy had he was deputy attorney general
[17:02.480 --> 17:07.600]  now attorney general holder has been involved in fast and furious everything else you can
[17:07.600 --> 17:13.520]  imagine covering up all the trillions being looted in the last seven years covering up all the
[17:13.520 --> 17:23.600]  executive abuses and accelerating the federalization of police at light speed and now there's all
[17:23.600 --> 17:29.280]  these articles demonizing local police and all these national news stories showing police brutality
[17:29.280 --> 17:35.520]  and taser deaths after the federal grants paid for all of it and the threat fusion centers and the
[17:35.520 --> 17:41.600]  military training and the uniforms and and the doctrine and shifting away from crime fighting
[17:41.600 --> 17:48.400]  to revenue generating that is all globalist doctrine so they turn the police into their own
[17:48.400 --> 17:53.840]  tool and then after the public turns against them the feds come in as the saviors so just be aware
[17:53.840 --> 17:59.920]  of the larger scythe i'm not defending the militarization of police i am the trailblazer
[17:59.920 --> 18:05.600]  on record for 19 years exposing the police state i warned you of the cog of the kill
[18:05.600 --> 18:10.160]  switches in the computers of tracking and taxing you by the mile i warned you of blood draws to
[18:10.160 --> 18:15.520]  get driver's license that's now starting in dc last year i warned you of everything because it
[18:15.520 --> 18:22.080]  was in government documents i learned in 1998 of secret microphones being put in light poles
[18:22.080 --> 18:28.320]  from chicago illinois to austin texas it's now mainstream news this year cbs news associated
[18:28.320 --> 18:37.200]  press i don't have a crystal ball i don't sit there on a black pot staring into it reading tea
[18:37.200 --> 18:44.720]  leaves this is all a technotronic technocracy takeover i've read five brazinski books he basically
[18:44.720 --> 18:49.760]  runs the show as the council on farm relations admits he and henry kissinger the head of the
[18:49.760 --> 18:57.600]  national security council general jones five years ago five years ago in 2009 openly told
[18:57.600 --> 19:02.400]  british newspapers that they get their orders from the council on farm relations at henry kissinger
[19:02.400 --> 19:11.040]  daily now the council on farm relations leadership their central board the rest is influence peddling
[19:11.040 --> 19:15.200]  and her minions and camp followers has been expanded over 10 000 people now but the top
[19:15.200 --> 19:22.080]  100 or so they decide when the satellite tracker box goes in your car it's in there by law now
[19:22.080 --> 19:27.920]  they decide when the banks start grabbing your private money they decide i mean here it is today
[19:27.920 --> 19:33.040]  council on farm relations calls for uh central banks and totally openly take over the government
[19:33.040 --> 19:37.520]  and be covering that here's another one dot department transportation proposes mandating

[28:06.400 --> 28:14.000]  directly so they've already given themselves conservatively 200 trillion dollars just since
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.440]  2008 and the banker bailout now it was a lot more than 876 billion that was the federal reserve
[28:21.440 --> 28:30.160]  open window that was only one one move when you talk about s dr's and we talk about free credit
[28:30.160 --> 28:35.280]  being given out to the big six central banks it's over 200 trillion the total of derivatives they've
[28:35.280 --> 28:40.880]  created according to us say today three years ago we haven't gotten new numbers since then
[28:40.880 --> 28:53.360]  from the general accounting office is 1.5 quadrille that's 1500 trillion over 100 times all the real
[28:53.360 --> 28:59.040]  wealth in the world and that's what they've signed us on to americans have been signed on
[29:00.320 --> 29:07.520]  to over 70 of that debt they claim we owe when you're about 18 or 19 trillion a national debt
[29:07.520 --> 29:13.360]  that's what they currently owe and what entitlements and real debts are that's our real debt
[29:14.400 --> 29:18.800]  and you could extend that out to 200 trillion if you look at the whole life of those entitlements
[29:18.800 --> 29:24.720]  and social security the rest of it so but forget that's off the table derivatives are what these
[29:24.720 --> 29:29.840]  bankers have created and they've used that to buy up the world through fraud now they're about to
[29:29.840 --> 29:35.520]  drop the hammer and devalue so they're going to start sending out they're discussing checks from

[34:21.520 --> 34:27.280]  replace google and microsoft with homegrown os their own operating system what do you think google

[34:32.800 --> 34:39.120]  one global tyranny with their own global tyranny we also have another report here forget peak oil
[34:39.120 --> 34:46.480]  and peak credit we are on the downslope of peak intelligence and major studies show that we're
[34:46.480 --> 34:52.240]  going to be breaking some of that down and the social engineers have come out the radical plan
[34:52.240 --> 34:58.720]  to phase out earth's predatory species and not just domesticates humans to be docile for the
[34:58.720 --> 35:04.480]  super predator class the globalist but to make animals to where they can't be predators like
[35:04.480 --> 35:09.840]  cheetahs and wolves and then i guess watch them all starve to death because i guess inherently
[35:09.840 --> 35:15.760]  predatory activity is evil no it's any predatory activity not carried out by the new world order
[35:15.760 --> 35:21.280]  is evil i guess when a gazelle eats grass it's being predatory so the only way to stop that
[35:21.280 --> 35:28.080]  is to kill all life on earth you know if you want to get an alice shone's quote here's one that hit
[35:28.080 --> 35:37.280]  me the other day and it's this life gave birth to death god gave birth to life
[35:41.200 --> 35:49.120]  and life gave birth to death because there is no death if there's not life life is the full
[35:49.120 --> 35:56.400]  continuum the the full spectrum and then death is only an aspect of life you could say that life
[35:56.400 --> 36:03.520]  is the universe experiencing consciousness through a physical third dimensional manifestation
[36:05.280 --> 36:06.080]  but i know this
[36:08.800 --> 36:13.920]  the new world order and their jumbo jets and their red carpets and hollywood stars
[36:13.920 --> 36:20.800]  is not the end all be all of this world and unfortunately most people never get to figure
[36:20.800 --> 36:28.880]  that out because they never attain entrance or entree into that and so they're always imagining it
[36:28.880 --> 36:36.480]  as the fabled grass that is greener on the other side of the valley and so they feel
[36:36.480 --> 36:42.240]  unfulfilled and that is the essence of globalist programming the essence of their conditioning
[36:42.240 --> 36:48.080]  and their manipulation and i will cover it in the third hour today but now without further ado
[36:48.080 --> 36:52.880]  i'm going to go to your calls and i'm going to move the next person and then as you hear
[36:52.880 --> 36:56.880]  callers hang up that's your chance to call in i'd love to hear from you first time callers
[36:56.880 --> 37:07.600]  800-259-9231 let's go to a caller in florida first let's go to glenn glenn you're on the
[37:07.600 --> 37:15.200]  year worldwide alex first time caller long time listener um i want to bring to your attention
[37:15.200 --> 37:22.960]  i'm sure you've seen the things on the currency the uh the 10 the 50 and 100 dollar bill um all
[37:22.960 --> 37:27.840]  three of them have some kind of false flag on them this has been pointed out by a man named
[37:27.840 --> 37:35.200]  jonathan cleck i highly encourage people to check out his videos um on the 10 it appears that there's
[37:35.200 --> 37:42.320]  a tsunami hitting an coastal city i believe this to be miami it's something you can research there's
[37:42.320 --> 37:48.240]  something called miami is the last point in the pentagram that you can check out on youtube
[37:49.120 --> 37:56.160]  number two is the 50 which appears to be hoover dam being hit and the other one is the 100 the
[37:56.160 --> 38:04.400]  new 100 which has a picture of new york city it appears being hit by a tsunami now on with with
[38:04.400 --> 38:10.480]  all three one of the things that i don't know if you've ever thought about um the idea that
[38:10.480 --> 38:17.360]  the enemy likes to broadcast what they're about to do and in turn they can it's like it's like a
[38:17.360 --> 38:23.920]  firefighter setting a fire um they set the fire come in and look like the hero what if all three
[38:23.920 --> 38:31.360]  of these false flags were thwarted somehow and this was an attempt to get us to go along with the
[38:31.360 --> 38:37.040]  new world order get along uh go along with all the security measures that we have in place
[38:37.040 --> 38:44.560]  and make perhaps uh the president look like the hero well i listen i appreciate your call
[38:45.120 --> 38:50.240]  that's pretty esoteric for the first call out of the gate so let me just briefly for new listeners
[38:52.560 --> 38:56.800]  basically break down what you're talking about i know that the global elites are into
[38:56.800 --> 39:03.120]  numerology they are obsessed with hiding what they're going to do in plain view if you look at
[39:03.120 --> 39:07.760]  some of the new money that came out right before 9 11 it looks just like the world trade center
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.160]  towers falling if you look at some of the new money that's come out it looks just like hoover
[39:12.160 --> 39:19.760]  dam it looks like tsunamis it looks like the pentagon being hit it is extremely scary and then
[39:19.760 --> 39:27.600]  you realize that the old money that we had since 1913 or so had all sorts of hidden images and keys
[39:27.600 --> 39:34.960]  and owls and skeletons and pentagrams and that a lot of the engravers the globalists believe
[39:34.960 --> 39:40.400]  money has power because it passes between hands as the symbol of their power and for really hundreds
[39:40.400 --> 39:46.560]  of years paper money has that all sorts of secret symbols on it so so so undoubtedly there's something
[39:46.560 --> 39:54.400]  to that but anyone can then look at the new money and try to guess what the next target is if you
[39:54.400 --> 39:59.440]  want to talk about tsunami bombs it's been in the london telegraph it's been in the london guardian
[39:59.440 --> 40:04.720]  it's been in the washington post back in the mid 90s and then again just a few years ago you can
[40:04.720 --> 40:12.400]  type in u.s. government plans tsunami bombs and develop hydrogen bombs on key fault lines and
[40:12.400 --> 40:18.240]  things that would cause that to happen does that mean that most earthquakes uh are government made
[40:18.240 --> 40:23.680]  no there's always been earthquakes there's always been volcanoes there's always been meteorites hitting
[40:23.680 --> 40:29.520]  the earth and so i i just really don't go there a lot because you can't prove it one way or the
[40:29.520 --> 40:34.160]  other i could do youtube videos about this and they get millions of views and people are really into
[40:34.160 --> 40:39.520]  all this and i've studied it i've looked at it there's some real validity to it but it it's just
[40:39.520 --> 40:45.760]  something i can't prove what i can prove is that our president starting this year ordered the board
[40:45.760 --> 40:53.360]  of patrol to stand down only 70 of the people coming across our youth under 18 they are pouring
[40:53.360 --> 41:00.240]  in the border is wide open and the president is inviting them in and the governor of california
[41:00.240 --> 41:07.120]  jerry brown with the mexican president yesterday you're gonna play the clip come on if i cue that
[41:07.120 --> 41:13.840]  up if you can shed hey mexicans come on up here that that's crazy imagine if the french said hey
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.440]  germans anybody wants to come come here free welfare or imagine if canada said americans
[41:19.440 --> 41:23.600]  anybody that can come here come here you get free welfare well canada's kind of done that now
[41:23.600 --> 41:28.720]  with anybody that can get there from the third world so is the u.s so is europe and it's collapsing
[41:28.720 --> 41:34.000]  and the plan is get enough people in the country give them driver's license let them vote
[41:34.720 --> 41:38.320]  who are totally dependent on the government and what the government wants and its checkmate
[41:40.720 --> 41:45.760]  it's a diabolical plan it's incredible i can prove they ship guns into mexico to blame the
[41:45.760 --> 41:51.040]  second amendment i can prove the irs is persecuting people i can prove our government funded al-qaeda
[41:51.040 --> 41:56.720]  i can prove that don salazar wrote an article about fema building emergency domes for during
[41:56.720 --> 42:03.680]  crisis all over the u.s these are the models of the fema camp processing centers that were in
[42:03.680 --> 42:08.240]  the emergency centers establishment act bill we should probably add that to it
[42:08.240 --> 42:17.040]  fema building pricey domes for your safety clothes quote this is the government collapsing
[42:17.040 --> 42:23.760]  society offering the solution more control what happens what happens when the dollar gets
[42:23.760 --> 42:29.280]  devalued further what happens when they shut off the power plants and moved all the jobs
[42:29.280 --> 42:33.280]  to china which is already happening things are going to get worse and worse crimes can get
[42:33.280 --> 42:37.920]  higher and higher we're going to beg for a police state the middle class is and then it's going to
[42:37.920 --> 42:44.880]  double back and the in the police state will then be used on anyone who is not a globalist
[42:44.880 --> 42:50.720]  fellow traveler socialist communist that's grass roots the bankers are going to sit
[42:50.720 --> 43:00.240]  in luxenberg in switzerland in grand cayman in the cook islands laughing at us the elite of
[43:00.240 --> 43:05.520]  the world are leaving israel and leaving the united states they're going to switzerland
[43:05.520 --> 43:11.360]  they're going to england they're going to scotland they're going to montecarlo they
[43:11.360 --> 43:18.880]  are going to luxenberg and they've all got giant yachts with helicopters and sea planes on them
[43:18.880 --> 43:25.760]  and they're ready to live at sea for years i mean quite frankly i'm not gonna get into it
[43:26.320 --> 43:31.840]  i'm not gonna get into it but but that's the underground base of the future
[43:31.840 --> 43:40.880]  here is island highly armored ultra rich redoubts former greek islands you name it the globalist
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.200]  have been buying for billions and setting up command bases i mean this is a warrior in this is
[43:45.200 --> 43:49.280]  not a game they're getting ready for the singularity they're getting ready for the robots to basically
[43:49.280 --> 43:53.840]  displace the general public they're getting ready for the bio weapons release and if you're an fbi
[43:53.840 --> 43:57.840]  agent or a cop or a bureaucrat who thinks you're going to be part of the establishment and thinks
[43:57.840 --> 44:02.320]  you're going to make it through all this you're crazy or if you're compartmentalized and think

[44:23.520 --> 44:30.240]  roam because he liked to watch buildings burn why did hitler do what he did same reason why did
[44:30.240 --> 44:37.680]  mal kill 84 million people because he wanted to why did ted bundy grab teenage girls and torture
[44:37.680 --> 44:44.640]  the living daylights out of him because he liked it and all of you out there that are naive and
[44:44.640 --> 44:50.800]  think the establishment's like you and wants to watch espn all day and act cool all day or ride

[45:07.600 --> 45:15.680]  what you do and your kids are 60 percent and being successful 30 percent you know on and on and on

[45:21.840 --> 45:27.920]  they see you as an animal just using up resources in fact the elite openly say you have to declare
[45:27.920 --> 45:35.200]  yourself sentient declare yourself sovereign declare yourself not their slave before you even get
[45:35.200 --> 45:42.320]  their respect i have the illuminati's respect i have the new world order's respect you don't have

[45:49.040 --> 45:54.800]  that and you know what you do act like cattle but i will not play the game of feeding on you
[45:54.800 --> 46:00.400]  because that comes right back on me and my soul and my family name i will not curse my family
[46:01.040 --> 46:07.040]  but let me tell you i look at the evil wicked servile narcissistic population
[46:08.080 --> 46:11.600]  and compare you to the technocrats at least they know what they're doing i'm going to shut
[46:11.600 --> 46:19.120]  up go back to your calls who's up next from canada marcello in canada we're talking about society
[46:19.120 --> 46:22.560]  that's what you're calling in about thank you for calling in brother hey it's an honor to speak to you
[46:22.560 --> 46:27.120]  alex um yeah i just wanted to know like because like there's so much going on in the world right
[46:27.120 --> 46:32.640]  now there's so much chaos like i i want to talk to you about so much but like right now there's
[46:32.640 --> 46:36.720]  like major current like issues with our police department in montreal and they're like on strike
[46:36.720 --> 46:42.160]  and actually but the good news is uh you got burger king moving up there to the corporate
[46:42.160 --> 46:49.440]  headquarters about that get serious uh that's like the worst thing ever but anyways um yeah so like
[46:50.160 --> 46:54.080]  what happened was the police department like actually ransacked like uh city hall and like
[46:54.080 --> 46:58.560]  they started a fire outside because like they're on strike right now and like there hasn't been
[46:58.560 --> 47:03.840]  any really consequences and every time like people decide to protest they like were just
[47:03.840 --> 47:09.840]  throwing jail and slapped beforehand so like i totally don't agree with that and um no you're
[47:09.840 --> 47:15.680]  right though in in spain and in greece and a bunch of other european countries the last few years
[47:15.680 --> 47:21.440]  the police have been on strike and been rioting and also in france but not even because they
[47:21.440 --> 47:27.280]  had their pension funds being taken they were smart enough to see the pension funds being taken
[47:28.480 --> 47:33.440]  from the other state and federal agencies and knew they were next because they are always in
[47:33.440 --> 47:39.680]  variably next uh but yeah that's very hypocritical of the police to go out and attack peaceful
[47:39.680 --> 47:46.080]  demonstrators like i've seen them do in canada with my own eyeballs but then uh they're more
[47:46.080 --> 47:52.720]  than happy uh to go out and ransack things themselves i saw that in the news i also want to
[47:52.720 --> 47:57.200]  know like because i tried to search fast and furious because you always bring it up but i
[47:57.200 --> 48:01.600]  i can't find it i only find the big the movie what do you mean by that okay fast and furious and i
[48:01.600 --> 48:08.960]  appreciate your call was a program started in 2009 they gave press conferences big sis and holder
[48:08.960 --> 48:14.240]  about how they were doing a gun tracking program and then they got caught shipping the guns into
[48:14.240 --> 48:20.000]  mexico which was illegal then they said they didn't know anything and and then it came out cbs news
[48:20.000 --> 48:26.080]  got the documents the reporter published it then she got in trouble so she quit where they said we're
[48:26.080 --> 48:29.920]  going to do this to blame the second amendment that memo was going out to atf agents that were
[48:29.920 --> 48:34.400]  very upset they're like what are we doing shipping thousands of guns a month into mexico
[48:34.400 --> 48:38.960]  to drug cartels these are killing people and they said look it's in justifies the means we're going
[48:38.960 --> 48:44.800]  to use this for the to blame the second amendment for the violence of course the truth is mexico
[48:44.800 --> 48:52.320]  the real drug cartels have full auto armored vehicles uh gold uh golden sacks uh will mainly
[48:52.320 --> 49:02.480]  wakovia and um wells fargo if you look at the uh bloomberg articles they ship in uh the aircraft
[49:02.480 --> 49:06.800]  with the weapons on board and then they ship out because you want to make money both legs
[49:07.440 --> 49:13.760]  the cia brings american citizens down there for rendition to mexico to a mexican base and then
[49:13.760 --> 49:19.040]  they load the slaves go into death camps on those and fly them out of course they also load the kids
[49:19.040 --> 49:23.440]  the little kidnap kids on those you're a new listener and don't believe me just type in
[49:23.920 --> 49:34.640]  378 billion dollars laundered by wells fargo and wakovia in a two-year period and that article
[49:34.640 --> 49:39.360]  came out four years ago there was a bunch of articles about it the headline was big banks
[49:39.360 --> 49:46.320]  in deal uh uh uh over uh laundering drug cartel money but then you read the actual deal there
[49:46.320 --> 49:50.720]  it is how a big us bank laundered billions for mexico's murderous drug gangs yeah that's the
[49:50.720 --> 49:55.440]  guardian but it's not as strong as bloomberg report the bloomberg report goes off the actual federal
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.960]  federal deal and it just shows how they run the the aircraft and the logistics and they got guys in
[50:00.960 --> 50:08.640]  suits and top corporate managers imagine it's a 500 billion dollar a year north american economy
[50:08.640 --> 50:15.440]  there it is banks financing mexico's gangs admitted in wells fargo deal see people always
[50:15.440 --> 50:20.320]  say that hey there's no planes coming into the hood they're not laundering billions in the hood
[50:20.320 --> 50:26.720]  oh that's true no no it's done scientifically u.s military bases c 130s by the hundreds landing
[50:26.720 --> 50:32.320]  per month cocaine heroin and then little kids are put on and flown out on the special flights
[50:32.320 --> 50:36.880]  right to saudi arabia and there's people waiting with pliers to rip their teeth out
[50:36.880 --> 50:48.720]  but hey you know i'm an extremist you're all gonna understand soon won't show

[54:07.040 --> 54:10.160]  strange days
[54:10.160 --> 54:15.360]  here's a new list here you're going what on earth is this guy talking about
[54:16.160 --> 54:22.480]  i'd put on screen bloomberg we'll put it back on screen a detailed 20-something page report with
[54:22.480 --> 54:27.760]  links to government documents banks financing mexico drug gangs admitted in wells fargo deal
[54:29.680 --> 54:36.480]  and that goes back to 2010 four years ago june 28th now i already knew this i watched this in
[54:36.480 --> 54:42.640]  congressional hearings in 1997 i've watched congressional hearings in 2006 where they admitted
[54:42.640 --> 54:49.360]  that dinecore and other major companies were caught running rings of kidnapped women and
[54:49.360 --> 54:54.480]  children worldwide why do you think you can walk into an acron building famously and say i want
[54:54.480 --> 54:58.560]  to run child sex slaves through here they're like absolutely welcome to the team why do you think
[54:58.560 --> 55:06.560]  it's on info wars dot com the sexual abuse of 1400 children unreported due to racism fears in one
[55:06.560 --> 55:13.280]  town in england it's because the basic labor party over there with the so-called minorities
[55:13.280 --> 55:18.000]  was running and trafficking with you know all these kids and they don't want it coming out
[55:18.640 --> 55:22.880]  and they use the minorities as the red light district for kids
[55:22.880 --> 55:30.880]  and so i'm here covering all this and it sounds completely insane i have congressional hearings
[55:30.880 --> 55:38.880]  you can i played them probably 20 times here just type in defense secretary grilled on child
[55:38.880 --> 55:44.480]  kidnapping and they admit in the hearing yes dinecore got caught shipping thousands of kids out
[55:44.480 --> 55:50.880]  from one city alone in syria and yes they were given a fine they were not allowed to bid
[55:50.880 --> 55:58.880]  in that sector for one year that's a quote so i'm trying to explain something to you
[55:59.440 --> 56:05.760]  don't be so naive anymore of course the government was involved bombing oklahoma city and it's all
[56:05.760 --> 56:11.520]  come out of course they do that of course they'd shoot black people up a syphilis and let them
[56:11.520 --> 56:18.720]  die of it over 48 years with this gigi not the whole government criminal mafias eugenics death
[56:18.720 --> 56:26.160]  cult mafias operating at different strata using national security secrecy to protect themselves
[56:26.160 --> 56:32.960]  and nsa spy grids to find out when good parts of agencies or white hats are about to bust them
[56:35.120 --> 56:40.320]  can you imagine what the evil forces were able to do since 1947 when basically the whole government
[56:40.320 --> 56:49.280]  went secret with unlimited money with the national security act can you imagine the blackmail of
[56:49.280 --> 56:54.720]  congress that's going on that's all come out now the blackmail of of of parliament in england the
[56:54.720 --> 57:01.680]  blackmail in france the blackmail in germany we have a criminal kleptocratic global elite
[57:01.680 --> 57:08.800]  of six banks owned by less than 20 families who control almost the whole world right now
[57:08.800 --> 57:15.520]  and you might want to find out what their agenda is and what makes them tick what their modus operandi

[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:41.200]  coming up a ton of financial news also some bay area residents reported mysterious flashes on the
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:48.880]  sky during napaquake that's a well-known static electricity discharge when you've got massive
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.320]  mega billions of pounds or trillions of pounds of rock moving and all that static electricity of
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:01:00.400]  course you're going to see those type of disturbances in the atmosphere uh but let's go to tim in west
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:07.760]  virginia you're on the air go ahead uh yes alex uh the reported the shooting of a accidental shooting
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:15.680]  of a of a range instructor outside los vegas this morning uh supposedly a nine-year-old girl
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:23.200]  was firing a uzi full auto the recoil got away from her and she accidentally shot the instructor
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.280]  yeah that's real popular in vegas they got a bunch of those places where you can go shoot full auto
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:34.400]  and i just don't think it would be wise to give a child something like that um because uh yeah i mean
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.600]  it's like giving a woman there's a man who's ever shot a 12-gauge shotgun uh and they think you
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:43.920]  lightly hold it all you do is pull it into your shoulder pull the trigger uh but people that don't
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.120]  know uh i mean that's going to happen though guns are one of the least dangerous things statistically
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:55.600]  out there and so we shouldn't be blamed because somebody got killed made a mistake go ahead i got
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:02:02.160]  alex uh what wasn't this exactly the same thing that happened about 10 years ago is this a replay

[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:16.160]  happening before uh yes sir about eight or ten years ago it was a child involved firing a full
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:26.560]  auto uzi that accidentally uh shot the instructor from the recoil well stupidity does multiply
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:32.080]  itself uh but it could be a staged event and look they look all we know is the official sandy
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:37.840]  hook story is a fraud all we know is the official aurora story is a fraud it is a fraud i don't want

[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:51.440]  for calling in you're on the air yeah i prior to speak with you um maybe you mentioned it already
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:58.080]  i just missed it but what were your thoughts on the fully video to me it was obviously fake i
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:03.040]  just wondered what you thought about it the expert that that advises the british government came out
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:08.880]  three days ago on the one in telegraph you know monday and watson was on the show and covered
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:15.760]  it with david night and said it is undoubtedly fake and that it's even been manipulated in the video
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:21.760]  not photo shopping but it's been i mean look they they brought john wane back to pitch products
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:28.640]  they've they brought elvis back uh it's just like the running man where they shut up ben richards
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:32.880]  in that steven king novel that the film is based on when he refuses to kill the crowd
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:39.040]  they kill the crowd and blame him uh the underwear bomber video was completely fake where it shows
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:44.480]  him with the black hood over his head this looked like it was shot by steven spillberg it was so
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:52.160]  cinematic but isis really does cut heads off now they're saying it's at least a year old um
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:12:00.080]  it could be real they could have just taken it and souped it up see sometimes it's not that
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.680]  something's completely fake it's that it's been doctored and then people think the whole thing's
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:12.160]  fake i mean we take hd video we shoot if we have time and we'll mess with the color and stuff to
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:17.200]  make it more clear well people can then go in and see that that filter is over our video
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:22.080]  and say oh it must be green screened or something when we've never faked anything unless it's
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:27.360]  openly a joke we done some joke videos uh and i've quit doing a lot of those because people
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:32.480]  then conflate it with our real videos uh but who knows i mean why do you think it's fake
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:40.000]  well like you said the quality of it it looks correct uh they didn't show the whole process
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.040]  i mean did this guy even well that's the main video that they put out on the web that they've
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.760]  been censoring the sites that have the full thing i've watched the full thing and uh it's
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:55.120]  they're squealing and blood spraying and i've seen a lot of these beheadings uh you know obviously
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:01.440]  everybody has if you've covered the news i've seen them chop little kids heads off of course they
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:08.400]  don't put that on the news but i've seen it and i've also seen iraqi children bombed by our bombs
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:14.640]  with their lower mandibles blown off with the tongue wagging and uh and and literally become
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.240]  violently angry for two or three days i mean i don't mean i'm actually violent but uh
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:25.040]  in fact a few times i've been up there totally exhausted like midnight working on a film or
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:32.000]  something and uh see some video like that i'm not exhausted anymore it's just a war period it is just
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.480]  so evil and now we have a government that pushes it preemptively uh and funds al qaeda and then
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:44.000]  uses al qaeda as the pretext to invade the middle east again it is just a very wicked policy anything
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  else tony yeah that was it thank you god bless you brother yeah uh watson was on for 30 minutes
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:56.080]  monday if you missed it and covered the london telegraph and others reported on that days after
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:03.520]  watson said it was fake i'll tell you what else is fake adam gadan the former uh well well the
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:09.920]  grandson of the former head of the adl who was arrested repeatedly beating up muslims outside
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:16.080]  mosque he hated him so much he then decided to join al qaeda and become their number two commander
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:23.760]  worldwide that's how fake al qaeda is they have real jihadi's under them but they're literally
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:32.080]  western government run jerusalem post headline israel created fake al qaeda groups and then every
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:35.920]  time israel did want a peace deal they blow something up i'm not even demonizing israel
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.920]  all these major governments do it the average israel he's not involved there are real terrorists
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:47.360]  israel's fighting but governments do this that's in the jerusalem post that's in the upi that's in
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:53.920]  haritz israel created fake al qaeda group staged bombings that's exact headline no that's a upi
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:15:02.080]  headline i just gave you from uh 2003 look it up now what am i getting at here
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:10.080]  governments period are manipulated by the globalists in a standard corporate worldwide fascist plan
[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:19.520]  are a garacle how do you pronounce it our oligarchical i've been having trouble with that word
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:25.600]  oligarchical collectivism where they're oligarchs and royal and palaces with jet coppers and
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.560]  unlimited wealth but you're a communist or a socialist living in a slave pit and they dance
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:37.200]  around calling it liberal all day that's the plan and the public so dumbed down down on the slave pit
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:41.440]  in cardboard boxes they just know the helicopters fly over and dump food out once a month so they're
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:46.320]  like i love obama that's why they want the third world collapsing into us it's a total plan it's
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:53.840]  working beautifully are we smart enough to realize the plan and do something about it j in texas
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:59.360]  thanks for holding you're on the air yeah nice to talk to you i've been listening to you for about
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:06.320]  six years i am in law enforcement i really want to get into what branch um i think a lot of what's
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:12.960]  going on here and a lot of i guess in total um what's happening to our country um and around
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:17.680]  the world basically is going to continue until somehow somebody comes up with some type of
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:22.160]  communication device that can't be tracked by the same people listening to the conversation
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:28.800]  right here and right now um but all the things that are taking place here uh it's very hard to
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:34.800]  fight tyranny when you can't communicate freely without someone else listening to everything you
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:39.040]  do or watch your that's right the globalists at the top that are less than one percent of the
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:44.800]  government and the corporations nevertheless in control have a panoptychonic total surveillance
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:50.480]  view the way to beat that is either a separate communication system but then they would discover
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.760]  that and track it the way to beat it is a swarm effect where everybody starts doing little things
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:01.520]  every day everybody starts telling the truth everybody starts making a stand and then everybody
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:06.480]  steps forward it's kind of like the movie scene we've all seen that's based on a lot of true things
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:10.960]  they draw the line in the sand they say who's going to step forward and one guy finally steps
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:16.400]  forward and then two and then five and then ten and then suddenly everybody steps across that's
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:22.560]  what the system is afraid of and that's what's been holding back their new world order is good
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:27.520]  people in federal and state and local government that's why the globalists want to go to pure
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:32.080]  corporate government where they are just completely above the law that's why they
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:37.440]  want to go to paramilitary police wearing masks so they can bring in mercenaries like was done
[01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:43.440]  up in Missouri go ahead other points about what you see happening in the world
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.280]  well right this thing people need to understand that people in law enforcement are very well
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:53.680]  what's taking place in this country we have lemmings in our profession like everybody else
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:18:00.720]  but for the most part people are very way through what's happening here it's kind of hard not to
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:07.760]  see it after irs and nsa and everything else has been uncovered that this conspiracy even three
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:13.040]  years ago but there are a lot of good people out here they're awake they know what's going on
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:19.120]  and we took an oath I mean it's that simple and there's many of us that are not going to go away
[01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:24.240]  from that oath and it really doesn't matter what happens we're not going to go away from the oath
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:30.080]  we took period so I just want people understand that there are good people in law enforcement
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:34.960]  I know that the vast majority and then that's why as I've gotten more sophisticated the last
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:40.640]  10 years I've stated that because in my experience I figured out the media is showing all the bad
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:48.480]  examples on purpose so that and they are egregious so they can create that separation God bless you
[01:18:48.480 --> 01:18:53.520]  and I appreciate your call I'm going to tell the police something and I know you're smart you
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:59.120]  understand this especially if you're not a greenhorn do you think of homeland security under the
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:05.840]  globalist under obama says veterans of the number one terror threat who do you think they're not
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.200]  putting on that list who's just like the veterans in fact who is mainly veterans
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:19.360]  imagine the jeopardy music's playing in the background do do do do don't don't don't don't
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:28.640]  don't cops they're afraid of anybody that's masculine or anybody that's willing to engage
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:35.520]  anybody who's not a coward anybody who's not naive anybody that's red-blooded that's why
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:40.160]  they want the general public domesticated they only want to use the warrior class long enough
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.440]  to take over and they're going to replace everybody with combat robots which is now happening so
[01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:52.000]  that's it this is the main fight for humanity happening right now and it's real I bet I bet

[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:23.600]  we have a lot of new affiliates across the country like Oklahoma City you'll hear stuff on this show
[01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:29.200]  that sounds completely nuts and I do deliver it kind of in a crazy way sometimes because
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:36.160]  I'm freaked out about all this I cover stuff too much I work too much I've been doing this 19 years
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:40.720]  and quite frankly it's gotten to me so I've gotten kind of cynical and nasty about it all
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:47.120]  but I'm not cynical in my heart I will act cynical on air and I've kind of psychoanalyzed it
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:54.720]  it's because it hurts me and only you know having gallows humor makes me feel better
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:02.400]  because I get mad about the evil I get upset about the attempt to corrupt our civilization by
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.880]  designed to make us weak and then I read all these globalist documents that we've covered on air
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:12.080]  where they admit they're trying to make us dumb down and weak society has enough problems without
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:18.400]  trying to screw everybody over and we're converting to a civilization based on fraud not based on
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:28.320]  productivity sciences of scams sciences of deception that's the point we've gotten to and
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:35.440]  nobody's perfect also the public has had it easy so long comparatively where our ancestors were
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:40.000]  starved to death that they made mistakes that statistics I'm gonna cover this later do show
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:46.960]  we're getting dumber just like the movie idiocracy with a guy who's got 185 IQ Mike judge because
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:52.080]  a rocket scientist he designed a lot of the f-18 he also wrote that movie about people were getting
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:59.360]  stupider and stupider and that's basically what's happened now and then that kind of goes towards
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:04.240]  the globalist statement that well see the public's dumb down get rid of them but you're trying to
[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:10.480]  dumb them down even more you're not trying to reverse any of it and the answer is well that
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:15.040]  wouldn't help him anyways okay well here's the deal I don't want to be a slave I don't want
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:19.920]  fluoride my water the Harvard study says it gives me brain damage gives me cancer I don't want your

[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:31.920]  leave me alone I don't want my kids forcibly inoculated well why well because governments
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:36.560]  have a history of secret testing and putting stuff in them and there's a lot of evidence
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:40.640]  that vaccines are giving people autism and brain damage and the inserts say that
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:52.000]  so I don't trust you and here's why we're going to go to Jim in Florida and Matthew and Michael

[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:18.160]  with it Jim in Florida thanks for calling you're on the air hi Alex I have a suggested mission
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:26.160]  that I'd like to propose to you okay and that would be to call John McAfee to see if he had
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:36.800]  volunteered to retrieve the missing IRS emails which are quote to onerous a task unquote for the IRS
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:44.720]  programmers I mean after all by the way we know their systems were on cloud backups by law
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:49.680]  that to keep the records for 10 years we have to keep them for seven we all know where it's at
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:54.400]  and the corporation they're just stonewalling congress but yeah yeah McAfee should come out
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:58.720]  and point out how it's a fraud because he's well known that's a let's get him on that's a good idea
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:05.840]  go ahead well well the other thing Alex is the last time he was on he volunteered for free to fix
[01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:13.040]  so vomit care that website that that horrible debacle of a website and that would be an enormous
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:19.120]  task I mean this thing would be a piece of cake for for for McAfee to take care of to find those
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:25.760]  emails and if he came on air and publicly and said look I'll find them for you for nothing
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:30.720]  that's a genius idea bottom line to be a great stunt to point out that they're hidden in plain view
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:34.000]  well that we should do a report because I've read all the articles it's admitted in the news

[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:13.840]  the news uh up on info wars dot com fema building pricey domes you know that's a good article but
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:20.960]  it should be fema building emergency management centers or emergency reestablishment centers

[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:49.680]  like the great leap forward of the cultural revolution under mouse a tongue but joining
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:55.760]  us is cliven bundy haven't had him on in a few months since the historic standoff with the feds
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:02.000]  were were cliven's family led more than a thousand men women and children dozens of them on horseback
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:10.880]  up against paramilitary militarized blm pointing live guns at them telling them don't cross the
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:17.440]  line or will shoot to get on to his property that he's been on since the 1870s with his family
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:24.960]  the feds simply declared and ran off to the 34 families that came on the same wagon train in
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:32.240]  the 1870s they declared that they all just needed to leave and and couldn't use the land anymore
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:39.600]  but grazing fees on the land the government had grabbed the open range impossible to pay so cliven
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:43.440]  didn't pay those since the 90s because he said he would have the state government levied it
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.920]  but the feds had no jurisdiction which i agree with and he's had court cases on that
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:54.160]  and the issue here is you've got 85 percent of of some of those western states actually nevadas
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:37:02.960]  almost 90 percent that's where he's based that are federal another five six percent is state
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:06.640]  you're talking less than five percent that's privately owned i mean this is in america
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:11.760]  and then over the chinese i want to come in and build solar farms go ahead or you want to
[01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:16.480]  do whatever that's fine or you want to come your foreign company fine it's the shutdown of american
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:21.120]  industry we told you beef prices we're going to increase they're all they're at record levels now
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:28.480]  because they're harassing farmers and ranchers across the country under obama's rural council
[01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:33.760]  under homeland security that's designed to use environmental rules and fines and fees to shut
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:42.960]  down agriculture and quote rewild america under agenda 21 the un cloward and piven style plan
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:47.280]  to bankrupt this country so that's why we stood with cliven bundy on the principle
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:54.000]  of what he's doing is right and trying to get people to be self-sufficient again and so he
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:38:00.640]  joins us to give us updates on what happened since that historic situation one of the only times the
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:06.320]  feds are back down in the last hundred years that's because they knew what a pr disaster would be
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:12.880]  shooting men on horseback trying to go get their cattle that the feds had who they were basically
[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:20.000]  killing uh by not giving them any water dehydration so cliven bundy thanks for coming on with us well
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.600]  thank you it's a privilege to come on with you and it's a privilege to talk to american people
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:32.320]  one more time you know my question would be uh america the free the land of the opportunity
[01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:38.320]  what fire is that uh basically we've lost that if we have that anywhere we got it on bundy
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:45.200]  range right now and that's good news well you're right and and even rick perry's weighed in uh on
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:51.600]  the fact that the blm is claiming tens of thousands of acres that is privately owned on the oklahoma
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:59.600]  and texas side of the red river well yeah they're not satisfied over the uh almost 90 percent of the
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:04.880]  state of nevada and over 60 percent of the west states they got to go back across the business
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:09.440]  that there is a monkey and we the people back there what's wrong with them
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:17.200]  they just have an instinct to take over they also have existential envy they don't like people
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:22.640]  that run their own lives and are self-sufficient a bureaucrat a beam counter is fundamentally
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.080]  sick at their stomach by people that are self-sufficient you know that you know they call
[01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:33.520]  people like you cliven wild and they say that they need to get everybody domesticated now they call
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:39.920]  me a well-fired rancher and also also but you know i work every day uh my family works every day to
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:46.640]  produce uh edible uh commodity for we the people of america and we the people of the world now what
[01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:52.880]  do they do they just cause this trouble they could cause every industry trouble what what service is
[01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:58.880]  these bureaucracies and bureaucrats what what do they do for america you know we can have a government
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:05.040]  shutdown we don't even miss them i i'm i'm saying it's time that we better start cleaning these out
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:10.720]  this bureaucracy out because they have the guns now they have their armies and that's what come
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:19.360]  out to me and my uh uh of friends and family was a bureaucracy army with guns a military tactic
[01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:26.880]  and they were basically out to kill and that was that's not some truth that's that was what was
[01:40:26.880 --> 01:40:32.880]  happening here in southern nevada at bundy's ranch well they also have snopes that were started by
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:38.720]  soros uh groups and their white house run groups lying and saying there's no connection to the
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:44.480]  chinese government and their solar company and no connection to harry reed harry reed's people
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:49.920]  got very upset they would try to get us off the radio in vegas that was unsuccessful we're on live
[01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:57.040]  right now why would why would harry reed want to get you off the radio or why would harry
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:03.600]  reed want to get me off the land if he wasn't making money i guess it was all about uh it
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:09.440]  definitely isn't his uh duty as a senator of the united states to shut your radio down or
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:15.440]  shut my uh a range operation down he has to have another motive and it has to be with something
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:20.880]  to do with money well who has all the money in the world china must have most of it exactly well
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:24.880]  they think everybody's dumb so they don't know that his son has been in the las vegas review
[01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:32.560]  journal his son is on the board with the company and no the solar panels aren't going to be on
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:37.600]  your land your open range land that you have a lodeal title to on record under state law on the
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:43.520]  u.s constitution under continuous use and being the first people there at stakeholders well what
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:50.000]  they want to do is even if the solar panels are not on my land what they want to do is use my land
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:56.640]  for mitigation i was about to say you're another endangered species exactly what they do is is they
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:03.520]  play this game on these politic check and fact check sites they go alex jones and info wars dot
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:09.200]  com claim that the chinese government is going to build on clive and bundy's land well a it's not
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:12.800]  his land because they know people don't understand the difference between land that you have a right
[01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:18.480]  to use open range versus what you completely own and then they tell the second line they go no the
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:26.160]  solar panels are 50 miles away but in the documents on the blm website it says your land is set aside
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:31.920]  as the easement for them to be able to use that so they play this game the point is your land's
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:37.680]  being taken as part of this deal and it's in the newspaper two years ago before this all started
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:42.720]  it's on the blm website till they took it down but it's on the google wayback machine but they
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:48.720]  count on readers and viewers being dumb and then thinking we're making that up cliven i know that
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:56.000]  but what's really happening here is they want some area of this uh nevada desert to build a solar
[01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:03.280]  pattern panel and then they want to kill the tortoises on that area now i see kill kill the
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:09.840]  tortoises on the desert the natives and that's their native habitat now in order to uh justify
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:14.960]  that kill or when they call it a tank and to justify that tank they say well we're going to
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:20.640]  reserve some habitat over here on bundy's range for those tortoises but really what's happened in
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:27.280]  there is not only bundy and his cattle they want off that land they want you off that land so you
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:33.520]  can't use it for recreation or or hunting fishing or any other purpose bill a bill a oil well or a
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:41.760]  water well uh easement for a utility they want to lock lock up and lock out and that's not only
[01:43:41.760 --> 01:43:47.200]  what they want they want policing power with unlimited power unlimited power over this land
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.880]  and not only bundy's range they're using this tactic all over the western united states and
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:58.720]  they're basically the western united states but all over the united states they want to lock up and
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:05.600]  lock out people off the land and they want unlimited power policing powers what they're after
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:11.120]  well let me expand on that uh this this report is up on info wars dot com it's out of the new
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:15.840]  york times some of the news i haven't gotten to today but i wanted to cover it with you
[01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:23.920]  obama pursuing climate accord in lieu of treaty and says he will act outside of congress with the
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:30.800]  united nations and will implement it through the executive branch so i want to be clear
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:35.200]  and that's red linked on drudge and it should be red linked on drudge that we should do a whole
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:42.560]  article on info wars dot com that is our government and obama saying he gets authority from the united
[01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:51.280]  nations my first film about the west america destroyed by design is more important 18 years later
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:59.200]  than it was when i made it obama pushes for you and climate rules without congress i'm gonna say
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:06.160]  that again and those climate rules will shut down what's left only america and europe have to do
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:11.280]  these rules it will make everything that we've got left move to europe i mean move out of europe
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:17.280]  move out of the us and go south of the border or go to china or india and it won't even help those
[01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:25.520]  people there climate money yeah there's a i mean that i just can't understand how big this is when
[01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:32.640]  you get talking about the united nation new and i mean you know this this environmental movement
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:39.520]  it's it's basically agenda 21 i guess you could say it where they want to clear out all of the
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:45.840]  land from the people and and give it back to nature supposedly and and the animals well
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:51.040]  that's not really what they want again they want they want to take the vast area basically through
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:59.600]  the midwest now they want that car to go from canada to mexico take out the central part of america
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:06.000]  and basically eliminate people and construction agriculture everything i mean house daily can
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.880]  you be what what kind of human being would think that way why shouldn't we go in there and develop
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:17.680]  and increase it and better it for the mankind and multiply and replenish i mean isn't that what
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:25.040]  we're starting to come in to do climate monday is our guest harry reid famously said that anyone out
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.960]  there at the ranch even peacefully demonstrating for the first amendment was a domestic terrorist
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:39.200]  we forget that people were roughed up beaten up tasered including your son on video being nonviolent
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:45.920]  by paramilitary landgrabbers blm people masquerading as federal agents they're not even that they're un
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:52.640]  agents under un treaty in esco and now all this is out in the open uh that people got mad when
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:57.280]  they saw that and and the globalists should know as they push they're only going to create more
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:02.160]  opposition well they know that they want to start a civil war in this country that's why it's important
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:07.120]  for the feds and others to be smart enough to not play along with this but we've got to be
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:12.880]  smart enough as well but what do you make of harry reid saying a you're a domestic terrorist
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:19.280]  basically and be that there will be a judgment day that that there will be a response very cryptically
[01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:27.360]  do you expect the empire of the chycoms and harry reid and the landgrabbers the locust
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:36.720]  do you expect the parasites to strike back well you know harry reid didn't only say was a domestic
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:42.880]  terrorist he said we were violent domestic terrorists that's a remark that's pretty bad in other words
[01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.440]  would be somebody that was going to bomb the city or do something i don't know what a violent
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:54.240]  domestic terrorist that but definitely it's worse than just the domestic terrorist and they did
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:48:00.960]  they harry did is to earmark cliven bundy he marked all of those who stood the thousands that stood
[01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:07.840]  with cliven but is the violent domestic terrorist and what that's pretty that earmark of being a
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:13.840]  terrorist puts on us and puts throughout the america thinking well okay now we got a terrorist in
[01:48:13.840 --> 01:48:18.960]  america i guess we should get rid of him and we can take and shoot him we can bomb him we can
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:23.680]  incarcerate him we can do anything we want i guess we could even cut his hand off if that's
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:29.520]  what needs to be done he is a terrorist that works in united states for america and that's the title
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:35.440]  that harry reid put up on we the people here at bundy's range and by the way we warned every one
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:41.920]  when they passed the ndaa when obama signed that back in 2011 uh on the last day of the year at night
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:46.640]  on new year's eve when he said he wouldn't sign it turned out his office wrote it uh where they
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:51.840]  could secretly arrest and disappear americans well look they can put on paper that they're allowed
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:56.800]  to barbecue children on the white house lawn i'm not going along with it i don't care what their
[01:48:56.800 --> 01:49:03.360]  globalist tin badge says the fact that they've gone so far down the road to tyranny shows
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:08.720]  that they're completely illegitimate congress has a six percent to seven percent approval rating
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:14.560]  and the police they're trying to put in these armored vehicles are starting to wake up uh to
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:19.520]  what's happening and and so the feds are coming saying they're going to save us from the paramilitary
[01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:27.440]  police that they set up i mean i don't see any way the establishment's going to be able to win this
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:32.800]  cliven unless they stage false flags uh and blame the liberty movement and i don't think that'll
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:38.960]  even work as well i mean how do you how does your gut what does your gut tell you is going to happen
[01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:43.840]  in this country where do you see this country in 10 years well let me talk just a little bit more
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:50.400]  about what happened out here let's take my son dave that they uh basically he was taking pictures of
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:55.840]  them uh moving the cattle not even in the area where they're gathered but going to take pictures
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:50:04.240]  of the trucks that had the cattle in it and they uh ganged up on him and their thugs with their high
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:11.520]  powered army military type equipment and they uh christ his head into the gravel and and the rest
[01:50:11.520 --> 01:50:18.080]  team and hauled him off and uh took him and put him in their jail and interrogated him and uh after
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:23.200]  two days they turned him out on the street just like uh just like a thug would probably take
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:27.760]  somebody that there's going to rape and they use him up use her up or whatever and then they just
[01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:34.640]  turn her out on the street that's the way they treated my son and you know why would a human
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:39.440]  being or a government act that way there's the only thing they can be doing is trying to tell
[01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:44.240]  we the people that they have unlimited power to start anything do any damn thing they want
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:50.880]  and we better not resist to say anything about it that's the attitude clavin bundy is our guest

[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:52.960]  senator harry reid a few months ago saying the people out there at the bundy ranch most of them
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:57.840]  demonstrating for the first amendment because the feds were saying basically in half the county
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:01.120]  you couldn't even stand on the sidewalk with a sign they would come up and assault you
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:06.720]  uh that that that was terrorism and they got video of one guy aiming his ar-15
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:12.720]  down over the overpass towards the feds which i think was stupid and very provocative
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:17.600]  and then they imply everyone's a terrorist because of that what about the police aiming
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:24.400]  their 223s at my reporters in broad daylight who they even knew by name day after day in ferguson
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:27.440]  is that terrorism
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:35.200]  let's go to that club of harry reid here it is so these people who hold themselves out
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:42.400]  to be patriots are not they're nothing more than domestic terrorists and i think that we are a
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:48.560]  country that people should follow the law and what went up in mesquite is not very good i repeat
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:53.920]  what went on up there is domestic tourism okay domestic terrorism not tourism
[01:55:53.920 --> 01:55:58.240]  that was a los vegas review journal video
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.000]  so there you go all of this is for the american people and that's admitted
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:11.520]  and so they claim that the rendition the torture the ndaa the checkpoints the nsa was all for al-qaeda
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:15.440]  which is now known as is and our government gave weapons to and is now fighting again
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.840]  because it's not our government it's criminal special interest at every level
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:25.760]  who are robbing the country seven ways to sunday there are secret death panels for veterans where
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:34.240]  they have operable cancers with 95 success rates and they just don't give them the surgery and they
[01:56:34.240 --> 01:56:41.120]  die and then the horror media spins that when the alternative media breaks it it's going on
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:48.320]  nationwide as mistakes were made no the government and criminal interests have gotten away with bloody
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:55.360]  murder and somebody finally stood up to him and the controlled media acted like we were devils for
[01:56:55.360 --> 01:57:01.840]  daring to know the law and what had happened out there final comments clavin bunny in the two
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:07.360]  minutes we've got left sir well you know the question is who is the criminals here was it the
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:12.400]  federal bureaucracy that pointed to guns that we the people or was it we the people who was
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:18.320]  standing up for our liberty and freedoms and our agency our constitution our state sovereignty
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:23.920]  was we wronged or were they wrong where in the in this constitution where in this government
[01:57:23.920 --> 01:57:30.560]  does it allow an army to come against believe the people and where would a senator i say you
[01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:39.280]  brought your army here how would how could you justify bringing a militia not a militia a military
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:44.160]  army against believe the people and you know i made the statement this will never happen in
[01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:50.240]  america again and yet we see it's all over repeating itself across the country i don't know when

[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:03.600]  sheriff's got to wake up and uh and we the people we say it's our fault we have allowed this to

[02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:10.720]  actually it was you gave me directions on how to get to um mount carmel in waco wow i can't remember
[02:01:11.280 --> 02:01:16.480]  who introduced us but yeah it's been a gazillion years yeah we were doing a memorial church there
[02:01:16.480 --> 02:01:20.800]  for all those that died first it started that we were just going to renovate the little chapel
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:26.080]  for the memorial and then it got away from me with my listeners we ended up building a church
[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:30.240]  and then the media said that i was a branch devotee and trying to conjure the dead spirit
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:36.880]  of of koresh uh and when the memorial was also for the atf people that died and there was a plaque
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:42.000]  there the mainstream news said it was a celebration of the federal agents being killed so that's how
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:49.040]  mainstream media operates go ahead okay well i'm what i thought was um a good thing i work as a chef
[02:01:49.040 --> 02:01:55.600]  and um i'm also um working in a nutrition science degree i'm trying to get basically a doctor at
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:02:01.600]  night but um the story that y'all had linked up um on info words about the school lunch program
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:09.120]  which you know michelle obama's a nutritionist is as much as um barack obama is a constitutional
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:15.120]  lawyer um something well yeah that's like saying roseo donnell got fat because of spoons ban spoons
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:21.600]  you know ban the guns something i wanted to bring up i live here in south carolina kind of basically
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:30.000]  between um atlanta and charlotte and um something that we did here locally was more or less to get
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.280]  rid of the federal mandate on the lunches because everybody figured out that it wasn't working the
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:40.080]  kids weren't eating the stuff you know and you know yeah it was racist to bring your your lunch in a
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:46.640]  brown bag or whatever and um also started them trying to locally source as much food as we
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:53.600]  possibly can yeah the cost of lunch has essentially doubled this school year but the misconception
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:59.280]  that a lot of people are under in a lot of school but it wasn't free the feds take our money send us
[02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:04.320]  poison crud back it's subsidized like mcdonald's is subsidized because they're allowed to have
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:08.640]  chinese rotten food that's come out in the news and they're allowed to radiate and they're allowed to
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:15.120]  not pay for obama care but when you go eat their food you are literally eating food that's subsidized
[02:03:15.120 --> 02:03:19.200]  and is globalist garbage and mcdonald's i was thinking is the perfect microcosm
[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:25.120]  the globalists have set it up where they're going to make you so poor you can only afford to eat
[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:30.960]  there where their hamburger is a dollar or two dollars and a real hamburger is five dollars or six
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:38.160]  dollars it's just you you won't have the money in the future to eat to eat anywhere but mcdonald's
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:44.240]  and then it'll be social engineering subsidized poison because the globalists exempted themselves
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:49.440]  from all the regulations that's the essence of how they operate if someone can understand that
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:56.720]  they can understand it all go ahead sorry but i thought it has been a lot of good points brought
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:01.520]  up today in your show that you know people you know just talking about little steps that people can

[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:25.360]  can't send it so i mean next you can't pack your child's lunch i mean think about how screwed up
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:30.000]  that is and chicago said two years ago they said listen we can't trust these parents to pack a
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:37.280]  lunch see that's what they think of us great points i grew up with a lunch but you know that
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:42.480]  my mom packed or i packed myself my entire life but um well back when you were a kid back when you

[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:38.400]  it wasn't very long ago that the governor of california was outlawing driver's licenses
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:44.800]  for people who are undocumented from mexico that's not the law anymore if you've got a car or a truck
[02:08:44.800 --> 02:08:50.800]  it takes you two or three hours to get across so we can change that and we are going to work on a

[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:20.720]  about justice that is very important for the development of north american society north
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:28.560]  american society that is the mexican the relationship between president who resides
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:35.600]  over a failed narcotics trafficking terror state that is in full collapse with the rest of central
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:42.720]  america already collapsed they have now developed a corridor into the united states obama has announced
[02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:51.520]  unlimited amnesty for guatemalan's enough green cards for nicaragua el salvador and guatemala's
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:57.520]  entire populations there's a new pew poll out showing that one third of mexicans are ready
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:03.840]  to come here now and believe it's their right to come here and have free babies welfare everything
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:13.360]  and jerry brown with a straight face and a big giant red nose it looks like he's an alcoholic
[02:10:13.360 --> 02:10:20.640]  santa claus says wasn't too long ago we had governors that didn't give drivers licenses to
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:29.040]  illegals think about that can i go to mexico get a driver's license no can i go there and
[02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:38.480]  have everything paid for free no imagine i showed him said it is justice that you pay for me it is
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:44.320]  justice it is justice that i get a driver's license so i can open bank accounts so i can vote
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:48.000]  because see notice they have laws in california where you got drivers license you can vote you
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:55.120]  get on the rolls i mean what a sick joke i mean literally california could take over all of america
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:11:00.960]  they could just bring in 300 million people from the world don't even need that 10 2030 million
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:05.360]  and up to tip the other balance with popular states like texas the democrats say with their
[02:11:05.360 --> 02:11:09.920]  blue plan and i'm not even a fan republicans but the republican leadership wants to commit
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:15.120]  suicide it was well for the north american union that's what this is all about is a north american
[02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:22.400]  union that's why you've got obama and you've got hillary clinton and you've got all these other
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:28.800]  world leaders and wesley clark and and and all the and and patrice all the news saying it's a
[02:11:28.800 --> 02:11:34.560]  north american union we're gonna have a north american union id card six years ago they came out
[02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:39.760]  with a north american union id card a hemispheric travel card that if you get it from mexico to
[02:11:39.760 --> 02:11:44.320]  canada or the u.s you can travel everywhere a smart card that's going to be the new card and
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:49.840]  citizens will have to have it to get on an airplane but illegals remember that headline last week
[02:11:49.840 --> 02:11:56.560]  don't have to have any idea to fly lawless selective enforcement
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:04.880]  and you can be a felon from around the world and come here and change your name as many times as
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:10.960]  you want kill as many people as you want and you do not get in trouble compared to anybody else
[02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:16.960]  imagine the straight face of yeah i used to you had to you know at least be here legally to get
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:22.480]  a driver's license now it's just no can you can you believe the undocumented couldn't get a driver's
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:33.760]  license and of course then the judges on record when you have that driver's license in places like
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:42.000]  colorado and in california just let the illegals go i've had prosecutors from travis county who
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:47.200]  were not like the people that died at parry come to me and meet with me and show me the numbers
[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:56.960]  and talk about the fact that judges are told by the higher ups to tell the cops don't arrest
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:00.880]  illegals for drunk driving and stuff because all we're going to give them's a ten dollar fine
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:06.960]  because if we don't they'll walk ten twenty dollars they'll pay citizens the average dwi cost is
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:16.240]  about twenty thousand dollars unillegal ten dollars maybe twenty and hey see but discriminations only
[02:13:16.240 --> 02:13:21.840]  by white people you don't accept obama care your racist gringo you don't accept turning your guns in
[02:13:21.840 --> 02:13:28.080]  your racist gringo you don't accept your kids being given force inoculations you're look if the sun
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:34.560]  don't shine it's a white person's fault just on and on and on and on in this in this quote minority
[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:40.080]  based propaganda but see the minorities of the majority now in almost every state and and did
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:46.480]  the white bashing stop no it's only intensified because the government is manipulating this ladies
[02:13:46.480 --> 02:13:55.120]  and gentlemen to tell the immigrants that have i guess uh what could you call it um an idea that
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:14:00.240]  people don't like them or that they're not as good or they're better and they're going to show you
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:06.160]  you and they're teamed up with the big mighty government now so they're going to win that's
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:12.720]  childlike thinking obama's my daddy george bush is my daddy i'm a republicans you're just associating
[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:20.560]  their personal power with the far off you know powerful government and psychology but those
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:25.840]  very same people will hate their neighbor that's super good-looking or has a gorgeous wife they
[02:14:25.840 --> 02:14:30.320]  will hate their neighbor that makes more money legally and lawfully than them and will have
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:37.040]  existential envy when you study advertising and you study modern culture and propaganda and
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:45.280]  edward bernays and joseph gerbils they talk about existential envy that i grew up researching
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:49.760]  and understanding but when you try to do research on it there's hardly any literature on it
[02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:54.800]  max schiller
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:14:59.280]  was a german philosopher known for his work in
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:07.600]  ethics and philosophy and anthropology he developed the further the psychological method
[02:15:08.720 --> 02:15:11.920]  and is one of the main founders of modern psychology today
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:17.760]  and what did he talk about
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:31.120]  max schiller said quote existential envy which is directed against the other person's very
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:41.600]  nature is the strongest source of resentment it is as if it whispers continually i can forgive
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:48.640]  everything but not that you are that you are what you are that i am not what you are indeed
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:55.200]  that i am not you this form of envy strips the opponent of his very existence for the existence
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:05.680]  as such is felt to be a pressure a reproach and an unbearable humiliation in the lives of great men
[02:16:05.680 --> 02:16:13.600]  there are always critical periods of instability in which they are alternatively envy and try to
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:22.880]  love those whose merits they cannot but esteem only gradually one of these attitudes will predominate
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:36.000]  here lies the meaning of goat's reflection that against another's great merits there is no remedy
[02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:50.720]  but love go to had it right and this is what it comes down to of everything i've learned we'll
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:58.000]  go back to your calls existential envy drives everything back when i was 20 years old i was
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:05.760]  about as good looking as it gets and i could have the most beautiful girlfriends out there
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:15.280]  models uh you know professional cheerleaders you name it i've dated them all show girls
[02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:19.920]  then i got into politics and find the new lord didn't care about myself didn't work out 15
[02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:23.840]  years turning the job of the hut a slow process getting back to where i used to look take a long
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:28.960]  time but i'm losing weight as people can see the point is is that i would have these incredibly
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:34.160]  gorgeous girlfriends and then they would get mad when i worked out so much out of six pack stomach
[02:17:34.160 --> 02:17:39.600]  saying i don't want you looking better than me and it's a more modern phenomenon as existential
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:46.400]  envy gets worse that women especially don't want a mate that is smart and intelligent and dynamic
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:50.000]  and successful they want a mate i'm going to skip this network break this is so important
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:58.080]  that that they feel better than because they have a low self-esteem and failed societies
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:04.160]  have a predominance of existential envy and the government and the media plays off of this the
[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:12.160]  classism the statism the racism to where people are so upset that they will politically be the
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:17.040]  slaves of the democratic party and do whatever they say turn in their guns have checkpoints in
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:23.680]  their neighborhoods except obama careless a giant screw job because misery loves company and just
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:32.000]  to imagine success and imagine being a good person is just too much because they hate all the people
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.800]  that are charming that are good-looking and i experienced that i wasn't bragging when i said
[02:18:36.800 --> 02:18:41.120]  i was super good-looking and you know had all these gorgeous girlfriends which by the way wasn't
[02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:50.640]  fun at the end of the day because they were so empty it was the experience of wondering why so
[02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:58.880]  many people disliked me because i was good-looking and because i was charming and because i was nice
[02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:04.320]  now i was always popular and i always had a great time and i would run into people that were successful
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:10.640]  and who loved and admired those that were better looking than them or smarter than them because
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:16.560]  on the scale of one to ten i was nothing that's why i've been successful being around rich and
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:22.400]  powerful people not that i've even tried to be around them is because i don't envy them and i
[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:29.600]  don't hate them because they're successful and i'm not fake and i'm real and i can't admire someone
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:34.480]  who's a rocket scientist or i could admire someone who's a better comic than i am i can
[02:19:34.480 --> 02:19:41.200]  admire a man who's more manly and and good-looking than i am and looks like a gq model and who has
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:49.120]  an incredibly gorgeous you know fitness model girlfriend because i admire beautiful smart humans
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:56.640]  and the human species and subconsciously i imagine my grandchildren being with their grandchildren
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:03.280]  as adults and colonizing space together i admire i mean it'd be like going to a horse show and seeing
[02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:09.760]  beautiful horses and being mad that one horse was more beautiful or strong than the other it gives
[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:16.880]  strength to the entire species of the horse and so if you want to know the secret of success it's
[02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:23.840]  don't be an envious little wicked weirdo i can't tell you how many people that i saw had some talent
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:29.760]  or smart or had an eye for news that i would try to elevate who would then immediately try to destroy
[02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:36.240]  me make stuff up about me lie about me and just go completely nuts but it was existential envy
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:43.040]  believing that i had to be destroyed so that they could rise and they were trying to be quote media
[02:20:43.040 --> 02:20:51.520]  stars not to defeat the enemy but to be stars to be egomaniacs and that's why none of them last
[02:20:52.080 --> 02:20:57.120]  because they're not doing it for the love of liberty for the love of the truth they're not
[02:20:57.120 --> 02:21:02.480]  doing it to build others up i can't tell you how many countless guests and other talk show hosts and
[02:21:02.480 --> 02:21:11.760]  authors and researchers that i've had on this show who literally later say you need me that's why you
[02:21:11.760 --> 02:21:19.200]  have me on uh you're using me you're posting my articles when i make somebody's famous or successful
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:22.960]  and then later they learn they're nobody after i quit promoting them which is sad
[02:21:22.960 --> 02:21:31.440]  but they literally can't imagine someone trying to build them up we have more listeners we have
[02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:35.600]  the ratings from our stations that come in live time now about many of them we have the ratings
[02:21:35.600 --> 02:21:40.240]  off the internet live time you know what gets the listeners me you know people want to hear
[02:21:40.240 --> 02:21:45.200]  alex jones i don't have all these guests and people up here because i'm just trying to get
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:49.120]  ratings and listeners i'm getting them up here because i like to talk to them i want to pick
[02:21:49.120 --> 02:21:54.320]  their brain i want to build them up i want to point out how smart they are and so many of these
[02:21:54.320 --> 02:22:01.120]  existential envy weirdos think i'm weak and that i'm trying to screw them over because they can't
[02:22:01.120 --> 02:22:14.160]  imagine that someone would try to build humanity up and be strong i admire a man who has a knockout
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:20.240]  gorgeous wife and who has great kids and is successful and can hold it together and and
[02:22:20.240 --> 02:22:22.800]  to see their kids graduate from college and be honorable
[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:30.320]  even if a war is a fraud and a lie i could admire somebody that serves four or five tours
[02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:35.200]  and goes through living hell and keeps it together i'm not intimidated by men that are tougher than
[02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:43.280]  me i'm not intimidated by artists that can paint a better painting than i i admire them i i fancy
[02:22:43.280 --> 02:22:51.760]  humans i fancy the species i i i i want to build people up i don't get jealous i don't get envious
[02:22:56.560 --> 02:23:00.560]  now there's territorialism and people are trying to run me over and dominate me
[02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:06.800]  then i stand up against them but it's because of the principle so i want to read
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:14.880]  max shillers one of the founders of psychology's quote on what drives everything and what the
[02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:25.520]  system wants us to be base dumb down petty narcissistic sociopath oides artificially
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:29.840]  created sociopaths is what the system's going for because if you won't stand up for anybody
[02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:35.360]  around you no one's gonna stand up for you all these sociopaths and narcissists think they're
[02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:42.720]  getting ahead in the world because they don't care about anybody and they're screwing everyone
[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:47.040]  and they think that's a real smart having an attitude no that's how you die alone that's how
[02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:53.920]  you die without honor honor is knowing humanity's fallen and knowing you're fallen but reaching
[02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:59.680]  for your higher angels reaching for the stars doing what's right trying to build other people up
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:04.640]  i don't get up here and brag about how i've been successful or how i understand how things work
[02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:10.000]  because it's about my ego it's about telling people we know where the good water well is
[02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:16.720]  versus the poison well we know the paradigm we know how the system works we've decoded it
[02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:24.560]  it's hiding in plain view we do have the answers the answers you waking up and taking action the
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:30.400]  answers you getting back what the founding fathers were into invention trailblazing being
[02:24:30.400 --> 02:24:38.080]  honorable being strong being tough being real the most valuable thing is your name is your honor
[02:24:38.080 --> 02:24:42.880]  that's why the system tries to dishonor me all day and say i'm dishonorable and say i'm not real
[02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:47.200]  and say i'm a fraud because they got my phones tapped they got my police records from the time
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:52.080]  i was 12 years old they know full well how real i am and that's what they don't like
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:57.920]  they don't like bona fides ladies and gentlemen and let me tell you what really successful people
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:02.480]  who aren't evil what they're looking for they're looking for a few good men and women
[02:25:02.480 --> 02:25:08.160]  who are honorable who are savvy who are strong who are ready to stand up for justice who are
[02:25:08.160 --> 02:25:14.720]  ready to stand up for freedom and who value being real and who value other people's success
[02:25:14.720 --> 02:25:24.480]  just as much or more as their own existential envy is our enemy
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:33.360]  and i will read to you again the definition of it by the man who invented the term existential
[02:25:33.360 --> 02:25:39.200]  envy which is directed against the other person's very nature is the strongest source of resentment
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:47.040]  it is as if it whispers continually i can forgive everything but not that you are
[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:56.560]  that you are what you are that i am not what you are indeed that i am not you this form of
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:04.080]  envy strips the opponent of their very existence dehumanized for this existence as such is felt
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:11.360]  to be a pressure a reproach an unbearable humiliation in the lives of great men there are
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:16.960]  always critical periods of instability in which they alternatively envy and try to love those
[02:26:16.960 --> 02:26:24.000]  whose merits they cannot but esteem only gradually one of these attitudes will predominate here lies
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:30.640]  the meaning of gothah's reflection that against another's great merits there is no remedy but love
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:37.040]  that's right and i sort of noted this and this is a child if there was somebody winning the
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:41.520]  football game that we were playing or someone that could draw better or someone who could do
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:46.080]  better math or some girl that was you know more cute than somebody else's girlfriend
[02:26:46.080 --> 02:26:49.680]  they would always announce yeah but their parents are getting divorced and you know she's
[02:26:49.680 --> 02:26:55.440]  she's you know you know she's got eczema or she's a loser or no i would always hear losers
[02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:00.720]  announce the imminent downfall of anyone who was more successful than them always announce
[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:07.280]  the how the how the person had failed and how they had won instead of just going wow that person
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:11.360]  can really play football or well that girl's really beautiful or well great man how do you do
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:18.320]  math like that well where is the shared celebration like life is a giant party
[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:26.800]  out under the trees in the forest a big feast with everybody dancing around celebrating
[02:27:26.800 --> 02:27:31.040]  something somebody's not a good dancer they fall on their butt in front of everyone everybody
[02:27:31.040 --> 02:27:35.440]  laughs lovingly while they're the greatest dancer of the night for getting up there
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:41.200]  up on the table with their big cup of ale and dancing dancing for humanity
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:46.880]  instead of just sitting around and that's why i talked about this today and we're
[02:27:46.880 --> 02:27:51.120]  going to break come back with your calls the reason i brought up existential envy today
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:27:57.440]  is because if you look at the globalist as above so below to use their alchemist maximum
[02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:06.640]  it's the new world order that's envious it's the unhappy royal queens and kings 170 years ago 160
[02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:12.480]  years ago mad at the beautiful maidens mad at the at the strong
[02:28:12.480 --> 02:28:22.560]  long nights and soldiers and shipbuilders and captains and sailors mad that they were living
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:27.920]  they were humanity they were strength they were competition not the degradated inbred failure
[02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:34.560]  and so they developed science to make themselves god and to make us ugly in their existential envy
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:40.480]  and that's why they have human sacrifice of the commoners and while they try to dumb us down
[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:45.840]  every sick inbred elite that comes to power because they have total existential envy
[02:28:47.280 --> 02:28:52.880]  of whoever is more beautiful than them and we see this in all the fairy tales snow white is just
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:29:00.720]  a rewrite of a bunch of german fairy tales where the queen is angry at the young maiden who's more
[02:29:00.720 --> 02:29:05.520]  beautiful than her anybody that's lived knows how evil some women get if they don't mature
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:12.400]  when they get older and how obsessed and vain and wicked they become because they have existential
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:16.880]  envy of other women and young men as well because they don't think they can have them anymore
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:25.360]  or the existential envy that you see manifesting at every level of society that's why they put
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:30.560]  cancer viruses on our vaccine and fluoride in our water so they can sit back and laugh and know
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:36.240]  that they literally stunted us but even through our stunted haze we have seen beyond the mountaintops
[02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:42.960]  there's nothing more stunted than trying to hold people back you are failures you are damn the
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:48.720]  hell and you know it and i declare the victory of humanity for god's promise against your black
[02:29:48.720 --> 02:30:03.040]  feet against humanity the empire i began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping

[02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:23.280]  it's alex jones at the top of the season when the blood runs high oh give it to me
[02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:36.560]  so what does the culture sell existential ending but the minute you can admire
[02:33:37.920 --> 02:33:44.800]  and the minute you can love others is the minute other healthy people will open up to you
[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:50.800]  and i know i'm saying things that are common sense to those of you out there that
[02:33:50.800 --> 02:33:59.680]  are not absolutely dominated by existential envy praise god you're not but this is the driving force
[02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:06.960]  in culture and what they're bombarding the youth with what they are marinating the women in what
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:15.760]  they are dominating the men with this is the problem women especially as they get old they're
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:20.000]  supposed to take on loving their grandkids and great grandkids taking care of the men that
[02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:29.840]  usually die before them working in the garden painting becoming fulfilled being sage sages to
[02:34:29.840 --> 02:34:34.800]  their families with their wisdom but if a woman doesn't go on the path of wisdom early just like a
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:42.320]  man they will become a truly wicked hateful creature and all of us face these challenges
[02:34:42.880 --> 02:34:49.120]  i've become meaner as i get older i've become more frustrated because i'm smarter i see things
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:54.000]  clear it's just i've got to work on not becoming a mean old man
[02:34:56.880 --> 02:35:02.320]  so i'm not up here judging anybody i'm just breaking down the fact that
[02:35:04.480 --> 02:35:11.040]  existential envy is the big problem i've seen people destroy their careers make stuff up do
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:15.280]  incredibly horrible things things are even bad for their businesses bad for their pocketbooks
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:22.160]  bad immoral just so they can try to defeat someone like a villain in a movie when i was a kid growing
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:28.240]  up i'd watch villains at movies and cartoons these powerful art types and i think how ridiculous
[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:34.160]  why would the why would the witch be mad that she wasn't invited to the birthday party uh for sleeping
[02:35:34.160 --> 02:35:39.280]  beauty so she takes over the whole kingdom and basically puts everybody into a trance
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:47.840]  when she never even asked to be invited it doesn't matter the wicked witch didn't like seeing people
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:51.920]  having a good time and wanted to screw things up and poison the well
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:59.840]  that's what they do and they get a thrill out of running our lives
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:07.360]  then you got just the run of the mill control freaks that are scared of everything and
[02:36:07.360 --> 02:36:12.000]  and get a thrill out of running everybody's lives and sometimes there's good instincts
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:18.720]  behind that but that could be twisted to the enemy's aims enough of me ranting about that
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:22.640]  i'm gonna go through all the calls that are on hold then into this stack of news by the way
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:26.800]  rick perry again who i'm not falling in love with or anything rick perry's been on the show and
[02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:32.240]  called me a big fat ugly hog before i guess it was kind of true and i've said he should get in big
[02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:38.240]  trouble uh for gar to sell lying and saying it was the law to take it all because he got convinced
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:42.480]  by murk it was good for people when we brought him the documents it was killing people in trials
[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:48.320]  they say that's what really hurts his presidential chances um but rick perry has tried to not let the
[02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:52.800]  blm take land and he has actually put the state police on the border and so for those sins the
[02:36:52.800 --> 02:36:56.560]  democrats have indicted him for doing his job i mean that's what you're supposed to do is veto
[02:36:56.560 --> 02:37:02.880]  funding for a state agency that is implemented by the county when it's run by a psycho drunk woman
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:08.640]  who indicts the wrong people i have a friend whose brother was indicted by her and when they brought
[02:37:08.640 --> 02:37:13.920]  rosemary lenberg the documents and said number one these are two brothers that look a lot alike
[02:37:13.920 --> 02:37:20.160]  number two the people claiming that sid steiner jumped out with a gun he was not even in the
[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:26.400]  city when that happened and shane steiner didn't even do that we have witnesses the people just
[02:37:26.400 --> 02:37:31.200]  thought they could get some money from rich people some of the richest people around here
[02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:35.440]  and she said basically she didn't care
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:42.240]  and the indictment stood and then they had to go to the grand jury and get them to make a big
[02:37:42.240 --> 02:37:47.600]  noise before it got dropped she knew that it was shane steiner who's been a guest on the show he
[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:57.040]  goes shooting with him but i went to high school with she knew that tommy shane steiner was the
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:02.880]  one that had the altercation in front of his house and she was going to go ahead with trying to put
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:13.840]  sid steiner world champion steer wrestler people might know the name in prison for a decade knowing
[02:38:13.840 --> 02:38:18.720]  he was innocent this is a woman who makes goblin faces and screams and points her finger like she's
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:23.520]  going to shoot cops when she's in jail kicking her feet and literally flopping around and rick
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:29.280]  perry says you got to step down and they have indicted him and i think we should get shane and
[02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:32.560]  sit in here and actually have them tell that testimony i know they're friends with rick perry
[02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:38.800]  too uh and and so people understand they arrested her right by shane's house by the way over there
[02:38:38.800 --> 02:38:46.240]  it's kind of ranch driving on the wrong side of the road three times over the legal limit can we
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:50.000]  get to the newscast part where she's in the jail cell flopping around kicking making demon faces
[02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:57.440]  yeah spitting on everybody meanwhile i mean i just know the state law rick perry did what he
[02:38:57.440 --> 02:39:02.800]  should be he should be impeached if he didn't do this this is actually what a governor is supposed
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:08.320]  to do well now he has had to basically turn his firearms in he has to either say that there is
[02:39:08.320 --> 02:39:13.520]  wife in a locks uh safe or he can be swat teamed and he better get the guns out of his house and
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:19.520]  they'll do it you know they run this town felony indictment presents uh prevents governor perry
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:24.480]  from carrying or buying guns democrat driven charges against republican governor are proving

[02:40:11.040 --> 02:40:13.680]  indicting the wrong person and then saying i don't care
[02:40:16.640 --> 02:40:23.600]  that's the arrogance of power and you can get a local boss hog that's just as bad as hitler
[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:27.760]  you let it go long enough by the way i mean i know full no full well criticizing this woman
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:34.480]  she might indict me for something i know she's been reportedly running persecution programs against

[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:44.160]  we blame people like her and ourselves for letting laws and regulations be put in place
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:50.480]  that are this out of control that's all i'm saying matthew in south carolina you had one last thought
[02:40:50.480 --> 02:40:54.880]  been gauze investigation your congressman yeah i look for your congressman to get set up and put
[02:40:54.880 --> 02:40:59.280]  in jail they're arresting a lot of people right now but they can't throw us all in jail can they
[02:40:59.840 --> 02:41:05.920]  staff and um she has the same opinion but um one thing i was going to say for your listeners they
[02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:12.400]  need to need to reach out and support traig outie for what he's doing as well as um you know perhaps
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:17.840]  your staff reach out to him maybe you can um get him on the air perhaps i don't know how well that
[02:41:17.840 --> 02:41:24.160]  might work out but um i i honestly think he's fighting the good fight and there are not very
[02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:30.720]  many people in washington they're doing that and um i'm i would i would tell you some jerry brown
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:34.800]  governor moonbeam stories but i'm not going to get into that now because i know you got other
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:41.920]  callers on hold now go ahead you held a wall tell us your moonbeam story i remember he said all
[02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:49.840]  sorts of crazy stuff well yeah i mean you know i mean jerry brown who when he ran for the democratic
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:56.960]  um nomination when he was running against clinton came and spoke at my college and um i was
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:02.960]  unfortunate or fortunate enough to actually be the one that kind of you know handled most of the
[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:10.080]  you know the in and out and everything and uh but he knew where he's standing on this whole
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:15.200]  immigration thing now this is the guy that was like screaming up and down about you know letting
[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:21.840]  vietnamese come into california when he was governor before yeah you know why vietnamese
[02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:28.080]  that want to leave communist vietnam are about 80 conservative so it's the politics not the skin
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:34.080]  color they want people that will vote democrat and vote for gun control as long as they get a paycheck
[02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:42.960]  and and again that's who's coming out of central america and speaking as a student of philosophy
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:48.800]  you break down existentialism existential envy you break it down very well i think for the layman
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:54.080]  no i just wanted to say that now let's you get on your other college thank you brother thank you
[02:42:54.080 --> 02:43:04.560]  for calling matthew yeah it's people that that if you win a big award your girlfriend gets mad at
[02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:12.080]  you or if uh your wife does you get this promotion and you go home and your husband gets drunk and
[02:43:12.080 --> 02:43:20.480]  breaks stuff i mean these are this is the problem this is one of the big problems somebody in my
[02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:25.280]  family when's the lottery i'm happy for somebody in my family invent something new makes a million
[02:43:25.280 --> 02:43:34.960]  dollars i'm happy for them losers have envy of people that are more successful than winners
[02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:40.960]  admire successful people that have done it by working hard and being inventive now nothing
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:44.960]  makes me more disgusted and it's not envy i don't envy warren buffett for his hundreds of billions
[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:51.760]  of dollars it's hundreds of billions not just the 40 billion you hear conservatively it's that
[02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:56.720]  he's tax exempt he wants my guns he runs all these scams shutting down american industry
[02:43:56.720 --> 02:44:02.720]  with him and george soros and he is perching on everybody exempt from it while pushing existential
[02:44:02.720 --> 02:44:11.280]  envy it's not that he has jets it's not that he owns dairy queen or wells fargo
[02:44:13.040 --> 02:44:16.160]  it's that he's a fraud and a scammer and a big fat cancer
[02:44:18.160 --> 02:44:24.240]  and a gangster because he's always on tv eating an ice cream or being a little old man oh jeepers
[02:44:24.240 --> 02:44:30.640]  what's going on see real villains go oh jeepers i don't know what's going on i'm a little old man
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:37.680]  temper palpatine folks not a little old man michael in michigan thanks for holding you're a trooper
[02:44:37.680 --> 02:44:44.400]  you're on the air worldwide michelle excuse me i can't read the screen michelle in michigan i
[02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:52.640]  apologize go ahead well i wanted to ask you you know under the constitution it says that any law
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:59.840]  that's passed that goes against the constitution is null and void so what's your take on this
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:05.520]  is it just because everybody's gotten out of control in complicity because there's lithium in
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:11.680]  the water what what do you think it's been a gradual seduction in the last 70 years people
[02:45:11.680 --> 02:45:17.600]  brought up in front of television sets and just spectators that just think of themselves is going
[02:45:17.600 --> 02:45:23.520]  to work being told what to do going home watching tv doing it all over again turning our kids over
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:29.200]  to the state turning our whole culture over to whatever we're told to do complying has caused it
[02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:35.040]  because in a natural tribal situation complying with the elders as long as they have good direction
[02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:40.800]  and tell us where to go hunt and what to do one day will be the elders it makes sense but when you
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:46.720]  comply with the elders when they're eugenicists who want to kill you it's not a very good idea
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:52.720]  and so people are in a literal brain damage trance i have articles on it today i'll get to in a moment
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:46:00.400]  they're in a brain damage trance and it's so complex people think something complex is hard
[02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:05.600]  and a headache no no no once you learn complexities it becomes like a game you want to learn the rest
[02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:11.280]  of it it's like a crossword puzzle the harder the better so people have just never been taught
[02:46:11.280 --> 02:46:16.080]  how to enjoy learning that's why they call it critical thinking in public schools it's meant to
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:22.480]  shut off critical thinking it's meant to make it as boring as possible so that people just
[02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:26.640]  believe television and believe movies they don't believe what's happening right in front of their
[02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:36.480]  face the public is under mind control brings up another factor because the federal government
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:46.400]  has allowed uh the state money our money through taxpayer dollars to go back in to brainwash these
[02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:53.520]  kids and not understand what the constitution is and understand what free enterprise is
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:47:01.200]  they don't have a clue in nowadays you can't even understand you can't even relay that
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:07.520]  to the kids because they don't understand it that's right 1984 the people are so dumbed down
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:12.560]  wenson who's a generation older can't even talk to them they don't even have language they have
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:18.960]  slogans racism racism racism i mean sexism sexism exact same thing you know i don't want to turn
[02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:26.640]  my guns in shut up white racist you know part of the issue too is is that now we're at a point
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:34.640]  in time where most of the people are 65 plus as a consequence what better time to take over a country
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:40.480]  with uh that's it you got the majority of people who've been paying into something
[02:47:40.480 --> 02:47:46.000]  about to go on the government dole it's your money but it was all set up to to control you
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:50.320]  and they got the illegals coming in to finish the job they'll be dependent and then it's just game
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:55.520]  over unless we point out under the constitution you can't make me your slave with your vote
[02:47:55.520 --> 02:48:01.440]  two wolves can't vote to make the sheep dinner roast lamb in a republic it doesn't matter if you got
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:08.160]  100 wolves they can't vote to eat the sheep slavery is illegal we're saying no and the bureaucracy
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:12.320]  though doesn't want the veterans so they're now announcing they're basically terrorist in the

[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:41.440]  what struck me though is sometimes in you know when you're listening in or watching an interview
[02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:47.920]  the things that are not discussed is what kind of sometimes is speaks the loudest and what i was
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:55.680]  wondering is joe rogan has been seen with stanton levée uh the grandson of anton levée the uh who
[02:48:55.680 --> 02:49:02.720]  was a priest of the satanic church and he is making those you know the esoteric uh hand gestures and
[02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:09.200]  whatnot why have you not questioned joe rogan on his association and what he actually was doing

[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:20.960]  when rick perry does the lda below it's for the university of texas let's get that clear joe rogan
[02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:27.920]  was not even really a spiritual person now he basically believes in god because of more of
[02:49:27.920 --> 02:49:33.440]  his research and things joe is not a satanist he's been to thousands of red carpets somebody sent

[02:49:52.640 --> 02:49:57.520]  get to a lot of weird stuff i don't agree with everything joe does but i've known joe since 1998

[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:33.440]  only to retweet them one of them is ten conspiracy theories that came true the others fbi ordered

[03:00:50.640 --> 03:00:55.840]  i guarantee you the the people that are always attacking me to have taken videos where i've
[03:00:55.840 --> 03:01:02.640]  been describing uh how the diabolo sign used to be an ancient italian thing for warding off evil
[03:01:02.640 --> 03:01:08.720]  or it can be a symbol for ut football uh or it can be the sign i guess of a cow in some sign language
[03:01:08.720 --> 03:01:14.560]  or it can be the sign uh of you know you like devil worship or something like the all-seeing
[03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:19.440]  eye was an ancient symbol of awakening now it's been taken by the new world order and i guess by
[03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:24.560]  lord of the ring so it's a symbol of evil it's just it's just it's these obsessions with symbols
[03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:29.280]  instead of content and that's how the globalist masquerade is good guys because they're wearing
[03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:35.040]  a worn buffett little suit i'm a little nice old man you know he actually super hardcore tyrant
[03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:41.920]  who wants your guns if you weren't a devil outfit the guys that want to look scary it's a joke
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:50.640]  it's the people that don't look scary better watch out for folks uh matt in north carolina
[03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:55.520]  thanks for holding her on the air welcome hey what's going on the worldwide broadcast sir thank
[03:01:55.520 --> 03:02:01.120]  you for calling in hey no problem and look i was only give you a perspective on the illegal
[03:02:01.120 --> 03:02:06.800]  immigration that most people aren't getting when the economy is down there's only two ways to
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:13.360]  increase the the economy that's increase exports or increase immigration when people come over the
[03:02:13.360 --> 03:02:19.440]  border they have to have homes clothes etc things to live actually you're right that's the establishment's
[03:02:19.440 --> 03:02:23.520]  argument is the baby boomers didn't have enough kids to replace them we got to bring these people
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:28.960]  in i get it bring in skilled people i don't care what color they are don't bring in moms with three
[03:02:28.960 --> 03:02:35.120]  kids that'll bankrupt the system absolutely and if they try to use these people as a voting
[03:02:35.120 --> 03:02:40.960]  block that's just an extra for them that's just a bonus for them now what people have to understand
[03:02:40.960 --> 03:02:47.760]  is that yes they do want a north american union or whatever that's just a name you know i mean
[03:02:47.760 --> 03:02:54.240]  this is part of their order out of chaos their chaos is not having control of everything you
[03:02:54.240 --> 03:03:00.720]  understand what exactly so they introduce chaos to then fix it which means more control more control
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:05.680]  for them and this all leads back and people have to understand they have to look at what's going on
[03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:11.440]  when it looks like the car is heading for the ditch there's a reason for that the car is heading
[03:03:11.440 --> 03:03:20.000]  for the ditch you follow what i mean yes sir 9 11 the north american union the tanking of the economy
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:27.280]  all of this is was all pre-planned and quite masterfully and and in a lot of ways it was done
[03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:33.120]  sloppy but the people bought it so you know if the bar is low you don't have to jump real high
[03:03:33.680 --> 03:03:39.440]  so people just really really need to look at what's going on and we've got to do something
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:45.120]  both now is the time you know if everybody goes and takes their money out of the bank you're not
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:50.000]  going to cause a depression because you're in the middle of a depression you know now we're either
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:55.040]  going to go left or we're going to go right that's it well that's right and we're converting to a
[03:03:55.040 --> 03:04:00.160]  pure fraud economy when that happens like mouse a tongue tens of millions die i mean this is this
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:04.640]  is not a joke this is hardcore serious it's only going to get worse until we have a full awakening
[03:04:04.640 --> 03:04:09.680]  to it and start reversing it and the system knows that they're trying to wreck it as fast as they can
[03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:16.960]  then poses saviors you know i did tim in california says he's a marine captain supports info wars i'm

[03:04:26.960 --> 03:04:30.960]  of this break a lot of great callers here today you know on the whole joe rogan thing if that
[03:04:30.960 --> 03:04:35.760]  caller would have called and said why does joe rogan been photographed with an tom of a's grandson
[03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:40.640]  doing a devil sign i would then say oh that's a good question joe said that was a joke at some
[03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:46.080]  party uh i know joe to be a really you know nice guy who uh you know cares about animals
[03:04:46.080 --> 03:04:49.920]  everything else but i was interviewing him just about being a popular guy i've known for a long
[03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:54.880]  time uh so i don't agree with everything he does instead it was why are you not bringing this up

[03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:50.400]  give us your take on what's happening hey alex how you doing good buddy
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:57.360]  hey i just want to let you know alex i was in the marine corps for 15 years uh i was a police
[03:09:57.360 --> 03:10:02.640]  officer out here in los angeles and uh i worked at the security private security contract for
[03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:09.760]  the state department for many years in the middle east and i witnessed firsthand the tyranny uh i
[03:10:09.760 --> 03:10:21.760]  witnessed firsthand the oppression that our our so-called uh leaders uh uh start over there and um
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:27.440]  i witnessed a lot of a lot of things over there and i just want to say that you're right on right
[03:10:27.440 --> 03:10:34.400]  on course you're born in the american public and that that's what's most important when i was at
[03:10:34.400 --> 03:10:41.040]  bill berg 2008 and hillary and obama were inside it was plain clothes marines assigned to the state
[03:10:41.040 --> 03:10:48.800]  department protective detail that were pulling dirty tricks on us and uh it was just blew me away
[03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:54.640]  the first few days how much they hated us now later whatever they'd been told they figured
[03:10:54.640 --> 03:10:59.680]  out wasn't true so they didn't act like that anymore but dirty tricks flipping us off messing with us
[03:10:59.680 --> 03:11:06.800]  threatening me in the hallway in my own hotel just all sorts of stuff uh are you familiar with
[03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:14.880]  anything like that uh yes alex i'm very familiar with these tactics that are used um it's mostly um
[03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:23.840]  tactics that are uh passed down from from higher ups in the uh the subordinate marines are not
[03:11:23.840 --> 03:11:29.360]  really aware of what they're doing they're just following orders unfortunately and that uh makes it
[03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:36.320]  difficult for all of us um it's a very touching situation and uh i don't i don't condone it i
[03:11:36.320 --> 03:11:43.200]  don't like it uh like i said i'm a retired marine and um i really if there's anything i could do to
[03:11:43.200 --> 03:11:48.560]  help i would love to come in uh maybe be part of your journalistic team or help you out well i'll
[03:11:48.560 --> 03:11:53.040]  tell you brother it'd be great to have an honorable discharge marine captain doing stuff with us just
[03:11:53.040 --> 03:11:57.360]  what you should start doing is doing your own youtube's even they're low tech and just show
[03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:01.760]  us what you got show us what's going on show us what you're interested in and then we're looking
[03:12:01.760 --> 03:12:06.320]  for auxiliary reporters we're looking for a few uh part-time paid positions on the west coast east
[03:12:06.320 --> 03:12:11.760]  coast north and south i mean we're looking for five or six we're trying to the problem is organizing
[03:12:11.760 --> 03:12:17.280]  it we have the money but we need to organize it and then because you know we're responsible for what
[03:12:17.280 --> 03:12:22.080]  our reporters do to try to get the training in place while we're doing so many other things but
[03:12:22.080 --> 03:12:28.960]  uh folks that want to work with us do videos do your own reporting uh you know under your own banner
[03:12:28.960 --> 03:12:34.080]  and send it to us as an example of it and you know i mean if people do acorn uh type work you know
[03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:41.200]  like uh project veritas did uh or whatever the case is i mean we had a reporter contest that's
[03:12:41.200 --> 03:12:45.760]  how we ended up hiring david night jacari jackson and others uh darren mcbrain you name it darren
[03:12:45.760 --> 03:12:49.600]  mcbrain sent us videos for another contest he didn't win the contest but he got a job here
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:54.400]  does great job on graphics and as a reporter so that's how it works tim god bless you i appreciate
[03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:58.560]  your call call back again tell us some of the stories i know you can't tell a lot of them but
[03:12:58.560 --> 03:13:04.400]  i know what it is tens of billions and pallets of money to pay locals off uh contractors engaging
[03:13:04.400 --> 03:13:10.240]  in all sorts of crimes uh government officials you know doing all sorts of horrible things i mean
[03:13:10.240 --> 03:13:16.880]  it's just all part of the course because to engage in tyranny you got to be pretty immoral
[03:13:16.880 --> 03:13:21.680]  not not the troops themselves with the but the higher ups and so you see a lot of immoral stuff
[03:13:21.680 --> 03:13:26.000]  there's not the heroes you see on the news eric in origan you're on the air go ahead
[03:13:27.440 --> 03:13:34.000]  hey alex what's up oh we're just here on air brother thanks for calling okay uh i got a little
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:40.640]  information for you uh concerning ncia uh i just spent seven years in a work camp

[03:13:48.160 --> 03:13:57.600]  industries association of america uh it was a cta facility right i tried america has a gulag
[03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:03.200]  archipelago of four million prisoners many of them deserve be there many don't competing directly
[03:14:03.200 --> 03:14:10.080]  with mainline industry for pennies on the dollar driving down wages exactly that they're they're
[03:14:10.080 --> 03:14:16.320]  forced labor camps um actually they're called civilian inmate labor camp program it's under the
[03:14:16.320 --> 03:14:23.200]  department of army and is a partially secret yes yes yes yes of course well we're seeing the
[03:14:23.200 --> 03:14:30.480]  effect of it it coming up um like uh the creamer camps uh whatever you want to call them they're
[03:14:30.480 --> 03:14:37.440]  all being unified integrated into these work camps and the felonies are being manufactured
[03:14:37.440 --> 03:14:45.280]  at a very fast rate everyone's becoming felon and the scary part is right now they're entertaining
[03:14:45.280 --> 03:14:56.320]  uh national recalls for people on parole uh if you have misdemeanor anything national recalls to uh camps
[03:14:59.280 --> 03:15:02.960]  yeah for those that don't know they call them work camps and they're federally run
[03:15:02.960 --> 03:15:08.080]  and they're using state prisoners now a lot of them are at military bases and the good old boys
[03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:15.120]  go well make them criminals work they got cable tv and you know masseuses no that's not true uh it
[03:15:15.120 --> 03:15:21.120]  is slave labor in this country and and now they're going after white collar workers you name it people
[03:15:21.120 --> 03:15:25.360]  that have literally done nothing it's a very frightening paradigm you should do youtube videos
[03:15:25.360 --> 03:15:31.040]  on it even if it's under a pen name a gnome to plume uh and and just expose it in the chronicles
[03:15:31.040 --> 03:15:34.640]  i bless you i appreciate your call by the way these are some of the things i wanted to put in
[03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:40.400]  the article but we didn't and and the folks are actually saying it on info wars dot com uh in the
[03:15:40.400 --> 03:15:50.160]  article uh tin conspiracy theories that came true and people are actually bringing up some of the
[03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:56.480]  ones i wanted to add but didn't lakosa nostra they said that didn't exist uh hoover said that death
[03:15:56.480 --> 03:16:02.480]  panels they said that didn't exist in the american care act uh the nsa that didn't exist but we actually
[03:16:02.480 --> 03:16:08.480]  have that in there yeah this is conspiracy theories that got completely proven and admitted people are
[03:16:08.480 --> 03:16:16.560]  saying 9 11 um iris targeting of conservatives they denied that turned out they did black helicopters
[03:16:16.560 --> 03:16:23.840]  turned out to be confirmed oh yeah let's add all that absolutely the uss liberty turned out to be
[03:16:23.840 --> 03:16:28.480]  true we should add that
[03:16:30.720 --> 03:16:34.160]  and you pretty much say jfk has been proven but it's not been openly admitted
[03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:37.600]  so people are putting a lot of stuff in there
[03:16:40.400 --> 03:16:44.960]  yeah in fact we should change the subheadline i'm not bashing paul wrote this article with him
[03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:47.120]  but i didn't do the headline um
[03:16:47.120 --> 03:16:56.240]  um when questioning the official narrative proved crucial 10 conspiracy theories that came true
[03:16:58.400 --> 03:17:03.680]  10 theories that turned out to be fact i don't know it's all pretty good actually
[03:17:03.680 --> 03:17:08.800]  but we're going to add some of those other points in there okay uh let's go to robert

[03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:02.960]  to attack us i don't go after them because i believe in free speech as long as people don't
[03:19:02.960 --> 03:19:07.600]  call for violence or lie about us uh but even then i don't even do anything about it because it
[03:19:07.600 --> 03:19:10.800]  doesn't do anything to us i mean the truth's the truth i'm not worried about it but god bless
[03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:16.400]  your brother that's very exciting anything else no sir thank you thank you yeah that's a great
[03:19:16.400 --> 03:19:22.720]  thing especially if we have an am or fm affiliate in the area like oklahoma city a new affiliate
[03:19:22.720 --> 03:19:28.800]  we just got or chicago or wherever the case is uh or los vegas or wherever i would call the station
[03:19:28.800 --> 03:19:34.080]  and say hey you're your radio station i bet you know how to get a good deal billboards are really
[03:19:34.080 --> 03:19:37.680]  cheap right now because that market's collapsed they're still very effective it's just economies
[03:19:37.680 --> 03:19:42.640]  and a depression so you know i mean it's just most billboards are empty first haggling down to a low
[03:19:42.640 --> 03:19:46.960]  price you can probably get three billboards but the first price they're gonna tell you call the
[03:19:46.960 --> 03:19:51.360]  station say i want to put this message up plug in your station alexione's website let's do it through
[03:19:51.360 --> 03:19:55.920]  you then there won't even be a question with the ad company and the local station calls up to promote
[03:19:55.920 --> 03:19:59.520]  their host i think that's the best way to do it i'm out of time started all the other callers not
[03:19:59.520 --> 03:20:27.600]  one is that
