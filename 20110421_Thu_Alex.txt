[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:32.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.880 --> 00:41.360]  it is Thursday the 21st day of April 2011 we're gonna be live here for at least
[00:41.360 --> 00:46.560]  the next three hours probably going to overdrive we've got no me friends big
[00:46.560 --> 00:52.160]  Goldman Sachs insider joining us she was on a few months ago talking about the
[00:52.160 --> 00:55.520]  fact that it was only a matter of time before standard and pours Moody's and
[00:55.520 --> 01:00.480]  others began to delist the United States triple-a rating that will then
[01:00.480 --> 01:06.360]  massively increase the national debt and your private borrowing as interest
[01:06.360 --> 01:11.880]  rates surge and of course the trends forecaster Gerald Salente will also be
[01:11.880 --> 01:18.040]  joining us coming up in the third hour every day it only intensifies the amount
[01:18.040 --> 01:24.180]  of jam-packed news more and more independent aid agencies radiological
[01:24.180 --> 01:29.120]  researchers are going into the two prefectures in around Fukushima that
[01:29.120 --> 01:33.560]  the Japanese government now says maybe nine months a year two years it may be
[01:33.560 --> 01:39.080]  melting down and belching deadly radiation for a long time five of the
[01:39.080 --> 01:44.120]  six reactors seriously damaged some of them melted down more than 70% now
[01:44.120 --> 01:51.720]  Japan is banning entry into Fukushima evacuation zone banning entry into it so
[01:51.720 --> 01:56.680]  incredible information on that front but right past the 12 mile line they've
[01:56.680 --> 02:00.560]  still got the kids going to school every day and still got them drinking the
[02:00.560 --> 02:05.040]  milk eating the seafood and here in the US they're shipping the seafood in the
[02:05.040 --> 02:09.440]  milk also showing higher levels of radioactive isotopes and it's just
[02:09.440 --> 02:14.760]  out of sight out of mind I mean look baseball season started and dancing with
[02:14.760 --> 02:20.400]  the stars is on American Idol we have more important things to do here than
[02:20.400 --> 02:26.520]  worrying about this so I'm going to be going over that report today I saw this
[02:26.520 --> 02:33.280]  two days ago and it's such old passÃ© news for us that I barely mentioned it
[02:33.280 --> 02:37.240]  but this morning reading back over these articles and there's more out today I
[02:37.240 --> 02:42.400]  just thought it was interesting that they have top analysts not quite sure
[02:42.400 --> 02:49.280]  what what Apple's doing and they believe that the secret software on the
[02:49.280 --> 02:55.560]  phones triangulates with cell towers to give the GPS location they know it's
[02:55.560 --> 03:02.720]  being recorded and when you log in to your iTunes to sync your phone Apple's
[03:02.720 --> 03:08.240]  getting the data and they're wondering what's happening and what's behind it
[03:08.240 --> 03:17.880]  and Apple two three days into this Apple won't won't comment on what's going on
[03:17.880 --> 03:29.280]  it's all in the telecommunications act of 1996 I have been covering this at
[03:29.280 --> 03:37.720]  nauseam since then and I'm not that smart of a person I know exactly what's
[03:37.720 --> 03:41.400]  going on with the phones there's a continuity of agenda in every Western
[03:41.400 --> 03:48.280]  country it was all been adopted in the last decade and in 96 the federal
[03:48.280 --> 03:53.800]  government through the FCC ordered all cell phone manufacturers they said you
[03:53.800 --> 04:00.960]  got five years until October 1st 2001 to have these phones trackable backdoors
[04:00.960 --> 04:05.240]  built into them triangulated by cell tower and we've got to be able to turn
[04:05.240 --> 04:13.360]  the phone on remotely and listen to people and at the time I covered it all
[04:13.360 --> 04:22.600]  I covered it 96 97 98 99 2000 2001 2002 2003 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 like I was just
[04:22.600 --> 04:31.040]  covering this again last week and here's everybody marveling and wondering it's
[04:31.040 --> 04:38.040]  not just Apple let me announce to you now it's all cell phones sold
[04:38.040 --> 04:43.120]  manufactured and sold after October 1st 2001 and most cell phone companies had
[04:43.120 --> 04:48.520]  already adopted this before then okay all your cell phones upload the
[04:48.520 --> 04:54.120]  information to the cell phone companies AT&T and their deal with Apple and then
[04:54.120 --> 04:59.480]  it's sold to the government they also make money on it okay if that's straight
[04:59.480 --> 05:03.200]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:03.200 --> 05:07.520]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.520 --> 05:11.680]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:11.680 --> 05:15.720]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:15.720 --> 05:19.600]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:19.600 --> 05:23.840]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:23.840 --> 05:28.040]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:28.040 --> 05:32.360]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:32.360 --> 05:36.080]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[05:36.080 --> 05:40.280]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[05:40.280 --> 05:43.640]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[08:19.120 --> 08:25.360]  next three hours probably longer into overdrive Gerald Salente on the SNP
[08:25.360 --> 08:31.600]  announcement obviously back on Monday that the United States outlook for
[08:31.600 --> 08:37.840]  keeping its triple a rating is negative that's only happened one other time the
[08:37.840 --> 08:45.480]  week after Pearl Harbor back in the early 1940s so he'll be joining us also
[08:45.480 --> 08:52.720]  know me Prince formerly a managing director with Goldman Sachs and a
[08:52.720 --> 08:56.520]  whistleblower will be joining us to break all of this down as well but
[08:56.520 --> 09:01.680]  remember the default has been designed this is how the private banking cartels
[09:01.680 --> 09:06.040]  gain control of nations and we have the IMF and World Bank's own internal
[09:06.040 --> 09:11.640]  documents that BBC got back in 2002 one of many documents confirming this was
[09:11.640 --> 09:15.280]  their plan I've been warning you intensely we'll even before that back in
[09:15.280 --> 09:18.880]  99 when they got rid of Glass-Steagall we had economists on warning you that
[09:18.880 --> 09:26.080]  this only ends one way total implosion a financial debt black hole for every
[09:26.080 --> 09:31.040]  dollar created a dollar of debt is created to the private bankers they
[09:31.040 --> 09:35.800]  make nothing they create nothing they pay off politicians and maneuver
[09:35.800 --> 09:41.120]  themselves into position to where their fiat digital numbers are accepted and
[09:41.120 --> 09:48.360]  they gain the world and the tiny Republican cuts of 39 to 40 billion
[09:48.360 --> 09:52.640]  they debate the number does nothing it's not even rearranging a deck chair on the
[09:52.640 --> 09:57.680]  Titanic it's more like somebody on the deck of the Titanic emptying an ashtray
[09:57.680 --> 10:02.800]  that had a cigar in it I mean it just it doesn't even affect anything that's
[10:02.800 --> 10:07.320]  total window dressing slashing all the welfare cutting Medicare cutting
[10:07.320 --> 10:12.080]  Medicaid freezing social security already with the Colas getting ready to cut
[10:12.080 --> 10:17.000]  it that will do nothing because under the Federal Reserve system it's designed
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.280]  to transfer all wealth to the globalist that set it up and I know you the
[10:23.280 --> 10:27.760]  listeners understand that but we had better get this information out to
[10:27.760 --> 10:36.560]  everyone we know immediately when you get this information out to everyone now
[10:36.560 --> 10:42.400]  because the very individuals that have engineered this know that society is
[10:42.400 --> 10:47.760]  going to implode just like Argentina or Weimar Republic or Zimbabwe or the
[10:47.760 --> 10:53.040]  things that have happened in Romania and Poland in the last 30 years there's
[10:53.040 --> 10:57.280]  going to be social unrest they're going to use the ignorance of the masses as a
[10:57.280 --> 11:03.320]  political weapon to then push for total socialism that will then transfer the
[11:03.320 --> 11:07.360]  wealth not to the people socialism also of course destroys wealth and doesn't
[11:07.360 --> 11:12.380]  work except if you're a parasitic group of corporate looters who again want to
[11:12.380 --> 11:16.600]  blow everything out and sell it all off to themselves for pennies on the dollar
[11:16.600 --> 11:22.280]  I saw more a people's out today where the vast majority of people making less
[11:22.280 --> 11:28.720]  than thirty thousand dollars a year want socialism and don't like capitalism the
[11:28.720 --> 11:34.080]  United States has been the wealthiest country in history the highest education
[11:34.080 --> 11:40.240]  level the most patents the fastest growth rates of wealth the largest middle
[11:40.240 --> 11:44.680]  class the wealthiest poor people I mean poor folks in the rest of the world are
[11:44.680 --> 11:49.760]  making less than two bucks a day their leg gets broken sorry they die no
[11:49.760 --> 11:53.520]  medical attention they're eating rice and beans and mud pies if they're lucky
[11:53.520 --> 11:58.680]  so you got the spoiled rotten poor and then the working class and then the
[11:58.680 --> 12:02.080]  lower middle class and all these spoiled people that don't live in the real
[12:02.080 --> 12:05.960]  world and I see the polls I see the numbers they've been taught capitalism
[12:05.960 --> 12:11.520]  had the banker steal trillions capitalism made GE not pay any taxes
[12:11.520 --> 12:15.520]  capitalism made Google not pay any taxes see the very elites that have done
[12:15.520 --> 12:21.560]  this are advertising their crimes but selling it that capitalism did it this
[12:21.560 --> 12:27.120]  is not free market capitalism we're seeing this is insiders fortune 100
[12:27.120 --> 12:31.160]  running the governments of the world as their private cash machines giving
[12:31.160 --> 12:35.080]  themselves giant corporate welfare and now they've got republicans scapegoating
[12:35.080 --> 12:39.560]  the welfare moms who are going to be the army that votes to take the guns and
[12:39.560 --> 12:43.960]  votes for socialism oh they're very dangerous in their slobbering ignorance
[12:43.960 --> 12:49.000]  on average some get it know what's happening the unions are very dangerous
[12:49.000 --> 12:53.880]  in their slobbering ignorance the general public the howling mob as the
[12:53.880 --> 12:57.880]  founders called them very dangerous they have to be bound down by the bill of
[12:57.880 --> 13:03.400]  rights and constitution so 51% of them can't be induced by the slick banker
[13:03.400 --> 13:08.320]  media to rob the other 49% of us while the banker sit offshore with a gold
[13:08.320 --> 13:13.640]  conduit like a mosquito flies up injects its proboscis into you injects a
[13:13.640 --> 13:18.160]  liquefying agent a anti-coagulant and sucks it up the
[13:18.160 --> 13:22.600]  mosquitoes offshore with its proboscis the federal government sucking us dry
[13:22.600 --> 13:26.640]  and the coagulant is the local governments that are destined to go
[13:26.640 --> 13:30.200]  bankrupt being told raise more money raise more money or you'll go bankrupt
[13:30.200 --> 13:34.480]  so the cops are out writing more tickets the fees the fines the sales taxes the
[13:34.480 --> 13:39.360]  property taxes the hospital district taxes the franchise taxes the
[13:39.360 --> 13:44.520]  environmental fees on and on the school fees the the cell phone fees all
[13:44.520 --> 13:51.520]  racing racing to get the money to keep their jobs when it's a black hole
[13:51.520 --> 13:59.840]  impossible to pay it pay off but they don't care they're going headlong over
[13:59.840 --> 14:05.280]  the cliff because they have a fetish for losing a fetish for being conned a
[14:05.280 --> 14:11.240]  fetish for being bamboozled a moth like obsession with flying into the flame
[14:11.240 --> 14:15.800]  well not me I'm not a mindless moth and you know what don't worry that they've
[14:15.800 --> 14:20.280]  got the mindless horde out there ready to gut their neighbor their neighbors
[14:20.280 --> 14:26.000]  got one more dollar than them we've got the thinkers they've got the miscreant
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.320]  globalist on top and their and their mindless vassals on the bottom many of
[14:30.320 --> 14:36.520]  which can be shaken out of their trances and we're gonna do that but I see the
[14:36.520 --> 14:39.600]  poll numbers and a lot of times I don't believe polls but I've seen historical
[14:39.600 --> 14:46.040]  polls wide indexes of polls and it's undoubtedly close to 70% of people making
[14:46.040 --> 14:51.520]  under $30,000 a year are ready to literally take your house your car your
[14:51.520 --> 14:54.880]  bank account they'll do it you know how the general public is now they've been
[14:54.880 --> 14:59.320]  trained to be backstabbing and evil and and petulant and and and and angry and
[14:59.320 --> 15:07.600]  and entitled and uncommunicative and they they wear their ignorance like a
[15:07.600 --> 15:12.800]  armor like a shield they are the dangerous weapon of the globalist what's
[15:12.800 --> 15:17.360]  democracy two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner we're a republic
[15:17.360 --> 15:22.680]  where we elect representatives and then the representatives are bound down and
[15:22.680 --> 15:27.720]  tied down by the Bill of Rights Constitution so that even a 51% or
[15:27.720 --> 15:33.960]  99% want to make you their slave by taking your tax money or in some cases
[15:33.960 --> 15:37.560]  making you dig ditches or making you serve as a conscript in the Imperial
[15:37.560 --> 15:41.840]  Army they can't do it that's why when the Michigan police and it's all over the
[15:41.840 --> 15:45.360]  country that the Michigan State Police have wireless systems grabbing
[15:45.360 --> 15:48.920]  everything off your cell phone and hacking them your photos your your your
[15:48.920 --> 15:53.440]  list your emails or when they pull you over for speeding they grab your phone
[15:53.440 --> 16:00.080]  plug it in and steal it TSA does it that's why when Detroit says we're not
[16:00.080 --> 16:05.040]  going to issue you a permit to protest Pastor Jones that's prior constraint
[16:05.040 --> 16:08.920]  that's the death of the First Amendment that's why when these kangaroo IRS
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.480]  courts take your house without due process it's the death of liberty it's
[16:13.480 --> 16:18.720]  the floodgates being opened for corruption and the armies of control freaks
[16:18.720 --> 16:22.800]  and people that simply want power over others and the system is ready to give
[16:22.800 --> 16:26.600]  them a uniform it's ready to give them a bureaucratic title it's ready to turn
[16:26.600 --> 16:32.960]  them loose on you and you try to explain to them hey the freer the system the
[16:32.960 --> 16:40.440]  more property rights the wealthier everybody is and they're like no no the
[16:40.440 --> 16:45.600]  poorest American is more wealthy than kings a thousand years ago when it
[16:45.600 --> 16:53.120]  comes to information medicine food but they don't appreciate it oh they're
[16:53.120 --> 16:57.440]  rich information-wise they're rich but they don't appreciate it and the
[16:57.440 --> 17:00.960]  globalist understand their human psychology they've carefully brought
[17:00.960 --> 17:06.200]  them up watching television seeing the culture monkey see monkey do the public
[17:06.200 --> 17:11.240]  is very dog-like very easy to be trained and the globalist are now
[17:11.240 --> 17:16.240]  maneuvering this system where they inflate the currency they get the system
[17:16.240 --> 17:20.360]  in debt artificially through fraud they build the Ponzi scheme up and instead of
[17:20.360 --> 17:24.280]  going to jail at the end of the Ponzi scheme like a Ken layer and Bernie made
[17:24.280 --> 17:31.920]  off they get total power and you're like but the Republicans are gonna stop them
[17:31.920 --> 17:38.920]  no they're not they're gonna bring an austerity and cut all of the entitlements
[17:38.920 --> 17:44.840]  are cut large portions of them so that all the money can go to banker bailouts
[17:44.840 --> 17:49.120]  so that all the money can go to the Rothschilds and Rockefellers and to
[17:49.120 --> 17:52.480]  private media that's paid off by the private fellow reserve on record your
[17:52.480 --> 17:57.360]  tax money buying off newspapers MSNBC and when you see Rachel Maddow that is a
[17:57.360 --> 18:01.320]  paid agent of the Rockefellers and Rothschilds who own the Federal Reserve
[18:01.320 --> 18:09.840]  I mean publicly think about the magnitude of that think about what they're
[18:09.840 --> 18:22.600]  doing in your face and it's so real it's it's happening now and it's people like

[21:04.040 --> 21:08.360]  information the US government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury
[21:08.360 --> 21:12.080]  continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign central
[21:12.080 --> 21:17.080]  banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds in order to rebuild
[21:17.080 --> 21:21.440]  its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling them currency
[21:21.440 --> 21:25.600]  manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about 70% of US
[21:25.600 --> 21:29.880]  Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our friends at the
[21:29.880 --> 21:33.640]  National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar will soon become

[23:59.840 --> 24:08.560]  no matter how hard you try you can't stop us now all right let me just do this
[24:08.560 --> 24:13.240]  let me read you the stacks of news here the headlines I've got that I want to
[24:13.240 --> 24:20.480]  go over in the next segment your iPhone is tracking your location history now I
[24:20.480 --> 24:23.880]  know that's been out for three days but if you're even a listener for the last
[24:23.880 --> 24:28.760]  few months you know I've told you this and I've given you the source of it it's
[24:28.760 --> 24:35.440]  the telecommunications act of 1996 by law all cell phones sold after October
[24:35.440 --> 24:42.640]  1st 2001 most of Marty had it in years before 99 2000 are tracked in real time
[24:42.640 --> 24:46.400]  and then I always get idiots send them emails going there's not GPS in the phone
[24:46.400 --> 24:52.080]  I know I read the telecommunications act it's cell tower triangulated down to
[24:52.080 --> 24:57.240]  three feet federal law says 15 it's accurate to three feet I mean I've
[24:57.240 --> 25:00.880]  ladies and gentlemen I read those sections the telecommunications act
[25:00.880 --> 25:07.080]  probably over a hundred times back in the 90s late 90s because it blew me away
[25:07.080 --> 25:12.000]  back then back then I wasn't conditioned yet to accept this stuff and it was like
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.640]  wow all the cell phones are gonna track us in real time and the government says
[25:17.640 --> 25:21.200]  in the telecommunications act they're gonna dial in and the phone has to be
[25:21.200 --> 25:25.920]  able to turn on even when it's off you can't see that it's on and record you
[25:25.920 --> 25:31.040]  with the NSA warrantlessly and they're gonna put up microphones all over the
[25:31.040 --> 25:34.200]  country and listen to us and face scanning cameras I mean it was just
[25:34.200 --> 25:41.280]  incredible stuff and here it is in the Guardian and the AP oh my gosh it ties
[25:41.280 --> 25:46.240]  into cell tower triangulation with the latitude and longitude and tracks you and
[25:46.240 --> 25:53.800]  when you hook it into your Apple iTunes it uploads the data to it now you have
[25:53.800 --> 25:56.720]  to read the telecommunications act to get all of that because it talks about
[25:56.720 --> 26:02.680]  systems that will then on board transmit it while the phones on it it gives
[26:02.680 --> 26:08.800]  basic broad specs as the technology changes so so let me explain the postal
[26:08.800 --> 26:14.720]  service is driving around the country and test vehicles with these electronic
[26:14.720 --> 26:18.800]  masks grabbing all your data automatically not hacking your phones and
[26:18.800 --> 26:24.120]  computers backdoors are built into all these under federal law and they just
[26:24.120 --> 26:28.800]  steal everything they datamined everything your photos everything Google
[26:28.800 --> 26:33.920]  does it Google uses microphones and cameras on the computers to listen and
[26:33.920 --> 26:37.320]  watch you how do I know six years ago they put a press release out and admitted
[26:37.320 --> 26:43.120]  it I mean see it's light years ahead and so back in the 90s I would freak out
[26:43.120 --> 26:47.600]  over this now I'm pretty much acclimated to it kind of like in Florida they had a
[26:47.600 --> 26:52.240]  Delta Force black helicopter drill and it's in the Miami Herald Herald never
[26:52.240 --> 26:55.520]  where else and if you talk about it you're called a conspiracy theorist even
[26:55.520 --> 27:01.120]  though it's in eight different papers in Florida and these are acclimation drills
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.240]  for military occupation the Delta Force and other military groups practice
[27:05.240 --> 27:09.400]  taking over city halls and things like this this was a Bank of America event I've
[27:09.400 --> 27:12.120]  interviewed emergency managers that blew the whistle and the police chief of
[27:12.120 --> 27:15.920]  San Antonio just Google Alex Jones interviews San Antonio police chief he
[27:15.920 --> 27:21.200]  admitted the Delta Force tried to bribe the city it's a covert takeover
[27:21.200 --> 27:25.720]  operation mainly securing narcotics routes the Delta Force itself is just
[27:25.720 --> 27:29.280]  there to condition the public that if they can blow up buildings in front of
[27:29.280 --> 27:34.160]  everybody and then call everybody cooks if you complain it's a Psyop and I'll
[27:34.160 --> 27:38.440]  explain that more later see I said I'd get to just reading some headlines and I
[27:38.440 --> 27:44.240]  started getting into just two of the stories and didn't I saw the president
[27:44.240 --> 27:49.640]  of programming at Fox News in New York magazine say Alex Jones may want to come
[27:49.640 --> 27:55.720]  to Fox but he's dreaming he needs to keep reporting on black helicopters well
[27:55.720 --> 27:58.800]  you know what I saw this two days ago with the black helicopters and didn't
[27:58.800 --> 28:02.240]  even report it and people are asking me why did why didn't you report it because
[28:02.240 --> 28:06.200]  I've been to so many urban warfare drills I have been alerted to where Delta
[28:06.200 --> 28:13.160]  Force is going to be in America and had armed troops come up and confiscate
[28:13.160 --> 28:17.800]  Mike Hansen's camera and put a 45 to his chest because he was arguing in
[28:17.800 --> 28:23.400]  America and and and detain us even though the police chief I mean I can be in
[28:23.400 --> 28:26.960]  San Antonio if I want but I just interviewed the police chief a week
[28:26.960 --> 28:29.840]  before and Delta Force said they didn't care what he said they were still there
[28:29.840 --> 28:34.520]  to do the drill and then we got to have MPs come and I didn't argue they had
[28:34.520 --> 28:38.200]  their and Mike did so he pulled the 45 out and pointed it at him and that's
[28:38.200 --> 28:42.720]  just what America is I mean you know so hey I don't report on it okay because
[28:42.720 --> 28:47.160]  they stick 45s in my face I mean I mean I forget all the adventures I've been
[28:47.160 --> 28:57.240]  through Brooksville Florida we've got footage of a lot of that oh my god we
[28:57.240 --> 29:02.320]  get off the airplane I tell no one when I'm flying in and in comes this special
[29:02.320 --> 29:07.240]  forces guy who'd been going around local Austin groups and you and you know
[29:07.240 --> 29:11.400]  trying to infiltrate and things it was just so obviously military and he goes
[29:11.400 --> 29:15.800]  I want to follow you I want to help you here I've got this you know car and I
[29:15.800 --> 29:21.080]  knew he was a Fed and I thought this will be interesting so we got our hotel we
[29:21.080 --> 29:26.960]  get our own rent car in Brooksville we flew into Tampa and then we're just out
[29:26.960 --> 29:30.520]  there trying to videotape special forces drills and people come out of their
[29:30.520 --> 29:34.320]  houses and go in neighborhoods your Alex Jones we're not supposed to talk to you

[32:22.280 --> 32:27.040]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[32:27.040 --> 32:30.840]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[33:12.000 --> 33:21.200]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network I'll never forget when I went down to
[33:21.200 --> 33:27.320]  Kingsville Texas where they just had an unannounced Delta Force drill with
[33:27.320 --> 33:33.200]  foreign troops and they'd rented the police station the day after the police
[33:33.200 --> 33:36.240]  moved out that they didn't tell the public the police had moved out to their
[33:36.240 --> 33:40.840]  new command center and they blew the building up 300 feet from Casa Ricardo
[33:40.840 --> 33:46.920]  nursing home and so I went down there and interviewed Thomas Sanchez the what
[33:46.920 --> 33:51.720]  Kingsville County emergency manager he himself had been an army intelligence in
[33:51.720 --> 33:58.040]  Vietnam you know real professional clean-cut smart guy and he went ahead and
[33:58.040 --> 34:02.720]  told me off record and then I got him on the radio to go on record that no they
[34:02.720 --> 34:06.000]  approached him with the same things they approach the chief police of
[34:06.000 --> 34:11.360]  San Antonio and offered him all this money will offer others money in the
[34:11.360 --> 34:15.760]  town to go along with it just testing the relationship with local communities
[34:15.760 --> 34:19.720]  to see if they would ever accept a military occupation that it's also
[34:19.720 --> 34:25.800]  used as a scyop and then you go to San Antonio the police chief has said don't
[34:25.800 --> 34:30.560]  do the drill there they do the drill we get tipped off by sources in the police
[34:30.560 --> 34:38.200]  department and they just have MPs come up and detain us in San Antonio and you
[34:38.200 --> 34:41.240]  can go to the Riverwalk folks they'll have MPs out there doing police work they
[34:41.240 --> 34:45.320]  just it's totally illegal they just do it and my Kansas starts arguing with them
[34:45.320 --> 34:50.800]  so the guy pulls his 45 out these plain clothes guys come up laughing at us look
[34:50.800 --> 34:54.600]  like retired type special forces you know 40 50 years old they take the
[34:54.600 --> 34:58.720]  camera erase the tape and give it back to us and say they're gonna have us
[34:58.720 --> 35:05.960]  arrested if we videotape anything else now that's America then a year later I
[35:05.960 --> 35:09.240]  go to Brooksville and it's in police state to the takeover and that's a true
[35:09.240 --> 35:16.560]  story this is who runs America is that all I did was to go show an urban
[35:16.560 --> 35:23.600]  warfare military drill and the guy that I was tipped off about and the army went
[35:23.600 --> 35:28.040]  door-to-door in a town and it's a big town looks like Mayberry but it's big
[35:28.040 --> 35:32.160]  and knocked on doors and people coming out of their houses going to you Alex
[35:32.160 --> 35:35.640]  Jones I've been told you're dangerous you're a cook I'm not supposed to talk
[35:35.640 --> 35:39.600]  to you and I go don't you think it's strange the army's coming to your door
[35:39.600 --> 35:44.880]  and then I'm out there at night trying to videotape I know full well the guy
[35:44.880 --> 35:52.200]  that's following us around is a special forces person and he starts trying to set
[35:52.200 --> 35:58.400]  fires and then they were gonna rush in and arrest us but I was able to stomp
[35:58.400 --> 36:01.840]  it out and he's trying to lie it again and I had to basically shove on him and
[36:01.840 --> 36:04.800]  yell at him and say okay I'm you may think you're tough buddy I'm about to
[36:04.800 --> 36:09.080]  stomp your guts out and I try to get on my cell phone to call the police he goes
[36:09.080 --> 36:13.200]  okay and it kind of just ran off into the woods by the way Mike Hansen was
[36:13.200 --> 36:18.280]  there a witness to that and here come the doom buggies and this is not on a
[36:18.280 --> 36:26.840]  military base and I guess you know today I wouldn't have run from them but back
[36:26.840 --> 36:29.560]  then I wanted to be able to videotape them and it's hard at night and back then
[36:29.560 --> 36:33.480]  I had cheap equipment you turn your you turn your night vision on on the cheap
[36:33.480 --> 36:40.360]  camera all it is is a projector that projects the light that the camera can
[36:40.360 --> 36:47.360]  pick up and so it looks like a spotlight to them and they were doing a drill of
[36:47.360 --> 36:56.800]  occupying the city of Brooksville Florida but I mean in America I as a
[36:56.800 --> 37:04.280]  journalist and back then I guess that was in about 99 I was on more than 30 or
[37:04.280 --> 37:11.120]  40 radio stations AM FM global shortwave satellite internet I mean the
[37:11.120 --> 37:14.040]  government knew I was nonviolent the government knew what I was there to do
[37:14.040 --> 37:22.240]  but the government is run by a pack of crooks and so they sent a guy out oh and
[37:22.240 --> 37:29.440]  our hotel room got robbed and money got taken to to I guess add us to the drill
[37:29.440 --> 37:36.480]  and the drill was gonna be Alex Jones the terrorist is an arsonist I mean
[37:36.480 --> 37:44.720]  that's who runs this government you've got to experience this for yourself just
[37:44.720 --> 37:49.520]  randomly walking down the street by the airport where they were doing the
[37:49.520 --> 37:53.800]  landing drill hundreds and hundreds of yards away from the woods now the other
[37:53.800 --> 37:58.920]  side of the woods was the airport fence and the army had gone door-to-door saying
[37:58.920 --> 38:04.480]  don't talk to Alex Jones that's what America is
[38:10.720 --> 38:14.720]  I mean ladies and gentlemen if the globalist will kill hundreds of
[38:14.720 --> 38:20.360]  thousands of third world people just to get their oil and gold what do you think
[38:20.360 --> 38:25.280]  they're going to do to us they could care less about us sure the low-level
[38:25.280 --> 38:31.040]  grunts and people mean well and are not bad on average but they're picking through
[38:31.040 --> 38:36.320]  them and finding the guys that like to be oppressive that like to be pushy that
[38:36.320 --> 38:54.600]  like to do oppressive things and they recruit and promote them into positions
[38:54.600 --> 39:00.640]  of power they find the bullies they find the control freaks and they promote them
[39:00.640 --> 39:05.320]  into positions of power and what happens a lot of time is basically stream of
[39:05.320 --> 39:09.680]  consciousness on this radio show the stream of memory that's why I'll start
[39:09.680 --> 39:13.200]  covering one article and then jump off into ten other topics is because it
[39:13.200 --> 39:17.080]  brings up memories of things I was bringing up memories of the telecommunications
[39:17.080 --> 39:25.200]  act of 96 and and covering it at nauseam because it was shocking for me it was
[39:25.200 --> 39:31.920]  extremely shocking for me to realize that there was no fourth amendment that
[39:31.920 --> 39:37.680]  a total control grid was being put in through all telecommunications to use
[39:37.680 --> 39:42.960]  the new smart devices and systems that were coming out and cell phones to
[39:42.960 --> 39:47.320]  control and track what everyone does and now our cell phones are our little
[39:47.320 --> 39:53.120]  personal computers that interface with our home computers and basically it's
[39:53.120 --> 39:59.040]  like a guardian devil not a guardian angel or like a confessor priest but a
[39:59.040 --> 40:06.360]  confessor devil that basically sits on our shoulder and watches everything we
[40:06.360 --> 40:12.120]  do and can also add fake data and also cherry pick the information and then use
[40:12.120 --> 40:23.720]  it against us I mean do you really believe that in federal cases 98% of
[40:23.720 --> 40:28.840]  people are being convicted because 98% are guilty no they're framing people the
[40:28.840 --> 40:33.120]  court system especially the federal level is a giant sausage-making machine
[40:33.120 --> 40:38.760]  that they feed people into that rubber stamp and have kept specially picked
[40:38.760 --> 40:44.640]  juries that stay in a pool who will convict and send a daisy to the gas
[40:44.640 --> 40:50.480]  chamber they would send a squirrel to the gas chamber if they were told to send
[40:50.480 --> 40:59.440]  them there they would send a rock to the electric chair this is how they operate
[40:59.440 --> 41:04.040]  this is what the globalist engage in all right all right we're gonna see if I
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.280]  can do it I never can let's just see if I can just read these headlines to you
[41:07.280 --> 41:12.200]  and then start getting into it your iPhone is tracking your location history
[41:12.200 --> 41:25.040]  only tip of the iceberg that's out of CNN is CNBC hidden tracking files found
[41:25.040 --> 41:31.400]  in iPhone iPad how about every smartphone that's made globally because
[41:31.400 --> 41:35.120]  this is continuity of agenda worldwide government's worldwide past
[41:35.120 --> 41:41.360]  simultaneous laws in 96 97 just like simultaneously they all in 1973 started
[41:41.360 --> 41:50.160]  taking blood at Burt's be put in a bio metric slash biological weapons study
[41:50.160 --> 41:55.840]  system via the Pentagon in the UN video homeland security block helicopters and
[41:55.840 --> 42:01.200]  drill over downtown Miami the Miami Herald and others are reporting on it
[42:01.200 --> 42:05.080]  there's video of it later if we have time in the third hour I want to show
[42:05.080 --> 42:11.800]  that video heads up to crew also government orders expedited printing of
[42:11.800 --> 42:16.320]  detainee handbook hurt Nemo got that story out yesterday girls ages 11 and 12
[42:16.320 --> 42:24.800]  could be charged with cyber stocking and here's London Guardian iPhone keeps a
[42:24.800 --> 42:28.120]  record of everywhere you go and then of course gives it to the government but
[42:28.120 --> 42:33.560]  that's only the beginning there's a new report out and of course it's come out
[42:33.560 --> 42:39.520]  that homeland security and the Pentagon who runs cybersecurity network systems
[42:39.520 --> 42:44.560]  the cyber security act it's already in place though they haven't passed it it
[42:44.560 --> 42:48.840]  turns out that they're fair mongering and lying I heard it all over the news
[42:48.840 --> 42:54.360]  this morning and Reddit saw it all over the news they're saying that the
[42:54.360 --> 42:59.760]  terrorist are attacking our nuclear power plants ladies and gentlemen nuclear
[42:59.760 --> 43:04.560]  power plants are not hooked up to the internet their computer systems are not
[43:04.560 --> 43:08.340]  hooked up under infrastructure laws that have been in place for decades
[43:08.340 --> 43:13.840]  Europe's aren't hooked in the coal powered plants are not hooked into the
[43:13.840 --> 43:20.240]  internet they're on their own private networks and that's a fact now some of
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.840]  the road signs are hooked into government networks and can be hacked but
[43:24.840 --> 43:29.080]  it's it's it's all about taking the web over US National Lab needs more
[43:29.080 --> 43:36.920]  cyber controls AP another report sharp rise in cyber attacks on grids is
[43:36.920 --> 43:42.920]  reported excellent story by Paul Joseph Watson I want to get more into later
[43:42.920 --> 43:49.160]  nanny state gone wild breaking down a large swath of the spectrum of total
[43:49.160 --> 43:57.240]  domestication going on we're gonna be breaking that down another key article
[43:57.240 --> 44:01.440]  that I worked on last night with curtain MO and this morning excellent article
[44:01.440 --> 44:08.000]  by curtain MO and Alex Jones DHS launches new alert system designed to
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.320]  terrorize the public this is an article that everybody needs to read I mean
[44:13.320 --> 44:16.960]  anybody out there buying into the fake terror anybody buying into the fake
[44:16.960 --> 44:20.960]  al-Qaeda anybody that doesn't understand the old alert system or the new one
[44:20.960 --> 44:26.120]  it's all admitted they're so arrogant the former head of Homeland Security wrote
[44:26.120 --> 44:31.200]  a book bragging it was used to terrorize people for political purposes but
[44:31.200 --> 44:35.960]  this is totally confirmed in the new system is very diabolical I will get
[44:35.960 --> 44:41.440]  into this fact that's one of the most important things to get to today then
[44:41.440 --> 44:44.840]  the CNN whitewash of it new terrorism alert system will offer specific
[44:44.840 --> 44:49.240]  warnings he's going to be tailored to locals to create even more fear
[44:49.240 --> 44:52.720]  mongering because folks think it's their special terror alert they're getting the
[44:52.720 --> 44:59.400]  government's announcing Facebook Twitter they're gonna be breaking in over it
[44:59.400 --> 45:04.200]  fear mongering sending you individual messages knowing that all the gossips
[45:04.200 --> 45:07.880]  then who understand the national announcements are fear mongering will
[45:07.880 --> 45:12.120]  run around feeling special when your donut shop or your parking garage or
[45:12.120 --> 45:17.200]  your school gets the little special tailored you know generated auto response
[45:17.200 --> 45:23.200]  a specific warning of terrorist and this is all about just setting up the
[45:23.200 --> 45:27.640]  Stasi system where we don't trust our fellow neighbors we only trust big brother
[45:27.640 --> 45:31.000]  they've got the big big brother TV shows coming out with John the Jan
[45:31.000 --> 45:37.840]  Napolitano as our savior a continuing new terrorism alert system will offer
[45:37.840 --> 45:46.280]  specific warnings Pakistan at impasse with us on drone attacks after meetings
[45:46.280 --> 45:55.000]  with Mullen they've been telling them for months to stop the bombings over
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.840]  thousand drones bombing all over Pakistan and the globals are saying
[45:59.840 --> 46:04.640]  we're not gonna stop I mean that's the Empire you know the God Zeus flies
[46:04.640 --> 46:08.200]  above you and throws Thunderbolt sets you and they admit we killed no-name
[46:08.200 --> 46:12.800]  terrorists if we see someone with a gun we kill them when guns are you as
[46:12.800 --> 46:20.280]  ubiquitous in Pakistan as they were in Texas in the 1920s that's what happens
[46:20.280 --> 46:23.000]  in Afghanistan they see you driving along in your Jeep with a gun in the
[46:23.000 --> 46:28.680]  rack like Farmer Jones used to do the troops just gun you down and mark you
[46:28.680 --> 46:33.960]  down as Al Qaeda killed just like we've talked to Dr. Bob Bowman who flew
[46:33.960 --> 46:38.040]  combat missions over Vietnam over a hundred and he talked about how a lot
[46:38.040 --> 46:40.920]  people he knew would just say you know they'd be flying along he'd been in
[46:40.920 --> 46:46.080]  areas controlled by the good guys and they would just see a boat driving along
[46:46.080 --> 46:49.960]  with the family fishing and they just kill them
[46:54.040 --> 46:58.760]  and there was the headlines the US is defined in fact that was a powerful
[46:58.760 --> 47:04.360]  headline US still has options for drones have denied use of Pakistan bases
[47:04.360 --> 47:10.600]  Pakistan has said stop doing it for months stop stop stop your order to stop
[47:10.600 --> 47:18.240]  and now they're talking about kicking the drones out of Pakistani bases and the
[47:18.240 --> 47:24.480]  West is saying we don't care we're gonna go ahead and keep bombing you and then
[47:24.480 --> 47:29.160]  by the way this isn't an act of war these are humanitarian bombs kinetic
[47:29.160 --> 47:41.320]  bombs also I've got a report here that I'm gonna play a clip of a head of
[47:41.320 --> 47:44.520]  Gerald Salente joining us or I may just play a short clip out of the eight
[47:44.520 --> 47:49.240]  minute clip from real clear markets it's up on info wars.com
[47:49.240 --> 47:54.240]  Gennrich Ben Bernanke has done a terrible job and Gennrich went on to say
[47:54.240 --> 47:59.360]  that because I heard him on Hannity yesterday driving around doing some errands
[47:59.360 --> 48:05.360]  not just this video but I heard him say we to split the Federal Reserve in two
[48:05.360 --> 48:10.160]  and give the money power back to Congress now if Gennrich who's written
[48:10.160 --> 48:17.880]  books about how he supports world government carbon taxes if Gennrich is
[48:17.880 --> 48:22.760]  going on CNBC saying things like this and going on Hannity that shows that they
[48:22.760 --> 48:27.520]  know with polls over 85% of Americans want to audit or abolish the Fed that
[48:27.520 --> 48:33.600]  the jig is up so they're really starting to panic and they said let the Fed
[48:33.600 --> 48:38.800]  control dollar value that that means hand that over to the global new bank of
[48:38.800 --> 48:46.040]  the world but let Congress control it domestically so really it's sounding
[48:46.040 --> 48:51.720]  like he's saying get rid of the Fed he's spinning it to say well let them handle
[48:51.720 --> 48:56.360]  dollar value which is the dollar and then let Congress again rearrange the
[48:56.360 --> 49:03.240]  deck chairs on the Titanic so I've got those reports here looking at Libya
[49:03.240 --> 49:10.120]  warning of new Vietnam in Libya as British military advisors go in I've
[49:10.120 --> 49:13.640]  been seeing for over a month these headlines about military advisors
[49:13.640 --> 49:19.280]  going in they've been bringing weapons in out of Saudi Arabia they've been
[49:19.280 --> 49:26.240]  bringing advisors in they've had US and British troops lazing the targets on the
[49:26.240 --> 49:31.000]  ground so the bombs can be dropped on them targeting them vectoring them and
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.680]  and now they're just going oh now we've put troops in now we've got troops ships
[49:35.680 --> 49:41.680]  off the coast now the EU is going to send in a humanitarian force who will
[49:41.680 --> 49:46.760]  lead the rebels into the Qaddafi controlled cities and if Qaddafi doesn't
[49:46.760 --> 49:55.840]  lay his guns down well then we'll have to have a bigger ground war here's the EU
[49:55.840 --> 49:59.240]  here's NATO we're rolling in behind the rebels with weapons we gave them if you
[49:59.240 --> 50:03.160]  fire on the rebels you're firing on us you're not allowed to fire at us when
[50:03.160 --> 50:11.440]  we're firing at you this is peace this is help teams help teams warning of new
[50:11.440 --> 50:16.880]  Vietnam and Libya as British military advisors go in but the Prime Minister
[50:16.880 --> 50:21.240]  said don't worry this is not a military action it's not military it's not
[50:21.240 --> 50:26.720]  military it's military but it's not okay and the radiation levels now over 500
[50:26.720 --> 50:30.800]  times normal levels in many states according to the state readings that
[50:30.800 --> 50:33.760]  are being released that we have up on prisonplanet.com don't worry the
[50:33.760 --> 50:36.960]  government just raises what they said safe levels are so this is not a war in
[50:36.960 --> 50:40.120]  Libya and radiation levels going up are not dangerous because the government
[50:40.120 --> 50:43.400]  raised the level here's the New York Times war in Libya could drag on
[50:43.400 --> 50:50.640]  military analysts say New York Times but UK's Cameron says NATO not creeping
[50:50.640 --> 50:55.040]  towards ground war no no no no and the air bombardment it's not an air bombardment
[50:55.040 --> 50:59.080]  either it's a no-fly zone stay with us
[50:59.680 --> 51:04.520]  hello friends this is Alex Jones the earthquake tsunami and nuclear disaster
[51:04.520 --> 51:08.240]  that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing compared to the
[51:08.240 --> 51:11.840]  devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will soon hit the
[51:11.840 --> 51:15.980]  United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless all
[51:15.980 --> 51:20.160]  caused by the devalued US dollar while the mainstream media continues to ignore

[54:05.520 --> 54:10.720]  every morning at the mine you can see him arrive he stood six foot six and
[54:10.720 --> 54:16.160]  waiting 245 kind of broad at the shoulder and there at the hip and everybody knew you
[54:16.160 --> 54:26.000]  didn't give no left a big job big job big job the Constitution the Mill of
[54:26.000 --> 54:35.680]  Rights is a hedge of protection and when due process is removed from the
[54:35.680 --> 54:42.400]  equation it allows corruption to take root and then to grow until there is no
[54:42.400 --> 54:47.840]  liberty and no prosperity left and so it is my mission to simply try to
[54:47.840 --> 54:54.920]  illustrate how deceptive how corrupt and how ruthless the global ruling class
[54:54.920 --> 55:00.520]  is look at all the lies they've been caught in look at all the corruption to
[55:00.520 --> 55:04.560]  the point of where many people just accept that that's what government and
[55:04.560 --> 55:10.280]  mega corporations do but then I hear the very same servile public praising the
[55:10.280 --> 55:14.880]  police when they throw the book at somebody for some petty reason or even
[55:14.880 --> 55:19.240]  frame them and it's because deep down people are scared and they're
[55:19.240 --> 55:23.200]  intimidated by the bullies and they think that if they go along with it and
[55:23.200 --> 55:28.800]  make excuses for it that somehow they're gonna be immune and protected and that
[55:28.800 --> 55:33.360]  type of attitude allows more and more corrupt bureaucrats to get in more and
[55:33.360 --> 55:37.880]  more corrupt police more and more corrupt military to displace the good men
[55:37.880 --> 55:44.520]  women that are standing up for what's right we need to illustrate what a good
[55:44.520 --> 55:48.040]  police officer is what a good military person is what a good member of
[55:48.040 --> 55:56.160]  Congress is what true American and and and just free human values are I mean I
[55:56.160 --> 56:01.640]  look at this new DHS terror alert system and it's really the old infraguard system
[56:01.640 --> 56:07.400]  going nationwide and widespread and I'm gonna be breaking that down DHS
[56:07.400 --> 56:12.880]  launches new alert system designed to terrorize public we did a search term
[56:12.880 --> 56:15.600]  yesterday but only made it to like number five because I only plugged it
[56:15.600 --> 56:20.520]  briefly I've done the search term and tested it if you make this the number
[56:20.520 --> 56:25.560]  one search term it will lead them directly to info wars calm and prison
[56:25.560 --> 56:29.600]  planet calm and this article by Kurt Nemo that is the most detailed I've
[56:29.600 --> 56:33.720]  seen yet proving the fake terror and that these terror alerts are meant to
[56:33.720 --> 56:37.200]  create a climate of fear so they can bring in an even greater police state
[56:37.200 --> 56:45.000]  I want to everybody to search the term terrorize public very easy terrorize
[56:45.000 --> 56:51.120]  public terrorize public and you can clone the article to your website then
[56:51.120 --> 56:55.600]  you'll get the traffic when it goes to number one let's make it number one now
[56:55.600 --> 57:01.520]  we know they're blocking TSA terms let's see if they're blocking terror terms
[57:01.520 --> 57:11.200]  terrorize public T-e-r-r-o-r-i-z-e terrorize public and I'm gonna be reading
[57:11.200 --> 57:14.760]  much of this article later in the broadcast but I'm really proud of this
[57:14.760 --> 57:19.360]  article that Kurt Nemo did it it's just got amazing amounts of research in it
[57:19.360 --> 57:23.240]  is so important to understand why they're doing what they're doing Paul
[57:23.240 --> 57:28.560]  Watson's article explaining what the nanny state system is all about I asked
[57:28.560 --> 57:33.520]  Paul to write this article last night worked on it with him some as Kurt we
[57:33.520 --> 57:37.120]  had a meeting last night for about 45 minutes we went over this he wrote it
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.480]  this morning these are important articles that you know what's going on but
[57:41.480 --> 57:45.360]  this will help you understand why and every statement we make is linked to

[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.160]  state police not just in Michigan but all over the country we saw these reports
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.680]  years ago they have wireless antennas that hack in because they have the back
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:12.720]  door so it's instant basically two seconds on average and download what's on
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:16.680]  your phone or when they pull you over for speeding they demand your phone
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:21.960]  color of law no right plug it in to the warrantless search and steal everything
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:28.080]  off your phone I do want to spend a few minutes later in the in the hour getting
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.240]  into your iPhone is tracking your location and they've got these top
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:40.680]  computer experts saying YouTube excuse me Apple won't tell us why you know
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.640]  they're they're saving this but it appears the program triangulates with
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:51.280]  cell towers and tracks them and then when you log on to your iTunes it downloads
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.000]  the information it's all the telecommunications act I mean when you
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.640]  see how ignorant even compartmentalized computer experts are sure they know the
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:05.600]  code they know how they could they know how to identify it it's public it's been
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:12.360]  public for 15 years it's the telecommunications act remember you've
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.680]  been listening 10 15 years I kept telling you over and over if you're
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:24.280]  listening five years ago every AT&T every other major telecommunications hub is
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:30.400]  the NSA they have whole floors not closets they have whole floors where
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:35.200]  everything is run through it and then the AT&T exec went public in San Francisco
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:39.400]  and blew the whistle that everything runs through it and it's an NSA area of one
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:45.920]  floor it's the telecommunications act see when they had to pass this in the law
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:52.440]  it was all public then once it goes in we don't get the details but it's all
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.520]  right there and I guess I'm already covering this now it's just ladies and
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:00.840]  gentlemen it is so frustrating because this is not hard this information is
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.440]  not hard to understand this information is not hard to figure out this
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:09.600]  information is all there I mean I told people back in October 2001 when they
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.880]  passed the Patriot Act we got a copy of it nobody could get it till the day after
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:17.760]  it passed including members of Congress they got it about an hour before and it
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.320]  said the government will break in your house and not tell you without a warrant
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:25.440]  if you find out you can be put in federal prison if you tell anybody we're
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.800]  going to anybody who commits a misdemeanor we can take your entire bill of
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:34.000]  rights and Constitution you know section 802 any action in dangerous human life
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.120]  it's a violation of any federal or state law there's hundreds of misdemeanors
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:55.680]  and they're counting on you not knowing about this it's all there and so of
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.600]  course years later you have the headlines state of Tennessee use Patriot Act
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:04.520]  thousands of times in non-terror related cases including marijuana and domestic
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:08.280]  disputes and the similar headlines everywhere they lie to you and say it's
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:11.920]  not a war in Libya it's not an air war it's not a ground war there are no
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.680]  trips well there were trips oh we're not going to use the Patriot Act on you
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.920]  hoping you don't go look it up then we get the internal Mayak Homeland Security
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:31.240]  reports and there's no mention of Al Qaeda there's no mention of the globalist
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:35.720]  little stuges it's all gun owners libertarians veterans in the Fed people

[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:30.600]  announcement a few days ago that the outlook is negative for the dollar
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:34.960]  keeping its triple A rating and if you think the US government's in debt now to
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:39.600]  foreign banks and countries via the fiat money system we're now gonna have
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.680]  basically third world interest rates exactly where the private fellow
[01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.160]  reserve has been maneuvering us forever that's why Geithner says you've got to
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:52.260]  increase spending you've got to increase taxes or will default because he's
[01:08:52.260 --> 01:08:56.800]  steaming us right towards the iceberg he wants to basically wreck the ship and
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:03.880]  then loot it and that's basically their plan we have got to get the word out on
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.680]  what's happening because things are obviously getting crazier by the minute
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.360]  remember they said we're not going to default three years ago when they got
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.120]  the banker bailout they said if we didn't give them all this money it would
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.240]  happen and we told you it's only gonna get worse a few years down the road
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:22.080]  they're positioning us for this while they get all the bailout money that they
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.320]  promise to use to get the economy going so they can up interest rates and hoard
[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:31.960]  that money for themselves and you've seen lending decrease not increase while
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:37.440]  they're telling you how great the economy is very very deceptive okay let's
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:42.160]  go ahead and go to your phone calls let's talk to Michael in Texas Michael go
[01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:46.960]  ahead hey Alex Mike and Dallas you probably remember I've talked to you
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.400]  a couple times I'm a telecommunications engineer you probably hear from my
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:57.280]  accent too I'm a Yankee I lived up in New York City most of my life and worked
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.760]  for the you know Verizon big telecommunications company first it was
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:05.600]  New York telephone and I started right after the divestiture my dad had been
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:09.200]  in the business and he told me about this stuff that was going on because he was
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:13.400]  one of the infrastructure planners he said Mike you're not gonna believe what
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:20.080]  these people are doing co-location is where and they hid this under the guys
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.720]  of well now the telecommunications infrastructure needs to be shared
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:29.640]  because all these cables underground and on the poles you have to share let me
[01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:34.480]  let me stop you let me stop you I'm gonna give you the floor we have the
[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:39.840]  confirmed reports now that all the smartphones let me give you the news
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:44.560]  blast here it's not just your iPhone your iPad under the 96 telecommunications
[01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.640]  act the government has to be able to break in remotely and turn it on even
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:53.600]  when it's off and have the phone look like it's off download all your content
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:59.200]  photos you name it your phone list listen to you live time track you and
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:04.080]  they co-co-locate quote all the phone company infrastructure at Nexus points
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:10.640]  paid for with nine billion dollars of taxpayer money from 96 to 2001 to put
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:15.040]  the grid in and now over the grid the government's gonna break in on Facebook
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:19.440]  Twitter your your smartphone your computer with announcements that's all
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:23.520]  being announced and I'm not bragging this was all you know that I knew this
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:27.160]  and said this over a decade ago I've been screaming bloody murder and so here's
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:32.520]  these top computer experts in the Guardian saying it's this consolidation
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:38.520]  DP secret system when you log in with your iPhone or iPad to sync it with your
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.880]  regular computer it uploads it and it basically goes to Apple they say we
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:49.120]  don't know how they're triangulating it but it is it is being triangulated we
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:53.200]  believe it's determined by cell tower triangulation well if they'd read the
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:59.560]  telecommunications act it says by law it triangulates I'm sorry now go ahead no
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:03.800]  no you're right Alex and again I'm calling to confirm that you know again
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.640]  just like you just like you admit every day humbly you say I'm not the smartest
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:11.520]  guy in the world as matter of fact I'm never the smartest guy in the room just
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.120]  because I have the title of engineer doesn't mean that I'm a brainiac I know
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.320]  these things because I've researched them and here's the scary thing Alex they
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.080]  don't even have to you don't even have to make phone calls anymore we sell these
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:30.880]  services I now work for a wireless communication company one of the the
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.640]  fourth largest wireless provider and we sell a service that backs up all your
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:42.800]  contacts wirelessly so you've got your phone set and you say well what happens
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:47.280]  if my phone breaks or if I lose it or someone steals it oh all my contacts will
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.440]  be saved all of my information all my pictures everything that I had and by
[01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:56.160]  the way that's the cloud system and there all the new computers coming out
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:01.840]  you won't be able to save it on your computer at home it's all designed to
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:06.840]  be saved on their systems and under the new internet ID program announced by the
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.640]  White House on Monday actually last Friday now folks we covered this last
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:17.160]  week publicly they admit the government will issue you your universal safe code
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:22.880]  with a code key for your banking for everything and they admit the IRS will
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.560]  monitor it and the Department of Health and Human Services will monitor all
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:32.040]  your medical records I mean they this is all been designed in the Pentagon runs
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:37.160]  it sorry yeah no it's true and of course they broadcast this commercial with this
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:42.280]  lady that makes it sound like like they do every program they label it something
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:47.240]  you know the Patriot Act the Internet Security Act and it's exactly the
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:52.200]  opposite it'll do exactly the opposite of what they name it now I'm sorry I'm
[01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.920]  gonna add the Pentagon admitted two years ago you're absolutely right that
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.400]  cyber security is putting these hubs in so they can shut the web down that's the
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:05.240]  internet kill switch and the way they're unifying the internet telecommunications
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:10.520]  grid will allow hackers i.e. the globalist to shut down all their parts of
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:13.800]  the web so what they claim they're setting up to protect the web it's the
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.760]  opposite sorry and who's the guy pushing it who was the guy from the
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.840]  beginning pushing it one of the so-called liberals from up in Connecticut one of
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:27.160]  our senior senators Joe Lieberman I mean don't don't people see there's no
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:31.640]  difference just like your interview your 80-minute interview that anybody can
[01:14:31.640 --> 01:14:38.360]  download from prisonplanet.com if they get a membership
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:43.720]  G. Edward Griffin says there's no difference between these people there
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:49.120]  they say maybe the Republicans want military spending and the the Democrats
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:54.720]  want social programs the overall agenda is and there's no difference why don't
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.880]  people see this why don't they see it Alex I don't I don't know what to do
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:03.760]  anymore and here's another question maybe you can talk about this with Gerald
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:10.600]  or Bob Chapman tomorrow I'm at the point where even some of these social
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:14.960]  networking websites I can't even go on them anymore because people say who they
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.280]  that they're libertarians and they believe in the Constitution the Bill of
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:25.000]  Rights and and private property they're talking about the boogeyman you know we
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.320]  need to hate them the Muslims we need to hate that this is all about Islam trying
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.280]  to take over the world there's no place to go anymore where you can Islam is the
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.320]  outside boogeyman used so that people will unify under the globalist and let
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.160]  them enslave them meanwhile the globalists are on record radicalizing
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.720]  Muslims protecting violent radical Muslims and allowing them to attack then
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.400]  they use the clash of civilizations to ban free speech in America
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.760]  Detroit is saying that the pastor Jones is not allowed to protest outside the
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:59.880]  Detroit mosque but you can protest you know troops dead troops funerals
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:04.720]  ladies and gentlemen if you don't support the First Amendment for Jones you
[01:16:04.720 --> 01:16:09.520]  don't support it for anybody these are social engineers knowingly maneuvering
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:14.120]  us into this and it's not our opinion on the telecommunications act or on what
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.080]  they're doing socially it's all public they write white papers they've got
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:22.880]  white papers by the CFR of how they're chem trailing and when they started it
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.760]  and what's in it and how great it is and the average yuppie out there will
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:31.400]  laugh at you if you tell them when it's public I appreciate your call Michael
[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:35.440]  look we're in deep trouble because the average person goes into a cell phone
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.520]  store a smartphone store and doesn't even want to learn what the different
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.920]  phones are because they got to go home and watch their favorite sitcom or play
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:49.280]  video games you know there's a real game of life going on with a real
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:55.560]  scientific Borg unrolling their control grid openly saying in thousands of
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:59.160]  white papers covered in endgame blueprint for global enslavement that once
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:02.880]  the grids in place they're going to release basically a mouse pox and kill
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:08.840]  90 plus percent of people the UN only says 80 percent and they just giggle and
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:12.320]  say oh the black helicopter is going to get me I've got a sitcom to watch I mean
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:19.280]  they have no idea the cops laughing right now listening they have no idea what
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:25.080]  we're going into they have no idea how sinister it is how domesticated the
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.640]  public has gotten and you know what maybe the globalist aren't gonna release
[01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:34.960]  these you know these super bio weapons but they sure say they are they sure
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.800]  talk about it a lot they sure talk about what they're gonna do the their big
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:44.720]  think tanks that literally give the orders I mean this is all public Dick
[01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.320]  Cheney September 20th 2000 rebuilding America's defenses PNAC said we need to
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.960]  legitimize through the media the use of race specific bio weapons South Africa
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:57.400]  Israel you know what a race specific bio weapon is folks if you don't you
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:02.240]  better look it up we're doing a Google search term today I want to make it
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:06.680]  number one terrorized public that'll lead people to DHS launches new alert
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:11.400]  system designed to terrorize public all right let's go to Mick in New York Mick
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.680]  you're on the year hey Alex thanks for having me on the line there I was
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.240]  awake in about a year and a half ago by a friend of my wife's and she turned me
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.480]  on to you and it's been absolutely stunning what I've learned it had three
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:30.000]  things and then I'll let you expound upon them first of all I want to know
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.480]  what your thoughts are in the Department of Justice seizing the poker
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:36.840]  sites and what the real agenda is behind that well the only place in the
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:41.880]  country where it's totally legal is district of criminals DC that square
[01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:46.920]  block of criminality and the globalist always take things over that were legal
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:50.960]  so that then their friends can be given the franchises nobody's going after
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:56.560]  Donald Trump's online poker operations and I don't gamble myself and I have
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:00.160]  actually played private games of poker back in college in a few cents then but
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.880]  I mean we're talking for pennies I'm not a high stakes poker player and it's
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.360]  become super popular and it's fun and it's actually a form of you know gambling
[01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:12.560]  with four friends where you've actually got a chance of winning and they don't
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.280]  like that they you know they want to put in rig casinos we got about a 20%
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.840]  chance of winning where they can sell you some government whores and liquor
[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:24.440]  instead of you going with friends and eating barbecue at their house and
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:28.560]  playing you know poker for five hours and they don't want you online playing
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:32.720]  poker with other people because it's fair and it's real and they just can't
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:36.520]  allow that and we got an article up there today poker sites tomorrow
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:40.360]  alternative media the government's actually out there talking about shutting
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:43.520]  down alternative media and using systems to do it does that answer your
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:48.240]  question now Mick yeah and then I also had one thing about being a I'm a I used
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:52.800]  to be a physical education teacher and they're trying to ban dodgeball and
[01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:57.480]  nobody asked the kids that's all the kids want to play well because if they
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:02.120]  can ban something that's reasonable they can ban anything if you suffer from poor

[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:18.440]  the big rating agency for the first time since Pearl Harbor has lowered the
[01:24:18.440 --> 01:24:23.200]  outlook to negative with the US keeping its triple A rating third world
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:27.200]  countries don't have triple A ratings the interest rates will explode that's
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:31.160]  just how they maneuvered Greece and Ireland and Portugal and Iceland of
[01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:33.880]  course the Icelanders said we don't know this money they went to the forensic
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:37.600]  audit over 90% was owed by the private banks that had come in and taken over
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:41.560]  their country you bankers keep your fiat debt go ahead and try to hold this
[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:45.640]  hostage because we know you can go ahead and kill the economy even faster but if
[01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:50.480]  we go along with you there's no end in sight let's just get this over with and
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:54.360]  so we knew that golden silver would only go up I've been telling you for 11
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:57.040]  years that's when I got into golden silver was when they got rid of glass
[01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:01.440]  stigle all the economists that had been right before I listened to them started
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:07.440]  studying it intently really 16 17 years ago but intensely 11 years ago and I
[01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:12.480]  said get into silver and gold when silver was less than $5 an ounce was for
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:20.880]  something gold 250 a 260 gold is it $1,509 and $60 an ounce it's still
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:25.360]  rising that's from earlier in the day gold climbs to record as debt concern
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:32.640]  inflation boost investment demand and silver surges over $46 and 25 cents an
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:39.520]  ounce as rumors of a short squeeze and concerning market gain credence and
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:43.520]  continuing gold for me delivery advances to record Bloomberg Reuters gold
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:54.040]  arrives to $1,700 continuing and look in a week or two they'll probably drive
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.840]  gold down by 50 bucks they'll probably drive silver down by three or four and
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:01.480]  the piece will all say I see because they love to feel like they're right
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:05.760]  because they never buy golden silver so it doesn't matter if in the yearly graph
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.680]  the 10-year graph it's going straight up when it dips a little they'll have
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:12.800]  celebrations on TV and giggle and snicker and then a month later it'll
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:17.000]  race up to you know 1600 bucks and silver to 50 and they'll still giggle and
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:21.520]  then it'll drop from 50 to 49 and they'll laugh then it'll go to 60 and
[01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:26.040]  silver and then it'll drop to 55 and they'll laugh because they love to lose
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:30.640]  I'm telling you it's a religion now America had a religion of winning it's
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:37.840]  now got a religion of buying into cons my listeners are not like that and I'm
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:42.480]  not like that I promote what I believe in there is no silver bullet but the
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:46.720]  closest you get to a silver bullet is a silver coin and no pun intended I
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.120]  personally like gold too because you start buying a lot of silver it's hard
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:54.840]  to carry around with you unless you're like Captain Kidd and got it buried but
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:58.240]  it is great it's poor man's gold and many analysts have called it gold on
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:01.200]  steroids and it is performing better than gold and I've been saying that for
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.920]  years and I said silver's the safest bet but look enough of that because I'm
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:10.440]  coming back with the big whistleblower from Goldman Sachs to get into all this
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.480]  and she was on just a few months ago and again laid out what was she said
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:17.400]  coming sooner rather than later so be talking to her but Ted Anderson just
[01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:23.520]  briefly we got about two minutes left here we are and you told folks you were
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:26.400]  gonna run out of the golden silver that you bought months ago at a lot lower
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:30.440]  price you still got the stuff you bought a month ago instead of two months ago
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:35.120]  it's gonna go up again still the best deals out there how much is the three
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.080]  silver dollars and three of my films and free shipping the best deal out there
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:42.320]  how much of the silver half dollars what's your best deals on gold what are
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:45.920]  the radio specials if folks want to call and take advantage of this or maybe
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.920]  they can just be a yuppie and gaggle and say bad investment gold 260 now 1500
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:56.080]  you're dumb I'm smart stock market overall down by about 40% in real stock
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:01.120]  values I'm smart I'm losing money I'm cool you're not magic wand radiation is
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:05.640]  good for me you know these are smart folks look black helicopters the Miami
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.800]  Herald attacking don't exist haha you know government wiretapping with no
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:14.520]  warrants haha doesn't exist but it's admitted I'm sorry Ted to give folks
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:19.120]  the number in the offer yeah well right now I'm at 120 for the videos and the
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:23.940]  silver dollar the silver dollars alone right now at a hundred and forty seven
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:27.920]  dollars apiece actually they're a little higher than that silver did go up
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:33.800]  today to forty six dollars and thirty nine cents gold 1509 and you really be
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:38.960]  should be moving in on this walking liberty haves right now Alex 2161 those
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:42.520]  are going to be shooting up like a rocket was over going like up like they
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:48.440]  had Frank's at 326 sovereigns at 410 I mean there's just a lot of things that
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:54.240]  are at this time I just can't say it enough I mean 3200 for a bag of dimes
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:59.240]  that's a thousand face value people need to protect themselves are watching
[01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:03.200]  gold and silver go down take advantage of that silver dollar deal in the videos
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:07.480]  at 120 if I price that out in the marketplace right now it be closer to
[01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:12.680]  200 bucks to get the same thing to buy it separately and that is just it's
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:16.280]  important that people get involved right now at this time Alex if you don't move
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:20.680]  into gold and silver there there's about 200 trillion dollars in assets out
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:26.160]  there in the marketplace that needs to be in invested period and if that moves
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:30.440]  to gold and silver there's only in gold is only about one point one and a half
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:36.600]  trillion dollars with it let me give folks the number Ted 800 686 2237 the
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:41.520]  globalist obviously think you're stupid won't buy this golden silver 800 686
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.600]  2237 I know the globalist in the big universities they're all grabbing it
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:48.800]  dictators are grabbing it but they're telling you don't grab it because they
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:55.480]  want it for themselves we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:02.840]  and the GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:30:02.840 --> 01:30:07.280]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:11.320]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:15.200]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:19.240]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:23.800]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:28.440]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.200]  the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:35.640]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:39.600]  onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:49.440]  talked about losing the triple A rating talked about what that would signify the
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:52.960]  policy we're seeing out of Geithner I had Lou Dobbs on Friday he agreed with my
[01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:59.480]  analysis that Geithner's announcement that if you don't raise the debt ceiling
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:04.080]  if you don't give us more taxes and more money to pay to the offshore banks then
[01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:08.760]  we'll default but they're defaulting through hyperinflation over 70% of the
[01:34:08.760 --> 01:34:12.200]  T-bills now being monetized by the Federal Reserve the Chinese announcing
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:16.240]  last week they're gonna buy even less T-bills we're going over the edge here
[01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:20.120]  you see that in commodities but we're gonna talk to a real expert here in a
[01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:28.520]  moment who six years ago seven years ago wrote a best-selling book exposing all
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:32.880]  of this and laying it all out so because she was on the inside of it I mean how
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.380]  many hundreds of top economists that former top federal regulators like
[01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:40.280]  professor black have we had on laying out it's a black hole impossible to pay
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:44.680]  off it's designed to be impossible we're gonna talk to her in a moment and then
[01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:48.120]  Gerald Salente coming up later in the next hour I'll take 30 minutes of calls
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:51.240]  and cover other news at the start of the next hour for those that are holding

[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.920]  to know me friends here in a moment I wanted to bring up Ted Anderson just to
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.640]  finish because we were talking about golden silver prices and what's
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:06.880]  happening and then we got caught by the break before we could put the plug in so
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:11.160]  folks can take advantage of this deal it was a 90 something dollars then it was
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:17.800]  a hundred dollars and 105 110 115 to get three silver dollars now valued in the
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:24.160]  market over $135 if you're getting a good deal to get three you get three of
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:28.400]  those for 120 with the free shipping and three of my best-selling films on top
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:34.240]  of it we're talking a 200 plus dollar value for 120 and as Ted sells out of
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:37.920]  the supplies he bought when it was lower it'll still keep going up you should
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.640]  have taken advantage of it earlier but he should have taken advantage of it we
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:45.960]  were selling silver for five bucks an ounce and gold for 260 but you think
[01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.240]  it's high now get ready because if they continue to devalue the currency which
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.800]  they're showing every indication their full steam ahead it's only going to go
[01:35:53.800 --> 01:35:57.840]  up so take advantage of that special I'll tell you right now the brokers who are
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:01.200]  great guys and competitive they don't like it because Ted loses money on these
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:04.800]  it's a loss leader to get you into silver and gold for those that have never
[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:08.440]  held it in their hand he's got a bunch of other loss leaders as well briefly
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:12.000]  mentioned those Ted the radio specials that folks need to share the radio
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.080]  specials or they will pay more well there's no question about it the very
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:20.280]  first one is your so your videos with the three silver dollars and 120 there's
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:25.000]  an anybody in the entire world that is offering a deal that good and silver we
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:30.280]  also have the creature from Jekyll Island book for $41 delivered that's a
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:36.000]  580 some page book with a real silver dollar in it so you get to read about
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.720]  what the Fed is about and then you get to see what real constitutional money
[01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:42.720]  really was as a sample right in your hand
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:46.960]  forty one dollars delivered silver dollars alone or forty seven dollars a
[01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:51.880]  piece you can do the math I'm not making money on this but nonetheless it gets you
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:56.040]  educated you get the real deal and who knows maybe someday in the future you'll
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:02.000]  consider Midas for your future purchases absolutely has absolutely I'm sorry go
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.080]  ahead and finish up well just the walking Liberty haves at 2161 are a good
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:09.800]  buy there's so many good buys right now in the marketplace and it's so hard to
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:12.880]  keep up with this because Alex every day I wake up
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:16.840]  silvers up another dollar from a was the day before I mean right now we're
[01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:21.760]  looking at forty six dollars and thirty nine cents for silver gold is almost at
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.120]  fifteen dollar fifteen hundred and ten dollars now I mean it's just the this
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:30.720]  stuff is moving so fast and so furious and premiums are going up on physical
[01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:35.320]  delivery anything even in the futures market that you know I mean let's face
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:39.760]  it if you have two hundred trillion dollars trying to chase one point one
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:44.600]  and a half trillion of assets it's going to drive the prices up absolutely
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:47.520]  dead I've got a jump to know me because she's gonna break down the
[01:37:47.520 --> 01:37:51.800]  technicals of this but thank you so much eight hundred six eight six two to

[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.640]  she also appears in the New York Times fortune the list goes on and on know me
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:25.160]  thank you for coming on with us I know I'm ranting here today when I saw the
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:32.360]  s&p announcement three days ago it shook me I knew it was coming but to see
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:36.200]  that happen and then to see the White House come out and say that it didn't
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:40.520]  matter and then we learned that they secretly were trying to block s&p
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:45.440]  staring in pores from doing that as you know somebody who studied this who
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.320]  worked as a managing director at Goldman Sachs running their international
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:53.920]  analytics group and Bear Stearns in London what does this really signify and
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:58.560]  what does this really mean well first of all it signifies that s&p is having a
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:04.280]  minor little wake-up moment because hey they're right you know the United States
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:08.360]  does have a debt problem you know hello this is this is a really obvious
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:11.800]  conclusion the fact that the White House was trying to suppress the
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:17.560]  information is really part of what what continues to occur from Washington
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:23.320]  there's this notion that bailouts worked our financials are in our coming back
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:27.360]  our recovery is on the rise and all of this stuff that no one actually feels
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:32.760]  in real life but the illusion continues to get perpetuated so trying to get s&p
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:37.520]  to shut up was a way of trying to continue with that illusion s&p of
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:42.640]  course is the same rating agency among Moody's and Fitch that continually
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:47.520]  upgraded and kept high the ratings of all the toxic assets that clogged our
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:51.840]  financial system that were spewed out by the banking system and that continued
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:56.120]  to reside at the Federal Reserve and be backed in many other ways by the
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:00.840]  Treasury Department not least be issuing a four trillion dollars worth of
[01:41:00.840 --> 01:41:06.080]  Treasury debt in the last two years since that financial crisis began so this
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:11.320]  is something that Washington would really prefer we don't keep picking at and
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:17.000]  that s&p would have just stayed dormant and not mentioned in the way that they
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:20.840]  did and their announcement that they did on Monday with their report
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:27.560]  now know me what does this signify when Geithner engages in when I call financial
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:31.720]  terrorism and says if you don't raise the debt limit if you don't keep the
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:35.920]  spending going we're going to default and am I not correct or correct me if I'm
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:39.840]  wrong in saying that it's a technical default to have the Federal Reserve
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:46.160]  monetizing seven tenths of the new debt and to have the Chinese and others
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:53.240]  dumping new purchases cutting back on their purchases I mean are we not seeing
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:59.000]  a real-world default going on right now and to have him skate scapegoat
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:05.280]  anybody trying to cut spending as the authors of the ongoing depression what's
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:11.800]  your view on that well you call it by the banks and Geithner sort of the
[01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:16.640]  accomplice because he under him the Treasury Department again increase the
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.840]  Treasury debt by four trillion dollars so for him to come around and say oh by
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:25.080]  the way if you Congress don't increase the debt tax by whatever amount whether
[01:42:25.080 --> 01:42:30.000]  it's a penny to a trillion it almost doesn't matter the idea is that if we
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:34.600]  don't incur more debt our debt will become less worthy which is which is
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:39.960]  just a not logical and be part of how Geithner has operated through the bail
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:43.800]  out and since he's been Treasury Secretary which is to continue to deny
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:50.280]  that much of the debt problem most of the debt problem arguably all of the debt
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:56.760]  problem has happened because of this imparting of debt to bail out Wall Street
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:43:00.760]  to subsidize the financial system to go back and forth between the Fed who buys
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:04.720]  the debt the Treasury increases the debt the Fed buys the debt it has a sort of
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.440]  back-and-forth ball going between them which only decreases our value as the
[01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:15.000]  nation our entire sure you know books our balance sheet as a nation and the Fed
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.400]  will continue to do this we know that when June comes along the Fed is going
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:22.800]  to go from QE to the QE whatever they might call it something else they will
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:28.000]  find ways to continue to throw this ball yeah I've heard Bernackie they're
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:34.040]  calling it a continuation of QE to which is really QE 3 right and what it
[01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:37.360]  really is this thing like we're going to continue to pretend that we're either
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.600]  going to print money or buy debt or move stuff back and forth between the
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:44.200]  Treasury Department of Federal Reserve which will decrease the value of the
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:48.120]  United States books as a whole will just keep on doing that whatever we call
[01:43:48.120 --> 01:43:52.960]  that and and we will never say that the reason we are doing that is because we
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:57.720]  are backing a policy financial system for which we we started to do this to
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:02.640]  begin with and that in our history as a country we have never had this amount of
[01:44:02.640 --> 01:44:07.200]  outpouring an increase in our debt and flux between the Treasury Department of
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:10.800]  Federal Reserve as we've had in the last two and a half nothing near it
[01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:14.880]  blame spending cut and then blame or even discuss or even a role they give
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:19.800]  credence to the crazy debate that continues on in Washington about 38
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:23.080]  billion dollars per year of spending cuts which is one percent of the budget
[01:44:23.080 --> 01:44:28.920]  and and and less than a visible percentage piece of a percentage of the
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:32.160]  debt that the Treasury Department has incurred in the Federal Reserve report
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:37.040]  the port well that's right because there's all of the commitments there's all
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:42.080]  of the thousands of trillions many economists say in derivatives that
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:47.480]  they've tricked us and other nations to sign on to but no me I mean you work
[01:44:47.480 --> 01:44:53.000]  inside the belly of the beast and when we look at this S&P is saying you know
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.360]  hey the emperor has no clothes it's the fact that we're incurring more debt it's
[01:44:57.360 --> 01:45:01.640]  the fact that you're monetizing debt is why the outlook for the triple-a rating
[01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:07.720]  is not good a explain to people what losing the triple-a rating will mean
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:15.360]  and then be is this not the policy of the private offshore owned Fed to wreck
[01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:20.640]  the US dollar and economy so that these big international institutions can
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:25.120]  come in and buy things up for pennies on the dollar and move towards this IMF
[01:45:25.120 --> 01:45:29.520]  World Bank ban core digital system where we'll still have our regional
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:34.400]  currencies but now the private bankers will be in full control outside of
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:40.240]  Congress even being able to comment well yeah I mean I'll start with the middle
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:44.560]  and that the Fed whether it's the will school policy or or strategic policy you
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:49.680]  know I go back and forth between that that the result of this policy is a
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:53.960]  devalued currency is devalued debt now when S&P comes and says there's a
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:57.760]  potential and they said that the United States debt is on negative watch they
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:01.960]  didn't even come out full force and say we are downgrading the US debt
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:06.520]  probably because of conversations going out the White House even though they
[01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:10.600]  they put out their report there could have been a little bit of back and
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:15.720]  forthing on that but what would happen if the United States debt rating was
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:19.720]  decreased it would mean that the value of our of our treasure debt the amount
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:24.840]  that we would have to basically pay other countries to borrow money from
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:28.520]  them or effectively you know they buy our treasuries but it what the
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:32.760]  transaction is we are buying we're paying them interest they are they are
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:38.280]  buying our debt it would cost us more to do that and if it costs us more to do
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:44.080]  that number one inflation goes up the cost of keeping this illusion going goes
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:48.760]  up so there then the feds in a position where they have to you know that they
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:52.840]  can't bring rates down below zero they're already quite low to the private
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:56.520]  banking system the private banking system is getting money from the Fed of
[01:46:56.520 --> 01:47:01.440]  basically zero interest and then either using it offshore to speculate and
[01:47:01.440 --> 01:47:05.320]  increase profits and not have those taxes reverted back to increasing revenues
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:11.240]  in Washington or lending them out to to whether it's small businesses or through
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:14.920]  credit cards or through auto loans or whatever at high interest rates
[01:47:14.920 --> 01:47:18.760]  relative to the almost zero that they're paying for it so that I believe would
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:22.840]  continue which would just mean that the United States continues a downward
[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:27.920]  devaluation spiral I don't know if the S&P is going to turn around and actually
[01:47:27.920 --> 01:47:34.440]  downgrade the US debt it should the value of our debt like the S&P report had
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:40.600]  indicated should be downgraded we continue to create money to pay debt
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:45.360]  with none of this is real revenue the real revenue the real profits that
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:50.440]  private banks and other companies like GE are making are not reverting in taxes
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:55.480]  back to the Treasury Department we as individuals pay 81% between individual
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:01.560]  tax returns and Social Security and other types of payments into the revenue of
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:08.800]  the United States corporations pay 8.9% less than 10% so that will continue to
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:13.440]  happen money will continue to divert offshore whether the IMF turns around and
[01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:19.440]  creates a multi-platform electronic currency or there's there's continued
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:23.360]  talk all the time of some sort of a global currency that's not the dollar
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:28.320]  you know that that's going to be a little bit further in the future because the
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:33.920]  dollar as weak as it is and our debt as invaluable as it is and the economic
[01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:37.320]  policies the Fed and the Treasury Department is dangerous as they are to
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:43.000]  middle and general America the dollar is still the prevalent currency which
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:49.920]  actually devalues the economy globally that's right we're seeing G20 engaged
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:55.320]  in coordinated devaluations of every major currency accelerating the overall
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:59.400]  increase in commodity prices and they're all enabled and this is this is all to
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:08.600]  enable a really bad and dangerous economic policy by the Federal Reserve
[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:12.760]  and the Treasury Department and meanwhile Obama and the Republicans as well
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:16.880]  are telling us everything's fine and the Republicans are scapegoating unions and
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:21.720]  welfare moms I've said you could send them all over the plank you could send
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:25.560]  them to Pluto and I've looked at the math I've had other economists on it'll
[01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:30.120]  do nothing compared to the banker bailouts and the Republicans except for
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:34.240]  Ron Paul and Rand Paul they're not saying a word about the trillion pound
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:37.200]  elephant in the living room I mean it is incredible
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:42.960]  no they're not because they're all part of or most of them are part of this this illusion that what
[01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:47.320]  happened over the last two years was necessary that that's floating the
[01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:52.360]  banking system that that completely changing or adapting in an economic
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:56.880]  policy based on debt and buying our own debt and really just eating our own
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:03.400]  future in that manner is somehow going to create a recovery and that if you
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:10.760]  scapegoat the unions or individuals or or or whomever that that pay 81% of what
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:15.120]  the revenues that go into the Treasury Department are when the corporations are
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:19.880]  paying less than 10% you can't ever you can be you can be debating the budget
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:24.760]  forever you're never going to get to an equal or a balance from this point
[01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:28.800]  because we're so far in the hole because of the debt that was created we have to
[01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:33.520]  pay $430 billion a year just on the current debt and if the value of our
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:37.640]  debt if S&P say does ultimately downgrade the United States goes up that
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:42.480]  number increases and that's just starting day one in the phone for $30
[01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:46.560]  billion and we got a break powerful info and here's the issue we're having this
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:51.120]  gradual slide into third world them but if a Moody's or an S&P does downgrade
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:55.040]  the debt we could see a stock market crash that day we'll talk about that
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:51:03.040]  when we come back stay with us hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the

[01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:09.560]  radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for
[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:14.080]  your mind know me Prince is our guest we're gonna keep her a little bit into
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:20.100]  the next hour but I want to calmly point something out here the Republican
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:24.120]  leadership says there's nothing wrong with profit in America you're a
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:28.440]  communist if you're against the megabanks it's the six big megabanks
[01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:33.400]  that communalize our wealth and then transfer it to themselves they make loss
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:39.400]  public and their profits private and here's GE Wall Street Journal today
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:45.760]  their profit jumped 77% and they paid zero corporate taxes because they're
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:51.300]  mainly offshore they get waivers from their new coal power plants while
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:55.120]  shutting down their competition they head up the president's economic board
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:59.840]  the former CEO just like if you're a campaign contributor you don't have to
[01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:05.680]  buy the insurance so that's going on I want to play a Newt Gennrich clip here
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:09.680]  from CNBC where he says fire Bernanke so it shows the systems looking for
[01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:13.400]  scapegoats he's just a front man like shark teeth new ones will roll forward
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:16.400]  but know me I mean being a former managing director at Goldman Sachs
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:20.640]  again you're uniquely a position to understand this and you predicted it
[01:55:20.640 --> 01:55:25.520]  almost seven years ago with precision because I've read your book years ago
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:31.580]  and understanding this we're seeing this slow slide into inflation and into job
[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:38.200]  loss and stagnation but if a credit agency comes out a month from now two
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:42.080]  years from now one of the big three and does ever get rid of our triple A rating
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:47.000]  it might not take another year after that for full implosion because couldn't
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.880]  that signify the start of a panic we already saw one a little bit earlier in
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:58.200]  the week and then cause a rush to the exits globally out of the dollar even
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:04.560]  though it's stacked up like toxic waste it can do a rush that way and also what
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:09.520]  will happen is there's going to be a moment where the Fed is going to have
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:13.360]  to really you know sort of come to the realization that the policy of propping
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:18.000]  something up actually has been negative which which we all know which S&P is
[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:22.160]  trying to point out that if you can take create and buy debt in a circular
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:28.360]  fashion ultimately that's not a stable economic policy so if rates go up if
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:33.440]  if the ratings come down and therefore the cost of our money goes up the cost
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:38.440]  of our debt goes up it's going to first of all it's going to deeply piss off the
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:42.840]  banks and and so what you're going to see initially is is a large stock market
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:47.200]  loss in bank value and corporate value because all of these companies GG included
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:51.520]  and I mentioned GG also got a hundred forty billion dollars of guarantee for
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:56.160]  debt they created through G capital their financial unit during the bailout I
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:58.680]  mean it's not just that they're not paying taxes and getting four billion
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:02.040]  dollar refunds and making all these profits offshore they were getting bail
[01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:07.360]  out money when things were bad what's happened is GE and the six major banks
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:12.320]  and all the corporations that continue to shun taxes and make profit is they're
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:18.520]  doing so on very cheap money and so they can they can position themselves and
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:23.400]  report to analysts and report to stock investors that they're doing well from
[01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:26.160]  that particular standpoint that's why they get their investors in and that's
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:31.680]  even Gingrich said that he said they get first use of the money and some credit
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:37.240]  card rates are now at seventy nine point nine percent and they write the laws they
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:41.680]  write the loopholes where they can be tax-free offshore and then GE on top of
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:47.120]  all this is the big group along with Soros and others lobbying to raise my
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:50.680]  taxes so they can suck it out of me through the government I mean these
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:56.200]  people are brazen right they want you to subsidize their profits and not not just
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:59.640]  in a limited way not just obviously by buying their product which which is how
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:04.400]  it used to work but but in in basically funding them and funding them through
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:08.200]  your taxes and funding them through the continuation of this program of the
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:12.000]  Treasury Department of Federal Reserve which which has them creating profits off
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.080]  of cheap money and and shirking taxes it's it's you've got the two they're
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:17.680]  shirking taxes they're not giving them through the Treasury Department so the
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:21.480]  Treasury Department is increasing our debt in order to basically make that whole
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:26.720]  and wanting to sort of backdoor increase our taxes because ultimately that's what
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:30.560]  happens when a budget isn't deficit and there's not revenue coming in from the
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:34.160]  people the companies that are making no me no me stay there we got a break back
[01:58:34.160 --> 01:58:38.000]  in one minute incredible I want to talk about the time frame what you believe

[02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:43.080]  us whistleblower know me Prince dot com our websites are info wars dot com she'll
[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:47.640]  be with us about 15 20 minutes into this hour as we got a lot to cover in the
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:52.360]  short segment finishing up the point you were making before the break and then I
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:57.600]  want to pose the question historically studying this how do you see this ending
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:02.160]  because you know the possible endings from my research run from bad to worse
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:07.840]  so we're just hoping for the bad right I mean I think right now what's going on
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:12.560]  and just to follow on from the point we're talking about before is that the
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:17.280]  banking system the major banks the major companies that also have financial
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:24.000]  arms and and and all who have have offshore collective they count on cheap
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:31.000]  money they they count on getting funding from from the Fed on having rates be so
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:35.560]  low because they can in turn either lend it out which is sort of a simple job and
[02:01:35.560 --> 02:01:39.160]  and get a lot back on it or they can speculate with it and go further and
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:42.800]  then not have those profits tax etc or not have those revenues revert to the
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:45.240]  United States so they're basically getting free money from the United States
[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:49.280]  not returning anything for it and that's a really good game you can you can you
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:55.200]  can ride that for a while but what will happen is if the value of our debt is
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:02:00.840]  officially downgraded if there's no way that the Fed could can reduce rates to
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:06.200]  close zero enough to effectively maintain giving cheap money to the banking and
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:12.200]  corporate system it's going to create a colossal pain to them pain that
[02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:16.720]  effectively we have been subsidizing and and pushing forward and away from them
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:22.200]  anyway but what will happen is once they have to pay more once their funding goes
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:27.680]  higher once their profits deteriorate because the cost of the money that they
[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:33.720]  use to inflate them has increased they will be in a position where they won't
[02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:37.280]  look as good where they won't show the kind of high profits that their stock
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:42.480]  investors are used to seeing that's going to create a plummet in the stock
[02:02:42.480 --> 02:02:48.280]  market and that will be very fast and that will be very sharp if our debt is
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:53.800]  actually rated lower now that that's a big if because I do believe that that the
[02:02:53.800 --> 02:02:58.000]  S&P and in the White House can continue to have a back and forth on this for a
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:01.720]  long time the fact that the S&P has only now just mentioned the fact that that's
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:06.960]  the problem is is not comforting the fact that we have a private rating agency
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:11.520]  even doing this is also uncomforting so so there are ways for conversations to
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:16.160]  happen I believe where this whole scenario might be far off but if the
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:20.000]  value goes if the rating goes up if the value goes down if the cost of money the
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.720]  financial system and the corporate system is high that will create lower
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:29.200]  profits really not just you know what we're what we're getting to see after
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:34.040]  the offshore parts are are taken out that's going to create a problem and I
[02:03:34.040 --> 02:03:37.400]  think right now what we're seeing with you know the increase in commodities
[02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:42.160]  increase the silver the increase in gold in oil I think this is where a lot of
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:48.680]  the financial system is is putting a increasing percentage of their money for
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:52.720]  now because they know that in a collapse situation that'll be the only thing of
[02:03:52.720 --> 02:03:58.160]  value which signifies that all the thinkers and the insiders are getting
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:03.640]  the farmland the gold the silver the the you know raw materials the rare earth
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:08.160]  minerals signifying that they understand there's really no way out I mean is
[02:04:08.160 --> 02:04:11.960]  there any way out under the current management or even if we got good people
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:18.240]  in there yeah is this reversible I think it's not reversible on on a dime it
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:23.120]  it's it's slowly reversible if the right policies are taken you know there's a
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:26.600]  trillion dollars a treasury just part you know there's more but a trillion
[02:04:26.600 --> 02:04:30.320]  dollars from just the banking system part at the Fed it's there an excess
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:33.280]  reserve that the banks don't even have to put there but they're putting there
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:35.960]  because they get a little bit of interest in it they're getting the cheap
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:39.600]  money and it's kind of you know safe for them and if for example that's money
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:43.000]  that could be used to reduce the debt because it was money that was given to
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:46.280]  the financial system when it was a problem and now it's just being part
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:50.320]  sure it's another form of inflation stay there exactly you can revert back
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:55.960]  absolutely let's come back and get into Newt Gennrich and the rats leaving the

[02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:08.000]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.240]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:16.520]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:20.880]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:24.960]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:29.520]  now a new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:33.640]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:06:33.640 --> 02:06:37.640]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:38.240]  some of your phone calls in the next segment CNBC $6 gas could happen if
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:43.760]  dollar keeps getting weaker the White House says everything's fine oil above
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:49.000]  112 on signs of strong US crude demand the Saudis striking back after the
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.880]  globalist are trying to overthrow them saying that there's not high demand
[02:08:52.880 --> 02:09:01.160]  which is asinine and cutting production G's profit jumped 77% so did JPMorgan
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:07.160]  Goldman Sachs Wells Fargo all the big insiders GOP escalates debt limit
[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:11.240]  demands but Geithner basically holds them hostage saying with defaults gonna be
[02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:17.200]  your fault that's again the opposite of reality CNS news reporting federal
[02:09:17.200 --> 02:09:22.560]  borrowing on page to hit debt limit in less than a week that's just some of the
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:26.480]  news we have there but form know me friends former managing director
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:31.400]  Goldman Sachs running their international analytics group at the
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:36.600]  Bear Stearns in London I want to pose the question then play the clip and get
[02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:41.600]  your answer but undoubtedly it was a big Brzezinski last year gave a speech at
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:46.320]  the CFR in Canada and said for the first time humanity is awake they're not just
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:50.960]  looking at the puppet front parties worldwide from India to the US they're
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:56.480]  looking at the banking cartel the inner coterie they're angry the elite is in
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:04.360]  trouble they had the hundred year anniversary of the Jekyll Island meeting
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:07.640]  a few months ago and they released a clip of Greenspan admitting there had
[02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:12.440]  been criminal activity in the banking sector we see Gennrich coming out and
[02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:17.120]  saying fire Bernanke take the Federal Reserve's domestic power away only let
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:21.600]  them deal with dollar value globally which is really double-speak so they've
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:27.200]  gone from denying that the Fed ever did anything wrong and Greenspan telling
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:30.120]  Laird News Hour three years ago that they're above the law and Congress has
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:35.400]  no power over them to now blaming each other and pointing fingers and in
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:38.800]  Gennrich a big globalist a one-world government promoter a carbon tax
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:42.920]  promoter a Judas go to control conservatives I also heard him on
[02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:47.280]  Hannity yesterday you know saying that the Federal Reserve has done this to us
[02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:53.520]  this is a major sea change a major sea change because the polls over 80% want
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:58.920]  to audit or abolish these guys because you create one dollar through the Federal
[02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:02.480]  Reserve system a dollar of debt is created at the end of this Ponzi scheme
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:06.840]  it's impossible to pay it all off and it vertically integrates all the wealth to
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:11.280]  the insiders I want to get no me princes insider take on this in a moment
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:16.880]  first here's a minute of Gennrich yesterday on CNBC making the rounds
[02:11:16.880 --> 02:11:21.080]  getting ready to scapegoat and though he's untasteful he's still just a
[02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:28.160]  frontman Ben Bernanke here it is all right let me start with this a bad
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:33.720]  landmark today and you know stuff about this gold hit $1500 an ounce
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:40.640]  another sign of the collapse of the US dollar and yet on the campaign trail yet
[02:11:40.640 --> 02:11:45.000]  I don't hear any Republicans talking about the destruction of the dollar the
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.640]  surge in gold the inflation of food and fuel here on ball what is up with this
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:54.360]  why is the GOP not looking at this key because they're part of it well I can't
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:58.400]  tell you why they're not I think that Bernanke has done a the chairman the
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:03.160]  Federal Reserve has done a terrible job I think he completely misunderstands the
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:07.080]  role of the Federal Reserve the Federal Reserve ought to be keeping the dollar
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:11.960]  sound it ought to be protecting the American dollar and making sure that
[02:12:11.960 --> 02:12:15.840]  it's a store of value people can believe in but for that to happen the
[02:12:15.840 --> 02:12:19.440]  Congress and the president have to do their job which is to have a fiscal
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:24.200]  policy which is responsible which moves back towards a balanced budget and to
[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:28.600]  shape the tax and regulatory environment so that we can be job creating
[02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:34.160]  economic growth and get back to the country that has it's an eight minute
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:37.520]  clip it's up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and again he went
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:43.100]  on Hannity and said fire Bernanke but the point is how about fire the Federal
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:49.120]  Reserve system well he went on and said split it in two but Cutlow was pointing
[02:12:49.120 --> 02:12:54.040]  out that no Republican but Ron Paul or Rand Paul is pointing out the inflation
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:58.880]  tax and and where all this is headed but does this signify the fact that they
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:02.480]  realize they're not invincible and that they're going to be held accountable
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:07.800]  that the finger pointing is starting the finger yeah definitely the finger
[02:13:07.800 --> 02:13:11.200]  pointing is is starting and as you mentioned there's there you know people
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:15.480]  like Ron Paul have been talking about it for years and also the Bernie standards
[02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:19.120]  I mean it's been across aisle a couple people for years that the Fed is out of
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:22.360]  control I would just add though and this isn't being discussed that you know the
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:27.840]  Treasury Department is and what is going on between the Fed to print the money
[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:31.640]  and substantiating money by buying the debt that the Treasury Department is
[02:13:31.640 --> 02:13:35.480]  printing is that it's really a collaborative effort although you know
[02:13:35.480 --> 02:13:40.120]  absolutely because it's always former Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan people who
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:43.800]  were over at the Treasury or the or the New York Fed you know so basically I
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:47.320]  was at the revolving sort of circular door between all of the you know between
[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:51.480]  the Federal Treasury Department and then back to Wall Street and so that's that's
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:55.800]  the economic policy that we have it's that you create debt to float the
[02:13:55.800 --> 02:14:00.840]  financial system and to float the kind of corporate profits that are based on
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:06.240]  having cheap money and using it to to profit to go offshore to not revert
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:10.480]  back in tax revenues that is our current economic policy the fact that the White
[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:14.520]  House the fact that not a lot of people in Congress seem to be discussing this
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:18.320]  or or getting this and it could be one or the other depending on the individual
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:25.000]  it could be stupidity or just you know disengagement but but either way is a
[02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:29.480]  problem obviously for our entire economic policy I think you have to point
[02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:33.560]  fingers at the Fed for for being an enabler you have to point fingers at
[02:14:33.560 --> 02:14:36.880]  the Treasury Department for being an abler and Congress doesn't get a free
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:42.400]  pass because for the most part you know there hasn't been a lot of standing in
[02:14:42.400 --> 02:14:47.480]  the way there hasn't been with the exception of political people standing
[02:14:47.480 --> 02:14:51.680]  up and saying you know what this isn't a good policy for our country not all not
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:56.440]  not just because the Fed is you know basically quasi-private institution that
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:00.840]  helps the private institutions that are on its board but but because it's hurting
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:08.600]  our revenues it's devaluing our money it's bad for the American people who then
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:12.440]  have to pay more for everything that we cannot do without you know which we see
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:16.680]  now in the inflation that's happening in commodity prices and things that we use
[02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:20.040]  in need like like oil you know yes it'd be great if we didn't have to but when
[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:25.240]  we do and since we do in the meantime all of that extra cost comes down on
[02:15:25.240 --> 02:15:28.200]  individuals who aren't lobbying and aren't running the Fed and are running
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:33.480]  the Treasury Department well certainly we have a corrupt Congress a corrupt
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:37.600]  executive but if you look at who gives them the majority of their campaign
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:42.520]  contributions both parties it is the inner group of Wall Street and London and
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:45.840]  European banks that have financed this they're the ones that came in and got
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:50.920]  the 1913 system in place that allowed this to happen just like Obama went to
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:55.880]  the Rockefeller created UN and got their authorization to attack Libya not
[02:15:55.880 --> 02:16:01.440]  Congress the issue here is without the Federal Reserve in place they could have
[02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:06.240]  never engaged in this. All right and just to put numbers on this in the last
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:12.000]  decade or so just just the Wall Street contingent just the financial contingent
[02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.840]  has paid over a billion dollars in lobbying money just and that's like nothing
[02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:20.880]  it's a lot and it's nothing it's it's like a year of bonuses well it's much
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:27.320]  less but it's such a small amount to pay. There are brokerage firm heads that I've
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:31.200]  seen that I mean there are brokerage firm heads I've seen know me that make
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:34.200]  billions a year I mean they're buying the Congress and the president for a
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:40.280]  billion bucks a year this is cheap. It is the best use of money you basically pay
[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:44.640]  almost nothing to get everything in your favor then you get money at 0% when
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:49.760]  after you have screwed up massively and contributed to a crush in the general
[02:16:49.760 --> 02:16:54.640]  economy you don't share you know you don't you don't talk about reinstating
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:59.360]  refinancing mortgages or reducing credit card rates or helping sort of lower the
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:04.000]  debt in general through the country you just increase everybody's cost of
[02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:08.800]  everything and that's that's really what we're dealing with and it's an
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:13.800]  economic policy that will and is and will continue to deteriorate the United
[02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:19.040]  States as a country and it it would be nice it would be you it would be honest
[02:17:19.040 --> 02:17:27.680]  which doesn't happen for for Washington to at least admit the reason for the
[02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:31.560]  magnitude of our debt crisis now we've been going in this direction for a while
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:35.240]  but particularly the last two and a half years the magnitude of the crisis and
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:39.720]  why it has happened and not because unions have high pensions but because we
[02:17:39.720 --> 02:17:45.520]  have doubled our treasury debt in a very short period of time to float a banking
[02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:49.400]  system that doesn't pay revenues into and now we're getting ready to I mean a
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:53.780]  technically country starting to move away from buying T bills that right there
[02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:57.880]  shows that we in the real world the court of public opinion and international
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:03.000]  finance are losing the triple A rating and every time a country goes down that
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:07.800]  road every time countries move down this road of monetizing debt it always ends
[02:18:07.800 --> 02:18:11.560]  the same we know they know and the only thing I may disagree with you in
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:16.080]  closing is you're saying they've screwed up record bonuses vertical
[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:20.200]  integration they've put the police state in place they've been gearing up for
[02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:24.680]  this for decades this thing is clearly planned and we have a lot of their own
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:28.320]  documents showing that just like it was planned by the very same banks doing this
[02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:33.560]  the third world countries know me yeah no it is strategic and it has worked in
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:39.360]  their favor what I'm saying is from our perspective them having had a relapse
[02:18:39.360 --> 02:18:45.680]  momentary in the fall 2008 just just increased you know the the amount of
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:49.240]  money and the amount of debt for our country and amount of money to them at
[02:18:49.240 --> 02:18:56.240]  zero rates and I think that yes in fact if that was completely strategic in
[02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:01.000]  of itself they certainly created a toxic acid bubble and over leveraged bubble
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.200]  that caused them to implode for a minute made money on the way up and then had us
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:11.800]  make money on the other side yeah and we pay it know me friends thank you so
[02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:15.360]  much for joining us really amazing information folks can learn more at

[02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:25.080]  near future 30 seconds closing comments again I think I think we continue to
[02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:30.080]  head down in terms of our value as a currency is our value as an economic
[02:19:30.080 --> 02:19:35.080]  power and I think that the continuation in Washington will be to ignore this and
[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:38.200]  pretend we're in a slow recovery pretend everything's okay because it's people
[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:43.560]  degos and jobs on the line and that ultimately comes down on us absolutely
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:47.320]  and then they pose as our saviors and get even more power with all their media
[02:19:47.320 --> 02:19:50.320]  talking heads telling us that they'll save us if we just give up our rights

[02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:23.440]  Mike Derek Frank Huber is nine and others you're on the air Brian hi Alex
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:28.040]  how you doing oh man I tell you it's unfortunate to be so right though the
[02:24:28.040 --> 02:24:31.680]  incredible police state the total wiretapping of everything by design
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:36.800]  illegally the designed implosion of the economy knowing that a hardcore
[02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:43.040]  intense depressions coming grapes of wrath level it's it's it's it's sobering
[02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:47.760]  yeah tell me about it and I was calling in regards to something that's apropos
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:53.480]  considering who you were just talking to I can remember a lot of the times when
[02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:58.120]  I would go to visit the states and when I had to go to the bank to get US dollars
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:04.880]  I'd end up paying and get getting 67 cents to 75 cents on the dollar now if
[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:07.920]  I was going to travel down to Seattle today and I went to the bank with the
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:12.280]  dollar Canadian I'd get a dollar five US yeah it's it's it's becoming like when
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:16.480]  you visit Mexico you get more because the dollars worth more than the peso well
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:23.360]  now the Canadian currency what the loony is worth more than the dollar and it's
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:28.080]  unreal because I don't think a lot of Americans realize it but it's just so
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:31.040]  historically been that the Canadian dollars always been around somewhere
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:37.320]  around 67 75 cents us and that's what it's a dad the euro for is way above the
[02:25:37.320 --> 02:25:43.040]  dollar now and it's only gonna get worse yep and in other news I just wanted to
[02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:48.040]  say to you that five dollar a gallon gas is here in Canada we're paying a buck
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:55.440]  31 a liter on average where I am and that translates to about 520 a gallon and
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:26:00.080]  if you include the exchange rate that knocks it up to closer to 550 a gallon
[02:26:00.080 --> 02:26:04.520]  amazing and it's only gonna go up now because of global dollar devaluation
[02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:08.360]  because oil is the dominated globally in dollars so no matter if you have a
[02:26:08.360 --> 02:26:12.160]  different currency I mean so many people send me emails saying I don't care of
[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:15.600]  the dollars devalued or I don't care if the stock market goes down it affects
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:19.560]  everything separately because it's a global issue I know it's old news for
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:22.920]  our listeners as we told you specifically what was happening but all cell phones
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:29.360]  not just Apple iPhones are wired into the government and give them your GPS
[02:26:29.360 --> 02:26:34.920]  location and the government also has wireless hubs automatically cracking the
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:40.360]  code because they have the code key and downloading your photos everything do
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:44.640]  people know that they're that their smartphones are now completely tied into
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:49.320]  the government and again it's totally illegal but no one no one gets in
[02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:53.600]  trouble for it I mean is that upset you as a Canadian this is a global system it
[02:26:53.600 --> 02:26:58.440]  does and I mean I I've purposely stayed away from cell phones for that reason I
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:03.600]  mean at sometimes I flirt with the idea of getting one but the newer phones the
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:08.440]  the other thing is even if they're off the authorities can remotely turn them
[02:27:08.440 --> 02:27:13.200]  on and record what's happening wherever you're at by the way that's 1996 law in
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:18.200]  the US adopted the same year in Canada so yeah it's not just the new smartphones
[02:27:18.200 --> 02:27:22.960]  I want folks to understand it's it's all of them but I mean again it's just like
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:27.160]  schools across the country get caught watching kids over their computers at
[02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:34.720]  home I mean it's a diabolical I saw a report yesterday about superintendents
[02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:39.120]  most of them across the country or former military my my high school principal
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:43.760]  here in Austin was a general in the reserves and he actually announced the
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:47.200]  last day of school welcome to the New World Order and I wasn't sure what that
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:51.080]  meant exactly and they had Army helicopters land is like a recruitment
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:54.360]  drive the last day at Anderson High and then other people that went there
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:59.400]  after me said the same thing was done when he was there for years but but the
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:05.760]  issue is that superintendents call in new prospective teachers and they they
[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:10.240]  say if I order you to put kids in danger put them in a hail storm a lightning
[02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:14.920]  storm march them out in the street will you follow the order even if it's wrong
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:19.320]  and when they say no they say you're not getting the job government has
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:24.520]  recruited cult members government cult members who will do whatever they're
[02:28:24.520 --> 02:28:30.320]  told and get off on their power over those that are below them and the cops
[02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:35.160]  will do illegal stuff the principals do I mean all over the country we first got
[02:28:35.160 --> 02:28:37.680]  the reports a year and a half ago and then it was confirmed all over the
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:41.160]  news even though parents said don't they sent a letter home saying we're gonna
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:44.880]  inoculate your kid with with the H1N1 shot when the parents said don't do it
[02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:49.120]  they would say oh we accidentally shot him up I mean this and then it turned out
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:54.280]  they were lying under federal orders and illegally injecting your kid with
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:58.960]  something the insert admitted had all these serious side effects including
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:04.560]  death I mean does that give you an idea of just how dangerous it is that our
[02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:10.160]  government and corporate system globally is made up of yes men does and I
[02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:14.120]  think it the thing in Canada to we're starting to see seepage from some of the
[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:19.240]  policies in the US I think in one sense we're a little bit removed in that we
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:27.520]  have a media which is a little bit more honest but we do find in some ways in
[02:29:27.520 --> 02:29:33.120]  some ways listen have you read the Ottawa citizen where they signed deals
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:37.720]  with the US to use our troops up there against you and vice versa that yes and
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:43.080]  I'm in the Canadian military so I know about that it's it's crazy but and even
[02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:45.600]  in the airport you see the same things happening there that happened down the
[02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:48.760]  state that's right our government's running your airport regulations we'll
[02:29:48.760 --> 02:29:55.760]  be right back great points we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones
[02:29:55.760 --> 02:30:04.640]  and the GCN radio network hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the
[02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:09.640]  last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history as we're
[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:13.440]  finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the
[02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:17.600]  Americans at home I've turned menace influence on our president in
[02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:22.720]  Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of
[02:30:22.720 --> 02:30:27.720]  us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the
[02:30:27.720 --> 02:30:32.520]  enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel held bent on destroying
[02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:36.520]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner
[02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:40.440]  Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:44.440]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and

[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:16.400]  long-term trend forecasters and he said early last year he said by the end of
[02:37:16.400 --> 02:37:23.040]  2010 the US will be technically bankrupt and we'll be in a depression now most
[02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:26.440]  the other economists and analysts we interviewed at that time said yes we are
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:30.720]  now at the point of return the dollar has been devalued commodities are going
[02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:35.840]  up we never left the recession we're in a depression but we're now under 21st
[02:37:35.840 --> 02:37:39.320]  century mind control where they tell us the economy's rebounded and is great
[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:44.680]  even though S&P has come out and said that it's a negative outlook on the
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:47.600]  US keeping its credit rating will basically become like a third world
[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:52.720]  nation the Chinese are dumping the dollar at record rates the Saudis know
[02:37:52.720 --> 02:37:55.360]  they've been double-crossed with the attempted military overthrow by the
[02:37:55.360 --> 02:38:02.320]  globalists there and surrounding them so they've said that demand is low so
[02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:06.840]  they're cutting production with demands and all-time high there's no doubt we're
[02:38:06.840 --> 02:38:10.600]  in the first stages of a serious economic depression and Gerald Salente was
[02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:15.680]  right but it's just like people send me emails and media makes jokes
[02:38:15.680 --> 02:38:19.960]  Joan says buy gold what a cuck they actually say this he's first said buy it
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:25.960]  at 216 now it's 1510 bucks he said by silver when it was five now it's 46
[02:38:25.960 --> 02:38:32.400]  plus it's like saying man this guy you know told you your house was on fire and
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:37.440]  it was on fire he's a nut I mean we've entered a la-la land world where they
[02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:41.320]  tell us the war in Libya isn't a war ground troops on the ground isn't a
[02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:44.320]  ground war and there won't be a ground war though they say it's a ground war
[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:49.600]  but it isn't a ground war they've raised the radiation levels between a
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:53.840]  thousand to 100,000 times what they say was safe previously because we have over
[02:38:53.840 --> 02:39:00.520]  500 times safe levels in cesium, cesium and radioactive iodine 131 we are now
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:07.760]  entering a la-la land or well-vill that that is so bizarre where they knowingly
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:13.440]  think the public's dumbed down and continue to tell us that up as down down
[02:39:13.440 --> 02:39:17.920]  is up black as white Gerald Salente how do you quantify what's happening a
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:23.600]  civilization gone crazy? It's everything is the it's the presidential reality
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:29.480]  show now people have lost their minds they they become prescription drug
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:35.720]  addicted and fast food fattened America doesn't have a fight anymore as I
[02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:40.200]  mentioned to you you know people say oh you're a gloom and doomer I had came out
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:47.360]  with trends 2000 my book back in about 1997 a Warner book and I was so
[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:51.360]  optimistic about the nation you know people were talking about moving
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:56.640]  forward in positive ways and as you said you know up is down and down is up they
[02:39:56.640 --> 02:40:03.520]  don't call a war in in Libya a war it's what a time limited scope limited action
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:10.800]  the UK is now sending over quote advisors and Italy and France officers you
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:14.360]  know what am I six years old and they were already there months ago they were
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:18.120]  there before it started well I know but now they're admitting it but they're
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:23.200]  putting these white shoe boy names on them you know advisors yes they call
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:28.600]  the Vietnam War hey remember Korean War that was a police action you know
[02:40:28.600 --> 02:40:32.400]  nothing's really changed it's only getting worse and as you're talking
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:36.280]  about the economy you know I read something from Jim Sinclair he really
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:41.320]  put it well he said something to the effect of Orwell's 1984 you know how
[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:44.720]  they used to keep blasting out these messages and putting them on the big
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:50.280]  screen he said now you know the the business networks are the 1984 putting
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:55.240]  out the propaganda and that's all it is it's more propaganda on top of all
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:41:01.120]  propaganda they won't call a spade a spade everybody knows that the only
[02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:05.680]  reason that this economy is keeping up at any level at all is because of all the
[02:41:05.680 --> 02:41:10.000]  digital money that they've dumped into the system the trillions look what gold
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:16.040]  is doing you mentioned I called gold at 275 you called it a 260 and look where
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:22.960]  it is now oh and by the way here's one for you go to Forbes magazine they did
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:26.720]  a big story on me you know they called it they called it something about doom
[02:41:26.720 --> 02:41:34.200]  Sayers a forecasting and we had forecast at that time gold was around $720
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:39.520]  an ounce they interviewed my assistant but when she came to work from us for us
[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:45.400]  a bond company went bust she cashed out all her 401ks and put it into gold and
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:51.360]  then now remember gold is about 725 at the time it's more than doubled since
[02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:56.680]  then a few years ago exactly so now they write this well you know
[02:41:56.680 --> 02:42:03.120]  so Lenti's a doom and gloomer and gold could go down as easily go down below
[02:42:03.120 --> 02:42:09.600]  No that's what I'm saying we're bad because we're right so now we contacted these
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:15.480]  little weasels that Forbes this guy would be nothing if his daddy didn't have
[02:42:15.480 --> 02:42:20.280]  any money right now you know he's the big mouth out there do you know they
[02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:24.840]  won't even write a retraction they won't even say that we're right after they
[02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:30.800]  took a cheap shot at me that flabbermouth out there he's all over the place so
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:35.960]  Lenti was right Forbes was wrong and they won't give you any credit for it
[02:42:35.960 --> 02:42:41.360]  well they also run around they also they pounce on you as you know well they
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:46.400]  also run around and say that you're wrong about saying we're in a depression by
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:53.760]  every yardstick what three quarters oh yeah three quarters of no growth and a
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:58.400]  few other indicators is a depression we're now with cookbooks several years
[02:42:58.400 --> 02:43:02.840]  into no growth with the debt spiraling out of control if this isn't a
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:06.640]  depression with half the restaurants I used to go to be in close where I live
[02:43:06.640 --> 02:43:12.480]  commercial real estate going under the news coming out that private real
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:16.800]  estate home real estate is still plunging and they tell us that's great
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:22.440]  look look at the numbers home real estate values are down to worse than
[02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:26.760]  great depression levels how's that for a depression error level go to John
[02:43:26.760 --> 02:43:33.120]  Williams shadow statistics look up the unemployment rate it's around 22% you
[02:43:33.120 --> 02:43:37.680]  try this one on Alex yeah there's a recovery you know where recovery is
[02:43:37.680 --> 02:43:45.400]  coming from 10% of the population in the United States owns 90% of all the
[02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:55.480]  stocks all the bonds all the mutual funds 5% own 63% of everything no there's
[02:43:55.480 --> 02:44:01.920]  not a depression oh in the meanwhile out there everybody's wages have declined
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:07.360]  oh but there's not inflation out there oh no they cook those numbers too of
[02:44:07.360 --> 02:44:12.000]  course there's a depression going on people are losing everything I want to
[02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:15.880]  go back because you can always remember what journal what date and people can go
[02:44:15.880 --> 02:44:21.280]  to your website and pull it up and see it for themselves but I remember over a
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:26.440]  year ago because it was early 2010 you said it's gonna be clear that it's a
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:30.760]  depression by the end of the year and it's clear a few months ago and you said
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:34.480]  there's gonna be war and it's gonna be in the Middle East it's gonna be in
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:39.320]  Central Asia and you absolutely called it what journal was that so people can go
[02:44:39.320 --> 02:44:46.480]  to trends research the spring 2010 trends journal it was the great war and
[02:44:46.480 --> 02:44:52.720]  then this past autumn we came out with off with their heads 2.0 and the
[02:44:52.720 --> 02:44:58.680]  trends journal it just came out yesterday the whole issue is devoted to
[02:44:58.680 --> 02:45:06.120]  the first great war of the 21st century you put all the pieces together Alex
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:10.880]  when you're talking about the police state we're living in because they know
[02:45:10.880 --> 02:45:16.800]  it's happening it's out of control and the last thing they're going to do is to
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:25.360]  control us that's all the plan they look Libby is not a one-off Tunisia Egypt
[02:45:25.360 --> 02:45:33.360]  Bahrain Yemen Algeria Morocco Syria Jordan how does you know how does you
[02:45:33.360 --> 02:45:39.480]  know because the whole you know I know for the same reason Bernie Madoff know
[02:45:39.480 --> 02:45:44.560]  Bernie Madoff did an interview recently and he said what we've been saying all
[02:45:44.560 --> 02:45:50.960]  along it's nothing more than one big Ponzi scheme when they came out with the
[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:56.960]  top bailouts in 2008 we sent out a trend alert and we said in that trend alert
[02:45:56.960 --> 02:46:05.000]  that when all else fails they take you to war that's what's going on they can't
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:09.360]  bail out any more European banks oh and by the way this hardly made the news
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:14.680]  as you know Finland just voted in a new party they're not going to be party to
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:19.560]  the bailouts if all the European nations the emunations don't go into the
[02:46:19.560 --> 02:46:24.200]  bailouts it doesn't happen where they what's the bailout by the way oh here's
[02:46:24.200 --> 02:46:30.080]  a bailout for you what bailout how about bailing in they give you more debt they
[02:46:30.080 --> 02:46:35.520]  cannot they cannot handle the bankers get the money and then we get to pay
[02:46:35.520 --> 02:46:41.000]  them interest for the right to give them money that's how sick this is the Wall
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:48.760]  Street Journal reports today a 77% profit in 2010 for General Electric who
[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:55.040]  basically runs the White House Economic Council and paid zero corporate tax
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:47:03.440]  ladies and gentlemen and it's GE and their MSNBC scapegoating the middle
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:10.600]  class Alex Jones Gerald Salente you know doctors lawyers professors we're being
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:15.400]  scapegoated and told we've got to pay more to quote fix the debt but the money
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:20.640]  that we pay goes right to the bankers exactly and that's why we came off with
[02:47:20.640 --> 02:47:25.400]  that with with the off with their heads trends journal and that's what's going
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:31.680]  on in Europe the only reason why Europe hasn't imploded yet like the Middle East
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:35.920]  is because there in the Middle East people have the autocrats the monarchs
[02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:43.280]  the dictators in in Europe they're still living under the illusion that they
[02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:50.400]  have a democracy so like in Ireland they just put in another criminal group to
[02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:56.360]  replace the other criminal group they're still living under the illusion that you
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:01.440]  can change it in the ballot box let me stop you the system knows the illusion
[02:48:01.440 --> 02:48:05.080]  is wearing thin and so now everything we've told people about because it was
[02:48:05.080 --> 02:48:09.800]  public is now being announced not just Apple all smartphones under federal law
[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:16.400]  telecommunications act of 96 track you in real time upload your location give
[02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:21.360]  them all your data police all over the country I have wireless systems with

[02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:40.800]  when you try to fly steal your laptop data I mean they are so criminal Gerald
[02:48:40.800 --> 02:48:44.760]  and you go back last year Bloomberg reports 11 years ago secret deal signed
[02:48:44.760 --> 02:48:49.760]  veterans affairs with the big insurance companies to secretly steal the life
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:54.160]  insurance money of world war through vets through current vets I mean to even
[02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:59.520]  get my mind around how unbelievably criminal they are and that they've been
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:06.520]  authorized to do it it staggers the imagination that they're going for broke
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:11.440]  they've committed so many crimes Gerald they're not gonna stop Alex you know
[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:16.200]  that I was one of the first people when they started all these bailouts on the
[02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:21.640]  bush and then continued under Obama and they called it socialism and Marxism I
[02:49:21.640 --> 02:49:28.520]  said no it's not it's fascism fascism has come to America the merger of state
[02:49:28.520 --> 02:49:33.560]  and corporate powers you just talked about GE do you have to go any further
[02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:38.240]  than that you could keep going down the line you're talking about all the apps
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:42.520]  and everything else with how the the companies are all working in tandem
[02:49:42.520 --> 02:49:48.800]  together to rob us fascism has come to America here try this one on I
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:56.920]  unilaterally decided that our core interests and that of our allies are
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:50:04.000]  at stake so we're going to bomb Libya what are that happen to we the people
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:08.080]  that's a really you know what our cane cons whatever happened to Congress is
[02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:14.120]  illegal exactly but they're am saying it's gone it's over and that's what the
[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:20.520]  our issue is the first great war and what we're telling people to do is to
[02:50:20.520 --> 02:50:29.680]  prove prepare survive and prevail because people better grow up here the game

[02:54:11.120 --> 02:54:19.840]  segment go to infowars.com to listen this is a quote by Cicero over 2040
[02:54:19.840 --> 02:54:28.600]  years ago a nation can survive its fools and even the ambitious but it cannot
[02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:34.720]  survive treason from within an enemy at the gates is less formidable for he is
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:39.280]  known and carries his banner openly but the traitor moves amongst those within
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:44.880]  the gate freely his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys in PR or
[02:54:44.880 --> 02:54:49.480]  the snake voices heard in the very halls of government itself for the traitor
[02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:54.720]  appears not a traitor he speaks an accent familiar to his victims and he
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:55:00.800]  wears their face and their arguments he appeals to the baseness that lies
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:05.240]  deep in the hearts of all men he rots the soul of the nation he works
[02:55:05.240 --> 02:55:11.680]  secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city he
[02:55:11.680 --> 02:55:18.280]  infects the body politic so that it no longer can resist a murderer is less to
[02:55:18.280 --> 02:55:24.640]  fear the traitor is the plague Cicero of course was killed after Caesar was killed
[02:55:24.640 --> 02:55:29.160]  for basically going along with not wanting a tyrant so that's a Cicero
[02:55:29.160 --> 02:55:34.480]  Roman Empire more than 2,000 years ago and it's true the traitor is the plague
[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:39.760]  is it not Gerald Salente look what they're doing they now they're guy
[02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:45.280]  they're putting the guise of war as humanitarian missions you know with
[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:51.200]  least bush called it a preemptive issue then now they're they're taking us to
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:56.200]  war under the guise of humanitarian and they're using that again as part of the
[02:55:56.200 --> 02:56:02.240]  nomenclature and it's easy it's exactly right the traitors are amongst us and and
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:06.640]  the people again the people have lost the fight in this country I just read an
[02:56:06.640 --> 02:56:14.080]  article about in Ohio for example there are more kids dying from overdosing on
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:20.080]  on prescription drug painkillers than then then auto accidents a drunk driving
[02:56:20.080 --> 02:56:26.560]  you know so that the whole morality of the nation is being rotted out I was
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:31.920]  mentioning before the break about what I read today Hillary Clinton chastising
[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:38.720]  Gaddafi for using it's allegedly using cluster bombs and I said to myself well
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:43.000]  that's interesting how about all that depleted uranium the United States dump
[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  all over Iraq oh that's okay and now Libya oh oh yeah and how about Israel you
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:56.040]  know bombing Lebanon with cluster bombs oh not a peep about that you know so they
[02:56:56.040 --> 02:57:01.080]  have power and how about those predator drones listen Gaddafi's a rookie I mean
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:05.640]  he should be picking up America's atrocities could you imagine if they
[02:57:05.640 --> 02:57:13.360]  had a Abu Ghrae in in in Libya how they would be talking about that and the
[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:16.960]  mainstream media you know what I've come up with the name for them they're
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:24.840]  nothing more than prostitutes their whores for the people in power it's the

[03:00:56.200 --> 03:00:59.080]  into your research they now admit this whole world government Gerald you were
[03:00:59.080 --> 03:01:03.680]  elaborating on the fact that this is a world government looking forward into
[03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:07.880]  the future not just the near future but out from that how do you see this ending
[03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:11.920]  because now the rats are starting to leave the sinking ship we're now seeing
[03:01:11.920 --> 03:01:17.440]  you know globalists like Newt Yenrit saying get rid of Bernanke we're now
[03:01:17.440 --> 03:01:20.440]  we're now seeing polls showing the majority of people want to get rid of
[03:01:20.440 --> 03:01:24.640]  the Fed looks like this ruling class that controls the political class of
[03:01:24.640 --> 03:01:29.720]  whores is in trouble well it to an extent but remember you know that the
[03:01:29.720 --> 03:01:34.440]  game is rigged and they're running the game I mean to me the only outside shot
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:40.560]  is a Ron Paul and you know I was on that he's one of my people I like to be on
[03:01:40.560 --> 03:01:46.520]  the lot with is Judge Andrew Napolitano and on Fox and he told me one of the
[03:01:46.520 --> 03:01:52.520]  most successful shows he had was when he had Ron Paul and Ralph Nader on but
[03:01:52.520 --> 03:01:57.040]  talking about a progressive libertarian party progressive in the terms of foods
[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:01.040]  like you mentioned eat foods and they're clean food and by the way you know I
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:07.520]  coined that term clean food in 1993 so I am concerned about what I eat you know
[03:02:07.520 --> 03:02:12.720]  I'm concerned about the environment in the water and yet I'm with Ron Paul on
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:16.720]  the other end I don't want my money going overseas you know I love this
[03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:22.160]  Hillary Clinton she's a real sport with our dough she just told Japan well as
[03:02:22.160 --> 03:02:26.720]  we'll help them out too they go around and give our money to everybody we just
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:31.040]  gave Israel some more money for their missile defense system I'm sick and
[03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:35.080]  tired of these people telling me where my money has to go by the way they're
[03:02:35.080 --> 03:02:39.200]  gonna make the Japanese people pay for Tokyo electric and general electric
[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:43.160]  even though the general electric zone engineers quit 30 something years ago
[03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:46.880]  and they built those so general electric Tokyo electric they don't to pay
[03:02:46.880 --> 03:02:51.320]  nothing the Japanese people they're gonna pay and we'll pay because she's
[03:02:51.320 --> 03:02:56.080]  already donated some of our money so what I'm saying is that the only way out
[03:02:56.080 --> 03:03:01.120]  to answer your question to me is a third party because this we don't have
[03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:05.800]  this isn't democracy in America you know they don't represent us and you talked
[03:03:05.800 --> 03:03:10.240]  about the cops you know two weeks ago I got two tickets one on a Saturday night
[03:03:10.240 --> 03:03:15.480]  and one on a Sunday and and yes kid you know he was groomed to be a perfect
[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:19.760]  young Nazi you know they're crawling all over everything but then won't
[03:03:19.760 --> 03:03:24.600]  respond to real crime now exactly so they have become the police have become
[03:03:24.600 --> 03:03:30.720]  the enforcers for the crime bosses you haven't seen one head roll on Wall
[03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:35.760]  Street so when I say to the police and I know I know a number of them do what's
[03:03:35.760 --> 03:03:40.720]  right morally not what your corrupt boss who's tied into the politicians is
[03:03:40.720 --> 03:03:46.360]  telling you to do to bring more revenue in because taxes are going down do
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:51.400]  what's right morally and to me Alex that's the only way out of all of these
[03:03:51.400 --> 03:03:55.520]  problems no amount of taxes I mean just a few years ago I drive to work and I'd
[03:03:55.520 --> 03:04:01.600]  see five cops now I might see 20 I mean they are feeding on us and they're
[03:04:01.600 --> 03:04:06.240]  pulling people over going one mile over the speed limit now I know I am saying
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:10.800]  you know I don't want to go out at night anymore you know I have one drink and I
[03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:16.080]  only you know will they be after me you know meanwhile as I said the real
[03:04:16.080 --> 03:04:21.600]  criminals like try Congress they get off with a slight how about that guy
[03:04:21.600 --> 03:04:26.240]  Charlie Wrangler remember him yeah yeah remember all the stuff that he got caught
[03:04:26.240 --> 03:04:31.080]  doing how about all these people like Dashul and and Geithner who never pay
[03:04:31.080 --> 03:04:36.320]  their taxes oh they get caught they say oh you know I made a mistake your eye
[03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:42.360]  get caught boy we're doing hard time for a long time yeah I'm Gerald again give
