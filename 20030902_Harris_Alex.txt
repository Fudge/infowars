[00:00:01.747 --> 00:00:09.997]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:09.997 --> 00:00:17.225]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central and then back from 9 to midnight I do this show.
[00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.227]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.207]  Go out on the AM and FM dial and tell us good coast.
[00:00:22.207 --> 00:00:32.309]  We sample cast on shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 93.20 and then night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.591]  We chronicle the criminal activities of the global elite and their crime syndicates, their allied crime syndicates as well.
[00:00:40.663 --> 00:00:44.364]  And coming up before the show ends today, regulating vitamins.
[00:00:44.364 --> 00:00:45.645]  This is from the Washington Times.
[00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:46.425]  There's a new bill.
[00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:47.325]  They tried it in 93.
[00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:48.486]  Clinton tried it.
[00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:50.826]  It will ban over-the-counter pills of all vitamins, folks.
[00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:53.087]  It'll make the FDA control it.
[00:00:53.087 --> 00:00:54.107]  Big Pharma wants this.
[00:00:54.107 --> 00:00:55.968]  You have to buy vitamin C from them.
[00:00:55.968 --> 00:01:01.990]  This is the same folks that tell you radiating meat for school children is good.
[00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.030]  We'll tell you about the bill.
[00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.830]  It's S722.
[00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.611]  It has a good chance of passing.
[00:01:06.818 --> 00:01:09.600]  Just a lot more, some other serious issues coming up.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:22.490]  This is the same government that says 1,900 times the so-called safe level of DU for our troops to breathe is good, but they want you to not be able to buy that vitamin C. And by the way, Europe's already done this, by the way.
[00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.171]  So whatever happens there, then happens here.
[00:01:24.171 --> 00:01:31.057]  And everything that's happening destroys liberty and freedom, destroys our constitutional republic.
[00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.598]  This is out of the plain dealer.
[00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.192]  Cleveland's big newspaper, Voting Machine Controversy, Columbus.
[00:01:38.192 --> 00:01:50.221]  The head of a company vying to sell voting machines in Ohio told Republicans in a fundraising letter that he is committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year.
[00:01:50.221 --> 00:02:01.890]  The August 14th letter from Walden O'Dell, chief executive of Diebold Incorporated, who has become active in re-election effort for President Bush, prompted Democrats this week to question the proprietary
[00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:11.290]  And, uh, of allowing O'Dell Company to calculate votes in the 2004 presidential election.
[00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.056]  O'Dell, it goes on, attended a strategy powwow with wealthy Bush benefactors known as the Rangers and Pioneers, and it goes on and on.
[00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:21.719]  Now, we had Bev on a few months ago.
[00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:28.645]  She said she was breaking the major news because she's a lady who's been hired by Fortune 500 companies to expose corporate corruption in their own systems.
[00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:31.519]  They found Diebold and other big companies.
[00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.719]  They looked at the source code of Diebold and others.
[00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:34.700]  This has been in everything.
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.982]  Denver Post, Associated Press, Reuters, all over that these things are designed for fraud.
[00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:48.925]  You've got electronic access, wireless internet hooked into them, weird tabulation systems.
[00:02:48.925 --> 00:02:54.647]  I mean, it's designed with fraud in mind with no paper trail.
[00:02:55.502 --> 00:03:03.049]  And then you've got Senator Hagel involved in owning the company out in Nebraska that's being put in everywhere.
[00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.129]  I mean, it's scary.
[00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.093]  But again, they count on us not being able to face the horror of this.
[00:03:08.093 --> 00:03:13.397]  Now, Bev Harris, we're so honored to have you on BlackBoxVoting.com and Org.
[00:03:13.397 --> 00:03:15.519]  Last time you were on, you were breaking all this.
[00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.682]  Weeks later, what you had broken came out all over the news.
[00:03:19.703 --> 00:03:26.114]  Give us a nutshell of what we're facing and what this new article means with this Odell.
[00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.199]  There's so much.
[00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.779]  Well, we have a lot to break.
[00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:35.702]  It's interesting, isn't it, how we break something and three or four months later the news actually catches up to it.
[00:03:35.702 --> 00:03:39.143]  That tells you a lot about what's happening with the media in our country.
[00:03:39.143 --> 00:03:42.745]  But I will take my hat off to the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
[00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:47.807]  They are unafraid and they are out there covering this and so is the Akron Beacon Journal.
[00:03:47.807 --> 00:03:49.828]  They're two of very few
[00:03:50.678 --> 00:03:54.739]  Media outlets that are actually going out and doing real investigative work.
[00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.060]  This should be top story.
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.700]  Top story.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.281]  They should all be ripped out everywhere.
[00:03:58.281 --> 00:03:59.341]  You bet.
[00:03:59.341 --> 00:04:01.822]  And AP Wire, by the way, is picking up this stuff.
[00:04:01.822 --> 00:04:08.264]  But what is really a problem is now usually when the AP Wire service picks it up, it gets into 50 to 200 newspapers.
[00:04:08.264 --> 00:04:10.365]  But the main newspapers are
[00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:14.167]  Blacking out the AP wire stories on this stuff.
[00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:15.908]  So we've got some press that are doing their job.
[00:04:15.908 --> 00:04:17.029]  Or they take it and edit it down, Bev.
[00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:21.512]  Or they take it and say, there's been a few problems, don't worry, the feds are going to fix it.
[00:04:21.512 --> 00:04:23.373]  Oh no, no, this is really interesting.
[00:04:23.373 --> 00:04:31.519]  But yeah, we've got special break and I guess what we'll do is we'll break it here and then people can watch for it in the news in the next few months as they have been.
[00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:32.620]  Alright, honored to have you.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.940]  Go ahead.
[00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:43.563]  Yeah, one of the things that I found absolutely stunning was of course, well we've known that the Diebold executives have been a major
[00:04:44.605 --> 00:04:48.247]  Major political folks behind the Bush administration.
[00:04:48.247 --> 00:04:50.789]  It's not just Wally O'Dell, it's also W.H.
[00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.391]  Timkin, who is another director from Diebold.
[00:04:53.391 --> 00:04:56.713]  Now, understand that Bush has only about a hundred pioneers.
[00:04:56.713 --> 00:05:06.859]  The Bush pioneers are the group that kind of meets behind the scenes and are the powerhouse political strategists and fundraisers for George W. Bush.
[00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:10.982]  Two of the hundred Bush pioneers run Diebold.
[00:05:10.982 --> 00:05:12.183]  I mean, think about that!
[00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:13.904]  That's really unusual, isn't it?
[00:05:14.384 --> 00:05:15.645]  So, W.H.
[00:05:15.645 --> 00:05:24.249]  Timkin is a Bush pioneer, and Wally Odell is, and not only did he promise to deliver the vote, which is amazing, he did so in writing.
[00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:29.812]  He promised to deliver the vote to Bush, even though he runs the voting machine company.
[00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:35.596]  He visited President Bush at the Crawford Ranch in early August.
[00:05:35.596 --> 00:05:40.118]  He was down there with a group of other Bush pioneers, strategizing on how to win the election.
[00:05:40.118 --> 00:05:41.759]  Now, how inappropriate is this?
[00:05:42.199 --> 00:06:01.196]  Now, by the way, for those that don't know, last time you were on a few months ago, and now it's broken, I mean, Baltimore Sun, you name it, Austin American Statesman, everything you said here on the show, that it's got wireless connections to the boxes they didn't tell anybody about, these three different levels of codes, hundreds of top programmers looked at it and agreed with your programmers,
[00:06:01.596 --> 00:06:13.246]  information uh... that that these things are designed for backdoor access and then the League of Women Voters is out campaigning that the government pass a law that we not be allowed to have a paper ballot.
[00:06:13.246 --> 00:06:14.687]  I mean this is crazy!
[00:06:14.687 --> 00:06:16.569]  Well exactly and here's what's happened.
[00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:27.018]  They've gone after, what they did was they went after a few of the organizations but they went at them from the top down and they do not represent, by the way, what their own constituency says.
[00:06:27.418 --> 00:06:33.041]  Because we've been in contact with many of the League of Women Voters' local chapters, and they're furious about this.
[00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:36.343]  They're saying, no, we want a paper ballot.
[00:06:36.343 --> 00:06:38.705]  We are not throwing away the evidence.
[00:06:38.705 --> 00:06:53.173]  And what's happened is I believe what we need to do now is start looking at the contributions to these organizations, because I'll betcha that they went to the head of the League of Women Voters and to a couple other organizations and made hefty contributions.
[00:06:53.733 --> 00:06:59.098]  I also just found out today, now we are starting to get into the civil rights community with this.
[00:06:59.098 --> 00:07:04.223]  And they're implying that the civil rights community is behind this no paper trail voting.
[00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:05.704]  Well that is a lie.
[00:07:05.704 --> 00:07:07.465]  What they're doing is they're quoting this
[00:07:08.855 --> 00:07:16.822]  Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, which by the way has backed away from that position and is not even saying now that they are against the paper trail.
[00:07:16.822 --> 00:07:20.806]  But the voting vendors got to them, got a statement out of them.
[00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:30.714]  But when we looked at the constituency of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the people who were jumping in were not the people of color.
[00:07:30.714 --> 00:07:33.016]  They were not the NAACP.
[00:07:33.016 --> 00:07:34.578]  They were not the black churches.
[00:07:34.998 --> 00:07:41.082]  They were the League of Women Voters who happened to be a member, and a couple of labor unions who happened to be a member.
[00:07:41.082 --> 00:07:43.864]  Okay, for folks that are missing what you're saying, Bev, is... Yeah.
[00:07:43.864 --> 00:07:50.209]  The establishment, the three voting machine companies, all CIA, government, senator connections, I mean, just unbelievable.
[00:07:50.942 --> 00:08:03.611]  With all the code source and all this corruption going on, that these are designed for this, they claim, oh yeah, well, the minorities want it, so you're against it, which is just their classic tactic.
[00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:09.515]  But I would also add to this that only in a few cases have we seen attempts at censorship of this show and others.
[00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:26.501]  And when they were putting in electronic touchscreens last year, and we confronted them and exposed it, we had actual threats, phone calls, attempts at censorship on this issue by quote, members of the media here in Austin that are steering this, that were steering this into place.
[00:08:26.501 --> 00:08:31.562]  So, this is very important to them because they know this means total control and domination.
[00:08:31.562 --> 00:08:32.743]  No more voting, folks!
[00:08:33.823 --> 00:08:51.653]  And I will tell you this, I have had six, count them, six investigative reporters for huge news outlets who have called me and privately told me that they have been lobbying to cover this story and they have been told by their management that they are not to cover it.
[00:08:51.653 --> 00:08:54.055]  And these are major organizations.
[00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:56.316]  Folks, do you hear what we're saying?
[00:08:56.977 --> 00:09:06.199]  Major papers have had to admit, they just calmly go, yeah, these things are built for fraud, totally designed, owned by the government, and weird shadowy grids, and your vote doesn't count?
[00:09:06.199 --> 00:09:07.159]  Ha ha ha!
[00:09:07.159 --> 00:09:13.500]  And now on top of it, six major investigative journalists call you and say, I'm not allowed to report on this.
[00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:19.641]  Right, and it's so funny because they'll say, please keep sending me this stuff, and I wish I could break this, because there's something to break.
[00:09:19.641 --> 00:09:22.242]  I could get a filter out of this, you know?
[00:09:22.242 --> 00:09:24.402]  And they're like, but, you know, I'm not,
[00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.531]  Every time I put my proposal forward, it's not getting taken up on.
[00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:29.331]  And you would be stunned.
[00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:32.512]  I mean, some of these are international publications.
[00:09:32.512 --> 00:09:35.533]  And they're just... It's just amazing.
[00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:40.815]  Some of them are major... You know, people ask about the major TV investigative magazine shows.
[00:09:40.815 --> 00:09:42.616]  I can tell you they've been in touch with me.
[00:09:42.616 --> 00:09:44.996]  I can also tell you that it's been killed.
[00:09:44.996 --> 00:09:46.157]  The story's been killed.
[00:09:46.157 --> 00:09:48.417]  And it's not their producers that are killing it.
[00:09:48.417 --> 00:09:49.958]  It's getting killed at Madison level.
[00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.199]  Well, right here in Austin, right here in Austin, Deb Harris, Danica DuBois, the county clerk,
[00:09:54.153 --> 00:10:02.238]  He got caught in 98 with the paper ballots, double counting ballot boxes, breaking safety seals, falsifying signatures.
[00:10:02.238 --> 00:10:06.400]  That was in the paper, but the state board said it was, quote, an accident.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.863]  In the middle of the night at 2 a.m., her good friend that was losing suddenly was winning.
[00:10:11.503 --> 00:10:14.827]  This all comes out, and now she's the one pushing the touch screens.
[00:10:14.827 --> 00:10:15.588]  Of course.
[00:10:15.588 --> 00:10:17.890]  I mean, it's just, I don't know what to say about it anymore.
[00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:23.737]  But you know, I've got a much bigger way to go with this, if and when you're ready.
[00:10:23.737 --> 00:10:25.018]  Do it right now!
[00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:30.104]  Okay, well, we were able to get into a private teleconference.
[00:10:30.584 --> 00:10:34.006]  There was a conference that was held by teleconference in Houston.
[00:10:34.006 --> 00:10:37.349]  It was run by the Election Center and the voting machine manufacturers.
[00:10:37.349 --> 00:10:39.050]  It was supposed to be a secret.
[00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:44.353]  My publisher, David Allen from Black Box Voting, he runs Plan 9 Publishing.
[00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:51.438]  He managed to get into this and it was actually quite funny because they had all this supposed security around their teleconference.
[00:10:51.438 --> 00:10:57.262]  But he actually dialed in and he signed in with his own name and no one asked him who he was.
[00:10:57.262 --> 00:11:00.264]  So he sat there and transcribed this meeting.
[00:11:01.144 --> 00:11:06.527]  And this meeting, which was between, understand, it was an insider meeting.
[00:11:06.527 --> 00:11:20.575]  What they were discussing, among other things, was can Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, defense contractors, you know, can they help us with our PR problem now, like they helped get the HAVA bill through?
[00:11:20.575 --> 00:11:24.117]  The HAVA bill is the bill that requires that we buy all these new touchscreen machines.
[00:11:25.111 --> 00:11:25.972]  I gotta stop you.
[00:11:25.972 --> 00:11:26.953]  We're about to break.
[00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:35.100]  They just said this is insiders saying and admitting that the defense industry was behind getting this bill through.
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.341]  I gotta stop you, Bev Harris.
[00:11:36.341 --> 00:11:37.842]  This is massive.
[00:11:37.842 --> 00:11:39.023]  Folks, this is so huge.
[00:11:39.023 --> 00:11:40.605]  I'll tell you why when we get back.
[00:11:40.605 --> 00:11:44.768]  If you haven't figured it out yet, do you know who's putting up the red light cameras?
[00:11:44.768 --> 00:11:46.009]  Lockheed Martin.
[00:11:46.009 --> 00:11:49.412]  Who puts on the ads about thumb scanning for biometrics?
[00:11:49.412 --> 00:11:51.454]  Lockheed Martin.
[00:11:51.454 --> 00:11:52.175]  They're in a meeting.
[00:11:52.859 --> 00:11:54.500]  The biometrics.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.540]  The RFID.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:56.801]  Remember the meeting with Ridge?
[00:11:56.801 --> 00:12:09.947]  We'll be right back.
[00:12:09.947 --> 00:12:12.328]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:12:12.328 --> 00:12:20.731]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:12:20.731 --> 00:12:22.132]  Investigator Bev Harris
[00:12:23.334 --> 00:12:25.156]  Just dropped a major bombshell on us.
[00:12:25.156 --> 00:12:36.545]  The news she reported here a few months ago is now top story in a lot of big newspapers, but they never made it onto the nightly television news where most people get their propaganda.
[00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:48.435]  We talked to the head of Caspian, the group that exposes the whole cashless society and what's happening with the tracking there, about the secret meetings with the biometric consortium, the RFID consortium,
[00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:54.489]  With Governor Ridge of quote, making us take it in the name of fighting terrorism.
[00:12:54.489 --> 00:13:00.910]  We know that Lockheed Martin and others are involved in funding domestic propaganda operations.
[00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.271]  Folks, this is military coup.
[00:13:04.271 --> 00:13:05.451]  This is Russia.
[00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:06.251]  This is China.
[00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:07.591]  This is so big.
[00:13:07.591 --> 00:13:16.333]  You're telling me the military industrial complex that in this discussion group, this closed
[00:13:17.067 --> 00:13:18.821]  Secret Conference!
[00:13:19.634 --> 00:13:28.619]  that you guys got into, Bev Harris, that they were discussing using the military-industrial complex to smash opposition to this.
[00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:31.061]  Please tell us, please give us the details.
[00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:47.690]  Yeah, what happened is they set up, okay, well as we all know, we've been getting a lot of press for the problems and part of that comes from, well all of it comes from, the fact that we were able to find the cache of Diebold files, the Diebold voting machine files, 40,000 files they left on a website,
[00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.530]  We're good to go.
[00:14:08.985 --> 00:14:10.485]  A paper trail.
[00:14:10.485 --> 00:14:11.205]  A paper trail.
[00:14:11.205 --> 00:14:12.406]  Voter verified ballots.
[00:14:12.406 --> 00:14:17.987]  That just means you look at the ballot and it's kept in a ballot box like we've been doing since the beginning of time.
[00:14:17.987 --> 00:14:19.607]  And it's evidence.
[00:14:19.607 --> 00:14:22.027]  Okay, they want to get rid of the evidence.
[00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:28.048]  So, the industry had a meeting to figure out what to do about this PR fiasco.
[00:14:28.048 --> 00:14:38.150]  In the meeting, it was set up, by the way, very inappropriately by the election center, which is supposed to represent the voters and the people, set up a meeting with a lobbyist
[00:14:38.692 --> 00:14:42.498]  And the vendor to deal with this PR problem.
[00:14:42.498 --> 00:14:45.823]  The lobbyist that was running the meeting was the ITAA.
[00:14:45.823 --> 00:14:49.128]  It's a series of initials that stands for a bunch of things.
[00:14:49.742 --> 00:14:59.509]  Suffice it to say, it's very tightly connected to another bunch of initials, SAIC, which is a big Pentagon contractor.
[00:14:59.509 --> 00:15:02.451]  Now, this is just so bizarre.
[00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:09.456]  Let me draw this loop for you, and I'm sorry to have to come up with things with initials, but the military likes to do things with initials.
[00:15:10.586 --> 00:15:11.867]  You have Diebold.
[00:15:11.867 --> 00:15:15.248]  Diebold software is exposed to be flawed.
[00:15:15.248 --> 00:15:24.313]  They then get the state of Maryland and the state of Ohio to request a supposed independent investigation of Diebold security.
[00:15:24.313 --> 00:15:31.456]  They commission a group called SAIC to do the supposedly independent evaluation of Diebold voting machine security.
[00:15:32.273 --> 00:15:35.815]  The SAIC is mainly a Pentagon contractor.
[00:15:35.815 --> 00:15:39.996]  It's sort of like a mercenary version of the CIA in much of what it does.
[00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:57.063]  It has about eight... It's like a corrupt five-time convicted felon who is the informant who they then call in to testify against you in court and you can't bring up the fact that it's a convicted felon with charges against him and if they don't testify they're going to jail.
[00:15:57.063 --> 00:16:00.765]  So it's some government owned and run quasi-public private group.
[00:16:00.985 --> 00:16:05.088]  Oh, it's a private group that does CIA-like stuff.
[00:16:05.088 --> 00:16:07.971]  It does surveillance and it does all kinds of things like that.
[00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:10.673]  Oh, what a nice group to tell us Diebold is good!
[00:16:10.673 --> 00:16:19.340]  Yeah, it's basically a mercenary CIA that does other things too, but their job is to come up with the report on Diebold.
[00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:28.167]  Except their senior vice president is the director for the ITIA, which is in there saying they're going to lobby to whitewash this whole thing.
[00:16:29.355 --> 00:16:30.616]  Understand what I'm saying.
[00:16:30.616 --> 00:16:45.144]  The supposedly independent pentagon contractor who's supposed to do an independent evaluation of Diebold security, they're tied to the lobbying group that is promising to whitewash this thing.
[00:16:46.664 --> 00:16:48.445]  Now, how inappropriate is that?
[00:16:48.445 --> 00:16:49.505]  So did you record?
[00:16:49.505 --> 00:16:51.946]  I mean, why just do a transcript?
[00:16:51.946 --> 00:16:53.746]  I will tell you there is evidence, okay?
[00:16:53.746 --> 00:16:56.287]  And there's also three witnesses that will testify.
[00:16:56.287 --> 00:16:58.848]  Because it wasn't just us that was in this meeting.
[00:16:58.848 --> 00:17:03.050]  And obviously with some of the state laws, some states you can't record something in a phone conversation.
[00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.970]  It is legal in some states.
[00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:09.712]  So let's just say we've got transcripts of three witnesses and yeah, there's some tapes, but oh, maybe not.
[00:17:10.247 --> 00:17:15.948]  Well, it depends on the state, and so we'll have to, you know, go through that.
[00:17:15.948 --> 00:17:18.789]  How long did this whole thing go on?
[00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:22.990]  With the government, and the vendor, and the lobbyist, and, oh, we'll just get the Defense Department?
[00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:24.670]  It's crazy!
[00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:32.091]  I mean, you have the same group that's doing the independent investigation tied to the group that's supposed to do the whitewash.
[00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:34.812]  And get this, now this was on Friday, August 22nd.
[00:17:36.175 --> 00:17:37.416]  What a shakedown!
[00:17:37.416 --> 00:17:41.379]  They tell the vendors they've got seven days to come up with $200,000.
[00:17:41.379 --> 00:17:47.244]  And if they don't participate, they may not be protected.
[00:17:47.244 --> 00:17:48.785]  So it's also a shakedown?
[00:17:48.785 --> 00:17:51.447]  You're catching racketeering on tape!
[00:17:51.447 --> 00:17:52.448]  We'll be back!
[00:17:52.448 --> 00:17:55.330]  Oh my goodness!
[00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.691]  We're on the march.
[00:17:56.691 --> 00:17:59.233]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:17:59.233 --> 00:18:01.915]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:18:12.765 --> 00:18:19.389]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:18:19.389 --> 00:18:26.272]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:18:26.272 --> 00:18:29.694]  My friends, I want you to understand the magnitude of this.
[00:18:33.656 --> 00:18:42.645]  In my own life here in Austin, the people running this system have threatened us, tried to keep this information from going on the air.
[00:18:42.645 --> 00:18:50.292]  They've got the local media involved on the board of this, profiting from it.
[00:18:50.292 --> 00:18:55.858]  And then you look at it nationally, they have all these top computer programmers look at just one of the companies
[00:18:57.598 --> 00:19:05.944]  Software and it's designed with secret backdoors and wireless connections and you've got the government and the CIA.
[00:19:05.944 --> 00:19:09.947]  We talked about this months ago when she was on the show, Bev Harris.
[00:19:09.947 --> 00:19:15.932]  All of this and then now you find out that there's a PR campaign to use the Defense Department's money.
[00:19:16.764 --> 00:19:17.004]  I don't know.
[00:19:34.286 --> 00:19:37.109]  Folks, this is so horrible.
[00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:48.082]  Bev Harris, what else came out in the secret meeting that you guys were able to get in on between the lobbyists, the vendors, the military-industrial complex folks?
[00:19:50.991 --> 00:20:03.264]  A good bit of discussion about, well, we want to make sure the media never finds out about this, and I have to say that the folks that we're listing in were having a really hard time not saying anything, because they did sign in under their own name.
[00:20:03.264 --> 00:20:13.855]  What happened is they had everybody sign in and say who they were, but everybody called in at once, and they kind of just, I guess, didn't pay attention, because there was also a reporter from the Beacon Journal in Akron.
[00:20:14.395 --> 00:20:21.637]  Oh, so now it's not just... We kicked off a few people and said, you know, go on in and see what you can hear, and that's exactly what happened.
[00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:32.160]  But, yeah, there was a good bit of conversation about, well, we'd better check in with antitrust regulations and we don't want anyone talking about collusion and things like this.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.321]  Now, understand that any industry can set up a lobbying thing.
[00:20:36.321 --> 00:20:37.701]  There's nothing unusual in that.
[00:20:37.701 --> 00:20:42.303]  And in setting such a thing up, they would certainly want to discuss antitrust issues.
[00:20:44.043 --> 00:20:46.846]  What was very unusual about this is this.
[00:20:46.846 --> 00:20:57.797]  Now, if you're an industry and you're legit and you're setting up a lobbying thing, the groups of people from the industry would get together, they would probably interview a few lobbyist firms.
[00:20:57.797 --> 00:20:59.618]  Now, that's not the case here.
[00:20:59.618 --> 00:21:03.222]  What happened is the lobbying firm shows up and says, we need money by Friday.
[00:21:05.441 --> 00:21:17.064]  And they said, you know, don't want to say the term knife in the back, but, you know, those who are not members, well, if they get into trouble, it looks like they would want to become members.
[00:21:17.064 --> 00:21:20.644]  So, we're watching protection activities.
[00:21:20.644 --> 00:21:22.425]  To me, that's a protection racket.
[00:21:22.425 --> 00:21:25.605]  It's just cloaked in white-collar lingo.
[00:21:25.605 --> 00:21:31.987]  Well, see, that's, you know, I've talked to people in and out of government, and they say corruption has never been at such all-time highs.
[00:21:31.987 --> 00:21:33.147]  It's totally rampant.
[00:21:33.707 --> 00:21:46.173]  And if they get away with taking our elections away and let the CIA run it, I mean, folks are going to lose your Second Amendment, your borders, and they're going to say, well, it's a democracy, you voted for it, didn't you?
[00:21:46.173 --> 00:21:53.156]  That's why they want to get us away from a republic, because even if they control the voting machines, a republic would still have the Bill of Rights.
[00:21:54.216 --> 00:21:55.556]  Not in a pure democracy.
[00:21:55.556 --> 00:22:00.038]  Now, Bev Harris, for those that just joined us, you've got an incredible track record yourself.
[00:22:00.038 --> 00:22:03.439]  Tell us a little bit about Bev Harris, and then let's go back into some more of this.
[00:22:03.439 --> 00:22:06.240]  Well, I don't know why I ended up with this thing, frankly.
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:08.100]  I always thought voting was boring.
[00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.801]  I never wanted to get into this.
[00:22:09.801 --> 00:22:13.382]  I ran a PR agency, but I've been a writer for many years.
[00:22:13.382 --> 00:22:23.505]  And in the course of my writing career, I did a lot of work on financial fraud stuff, and so I had a pretty good idea of how people do shenanigans like this.
[00:22:24.425 --> 00:22:27.528]  But I ran into some stuff last fall.
[00:22:27.528 --> 00:22:28.970]  It hasn't even been quite a year.
[00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:35.075]  But what I ran into showed that there were clear conflicts of interest in the ownership of the voting companies.
[00:22:35.075 --> 00:22:41.942]  And that there were clearly not just dozens, but hundreds of situations where the machines were caught miscounting.
[00:22:42.757 --> 00:22:46.078]  And then we got Senator Hagel to tell them about that.
[00:22:59.663 --> 00:23:01.005]  By the way, the polls showed him way behind.
[00:23:18.983 --> 00:23:22.726]  He still had anomalies in the type of win that he had.
[00:23:22.726 --> 00:23:29.511]  Wait, I've got some of the articles, and last time you were on with us you were going over that, that some of the polls showed Hagel way behind and that it was a big uptick.
[00:23:29.511 --> 00:23:31.393]  Oh, I think that was Cleland that we're talking about.
[00:23:31.393 --> 00:23:33.074]  Yeah, there were some situations like that.
[00:23:33.074 --> 00:23:37.237]  Cleland was ahead in the polls, and that was Georgia.
[00:23:37.237 --> 00:23:44.163]  Georgia had actually six upsets that did not match the polls, and Georgia used all these unauditable touch screens.
[00:23:44.503 --> 00:23:46.628]  Okay, so what happened with Hagel, then we'll go into Georgia.
[00:23:46.628 --> 00:23:48.452]  Yeah, and Hagel, with Hagel, he...
[00:23:49.634 --> 00:23:51.235]  Now he's outspent his opponent.
[00:23:51.235 --> 00:23:53.616]  His opponent, Charlie Matulka, you gotta love him.
[00:23:53.616 --> 00:23:54.856]  He's a construction worker.
[00:23:54.856 --> 00:23:55.817]  He's a feisty guy.
[00:23:55.817 --> 00:24:01.479]  He spent a total of $4,000 on a United States Senate campaign.
[00:24:01.479 --> 00:24:03.900]  And Hagel spent about $3 million.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:04.501]  Okay?
[00:24:04.501 --> 00:24:07.082]  So Hagel outspent him by whatever it was.
[00:24:07.082 --> 00:24:08.762]  $100,000 to one.
[00:24:08.762 --> 00:24:14.185]  And so yes, you know, Matulka figured that Hagel has a bit of an advantage there.
[00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:19.983]  But what was odd was that Hagel won demographic groups that always go Democrat.
[00:24:19.983 --> 00:24:22.405]  He won the black areas of Omaha, you know?
[00:24:22.405 --> 00:24:25.686]  I mean, and it was not really to be expected.
[00:24:25.686 --> 00:24:31.469]  And then he comes forward and he starts bragging on his website that he won with the biggest margin in history.
[00:24:31.469 --> 00:24:35.951]  Well, you know, 85% of his votes were counted by his own machine.
[00:24:35.951 --> 00:24:41.273]  So then his opponent, Charlie Matolka, who's a candidate, you know, he had standing for a recount.
[00:24:43.357 --> 00:24:52.904]  Because the margin wasn't close, he couldn't get an automatic recount funded by the state, but you can get a recount if you're a candidate if you pay for it.
[00:24:52.904 --> 00:24:54.686]  So he said, OK, I'm going to pay for it.
[00:24:54.686 --> 00:25:00.290]  Now let's look at these ballots that my opponent ran through his own machines.
[00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:07.956]  And the state of Nebraska, if you can believe it, said, well, you can pay for the recount, but all we will do is run the ballot through Hagel's machines again.
[00:25:07.956 --> 00:25:09.297]  You can't ever look at the ballot.
[00:25:10.146 --> 00:25:13.847]  We have no provision in the law to let you look at the actual ballots that were used.
[00:25:13.847 --> 00:25:18.869]  Now that was back with the hybrid ballots, where it's an electronic machine, you feed... Right, that's the option.
[00:25:18.869 --> 00:25:22.249]  ...ScanPrime styles, and that's what we've been caught with fraud.
[00:25:22.249 --> 00:25:30.832]  I mean, they've been caught with fraud in Austin with those, and the same people running the fraud have now put in the touchscreens and threatened folks that talk about it.
[00:25:31.272 --> 00:25:32.733]  Yeah, and I'll tell you something.
[00:25:32.733 --> 00:25:38.595]  There's a reason they want these touchscreens so desperately, and that is because I think Florida scared the heck out of them.
[00:25:38.595 --> 00:25:48.798]  While everyone was talking about punch cards, my theory on Florida is the thing that really put fear into these people is the optical scams.
[00:25:48.798 --> 00:25:51.519]  Diebold optical scams counted 40% of Florida in the year 2000.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:26:06.431]  Now, if they had hand-counted every single one of those Diebold optical scans immediately after the election, statewide, I think some things would have come out that would have been impossible to deny.
[00:26:06.431 --> 00:26:09.674]  But we have election after election, Bev Harris, where
[00:26:10.794 --> 00:26:11.054]  I don't
[00:26:25.586 --> 00:26:29.028]  Yeah, the people involved are just wrong.
[00:26:29.028 --> 00:26:37.493]  And then we've got a situation now, now this is kind of how I see things, and this is speculative, so we'll label it.
[00:26:37.493 --> 00:26:39.975]  Dove Harris is speculation, okay?
[00:26:39.975 --> 00:26:41.856]  But here's what I'm seeing it shake down to.
[00:26:42.596 --> 00:26:51.299]  Um, we have the defense industry who was pushing the move toward unauditable voting, toward getting rid of the paper trail.
[00:26:51.299 --> 00:26:54.721]  That we know from the meeting, because they came right out and said it.
[00:26:54.721 --> 00:26:58.122]  And number one, why is the defense department, and in private,
[00:26:58.642 --> 00:27:04.047]  There's a military industrial complex around it that Eisenhower warned us would try to overthrow the country.
[00:27:04.047 --> 00:27:05.288]  Why are they involved?
[00:27:05.288 --> 00:27:06.448]  Why are they involved?
[00:27:06.448 --> 00:27:08.470]  It's a classic conflict of interest.
[00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:12.633]  It's like Guatemala or El Salvador or Russia with the military coup.
[00:27:12.633 --> 00:27:15.496]  Yeah, they have no business in our voting system, period.
[00:27:15.496 --> 00:27:17.918]  And they are definitely involved.
[00:27:17.918 --> 00:27:24.883]  They have been involved through making voting machines, they're involved in the voter registration system, and they're involved in new things now.
[00:27:24.883 --> 00:27:26.785]  Now here's what I see coming down the pipe.
[00:27:27.385 --> 00:27:27.625]  I think?
[00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:48.473]  Oh, and they all just so happen to be designed where it could fit into them!
[00:27:48.473 --> 00:27:48.513]  Oh!
[00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:14.331]  Oh, this is all wonderful!
[00:28:30.589 --> 00:28:31.630]  You see.
[00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:44.478]  And so I think what it's aiming toward is you're going to see a move, and we're doing some pretty good work here to get the right questions asked, so it may be more difficult than they expected.
[00:28:44.478 --> 00:28:51.963]  You're going to see a move, though, to try to switch again and say, OK, well, the voters insist on a voter-verified paper ballot.
[00:28:51.963 --> 00:28:52.343]  You know what?
[00:28:52.343 --> 00:28:53.083]  You don't need that.
[00:28:53.083 --> 00:28:55.405]  You need this bulletproof cryptography system.
[00:28:56.716 --> 00:28:58.477]  And we'll put it inside all the voting machines.
[00:28:58.477 --> 00:29:01.560]  Now guess who is the Director of Vote Here?
[00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:04.102]  Who?
[00:29:04.102 --> 00:29:12.648]  Well, the Chairman of the Board of Directors is also on the Defense Policy Board and he's also the Vice Chairman of the SAIC.
[00:29:12.648 --> 00:29:15.150]  His name is Admiral Bill Owen.
[00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.312]  He's a Cheney crony.
[00:29:17.312 --> 00:29:21.855]  And another Director is Robert Gates, the former CIA Director.
[00:29:23.356 --> 00:29:30.180]  And these are the people who are running Vote Here and have this wonderful cryptography solution, Trust Us.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.261]  Just remember, trust us.
[00:29:32.261 --> 00:29:39.545]  And it will go in these voting machines and be the new gold standard so that we should just trust them and we know we never again need a paper ballot.
[00:29:39.545 --> 00:29:40.285]  Just trust us.
[00:29:42.026 --> 00:30:08.582]  Let me stop, because this is just bombshell after bombshell, and I'm begging the listeners, you know who we are, just like the Catherine Albrecht interview that you did a transcript of, I'm begging you, do the transcript, get it to Paul Watson, we'll get it up on PrisonPlanet.com, up on InfoWars.com, so we don't have to wait four months or three months for this to show up in the mainstream media with a spin on it, and we'll put links, of course, to BlackBoxVoting.com and have all that there for folks, so we can get it out to everybody.
[00:30:09.924 --> 00:30:32.411]  The key here is, Bev, were you aware of the folks over at NoCards, the involved, Catherine Albrecht, she went to the meetings and then they got off one of the websites that had a back door in it, the documents with the RFID tracker chips they want to replace the barcode with, and the secret meeting with Walmart and Procter & Gamble.
[00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:33.631]  Oh, I heard about that, yes.
[00:30:34.051 --> 00:30:43.662]  Yeah, with Homeland Security talking about how to neutralize us, how to neutralize opposition, I mean, and how to get the military-industrial complex involved.
[00:30:43.662 --> 00:30:45.023]  I mean, this is sinister.
[00:30:45.023 --> 00:30:51.771]  This is like The Running Man or something, where you find out TV's fake and everything, you know, pulling the curtain back.
[00:30:51.771 --> 00:30:53.933]  I mean, this is so huge, ma'am.
[00:30:54.273 --> 00:31:00.177]  And it's like, I agree, people want to say, oh, you guys, you're just crazy and stuff.
[00:31:00.177 --> 00:31:08.121]  And look, I had no idea, frankly, when my publisher went into this meeting, I had no idea about this.
[00:31:08.121 --> 00:31:15.846]  I knew that there was a Vote Here situation and that there was defense people involved in that, but I couldn't quite figure out what Vote Here did until this meeting.
[00:31:16.486 --> 00:31:29.092]  But when we heard, and they were, I'm telling you, there was like two paragraphs of conversation about the defense industry and how it had pushed HAVA bill through and how maybe they could come in and help us now.
[00:31:29.092 --> 00:31:34.194]  By the way, there's two websites with this, but blackboxvoting.com does have the transcript on it.
[00:31:34.995 --> 00:31:36.236]  Absolutely.
[00:31:36.236 --> 00:31:43.303]  It's not a complete transcript and it does have my publisher's fairly opinionated notes along with it.
[00:31:43.303 --> 00:31:44.104]  It also has a document on it.
[00:31:44.104 --> 00:31:44.584]  This is so huge.
[00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:53.674]  We've already caught them that the voting machines were a fraud.
[00:31:53.674 --> 00:31:57.797]  We've got the League of Women Voters saying we don't want a paper ballot or a record.
[00:31:57.797 --> 00:32:02.482]  We've got all this other police state stuff going on.
[00:32:02.482 --> 00:32:12.511]  And then you guys get into one of these little secret meetings and you've got the plain dealer Cleveland newspaper person hearing all this.
[00:32:12.511 --> 00:32:13.732]  This is on the record.
[00:32:13.732 --> 00:32:15.454]  This is huge!
[00:32:16.818 --> 00:32:21.741]  I mean, I don't even have words to articulate how evil this is.
[00:32:21.741 --> 00:32:26.163]  This is people... I call it a business plan.
[00:32:26.163 --> 00:32:28.505]  You see people that say, are you a conspiracy theorist?
[00:32:28.505 --> 00:32:29.245]  What do you think of this?
[00:32:29.245 --> 00:32:31.626]  I say, look, this is a business plan.
[00:32:31.626 --> 00:32:35.889]  If you come right down to it, it's a bunch of guys that want
[00:32:36.627 --> 00:32:37.127]  I think so.
[00:32:57.193 --> 00:32:57.273]  Yes.
[00:33:15.109 --> 00:33:18.253]  Okay, it's making sense now.
[00:33:18.253 --> 00:33:23.440]  And by the way, defense contractors tend to make an awful lot of money if the vote goes their way.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.764]  We've spent, what, a trillion dollars in the last three years?
[00:33:26.764 --> 00:33:29.407]  Yeah, but I don't want to stop you.
[00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:30.529]  They control the government.
[00:33:30.809 --> 00:33:47.934]  The government's going to give them more awards for more weapons, but also the private defense contractors are getting into private prisons, Homeland Security security operations, the face scanning cameras, the biometrics, all of it, the RFIDs.
[00:33:47.934 --> 00:33:50.595]  I mean, they're going to build a giant prison for us.
[00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:52.256]  They're taking over the voting.
[00:33:52.256 --> 00:33:56.237]  This is a late night science fiction horror movie from the 1980s.
[00:33:56.237 --> 00:33:59.498]  You know, the one thing we have going for us is that
[00:34:00.058 --> 00:34:09.643]  When you have all that data and they crunch all those things, eventually it comes down to a human who has to go to his boss and say, I think we should look into so-and-so.
[00:34:09.643 --> 00:34:15.386]  Now this is a very bad thing because we can assume they're going to look into a lot of people that are very inappropriate, but...
[00:34:16.229 --> 00:34:20.354]  In the bottom line is, some human has to eventually look at all that data.
[00:34:20.354 --> 00:34:22.917]  So it's extremely inappropriate that they're collecting it.
[00:34:22.917 --> 00:34:36.512]  But I have to say, I sometimes kind of smile and think, what in the world do they think people... I mean, at some point, it's like if you do surveillance on all these people, I can tell you, if they were doing surveillance on the six telephone lines that I have in my office and house,
[00:34:37.112 --> 00:34:42.094]  They would have to listen to five teenagers discussing their boyfriends and their nails.
[00:34:42.094 --> 00:34:52.279]  At some point, some poor schmo is going to have to actually go through all this stuff and decide what's important.
[00:34:52.279 --> 00:34:54.300]  I think that may be the thing that saves us.
[00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.601]  At some point, because they won't get the... Well, no, it's true.
[00:34:56.601 --> 00:35:02.045]  The reason they're announcing Echelon is watching us and you don't have any rights is a chilling effect.
[00:35:02.045 --> 00:35:05.367]  They don't have the personnel, even with the computers, to do anything with this.
[00:35:05.367 --> 00:35:11.571]  We're on the march, they're on the run, but... So they'll get a couple of key people that they can use as a public example.
[00:35:11.571 --> 00:35:15.393]  But, Bev, they're still putting in the systems no matter how much fraud comes out.
[00:35:15.393 --> 00:35:16.094]  How do we stop them?
[00:35:16.718 --> 00:35:25.145]  Well, it's getting to the point where we need to... I'm saying we are at Boston Tea Party stage, okay?
[00:35:25.145 --> 00:35:37.034]  This is really sad because we are getting quite a few little emails putting us on notice that are looking into it, putting us into legal jeopardy.
[00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:39.696]  And I look at that as the Boston Tea Party.
[00:35:39.696 --> 00:35:41.137]  I will break one more thing here.
[00:35:41.137 --> 00:35:43.239]  Stay there one more moment, Bev.
[00:35:43.239 --> 00:35:44.099]  We're so honored to have you.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:51.023]  So, see, this woman, this investigator who exposes corruption, you know, mainstream.
[00:35:51.023 --> 00:35:52.704]  I've got major newspapers involved.
[00:35:52.704 --> 00:35:53.584]  She gets the emails.
[00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:55.985]  You better stop looking into that.
[00:35:55.985 --> 00:35:57.906]  How about we all join her in looking into it?
[00:35:57.906 --> 00:35:59.527]  How about we all join her in this fight?
[00:35:59.527 --> 00:36:03.129]  How about we stand up to this evil, folks?
[00:36:03.129 --> 00:36:06.730]  We'll go one layer deeper down the rabbit hole when we get by.
[00:36:33.186 --> 00:36:46.250]  Folks, they're reporting in the Drugs Report, the London Guardian, the Associated Press, that the levels of radiation are 1,900 times safe levels in Baghdad from our own government when it's spread on our troops and the people.
[00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:47.470]  But again, it's the back of the paper.
[00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:48.970]  Nobody even will ever hear about it.
[00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:50.631]  Same thing with them taking your right to vote.
[00:36:50.631 --> 00:36:51.771]  I mean, they're taking it!
[00:36:51.771 --> 00:36:55.752]  The CIA runs these companies, folks, every time we investigate it.
[00:36:55.752 --> 00:36:58.313]  Mainstream news, but it never makes it out naturally.
[00:36:58.985 --> 00:37:02.647]  And I've been hyperventilating for the last 50-something minutes, and I'm sorry we don't have time to take calls.
[00:37:02.647 --> 00:37:04.489]  It's our last few minutes here with Bev Harris.
[00:37:04.489 --> 00:37:05.950]  We've got to get her back up.
[00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:06.890]  An amazing lady.
[00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.871]  There's a lot of other great investigators.
[00:37:08.871 --> 00:37:10.472]  This stuff is confirmed.
[00:37:10.472 --> 00:37:15.155]  Bev Harris, you said one more major issue you were going to break.
[00:37:15.155 --> 00:37:16.296]  Well, yeah.
[00:37:16.296 --> 00:37:18.517]  We were talking about the Boston Tea Party.
[00:37:18.517 --> 00:37:20.699]  Look, if all of us
[00:37:21.221 --> 00:37:25.823]  are out there actively doing what we need to do to look into this issue.
[00:37:25.823 --> 00:37:28.744]  It's pretty hard for them to take it all down.
[00:37:28.744 --> 00:37:30.585]  So, there's safety in numbers.
[00:37:30.585 --> 00:37:39.248]  Now, there are many people doing things that are completely unrelated to me, but I want to tell you about one such guy in California.
[00:37:39.248 --> 00:37:44.810]  He's my new hero, and Alex, if you like, I can send you the link when it pops up.
[00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:47.472]  It will be, I understand, in the next couple of days.
[00:37:47.472 --> 00:37:48.432]  Okay, tell us about it.
[00:37:49.019 --> 00:37:50.941]  There's going to be a link that he posts.
[00:37:50.941 --> 00:37:55.426]  He's going to post the rig-a-vote kit, which is using actual files from Diebold.
[00:37:55.426 --> 00:38:04.337]  What he has been doing is put it on a CD, he's taking it around and visiting his newspaper officer's editors and saying, let me put this on your computer, we're going to walk through this together.
[00:38:04.337 --> 00:38:06.119]  I'll show you how to rig your own election.
[00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:10.913]  And now this is not designed to show people how to rig elections.
[00:38:10.913 --> 00:38:15.056]  It's designed to show newspaper editors the back doors into this system.
[00:38:15.056 --> 00:38:18.379]  He says he is routinely picking up jaws off the floor.
[00:38:18.379 --> 00:38:20.120]  They cannot believe what they're seeing.
[00:38:22.161 --> 00:38:25.845]  Well, it's simple.
[00:38:25.845 --> 00:38:37.455]  For those who don't know what's been in the news, they will have where one of every three votes for a certain individual just goes into a black hole file that isn't counted.
[00:38:43.207 --> 00:38:45.828]  And it's just so appalling when you see it.
[00:38:45.828 --> 00:38:47.489]  Yeah, give us that website address.
[00:38:47.489 --> 00:38:49.189]  Well, I will have to send that to you.
[00:38:49.189 --> 00:38:50.850]  It's going up within the next two days.
[00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.871]  I'm telling you what's going to happen here.
[00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:54.731]  And so, that will be coming.
[00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:58.893]  Now, one of the things he found, though, was he found an actual, he found a smoking gun.
[00:38:58.893 --> 00:39:08.176]  He found an actual file of actual votes for San Luis Obispo County, California, that is, let's just say, a problem.
[00:39:08.849 --> 00:39:11.050]  Now, you know what they're supposed to do.
[00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:16.131]  All the precincts vote, they close down the polls, they tally up the precincts.
[00:39:16.131 --> 00:39:26.055]  Somebody explain why there's a file that was left on the Debold FTT site where they tallied up the votes from all 51 precincts in that county at 3.31 in the afternoon.
[00:39:27.655 --> 00:39:38.920]  And it can only have been done via wireless electronic means because otherwise they would have had to shut down all 51 polling places and plug in a modem.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:40.000]  That didn't happen.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.042]  And why did that end up with a password that's the name of a Diebold employee?
[00:39:44.722 --> 00:39:46.944]  And end up on a public FTP site.
[00:39:46.944 --> 00:39:48.566]  When they're not supposed to be involved.
[00:39:48.566 --> 00:39:49.947]  They're so sloppy.
[00:39:49.947 --> 00:39:52.469]  This is in the middle of an election, folks.
[00:39:52.469 --> 00:39:52.710]  Folks.
[00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.732]  You are tallying up 51 tracing.
[00:39:55.732 --> 00:39:57.274]  Mev Harris, God bless you.
[00:39:57.274 --> 00:39:58.515]  We've got to get you back on.
[00:39:58.515 --> 00:39:59.416]  You're an amazing lady.
[00:39:59.416 --> 00:40:02.238]  Blackboxvoting.com.
[00:40:02.238 --> 00:40:03.039]  You're amazing.
[00:40:03.039 --> 00:40:04.460]  Can we get you back up soon?
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.101]  Absolutely.
[00:40:05.101 --> 00:40:05.701]  You're awesome.
[00:40:05.701 --> 00:40:06.402]  Take care.
[00:40:06.402 --> 00:40:07.243]  Okay, thank you much.
[00:40:07.783 --> 00:40:15.305]  Wow, folks, the CIA, the military industrial complex, the media, I mean, are you starting to get how bad stuff is?
[00:40:15.305 --> 00:40:16.625]  Come on, save America!
[00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:18.066]  Don't let them kill America!
[00:40:18.066 --> 00:40:20.166]  Let me tell you something, they're going to ban your guns, folks.
[00:40:20.166 --> 00:40:24.827]  They're getting rid of the borders, they're going to legalize all illegals, and they're going to say, you voted for it!
[00:40:24.827 --> 00:40:27.608]  We're a democracy!
[00:40:27.608 --> 00:40:30.348]  Folks, if you believe in this broadcast, tell your friends and family about it.

[00:40:44.398 --> 00:40:46.679]  We're in the middle of a dictatorship being set up!
[00:40:46.679 --> 00:40:49.360]  We're in an emergency situation!
