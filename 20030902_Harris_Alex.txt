[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000]  Monday through Friday, from 11 to 2 Central, on the night from 9 to midnight, I do this show.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  We go out on the AM and FM dial, from coast to coast. We samplecast on shortwave during the day at 12.172 and 9320,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]  and then night from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 6890.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.000]  We chronicle the criminal activities of the global elite and their crime syndicates, their allied crime syndicates as well.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  And coming up before the show ends today, regulating vitamins. This is from the Washington Times.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  There's a new bill. They tried it in 93. Clinton tried it.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  It will ban over-the-counter sales of all vitamins, folks. It will make the FDA control it.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]  A big pharma wants this. You have to buy vitamin C from them.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]  This is the same folks that tell you radiating meat for school children is good.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]  They'll tell you about the bill. It's S722. It has a good chance of passing.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  Just a lot more, some other serious issues coming up.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]  This is the same government that says 1900 times the so-called safe level of DU for our troops to breathe is good,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  but they want you to not be able to buy that vitamin C.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]  And by the way, Europe's already done this, by the way. So whatever happens there then happens here.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000]  And everything that's happening destroys liberty and freedom, destroys our constitutional republic.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000]  This is out of The Plain Dealer, Cleveland's big newspaper, voting machine controversy.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000]  Columbus, the head of a company vying to sell voting machines in Ohio, told Republicans in a fundraising letter
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]  that he is committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.000]  The August 14th letter from Walden O'Dell, chief executive of Diebold, Inc., who has become active in re-election effort, President Bush,
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  prompted Democrats this week to question the proprietary of allowing O'Dell company to calculate votes in the 2004 presidential election.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:18.000]  O'Dell, it goes on, attended a strategy powwow with wealthy Bush benefactors known as the Rangers and Pioneers.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  And it goes on and on. Now, we had Bev on a few months ago. She said she was making the major news because she's a lady who's been hired by Fortune 500 companies
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  to expose corporate corruption in their own systems. They found Diebold and other big companies.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  They looked at the source code of Diebold and others. This has been in everything.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  Denver Post, Associated Press, Reuters, all over that these things are designed for fraud.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  You've got electronic access, wireless internet hooked into them, weird tabulation systems.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]  I mean, it's designed with fraud in mind with no paper trail.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  And then you've got Senator Hagel involved in owning the company out in Nebraska that's being put in everywhere.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]  I mean, it's scary. But again, they count on us not being able to face the horror of this.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  Now, Bev Harris, we're so honored to have you on, blackfoxvoting.com and org.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]  Last time you were on, you were breaking all this. Weeks later, what you had broken came out all over the news.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.000]  Give us a nutshell of what we're facing and what this new article means with this O'Dell, with the company. There's so much.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  Well, we have a lot to break. It's interesting, isn't it, how we break something and three or four months later the news actually catches up to it.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  That tells you a lot about what's happening with the media in our country.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  But I will take my hat off to the Cleveland Plain dealer. They are unafraid and they are out there covering this and so is the Akron Beacon Journal.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000]  There are very few media outlets that are actually going out and doing real investigative work.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  This should be top story. They should all be ripped out everywhere.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]  You bet. And AP Wire, by the way, is picking up this stuff.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  But what is really a problem is now usually when the AP Wire service picks it up, it gets into 50 to 200 newspapers.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000]  But the main newspapers are blacking out the AP Wire stories on this stuff. So we've got some press that are doing their job.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  Or they take it down and say, there's been a few problems. Don't worry. The feds are going to fix you.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  No, no. This is really interesting. But yeah, we've got stuff to break.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000]  And I guess what we'll do is we'll break it here and then people can watch for it in the news in the next few months as they have been.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]  All right. Honored to have you. Go ahead.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  Yeah, one of the things that I found absolutely stunning was, of course,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:48.000]  well, we've known that the Diebold executives have been major, major political folks behind the Bush administration.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]  It's not just Wally O'Dell. It's also W.H. Timkin, who is another director from Diebold.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  Now, understand that Bush has only about 100 pioneers.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000]  The Bush pioneers are the group that kind of meets behind the scenes
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]  and are the powerhouse political strategist and fundraiser for George W. Bush.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  Two of the 100 Bush pioneers run Diebold.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]  I mean, think about that. That's really unusual, isn't it?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  So W.H. Timkin is a Bush pioneer, and Wally O'Dell is.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000]  And not only did he promise to deliver the votes, which is amazing. He did so in writing.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  He promised to deliver the votes to Bush, even though he runs the voting machine company.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  He visited President Bush at the Crawford Ranch in August, in early August.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]  He was down there with a group of other Bush pioneers strategizing on how to win the election.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]  Now, how inappropriate is this?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  Now, by the way, for those that don't know, last time you were on a few months ago,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  and now it's broken, I mean, Baltimore Sun, you name it, Austin American Statesman,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]  everything you said here on the show, that it's got wireless connections with the boxes.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]  They didn't tell anybody about these three different levels of codes.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]  The hundreds of top programmers looked at it to agree with your programmers' information,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]  that these things are designed for backdoor access.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000]  And then the League of Women Voters is out campaigning that the government pass a law
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]  that we not be allowed to have a paper ballot. I mean, this is crazy.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]  Well, exactly. And here's what's happened.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000]  They've gone after, what they did was they went after a few of the organizations,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]  but they went at them from the top down, and they do not represent, by the way,
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]  what their own constituency says.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]  Because we've been in contact with many of the League of Women Voters local chapters,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  and they're furious about this.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]  They're saying, no, we want a paper ballot. We are not throwing away the evidence.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]  And what's happened is I believe what we need to do now is start looking at the contributions
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000]  to these organizations, because I'll betcha that they went to the head of the League of Women Voters
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]  and to a couple other organizations and made hefty contributions.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  I also just found out today, now we are starting to get into the civil rights community with this,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  and they're implying that the civil rights community is behind this no-paper-trail voting.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  Well, that is a lie.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  What they're doing is they're quoting this leadership conference on civil rights,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  which, by the way, has backed away from that position and is not even saying now that they are against the paper trail.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]  But the voting vendors got to them, got a statement out of them.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  But when we looked at the constituency of the Leadership Conference of Civil Rights,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000]  the people who were jumping in were not the people of color.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]  They were not the NAACP. They were not the black churches.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]  They were the League of Women Voters, who happens to be a member,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  and a couple of labor unions.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  For folks that are missing what you're saying, Bev, is the establishment of the three voting machine companies,
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  all CIA, government-senator connections, I mean, just unbelievable,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000]  with all the code source and all this corruption going on that these are designed for this,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000]  they claim, oh, yeah, well, the minorities want it, so you're against it, which is just their classic tactic.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]  But I would also add to this that only in a few cases have we seen attempts at censorship of this show and others.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]  And when they were putting in electronic touchscreens last year, and we confronted them and exposed it,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:21.000]  we had actual threats, phone calls, attempts at censorship on this issue by, quote,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  members of the media here in Austin that are steering this and that were steering this into place.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]  So this is very important to them because they know this means total control and domination.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  No more voting, folks.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:41.000]  And I will tell you this, I have had six, count them, six investigative reporters for huge news outlets
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  who have called me and privately told me that they have been lobbying to cover this story,
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]  and they have been told by their management that they are not to cover it.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  And these are major organizations.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  Folks, do you hear what we're saying?
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  Major papers have had to admit, they just calmly go, yeah, these things are built for fraud,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]  totally designed, owned by the government and weird shadowy grips, and your vote doesn't count, ha, ha, ha.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]  And now on top of it, six major investigative journalists call you and say, I'm not allowed to report on this.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]  Right, and it's so funny because they'll say, please keep sending me this stuff,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]  and I wish I could break it because there's something to break.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  I could get a suitor out of this.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000]  And they're like, but I'm not, every time I put my proposal forward, it's not getting taken up on.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]  And you would be stunned.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000]  I mean, some of these are international publications, and they're just, it's just amazing.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  Some of them are major, you know, people ask about the major TV investigative magazine shows.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]  I can tell you they've been in touch with me.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]  I can also tell you that it's been killed.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  The story's been killed.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  And it's not their producers that are killing it.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]  It's getting killed at management level.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  And right here in Austin, Deb Harris, Janet DuBois, the county clerk, she got caught in 98 with the paper ballots,
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  double-counting ballot boxes, breaking safety seals, falsifying signatures.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  That was in the paper, but the state board said it was, quote, an accident.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]  In the middle of the night at 2 a.m., her good friend that was losing suddenly was winning.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]  This all comes out, and now she's the one pushing the touch screens.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  Of course.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000]  I mean, it's just, I don't know what to say about it anymore.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  You know, but I've got a much bigger way to go with this, if and when you're ready.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]  Do it right now.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  Okay.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  Well, we were able to get into a private teleconference.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  There was a conference that was held by teleconference in Houston.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]  It was run by the Election Center and the Voting Machine Manufacturers.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]  It was supposed to be a secret.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]  My publisher, David Allen, from Black Box Voting, he runs Plan 9 Publishing.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  He managed to get into this, and it was actually quite funny,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]  because they had all this supposed security around their teleconference.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000]  But he actually dialed in, and he signed in with his own name, and no one asked him who he was.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  So he sat there and transcribed this meeting.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000]  And this meeting, which was between, understand, there was an insider meeting.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000]  What they were discussing, among other things, was,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]  can Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, defense contractors, you know,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  can they help us with our PR problem now, like they helped get the HAVA bill through?
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  The HAVA bill is the bill that requires that we buy all these new touchscreen machines.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]  I've got to stop you.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]  Think about what they just said.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  This is insiders saying and admitting that the defense industry was behind getting this bill through.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  I've got to stop you, Ben Harris.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  This is massive.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]  Folks, this is so huge.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  I'll tell you why when we get back.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  If you haven't figured it out yet, do you know who's putting up the red light cameras?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  Lockheed Martin.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  Who puts on the ads about thumb scanning for biometrics?
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]  Lockheed Martin.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]  They're in a meeting, the biometrics, the RFIDs.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]  Remember the meeting with Ridge?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  We'll be right back.
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:14.940]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM radio network.
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:26.220]  Investigator Bev Harris just dropped a major bombshell on us. The news she reported here a
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:31.740]  few months ago is now a top story in a lot of big newspapers but they never made it onto the nightly
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:39.740]  television news where most people get their propaganda. We talked to the head of Caspian,
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.820]  the group that exposes the whole cashless society and what's happening with the tracking there about
[00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:51.100]  the secret meetings with the biometric consortium, the RFID consortium with Governor Ridge of quote
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:56.620]  making us take it the name of fighting terrorism. We know that Lockheed Martin and others are
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:05.420]  involved in funding domestic propaganda operations. Folks, this is military coup. This is Russia. This
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:13.580]  is China. This is so big. You're telling me the military industrial complex that in this
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:21.820]  discussion group, this closed secret conference that you guys got into, Bev Harris, that they
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:28.940]  were discussing using the military industrial complex to smash opposition to this. Please tell
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.140]  us. Please give us the details. Yes, what happened is they set up, okay, well as we all know we've
[00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.940]  been getting a lot of press for the problems and part of that comes from, well all of it comes from
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:45.340]  the fact that we were able to find the cash of Diebold files, the Diebold voting machine files,
[00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:52.540]  40,000 files they left on a website. We were able to analyze those and find how incredibly flawed
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:57.980]  they were and that indeed they do appear to be set up just specifically to allow backdoor
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:03.580]  entrance into manipulating the vote. Well that's made the papers and of course now the industry
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:07.900]  has kind of a black eye and they're trying to think of any way they can to get out of
[00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:13.180]  offering a paper trail. A paper trail, voter verified ballots, that just means you look at
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.100]  the ballot and it's kept in a ballot box like we've been doing since the beginning of time
[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:24.060]  and it's evidence. Okay, they want to get rid of the evidence. So the industry had a meeting to
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:30.300]  figure out what to do about this PR fiasco. In the meeting, it was set up by the way very
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:35.900]  inappropriately by the election center which is supposed to represent the voters and the people,
[00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:43.180]  set up a meeting with a lobbyist and the vendor to deal with this PR problem. The lobbyist that
[00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:49.500]  was running the meeting was the ITAA. It's a series of initials that stands for a bunch of things.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:57.500]  Suffice it to say it's very tightly connected to another bunch of initials SAIC which is a big
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:05.660]  Pentagon contractor. Now this is just so bizarre. Let me draw this loop for you and I'm sorry to
[00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.340]  have to come up with things with initials but the military likes to do things with initials.
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:17.180]  You have Diebold. Diebold's software is exposed to be flawed. They then get the state of Maryland
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:23.180]  and the state of Ohio to request a supposed independent investigation of Diebold's security.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:30.140]  They commission a group called SAIC to do the supposedly independent evaluation of Diebold
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:37.180]  voting machine security. The SAIC is mainly a Pentagon contractor. It's sort of like a mercenary
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:43.340]  version of the CIA in much of what it does. It has about... It's like a corrupt five-time convicted
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:50.460]  felon who is the informant who they then call in to testify against you in court and you can't
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.940]  bring up the fact that he that it's a convicted felon with charges against him and they don't
[00:15:54.940 --> 00:16:00.380]  testify they're going to jail. So it's some government owned and run quasi-public private
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:05.980]  group. Oh it's a private group that does public... It does the CIA like stuff. It does surveillance
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.460]  and it does all kinds of things like that. Oh what a nice group to tell when Diebold is good.
[00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:16.460]  Yeah it's basically a mercenary CIA that does other things too but their job is to come up
[00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:24.700]  with the report on Diebold except their senior vice president is the director for the IPAA which
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.980]  is in there saying they're going to lobby to whitewash this whole thing. I understand what I'm
[00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:36.380]  saying. The supposedly independent Pentagon contractor who's supposed to do the independent
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:44.540]  evaluation of Diebold security. They're tied to the lobbying group that is promising to whitewash
[00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:51.740]  this thing. Now how inappropriate is that? So did you record? I mean why just do a transcript?
[00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.060]  I will tell you there is evidence okay and there's also three witnesses that will testify
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:00.700]  because it wasn't just us that was in this meeting. And obviously with some of the state laws some
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:04.380]  states you can't record something in a phone conversation. It is legal in some states and so...
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.020]  Let's just say we've got transcripts of three witnesses and yeah there's some tapes but oh
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:15.020]  maybe not. Well it depends on the state and so we'll have to you know go through that but yeah
[00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:19.420]  absolutely let me put it this way. How long did this whole thing go on with the government and
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.180]  the vendor and the lobbyist and oh we'll just get the defense department and then...
[00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:28.060]  It's crazy I mean you have the same tie you have the same group that's doing the independent
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:33.180]  investigation tied to the group that's supposed to do the whitewash. And Vic and get this now
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:39.900]  this was on Friday August 22nd. What a shakedown. They tell the vendors they've got seven days to
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:45.740]  come up with two hundred thousand dollars and if they don't participate they may not be protected.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:53.020]  So it's also a shakedown. You're catching racketeering on tape. We'll be back oh my goodness.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:05.100]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:12.360]  My friends, I want you to understand the magnitude of this. In my own life, I have
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:41.479]  here in Austin, the people running this system have threatened us, tried to keep this information
[00:18:41.479 --> 00:18:47.000]  from going on the air. They've got the local media involved on the board of this, profiting
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.439]  from it. And then you look at it nationally, they have all these top computer programmers
[00:18:53.439 --> 00:19:00.439]  look at just one of the companies' software, and it's designed with secret back doors and
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.919]  wireless connections, and you've got the government and the CIA. We talked about this months ago
[00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:13.120]  when she was on the show, Bev Harris. All of this, and then now you find out that there's
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.639]  a PR campaign to use the Defense Department's money and the private defense contractor's
[00:19:18.639 --> 00:19:24.120]  money to lobby and propagandize to suppress the people and the media that is starting
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:29.159]  to learn of this. And they're counting on you going, oh, Martha, they'd never steal
[00:19:29.239 --> 00:19:35.280]  the election. They'd never, they'd never have a fraud set up like that. Folks, this is so
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.280]  horrible. Bev Harris, what else came out in this secret meeting that you guys were able
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:47.280]  to get in on between the lobbyists, the vendors, the military industrial complex folks?
[00:19:50.879 --> 00:19:54.719]  A good bit of discussion about, well, we want to make sure the media never finds out about
[00:19:54.719 --> 00:19:58.080]  this. And I have to say that the folks that we're listening in, we're having a really
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.280]  hard time not saying anything because they signed, they did sign in under their own name.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.760]  What happened is they had everybody sign in and say who they were, but everybody called
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.639]  in at once and they kind of just, I guess, didn't pay attention because there was also
[00:20:11.639 --> 00:20:13.760]  a reporter from the Beacon Journal in Akron.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.320]  Oh, so now it's not just...
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.239]  We kicked off a few people and said, you know, go on in and see what you can hear. And that's
[00:20:20.239 --> 00:20:24.919]  exactly what happened. But yeah, there was a good bit of conversation about, well, we'd
[00:20:24.919 --> 00:20:29.800]  better check in with antitrust regulations and we don't want anyone talking about collusion
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:36.379]  and things like this. Now, understand that any industry can set up a lobbying thing.
[00:20:36.379 --> 00:20:39.939]  There's nothing unusual in that. And in setting such a thing up, they would certainly want
[00:20:39.939 --> 00:20:46.939]  to discuss antitrust issues. What was very unusual about this is this. Now, if you're
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:53.320]  an industry and you're legit and you're setting up a lobbying thing, the group of people from
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:58.280]  the industry would get together. They would probably interview a few lobbyist firms. Now,
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:02.120]  that's not the case here. What happened is the lobbying firm shows up and says, we need
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:09.120]  money by Friday. And they said, you know, don't want to say the term knife in the back,
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:14.560]  but you know, those who are not members, well, if they get into trouble, it looks like they
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.040]  would want to become members.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.239]  So we're watching protection activities.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.080]  To me, that's a protection racket. It's just clothed in white collar lingo.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.000]  Well, see, that's, you know, I've talked to people in and out of government and they say
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.159]  corruption has never been at such all time highs. It's totally rampant. And if they get
[00:21:34.159 --> 00:21:38.560]  away with taking our elections away and let the CIA run it, I mean, I mean, folks are
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.919]  going to lose your second amendment, your borders, and they're going to say, they're
[00:21:41.919 --> 00:21:46.480]  going to say, well, it's a democracy. You voted for it, didn't you? That's why they
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.959]  want to get us away from a Republic because even if they control the voting machines,
[00:21:50.959 --> 00:21:56.639]  a Republic would still have the bill of rights, not in a pure democracy. Now Bev Harris, for
[00:21:56.639 --> 00:22:00.560]  those that just joined us, you've got an incredible track record yourself. Tell us a little bit
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.280]  about Bev Harris and then let's go back into some more of this.
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.080]  Well, I don't know why I ended up with this thing. Frankly, I always thought voting was
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.879]  boring. I never wanted to get into this. I ran a PR agency, but I've been a writer for
[00:22:11.879 --> 00:22:18.480]  many years. And in the course of my writing career, I did a lot of work on financial fraud
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.600]  stuff. And so I had a pretty good idea of how people do shenanigans like this. But I
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:30.600]  ran into some stuff last fall. It hasn't even been quite a year, but what I ran into showed
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.120]  that there were clear conflicts of interest in the ownership of the voting companies and
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:40.600]  that there were clearly not just dozens, but hundreds of situations where the machines
[00:22:40.679 --> 00:22:45.439]  were caught miscounting. And then we got Senator Hagel to tell about that.
[00:22:45.439 --> 00:22:49.159]  That was one of the first things that clued me in. It was like, my gosh, you have a guy,
[00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:53.520]  at that time it was in October and he was running for office. He had an election in
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:57.800]  a month and he's running for office and he's got ownership. And his campaign finance director
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:03.239]  was the main owner of the company that's counting all his votes. And it was not disclosed on
[00:23:03.239 --> 00:23:07.280]  his disclosure documents. And so I thought, well, we've got a problem.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:12.960]  And by the way, the polls, we have the articles showed him way behind.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:19.960]  Well, not Hagel. Now Hagel was ahead in the polls, but he still had anomalies in the type
[00:23:21.919 --> 00:23:22.600]  of win that he did.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.199]  Well, wait, I've got some of the articles. And last time you were on with us, you were
[00:23:25.199 --> 00:23:29.320]  going over that, that some of the polls showed Hagel way behind and that it was a big upstep.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.560]  Oh, I think that was Cleveland that we're talking about. Yeah, there were some situations
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:38.000]  like that. Cleveland was ahead in the polls and that was Georgia. Georgia had actually
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000]  six upsets that did not match the polls. And Georgia used all these unauditable touchscreens.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]  Okay. So what happened with Hagel? Then we'll go into Georgia.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]  Yeah. And with Hagel, now he outspent his opponent. His opponent, Charlie Matoga, you
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.800]  got to love him. He's a construction worker. He's a feisty guy. He spent a total of $4,000
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:04.800]  on a United States Senate campaign and Hagel spent about $3 million. Okay. So Hagel outspent
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:12.320]  him by whatever it was, $100,000 to one. And so, yes, Matoga figured that Hagel has a bit
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:19.120]  of an advantage there. But what was odd was that Hagel won demographic groups that always
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:25.719]  go Democrat. He won the black areas of Omaha. I mean, and it was not really to be expected.
[00:24:25.719 --> 00:24:29.520]  And then he comes forward and he starts bragging on his website that he won with the biggest
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:35.520]  margin in history. Well, you know, 85% of his votes were counted by his own machine.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:42.159]  So then his opponent, Charlie Matoga, who's a candidate, he had standing for a recount.
[00:24:42.159 --> 00:24:49.159]  And because the margin wasn't close, he couldn't get an automatic recount funded by the state.
[00:24:49.439 --> 00:24:53.919]  But you can get a recount if you're a candidate if you pay for it. So he said, okay, I'm going
[00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:59.080]  to pay for it. Now let's look at these ballots that my opponent had from, ran through his
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:03.239]  own machine. And the state of Nebraska, if you can believe it said, well, you can pay
[00:25:03.239 --> 00:25:07.939]  for the recount, but all we will do is run the ballot through Hagel's machines again.
[00:25:07.939 --> 00:25:12.320]  You can't ever look at the ballot. We have no provision in the law to let you look at
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:15.800]  the actual ballots that were used. Now that was back with the hybrid ballots where it's
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:21.600]  an electronic machine you feed. Right. That's the option. And that's what we've been caught
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.280]  with fraud. I mean, they've been caught with fraud in Austin with those and the same people
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:31.000]  running the fraud have now put in the touchscreens and threatened folks that talk about it.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.759]  Yeah. And I'll tell you something. There's a reason they want these touchscreens so desperately.
[00:25:35.759 --> 00:25:39.520]  And that is because I think Florida scared the heck out of them. While everyone was talking
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:45.719]  about punch cards, my theory on Florida is the really, the thing that really puts fear
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.320]  into these people is the optical scams. Diebold optical scams counted 40% of Florida in the
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:59.239]  year 2000. Now, if they had hand counted every single one of those Diebold optical scams
[00:25:59.239 --> 00:26:04.480]  immediately after the election statewide, I think some things would have come out that
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.360]  would have been impossible to deny.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:12.679]  Well, we have election after election, Bev Harris, where voter news services would tell
[00:26:12.719 --> 00:26:17.280]  us who would won. And the next day we found out a whole state went different than what
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:23.919]  they said. And you always, again, have these weird CIA companies and senators and people
[00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:26.120]  involved and all of this happening.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:32.719]  Yeah, the people involved are just wrong. And then we've got a situation now. Now, this
[00:26:32.719 --> 00:26:39.239]  is kind of how I see things and this is speculative. So we'll label it. Bev Harris is speculation.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:46.440]  But here's what I'm seeing at Shakedown 2. We have the defense industry who was pushing
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:51.679]  the move toward unauditable voting, toward getting rid of the paper trail. That we know
[00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:54.679]  from the meeting because they came right out and said it.
[00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:59.879]  And number one, why is the Defense Department and then private military industrial complex
[00:26:59.879 --> 00:27:04.879]  around it that Eisenhower warns would try to overthrow the country, why are they involved?
[00:27:04.879 --> 00:27:08.639]  Why are they involved? It's a classic conflict of interest.
[00:27:08.639 --> 00:27:12.279]  Just like Guatemala or El Salvador or Russia with the military coup.
[00:27:12.279 --> 00:27:17.879]  Yeah, they have no business in our voting system, period. And they are definitely involved.
[00:27:17.879 --> 00:27:21.800]  They have been involved through making voting machines. They're involved in the voter registration
[00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:26.399]  system. And they're involved in new thing now. Now, here's what I see coming down the
[00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:32.360]  pipe. This lobbying effort, this whitewash effort, one of the things they also discuss
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:37.239]  is, well, what we need to do is sort of come up with our own certification standard, not
[00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:41.639]  the Federal Election Commission, but our own. We'll have the gold standard, which will
[00:27:41.639 --> 00:27:47.120]  be our own making. Now, I think what they're planning to do with the gold standard is this.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.639]  There's a company called Vote Here. Vote Here makes something that goes inside voting
[00:27:51.639 --> 00:27:57.040]  machines. It's designed to go inside all the voting machines from all the manufacturers.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.480]  It will be sort of like, you know, where they have that little label that says Intel inside.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.960]  Well, I think they will have a little thing that says Vote Here inside.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.800]  Oh, and they own this. It happened to be designed where it could fit into them. Oh.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:14.719]  Vote Here does is they create a software program with cryptography that is supposed to verify
[00:28:14.719 --> 00:28:20.440]  our vote as voters so we don't need paper. OK? And then everybody, of course, will sign
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.320]  off on this. You know, the defense contractors and the Homeland Security and all of that.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.320]  Oh, this is all wonderful.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.560]  The cryptography is bulletproof. You have to trust it if it's got Vote Here inside it,
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:36.560]  you see. And so I think what it's aiming toward is you're going to see a move unless we're
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:42.399]  and we're doing some pretty good work here to get the right questions asked. So it may
[00:28:42.399 --> 00:28:46.919]  be more difficult than they expected. You're going to see a move, though, to try to switch
[00:28:46.919 --> 00:28:52.040]  again and say, OK, well, the voters insist on a voter verified paper ballot. You know
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:57.560]  what? You don't need that. You need this bulletproof cryptography system. And we'll put it inside
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.679]  all the voting machines. Now, guess who is the director of Vote Here?
[00:29:01.679 --> 00:29:02.679]  Who?
[00:29:02.679 --> 00:29:09.159]  Well, the chairman of the board of directors is also on the Defense Policy Board, and he's
[00:29:09.159 --> 00:29:17.239]  also the vice chairman of the SAIC. His name is Admiral Bill Owens. He was chaining cronies.
[00:29:17.239 --> 00:29:21.800]  And another director is Robert Gates, the former CIA director.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.800]  Oh, good to see.
[00:29:23.399 --> 00:29:27.800]  And these are the people who are running Vote Here. And they have the expert, wonderful
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:33.840]  cryptography solution, Trust Us. Just remember, Trust Us. And it will go in these voting machines
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.279]  and be the new gold standard so that we should just trust them. And we know we never again
[00:29:38.279 --> 00:29:39.279]  need a paper ballot.
[00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:42.840]  Well, Bev Harris, let me stop you for just a minute. Let me stop you. I mean, this is
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:47.360]  just bombshell after bombshell. And I'm begging the listeners, you know who we are, just like
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.600]  the Catherine Albrecht interview that you did a transcript of. I'm begging you to do
[00:29:51.679 --> 00:29:56.759]  the transcript. Get it to Paul Watson. We'll get it up on PrisonPlanet.com, up on Infowars.com,
[00:29:56.759 --> 00:30:00.759]  so we don't have to wait four months or three months for this to show up in the mainstream
[00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:06.320]  media with the spin on it. And we'll put links, of course, to BlackBoxVoting.com and have
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.679]  all that there for folks so we can get it out to everybody.
[00:30:08.679 --> 00:30:19.199]  But the key here is, Bev, were you aware of the folks over at NoCards, the involved Catherine
[00:30:19.199 --> 00:30:23.639]  Albrecht? She went to the meetings, and then they got off one of the websites that had
[00:30:23.639 --> 00:30:28.360]  a back door in it, the documents with the RFID tracker chips they want to replace the
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.399]  barcode with, and the secret meeting with Walmart and Procter & Gamble?
[00:30:32.399 --> 00:30:33.960]  Oh, I heard about that, yes.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:39.719]  Yeah, with Homeland Security talking about how to neutralize us, how to neutralize opposition,
[00:30:39.719 --> 00:30:45.020]  I mean, and how to get the military-industrial complex involved. I mean, this is sinister.
[00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:50.779]  This is like The Running Man or something, where you find out TV's fake and pulling
[00:30:50.779 --> 00:30:54.779]  the curtain back. I mean, this is so huge, Bev.
[00:30:54.779 --> 00:31:00.179]  And it's like, I agree. People want to say, oh, you guys, you're just crazy and stuff.
[00:31:00.179 --> 00:31:05.860]  And look, I had no idea, frankly, when my publisher went into this meeting, I had no
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:11.820]  idea about this. I knew that there was a vote here situation and that there was defense
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:15.860]  people involved in that, but I couldn't quite figure out what those here did until this
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:21.820]  meeting. But when we heard, and they were, I'm telling you, there was like two paragraphs
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:26.540]  of conversation about the defense industry and how it had pushed Hava Bill through and
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.060]  how maybe they could come in and help us now.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.779]  By the way, there's two websites with this, but blackboxvoting.com does have the transcript
[00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:34.779]  on it.
[00:31:34.779 --> 00:31:35.779]  Absolutely.
[00:31:36.739 --> 00:31:42.580]  It's not a complete transcript, and it does have my publisher's fairly opinionated notes
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:43.580]  along with it.
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:46.580]  Let me just add this, Bev Harris.
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:47.580]  Go ahead.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:53.699]  This is so huge. We've already caught them that the voting machines are a fraud. We've
[00:31:53.699 --> 00:31:57.820]  got the League of Women Voters saying, we don't want a paper ballot or a record. We've
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:04.580]  got all this other police state stuff going on. And then you guys get into one of these
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:11.300]  little secret meetings and you've got the Plain Dealer Cleveland newspaper person hearing
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:18.540]  all this. This is on the record. This is huge. I mean, I don't even have words to articulate
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.340]  how evil this is.
[00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:28.020]  This is people ... I call it a business plan. You see people that are like, are you a conspiracy
[00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:31.940]  theorist? What do you think of this? I say, look, this is a business plan. If you come
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:39.020]  right down to it, it's a bunch of guys that want to control the world through business.
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:43.899]  I mean, it's a business plan. Okay, what we have to do is we have to do this and this.
[00:32:43.899 --> 00:32:49.899]  But the bottom line is I've tried really hard not to ... And I did label just now, speculation
[00:32:49.899 --> 00:32:55.139]  and speculation with what I'm talking about. But this stuff is fact. My fact to check out,
[00:32:55.139 --> 00:33:01.340]  I have broken six or seven stories in a row now, and not one of them has failed to check
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.820]  out, and virtually all of them have ended up getting covered finally six months later
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:10.779]  with a spin by the mainstream media, including the Washington Post and New York Times and
[00:33:10.779 --> 00:33:16.259]  everyone else. It checks out, and it's to the point now where, okay, it's making sense
[00:33:16.259 --> 00:33:22.259]  now. And by the way, defense contractors tend to make an awful lot of money if the vote
[00:33:22.259 --> 00:33:27.259]  goes their way. We've spent, what, a trillion dollars in the last three years? It's crazy.
[00:33:27.699 --> 00:33:32.259]  Yeah, if they control the government, the government's going to give them more wars
[00:33:32.259 --> 00:33:37.580]  for more weapons. But also, the private defense contractors are getting into private prisons,
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:44.580]  homeland security operations, the face scanning cameras, the biometrics, all of it, the RFIDs.
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:52.580]  They're going to build a giant prison for us. They're taking over the voting. This is
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.139]  a late night science fiction horror movie from the 1980s.
[00:33:57.139 --> 00:34:01.860]  You know, the one thing we have going for us is that when you have all that data and
[00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:06.739]  they crunch all those things, eventually it comes down to a human who has to go to his
[00:34:06.739 --> 00:34:11.380]  boss and say, I think we should look into so-and-so. Now, this is a very bad thing because
[00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:15.259]  we can assume they're going to look into a lot of people that are very inappropriate.
[00:34:15.259 --> 00:34:20.540]  But in the bottom line is, some human has to eventually look at all that data. So it's
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:24.540]  extremely inappropriate that they're collecting it. But I have to say, I sometimes kind of
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:29.420]  smile and think, what in the world do they think people ... I mean, at some point, it's
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.500]  like if you do surveillance on all these people, I can tell you, if they were doing surveillance
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:38.220]  on the six telephone lines that I have in my office and house, they would have to listen
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:45.220]  to five teenagers discussing their boyfriends and their nails. I mean, who's ... At some
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:50.380]  point, some poor schmo is going to have to actually go through all this stuff and be
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.859]  able to decide what's important. I think that may be the thing that saves us at some point
[00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:57.540]  because they won't get the ... Well, no, it's true. The reason they're announcing
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:02.220]  Echelon is watching us and you don't have any rights is a chilling effect. They don't
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:06.300]  have the personnel, even with the computers, to do anything with this. We're on the march,
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.460]  they're on the run, but ... So they'll get a couple of key people that
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.819]  they can use as a public example. But, Bev, they're still putting in the systems
[00:35:13.819 --> 00:35:16.819]  no matter how much fraud comes out. How do we stop them?
[00:35:16.819 --> 00:35:22.740]  Well, it's getting to the point where we need to ... I'm saying we are at Boston Tea
[00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:29.740]  Party's stage, okay? This is really sad because we are getting quite a few little e-mails
[00:35:30.899 --> 00:35:37.500]  putting us on notice that are looking into it is putting us into legal jeopardy. I look
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:41.260]  at that as the Boston Tea Party. I will break one more thing here.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:46.180]  Stay there. One more segment, Bev. We're so honored to have you, Bev Harris. See, this
[00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:52.100]  woman, this investigator who exposes corruption in the mainstream. I've got major newspapers
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:56.859]  involved. She gets the e-mails. You better stop looking into that. How about we all join
[00:35:56.859 --> 00:36:00.819]  her in looking into it? How about we all join her in this fight? How about we stand up to
[00:36:00.819 --> 00:36:07.819]  this evil, folks? We'll go one layer deeper down the rabbit hole when we get by.
[00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.530]  We'll go one layer deeper down the rabbit hole when we get by.
[00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:42.530]  We'll go one layer deeper down the rabbit hole when we get by.
[00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:14.530]  Bev Harris, you said one more major issue you were going to break.
[00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:18.530]  Well, yeah. We were talking about the Boston Tea Party.
[00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:25.530]  Look, if all of us are out there actively doing what we need to do to look into this issue,
[00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.530]  it's pretty hard for them to take us all down.
[00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:30.530]  So, there's safety in numbers.
[00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:35.530]  Now, there are many people doing things that are completely unrelated to me,
[00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:38.530]  but I want to tell you about one such guy in California.
[00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:40.530]  He's my new hero.
[00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:44.530]  And, Alex, if you like, I can send you the link when it pops up.
[00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.530]  I understand in the next couple of days.
[00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:48.530]  Okay. Tell us about it.
[00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.530]  There's going to be a link that he posts.
[00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:55.530]  He's going to post the rig-a-vote kit, which is using actual files from Diebold.
[00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:57.530]  What he has been doing is put it on a CD.
[00:37:57.530 --> 00:38:00.530]  He's taking it around and visiting his newspaper offices, editors,
[00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.530]  and saying, let me put this on your computer.
[00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.530]  We're going to walk through this together.
[00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.530]  I'm going to show you how to rig your own election.
[00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:10.530]  And now this is not designed to show people how to rig elections.
[00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.530]  It's designed to show newspaper editors the back doors into the system.
[00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:18.530]  He says he is routinely picking up jaws off the floor.
[00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.530]  They cannot believe what they're seeing.
[00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:24.530]  And in his kit, which a link will be posted to,
[00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:28.530]  and I'm going to encourage people to grab it quick because, you know, it will get shut down.
[00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:29.530]  Well, it's simple.
[00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:30.530]  For those that don't know, it's been in the news.
[00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:37.530]  They will have where one of every three votes for a certain individual just goes into a black hole file that isn't counted.
[00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:41.530]  Well, yeah, and what he has is it shows you where the back doors are.
[00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:45.530]  And it's just so appalling when you see it.
[00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.530]  Now, give us that website address.
[00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:48.530]  Well, we have to send that to you.
[00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:50.530]  It's going up within the next two days.
[00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.530]  I'm telling you what's going to happen here.
[00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.530]  And so that will be coming.
[00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:58.530]  Now, one of the things he found, though, was he found an actual, he found a smoking gun.
[00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:08.530]  He found an actual file of actual votes for San Luis Obispo County, California that is, let's just say, a problem.
[00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:10.530]  Now, you know what they're supposed to do.
[00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:11.530]  All the precincts vote.
[00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:13.530]  They close down the polls.
[00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:15.530]  They tally up the precincts.
[00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:26.530]  Somebody explain why there's a file that was left on the Diebold FTP site where they tallied up the votes from all 51 precincts in that county at 3.31 in the afternoon.
[00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:37.530]  And it can only have been done via wireless electronic means because otherwise they would have had to shut down all 51 polling places and plug in a modem.
[00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:38.530]  They didn't have to.
[00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:39.530]  That didn't happen.
[00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:46.530]  And why did that end up with a password that's the name of a Diebold employee and end up on a public FTP site?
[00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.530]  When they're not supposed to be involved, they're so sloppy.
[00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.530]  This is in the middle of an election, folks.
[00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:52.530]  Folks.
[00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:55.530]  You were tallying up 51 precincts in the middle of an election.
[00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:56.530]  But, Harris, God bless you.
[00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:58.530]  We've got to get you back on.
[00:39:58.530 --> 00:39:59.530]  You're an amazing lady.
[00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.530]  Blackboxvoting.com.
[00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:02.530]  You're amazing.
[00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:03.530]  Can we get you back up soon?
[00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:04.530]  Absolutely.
[00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:05.530]  You're awesome.
[00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:06.530]  Take care.
[00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:07.530]  Okay.
[00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:08.530]  Thank you much.
[00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:09.530]  Wow, folks.
[00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.530]  The CIA, the military industrial complex, the media.
[00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:14.530]  I mean, are you starting to get how bad stuff is?
