[00:00.000 --> 00:22.360]  Friday, May 31, 2019.
[00:22.360 --> 00:27.800]  Already almost half way into 2019, incredible, how time is accelerating.
[00:27.800 --> 00:31.240]  I'm your host Alex Jones, we're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:31.240 --> 00:36.900]  We have Robert Barnes, who's a great lawyer and really great talk show host in Studio
[00:36.900 --> 00:42.680]  With Us for the second two hours and I will open the phones up on a host of issues when
[00:42.680 --> 00:43.840]  he's in Studio With Us.
[00:43.840 --> 00:47.200]  I didn't do it yesterday, I will do it today.
[00:47.200 --> 00:52.820]  There is so much insane news that I've got to cover it all and there's a bunch of news
[00:52.820 --> 00:57.440]  I didn't get to from yesterday that I want to try to cram in so it's going to be a full
[00:57.440 --> 01:04.200]  broadcast here.
[01:04.200 --> 01:12.320]  Every blue city in the country is not just collapsing into typhoid and leprosy and drug
[01:12.320 --> 01:16.880]  resistant TB and literally hundreds of other diseases.
[01:16.880 --> 01:24.520]  They're collapsing into homelessness, drug abuse, needles with a cherry on top of men
[01:24.520 --> 01:28.720]  dressed as women running around at public events with small children, that's the cherry
[01:28.720 --> 01:29.720]  on top.
[01:29.720 --> 01:34.960]  Was Sodom and Gomorrah real in the Bible?
[01:34.960 --> 01:38.880]  Archaeologists think so, the Old Testament.
[01:38.880 --> 01:42.600]  But Sodom and Gomorrah is real today.
[01:42.600 --> 01:47.080]  I've got articles about blue cities where they go into the abortion clinics and there's
[01:47.080 --> 01:51.480]  just rotting babies and body parts and blood and rats and cockroaches everywhere.
[01:51.480 --> 01:58.240]  I mean you couldn't run a hot dog stand and have it one-tenth as dirty but because they're
[01:58.240 --> 02:04.280]  killing babies and it's such a royal right, well then you can get the woman infected and
[02:04.280 --> 02:06.040]  kill her too.
[02:06.040 --> 02:10.680]  It's just insane asylum level but I want to play this piece again that's so important
[02:10.680 --> 02:15.000]  and I haven't reposted it in forewords.com the front page that the group put together
[02:15.000 --> 02:19.880]  because it boils down the insanity and the foaming at the mouth of the left and when
[02:19.880 --> 02:24.320]  we come back I'll give you the title of the video but I'm going to repost it in forewords.com
[02:24.320 --> 02:29.560]  and it just goes with the famous song, they're coming to take me away haha who he, here it
[02:29.560 --> 02:59.400]  is.
[02:59.400 --> 03:08.400]  They're coming to take me away haha they're coming to take me away haha to the funny firm
[03:08.400 --> 03:13.400]  where life is beautiful all the time and I'll be happy to see those nice young men in their
[03:13.400 --> 03:16.400]  clean white coats and they're coming to take me away haha.
[03:16.400 --> 03:19.400]  You're f***ed out of here, you're not me.
[03:19.400 --> 03:24.880]  You thought it was a joke and so you laughed, you laughed when I had said that losing you
[03:24.880 --> 03:31.400]  would make me flip my lips right, you know you laughed, I heard you laugh, you laughed,
[03:31.400 --> 03:37.760]  you laughed and laughed and then you left but now you know I'm utterly mad and they're
[03:37.760 --> 03:44.400]  coming to take me away haha they're coming to take me away haha to the happy home with
[03:44.400 --> 03:49.400]  trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket weavers who sit and smile and twiddle their
[03:49.400 --> 03:54.840]  thumbs and toes and they're coming to take me away haha I'm going to grow one magnificent
[03:54.840 --> 03:55.840]  pair of breasts.
[03:55.840 --> 04:01.040]  I cooked your food, I cleaned your house and this is how you pay me back for all my kind
[04:01.040 --> 04:07.920]  unselfish loving deeds, well you just wait they'll find you yet and when they do they'll
[04:07.920 --> 04:20.360]  put you in the ASPC they're coming to take me away haha they're coming to take me away
[04:20.360 --> 04:24.480]  haha to the funny farm where life is beautiful all the time and I'll be happy to see those
[04:24.480 --> 04:30.080]  nice young men in their clean white coats and they're coming to take me away haha to
[04:30.080 --> 04:35.440]  the happy home with trees and flowers and chirping birds and basket weavers who sit and smile
[04:35.440 --> 04:47.520]  and twiddle their thumbs and toes and they're coming to take me away haha to the funny farm
[04:47.520 --> 04:59.800]  where life is beautiful all the time info wars the most banned network in the world
[04:59.800 --> 05:07.300]  They've not shut down our speech. We're at infowars.com and newswars.com and we're defeating the leftist tyrant.
[05:07.300 --> 05:14.300]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans that almost all of them said we used to love you on air. It was so good to see you on, you know, the iTunes or on YouTube.
[05:14.300 --> 05:23.300]  Are you coming back? We're at infowars.com. We're at newswars.com. Paul Watts has launched his own summit.News. We have our own videos. We have our own articles.
[05:23.300 --> 05:30.800]  They're trying to destroy us, but thanks to you and others having us on, infowars is still chatting along, so we're there, folks, tomorrow's news, today.
[05:30.800 --> 05:34.800]  Infowars.com! Woo!
[05:36.800 --> 05:41.300]  Infowars.com, because that's what you people out here are talking about, infowars.com.
[05:41.300 --> 05:52.800]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com. We knew this censorship was coming forever. We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air. Anybody can use it, reupload it, do whatever you want.
[05:52.800 --> 05:58.800]  People go to infowars.com and newswars.com. That's where they find it. You know, there's things called websites. You just go there.
[06:23.800 --> 06:33.800]  All of them were designated dangerous individuals.
[06:33.800 --> 06:37.800]  Basically, they've deemed these individuals to be dangerous.
[06:37.800 --> 06:39.800]  They call me dangerous.
[06:39.800 --> 06:41.800]  Danger is my middle name.
[06:41.800 --> 06:46.800]  Dangerous like hurting other people, or dangerous as in saying things that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't like.
[06:46.800 --> 06:51.800]  This is about the total rollout for complete and total censorship.
[06:51.800 --> 06:57.800]  How dangerous is infowars? What is the difference at this point between Trump's Twitter feed and infowars.com?
[06:57.800 --> 07:02.800]  Infowars tells viewers that the world is out to get them. None of this seems to repel President Trump.
[07:02.800 --> 07:07.800]  Infowars' content is useful to him. Infowars' personalities align with him.
[07:07.800 --> 07:12.800]  I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted. I think they are horrible for our society.
[07:12.800 --> 07:16.800]  I want them shut down. I want them silenced. I want them muted.
[07:16.800 --> 07:20.800]  Because these corporations are controlled by a liberal feud.
[07:20.800 --> 07:30.800]  We're very focused on making sure that our recommendations and discovery surfaces aren't highlighting groups where people are repeatedly sharing misinformation or harmful content.
[07:30.800 --> 07:39.800]  We're working hard to completely remove groups if they exist, primarily to violate our policies or do things that are dangerous.
[07:39.800 --> 07:43.800]  Screw your rules. Your rules go against our values and they are patently un-American.
[07:43.800 --> 07:46.800]  Mark Zuckerberg is not simply censoring opinions.
[07:46.800 --> 07:50.800]  He's prescribing which political opinions you're allowed to have.
[07:50.800 --> 07:53.800]  We need a digital fill of rights.
[07:53.800 --> 07:57.800]  They're becoming the public square and they control how we interact with each other.
[07:57.800 --> 08:04.800]  And if you think that you are going to throw up your hands and say, well, they're private companies, you are absolutely insane and you are part of the problem.
[08:04.800 --> 08:09.800]  You are a bad person. You should be censored off the internet. Bad. Yes. Get out of here, Alex.
[08:09.800 --> 08:13.800]  Infowars might have been banned from Twitter, but it seems to have found a new home over at Trump's Twitter feed.
[08:13.800 --> 08:22.800]  President Trump's furious reaction to Facebook's action showcases that he is, I'm sorry to say, the Infowars president.
[08:22.800 --> 08:28.800]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[08:28.800 --> 08:32.800]  How dangerous is Infowars?
[08:32.800 --> 08:37.800]  How dangerous is America? How dangerous is freedom? How dangerous is free speech?
[08:37.800 --> 08:57.800]  Well, it's dangerous to tyrants. Yeah, they say that Whelan Jennings and Willie Nelson, Chris Christofferson and Johnny Cash were outlaw country music because they bucked Nashville.
[08:57.800 --> 09:07.800]  But they claim rock stars. Outlaw because they got pyrotechnics at their concerts.
[09:07.800 --> 09:24.800]  But how outlaw is it when all you're doing is supporting your country, your republic, your freedoms against classical tyranny and then in your own land, you're hunted, you're lied about, you're assaulted, you're demonized.
[09:24.800 --> 09:30.800]  I'm not a victim. I'm a target because I'm effective just like all of you are out there.
[09:30.800 --> 09:41.800]  And we're not laying down without a fight with the globalist. We're taking it to them with everything we've got.
[09:41.800 --> 09:46.800]  Let me tell you what's coming up today.
[09:46.800 --> 10:07.800]  A bunch of really important clips and yesterday's clips that I can get to. And then the huge news dealing with the collapse of blue cities, not just here, but all over the world, leftist and communist cities are descending into nightmare hell pits.
[10:07.800 --> 10:18.800]  And it's reaching crisis proportion on the feted, leftist controlled West Coast.
[10:18.800 --> 10:26.800]  Separately, even liberal publications are reporting exactly what we broke six years ago.
[10:26.800 --> 10:37.800]  Buzzfeed, US universities and retirees are funding the technology behind China's surveillance state.
[10:37.800 --> 10:51.800]  What did I tell Sundar Pachai, the head of Google six months ago, it was face in Congress in hearings talking about me lying about me.
[10:51.800 --> 10:58.800]  I didn't get to be in the hearing. I didn't get to. I'm sat in the hearing. I didn't get to be questioned. I didn't get to respond. I just got lied about.
[10:58.800 --> 11:02.800]  They've never done that in Congress until now.
[11:02.800 --> 11:10.800]  And I said, you're working with China, not just on Dragonfly, but other systems of surveillance and control, and you're exporting it back to the US.
[11:10.800 --> 11:15.800]  That, of course, was already known then. Now it's all confirmed.
[11:15.800 --> 11:25.800]  That's a huge story. Then you've got all the leftist brainwashing that's going on at lightning speed.
[11:25.800 --> 11:38.800]  If you look at what they did in Zimbabwe and South Africa, they would have reconciliation commissions where whites had to come in and say they were bad people.
[11:38.800 --> 11:56.800]  Well, now that's being set up on universities here and it's being exported into corporations and into government where you go into the meetings and you're told you're a horrible person and you agree that you're a horrible person.
[11:56.800 --> 12:10.800]  And that's why you see Joe Biden and Eric Swall as well and Beto Peto O'Rourke saying it's bad to be white. I apologize for being white. I'm a bad person.
[12:10.800 --> 12:15.800]  That's all coming up the bottom of the hour. We're going to play some of those clips and then get into this.
[12:15.800 --> 12:28.800]  Group invites white women to voluntarily attend race shaming dinners. That's up on news wars.com.
[12:28.800 --> 12:36.800]  Wrong on so many fronts. This is creating race war, creating division, creating mental illness.
[12:36.800 --> 12:43.800]  And where these leftist brainwashers universities, no matter what color they are, they can only identify with things through color.
[12:43.800 --> 12:49.800]  And so we're not growing in New York. That's not how Cortez used to talk.
[12:49.800 --> 12:55.800]  But whenever she's talking to a group of black folks, she puts on a weird urban accent.
[12:55.800 --> 13:02.800]  And then when she's in front of a group of Hispanics, she starts going, oh, like Rick Perry does when he speaks to a Hispanic chamber of commerce.
[13:02.800 --> 13:08.800]  He stops talking like Rick Perry. He starts going, how you do?
[13:08.800 --> 13:13.800]  Very condescending. But that's what leftists do especially. They're famous for it.
[13:13.800 --> 13:18.800]  Remember Hillary gets up in front of people in Kentucky and she goes, how you doing today?
[13:18.800 --> 13:26.800]  Talking like Granny about possum getting cooked up in the oven. Possum pie.
[13:26.800 --> 13:37.800]  And people thought it was satire when her defender went on Fox News and said, no, not only is cauliflower evil, corn is bad because it comes from Europe.
[13:37.800 --> 13:50.800]  It doesn't come from Europe. But so what if it did? This is the territorializing of everything by the left where they're staking everything out and calling it racist.
[13:50.800 --> 14:00.800]  Martin Luther King is being removed all over the United States ecologists because he wasn't leftist enough.
[14:00.800 --> 14:10.800]  You understand? He's the old face. So all the old FBI stuff is now being trotted out with no evidence against King because King's now going to be incinerated and removed.
[14:10.800 --> 14:16.800]  Because he said, don't judge people by what color they are, but how they live and what they do and what they produce.
[14:16.800 --> 14:26.800]  Judge a tree by its fruits. He wasn't the first person to say two plus three equals four. We're going to get into all of that.
[14:26.800 --> 14:33.800]  But the first thing we're going to hit when we come back is medieval diseases are infecting California's homeless.
[14:33.800 --> 14:42.800]  Now spreading to local citizens, schoolchildren and police officers. California, the land of infectious disease.
[14:42.800 --> 14:54.800]  And it's not because of people being under vaccinated. It's the folks that have been vaccinated. The study show that actually get the sickest. Yeah, it removes your immune system.
[14:54.800 --> 15:00.800]  Drew says LA public health is a complete breakdown. No city on earth tolerates this.
[15:00.800 --> 15:05.800]  LAPD employee contracts typhoid.
[15:05.800 --> 15:12.800]  And it just gets worse. Seattle is dying. Portland is dying. And there the left is celebrating.
[15:12.800 --> 15:22.800]  And I can play newscast where they celebrate men with jobs pooping on the street and they've got liberal women going. It's Portland. Do it.
[15:22.800 --> 15:34.800]  This is the mental illness. This is the demonic horde. You go to a leftist event. This is who they are.
[15:34.800 --> 15:39.800]  It's all coming up. Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose it to stop it.
[15:39.800 --> 15:43.800]  Trump's upcoming trip to the UK and so much more.
[15:43.800 --> 15:52.800]  Jared Kushner at the Builderburg meeting. What's my take on that? Last second of the hour. I'm going to detail my view on it and so much more.
[15:52.800 --> 15:58.800]  Whatever you do, tell whoever you're around, how they can tune in. Your word of mouth is absolutely critical to winning this war.
[15:58.800 --> 16:05.800]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon. I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon. Savory and delicious.
[16:05.800 --> 16:14.800]  I buy some. I use some. I store some. Awesome. No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life. NASA pack technology. Bacon.
[16:14.800 --> 16:22.800]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon. Or warm and served. Life saving, ready to eat bacon.

[16:28.800 --> 16:37.800]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the US. What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?

[17:06.800 --> 17:18.800]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life. I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.

[18:13.800 --> 18:26.800]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.800 --> 18:37.800]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[18:37.800 --> 18:46.800]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[18:46.800 --> 18:54.800]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.800 --> 19:01.800]  Head to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.

[20:22.800 --> 20:29.800]  This is not a new world. It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[20:29.800 --> 20:37.800]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[20:37.800 --> 20:45.800]  It has refinements, technological advances, and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[20:45.800 --> 20:51.800]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[20:51.800 --> 20:54.800]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[20:59.800 --> 21:04.800]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth in his last 48 hours on Earth.
[21:04.800 --> 21:13.800]  He's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated because he is built out of flesh and because he has a mind.
[21:13.800 --> 21:19.800]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth who will draw his last breaths in the twilight zone.
[21:19.800 --> 21:26.800]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I am your host, Alex Jones. This is The Infowar.

[21:34.800 --> 21:44.800]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I am your host, Alex Jones. This is The Infowar.
[21:44.800 --> 21:51.800]  We couldn't do it without you, the viewers and listeners, station managers, and owners, and this incredible crew...
[21:51.800 --> 21:59.800] ...that stands in defiance of the globalist censorship and tyranny and stands between the globalists and all of us.
[21:59.800 --> 22:09.800]  This crew, this audience, this operation, our transmission is dead on vaporizing the enemy with truth and they can't stand it.
[22:09.800 --> 22:16.800]  This transmission is a wartime broadcast, organically produced by the people of the United States and Texas...
[22:16.800 --> 22:26.800] ...in direct resistance against the global government, corporate, post-human, dehumanization, silicon, AI, world government takeover, technocracy.
[22:26.800 --> 22:31.800]  That's in their words. We are countering them, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:31.800 --> 22:40.800]  It's in the WikiLeaks. It's in their own statements. It's in CIA declassifications. A Ford Foundation left us inside the CIA, not the whole CIA.
[22:40.800 --> 22:43.800]  That's critical to understand.
[22:43.800 --> 22:50.800]  That they want to dehumanize. They want to make you desperate. They want to break up your family. They want to have ugly architecture.
[22:50.800 --> 22:54.800]  They want to destroy language. They want to destroy communication.
[22:54.800 --> 23:02.800]  Because an informed, upwardly mobile population stands in the way of the globalist.
[23:02.800 --> 23:16.800]  I went and saw Godzilla last night and before a cheesy Godzilla movie, it's the best Godzilla movie I ever saw, spoiler alert, because of the plot.
[23:16.800 --> 23:22.800]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement. That's what you're going to be watching.
[23:22.800 --> 23:39.800]  Environmental terrorist, 12 monkeys type, want to release these dormant titans to destroy humans and save the Earth.
[23:39.800 --> 23:41.800]  It's incredible.
[23:41.800 --> 23:57.800]  And the environmental terrorist want to release radiation that'll kill humans, but they believe regreen the Earth, which is something that modern leftists now say, oh, we didn't like nuclear power before, but now we're for it because it'll kill humans.
[23:57.800 --> 24:03.800]  That's main, line, top leftist.
[24:03.800 --> 24:16.800]  So when you go see this, ladies and gentlemen, you are literally being prepared and programmed for mass bio weapon plagues, collapse of civilization, you name it, and that you deserve it.
[24:16.800 --> 24:30.800]  And it's the right thing to do because there was an ancient Atlantean civilization that was also destroyed because it got out of balance.
[24:30.800 --> 24:36.800]  And so aliens attacked the Earth to wipe out humanity.
[24:36.800 --> 24:42.800]  But then Godzilla, this archetype of the Earth, of the Earth spirit, stood up and resisted it.
[24:42.800 --> 24:49.800]  But Godzilla might have to come back and kill the humans. They tell you at the end of the movie.
[24:49.800 --> 24:51.800]  Now, now, why is this in all the movies?
[24:51.800 --> 25:00.800]  This is when you see in game that's still for free on YouTube. They haven't taken it down off a fan channel. We let post it years ago, 12 years ago.
[25:00.800 --> 25:05.800]  It's been taken on everywhere else. They had like 80 million views on Google video. They took that down years ago.
[25:05.800 --> 25:09.800]  It just made it defunct. It just went away.
[25:09.800 --> 25:11.800]  But it's there.
[25:11.800 --> 25:15.800]  This won't be Godzilla. This won't be fiction.
[25:15.800 --> 25:19.800]  This will be globalist. Their quotes, their statements of how they're planning all this.
[25:19.800 --> 25:22.800]  Now, why am I getting into that right now?
[25:22.800 --> 25:32.800]  When you see every major European city collapsing under hundreds of thousands of North Africans and Islamists out of the Middle East
[25:32.800 --> 25:38.800]  and feces everywhere and rape everywhere.
[25:38.800 --> 25:43.800]  And when you see families thrown out of their houses to put the invaders in.
[25:43.800 --> 25:55.800]  And when you see all the major leftist cities of the world filled with knife attacks, acid attacks, piles of feces, piles of garbage, rats everywhere.
[25:55.800 --> 25:59.800]  That is an admitted plan.
[25:59.800 --> 26:06.800]  They set up the parameters of the system for collapse.
[26:06.800 --> 26:09.800]  They're breaking our borders, our courts.
[26:09.800 --> 26:20.800]  They're bankrupting the social safety net because the globalists are at war with equally distributed civilization.
[26:20.800 --> 26:32.800]  And by equally distributed civilization, open, free civilization, egalitarian, truly liberal, classical in nature, renaissance.
[26:32.800 --> 26:36.800]  The EU was shut up to destroy the nation states of Europe.
[26:36.800 --> 26:42.800]  They bragged about it. To put them in debt, suck them dry and blow them, bring down Europe's borders.
[26:42.800 --> 26:44.800]  Flood them.
[26:44.800 --> 26:55.800]  North American Union was set up for that. All of these things are set up to wage war against independent groups and consolidate power in vertical integration.
[26:55.800 --> 26:59.800]  Now, when I use words like vertical integration, that's an establishment term.
[26:59.800 --> 27:05.800]  When I use terms like technocracy, that's what they call themselves, is technocrats running a technocracy.
[27:05.800 --> 27:10.800]  Look it up, from Davos to Bloomberg to the Rockefellers to the Chikops.
[27:10.800 --> 27:16.800]  A computer-run dictatorship with them programming.
[27:16.800 --> 27:24.800]  You're in 2019, folks. You're about to be in 2020. You're not in Kansas anymore.
[27:24.800 --> 27:26.800]  This is their plan.
[27:26.800 --> 27:29.800]  Break up your family, bankrupt you. Make sure you don't have a job.
[27:29.800 --> 27:35.800]  Make sure that you're on welfare so they can control and dictate your life.
[27:35.800 --> 27:43.800]  When we come back, I'll play these newscast clips where even the left is saying, what have we done? It's a living hell.
[27:43.800 --> 27:45.800]  That's the plan.
[27:45.800 --> 27:54.800]  All over the world, you'll have mountains and plenty of rain for the farmers, like they have in Southern Oregon, Northern California.
[27:54.800 --> 27:59.800]  But for a decade plus, Bush did it too.
[27:59.800 --> 28:08.800]  They turned all the water off, even though there was huge mountain lakes full of water, that were built, artificial lakes, reservoirs,
[28:08.800 --> 28:17.800]  to create farming belts in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s. It stopped.
[28:17.800 --> 28:27.800]  They then said, because of a fish that's invasive, not even the law, you can't have water for a decade and drove everyone out.
[28:27.800 --> 28:31.800]  Now they're buying it up for nothing, then they'll turn the water back on.
[28:31.800 --> 28:42.800]  This is the plan. And when you start thinking like a globalist, you'll understand their larger operation, and then you'll have a chance of stopping them.
[28:42.800 --> 28:50.800]  But their plan is deindustrialization for you, then they siphon all the technology and money into their system, the breakaway civilization,
[28:50.800 --> 28:58.800]  the opposite of an equally distributed civilization, the essence of elitism.
[28:58.800 --> 29:04.800]  Oh, these pains, my neck, my back, shoulders. I've got to get some relief.
[29:04.800 --> 29:12.800]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads to pain, but you don't want to take another pill.

[31:04.800 --> 31:09.800]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world and the globalists are so upset.
[31:09.800 --> 31:13.800]  The problem is people forget to take them.

[33:20.800 --> 33:41.800]  With a breakfast full of grimace and a terrible sound, he pulls the spinning high-denture wire down.
[33:41.800 --> 33:52.800]  Helpless people are stuck with dreams, screamed by God as He looks in on them.
[33:52.800 --> 34:03.800]  He picks some of us and it goes a back down as He went through the billies for the center of town.
[34:03.800 --> 34:18.800]  They say He's got to go, go, go Godzilla!
[34:18.800 --> 34:28.800]  So, we can joke around about, oh, Godzilla movie. There's a secret world government system and people hijack the world government system
[34:28.800 --> 34:35.520]  release a bio weapon upon the earth to kill all the humans. The bio weapons
[34:35.520 --> 34:41.360]  happen to be a thousand feet tall, but they're biological weapons and they say
[34:41.360 --> 34:48.360]  to cleanse the earth of the evil humans. And this is all part of the idea that
[34:48.360 --> 34:54.160]  humans are inherently bad in every case and so getting rid of us is a good thing.
[34:54.160 --> 34:59.600]  We suck, we're ugly, we need to give up our life force, we need to give up our
[34:59.600 --> 35:04.000]  survival instinct, we need to just go away. Again, thank you for joining us on
[35:04.000 --> 35:09.420]  Alex Showns, your host. Now the globalists just want you to hate yourself so you
[35:09.420 --> 35:13.320]  won't want to achieve anything, you won't want to control your own destiny, you
[35:13.320 --> 35:19.320]  won't want to be involved so they can quote, own the future. That's an
[35:19.320 --> 35:27.440]  establishment term, own the future so they can have their breakaway civilization
[35:27.440 --> 35:35.240]  and so all of us profane people while we're debating whether cauliflower is
[35:35.240 --> 35:40.080]  racist or not because AOC said so. While we're all busy doing that, they're
[35:40.080 --> 35:43.760]  laughing at us, siphoning all of our research, all of our technology off and
[35:43.760 --> 35:48.840]  building a breakaway civilization, which again the new Godzilla movie shows you.
[35:48.840 --> 35:54.160]  Underground bases and advanced spacecraft and advanced weapons and advanced
[35:54.160 --> 36:01.080]  airborne troop carriers, a lot of stuff that has actually been built and they're
[36:01.080 --> 36:08.000]  just showing it to you in the movie. In fact, real insiders wrote the script
[36:08.000 --> 36:17.400]  because the symbol of the infinity hourglass is actually a major underground
[36:17.400 --> 36:24.240]  secret government project symbol. So again, this is total revelation of the
[36:24.240 --> 36:31.160]  method and you can look at it two ways. They're either telling you, hey we know
[36:31.160 --> 36:34.480]  there's bad groups that want to kill everybody with their world government
[36:34.480 --> 36:39.080]  but we've decided that's not a good project and it'll be too out of control
[36:39.080 --> 36:43.160]  because we wanted to just slowly cut you back, we didn't want to kill everybody
[36:43.160 --> 36:50.440]  and now we realize once this gets out of Pandora's box that this thing wants to
[36:50.440 --> 36:56.440]  kill the planet, which is Satan or the false king. Oh yes, it's all biblical.
[36:56.440 --> 37:01.320]  You've got Satan, they call him the false king, the three-headed dragon, the
[37:01.320 --> 37:07.800]  alien and then you've got Godzilla, the Atlantean God, come to save us out of the
[37:07.800 --> 37:17.840]  ocean. I mean this is beyond Illuminati and the symbolism of the cross with the
[37:17.840 --> 37:24.880]  dragon on top of the mountain, it's all there. Unbelievable. You could write a book
[37:24.880 --> 37:30.680]  about the symbolism in this. This is revelation of the method. I'm gonna go
[37:30.680 --> 37:36.600]  back and see it tomorrow and I'm gonna write notes because my mouth was hanging
[37:36.600 --> 37:44.520]  open. Now, why am I getting into this so much with all this other news? Because if
[37:44.520 --> 37:49.640]  you look at the original Godzilla idea that the establishment adopted, Japan
[37:49.640 --> 37:53.040]  had been bombed with 2A bombs, a half their population had been killed in
[37:53.040 --> 37:58.600]  major cities. Godzilla symbolizes somebody that's angry at radiation tests,
[37:58.600 --> 38:04.520]  angry at war or woken up by it and so he comes and attacks Tokyo. Later he becomes
[38:04.520 --> 38:11.520]  this guardian character. But again, that goes back to that ethos that humans are
[38:11.520 --> 38:15.560]  bad. The truth is in many areas humans improve the environment. In many areas we
[38:15.560 --> 38:20.480]  heard it. The point is, is that we're the advanced species. To save the earth we've
[38:20.480 --> 38:25.360]  got to go into space. I grew up hearing that, reading that, knowing that. Jeff
[38:25.360 --> 38:32.760]  Bezos have been very critical of him in many ways, is nothing compared to the
[38:32.760 --> 38:36.920]  other big tech heads. He at least works with the US government. He at least works
[38:36.920 --> 38:41.960]  for a pro-human space program in the future. He's not working with Communist
[38:41.960 --> 38:52.480]  China like Apple and Google are and I'm not saying that to kiss Bezos' ass. I'm
[38:52.480 --> 38:58.640]  saying that because it's the truth. You don't get worse than Apple. You don't get
[38:58.640 --> 39:03.040]  worse than Google. You don't get worse than Facebook. You don't get worse than
[39:03.040 --> 39:10.360]  Twitter, ladies and gentlemen. These people are out of control, allied with
[39:10.360 --> 39:14.520]  Communist China that are typally from another perspective and they've got
[39:14.520 --> 39:19.560]  symbolism in the film. The three-headed dragon is also China. Very sophisticated.
[39:19.560 --> 39:24.400]  Oh yeah, the Chinese government, I saw this few days ago, is saying they're not
[39:24.400 --> 39:35.440]  going to let Godzilla be seen in China. Why's that? Why's that? Because it's got
[39:35.440 --> 39:47.440]  pro-Japanese, samurai, seppuku culture in it as well. It's sophisticated. Jeff
[39:47.440 --> 39:55.200]  Bezos will have to go to space to save the earth. But instead of, instead of
[39:55.200 --> 40:02.040]  Godzilla and the big three-headed dragon tearing up Boston, New York, DC,
[40:02.040 --> 40:10.520]  areas of Mexico, what's really hitting us? The globalist on record collapsing
[40:10.520 --> 40:16.040]  bourgeois countries, destroying their infrastructure, siphoning all the money
[40:16.040 --> 40:21.440]  off so that they would never be able to develop. That is in state department
[40:21.440 --> 40:30.960]  memorandums from Henry Kissinger in 1970. But the global policy was to not let
[40:30.960 --> 40:37.120]  the third world ever have its own civilization, but to only have centralized
[40:37.120 --> 40:42.560]  civilization islands in the third world that exploit the general populations and
[40:42.560 --> 40:51.200]  extract the wealth to create a breakaway civilization. So see how this works? So
[40:51.200 --> 40:56.360]  this is the global plan. And so once you've exploited the populations, but
[40:56.360 --> 41:05.240]  allowed them to explode in numbers, you then brainwash them, you then send them
[41:05.240 --> 41:14.080]  to refugee training camp systems, and then you march them into the west to
[41:14.080 --> 41:17.480]  conquer what's left. The globalists have already conquered the third world. You
[41:17.480 --> 41:22.520]  know, I saw an article a few days ago that Jordan Klepper guy engaging in
[41:22.520 --> 41:29.680]  defamation as political hacks, you know, do for the enemy. And I listened to part
[41:29.680 --> 41:33.040]  of a podcast this morning that I made a special report on. It's not worthy of the
[41:33.040 --> 41:39.320]  main show, but I listened to about half of it. He was on some podcast launching
[41:39.320 --> 41:44.160]  his new show talking about me and lying about me and saying, yeah, Jones admits,
[41:44.160 --> 41:47.520]  you know, he's fake. He's playing a character. They never play a clip. They
[41:47.520 --> 41:52.320]  never show the quote. Klepper just says, oh, I watched his deposition. He almost
[41:52.320 --> 41:57.680]  admits he's playing a character. I almost admit, okay, never said any such
[41:57.680 --> 42:02.240]  thing. You don't get more real, totally committed and hardcore than me. I mean,
[42:02.240 --> 42:09.720]  this is it. This is who I am. But see a phony like him, he wants me to be who he
[42:09.720 --> 42:16.080]  is. He wants me to be this empty person. But but you, here's how I listen to
[42:16.080 --> 42:21.800]  news, especially podcasts. I wasn't listening to hear about myself. I knew
[42:21.800 --> 42:25.840]  what I was going to hear. Pinhead, elitism, believing he's a ruling class
[42:25.840 --> 42:32.040]  establishment from the universities. He says my mission, he admits everything
[42:32.040 --> 42:36.680]  he does is leftist and globalist. He admits that everything he does is for
[42:36.680 --> 42:42.400]  the cause. And then he talks about refugee camps that the leftist built
[42:42.400 --> 42:47.960]  in Georgia and how they're brainwashing the illegal aliens to hate America and
[42:47.960 --> 42:52.400]  to be communist and how he got arrested. And of course, we already knew all
[42:52.400 --> 42:56.440]  this, but man, I mean, these people and how the Clintons are directing him. He's
[42:56.440 --> 43:06.240]  so proud of it.
[43:06.240 --> 43:13.000]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans, but almost all of them said, we used to love you on air. It was so good to see you on, you know, the iTunes or on
[43:13.000 --> 43:18.560]  YouTube. Are you coming back? We're at infowars.com. We're at newswars.com. Paul

[45:59.000 --> 46:04.440]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators. They are
[46:04.440 --> 46:08.400]  technocrats. They are control freaks in their own words, and they believe allowing
[46:08.400 --> 46:12.000]  you to live your own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their
[46:12.000 --> 46:16.320]  great destiny to merge with AI gods. Now, we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[46:16.320 --> 46:20.040]  We're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension, but one of the biggest
[46:20.040 --> 46:23.640]  places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in
[46:23.640 --> 46:27.840]  our lives is our bodies. If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements
[46:27.840 --> 46:32.920]  from the ForwardsLife.com, I couldn't do it. That's why we decided to take our

[46:37.000 --> 46:42.920]  the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12. Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the

[47:01.680 --> 47:08.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:31.680 --> 47:42.960]  Alex Jones Back Live Broadcasting Worldwide.
[47:47.400 --> 47:53.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am very impressed by Godzilla King of the Monsters.
[47:53.440 --> 48:00.160]  I have never seen one film that gives you the entire revelation of the method
[48:00.160 --> 48:09.280]  plan. The fallen, three-headed dragon of revelation whose power is the sky.
[48:09.920 --> 48:16.200]  Attempting to destroy the earth. Working with human counterparts inside a
[48:16.200 --> 48:23.680]  secret government agency that want to exterminate humanity. This movie is
[48:23.680 --> 48:32.000]  Satan versus Godzilla and it gets into all of it. The world population reduction
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.320]  program. Actual blueprints that I've seen and that others have seen that have
[48:37.320 --> 48:45.040]  been talked about about large carrier aircraft for Ospreys and just this is
[48:45.040 --> 48:51.840]  a full-on US government production. And I would not say this is a US government
[48:51.840 --> 48:55.800]  production of the Obama type or the Netflix type and all the stuff you've
[48:55.800 --> 49:00.120]  been saying. I don't know how they got this movie out because if you know what
[49:00.120 --> 49:06.280]  you're watching, it is a very Christian movie, extremely anti-Satan, but that's
[49:06.280 --> 49:13.920]  only part of it. Truly incredible. But it's not gonna be thousand foot tall
[49:13.920 --> 49:24.480]  kaijus stomping out of the oceans and flying out of the sky from revelation.
[49:24.480 --> 49:30.440]  We are currently watching the purposeful destruction of our planet by
[49:30.440 --> 49:36.000]  deindustrialization, by the destruction of the infrastructure, which if you
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.280]  destroy the infrastructure and you've got seven and a half billion people, it's
[49:40.280 --> 49:48.760]  like releasing seven and a half billion weaponized army ants that will eat
[49:48.760 --> 49:53.240]  everything to the bone. It's a time bomb. If you don't keep civilization
[49:53.240 --> 50:00.520]  arching upward, it goes down. The trajectory of a rocket is up or it's
[50:00.520 --> 50:05.840]  down. This trajectory, ladies and gentlemen, was going straight up towards
[50:05.840 --> 50:13.400]  the stars and beyond. Now the globalists are turning us down and if we don't pull
[50:13.400 --> 50:18.520]  up, if Trump doesn't pull up, it is gonna be curtains and the people that thought
[50:18.520 --> 50:21.480]  they're setting this world government in motion to cleanse the earth and only
[50:21.480 --> 50:24.840]  call certain people and go in their secret government bunkers and they're
[50:24.840 --> 50:30.800]  gonna be safe. The message of Godzilla king of the monsters is that plan is
[50:30.800 --> 50:39.440]  being aborted and we're no longer following it. Yeah, I'd say Godzilla king of
[50:39.440 --> 50:46.280]  the monsters is an infall wars Trump production. If you want to really get
[50:46.280 --> 50:50.880]  down to brass tacks, the people that wrote this movie know what's going on,
[50:50.880 --> 50:55.600]  are on the inside and understand what's happening and it's a desperate,
[50:55.600 --> 51:01.480]  desperate warning that the globalists should stop playing God, the whole world
[51:01.480 --> 51:05.280]  turned against them and they're working with an off-world entity that wants to
[51:05.280 --> 51:11.120]  destroy all life on the planet. A kill shot. It's quite frankly
[51:11.120 --> 51:15.160]  astounding. It's got the cheesy kind of amusement ride, you know, stuff for kids
[51:15.160 --> 51:18.200]  where they're getting shot at and stuff's blowing up and you know, you feel like
[51:18.200 --> 51:22.920]  you're on a roller coaster and a woman's being chased by the monster. It's got a
[51:22.920 --> 51:28.160]  lot of teasing to send it, but the message is super sophisticated on so
[51:28.160 --> 51:32.680]  many levels.
[51:35.920 --> 51:39.480]  Now let's continue here, ladies and gentlemen, with a really big news. Let's
[51:39.480 --> 51:42.240]  talk about the real world and how our we're being deindustrialized and shut
[51:42.240 --> 51:48.880]  down right now. Disney has come out along with others and Netflix and told
[51:48.880 --> 51:52.120]  Georgia and other states because you don't want to kill babies in the third
[51:52.120 --> 51:59.280]  trimester or after they're born, we are going to pull out of your state and
[51:59.280 --> 52:03.400]  bully you. Oh, what a high and mighty good person you are. Funny, corporate
[52:03.400 --> 52:08.680]  tyranny, Netflix, Disney threatened Georgia over abortion ban despite the fact
[52:08.680 --> 52:14.360]  that Disney's been filming in Bolivia where abortion is illegal, Croatia where
[52:14.360 --> 52:19.000]  abortion is illegal after 11 weeks, the UAE where abortion is illegal and being
[52:19.000 --> 52:23.240]  gay is illegal. Disney has no problem filming in any of these locations, but
[52:23.240 --> 52:28.120]  now suddenly Georgia is the enemy. No, it's Christians that are the enemy and
[52:28.120 --> 52:32.400]  of course they're working in communist China. They're working everywhere to
[52:32.400 --> 52:39.800]  suppress populations. That's a news wars dot com article detailing that fact.
[52:39.800 --> 52:43.240]  There's also another article on a daily caller where they go over all of it. I
[52:43.240 --> 52:46.920]  know I said I'd get into Jared Kushner and it's Bilderberg visit and what I
[52:46.920 --> 52:50.440]  think of that. I'll do that at the start of the next hour. I'm behind some
[52:50.440 --> 52:53.960]  Robert Barnes is doing great work with us here behind the scenes. Big stuff
[52:53.960 --> 52:59.160]  about to happen. He's also a great talk show host. He's going to be in studio
[52:59.160 --> 53:04.040]  with us 15 after for the rest of the show, the rest of the show until the
[53:04.040 --> 53:07.720]  fourth hour. And then we have Nick Baggett who always does an amazing job on
[53:07.720 --> 53:14.520]  Fridays hosting the fourth hour. Dr. Nick Badges. So that is coming up today. I
[53:14.520 --> 53:20.920]  have not gotten to all of these clips I said I would. But again, silent weapons
[53:20.920 --> 53:26.360]  for quiet wars. Dissolve the family, get rid of the jobs, demoralize the
[53:26.360 --> 53:33.120]  population, bring in 10 million illegal aliens the last five, six years and do
[53:33.120 --> 53:41.240]  not test them and order the border patrol. Do not test them for diseases and
[53:41.240 --> 53:45.160]  then immediately bust them in, enroll them in school and put them next to
[53:45.160 --> 53:48.960]  your kid with TB. What about the poor illegal alien kids? They should be
[53:48.960 --> 53:52.680]  tested. Your children. Oh, but then they blame you didn't take a vaccine. It's
[53:52.680 --> 53:58.880]  your fault. There is no vaccine for TB. It's all BS. This is a biological attack.
[53:58.880 --> 54:03.640]  This is an attempt to take us down. And again, they form them up at refugee
[54:03.640 --> 54:08.680]  centers, train them, give them $1,000 debit cards, give them cash, give them
[54:08.680 --> 54:14.560]  backpacks of food every step of the way, every leg. Bring them in and then tune
[54:14.560 --> 54:20.680]  in to a podcast with the Jordan Klepper guy. He's going, I got arrested for my
[54:20.680 --> 54:24.480]  new show. We're not really doing coming out. It's purely the mission to defeat
[54:24.480 --> 54:28.040]  Trump and defeat America. And you're just listening to this and then, you
[54:28.040 --> 54:31.720]  know, and the mission is everything. And we're training these wonderful people at
[54:31.720 --> 54:35.920]  this, you know, secret school in Georgia that we've brought up these illegal
[54:35.920 --> 54:41.240]  aliens. And we're going to, you know, win and Hillary's directing me. And I'm so
[54:41.240 --> 54:44.560]  proud that I'm working directly with Hillary, you know, to take down Alex
[54:44.560 --> 54:49.160]  Jones and the way to silence Alex Jones is to, he deserves to be taken off the
[54:49.160 --> 54:56.760]  air. I mean, it's like cartoonish how evil and un-American it is. But he's
[54:56.760 --> 55:03.120]  proud of it. So we'll come back. I'll play some of these newscasts about the
[55:03.120 --> 55:07.640]  diseases, all of it, but it's not that this Jordan Klepper guy is important.
[55:07.640 --> 55:13.360]  Seriously. I mean, he tried to get us to engage him. His show failed. I don't care
[55:13.360 --> 55:20.000]  about being attacked. It's the forensics of one article that we're trying to
[55:20.000 --> 55:24.360]  boost his new show's ratings by attacking me again and then saying, when I say I'm
[55:24.360 --> 55:27.200]  fake and I'm an actor, but there's no quote of me saying that. Again, it's made
[55:27.200 --> 55:33.600]  up. And then his pinheadedness where he just, oh my God, I couldn't believe I
[55:33.600 --> 55:37.040]  met with the Clintons and they're working with me and they're directing me and
[55:37.040 --> 55:40.800]  we're doing productions together and blah, blah, and I actually went and looked
[55:40.800 --> 55:45.080]  it up. He's introducing the legend that this just happened magically. No, the
[55:45.080 --> 55:50.800]  Clintons have a production company. They admit for feminist and leftist
[55:50.800 --> 55:57.240]  operations that's directly taking over with Viacom. Klepper works for that and
[55:57.240 --> 56:04.760]  Netflix. It's like the late night shows have said, yeah, Chuckie Schumer calls up
[56:04.760 --> 56:09.520]  and helps me write my lines. Seriously. Thank you, Chuck. They kiss these old,
[56:09.520 --> 56:15.840]  the lobalist traders who are on the ding dong of the Chai comms riding their
[56:15.840 --> 56:20.800]  wee-wee. Sorry, that's just true. When it fits, you got to use it. I'm not a profane guy,
[56:20.800 --> 56:26.560]  but sometimes I am. It's just, these are flaming traders and the Clintons are
[56:26.560 --> 56:31.200]  like these rotting dead cicada carcasses attached to the wall and here's
[56:31.200 --> 56:37.200]  this Klepper guy like rubbing up against him like, oh, oh, you know, trying to create
[56:37.200 --> 56:41.760]  the new future with skeletons. Klepper, you're not gonna hatch any new little
[56:41.760 --> 56:46.160]  goblins with Hillary or Bill looking like a, looking like a buzzard hanging over
[56:46.160 --> 56:55.240]  your shoulder. I mean, this, this is a joke. This is a joke. This is a joke. And he's
[56:55.240 --> 56:59.440]  going, oh, I couldn't believe the Clintons helped me launch my new show in a
[56:59.440 --> 57:08.760]  promo because it's gonna be announced that they own your show, which anybody
[57:08.760 --> 57:13.680]  could go research and find out like that. So now their billions of their
[57:13.680 --> 57:23.360]  foundation are a facelift for Crypt Keeper and his husband. That's the best you
[57:23.360 --> 57:30.480]  got. As if anyone wants to tune into Comedy Central and see the Clintons
[57:30.480 --> 57:35.720]  looking like day of the dead. At least have them eat somebody's brains. You
[57:35.720 --> 57:41.800]  might get ratings. I mean, some little leftist lying. Nobody hanging out with
[57:41.800 --> 57:46.760]  two dead political operatives. When I say dead, I mean politically.
[57:50.760 --> 57:55.200]  Okay, it's true. I stayed up late last night, so I had half the turbo force this
[57:55.200 --> 58:00.240]  morning. The vibe of it's the minerals, the amino acids. The vibe of it's the
[58:00.240 --> 58:06.480]  minerals, the amino acids, the vibe of it's the minerals, the amino acids, the vibe of it's the
[58:06.480 --> 58:10.660]  metals. That's turbo force. Five different types of caffeine.
[58:10.660 --> 58:15.440]  Tested us a crush. Five different types of caffeine. That's turbo force. Five different types
[58:15.440 --> 58:20.520]  of caffeine. Tested us a crush. Five different types of caffeine. That's turbo force.
[58:20.520 --> 58:26.240]  L rebellious. Very bad.

[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.520]  their billions of laundered drug money and child kidnapping money.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:59.720]  It's come out in AP reports, the Clintons and the giant child smuggling operations out
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:08.200]  of Haiti, but getting back to what I was saying here that I actually got, man, the footage
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:14.560]  of the interview he does with the Clintons where Bill looks like a demonic buzzard that's
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.440]  like looking at a dead baby it's going to eat or something and Clintons like and then
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:22.200]  Hillary just looks like a pumpkin headed demon.
[01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:26.480]  And then here's this little trendy guy that, you know, signed on, he's an anointed one
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:32.080]  from the left to help take down Alex Jones.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:36.960]  And then they're talking about, he's talking about how I need to be taken down and how
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.680]  I deserve what's happened to me.
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:43.920]  He's sitting there with mass murdering war criminals that put 10 times the sanctions
[01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.600]  on the Iraqis that George Herbert Walker did and killed over a million and a half of them,
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:57.680]  500,000 of them being children at Hillary and Bill's direction.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.480]  And when they got asked about it, they said 500,000 is a good price to pay.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:08.160]  So everyone should be thinking themselves every moment of every waking day that you're
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:18.760]  not the tail end of the globalist, leftist, blue blood foundation funded, weird, quasi
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:25.120]  wannabe Atlantic accent British aristocracy, nothing against Brits.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.520]  Hell, my mom is pretty much an Anglophile.
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.360]  And I know why.
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:32.680]  I mean, she's proud of her family lineage and all that.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:39.520]  And just Anglo with Saxon as well.
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:45.800]  But that system power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:52.620]  And the people that inherit all this power and all this wealth become insanely disconnected
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.960]  from reality.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:07.400]  And that's why smart families in many cases would just change their names, buy a ship
[01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:11.200]  and set sail for the new world.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.360]  And a lot of that went on too.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:18.720]  But see, with the Clintons, they don't come from any powerful dynasties or any kings.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:26.280]  They come from knuckle dragon psychopath stock that will do whatever it's told at any time,
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.400]  any place.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.480]  And again, you listen to this crap.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.240]  It is mind blowing.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:46.120]  When I watch Hillary have a speech in New Hampshire or New York, those last two speeches,
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:49.120]  I watched some others too, but the last full speeches I watched.
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.480]  And it was sick of fanning warship.
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:59.080]  If you've seen somebody announced that they read their whole name, and it's like 10 names,
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.320]  the royal highness of this and that, it sounds stupid.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:10.880]  With her, it's shaking, and oh, and she did this, and she did that, and she, because she
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:15.160]  used to run the country, folks, it wasn't Obama.
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:20.240]  And these people all sycophantically worship because she promised them they were going
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.720]  to run everything.
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:26.400]  They weren't just going to run the government, they were going to run you.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:31.840]  And Clepper and all these people were brought up that they're supposed to rule us.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:33.880]  Dude, you ain't going to rule nothing.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.720]  You come from trash.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:41.760]  I can take one look at you and tell you come from a bunch of mentally ill garbage, and
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.280]  that's where you're going back to, son.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:45.560]  He's real, boy.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:46.560]  You can't see it.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:51.160]  So you keep making your jokes, but those that can see can see.
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.800]  I love seeing you sitting there with those two corpses.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.440]  You fit right in, son.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:05.160]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:10.440]  positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:15.640]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things that it's associated
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.640]  with.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.560]  And then it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.320]  Well, thousands of years ago, it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.320]  they were sick.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:27.200]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:32.360]  quality bone broth out there, literally, then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:36.520]  the turmeric, then you have the bee pollen, then you have the other key ingredients that
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:41.520]  are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.760]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.880]  It's 50% off right now at FullWareStore.com because I want you to try it and see how great
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.880]  it is.
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:51.520]  And of course, getting the bone broth isn't just great for you and your family.
[01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:56.120]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taken on the globalists
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.040]  and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.040]  We've got it.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:10.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:16.880]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWare.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:32.200]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWare.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:47.720]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWare.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:07:16.280]  Alright, Robert Barnes, who is one of my great lawyers, chief legal counsel in our fight
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:23.680]  against the globalists, he's going to be in studio starting next segment to cover all
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:29.440]  the international news, the national news, to take your calls and I promise today we
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:36.440]  will open the phones up and take your calls directly for Bob Barnes on any subject you
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:39.440]  want to raise but the questions will be directed at him.
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:42.160]  That is coming up as well.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:52.200]  But I want to give you my view on Jared Kushner.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:57.600]  Now here's how this works for me.
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:10.200]  I judge a tree by its fruits and I've also always noticed that people that get involved
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:19.520]  in King's courts and in the subterfuge of access to a powerful person, it just goes
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.400]  from bad to worse and so I've been sucked into those things when I'm not even wanting
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:32.200]  to be sucked into them to the damage of my overall goal just to promote freedom and awareness
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:39.400]  and decentralization and a pro-human future.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:51.560]  But Jared Kushner is obviously smart, he's a good looking guy, he's Trump's son-in-law,
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:58.080]  I support Trump, I think Trump's smart, Trump means people he can really trust, he trusts
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:05.480]  Jared and so I don't have a problem with him having a national security clearance of the
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.480]  things he's doing.
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:11.880]  I mean, my God, the Communist Chinese ran the Obama administration but oh the left doesn't
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.520]  want Jared Kushner to have a security clearance, what does that tell you?
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:22.520]  But out in the whole right wing sphere, I've been here in for three years since he was
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:33.800]  president-elect that Jared Kushner is just the worst thing since Donorrhea.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:37.160]  But those are the same people that tell me Benjamin Netanyahu is the worst thing since
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:39.680]  death.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:47.400]  I don't get involved in Israel's politics, I'm glad Israel's there, you imagine if the
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:52.280]  Arabs were fighting over it, what would it be like, I mean let's get real, but let's
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.160]  move away from that point.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:03.120]  The Economist magazine, um by the leftist Rothschilds, wanted Netanyahu out, works around the clock
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:07.520]  to remove him and Trump, works around the clock to take me out.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.920]  I don't look at the Rothschilds as Jewish, I look at them as evil opportunists that
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:19.480]  play people off, people say well then why'd they help fund the founding of Israel?
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:23.880]  Because they knew it was already coming and they wanted to try to control it to parlay
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:28.800]  it into world government, which they now admit and the Rothschilds aren't one monolithic
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.440]  group either, it's not fair to say that.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:41.200]  But the ones running it are bad news, bad news, very bad news, obviously.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:45.800]  So all these leftist funded white supremacist groups, that's who funds them and runs them,
[01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:53.360]  look at the left, it's all anti-Semitic stuff, they like boil Jews down to just walk their
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:59.000]  robots or something and that there's just one Jewish brain and Jews all think alike.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.880]  That's not how families work, whether you were German or Japanese or Nigerian, you got
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:09.760]  10 people in the family, they don't all think alike, that's BS.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:16.640]  So I'm not defending Jared Kushner, I'm not attacking Jared Kushner because I elected
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:22.360]  Trump, you elected Trump, Trump trusting and you've got to give the president that support
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:28.960]  because he's been trying hard and been delivering and doing things that are biblical in my view.
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:30.960]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:35.280]  The attack on Trump's all you need to know, they are pissed, the establishment and their
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.400]  whole plan is really upset that he's going to find out all the stuff they've done.
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:44.160]  Now, all that prefacing, I'm done talking about Kushner and I'm going to try to explain
[01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:48.280]  this very, very simply and I know that some of the detractors will take it out of context
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:49.280]  but that doesn't matter.
[01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:53.440]  This is for people that want to hear what I really think and this is my best analysis
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:56.960]  and what I know.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.640]  You published right when it came out from their own site, the Bilderberg group's a
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.920]  tenorary and who's going to be there and who the guest star in Switzerland.
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:10.360]  When I was first covering this 20 years ago, they were saying in the news, I was insane,
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.400]  it didn't exist.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.880]  Even 10 years ago, they would say I was insane, it didn't exist.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:16.880]  You understand?
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:22.160]  So it was the fact that they were saying that world government meetings weren't happening.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:32.000]  That was the issue, Jared Kushner announced he was going to Bilderberg.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.200]  Then people after getting flooded with calls and emails the office, oh my God, Trump sold
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.200]  us out.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:44.120]  Kushner's going to Bilderberg, I'm going to say this, I'm going to be very clear.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.640]  I would go to Bilderberg if they asked me to go.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.800]  What matters is what I stand for.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.720]  We know Bilderberg was set up to bring in world government.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:57.800]  We know Bilderberg's at one of the top globalist meetings that they denied existed at the Rockefeller's
[01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:03.720]  Ramp that brought the Atlantic Alliance of the Western elite in the United States with
[01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:07.440]  the Eastern Western elite after World War II.
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:11.480]  We know the history, I've made films about it.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.480]  Going to a meeting is not being on the agenda.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.840]  Just like when Trump goes to Davos, it's more powerful than Bilderberg now, it's public
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.240]  and they're calling for world government and they're all wearing their EU things and he's
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:26.480]  wearing the American flag and we go and push our agenda there.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:31.360]  Just like Trump meeting with Kim Jong-un doesn't mean we agree with Kim Jong-un executing
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:34.000]  his ambassadors or his envoys.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:43.880]  So it's a very simple thing for me to judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:49.820]  Now if Jared Kushner came back from Bilderberg or Davos or any of these events and Trump
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:55.480]  suddenly signed on to open borders or signed on to globalism or signed on to world government
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:14:01.480]  or signed on to confiscating guns or signed on to teaching five-year-olds how to be gay
[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:05.960]  or whatever, which is what's pushed by the left so you don't have kids, then I'd go
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:10.120]  after Trump in a split second.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:17.400]  Split second, I'm not loyal to Trump, I'm loyal to justice, to my children, to God,
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.520]  to a future, a pro-human future.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:27.240]  But the fact that we have a patriot president, all these other nationals getting elected
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:32.360]  and sweeping elections around the world for populist and now they've got to have a representative
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:38.080]  of Trump inside their confab is us seizing the flag.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:43.120]  At least at the level of my vision, I see this in the continuum of what Trump doing
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:47.720]  and what we're doing and what I'm doing as victory.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:54.760]  You know when we took over Nazi Germany in 1945 and marched in to the right chancellery
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:15:00.120]  and our troops were in the chancellery, where our troops for Hitler, you're like well of
[01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:04.920]  course not, when our football team, if you're for the New England Patriots and they drive
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:08.720]  down the field against the other team and they get into their end zone because they
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:17.400]  got in their end zone, are they for the other team, you're like well of course not, we're
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:23.360]  taking over their end zone, we're taking over their right chancellery, we're taking over
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.960]  their command bases, we're on the march, the empire is on the run.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:38.200]  Now if I see anything out of Kushner or Trump that's pissing on our sovereignty or our freedom,
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:46.640]  our values, I'll turn on them like a pit bull on PCP, but let me give you a little newsflash,
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:54.480]  it ain't gonna happen, it's not folks, it's not, so everybody should just relax, we're
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:57.760]  conquering Bilderberg right now.

[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:32.480]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.480]  the world.
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:38.920]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars, the United States of Empire shows that
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:46.280]  World Wars I and II left England broken, its former colony the US had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.800]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:55.360]  The deep state began with World War I, the United States of Empire by James Dunn, available
[01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.560]  at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.560]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels

[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:28.120]  Thank youNotEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:33.460]  to
[01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:57.980]  on the ground as you know that's boots on the ground.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:02.180]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:07.260]  of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:10.180]  literally dumps the population down.
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:14.300]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:17.060]  gone through two permutations.
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:21.220]  First seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:25.820]  tried to block us getting a supply of it, so we discovered deep earth crystals, a pure
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:29.260]  nascent iodine and brought you X2, that's been incredible.
[01:19:29.260 --> 01:19:34.380]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:39.100]  of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine, but chemists, scientists and others showed
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:44.100]  us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:50.620]  and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:53.700]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:20:01.540]  discovery, X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:29.940]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:48.940]  You see the entire globalist program trying to destroy Trump.
[01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:52.620]  Representatives of the presidency always go to Bilderberg because it was set up by US
[01:20:52.620 --> 01:20:56.660]  intelligence, was what was left of European intelligence after World War II.
[01:20:56.660 --> 01:21:01.260]  If I see Trump's policies change and they're not America first, then I'll turn against
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:04.020]  the president, but I don't think that's happening.
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:09.780]  Going to a globalist meeting, and the fact that secret globalist meetings are now admitted,
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:14.740]  mainstream media now has to report on the powerful secret world government Bilderberg
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:21.380]  policy meeting, when just 10 years ago, they said in the New York Times that I was in Chantilly,
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:29.820]  Virginia, having a full-on, it said, Jones imagined men in sunglasses and SUVs following
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:38.180]  him when they did a review of a movie that won first place at the local South by Southwest
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:42.140]  called New World Order, and the film was at Bilderberg.
[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:45.900]  They showed us being thrown out of the hotel, but when the New York Times did a review,
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:52.860]  they said, we made it up, it doesn't exist.
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:59.140]  That was 2008, so I guess 11 years ago.
[01:21:59.140 --> 01:22:04.140]  How far have we come that world government secret meetings are there, the Pope's called
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:08.340]  for world government, all of it's out in the open now?
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.980]  So the question isn't, is Jared Kushner there?
[01:22:10.980 --> 01:22:12.580]  We're conquering that.
[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:19.460]  Kushner is Trump's representative, and so Trump goes to Davos, that's public Bilderberg,
[01:22:19.460 --> 01:22:21.980]  and he pushes Orange into there.
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.660]  He goes with Mesa, North Korea.
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:25.300]  He pushes Orange into there.
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:32.540]  What I care about is policy out of Trump, and he's not perfect, and Colder's right,
[01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:37.500]  but it's because he doesn't have our support, but on so many fronts he's doing a great job,
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:38.500]  that's why they hate him.
[01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:42.300]  So it isn't a defense of Trump when I defend him, it's a defense of can you imagine if
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:49.020]  Hillary was in full power, because she's still partially in power, buying into Viacom, buying
[01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:53.740]  into Netflix, buying into production companies, meeting with people that do whole TV shows
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:59.980]  nightly about me, Jordan Klepper, about how to bring me down, he does interviews talking
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:00.980]  about it.
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:01.980]  It's unbelievable.
[01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:07.180]  All right, let's shift gears.
[01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:11.300]  Constitutional lawyer, and famous civil rights lawyer as well, one of the top lawyers in
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:14.060]  the country with one of the most winning records.
[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:16.460]  Robert Barnes is here, also does some work for him, full wars.
[01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:19.980]  He's in town the next four or five days, so we're lucky to have him here with us.
[01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:21.820]  We'll open the phones up next hour.
[01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:23.980]  You were sitting here during the break a few months ago, I said, what do you want to
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:24.980]  cover first?
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:25.980]  You said North Korea.
[01:23:25.980 --> 01:23:29.180]  I said, excellent, because that's what I want to get into.
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:32.740]  First with you, you've got a very interesting take on Kim Jong-un.
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:34.580]  You asked me, you said, what is your take?
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:36.580]  And I said a reset, and you said precisely.
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:38.780]  And yeah, exactly, precisely.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:43.420]  So what happened here is that you have, I think the president has read Kim exceptionally
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:48.120]  well and understands the North Korea dynamic and is creating the first real predicate for
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:52.580]  peace that has been established with North Korea since North Korea was created as a separate
[01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:53.580]  independent nation.
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:54.900]  He's ending the status quo.
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:56.980]  We know 60 years of this ain't working.
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:57.980]  Exactly.
[01:23:57.980 --> 01:24:02.180]  And what he's done is he's decided, now this is not the happiest or healthiest mechanism
[01:24:02.180 --> 01:24:07.300]  of dealing with a failed peace conference, is to kill and imprison everybody who he
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:12.460]  blames for it, but what he's doing is he's establishing that he wants it to go forward,
[01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:16.060]  that he does not blame the president, that he wants the president's agenda, and he blames
[01:24:16.060 --> 01:24:20.100]  his people for not achieving that agenda of the peace and detente that the president's
[01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:21.100]  called.
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:23.540]  And then Trump signals he may get rid of Bolton, which is another signal.
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:24.540]  Absolutely.
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:25.540]  So it's president-
[01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:26.540]  It's all face-saving.
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:27.540]  Right, exactly.
[01:24:27.540 --> 01:24:31.660]  It's just the North Korea form of face-saving is not the most ideal form of face-saving,
[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:33.060]  but it's the North Korean model.
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:35.580]  So you know, I don't know if they have any other way to do it.
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:41.260]  Well, he put his uncle in a forced labor camp for not getting the midnight, he basically
[01:24:41.260 --> 01:24:47.540]  agreed, but the guy slept on it and didn't deliver that Kim had backed off and capitulated.
[01:24:47.540 --> 01:24:51.300]  And that's why Kim, and I'm not defending Kim, he's a horrible psychopath, but the blood
[01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:52.300]  bat gets.
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:57.740]  China's had a bunch of wars with South Korea, a little vampire bat knows, they try to keep
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:25:03.060]  them poor under their control as an excuse for destabilization in that entire region.
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:06.380]  So North Korea just works with Japan and the U.S. and South Korea.
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:10.300]  They can be like South Korea, the most prosperous country, you know, per square mile in the
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:11.300]  world.
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:12.300]  So he gets it.
[01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:14.340]  He was going to raise in the West, raise in Switzerland.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:15.420]  He wants to do this.
[01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:16.700]  He likes Trump.
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:21.140]  And so he understands that there's double dealing by his own ministers when he said,
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.300]  oh, they sold out to America.
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:25.020]  No, it really means they're sabotaging for China.
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.020]  Exactly.
[01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:27.260]  I think Trump has a short play and a long play.
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:31.940]  And the short play is to have peace and to end a meaningful détente with North Korea,
[01:25:31.940 --> 01:25:34.980]  so that's no longer a threat to either America or the world.
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:39.740]  But the long play is to remove North Korea as a tool of the Chinese to threaten the world
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:43.900]  so that they can have their trade advantages and economic advantages and slowly but surely
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:46.700]  dominate the rest of the world to their economic edge.
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:50.860]  And so the president wants to preside, well, more than anything else.
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:54.780]  He wants to prevent China from being the next economic engine that dominates the world at
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:55.780]  the expense.
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:56.780]  This is all about China.
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:57.780]  Absolutely.
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:26:03.780]  So the toilet bowl plunger or the stopper in the sink you pull out, the sink, the chai
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:05.140]  comms, is North Korea.
[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:06.140]  Exactly.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.900]  I mean, China has cost us more manufacturing jobs in any other part of the country.
[01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.380]  And the globalist traders have been propping up North Korea, propping up China.
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:16.860]  And Trump and the patriots that are in the Pentagon know that's the strategic target.
[01:26:16.860 --> 01:26:19.660]  So the only way we lose is by not doing this.
[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:24.860]  Kim just wants to make sure that Trump's strong enough that you'll never have freedom
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:28.460]  there, but you'll at least have wealth of the people not starving to death.
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.460]  Kim wants the money.
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:30.460]  He wants the power.
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:31.460]  He wants the resorts.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:33.060]  He wants the factories.
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:36.020]  And Trump's like, I'll give it to you, China would never do it.
[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:41.100]  We actually invade countries, take them over and then set them free like South Korea and
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:42.100]  Japan.
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:44.180]  The chai comms never do that.
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:45.180]  America does do that.
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:46.900]  Now, do you trust me or do you trust them?
[01:26:46.900 --> 01:26:48.380]  And he's in this flux.
[01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:52.540]  But I think the execution of the guys that were obviously working for the chai comms
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:56.940]  is a signal that he understands that and is setting a reset that if you don't actually
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:00.820]  really negotiate, I'm going to kill you, which I'm not defending, but it shows the level
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:01.820]  of brinksmanship.
[01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:02.820]  Yeah, no doubt about it.
[01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:07.380]  And I think he recognizes that China is a greater threat than an ally for North Korea's
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:08.380]  long-term future.
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:12.820]  That the China has no interest in North Korea ever being economically independent and China
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:18.740]  has no interest in North Korea being a peace-oriented country because that removes them as a tool
[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:20.220]  and as a threat to the rest of the world.
[01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:23.660]  And again, China believes it's supposed to rule the world for 5,000 years, as you said,
[01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:28.620]  and greater China, as they call it, they think North Korea and South Korea is greater China.
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:30.380]  They think Vietnam is greater China.
[01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.060]  They think the Philippines is greater China.
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.060]  Exactly.
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:34.060]  And not only is a part of their sort of imperialism.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:36.980]  And Trump's like, I won't invade you, I'll just throw billions at you.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.980]  Exactly.
[01:27:37.980 --> 01:27:40.580]  And his point is that he's different than past presidents, that he can be trusted and
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:44.940]  relied upon because his opposition to Chinese domination is more important than controlling
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:48.780]  North Korea's future and that he's willing to give up controlling North Korea's future
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.940]  as long as North Korea gives up threatening the world.
[01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:56.620]  And you know North Korea for 60-plus years literally being the rape meat of the Chai
[01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:57.620]  Combs.
[01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:58.620]  They want to leave the Chai Combs.
[01:27:58.620 --> 01:27:59.620]  Absolutely.
[01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:02.820]  I mean, they've created a co-dependent relationship between North Korea and China that is only
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.700]  healthy for China, not healthy for North Korea.
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:08.740]  And I think he's recognizing that, realizing that, acting on it, and it was Trump's genius
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:09.980]  to know that he could drive a wedge.
[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:13.420]  And the same way that Nixon knew he could drive a wedge between the Communist Empire by
[01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:17.860]  separating China from the Soviet Union in the 1970s, Trump is doing the same thing all
[01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:18.860]  over again.
[01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:23.700]  And he's taking it to remove China's true tool of oppression, which is using the North
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:26.540]  Korean threat to maintain its economic dominance.
[01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:32.500]  And the only reason the wedge is real is Trump does what he says, it's square dealing.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:36.020]  They call it almost OCD, that what Trump says is what is going to happen.
[01:28:36.020 --> 01:28:39.500]  And people don't realize whenever Trump starts increasing tariffs on China during other things
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:44.220]  anti-China, he's helping the peace process in North Korea because he's sending the message
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:47.940]  to North Korea that he's sincerely more focused on China than them, and he's willing to cut
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:50.300]  a deal for peace for the world to do so.
[01:28:50.300 --> 01:28:53.500]  And he just cut some of the sanctions on North Korea, he's showing them, it's like,
[01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:56.900]  listen, don't be a moron, take this deal, God.
[01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:03.700]  Oh, these pains, my neck, my back, shoulders, I've got to get some relief.
[01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:08.180]  Stress from everyday life, past injuries or surgeries can cause inflammation that leads
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:11.020]  to pain, but you don't want to take another pill.

[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:22.020]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:26.020]  that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:27.020]  side effects.

[01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:03.140]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air, thanks for calling Mike.
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:04.140]  You are the man, Alex.
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:05.860]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:06.860]  I'm so excited.
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:07.860]  I'm such a big fan.
[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:11.100]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products, I got to do a shout-out
[01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:12.620]  for the bone broth.
[01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:18.300]  The bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth, the bone broth.
[01:31:18.300 --> 01:31:22.900]  Tastes like, tastes like great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:28.860]  It tastes like oval-team, it tastes like oval-team, it tastes like oval-team, like good, whoa.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:30.660]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:35.100]  My daughter uses the bubblegum fluoride-free toothpaste.
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:39.900]  I'd use the SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much for that
[01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:40.900]  as well.
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:43.660]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air, I'm thanking
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:48.900]  you, but yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,

[01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:34.580]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:42.540]  The year is 1995 and Infowars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:48.980]  In a freak mishap, infowars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an
[01:33:48.980 --> 01:34:00.980]  orbit which freezes his life support systems and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:34:00.980 --> 01:34:05.380]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:10.100]  What we envisioned 100 years ago, 20 years ago, is now real.
[01:34:10.100 --> 01:34:14.660]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic not knowing how to be men
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:18.460]  and women run around frantic not knowing how to be women and they don't understand that
[01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:24.020]  it's an animating contest of life and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:27.460]  to be involved, it's fulfilling Infowars.
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:37.660]  Tomorrow's News, today.
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:40.340]  Robert Barnes rides a shotgun with us.
[01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:47.660]  We're going to look at the globalist attempt to murder the memory of abolitionists of Christians
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:48.820]  and of Martin Luther King.
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:54.380]  They attempt to demonize him and group invites white women to voluntarily attend race-shaming
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:55.880]  dinners.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.620]  That's on newswars.com.
[01:34:58.620 --> 01:34:59.620]  Very important article.
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:00.780]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:02.700]  It's the next thing Bob wanted to get into.
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:03.700]  That was on my list.
[01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:06.180]  So I'm going to open phones next hour.
[01:35:06.180 --> 01:35:09.820]  But first, I just did a little Buck Rogers intro that one of the crew put together.
[01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:13.780]  I guess Millie Weaver's husband Gavin put together.
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:22.700]  Because I was just at a local t-shirt shop six months ago and I bought a t-shirt that
[01:35:22.700 --> 01:35:26.700]  showed the space shuttle blasting off into space and I happened to wear that on Joe
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:30.580]  Rogan's podcast and people just talked about the shirt everywhere.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:35.700]  All these websites got started selling the shirt because it's a NASA patch.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.420]  It's copyright free.
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:38.420]  It's government.
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:44.860]  But I had it redone where it says Space Force and we made the shuttle a little bit more
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:45.860]  high-tech looking.
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:55.060]  We put 1776 on its right wing, of course, and it's got a red, white, and blue American
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:57.220]  flag on the right shoulder with mfoldwars.com.
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:36:02.100]  We've had a few shirts that have been hitched over the years that really go viral that signify.
[01:36:02.100 --> 01:36:05.020]  I believe this is going to be the new shirt now.
[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:11.420]  The 18-wheeler printed, produced, made in America arrives next Wednesday.
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:13.180]  But I'm going to do some fanfare on this shirt.
[01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:16.460]  I believe this is going to be the next Hillary for Prison shirt.
[01:36:16.460 --> 01:36:18.740]  But it's about a pro-human future.
[01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:21.100]  It's about humanity going to the stars.
[01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:25.900]  It's about believing in the amazing gifts that God's given us.
[01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:26.900]  We're not gods.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:28.900]  We're not going to be gods, but we're made in the image of God.
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:30.460]  It's our reflection.
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:31.860]  So we can do some amazing things.
[01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:34.020]  We're master builders.
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:39.020]  And the space shuttle's 1930s technology put into function in the late 1970s, retired five
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:40.380]  years ago.
[01:36:40.380 --> 01:36:42.580]  And so we've redone it.
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:48.220]  Still had people on the street love the shirt, but a few have gone, why are you wearing that
[01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:51.220]  gay rainbow flag?
[01:36:51.220 --> 01:36:53.820]  And that's when I decided a few months ago to make the shirt.
[01:36:53.820 --> 01:37:02.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am so sick of leftist groups or whoever expropriating or appropriating
[01:37:02.260 --> 01:37:03.260]  symbols.
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:08.140]  Hey, if you're a homosexual and you're not doing any legal stuff, I don't care what
[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:09.140]  you're doing in your bedroom.
[01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:11.980]  That's the left claim in the conservatives are obsessed with what you're doing.
[01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:18.660]  Just leave kids alone with your heterosexual homosexual, plus it's not a classic rainbow.
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:21.020]  It's supposed to be the atmosphere.
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:25.500]  Anybody that knows why NASA created this low in the atmosphere is more dust and stuff
[01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.700]  than a spectrometer or in a telescope.
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:28.700]  It's red.
[01:37:28.700 --> 01:37:31.380]  And as you get higher, it's orange.
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:35.700]  That's why the sun on the horizon is red because you're looking through hundreds of miles of
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.620]  atmosphere, just a few miles of atmosphere.
[01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:43.540]  So clear sky is black, although that is blue, then it's yellow, then it's orange, and it's
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:44.540]  red.
[01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:48.660]  That's why out of thousands of space shuttle patches, they've got thousands, I mean, days
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:50.220]  actually find the original patch.
[01:37:50.220 --> 01:37:52.060]  So this is a copy of the original patch.
[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:57.540]  We put Space Force on it and established 2020 American flag on the side.
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:59.020]  I designed this shirt.
[01:37:59.020 --> 01:38:01.020]  I'm very proud of this shirt.
[01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:02.700]  And maybe I'm wrong.
[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:07.380]  But when I think it's as like guys, it tends to be as like guys, I've had other shirts
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:11.060]  hundreds of thousands of which have been put on the street and it's helped funder operation
[01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:12.060]  as well.
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:16.900]  But this shirt has such nice fabric, it's made in America, all of it, that it cost us
[01:38:16.900 --> 01:38:19.700]  $10 a shirt.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:24.780]  I did a huge order and got it down from 13 because of the printing and the quality of
[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:25.780]  the shirt.
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:28.820]  And we're coming up with a women's version as well, but women can wear this as well.
[01:38:28.820 --> 01:38:29.820]  I'm very proud of it.
[01:38:29.820 --> 01:38:31.980]  And people are going to be like, what is that?
[01:38:31.980 --> 01:38:32.980]  What is Space Force?
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:35.580]  And so, so it's kind of an undercover thing too.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:38.900]  It's like, you might get hit in the head with a bike lock or stabbed if you're a Trump
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:42.740]  supporter and you're out there doing something and you're wearing a Trump shirt, an Info
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:43.740]  War shirt.
[01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:44.740]  People still love those and wear them.
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:45.740]  But what about a Space Force?
[01:38:45.740 --> 01:38:50.580]  What about loving the technology and what we built and having a pro human future in
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:55.180]  space and the American flag that triggers so many and a little info wars.com.
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:56.260]  I think this is the shirt.
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:39:00.740]  So pre-order, I never do pre-orders on T-shirts, we'll have it next week, it'll be shipped
[01:39:00.740 --> 01:39:01.740]  out by the end of the week.
[01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:09.260]  So get your order first, infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, or triple A-253-3139.
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:15.740]  And then lastly, don't forget, we're having Memorial week sales that have to end this
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:17.180]  weekend.
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:25.020]  We have some of our best selling products at 60% off, 40 to 60% off across the board.
[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:29.980]  And I just never spend time telling you about these specials, but this is how we fund ourselves.
[01:39:29.980 --> 01:39:33.140]  And I really appreciate everybody that has been funding us, you're incredible.
[01:39:33.140 --> 01:39:37.980]  But it's the last days of the Memorial week mega sale, we should probably change the graphic
[01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:40.420]  to say that that's my fault.
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:46.740]  But we have so many new big deals, 60% off Extendo-wise and Myco ZX Plus, 50% off the
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:51.900]  new eight pack power stack, 50% off bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, vitamin mineral
[01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:56.460]  fusion, ultimate bone broth, super male vitality, 40% off turbo force.
[01:39:56.460 --> 01:40:00.180]  I don't have time to get into all this folks, but it's amazing.
[01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:06.020]  Chocolate vanilla, protein bars, super silver, lune gel, all of it is 40 to 60% off that
[01:40:06.020 --> 01:40:08.140]  all ends this weekend as well.
[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:13.420]  Okay, you'll have the floor of the next few segments and we'll get into the brainwashing,
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:15.860]  the race war, the globalist, how you think we stop it.
[01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:19.860]  You're a smart guy, Robert Barnes, I've only known him like, I've seen him on TV for decades
[01:40:19.860 --> 01:40:24.180]  and interviewed some of the guys in all the lawsuits with him many years ago, the Wesley
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:29.460]  Slap lawyer, you name it, but just quantifying before we go to break, what would you call
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:31.580]  this historic time we're in right now?
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:36.580]  Well, it's a time of revolution and it's a time of, it's sort of a crossroads time.
[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:40.980]  So it's a time where we are either going to restore sort of the American revolution and
[01:40:40.980 --> 01:40:47.540]  its original principles and reinforce those original principles or we are going to abandon
[01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:48.540]  them.
[01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:49.540]  We're going to walk away from them.
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:50.540]  We're going to lose them.
[01:40:50.540 --> 01:40:55.660]  Basically, not only economically is there a U.S.-China competition to dominate manufacturing
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:41:00.380]  in the world, there's an idea competition between the U.S. model and the Chinese model.
[01:41:00.380 --> 01:41:02.700]  And the Chinese model is a status model.
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:07.940]  It's a combined, corporatist-communist model that's driven by the state that allows for
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:12.060]  a certain kind of private enterprise, but only the state-approved, state-sanctioned
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:13.780]  one that promotes state ideas.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:17.020]  Hence, you have the social credit model system that is being instituted.
[01:41:17.020 --> 01:41:22.340]  You had an article today where U.S. universities and U.S. businesses are being used to prop
[01:41:22.340 --> 01:41:26.820]  up and propagate the Chinese surveillance social credit model system, where the Chinese
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:30.340]  are engaged in massive surveillance of their own audience, controlling what their audience
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:34.420]  can think, what they can say, what they can read, what they can review.
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:37.300]  And that's the model that Google and the Big Tech is following right here in the United
[01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:43.700]  States and they're using the U.S. universities, U.S. engineers, U.S. businesses to accomplish
[01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:47.100]  and achieve this in ways that never could have happened on their own.
[01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:48.100]  They couldn't do it on their own.
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:50.180]  They couldn't achieve it or obtain it on their own.
[01:41:50.180 --> 01:41:54.260]  So what's happened is we're competing with not only the Chinese economic model to decimate
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:59.380]  American manufacturing, to decimate American coal mining, to decimate other areas of American
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:03.860]  industry and control over the manufacturing resources for the world, which can impact
[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:05.860]  defense when you're talking about steel, when you're talking about aluminum.
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:08.700]  I want to hit this first when you come back, as you're too informed.
[01:42:08.700 --> 01:42:14.620]  Now, people understand, the Chai comms and the Saudi Arabians fund killing our coal.
[01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:17.140]  Because we've got enough coal for 2,000 years.
[01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:18.460]  It's totally clean.
[01:42:18.460 --> 01:42:21.700]  People don't get why we can't have pipelines, but everybody else can.
[01:42:21.700 --> 01:42:27.580]  They don't get why we can't, because foreign authoritarian regimes have used our openness
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:28.580]  to sell us out.
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:33.660]  So what Robert Barnes is saying is, it's even in BuzzFeed now that China is running
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:36.860]  our universities and that Obama let them do it.
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:38.420]  Trump's rolling that all up.
[01:42:38.420 --> 01:42:41.060]  And so what he's saying is, America isn't perfect.
[01:42:41.060 --> 01:42:43.740]  I used to get annoyed by American flag worship.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:47.860]  I loved America, but I was like, that's kind of idol, you know, like an idol.
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:53.300]  Until you go, wait a minute, we have to idolize something that's a better system, what it's
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:57.940]  what we've got, instead of what they're about to overwrite us with.
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:04.660]  Recent studies and reports have shown that pipes and plumbing are getting clogged and
[01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:08.820]  backed up with human waste and debris.
[01:43:08.820 --> 01:43:14.500]  This is from people flushing things that aren't meant to be flushed, like baby wipes and feminine
[01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:17.660]  products and safe sex products.
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:21.860]  And so this is resulting in pipes being backed up and clogged.
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:27.100]  Well, just like plumbing gets clogged and just like pipes get clogged, the human body
[01:43:27.100 --> 01:43:28.860]  gets clogged just like that.
[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:30.980]  And you may be experiencing backup too.
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:36.320]  So if you want some relief, some explosive relief, go to infowarstore.com and get oxy
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:37.320]  powder.
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:40.140]  But let me warn you, this stuff is no joke.
[01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:47.500]  If you're experiencing some cloggage, some backup of your own, oxy powder from infowarstore.com
[01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:50.580]  will clear it out guaranteed.
[01:43:50.580 --> 01:43:58.380]  So go to infowarstore.com, take care of your clogged plumbing with oxy powder.
[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:05.740]  What you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the Western world's history.
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:19.380]  This is a digital, AI enforced gag order, not to say the name Alex Jones, or infowars.com.
[01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:21.100]  This is Nazi Germany level.
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:22.300]  This is racketeering.
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:23.300]  This is cartels.
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:25.820]  Mr. President, we need your help.
[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:27.700]  We need it now.
[01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:29.340]  You can take on big tech.
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:36.020]  They saw infowars as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:38.300]  populist organization.
[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:43.020]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him
[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:46.300]  off the air, everyone else like dominoes would fall.
[01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:51.220]  The way to fight back is to support infowars now more than ever and make it a standard
[01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.060]  of freedom and free speech.
[01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:58.620]  And they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[01:44:58.620 --> 01:45:04.540]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with prebiotic fiber by infowars
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:05.860]  life.

[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:19.300]  and flax fiber.
[01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:24.460]  Prebiotic fiber is soluble fiber that ferments in the gut to help feed good bacteria, which
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:30.140]  helps you digest food, absorb nutrients, and even support your immune system.

[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:37.420]  clinically studied ingredients.

[01:45:42.380 --> 01:45:49.260]  organic acacia fiber is slowly digested by the good bacteria throughout the entire colon
[01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:51.980]  for maximum prebiotic effect.

[01:45:58.460 --> 01:46:02.340]  Our grandparents, our great grandparents knew that they canned food during the fall, so they'd
[01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:03.340]  have it during the winter.
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:07.460]  And that's what I'm talking about at infowarstore.com.
[01:46:07.460 --> 01:46:13.540]  With infowars select, it's the full spectrum of my patriots supply on the top, most respected
[01:46:13.540 --> 01:46:19.620]  companies out there, but because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:22.220]  that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:46:22.220 --> 01:46:26.500]  But I want to be a market leader, and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total
[01:46:26.500 --> 01:46:27.500]  win-win.

[01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:40.540]  month supplies, your supplies, weak emergency supplies, they've got so many great products
[01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:41.540]  there.
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:42.540]  Have you got a three-year supply?
[01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:44.580]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:47.140]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:52.340]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together, with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:46:52.340 --> 01:47:00.940]  infowarstore.com and infowars select, high-quality storeable foods, powered by my patriots supply.
[01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:27.140]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:34.340]  One day through Friday, the most banned, demonized line about broadcast in the world is live.
[01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:38.740]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and I'm just a common sense guy that loves America and loves
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:41.020]  freedom and loves you.
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:44.780]  I don't see you winning as me losing.
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:50.700]  I see it as a non-zero sum game, an expanding pie, but the sociopaths that run the planet,
[01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:51.700]  they do see it as that.
[01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:58.340]  Robert Barnes, you're a famous civil rights lawyer that actually goes out when the cops
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:02.860]  are the wrong thing or whatever it goes after, but you've pointed out that the whole modern
[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:06.860]  thing is about creating divisions, not about actually stopping institutional corruption
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:11.100]  or racism, and it's actually causing it to flower, which is what the system admits in
[01:48:11.100 --> 01:48:15.020]  WikiLeaks from Hillary is what they want.
[01:48:15.020 --> 01:48:19.740]  But you this morning, before you came on, an hour before you came on, we were having
[01:48:19.740 --> 01:48:24.700]  a meeting this morning about who we're getting ready to sue, and it's a long list.
[01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:27.380]  And we don't want to do this, but we have to, folks, for the first amendment, it's just
[01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:28.380]  the right thing to do.
[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:29.380]  So thanks for your support.
[01:48:29.380 --> 01:48:33.020]  Only you, and power, is like to have the force to do this.
[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:38.980]  You wanted to get into a newswars.com article that's also on infowars.com that people should
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:40.900]  really spread.
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:46.460]  Groups invite white women to voluntarily attend race-shaming dinners, and we'll get
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:51.780]  this in a few minutes and show for TV viewers the actual graphics, the videos of a black
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:53.980]  woman crying.
[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:58.940]  The idea that you never committed this crime, and black folks are fighting to get into this
[01:48:58.940 --> 01:49:03.700]  country from all over the world, but you are inherently bad because you're white.
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:10.060]  That is the essence of prejudging someone, the essence of racism, and Martin Luther
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:13.420]  King saying, don't judge somebody with a color of skin, but the character of their
[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:16.460]  teeth, that flies in the face of it, but it wasn't Martin Luther King first said that,
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:19.340]  it was the Bible, judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:20.940]  So you wanted to get into this.
[01:49:20.940 --> 01:49:28.500]  We've always heard about these FBI tapes of, and Cointel Pro of Martin Luther King having
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:33.380]  sex with women, and then maybe they say he made a joke when somebody said that some woman
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:35.740]  claimed he raped him.
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:36.740]  There's no tape.
[01:49:36.740 --> 01:49:37.740]  There's no release.
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:38.940]  There's no nothing.
[01:49:38.940 --> 01:49:41.340]  The point is we saw this with Kavanaugh.
[01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:43.940]  They admitted that was all fake.
[01:49:43.940 --> 01:49:49.940]  So why would the left that's always defended Martin Luther King, now that they're totally
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:55.100]  taken over, suddenly say, and they're taking him down at universities and everywhere.
[01:49:55.100 --> 01:50:02.580]  I mean, this is sick and it ties into this model where they get you to go denounce yourself
[01:50:02.580 --> 01:50:04.900]  and you declare you're a racist and then wear that lead.
[01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:06.660]  So this is very sophisticated.
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:09.300]  It has a lot of facets, but let's get into it.
[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:10.300]  Absolutely.
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:13.180]  The church that they're actually showing at right here is Martin Luther King's last
[01:50:13.180 --> 01:50:14.780]  ever speech.
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:15.780]  It was there in Memphis.
[01:50:15.780 --> 01:50:19.860]  I was actually in that church for the commemoration of his speech for the opening of the Civil
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:20.860]  Rights Museum.
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:21.860]  You're from Tennessee.
[01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:25.380]  I'm from Tennessee at the Lorraine Motel, which they brilliantly converted the scene
[01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:30.740]  of his assassination into a memorial recognizing his life, recognizing his history, recognizing
[01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:31.900]  his reputation.
[01:50:31.900 --> 01:50:35.780]  As a kid, I bought all of his speeches on little tapes, audio tapes that I would listen
[01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:37.020]  to all the time.
[01:50:37.020 --> 01:50:41.380]  So this is what's unique about Martin Luther King was that he was a racial unifier, that
[01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:45.500]  his appeal to civil rights wasn't based on, hey, I'm black, give me civil rights.
[01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:46.500]  It was, I'm an American.
[01:50:46.500 --> 01:50:48.660]  And that's the real reason I killed him.
[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:49.660]  Absolutely.
[01:50:49.660 --> 01:50:54.500]  So he was such a unifying figure across classes, across races, and he was appealing to the
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.260]  deepest part of Americana.
[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:58.580]  He didn't say give me rights because I came from Africa.
[01:50:58.580 --> 01:51:00.820]  He didn't say give me rights because I was once a slave.
[01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:04.140]  He didn't say give me rights because I had these bad things happen to me in the past.
[01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:06.380]  He said, give me rights because I'm an American.
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:09.900]  And as an American, we should all have the same rights and be treated equally.
[01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:13.180]  Let me sit where I want to sit, eat where I want to eat, drink where I want to drink.
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:15.060]  Do that because I'm an American.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:17.220]  And that's a unifying message.
[01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:20.860]  And nobody that had any values could disagree with that.
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:21.860]  Absolutely.
[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:24.100]  Nobody who deeply loves America could disagree with that.
[01:51:24.100 --> 01:51:28.540]  Now for those people who don't like America and don't want an appeal to a unifying message,
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:31.380]  that's why first they started attacking King by saying, well, you know, he said things
[01:51:31.380 --> 01:51:33.260]  on gay rights that we don't agree with.
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:35.900]  Well, Martin Luther King was deeply rooted in the evangelical Christian Christian.
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:36.900]  He was a Republican.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:37.900]  Absolutely.
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:38.900]  And hasn't he was?
[01:51:38.900 --> 01:51:44.180]  He was politically, historically, but also his ideology was rooted in a deep humanitarianism.
[01:51:44.180 --> 01:51:49.780]  So it was to be appealed that his poor people's march was for poor people all across the world.
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:54.860]  It didn't limit itself to any particular group by color or by gender or by sexual orientation.
[01:51:54.860 --> 01:51:57.060]  But that was their first attack and they didn't go anywhere.
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:52:00.100]  So their next level of attack, I mean, ask yourself, these tapes and information.
[01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:04.060]  The left is openly trying to discredit Martin Luther King.
[01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:05.060]  Exactly.
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:07.540]  This shows how crazy the left has got.
[01:52:07.540 --> 01:52:12.140]  King is probably the biggest threat to their divisive message of anybody in our public
[01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:13.140]  lexicon.
[01:52:13.140 --> 01:52:18.900]  Oh, that's why I've been, I used to quote him once a month, every hour, because, I mean,
[01:52:18.900 --> 01:52:20.740]  they have to take him out.
[01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:21.740]  Correct.
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:23.900]  And now they're floating made up, Cohen, Kelpro.
[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:28.100]  Now the left loves the FBI that was targeting black leaders.
[01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:29.300]  These are sick people.
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:32.180]  And people should ask, here you have these tapes that are not supposed to be publicly
[01:52:32.180 --> 01:52:37.180]  available in 2027 because of questions and doubts about their authenticity, questions
[01:52:37.180 --> 01:52:39.540]  and doubts about whether they were recorded accurately, whether there's,
[01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:43.860]  You can make a 20 second clip for 10 years and put it in Adobe and make people say whatever
[01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:44.860]  they want.
[01:52:44.860 --> 01:52:45.860]  Exactly.
[01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:48.020]  Then somehow it leaks out through the archives.
[01:52:48.020 --> 01:52:52.180]  Somebody at the archives division somehow puts up these particular tapes, only the ones
[01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:53.540]  that make him look bad.
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:54.740]  And I want to be clear.
[01:52:54.740 --> 01:52:59.060]  I'm not defending it, but if he was having sex with women, doesn't matter.
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:03.980]  He said, we're all equal under God and we should come together and not kill each other.
[01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:05.580]  But see, again, they're threatened by that.
[01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:07.620]  So they're shooping like Kavanaugh.
[01:53:07.620 --> 01:53:08.940]  Oh, that's fake.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:10.060]  I don't believe any of it.
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:13.980]  I've had them edit tapes of me, folks, on Fox News with Megan Kelly.
[01:53:13.980 --> 01:53:17.300]  They didn't show the video because you'd see the jump cuts of me saying Hillary killed
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:22.700]  kids in a basement and all the stuff I didn't say edited together and they aired it.
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:23.700]  Absolutely.
[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:25.900]  I mean, media matters has done that routinely and repeatedly.
[01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:28.740]  And the only way they get away with it is they link the actual video underneath and
[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:31.020]  nobody ever actually watches the original video.
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:32.020]  So this is what's happening.
[01:53:32.020 --> 01:53:35.540]  Here you have Martin Luther King, probably one of the great without question, one of
[01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:39.420]  the greatest, maybe the greatest American in least of the 20th century, who achieved
[01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:42.660]  extraordinary things in uniting Americans across the world.
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:43.660]  Total icon.
[01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:44.660]  Absolutely.
[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:46.660]  We have more streets named after him than any other person in the world.
[01:53:46.660 --> 01:53:51.140]  And the left is literally tearing his guts out.
[01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:54.940]  And you look at it, it has all the fingerprints of a leftist hit job.
[01:53:54.940 --> 01:54:00.540]  And the law, we'll call it a modus operandi, M.O., someone's pattern of conduct that's
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:02.540]  in the past is who's behind this.
[01:54:02.540 --> 01:54:05.620]  Well, what does the left do whenever there's someone they disagree with, they attack them
[01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:07.740]  personally based on their personal bias.
[01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:09.500]  It was a Democrats didn't like King.
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:10.500]  Exactly.
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:11.620]  And they're doing the exact same thing here.
[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:16.620]  The left is leaking a personal attack and highlighting and promoting the personal attack
[01:54:16.620 --> 01:54:17.620]  on King.
[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:19.740]  I think they thought maybe the right would do so.
[01:54:19.740 --> 01:54:23.260]  Well, the right refused to engage in it because these days King is more of an icon to the
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:28.660]  right than he is to the left because he was a unifying figure and a deeply patriotic American.
[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:32.780]  He was someone he opposed war because he thought that war was not in America's best interest
[01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:35.860]  or Americans best interest and it turned out he was right.
[01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:37.420]  So the that is his basis.
[01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:42.140]  So they're trying to leak negative nasty things about King because they need to remove him
[01:54:42.140 --> 01:54:43.140]  from the lexicon.
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:47.580]  So what communists do all in, in, in, in hard core, absolutely.
[01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.500]  They kill you really are shut you down.
[01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:50.500]  He's dead.
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:51.500]  That's perfect.
[01:54:51.500 --> 01:54:53.260]  He's not the straw man that you weren't.
[01:54:53.260 --> 01:54:54.460]  He's now a Kavanaugh rapist.
[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:55.460]  Exactly.
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:56.460]  Kavanaugh is on a rape.
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:58.980]  They're comparing him to Harvey Weinstein.
[01:54:58.980 --> 01:55:00.780]  That's how insane this is.
[01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:04.060]  They're saying that Martin Luther King was the Harvey Weinstein of history.
[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:06.060]  That is, that is a ridiculous and prepositional.
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:13.500]  Well, that shows they've gone completely psychotic because what King said was true, whether what
[01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:14.620]  they're saying about him is true.
[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:16.500]  I don't buy a damn because I've been there so many lies.
[01:55:16.500 --> 01:55:17.500]  I don't believe damn thing they say.
[01:55:17.500 --> 01:55:18.500]  Right.
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:19.500]  Plus they have no proof.
[01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:21.020]  It just makes me like King even more.
[01:55:21.020 --> 01:55:22.020]  Absolutely.
[01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:26.260]  And when I heard this, my first reaction was I, anybody should be shocked at someone's
[01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:28.100]  privacy being invaded in this man.
[01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.100]  Yeah.
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:31.820]  He supposedly in hotel rooms and they record it under the bed.
[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:32.820]  Exactly.
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:35.780]  And they're sharing it with a wide range of people and making jokes about it internally
[01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:37.380]  and their commentary about it.
[01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:40.060]  This is what should be shocking is that this ever existed.
[01:55:40.060 --> 01:55:42.020]  And notice the feminists are attacking you now.
[01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:43.260]  Oh, these people.
[01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:47.260]  Any person taped in their most private intimate thoughts anywhere in the world over their
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:48.260]  entire lifetimes.
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:49.260]  Out of context.
[01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:51.500]  Exactly. They're going to have things in there that they don't like and they can be
[01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:54.100]  misconstrued and misinterpreted and misapplied.
[01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:57.540]  And the idea that, for example, if he did any of these bad things, why didn't any women
[01:55:57.540 --> 01:55:59.380]  ever complain ever during the time period?
[01:55:59.380 --> 01:56:00.380]  Never happened.
[01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:01.380]  But 50 years later.
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.380]  Right.
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:03.380]  You could be in the grave.
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:05.980]  I could be in the grave and they just say he's a rapist.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:10.300]  In fact, it appears they've timed the leak of this through the National Archives to correspond
[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:12.380]  to when everybody who could have been a witness is dead.
[01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:13.660]  So that's what they did.
[01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:16.060]  They waited until everybody was dead who could refute this.
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:19.460]  Then they leak it knowing they can defame him and libel him forevermore.
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:23.260]  And because they need to, because they need the unifying pro-American method of them
[01:56:23.260 --> 01:56:24.260]  okay to be done.
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:25.260]  I can't believe that they're okay to be done.
[01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:26.260]  This is the dirtiest thing I've ever seen.
[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:29.060]  Well, they have gotten this sort of stassy level approach.
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:30.540]  This is, when they see...
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:31.540]  Four shirts just do it.
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:32.540]  Exactly.
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:35.540]  When they look at the Soviet model, they don't look at a model that is horrifying.
[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:39.940]  By the way, Rold Summit Kepler and the Clintons, literally they're behind a production company
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:41.140]  now trying to take me down.
[01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:45.140]  They talk about it, how they want to take me down and bills like hanging over and Hillary's
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:46.140]  hanging over them.
[01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:47.700]  I mean, it's like Twilight Zone.
[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:48.700]  Oh, completely.
[01:56:48.700 --> 01:56:49.700]  It's their own world.
[01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:51.020]  I mean, she's like a Twilight figure.
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:54.060]  She's like a Stepford wife candidate.
[01:56:54.060 --> 01:56:59.620]  But to do this to someone like King, who is really the most legitimate hero of America
[01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:02.060]  politically, someone the left has celebrated...
[01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:03.060]  Got killed.
[01:57:03.060 --> 01:57:04.060]  Yeah.
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:05.060]  Who died.
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:06.060]  They died for his cause.
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:08.580]  I mean, his last speech, he knew the death threats had been accelerating.
[01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:11.900]  He said, I'm not fearing any man because I've been to the mountaintop and I've seen the
[01:57:11.900 --> 01:57:15.940]  promised land and that promised land was the American constitution being delivered
[01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:19.020]  and you can make up all this stuff, whether it's true or not.
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:21.180]  We know most of his lies.
[01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:22.580]  You can hear in your soul.
[01:57:22.580 --> 01:57:24.940]  He believes that he's real and it's true.
[01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:25.940]  Absolutely.
[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:31.660]  And then now 50 something years after he's dead, he's a rapist with no proof or he supports
[01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:32.660]  rape.
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:33.660]  Bullcrap.
[01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:34.660]  Exactly.
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:35.660]  Bullcrap.
[01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:37.300]  But again, that's from the white supremacist and Polar Stokes.
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:38.300]  You know how we are.
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:40.700]  You heard CNN, you heard Tom Brokaw.
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:43.020]  I'm a deeply alloyed racist.
[01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:44.020]  Yeah.
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:45.020]  Right.
[01:57:45.020 --> 01:57:52.180]  Everybody knows that supplements are amazing, that what God gave us from other nature is
[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:53.180]  incredible.
[01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:56.380]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world and the globalists are
[01:57:56.380 --> 01:57:57.780]  so upset.
[01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:03.460]  The problem is people forget to take them and that's why the whole industry has moved

[01:59:52.020 --> 02:00:11.060]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:43:50.680 --> 02:00:42.160]  now baby, like a darkened dream.
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:44.660]  Tell us me by the clamor now baby, like a tough stream.
[02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:46.660]  Now I've been smoking for so long, you know I'm here to say.
[02:00:46.660 --> 02:00:49.900]  Got you in the strangle of baby, you're basking out of the way.
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:59.740]  During the break, Bob Barnes was watching a two-minute clip for TV viewers that shows
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:03.860]  Biden's latest groping, there's some new videos of him, uncontrollably groping little
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:05.260]  girls telling them they're pretty.
[02:01:05.260 --> 02:01:11.140]  You got an interesting term you used for it, we'll talk about next segment, we'll play
[02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:19.020]  that clip again for the full radio and TV audience but we're not just mechanically defending
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:20.500]  Martin Luther King.
[02:01:20.500 --> 02:01:23.420]  Martin Luther King has been dead what, 50 something years?
[02:01:23.420 --> 02:01:25.540]  Oh yeah, 1968 was when he was killed.
[02:01:25.540 --> 02:01:26.540]  How long is that?
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:28.420]  That's 51 years now.
[02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:30.780]  So it was 51 years at last April?
[02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:38.940]  He's been dead 51 years and then they just say all this is going on with this whole,
[02:01:38.940 --> 02:01:44.860]  and now they're saying like you said he's the new Harvey Weinstein with no proof.
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:48.700]  That's why we have statute of limitations, why we have all this and you brought up group
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:54.860]  invites white women because there's the other side of this to voluntarily attend race shaming
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:02:02.400]  dinners, this is newswars.com, spread this article folks, a group headed by a former congressional
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:05.860]  candidate is offering private dinners and again this article is important but this is
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:11.500]  just part of the course, exclusively to white women where they are lectured about how racist
[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:15.580]  and supremacist they are even if they don't realize it.
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:22.020]  So this is just sensitivity training which is race-based brainwashing and then it shows,
[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:27.220]  we can show the article, it has graphics in it, crying black women saying just because
[02:02:27.220 --> 02:02:33.420]  you're a woman doesn't mean you're as special as I, you then compete to be a greater victim
[02:02:33.420 --> 02:02:39.860]  and your whole world is about how you're this poor baby cake and it's, and then meanwhile
[02:02:39.860 --> 02:02:44.500]  blacks are fighting from all over the world to get here, you've got New York Times, you
[02:02:44.500 --> 02:02:48.500]  know board members saying whites are subhuman, they're really trying to convert minorities
[02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:54.380]  into foaming at the mouth racist who feel good about it, not even racist from a superiority
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:59.060]  perspective but racist because you've enslaved me perspective and then you've got people
[02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:02.540]  adopting this, what do you think in the two minutes we have to break the end game here
[02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:03.540]  is Robert Barnes?
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:07.100]  Well what you see is that they're looking historically and you look at King, King was
[02:03:07.100 --> 02:03:11.140]  able to be a counterbalance to the black panthers who are mostly basically just gang members
[02:03:11.140 --> 02:03:16.600]  disguised as a political organization who use the political excuse to commit crime with
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:20.660]  immunity and impunity, it's what radicalized David Horowitz, David Horowitz used to be
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:24.500]  a hardcore lefty, now he's one of the leaders of the intellectual political right and the
[02:03:24.500 --> 02:03:27.420]  reason for that is because of the horrors he witnessed with what the black panthers
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:32.300]  did in San Francisco, kidnapping, other forms of violent crime, extortion, etc.
[02:03:32.300 --> 02:03:36.100]  And so what you see with King is King presents a historical counter narrative to the leftist
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:41.100]  agenda, it's a unifying agenda, it's an American rooted agenda, it's a constitutional
[02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:45.220]  tradition based agenda, King was very much about unifying people, unifying people in
[02:03:45.220 --> 02:03:50.820]  the name of a conservative tradition in general and by appealing to our constitutional history
[02:03:50.820 --> 02:03:55.940]  and by particularly saying all and very patriotic that because I'm an American, I'm because
[02:03:55.940 --> 02:03:59.420]  I'm a man, I should have the same rights as all men and as all Americans.
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:05.180]  It was not a reparations based appeal, it was not a victim based appeal, it was not
[02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:11.060]  a poor me pity me appeal, it was not a give me special rights appeal, it was give me
[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:16.460]  equal rights appeal because it rooted in Americanism and rooted in constitutionalism.
[02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:21.860]  You can't achieve these sort of shame dinners where you're combining basically specialty
[02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:29.060]  diversity training with a censorship confessional inquisitorial model of let's tell everybody
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:33.340]  about how horrible person you are because this is 50 shades of gray, this is come get
[02:04:33.340 --> 02:04:34.340]  beat up.
[02:04:34.340 --> 02:04:37.860]  Exactly, you're 50 shades of white, confess how terrible you are in the net world, Martin
[02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:41.340]  Luther King can't exist because Martin Luther King presents a counter narrative that says
[02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:43.540]  we're all great because we're Americans.
[02:04:43.540 --> 02:04:44.540]  What's that term you use?
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:47.040]  Just any means?
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:51.140]  They will use any means possible for any purpose possible to achieve their destruction
[02:04:51.140 --> 02:04:52.140]  of their agenda.
[02:04:52.140 --> 02:04:55.940]  If that means the propagation of their agenda means destruction of individuals, they do
[02:04:55.940 --> 02:04:56.940]  it.
[02:04:56.940 --> 02:05:00.140]  And forwardstore.com is how you support us and it's not like we're selling stuff you
[02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:05.820]  don't need, you don't want, the air in the average American home is filled with toxins
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:09.660]  that put it on par with a major city.
[02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:13.100]  There's some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:14.860]  How can I solve that problem?
[02:05:14.860 --> 02:05:19.740]  So we have air filters at infowarstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now
[02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:28.580]  $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter technology.
[02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:31.500]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:34.820]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[02:05:34.820 --> 02:05:39.260]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five star reviews for yourself.
[02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:41.260]  I've got two in my home.
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:46.420]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your
[02:05:46.420 --> 02:05:47.420]  house.
[02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:52.060]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[02:05:52.060 --> 02:05:53.060]  Have clean air.
[02:05:53.060 --> 02:06:12.740]  Go to infowarstore.com Live, raw and unfiltered, it's the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:30.500]  All right, I want to give the number out and I want to take your calls for constitutional
[02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:37.540]  lawyer, civil rights lawyer, Robert Bonds on Alex Jones, but specifically on what's
[02:06:37.540 --> 02:06:42.260]  happening with the attempt with all these fake investigations against Trump, what you
[02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:46.020]  think ought to happen listeners, Trump going on the offense, what's that going to look
[02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:48.700]  like, how will the deep state strike back?
[02:06:48.700 --> 02:06:50.380]  All the left is race baiting.
[02:06:50.380 --> 02:06:54.460]  Maybe Jared Kushner goes to Bilderberg, I think Judge Treybyte's fruits, I mean, Trump
[02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:57.540]  goes to these other globalist confabs that we're taking these over.
[02:06:57.540 --> 02:07:00.380]  We were just exposing Bilderberg and it was going on.
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:01.820]  World government's out in the open now.
[02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:13.420]  But give me your take on all of that, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, just address your question
[02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:22.260]  to Robert Barnes, 877-789-2539 on this live global Friday edition.
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:25.660]  By the way, I'll be back Sunday, four to six p.m.
[02:07:25.660 --> 02:07:27.540]  Maybe you can host me.
[02:07:27.540 --> 02:07:28.540]  Sure.
[02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:29.540]  Everybody loves you, Bob.
[02:07:29.540 --> 02:07:30.540]  You're great.
[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:33.540]  You'll be with us for two hours on Sunday as well at the war room coming up three o'clock
[02:07:33.540 --> 02:07:34.540]  today.
[02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:38.860]  Nick Baggage hosts the fourth hour as well, but I want to take your calls.
[02:07:38.860 --> 02:07:43.900]  There's so much news, though, and we're just getting into Martin Luther King.
[02:07:43.900 --> 02:07:49.540]  We're going to Joe Biden here, but like you were saying during the break, it's the collectively
[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:55.540]  only tune into media like MSNBC and CNN that defends the system.
[02:07:55.540 --> 02:07:57.100]  And so they're in true echo chambers.
[02:07:57.100 --> 02:07:58.740]  I go and see what my enemies are saying.
[02:07:58.740 --> 02:07:59.740]  I go and see.
[02:07:59.740 --> 02:08:02.500]  I don't even really care what people that are supporting me say.
[02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:03.500]  They're great.
[02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:04.500]  I love you.
[02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:06.000]  You're like oxygen.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.140]  But I don't want an echo chamber.
[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:10.500]  I'm trying to see what they're saying about me so I know what's going on or what they're
[02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:11.500]  up to.
[02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:12.980]  But I look at these establishment people.
[02:08:12.980 --> 02:08:15.820]  They are in their own bubble.
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:18.500]  Pelosi's a stammering idiot for five years at least.
[02:08:18.500 --> 02:08:20.860]  AOC's a complete moron.
[02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:25.140]  Now they say in any videos criticizing Pelosi, you've got to be taken down.
[02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:31.140]  Biden can't keep his hands off other men's wives, children.
[02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:32.300]  Then he tries to spin it.
[02:08:32.300 --> 02:08:33.780]  Now there's a new video out.
[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:37.700]  Don't play this compilation and then we'll play the new video for radio listeners.
[02:08:37.700 --> 02:08:38.700]  We'll kind of go through it.
[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:42.540]  But you've all seen the footage, but this is compulsive.
[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:44.220]  This is neurotic.
[02:08:44.220 --> 02:08:47.980]  I dated a really nice lady that was a paralegal.
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:53.260]  She later became a lawyer when I was growing up in Dallas and I knew when I was in college.
[02:08:53.260 --> 02:08:58.180]  She was a few years older than me and she would just tell me the joke about her boss
[02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:01.780]  who had all these letters and was this big lawyer and made all this money.
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:04.900]  But occasionally he would eat boogers in front of you.
[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:06.380]  He would just pull a booger out.
[02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:07.380]  He couldn't help it.
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:08.380]  He'd eat it.
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:10.940]  He kind of sneak it, but he ate it.
[02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:13.540]  And she would make jokes about it and one time I went to dinner with him and he ate
[02:09:13.540 --> 02:09:14.540]  the booger in front of him.
[02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:15.540]  In front of his wife.
[02:09:15.540 --> 02:09:16.540]  He ate a booger.
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:19.220]  Now, I'm not being funny here.
[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:23.540]  That's a little level of psychosis and insanity.
[02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:28.620]  Imagine you're Joe Biden and people walk up and they're grabbing little kids, rubbing,
[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:29.620]  smelling them.
[02:09:29.620 --> 02:09:33.140]  Like if it was your uncle and you're doing to the dog, that's a little, you know, creepy.
[02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:35.020]  Yeah, there's footage of people eating boogers.
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:36.540]  It's some kind of elitist thing.
[02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:37.540]  George W. does it too.
[02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:39.540]  I quit doing it when I was about three.
[02:09:39.540 --> 02:09:42.260]  I have a rare memory of about three and like I ate a booger.
[02:09:42.260 --> 02:09:43.260]  It's got like sand in it.
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:44.260]  Like God, that tastes bad.
[02:09:44.260 --> 02:09:45.260]  I'm gonna stop eating those.
[02:09:45.260 --> 02:09:47.900]  But, but, but seriously, I've eaten boogers.
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:48.900]  I just admitted it.
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:49.900]  So it's a tell all.
[02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:53.820]  Maybe I should go to this, this group initiates white women and say they're racist and bad.
[02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:56.300]  I should know that men have eaten boogers at age three.
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:10:01.700]  But Bob, I'm taking you to the next level here.
[02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:05.780]  But seriously, Pelosi, Biden, we're going to play these clips.
[02:10:05.780 --> 02:10:07.020]  What do you make of this?
[02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:11.980]  So with Biden, it is, it's a compulsive behavior and it's quasi pedophilia behavior.
[02:10:11.980 --> 02:10:16.300]  I mean, if you look at where he's moving his hands on little girl's bodies, I'm sorry,
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:17.300]  that's not normal.
[02:10:17.300 --> 02:10:19.140]  That's not like, it's what you do to your wife.
[02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:23.940]  If you think she's in the mood to get her in bed, it's very like it's very sexualized,
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:25.060]  very sexualized behavior.
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:27.980]  This is not normal behavior by any stretch of the imagination.
[02:10:27.980 --> 02:10:31.220]  People said, oh, it's just like your weird uncle, and I was like, well, if your creepy
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:33.420]  uncle has been convicted of pedophilia, maybe.
[02:10:33.420 --> 02:10:35.860]  I mean, that's the kind of behavior that it is.
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:39.700]  And the fact that he can't stop doing it, even though it's been a become high profile,
[02:10:39.700 --> 02:10:42.860]  and the fact that he does it repeatedly when he knows the cameras are on him gives you
[02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:44.900]  a sense of how compulsive it is.
[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:50.140]  I mean, it's like he cannot control himself, cannot stop himself, cannot prevent himself
[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:54.420]  from doing the behavior that all of us should be deeply disturbed and unsettled by.
[02:10:54.420 --> 02:10:55.420]  This is not normal.
[02:10:55.420 --> 02:10:58.460]  This is another attempt to normalize bad behavior.
[02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:01.980]  But the media's attempt to brush over this, the media's attempt to excuse it, the media's
[02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:06.340]  attempt to justify it is like Vox and Salon trying to say, well, pedophiles are normal
[02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:08.540]  and they just have maybe a little mental issue.
[02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:13.260]  No, they're perverts who present an imminent threat of danger to young children.
[02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:17.100]  And Biden's behavior is obsessive and it's compulsive in a way that is dangerous for
[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:20.660]  a public politician who's been in the public eye to continue to do the...
[02:11:20.660 --> 02:11:22.220]  Well, we're not even showing the bad footage.
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:25.780]  It was during the break you saw when we were running, it was really powerful.
[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:29.180]  And there's a new video we can show in a minute, we'll play the audio, where he tells the
[02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:30.700]  young girl, man, you're really pretty.
[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:31.700]  Oh, exactly.
[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:35.460]  Now, I mean, again, if I had an uncle or a cousin with one of my daughters rubbing them
[02:11:35.460 --> 02:11:40.660]  like that saying, you really are pretty, I'd say, hey, do I need to break your neck?
[02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:41.660]  Are you a pervert or something?
[02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:44.500]  I mean, obviously, well, actually, people turned a blind eye to this.
[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:45.500]  I had...
[02:11:45.500 --> 02:11:51.900]  Well, I have family friends and about 10 years ago, I'm at this party and this guy was married
[02:11:51.900 --> 02:11:54.260]  to my friend's sister.
[02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:58.660]  And the dude was hitting on the 14-year-old girl right in front of me.
[02:11:58.660 --> 02:12:04.540]  And I said to my friend, I said, you know, he's hitting on this little girl.
[02:12:04.540 --> 02:12:05.900]  This was his uncle's daughter or whatever.
[02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:07.420]  He said, oh, no, it's fine.
[02:12:07.420 --> 02:12:10.900]  Later it turned out he had sex with her, all this stuff, about a month later.
[02:12:10.900 --> 02:12:12.420]  But it's just, it's crazy.
[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:13.420]  Oh, exactly.
[02:12:13.420 --> 02:12:15.580]  I mean, when I've seen that behavior, I've cussed it out when I've been at weddings or
[02:12:15.580 --> 02:12:19.380]  other events, we have somebody that's there that you don't want and that you is not part
[02:12:19.380 --> 02:12:21.340]  of your family or anything else.
[02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:24.460]  This behavior is just completely unacceptable behavior, called out to behavior.
[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:25.460]  So the idea...
[02:12:25.460 --> 02:12:26.460]  Well, it's incredibly obvious.
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:27.460]  Exactly.
[02:12:27.460 --> 02:12:28.300]  I mean, this behavior is not...
[02:12:28.300 --> 02:12:30.860]  This is not trying to make a kid comfortable.
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:31.860]  This is not...
[02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:34.180]  It's not even Michael Jackson behavior, right?
[02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:36.020]  I mean, Michael Jackson was more...
[02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:39.100]  He wanted to be a 12-year-old kid hanging out with someone.
[02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:42.300]  This is deliberately touchy, hand-to-hand.
[02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:45.420]  And he does this control thing where he holds them and he rubs their cheeks.
[02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:46.420]  He does it in...
[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:47.420]  I mean, I've got three daughters.
[02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:50.940]  I've never sat there and I held them and I tried rubbing them and just like...
[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:55.140]  Well, it sort of reminds me of the Quentin Tarantino Pulp Fiction dialogue.
[02:12:55.140 --> 02:12:58.300]  That's completely sexual the way he just rubbed her cheeks.
[02:12:58.300 --> 02:12:59.300]  Completely.
[02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:02.900]  Like, they're describing in the Quentin Tarantino's movie Pulp Fiction about why you wouldn't
[02:13:02.900 --> 02:13:06.220]  necessarily give a foot massage to somebody else's wife because of certain things.
[02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:07.220]  The things he's doing is even more intimate.
[02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:08.220]  Exactly.
[02:13:08.220 --> 02:13:11.140]  There's certain things that are just as intimate as...
[02:13:11.140 --> 02:13:12.140]  Just look at the...
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:13.140]  Throwing down on your wife.
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:14.140]  I mean, seriously.
[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:17.420]  I mean, like, your wife better be in the right mood when you do that under the cheek thing.
[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:19.060]  I mean, this is like seriously...
[02:13:19.060 --> 02:13:20.060]  Correct.
[02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:21.060]  This is like very intimate.
[02:13:21.060 --> 02:13:22.060]  Because it's invasive.
[02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:28.260]  It can be invasive because it's so intimate that if it's not welcome or not wanted, you
[02:13:28.260 --> 02:13:29.260]  better know.
[02:13:29.260 --> 02:13:30.260]  And all of these things...
[02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:31.260]  Yeah, so let's be clear.
[02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:35.740]  Your wife, you've had sex with 500 times, 1,000 times, if you don't do it just right
[02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:38.340]  at the right time, the way he's doing this, they would reject it.
[02:13:38.340 --> 02:13:39.340]  This is very sexual.
[02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:40.340]  Correct.
[02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:41.340]  Exactly.
[02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:43.980]  Because otherwise, it's invasive because that's the nature of true intimacy.
[02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:46.740]  It's invasive if it's not approved, if it's not consensual.
[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:49.340]  And the way to look at it is if you look at this behavior, is this something you would
[02:13:49.340 --> 02:13:51.420]  do with your wife or your girlfriend, or would it be something...
[02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:53.220]  And the kids are always trying to get away.
[02:13:53.220 --> 02:13:54.220]  And look, he's...
[02:13:54.220 --> 02:13:57.580]  Just like drag queen story time, where they're convicted pedophiles, they don't even tell
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:14:01.140]  the parents, they bring the kids in and set them on these guys' laps, and the kids are
[02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:02.140]  fighting to get away.
[02:14:02.140 --> 02:14:03.140]  The other thing is...
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:04.140]  Look at that.
[02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:05.140]  Grabbing them by the arm.
[02:14:05.140 --> 02:14:06.500]  Not only that, it's almost disproportionately girls.
[02:14:06.500 --> 02:14:07.500]  Like the original excuse...
[02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:08.980]  Oh, is there any video boys?
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:10.220]  Almost none.
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:15.060]  And that gives you a sign, like, I mean, like, here, notice he doesn't do that to the boy.
[02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:16.060]  Right?
[02:14:16.060 --> 02:14:17.060]  So he knows of this difference.
[02:14:17.060 --> 02:14:18.300]  He knows of this distinction.
[02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:23.460]  So the, this is not, it's not just the hair sniffing routine with everybody's wife.
[02:14:23.460 --> 02:14:28.100]  You know, to be honest with you, that I would find, you know, an irritating, but I wouldn't
[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:29.100]  find a...
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:32.940]  If I was good buddies with somebody, and they kissed my wife on the cheek or patted her
[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:37.620]  on the ass, I'd still be like, okay, he's just familiar, and he kind of, but somebody
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:39.460]  you don't know would be like, hey dude, what are you doing?
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:42.940]  But if they did that to my daughter when she was that age, it would be a different reaction.
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:47.060]  Well, sure, but he does that to like full grown women, he'll grab them and set them
[02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:48.540]  on his lap and dudes get pissed.
[02:14:48.540 --> 02:14:49.860]  I mean, there is rubbing a breast.
[02:14:49.860 --> 02:14:50.860]  Yeah.
[02:14:50.860 --> 02:14:52.860]  I mean, that, that, I'm sorry, there's nothing about that, that's normal.
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:54.340]  He never does that to any boy.
[02:14:54.340 --> 02:14:56.340]  So this isn't some like weird thing he grew up with.
[02:14:56.340 --> 02:14:57.860]  So this is an out of control pervert.
[02:14:57.860 --> 02:14:58.860]  Correct.
[02:14:58.860 --> 02:15:00.860]  That's so compulsive in his behavior that even when he knows...
[02:15:00.860 --> 02:15:03.740]  What is the point of the head to him and like the smelling him?
[02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:08.020]  The, that, that for him is his, he loves hair and he's very intimate about the way he does
[02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:09.020]  it.
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:10.020]  And then that's why he's soft.
[02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:11.020]  I mean, notice the soft touch.
[02:15:11.020 --> 02:15:12.820]  I mean, these are not the kind of touches...
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:15.660]  And the other thing is he gets real excited while he's doing it.
[02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:19.580]  If you don't see, like in contrasted to the coverage of Trump with his daughter, like if
[02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:23.900]  Trump just pats his daughter on the back, they say, oh, that's somehow weird or perverted.
[02:15:23.900 --> 02:15:25.300]  This is what's weird and perverted.
[02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:26.300]  Random...
[02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:31.500]  I was about 14 years old and one of my dad's cousins was over and she was good looking,
[02:15:31.500 --> 02:15:32.500]  hot blonde.
[02:15:32.500 --> 02:15:34.300]  She's probably like 30 years old.
[02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:36.900]  And man, her husband was there and I said, we've been out shooting everything as a lawyer.
[02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:41.100]  And I've been out there with her for friends, but man, I slapped her on the ass and it was
[02:15:41.100 --> 02:15:42.100]  sexual.
[02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:43.900]  And he kind of looked at me and said, hey, you better watch it.
[02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:47.620]  She, she laughed, but he was like, and that I'm a 14 year old slapping a full grown woman
[02:15:47.620 --> 02:15:48.620]  on the ass.
[02:15:48.620 --> 02:15:51.700]  And he was kind of like, hey, junior, you better watch it because it was sexual and I couldn't
[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:52.700]  help it.
[02:15:52.700 --> 02:15:53.700]  It's unbelievable.
[02:15:53.700 --> 02:15:55.700]  We'll be right back.

[02:17:00.180 --> 02:17:01.180]  the world.
[02:17:01.180 --> 02:17:04.180]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:10.140]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:13.980]  Since former colony, the U.S. had to save the empire.
[02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:14.980]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:14.980 --> 02:17:16.540]  Who do we fight for?

[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:20.780]  Tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:18:20.780 --> 02:18:25.420]  It tastes like oval fiend, it tastes like oval fiend, it tastes like oval fiend, like
[02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:26.420]  good water.
[02:18:26.420 --> 02:18:28.620]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:34.260]  My daughter uses the, uh, bubblegum, fluoride free toothpaste, um, I'd use the, uh, super
[02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:36.580]  male vitality, a host of other products.
[02:18:36.580 --> 02:18:38.420]  So thank you so much for that as well.
[02:18:38.420 --> 02:18:41.140]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping me on air.
[02:18:41.140 --> 02:18:42.140]  I'm thanking you.
[02:18:42.140 --> 02:18:46.820]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:47.820]  the true bone broth.
[02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:49.220]  It, it, it is next level.
[02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:50.220]  It really is good.
[02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:51.220]  So thank you.
[02:18:51.220 --> 02:18:56.900]  I feel great since I've been taking it, thank you.
[02:18:56.900 --> 02:19:01.900]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman and child that has supported this broadcast

[02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:23.180]  I'm not the leader.
[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:24.180]  You are the leader.
[02:19:24.180 --> 02:19:26.020]  When you take action, nothing stops you.

[02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:59.580]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible, God bless you.
[02:19:59.580 --> 02:20:06.580]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:29.580 --> 02:20:36.940]  You found it, the program, the Clintons, the Chad Cums once shut down.
[02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:38.620]  Thanks to you standing with us.
[02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:39.620]  We're still here.
[02:20:39.620 --> 02:20:40.620]  Thank you.
[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:41.620]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:20:41.620 --> 02:20:43.700]  Your phone calls are coming up next segment.
[02:20:43.700 --> 02:20:45.260]  You're in the break.
[02:20:45.260 --> 02:20:51.380]  I was back in the coffee room where somebody bought donuts and I just inhaled two of them.
[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:55.860]  Stop it, even though I appreciate it.
[02:20:55.860 --> 02:21:00.580]  I was back to get a cup of coffee and ate two donuts and I was watching Fox News on
[02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:10.140]  Perino's show and they had a new CBS interview with Bob Barr and the attorney general.
[02:21:10.140 --> 02:21:15.820]  And he's like trying to overthrow a president, lying about it, setting them up, trying to
[02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:18.020]  say that you're going to overthrow an election.
[02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:19.420]  That's the tyranny here.
[02:21:19.420 --> 02:21:21.180]  We shouldn't be talking about impeaching Trump.
[02:21:21.180 --> 02:21:22.180]  There's no evidence.
[02:21:22.180 --> 02:21:24.700]  He said, this whole system is in danger.
[02:21:24.700 --> 02:21:25.700]  It's out of control.
[02:21:25.700 --> 02:21:26.700]  Our DVR crashed.
[02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:27.700]  Maybe we'll have it later.
[02:21:27.700 --> 02:21:31.220]  But I'm sure the clips everywhere, I would just pull up Bob Barr on CBS.
[02:21:31.220 --> 02:21:33.860]  It's all over the place.
[02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:37.300]  Talk about Bob Barr a little bit because I know you've studied him and others and I've
[02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:41.340]  talked to some people that are patriots in the Pentagon and in a three-letter agency
[02:21:41.340 --> 02:21:45.300]  who are actually good people with history of being whistleblowers, some on air from
[02:21:45.300 --> 02:21:46.900]  the CIA, some that haven't been on air.
[02:21:46.900 --> 02:21:50.980]  They said, no, Barr's actually been good for a long time at trying to stabilize things
[02:21:50.980 --> 02:21:52.940]  and actually going after corruption.
[02:21:52.940 --> 02:21:55.060]  Now, maybe that's not entirely true.
[02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:57.420]  I think the jury's still out.
[02:21:57.420 --> 02:22:02.500]  But regardless, what the left's done is so dangerous, even to the power structure, that
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:05.500]  at some level it's got to be dialed back just from their perspective.
[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:07.780]  But here's the Hill article.
[02:22:07.780 --> 02:22:13.900]  Professor who correctly predicted nine presidential elections says Trump will win in 2020 unless
[02:22:13.900 --> 02:22:16.380]  Democrats impeach.
[02:22:16.380 --> 02:22:20.620]  An American University professor quickly predicted the last nine presidential elections says President
[02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:26.420]  Trump will win the 2020 election unless congressional Democrats grow a spine, which he's pushing
[02:22:26.420 --> 02:22:27.420]  him to do.
[02:22:27.420 --> 02:22:33.060]  Alan Lickman, a political historian, said Democrats only have a shot at the White House
[02:22:33.060 --> 02:22:36.100]  and they begin an impeachment proceedings against Trump.
[02:22:36.100 --> 02:22:39.340]  You think that's true and where do you think this goes?
[02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:40.340]  I think Lickman's wrong.
[02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:42.540]  I mean, I think Lickman wants it to be that way.
[02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:46.060]  What it is, Lickman has a subjective component and an objective component because I've studied
[02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:50.540]  all of these because I've been one of the prime successes at betting presidential
[02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:52.020]  politics now going on 20 years.
[02:22:52.020 --> 02:22:54.900]  Well, they say you're the guy that does the biggest bets on presidential elections.
[02:22:54.900 --> 02:22:55.900]  Correct.
[02:22:55.900 --> 02:22:57.900]  I'm the most successful American political better according to the UK time.
[02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:02.380]  So our headlines should be top political better calls 2020.
[02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:03.380]  Correct.
[02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:04.860]  And the 2020 is Trump's going to win.
[02:23:04.860 --> 02:23:08.060]  Like I predicted last year, I said that Trump was trading at two to one.
[02:23:08.060 --> 02:23:10.860]  I said it's a good time to buy him because he'll be at least one to one by the time
[02:23:10.860 --> 02:23:13.300]  2019 rolls around and he already is.
[02:23:13.300 --> 02:23:14.460]  So right now he's the favorite.
[02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:15.780]  He's even money favorite.
[02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:19.000]  Truth is he's in my view a 95% favorite.
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:23.140]  So historically when someone has his economic numbers, when someone has his security around
[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:27.340]  the world, when you have a good economy and a safe country, both of which he has helped
[02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:33.700]  create by his power and his energy and his gravitas up against 20 something crypt keepers.
[02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:34.700]  Exactly.
[02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:37.660]  Not only that second, the second measurement is if the Republican party was meaningfully
[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:38.660]  split.
[02:23:38.660 --> 02:23:41.660]  So if half of his base had turned on him, then he would be in trouble.
[02:23:41.660 --> 02:23:43.300]  His base has completely aligned with him.
[02:23:43.300 --> 02:23:48.420]  He continues to to advocate for the positions that got him elected did so yesterday by imposing
[02:23:48.420 --> 02:23:51.260]  tariffs on Mexico as long as immigration remains a problem.
[02:23:51.260 --> 02:23:55.180]  And Mexico within 24 hours was calling for a conference to discuss how they could meet
[02:23:55.180 --> 02:23:56.700]  the president's objectives.
[02:23:56.700 --> 02:24:00.460]  So you have the North Korea wanting to reignite peace talks.
[02:24:00.460 --> 02:24:04.860]  So he's been, you have China at the table to discuss meaningful trade reform that will
[02:24:04.860 --> 02:24:06.020]  protect American jobs.
[02:24:06.020 --> 02:24:09.740]  So he's done things that other presidents have promised but failed to deliver on.
[02:24:09.740 --> 02:24:14.980]  And so because people just don't have a sense, they know the power structures, pissed a lot
[02:24:14.980 --> 02:24:16.820]  of things have gotten better.
[02:24:16.820 --> 02:24:19.980]  What clearly is trying and that's really all people are looking for.
[02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:20.980]  Absolutely.
[02:24:20.980 --> 02:24:25.700]  And so historically, when the incumbent presidential party is not meaningfully divided, the incumbent
[02:24:25.700 --> 02:24:29.460]  has won every single election in American political history.
[02:24:29.460 --> 02:24:33.020]  The third thing that happens, so you have the economy good, you have the country safe,
[02:24:33.020 --> 02:24:38.180]  you have the party, the party base, happy, excited, want Trump to keep going.
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:42.620]  And the third part is the party in opposition tends to look at their field and say, not
[02:24:42.620 --> 02:24:44.580]  look for who would make the best president.
[02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:48.500]  They look at their field and say, who would make, who's the most politician of the bunch?
[02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:51.340]  So that's how you get Bob Dole in 1996.
[02:24:51.340 --> 02:24:54.100]  That's how you get John Kerry in 2004.
[02:24:54.100 --> 02:24:56.820]  That's how you get Mitt Romney in 2012.
[02:24:56.820 --> 02:25:01.660]  Nobody ever looked at any of those guys and said, oh, that person's so naturally a president.
[02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:04.660]  Instead they looked at him and said, that guy reminds me of a politician.
[02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:05.660]  Exactly.
[02:25:05.660 --> 02:25:07.460]  You look at Trump, you go leadership.
[02:25:07.460 --> 02:25:08.460]  Exactly.
[02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:09.460]  You go, that's president.
[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:11.420]  And the whole world sees it.
[02:25:11.420 --> 02:25:12.420]  That's John Wayne.
[02:25:12.420 --> 02:25:13.420]  I mean, it's like big.
[02:25:13.420 --> 02:25:14.420]  Right.
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:15.420]  And he's delivering.
[02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:16.420]  Exactly.
[02:25:16.420 --> 02:25:19.580]  What happens is the party in opposition feels so much fear over the incumbent.
[02:25:19.580 --> 02:25:21.420]  They think the incumbent's definitely going to win.
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:23.020]  And sometimes it's a conscious fear.
[02:25:23.020 --> 02:25:24.380]  Sometimes it's an unconscious fear.
[02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:26.020]  In Litman's case, it's a conscious fear.
[02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:30.580]  That's why he's advocating for things to make up standards that don't exist to propagate
[02:25:30.580 --> 02:25:34.060]  a different theory of the election when his own data says, I totally agree and everybody
[02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:35.060]  knows Tristan.
[02:25:35.060 --> 02:25:36.060]  They hear it.
[02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:37.220]  So how do they counter strike?
[02:25:37.220 --> 02:25:39.020]  Because they are counter striking.
[02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:43.220]  All the fake investigations, antifa, activated terrorist assassination.
[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:48.300]  If they were smart, they would put a message out there that would persuade the public audience.
[02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:51.220]  They would put a message out there that would re-up Trump and be Trump.
[02:25:51.220 --> 02:25:53.420]  A positive, instead it's only negative.
[02:25:53.420 --> 02:25:54.420]  Correct.
[02:25:54.420 --> 02:25:55.420]  America sucks.
[02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:56.420]  We're all racist.
[02:25:56.420 --> 02:25:57.420]  It's over.
[02:25:57.420 --> 02:25:58.700]  Contrast it to what happened in Sweden.
[02:25:58.700 --> 02:26:02.740]  So Sweden, the party on the left, decided to embrace the most restrictive immigration
[02:26:02.740 --> 02:26:03.980]  reforms in history.
[02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:08.100]  And they were able to regain power because they changed their policies on immigration.
[02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:09.860]  They did what the people wanted.
[02:26:09.860 --> 02:26:10.860]  Exactly.
[02:26:10.860 --> 02:26:15.060]  When Trump went back to his 2015 position on immigration and said it was a Koch brothers
[02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:19.380]  conspiracy to drive down wages in America, then he would actually have a viable chance
[02:26:19.380 --> 02:26:23.540]  against the president in a re-election pit because then his immigration position would
[02:26:23.540 --> 02:26:27.340]  be no different than Trump's and be equally aggressive and then he could pitch his different
[02:26:27.340 --> 02:26:29.700]  ideas to make the world a safer, a better place.
[02:26:29.700 --> 02:26:33.220]  But instead, as long as they're focused on Trump, and this Trump understands, if they're
[02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:35.300]  talking about him, he's winning.
[02:26:35.300 --> 02:26:39.100]  And so if they're talking about impeachment, if they're talking about efforts to take him
[02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:40.100]  out.
[02:26:40.100 --> 02:26:42.140]  If they're taking the oxygen out of their paradigm.
[02:26:42.140 --> 02:26:43.140]  Correct.
[02:26:43.140 --> 02:26:45.460]  The real threat Trump faces right now is not so much from the Democratic Party.
[02:26:45.460 --> 02:26:46.780]  They're dead men walking.
[02:26:46.780 --> 02:26:48.980]  It's the deep state.
[02:26:48.980 --> 02:26:53.420]  The deep state will not accept being targeted for all of their bad conduct and malfeasance
[02:26:53.420 --> 02:27:00.060]  and misfeasance in the 2016 election for their misdeeds during the Mueller inquiry investigation.
[02:27:00.060 --> 02:27:05.580]  Mueller was shot across the bow not to help Democrats, but to help the deep state use
[02:27:05.580 --> 02:27:10.500]  the Democrats in the House in order to counteract the Trump's spy gate inquiry.
[02:27:10.500 --> 02:27:11.940]  That's what all of that is about.
[02:27:11.940 --> 02:27:17.340]  So his biggest adversary right now is it's not Kim in North Korea, it's not China trying
[02:27:17.340 --> 02:27:18.580]  to do what they're doing.
[02:27:18.580 --> 02:27:21.780]  It's not the Democratic Party domestically who are dead men walking.
[02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:23.580]  It is in whatever they say about Nancy Pelosi.
[02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:26.080]  I mean, she looks like a dead person talking.
[02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:27.300]  So it's none of them.
[02:27:27.300 --> 02:27:28.300]  It's the deep state.
[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:30.340]  And that means he needs to go at that too is his enemy.
[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:31.340]  Those are the people sabotaging.
[02:27:31.340 --> 02:27:35.980]  People not getting the agenda through taking papers off his desk, he ordered just totally
[02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:41.580]  constitutional that Brennan loses security clearance, didn't lose it two months ago.
[02:27:41.580 --> 02:27:42.580]  Exactly.
[02:27:42.580 --> 02:27:46.820]  So it's the politicized parts of the spy network that are using that power, I mean,
[02:27:46.820 --> 02:27:50.580]  that led Snowden to become a whistleblower because he saw where it was going even with
[02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:52.340]  the president he liked in Obama.
[02:27:52.340 --> 02:27:54.580]  He realized how dangerous this was going to be politicized.
[02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:55.580]  I totally agree.
[02:27:55.580 --> 02:27:57.300]  Let's go to calls.
[02:27:57.300 --> 02:28:01.860]  Let's get into a worst case scenario and we come back because we've had what four American
[02:28:01.860 --> 02:28:02.860]  presidents assassinated.
[02:28:02.860 --> 02:28:03.860]  There's a five.
[02:28:03.860 --> 02:28:07.740]  I'd have to go back and look, you've had some shot at and some successfully killed.
[02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:09.700]  So the number is very based on that.
[02:28:09.700 --> 02:28:14.980]  Yeah, like exactly like Teddy Roosevelt got shot in the chest, he'll get the speech.
[02:28:14.980 --> 02:28:15.980]  Right.
[02:28:15.980 --> 02:28:16.980]  Reagan got shot.
[02:28:16.980 --> 02:28:17.980]  Survived.
[02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:18.980]  They tried to kill Roosevelt, but he survived.
[02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:22.100]  I think it's four dead, three shot.
[02:28:22.100 --> 02:28:27.380]  Well, if you count the other Jackson, he got shot and stabbed, he wasn't president.
[02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:28.380]  That's true.
[02:28:28.380 --> 02:28:31.300]  Anyways, they're going to try to kill the president.
[02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:32.420]  These globalists don't give up.
[02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:37.580]  And so I think everybody needs to know they can do a truck bomb, say Jihadi's did it.
[02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:40.580]  They've been doing too much positive publicity of people who've done violence on the White
[02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:41.580]  House lawn or near it.
[02:28:41.580 --> 02:28:42.580]  That's right.
[02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:43.580]  They're signaling.
[02:28:43.580 --> 02:28:44.580]  They're greenlighting.
[02:28:44.580 --> 02:28:45.580]  Exactly.
[02:28:45.580 --> 02:28:46.580]  They're triggering it.
[02:28:46.580 --> 02:28:47.580]  They're greenlighting.
[02:28:47.580 --> 02:28:48.580]  Let's talk about worst case scenarios.
[02:28:48.580 --> 02:28:49.980]  And the left's only thinking one dimension.
[02:28:49.980 --> 02:28:53.580]  If you kill him, do you guys have any idea what happens to you?
[02:28:53.580 --> 02:28:55.540]  My God.
[02:28:55.540 --> 02:28:57.140]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.

[02:31:55.620 --> 02:31:59.780]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators.
[02:31:59.780 --> 02:32:00.860]  They are technocrats.
[02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:04.660]  They are control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your
[02:32:04.660 --> 02:32:09.180]  own life and make your own decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge
[02:32:09.180 --> 02:32:10.180]  with AI gods.
[02:32:10.180 --> 02:32:12.380]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace.
[02:32:12.380 --> 02:32:14.980]  We're fighting them hard right here in the 3rd dimension.
[02:32:14.980 --> 02:32:19.020]  One of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control
[02:32:19.020 --> 02:32:21.300]  in our lives is our bodies.
[02:32:21.300 --> 02:32:26.020]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements for the 4slife.com, I couldn't do it.

[02:32:48.900 --> 02:32:59.500]  the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[02:32:59.500 --> 02:33:16.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:22.620]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:45.220]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:45.220 --> 02:33:47.420]  Why are we seeing all this happen?
[02:33:47.420 --> 02:33:53.460]  I've got to tell you, there's a lot of powerful corrupt people in this world, but Hillary
[02:33:53.460 --> 02:34:01.140]  Clinton was able to sycophantically get all these college heads, all these corporate heads
[02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:10.580]  to worship her and still when she goes out on the road and she goes to universities, the
[02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:17.300]  people act like Jesus Christ just landed in a flying saucer.
[02:34:17.300 --> 02:34:22.900]  This is an incredibly boring, stupid, evil woman in my view.
[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:26.420]  She has a criminal intelligence, but that's about it.
[02:34:26.420 --> 02:34:30.820]  Bob Barnes, smart constitutional lawyer, civil rights lawyer.
[02:34:30.820 --> 02:34:33.420]  What do you think the mystery of Hillary Clinton is?
[02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:40.660]  Just briefly, I want to go to calls and what happens if they do successfully assassinate
[02:34:40.660 --> 02:34:44.300]  Trump and what are other wildcards?
[02:34:44.300 --> 02:34:48.820]  As you've said a year ago, and now it's being borne out by political analysts and others,
[02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:54.300]  Trump's 95% chance is going to win, so the Democrats' only desperate measure is to try
[02:34:54.300 --> 02:34:58.020]  to impeach even though that makes him more likely to win.
[02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:05.860]  Instead of giving up, they just lie even more, bully even more, and that doesn't make people
[02:35:05.860 --> 02:35:06.940]  give in to them.
[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:10.140]  It only makes people get more staunchly hardline.
[02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:11.140]  Exactly.
[02:35:11.140 --> 02:35:14.260]  If they were smart, they would figure out they would just concede he's going to win re-election
[02:35:14.260 --> 02:35:18.660]  for like Tip O'Neill did in 1983 with Reagan and look at areas where they could work together
[02:35:18.660 --> 02:35:22.740]  to achieve mutual objectives that would allow the Democrats to maintain some degree of power
[02:35:22.740 --> 02:35:24.900]  base either in the House or the Senate.
[02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:27.180]  That would be the smart move.
[02:35:27.180 --> 02:35:30.380]  They're not making the smart move because first of all, they're a party that's completely
[02:35:30.380 --> 02:35:32.940]  discordant, can't agree amongst each other.
[02:35:32.940 --> 02:35:36.420]  You have a radical young left that wants to take a sort of cultural mal-revolution to
[02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:39.940]  its older generation and just wipe them out literally and figuratively.
[02:35:39.940 --> 02:35:44.100]  You see that when you see the millennial left and the new left going after people like Martin
[02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:45.100]  Luther King.
[02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:48.380]  When they're doing that, then you have a sense that they have no sense of boundaries, no
[02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:49.380]  sense of limits.
[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:50.380]  No bottom.
[02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:51.380]  Exactly.
[02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:52.380]  No restriction.
[02:35:52.380 --> 02:35:53.380]  There is no bottom to their gutter.
[02:35:53.380 --> 02:35:56.820]  Their ethical gutter goes, keeps going and keeps going and keeps going past the levels
[02:35:56.820 --> 02:35:57.820]  of hell.
[02:35:57.820 --> 02:36:00.660]  And so when they're willing to do that, when they're ready to do that, then that means
[02:36:00.660 --> 02:36:03.940]  that they have no sense of boundaries, no sense of constraint.
[02:36:03.940 --> 02:36:04.940]  For example, for them to be pushing-
[02:36:04.940 --> 02:36:05.940]  They're not self-aware.
[02:36:05.940 --> 02:36:06.940]  Absolutely.
[02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:07.940]  Pushing impeachment is counterproductive.
[02:36:07.940 --> 02:36:12.140]  All it will do is it will keep the focus on Trump so that's what Trump wants, number
[02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:13.140]  one.
[02:36:13.140 --> 02:36:14.300]  In fact, they've done the surveys on this.
[02:36:14.300 --> 02:36:19.180]  The reason why Pelosi didn't talk about impeachment for the last six months of 2018 is because
[02:36:19.180 --> 02:36:22.380]  their survey showed that whenever the word impeachment was mentioned, Trump's support
[02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:23.380]  went up.
[02:36:23.380 --> 02:36:27.860]  And not only that, Republican support goes up in the House and voting Republican in
[02:36:27.860 --> 02:36:29.500]  the House, voting Republican in the Senate.
[02:36:29.500 --> 02:36:31.980]  And the reason for that is they're going to see the House and the Senate as completely
[02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:36.300]  useless and democratic hands because all they did is try to distract and detract from the
[02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:39.500]  President's agenda, which is very popular throughout the country.
[02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:44.180]  That's why Trump uniquely has higher job approval ratings on substantive issues than he does
[02:36:44.180 --> 02:36:45.180]  in general.
[02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:47.820]  And that reflects that the people like his policies.
[02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:51.460]  Usually, when you have someone like Obama, a lot of people wanted to like Obama, so they
[02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:53.300]  would give him high job approval.
[02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:56.260]  But when you ask them about his policies, it would tank.
[02:36:56.260 --> 02:36:59.580]  With Trump, it's just the opposite because his personality is controversial.
[02:36:59.580 --> 02:37:03.620]  It's his policies that they're so happy about, where he's getting huge approval on the economy,
[02:37:03.620 --> 02:37:05.940]  on national security, on immigration.
[02:37:05.940 --> 02:37:07.540]  These areas are going off the charts.
[02:37:07.540 --> 02:37:10.660]  So they cannot compete with him on the policy agenda.
[02:37:10.660 --> 02:37:14.140]  So if they were smart, they would try to co-op some portion of that policy agenda.
[02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:15.740]  They would say, hey, we can be useful.
[02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:20.780]  We can work together with the President to have an industrial plan that rebuild America,
[02:37:20.780 --> 02:37:24.580]  that has an infrastructure budget that helps rebuild America, areas where they have common
[02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:28.980]  cause with the President, come to terms on the immigration issues rather than continuing
[02:37:28.980 --> 02:37:32.100]  to use the judges to wage a law fair against the President.
[02:37:32.100 --> 02:37:36.140]  And the President has been subject to more injunctions against his executive policies
[02:37:36.140 --> 02:37:38.700]  than all the Presidents in the 20th century combined.
[02:37:38.700 --> 02:37:41.740]  And I love how some people still on the internet because the left's funding from below and
[02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:42.740]  above.
[02:37:42.740 --> 02:37:43.740]  Oh, he's an establishment.
[02:37:43.740 --> 02:37:44.940]  Oh, he's a new world order.
[02:37:44.940 --> 02:37:48.220]  Yeah, that's why they're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[02:37:48.220 --> 02:37:52.860]  No, Trump's not perfect, but he's really trying to be the President and not doing what
[02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:53.860]  they say.
[02:37:53.860 --> 02:37:56.540]  Doesn't mean everything he does is perfect.
[02:37:56.540 --> 02:37:57.540]  We're only human.
[02:37:57.540 --> 02:38:00.700]  But he's not taking orders, and that's the issue.
[02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:01.900]  No doubt about it whatsoever.
[02:38:01.900 --> 02:38:04.980]  You wouldn't have had the deep state wage a two-year war against him if he had been
[02:38:04.980 --> 02:38:05.980]  better.
[02:38:05.980 --> 02:38:09.380]  I mean, we have a President actually calling the shots.
[02:38:09.380 --> 02:38:10.980]  That didn't happen halfway since Reagan.
[02:38:10.980 --> 02:38:11.980]  No doubt.
[02:38:11.980 --> 02:38:15.060]  And when's the last time you had a President live on national television talk about the
[02:38:15.060 --> 02:38:19.620]  military security complex trying to be a war-raging machine that he's fighting against?
[02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:22.380]  I mean, Eisenhower waited until he was about to leave office every time.
[02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:23.380]  He's telling everybody.
[02:38:23.380 --> 02:38:24.380]  Exactly.
[02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:25.380]  And he's not against the military.
[02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:26.380]  He's against interests.
[02:38:26.380 --> 02:38:27.380]  Exactly.
[02:38:27.380 --> 02:38:29.980]  He's saying that the soldiers, he completely supports, and it's because he supports those
[02:38:29.980 --> 02:38:33.900]  soldiers that he's not going to put them in harm's way unnecessarily or fight stupid,
[02:38:33.900 --> 02:38:34.900]  useless wars.
[02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:37.080]  You haven't seen him go into Venezuela.
[02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:41.580]  He wants Venezuela to change, but he's not going to risk American lives to do it.
[02:38:41.580 --> 02:38:44.540]  He wants Russia to change in certain ways, but he's not going to risk American lives
[02:38:44.540 --> 02:38:45.540]  to do it.
[02:38:45.540 --> 02:38:48.900]  He wants Syria to be in a different political position, but he's not going to risk American
[02:38:48.900 --> 02:38:49.900]  lives to do it.
[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:53.460]  He said the only thing he was going to risk American lives for was to stop and suppress
[02:38:53.460 --> 02:38:55.900]  and squelch ISIS, and that's what he did.
[02:38:55.900 --> 02:38:59.260]  He did in two years what Obama said couldn't be done, period.
[02:38:59.260 --> 02:39:01.900]  And that was to wipe out ISIS off the face of the earth.
[02:39:01.900 --> 02:39:06.740]  And ISIS is an organization that, if you understand it, unlike Al Qaeda, it has to govern territory
[02:39:06.740 --> 02:39:09.020]  to have political viability and appeal.
[02:39:09.020 --> 02:39:12.100]  Without territory, it has no viability and appeal because of their ideology.
[02:39:12.100 --> 02:39:16.020]  And that famous footage of Trump two years ago when the Marines hat blows off in a hundred
[02:39:16.020 --> 02:39:19.980]  dollar hour wind, it shows the good OCD.
[02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:21.940]  He doesn't like seeing collapsing cities.
[02:39:21.940 --> 02:39:23.700]  He doesn't like seeing poor people.
[02:39:23.700 --> 02:39:26.540]  He doesn't get off like leftists do.
[02:39:26.540 --> 02:39:31.300]  All these articles, they admit, typhus, black plague, leftist cities collapsing worse than
[02:39:31.300 --> 02:39:32.620]  Guatemala.
[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:35.580]  And the left, why are they doing that to their cities?
[02:39:35.580 --> 02:39:39.700]  Well, because it's control, and you have to have an excuse and a pretext for state control
[02:39:39.700 --> 02:39:42.820]  and for government control and for cultural control of their ideas.
[02:39:42.820 --> 02:39:46.380]  That's why you have to disown Martin Luther King and defame Martin Luther King.
[02:39:46.380 --> 02:39:50.220]  That's why you have to have, you have to create viruses and diseases and create excuses.
[02:39:50.220 --> 02:39:53.340]  It was part of one of the criticisms of the medical industry.
[02:39:53.340 --> 02:39:56.420]  It's one of the only industries that makes more profit the more they make people sick.
[02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:57.420]  Right?
[02:39:57.420 --> 02:40:00.340]  They have no economic interest in people actually being healthy all the time because if people
[02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:03.500]  are healthy all the time, they have no need for medical services, definitely no need for
[02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:07.580]  pharmaceutical services, for certain kinds of surgical services, for certain kind of
[02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:08.740]  treatment services.
[02:40:08.740 --> 02:40:13.180]  So it builds, it has an economic interest and incentive in people being diseased in
[02:40:13.180 --> 02:40:17.740]  the same way that alcohol companies benefit from alcoholism, that gambling companies benefit
[02:40:17.740 --> 02:40:22.580]  from obsessive gambling disorders, that the drug dealers benefit from addiction.
[02:40:22.580 --> 02:40:26.740]  So they don't have an incentive to, that aligns with the public interest.
[02:40:26.740 --> 02:40:29.100]  So it's like playing the opposite lessons.
[02:40:29.100 --> 02:40:33.540]  I want to go to calls from Carlos and Brian and Matt and Chris and Matthew and Joey and
[02:40:33.540 --> 02:40:35.060]  Lee and George and Jacob and Jefferson.
[02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:38.700]  So we had a lot to get done today and we have a big baggage coming up.
[02:40:38.700 --> 02:40:42.020]  We may take a little bit of his time, maybe the first five minutes, but then we're going
[02:40:42.020 --> 02:40:44.100]  to pull the ejection pin here.
[02:40:44.100 --> 02:40:47.700]  But as we go to break, I'm going to rampage your calls.
[02:40:47.700 --> 02:40:52.300]  George and then Joey and then Chris and then Brian and Carlos and Jefferson, when we come
[02:40:52.300 --> 02:40:57.740]  back one right to you for two segments, but just briefly again, I'm going to break this
[02:40:57.740 --> 02:40:58.740]  down.

[02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:13.180]  So it's a symbiotic relationship.

[02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:04.380]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world and the globalists are
[02:43:04.380 --> 02:43:05.780]  so upset.
[02:43:05.780 --> 02:43:11.460]  The problem is people forget to take them and that's why the whole industry has moved

[02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:20.100]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeine and other chemicals
[02:45:20.100 --> 02:45:24.340]  that sure get you a quick boost but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side
[02:45:24.340 --> 02:45:25.340]  effects.

[02:45:56.500 --> 02:46:03.180]  It would take me more than an hour just to lay out all the admitted benefits and known
[02:46:03.180 --> 02:46:08.500]  positive effects of just one of the ingredients in our ultimate bone broth formula.
[02:46:08.500 --> 02:46:14.180]  Everybody knows about bone broth itself and all of the amazing things it's associated
[02:46:14.180 --> 02:46:16.500]  with and it's been the big craze for at least a decade.
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:20.380]  Well, thousands of years ago it's what everybody told people they should drink in a soup if
[02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:21.380]  they were sick.
[02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:25.260]  But then you add not just the fact that this is the strongest, most concentrated, highest
[02:46:25.260 --> 02:46:30.420]  quality bone broth out there, literally, then you have the chaga mushroom, then you have

[02:46:34.580 --> 02:46:39.620]  are all known to just make people incredibly strong and healthy.
[02:46:39.620 --> 02:46:41.860]  Our ultimate bone broth formula is amazing.

[02:46:49.620 --> 02:46:54.220]  It's also amazing when it comes to funding our operation that's taken on the globalist
[02:46:54.220 --> 02:47:24.060]  and fighting for all of our freedoms.
[02:47:25.220 --> 02:47:36.780]  Thank you, sir.
[02:47:36.780 --> 02:47:41.860]  My question for Mr. Barnes is we have to all agree, I think, that social media has become
[02:47:41.860 --> 02:47:44.420]  a ghetto because they changed the rules arbitrarily.
[02:47:44.420 --> 02:47:48.460]  And it was seen to me the president should have the power to threaten them with a kill
[02:47:48.460 --> 02:47:53.340]  switch saying we need to set up a hands-off list of a certain number of people that have
[02:47:53.340 --> 02:47:58.100]  been suspended or outlawed and put them back, reinstate them and say, you have to leave
[02:47:58.100 --> 02:47:59.260]  them alone.
[02:47:59.260 --> 02:48:01.740]  They don't have to live by your terms of service.
[02:48:01.740 --> 02:48:06.100]  They just have to live by FCC rules or some, some, some stated rule that's already written
[02:48:06.100 --> 02:48:07.100]  down.
[02:48:07.100 --> 02:48:08.100]  I have a question.
[02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:12.980]  The president has the power and the power of other method mechanisms to do it.
[02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:16.700]  So for example, the president could say that nobody's going to receive any form of federal
[02:48:16.700 --> 02:48:20.660]  funding directly or indirectly, whether it be tax benefits, whether it be immunity under
[02:48:20.660 --> 02:48:25.300]  section 230 or whether it be direct federal government contracts, unless they apply the
[02:48:25.300 --> 02:48:29.140]  same viewpoint, uh, non-discrimination rules that exist for other kinds of.
[02:48:29.140 --> 02:48:30.980]  Oh, and big tech was censoring leftists.
[02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:31.980]  This would never happen.
[02:48:31.980 --> 02:48:35.740]  But they know the servers are like, we're free market companies doing anything they
[02:48:35.740 --> 02:48:36.740]  want.
[02:48:36.740 --> 02:48:39.260]  No, not when they're bigger than governments and have been lying and have been lying on
[02:48:39.260 --> 02:48:41.860]  their contracts and are operating as oligopolies.
[02:48:41.860 --> 02:48:44.780]  I think the president has been building to the point where the public can accept that
[02:48:44.780 --> 02:48:48.500]  his, that when he takes dramatic action, it's necessary action.
[02:48:48.500 --> 02:48:51.220]  But like he waited for a while to do anything about college free speech.
[02:48:51.220 --> 02:48:53.940]  He waited till it built and built and built and built.
[02:48:53.940 --> 02:48:56.140]  And then when he acted, people said, well, he had to act.
[02:48:56.140 --> 02:48:57.140]  He had no other choice.
[02:48:57.140 --> 02:48:58.140]  He's letting it ripen.
[02:48:58.140 --> 02:48:59.140]  Correct.
[02:48:59.140 --> 02:49:03.020]  But he's going to need to do it before 2019 ends or early in 2020, because all of this
[02:49:03.020 --> 02:49:05.580]  is about manipulating the 2020 election outcome.
[02:49:05.580 --> 02:49:08.180]  It's he only faces, in my view, two threats.
[02:49:08.180 --> 02:49:12.940]  What are the 5% chance he can lose the deep state taking him out or social media manipulating
[02:49:12.940 --> 02:49:14.180]  the election results?
[02:49:14.180 --> 02:49:18.220]  Those are his only two threats and those are the two he's got to be focused on for 2020.
[02:49:18.220 --> 02:49:20.620]  And again, he's 72 years old.
[02:49:20.620 --> 02:49:22.580]  His son is smart when it comes to the internet.
[02:49:22.580 --> 02:49:23.780]  Trump's like, oh yeah, that's the internet.
[02:49:23.780 --> 02:49:29.420]  He doesn't get, hey, every day there's 50 times the audience of Fox News in political
[02:49:29.420 --> 02:49:30.420]  debate.
[02:49:30.420 --> 02:49:35.220]  It's you, Trump, it's your clips that would have been magnified to new people that are
[02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:36.220]  being blocked.
[02:49:36.220 --> 02:49:37.220]  Absolutely.
[02:49:37.220 --> 02:49:40.460]  You shouldn't care about the geriatric Fox audience.
[02:49:40.460 --> 02:49:41.460]  No doubt.
[02:49:41.460 --> 02:49:44.340]  Because in fact, when they did a deep study, the Harvard and other people looked at what
[02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:48.720]  social media overlapping networks really created the Trump machine and they identified two
[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:51.140]  sources and it was you and Breitbart.
[02:49:51.140 --> 02:49:54.940]  And they said it was outside and they said Fox really only existed in this world.
[02:49:54.940 --> 02:49:58.700]  It was a whole different world which had you and Breitbart as the center and outposts of
[02:49:58.700 --> 02:49:59.700]  it as like Gateway Pundit.
[02:49:59.700 --> 02:50:03.700]  So exactly, we're like the firebases launching the tentacles out.
[02:50:03.700 --> 02:50:04.700]  Correct, exactly.
[02:50:04.700 --> 02:50:06.860]  And Trump has allowed those to be basically curtailed.
[02:50:06.860 --> 02:50:09.620]  We're trying to fire tentacles out as best we can, but.
[02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:10.620]  Correct, exactly.
[02:50:10.620 --> 02:50:13.660]  The problem is they're limiting the ability for you to reach people who don't already
[02:50:13.660 --> 02:50:15.940]  know about you or who don't know about your news.
[02:50:15.940 --> 02:50:20.500]  And that's what you were able to do through this sort of networking of 12 degrees of separation.
[02:50:20.500 --> 02:50:23.180]  All these people would rely upon what you did to distribute your information.
[02:50:23.180 --> 02:50:28.380]  But our listeners can still override all that by just being more earnest, more focused.
[02:50:28.380 --> 02:50:29.380]  Precisely.
[02:50:29.380 --> 02:50:33.660]  As long as they continue to act in dissident ways, wear their own Guy Fox mask of a kind,
[02:50:33.660 --> 02:50:36.900]  in this case, an Alex Jones mask by doing so in the social media space.
[02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:39.140]  Oh, you had a great idea that meeting this morning.
[02:50:39.140 --> 02:50:42.380]  We should have an actually thick, nice Guy Fox, Alex Jones mask, not just the little
[02:50:42.380 --> 02:50:46.260]  Halloween ones we put out that are like super cheap, but a nicer one.
[02:50:46.260 --> 02:50:49.900]  So that because the new Guy Fox is Alex Jones, I'm not trying to be famous or cool.
[02:50:49.900 --> 02:50:50.900]  It's true.
[02:50:50.900 --> 02:50:54.540]  In the third dimension, they go, Oh, look, Jones is bullhorn in the White House.
[02:50:54.540 --> 02:50:56.460]  How pathetic, raw story said.
[02:50:56.460 --> 02:50:59.140]  And so did media matters because it's not pathetic.
[02:50:59.140 --> 02:51:00.580]  They're scared of us in the third dimension.
[02:51:00.580 --> 02:51:04.460]  So they want to tell us it's pathetic when you were all over the news.
[02:51:04.460 --> 02:51:05.460]  Just so happened.
[02:51:05.460 --> 02:51:06.460]  Jack Dorsey was there.
[02:51:06.460 --> 02:51:07.460]  We didn't plan that.
[02:51:07.460 --> 02:51:08.460]  Oh, it was so credible.
[02:51:08.460 --> 02:51:12.740]  It listened and said, see, Jack, oh, so dumb that you protested.
[02:51:12.740 --> 02:51:14.300]  No, it absolutely.
[02:51:14.300 --> 02:51:16.380]  We get a royal flush.
[02:51:16.380 --> 02:51:17.380]  Absolutely.
[02:51:17.380 --> 02:51:18.540]  What's even better than a royal flush?
[02:51:18.540 --> 02:51:20.540]  I had no idea the meeting was happening then.
[02:51:20.540 --> 02:51:23.660]  Only time ever born in the White House, it's when we're having a censorship meeting and
[02:51:23.660 --> 02:51:26.180]  I'm and Trump and them thought I'd been tipped off.
[02:51:26.180 --> 02:51:28.340]  I later met with the US intelligence the next day.
[02:51:28.340 --> 02:51:29.340]  An intelligence agency.
[02:51:29.340 --> 02:51:32.820]  They're like, so who told you like, no, I just showed up then precisely.
[02:51:32.820 --> 02:51:34.100]  And they're telling me how weak I am.
[02:51:34.100 --> 02:51:35.100]  Oh, of course.
[02:51:35.100 --> 02:51:36.100]  And they're going to do that.
[02:51:36.100 --> 02:51:39.700]  That's sort of a sort of a mind trick on the audience to get the audience to not support
[02:51:39.700 --> 02:51:41.820]  the network, to not participate.
[02:51:41.820 --> 02:51:44.140]  I mean, every time they're going to call victory defeat.
[02:51:44.140 --> 02:51:45.140]  Absolutely.
[02:51:45.140 --> 02:51:47.500]  And they need the audience to not do it because they need the audience to believe they don't
[02:51:47.500 --> 02:51:48.500]  have the power.
[02:51:48.500 --> 02:51:52.140]  If they believe they don't have the power to change the world, then they can stop the
[02:51:52.140 --> 02:51:53.140]  audience from changing.
[02:51:53.140 --> 02:51:54.540]  Like the Einstein Institute said.
[02:51:54.540 --> 02:51:55.540]  Exactly.
[02:51:55.540 --> 02:51:56.540]  That's their whole thing.
[02:51:56.540 --> 02:51:59.460]  I mean, they all those color revolutions, velvet, orange, rose, you heard about Eastern
[02:51:59.460 --> 02:52:03.220]  Europe, all of those were founded by the ideas spread by the Einstein Institute to dissonance
[02:52:03.220 --> 02:52:04.660]  in Eastern and Central Europe.
[02:52:04.660 --> 02:52:08.380]  They reminded them that the four pillars of public power actually had underneath it a fifth
[02:52:08.380 --> 02:52:11.740]  pillar of power, which was public opinion and public perception of their own power.
[02:52:11.740 --> 02:52:12.740]  Jefferson.
[02:52:12.740 --> 02:52:13.740]  Thank you so much.
[02:52:13.740 --> 02:52:14.740]  Let's go to Matt.
[02:52:14.740 --> 02:52:17.180]  Let's go to Matt in California.
[02:52:17.180 --> 02:52:18.180]  Go ahead.
[02:52:18.180 --> 02:52:19.180]  You're on the air.
[02:52:19.180 --> 02:52:20.180]  Alex Jones.
[02:52:20.180 --> 02:52:21.180]  What up?
[02:52:21.180 --> 02:52:22.180]  You are the man.
[02:52:22.180 --> 02:52:23.180]  Bob Barr.
[02:52:23.180 --> 02:52:24.180]  What's up, man?
[02:52:24.180 --> 02:52:25.180]  Hey, info planet.
[02:52:25.180 --> 02:52:26.180]  We're winning.
[02:52:26.180 --> 02:52:31.860]  And Bob, the question is, is there any way that we could have a class action lawsuit
[02:52:31.860 --> 02:52:40.260]  against Twitter because I was part of a bunch of the mean war competitions and I posted a
[02:52:40.260 --> 02:52:44.540]  bunch of stuff and I was just like, why is nobody ever seeing any of this stuff?
[02:52:44.540 --> 02:52:49.940]  Turns out my, my logo was a Trump said Trump on it, Trump strong and it was an American
[02:52:49.940 --> 02:52:51.580]  flag wall.
[02:52:51.580 --> 02:52:55.100]  And so obviously nobody ever seen it because it not only was Trump.
[02:52:55.100 --> 02:53:00.340]  And the AI so dumb, if you just say screw Alex Jones, screw Trump, people are doing
[02:53:00.340 --> 02:53:06.180]  this now, then they'll share it because their minions are so dumb, you look at this filth
[02:53:06.180 --> 02:53:10.540]  Trump trying to get blacks jobs and then they'll go, oh yeah.
[02:53:10.540 --> 02:53:15.860]  Could we actually do them a class action for all the lost earnings for people that were
[02:53:15.860 --> 02:53:19.980]  posting things, maybe trying to push t-shirt designs that actually were in echo chambers
[02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:24.700]  and going nowhere because we, I put a lot of effort in, I was posting it daily like
[02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:25.700]  thousands of times.
[02:53:25.700 --> 02:53:27.140]  And I'm just like, why is nobody liking this?
[02:53:27.140 --> 02:53:28.140]  It's such an epic deal.
[02:53:28.140 --> 02:53:30.460]  It's just a little more shadow baby.
[02:53:30.460 --> 02:53:31.460]  Exactly.
[02:53:31.460 --> 02:53:36.300]  So can we actually get reparations from that, reparations, some kind of a, well, I'm not
[02:53:36.300 --> 02:53:41.220]  joking and I'm not saying you should do this, but if you said Nambla is good as your account,
[02:53:41.220 --> 02:53:45.460]  you would be, whatever reason, Google, Facebook boost anything Nambla and I'm not saying do
[02:53:45.460 --> 02:53:46.460]  that.
[02:53:46.460 --> 02:53:50.140]  If you said adults should have sex with two year olds or kill babies, they would just
[02:53:50.140 --> 02:53:51.140]  maximize you.
[02:53:51.140 --> 02:53:52.140]  I'm not joking.
[02:53:52.140 --> 02:53:55.660]  If you said, I love Satan, you will have movies made about you.
[02:53:55.660 --> 02:53:56.660]  It's crazy.
[02:53:56.660 --> 02:53:57.660]  No doubt.
[02:53:57.660 --> 02:53:58.660]  That's true.
[02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:01.580]  In fact, there will be an announcement coming up near July 4th, we're going to have an Independence
[02:54:01.580 --> 02:54:06.220]  Day announcement, a new Independence Day of an independent movement to create a new Southern
[02:54:06.220 --> 02:54:10.080]  Poverty Law Center that does what the Southern Poverty Law Center claims to do, but to actually
[02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:16.060]  support speech, a speech protection law center instead, a real SPLC to counter the SPLC.
[02:54:16.060 --> 02:54:21.020]  And the goal will be to create and organize together, put together a team of lawyers that
[02:54:21.020 --> 02:54:26.380]  brings class action cases against big tech and big media that is corrupting and corroding
[02:54:26.380 --> 02:54:30.580]  our democratic institutions to protect the 2020 election.
[02:54:30.580 --> 02:54:34.140]  And we're going to have, and Alex may be one of the lead participants in those class action
[02:54:34.140 --> 02:54:37.560]  claims, and we're going to have an announcement coming forth on July 4th that everybody can
[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:41.100]  participate in, that everybody can support, that everybody can join in, and we're going
[02:54:41.100 --> 02:54:45.460]  to create a range of class action claims to equalize the playing field and to try to force
[02:54:45.460 --> 02:54:49.380]  big tech to be honest and honorable under the law, under the rules of contract, under
[02:54:49.380 --> 02:54:52.940]  the rules of equity, under the constitutional restrictions and restraints that apply to a
[02:54:52.940 --> 02:54:58.140]  public monopoly that dominates the public marketplace, the public square, and to reinstate
[02:54:58.140 --> 02:55:02.380]  free speech like they promised they would so that the 2020 elections can be honest and
[02:55:02.380 --> 02:55:06.420]  honorable and up and above board so that the people's rights and interests can be protected
[02:55:06.420 --> 02:55:09.980]  and their economic interests protected, such as people making T-shirts, people who have
[02:55:09.980 --> 02:55:14.780]  monetized their social media for the purposes of other independent purposes, to require
[02:55:14.780 --> 02:55:18.460]  that they be reinstated, to require that their rights be protected, that their platform be
[02:55:18.460 --> 02:55:23.260]  a civil right that is necessary in this modern age of social media monopolies and so many
[02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:27.100]  times what I've seen with Trump and other great leaders is, when the grassroots takes
[02:55:27.100 --> 02:55:32.020]  action, he respects, that's why he reads the mail coming in, he takes random phone calls,
[02:55:32.020 --> 02:55:37.900]  he respects that raw intel, and so when we take action, when the listeners take action
[02:55:37.900 --> 02:55:45.220]  against this, organically that signals other leaders above us to get involved, so we're
[02:55:45.220 --> 02:55:48.660]  sending the orders up, people don't get this, we're in command.
[02:55:48.660 --> 02:55:52.060]  Yeah, look at what happened, once they created a private fund to build the wall, it wasn't
[02:55:52.060 --> 02:55:54.900]  like the private fund was going to be able to achieve building the wall, but it sent
[02:55:54.900 --> 02:55:58.580]  a message to the president, look how much money was raised to build the wall, and by
[02:55:58.580 --> 02:56:01.820]  people who knew that that money likely would never get to get spent on building a wall,
[02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:04.860]  they ended up building about a mile or so, they've worked hard on it, I know the people
[02:56:04.860 --> 02:56:05.860]  doing it.
[02:56:05.860 --> 02:56:07.740]  But it stunts that launched this country.
[02:56:07.740 --> 02:56:11.940]  Absolutely, it drew public attention, the president realized, wow, these people are
[02:56:11.940 --> 02:56:16.780]  willing to back their ideas with their actual money and cash, and so he's a businessman
[02:56:16.780 --> 02:56:20.700]  like anyone else, and when he sees that, he says, okay, this is serious, this is significant,
[02:56:20.700 --> 02:56:24.420]  I have to pay attention to this, I have to take action on it, I mean, it's one of the
[02:56:24.420 --> 02:56:28.460]  reasons why he had great respect for the InfoWars audience, first major presidential candidate
[02:56:28.460 --> 02:56:33.220]  to publicly appear, constantly publicly support, say publicly positive things, retweet out
[02:56:33.220 --> 02:56:34.220]  the counter.
[02:56:34.220 --> 02:56:36.780]  And by the way, they tried to have, I think it's QAnon, it's a bunch of different people,
[02:56:36.780 --> 02:56:40.620]  some of it real, some of it not, claim Trump doesn't like me, then Trump tweets a bunch
[02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:44.540]  of our stuff, they don't know what to do, that was Trump literally saying, no, I'm with
[02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:49.180]  InfoWars, and that totally has sent the whole system into a hissy fit, because Trump knows
[02:56:49.180 --> 02:56:54.900]  the powers, the grassroots, the 1776, the real blood of Americana, which we're just one system
[02:56:54.900 --> 02:57:00.380]  of, and the fact that after all the demonization, he didn't forsake us, it just sends them into
[02:57:00.380 --> 02:57:01.380]  panic mode.
[02:57:01.380 --> 02:57:05.780]  Absolutely, what it was, is it was the, he would, Trump respects an audience that puts
[02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:09.380]  action behind their words, and the InfoWars audience has always done that.
[02:57:09.380 --> 02:57:13.020]  So part of the reason to build this public platform is not just to bring the public litigation
[02:57:13.020 --> 02:57:16.540]  that would need to be brought, but to bring public attention to the legal issues that
[02:57:16.540 --> 02:57:20.620]  need to be brought, so the president takes meaningful, real, positive action to protect
[02:57:20.620 --> 02:57:24.420]  his own interest in the 2020 election, but to protect all of our free speech and free
[02:57:24.420 --> 02:57:25.780]  press rights moving forward.
[02:57:25.780 --> 02:57:30.220]  That's right, the communications of citizens in the modern telecommunications system is
[02:57:30.220 --> 02:57:32.140]  essential to a free and open republic.
[02:57:32.140 --> 02:57:37.460]  We're going to come back with more calls, and then Dr. Nick Baggage takes sober from
[02:57:37.460 --> 02:57:39.580]  Alaska with big breaking news.
[02:57:39.580 --> 02:57:40.580]  Stay there.
[02:57:40.580 --> 02:57:45.380]  Hour number four is only two minutes away.
[02:57:45.380 --> 02:57:50.660]  InfoWars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[02:57:50.660 --> 02:57:56.020]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[02:57:56.020 --> 02:58:02.700]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[02:58:02.700 --> 02:58:08.540]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:58:08.540 --> 02:58:11.460]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[02:58:11.460 --> 02:58:16.540]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[02:58:16.540 --> 02:58:21.860]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[02:58:21.860 --> 02:58:22.860]  symptoms.
[02:58:22.860 --> 02:58:25.540]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[02:58:25.540 --> 02:58:26.780]  It is not an antihistamine.
[02:58:26.780 --> 02:58:31.460]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[02:58:31.460 --> 02:58:37.260]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[02:58:37.260 --> 02:58:39.940]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[02:58:39.940 --> 02:58:48.140]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[02:58:48.140 --> 02:58:50.140]  Mike in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[02:58:50.140 --> 02:58:51.140]  Thanks for calling, Mike.
[02:58:51.140 --> 02:58:52.140]  You are the man, Alex.
[02:58:52.140 --> 02:58:53.660]  I'm so glad to be talking to you.
[02:58:53.660 --> 02:58:54.660]  I'm so excited.
[02:58:54.660 --> 02:58:55.660]  I'm such a big fan.
[02:58:55.660 --> 02:58:57.860]  Ever since I've been listening, I've been buying your products.
[02:58:57.860 --> 02:59:00.460]  I got to do a shout out for the bone broth.
[02:59:00.460 --> 02:59:01.460]  The bone broth.
[02:59:01.460 --> 02:59:02.460]  The bone broth.
[02:59:02.460 --> 02:59:03.460]  The bone broth.
[02:59:03.460 --> 02:59:04.460]  The bone broth.
[02:59:04.460 --> 02:59:05.460]  The bone broth.
[02:59:05.460 --> 02:59:06.460]  The bone broth.
[02:59:06.460 --> 02:59:10.460]  It tastes like, tastes like, um, great milkshake, you know, if you just add it to milk.
[02:59:10.460 --> 02:59:11.460]  It tastes like oval-team.
[02:59:11.460 --> 02:59:12.460]  It tastes like oval-team.
[02:59:12.460 --> 02:59:13.460]  It tastes like oval-team.
[02:59:13.460 --> 02:59:14.460]  It tastes like oval-team.
[02:59:14.460 --> 02:59:15.460]  Like, good.
[02:59:15.460 --> 02:59:16.460]  Whoa!
[02:59:16.460 --> 02:59:18.540]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:22.460]  My daughter uses the, uh, bubblegum, fluoride-free toothpaste.
[02:59:22.460 --> 02:59:27.460]  Um, I've used the, uh, SuperMail Vitality, a host of other products, so thank you so much
[02:59:27.460 --> 02:59:28.460]  for that as well.
[02:59:28.460 --> 02:59:31.460]  Brother, you're thanking me for buying the products and keeping us on air.
[02:59:31.460 --> 02:59:32.460]  I'm thanking you.
[02:59:32.460 --> 02:59:36.460]  But yes, this is the ultimate bone broth formula with the turmeric, the chocolate mushroom,
[02:59:36.460 --> 02:59:37.460]  the true bone broth.
[02:59:37.460 --> 02:59:38.460]  It, it, it is next level.
[02:59:38.460 --> 02:59:39.460]  It really is good.
[02:59:39.460 --> 02:59:40.460]  So thank you.
[02:59:40.460 --> 02:59:42.460]  I feel great since I've been taking it.
[02:59:42.460 --> 02:59:43.460]  Thank you.
[02:59:43.460 --> 02:59:57.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:57.460 --> 03:00:03.340]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:03.340 --> 03:00:05.460]  You want to stop tyranny?
[03:00:05.460 --> 03:00:07.460]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:07.460 --> 03:00:12.460]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:12.460 --> 03:00:17.460]  Well, we're going into sudden death over time, and Beggach, who I love to death, is a great
[03:00:17.460 --> 03:00:18.460]  scientist, and he's cool.
[03:00:18.460 --> 03:00:20.460]  We're taking the next 10 minutes, too.
[03:00:20.460 --> 03:00:24.460]  So this segment, next segment of calls, we get to everybody that's holding.
[03:00:24.460 --> 03:00:25.460]  Let's go to Chris.
[03:00:25.460 --> 03:00:28.460]  In Illinois, you're on the air with Robert Barnes.
[03:00:28.460 --> 03:00:30.460]  That's not Bob Barr, the attorney general.
[03:00:30.460 --> 03:00:31.460]  That's Robert Barnes.
[03:00:31.460 --> 03:00:33.460]  Somebody's calling you Bob.
[03:00:33.460 --> 03:00:36.460]  So somebody was calling you for a general earlier, which is fine.
[03:00:36.460 --> 03:00:38.460]  It's, it's, it's, you've gotten promoted.
[03:00:38.460 --> 03:00:39.460]  Chris in Illinois, you're on the air.
[03:00:39.460 --> 03:00:41.460]  Thanks for calling.
[03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:42.460]  Good afternoon, fellas.
[03:00:42.460 --> 03:00:45.460]  Just dodging bullets here in Chicago.
[03:00:45.460 --> 03:00:49.460]  I know you don't like compliments, Alex, but my compliment is this.
[03:00:49.460 --> 03:00:52.460]  I'm listening to you guys for about 10 years.
[03:00:52.460 --> 03:00:57.460]  And around work and a lot of my neighbors, you know, you know, I have enough knowledge
[03:00:57.460 --> 03:01:01.460]  now, I feel like I had my PhD talking about a lot of this stuff.
[03:01:01.460 --> 03:01:06.460]  And I actually have a lot of people that will sort of come to me and say, Hey, what do you
[03:01:06.460 --> 03:01:08.460]  think's going to happen next?
[03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:10.460]  Because typically I'm spot on.
[03:01:10.460 --> 03:01:13.460]  And that's basically what I'm listening to you guys.
[03:01:13.460 --> 03:01:21.460]  But my comment about Pusner is, you know, way back, I remember one of the interviews
[03:01:21.460 --> 03:01:26.460]  with Phyllis Schlafly and one of the things she said that really woke me up with how
[03:01:26.460 --> 03:01:30.460]  she was talking about how bipartisanship is essentially the Fox in the henhouse.
[03:01:30.460 --> 03:01:36.460]  And my concern with Pusner is, first of all, I think his dad has a lot of skeletons, which
[03:01:36.460 --> 03:01:40.460]  is puzzling to me why the globalists haven't come after him in that regard.
[03:01:40.460 --> 03:01:41.460]  Sure.
[03:01:41.460 --> 03:01:43.460]  And paying twice as much as you should for 666.
[03:01:43.460 --> 03:01:44.460]  Mark Avenue.
[03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:45.460]  Yeah.
[03:01:45.460 --> 03:01:49.460]  Well, his dad is also on record as probably the dumbest criminal of all time.
[03:01:49.460 --> 03:01:52.460]  I mean, he managed to get himself convicted by Chris Christie.
[03:01:52.460 --> 03:01:58.460]  So the hopefully the next segment, start of the next segment, tell that story.
[03:01:58.460 --> 03:02:01.460]  Go ahead, Chris.
[03:02:01.460 --> 03:02:07.460]  So, so basically, you know, in the same way when the conservatives always lose with bipartisanship,
[03:02:07.460 --> 03:02:12.460]  such as gun control laws, the Patriot Act, you know, Patriots end up getting pissed on
[03:02:12.460 --> 03:02:13.460]  with this stuff.
[03:02:13.460 --> 03:02:14.460]  It sounds good, right?
[03:02:14.460 --> 03:02:19.460]  But I'm afraid Kushner might walk in and the globalists know they're on their rope.
[03:02:19.460 --> 03:02:23.960]  And so perhaps he would take some kind of deal, you know, because their goal is essentially
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:25.460]  to buy time.
[03:02:25.460 --> 03:02:30.460]  And right now with the rise of populism and nationalism globally, as we saw last weekend,
[03:02:30.460 --> 03:02:31.460]  they've got to buy some time.
[03:02:31.460 --> 03:02:33.460]  And I think that's what concerns me about.
[03:02:33.460 --> 03:02:34.460]  I agree with you.
[03:02:34.460 --> 03:02:35.460]  Kushner tends to try to make deals.
[03:02:35.460 --> 03:02:40.460]  He's more of a Democrat from New York, but Kushner doesn't make the deals.
[03:02:40.460 --> 03:02:42.460]  Trump approves them.
[03:02:42.460 --> 03:02:47.460]  So I'm just saying, it is that Trump joining Bilderberg to send a representative there.
[03:02:47.460 --> 03:02:51.460]  Our old point was forcing the fact that Bilderberg exists out in the open.
[03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:52.460]  No doubt.
[03:02:52.460 --> 03:02:56.460]  Well, and Trump is the first president in forever to never go to Bohemian Grove and
[03:02:56.460 --> 03:02:59.460]  to never have previously gone and participated in Bilderberg.
[03:02:59.460 --> 03:03:04.460]  So the fact that he's sending Kushner there to get intel, which is how Kushner will be
[03:03:04.460 --> 03:03:07.460]  seen as a, as like them to the Bilderberg elites.
[03:03:07.460 --> 03:03:10.460]  But Trump doesn't care about that because Kushner makes no decisions.
[03:03:10.460 --> 03:03:14.460]  Trump is, Kushner is there to provide intel to the president as to what they're thinking
[03:03:14.460 --> 03:03:17.460]  about, what they're talking about, what they're strategizing, what's going on.
[03:03:17.460 --> 03:03:21.460]  He wants to be inside the room rather than outside the room to know what the deal is
[03:03:21.460 --> 03:03:23.460]  so he can make his own determinations and decisions.
[03:03:23.460 --> 03:03:27.460]  Anybody that's been around Trump anytime in his life knows he makes his own decisions
[03:03:27.460 --> 03:03:28.460]  on his own mind.
[03:03:28.460 --> 03:03:30.460]  Kushner's only impact is to provide him information.
[03:03:30.460 --> 03:03:33.460]  Kushner's making no decisions at all inside the White House.
[03:03:33.460 --> 03:03:35.460]  So, and that's good for a lot of reasons.
[03:03:35.460 --> 03:03:36.460]  Chris, appreciate the call.
[03:03:36.460 --> 03:03:37.460]  Great point.
[03:03:37.460 --> 03:03:42.460]  And I get criticizing Kushner and I defend people that want to criticize him.
[03:03:42.460 --> 03:03:43.460]  I just think I totally agree with you.
[03:03:43.460 --> 03:03:45.460]  Kushner's well-spoken.
[03:03:45.460 --> 03:03:46.460]  He gets around.
[03:03:46.460 --> 03:03:48.460]  He's slick with establishment people.
[03:03:48.460 --> 03:03:53.460]  And he goes to reports to Trump and I would keep hearing how Kushner's running things.
[03:03:53.460 --> 03:03:55.460]  And I just don't think that's the case.
[03:03:55.460 --> 03:03:56.460]  No, not at all.
[03:03:56.460 --> 03:03:59.460]  And in fact, I think Trump deliberately leaks that because he wants these people to give
[03:03:59.460 --> 03:04:02.460]  him more, give Kushner more information than they would otherwise give him.
[03:04:02.460 --> 03:04:06.460]  In order for them to be field trusting and confident around him, you need Kushner meeting
[03:04:06.460 --> 03:04:08.460]  with Kissinger once a month like he's been doing.
[03:04:08.460 --> 03:04:12.460]  You need Kushner meeting with some members of the sort of the elitist structure that
[03:04:12.460 --> 03:04:13.460]  operates throughout the world.
[03:04:13.460 --> 03:04:14.460]  The enemy's closer.
[03:04:14.460 --> 03:04:15.460]  Exactly.
[03:04:15.460 --> 03:04:17.460]  You got to know what they're thinking, know what they're talking about.
[03:04:17.460 --> 03:04:20.460]  And the only way that works is if the world thinks Kushner has real power.
[03:04:20.460 --> 03:04:22.460]  So, he's got to let people think Kushner has real power.
[03:04:22.460 --> 03:04:26.460]  But anybody that's been, anybody that knows Trump knows the probability he's letting
[03:04:26.460 --> 03:04:29.460]  anybody dictate to him anything doesn't know Trump at all.
[03:04:29.460 --> 03:04:33.460]  Trump responds to public demand of the public interest and the public audience.
[03:04:33.460 --> 03:04:37.460]  He doesn't take dictation from any individual as to what he has to do.
[03:04:37.460 --> 03:04:42.460]  But he, no one, people don't get any pull with him.
[03:04:42.460 --> 03:04:45.460]  But a random phone call, a woman hand him a piece of paper.
[03:04:45.460 --> 03:04:46.460]  Yes.
[03:04:46.460 --> 03:04:47.460]  He takes it.
[03:04:47.460 --> 03:04:50.460]  What the Info Wars audience is doing and acting, that he will act upon.
[03:04:50.460 --> 03:04:52.460]  And that's why the establishment wants it cut off.
[03:04:52.460 --> 03:04:53.460]  Absolutely.
[03:04:53.460 --> 03:04:54.460]  Powerful.
[03:04:54.460 --> 03:04:56.460]  They've not shut down our speech.
[03:04:56.460 --> 03:05:01.460]  We're at infowars.com and newswars.com and we're defeating the leftist tyrants.
[03:05:01.460 --> 03:05:03.460]  I got mobbed on the streets by fans.
[03:05:03.460 --> 03:05:05.460]  But almost all of them said, we used to love you on air.
[03:05:05.460 --> 03:05:08.460]  It was so good to see you on, you know, the iTunes or on YouTube.
[03:05:08.460 --> 03:05:10.460]  Are you coming back?
[03:05:10.460 --> 03:05:12.460]  We're at infowars.com.
[03:05:12.460 --> 03:05:13.460]  We're at newswars.com.
[03:05:13.460 --> 03:05:15.460]  Paul Watts has launched his own summit.news.
[03:05:15.460 --> 03:05:16.460]  We have our own videos.
[03:05:16.460 --> 03:05:17.460]  We have our own articles.
[03:05:17.460 --> 03:05:18.460]  They're trying to destroy us.
[03:05:18.460 --> 03:05:22.460]  But thanks to you and others having us on, Info Wars is still chatting along.
[03:05:22.460 --> 03:05:24.460]  So, we're there, folks, tomorrow's news.
[03:05:24.460 --> 03:05:25.460]  Today.
[03:05:25.460 --> 03:05:35.460]  We're at infowars.com.
[03:05:35.460 --> 03:05:37.460]  I'm at infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:05:37.460 --> 03:05:38.460]  There you go.
[03:05:38.460 --> 03:05:40.460]  We knew this censorship was coming forever.
[03:05:40.460 --> 03:05:43.460]  We have our own video streams, our own audio streams, and it's all free to air.
[03:05:43.460 --> 03:05:44.460]  Anybody can use it.
[03:05:44.460 --> 03:05:46.460]  We upload it, do whatever you want.
[03:05:46.460 --> 03:05:48.460]  People go to infowars.com and newswars.com.
[03:05:48.460 --> 03:05:49.460]  That's where they find it.
[03:05:49.460 --> 03:05:56.460]  You know, there's what things called websites, they just go there.
[03:05:56.460 --> 03:06:07.460]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[03:06:07.460 --> 03:06:33.460]  front lines of the Info War.
[03:06:33.460 --> 03:06:47.460]  We're broadcasting worldwide, cramming in as many phone calls as we can before.
[03:06:47.460 --> 03:06:51.460]  Dr. Nick Baggage closes out the Friday transmission.
[03:06:51.460 --> 03:06:54.460]  Costumes lawyer Robert Barnes is here.
[03:06:54.460 --> 03:06:58.460]  Briefly, because you're an expert on Robert Mueller.
[03:06:58.460 --> 03:06:59.460]  You exposed that.
[03:06:59.460 --> 03:07:00.460]  It's all come out.
[03:07:00.460 --> 03:07:04.460]  You were getting into Kushner and his father.
[03:07:04.460 --> 03:07:07.460]  Again, don't judge a son by his father.
[03:07:07.460 --> 03:07:11.460]  God, don't judge people for their family 10 generations ago as slaves.
[03:07:11.460 --> 03:07:13.460]  I'm not here to defend Kushner.
[03:07:13.460 --> 03:07:16.460]  I'm just not here to say Kushner's back as his dad went to jail.
[03:07:16.460 --> 03:07:20.460]  But you were telling me the way he went was just stupid.
[03:07:20.460 --> 03:07:21.460]  Oh, completely.
[03:07:21.460 --> 03:07:24.460]  I use him as one of the examples of, you have those sort of America's Dumbest Criminals awards
[03:07:24.460 --> 03:07:25.460]  and those kind of things.
[03:07:25.460 --> 03:07:26.460]  Darwin Awards.
[03:07:26.460 --> 03:07:30.460]  Exactly, people who leave their driver's license at the place at the bank where they
[03:07:30.460 --> 03:07:32.460]  just committed robbery.
[03:07:32.460 --> 03:07:34.460]  That's basically what Kushner's dad did.
[03:07:34.460 --> 03:07:37.460]  The guys that rob a house, kill the woman, like just happened in Austin, and they take
[03:07:37.460 --> 03:07:40.460]  the credit card and the woman's cell phone and they're using it on the road.
[03:07:40.460 --> 03:07:41.460]  The cops go right there.
[03:07:41.460 --> 03:07:42.460]  Correct, exactly.
[03:07:42.460 --> 03:07:44.460]  I mean, it's just insanity.
[03:07:44.460 --> 03:07:47.460]  So basically, Kushner's dad could have dodged all the problems.
[03:07:47.460 --> 03:07:51.460]  But he tried to set up his own in-laws and other relations with this bogus hooker thing
[03:07:51.460 --> 03:07:55.460]  and then he tried to create another fake thing to set somebody else up that all got him
[03:07:55.460 --> 03:07:56.460]  much deeper into trouble.
[03:07:56.460 --> 03:07:57.460]  Let's pull up Kushner's dad.
[03:07:57.460 --> 03:08:00.460]  You can type it in and go ahead.
[03:08:00.460 --> 03:08:04.460]  So yeah, so Kushner's dad basically bought himself a ticket to prison with his own stupidity
[03:08:04.460 --> 03:08:09.460]  by taking you, somebody who I use as an example to clients and say, this is what not to do.
[03:08:09.460 --> 03:08:10.460]  Don't do this.
[03:08:10.460 --> 03:08:13.460]  It wasn't that he was so smart, but it got in the way with stuff forever.
[03:08:13.460 --> 03:08:15.460]  He thought some elaborate one-dimensional scheme.
[03:08:15.460 --> 03:08:20.460]  If something's incredibly elaborate, but it doesn't think about the next step, it's
[03:08:20.460 --> 03:08:24.460]  still one-dimensional, the only good one-dimensional thing would be something super simple.
[03:08:24.460 --> 03:08:27.460]  Something one-dimensional and super complex is going to fail.
[03:08:27.460 --> 03:08:28.460]  Absolutely.
[03:08:28.460 --> 03:08:32.460]  It's the reason why so many of the people that are caught criminals in prison have low IQs
[03:08:32.460 --> 03:08:34.460]  because they're one-step thinkers, not two-step thinkers.
[03:08:34.460 --> 03:08:38.460]  They think, purse nice, what like to steal, not what happens if I get caught.
[03:08:38.460 --> 03:08:39.460]  So that's what Kushner's dad was.
[03:08:39.460 --> 03:08:44.460]  So that's why I really do hope the genetic part of his IQ came from his mom.
[03:08:44.460 --> 03:08:49.460]  But I made the point that there's also me and my buddy called really rich institutional
[03:08:49.460 --> 03:08:54.460]  wealth people, aliens, because they don't even know how to clean their car, how to change
[03:08:54.460 --> 03:08:56.460]  a tire, and they've gotten away with stuff so long.
[03:08:56.460 --> 03:08:58.460]  Sometimes their IQ is even low.
[03:08:58.460 --> 03:09:04.460]  It's their cultural IQ is so low, or their societal IQ, they're experiential.
[03:09:04.460 --> 03:09:08.460]  They don't get like, dude, you're going to get caught with a super elaborate framing
[03:09:08.460 --> 03:09:09.460]  plan.
[03:09:09.460 --> 03:09:12.460]  There are people who have been removed from consequences in their life.
[03:09:12.460 --> 03:09:16.460]  So to some degree, what happened to his dad probably was highly educational and beneficial
[03:09:16.460 --> 03:09:20.460]  to Kushner, avoiding the same consequence and outcome, because he got to see what the
[03:09:20.460 --> 03:09:23.460]  real consequences were of that kind of insular conduct.
[03:09:23.460 --> 03:09:27.460]  And so it probably provided him a life edge that he would not otherwise have, and he would
[03:09:27.460 --> 03:09:28.460]  probably be less useful.
[03:09:28.460 --> 03:09:29.460]  Exactly.
[03:09:29.460 --> 03:09:31.460]  But just briefly, I want to have a few calls here.
[03:09:31.460 --> 03:09:35.460]  I've read about the story, but you broke it down a few weeks ago to me, really.
[03:09:35.460 --> 03:09:36.460]  What happened?
[03:09:36.460 --> 03:09:40.460]  So, I mean, basically, he did have some tax and a range of issues, but the people turning
[03:09:40.460 --> 03:09:43.460]  him in were his own sister-in-law and other people, his other close family members.
[03:09:43.460 --> 03:09:47.460]  So he tried to set them up with bogus hookers and in differences, try to set up her husband
[03:09:47.460 --> 03:09:51.460]  with a bogus hooker to try to extort him, to try to not provide evidence to the government,
[03:09:51.460 --> 03:09:55.460]  all of which backfired into creating new crimes that didn't even exist before he acted.
[03:09:55.460 --> 03:09:59.460]  So if he just would have had any IQ over 50 in the way he handled it, he would never
[03:09:59.460 --> 03:10:00.460]  have been prosecuted by Chris Christie.
[03:10:00.460 --> 03:10:05.460]  He was because Christie had no choice because he kept digging deeper and deeper and deeper
[03:10:05.460 --> 03:10:08.460]  holes that required some action or remedy be taken.
[03:10:08.460 --> 03:10:12.960]  So it was just a level of insanity that if someone who writes his own script and thinks
[03:10:12.960 --> 03:10:16.460]  that it's going to be successful, not understanding the audience.
[03:10:16.460 --> 03:10:17.460]  And that's who he was.
[03:10:17.460 --> 03:10:20.820]  But it did help the son in the sense that the son, unlike everyone else in his privileged
[03:10:20.820 --> 03:10:25.860]  group of upbringing, recognized what consequences can happen when you don't plan ahead, when
[03:10:25.860 --> 03:10:29.620]  you're not strategic, and when you think your own world is the only world that exists.
[03:10:29.620 --> 03:10:33.140]  And that's probably why he has been so much more beneficial to the president than he would
[03:10:33.140 --> 03:10:34.940]  have been without that life experience.
[03:10:34.940 --> 03:10:39.380]  And then the incestuousness of it, and that Chris Christie's in with Trump and everything,
[03:10:39.380 --> 03:10:43.140]  and then Kushner's in, and you know, Kushner doesn't like Chris Christie.
[03:10:43.140 --> 03:10:44.140]  Right.
[03:10:44.140 --> 03:10:46.860]  You knew sooner or later Chris Christie wasn't making it to the dance.
[03:10:46.860 --> 03:10:48.980]  So that's why he was the first guy to endorse Trump.
[03:10:48.980 --> 03:10:51.740]  He was hoping to overcome the fact that he put Kushner's dad in prison.
[03:10:51.740 --> 03:10:53.620]  I'm always impressed how much research he does.
[03:10:53.620 --> 03:10:57.820]  We were talking to Patis, a great lawyer, a Connecticut for the Sandy Hook political
[03:10:57.820 --> 03:10:58.820]  suits.
[03:10:58.820 --> 03:11:01.020]  And he's like, wow, I've actually watched all the videos.
[03:11:01.020 --> 03:11:02.140]  You never even said what they said.
[03:11:02.140 --> 03:11:03.460]  It is all edited.
[03:11:03.460 --> 03:11:08.860]  Barnes is right, but he's a great guy, but he was kind of reactively still like halfway
[03:11:08.860 --> 03:11:10.380]  believing what they say.
[03:11:10.380 --> 03:11:11.660]  You'd actually gone and looked at it all.
[03:11:11.660 --> 03:11:13.140]  I mean, they just lie about everything.
[03:11:13.140 --> 03:11:14.140]  Oh, completely.
[03:11:14.140 --> 03:11:15.140]  Not the family's lawyers.
[03:11:15.140 --> 03:11:16.140]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:11:16.140 --> 03:11:17.140]  Exactly.
[03:11:17.140 --> 03:11:19.460]  What's happened is you had the Connecticut lawsuit was based on a bunch of claims that
[03:11:19.460 --> 03:11:22.460]  they had to have known or should have known didn't exist.
[03:11:22.460 --> 03:11:25.180]  They were based on made up facts that just didn't happen.
[03:11:25.180 --> 03:11:28.740]  You know, there was no marketing or targeting of people in the manner that they were talking
[03:11:28.740 --> 03:11:29.740]  about.
[03:11:29.740 --> 03:11:33.660]  There was no attempts to, uh, to, to, to, yeah, that like one new story is like the
[03:11:33.660 --> 03:11:35.660]  holy grail and cash machine shootout.
[03:11:35.660 --> 03:11:37.620]  We have hundreds of videos today.
[03:11:37.620 --> 03:11:42.020]  Hundreds of articles, guess they, but they're saying that I'm living off this when it's
[03:11:42.020 --> 03:11:46.060]  really those Democrat lawyers and those groups that have been getting an office milking it
[03:11:46.060 --> 03:11:50.900]  without getting contributions, the American way, uh, families that have been keeping money.
[03:11:50.900 --> 03:11:53.860]  The truth is this is all coming out and they don't know the tar baby they've got involved
[03:11:53.860 --> 03:11:54.860]  in.
[03:11:54.860 --> 03:11:57.740]  We didn't make a damn dime off barely covering it.
[03:11:57.740 --> 03:12:00.900]  And then they get to cover it and bring it back up in my name.
[03:12:00.900 --> 03:12:02.540]  And that's what's sick.
[03:12:02.540 --> 03:12:10.620]  They hold me up like a ventriloquist ago and it's the lawyers doing it.
[03:12:10.620 --> 03:12:11.620]  Right.
[03:12:11.620 --> 03:12:15.860]  I think what happened is the lawyers got, uh, caught in Connecticut actually believing
[03:12:15.860 --> 03:12:17.060]  press coverage.
[03:12:17.060 --> 03:12:18.340]  They really believed the politicians.
[03:12:18.340 --> 03:12:19.340]  They really believed the press.
[03:12:19.340 --> 03:12:20.540]  They really believed the media matters.
[03:12:20.540 --> 03:12:21.900]  They assumed all that was accurate.
[03:12:21.900 --> 03:12:25.340]  I mean, even Joe Rogan said at one point he'd believed that what media matters put out was
[03:12:25.340 --> 03:12:28.260]  accurate and didn't realize until later it was completely inaccurate.
[03:12:28.260 --> 03:12:31.900]  And the way media matters disguised as the truth is they will bury within the article
[03:12:31.900 --> 03:12:33.540]  of their publication.
[03:12:33.540 --> 03:12:34.540]  The actual whole video.
[03:12:34.540 --> 03:12:37.620]  And if you go and watch the whole video, you realize, oh, they're completely mischaracterizing
[03:12:37.620 --> 03:12:38.740]  what took place here.
[03:12:38.740 --> 03:12:40.660]  They're completely mischaracterizing the conversation.
[03:12:40.660 --> 03:12:44.220]  They're completely mischaracterizing the scope of the issues, et cetera.
[03:12:44.220 --> 03:12:45.380]  The, but they, they don't do that.
[03:12:45.380 --> 03:12:48.780]  So that's where if you'd read and reviewed info wars during the entire time period, 90
[03:12:48.780 --> 03:12:53.860]  to 95% of all coverage does not say that Sandy Hook didn't happen in myths and acknowledges
[03:12:53.860 --> 03:12:55.220]  Sandy Hook did happen.
[03:12:55.220 --> 03:13:00.060]  So the, that in fact, what the issue was whether or not politicians were coming up with a different
[03:13:00.060 --> 03:13:02.620]  a reason as to why Sandy Hook happened.
[03:13:02.620 --> 03:13:06.660]  And they wanted to only the politicians of the press only wanted to blame a gun.
[03:13:06.660 --> 03:13:08.180]  They didn't want to blame the shooter.
[03:13:08.180 --> 03:13:10.100]  They didn't want to blame mental health treatment.
[03:13:10.100 --> 03:13:12.220]  They didn't want to blame psychotropic drugs.
[03:13:12.220 --> 03:13:14.980]  They didn't want to blame school security.
[03:13:14.980 --> 03:13:18.540]  They didn't want to blame school systems that didn't make the very simple choice of allowing
[03:13:18.540 --> 03:13:20.340]  teachers the means of locking their own doors.
[03:13:20.340 --> 03:13:24.220]  I mean, it's one thing to do the Israeli mechanism of protecting schools where teachers are trained
[03:13:24.220 --> 03:13:28.020]  and have arms available to them where they have not experienced any of these kinds of
[03:13:28.020 --> 03:13:30.020]  incidents where there's Islamists.
[03:13:30.020 --> 03:13:32.820]  When he's waiting for you with an AR 15, correct, exactly.
[03:13:32.820 --> 03:13:36.740]  And the time we have, and I apologize, the last callers call me and Robert back on Sunday,
[03:13:36.740 --> 03:13:40.500]  Carlos, Brian, Joey, Lee, George, Jacob, we just have so many calls coming in.
[03:13:40.500 --> 03:13:41.500]  I'll put you ahead of the line.
[03:13:41.500 --> 03:13:44.900]  I promise on Sunday, please call us.
[03:13:44.900 --> 03:13:48.500]  There's going to be a ruling in the third Sandy Hook suit followed here in Austin where
[03:13:48.500 --> 03:13:50.060]  I was sued by someone's name.
[03:13:50.060 --> 03:13:55.020]  I never even said all the law says you can't do that, but you, you're predicting they'll
[03:13:55.020 --> 03:13:56.020]  still push it on.
[03:13:56.020 --> 03:13:59.820]  We'll go to appeal and then come back and obviously go nowhere in the future.
[03:13:59.820 --> 03:14:04.620]  But that's why they're so upset, but they used basically these disingenuous lawsuits
[03:14:04.620 --> 03:14:10.740]  as the perception of my guilt for the deplatforming show their victory has already happened.
[03:14:10.740 --> 03:14:14.060]  The politicians in the press continue to misuse and mischaracterize these suits for their
[03:14:14.060 --> 03:14:16.500]  own partisan and personal purposes.
[03:14:16.500 --> 03:14:18.700]  And what's going to, but ultimately there'll be a decision.
[03:14:18.700 --> 03:14:22.620]  I think the court is a very thoughtful court is concerned with the First Amendment limitations
[03:14:22.620 --> 03:14:26.660]  has spoken about the significance of the constitutional issues involved.
[03:14:26.660 --> 03:14:31.380]  And it's torn between the emotional safety appeal of the plaintiffs versus the First
[03:14:31.380 --> 03:14:33.380]  Amendment appeal that we are making.
[03:14:33.380 --> 03:14:36.380]  And so whichever way the court decides in the court, I think it's 50, 50, which way
[03:14:36.380 --> 03:14:40.340]  the court goes, but ultimately this is going to, whether we appeal it or whether they appeal
[03:14:40.340 --> 03:14:41.980]  it, it's going to go up on appeal.
[03:14:41.980 --> 03:14:44.660]  So this is a decision that needs to be made by the highest court in the land.
[03:14:44.660 --> 03:14:46.140]  But they're going to run it as another victory.
[03:14:46.140 --> 03:14:49.180]  No, no, these courts are all punting to the appeal.
[03:14:49.180 --> 03:14:50.180]  Correct.
[03:14:50.180 --> 03:14:53.300]  I mean, all of them know that this is, but if the appeals court say you can sue somebody
[03:14:53.300 --> 03:14:56.500]  when you add and send their name, the country's going to be shut down by lawsuits.
[03:14:56.500 --> 03:14:57.500]  That's what's going to happen.
[03:14:57.500 --> 03:14:59.940]  The press is going to not be able to function as a free press.
[03:14:59.940 --> 03:15:04.220]  And like you said to me, even CNN in the Covington is arguing what you're saying now.
[03:15:04.220 --> 03:15:05.220]  Correct.
[03:15:05.220 --> 03:15:06.220]  So they can't have cake in here too.
[03:15:06.220 --> 03:15:07.220]  Exactly.
[03:15:07.220 --> 03:15:11.340]  CNN admits that your legal position in this case is the correct constitutional position.
[03:15:11.340 --> 03:15:16.100]  So they've admitted that in their filings in the Sandman related suits out of Kentucky.
[03:15:16.100 --> 03:15:20.340]  So all we're arguing is that we should have the same standards for everybody in the press,
[03:15:20.340 --> 03:15:22.460]  same standards for everybody in speech.
[03:15:22.460 --> 03:15:25.340]  And this is significant and you're the tip of the spear to protect the freedom of the
[03:15:25.340 --> 03:15:26.340]  press.
[03:15:26.340 --> 03:15:27.340]  You said that in court.
[03:15:27.340 --> 03:15:29.100]  The judge said he takes it very seriously.
[03:15:29.100 --> 03:15:32.700]  He wants to make it thoughtful and make an intelligent review and he's torn by what
[03:15:32.700 --> 03:15:33.700]  to do.
[03:15:33.700 --> 03:15:35.060]  And so I think he's going to make the best decision.
[03:15:35.060 --> 03:15:36.780]  He knows how in whichever way it goes.
[03:15:36.780 --> 03:15:40.460]  Ultimately, it's a decision that the U.S. Supreme Court's going to have to step on.
[03:15:40.460 --> 03:15:44.380]  And I think the fundamental decision to protect free press and free speech in this country
[03:15:44.380 --> 03:15:46.620]  will have the name Alex Jones in its title.
[03:15:46.620 --> 03:15:47.620]  Wow.

[03:20:15.460 --> 03:20:16.460]  Jones.
[03:20:16.460 --> 03:20:24.140]  And now, your host, Nick Baggage.
[03:20:24.140 --> 03:20:30.500]  And welcome back to ImpleWars, ImpleWars.com, and this is Dr. Nick Baggage standing in
[03:20:30.500 --> 03:20:34.700]  for Alex Jones today in this last hour.
[03:20:34.700 --> 03:20:41.540]  I appreciate, you know, kind of the beginning of this show, you know, we sort of ended on
[03:20:41.540 --> 03:20:46.420]  a note again of all the news, you know, sort of compiled in the week and sort of compressing
[03:20:46.420 --> 03:20:47.420]  in the week.
[03:20:47.420 --> 03:20:51.260]  And, you know, I don't know whether anyone knows it or not outside of Alaska, but certainly
[03:20:51.260 --> 03:20:57.860]  here in Alaska we know the Attorney General Barr is currently touring our state meeting
[03:20:57.860 --> 03:21:04.660]  with indigenous peoples out in really rural Alaska, in the sense of being off the main
[03:21:04.660 --> 03:21:08.500]  road system, getting an appreciation for what Alaska is.
[03:21:08.500 --> 03:21:16.060]  You know, we have 70 communities in Alaska without police protection as a basic thing
[03:21:16.060 --> 03:21:18.220]  in government services.
[03:21:18.220 --> 03:21:19.220]  We don't have it.
[03:21:19.220 --> 03:21:20.580]  I mean, none.
[03:21:20.580 --> 03:21:25.140]  You may have a hostage situation, which we often do here in Alaska.
[03:21:25.140 --> 03:21:31.300]  It might be, you know, six, eight hours before someone shows up because, you know, it takes
[03:21:31.300 --> 03:21:33.460]  that long to organize it and get there.
[03:21:33.460 --> 03:21:37.060]  And sometimes even longer if the weather's bad, it could be days.
[03:21:37.060 --> 03:21:46.100]  And so 70 communities off of roads, half of those don't have sewer systems running water,
[03:21:46.100 --> 03:21:50.420]  you know, kind of what, you know, we're building toilets in Afghanistan and around the world,
[03:21:50.420 --> 03:21:54.180]  but not in America, no way.
[03:21:54.180 --> 03:21:59.820]  So Barr's touring around and getting a sense of what justice is in the frontier world,
[03:21:59.820 --> 03:22:06.180]  a third world within a first world nation, which is what a lot of, unfortunately, rural
[03:22:06.180 --> 03:22:09.220]  Alaska is, as I think about it today.
[03:22:09.220 --> 03:22:14.300]  And the other announcement today, the big one is British Petroleum said the single
[03:22:14.300 --> 03:22:21.820]  biggest undeveloped oil, or excuse me, and gas, gas particularly, field in the world
[03:22:21.820 --> 03:22:26.300]  is the North Slope of Alaska and the region around it.
[03:22:26.300 --> 03:22:29.740]  And this is a massive oil basin.
[03:22:29.740 --> 03:22:34.260]  In fact, here's my predictions for the next three years, given what I've been reading.
[03:22:34.260 --> 03:22:37.820]  So this isn't some metaphysical nonsense.
[03:22:37.820 --> 03:22:42.740]  This is based on reading the literature and what's going on on the North Slope with the
[03:22:42.740 --> 03:22:51.140]  large globalist multinational companies as well as the smaller domestic Texas based predominantly
[03:22:51.140 --> 03:22:56.860]  and then some Australian based companies actually looking at the North Slope oil basins when
[03:22:56.860 --> 03:23:01.100]  you look at the very top of the state above the furthest mountain range.
[03:23:01.100 --> 03:23:04.540]  That entire area is essentially an oil and gas basin.
[03:23:04.540 --> 03:23:08.820]  And if you look at the map that's up, if you're able to see this on screen, all the
[03:23:08.820 --> 03:23:16.180]  offshore areas in the light blue that are the light shallow, really it's our shelf.
[03:23:16.180 --> 03:23:18.940]  All that is oil basin as well.
[03:23:18.940 --> 03:23:24.260]  And so this is being drilled and proven up and the oil pipeline at its peak when it was
[03:23:24.260 --> 03:23:31.220]  running at its peak did 2.2 million barrels a day just from one field Prudhoe Bay.
[03:23:31.220 --> 03:23:37.860]  And what's happening now, it's been producing about 500,000 more or less, half a million
[03:23:37.860 --> 03:23:43.580]  barrels a day for the last few years and declining and then going up and declining.
[03:23:43.580 --> 03:23:48.980]  But there's, in my view, there'll be another half a million barrels online and flowing
[03:23:48.980 --> 03:23:52.300]  within I would say five years.
[03:23:52.300 --> 03:23:55.980]  Just given what's been discovered on the North Slope and the smaller companies, the
[03:23:55.980 --> 03:24:02.780]  non-global companies, the domestic companies, don't think of this resource as a warehouse.
[03:24:02.780 --> 03:24:06.620]  Are they just keeping it in the ground like a safety deposit box because, hey, you can
[03:24:06.620 --> 03:24:10.900]  exploit the world where they might throw you out and keep your oil in the ground here,
[03:24:10.900 --> 03:24:12.180]  but it's not really their oil.
[03:24:12.180 --> 03:24:17.100]  It's yours and my oil and there's no performance requirements, they don't have to produce anything.
[03:24:17.100 --> 03:24:18.260]  So they're warehousing it.
[03:24:18.260 --> 03:24:23.660]  And now some of the other companies, Armstrong just sold a chunk of their rights, 400 million
[03:24:23.660 --> 03:24:24.660]  bucks.
[03:24:24.660 --> 03:24:29.900]  They got a $450 million option on remaining rights to two really impressive fields and
[03:24:29.900 --> 03:24:35.980]  a bunch of other things happening in Alaska with Armstrong and oil search and a bunch
[03:24:35.980 --> 03:24:37.220]  of others.
[03:24:37.220 --> 03:24:45.940]  But big things in oil and gas is the point and yet we have this whole primitive thing
[03:24:45.940 --> 03:24:52.060]  going on within our state in terms of being able to access roads or infrastructure of
[03:24:52.060 --> 03:24:58.580]  any kind and police protection and water and sewer and the basic things most of us take
[03:24:58.580 --> 03:24:59.860]  for granted.
[03:24:59.860 --> 03:25:04.900]  And so the opportunities too in rural Alaska are huge.
[03:25:04.900 --> 03:25:12.260]  Behind me on the screen is in the Wrangles St. Elias area and this is a property with
[03:25:12.260 --> 03:25:18.260]  partners I have up there and this is a big mineral zone as well, it's just a beautiful
[03:25:18.260 --> 03:25:19.260]  place.
[03:25:19.260 --> 03:25:24.580]  But the thing is Alaska has a lot of things that are the, in fact, the National Treasury
[03:25:24.580 --> 03:25:29.060]  something I've talked about a lot and it's good to see national leaders looking at some
[03:25:29.060 --> 03:25:34.020]  of the problems of Alaska and at the same time, from my perspective, the challenge that
[03:25:34.020 --> 03:25:41.340]  they present is also the opportunity to open up regions of the country that offer the country
[03:25:41.340 --> 03:25:42.340]  great opportunity.
[03:25:42.340 --> 03:25:46.620]  There's a railroad being discussed now, privately funded even, they're discussing privately
[03:25:46.620 --> 03:25:51.260]  funding a railroad link, something that those have listened to me on this broadcast and
[03:25:51.260 --> 03:25:55.900]  others over the last couple of years have heard me talking about and we're seeing it
[03:25:55.900 --> 03:25:56.900]  moving forward.
[03:25:56.900 --> 03:26:02.860]  You know, those are all good positive things when we think of the infrastructure of the
[03:26:02.860 --> 03:26:03.860]  country.
[03:26:03.860 --> 03:26:09.260]  And this is what I think Donald Trump is paying attention to is not just the P&L statement,
[03:26:09.260 --> 03:26:15.020]  the operating budgets and the income and the money out, but sort of the capital construction
[03:26:15.020 --> 03:26:20.860]  because real wealth is about building stuff, making stuff happen.
[03:26:20.860 --> 03:26:29.140]  My good friend, Dave Cuddy, who's from a multi-generational banking family here and he has a really great
[03:26:29.140 --> 03:26:33.780]  background in economics, was with me and we were discussing sort of the national scene
[03:26:33.780 --> 03:26:39.100]  and having an understanding of not just the P&L but the balance sheet, what are the resources
[03:26:39.100 --> 03:26:44.220]  and how are we deploying those in a meaningful way and we were talking about taxes and taxation
[03:26:44.220 --> 03:26:50.820]  and how much you end up paying and the bottom line to all of that is that the resentment
[03:26:50.820 --> 03:26:59.380]  isn't paying it, it's how it's being spent and fiddled away while the balance sheet,
[03:26:59.380 --> 03:27:03.700]  the real wealth of the nation is very rarely paid attention to unless somebody's trying
[03:27:03.700 --> 03:27:06.300]  to steal it or manipulate it.
[03:27:06.300 --> 03:27:11.700]  And what I really like about this present is identifying the balance sheet issues a
[03:27:11.700 --> 03:27:15.580]  little bit and thinking about the cash flow statement and looking at the bigger picture
[03:27:15.580 --> 03:27:18.220]  and saying, what can we do?
[03:27:18.220 --> 03:27:22.760]  And here in Alaska, the infrastructure to link it and I've talked about some of the
[03:27:22.760 --> 03:27:24.700]  political obstacles.
[03:27:24.700 --> 03:27:30.260]  One of them is the Jones Act and I know, bringing the Jones Act up, I anger a whole bunch of
[03:27:30.260 --> 03:27:36.260]  people and special interest groups who are vested in the Jones Act, which protects shipbuilding
[03:27:36.260 --> 03:27:37.260]  in America.
[03:27:37.260 --> 03:27:38.260]  And I get that.
[03:27:38.260 --> 03:27:42.220]  We want a shipbuilding industry in America for the military and all of those good reasons.
[03:27:42.220 --> 03:27:49.180]  But it's become really a hindrance at this moment because what it does is it restricts
[03:27:49.180 --> 03:27:55.940]  our ability to ship unless it's a U.S. flagship from a U.S. port to a U.S. port.
[03:27:55.940 --> 03:27:58.140]  We have to ship on a U.S. flagship.
[03:27:58.140 --> 03:28:03.980]  So from Alaska to the rest of the country, it always has to be U.S. flagged and that
[03:28:03.980 --> 03:28:10.940]  obstacle there is it means that all of our foreign competition gets to use foreign flagged
[03:28:10.940 --> 03:28:16.220]  vessels that cost it 10, 10% of what it costs to build a ship in the U.S.
[03:28:16.220 --> 03:28:20.980]  So their shipping costs, literally, and because of the way they crew them and everything else
[03:28:20.980 --> 03:28:23.860]  and the regulations, are a 10.
[03:28:23.860 --> 03:28:29.700]  So for 10% of the freight charges, you can ship to Asia versus 10 times that charge for
[03:28:29.700 --> 03:28:31.740]  me to ship to Seattle.
[03:28:31.740 --> 03:28:33.580]  You know, we're going to talk more about all this.
[03:28:33.580 --> 03:28:37.580]  We're going to talk about the upside of what we're doing is well after the break.
[03:28:37.580 --> 03:28:38.580]  It's coming up.
[03:28:38.580 --> 03:28:41.980]  And I want people to remember, support the InfoWars store.
[03:28:41.980 --> 03:28:45.340]  That's how this vital information gets to the public.

[03:29:59.660 --> 03:30:01.900]  you are changing the world?
[03:30:01.900 --> 03:30:05.620]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the Glove List.
[03:30:05.620 --> 03:30:10.180]  It is you, the Info Warriors, across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood
[03:30:10.180 --> 03:30:14.100]  against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[03:30:14.100 --> 03:30:18.940]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:30:18.940 --> 03:30:19.940]  You are the InfoWars.
[03:30:19.940 --> 03:30:25.020]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone
[03:30:25.020 --> 03:30:30.100]  go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the
[03:30:30.100 --> 03:30:35.980]  censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[03:30:35.980 --> 03:30:41.540]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos,
[03:30:41.540 --> 03:30:43.940]  to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[03:30:43.940 --> 03:30:51.020]  So bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:30:51.020 --> 03:30:56.060]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[03:30:56.060 --> 03:31:00.820]  It's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine.
[03:31:00.820 --> 03:31:05.460]  That's why we created the 8-Pack PowerStack, your go-to option for the building blocks
[03:31:05.460 --> 03:31:08.460]  of a successful approach to supplementation.

[03:31:51.740 --> 03:32:21.700]  supplement routine.
[03:32:21.740 --> 03:32:24.100]  Well, we need it now.
[03:32:24.100 --> 03:32:25.740]  You can take on Big Tech.
[03:32:25.740 --> 03:32:33.100]  They saw InfoWarriors as a dominant, independent, anti-war, pro-human, pro-sovereign, pro-family,
[03:32:33.100 --> 03:32:34.740]  populist organization.
[03:32:34.740 --> 03:32:39.460]  So they thought, first they come for Alex Jones, then when people say, okay, take him
[03:32:39.460 --> 03:32:42.740]  off the air, everyone else like Domino's would fall.
[03:32:42.740 --> 03:32:47.640]  The way to fight back is to support InfoWarriors now more than ever and make it a standard
[03:32:47.640 --> 03:32:49.460]  of freedom and free speech.
[03:32:49.460 --> 03:33:07.820]  Again, they believe they can take us down, they'll take everybody else down.
[03:33:07.820 --> 03:33:25.580]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Baggage.
[03:33:25.580 --> 03:33:30.140]  And welcome back to InfoWarriors and this is Dr. Nick Baggage.
[03:33:30.140 --> 03:33:35.540]  And the images now that are up and have our plan in the background of things from my life
[03:33:35.540 --> 03:33:36.540]  here in Alaska.
[03:33:36.540 --> 03:33:43.220]  So those that are watching get to see a good cross-section of Alaska and starting out the
[03:33:43.220 --> 03:33:51.220]  segment some sections of May from, man, 20, 25 years ago, even film that I was doing quite
[03:33:51.220 --> 03:33:52.620]  a long time ago.
[03:33:52.620 --> 03:33:58.060]  Anyway, back to this Jones Act that I want to talk about and how this screws America
[03:33:58.060 --> 03:34:00.940]  because it really does, it screws all of us.
[03:34:00.940 --> 03:34:08.500]  And I understand shipbuilding, but we need to make an exemption for Alaska at least because
[03:34:08.500 --> 03:34:13.420]  we have to have an opportunity to get our resources into the markets where value can
[03:34:13.420 --> 03:34:19.140]  be added by the industrial trades, by other American workers where value can be added
[03:34:19.140 --> 03:34:22.700]  because right now the only incentive is to export.
[03:34:22.700 --> 03:34:27.300]  So here we're producing raw goods, we're not adding any value because Alaska is too small
[03:34:27.300 --> 03:34:28.900]  of a population.
[03:34:28.900 --> 03:34:34.300]  We don't have a manufacturing base, but I would say this to those out there is we have
[03:34:34.300 --> 03:34:41.900]  reasonably cost energy and unlimited supplies in terms of gas, oil, coal, coal-to-liquids
[03:34:41.900 --> 03:34:49.420]  potential, geothermal, hydroelectric, 25% of Alaska's electricity is hydroelectric, almost
[03:34:49.420 --> 03:34:52.500]  all of it in Southeast Alaska is hydroelectric.
[03:34:52.500 --> 03:34:57.900]  This is like virtually fixed cost, almost free once you build the capital expense, especially
[03:34:57.900 --> 03:35:03.300]  small scale, which is what a lot of ours is, small developments of hydroelectric scattered
[03:35:03.300 --> 03:35:04.300]  about.
[03:35:04.300 --> 03:35:09.260]  And, you know, when you think about that as an input, it's about energy and then it's
[03:35:09.260 --> 03:35:12.580]  about transportation, information, communications.
[03:35:12.580 --> 03:35:15.820]  We don't have the basic transportation system for goodness sake.
[03:35:15.820 --> 03:35:18.380]  And the Jones Act, so it restricts us.
[03:35:18.380 --> 03:35:21.220]  So here's the example I want to use and I've used it before.
[03:35:21.220 --> 03:35:26.140]  You ship a container from China to Los Angeles, it's about a thousand bucks.
[03:35:26.140 --> 03:35:32.180]  You ship it halfway back from Los Angeles to Hawaii, as now you're on the US flag vessel,
[03:35:32.180 --> 03:35:39.580]  it's 8,000 bucks to 10,000 bucks for the same container, 10 times, 8 to 10 times as much.
[03:35:39.580 --> 03:35:45.380]  So if you're shipping raw minerals out of Alaska to somewhere where they can hook up
[03:35:45.380 --> 03:35:52.580]  with the trains, which is the closest place is going to be Canada or Japan, actually.
[03:35:52.580 --> 03:35:57.820]  And when you think about moving those resources into the West Coast of the United States and
[03:35:57.820 --> 03:36:04.140]  seeing again an industry build along the West Coast, an interior where rail can take minerals
[03:36:04.140 --> 03:36:05.700]  for processing.
[03:36:05.700 --> 03:36:06.900]  And we don't have that industry.
[03:36:06.900 --> 03:36:09.020]  A lot of that shutdown is gone.
[03:36:09.020 --> 03:36:10.420]  But can it revitalize?
[03:36:10.420 --> 03:36:15.820]  Yes, it can, where the population centers are, because a lot of these facilities, the modern
[03:36:15.820 --> 03:36:23.020]  ones are very labor efficient once they're constructed because a lot of it is mechanized.
[03:36:23.020 --> 03:36:26.900]  So you need high skilled labor that makes a lot of money, gets good jobs, but a lot
[03:36:26.900 --> 03:36:31.500]  of it is mechanized, it's going to be robotics and AI and that's the reality of it.
[03:36:31.500 --> 03:36:35.940]  But let it be in America for goodness sake and let us have the value here and be an exporter
[03:36:35.940 --> 03:36:43.180]  again because the competitive advantages will be energy production, raw materials production,
[03:36:43.180 --> 03:36:44.340]  skilled labor.
[03:36:44.340 --> 03:36:48.340]  These are the factors of economic production that I've talked about so often during this
[03:36:48.340 --> 03:36:51.300]  program over the last couple of years.
[03:36:51.300 --> 03:36:55.980]  And when you start adding these things together and combining with the entrepreneurship and
[03:36:55.980 --> 03:36:58.900]  creativity of Americans, we've got something.
[03:36:58.900 --> 03:37:02.620]  This is a frontier region, Alaska.
[03:37:02.620 --> 03:37:07.780]  It is 18% of the land mass of the United States and more coastline, as I've said before, than
[03:37:07.780 --> 03:37:12.980]  the Gulf Coast, West Coast, and East Coast of the continental United States combined
[03:37:12.980 --> 03:37:15.980]  altogether combined.
[03:37:15.980 --> 03:37:20.180]  That's what we are here and most of it is remote.
[03:37:20.180 --> 03:37:24.060]  You can't even drive there, you can't get there.
[03:37:24.060 --> 03:37:29.340]  It's like half the year it's so frozen you have to only fly in and some of these places
[03:37:29.340 --> 03:37:32.980]  are so small, it's very limited on how you get in and out.
[03:37:32.980 --> 03:37:38.260]  Snow machines over ice roads in the winter, down rivers and river systems that freeze
[03:37:38.260 --> 03:37:44.380]  over that we plow and maintain by the various villages along these rivers.
[03:37:44.380 --> 03:37:46.660]  And that's our road system for goodness sake.
[03:37:46.660 --> 03:37:53.620]  And this isn't 1880, this is 2019.
[03:37:53.620 --> 03:38:00.580]  My family has three generations of public service here, two at the federal level.
[03:38:00.580 --> 03:38:06.020]  And I think about this in terms of what's going on in the world and the country always
[03:38:06.020 --> 03:38:11.940]  screaming how horrible it is, how terrible it is, you know, and I hear that so much
[03:38:11.940 --> 03:38:16.300]  from the whiny left.
[03:38:16.300 --> 03:38:24.140]  This is a nation of opportunity if we would wake up and recognize the balance sheet and
[03:38:24.140 --> 03:38:26.020]  sort of the bigger picture.
[03:38:26.020 --> 03:38:30.660]  And what's happened is those who recognize it has dumbed down the population enough to
[03:38:30.660 --> 03:38:34.060]  forget about it and divert the attention to other dialogue.
[03:38:34.060 --> 03:38:35.740]  That's why these networks are so important.
[03:38:35.740 --> 03:38:40.860]  You know, you think about free speech and what the last segments of Alex has ended on
[03:38:40.860 --> 03:38:42.300]  was all about that.
[03:38:42.300 --> 03:38:48.100]  The fundamental values that give us these opportunities even have this discussion.
[03:38:48.100 --> 03:38:53.860]  Because if we don't have this discussion, then the hijacking of the national treasury
[03:38:53.860 --> 03:38:58.020]  continues in lots of different ways.
[03:38:58.020 --> 03:38:59.020]  You know, think about it.
[03:38:59.020 --> 03:39:04.260]  It's like the trillions and trillions of dollars like the big bank robbery.
[03:39:04.260 --> 03:39:09.780]  It's not 7-11 ladies and gentlemen being stuck up on the corner that they'll fill up the
[03:39:09.780 --> 03:39:15.060]  column inches about, you know, it's the trillion dollar robbery, you know, and they've been
[03:39:15.060 --> 03:39:20.860]  going kind of in sequence and see robber barons, you know, after the civil war.
[03:39:20.860 --> 03:39:21.860]  And here's the thing.
[03:39:21.860 --> 03:39:27.500]  And I talk about it often as multi-generational memory, remembering, you know, about, you
[03:39:27.500 --> 03:39:31.300]  know, sort of what came before and how it adds up to where we are today.
[03:39:31.300 --> 03:39:35.940]  And you never have enough time to tell that story, you know, so we break it into these
[03:39:35.940 --> 03:39:41.500]  might-size bits to kick out, to generate the kind of discussion that ought to be happening.
[03:39:41.500 --> 03:39:50.180]  And you know, when I think about each of these things represent the illusion, the fact that
[03:39:50.180 --> 03:39:57.820]  the cultural matrix that's been created around us through media, and now the, and then it
[03:39:57.820 --> 03:40:02.300]  was the liberation of media by giving us this thing called the Internet, which in fact became
[03:40:02.300 --> 03:40:09.820]  the biggest control mechanism ever created by man, the opposite because of the current
[03:40:09.820 --> 03:40:10.820]  state of affairs.
[03:40:10.820 --> 03:40:14.900]  And that's why the litigation that info wars is carrying forward and others are carrying
[03:40:14.900 --> 03:40:16.940]  forward needs to continue.
[03:40:16.940 --> 03:40:23.180]  If it doesn't, we are all lost, you know, because this globalist thing with the Internet
[03:40:23.180 --> 03:40:28.900]  wrapped around it and the next version of that, which I can get into maybe in the next segment,
[03:40:28.900 --> 03:40:33.420]  which is the mind effects manipulation of it.
[03:40:33.420 --> 03:40:38.140]  First in the simplest way, the cultural context, why not just go there?
[03:40:38.140 --> 03:40:42.660]  Let's just go there, you know, because look at everything we're talking about that's
[03:40:42.660 --> 03:40:47.060]  relevant today and that you've heard for the last several hours, if you've been listening,
[03:40:47.060 --> 03:40:50.260]  you're going to hear when Owen comes on in the next hour.
[03:40:50.260 --> 03:40:57.980]  All of these things, you would be denied if the powers that be would have their way.
[03:40:57.980 --> 03:41:05.820]  And is this what our founding fathers, I don't care whether you're liberal left or conservative
[03:41:05.820 --> 03:41:12.860]  right, is this what blood has been shed for for 250 years on this continent, others?
[03:41:12.860 --> 03:41:14.460]  I don't think so.
[03:41:14.460 --> 03:41:21.540]  It's the voice, the cry of conspiracy, you know, sometimes, you know what, they turn
[03:41:21.540 --> 03:41:27.260]  out to be true and we don't should not wait for historians in a world where we can discern
[03:41:27.260 --> 03:41:29.100]  and we can sort out.
[03:41:29.100 --> 03:41:34.900]  What we should be saying is no, don't restrict what's heard, but certainly teach people how
[03:41:34.900 --> 03:41:40.100]  to critically analyze what they're thinking, but don't screen it out, no way, man, slippery
[03:41:40.100 --> 03:41:41.100]  slope.
[03:41:41.100 --> 03:41:43.060]  This network is about protecting that.
[03:41:43.060 --> 03:41:49.740]  I think it's incumbent on all of us to invest in that, the IMPO award.
[03:41:49.740 --> 03:41:53.820]  And I think we're going to see some really great outcomes, I believe that, I sincerely
[03:41:53.820 --> 03:41:54.820]  do.
[03:41:54.820 --> 03:42:01.180]  And let's talk about that illusion, starting with the easiest way to keep people from effective
[03:42:01.180 --> 03:42:08.180]  effort is keep you in a state of anxiety and fear and agitation, and look at the left,
[03:42:08.180 --> 03:42:11.700]  how easy they succumb to it and how angry.
[03:42:11.700 --> 03:42:16.660]  How really, really angry everyone is, how out of control that anger takes them.
[03:42:16.660 --> 03:42:25.340]  This is not what we were destined to do as living souls, as created human beings in the
[03:42:25.340 --> 03:42:30.980]  image and likeness of God, for goodness sake.
[03:42:30.980 --> 03:42:34.380]  Reframe it, we got an opportunity, you know, we're going into the break.
[03:42:34.380 --> 03:42:40.100]  I want to come back up on the next hour talking about cracking the illusion and the delusion,
[03:42:40.100 --> 03:42:43.940]  breaking that zombie trance, because that's what's going on.

[03:44:16.660 --> 03:44:18.500]  a soup that was sick.

[03:45:00.100 --> 03:45:03.340]  That's why supplements are the biggest growing industry in the world and the globalists are
[03:45:03.340 --> 03:45:04.740]  so upset.
[03:45:04.740 --> 03:45:10.420]  The problem is people forget to take them and that's why the whole industry has moved
[03:45:10.420 --> 03:45:13.940]  towards packets that you take in the morning and you take at night.
[03:45:13.940 --> 03:45:14.940]  So we looked at that.

[03:47:14.540 --> 03:47:26.340]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind with Nick Begich.
[03:47:26.340 --> 03:47:30.260]  And welcome back to InfoWars, those that are watching.
[03:47:30.260 --> 03:47:35.420]  You've seen some images of me out on one of my remote properties and some of the travel
[03:47:35.420 --> 03:47:39.220]  around Alaska, different points in the last few years.
[03:47:39.220 --> 03:47:43.340]  You know, man, picking it up where we left off.
[03:47:43.340 --> 03:47:45.060]  It always is a combination with me.
[03:47:45.060 --> 03:47:49.260]  You see, with the information that's relevant, I mean, in terms of how we sort of view the
[03:47:49.260 --> 03:47:53.340]  world and sort of the facts around it, and my interpretation of some of that.
[03:47:53.340 --> 03:47:59.180]  And then also the value system that allows us maybe to kind of pierce the veil of it,
[03:47:59.180 --> 03:48:05.020]  if you will, of looking at the world from the perspective of, all right, you know, if
[03:48:05.020 --> 03:48:10.660]  we're truly stewards, caretakers, you know, I mean, think about it as stewardship question.
[03:48:10.660 --> 03:48:19.340]  How do we look at what's here and are lifted by it, if you will, you know, where it serves
[03:48:19.340 --> 03:48:25.020]  us in some way, and we serve it in a protective and sensible way, you know, where, I mean,
[03:48:25.020 --> 03:48:30.460]  you look at the scene behind me, this property is going to be developed for both mining and
[03:48:30.460 --> 03:48:31.460]  tourism.
[03:48:31.460 --> 03:48:32.460]  You know, isn't that interesting?
[03:48:32.460 --> 03:48:37.060]  And it's like a half a mile to 600 feet, depending on where you sit on it.
[03:48:37.060 --> 03:48:41.100]  I'm a wilderness area that'll never be developed and never see a road, nothing, you know, it'll
[03:48:41.100 --> 03:48:43.020]  be nothing.
[03:48:43.020 --> 03:48:45.220]  That's like several million acres.
[03:48:45.220 --> 03:48:52.980]  And you know, when you think about Alaska, you know, we have 104 million acres of national
[03:48:52.980 --> 03:48:56.140]  parks and preserves there already.
[03:48:56.140 --> 03:48:58.180]  That's pretty big, you know, that's like unreal.
[03:48:58.180 --> 03:49:02.060]  Most of them you can't get to, and unless you're really rich, you'll never see them
[03:49:02.060 --> 03:49:04.380]  because they're so expensive to get to.
[03:49:04.380 --> 03:49:10.940]  But they preserve part of our planet, that's kind of cool, you know, and I see that.
[03:49:10.940 --> 03:49:15.980]  And the balancing act between those regions and the regions that can be developed for
[03:49:15.980 --> 03:49:24.180]  oil, gas and minerals often overlap and the ability to develop strategies that work as
[03:49:24.180 --> 03:49:29.660]  stewards of both of the land and people that benefit from the land.
[03:49:29.660 --> 03:49:31.060]  And that's us, you know.
[03:49:31.060 --> 03:49:43.660]  And Alaska has the most stringent environmental regulations anywhere in the United States.
[03:49:43.660 --> 03:49:47.500]  Really do what should be happening here, and there's a lot of reasons for that, and I'm
[03:49:47.500 --> 03:49:50.580]  never going to have enough time to give you all of them, you know.
[03:49:50.580 --> 03:49:54.660]  But you can go back again historically and look at what's happened in Alaska.
[03:49:54.660 --> 03:49:58.500]  Always been about resource extraction, you know, go back to the Russians and they started
[03:49:58.500 --> 03:50:05.580]  up the elution chain as they were working their way up that chain of islands 2,000 miles
[03:50:05.580 --> 03:50:10.020]  long stretching animals to Japan and to Russia.
[03:50:10.020 --> 03:50:13.700]  They were doing the fur trade, you know, and they were then taking those furs and they
[03:50:13.700 --> 03:50:17.660]  were taking them to China where they got an incredible wealth for them.
[03:50:17.660 --> 03:50:22.780]  And they had kind of this triangle going and they enslaved the Alliutes along that route
[03:50:22.780 --> 03:50:27.380]  and then they brought in the Orthodox Church, which just sort of did this other cultural
[03:50:27.380 --> 03:50:28.780]  thing to them.
[03:50:28.780 --> 03:50:32.620]  And then we brought in the disease and disorder and all the chaos that went with it.
[03:50:32.620 --> 03:50:37.860]  But at the end of the day, they got into the southeast Alaska, the clinkets and the Hytas
[03:50:37.860 --> 03:50:44.380]  kicked them back, threw them out, they couldn't go inland, the Athabascans never let them.
[03:50:44.380 --> 03:50:49.060]  The clinkets and Hytas along the coast didn't let them either.
[03:50:49.060 --> 03:50:56.100]  And so eventually, and there's point of time in the 1800s where the Tsar of Russia decided
[03:50:56.100 --> 03:50:59.980]  the way America was kind of rolling, they were probably going to take it anyway, might
[03:50:59.980 --> 03:51:00.980]  as well sell it.
[03:51:00.980 --> 03:51:05.940]  So we bought it, two cents an acre, that was as the theory goes in the Treaty of Secession
[03:51:05.940 --> 03:51:08.220]  by 1867.
[03:51:08.220 --> 03:51:13.300]  And the next thing began, it was kind of a Seward's Folly, a big joke in Washington.
[03:51:13.300 --> 03:51:19.140]  But what happened next was copper and gold and silver were discovered and then the next
[03:51:19.140 --> 03:51:20.820]  rush was on.
[03:51:20.820 --> 03:51:27.940]  That expired only at World War II where it was no longer priority industries.
[03:51:27.940 --> 03:51:29.540]  And so they shut them all down.
[03:51:29.540 --> 03:51:31.460]  That was kind of the end of it.
[03:51:31.460 --> 03:51:34.020]  After the war, everything had quadrupled in price.
[03:51:34.020 --> 03:51:39.580]  You couldn't restart mines with gold at a fixed price and everything else inflated 400%.
[03:51:39.580 --> 03:51:40.580]  So it never did.
[03:51:40.580 --> 03:51:41.580]  It just died.
[03:51:41.580 --> 03:51:42.700]  The place just died.
[03:51:42.700 --> 03:51:44.420]  They never built the infrastructure.
[03:51:44.420 --> 03:51:47.700]  All the railroads that were planned for Alaska never got built.
[03:51:47.700 --> 03:51:50.140]  And there was a whole network of them.
[03:51:50.140 --> 03:51:55.700]  They were going to start down in Cordova and continue into the interior from there.
[03:51:55.700 --> 03:51:58.140]  And they were going to go off of Anchorage into the interior.
[03:51:58.140 --> 03:52:03.380]  Some of that got built, Seward, Whittier, those got built, going up to Fairbanks.
[03:52:03.380 --> 03:52:09.060]  But they never flanked the southern bed of the Brooks Range, go out to McGrath and on
[03:52:09.060 --> 03:52:12.620]  into Nome and connect the regions of Alaska.
[03:52:12.620 --> 03:52:18.780]  And these mineral belts, these huge, huge mineral belts and interdispersed by oil and
[03:52:18.780 --> 03:52:20.420]  gas basins.
[03:52:20.420 --> 03:52:23.620]  And that's the national treasury, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:52:23.620 --> 03:52:27.660]  That is being lost in this whole discussion.
[03:52:27.660 --> 03:52:29.460]  No one even talks about it, you know?
[03:52:29.460 --> 03:52:36.020]  And so here's the voice from the wilderness on the info wars telling you, ladies and
[03:52:36.020 --> 03:52:42.900]  gentlemen, that we have this opportunity to make America great again by including Alaska
[03:52:42.900 --> 03:52:46.460]  in the equation in the average American thinking.
[03:52:46.460 --> 03:52:52.820]  We have only 750,000 people that live here in a region that takes up almost one-fifth
[03:52:52.820 --> 03:52:55.620]  of the whole land mass of the whole nation.
[03:52:55.620 --> 03:53:01.620]  Gee, I think population is a problem, but the problem is it's run in the wrong direction.
[03:53:01.620 --> 03:53:06.380]  You know, we don't have a population, we don't have an infrastructure, we don't have a connection
[03:53:06.380 --> 03:53:13.940]  to the rest of the nation by road and a preemption by the Jones Act for the proper trade.
[03:53:13.940 --> 03:53:20.660]  You know, it takes four hours from Anchorage for me to fly to Seattle, the next closest
[03:53:20.660 --> 03:53:28.780]  major U.S. city, four hours to fly there in a commercial airliner, all right?
[03:53:28.780 --> 03:53:36.580]  Now think about this, ladies and gentlemen, in perspective of the nation to try and get
[03:53:36.580 --> 03:53:38.780]  that perspective a little bit.
[03:53:38.780 --> 03:53:45.700]  It's like going from Anchorage to Prudhoe Bay is like me going from Seattle to San Francisco,
[03:53:45.700 --> 03:53:49.380]  you know, or maybe somewhere midway down California's coast.
[03:53:49.380 --> 03:53:54.060]  But the point is, it's big and there's no roads, you have more roads in Seattle than
[03:53:54.060 --> 03:53:56.660]  my whole state where I live.
[03:53:56.660 --> 03:54:00.660]  And think about it, more roads in one major city, the closest major city in the whole
[03:54:00.660 --> 03:54:07.740]  state that connects our national treasury, or I should say doesn't connect our national
[03:54:07.740 --> 03:54:09.260]  treasury.
[03:54:09.260 --> 03:54:15.940]  And you know, when you start to think about the nation and the possibilities, think too
[03:54:15.940 --> 03:54:20.540]  of the balance sheet, okay, what can we do to include our infrastructure?
[03:54:20.540 --> 03:54:25.540]  So there's a program, there's something going on right now and it's happening with a discussion
[03:54:25.540 --> 03:54:31.500]  between a Canadian entrepreneur and there's some ports that were built and some rail links
[03:54:31.500 --> 03:54:33.780]  that are needed and some easements have been granted.
[03:54:33.780 --> 03:54:39.900]  But there's a whole discussion now about extending the Canadian rail system into Alaska
[03:54:39.900 --> 03:54:48.900]  for the purpose of moving heavy oils out of Alaska by rail and out of Canada by rail actually
[03:54:48.900 --> 03:54:51.980]  to the coast, which you know, kind of moving the freight the other direction.
[03:54:51.980 --> 03:54:57.620]  But the other thing it does is it shaves two days off of Asian transport.
[03:54:57.620 --> 03:55:02.380]  If you bring it first from Asia to Alaska, put it on rail and take to the east coast
[03:55:02.380 --> 03:55:08.400]  and ship it, you shave two days off of Asian transport into Europe.
[03:55:08.400 --> 03:55:15.780]  So that this route would open up commodities flowing out of Alaska and avoid the Jones
[03:55:15.780 --> 03:55:19.100]  Act fight, I guess, which is fine.
[03:55:19.100 --> 03:55:23.060]  But rail is maybe a good alternative and you know who always objects to rail being linked
[03:55:23.060 --> 03:55:27.380]  to Alaska is the Longshoremen's Union, because somehow they think they're not going to get
[03:55:27.380 --> 03:55:28.380]  the freight.
[03:55:28.380 --> 03:55:31.580]  Yeah, you're right, they're not going to get the freight for the ore going out because
[03:55:31.580 --> 03:55:34.820]  they made it so uneconomic they can't.
[03:55:34.820 --> 03:55:39.580]  But what they will get, whether they like it or not, is more railroad jobs and more
[03:55:39.580 --> 03:55:44.780]  teamster jobs and more operating engineers jobs and more every other craft job.
[03:55:44.780 --> 03:55:46.300]  And guess what?
[03:55:46.300 --> 03:55:52.300]  More freight coming into those ports to support all that growth and more Longshoremen jobs
[03:55:52.300 --> 03:55:53.300]  too.
[03:55:53.300 --> 03:55:57.940]  And this is a short-sightedness of people's self-interest and this is what is called special
[03:55:57.940 --> 03:55:58.940]  interest.
[03:55:58.940 --> 03:56:04.020]  I don't want to talk about that because special interest is what is corrupted and destroyed
[03:56:04.020 --> 03:56:06.180]  this country and continues to do so.
[03:56:06.180 --> 03:56:10.620]  And now it's being done with the technocracy that I've talked so often about and again
[03:56:10.620 --> 03:56:16.860]  weaving back into these underlying themes that are raping us.
[03:56:16.860 --> 03:56:22.220]  You know, I mean, we are the stewards with an opportunity to continue the progress of
[03:56:22.220 --> 03:56:29.660]  250 years and we are being jerked around by globalists telling us how poor we are and
[03:56:29.660 --> 03:56:36.420]  how horrible it is and oh gosh, this guy is going to be falling and it's untrue, it's
[03:56:36.420 --> 03:56:39.300]  a lie and it's nonsense.
[03:56:39.300 --> 03:56:46.780]  And the thing is people buy the story and then the whole underlying emphasis of the
[03:56:46.780 --> 03:56:49.460]  drama we co-create shifts.
[03:56:49.460 --> 03:56:51.660]  And now it is the culture war.
[03:56:51.660 --> 03:56:58.820]  It is a war over ideology and thinking, but it should not be a war of tribalism that drives
[03:56:58.820 --> 03:57:00.140]  us apart.
[03:57:00.140 --> 03:57:08.180]  It should be a bigger war, a different war, a war that's fought internally as we recognize
[03:57:08.180 --> 03:57:13.900]  the divinity that we are as created human beings and begin to express that in our world
[03:57:13.900 --> 03:57:19.860]  as stewards and as good brothers and sisters to one another whether we like each other
[03:57:19.860 --> 03:57:21.980]  all the time or not.
[03:57:21.980 --> 03:57:25.140]  That's the hardest challenge in the 21st century.
[03:57:25.140 --> 03:57:30.100]  To be the divinity that we were created to be on earth and at least behave that way.
[03:57:30.100 --> 03:57:32.940]  We're going to be right back after these brief messages.
[03:57:32.940 --> 03:57:34.620]  Remember the Info Wars.
[03:57:34.620 --> 03:57:37.860]  We have something to say and all of us are the tip of the spear.
[03:57:37.860 --> 03:57:38.860]  Thank you for listening.
[03:57:38.860 --> 03:58:04.860]  We'll be right back.
[03:58:04.860 --> 03:58:30.860]  We'll be right back.
[03:58:30.860 --> 03:58:46.860]  We'll be right back.
[03:58:46.860 --> 03:58:51.380]  One of the most incredible cups of coffee can be found in the high mountains of southern
[03:58:51.380 --> 03:58:56.860]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers have spent years perfecting their techniques based off
[03:58:56.860 --> 03:59:01.060]  hundreds of years of traditional techniques and perfect conditions.
