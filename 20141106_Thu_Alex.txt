[00:00.000 --> 00:12.720]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.720 --> 00:20.280]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:20.280 --> 00:41.840]  Texas Alex Jones
[00:41.840 --> 00:47.840]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday
[00:47.840 --> 00:53.480]  already the sixth day of November 2014 we're going to have open phones yet
[00:53.480 --> 00:57.720]  again Paul Joseph Watson is going to be joining us from London England he was
[00:57.720 --> 01:03.400]  scanning over news articles and discovered buried in a Forbes article
[01:03.400 --> 01:10.240]  the admission by a major pharmacologist that there is a system-wide
[01:10.240 --> 01:17.440]  government directive to cover up and not report suspected Ebola cases that there
[01:17.440 --> 01:27.640]  is a cover-up going on now remember that we had Dr. Lorenzi on by name a few
[01:27.640 --> 01:33.240]  weeks ago and they didn't counter what he said in Missouri that he was told by
[01:33.240 --> 01:36.200]  their doctors that people that look like they had Ebola or being disappeared
[01:36.200 --> 01:40.680]  no he was just basically ostracized and we confirmed through another medical
[01:40.680 --> 01:45.440]  doctor who heads up a large hospital group I'll leave it at that in Dallas that I
[01:45.440 --> 01:51.160]  know personally that indeed that is going on in fact he told us that before
[01:51.160 --> 01:56.080]  Dr. Lorenzi and we mentioned that we talked to a medical doctor on air and
[01:56.080 --> 02:00.600]  so this was happening and then Dr. Lorenzi called in to say yeah that's
[02:00.600 --> 02:06.480]  going on at the Harry Truman Hospital up here in Missouri so I will delve back
[02:06.480 --> 02:14.320]  some into Ebola today or obola we will delve back into it because clearly if
[02:14.320 --> 02:16.800]  you've already had cases showing up they're letting more flights come in
[02:16.800 --> 02:23.440]  from Africa and country struck while it's spreading and beginning to make it's
[02:23.440 --> 02:28.920]  a scent towards the peak as many as 1.4 million people the UN computer models
[02:28.920 --> 02:33.560]  show well if you've got a couple hundred thousand with it in Ebola cases have
[02:33.560 --> 02:36.240]  gotten here and you're gonna get over a million with it and they're gonna let the
[02:36.240 --> 02:40.600]  flights come in I think it's a safe bet to say more Ebola is gonna come here not
[02:40.600 --> 02:43.280]  saying it's gonna spread everywhere and kill everybody but it's a pretty big
[02:43.280 --> 02:47.120]  deal for those that get it why aren't they trying to stop it why are they
[02:47.120 --> 02:50.520]  turning the default positions off we've we've hashed all this out and I've been
[02:50.520 --> 02:55.440]  saying if there is a cover-up of Ebola which I think there is to a certain
[02:55.440 --> 03:01.280]  extent bare minimum I pray it's not big cover-up going on that is a cover-up of
[03:01.280 --> 03:06.240]  a bunch of cases but we're going to find out very quickly after the midterm
[03:06.240 --> 03:10.360]  elections well midterm elections were two days ago or a day and a half ago and
[03:10.360 --> 03:15.400]  already we're seeing statements in Forbes media agrees not to report on
[03:15.400 --> 03:23.600]  suspected Ebola cases in pharmacologists reveals how US press and
[03:23.600 --> 03:28.480]  other press for that matter has bowed to government demand to keep Americans in
[03:28.480 --> 03:36.840]  the dark which creates more concern so we've got Paul Watson coming on in about
[03:36.840 --> 03:40.960]  10 minutes to break this down with us briefly and I'll get into the other
[03:40.960 --> 03:45.440]  Ebola news that we have here in the stack as well then I'm going to shift gears
[03:45.440 --> 03:50.640]  into the latest on the seismic realignment we've seen election 2014
[03:50.640 --> 03:55.560]  the midterms that Matt Drudge said two years ago are everything and predicted
[03:55.560 --> 04:01.360]  would be either a major realignment or the signal that you can stick a fork in
[04:01.360 --> 04:07.480]  the US were done and so even though I don't expect puppy dogs and kittens to
[04:07.480 --> 04:13.440]  fly and everything to be fine now the fact that the US repudiated
[04:13.440 --> 04:19.160]  collectivism crony capitalism and all the different variants of this quasi
[04:19.160 --> 04:23.240]  fascist system shows that we're not completely brain dead and there's a
[04:23.240 --> 04:28.680]  huge awakening taking place that we're in the fight it doesn't mean everything's
[04:28.680 --> 04:32.840]  fine it doesn't mean that I think the Republicans are gonna save us but it is
[04:32.840 --> 04:38.360]  a good sign a very good sign and it's a good sign the Republican Democratic
[04:38.360 --> 04:43.280]  leadership and the establishment state-run media what Rush calls the
[04:43.280 --> 04:49.160]  drive-by media are lined up against the Tea Party because the Tea Party is not
[04:49.160 --> 04:55.240]  radical it's just basic old-fashioned freedom and so that's why it's the
[04:55.240 --> 05:01.120]  enemy because it's the cure to the disease of collectivism the government's
[05:01.120 --> 05:04.720]  Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo at the same
[05:04.720 --> 05:09.160]  time the restricting civilians rights to own and purchase firearms can you put

[08:37.880 --> 08:45.440]  November 2014 on this Thursday edition well guess who we have coming on to
[08:45.440 --> 08:51.040]  give us his expert inside take on Ebola he's been to Africa many times and
[08:51.040 --> 08:57.320]  researched it in depth he is Steven Hatfield doctor Steven Hatfield the
[08:57.320 --> 09:03.120]  virologist and bio weapons expert who what who went went what many believed
[09:03.120 --> 09:08.800]  was a trial by the media and a witch hunt by the FBI and others to pin the
[09:08.800 --> 09:19.880]  anthrax attacks of 2001 on him he is going to be joining us to talk Ebola and
[09:19.880 --> 09:27.360]  more and the Pentagon working on an airborne Ebola vaccine that's coming up
[09:27.360 --> 09:31.080]  Paul Watson will be joining us here in about five minutes to discuss this
[09:31.080 --> 09:39.280]  breaking news on info wars dot com US media gets in line dutifully except for
[09:39.280 --> 09:47.640]  Forbes and they are reporting what we started reporting back in October when
[09:47.640 --> 09:52.440]  we had a medical doctor on record on air listing the hospital where people that
[09:52.440 --> 09:55.720]  appeared to have Ebola were being disappeared by the feds regardless whether
[09:55.720 --> 10:03.040]  they had a bowler or not they're being disappeared that's the big story we were
[10:03.040 --> 10:07.840]  told that by high-level board patrol on record and off record as well so proofs
[10:07.840 --> 10:12.920]  in the pudding we are bringing you the people these sources by name and then for
[10:12.920 --> 10:18.920]  every source it'll come on here we have let's not exaggerate 20 30 more that
[10:18.920 --> 10:25.640]  won't sending us police sending us their IDs doctors sending us
[10:25.640 --> 10:28.640]  their IDs because we just don't just believe somebody because the emails we
[10:28.640 --> 10:32.680]  have them send us a copy of their ID we call them at work we talk to them and
[10:32.680 --> 10:36.840]  then keep them off record if they want to be off record but we verify and that
[10:36.840 --> 10:40.640]  takes a lot of courage just what they're doing at that level well I was not
[10:40.640 --> 10:44.360]  happy when I saw Paul Joseph Watson's article this morning because I don't want
[10:44.360 --> 10:51.200]  Ebola to start spreading I don't want to be right I don't want to be correct but
[10:51.200 --> 10:55.480]  clearly of all this Ebola's already gotten out of Africa and they're leaving
[10:55.480 --> 11:00.000]  the borders wide open and it's not set to peak till January with 1.4 million
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.600]  people set to get it in the UN computer models you're going to have more people
[11:04.600 --> 11:08.600]  that make it over here and Obama has said to expect that and he has said he
[11:08.600 --> 11:15.080]  expects to see more cases well you get a chain reaction in cold weather where the
[11:15.080 --> 11:24.400]  virus can live upwards of two weeks on surfaces Pentagon says 20 days and it is
[11:24.400 --> 11:30.560]  airborne essentially then we could have a hella situation in this country well
[11:30.560 --> 11:35.640]  here's the headline info wars.com media agrees not to report on suspected
[11:35.640 --> 11:41.280]  Ebola cases in the US pharmacologist reveals how press has bowed to government
[11:41.280 --> 11:48.080]  demand to Americans to keep Americans in the dark and we link through to the
[11:48.080 --> 11:53.360]  Forbes article at info wars.com and Prisapada.com in Paul Watson's article
[11:53.360 --> 11:57.840]  an eyebrow-raising admission at the end of a Forbes article written by
[11:57.840 --> 12:03.960]  pharmacologist David Kroll reveals that the media has agreed not to report on
[12:03.960 --> 12:08.680]  suspected Ebola cases in the United States in a piece entitled Liberia
[12:08.680 --> 12:14.640]  Travel Traveler at Duke Hospital shows preliminary negative results for Ebola
[12:14.640 --> 12:18.920]  Kroll describes attending a press conference involving Department of
[12:18.920 --> 12:26.080]  Health and Human Services Secretary Wose Aldana Wose after revealing that an
[12:26.080 --> 12:30.840]  unnamed official abruptly called the press conference to a close when Wose
[12:30.840 --> 12:35.840]  was asked a difficult question about this suspected Ebola victim Kroll then
[12:35.840 --> 12:43.280]  drops a bombshell. The Associated Press and other press outlets have agreed not
[12:43.280 --> 12:48.240]  to report on suspected cases of Ebola in the United States until a positive
[12:48.240 --> 12:54.400]  viral RNA test is completed he writes but by then they've been whisk away to a
[12:54.400 --> 12:58.800]  secret location you understand people are dying on airplanes out of West
[12:58.800 --> 13:03.640]  Africa vomiting to death with blood spewing out their air ends that's why
[13:03.640 --> 13:08.400]  for a month and a half at JFK they they have strikers who won't clean the
[13:08.400 --> 13:13.480]  airplanes and who won't go to the airport you think they want to lose their
[13:13.480 --> 13:16.600]  jobs people to clean those airplanes they're scared folks because there's
[13:16.600 --> 13:20.680]  blood and vomit on them you got blood and vomit planes coming into Houston
[13:20.680 --> 13:24.000]  that's been in the news there blood and vomit planes coming into North Carolina
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  into Raleigh and other areas that's been in local news blood and vomit planes
[13:28.000 --> 13:31.400]  coming into New York blood and vomit planes coming into Chicago blood and
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.280]  vomit planes coming into Dallas but it's always a little local or oh they were
[13:35.280 --> 13:39.000]  vomiting and bleeding but you'll hear within an hour the plane landing in the
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.240]  panic they tested negative for Ebola when they can't test that quickly I mean
[13:46.240 --> 13:52.240]  clearly some of these people coming in who die at the airport in Houston die
[13:52.240 --> 13:56.400]  at the airport when the police go to check at their house and see you notice
[13:56.400 --> 14:00.800]  it's always local police and EMTs and neighbors that are reporting it not the
[14:00.800 --> 14:06.800]  feds it's the police in New York who aren't completely federalized that went
[14:06.800 --> 14:12.680]  no this doctor that brought in a boa lied he traveled all over the place to
[14:12.680 --> 14:20.320]  bowling alleys and to taxis and subways and restaurants while he was sick he's
[14:20.320 --> 14:27.920]  a liar see we're getting from doctors police nurses local news stuff that
[14:27.920 --> 14:32.160]  looks like Ebola and it's being covered up and then we have the doctor come on
[14:32.160 --> 14:40.800]  by name and tell you they've been ordered to say that it is malaria when
[14:40.800 --> 14:51.640]  malaria only in very rare cases has some bleeding very rare nothing like Ebola so
[14:51.640 --> 14:57.480]  this is a serious situation ladies and gentlemen and I hope it's not spreading
[14:57.480 --> 15:03.680]  but let me explain something the border patrol gave us tips actually I want to
[15:03.680 --> 15:08.640]  be technical in January that the border been ordered completely open if they
[15:08.640 --> 15:11.440]  were staging groups of illegals and being ordered to ship them deeper in the
[15:11.440 --> 15:16.560]  country it took me a good four or five months to get up off my butt and send
[15:16.560 --> 15:22.640]  reporters down there and they went and sure enough there are the buses being
[15:22.640 --> 15:25.440]  loaded with the illegals the vouchers are being given to them by the border
[15:25.440 --> 15:29.200]  patrol and they're being deployed into the US to democratic party facilities
[15:29.200 --> 15:34.800]  private homes churches you name it schools during the summer that were
[15:34.800 --> 15:43.080]  empty it then took a month for that to break in the New York Times why do I
[15:43.080 --> 15:49.000]  mentioned that in relation to Ebola because if you can get 300 400,000
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.720]  people it's 100,000 youth but a couple hundred thousand more adults that came
[15:53.720 --> 15:58.480]  with them if you can get 300,000 people in and info wars can't report on it for
[15:58.480 --> 16:04.920]  five months and the mainstream media it took seven months this is how
[16:04.920 --> 16:08.720]  controlled press works the alternative media can't do everything we were
[16:08.720 --> 16:15.720]  completely overwhelmed I try to drink Lake Superior with a regular straw it
[16:15.720 --> 16:21.120]  just can't be done so if there is a bowl of spreading and that they don't want
[16:21.120 --> 16:24.600]  the media to report on it you're not going to find out about it unless more
[16:24.600 --> 16:29.880]  whistleblowers go public and unless we're able to document it in articles and
[16:29.880 --> 16:37.360]  then drudge report com picks it up and believe it they don't like the fact that
[16:37.360 --> 16:41.480]  we're able to sometime run their blockade and actually get the stuff out
[16:41.480 --> 16:45.440]  they're very angry at us for doing this they've demonized us like nothing I've
[16:45.440 --> 16:49.680]  ever done we have been attacked just on a daily basis for months over this Ebola
[16:49.680 --> 16:55.720]  situation first it wasn't going to come here then it wasn't airborne then they
[16:55.720 --> 17:00.360]  weren't covering it up then having Ebola patients at regular hospitals wouldn't
[17:00.360 --> 17:03.320]  spread it of course we were right about everything they were wrong about
[17:03.320 --> 17:12.680]  everything because they were lying deliberately so what we do clearly there
[17:12.680 --> 17:17.080]  is Ebola in the country and they're covering it up I hope that it's very
[17:17.080 --> 17:22.040]  low level but why would they be leaving the borders wide open then if they're
[17:22.040 --> 17:27.760]  trying to cover it up and suppress at the same time so something doesn't add up
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.280]  here we'll open the phones up on this subject election 2014 how big is this
[17:32.280 --> 17:39.280]  major realignment toll-free number to join us wide open phones 800-259-9231
[17:39.280 --> 17:45.400]  800-259-9231 all I ask is that you be on topic we love your calls we appreciate
[17:45.400 --> 17:53.920]  you calling but just please have a good telephone 800-259-9231 Paul Watson's a
[17:53.920 --> 17:59.040]  shabby guy I hired him 13 years ago when he was running propaganda matrix comms
[17:59.040 --> 18:04.960]  and a great job for us and he does a lot of research just like I do and I really
[18:04.960 --> 18:08.520]  respect his view of all the analysts we interview he's one of the smartest out
[18:08.520 --> 18:14.520]  there and most red so I want to bring him on right now from London via video
[18:14.520 --> 18:18.920]  Skype Paul what is your gut before we get into your latest article on what's
[18:18.920 --> 18:23.760]  going on for me this just verifies yet again that at press conferences this is
[18:23.760 --> 18:30.160]  rigged and that this is a Forbes writer admitting they've agreed to cover up I
[18:30.160 --> 18:33.400]  wonder if he'll get in trouble for exposing the cover up because he
[18:33.400 --> 18:38.120]  definitely put that at the end so that he didn't get in too much trouble but
[18:38.120 --> 18:42.840]  still tried to warn people clearly we're gonna try to get him on the show well I
[18:42.840 --> 18:46.600]  mean Alex what does it say about freedom of the press when you know this
[18:46.600 --> 18:50.840]  happened one week before the election a bowler in terms of a national news story
[18:50.840 --> 18:56.200]  completely dropped off the radar there were still suspected cases all over the
[18:56.200 --> 19:01.120]  country because people send them to me every single day yet nationally it
[19:01.120 --> 19:04.800]  completely dropped off the picture I mean you've got an administration that's
[19:04.800 --> 19:10.400]  the most hostile to media since Nixon and now we found out that this this order
[19:10.400 --> 19:14.920]  went out from the Obama administration to the media telling them not to report
[19:14.920 --> 19:19.960]  unsuspected Ebola cases in the United States it happens one week before an
[19:19.960 --> 19:25.120]  election and as he said it's it's buried it's the last paragraph of this Forbes
[19:25.120 --> 19:29.760]  article which came out a few days ago we were probably one of the first to
[19:29.760 --> 19:33.600]  report it this morning and it says that the Associated Press and other press
[19:33.600 --> 19:38.040]  outlets have agreed not to report unsuspected cases of Ebola.
[19:38.040 --> 19:41.480]  I want to get your take on where you see this is going we're gonna try to get this
[19:41.480 --> 19:45.680]  writer on this just confirms triple confirms what we already knew so your
[19:45.680 --> 19:50.040]  headlines should probably be Obama administration caught ordering media not
[19:50.040 --> 19:54.480]  to report on Ebola I mean that's really I mean we knew that was going on they've
[19:54.480 --> 19:58.200]  told the police the firefighters everybody to cover up but but now this
[19:58.200 --> 20:02.720]  just triple confirms it. Do you lay awake at night and worry about the health

[24:10.200 --> 24:14.400]  I got some good news for you I was downtown this morning taking care of
[24:14.400 --> 24:18.080]  business and I ran into two different groups of police officers two different
[24:18.080 --> 24:23.880]  times and both groups of police officers ran over and shook my hand and said
[24:23.880 --> 24:27.800]  appreciate the work you're doing one group was two Hispanic officers the
[24:27.800 --> 24:31.800]  other group was a black and white officer and it just cannot believe how
[24:31.800 --> 24:39.960]  awake the police are it's amazing and even though you could say that the
[24:39.960 --> 24:42.400]  Austin Police Department was doing their job when they caught somebody here
[24:42.400 --> 24:48.720]  plotting to kill me who then ran back to California and killed a cop I still do
[24:48.720 --> 24:52.880]  owe him because he was there waiting to kill me and they caught him but couldn't
[24:52.880 --> 24:56.960]  prosecute him and I couldn't be told about it was all over it's just it's
[24:56.960 --> 25:03.800]  just really weird that that even once am I just doing their job then you're
[25:03.800 --> 25:11.640]  indebted and then that turns into the whole subject of how do we remove this
[25:11.640 --> 25:15.240]  big criminal globalist group it's in control of our federal government and
[25:15.240 --> 25:18.280]  try to get this country back on track because we've got so many good people
[25:18.280 --> 25:24.360]  inside the military the police the firefighters the the nurses the doctors
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.360]  what you think of as the system by and large is good people but it's the
[25:28.360 --> 25:34.360]  directives that are bad it's those in control and I know we all know this so
[25:34.360 --> 25:38.760]  why can't we fix it that's what I'm trying to get at the American people by
[25:38.760 --> 25:44.040]  larger good people unless you're talking about young spoiled college students and
[25:44.040 --> 25:47.960]  a lot of them are awake or they're completely dumbed down it's just not
[25:47.960 --> 25:51.800]  gonna work anymore to call people conspiracy theorist when they question
[25:51.800 --> 25:56.160]  the system it's known to be lying I didn't mean to digress there it's just
[25:56.160 --> 26:00.960]  that America is waking up and it's accelerated and the accelerated awakening
[26:00.960 --> 26:06.560]  the tip of that is in government itself so that's got to worry the
[26:06.560 --> 26:11.600]  establishment that's why we know the NSA focuses its spying on local county and
[26:11.600 --> 26:16.560]  state and federal government as well to try to keep them in line from exposing
[26:16.560 --> 26:21.600]  the larger program Paul Watson's our guests coming up Obama vows to proceed
[26:21.600 --> 26:26.800]  with executive amnesty for illegals what landslide Obama threatens vetoes and
[26:26.800 --> 26:31.200]  executive orders including immigration reform this year love how they call
[26:31.200 --> 26:35.880]  treason immigration reform just totally open it up to anybody after Americans
[26:35.880 --> 26:39.920]  reject him I give Republicans historic gains in Congress Paul this is a short
[26:39.920 --> 26:42.800]  segment you'll be with us in the next we'll go to phone calls but let's go
[26:42.800 --> 26:46.720]  ahead and I get back into Ebola for those that just joined us this is a big
[26:46.720 --> 26:51.480]  deal to have a major Forbes writer there's also a pharmacologist there and
[26:51.480 --> 26:56.840]  said oh we agreed and the AP and others agreed not to report on what appears to
[26:56.840 --> 27:03.120]  be Ebola cases that confirms what dr. Lorenzi said here three weeks ago and is
[27:03.120 --> 27:06.840]  now battling to keep his job over when we've already confirmed it with other
[27:06.840 --> 27:12.400]  doctors that won't go on record I mean is America this cowardly that people won't
[27:12.400 --> 27:15.320]  blow the whistle cops day one told us they've been ordered to cover it up
[27:15.320 --> 27:19.240]  fireman day one told us and then a doctor and then another doctor and then
[27:19.240 --> 27:23.240]  another doctor but other than that you would think people wouldn't go along
[27:23.240 --> 27:28.040]  with this Paul what type of country do we live in well you're living in a
[27:28.040 --> 27:32.800]  country with state-controlled media I mean look what Anita Dunn said the former
[27:32.800 --> 27:37.240]  White House communications director very rarely did we communicate through the
[27:37.240 --> 27:42.040]  press anything that we didn't absolutely control she told Dominican officials so
[27:42.040 --> 27:46.520]  they openly admit that they control the press there's a headline last year
[27:46.520 --> 27:51.520]  White House photographers mutiny over Obama's Soviet style controls they
[27:51.520 --> 27:56.080]  weren't even allowed to take photos of Obama at these White House events
[27:56.080 --> 28:00.800]  everything had to be authorized and done in-house they complained that it was a
[28:00.800 --> 28:05.160]  Soviet style control over the media and then you've got these White House pool
[28:05.160 --> 28:10.120]  reports which the White House can edit and exercises its power to do so on a
[28:10.120 --> 28:14.120]  regular basis before they're sent out to news outlets federal agencies and
[28:14.120 --> 28:18.160]  congressional officers so they've got such tight control over the media now
[28:18.160 --> 28:22.840]  that the associate press and others just just acquiesced immediately and said
[28:22.840 --> 28:27.480]  yes we'll do whatever you say regarding a bold it's worse than that a CNN others
[28:27.480 --> 28:31.320]  have been caught AP as well they'll edit his speeches to make them sound better
[28:31.320 --> 28:35.360]  when he messes up on a teleprompter without the White House even telling
[28:35.360 --> 28:41.840]  them oh yeah White House court doctrine transcript of Obama's speech they take
[28:41.840 --> 28:45.720]  out things which are embarrassing they take out errors when it's supposed to
[28:45.720 --> 28:50.520]  be a verbatim transcript every time again brazenly lying to the American
[28:50.520 --> 28:54.960]  people and so you know we had a poll back in October the middle of October half
[28:54.960 --> 28:58.480]  of Americans don't believe the federal government is telling the truth about
[28:58.480 --> 29:03.000]  Ebola and with very good reason because behind the scenes as you mentioned
[29:03.000 --> 29:07.920]  earlier we're getting contacted by UPS managers saying that they're sending a
[29:07.920 --> 29:13.440]  quarter of a million hazmat suits to Dallas to Dallas alone so now you've
[29:13.440 --> 29:17.560]  got this flu season coming up you've got top experts like the former FDA
[29:17.560 --> 29:21.680]  official who also wrote in Forbes that there are going to be a spate of cases
[29:21.680 --> 29:25.240]  in major American cities you've got other scientists saying they're going to be
[29:25.240 --> 29:30.200]  over 130 cases of Ebola in American cities and then you've got the flu
[29:30.200 --> 29:34.800]  season where people are going to be reporting Ebola like symptoms and
[29:34.800 --> 29:38.800]  that's going to get confused let's talk about the hysteria that's going to come
[29:38.800 --> 29:42.920]  especially when government lied about this up front that will create total
[29:42.920 --> 29:47.320]  distrust and that's 130 cases on the low-end computer models some models
[29:47.320 --> 29:52.200]  show thousands of cases stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the
[29:52.200 --> 29:58.280]  run you imagine the hysteria Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[35:04.760 --> 35:08.040]  I think you're gonna kill somebody you better do it yourself so I'm trying to
[35:08.040 --> 35:14.160]  hire people to do it I read that in a book somewhere why on earth would you
[35:14.160 --> 35:17.640]  run around as a celebrity try to hire people to kill folks for you nine times
[35:17.640 --> 35:21.320]  out of ten it's an informant it's made up such why would you want to kill
[35:21.320 --> 35:25.640]  somebody because these rich people the these high-profile stars and folks
[35:25.640 --> 35:29.560]  constantly you're trying to get people killed and do get people killed routinely
[35:29.560 --> 35:32.960]  because they're on such power trips they think they're invincible they're neat
[35:32.960 --> 35:39.040]  they need to follow OJ's example yeah OJ did the job himself dirt cheap dirt
[35:39.040 --> 35:49.400]  cheap and then they ran on race to cover it up and that didn't work still I was
[35:49.400 --> 35:54.780]  told by a LAPD detective that it was really somebody else in the family but
[35:54.780 --> 36:05.480]  that OJ took the fall to cover it up people do anything for their kids okay
[36:05.480 --> 36:10.920]  let's just stop right there low-profile New York City prosecutor we're going back
[36:10.920 --> 36:15.920]  to Watson low-profile New York City prosecutor emerges as contender to be
[36:15.920 --> 36:22.440]  first black woman U.S. Attorney General well I don't care if she's a black woman
[36:22.440 --> 36:25.200]  but what I do care about is that she comes from a very corrupt area of New
[36:25.200 --> 36:29.480]  York where U.S. attorneys have been caught doing all sorts of political
[36:29.480 --> 36:34.280]  persecution of Republicans libertarians Christians churches in fact I've seen
[36:34.280 --> 36:39.120]  this lady's name before going after tea parties so the big news here this is from
[36:39.120 --> 36:43.880]  Fox News and that she's being looked at if our writers want to dig into her I
[36:43.880 --> 36:51.960]  remember her office being mentioned in some of the tea party pro-lifer
[36:51.960 --> 36:58.840]  harassment of 501c3s and things and it's right next door to the one that went
[36:58.840 --> 37:03.160]  after Dinesh DeSousa and I think her office aided in that I'm going from
[37:03.160 --> 37:09.680]  memory but look into it look into it she's a she's a attack dog from what I
[37:09.680 --> 37:16.800]  know so let's research that she's an under the radar contender to become the
[37:16.800 --> 37:21.320]  first black woman to have the Justice Department Loretta Lynch rarely holds a
[37:21.320 --> 37:26.040]  news conference does interviews or give speeches in her current job as U.S.
[37:26.040 --> 37:31.320]  attorney in Brooklyn oh thank you as attorneys in Brooklyn might be a little
[37:31.320 --> 37:35.880]  dirty under the fingernails I don't know think think Al Capone might have been
[37:35.880 --> 37:40.960]  a gangster I don't know but the lack of a paper trail on what Lynch hasn't kept
[37:40.960 --> 37:44.280]  her from emerging in recent weeks that's why they want her perfect puppet
[37:44.280 --> 37:48.720]  as one of only a handful of people still under consideration by White House to
[37:48.720 --> 37:52.880]  replace the outgoing Eric Holder I don't know what Fox is talking about there's
[37:52.880 --> 37:59.640]  no paper trail in this lady I remember that district office going after people
[38:00.560 --> 38:05.240]  all right we're gonna dig into her give you more on that you know Paul it's
[38:05.240 --> 38:09.880]  really scary not just that our own government you mentioned other forms
[38:09.880 --> 38:12.800]  articles and AP articles saying they expect over a hundred of all the cases
[38:12.800 --> 38:16.400]  Obama's get people ready saying oh I expect to see some more but it's no big
[38:16.400 --> 38:20.960]  deal we get demonized saying that clearly they're covering it up that is so
[38:20.960 --> 38:26.600]  newsworthy Paul that they're disappearing people notice the hospital
[38:26.600 --> 38:30.920]  didn't challenge the medical doctor we had on they didn't say he was a liar we
[38:30.920 --> 38:37.040]  were wrong they just they just demonized info wars and said that we're horrible
[38:37.040 --> 38:40.920]  people but but didn't counter any of the information and they had White House
[38:40.920 --> 38:45.760]  connected grips like media matters attack us will we lose credibility when
[38:45.760 --> 38:50.080]  more of all the cases show up or will they lose credibility Paul well I mean
[38:50.080 --> 38:52.880]  this is the thing isn't it Alex we talked to Zach Taylor the board of
[38:52.880 --> 38:56.200]  patrol veteran who said they were disappearing people and that's the point
[38:56.200 --> 39:01.080]  that Scott Gottlieb made in his editorial for Forbes about a week ago he
[39:01.080 --> 39:05.560]  said that once it hits Latin America then you know all bets are off basically
[39:05.560 --> 39:10.360]  quote as we have seen with the anxiety engendered by just a few isolated cases
[39:10.360 --> 39:13.840]  if we were to have a dozen or more cases in a major USC it would have a
[39:13.840 --> 39:18.080]  substantial impact on our economic and social life and he's talking about the
[39:18.080 --> 39:22.600]  immigrants coming in from Latin America with Ebola which is interesting
[39:22.600 --> 39:27.320]  because there's a story up on Drudge right now amazing story a beach in
[39:27.320 --> 39:33.400]  Gran Canaria basically this boatload of people from Sierra Leone with Ebola
[39:33.400 --> 39:38.400]  symptoms just arrived on the beach they dumped them out of the boat and they
[39:38.400 --> 39:44.680]  were sat around on the beach as these nudist beachgoers fled and then the
[39:44.680 --> 39:49.160]  government left them there for seven hours not knowing what to do so you've
[39:49.160 --> 39:53.840]  got immigrants just turning up on beaches in Gran Canaria with Ebola symptoms
[39:53.840 --> 39:58.560]  from Sierra Leone and as the former FDA official said in Forbes that could just
[39:58.560 --> 40:03.920]  as easily happen coming into America from Mexico well that's what the head of
[40:03.920 --> 40:08.240]  Southcom said months after we've said it and then we were attacked and so was
[40:08.240 --> 40:12.040]  the head of Southcom for saying the obvious that's another thing the
[40:12.040 --> 40:16.520]  government can't coordinate its bull you've got this czar who orders the
[40:16.520 --> 40:23.560]  media to shut up they go along with it but the police and the and Northcom and
[40:23.560 --> 40:27.720]  other groups are not going along with the cover-up I mean I don't care what
[40:27.720 --> 40:31.320]  city it is Dallas New York City the police aren't going along with the
[40:31.320 --> 40:35.440]  cover-up Northcoms are not going along with it the head of Southcom is not
[40:35.440 --> 40:41.600]  going along with it what does that mean it shows Obama is not is not in
[40:41.600 --> 40:46.040]  control which is actually a good thing yeah and remember they also told the 9
[40:46.040 --> 40:51.160]  11 dispatches in New York not to mention cases of Ebola but what worries me you
[40:51.160 --> 40:55.040]  mentioned Ron Klein before who of course said there were too many people in
[40:55.040 --> 40:59.960]  Africa he's an advocate of population reduction is the fact that this story
[40:59.960 --> 41:04.960]  which I put out probably about 10 days ago now NGO envisages global one-child
[41:04.960 --> 41:10.360]  policy pandemics to solve over population and this paper which I read in
[41:10.360 --> 41:16.440]  full was edited by Paul Ehrlich who of course is a close ally scientific ally
[41:16.440 --> 41:21.560]  of John P. Holdren the White House science are he co-authored eco science
[41:21.560 --> 41:27.120]  with Holdren which of course advocated a planetary regime to enforce draconian
[41:27.120 --> 41:32.040]  methods of population reduction and if you read this paper it's absolutely
[41:32.040 --> 41:37.080]  shocking because they basically make the point that a new global war a new type
[41:37.080 --> 41:43.960]  of Spanish flu and a new pandemic which kills six billion people over the next
[41:43.960 --> 41:49.200]  three decades or so is not going to be enough they lament the fact that six
[41:49.200 --> 41:54.200]  billion dead people when the population gets to about nine billion by 2050 is
[41:54.200 --> 42:00.560]  not going to be enough for what they want so they advocate openly a global
[42:00.560 --> 42:05.800]  one-child policy as is instituted in China which of course that's okay Paul
[42:05.800 --> 42:09.240]  because these people are just all that's okay these people are just cooks
[42:09.240 --> 42:13.000]  they're not White House science ours they don't sit on the National Academy of
[42:13.000 --> 42:17.280]  Sciences they don't sit on the major boards of the Fortune 100 they're not
[42:17.280 --> 42:22.040]  running global policy oh wait a minute they are running global policy from
[42:22.040 --> 42:26.840]  geoengineering to immigration to the Ebola response and as you said this
[42:26.840 --> 42:32.440]  isn't eco science written 40 years ago by John P. Holdren and Paul are Ehrlich
[42:32.440 --> 42:37.360]  saying this this was written this year they are saying the same thing but saying
[42:37.360 --> 42:42.280]  a global war is needed and now mainstream news is saying a new Cold War is
[42:42.280 --> 42:47.560]  beginning with Russia yeah but that's the thing Alex they a new global war and
[42:47.560 --> 42:52.080]  a pandemic which kills six billion that's not enough six billions not enough
[42:52.080 --> 42:56.080]  dead people because it will only get the population down to about five billion
[42:56.080 --> 43:00.600]  the global one-child policy if it's properly in force which you know in
[43:00.600 --> 43:05.000]  China means kidnapping women off the streets force drugging them beating
[43:05.000 --> 43:08.400]  them half to death giving them an abortion a forced abortion then
[43:08.400 --> 43:12.280]  sterilizing them that's that's what they want for everyone sure that will get
[43:12.280 --> 43:17.080]  the population down to about three billion so four billion down on what it
[43:17.080 --> 43:21.520]  is now that's that even that's not enough if you read the actual paper they
[43:21.520 --> 43:25.480]  want it they want it down to one to two billion those are the
[43:25.480 --> 43:28.920]  ideal figures for global by the way we have a lot of TV viewers and radio
[43:28.920 --> 43:32.160]  listeners out there because again of your new radio listener we also simulcasts
[43:32.160 --> 43:36.480]  at info wars.com forward slash show prisonplanet.com forward slash show we'll
[43:36.480 --> 43:40.320]  put your article from a few weeks ago up on screen and then we'll click through
[43:40.320 --> 43:46.200]  to the actual public document put out by the former White House science are who
[43:46.200 --> 43:50.920]  works with the current White House science are John P. Holdren Paul R.
[43:50.920 --> 43:55.360]  Ehrlich give folks for radio audience out there the headline on your story so they
[43:55.360 --> 43:59.600]  can go read it for themselves. The headline is NGO envisages global one
[43:59.600 --> 44:03.920]  child policy pandemics to solve overpopulation and that's the National
[44:03.920 --> 44:09.360]  Academy of Sciences they publish the paper they they put it behind a paywall
[44:09.360 --> 44:13.080]  so like you have to pay ten dollars just to read it because they know that the
[44:13.080 --> 44:17.760]  vast majority of people are not going to do I read it and it says that the
[44:17.760 --> 44:23.080]  quote sustainable number of people for the world is one to two billion people so
[44:23.080 --> 44:27.920]  that's that's you know at least six billion down on current figures and by
[44:27.920 --> 44:32.320]  the time we get to nine billion in 2050 you know it's seven billion people dead
[44:32.320 --> 44:37.000]  but not as a result of pandemics because they actually modeled it and they
[44:37.000 --> 44:42.040]  they do a nice cute little graphic with a skull and crossbones with six billion
[44:42.040 --> 44:46.920]  dead people mapped out on a chart and it shows that it only gets population down
[44:46.920 --> 44:50.760]  to about five billion which is not enough for them so they need a global one
[44:50.760 --> 44:55.360]  child policy which they openly advocate and say yeah it's going to be quote
[44:55.360 --> 44:59.520]  politically sensitive it might have to be draconian and that's what they
[44:59.520 --> 45:04.040]  advocate to get population down to three point four five billion by the end of
[45:04.040 --> 45:09.600]  this century or actually by 2045 story you didn't get enough attention I want
[45:09.600 --> 45:14.000]  you to repost that as a tile on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com and
[45:14.000 --> 45:19.400]  tweet that out on my tweet on my Twitter and your Twitter or my Twitter as a
[45:19.400 --> 45:25.320]  former governor of Texas Rick Perry would call it send that out because this is
[45:25.320 --> 45:28.960]  important people need to see this directly from the leaders of our
[45:28.960 --> 45:32.560]  scientific community how they're going to kill 90 plus percent of us and how
[45:32.560 --> 45:35.960]  they're gonna start world wars and pandemics to do it and then we go gee
[45:35.960 --> 45:40.640]  they've got bio weapons labs in Africa and gee they admit they created airborne
[45:40.640 --> 45:46.040]  Ebola to kill black people gee could this be that oh how dare you conspiracy
[45:46.040 --> 45:50.760]  theorist Alex Jones crazy man it just doesn't work anymore people understand
[45:50.760 --> 45:54.920]  what's going on Paul Joseph Watson what else are you working on right now for
[45:54.920 --> 46:00.080]  info wars.com I'm thinking that probably should actually make a video about this
[46:00.080 --> 46:04.400]  academic paper because I was gonna do so at the time then I got no attention when
[46:04.400 --> 46:08.160]  I put the article out so I just dropped it but I mean the fact about it is that
[46:08.160 --> 46:12.440]  again Ehrlich has been proven wildly inaccurate time and time again yeah he's
[46:12.440 --> 46:17.080]  still cited as the supreme authority if you actually look at the population
[46:17.080 --> 46:21.880]  demographics even in places like Brazil and India they're starting to
[46:21.880 --> 46:25.280]  gradually fall of course in many European countries like Russia the
[46:25.280 --> 46:29.280]  government so literally begging people to have children giving them financial
[46:29.280 --> 46:34.120]  incentives and actually after 2050 the major problem is going to be under
[46:34.120 --> 46:38.600]  population on all the sober evidence points to that well Paul people like
[46:38.600 --> 46:42.920]  Ehrlich who control Holdren in the White House saying that no it's gonna get
[46:42.920 --> 46:46.000]  completely out of control despite the fact that he's been proven wrong time
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.520]  and time again and they're saying we need a global one-child policy and it's
[46:49.520 --> 46:53.080]  most people are never gonna see this because you have to pay $10 and it's a
[46:53.080 --> 46:57.200]  dry academic you know 16 page paper they're not gonna read it. Well it's a
[46:57.200 --> 47:00.760]  regurgitation of what they said thousands of times and the word is getting
[47:00.760 --> 47:03.840]  out on it Paul that's why people weren't that interested in your paper because
[47:03.840 --> 47:06.400]  it's like oh the elite want to kill everybody and have a global government to
[47:06.400 --> 47:10.120]  do it oh I already know that let's move on yeah we need to get the word out on
[47:10.120 --> 47:14.760]  this folks and warn people because that's what the fluoride and the GMO and all
[47:14.760 --> 47:18.800]  of it is about they're doing it to everybody they just soft kill
[47:18.800 --> 47:23.760]  Westerners because they want you to waddle off and die 20 years later but in
[47:23.760 --> 47:27.200]  Africa in places they hit them and hit them hard and some of you are like well
[47:27.200 --> 47:31.640]  there are too many people you can't morally get away from that that it will
[47:31.640 --> 47:36.880]  come back on you as well it's just it is total evil it's all about control if
[47:36.880 --> 47:40.680]  they just industrialize these countries they'll stop having as many kids that
[47:40.680 --> 47:44.360]  all the numbers all the graphs all the actuaries show it Paul Watson thank you
[47:44.360 --> 47:50.200]  so much thanks Alex and speaking of Ebola we do have one of the global experts
[47:50.200 --> 47:55.600]  on bio weapons Steven Hatfield Dr. Steven Hatfield you know that name they
[47:55.600 --> 47:59.320]  tried to pin the anthrax attacks on him and then three other people but they
[47:59.320 --> 48:04.120]  finally killed the fifth Patsy so so he couldn't talk but they weren't able to
[48:04.120 --> 48:07.360]  get Hatfield he's gonna be coming on to talk Ebola with us I want to go to your
[48:07.360 --> 48:12.880]  phone calls the next two segments Wayne Robb red diamond Woody and Joe and
[48:12.880 --> 48:17.920]  others so be ready I'm gonna go right to you after the break your take on the
[48:17.920 --> 48:21.560]  election your take on Ebola your take on Forbes saying they went to the press
[48:21.560 --> 48:25.200]  conference and they admitted that there's a cover-up of what appeared to be
[48:25.200 --> 48:30.200]  Ebola cases to shut up about it and then let the people be disappeared what's
[48:30.200 --> 48:33.040]  next start arresting reporters and disappearing us and you'll just go
[48:33.040 --> 48:39.000]  along with that what's wrong with you people do your job this is not North
[48:39.000 --> 48:47.240]  Korea it will be soon if this continues what is your problem admit
[48:47.240 --> 48:52.160]  Ebola cases let people know then they'll have confidence when you cover up it
[48:52.160 --> 49:00.760]  causes lack of confidence but it's a culture of lying about everything
[49:01.320 --> 49:06.160]  before we go any further ladies and gentlemen I personally am getting my

[55:00.160 --> 55:04.160]  screwed I don't totally disagree with that but if we hold the Republicans
[55:04.160 --> 55:09.960]  feet to the fire now and there's no honeymoon period and slam all these new
[55:09.960 --> 55:15.900]  people that came into office and say you repeal Obamacare you repeal gun

[55:20.320 --> 55:25.320]  change things let's go ahead and talk to Wayne in Texas thanks for calling you're
[55:25.320 --> 55:32.560]  on the air good morning Alex good to speak with you I've got a little idea
[55:32.560 --> 55:38.480]  here you know they put this thing on its head well why can't we do the same
[55:38.480 --> 55:45.200]  thing you know a simple example would be let's have us a million mass march and
[55:45.200 --> 55:49.760]  instead of the police surrounding us as we marched down the street how about we
[55:49.760 --> 55:55.760]  surround the police and show our support for them that we will stand behind them
[55:55.760 --> 56:00.120]  you know let's get out of our paradigm box of following the rules that they're
[56:00.120 --> 56:03.280]  setting I agree they always want everybody fighting with each other instead
[56:03.280 --> 56:07.200]  of just agreeing on the Bill of Rights and Constitution yeah let's play and
[56:07.200 --> 56:11.500]  storm this thing out you know what can we do different that doesn't fit their
[56:11.500 --> 56:16.840]  paradigm to show them that we are on the march
[56:17.280 --> 56:22.800]  well Robert David Steele talks about trigger events and so does folks like
[56:22.800 --> 56:26.960]  Steve Pachennick well ought to get Pachennick and Steele on together talk
[56:26.960 --> 56:30.960]  about trigger events but instead of having a bad trigger event what's a good
[56:30.960 --> 56:35.000]  trigger event to bring America together to rediscover liberty great points
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.560]  we'll try to brainstorm that one day and have open phones on the subject of
[56:38.560 --> 56:43.400]  what are stunts we can pull to try to jumpstart America's heart I think that's
[56:43.400 --> 56:49.280]  already starting to happen red diamond in Texas you're on the air go ahead hey
[56:49.280 --> 56:54.920]  Alex talk about the Ebola for a minute now we got the borders wide open and the
[56:54.920 --> 56:58.880]  government's response by not shutting down the international flights and stuff
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.480]  it all they're trying to do in my opinion is just wait for something to
[57:03.480 --> 57:08.560]  happen so people will stay in their homes and then it's going to have an
[57:08.560 --> 57:13.240]  economic impact on the region where the outbreaks occur and I think that's what
[57:13.240 --> 57:15.440]  they want and then they're going to come back for the guns when they know
[57:15.440 --> 57:19.440]  everybody's at their houses is there any truth to that we've got to look at
[57:19.440 --> 57:22.880]  every option every outcome and that's one of the big ones so there's
[57:22.880 --> 57:27.240]  something behind this Ebola and the defaults stand down and the defaults
[57:27.240 --> 57:30.960]  being ignored there's clearly something bigger going on there's clearly a cover
[57:30.960 --> 57:35.080]  up of Ebola cases that's even in Forbes now that they're ordered to cover it up
[57:35.080 --> 57:41.240]  and they're complying so that that is just sensation only big that they're
[57:41.240 --> 57:43.760]  covering that up I mean it's one thing like the press used to agree to not
[57:43.760 --> 57:47.280]  talk about presidents and their girlfriends why frankly that's okay
[57:47.280 --> 57:49.920]  because that's somebody's private life I don't want to know about it I'm a
[57:49.920 --> 57:55.560]  libertarian but we do need to know the president's taking bribes we do need to
[57:55.560 --> 57:59.120]  know the president spying on the press we do need to know the president ship and
[57:59.120 --> 58:02.960]  guns in the Mexico we do need to know if they're ordering the press to cover up
[58:02.960 --> 58:09.440]  Ebola cases that is that is criminal that that is a dictatorship forming right
[58:09.440 --> 58:14.080]  there and then you know I listen to your show every day and I hear about you know
[58:14.080 --> 58:18.440]  the power bills going up my power bills doubled in the last two years you know
[58:18.440 --> 58:22.760]  I'm on disability I'm a veteran and what do they do they want to send us in the
[58:22.760 --> 58:26.560]  streets or they want us in our houses what we think they're in the first four
[58:26.560 --> 58:32.040]  years they shut down according to forms again 400 plus power stations coal power
[58:32.040 --> 58:36.040]  they shut down another 300 in the last two they're about to shut a thousand
[58:36.040 --> 58:40.240]  down so it'll quadruple your prices yeah they want you in the streets on welfare
[58:40.240 --> 58:53.280]  we're back to us using unparalleled research in the development of a
[58:53.280 --> 58:58.200]  synergistic formulation based around the key concepts of super oxygenation the

[59:02.440 --> 59:06.760]  studies the new oxy powder available through info wars life was invented
[59:06.760 --> 59:10.680]  during doctor groups research on the toxification of our bodies many herbal
[59:10.680 --> 59:14.720]  colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially
[59:14.720 --> 59:19.800]  dangerous ingredients oftentimes full of synthetic fillers GMOs additives or

[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000]  last two years it's no secret the energy councils are on record there's been
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.480]  roughly about a 75% increase in electrical generated power in the last
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:52.680]  six years mainly because of 400 500 700 power plants have been shut down
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:58.520]  they're set to shut down another thousand under EPA regulations because
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:03.000]  they've listed water vapor and carbon dioxide is poison nothing else comes
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.480]  out of the stacks now they're totally clean and so didn't matter whether you
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.440]  get them from hydroelectric or solar or ever there's less power generation so
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:16.280]  the prices go up all right let's go to woody in washington you're on the air
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:23.160]  go ahead hi alex i just wanted to say if you remember the movie blazing saddles
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:28.400]  the character that played the attorney general harvey korman i think him and
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.760]  holder look a lot alike you know i have never seen blazing saddles except for a
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:39.280]  few clips of it doesn't have the comedian in it yeah well it had a host of
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:43.080]  comedians and now harvey korman played a great attorney general that was just a
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:53.240]  real scoundrel is that the one with billy crystal no no no no oh he didn't knock
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.800]  off or something on a western blazing saddles yeah blazing sales anyway from
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:04.520]  a historical perspective i'm reading a lot of jefferson's biography recently
[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.360]  by john michael and you know our forefathers they never lost sight of
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.280]  who they were dealing with ever and that's where we've gotten off the track
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:16.680]  we we as a country we've lost sight that who the real scoundrels and billins are
[01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:21.320]  and we went to sleep and now we're waking up and we're in this nightmare and all
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.680]  we got to do is go to history look what they did to the american indians they
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:30.880]  gave them blankets with smallpox and you know and here's a history piece in
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.400]  new york city there was a typhus outbreak during the civil war that was
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.440]  suspected that the confederacy confederacy yeah the confederates did so
[01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:42.160]  there's a lot of history just look at the history you'll see what's coming our
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:48.080]  way well you made a great point woody about the whole situation with
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:52.120]  biologicals being used as weapons but also about the founders i've read the
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:57.200]  the letters and works written by jefferson and by washington they were
[01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:01.320]  mad about rigged economies and ultra rich they wouldn't let other people
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.480]  compete in the market the whole renaissance in europe was about trying
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:10.920]  to stop that and that's what we're under now is crony capitalism versus true
[01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:17.520]  freedom and if we ever just get basic true freedom we'll all be so rich our
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:21.760]  problem will be our kids being spoiled rats and that's what's happened we got
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:27.040]  so rich off freedom that we now are a bunch of spoiled rats we are the spoil
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:32.680]  rats and where our kids are even bigger spoiled rats collectively we've got to
[01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:36.640]  change that but historically first the bottom has to fall out thank you for the

[01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:18.120]  what landslide Obama threatens vetoes and executive orders including
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:22.840]  immigration reform this year which just means legalizing all the illegals he's
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:26.200]  already incentivized to come into the country and get free welfare really an
[01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:33.320]  amazing act of tyranny we're seeing also in the election CNN exit polls shows
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:40.080]  republicans one big among full-time workers and college attendees showing
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:43.600]  the youth are becoming more libertarian and again it was a libertarian movement
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:49.520]  cns news is reporting that breathe life into the dying dinosaur republican
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:54.160]  carcass so it's not an endorsement of the republican establishment this major
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:59.160]  political realignment it's America waking up the collectivism an insider
[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:06.880]  politics and identity politics and race politics is a fraud and that's exactly
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:11.320]  what the new black senator Scott is saying stop the race baiting and for that
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:18.280]  he gets an f-grade from the NAACP pretty amazing to see all of that
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:25.480]  unfolding now we've got a very special guest on Steven Hatfield for the balance
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.040]  of the hour towards the end of the hour we will take some calls from Joe and
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:34.960]  others that are calling in on Ebola specifically I don't say Ebola on purpose
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:41.040]  it's a Freudian slip Ebola Steven Hatfield is an American physician
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.560]  virologist and bio weapons expert one of the top in the world who underwent what
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.320]  was considered by many a trial by the media and with great toll in his
[01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:52.720]  personal professional life after eight months of pressure from the media and
[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.360]  amateur detectives the US Department of Justice identified the former government
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.440]  scientists as a person of interest in the investigation that's not why he's on
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:05.680]  the day the 2001 attacks he was later completely exonerated and Hatfield
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:12.120]  that later sued and won 5.8 million from the federal government they also tried
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:16.320]  to burn a bunch of other patsies was bizarre and of course we really know
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.160]  what happened with that it wasn't somebody rogue ladies and gentlemen we're
[01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.520]  not going to cover that much today as of 2014 Steven Hatfield is consulting to
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.960]  African countries on Ebola containment and prevention in his detailed report on
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:33.600]  Ebola epidemic made available by the Atlantic monthly he supports the
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:37.680]  induct the introduction of stronger quarantine measures to protect the
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:42.120]  United States from infection so he's one of the global leading experts he's
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:46.120]  worked a lot in Africa as well he's advising the African countries one of
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.560]  the top advisors to their governments and so again we're very honored to have
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:54.200]  him join us and dovetail with all this Forbes is reporting and we're linked to
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:59.280]  it on info wars calm that Obama has ordered the media to cover up new
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.600]  Ebola cases or what they believe are about the cases in the country and we've
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:06.800]  interviewed on-air by name medical doctor and others border patrol that
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:11.840]  they're saying no people that we're told have Ebola are being disappeared so it
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:15.440]  appears to be a cover-up but regardless people are being disappeared so we've
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.360]  got the expert on to be able to break down every facet of this and he's an
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:24.360]  associate of doctors for disaster preparedness they have an amazing
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:34.520]  website ddp online that's ddponline.org we're gonna tweet that out we have one
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:40.280]  of the top doctors one of the top global experts on Ebola giving us the inside
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.480]  breakdown on what's happening dr. Hatfield thanks for coming on well thank
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:51.360]  you very much Alex a good day to you so much is happening where should we begin
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:57.360]  probably to look at this entire outbreak and by the way there's there there are a
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:12:02.900]  lot of people knowledgeable about Ebola this disease has been recognized since
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:09.680]  1975 and the earlier generation of infectious disease specialists that
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:15.840]  worked with us recognize that there was some non-understanding of this virus
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:20.040]  with respect to transmission or potential for transmission and they
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:26.160]  classify this as a biosafety level for threat this requires the highest level
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.560]  of biocontainment this is where you wear the spacesuits that are under
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:35.520]  positive pressure and you work inside a room that is negative pressure so nothing
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:40.000]  can get to your scanner your mucus membrane and you're quite safe under
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.920]  these type of condition because of field expedience and requirements Ebola
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.800]  Africa is being treated as a biosafety level three sure doc speak up just a
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:57.160]  little bit for us thanks yeah Ebola in Africa is being treated as a biosafety
[01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:02.920]  level three infection and we're doing the same in this country under these
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:08.760]  protocols there's still some things we don't know about the virus which is a
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:15.240]  bit concerning the cracks of the problem is is that as the human species has
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:22.040]  expanded we've enroached onto natural areas throughout the world in our
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:27.120]  ever-increasing numbers and this leads to the whole concept of emerging and
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:31.360]  infectious diseases and we're getting almost one new infection that we haven't
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:38.480]  seen before in humans almost every year now so the Ebola outbreak is just the
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.200]  tip of the problem and it's been interesting to watch how the United
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:48.160]  States responded to this because I can guarantee you there's there's worse
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:54.560]  things than Ebola out of nature that we don't have any idea about yet so it's
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:14:02.360]  very important to make sure that we have a good public health service robust and
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:08.120]  it's able to handle these these unusual types of dangerous outbreaks
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:13.520]  specifically we've seen army reports saying that in cold weather Ebola is
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:17.680]  essentially airborne can live on surfaces for weeks then we see the New
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:22.800]  York Times and CNN saying oh is it going airborne reportedly it would only be
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.800]  infectious for three or four days previously now they say it doesn't show
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:30.880]  up for 21 maybe 70 and sperm from researching Ebola as being a top
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.720]  bio weapons expert who advises Africa you say we don't know much about this
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:40.960]  virus that concerns you we read about 300 plus mutations different strains what
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.520]  can you tell us doctor Hatfield about this particular Ebola and why it appears
[01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:53.000]  to have spread you know to record numbers of people well for the last chance of
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.680]  your question directly and then expound upon it the data that I'm getting back
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.800]  to me is that this virus is replicating to a to a very high level and humans
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:11.080]  the desire strain of Ebola that's part of the present outbreak also this is an
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:17.960]  RNA virus and these are notoriously susceptible to mutation with respect to
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:23.120]  the aerosol transmission we've known for four years now that both the Ebola and
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:29.040]  its relative the Marburg virus can survive in an aerosol in the dark to
[01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:33.520]  detectable levels for at least one and a half hours that is if it's not
[01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:39.360]  indirect sunlight aerosols are generated by a variety of things coughing
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:45.800]  sneezing invasive medical procedures vomiting diarrhea flushing a toilet a
[01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:49.800]  lot of common laboratory equivalent that's used in a medical laboratory
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:58.320]  these are capable of producing in aerosol droplets in different size ranges in
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:04.200]  traditional outbreaks of Ebola in Africa airborne transmission has not been an
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:11.160]  overwhelming feature it's been person-to-person contact or contact with
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:17.640]  contaminated fluids when we're in the United States and an ambulance crew is
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:24.360]  trying to transport a patient with an unknown fever to a hospital it's very
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.160]  common to generate aerosols and vomit in this type of thing and and my
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:34.600]  concern is patients that don't realize they have this disease or EMS responders
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:41.640]  that don't realize they have this and then secondary transmission to the
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:45.440]  healthcare workers well dr. Stephen Hatfield is our guest one of the top
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:49.320]  bioweapons experts out there and he's advising African countries on what's
[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:54.360]  going on we see some UN models saying 1.4 million by January they could
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:59.840]  contract it I know you've called for your stricter controls I follow the news
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:03.800]  I'm on an expert like you but I do interview the experts doctor previously
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:07.880]  they would put people on ships or you know make them get out of the hot zone
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:11.240]  in Africa for 21 days before they brought them in they wouldn't stick Ebola
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:17.720]  patients like you said with level four inside hospitals level two or three why
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:23.280]  are they not doing the default things they did previously a b why are they
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.160]  lying to people and saying there's no threat it'll spread over here or am I
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.120]  wrong about that what do you think pulling back from this as a scientist
[01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:36.600]  just as a American citizen as a family man things don't seem right here what's
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.680]  really going on I don't know it seems politics are driving things now this
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:46.080]  epidemic in Africa is I think I don't think we're going to see these
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:53.240]  catastrophic predictions over there good we have a very good infrastructure here
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:59.040]  I mean you can't imagine the conditions in Africa in some places so the ability
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:06.840]  to control this thing here I think is very very good this is one panic
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:14.760]  about but it does portray some disturbing questions we've spent a hundred
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.400]  and twenty billion dollars on biological defense and emerging diseases over the
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:29.480]  last two decades and we can't seem to handle one case of Ebola flu is probably
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:42.160]  our really biggest worry an avian hybrid flu and for this the United States
[01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:46.760]  spent some forty seven million dollars in supplemental funding to the department
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:56.000]  of health and human services and a recent GAO investigation and it's it's
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:01.280]  essentially this money was wasted DHS spent about nine and a half million on
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:07.240]  protective equipment since 2006 six point seven for anti-borrowed drugs which by
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:15.120]  the way don't work and our stockpile of Tama flu and the other other drug is
[01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:21.040]  expired there's been no controls to monitor there was no rationality to
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:28.200]  this purchasing they bought about 5,000 bottles of hand sanitizer 84% of this
[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:34.200]  is expired so basically a giant boondoggle yeah essentially stay there
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:38.880]  dr. Stephen Hatfield is our guest MD on the top bioweapons experts out there
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.240]  when I come back I want to ask him then if he talks about an airborne avian flu
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:48.480]  that's airborne to humans that being the big threat what are the big threats
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:53.080]  mouse pox he talks about these new emerging diseases let's discuss that
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:57.000]  because what this shows us is when something really bad shows up they're
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:01.600]  just gonna leave the borders wide open and why this winter next to water and
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:06.120]  food you need a safe storable fuel supply for your preparedness needs spare

[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.440]  information I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:08.640]  over at my Patriots supply several years ago Matt was sitting in his two-bedroom
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:11.720]  apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the
[01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:15.840]  charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck deciding to take action a
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:21.040]  company run by Patriots for Patriots was born by Patriots supply has never taken
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:25.320]  a loan or accepted outside funding they now operate two distribution facilities
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:29.760]  and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women it is rare to find

[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.960]  you think's going on dr. Stephen Hatfield is our guest medical doctor one
[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:32.600]  of the top bio weapons experts out there on record and you can read big
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:36.520]  articles with his analysis in the Atlantic monthly you name it just by
[01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:42.080]  googling his name we're going to ddponline.org doctors for disaster
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.080]  preparedness and he joins us right now we'll be taking some of your calls
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:54.160]  coming up for him at 800-259-9231 800-2599-231 coming up in the next
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:58.480]  segment doctors are just short segments are getting right back into it I see
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:02.840]  them publish the design of mouse box that they say is super deadly worse than a
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:07.200]  bowl look correct me if I'm wrong or universities openly working at bio
[01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:12.520]  shield to you know create new airborne avian flu claiming they want to know how
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:18.360]  to treat it but again I'm no rocket scientist or virologist like you but
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:23.760]  it seems if you've got level four stuff going on in Galveston where it gets hit
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:30.920]  by a hurricane and things seem so flimsy now it's only a matter of time till the
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:36.600]  bio shield system ends up releasing some nightmare pathogen or do you think
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.680]  it's going to come out of the jungles of somewhere you talk about all these
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:45.720]  emerging things what is the big threat what keeps you awake at night you know
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:50.680]  mother nature yeah what these these lab I mean you've got CJ Peters down there
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:57.920]  and he is probably one of the world's experts on Ebola he was at CDC special
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:03.320]  pathogens for years you Sam read extremely extremely knowledgeable
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:09.840]  scientist and position just a wonderful guy and the stuff isn't getting out of a
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:14.800]  lab okay so you're not worried about that what are you so you're worried
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:22.320]  about the jungle I'm worried about the jungle and right now there's about five
[01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:27.760]  different things going on with emerging diseases we have this entero virus
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:36.000]  that's sickening the children in the Midwest we have monkeypox outbreaks in
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.160]  the Kasai Oriental province this has been going on for years we have any
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.960]  Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo we have the MERS
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:52.760]  virus in the mid-east this is a severe respiratory system virus semi related
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.800]  to the SARS virus that broke out in China and we have the chicken gun yeah
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:03.040]  virus outbreak and it's almost epidemic in Puerto Rico we've had I think one
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:07.640]  primary case in Florida and one secondary mosquito transmitted cases in
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:16.160]  Florida so these things are just as our species numbers increase we have more
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:22.720]  contact with disrupted fragmented environments and most of these diseases
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:29.360]  are jumping from animals into humans a number of years ago in the mid-bindings
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:36.400]  we almost lost all the lions in the Serengeti in Africa this temper type of
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:43.120]  measles virus jump from the local wild dogs into the lion population and
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:50.240]  decimated them so this is an continuing growing threat of emerging
[01:27:50.240 --> 01:27:55.360]  infectious diseases and scientists have been worried about this for 30 years so
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:02.400]  as humans move into these zoological areas and what's causing the viruses
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:06.720]  and things to jump over into other animals and humans is it just the
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:12.640]  proximity the proximity in the fact that the majority of these are RNA viruses
[01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:19.560]  RNA is a type of genetic information that a virus carries the other type is the
[01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:25.640]  DNA which a lot of people are familiar with but in an RNA virus every time the
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:32.480]  virus replicates it tends to make a mistake in its genetic copy so you have
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:39.200]  whole let's say HIV HIV a retrovirus something a bit different but you may
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:45.400]  find up to 27 different strains of HIV in one patient wow so it's mother nature's
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:54.520]  way and as these viruses mutate many become non-infections many lose their
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:29:02.240]  capability for viability some acquire perhaps new traits the arrest the
[01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:07.200]  bull arrest and virus is completely non-pathogenic for humans you can inject
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:11.840]  this into yourself and you won't even run a temperature it does nothing but
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:18.880]  it's very very aerosol transmitted now if you're a pig it makes you sick a lot
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:23.560]  of these are very species specific and then the pig transmits the rest of the
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:28.920]  boulevard to humans and again nothing happens so sometimes there's an
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:33.160]  amplifying host in the middle let me ask you a question when we come back
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:37.480]  long-term coming up is it possible when it goes through a buffer like a pig would
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:42.800]  you then get some immunity to other Ebola viruses from the rest in a variety
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:47.080]  and we'll ask is that the one that got out in the lab in 1989 we'll be back
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:54.560]  stay with us we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the

[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:54.960]  that's my mandate total arrogance the video clips of it in the statements up
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:34:03.240]  on info wars dot com right now you know since I started mentioning the rest in
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:12.320]  clip from PBS on a nova piece back in 1990 narrated by Stacy Keach let's play
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:16.040]  that clip and get one of the top bio weapons medical doctor experts out there
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:21.000]  dr. Stephen Hatfield who trained the FBI who's a major consultant to African
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.360]  governments right now in their response you know he's saying he doesn't think it
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:27.600]  will be as bad as some of the media has been saying but that there's a terrible
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:31.400]  response to it even very critical of that I want to get his take on that and
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:35.280]  take some of your phone calls but first let's play this clip since he was
[01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:40.120]  mentioning the rest in strain that they believe did go airborne here it is in
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:46.360]  1989 Ebola made its way to the US residents of this Washington DC suburb
[01:34:46.360 --> 01:34:50.760]  had no idea that one of the world's deadliest viruses had emerged in their
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:35:02.440]  midst in a primate quarantine unit in rest in Virginia monkeys in one of the
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:09.000]  holding rooms suddenly began to die secretly a military team entered the
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:24.160]  quarantine unit and killed all 60 monkeys in the infected room the crisis
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:29.560]  heightened as monkeys began to die in a different room it appeared that the
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:35.240]  virus was moving through the ventilating system in response the military
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:41.360]  killed all 400 monkeys ending the outbreak all right this new strain of
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:45.800]  Ebola had shown the potential to spread through the air let's go back to Dr.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:51.760]  Stephen Hatfield you were pointing out that this does not make humans sick I
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:58.400]  know there's a lot of strains of Ebola you have been critical of the response
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:08.960]  why has the response been lackluster I think our guard went down the people
[01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:13.840]  that handle the arrest of Ebola outbreak from you Sam read the United
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:18.840]  States Army Medical Research Institute infectious disease this was the
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:22.760]  aromethical isolation team or what became the aromethical isolation team
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:31.120]  these were highly skilled technicians wearing totally appropriate positive
[01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:38.600]  pressure ventilators and then the suits that went in and cleaned this mess up
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:46.880]  and the AIT team was built trained and put on standby to fly anywhere in the
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:53.520]  world to aromatically transport a an Ebola case or other hemorrhagic fever
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:59.720]  case back to Fort Detrick where there was a biosafety level for treatment
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:04.320]  facility so everything was handled completely in fact the isolator that
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:10.000]  would come off the helicopter would seal to the outside of the building the
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.000]  patient would be brought in for biosafety level for care
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:17.800]  physicians from Walter Reed highly experienced would come up but on the
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:23.320]  spacesuits and you know top flight intensive care in 2010 for some reason
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:30.280]  that was shut down that capability was lost and there was really nothing to
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:35.840]  replace it so you're saying that's why all the default measures weren't there
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:39.800]  is because we don't have them anymore so we had them before we spent $120
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:46.280]  billion but now we spent $120 billion we don't have it yeah essentially we have
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:51.880]  four designated biosafety level three treatment areas scattered throughout the
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:38:00.560]  country but the kind of lost capability there and it wasn't just the fact of the
[01:38:00.560 --> 01:38:07.000]  facilities you had people that were practiced and rehearsed and confident in
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:13.480]  their equipment it's hard to work in those suits and to try to put a tube
[01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:19.160]  into somebody's lungs an intubation when you're wearing a space suit it's a
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:23.880]  little bit difficult so these physicians had practiced rehearsed and there was an
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:28.600]  area of calm about the entire thing because we knew you were fully protected
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:34.560]  when you handle these type of infections under a less than biosafety level
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:40.920]  three decontamination is very very very important well that's my question they
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:44.560]  had to know that nurses and people were going to get Ebola if they're treating
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.400]  Ebola patients that are in the final stages bleeding everywhere like the guy
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:53.400]  that patient zero that died in Dallas I mean they had to know and so when Obama
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.680]  comes out and says everything's gonna be fine it doesn't create a lot of
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:01.000]  confidence I've talked to medical doctors on-air and off-air saying that when
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.640]  they see people with Ebola symptoms that there are CDC teams showing up in
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:08.560]  space suits taking them out in the middle of the night and telling them
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.000]  don't talk about it we've had them on record the media attacked us and now
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:17.240]  Forbes is reporting that they were at a CDC press conference and that they met
[01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:22.120]  with reporters AP and others they said we've all agreed to cover up new Ebola
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:26.640]  cases I agree with you and I'm no you know scientist but I don't think it's
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:31.560]  gonna spread everywhere and be super big deal but at the same time why would they
[01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.760]  then be leaving the planes open not stopping the visas like you know you've
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.720]  written and said they should why then would they be covering it up on one hand
[01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:45.360]  while letting it come in on the other well I have not heard anything about a
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:53.760]  cover-up but let's look at it this way when Mr. Duncan the the patient that
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:40:01.840]  died in Texas two nurses were secondarily exposed my understanding for
[01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:08.840]  the one nurse that flew from Texas to Cincinnati and back and 800 people had to
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:16.920]  be contact traced by epidemiologists that's one case putting a quarantine will
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:22.520]  never be totally affecting but when you build a defense for this type of thing
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:28.600]  you try to have it in layers just like a military camp you have claymore mines
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:32.280]  out on the periphery and then you have trenches and interlocking arcs of fire
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:38.720]  you have layered defenses trying to reduce the potential number of cases
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:44.720]  Canada's but in it's my understanding they put in a national quarantine there
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:52.640]  it's it's our elected leaders have chosen not to do that my worry is that
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:41:01.880]  not Ebola but other cases other other diseases if one patient on an aircraft
[01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:08.600]  took 800 contact tracings how many patients flying on aircraft infected
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:14.000]  would it take to overload our national and state's capability to perform contact
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:20.480]  tracing if it's fairly labor-intensive to find you know who this patient have
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:24.800]  come to a certain point you get overwhelmed so yeah I mean the default
[01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:29.120]  am I wrong as you stop the visas from the five countries affected a bunch of
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:33.680]  other nations have done that from England to Australia and been criticized the
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:37.320]  African countries have done the same thing people that come in that show
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:40.720]  signs you quarantine them and it's not that it's gonna a hundred percent stop
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:45.760]  of like you said it's putting up layers of defenses so it doesn't get in spread
[01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:49.840]  out of control and then you can't get it under control well even with quarantine
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:55.400]  you must expect cases to get in but it's at a manageable level for your
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:03.520]  national and state resources now we've used fever as one of the criteria and
[01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:09.800]  thermal scanners in the airports but the published literature Albrecht's in
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:15.040]  Uganda and this present outbreak New England Journal of Medicine in October
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:19.720]  16th 2014 it's probably the most up-to-date and they report that in 12
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:26.080]  percent of cases Ebola can present without fever and the absence of
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:30.160]  fever is not a reliable indication that an individual is not infected sure
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:37.000]  because Advil or Tylenol can knock it down right that's what they're saying as
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:41.440]  well I mean I mean I don't know about that in the pharmacological into
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:47.400]  reactions I know these some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents can
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:52.760]  reduce fever Tylenol can do that sure sure but I mean but to use this as a
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:43:01.080]  full mass screening when 12% of the cases may not be showing the fever so
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:09.840]  again it's part of defense but and the SARS outbreak I mean fever was a
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:15.480]  presenting sign there and Singapore and some other countries were very very
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:20.520]  quickly able to to get on top of this or it could have been really quite a
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:25.840]  public health disaster for Singapore and when they hold home quarantine
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:32.000]  somebody over there for the SARS virus they had people voting every hour the
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.720]  house and if you weren't there and you were supposed to be under house
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:43.040]  quarantine the police came by to get you and so we know how to handle these
[01:43:43.040 --> 01:43:48.040]  things we've known for a hundred years what do you make of this nurse and well
[01:43:48.040 --> 01:43:54.160]  well the doctor in New York has a fever he's at bowling alleys the A train he's
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:57.920]  at restaurants and then he lied about it reportedly to the police I mean this
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.280]  guy's a medical doctor out of a hot zone he's got a fever what is he thinking
[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:07.200]  running around well I can't comment on that I don't know the details of the
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:14.440]  case but we do know that skin shedding of the virus can occur in advanced cases
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:20.920]  you can take a skin swab off someone and using fairly non-sophisticated techniques
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:26.360]  it's got a big long word you know histochemistry but you know you can see
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:31.560]  a bolivirus in the skin the virus replicates in certain cells in the
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:36.280]  skin and you know your skin has a growing layer and it sheds and you're
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:43.520]  constantly flaking dead skin cells off and these Langehan cells the virus
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:48.360]  replicates inside them it goes outside the Langehan cells and it can get pushed
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:52.360]  to the surface Dr. Steven Hatville is our guest on the top bio weapons experts
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:56.120]  out there advising major African governments on this biggest Ebola
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:59.520]  outbreak ever and talking about the response if you just joined us on your
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:02.960]  host Alex Jones I want us to go to some phone calls now in the 10-15 minutes
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:07.720]  we've got left with Steven Hatville and of course you can visit his website
[01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:14.040]  doctors for disaster preparedness that he's part of DDP online.org for doctors
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.920]  and others the only part of the organization to get the latest up-to-date
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.480]  information go there and become a member as well has a lot of important
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:26.840]  news and information as well. Looking at this what is you know the FBI had asked
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:32.760]  major universities to not release I guess the way to weaponize mousepox and
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:37.040]  things like this you talk about monkeypox and things obviously there have
[01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:41.640]  been weaponized things in government labs around the country South Africa it
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:44.480]  came out some of their hearings was trying to weaponize things for a
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:50.120]  specific reasons I know a lot of that stuff's classified but specifically are
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:54.240]  you worried about that more you know in the Russians in the Cold War with
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:57.480]  weaponized anthrax or are you worried more about what's coming out of the
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:04.320]  jungle merging with something I mean could we see something that that that
[01:46:04.320 --> 01:46:10.800]  makes airborne Ebola look tame a 12 monkey scenario. Yeah I just want to finish
[01:46:10.800 --> 01:46:15.720]  the answer to my skin shedding yes we don't know when during infection this
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:21.000]  occurs the things that were looked at were late you know almost terminal
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:26.240]  cases but we don't have that on when when skin shedding occurs and if you're
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:32.080]  infected through skin the virus would be replicating there so I mean what I'm
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:36.480]  trying to say is there's still some uncertainties there so when we develop
[01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:42.600]  first responder guidelines we always need to err on the side of caution. I get it
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:46.000]  so we need to tell the firemen the police the medical workers as you wrote
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:52.840]  in the Atlantic that they could get it by brushing up against somebody. What I
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:47:01.200]  can say is this medicines on frontier MSL probably have the greatest number of
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:08.880]  people experienced with handling Ebola. They've been absolutely heroic in
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:14.160]  their efforts in Africa on their own guidelines their handbook for handling
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:22.240]  these patients. The degree for risk for accidental exposures in the unclear or
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:28.480]  variable section of their degrees of risk they mentioned direct contact between
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:38.800]  intact skin and an example touched by a symptomatic Ebola patient and their
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:43.760]  guidelines were immediate observation at the field or at the national capital
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:52.800]  level of these instances. So we know patients in advanced stages and this is
[01:47:52.800 --> 01:47:57.520]  part of the transmission handling the bodies, burying the bodies without
[01:47:57.520 --> 01:48:02.120]  proper protective gear and this type of thing. These are late cases but we don't
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:07.720]  have data to indicate when this viral shedding starts so we're assuming it's
[01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:14.800]  in late-stage cases. Well assuming it's not erring on the side of caution so we
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:18.560]  need further studies on that. Sure well all these Texas officials and federal
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:22.040]  officials said there's no way to get it you have to be vomited on into an open
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:26.400]  wound that's been showed not to be true and clearly it looks like this Ebola's
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:32.120]  heartier spreading more than ever before so something's going on here. I want to
[01:48:32.120 --> 01:48:36.480]  go to these callers John, Justin, Mike, Jake and others that are patiently
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:43.040]  holding but doc what about bio? I'm more worried about the jungle.
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:48.160]  You can answer your question before this. There are things out there there's a
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:54.880]  virus called the Baskongo virus. Time from death between first showing symptoms
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:59.720]  is two to three days. There's only been about three or four cases. Wow. We don't
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:04.240]  know a lot about this. There's another virus that hasn't jumped species yet it's
[01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:09.440]  still in the monkey called Simeon hemorrhagic fever and this has a hundred
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:15.360]  percent lethality in monkeys. Now it hasn't jumped to humans yet and
[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:22.480]  we're trying to watch this but nature is really not something you want to mess
[01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:29.840]  with. It requires the highest sort of thinking on this and always airing on
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:35.080]  the side of caution when you're dealing with human lives. Now what was the virus
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:39.840]  that kills a hundred percent? Well it's a monkey virus that hasn't jumped into
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:44.560]  humans that we know of yet it's called Simeon hemorrhagic fever and then what
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.400]  was the other one that's only a few people have gotten it but it kills them
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:54.760]  in a matter of days. It's called the Baskongo virus. Wow and imagine if those
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:59.440]  got out. Well we don't know how it's trying it looks like it's probably again
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:05.680]  the fruit bats but you know we're not certain yet it might be arthropod you
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:09.360]  know insect transmitter we don't know and there's still a lot of research going
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:14.360]  on on this but it serves as an example that mother nature holds a lot of
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:22.000]  surprises for us and I mean right now we live in a virtual sea of viruses we
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.360]  can't see them we can't detect them we can't smell them we can't touch them
[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:33.200]  but they're all around us. Only a few only about 1,700 infectious agents have the
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:38.680]  capacity to affect humans. But any time they could mutate and then there'll be a
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:42.800]  chain reaction and we're not ready at all see like the more money we spend the
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:48.360]  less ready we are it's bizarre. Yeah I think so. Bizarre Dr. Steven Hatfield is
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:53.280]  here with us today. Let's take some phone calls. John in North Carolina thanks
[01:50:53.280 --> 01:50:57.200]  for being patient you're on the air. Hi yeah I had a couple of questions for
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:01.880]  Steven Hatfield. Yeah you're on the air. Yeah Steven can you tell us what you were
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:09.720]  doing in North Carolina back in November of 2001? No. Well we don't screen
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:15.640]  the phone calls but I mean obviously that was a classified project. Yeah. So you
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:18.440]  were in North Carolina in 2001 can you tell us specifically what you were
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:22.200]  doing in Clayton North Carolina 2001? Well I didn't set this call up and I
[01:51:22.200 --> 01:51:27.080]  don't mind the call. No I don't either I don't remember being in Clayton North
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:32.480]  Carolina. Where I saw you you walked down my street you were wearing your Army
[01:51:32.480 --> 01:51:41.480]  jacket which had your last name on it. No that's you're thinking of somebody. I got another question for you. Back in those days you
[01:51:41.480 --> 01:51:45.080]  admitted that you had killed a terrorist and kept his shoes as a souvenir can you
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:50.120]  tell us who that was? Is this an FBI agent calling in or something? No this is
[01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:55.640]  Steven Hatfield's victim. Okay listen listen here's the deal the FBI went
[01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:59.080]  after like four or five people he's won a lawsuit he wasn't involved in the
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:03.880]  anthrax attacks folks I studied them we have a prime suspect that was never
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:09.800]  gone after who was checked into the area where it was at and we don't screen
[01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:13.720]  phone calls I'm trying to get in a fight with the caller. No that's okay I was in
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:20.200]  the Rhodesian Army I don't know the terrorist's name it was in Mozambique
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:25.800]  the man was carrying a weapon and he was coming across the border to brutalize
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:31.800]  innocent tribes people. You've done a lot of interesting things we ought to get you
[01:52:31.800 --> 01:52:36.240]  on some time just about your life years ago I did have you on separately about
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:40.400]  the whole anthrax deal you probably don't even remember that but you don't do a
[01:52:40.400 --> 01:52:43.680]  ton of interviews these days but you are doing more I guess to respond to what's
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:48.320]  happening with Ebola I wasn't even gonna go there with the anthrax case but they
[01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:53.320]  later admitted that you just had zero connection and it was quackery and I
[01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:58.080]  only want to name names here but it just literally just got you got fingered
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:01.640]  because you were one of the people advising the government on anthrax and
[01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:05.360]  and so you were just a name they picked out of a hat. Well actually I wasn't
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:10.160]  advising the government on anthrax we were training them. We were helping to
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:14.400]  teach the domestic preparedness program. Well that's what I meant like how to
[01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:19.080]  counter things like that. Well for the hospitals in the 120 largest cities how
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:25.640]  to handle some sort of an outbreak but anthrax was just one of the agents. There
[01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:36.600]  was Tuvaremia plague and the plague organism virus called VEE and some others but this
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:43.280]  was this was just a national program that the Nunn-Lugar Domenici amendment
[01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:46.920]  had brought in. Well that was a bizarre call I mean I would have kept him on but
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:50.040]  when people start you know saying I'm a victim I don't know how I could prove
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:54.200]  that. If that person wants to send me proof or information I'd like to see it
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:57.360]  maybe Mr. Hatfield come back on and debate you but we got him on today about
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:54:01.000]  Ebola. I would have told him up front he was coming on about anthrax but people
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.120]  people sure want to know about that. Have you ever thought about writing a book
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:09.240]  about the whole anthrax debacle? Oh yeah I wrote one. I mean I know you wrote one
[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:14.120]  but have you thought about writing one about now since it all you know came out?
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:19.160]  I wrote one during the time. In fact I think I read that but what was the name
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:23.000]  of it? No I haven't published it. It must have been a book about the anthrax
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:26.280]  detection you know 14 years ago it's about you forget a lot of stuff. You might
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:30.800]  admit look I'm used to this so this isn't a problem this happens all the time
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:38.360]  still. Once you're named a person of interest that never goes away it
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:44.840]  continues. Well look until the day you die. If something happens in Austin now a
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:51.920]  city of two million people yeah the folks online say I must be involved. I mean it
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:56.520]  just goes on and on. Let's talk to Justin in Texas. Justin you're on the
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:04.760]  ear. Yes. Hey Alex. Welcome. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Shout out and
[01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:08.640]  props to all the guys on your staff. Everybody's doing an excellent job. Thank
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:13.640]  you brother. And we miss you here in Corpus Christi. It's been a while. So I
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:20.480]  just like to touch base on something I'm in my 30s and I can tell that there's a
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:24.800]  lot of people in the same age bracket that have concerns and like what they're
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:28.480]  able to do and what they can't do and what they can get away with and the
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:35.440]  legalities of this and right now I read an article recently about Operation
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:41.720]  American Freedom. It might be a spinoff of the Operation American Spring if you
[01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:44.640]  remember that. Sure that's specifically on how to get politically active. Do you
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:49.360]  have a question for our guest. Well not so much for the guest but I'm just
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:53.400]  curious of what we can do. There's a lot. I'm going to put you on hold and come
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:57.080]  back to you because we're talking about Ebola right now. Let's go ahead and talk
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:02.640]  to Mike in Wyoming. Mike you're on the air. So Mr. Hatfield you would have us
[01:56:02.640 --> 01:56:06.480]  believe that it's just serendipity that these Ebola outbreaks are occurring in
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:13.080]  areas that are rich in oil, gas, gold, diamonds, that the virus is just jumping
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:18.720]  species and how are we to reconcile your comments with those of Dr. Francis Boyle
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:25.960]  about a week ago where he said that my album out of UTMB Galveston, Tulane, CDC
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:32.000]  are all working at weaponizing Ebola. The Soviets tried for years to
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:36.560]  weaponize Ebola and they couldn't stabilize it. What they did do was they
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:40.480]  managed to weaponize one of its relatives called the Marburg virus which
[01:56:40.480 --> 01:56:45.640]  they make quite a bit of. In response to why are these outbreaks occurring in
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:52.200]  environmentally rich and mineral rich areas, these areas happen to be in areas
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:58.280]  that we call high biodiversity and there's about 12 biomes scattered throughout
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:05.600]  the world and if you look at the number of conflicts, wars that have occurred
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:12.600]  about 80% of these since 1953 have occurred in these stressed high
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:18.160]  biodiversity areas and when you stress these biodiversity areas, i.e. fragment
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:24.400]  the jungle, have human enroachment to the edge of the jungle, destroy natural
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:28.840]  food sources, this type of thing for the animals, this is where you start to see
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:34.000]  these viruses jump out. Sure, one argument is South Africa was trying to
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.080]  develop weaponized airborne Ebola and other things. We've played some of those
[01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:43.760]  clips here from the news and I think what Mike's getting into here is we've
[01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:48.120]  had a lot of experts on pointing out that the US is using this outbreak as a
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:51.960]  cover to send in AFRICOM to take over the resources. The Chinese are sending
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:58.920]  thousands of people. No, I don't put anything above the Chinese, but the
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:05.040]  United States and it's a humanitarian thing. The soldiers that are going over
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:11.800]  are from a transport battalion. They're going over very bravely. I don't know
[01:58:11.800 --> 01:58:17.760]  what level of training they receive or self-protection against virus but they're
[01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:22.720]  going over there very bravely because the country asked them to to participate.
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:25.680]  Well it is true that I think they've got five hours training so they're
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:31.160]  certainly not combat groups but folks are looking at that. I know you've got to
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:34.320]  go. If you can do five more minutes with us I want to come back and talk about the
[01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:39.160]  organization that you're part of, ddponline.org. That's a great question
[01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:49.960]  caller. This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:05.000]  Whether it's the radio show, the news websites, documentary films, or the
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:15.880]  nightly news, info wars is the tip of the spear. It's up to us to set brush fires
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:20.120]  in the minds of men and women everywhere and that's what prisonplanet.tv is
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:25.400]  designed to do. You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:30.320]  using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels. What we see now is a
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:34.400]  war against reality, it's a war against the truth. It's more vital than ever
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:38.880]  that supporters of freedom become members of prisonplanet.tv and share
[01:59:38.880 --> 01:59:43.800]  their membership with up to 11 friends and family. Visit infowarsnews.com
[01:59:43.800 --> 01:59:47.800]  today. Become a member, share your membership, and help take the info war
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:50.800]  to the next level.
[01:59:50.800 --> 02:00:05.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:11.800]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers?
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:19.840]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from
[02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:24.880]  Austin, Texas. Alex Jones. We're gonna take a few more calls real quick for our
[02:00:24.880 --> 02:00:28.760]  guest. He's got a go, but we'll have him back sometime to talk about his life and
[02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:32.800]  all the interesting things he's done. Dr. Steven Hatfield, I read a book about him
[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:36.600]  years ago. Very interesting guy. I forget the book's title, but it was that's why I
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:39.240]  was thinking I'd read his book, but she hasn't published yet. He should put it out.
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:43.160]  Very interesting fellow, ddponline.org. He's on the board of it.
[02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:50.160]  Doctors for Disaster Preparedness. Tell us about ddponline.org. I ran into this
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:56.440]  organization through a friend and I really don't join anything, but I had a
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:01:01.960]  look at them. They're a bit controversial, but there were some very well-known
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:14.240]  scientists on their list and ddp is sort of, for the last several years, really
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:24.680]  been looking at the data on man-made cause global warming and some really
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:31.800]  distinguished people. Fred Singer, Dr. Fred Singer, Dr. Willie Soon, you know, some
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:41.960]  very, very established scientists. And slowly I went, I forget what I talked on
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:49.400]  the first time, the best of the presentation, and I went to another
[02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:55.320]  meeting and I started looking at the evidence for man-made cause global warming
[02:01:55.320 --> 02:02:04.760]  myself. And it was quite an eye-opener. You look at the actual scientific data and
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:10.960]  how the politics have become involved and how people just accepted that, well, yes,
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:17.280]  man-made CO2 production was, anyway, I don't want to get into the climate debate.
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:24.440]  But in bottom line is man-made global warming happening? Well, the guy that
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:28.640]  started the weather channel, a very distinguished meteorologist, says it's not
[02:02:28.640 --> 02:02:33.480]  due to man. Of course, it's the sun and if we didn't have carbon dioxide, we'd
[02:02:33.480 --> 02:02:37.800]  all be dead. We're having some great variabilities and unexpected things in
[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:43.280]  our solar cycle with the amount of out-the-energy. It's the sun, it's the
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:48.120]  sun, no matter what the UN says. I'm not a top horologist, but I know it's a sun.
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:52.440]  Not either, and I don't want to get into that, but I enjoyed the fact that
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:59.520]  scientists were challenging government statements based on the
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:03.760]  science and I thought, wow, this is something I'd like to do. So it's a great
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:07.760]  organization for scientists and others and should get involved with it. Let's
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:11.080]  take one final call quickly. Denise in Texas, I'll get to others after he goes.
[02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:16.360]  Denise, real quick question for Dr. Hatfield. Yes, sir, what can I do to help?
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:22.840]  If I call the senator, what can I tell the senator to help? Well, I'll go ahead
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:26.080]  like Lowell. I mean, doctors and people say we should have more of a
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:32.120]  quarantine, right, Doc? Well, that's my opinion. There's going to be a Senate
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:39.480]  hearing, I think on the November 11th, where they're pulling in and don't
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:45.880]  lay everything at the feet of the poor CDC director. He inherited a lot of this
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:51.720]  there's going to be some people that are head of bureaucracies being called up to
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:57.040]  the Hill to answer questions from your elected representatives. So if you had a
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:01.920]  particular question or something you want to, by all means, how it works in this
[02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:06.200]  country, as you contact your elected representative and tell them you have a
[02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:11.440]  question they would like to be asked during that hearing and cross your
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:15.200]  fingers and see if they ask. Well, Doc, I know this. There's clearly an attempt to
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:18.800]  shut down a bowl of news and to cover it up. That's why we're watching it so
[02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:22.720]  closely. Thank you so much for the time and that's Doctors for Disaster
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:27.520]  Preparedness, ddponline.org. Dr. Stephen Hetfield, thank you so much. I hope
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:30.760]  you'll come back on sometime to talk about that book you haven't published in
[02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:35.200]  your, your, what you've done in your life. It's pretty interesting. If I manage to
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:40.320]  stay alive in Africa, I will. Oh, so you're about to go to Africa? Yeah. Oh,
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:43.800]  wow. Well, let us talk to you when you come back. All right, we'll think about
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:47.040]  that. All right. Thank you very much. Okay, sir. There he goes. All right. We're
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:50.440]  going to come back to other calls. You had questions, but you can speak to Ebola
[02:04:50.440 --> 02:04:53.400]  and then we'll open it back up on election news and we're just giving you
[02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:57.040]  different perspectives on Ebola from different well-known experts. Okay.
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:04:58.680]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[02:08:29.280 --> 02:08:34.720]  known bio weapons expert Dr. Stephen Hatfield. I remember at the time they
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:37.840]  tried to blame him for the anthrax. They tried to blame like three other people.
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:42.440]  They got another Patsy. He then died in FBI custody and they claimed he
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:47.880]  committed suicide with Tylenol. So I don't think Hatfield did it and he was one
[02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:55.640]  in court. $5.6 million. I mean, I don't want to be accused of something sometime
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:09:00.920]  and then 14 years after it's found that I wasn't involved, people are, you know,
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:04.440]  saying I did it. Now caller, we didn't screen your call. You could call in and
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:08.920]  say that if you wanted to. It's just that I don't want to. This is what I'm sick
[02:09:08.920 --> 02:09:15.120]  of. I get called a conspiracy theorist when I don't believe things that are
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:19.520]  known lies like we're not bringing any legals and we catch them busting them
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:24.960]  in. They're the ones in a conspiracy. So it's not a theory or secret government
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:33.000]  testing, not a theory. They've been caught or our debt increasing doesn't
[02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:37.240]  increase our debt. That's not true. So they call me a conspiracy theorist. I
[02:09:37.240 --> 02:09:43.560]  call Obama a liar. On the other hand, though, you've got people out there that
[02:09:43.560 --> 02:09:49.560]  just make up realities. They go along and just make stuff up. And I've been such
[02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:55.080]  a victim of it myself that I've got a little more careful over the years. Even
[02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:58.200]  when I think something is going in a direction not to go there unless I can
[02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:03.640]  really prove it because I've been on the receiving end of what you'd call real
[02:10:03.640 --> 02:10:08.400]  conspiracy theories that are just ridiculous. Like I'm Jeff Bridges or I'm
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:14.280]  Bill Hicks or I work for Stratford because they're in the same city I'm in
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:19.880]  of 2 million people. And then meanwhile the Stratford emails get leaked and they
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:22.880]  hate me and are attacking me, which I already knew was going on, which I've
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:29.200]  done nothing to them. But it's just ridiculous that this type of stuff is
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:33.880]  going on and it's frustrating because then it distracts people from the real
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:37.520]  stuff. Now I'm glad that Mark called and I know Mark, he's been calling it for
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:42.200]  like 15, 16 years. He's a medical doctor since a lot of good intel. In fact,
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:45.400]  before I hung up on him, I meant to ask Mark, have you heard up there where
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:50.440]  you're a doctor in a hospital? Have you heard of people being disappeared?
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:54.640]  Because that's, we're being told by medical doctors who will go on record and
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:11:00.040]  off record. That's happening. That's a big deal. That's not a conspiracy
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:04.400]  theory. People are being disappeared. Whether or not they have Ebola, we don't
[02:11:04.400 --> 02:11:10.520]  know. And then Forbes comes out with the bombshell. It's linked and read on
[02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:16.440]  infowars.com. Obama caught ordering press to cover up Ebola. And we should
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:23.720]  add Ebola-like cases. And then the Forbes writer says, yeah, I'm at the meeting and
[02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:27.240]  the media is all there with the head of the CDC response saying, yeah, we cover
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:33.800]  this up when we think somebody has Ebola. Well, then next it's, oh, we cover it up
[02:11:33.800 --> 02:11:37.160]  when they disappear talk show host or we cover it up. That plane crash of that
[02:11:37.160 --> 02:11:40.920]  congressman or we cover it up. We don't need to live in a society like that.
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:44.640]  That's what kills societies. Like one of my favorite philosophers, not just
[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:50.000]  science fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein, a society that gets rid of all
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:55.200]  its troublemakers goes downhill. I rarely find a Robert A. Heinlein book that I
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:11:58.480]  don't love. In fact, maybe that's what influenced me. A lot of stuff did, not
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:02.160]  just the history books around the house growing up that I started reading,
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:05.880]  starting out with, you know, Time Life, World War Two, World War One, the
[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:09.240]  Wild Wild West books. My parents would never really buy me a lot of toys. But if
[02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:13.840]  I said, I want that Time Life book set of the Wild Wild West, you know, adult
[02:12:13.840 --> 02:12:17.200]  books. They're like encyclopedias with pictures. And I would just read that. I'd
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:21.360]  read all the World War Two books, like a 20 volume set that somewhere around the
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:25.400]  office now and read the whole World War One 10 volume set and the whole Civil
[02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:31.280]  War 10 volume set and the whole 10 volume occult set and the stuff I learned
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:35.760]  in that. And then I actually went out and read the original rare books on it to
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:40.040]  understand how the globalist operate. I read, no exaggeration, hundreds of those
[02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:44.440]  by the time I was like 12 years old, by the time I was about six, seven years old.
[02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:48.280]  And I just began to, and then I read Robert A. Heinlein books that would be
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:54.520]  political novels set in the future. And then I think back how much of those were
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:59.160]  really political commentary on what was happening at the time. And Robert A.
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:02.600]  Heinlein Starship Troopers. It's not like the movie. It's different than the movie
[02:13:02.600 --> 02:13:06.480]  with their exoskeleton jumpsuits and the training and everything. That was
[02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:11.480]  adopted as official required reading by West Point in the 70s and still is
[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:16.640]  today. So it just shows how art can influence life and how life can influence
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:21.880]  art can influence life and life can influence art. Certainly interesting,
[02:13:21.880 --> 02:13:26.240]  but a society that gets rid of all its troublemakers goes downhill. Robert A.
[02:13:26.240 --> 02:13:32.920]  Heinlein. Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls. John in Oklahoma, you're on
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:37.560]  the air. Go ahead. Good afternoon, Alex. Hey, buddy. How you doing? Pretty good.
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:43.880]  Okay. I wish I could have gotten in on your guest, but I'm gonna bounce it off of
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:48.160]  you impossibly. Maybe you could keep this in the back of your mind next time
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:53.800]  you interview him or any other guest of his caliper. My question is, is it
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:14:01.680]  possible for this virus to run parallel because you have some my DVM experience
[02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:10.240]  in your past? Is it possible that this virus runs parallel to Parvo virus?
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:14.360]  That's an interesting question. I'm no virologist. I try to study it all. They're
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:18.200]  worried it's going to merge or mutate because it's RNA based, meaning very
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:24.080]  unstable with other viruses, with the flu, with something else. And that's what
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:27.640]  governments have been trying to do is not so much to mutate this virus because
[02:14:27.640 --> 02:14:31.880]  it's unstable, but mutate it with another virus that's more stable. And again, I'm
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:35.160]  no virologist. I just read what they say. And listen, he just told you what the
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:39.840]  African response teams with top Western scientists in there with them have
[02:14:39.840 --> 02:14:43.520]  written in the handbooks. Don't touch people. They believe they're getting it
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:48.720]  from the skin. The virus is in the skin. And it gets into your skin. Obviously,
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:52.160]  it's you're getting it from insects. You're getting it from skin. You're
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:57.640]  getting it from bats flying over, defecating in the air. Obviously, I
[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:02.960]  mean, I mean, his point is, is there's even worse stuff going around that
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:08.960]  they're just covering up like that new virus that hits the lungs. So thank you,
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:12.920]  John. Again, the stuff you're bringing up is above my pay grade. So that is a good
[02:15:12.920 --> 02:15:18.240]  question. John in Illinois, I'll go ahead. You're on the air or Andrew. Excuse
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:25.920]  me. Times the Florida Times Union got a November 4th article Ebola hits
[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:31.080]  healthcare access for other diseases. Well, they're mentioning malaria and
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:35.360]  it's 10,000 deaths from malaria. But really, they're using that to hide the
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:39.640]  Ebola deaths. That's an important article. Yeah, that's been it. I've seen
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:42.240]  that in other mainstream articles that they're covering up the real Ebola
[02:15:42.240 --> 02:15:46.440]  death toll. It's not 5,000. They think it's way above that. Jimmy, in favor,
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:50.680]  watch the headline on that article and we'll look it up. Okay, it is Ebola
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:55.680]  hits healthcare access for other diseases by Jonathan Payne Layla and Sarah
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:16:03.560]  DeLorenzo, Associated Press, November the 4th, 2014 out of the Florida Times
[02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:08.920]  Union. And it says jackseville.com is a web link up on it. No, that's great. I
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:12.920]  mean, we'll look that up. We found that Ebola hits healthcare access for other
[02:16:12.920 --> 02:16:18.600]  diseases. And then you say in the article, they admit that that they're just
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:22.400]  calling it malaria deaths, but it's really Ebola. We do not pay attention. We
[02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:25.600]  have thousands of deaths because of Ebola, but we have tens of thousands of
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:29.680]  deaths from other diseases. We know it's simply that are high numbers of
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:34.040]  deaths from other diseases. But I think that's the smoke screen. Yeah, well, that
[02:16:34.040 --> 02:16:37.720]  article, like you said, doesn't exactly spell that out. But it's clear
[02:16:37.720 --> 02:16:43.560]  that's going on. You can search, you know, all over London telegraph, you name it,
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:47.360]  quoting doctors saying that who've been there, that the death toll is way
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:51.000]  bigger than it is. And I should have talked to Hat Phil about how he's going
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.560]  to Africa, I guess, to treat people. That's why he said, y'all come on your
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:17:01.880]  show. Maybe if I live pretty wild, I should have, I mean, every time you do a
[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:04.840]  great interview like that, you think of all the great questions you could have
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:09.600]  asked later. So that's why I really should always open Twitter questions up
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:13.400]  for every guest. You guys should religiously put out a hashtag an hour
[02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:17.880]  before. So I have some of those questions so that I, because the listeners
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:22.600]  always think about our questions than I do. Let's go ahead. Thank you, Andrew.
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:27.600]  Let's talk to James in Pennsylvania. You're on the year. Hey, Alex, how's it
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:33.160]  going? Good, brother. Yeah, I'm a first time caller. I've been away ever since
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:39.520]  you went to Behemian Grove. That's a while. Yeah. But I'm just calling because
[02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:45.600]  here in Central PA, they are our local news channel 10 WTAJ has done a story
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:52.840]  about the Pennsylvania Health Department monitoring 105 people for Ebola. And I
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:57.280]  guess that's on top of the 80 that came back with all the students in
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:03.880]  September because they were monitoring them as well. What do you think's going
[02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:08.120]  on? I mean, they're telling us forget about Ebola. But if you look at their
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:17.240]  a lot. Well, if you've got Americans going back and forth between these two
[02:18:17.240 --> 02:18:22.880]  countries at this level, we're undoubtedly going to see more Ebola. And then
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:26.160]  you have the government basically getting the media to cover it up. And that's
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:30.280]  confirmed by Forbes. That's a huge story. But don't hold your breath. Don't
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:35.200]  expect it to be covered. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've shared everything and they I'm
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:38.200]  pretty sure they've deleted off their website and everything. So I got a lot
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:42.400]  of students like food. Well, do me a favor, send all those tips to show tips
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:46.920]  at info wars.com or whistleblowers at info wars.com. You are our eyes and
[02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:51.880]  ears. We need your help watching and tracking everything. So please send it
[02:18:51.880 --> 02:18:56.280]  all to info wars.com. Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Missouri. You're on the
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:19:01.440]  year. Go ahead, Alex. It's an honor with regard to this election results and what
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:05.360]  we can expect next. I think as long as we, the American people in the Congress
[02:19:05.360 --> 02:19:10.400]  allow him to, we're going to see an unprecedented number of very unpopular
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:16.160]  executive orders to be signed by Obama. And I think they're unlawful and
[02:19:16.160 --> 02:19:19.560]  unconstitutional. The reason why I say that I'm somewhat of a student of
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:24.360]  constitutional law. And if you look historically at the other executive
[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:29.520]  orders that previous presidents have signed that they are supposed to sign
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:33.960]  they're supposed to provide a reference to a rule of law. You know what? Stay
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:36.960]  there. I want you to explain to me because I know this too, but you're an
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:40.360]  eloquent fellow. I want you to break it down. The first few hundred executive
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:46.840]  orders were Washington requesting money for cutlery and plates and drapes so he
[02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:51.160]  can entertain the French or British ambassador as president. And then he
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:56.680]  has to refer to allotments from Congress of money for the executive. Now
[02:19:56.680 --> 02:20:01.320]  Obama just says, no, I'm a king. I have executive orders. I'm watching and
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:06.280]  waiting for the right time to take everything you own. I love a dark
[02:20:06.280 --> 02:20:10.920]  house. Don't be the next victim of a break in. Go to fake TV dot com and
[02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:15.040]  discover a device that creates the illusion someone is inside watching TV
[02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:18.640]  and makes your own unappealing to would be thieves. Don't these people ever
[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:24.440]  leave? Starting in 2495 and there's free shipping. Go to fake TV dot com or
[02:20:24.440 --> 02:20:29.480]  ask for it at your local hardware store, fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:20:30.600 --> 02:20:34.560]  Hey, Boomer. I learned in school today that 60% of our bodies are made of
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:38.160]  water. Good thing we have the Berkey system. It's the cleanest, best water
[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:41.720]  ever. Mom says it's because the Berkey's filtration system cleans out the
[02:20:41.720 --> 02:20:46.440]  bad stuff and leaks only pure delicious water. I know, right? You love it, too.
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:50.800]  Yeah, I'm thirsty, too. Let's go get some get Berkey clean water by calling
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:59.400]  877-886-3653. That's 877-886-3653 or visit goberkey.com.
[02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:04.480]  Aging starts at the cellular level. When cells become toxic, they die early and
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:09.840]  aging sets in. In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific
[02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:14.160]  discoveries. During that period, key patented compounds have focused on
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:19.640]  mitochondrial growth, nerve growth and rejuvenation. But no one has put together
[02:21:19.640 --> 02:21:24.080]  a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors and
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:28.560]  optimizing your cellular energy at the same time. We now have the synergistic

[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:49.560]  IRS debt. With the IRS's new programs there's never been a better time to solve
[02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:55.400]  your problem. Call 800-34-NO-TAX that's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website
[02:23:55.400 --> 02:23:58.800]  danpilla.com.
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:30.280]  That's a cliched question. It will change things if we stay on the Republicans, if
[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:34.520]  we stop them from destroying the Tea Party, if we take the states back, if we
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:39.520]  promote liberty and freedom everywhere, we will win. I'm not that skilled, I'm not
[02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:44.240]  that eloquent, but I do love liberty and I won't stop. And I've been involved
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:51.240]  politically for 23 years, 20 years on air. And I've reached hundreds of millions
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:58.860]  of people globally. I'm not bragging about that. It's the good news. Now when
[02:24:58.860 --> 02:25:04.280]  I'm at the mall or downtown or even in another city or in an airport, half the
[02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:07.320]  people I walk by, I'm gonna go get a hidden camera and do this in an airport or
[02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:11.280]  something, come over and shake my hand or listeners or give me thumbs up. It's
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:15.360]  like Fight Club or something. The number of people that identify with Alex
[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:20.840]  Jones and most of them probably only seen the show 10 times or heard it a few
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:27.200]  times or seen me on national television and agree with me. The point is they
[02:25:27.200 --> 02:25:34.520]  resonate with Alex Jones, the wild radical. Because I'm not radical. I mean, if
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:37.680]  it's radical to want private property and right to defend myself and national
[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:42.560]  sovereignty and to have transparency in government and to want to prosecute these
[02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:45.920]  big corporations that are tax exempt running our government into the ground.
[02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:52.040]  If that's weird, then I've been weirdo. So I just want to make that positive
[02:25:52.040 --> 02:25:57.680]  announcement again. A lot of you out there aren't in the media. You aren't
[02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:01.440]  well-known. You're not recognized. So you have no idea how many people there are
[02:26:01.440 --> 02:26:06.400]  that are awake. Now there are pockets of the country in every state because I've
[02:26:06.400 --> 02:26:12.640]  been around the nation where almost no one's awake. But then there's pockets
[02:26:12.640 --> 02:26:17.840]  where almost everyone's awake. It's really a weird dichotomy, a weird
[02:26:17.840 --> 02:26:24.040]  paradox. But it doesn't matter if half the public doesn't know how to tie their
[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:27.880]  shoelaces and wants to suck their thumb and believes whatever big government
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:32.600]  tells them. If five percent of us don't go along with it, it will stop. So it's
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:35.800]  time to stop complying with unconstitutional garbage. It's time to
[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:40.560]  stand up for ourselves. But it's time to also try to take the system over. While
[02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:46.040]  building alternative grassroots systems, I say attack on every front. That doesn't
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:50.000]  mean that you have to do everything yourself. The journey a thousand miles
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:55.480]  as the Chinese say starts with a single step. Do little things in your life. Try
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:27:01.000]  to eat organic or non-processed when you can. Try to support good cops when they
[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:04.960]  do the right thing. And then stand up against bad cops or bad government when
[02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:08.200]  they do the wrong thing. Like I told my reporters years ago, I said, you know,
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:12.960]  it's always viral to put a story out when a cop does something really bad. And I
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:17.360]  said, we still want to do those reports because it's what's happening. But we
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:22.480]  want to then try to put a good thing a police officer did next to it or in it
[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:29.200]  or headline something good to magnify good behavior. And it's the same thing
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:34.840]  for us in our own lives. What's the best way to lead a company or to lead your
[02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:41.000]  family is by example. It's an inside job. Just like it always is. This thing's that
[02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:44.320]  song. We got it as bumper music. He's the same guy that has the songs. Kick them
[02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:46.840]  while they're up, kick them while they're down. His name will pop in my head in a
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:51.520]  minute. And I'm not up here preaching. I'm not up here on a high horse. I'm not
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:57.560]  up here saying I have all the answers. I just know the decadent who cares. Only
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:03.840]  be out for yourself. That attitude brings down civilizations. It brings down
[02:28:03.840 --> 02:28:07.600]  societies for a while. If you're living in a free open society and you're being a
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:14.680]  cheat, a liar, a thief, a scammer. Yeah, you'll do okay for a while. But then all
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:18.680]  that comes back on you. But as a society, when it keeps going on for a long
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:24.200]  time, it comes back on the culture itself and civilizations die. And let me tell
[02:28:24.200 --> 02:28:28.000]  you, if this civilization starts to collapse, which every expert, every
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:31.720]  scientist, every mathematician, every economist, in fact, I didn't cover it
[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:36.080]  yesterday. And I meant to you reprint me that Bloomberg article about the top top
[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:40.240]  fund manager and economist analysts saying the economy's totally fake and will
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:45.760]  implode. There's more articles on that today. And I'm not being negative. It's
[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:49.160]  like you're in an airplane. You're running out of gas. We better find a place to land
[02:28:49.160 --> 02:28:54.640]  or we're gonna crash. We're almost out of gas. And the globalists want to use this
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:58.880]  crisis that's coming to bring in total control. We've got to run around like
[02:28:58.880 --> 02:29:02.840]  chickens with our heads cut off to try to get good people in place and to get
[02:29:02.840 --> 02:29:08.080]  good ideas out front so that as things get even worse, we're in a position to
[02:29:08.080 --> 02:29:13.160]  lead not that we have all the answers, but we certainly have good will. We
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:17.120]  certainly have a good heart. We certainly want to fix things. We certainly
[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:21.800]  don't want to cheat people. And we know private property, family, Second
[02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:31.200]  Amendment works. We know being moral, it builds a good society, loving God. And
[02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:34.400]  so we are a free society. You're free to do what you want. As long as it doesn't
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:37.560]  hurt somebody else. Well, what the globalists are doing, signing us on to
[02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:41.040]  their trillions in debt, selling out our sovereignty, trying to dumb down our
[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:45.280]  kids so they can manage them. That is hurting us. And so we have a right to
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:48.120]  take the country and the world back from them. Your calls and news straight
[02:29:48.120 --> 02:29:55.320]  ahead. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN

[02:31:11.680 --> 02:31:17.960]  gussets. There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond
[02:31:17.960 --> 02:31:26.920]  gusset jeans. They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way
[02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:34.760]  they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most. Blue
[02:31:34.760 --> 02:31:42.120]  diamond gussets got it. Others don't. We turned jeans inside out diamond

[02:32:06.480 --> 02:32:10.960]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries
[02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:15.400]  during that period. Key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial
[02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:20.800]  growth, nerve growth and rejuvenation. But no one has put together a formula
[02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:25.320]  that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors and optimizing

[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:24.000]  Crashing through the lives and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:30.880]  I'm going to run through the callers that are on hold right now. Then I'm going to
[02:33:30.880 --> 02:33:35.560]  get into what I mentioned earlier. I meant to cover yesterday. Fund manager.
[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:40.360]  Economy is totally fake, deep crash coming. Singer Elliott says US growth,
[02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:47.760]  optimism, unwarranted as data is cooked. I also saw a story in the Daily Mail that
[02:33:47.760 --> 02:33:54.280]  I agree with but I want to break down. The science of hipsters mathematical
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:34:00.400]  formula shows that trying to look different ultimately makes everyone
[02:34:00.400 --> 02:34:07.960]  look the same. So we're going to be looking at that because that's how they
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:13.360]  basically control people is by creating new fads that everyone buys into.
[02:34:13.360 --> 02:34:17.440]  Thinking they're being different but really they're not and they sell so many
[02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:23.080]  of these paradigms as oh you're being different, you're being cutting edge and
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:26.440]  then you're not really cutting edge, it's being promoted by the establishment.
[02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:31.200]  Let me tell you what's really hip and what's always in style, renaissance,
[02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:38.600]  freedom, true diversity, an open college of ideas, free association, free market.
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:44.800]  Why do I talk about free market all day and why it's so good? It means if a
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:50.800]  company wants to sell bonds that are worthless they can. But then you're
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:56.480]  never going to be able to sell bonds even short term because everyone will find
[02:34:56.480 --> 02:35:02.040]  out you're a fraud. You don't even go prosecute those people. You let people
[02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:05.440]  civilly sue them and stuff like that. They'll be run out of town on a rail and
[02:35:05.440 --> 02:35:09.840]  then it'll go so badly that no one will ever invest in the fly-by-night
[02:35:09.840 --> 02:35:13.600]  operations because folks will be beating down the doors to invest with the
[02:35:13.600 --> 02:35:18.160]  companies that never default, that never cheat, that never steal and that
[02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:24.480]  deliver results. Why do you buy a certain brand of food? Why do you go to
[02:35:24.480 --> 02:35:28.360]  a certain restaurant? Because it's good consistently and they treat you nice and
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:33.440]  make you feel like family. Maybe you eat there 20 times in a year, one time it's
[02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:38.280]  not good. You let it slide. Second time you're not sure. Third time you don't go
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:43.040]  back there. That's what creates excellence in restaurants. Why do you go to areas in
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:46.520]  New York and they have the best Chinese food, the best Italian food, the best
[02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:50.120]  steak houses because it's the biggest city in the US and they've got
[02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:55.080]  incredible competition. Now you pull into some little town that's only got two
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:35:59.760]  restaurants. You already know it's going to be a bunch of filler. It's going to
[02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:04.840]  taste like crud. Nine times out of ten. Just like at tourist traps. They'll have
[02:36:04.840 --> 02:36:08.880]  restaurants that look okay on the surface but have the worst cheapest food.
[02:36:08.880 --> 02:36:13.160]  Fish sticks, they don't even have fish in them. Cheese sticks, they don't have any cheese
[02:36:13.160 --> 02:36:19.760]  in them. Worst food I ever ate was in Corpus Christi, Texas at a tourist trap
[02:36:19.760 --> 02:36:26.680]  right next to the Grey Ghost. The Lexington aircraft carrier went and saw
[02:36:26.680 --> 02:36:32.400]  that with my kids. There's a place there that was like a joke when they brought
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:36.880]  the food out. And you could tell no money went into the food. It was there to
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:40.360]  just prey on people. And that's because it's like government. You don't have a
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:44.520]  choice there at the tourist trap if your kids are hungry. And even though you know
[02:36:44.520 --> 02:36:47.840]  tourist traps have horrible food, you still go in. You still do it. You still
[02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:51.440]  get raked over the coals. It's just like government. You don't hold government
[02:36:51.440 --> 02:36:55.880]  accountable. It becomes just like that where it can do whatever it wants. Same
[02:36:55.880 --> 02:36:59.200]  thing with corporations. Same thing with the private, federal reserve. They can do
[02:36:59.200 --> 02:37:06.560]  whatever they want for 100 plus years. You realize in December it'll be 101
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:12.480]  years. The 100th anniversary, last December 23rd, when three senators and
[02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:17.960]  the dead of night, when everybody was out for the holiday, for Christmas, voted
[02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:24.760]  in the Federal Reserve. The federal, it's private, a private board owned by six
[02:37:24.760 --> 02:37:30.400]  private global banks, the same families since 1913, who can issue unlimited
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:36.000]  currency and credit to themselves. Forbes says 100 years later, the Federal
[02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:40.520]  Reserve has failed everything it tried. Well, it claims it wants to help us. But
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:44.520]  no, it's succeeded in taking over the world, leveraging US capital through
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:51.040]  fraud. But see, what if I had a company that was called federal? And then it
[02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:55.320]  turned out it wasn't federal. Sure, we know federal express or federal
[02:37:55.320 --> 02:37:59.120]  ammunition is not really federal. Because back then, federal was trusted in
[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:03.200]  1913. See, so they wanted to use that name like federal credit union, federal
[02:38:03.200 --> 02:38:07.640]  this, federal that, but the Federal Reserve folks didn't federal. But they
[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:11.760]  get on TV and say, we're a branch of the government above the law. Remember
[02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:17.800]  that clip on the Lair News Hour? Like five years ago, you can pull it up on
[02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:24.720]  YouTube. Alan Greenspan says, fed above the law. Then we can pull that clip up
[02:38:24.720 --> 02:38:29.480]  and he says, oh, what can Congress do? And he goes, nothing, Congress has no
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:32.800]  authority over us. We operate outside of them. And they're doing a good job as
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:39.120]  long as they don't know anything. Congress issues the currency. Congress
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:42.720]  isn't in control of the purse. But that's how backwards all this has gotten. So
[02:38:42.720 --> 02:38:48.600]  now we have the headline on m4wars.com. Obama's dictatorship is democracy. But
[02:38:48.600 --> 02:38:53.680]  America was founded as a republic. He says, I was elected. So it doesn't care
[02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:58.160]  if I ignore the separation of powers legislative and the judicial. I am the
[02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:03.760]  executive. I am unitary. Hitler was elected too. It's at the same thing. They
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:07.680]  use democracy to become a dictator. That's why in a republic, their rules
[02:39:07.680 --> 02:39:13.560]  like in the NFL, their rules and those are the rules this year. And you can't
[02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:22.960]  change them. But he says, you know, yeah, I can. Our first down is whatever I
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:27.360]  say it is a field gold. It can miss going between the polls. That's a field
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:31.880]  gold. But when the other team gets it in the polls, in between the polls, it
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:35.480]  isn't. I'll make up the rules as I go along. How's that sound? That is
[02:39:35.480 --> 02:39:40.680]  dictatorship. Doesn't mean he's a physical dictator like Chilchescu or
[02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:45.880]  Fidel Castro or Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler. But the office has become
[02:39:45.920 --> 02:39:50.240]  dictatorial. Are we going to make the Senate and the House ceremonial going
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:55.400]  to make the governors and the legislature ceremonial? The feds, which are
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:40:00.520]  globalist run, they've been taken over, occupied literally. They say states are
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:04.960]  ceremonial. Police being local or ceremonial. Counties are ceremonial.
[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:09.080]  Your fourth amendment ceremonial, your second amendment ceremonial, your
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:12.360]  right to travel ceremonial. It's a privilege. It's a privilege just because
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:16.720]  they parrot that at you at the police academy. Doesn't mean it's true. It's a
[02:40:16.720 --> 02:40:22.200]  load of bull. And the path that leads us to is tyranny. I don't care how many
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:26.520]  times violate the constitution actually does something good. It doesn't
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:32.720]  matter because at the high levels, they have bad intentions. And so you start
[02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:36.720]  breaking it for little things. You're going to break it on every front.
[02:40:37.600 --> 02:40:41.000]  They're breaking it for the big things up at the top. And so people down to the
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:44.760]  entire strata are saying, I don't have to follow this anymore because, you
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:50.360]  know, nobody else follows it. And then society breaks down. And then things
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:54.120]  are unreliable. America for all its problems was one of the greatest
[02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:57.480]  countries ever to exist and not the greatest because of reliability. People
[02:40:57.480 --> 02:41:00.840]  went with who they trusted, who they knew and who was reliable and it would
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:05.040]  bend over backwards. That's how you build quality. Not what we've got going
[02:41:05.040 --> 02:41:07.840]  now. We are going the opposite direction. I know I'm preaching. I said,
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:11.480]  I'll go to your calls. It just is disgusting to watch this happening.
[02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:17.280]  Take vaccines, vaccines, 500 plus year old technology developed in Europe for
[02:41:17.280 --> 02:41:20.920]  smallpox, where you take some of the pus out of somebody that's got it, give
[02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:24.680]  it to a healthy person while they're healthy, not run down so that their
[02:41:24.680 --> 02:41:28.600]  body's able to beat it. A lot of times you'd be given smallpox when you were
[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:32.600]  healthy. You wouldn't even get sick. You get one pustule. Your body would
[02:41:32.600 --> 02:41:35.080]  isolate it, deal with it instead of getting it when you were run down and
[02:41:35.080 --> 02:41:39.960]  dying. If it was killing 100 people a day in the town of London and I was
[02:41:39.960 --> 02:41:43.000]  afraid it was coming down my street, I might do that to my children, but I'd
[02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:48.040]  make the decision and they knew 300 years ago, 400 years ago, 500 years ago,
[02:41:48.040 --> 02:41:52.880]  it was dangerous. But the liability was, Hey, my kids might dive. I don't do
[02:41:52.880 --> 02:41:54.800]  this. They might dive. I do do this.
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:01.080]  See, but I'm making the decision or my local doctor is, and if he makes
[02:42:01.080 --> 02:42:04.520]  enough bad decisions, people won't go to him anymore. See, people want to go to
[02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:09.040]  the doctor or go to the lawyer or go to the roofer who does the good job over
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:13.880]  and over again, or they do a bad job. They do it right the next time. For
[02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:16.840]  whatever reason, this doctor's just got the magic touch. For whatever reason,
[02:42:16.840 --> 02:42:20.440]  this lawyer's got the magic touch. For whatever reason, this cop keeps solving
[02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:23.680]  all these cases. Let's make him a detective. He keeps solving more cases.
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:28.240]  Let's make him the head detective. That's where you promote because of skill.
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:32.120]  Like Admiral Nimitz came from nowhere, ended up commanding the whole Pacific
[02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:36.160]  Fleet. You don't see that nowadays. Some guy from a small town becoming the head
[02:42:36.160 --> 02:42:42.000]  admiral. Nimitz was in a Navy where it was about not where you came from, but
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:48.880]  what you could do and deliver and that you were honorable. Now they promote in
[02:42:48.880 --> 02:42:51.760]  police departments in most areas of the country. Who will shut up? Who will go
[02:42:51.760 --> 02:42:57.760]  along? Who will play games? Not who is basically psychic. Everybody knows
[02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:00.200]  that's who they used to try to get as detectives was the guys that they don't
[02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:04.360]  know why they know, but 90% of the time they're right. See that? Oh, they don't
[02:43:04.360 --> 02:43:08.440]  want detectives like that nowadays. They want detectives that'll play games and
[02:43:08.440 --> 02:43:11.200]  go along with the system. And when I say psychic, you know what I mean?
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:15.440]  Intuitive. Being able to take a bunch of data and not know why they integrate it,
[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:19.200]  but knowing the answer. That's what it is in business. That's what it is. It's
[02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:23.480]  not just a hunch isn't a hunch. A hunch is when you got a bunch of data and you
[02:43:23.480 --> 02:43:26.720]  look at the probabilities and you know people's MO and you know how people have
[02:43:26.720 --> 02:43:30.560]  operated in the past. And then you look at that data and then you go with your
[02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:36.200]  gut. That's the extrapolation of all of that into a prime answer. Go with your
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:39.680]  gut. You think a giant government and black uniforms and cameras everywhere is
[02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:44.760]  good. It ain't. Oh, it's got some good uses, but it doesn't midterm or long
[02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:53.240]  term. It always goes bad. And it is bad. I'm really preaching now. We do have the
[02:43:53.240 --> 02:43:58.120]  clip of Alan Greenspan on PBS shooting his mouth off so calmly. Well, what is
[02:43:58.120 --> 02:44:01.720]  Congress's role with the Fed? There is none, my boy. We're a completely
[02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:06.480]  independent agency. See, not saying of government, just saying agency. We're the
[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:12.400]  Fed. We're the agency. It's a counterfeit. It's a fraud just like Obama. Let's go to
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:17.880]  that clip. Well, first of all, the Federal Reserve is an independent agency and
[02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:25.400]  that means basically that there is no other agency of government which can
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:33.560]  overrule actions that we take. So long as that is in place and there is no
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:39.920]  evidence that the administration or the Congress or anybody else is requesting
[02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:44.240]  that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing, then what
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:50.480]  the relationships are don't frankly matter. And I've had that clip only has
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:55.080]  3,000 views. You should have 5 million views, 10 million views, 20. There's the
[02:44:55.080 --> 02:45:00.120]  former head of the Federal Reserve calmly going, well, we're an independent
[02:45:00.120 --> 02:45:02.560]  agency implying his government. You didn't say of government, independent
[02:45:02.560 --> 02:45:12.240]  agency. And then he goes on to say the role is we can do whatever we want. And as
[02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:16.600]  long as government does what we says, that's proper. I'm king of the universe
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:21.360]  and as long as you do what six mainly foreign banks say that took over and
[02:45:21.360 --> 02:45:26.160]  conned you dumb American hayseeds in 1913, that's what he's really thinking.
[02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:31.000]  You know, as long as you do what we say, you're doing a great job. As long as I'm
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:34.520]  king of the universe and you do everything I say and I'm totally
[02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:39.800]  secret and I'm above the law and I can take 47 trillion dollars of US taxpayer
[02:45:39.800 --> 02:45:44.280]  money that they put onto our debt and derivatives and give it to foreign banks,
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:48.960]  most bailout money, as long as you let us totally screw you seven ways to Sunday,
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:54.560]  that's proper. I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with my
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:46:01.320]  executive authority to make sure that we don't keep on making the system worse,
[02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:08.920]  but that whatever executive actions that I take will be replaced and supplanted by
[02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:14.000]  action by Congress. You send me a bill that I can sign and those executive
[02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:20.240]  actions go away. That's a commitment I made not to just to the American people
[02:46:20.240 --> 02:46:24.920]  and to businesses. Did you hear that? That was Obama. He said that yesterday and he
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:29.960]  had another press conference today saying the same thing. So what he's saying is,
[02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:34.760]  I will do whatever I want executively, but if you send me a bill I agree with,
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:38.800]  I'll sign it and then you can be a party to it. That's like walking up to a woman
[02:46:38.800 --> 02:46:43.480]  in a restaurant saying, if you have sex with me, it won't be right, but if you
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:46.600]  don't have sex with me, I'm gonna hit you over the head and rape you on the
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:53.920]  table. This can be consensual or I can rape you is what Obama's saying. This
[02:46:53.920 --> 02:46:58.840]  all flies in the face of logic and the reason they're so bold saying you didn't
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:04.120]  build your business two plus two equals five, dads are bad, the state owns your
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:09.520]  kids, Hillary says businesses don't hire people, is they're trying to get the
[02:47:09.520 --> 02:47:17.320]  public used to hearing crazy stuff. They're waging war on reality. That's
[02:47:17.320 --> 02:47:21.720]  what they're doing. All right, I'm gonna go to your calls here, Rob, been holding
[02:47:21.720 --> 02:47:26.240]  the longest and that was a William, Rob, Tim, John and others. We're gonna go to
[02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:28.560]  break here in a moment, come right back to you in this next six minute segment.
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:33.240]  I'll do some customary overdrive to finish up with those calls and I'll try
[02:47:33.240 --> 02:47:37.320]  to get into the science of hipsters as well in a minute or two of that
[02:47:37.320 --> 02:47:41.280]  overdrive and more on what this economist said but I've got to get to that
[02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:46.320]  right now and of course I can't find it in my stack. Oh, here it is. This is an
[02:47:46.320 --> 02:47:51.080]  amazing article by Bloomberg because it's the establishment saying it and this
[02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:54.000]  article came out November 4th. I haven't gotten around to covering it yet. A
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:59.160]  singer Elliott says US growth optimism unwarranted as data cooked and he goes
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:04.600]  on to say that we live in a quote totally fake economy headed for a quote
[02:48:04.600 --> 02:48:11.840]  deep crash. Deep means not just in fiat numbers but deep and the real economy in
[02:48:11.840 --> 02:48:15.400]  most sectors has been in a crash. I mean everybody knows it costs more money,
[02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:21.880]  everything's healthcare, energy's going up on average. I mean I just hate poverty.
[02:48:21.880 --> 02:48:26.120]  I hate seeing people not doing good. These globalists want to see you doing bad
[02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:30.840]  because then they can run your life and Paul Singer's Elliott Management Corps
[02:48:30.840 --> 02:48:35.080]  said optimism on US growth is misguided and economic data understate
[02:48:35.080 --> 02:48:39.560]  inflation and overstate growth and central bank policies the past six years
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:44.840]  aren't sustainable. And by the way all I'm almost all the big fund managers as
[02:48:44.840 --> 02:48:47.680]  you know have been quietly getting their own money completely out the last four
[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:52.640]  or five years and into hard assets, farmland and infrastructure and energy
[02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:56.080]  and things like that you'll still have to have and he basically goes into all
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:49:01.040]  that that when confidence is lost that loss can be severe sudden and
[02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:04.760]  simultaneous across a number of markets and sectors and he goes in to say the
[02:49:04.760 --> 02:49:08.280]  zero interest rates of the Federal Reserve have fueled a false economy and
[02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:11.600]  that it's just going to be disastrous. I mean of course you've already heard that
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:17.720]  a million times here. Common Sense says that but we're sitting on top of Powder
[02:49:17.720 --> 02:49:25.920]  Kick and let me tell you when the welfare checks to a hundred billion people, it's a
[02:49:25.920 --> 02:49:29.560]  hundred and one million that are on some type of subsidy or more and fifty
[02:49:29.560 --> 02:49:35.280]  something million on food stamps, that's federal, federal card. There's a bunch of
[02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:39.520]  other supplementals it's way over fifty million. When the food
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:44.080]  doesn't get delivered or the money on their card won't buy it because
[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:50.080]  of inflation or because of shortages, America is primed to explode because
[02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:53.640]  there's not just spoiled yuppies and spoiled rich people. Our poor who don't
[02:49:53.640 --> 02:49:57.640]  work are incredibly spoiled and then there's all the poor people that work
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:50:00.880]  two, three, four jobs that are holding the country up that have to live around
[02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:05.760]  all these welfare people and put up with them and all their arrogance. So I've seen
[02:50:05.760 --> 02:50:08.880]  the statistics you'll have the working family with like no crime and then you
[02:50:08.880 --> 02:50:12.200]  have the welfare family next door that's robbing their house and beating their
[02:50:12.200 --> 02:50:17.840]  kid up and their kids in a gang. People aren't gonna put up with this stuff as
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:22.520]  it unravels and as the welfare heads try to come over and rob the working poor.
[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:26.000]  It's gonna be explosive. Let me just say this, I know why the cops are buying
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.040]  armored vehicles and all the rest of it. I just don't like them training to fight
[02:50:29.040 --> 02:50:34.120]  the Tea Party and gun owners. They're trying to save the country but no amount
[02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:37.080]  of armored vehicles are gonna stop the depression hitting your family as well
[02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:41.320]  and I know people in the government know this. It's just a horrible situation.
[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:46.600]  Foreign banks engineered this and their solutions to the crash that's coming
[02:50:46.600 --> 02:50:50.600]  are gonna be give them more power. So all I can say is we need to reverse that.
[02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:54.960]  Don't forget the incredible supplements we have available at infowarslife.com
[02:50:54.960 --> 02:51:00.040]  like Survival Shield X2 discounted 10% off in the Bio Defense Pack.

[02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:20.520]  Hi, Ted Anderson with Midas Resources. Is it time to convert paper 401Ks and IRAs

[02:51:29.960 --> 02:51:36.640]  I am a 47 year old female and had a heart attack in 2005. This is Alice from New Jersey.
[02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:42.840]  I still get angina even with four stints. I was taking nitro two or three times a week.
[02:51:42.840 --> 02:51:47.840]  The very first day after taking heart and body extract, the chest pain was gone.
[02:51:47.840 --> 02:51:49.840]  Now I don't wear a nitro patch.

[02:52:27.440 --> 02:52:32.240]  Not our iodine, it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits
[02:52:32.240 --> 02:52:34.840]  and is tested and proven to be completely pure.

[02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:04.640]  Quantitive easing, unemployment at depression levels, Europe financial system falling apart,
[02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:06.640]  China getting out of US Treasuries.
[02:53:06.640 --> 02:53:13.840]  At the end of 2008, the time of tarp, the national debt was at 11 trillion gold trading around $850 per ounce.
[02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:20.640]  Close to 2012, the national debt exceeded $16.4 trillion, gold doubled to $1600 per ounce.
[02:53:20.640 --> 02:53:23.840]  The 20 trillion threshold for the national debt is inevitable.
[02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:28.040]  Politicians in Washington have a ferocious appetite for spending and stimulus.
[02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:30.640]  What's worse, a printing press to finance.
[02:53:30.640 --> 02:53:36.440]  A hundred years ago, we had a gold standard to limit this madness, but now you have to adopt your own gold standard.

[02:54:20.840 --> 02:54:24.640]  But don't adopt it because everybody else is adopting it.
[02:54:24.640 --> 02:54:29.440]  Within that, feminism, gun control, Obama cult.
[02:54:29.440 --> 02:54:35.040]  Like, don't make this Republican takeover about how they're the new celebrities and they're up there like a bunch of narcissists
[02:54:35.040 --> 02:54:39.440]  and they won and they're great and we're going to rub the Democrats' noses in it.
[02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:44.640]  How about you reverse the damage to the country? How about you be servants?
[02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:50.440]  How about it not be a cult where we feel like we're winners now because they got in?
[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:54.640]  We're not winners, we just repudiated the vanguard of the globalist takeover
[02:54:54.640 --> 02:55:01.040]  and now their buddies are like filling the slot acting like they're not running the same operation.
[02:55:01.040 --> 02:55:05.840]  We have to fully identify them, radicalize our rhetoric to the level of reality.
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:13.940]  Notice they're always on CNN, Fox, MSNBC saying don't be radical, do what Mainline Republicans say, work with the Democrats.
[02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:20.240]  We need to be nice, we need to know, they're telling you obviously tactics that'll fail.
[02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:24.340]  It's so obvious, it's so frustrating.
[02:55:24.340 --> 02:55:30.140]  How am I able to reach 15, 20 million people a week conservatively with all our platforms?
[02:55:30.140 --> 02:55:34.840]  It's not because I play patty cake and regurgitate party line.
[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:40.440]  I regurgitate common sense party line that's worked over and over again, that's why my job's so easy.
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:47.740]  Tell the truth, promote common sense, but see in a world of tyranny that is basically heresy.
[02:55:47.740 --> 02:55:52.340]  Well fine, I'm a heretic then, I don't worship at the altar of the state and you don't either.
[02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:55.440]  So let's get out there, we've got the answers.
[02:55:55.440 --> 02:56:01.540]  We shouldn't be haughtier arrogant but we should be a bit commanding, a bit imperious about all this
[02:56:01.540 --> 02:56:08.540]  because we know how to save the ship and so notice they're imperious to us so we sit down and shut up.
[02:56:08.540 --> 02:56:10.640]  Uh-uh, that's over with.
[02:56:10.640 --> 02:56:14.140]  Go ahead, Rob from Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:21.340]  Yeah, he's talking, his audio's real low.
[02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:24.940]  Yeah, I can't hear him, we're gonna have to let it, yeah, we had bad audio there.
[02:56:24.940 --> 02:56:26.940]  Sorry, Rob, I could barely hear you.
[02:56:26.940 --> 02:56:30.640]  William in Virginia, go ahead.
[02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:34.740]  Yeah, we got a phone system problem, so that's what it is.
[02:56:34.740 --> 02:56:40.040]  Network may be able to hear him, I'm not able, I can barely hear him in the background, John.
[02:56:40.040 --> 02:56:42.340]  Yeah, yeah, we've lost a phone system.
[02:56:42.340 --> 02:56:45.640]  I'm sorry folks, that's one way to not get on air.
[02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:50.840]  A few times a year the phone system will either hang up on everybody or it'll go to no audio,
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:54.040]  which it just basically did.
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:57:01.740]  But hey, it's at the end of the broadcast, so what do you do with them apples?
[02:57:01.740 --> 02:57:07.840]  I do have my hipsters stacked, but I almost don't want to, you know, not do justice to it,
[02:57:07.840 --> 02:57:13.540]  and I want to do a whole special report, if not, Friday's the worst day to let something out,
[02:57:13.540 --> 02:57:18.040]  but maybe I should do a report for the Natalie News tonight, I just want to do it justice.
[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:22.440]  Here's the article, though, that I've been mentioning, we'll get it linked up on infowars.com.
[02:57:22.440 --> 02:57:30.840]  The science of hipsters, mathematical formula, shows that trying to look different ultimately makes everyone look the same.
[02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:34.440]  Hipster paradox states trying to be different makes people look the same.
[02:57:34.440 --> 02:57:38.940]  Experts created a formula that proves, I want to get this guy on, why the phenomenon takes place.
[02:57:38.940 --> 02:57:43.240]  He said there is a delay between the time a trend begins to gain traction.
[02:57:43.240 --> 02:57:46.640]  This is because people can't be aware of what others decide in real time.
[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:51.540]  As a result, hipsters gradually realize the decision has been made while making the same decision,
[02:57:51.540 --> 02:57:53.740]  ultimately end up conforming.
[02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:58.640]  True hipsters would need to be consistently changing and adapting their style.
[02:57:58.640 --> 02:58:02.040]  Studies suggest this is impossible and too difficult to maintain.
[02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:07.840]  Hey, how about you just go with what's timeless or with what you like?
[02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:12.040]  My hair is the same it was that was falling out when I was 15.
[02:58:12.040 --> 02:58:20.240]  My about the same shoes, same watches, same cars, same everything.
[02:58:20.240 --> 02:58:26.040]  I go to the same restaurants, but I do new stuff and I'm always adding new things, but I just cannot imagine,
[02:58:26.040 --> 02:58:29.440]  hey, you know, those shoes are out of style.
[02:58:29.440 --> 02:58:33.940]  You know what, I'm going to wear my cowboy boots and you can do whatever you want.
[02:58:33.940 --> 02:58:37.640]  You may go to hell, I will go to Texas to quote Davey Crockett, I'm just joking.
[02:58:37.640 --> 02:58:40.240]  I'm going to come back and overdrive and see if the phone system is working.
[02:58:40.240 --> 02:58:44.240]  PresidentPlanet.TV, family news tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[02:58:44.240 --> 02:59:08.240]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:59:08.240 --> 02:59:15.840]  For how long, go to infidelbodyarmor.com, spelled I-N-F-I-D-E-L body armor.com.
[02:59:15.840 --> 02:59:20.040]  Infidel body armor just won't quit.
[02:59:20.040 --> 02:59:23.440]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others,
[02:59:23.440 --> 02:59:30.540]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[02:59:30.540 --> 02:59:37.040]  Super male vitality by Info Wars Life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:39.440]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day.
[02:59:39.440 --> 02:59:42.440]  I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality.
[02:59:42.440 --> 02:59:47.040]  Visit infowarslife.com today to secure your super male vitality
[02:59:47.040 --> 03:00:13.040]  and other powerful products from Info Wars Life.
[03:00:13.040 --> 03:00:21.040]  We are now entering overdrive with your host, Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines.
[03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:49.040]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:51.040]  But good job, Matt Drudge.
[03:00:51.040 --> 03:00:55.040]  That's why people go to drudgereport.com.
[03:00:55.040 --> 03:01:01.040]  It's because we get video of the War Patrol loading illegals on buses and giving them vouchers and admitting it.
[03:01:01.040 --> 03:01:04.040]  War Patrol is the ones that called us to tell us to come see it.
[03:01:04.040 --> 03:01:08.040]  And Drudge will pick it up, but the New York Times took a month too.
[03:01:08.040 --> 03:01:09.040]  Same thing here.
[03:01:09.040 --> 03:01:14.040]  See media, journalism is about being on the cutting edge and telling people what's going on.
[03:01:14.040 --> 03:01:16.040]  People want to be informed, not lying to them.
[03:01:16.040 --> 03:01:21.040]  This whole article is about Obama caught ordering press to cover up Ebola.
[03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:23.040]  And Drudge is linked to that.
[03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:25.040]  I changed the headline.
[03:01:25.040 --> 03:01:27.040]  Paul did have a more professional headline.
[03:01:27.040 --> 03:01:37.040]  We might even change it back because it's going to get so much attention dealing with the fact that the press admits that they are lying about potential Ebola cases under orders.
[03:01:37.040 --> 03:01:40.040]  In fact, you can go to the URL and see what it actually said.
[03:01:40.040 --> 03:01:44.040]  Media agrees not to report on suspicious Ebola cases in the U.S.
[03:01:44.040 --> 03:01:48.040]  But really, what would the headline on that be?
[03:01:48.040 --> 03:01:55.040]  Because it's so sensational, but how do you properly state it?
[03:01:55.040 --> 03:02:01.040]  Press admits that they are in active cover up of potential Ebola cases.
[03:02:01.040 --> 03:02:03.040]  I mean, I guess it is the Obama administration.
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:07.040]  I guess the proper headline is Obama administration caught ordering press.
[03:02:07.040 --> 03:02:10.040]  There you go. Obama administration.
[03:02:10.040 --> 03:02:11.040]  That's the great part about this.
[03:02:11.040 --> 03:02:16.040]  We can edit this live on air, make it even better, more accurate, and then be transparent with you.
[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:18.040]  But it's just such a big deal.
[03:02:18.040 --> 03:02:21.040]  In fact, I was about to ask, why is no one picking this up?
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:23.040]  This is so big. Forbes admits this.
[03:02:23.040 --> 03:02:30.040]  And we have medical doctors saying it's going on, and police saying it's going on, and firefighters saying it's going on, and EMTs say it's going on.
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:37.040]  And when we broke this a few weeks ago, and now it's been confirmed again, their answer was, oh, that's that crazy guy, Alex.
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:39.040]  You know what I have gone kind of crazy.
[03:02:39.040 --> 03:02:41.040]  You focus on this stuff every day.
[03:02:41.040 --> 03:02:44.040]  You start freaking out how crazy the system is.
[03:02:44.040 --> 03:02:47.040]  Tim and Ohio, you're on the air. Welcome.
[03:02:47.040 --> 03:02:49.040]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:02:49.040 --> 03:02:50.040]  Good. Go ahead.
[03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:53.040]  About the cover up with the Ebola.
[03:02:53.040 --> 03:03:00.040]  Now, isn't there a section in the Obamacare where they are going to chip everybody?
[03:03:00.040 --> 03:03:08.040]  What better way than to keep it secret, let it spread, let it get so bad that there's mandatory vaccinations, and then they slip the chip in then.
[03:03:08.040 --> 03:03:14.040]  Well, they've got nanotechs, microscopic size chips now, so they have been testing putting them in vaccines.
[03:03:14.040 --> 03:03:16.040]  They're in hundreds of new pills coming out.
[03:03:16.040 --> 03:03:17.040]  Well, you're taking an opiate.
[03:03:17.040 --> 03:03:19.040]  We're going to track you with live chips in your belly.
[03:03:19.040 --> 03:03:25.040]  So, yes, it's all coming out, and it's in Obamacare to pay for the chipping of patients.
[03:03:25.040 --> 03:03:29.040]  It doesn't force it, it just pays, and that's covered under insurance.
[03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:31.040]  All right, we're out of time.
[03:03:31.040 --> 03:03:32.040]  Great job to the crew.
