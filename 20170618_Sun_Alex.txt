[00:01:49.013 --> 00:01:57.319]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.801]  Info Wars is the brainchild of radio host Alex Jones.
[00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:01.582]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:01.582 --> 00:02:02.102]  Jones.
[00:02:02.102 --> 00:02:02.803]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:02.803 --> 00:02:03.123]  Jones.
[00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:03.904]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:03.904 --> 00:02:04.284]  Jones.
[00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:09.595]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:10.255]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.355]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:12.616]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:12.616 --> 00:02:13.396]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:13.396 --> 00:02:13.976]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:15.237]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:15.237 --> 00:02:16.197]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:16.197 --> 00:02:18.038]  Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[00:02:18.038 --> 00:02:19.478]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:02:19.478 --> 00:02:21.459]  There's a guy on the radio.
[00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.620]  His name is Alex Jones.
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.360]  Alex Jones.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.901]  Alex Jones of the Muslim world, you know.
[00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:27.483]  That man is saying you watch your mouth.
[00:02:27.483 --> 00:02:29.444]  Time to stop submitting to this charity!
[00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:31.946]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved!
[00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:33.467]  I heard that on Alex Jones!
[00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:36.849]  InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.012]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[00:02:41.012 --> 00:02:44.554]  Nobody can dispute the fact that you're a great man.
[00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:47.536]  InfoWars.com.
[00:02:47.536 --> 00:02:48.617]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:02:48.997 --> 00:03:18.036]  InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars InfoWars
[00:03:33.527 --> 00:03:38.210]  That was the real Hank Hill saying he likes Alex Jones.
[00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.373]  That's Mike Judge, the voice and creator of Hank Hill.
[00:03:41.373 --> 00:03:44.135]  He says, Hank Hill likes me.
[00:03:44.135 --> 00:03:46.296]  An engineer, a patriot, a father, Mike Judge.
[00:03:46.296 --> 00:03:49.519]  But the MSN doesn't.
[00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.120]  See how that works?
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.081]  He was somebody I'd like to show.
[00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:55.863]  But not MSNBC, not CNN.
[00:03:55.863 --> 00:03:57.565]  Isn't that funny?
[00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:01.728]  But getting serious here, this is part of four hours at least of live coverage.
[00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:14.618]  of the Megyn Kelly disinformation piece that is a definite deep state production by every yardstick.
[00:04:14.618 --> 00:04:31.023]  I have clips we're going to play today from today of CNN and other channels saying I'm a virus, that I'm the worst person on earth, that I shouldn't even be allowed to be on air.
[00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:40.366]  And there's all these shows making jokes about me talking about human-animal chimeras.
[00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:42.388]  So I just keep hammering on that.
[00:04:42.388 --> 00:04:48.554]  Just like estrogen mimickers causing massive cancer and sexual confusion in the water supply, they make jokes about that.
[00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:50.616]  You know, the gay frogs.
[00:04:50.616 --> 00:04:52.598]  They are so scared, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:52.598 --> 00:04:57.083]  They are so scared of just the fact that we're here pointing out what they're really doing.
[00:04:58.046 --> 00:05:01.007]  For 30 years they've had human-animal chimeras.
[00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:03.769]  Now it's all over scientific journals.
[00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:08.191]  They've legalized it in the United States.
[00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:15.474]  But they all say he's insane and says that there's half-human, half-animal creations that don't have rights and should have rights.
[00:05:15.474 --> 00:05:21.057]  I'm going to force that issue out because that'll expose the nanotech, the genetic engineering, all of it.
[00:05:21.057 --> 00:05:23.598]  Then they also say everywhere, I don't believe in the moon landings.
[00:05:23.598 --> 00:05:24.899]  That's not true either!
[00:05:26.152 --> 00:05:29.455]  We have a bigger space program than they even tell you, and that's been admitted.
[00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:32.337]  Something like 80-something percent of it.
[00:05:32.337 --> 00:05:34.159]  It's secret.
[00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:44.228]  You know, I love how when they had that experimental X-whatever-it-is space plane land a few months ago, they had guys out there in spacesuits all around it, in case microbes in space got on it.
[00:05:44.228 --> 00:05:51.694]  And they're not worried about, on this planet, creating new species that can jump species, which is already happening.
[00:05:51.694 --> 00:05:52.615]  That's the real threat.
[00:05:52.615 --> 00:05:53.636]  It's already happened.
[00:05:55.285 --> 00:05:56.946]  I'm digressing.
[00:05:56.946 --> 00:05:58.287]  We're not gonzo journalism.
[00:05:58.287 --> 00:05:59.487]  We don't make the story about us.
[00:05:59.487 --> 00:06:03.990]  The media has done that, but they create a straw man and then they demonize it.
[00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.093]  And Megyn Kelly, the quotes are out there, said, I'm not doing a hit piece.
[00:06:10.093 --> 00:06:11.494]  I'm doing a nice piece.
[00:06:11.494 --> 00:06:12.394]  You can trust me.
[00:06:12.394 --> 00:06:13.335]  You've got my word.
[00:06:13.335 --> 00:06:15.236]  We're going to play some of those clips coming up.
[00:06:15.236 --> 00:06:20.379]  So I played the pre-interview just to show that when you see the hit piece of all hit pieces, she's a liar.
[00:06:21.363 --> 00:06:24.085]  And then, I know in the promo piece they edited things together.
[00:06:24.085 --> 00:06:26.686]  That didn't make sense, so we have it recorded.
[00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:28.648]  People say, when will you release it?
[00:06:28.648 --> 00:06:29.768]  Probably a couple days.
[00:06:29.768 --> 00:06:33.350]  I mean, I guess I could upload it all raw.
[00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:40.195]  But I wanted to just be able to show you clips of where they had me edit it and then show you what I really said, so it's illustrative.
[00:06:40.195 --> 00:06:43.597]  But, who knows, I may just lazily release the whole thing tonight.
[00:06:43.597 --> 00:06:44.938]  You know what?
[00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:46.659]  Let's start loading it in the computers.
[00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:48.440]  Should we start the upload right now?
[00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.750]  I don't know.
[00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.512]  What do you think?
[00:06:50.512 --> 00:06:51.716]  We're going to cover it live too.
[00:06:51.716 --> 00:06:53.621]  Our show starts in about two hours.
[00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:54.022]  Stay with us.
[00:06:58.363 --> 00:07:02.126]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:07:02.126 --> 00:07:09.872]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:07:09.872 --> 00:07:18.500]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:25.085]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war, pathogens added to the food and water,
[00:07:25.265 --> 00:07:25.505]  We're good.
[00:07:47.295 --> 00:07:50.176]  Discover why Anthroplex is turning so many heads today.
[00:07:50.176 --> 00:07:53.257]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands.
[00:07:53.257 --> 00:08:03.481]  And it starts at Infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[00:08:03.481 --> 00:08:10.423]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:08:10.423 --> 00:08:12.524]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:08:14.707 --> 00:08:19.811]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:27.217]  I don't know how this is going to end.
[00:08:27.217 --> 00:08:34.023]  You globalists want to destroy our country, attack our families, make us poor, bring in radical jihadists.
[00:08:34.023 --> 00:08:34.724]  You want to fight?
[00:08:34.724 --> 00:08:36.005]  You better believe you've got one.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.181]  And I expect this fight.
[00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:40.822]  I expect it.
[00:08:40.822 --> 00:08:53.430]  These people are lying scum that have lied about WMDs in multiple countries to go invade them, get our troops killed, overthrow secular governments, and then put Al-Qaeda and ISIS-type trash in.
[00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:58.593]  They lied with dead babies in incubators with their brains bashed out in Kuwait.
[00:08:58.593 --> 00:08:59.113]  Never happened.
[00:08:59.113 --> 00:09:00.474]  They admit it never happened.
[00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:01.655]  With a PR firm and CNN. 1990.
[00:09:06.135 --> 00:09:10.958]  To launch a war that killed millions of people and turn the Middle East over to Al Qaeda.
[00:09:10.958 --> 00:09:13.400]  It's bipartisan.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:19.425]  Do they tell you you're not supposed to question mass shootings and other events when governments have been caught over and over again?
[00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:27.991]  Like in Operation Northwoods, declassified in 2000, talked about the government wanting to stage mass shootings in America to take our freedoms.
[00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:28.931]  Hmm.
[00:09:28.931 --> 00:09:29.492]  ABC News.
[00:09:31.226 --> 00:09:38.488]  So of course I've war-gamed and questioned many multiple events, but I, looking at it, think that Newtown did happen.
[00:09:38.488 --> 00:09:42.790]  But I'm not the creator of people questioning Newtown and Sandy Hook.
[00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.051]  My guests covered it, I've covered it, we've looked at it.
[00:09:45.051 --> 00:09:57.475]  Why do they have PR firms in Bloomberg and all the media now saying, on Father's Day, he goes on TV, that's the promos now, we knew it was coming, on Father's Day, Jones dare go on air and tell the families
[00:09:58.075 --> 00:10:00.557]  That their children didn't die, coming up.
[00:10:00.557 --> 00:10:02.859]  Jones picked Father's Day.
[00:10:02.859 --> 00:10:10.345]  No, they told me it wouldn't be about Newtown, but then I told them I thought Newtown happened on tape, so they edited it and had me say it didn't happen, basically, in their promo.
[00:10:10.345 --> 00:10:19.993]  And then they go to the families and say, oh, see, he's sending people to harass you, and it's all the media hyping it, all the media pushing it, all the media... I mean, I hardly ever even talk about Newtown.
[00:10:19.993 --> 00:10:24.096]  It's one of, you know, unfortunately, hundreds of mass shootings in the last 50 years.
[00:10:24.096 --> 00:10:24.897]  It's incredible!
[00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.661]  But see, on CNN and Fox and everywhere, they have the talking point.
[00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:34.763]  If we interview dictators and child molesters and murderers, we can interview Jones.
[00:10:34.763 --> 00:10:36.903]  That's what the good guy will say.
[00:10:36.903 --> 00:10:37.804]  The pro-First Amendment.
[00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:40.845]  Well, Jones is the worst human on earth, but he's got free speech.
[00:10:40.845 --> 00:10:44.466]  And the other host, no, he's even worse, because he's a virus.
[00:10:44.466 --> 00:10:48.927]  He's... I'm effective.
[00:10:48.927 --> 00:10:49.868]  I'm effective.
[00:10:50.931 --> 00:10:54.972]  I'm effective because I tell the truth and I remind people.
[00:10:54.972 --> 00:10:58.272]  And I go, oh, here's Gruber saying, thank God you're so dumb.
[00:10:58.272 --> 00:11:02.873]  We're going to triple prices and rip you off.
[00:11:02.873 --> 00:11:06.814]  And then I show Gruber saying, I never said that.
[00:11:06.814 --> 00:11:11.475]  Or I show you clips of Comey on May 3rd and on June 8th saying no one tried to influence me.
[00:11:11.475 --> 00:11:12.595]  Nobody obstructed justice.
[00:11:12.595 --> 00:11:14.375]  And then I show the news saying it never happened.
[00:11:14.375 --> 00:11:16.335]  We're insane.
[00:11:16.335 --> 00:11:18.956]  They use my name and go, fake news, Alex Jones.
[00:11:19.864 --> 00:11:21.766]  And fake news, Mike Cernovich.
[00:11:21.766 --> 00:11:24.429]  And fake news, Posobiec.
[00:11:24.429 --> 00:11:25.990]  They just made it up!
[00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.631]  And I go, oh really?
[00:11:26.631 --> 00:11:27.172]  I made it up?
[00:11:27.172 --> 00:11:29.794]  Here's the clips!
[00:11:29.794 --> 00:11:35.681]  They don't like the fact that millions of people, oh and by the way, they're really upset because the graph is steadily going up.
[00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.911]  We had a big peak at the election.
[00:11:37.911 --> 00:11:39.732]  Eighty-something million people in one week tuned in.
[00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:42.374]  And it went down some, but it's compared to before the election.
[00:11:42.374 --> 00:11:43.855]  We're at a new plateau.
[00:11:43.855 --> 00:11:47.018]  We went up to the top of a mesa, and you know, we hit a peak, and then kind of went down off of it.
[00:11:47.018 --> 00:11:49.099]  We're still going into the high country.
[00:11:49.099 --> 00:11:50.500]  We're going up!
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.581]  Up, up!
[00:11:51.581 --> 00:11:52.202]  Like Icarus!
[00:11:53.516 --> 00:11:57.297]  And by the way, I use that example because I know how things ended for Icarus.
[00:11:57.297 --> 00:12:01.858]  I'm not trying to fly high towards the sun on some personal mission of power.
[00:12:01.858 --> 00:12:08.920]  I'm doing this because these evil, pedophile, globalist, New World Order, radical Islamists pushing trash.
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.862]  They gotta have somebody belly up to them and give them a fight.
[00:12:13.862 --> 00:12:15.842]  And I tell you, I'm just so honored to be in this position.
[00:12:15.842 --> 00:12:19.983]  So whatever they do, just like I always tell them, do whatever you gotta do.
[00:12:19.983 --> 00:12:21.984]  You serve your God, I serve mine.
[00:12:21.984 --> 00:12:22.604]  That's the way the
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.662]  That's the way the cow ate the cabbage, isn't it?
[00:12:25.662 --> 00:12:27.763]  Now, here's what's coming up today.
[00:12:27.763 --> 00:12:29.745]  We've got Mike Cernovich in studio.
[00:12:29.745 --> 00:12:31.307]  We've got Posobiec joining us.
[00:12:31.307 --> 00:12:33.709]  We've got a bunch of other special guests joining us.
[00:12:33.709 --> 00:12:35.210]  We've got Steve Pucinich popping in.
[00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:36.631]  We've got Roger Stone.
[00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.794]  Everybody on the subject of the big Megyn Kelly interview.
[00:12:39.794 --> 00:12:40.494]  And quite frankly,
[00:12:41.545 --> 00:12:45.288]  I think I've only held my own against their deception and evil and corruption.
[00:12:45.288 --> 00:12:49.652]  Everybody's saying I'm this big genius, you know, I've destroyed them and then they're so discredited.
[00:12:49.652 --> 00:12:58.199]  She discredited herself, lying and saying it would be a puff piece, when obviously they said they're re-editing it to make it even worse.
[00:12:58.199 --> 00:13:06.747]  Hell, they already blew my head up on the camera and did all this other stuff, it's obvious, and lit me from below and edited things.
[00:13:06.747 --> 00:13:07.287]  But there's a...
[00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:36.660]  Graphic out there where I'm supposedly, you know playing Megan like a fiddle How to play MSM MSM plays itself if you just challenge it if you just speak up against it If you just say no to it, but right now this is from some of the audio I recorded like three weeks ago before Megan Kelly came here Where she just butters me up and then tells me she's you know, not gonna be mean and all this stuff and Then it was the most vicious interview I've ever been through
[00:13:38.157 --> 00:13:45.079]  And she just kept asking the same question until she thought she'd get another answer that somehow edited together.
[00:13:45.079 --> 00:13:46.939]  And I've got more of the phone conversations.
[00:13:46.939 --> 00:13:48.660]  It's just there's so much of it.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.180]  But I don't even want to release all this stuff.
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:59.022]  I've told NBC, on your website, just post the whole interview, the final interview of three you did that day, or I guess four, the 110 minute one or so, 105 minute.
[00:13:59.022 --> 00:14:06.404]  Just post that on ABC News or NBC News, on your website, so people can actually hear what I said instead of what you edited.
[00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:09.091]  And I won't release all the other hours.
[00:14:09.091 --> 00:14:13.334]  Most big news sites, when they do a big interview, do that to begin with.
[00:14:13.334 --> 00:14:15.996]  But see, they want to misrepresent what I said.
[00:14:15.996 --> 00:14:18.218]  They want to lie about what I've said.
[00:14:18.218 --> 00:14:24.622]  On Father's Day, to open up wounds and say, on Father's Day, Jones lost his shoulder in a custody battle.
[00:14:24.622 --> 00:14:25.523]  Not true.
[00:14:25.523 --> 00:14:28.705]  You know, Jones did all these horrible things and is evil.
[00:14:28.705 --> 00:14:31.707]  Jones, you know, says firefighters blew up the World Trade Center.
[00:14:31.707 --> 00:14:32.268]  Never said that.
[00:14:33.422 --> 00:14:34.883]  But that's how they misrepresent.
[00:14:34.883 --> 00:14:47.289]  If I say criminal elements of my government worked with the Saudis, were ordered to stand down, have had members of Congress on that have seen the documents, 28 pages, Walter Jones, you name it, they just misrepresent and say, Jones says firefighters blew the building.
[00:14:47.289 --> 00:14:49.990]  Jones says gays deserve to die at the Pulse nightclub.
[00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:55.773]  When I said the opposite, why are gays calling to bring in radical undead Muslims when they target them all over the world and kill them?
[00:14:55.773 --> 00:14:56.794]  It's the opposite!
[00:14:56.794 --> 00:14:59.215]  But she said, you said gays deserve to die.
[00:14:59.215 --> 00:15:00.135]  I said, no I didn't.
[00:15:00.135 --> 00:15:01.036]  She goes, yes you did!
[00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:04.142]  You said the kids deserve to die at Manchester.
[00:15:04.142 --> 00:15:04.963]  No, I didn't.
[00:15:04.963 --> 00:15:07.144]  It's just misrepresent, misrepresent.
[00:15:07.144 --> 00:15:08.685]  I know it's in the interview because I was there.
[00:15:08.685 --> 00:15:13.167]  And I told her, I said, I'm not recording.
[00:15:13.167 --> 00:15:15.228]  This will probably have me holding up my phone when I'm not recording it.
[00:15:15.228 --> 00:15:17.630]  But I went, but other people are.
[00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.691]  It's all going to be deception.
[00:15:19.691 --> 00:15:21.132]  And I warned her.
[00:15:21.132 --> 00:15:22.052]  I warned her in the middle of it.
[00:15:22.052 --> 00:15:24.053]  I said, you better watch out.
[00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:26.795]  Don't end up like Katie Couric, who edited video.
[00:15:26.795 --> 00:15:27.996]  But people said, got in a lot of trouble.
[00:15:28.916 --> 00:15:31.217]  Let's go out to break with Megan Kelly.
[00:15:31.217 --> 00:15:33.757]  Some of the excerpts from our phone conversation.
[00:15:33.757 --> 00:15:37.998]  All I can do is give you my word and tell you, if there's one thing about me, I do what I say I'm going to do.
[00:15:37.998 --> 00:15:39.538]  And I don't double cross.
[00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.459]  It's not going to be some gotcha hit piece.
[00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:42.559]  I promise you that.
[00:15:42.559 --> 00:15:44.740]  They call you the most paranoid man in America.
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.180]  Is that true?
[00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:50.161]  So it's like an investigative report into fake news?
[00:15:50.161 --> 00:15:50.761]  No.
[00:15:50.761 --> 00:15:51.121]  No.
[00:15:51.121 --> 00:15:52.121]  What we're doing?
[00:15:52.121 --> 00:15:53.642]  Yeah, come on.
[00:15:55.307 --> 00:15:55.848]  No, no, no, hell no.
[00:15:55.848 --> 00:15:59.071]  You know, you just became very fascinating to me.
[00:15:59.071 --> 00:16:00.772]  I just sort of thought you were this
[00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.571]  Maybe, you know, one dimensional guy.
[00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:22.732]  Like, this is your thing.
[00:16:22.732 --> 00:16:31.517]  My goal is for your listeners and the left, you know, who will be watching some on NBC to say, wow, that was really interesting.
[00:16:31.517 --> 00:16:34.699]  The media never covers all the evil wars it's promoted, all the big things.
[00:16:34.699 --> 00:16:37.220]  That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown.
[00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.061]  You know it.
[00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:39.061]  Here's the difference.
[00:16:39.061 --> 00:16:44.484]  I promise you when it's over, you'll say, absolutely, she did what she said she was going to do, and you'll be fine with it.
[00:16:44.484 --> 00:16:47.206]  I'm not looking to portray you as some boogeyman or
[00:16:48.134 --> 00:16:50.116]  You know, do any sort of a gotcha moment.
[00:16:50.116 --> 00:16:50.717]  Sandy Hooks.
[00:16:50.717 --> 00:16:50.877]  9-11.
[00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:52.740]  That'll be legal for me, I admit.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.161]  I just want to talk about you.
[00:16:54.161 --> 00:16:55.803]  I want people to get to know you.
[00:16:55.803 --> 00:17:03.733]  And the craziest thing of all would be if some of the people who have this, you know, insane version of you in their heads walk away saying, you know what?
[00:17:04.984 --> 00:17:06.485]  I see, like, the dad in him.
[00:17:06.485 --> 00:17:11.128]  I see the guy who loves those kids and who is more complex than I've been led to believe.
[00:17:11.128 --> 00:17:13.289]  We didn't get any of the really important stuff.
[00:17:13.289 --> 00:17:13.750]  What do you mean?
[00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.731]  We talked about all the important stuff.
[00:17:15.731 --> 00:17:21.474]  This is not going to be a contentious, you know, sort of gotcha exchange.
[00:17:21.474 --> 00:17:28.819]  If I didn't take the challenge, then good, or at least an open heart, would be hiding from evil.
[00:17:33.317 --> 00:17:36.199]  Mike Cernovich with his great team put that together from Cernovich Media.
[00:17:36.199 --> 00:17:37.300]  That's why I'm teaming up with him.
[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.361]  I love him.
[00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:39.022]  So much energy.
[00:17:39.022 --> 00:17:40.303]  We're right on the same wavelength.
[00:17:40.303 --> 00:17:42.184]  It's amazing.
[00:17:42.184 --> 00:17:44.246]  Powerful Jedi.
[00:17:44.246 --> 00:17:48.950]  And of course his video has 4 million views on one platform, 5 million on another, 9 million views.
[00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:51.952]  That's about half of what our whole show tonight will have.
[00:17:51.952 --> 00:17:53.673]  You see, just little videos like that.
[00:17:53.673 --> 00:17:54.474]  We're winning.
[00:17:54.474 --> 00:17:55.055]  They're losing.
[00:17:55.925 --> 00:17:56.706]  Embrics Essentials.
[00:17:56.706 --> 00:17:57.847]  That's my middle name.
[00:17:57.847 --> 00:18:10.282]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic high quality.
[00:18:10.282 --> 00:18:16.069]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out
[00:18:16.229 --> 00:18:19.433]  High-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[00:18:19.433 --> 00:18:24.059]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:18:24.059 --> 00:18:31.188]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:32.350]  It's all there.
[00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.031]  The Body Wash.
[00:18:33.311 --> 00:18:34.351]  We're good to go.
[00:18:55.956 --> 00:19:03.420]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality InfoWars Biome Defense Probiotic.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:16.646]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[00:19:17.566 --> 00:19:29.476]  Biome Defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[00:19:29.476 --> 00:19:35.421]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[00:19:36.181 --> 00:19:45.189]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at InfoWarsLife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[00:19:45.189 --> 00:19:53.397]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first run to the public, so please take advantage of it today, support your own health, and support the InfoWar.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.321]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:19:58.321 --> 00:20:00.343]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:20:00.343 --> 00:20:03.245]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:20:03.245 --> 00:20:09.309]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:15.514]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems.
[00:20:15.814 --> 00:20:18.475]  ...have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze.
[00:20:18.475 --> 00:20:26.018]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to do the best job you can to purify your air.
[00:20:26.018 --> 00:20:34.041]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:20:34.041 --> 00:20:35.021]  The general public doesn't.
[00:20:36.224 --> 00:20:39.608]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:20:39.608 --> 00:20:43.753]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:20:43.753 --> 00:20:50.461]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:20:50.461 --> 00:20:54.546]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:20:56.633 --> 00:21:02.036]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling Super Blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:21:02.036 --> 00:21:04.878]  The first shipment of Super Blue sold out in one week.
[00:21:04.878 --> 00:21:06.859]  I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners.
[00:21:06.859 --> 00:21:11.881]  And since then, people are beating down our doors, wanting to be able to resupply their Super Blue.
[00:21:11.881 --> 00:21:13.983]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:21:13.983 --> 00:21:15.263]  In fact, it's certified.
[00:21:15.263 --> 00:21:20.386]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:21:20.386 --> 00:21:23.748]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warrants.
[00:21:23.888 --> 00:21:27.270]  That your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.252]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:21:30.252 --> 00:21:33.954]  It's loaded with good halogen iodide instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:21:33.954 --> 00:21:40.858]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:21:40.858 --> 00:21:48.363]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more.
[00:21:48.363 --> 00:21:51.325]  Learn more about InfoWars Life Super Blue Toothpaste.
[00:21:51.485 --> 00:21:52.907]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:22:12.585 --> 00:22:22.213]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[00:22:22.213 --> 00:22:30.019]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:22:36.514 --> 00:22:52.847]  It's gonna be a jam-packed segment.
[00:22:52.847 --> 00:22:58.472]  Then I have former head of psychological operations, the CIA, State Department, you name it.
[00:22:58.472 --> 00:23:00.393]  Dr. Steve McChinnick popping in.
[00:23:00.393 --> 00:23:03.776]  He believes, like a lot of law enforcement, I know, that CNN was completely synthetic.
[00:23:06.334 --> 00:23:14.298]  My intel is that I've seen the parents and it looks real to me and I can't prove something 100% I'm not going to go there.
[00:23:14.298 --> 00:23:15.559]  We know governments have staged things.
[00:23:15.559 --> 00:23:16.919]  You have a right to question it.
[00:23:16.919 --> 00:23:20.441]  They have misrepresented me in the media for years that I'm the creator of all this.
[00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:23.563]  They say in the news every day that I'm bullying families and sending people to their houses.
[00:23:23.563 --> 00:23:25.924]  What I've been saying for years, don't do that.
[00:23:25.924 --> 00:23:29.686]  So I have to come out and not let the media misrepresent where I'm at and where I stand.
[00:23:29.686 --> 00:23:31.707]  But you have a total right to question Sandy Hook.
[00:23:32.517 --> 00:23:38.423]  You know, I'm tempted to make a documentary about it, just from my own hellish experience.
[00:23:38.423 --> 00:23:40.546]  It's like the babies in the incubators.
[00:23:40.546 --> 00:23:44.891]  I mean, they said a hundred of them got their brains bashed out, you know, everything.
[00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:46.652]  None of it was true.
[00:23:46.652 --> 00:23:51.578]  I remember hearing that when I was in high school and thinking, man, I hope we nuke the Iraqis or whatever.
[00:23:53.069 --> 00:23:54.970]  And it was, none of it was true!
[00:23:54.970 --> 00:24:19.577]  So, there's so many cases of that, and then when Madeleine Albright says, yeah, half a million kids died, big deal, it was good, when Clinton tripled the sanctions, he thought Bush was bad, tripled the sanctions of Bush 41, onto the children, and she said a half million's a good price to pay, I mean, I can play the clip if you want, it's well known, with Leslie Stahl, and she made similar statements, so the cold-bloodedness of a half million kids, oh yeah, it's no big deal, but then,
[00:24:20.851 --> 00:24:29.038]  We question governments like this, that are this cold-blooded, that just turned the whole Middle East over to the Islamists?
[00:24:29.038 --> 00:24:33.882]  And it's like, oh my gosh, you hate families here, but I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:24:33.882 --> 00:24:36.605]  And then they go, oh, Jones is running from this.
[00:24:37.569 --> 00:24:44.453]  No, I've been saying since it happened, I don't know if the official story was true or not, and now if you can't prove it one way or the other, there's some anomalies.
[00:24:44.453 --> 00:25:00.263]  But the parents look pretty legitimate to me, and I feel sorry for them as a parent myself, that I've got to sit here and say, okay, well then, you know, mass shootings happen, they've planed out, they're getting rarer since the 90s, don't blame gun owners, don't project that onto other parents that have guns to protect themselves.
[00:25:00.263 --> 00:25:04.686]  Just like if somebody runs over somebody in a car, if ISIS kills somebody in a truck, do you blame
[00:25:07.449 --> 00:25:08.350]  Ford?
[00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.692]  Do you blame Mercedes?
[00:25:11.692 --> 00:25:25.784]  So, again, ladies and gentlemen, the same liberal media that tells us if three Palestinian men stab an Israeli policewoman to death, and then the police shoot those three men, the BBC headline was, Israelis kill three Palestinians.
[00:25:28.151 --> 00:25:30.953]  And then a footnote later after they stabbed a woman to death.
[00:25:30.953 --> 00:25:34.416]  And I'm not even against the Palestinians or anybody.
[00:25:34.416 --> 00:25:36.397]  I just don't like lying like that.
[00:25:36.397 --> 00:25:39.640]  This media that says, kill Trump everywhere, murder Trump everywhere.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:45.344]  And then they're hyping congressmen being shot and conservatives being killed.
[00:25:45.344 --> 00:25:49.567]  And then when it actually starts happening, they say, well, okay, it's just politics.
[00:25:49.567 --> 00:25:51.368]  That's what Blitzer had a guest on about.
[00:25:51.368 --> 00:25:52.909]  Killing people's, you know, okay.
[00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:57.493]  But then, oh my gosh, I question an official story why I'm the worst man on earth.
[00:26:00.199 --> 00:26:23.147]  By the way, Jack Posobiec and others are going to be joining us that were there and were part of the Central Park event where they have American flags, a guy dressed up like Trump, clearly the president, they admit it's the president in simulation, then they murder him, and then they have the nerve to go, oh, it's a 500-year-old play from the most famous playwright, William Shakespeare.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.561]  You people don't even know what you're talking about.
[00:26:26.561 --> 00:26:27.542]  Clearly, it's Trump.
[00:26:27.542 --> 00:26:29.283]  But what about Madonna saying, blow up the White House?
[00:26:29.283 --> 00:26:32.886]  And all this, it's all over the news saying, kill Trump and his supporters.
[00:26:32.886 --> 00:26:36.910]  But then they play this mind game where they go, oh no, we're not talking about Trump.
[00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.571]  You're crazy, you made it up.
[00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:50.881]  I saw newspapers when I tweeted this, Friday night, when it happened, in Central Park, because I was in contact with the activists right up until the time it happened.
[00:26:52.998 --> 00:26:56.441]  And they were like, look at Jones, doesn't even know what a Shakespeare play is.
[00:26:56.441 --> 00:26:58.202]  It doesn't do with Trump.
[00:26:58.202 --> 00:26:59.263]  That's Julius Caesar.
[00:26:59.263 --> 00:27:11.472]  Yeah, the simulated murder of a king or a leader dressed up like Trump with American flags in a congressional setting, like they're killing him in the US Senate, just like they did 2000 plus years ago in Rome.
[00:27:12.875 --> 00:27:18.677]  But again, the left plays these games and goes, conspiracy theorist Jones claims this is Trump.
[00:27:18.677 --> 00:27:21.577]  And they go, yeah, that's his wild imagination.
[00:27:21.577 --> 00:27:23.258]  See, they control reality.
[00:27:23.258 --> 00:27:25.519]  They're going to simulate killing Trump in front of you.
[00:27:25.519 --> 00:27:27.759]  They're going to chant kill Trump at the events.
[00:27:27.759 --> 00:27:31.100]  They're going to admit they're doing it.
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:36.422]  But then they're going to tell you it didn't exist.
[00:27:36.422 --> 00:27:37.422]  Those videos are coming up.
[00:27:40.387 --> 00:27:57.921]  But first, I want to play you Brian Stelter, and I don't mean to make fun of his appearance, but you, we've all seen like a three-year-old or a five-year-old try to act like they're tough or like they're a man when they bow up and, you know, act like they're in charge, and your three-year-old son, you know, decides he's the boss one day and goes, no daddy, I'm the boss, and walks over and kicks you in the chin.
[00:27:57.921 --> 00:27:59.783]  It's like this humpty-dumpty wimp.
[00:28:00.708 --> 00:28:08.855]  Who always sits up there with this real authoritative saying that he's a big man like Tom Brokaw and all of them acting like they're big tough men.
[00:28:08.855 --> 00:28:11.557]  I am so sick of it.
[00:28:11.557 --> 00:28:16.681]  Tom Brokaw says I'm a quote total racist and then shows no proof.
[00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:18.402]  You're the fake news.
[00:28:18.402 --> 00:28:22.546]  You people are desperate and you think destroying me will help you.
[00:28:22.546 --> 00:28:24.668]  We've never had ratings this high in the summer.
[00:28:25.188 --> 00:28:29.694]  This is the second highest ratings we've ever had since the election on election week.
[00:28:29.694 --> 00:28:31.716]  We've never had more financial support.
[00:28:31.716 --> 00:28:33.839]  We've never had more affiliates.
[00:28:33.839 --> 00:28:43.491]  We've never had more... I went down to meet Cernovich at the big hotel downtown for breakfast this morning and I couldn't pay for my own valet.
[00:28:44.554 --> 00:28:52.840]  Parked it right up front, high-fiving white men, black men, old women, you name it, Indians running over, saying, Trump, he's battling Islam!
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.801]  I was like, yeah!
[00:28:53.801 --> 00:28:55.922]  I was just mobbed, whoa, yeah, oh yeah!
[00:28:55.922 --> 00:28:58.444]  I mean, I should go down there and just show you a video of it.
[00:28:58.444 --> 00:28:59.986]  Boy, I'm sure having a bad time!
[00:28:59.986 --> 00:29:02.087]  Ooh, high-five, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[00:29:02.087 --> 00:29:09.653]  The enemy media that's lied to everybody over and over again is now saying I am the devil.
[00:29:09.653 --> 00:29:11.074]  They have a talking point on the play when we come back.
[00:29:12.617 --> 00:29:20.387]  On CNN, on Fox, on MSNBC, on all the channels saying, no one should interview him, he's pure evil, and they'll cut to the next guest.
[00:29:20.387 --> 00:29:21.509]  Now I'm more liberal.
[00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:29.700]  I say, you know, we interview child molesters and murderers, and dictators, so, you know, he's worse than them, but he's... and then...
[00:29:31.081 --> 00:29:35.383]  Stilted, Brian Stilted says of CNN, he says, but Jones is viral.
[00:29:35.383 --> 00:29:37.904]  He's dangerous.
[00:29:37.904 --> 00:29:39.725]  That's right, isn't it?
[00:29:39.725 --> 00:29:40.286]  It's true.
[00:29:40.286 --> 00:29:41.606]  Because you do look like Humpty Dumpty.
[00:29:41.606 --> 00:29:43.367]  You do look like a three-year-old acting tough.
[00:29:43.367 --> 00:29:45.768]  You are a big fat lying joke.
[00:29:45.768 --> 00:29:49.991]  You have little peg teeth that are like, you know, on a pig's mouth or something, like a little pig toy.
[00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:53.913]  I mean, I'm sorry, you're a joke.
[00:29:53.913 --> 00:29:59.155]  You actually think you're manly and powerful and smart reading off teleprompters.
[00:29:59.155 --> 00:29:59.575]  You're a fool.
[00:30:01.852 --> 00:30:09.333]  But you are who CNN thinks is impressive and who CNN thinks will get the word out and how great this is all going to be.
[00:30:09.333 --> 00:30:09.815]  It's amazing.
[00:30:11.056 --> 00:30:34.217]  MSM is collapsing, but during the Trump Revolution the last eight months it's gone up a little bit from its all-time low because it's interesting again to tune in because we really have a real president that's cut taxes or is moving to do that by cutting the regulations that has cut taxes and who is trying to get more jobs back in the country and killing Obamacare and killing the TPP and killing the carbon tax that only we have to pay.
[00:30:34.978 --> 00:30:42.464]  And so I know you're mad there's 3 trillion in the stock market and there's hope again in jobs and I know you're upset that, you know, some of the illegal aliens and jihadists can't get in.
[00:30:42.464 --> 00:30:48.588]  But the good news is the globalists are upset because Trump really is trying to be president.
[00:30:48.588 --> 00:30:50.190]  We're going to come back with all the clips.
[00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.710]  Stay with us.
[00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:51.290]  Spread the word.
[00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:54.293]  We're live countering the MSM lie machine.
[00:30:55.939 --> 00:31:02.446]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[00:31:02.446 --> 00:31:15.239]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[00:31:15.439 --> 00:31:19.101]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[00:31:19.101 --> 00:31:26.064]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[00:31:26.064 --> 00:31:38.950]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:40.491]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[00:31:40.771 --> 00:31:47.178]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[00:31:47.178 --> 00:31:52.123]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.

[00:32:46.127 --> 00:32:53.655]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:09.333]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:12.198]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[00:33:12.198 --> 00:33:13.680]  It's made in the USA.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:20.531]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:21.753]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[00:33:22.594 --> 00:33:32.301]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:49.113]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[00:34:05.524 --> 00:34:13.629]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:18.791]  We have now managed to secure these sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.
[00:34:18.791 --> 00:34:25.593]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee at Infowarslife.com.
[00:34:25.593 --> 00:34:32.756]  This coffee gives you a long, smooth pick-me-up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[00:34:32.756 --> 00:34:39.618]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:34:39.778 --> 00:34:44.260]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:34:53.944 --> 00:35:00.447]  Available at Infowarslife.com.
[00:35:00.447 --> 00:35:03.088]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:10.416 --> 00:35:17.279]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:35:17.279 --> 00:35:19.460]  The war was lost.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:21.681]  The treaty signed.
[00:35:21.681 --> 00:35:22.821]  But was not cut.
[00:35:22.821 --> 00:35:24.702]  This segment should not air on NBC.
[00:35:24.702 --> 00:35:24.902]  Why?
[00:35:27.168 --> 00:35:30.469]  Well, I think that covering people like Alex Jones is important.
[00:35:30.469 --> 00:35:31.909]  I should make that clear at the outset.
[00:35:31.909 --> 00:35:38.452]  I think that the rise of these people who foment hate and spew lies is important to our culture.
[00:35:38.452 --> 00:35:41.212]  It's obviously tapping into something that's happening in America.
[00:35:41.212 --> 00:35:45.974]  I just think the context in which this coverage takes place is really important.
[00:35:46.634 --> 00:35:58.921]  And if you were to tell me that NBC were doing an hour-long white paper, so to speak, or an hour-long documentary on the rise of this kind of disinformation media empires, I would say that's great.
[00:35:58.921 --> 00:36:08.586]  You know, we should definitely take a hard look at that and what has brought it about and what has made it such a really scary part of the media landscape.
[00:36:08.586 --> 00:36:12.828]  These are really important things to cover and some people are doing a great job of getting out there and covering it.
[00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:23.510]  I don't think giving Alex Jones 15 or 16 minutes to simply spin his views and to spin his media image is the way in which to attack this.
[00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:34.133]  And as I wrote the other day, Megyn Kelly has not proven herself to be the kind of dog interviewer that would be able to make a meal of this.
[00:36:34.133 --> 00:36:35.533]  I just don't see it.
[00:36:35.533 --> 00:36:41.335]  That's interesting that maybe she is not the right person to be in this position interviewing this conspiracy theorist.
[00:36:41.335 --> 00:36:42.615]  Charlie, what do you say on that?
[00:36:43.399 --> 00:36:49.986]  I think that there's a good case to be made that that's true, especially from what we've seen in the lead up to all of this.
[00:36:52.188 --> 00:36:59.232]  There's this sort of dangerous argument right now that there should be, you know, people on a list that can't be given a platform.
[00:36:59.232 --> 00:37:03.734]  And I think that that is part of sort of an old media argument that sort of... Cover your ears!
[00:37:03.734 --> 00:37:04.275]  Don't hear it!
[00:37:04.275 --> 00:37:04.595]  Don't listen!
[00:37:04.595 --> 00:37:09.377]  ...suggests that the media are gatekeepers and sort of, you know, have to vet who people can see.
[00:37:09.377 --> 00:37:14.040]  And I think that ignores the fact that Alex Jones has a huge platform and he's very...
[00:37:15.268 --> 00:37:25.554]  And there's this whole thing happening online and over his terrestrial radio stations that, you know, we need to talk about as a country and normal people need to know about.
[00:37:25.554 --> 00:37:29.797]  That's exactly what Kelly and her boss, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, said to me a few days ago.
[00:37:29.797 --> 00:37:34.280]  They said, hey, terrorists and child molesters and serial killers have been interviewed on television.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.483]  What's different about this, about this hate monger, this conspiracy theorist?
[00:37:38.483 --> 00:37:43.806]  I wonder if what's different, Charlie, is that the country feels very anxious right now, obviously very divided.
[00:37:46.781 --> 00:37:52.503]  There's maybe a fear of spreading that virus more fully on a big network like the National Broadcasting Company.
[00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:59.205]  And I think that's sort of where Mo and I are kind of agreeing on our arguments, which is that there's a way to interview him.
[00:37:59.205 --> 00:38:06.848]  And there's a way to be just, you know, very intense and to really take him to task and to go at it.
[00:38:06.848 --> 00:38:07.508]  And hey, we don't know.
[00:38:07.508 --> 00:38:08.729]  We haven't seen the full interview yet.
[00:38:08.729 --> 00:38:09.089]  Exactly.
[00:38:09.309 --> 00:38:16.274]  I suspect that if there had been that moment, that stunning moment, that NBC would have released it as a preview, but we don't know.
[00:38:16.274 --> 00:38:18.555]  We have to see the full interview.
[00:38:18.555 --> 00:38:23.598]  All right, for this segment and the next, and for Riding Shotgun in the next few hours, Mike Cernovich is here.
[00:38:23.598 --> 00:38:30.443]  We've got, of course, Dr. Steve Pachinick, who's worked with the CIA, State Department, best-selling author, researcher, helped with the Camp David Accords, you name it.
[00:38:30.443 --> 00:38:32.244]  That's what the president is this weekend.
[00:38:32.244 --> 00:38:34.325]  As an introduction, I wanted to get his take on this.
[00:38:34.325 --> 00:38:35.106]  He's a smart guy.
[00:38:35.106 --> 00:38:35.887]  He doesn't buy into
[00:38:36.887 --> 00:38:39.530]  Uh, what happened, uh, reportedly there in Newtown.
[00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:43.915]  I personally can't prove one or the other, so I'm just gonna say, heart goes out to the families, and I believe it happened.
[00:38:43.915 --> 00:38:46.618]  Taking the American people's guns won't make us safe.
[00:38:46.618 --> 00:38:49.782]  You know, letting jihadis in to do it won't keep us safe.
[00:38:49.782 --> 00:38:50.543]  Uh, you know, doing all this.
[00:38:50.543 --> 00:38:51.744]  But that's a separate issue.
[00:38:51.744 --> 00:38:52.184]  They are...
[00:38:53.356 --> 00:38:55.617]  They're caught red-handed lying about this interview.
[00:38:55.617 --> 00:38:59.299]  We have the tape of her saying it wouldn't be on these subjects.
[00:38:59.299 --> 00:39:02.120]  Even MSN admits she's been very, very disingenuous.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:04.661]  They said they're re-editing it to make it even more vicious.
[00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:07.122]  She's called me despicable, all these horrible names.
[00:39:07.122 --> 00:39:10.344]  Well, she's totally duplicitous then because she's on the phone
[00:39:11.244 --> 00:39:12.565]  You're basically coming on to me.
[00:39:12.565 --> 00:39:18.891]  I mean, she is like pouring it on like she was trying to sell me a timeshare or trying to get me to buy a lap dance.
[00:39:18.891 --> 00:39:20.152]  I mean, whatever it was.
[00:39:20.152 --> 00:39:25.137]  So, Dr. Steven Shinnick, why is the MSM so hysterical for two weeks?
[00:39:25.137 --> 00:39:27.799]  Because I don't even want InfoWars to be the top story.
[00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:32.123]  You know, it's kind of creepy at a level, but it also makes me think, why are they so weak?
[00:39:32.123 --> 00:39:33.885]  What are they flipping out about?
[00:39:33.885 --> 00:39:36.307]  And then, is it true what a lot of people are saying that
[00:39:36.927 --> 00:39:40.610]  Alex, I have been waiting 14 years for somebody stupid enough to come in and try to manipulate
[00:39:52.126 --> 00:39:52.226]  Hey,
[00:40:14.482 --> 00:40:17.004]  They don't understand it, they don't get it.
[00:40:17.004 --> 00:40:19.486]  Mainstream media never understood it.
[00:40:19.486 --> 00:40:28.872]  They thought that they could pander to an individual, that's their standard operating procedure, and then they could literally pholate them verbally, almost what she did.
[00:40:28.872 --> 00:40:38.439]  You know, you're great, you're wonderful, I want to get to know you, and I want to be able to show you in the full extent of who you are.
[00:40:39.259 --> 00:40:40.621]  Absurd.
[00:40:40.621 --> 00:40:50.411]  At the same time, she had no idea that you were that capable, that clever, and also you had become a master of psyops.
[00:40:50.411 --> 00:40:53.073]  This is not just a hobby for you.
[00:40:53.073 --> 00:40:55.296]  You are a master of letting her come in,
[00:40:55.936 --> 00:41:13.719]  You allowed her to keep talking, you never revealed your hand, then you controlled the dialogue even though she felt she was in control and because of her narcissism, because she felt she was in control of anything when she was in control of nothing, she felt she could
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:14.840]  Yeah.
[00:41:33.462 --> 00:41:35.263]  I've worked with NBC in the past.
[00:41:35.263 --> 00:41:41.906]  Les Moonvest, I knew about Zucker, Bob Greenblatt is now head of this station.
[00:41:41.906 --> 00:41:43.867]  He should be fired.
[00:41:43.867 --> 00:41:45.467]  $15 million should be thrown out.
[00:41:45.467 --> 00:41:47.008]  She should be fired.
[00:41:47.008 --> 00:42:01.655]  If I were Comcast, I would fire the entire NBC Entertainment staff for the stupidity that they under- Okay, but I don't want to put too good a face on this because she did interview me for two hours in a hot box and I didn't be able to edit together and I look like hell, but still, why are the execs
[00:42:02.375 --> 00:42:02.635]  Calling
[00:42:17.312 --> 00:42:18.393]  I don't care about their kids.
[00:42:44.993 --> 00:43:04.300]  The truth of the matter is, number one, they never took the time, they being either Megyn Kelly, Greenblatt, or anybody in the NBC network, to study who Alex Jones was, to understand his modus operandi, to understand how many people he had on the staff, to understand what issues he picks and which issues he doesn't pick.
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.801]  I've always known one thing about Alex Jones.
[00:43:07.801 --> 00:43:10.462]  He is capable of being sarcastic.
[00:43:10.462 --> 00:43:12.683]  He is capable of telling the truth.
[00:43:12.683 --> 00:43:16.044]  He's capable of combining fiction with fact.
[00:43:16.044 --> 00:43:21.786]  But you have to be able to titrate the fact in order to address the issue.
[00:43:21.786 --> 00:43:23.967]  They have none of those capabilities.
[00:43:23.967 --> 00:43:28.449]  What I'm saying to you today is not that it was just a grand victory on your part.
[00:43:28.909 --> 00:43:31.911]  It was a major defeat on the part of NBC.
[00:43:49.124 --> 00:43:50.385]  Standard format.
[00:43:50.385 --> 00:43:51.445]  It didn't work.
[00:43:51.445 --> 00:43:52.906]  It didn't work for 9-11.
[00:43:52.906 --> 00:43:55.947]  It didn't work for the past 14 or 15 years.
[00:43:55.947 --> 00:44:00.929]  But I happen to have been lucky enough to find an Alex Jones and he in turn found me.
[00:44:00.929 --> 00:44:06.511]  And what happened is we've created, along with others, what's called the alternative media.
[00:44:06.511 --> 00:44:10.253]  The only thing the mainstream media can talk about is that we're racist.
[00:44:10.253 --> 00:44:11.273]  We're not.
[00:44:11.273 --> 00:44:15.295]  That we're, you know, we're propagating hate, which we're not.
[00:44:15.715 --> 00:44:24.759]  We're propagating war, which we haven't, which we've uncovered conspiracies, which are in fact conspiracies, because I work in the intelligence community.
[00:44:24.759 --> 00:44:27.480]  I'm still working with the intelligence community.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:41.586]  They can't deny it, yet not one of their individuals, not one of their sycophants, could come up and say intelligently, how does this monitor what happens in the intelligence world, in the world of military operations,
[00:44:42.006 --> 00:44:42.967]  In the world of comedy.
[00:44:56.052 --> 00:45:05.018]  Following the liberal outcry over Megyn Kelly interviewing Alex Jones, NBC News executives have been scrambling to further edit their hit piece on Alex Jones.
[00:45:05.018 --> 00:45:17.047]  The word now is that Megyn Kelly has changed her Sunday night show featuring Alex Jones' interview by inviting Sandy Hook families on to play edited clips of Alex talking while they have the parents emotionally respond.
[00:45:17.367 --> 00:45:29.275]  One thing is for sure, with how long it's taking NBC to edit Megyn Kelly's interview with Alex Jones prior to just airing it, we can expect that they will be misrepresenting his statements with skilled editing techniques.
[00:45:29.275 --> 00:45:34.418]  Why not just release the entire interview unedited and prove you're not fake news, NBC?
[00:45:34.418 --> 00:45:43.264]  They'd like you to believe that Alex Jones, not Adam Lanza, is the real bad guy in the Sandy Hook massacre because he said he believes there was a government conspiracy at work.
[00:45:43.484 --> 00:45:53.350]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media, as everyday Americans are increasingly becoming more aware of the staging, faking, and lying that is the mainstream media.
[00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.351]  For more reports, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:45:59.714 --> 00:46:10.140]  Off and on, trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic, high-quality.
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:19.286]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out high-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[00:46:19.286 --> 00:46:23.928]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[00:46:23.928 --> 00:46:26.330]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman,
[00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:31.032]  20% off retail, sign up for auto ship, an additional 25% off.
[00:46:31.032 --> 00:46:32.173]  It's all there.
[00:46:32.173 --> 00:46:37.615]  The body wash, the shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[00:46:37.615 --> 00:46:48.361]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emmerich's Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:46:48.361 --> 00:46:50.962]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[00:46:50.962 --> 00:46:55.024]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emmerich's Essentials.
[00:46:56.638 --> 00:46:58.519]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[00:46:58.519 --> 00:47:00.560]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.442]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[00:47:03.442 --> 00:47:09.526]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[00:47:09.526 --> 00:47:18.711]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[00:47:18.711 --> 00:47:21.993]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,

[00:47:26.237 --> 00:47:34.265]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[00:47:34.265 --> 00:47:35.246]  The general public doesn't.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.822]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[00:47:39.822 --> 00:47:43.965]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[00:47:43.965 --> 00:47:50.668]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[00:47:50.668 --> 00:47:54.771]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWareStore.com.

[00:48:59.898 --> 00:49:02.519]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:16.207 --> 00:49:19.488]  Relentlessly attacking the power structure.
[00:49:19.488 --> 00:49:22.829]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:49:22.829 --> 00:49:27.531]  Relentlessly trying to get my butt in trouble, I'll tell you that.
[00:49:27.531 --> 00:49:29.431]  We could all sit around joking about this.
[00:49:29.431 --> 00:49:32.672]  I mean, we walked in a restaurant today, everybody was looking.
[00:49:32.672 --> 00:49:36.494]  It was like, it's a job we gotta do.
[00:49:36.494 --> 00:49:40.415]  Like, cause they're saying I'm the devil, but the thing is, most of the public isn't buying it.
[00:49:41.735 --> 00:49:42.216]  It's crazy.
[00:49:42.216 --> 00:49:51.122]  I want to ask Dr. Pachinik in closing, and he can come back later in the week for longer, I appreciate him joining us, about where he sees this going, but we should tell folks we're 47 minutes into this live transmission.
[00:49:51.122 --> 00:49:53.604]  We're going for four hours, about an hour and 15 minutes.
[00:49:53.604 --> 00:49:55.025]  Kelly's show starts.
[00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:56.045]  I think they'll tentpole it.
[00:49:56.045 --> 00:49:59.428]  I think the middle of the broadcast will be the demonization piece.
[00:49:59.428 --> 00:50:00.389]  It's only 11 minutes long.
[00:50:01.485 --> 00:50:08.650]  Then we'll analyze it, and then I'm going to decide which parts of the audio I'm going to release, because mainly I think I'm going to take the clips where they lie, but that's some work.
[00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:14.995]  You've got to then go find the places where they cut the two pieces together to show what they did, which we saw that they did in the promo.
[00:50:14.995 --> 00:50:28.985]  So Mike Cernovich, how important is it for listeners and viewers to be part of the info war right now on Facebook, on Google, on Twitter, to share the live video feeds on Facebook, on Twitter, and create a Twitter storm with the hashtag you came up with?
[00:50:29.585 --> 00:50:34.530]  Yeah, so the hashtag of the day is Jones v. Kelly because this is the big heavyweight fight.
[00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:38.273]  As the great guest noted, NBC did not know what they were getting into.
[00:50:38.273 --> 00:50:39.614]  This is the Super Bowl of media.
[00:50:39.614 --> 00:50:44.819]  Everybody that I've heard from in media go, this is like, everybody wanted to watch Pelley vs. Cernovich.
[00:50:44.819 --> 00:50:47.901]  Now everybody wants to watch Jones vs. Kelly.
[00:50:47.901 --> 00:50:49.663]  It is a fight, and it's a fight for your survival.
[00:50:49.663 --> 00:50:51.905]  I was just telling them to move the camera over more on you, that's all I was doing.
[00:50:52.085 --> 00:50:53.486]  I'm giving secret hand signals.
[00:50:53.486 --> 00:50:55.268]  We don't have teleprompters, but I give hand signals.
[00:50:55.268 --> 00:50:56.609]  I was trying to move the camera more that way.
[00:50:56.609 --> 00:50:57.430]  Go ahead, sorry.
[00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.891]  Exactly.
[00:50:57.891 --> 00:51:00.033]  So, Jones v. Kelly is the hashtag.
[00:51:00.033 --> 00:51:00.773]  Share it live.
[00:51:00.773 --> 00:51:03.035]  This is going to be a historic moment and unprecedented.
[00:51:03.035 --> 00:51:03.916]  Why?
[00:51:03.916 --> 00:51:06.379]  We will be live reacting.
[00:51:06.379 --> 00:51:09.381]  I got this idea, actually, because Joe Rogan does those fight companions.
[00:51:09.381 --> 00:51:12.765]  And, you know, four or five guys will watch the fight, and they'll just kind of hang out.
[00:51:12.765 --> 00:51:14.506]  And people love that kind of stuff.
[00:51:14.506 --> 00:51:15.627]  And I go, why don't we do that?
[00:51:16.348 --> 00:51:17.389]  Why don't we do that?
[00:51:17.389 --> 00:51:18.249]  We live-react.
[00:51:18.249 --> 00:51:23.713]  Why don't we maybe open a bottle of wine, relax, get a big panel in, and we... Well, I did buy a bottle of champagne.
[00:51:23.713 --> 00:51:28.436]  I'm not a big drinker, but I bought a bottle of champagne, and I'll let you guys decide.
[00:51:28.436 --> 00:51:33.779]  If we think that it blew up in her face, which is going to be horribly edited, then we'll have the champagne.
[00:51:33.779 --> 00:51:43.845]  It's going to be horribly edited, but again, the message is, for example, you issued that wonderful, heartfelt Father's Day message to the family of the Newtown family.
[00:51:43.845 --> 00:51:44.706]  That we're going to play next hour.
[00:51:45.146 --> 00:51:48.549]  And the left-wing media is already saying that that was callous of you to do it.
[00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:52.091]  So those people can never be reached and are never going to be happy.
[00:51:52.091 --> 00:51:55.834]  But the Patriots in America, so we were in Austin, which is actually a liberal town.
[00:51:55.834 --> 00:51:58.976]  We went to breakfast this morning and everybody's smiling.
[00:51:58.976 --> 00:52:00.497]  Alex, I'm a big fan.
[00:52:00.497 --> 00:52:05.581]  Somebody who worked in the kitchen actually told his wife, who was one of the waitresses there, go tell Alex, go say hi.
[00:52:05.581 --> 00:52:07.563]  Oh my God, we're so excited for Megyn Kelly.
[00:52:07.563 --> 00:52:10.725]  Now, my belief, here's the bigger thing.
[00:52:10.725 --> 00:52:11.906]  I don't care about the editing thing.
[00:52:12.586 --> 00:52:20.481]  I feel like Megyn Kelly used you and that you are legitimizing her by giving her an audience that she doesn't deserve.
[00:52:20.481 --> 00:52:21.863]  How do you answer that accusation, Alex?
[00:52:23.066 --> 00:52:24.347]  Well, come on.
[00:52:24.347 --> 00:52:28.830]  I'm just an archetype of the alternative emerging media and the fall of the dinosaurs.
[00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:30.931]  But certainly, her show was tanking.
[00:52:30.931 --> 00:52:32.752]  Even Putin wouldn't get the ratings up.
[00:52:32.752 --> 00:52:37.575]  So they thought they had this huge event, demonized me in the process, say things I didn't say out of context.
[00:52:37.575 --> 00:52:39.857]  She was meeting with the Newtown people the whole time.
[00:52:39.857 --> 00:52:41.038]  We checked her tweets.
[00:52:41.038 --> 00:52:42.679]  They were always going to be on the show.
[00:52:42.679 --> 00:52:44.700]  She is so disingenuous.
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:47.362]  I can't believe she thought that we were this dumb.
[00:52:47.362 --> 00:52:49.623]  Really, the story is not how smart we are.
[00:52:49.623 --> 00:52:50.784]  It's how dumb they are.
[00:52:50.784 --> 00:52:52.345]  But it's almost scary, Dr. Pachinik.
[00:52:52.725 --> 00:52:53.746]  I think what Mike said is correct.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:10.344]  This is the moment that we have looked for besides Hillary Clinton's demise.
[00:53:10.344 --> 00:53:14.807]  And this is coming now into the demise pretty much of NBC.
[00:53:14.807 --> 00:53:23.013]  I think, although Mike has a point that you may have increased the ratings for Megyn Kelly, the reality is Megyn Kelly is finished.
[00:53:23.013 --> 00:53:25.374]  So is Bob Greenblatt, so is Comcast.
[00:53:25.374 --> 00:53:29.437]  There will be a lot of traders like me tomorrow on the stock market.
[00:53:29.437 --> 00:53:31.799]  Shorting Comcast will be shorting GE.
[00:53:32.539 --> 00:53:38.641]  We'll be shorting a lot of the companies that are involved in this type of major entertainment, including Disney.
[00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:45.282]  So what you're doing is, without realizing, you're affecting the stock markets and the value of these companies.
[00:53:45.282 --> 00:53:49.623]  If I were the CEO of Comcast, I would immediately fire Greenblatt.
[00:53:49.623 --> 00:53:51.844]  I'd immediately fire Megyn Kelly.
[00:53:51.844 --> 00:53:57.265]  The issue of Sandy Hook is only relevant to people like me because we knew this was a false flag.
[00:53:57.785 --> 00:53:59.987]  I knew Eric Holder had lied.
[00:53:59.987 --> 00:54:04.750]  I knew he had given them what we call Project Longevity, $50 million.
[00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:08.052]  I knew that the building was empty, that it was asbestos.
[00:54:08.052 --> 00:54:13.996]  I knew Governor Dan Malloy, an Irish Catholic moron, had no idea how to run the state.
[00:54:13.996 --> 00:54:18.579]  And in fact, not only had he not run the state properly, he is now in bankruptcy.
[00:54:19.119 --> 00:54:27.684]  All the hedge fund owners, who I know a lot of them because I worked on Wall Street, left down to Miami thanks to Dan Malloy and Sandy Vo.
[00:54:27.684 --> 00:54:34.387]  So every one of these paid parents, whoever they may be, are totally, totally disingenuous.
[00:54:34.387 --> 00:54:35.548]  That's not your problem.
[00:54:36.148 --> 00:54:37.068]  Well, let me stop you.
[00:54:37.068 --> 00:54:39.049]  I know there's big charities involved and all the rest of it.
[00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:42.649]  The media, not the parents, are acting like I somehow did this.
[00:54:42.649 --> 00:54:45.470]  All I know is they've staged fake things before.
[00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:46.650]  I'm not even getting into this.
[00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:51.171]  They're hanging it around my neck, though, when the world didn't believe the media.
[00:54:51.171 --> 00:54:54.312]  The problem is the world didn't believe Obama and the media.
[00:54:54.312 --> 00:54:57.792]  That shows they don't have credibility because they've lied so much.
[00:54:57.792 --> 00:54:59.433]  That's their problem, not ours.
[00:54:59.433 --> 00:55:00.973]  And that's the real story here, too.
[00:55:01.613 --> 00:55:06.936]  Because I, for example, do believe that Sandy Hoka actually happened, more or less, as is reported.
[00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:20.145]  Now, whether or not the Saudis, the Soros, that somebody paid somebody to go in and kill the kids or whatever as part of their takeover, that could be who funded it, who funded that operation, just like the Saudis funded 9-11 and made that happen.
[00:55:20.145 --> 00:55:21.366]  9-11, I believe, happened also.
[00:55:22.066 --> 00:55:26.787]  But the bigger question is, why is it that so few people trust the news?
[00:55:26.787 --> 00:55:32.048]  Because the news is, they faked footage in the war in Iraq.
[00:55:32.048 --> 00:55:37.009]  They talked about the Kuwaiti, you know, the Iraqi soldiers throwing babies out of the incubator.
[00:55:37.009 --> 00:55:42.830]  So the real story here is that a lot of people don't believe what the news is reporting, even when it's a horrific tragedy.
[00:55:42.830 --> 00:55:43.150]  Exactly!
[00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:45.791]  Let me ask Plotkinnik this, because he's got to leave in a moment, but that's a great point.
[00:55:46.451 --> 00:55:52.433]  It's okay for us not to believe official events and question them, and then have our views change views, whatever.
[00:55:52.433 --> 00:55:58.495]  Since when is... I mean, as you heard earlier on CNN, that I'm worse than child molesters and killers.
[00:55:58.495 --> 00:56:03.456]  Tom Brokaw came up and said I am an unalloyed racist, that means complete racist, and then showed no proof.
[00:56:03.456 --> 00:56:04.617]  That's fake news!
[00:56:04.617 --> 00:56:11.899]  Since when do they say the FBI director, former director, never said that Trump said, you know, tried to stop the investigation?
[00:56:11.899 --> 00:56:14.020]  When we have the two videos of him saying it!
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:14.740]  They lie!
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.081]  Let me ask you that.
[00:56:16.081 --> 00:56:20.144]  Have you noticed or do you agree that their lying has actually intensified?
[00:56:20.144 --> 00:56:21.866]  What does that signify?
[00:56:21.866 --> 00:56:24.127]  Well, it's what I said for a long time.
[00:56:24.127 --> 00:56:25.789]  I happen to know Tom Brokaw.
[00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:27.070]  I was on his show.
[00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:29.131]  He's not the most competent interviewer.
[00:56:29.131 --> 00:56:32.074]  He's now an older man who lives in Montana.
[00:56:32.074 --> 00:56:38.479]  So what you're seeing is literally the end of a Tom Brokaw, the end of Dan Rather, the end of Megyn Kelly.
[00:56:38.479 --> 00:56:40.681]  It's what we've been talking about for a long time.
[00:56:41.141 --> 00:56:43.262]  The demise of Main Street Media.
[00:56:43.262 --> 00:56:47.963]  That doesn't mean that they have the protection of the First Amendment or any other amendment.
[00:56:47.963 --> 00:56:50.504]  That means that as a business, they are finished.
[00:56:50.504 --> 00:56:52.245]  The New York Times is finished.
[00:56:52.245 --> 00:56:54.185]  Washington Post is finished.
[00:56:54.185 --> 00:57:01.988]  Whether you agree or you don't agree, what happened was the New York Times never was able to delve into the issue of 9-11.
[00:57:01.988 --> 00:57:05.849]  It happens that I know it was a false flag because the guys involved
[00:57:06.149 --> 00:57:07.490]  We're responsible to me.
[00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:13.774]  So CIA had a reported and my military intelligence had a reported to me and several others.
[00:57:13.774 --> 00:57:16.436]  So that wasn't a conjecture whether you believe it or not.
[00:57:16.436 --> 00:57:21.359]  No, no, we know the attack happened, but there are obviously criminal elements working that we're working on.
[00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:25.862]  Yeah, but that's the broader point is that, um, you know, it's important to have these conversations.
[00:57:25.862 --> 00:57:34.308]  And with that's what the media loses sight of is they won't say, for example, Hey, Mike Cernovich believes Sandy Hook happened as described, but yet he'll talk to somebody who may be disagree.
[00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.509]  Yeah.
[00:57:36.509 --> 00:57:38.610]  I think Mike's point is correct.
[00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:40.331]  Mike has hit it right in the head.
[00:57:40.331 --> 00:57:41.891]  We don't have a dialogue.
[00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:48.453]  Within here, the three of us may not agree, but we've always been in concert in believing the right to disagree.
[00:57:48.453 --> 00:57:49.994]  Well, let's expand on that.
[00:57:49.994 --> 00:57:55.476]  Emblematic is last year when Cuomo, on a CNN show, said, I'm allowed to look at WikiLeaks.
[00:57:55.476 --> 00:57:55.976]  You can't.
[00:57:55.976 --> 00:57:57.397]  You'll be arrested if you do.
[00:57:57.397 --> 00:57:58.737]  I'll tell you what's in them.
[00:57:58.737 --> 00:57:59.938]  And then they wouldn't tell you.
[00:57:59.938 --> 00:58:01.278]  That is a joke there.
[00:58:01.278 --> 00:58:03.759]  Dr. Piccinini, closing comments, and thanks for joining us.
[00:58:04.099 --> 00:58:06.081]  Well, let me show you what's a greater joke.
[00:58:06.081 --> 00:58:10.685]  When I go on the internet, Google tells me what to say, what not to say.
[00:58:10.685 --> 00:58:13.768]  Then they tell me how much money I can or cannot make.
[00:58:13.768 --> 00:58:23.357]  I have warned the founders of Google, whom I know from Stanford, that if they continue this illicit practice, there will be anonymous retribution for this.
[00:58:23.357 --> 00:58:25.299]  You cannot control the media.
[00:58:25.299 --> 00:58:27.982]  They won't let me type cuss words on my iPhone!
[00:58:28.542 --> 00:58:29.903]  Well, it's not only that.
[00:58:29.903 --> 00:58:36.686]  They literally do not like, and they tell me outright, that I can't talk about political issues so I won't be reimbursed.
[00:58:36.686 --> 00:58:45.771]  So once you get into my pocket and you get into my thinking, this is where America identifies with me, with Mike, with Alex Jones, with Stone.
[00:58:45.771 --> 00:58:50.994]  You can't get into the business of manipulating our lives, our thoughts, and our money.
[00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:53.335]  Once you do that, it's irrelevant who you may be.
[00:58:53.335 --> 00:58:53.636]  That's right.
[00:58:53.636 --> 00:58:54.436]  Thank you, Dr. Machinic.
[00:58:54.436 --> 00:58:55.256]  Let's talk soon.
[00:58:55.256 --> 00:58:55.957]  Steve Machinic.com.
[00:58:57.264 --> 00:58:57.824]  Thank you.
[00:58:57.824 --> 00:59:05.690]  Yeah, so it is so interesting, too, because the idea that, you know, again, I believe Sandy Hook happened, right?
[00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:06.470]  He doesn't.
[00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:07.391]  It's OK.
[00:59:07.391 --> 00:59:08.491]  We can still talk.
[00:59:08.491 --> 00:59:09.772]  We don't have to shut people down.
[00:59:09.772 --> 00:59:12.734]  Well, they certainly use it to blame gun owners that haven't had any part of it.
[00:59:12.734 --> 00:59:13.134]  Well, yeah.
[00:59:13.134 --> 00:59:15.096]  It's being used by Bloombergers as being offensive.
[00:59:15.096 --> 00:59:16.076]  But listen, go into break.
[00:59:16.076 --> 00:59:16.597]  Let me just say this.
[00:59:17.992 --> 00:59:20.794]  Next hour has regular radio ads, slash TV.
[00:59:20.794 --> 00:59:24.777]  But then when that's over, two more hours at least of live coverage dearing Megyn Kelly.
[00:59:24.777 --> 00:59:26.498]  So in one hour, her show starts.
[00:59:26.498 --> 00:59:27.959]  We'll have it up on the screen there.
[00:59:27.959 --> 00:59:29.641]  We'll show you the promos they're airing.
[00:59:29.641 --> 00:59:33.243]  Live time, we'll analyze it for you here.
[00:59:33.243 --> 00:59:36.406]  And then we'll take calls, have a bunch of guests on after that.
[00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:39.588]  But the big thing is, let them know there's a First Amendment.
[00:59:39.588 --> 00:59:41.950]  Don't let them set the precedent to try to shut the show down.
[00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:45.332]  Spread the links at InfoWars.com, the live video feeds.
[00:59:45.332 --> 00:59:45.953]  Everybody you know.
[00:59:46.493 --> 00:59:47.854]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[00:59:47.854 --> 00:59:49.194]  It took you over a year to do it.
[00:59:49.194 --> 00:59:50.415]  Why is this so good?
[00:59:50.415 --> 00:59:55.698]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[00:59:55.698 --> 01:00:09.245]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:00:09.245 --> 01:00:10.606]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:00:11.526 --> 01:00:13.027]  Spreading disease around.
[01:00:13.027 --> 01:00:15.609]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:00:15.609 --> 01:00:16.910]  These are all parasites.
[01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:18.010]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:19.351]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:00:19.351 --> 01:00:23.854]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:00:23.854 --> 01:00:27.116]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:00:27.116 --> 01:00:30.198]  Alright, well I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:00:30.198 --> 01:00:31.239]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:00:31.239 --> 01:00:33.160]  LivingDefense, InfowarsLife.com.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.201]  And folks, you can't lose.
[01:00:34.201 --> 01:00:36.222]  It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:00:37.763 --> 01:00:38.805]  You support the broadcast.
[01:00:38.805 --> 01:00:40.147]  Infowarslives.com.
[01:00:40.147 --> 01:00:42.410]  Thank you, Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.353]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:00:46.986 --> 01:00:55.232]  Please listen carefully, because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[01:00:55.232 --> 01:00:56.452]  A 360 win.
[01:00:56.452 --> 01:01:03.017]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[01:01:03.017 --> 01:01:10.542]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip, because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:01:10.942 --> 01:01:16.026]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:01:16.026 --> 01:01:22.131]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[01:01:22.131 --> 01:01:29.917]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[01:01:29.917 --> 01:01:37.122]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:01:37.122 --> 01:01:37.923]  10% off on auto ship.
[01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:40.527]  Win-win-win at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:01:40.527 --> 01:01:42.510]  Free shipping on orders above $50.
[01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:50.482]  And all out-of-stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip.
[01:01:50.482 --> 01:01:53.106]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:02:03.516 --> 01:02:07.785]  You're listening to the Antidote for Fake News.
[01:02:07.785 --> 01:02:09.729]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:36.934]  Jack Vostobek, who was there when another great patriot, Laura Lohmer, charged up during the Central Park simulated murder of President Trump.
[01:02:36.934 --> 01:02:38.235]  That's become international news.
[01:02:38.235 --> 01:02:40.075]  As we call for peace, the left calls for violence.
[01:02:41.874 --> 01:02:47.977]  We've got a bunch of other guests coming up as we cover the Megyn Kelly demonization piece that is about to happen.
[01:02:47.977 --> 01:02:52.919]  We're going to go to break here in just a few minutes and come back in the next long segment with Jack Posobiec riding shotgun with me.
[01:02:52.919 --> 01:02:56.941]  He'll also be co-hosting that after I leave because I want him to have the floor, is Mike Cernovich.
[01:02:56.941 --> 01:02:58.542]  Mike, what are you expecting coming up tonight?
[01:02:59.286 --> 01:03:07.473]  Yeah, they're going to say they're going to try to pin everything bad that has happened on you, even though all you do is host and discuss issues.
[01:03:07.473 --> 01:03:12.558]  And their endgame, again, is they want to get every independent media shut down and discredit independent media.
[01:03:12.558 --> 01:03:15.381]  They want to pressure people to not believe you.
[01:03:15.381 --> 01:03:17.663]  But here's the way I would script it.
[01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:22.744]  I would say, okay, there's this pizza parlor shooting, Alex Jones' fault.
[01:03:22.744 --> 01:03:26.866]  Sandy Hook, here's some parents, they're hurting, it's Alex Jones' fault.
[01:03:26.866 --> 01:03:28.266]  They're going to blame everything.
[01:03:28.266 --> 01:03:30.987]  Alex Jones lost his kid in a custody battle, not true.
[01:03:30.987 --> 01:03:32.668]  Unfit father, parents are bad.
[01:03:32.668 --> 01:03:33.388]  On Father's Day.
[01:03:33.388 --> 01:03:33.969]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:03:33.969 --> 01:03:37.170]  That's why they aired it as a sign up against Fathers and Father's Day.
[01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:43.373]  So that's why people aren't really going to fall for it because, like we were talking about earlier with Steve is,
[01:03:44.193 --> 01:03:48.296]  Steve and I disagree, but the idea is that let's talk about it.
[01:03:48.296 --> 01:03:57.621]  Right now the left, and this is why it's so important to talk to Jack, a citizen journalist and a hero in that regard, is if I disagree with somebody, I'm going to say let's talk about it, let's debate it.
[01:03:57.621 --> 01:03:59.362]  What's your side of the issue?
[01:03:59.362 --> 01:04:06.046]  Antifa and these left-wing terrorist organizations, they will hit you with a brick, hit you with a bi-clock, and the media looks the other way.
[01:04:06.046 --> 01:04:07.147]  They say it's good, actually.
[01:04:07.287 --> 01:04:16.215]  Yeah, and the media won't cover it, the violence against us, and that's why Posobiec has now forced an international conversation on left-wing terrorism.
[01:04:16.215 --> 01:04:24.623]  And that's happening, and then I noticed in his Twitter feed, and on mine and yours, they're making jokes like, oh, that's not about Trump, that play.
[01:04:24.623 --> 01:04:26.846]  So they act like we're idiots, they play these mind games.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:35.704]  Yeah, they lie right to your face and that's why that disruption, very peaceful, unlike the left, was so important because now they have to talk about it.
[01:04:35.704 --> 01:04:37.164]  Now they can't cover up the issue.
[01:04:37.164 --> 01:04:39.845]  Now they can't pretend like they don't know what is really going on here.
[01:04:39.845 --> 01:04:46.108]  I want to go out to break with just part of a piece that was done by Mark Dice on this.
[01:04:46.108 --> 01:04:52.991]  We're going to come back and go to Jack Posobiec here on the other side, but here is part of the breakdown that's up on Infowars.com by Mark Dice.
[01:04:53.837 --> 01:05:06.919]  Several brave protesters have interrupted the play that's depicting the assassination of President Trump that's being carried on in the middle of Central Park in New York City, a play which is being funded by CNN's parent company, Time Warner.
[01:05:06.919 --> 01:05:21.782]  As you may have heard, it's a perverted and despicably twisted version of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, which depicts President Trump as Caesar, who has a wife, who also has a Slovenian accent, who likes to dress in designer clothes,
[01:05:22.262 --> 01:05:27.684]  Who is stabbed to death on stage, even in today's dangerous political climate.
[01:05:27.684 --> 01:05:42.650]  And after the attempted assassination of several Republican congressmen, the liberal lunatics still think it's a good idea to be putting this play on, which many say is attempting to incite more violence against conservatives and possibly against the president himself.
[01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:56.116]  So Friday night, in the middle of the play, several brave protesters decided to denounce this despicable play, one of which, identified as Laura Loomer, decided to storm the stage and give the audience a piece of her mind.
[01:05:56.116 --> 01:05:57.277]  Here's that clip.
[01:05:57.277 --> 01:06:01.459]  Stop the normalization of political violence again in the right.
[01:06:01.459 --> 01:06:02.820]  This is unacceptable.
[01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:05.061]  You cannot- Get off the stage!
[01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:07.702]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to pause.
[01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:08.682]  We're going to pause.
[01:06:08.682 --> 01:06:09.303]  Security.
[01:06:09.303 --> 01:06:11.143]  Security, please.
[01:06:18.732 --> 01:06:25.738]  The New York liberals are literally booing her for denouncing the violent depiction of an assassination of our president.
[01:06:32.452 --> 01:06:38.154]  Now they got mad at a rodeo clown, who by the way was Hispanic, making fun of Obama.
[01:06:38.154 --> 01:06:39.514]  And that had to be banned.
[01:06:39.514 --> 01:06:42.355]  But if you want to simulate killing the president, they admit they're simulating it.
[01:06:42.355 --> 01:06:43.995]  When people complain, they say it's not happening.
[01:06:43.995 --> 01:06:45.796]  Jack Posobiec will break this down straight ahead.
[01:06:45.796 --> 01:06:48.317]  We have a lot of other guests coming up, and some surprise guests.
[01:06:48.317 --> 01:06:55.499]  But Mike Cernovich was just pointing out to me, they're blocking the promotion of this live feed and Jones vs. Kelly right now.
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:57.680]  Embrics Essentials.
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.781]  That's my middle name.
[01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:11.226]  I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand that's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products that's organic high quality.
[01:07:11.226 --> 01:07:16.988]  This is one of the top three selling organic brands in the country that puts out
[01:07:17.168 --> 01:07:20.372]  High-quality organic shampoo, mouthwash, you name it.
[01:07:20.372 --> 01:07:24.998]  And they're such patriots, they have let us basically keep their well-known packaging.
[01:07:24.998 --> 01:07:32.126]  It is an answer to prayer, and because we're cutting out the middleman, 20% off retail, sign up for auto-ship, an additional 25% off.
[01:07:32.126 --> 01:07:33.288]  It's all there.
[01:07:33.288 --> 01:07:33.989]  The Body Wash.
[01:07:34.249 --> 01:07:38.710]  The shampoo, the deodorant, the mouthwash, all of it is truly game-changing.
[01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:49.434]  It is the exact same product, just the name is different, Emrix Essentials, and it's on average 20% off what it would be in stores, buying it directly from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:07:49.434 --> 01:07:52.054]  Help us win the Info War while getting products everybody needs.
[01:07:52.054 --> 01:07:58.076]  InfoWarsLife.com, where you'll find the entire line of Emrix Essentials.
[01:07:58.076 --> 01:08:03.158]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:27.946]  We've got colleges all over the United States where they have no white weekends.
[01:08:27.946 --> 01:08:31.450]  We see absolutely massive demonization of free speech everywhere.
[01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:35.935]  We see the media promoting racism and the murder of President Trump.
[01:08:35.935 --> 01:08:40.240]  And we see Laura Lerner and of course Jack Posobiec covering it Friday.
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:46.285]  I guess there's still two more nights of the Shakespeare in the Park, of the killing of President Trump.
[01:08:46.285 --> 01:08:48.727]  Oh yeah, tonight's going to be great.
[01:08:48.727 --> 01:08:50.389]  I'll tell you about that on break.
[01:08:50.389 --> 01:08:53.011]  Well I'm sure we can cover it live a little bit later, you were telling me earlier.
[01:08:53.011 --> 01:08:58.357]  So Jack, obviously the left wants violence, they want war, they want to shut us down.
[01:08:58.357 --> 01:09:01.680]  Break down what you witnessed that night and where all this is going.
[01:09:02.694 --> 01:09:08.000]  Yeah, Alex, the thing I've got to talk about, really, and the point I want to make is that nobody else is making it.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:08.601]  How's it going?
[01:09:08.601 --> 01:09:09.261]  Good to see you.
[01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:11.664]  Good to see you, Mike, there at the Command Center.
[01:09:11.664 --> 01:09:16.429]  You know, what people aren't talking about is just how bloody this scene was.
[01:09:16.429 --> 01:09:17.991]  You know, to see that with my own eyes.
[01:09:18.815 --> 01:09:22.838]  Our president being stabbed again and again on stage.
[01:09:22.838 --> 01:09:26.081]  And then it was like a Tarantino film, a terrible Tarantino film.
[01:09:26.081 --> 01:09:36.410]  But then to have him turn around and see a crowd full of Manhattan's, you know, elite American citizens cheering it on, clapping, nodding their hands, you know, nodding their heads.
[01:09:36.690 --> 01:09:43.879]  They're their necklaces and bracelets clinking together as they cheer and applaud this brutal ritual killing of our president.
[01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.461]  It made my blood run.
[01:09:45.461 --> 01:09:51.688]  And with the background of calling for violence and death with the congressman and police shot just last week hanging on to life.
[01:09:52.449 --> 01:09:55.511]  And then they're the ones that if we did something like this, it'd be the end of the world.
[01:09:55.511 --> 01:10:02.194]  I mean, they are just a bunch of frothing betas that absolutely want power and want to wreck the country.
[01:10:02.194 --> 01:10:10.519]  Now, and about fake news, Jack, a New York Times reporter claimed that nobody actually laughed when Trump is assassinated on stage.
[01:10:10.519 --> 01:10:12.980]  Is that consistent with what you observed when you were there?
[01:10:14.281 --> 01:10:15.842]  No, it's not at all consistent, Mike.
[01:10:15.842 --> 01:10:18.785]  And you can go see, you know, I don't have anything to hide.
[01:10:18.785 --> 01:10:21.267]  We had two periscopes going during the thing.
[01:10:21.267 --> 01:10:22.788]  I've got my own video up.
[01:10:22.788 --> 01:10:24.290]  You can go back and look at the video.
[01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:31.156]  That's the beauty of citizen journalism that I do, is I always do a live- But earlier reviews said people were enraptured and shared it.
[01:10:31.596 --> 01:10:32.998]  I mean, again, why do they lie?
[01:10:32.998 --> 01:10:35.202]  Because I saw it on your Facebook, Twitter, everywhere.
[01:10:35.202 --> 01:10:37.406]  People are saying, oh, Jack, oh, everybody.
[01:10:37.406 --> 01:10:39.108]  This doesn't even play about Trump.
[01:10:39.108 --> 01:10:40.370]  This is 500 years old.
[01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:42.574]  This is William Shakespeare.
[01:10:42.574 --> 01:10:44.517]  I mean, it's crazy how they lie.
[01:10:47.281 --> 01:10:48.801]  ...really switch it around when they look bad.
[01:10:48.801 --> 01:10:54.402]  You know, they've got an actress up there playing Melania, and she comes up, it's a Slovenian accent, and it's very offensive.
[01:10:54.402 --> 01:10:56.243]  It's clearly meant to be Melania.
[01:10:56.243 --> 01:10:58.543]  This is clearly meant to be some kind of satire.
[01:10:58.543 --> 01:10:59.644]  Well, of course it's Trump!
[01:10:59.644 --> 01:11:16.367]  They got American flags, they got a big tall guy with orange hair, he's being stabbed to death... Antifa, they actually have, so the way they did the play, and I posted the video as well, is they have all of the crew that's moving around the sets is chanting Antifa slogans as they're moving the set around between scenes.
[01:11:16.627 --> 01:11:20.428]  I'm pretty sure William Shakespeare didn't write Antifa into his play.
[01:11:20.428 --> 01:11:28.510]  Yeah, and I like, too, how these dummies know that we don't understand that the moral of Julius Caesar was that Brutus lost and that you shouldn't actually assassinate somebody.
[01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:32.131]  I love how they think we didn't all take literature in high school, like they're so precious.
[01:11:32.131 --> 01:11:34.891]  Yeah, what happens to the people that kill Caesar?
[01:11:34.891 --> 01:11:37.112]  They get completely wiped out by Mark Anthony.
[01:11:37.112 --> 01:11:41.333]  Yeah, so we would get the last laugh, but I love, too, how they're like, oh my God, these illiterates.
[01:11:41.333 --> 01:11:44.114]  Like, dude, everybody read that your freshman year in high school.
[01:11:44.114 --> 01:11:45.534]  Don't act like you're some kind of
[01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:49.196]  Let me tell you, they're going to have Caesar's spirit.
[01:11:49.196 --> 01:11:50.537]  What happens if they do kill Trump?
[01:11:50.537 --> 01:11:52.038]  I mean, you talk about a martyr.
[01:11:52.038 --> 01:11:54.900]  Caesar's spirit stalking around for revenge.
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:12:01.945]  Violence will be in such use that, you know, mothers will just sit back and chop their babies up with meat cleavers as if it's a wonderful thing.
[01:12:01.945 --> 01:12:05.228]  Now that's actually a paraphrase of the William Shakespeare play.
[01:12:05.228 --> 01:12:08.090]  The media will probably say I'm calling for women to chop up babies with meat cleavers.
[01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:23.115]  Yeah, and that's why we're calling for unity, like Ted Nugent is calling for unity, is we are the good guys, the fake news media are the terrorists, and Alex and I talked about this, and would you join in our pledge, Jack, that Jake Taper, Brian Stelter, nobody in the media will join?
[01:12:23.115 --> 01:12:26.736]  Alex and I have pledged that we disavow all political violence.
[01:12:26.736 --> 01:12:28.837]  Why will no one else in the media... That's right, that's right.
[01:12:28.837 --> 01:12:29.817]  I mean, I call for the...
[01:12:30.157 --> 01:12:33.299]  Libertarians, Conservatives, nobody to offensively be violent.
[01:12:33.299 --> 01:12:34.539]  A time of calm.
[01:12:34.539 --> 01:12:43.323]  I call for the left to do the same, you know, with the great leadership of NRA board member and patriot, of course, who's now come out and talked about that Ted Nugent.
[01:12:43.323 --> 01:12:45.204]  I say we should follow Ted Nugent's lead.
[01:12:45.204 --> 01:12:48.846]  We've already done this, but we should reaffirm because they're getting so violent.
[01:12:48.846 --> 01:12:52.388]  We're not afraid of their violence for ourselves individually.
[01:12:52.388 --> 01:12:55.509]  We're afraid for the country because they're already saying, oh, you're scared.
[01:12:55.509 --> 01:12:57.970]  Oh, we're going to get you because we don't want violence.
[01:12:57.970 --> 01:12:58.971]  But then we look at a bunch of
[01:13:00.161 --> 01:13:04.784]  I mean liberals on average are some of the most dumb, wimpy, pathetic people out there.
[01:13:04.784 --> 01:13:09.026]  We're just really trying to not have a civil war and really just don't want more innocent people shot.
[01:13:09.026 --> 01:13:10.647]  Especially on Father's Day.
[01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:13.489]  We're watching these shootings happening and on Father's Day.
[01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:16.711]  So that is our challenge right now.
[01:13:16.711 --> 01:13:19.772]  Alex Jones, you know, Mike Cermich, Jack Posobiec.
[01:13:19.772 --> 01:13:22.934]  We are all saying that we disavow political violence.
[01:13:22.934 --> 01:13:27.097]  Jake Taper and CNN, we would like to extend as a gesture of goodwill.
[01:13:27.717 --> 01:13:41.092]  We would like CNN to join this pledge, and if they don't join this pledge, to me that suggests that they endorse it, because as you know, if Trump doesn't disavow everything somebody says or does, then that apparently means he improves it.
[01:13:41.092 --> 01:13:43.334]  So, yeah, we are challenging the media.
[01:13:43.334 --> 01:13:46.258]  Will you join this pledge, Jack, to disavow political violence?
[01:13:47.020 --> 01:13:48.621]  I absolutely join the pledge.
[01:13:48.621 --> 01:13:59.325]  And as a matter of fact, I'm going to be hosting, and I'm hoping I can get your guys backing at this as well, hosting a rally against political violence at the White House next Sunday.
[01:13:59.325 --> 01:14:00.826]  It's going to be June 25th.
[01:14:00.826 --> 01:14:02.967]  Love to have you both there if possible.
[01:14:02.967 --> 01:14:06.988]  But we want to stand, and I would invite people from the left to come and stand with me.
[01:14:06.988 --> 01:14:08.429]  Let's have Bernie Sanders up there.
[01:14:08.749 --> 01:14:13.353]  Let's have Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama come out and denounce violence that's done in their name.
[01:14:13.353 --> 01:14:14.394]  And let's have Islam.
[01:14:14.394 --> 01:14:18.558]  Let's have the Islamists that don't support what's happening come out and join us and they will.
[01:14:18.558 --> 01:14:19.678]  I'll hug them.
[01:14:19.678 --> 01:14:22.901]  Let's have CARE come on up and disavow all Muslim violence.
[01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:28.026]  I saw a news article saying that you and what's the other lady's name?
[01:14:28.026 --> 01:14:29.026]  I'm not aware of her work.
[01:14:29.747 --> 01:14:30.668]  Laura Lummer, great lady.
[01:14:30.668 --> 01:14:32.489]  I see her work, I just forget names.
[01:14:32.489 --> 01:14:33.650]  She was arrested, all the rest of it.
[01:14:33.650 --> 01:14:34.971]  I saw that you were a paid activist.
[01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.653]  So when we were setting you up for the show, I said, have you been paid?
[01:14:37.653 --> 01:14:38.994]  And you were like, no, no, we're doing this on our own.
[01:14:38.994 --> 01:14:45.860]  But I just want to say, I'm having the CNN is ISIS, CNN is terrorist, uh, um, you know, meme that, that, that Sardarvich and I came up with.
[01:14:46.460 --> 01:15:06.752]  And it's not just if you do that, it's anything that's noteworthy, like catching CNN doing fake newscasts, or catching MSNBC, who've only paid out about $10,000 worth, but I want to say $1,500 to you and $2,500 to Laura Larmer, so make sure we get your contact and get that money to you, because we're going to take leftist, globalist lies, and through alchemy, make it true!
[01:15:06.752 --> 01:15:13.736]  You weren't paid activists, but to represent, and to celebrate, and to give you a trophy, because you actually did something,
[01:15:14.116 --> 01:15:19.481]  You know, to highlight what you've done, to honor it, we're going to make sure you guys get that money, so great job.
[01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:22.203]  Well, I appreciate that, Alex, and thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.
[01:15:22.203 --> 01:15:29.810]  You know, when I was in the Navy, they used to tell you, I used to come to my senior chief with a problem or something, and he said, great problem, what are you going to do about it?
[01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:32.312]  Don't just call it the problem, actually do something about it.
[01:15:32.312 --> 01:15:36.015]  And that's what I learned in my military service, and that's kind of the way I look at these situations today.
[01:15:36.175 --> 01:15:39.017]  So I want to sponsor then, I can't be in D.C.
[01:15:39.017 --> 01:15:45.522]  next week, June 25th I don't think, but can I sponsor that event you're having to go against political violence just to make sure?
[01:15:45.522 --> 01:15:54.168]  Yeah, absolutely, because we're going to need security, we're going to need water, hydration, we know Antifa is going to try to attack it, so we're definitely going to need some support.
[01:15:54.168 --> 01:15:55.369]  I would really appreciate that, Mike.
[01:15:55.589 --> 01:15:56.009]  Okay, yeah.
[01:15:56.009 --> 01:15:56.689]  Absolutely.
[01:15:56.689 --> 01:16:03.292]  And expanding on that, again if you just tuned in, I've got Paul Watson tweeting it, we're tweeting it.
[01:16:03.292 --> 01:16:06.533]  One video we put out got a million views in a day, then it just stopped.
[01:16:06.533 --> 01:16:11.854]  Your videos got through the barbed wire and have had like almost 10 million this week, exposing Megyn Kelly, so that's great.
[01:16:11.854 --> 01:16:13.935]  All together, we've already had more viewers just on our
[01:16:14.215 --> 01:16:17.377]  YouTube and Facebook channels on videos that she'll have tonight.
[01:16:17.377 --> 01:16:18.518]  She was falling apart.
[01:16:18.518 --> 01:16:19.198]  She was failing.
[01:16:19.198 --> 01:16:20.799]  She had no ratings.
[01:16:20.799 --> 01:16:22.560]  This will give her some support.
[01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:28.924]  But I think overall, folks are calling it a rout of Megyn Kelly because she was caught on tape with me lying and saying it wasn't a hit piece.
[01:16:28.924 --> 01:16:32.226]  Now she promises it'll be the worst hit piece ever.
[01:16:32.226 --> 01:16:33.807]  What do you make of this, Jack Posobiec?
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.483]  Yeah, with Megyn Kelly coming out, I mean, this was one of her first big interviews.
[01:16:38.483 --> 01:16:44.867]  Honestly, I think it was a little bit bigger than her Vladimir Putin interview because it was more noteworthy to the American audience.
[01:16:44.867 --> 01:16:50.892]  But for her to fall flat on her face like this and not get the kind of ratings that she would need, this is a bad move for NBC.
[01:16:50.892 --> 01:16:57.437]  And sources that I've talked to in the newsroom at NBC said, you know, we're not paying her $15 million for this kind of controversy.
[01:16:57.437 --> 01:16:58.998]  We're not playing her for gotcha games.
[01:16:59.238 --> 01:17:02.639]  Look at Oliver Stone, the way that he conducted interviews over the course of two years.
[01:17:02.639 --> 01:17:04.259]  Very professional.
[01:17:04.259 --> 01:17:05.900]  I can break this story then.
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.880]  So actually, I'm glad that you mentioned it.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:12.241]  Maybe you have the same sources, but this is breaking news that hasn't been made public yet.
[01:17:12.241 --> 01:17:22.944]  NBC is actually in talks with Rupert Murdoch's son to bring Megyn Kelly back on, and the sons are actually talking about buying out Megyn Kelly's contract because she's been such a flop for NBC.
[01:17:22.944 --> 01:17:23.904]  Wait, breaking?
[01:17:23.904 --> 01:17:25.425]  Kelly may be out at NBC?
[01:17:26.005 --> 01:17:28.767]  Yeah, NBC has reached out to the Murdoch Brothers.
[01:17:28.767 --> 01:17:30.008]  This is NBC sources?
[01:17:30.008 --> 01:17:30.688]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:30.688 --> 01:17:35.492]  Official, I can't say which network, but official media sources with personal knowledge have told me.
[01:17:35.492 --> 01:17:38.334]  By the way, everybody knows you don't make up your sources.
[01:17:38.334 --> 01:17:45.099]  I can't even give my info on this because it would give up the sources, but, well, I just can't say anything.
[01:17:45.099 --> 01:17:49.001]  I just can't.
[01:17:49.001 --> 01:17:50.563]  We'll be right back with Jack Posobiec.
[01:17:50.563 --> 01:17:52.524]  I'm Alex Jones, Mike Cernovich.
[01:17:52.524 --> 01:17:53.945]  Stay with us, a lot coming up.
[01:17:53.945 --> 01:17:55.246]  We're 45 minutes out from the interview.
[01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:18.932]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:18:18.932 --> 01:18:20.415]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:18:38.112 --> 01:18:39.193]  Jack Posobiec is our guest.
[01:18:39.193 --> 01:18:40.715]  We've got another guest coming in here.
[01:18:40.715 --> 01:18:46.140]  The man that launched one of the more successful alternative social media platforms, Gab.
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.302]  So that's coming up.
[01:18:48.302 --> 01:18:51.345]  Also intend to open the phones up after the Megyn Kelly interview.
[01:18:51.345 --> 01:18:53.727]  Will it be at the start of the show or will it be in the middle or the end?
[01:18:53.727 --> 01:18:53.887]  Jack?
[01:18:54.869 --> 01:18:56.671]  Postovic maybe has his own ideas.
[01:18:56.671 --> 01:18:58.173]  Why is this so big?
[01:18:58.173 --> 01:19:04.041]  Because in the last two and a half weeks, this has been as big as Comey or as big as anything else.
[01:19:04.041 --> 01:19:07.667]  I mean, this is one of the top stories, top trending every day.
[01:19:07.667 --> 01:19:10.471]  So you can argue it's the top story the last two weeks.
[01:19:10.931 --> 01:19:13.752]  Jack Posobiec, what do you think they've been betting on?
[01:19:13.752 --> 01:19:15.572]  Because, again, it's not even about the interview coming up.
[01:19:15.572 --> 01:19:20.913]  It was about lying about what I stand for as a way to demonize new media overall.
[01:19:20.913 --> 01:19:24.334]  This is the dinosaur media, I believe, showing how desperate they are.
[01:19:24.334 --> 01:19:28.675]  Again, Jack Posobiec was there covering the live event with Laura Larmer, who did a great job.
[01:19:28.675 --> 01:19:30.656]  We're going to get her on soon.
[01:19:30.656 --> 01:19:35.037]  Confronting the Democrats as they do the Shakespeare in the Park simulated murder of Trump.
[01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:37.057]  Where is all this going?
[01:19:37.057 --> 01:19:38.738]  Yeah, Alex, and I just want to let you know that I
[01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:40.963]  I actually spoke with Lara over the break.
[01:19:40.963 --> 01:19:41.543]  She texted me.
[01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:44.424]  She said she's very excited to come on very soon and talk.
[01:19:44.424 --> 01:19:54.168]  Where this is going, Alex, is you're seeing the death throes of the old media, the dinosaur media, this sort of media party that's been in collusion with the Democrats.
[01:19:54.168 --> 01:19:55.468]  They're in their death throes.
[01:19:55.468 --> 01:19:56.569]  They're losing their numbers.
[01:19:56.569 --> 01:19:57.829]  They're firing people.
[01:19:57.829 --> 01:19:59.210]  They're laying off people left and right.
[01:19:59.210 --> 01:20:01.611]  They're being gobbled up by these massive corporations.
[01:20:01.611 --> 01:20:04.172]  And they're seeing new platforms like InfoWars,
[01:20:04.512 --> 01:20:04.732]  We're good.
[01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:32.139]  Exactly, and we now know, we've got the intel that Facebook, Twitter, all of it is throttling back our tweets, just like all the positive tweets can't get to Trump anymore.
[01:20:50.593 --> 01:20:53.494]  He knows to go deep down to actually have communication with us.
[01:20:53.494 --> 01:21:01.055]  This is how they make us feel small, how they make us feel pathetic, you know, how they get in our face, and even how they set us up.
[01:21:01.055 --> 01:21:07.596]  Because one time I was at a pro-gun rally in San Antonio, and this old guy, I didn't even know, started bumping into me and getting in my face.
[01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:09.997]  And he kept doing it and following me down the street.
[01:21:09.997 --> 01:21:14.978]  So then I did it later, and then supposedly, reportedly, he lost some family member in some shooting in another part of the country.
[01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:19.343]  And they're like, oh, look, he knew this guy was a father of somebody killed by a gun.
[01:21:19.343 --> 01:21:19.904]  No, they were.
[01:21:19.904 --> 01:21:20.744]  We have the raw video.
[01:21:20.744 --> 01:21:27.610]  He was like in my face, threatening his wife, actually slapped his wife in the hand in front of us and was so pissed off.
[01:21:27.610 --> 01:21:28.912]  I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:21:28.912 --> 01:21:30.973]  But again, that's how they spin it.
[01:21:30.973 --> 01:21:33.255]  And that's how you got to really watch out, folks, with these psyops.
[01:21:34.036 --> 01:21:40.841]  Yeah, so that is definitely, we're hearing that there are now bot accounts on Twitter trying to lie and discredit you right now.
[01:21:40.841 --> 01:21:42.142]  So I just got that information.
[01:21:42.142 --> 01:21:46.105]  So there's now a ton of... This is a full-on info war.
[01:21:46.105 --> 01:21:50.268]  Right, that's why you got to post the hashtag JonesVTwitter.
[01:21:50.268 --> 01:21:51.409]  Share the links.
[01:21:51.409 --> 01:21:53.311]  If we keep pushing, we'll break through the algorithm.
[01:21:53.311 --> 01:21:56.773]  There are bots being hired right now on Twitter and they keep...
[01:21:57.694 --> 01:22:07.700]  Yeah, so all the Twitter now... The bottom line is just go to Infowars.com forward slash show, spread our Periscope, spread our YouTube, spread our Facebook video, but the stations are all over the country.
[01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:11.983]  It's really about demonizing me, going after my sponsors, but I'm self-funded now.
[01:22:11.983 --> 01:22:13.384]  We're growing in the face of this.
[01:22:13.384 --> 01:22:15.785]  Jack Pasobic in closing and then Mike Cernovich.
[01:22:15.785 --> 01:22:18.747]  What do you think they are going to do as all this fails?
[01:22:20.265 --> 01:22:25.048]  Well, what they're going to do is become increasingly, increasingly more stepped up in their attacks.
[01:22:25.048 --> 01:22:27.009]  They're going to be finding ways to get to us.
[01:22:27.009 --> 01:22:28.290]  They're going to be hiring people.
[01:22:28.290 --> 01:22:29.571]  They're going to be coming to our events.
[01:22:29.571 --> 01:22:30.451]  They're going to lie to us.
[01:22:30.451 --> 01:22:35.815]  They're going to try to infiltrate our events, infiltrate our background.
[01:22:35.815 --> 01:22:37.456]  They're going to do anything they can.
[01:22:37.456 --> 01:22:39.417]  Plant evidence, false flags, you name it.
[01:22:39.417 --> 01:22:40.798]  Anything they can do to take us out.
[01:22:41.442 --> 01:22:45.266]  That's right, they were popping in your ear, Mike.
[01:22:45.266 --> 01:22:49.250]  Let's give people slowly the right hashtag to put out on Twitter.
[01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:51.752]  The hashtag is JonesVKelly.
[01:22:51.752 --> 01:22:59.060]  Just like a fight, just like McConner, McGregor versus Floyd Mayweather, JonesVKelly is the hashtag of the day.
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:03.164]  Get it trending, keep posting the links, the periscopes, the videos, everything coming out.
[01:23:03.484 --> 01:23:04.304]  This is a war.
[01:23:04.304 --> 01:23:12.827]  Right now, all the big Sordos money, right now the Bloomberg money, admittedly, is financing and, you know, using people who've been hurt in this country to go after our free speech.
[01:23:12.827 --> 01:23:14.668]  This is their attempt.
[01:23:14.668 --> 01:23:18.870]  So, listen, Jack Posobiec, great job, and again, I really appreciate the work you've done.
[01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:25.892]  I look forward to, they said you were a paid activist, you weren't, but you deserve an award for what you and Laura Larmer did, so we'll talk soon.
[01:23:25.892 --> 01:23:30.134]  And wait, before you go real quick, June 25th, is that what you said?
[01:23:30.134 --> 01:23:30.734]  Tell us more.
[01:23:31.514 --> 01:23:35.857]  We're still getting the permit, but it looks like it'll be June 25th at noon, right in front of the White House.
[01:23:35.857 --> 01:23:36.337]  Alright, good.
[01:23:36.337 --> 01:23:36.698]  Thanks.
[01:23:36.698 --> 01:23:37.318]  Thank you.
[01:23:37.318 --> 01:23:38.539]  Now, I want to come back.
[01:23:39.651 --> 01:23:51.776]  Bring our other guest in here and talk about where he sees this going, how we're forced to go create our own new platforms because Facebook and Twitter and others are admittedly so censored now, and where is all this going and how we counter it.
[01:23:51.776 --> 01:24:02.061]  I've also got a bunch of clips that I haven't gotten to yet where we have Fox News compares me to murderers and rapists, Whoopi Goldberg lies about what I've said, and Dan Rather dug up from the grave
[01:24:04.278 --> 01:24:06.199]  Of course, they put Dan Rather there.
[01:24:06.199 --> 01:24:08.821]  It's actually Tom Brokaw.
[01:24:08.821 --> 01:24:13.744]  You know, saying just the most outrageous things against us.
[01:24:13.744 --> 01:24:15.345]  Why are they so scared?
[01:24:15.345 --> 01:24:21.189]  Because they're losing their viewers, they're losing their trust, they're losing the ratings, and they think it's our fault.
[01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:24.431]  No, it's that you're so discredited, you're so disliked.
[01:24:24.431 --> 01:24:27.312]  Now, we're like 35 minutes out from when they could be airing the
[01:24:28.633 --> 01:24:33.057]  Vaunted, 11 minute, highly edited interview where Megyn Kelly got caught lying.
[01:24:33.057 --> 01:24:36.419]  But going back to that briefly, how much does this hurt Megyn Kelly?
[01:24:36.419 --> 01:24:38.241]  Because I don't want to hurt her personally.
[01:24:38.241 --> 01:24:44.466]  She hurt herself saying, I promise it's going to be a softball, I promise it's not going to be a hit piece, I promise I'm not getting into these topics.
[01:24:44.466 --> 01:24:45.827]  And she's been caught
[01:24:47.188 --> 01:24:51.212]  The NBC is now trying to get the Murdoch brothers to do a contract buyout.
[01:24:51.212 --> 01:24:56.497]  The sons of Rupert Murdoch, these are the ones that are beta males, they're married to these liberal women who are
[01:25:05.786 --> 01:25:13.229]  You know, that's why they had to get rid of Bill O'Reilly and they're trying to get rid of Hannity and anybody who's remotely not viewed as a part of the cocktail party set.
[01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:18.051]  So NBC realizes that Megyn Kelly does not have major league talent.
[01:25:18.051 --> 01:25:19.551]  She is no Barbara Walters.
[01:25:19.551 --> 01:25:20.472]  She isn't interesting.
[01:25:20.472 --> 01:25:21.272]  She doesn't read books.
[01:25:21.272 --> 01:25:22.893]  She doesn't study history.
[01:25:22.893 --> 01:25:33.137]  They're trying to get rid of her and the Murdoch sons are so bait-ized that they're willing to potentially buy out Megyn Kelly's contract to bring her back onto Fox News.
[01:25:33.902 --> 01:25:36.744]  Because they thought, hey, she already tried to bring down Fox News.
[01:25:36.744 --> 01:25:38.224]  She worked for us well.
[01:25:38.224 --> 01:25:40.846]  She helped change the story about Ailes.
[01:25:40.846 --> 01:25:43.147]  He's out of the way now.
[01:25:43.147 --> 01:25:45.729]  But Fox is now sinking into the mud.
[01:25:45.729 --> 01:25:47.169]  They're in total panic mode.
[01:25:47.169 --> 01:25:50.411]  They're thinking, maybe she'll work better with this audience.
[01:25:50.411 --> 01:25:53.613]  Right, so Fox, they went from number one all the time.
[01:25:53.613 --> 01:25:55.474]  Their ratings have actually been falling.
[01:25:55.474 --> 01:25:56.355]  They're not number one anymore.
[01:25:56.355 --> 01:25:57.755]  The first time in 20 years.
[01:25:57.755 --> 01:25:59.757]  Right, so they're not number one anymore.
[01:25:59.757 --> 01:26:00.917]  So they want a lifeline.
[01:26:00.917 --> 01:26:01.958]  Oh, that was other fake news.
[01:26:02.478 --> 01:26:09.043]  Whenever I said back in July, there's a coup against Fox, they're gonna remove everybody, it's now on, and now they're destroyed!
[01:26:09.043 --> 01:26:11.805]  Well, and that's the thing about having sources nobody else has.
[01:26:11.805 --> 01:26:15.468]  People go, it's fake, but then when you get it right, they don't go, oh, you got it.
[01:26:15.468 --> 01:26:18.710]  I was at the RNC meeting with people at the Ritz-Carlton.
[01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:19.151]  Exactly.
[01:26:19.151 --> 01:26:21.613]  I was talking, I mean, I was meeting with the executives.
[01:26:21.613 --> 01:26:21.893]  Yeah.
[01:26:21.893 --> 01:26:24.695]  Hell, I mean, Roger Ailes, before he died, was calling me, wanting to launch a network.
[01:26:24.995 --> 01:26:27.619]  That's actually, people don't know, they want to do a new TV network.
[01:26:27.619 --> 01:26:28.740]  Roger Ailes 5th.
[01:26:28.740 --> 01:26:30.202]  I don't think that's public yet, though.
[01:26:30.202 --> 01:26:31.344]  Well, whatever.
[01:26:31.344 --> 01:26:32.245]  That's why they're so pissed.
[01:26:32.245 --> 01:26:33.347]  They got all the phones tabbed.
[01:26:33.347 --> 01:26:34.809]  They know what's going on.
[01:26:34.809 --> 01:26:35.289]  Don't worry.
[01:26:35.289 --> 01:26:38.233]  We don't need Roger Ailes to launch this.
[01:26:38.233 --> 01:26:38.854]  We'll be back.
[01:26:38.854 --> 01:26:39.595]  Poor Roger, though.
[01:26:39.595 --> 01:26:40.016]  We'll be back.
[01:26:48.254 --> 01:26:57.546]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:26:57.546 --> 01:27:01.371]  When I was young I was the nicest guy
[01:27:05.821 --> 01:27:08.682]  Well, Michael Malice is one of the top writers in the country.
[01:27:08.682 --> 01:27:09.222]  He's huge.
[01:27:09.222 --> 01:27:10.282]  I mean, I've read a couple of his books.
[01:27:10.282 --> 01:27:13.204]  I know he ghostwrites a ton of the other top books in the country.
[01:27:13.204 --> 01:27:15.805]  He's riding shotgun with us for 30 minutes.
[01:27:15.805 --> 01:27:20.686]  He also is the guy that got in and got the unauthorized autobiography of Kim Jong-un in North Korea.
[01:27:20.686 --> 01:27:22.327]  It takes a lot of courage to do that.
[01:27:22.327 --> 01:27:23.007]  MichaelMalice.com
[01:27:24.793 --> 01:27:31.497]  Twitter forward slash at Michael Malice and of course we have Mike Cernovich here with us, Roger Stone, Jack Posobiec.
[01:27:31.497 --> 01:27:37.760]  But tell us who, I've seen this guy with Paul Watson when he was here and I know about his big website Gab, but Michael Cernovich, tell us about this guy.
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:42.703]  Yeah, so this is Andrew Torba, founder, co-founder and CEO of Gab, which is an alternative platform.
[01:27:43.303 --> 01:27:57.755]  What I thought would be cool of having Michael Malice here and Torba here too is, ultimately, the media right now is in a tizzy because NBC is giving Alex Jones a platform, as if you need a platform, as if they control who gets a platform.
[01:27:57.755 --> 01:28:02.279]  That said, they do want to get us removed from all these platforms.
[01:28:02.279 --> 01:28:06.642]  Because we're dominating 200 million views right now a month from me on Twitter.
[01:28:06.642 --> 01:28:09.845]  They're eventually going to have to say, OK, we have no platform.
[01:28:09.845 --> 01:28:11.827]  You just had five videos this week.
[01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:14.431]  That had like 9 million viewers.
[01:28:14.431 --> 01:28:16.956]  And you're just exponent... it's crazy.
[01:28:16.956 --> 01:28:22.587]  Right, so they're going to try to get us banned and that's why it's important to have alternative platforms and he created Gab which does that.
[01:28:22.587 --> 01:28:23.810]  Really, they just don't want choices.
[01:28:26.018 --> 01:28:28.899]  I'll be honest, though, I've never seen such media hype around an interview.
[01:28:28.899 --> 01:28:31.520]  I mean, I do have somewhat of a pucker factor.
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:34.602]  Everybody's saying it blew up in her face because she got caught lying to me on tape.
[01:28:34.602 --> 01:28:40.364]  We've got these other tapes of what the interview happened, but the way they edited it, I don't want to say I'm scared, but I do have some butterflies.
[01:28:40.364 --> 01:28:42.225]  What do you guys think is going to happen tonight?
[01:28:42.225 --> 01:28:44.946]  And let's just get into the whole state of the world, wherever you want to go.
[01:28:44.946 --> 01:28:45.647]  Free for all.
[01:28:45.647 --> 01:28:46.367]  Go for it, Mike.
[01:28:48.544 --> 01:28:49.084]  You asking me?
[01:28:49.084 --> 01:28:51.105]  Yeah, I mean, where do you think this is all going?
[01:28:51.105 --> 01:28:53.105]  Why do you think the Megyn Kelly thing's so big?
[01:28:53.105 --> 01:28:55.705]  Why is the left so frothing, calling for violence?
[01:28:55.705 --> 01:28:57.286]  It's like a Twilight Zone.
[01:28:57.286 --> 01:29:01.907]  Because for decades, they had a complete monopoly on the mechanisms of communication.
[01:29:01.907 --> 01:29:07.108]  So people like you, and even people who are more mainstream than you, you would never even hear about them.
[01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:13.409]  You had three channels, and those three channels had three anchors, and each of those anchors was a slightly different version of progressivism.
[01:29:13.809 --> 01:29:18.595]  And then you have the appearance that there's three people to choose from, but this is a Hobson's choice.
[01:29:18.595 --> 01:29:28.809]  Now, ever since the 80s with talk radio, you can't shut up these other points of view, and that's why they're so hysterical, because you should be neither seen nor heard.
[01:29:29.468 --> 01:29:35.312]  And Alex, I think we're seeing the same thing online as well with technology platforms where you have this illusion of choice.
[01:29:35.312 --> 01:29:41.576]  You have Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram and WhatsApp are both owned by Facebook.
[01:29:41.576 --> 01:29:47.499]  So you look at the top 20 apps on the App Store and 25% of them are owned by Facebook and you have this illusion of choice.
[01:29:47.499 --> 01:29:52.683]  But the reality is they're all owned by the same company and they're all controlled by the same three or four people in Silicon Valley.
[01:29:53.283 --> 01:29:56.969]  Google, yep, and owned by Google as well.
[01:29:56.969 --> 01:30:03.539]  So, you have three or four people in Silicon Valley that control... And I know, as a tech guy, you know this, the public does, but it's getting worse.
[01:30:03.539 --> 01:30:05.662]  It's intensifying.
[01:30:05.662 --> 01:30:07.304]  Where does this end?
[01:30:07.304 --> 01:30:08.746]  Where does this fight end up going?
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:14.322]  I think we're going in a great direction, honestly, because for decades you had complete trust in the media.
[01:30:14.322 --> 01:30:21.484]  You remember back in the 40s and 50s, people would trust Chesterfield cigarettes because those are going to be great for you, and now people don't trust any cigarette company.
[01:30:21.484 --> 01:30:23.185]  They know what they're selling, the product.
[01:30:23.185 --> 01:30:24.665]  And the same thing used to be with the media.
[01:30:24.665 --> 01:30:30.147]  You would trust CBS, you would trust ABC, you would trust NBC, and now their trust approval rating is even below Congress.
[01:30:30.407 --> 01:30:32.167]  Because people know they're peddling a bunch of crap.
[01:30:32.167 --> 01:30:43.110]  And they want to misrepresent what I've said or anybody else has said, or take a few flowery clips together, mix it up to make themselves look better, even if they're successful at destroying me, which I don't think they are, we're only getting bigger.
[01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:45.991]  They've destroyed themselves.
[01:30:45.991 --> 01:30:46.831]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:30:46.831 --> 01:30:52.172]  And to give the message that you shouldn't bother listening to this person, he has nothing of interest to say.
[01:30:52.172 --> 01:30:54.753]  Now think about it, they claim they want honest debate.
[01:30:54.753 --> 01:30:58.594]  They can easily have you come forward and say, this guy's saying X, Y, and Z, and he's wrong.
[01:30:58.594 --> 01:30:59.354]  But they don't want that.
[01:30:59.634 --> 01:31:05.759]  They want you to be preemptively discredited so that anything you have to say they won't have to deal with.
[01:31:05.759 --> 01:31:09.381]  I mean, you're all smart guys, so seriously, I feel like I'm kind of here on the execution dock.
[01:31:09.381 --> 01:31:10.222]  I hope this goes well.
[01:31:10.222 --> 01:31:14.205]  I mean, it's going to be horrible because they spent weeks editing it.
[01:31:14.205 --> 01:31:15.185]  What are they thinking?
[01:31:15.185 --> 01:31:17.207]  Because you could just see the train wreck here.
[01:31:17.207 --> 01:31:22.431]  That's what's scary to me is the people running the country who are trying to stop Trump from actually turning the economy back on.
[01:31:22.431 --> 01:31:23.852]  They seem to be totally out of control.
[01:31:25.871 --> 01:31:29.794]  Yeah, I think what we're going to see now is a big push on social media.
[01:31:29.794 --> 01:31:31.615]  Mike talked about bots, you know, last segment.
[01:31:56.031 --> 01:32:03.275]  And that always tends to backfire, but it's so brazen.
[01:32:03.275 --> 01:32:05.977]  Even their minions, low-level, are so full of hate.
[01:32:05.977 --> 01:32:16.883]  I mean, they really, I guess existentially, living through Hillary and through Nancy Pelosi, and now they don't think they're in power, so they're all upset.
[01:32:16.883 --> 01:32:17.643]  Where does this go, then?
[01:32:17.643 --> 01:32:18.444]  I keep going back to that.
[01:32:18.444 --> 01:32:18.904]  Where does it go?
[01:32:21.038 --> 01:32:21.299]  I think?
[01:32:50.738 --> 01:32:56.481]  I want to know how we fight that, but Michael Malice, this sounds like a Streisand effect bigger than the universe.
[01:32:56.481 --> 01:32:59.042]  I mean, at gut level, won't this backfire?
[01:32:59.042 --> 01:33:01.783]  This isn't old Russia or Cuba or Venezuela.
[01:33:01.783 --> 01:33:06.625]  I don't see them, once we've had internet freedom so long, getting away with Chinese-style net censorship.
[01:33:06.625 --> 01:33:08.006]  It has already started backfiring.
[01:33:08.006 --> 01:33:13.528]  You remember during the primaries, Ted Cruz deraided the moderators, who are supposed to be objective and honest.
[01:33:13.968 --> 01:33:16.009]  And the audience applauded them.
[01:33:16.009 --> 01:33:23.052]  So these are things that could have never happened in 2012 or 2008, where the press was perceived as honest arbiters of debate.
[01:33:23.052 --> 01:33:26.654]  Now everyone knows that they have an agenda, and that's the way the country was founded.
[01:33:26.654 --> 01:33:33.277]  When we were founded, you had the Federalist Papers, and you had the Democratic-Republican Papers, and they picked sides, and it was very clear people were partisan.
[01:33:33.277 --> 01:33:34.197]  That was fine.
[01:33:34.197 --> 01:33:37.279]  Now it's the kind of noblesse oblige, this perception
[01:33:39.260 --> 01:33:47.246]  And I think that's it.
[01:33:47.246 --> 01:33:52.730]  Before MSM was controlled, they lied some, but they were scared of getting caught by the public and by their colleagues.
[01:33:52.730 --> 01:33:56.012]  Now, there's like a unified race to the finish line.
[01:33:56.012 --> 01:34:02.457]  I mean, let's take this clip here from Tom Brokaw, where no one who's real has ever said, I said something racist.
[01:34:02.457 --> 01:34:04.458]  The racist white supremacist, everybody actually hate me.
[01:34:04.458 --> 01:34:06.460]  The black supremacist, they hate me because I want unity.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:23.574]  But there's this thing, don't like Obamacare, you're a racist, but to see even Tom Brokaw, taken out of the Crypt Keepers area, rolled out to say I'm an unalloyed, that means complete, total racist, if you don't know what unalloyed means, I did not have to look it up, and I'm quite a, you know, I've got a big lexicon.
[01:34:23.574 --> 01:34:24.555]  What does this signify?
[01:34:24.555 --> 01:34:25.016]  Here's the clip.
[01:34:25.976 --> 01:34:29.379]  The whole game is to, let me play gotcha.
[01:34:29.379 --> 01:34:31.881]  Let me show you how meaner I can be.
[01:34:31.881 --> 01:34:35.824]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[01:34:35.824 --> 01:34:46.593]  But the fact is that he is an unalloyed racist, a man who's out there pulling the pin on the grenade every day, and he has six million viewers who are paying attention to him.
[01:34:46.593 --> 01:34:51.617]  And the parents at Newtown are saying they're hearing from his followers all the time.
[01:34:51.617 --> 01:34:53.379]  They buy into what he is saying.
[01:34:53.379 --> 01:34:54.460]  No, the public didn't buy it.
[01:34:55.080 --> 01:35:02.728]  I'm not the presenter of it, and then they point at people not buying media as if the problem, but Tom Brokaw says, watch how mean I can be.
[01:35:02.728 --> 01:35:12.758]  He knows he's making it up, and he shows off with his big pretty lie, the most original thing since anything, that I'm a racist.
[01:35:13.559 --> 01:35:18.261]  But to them, the definition of a racist is simply someone who's winning an argument with the progressive.
[01:35:18.261 --> 01:35:23.123]  Racism just means being against progressivism because for being progressive, race is the most important thing.
[01:35:23.123 --> 01:35:29.246]  So if you think of it as the fifth most important thing, by definition you're not thinking of it as important as you should and therefore you're racist.
[01:35:29.246 --> 01:35:33.688]  It's a term that just basically means heretic and it can be just dismissed with.
[01:35:33.688 --> 01:35:37.630]  And it's really a shame because racism is a problem and people should be concerned about it.
[01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:44.555]  But when you toss it around for someone who's against Obamacare or, you know, things like wars, it becomes absolutely meaningless.
[01:35:44.555 --> 01:35:45.695]  Just like the word rape.
[01:35:45.695 --> 01:35:46.896]  It has a very real meaning.
[01:35:46.896 --> 01:35:49.318]  Haven't they done real racists a favor?
[01:35:49.318 --> 01:35:53.941]  Yeah, and the hoaxes, the hate crime hoaxes that they do to divide the peoples.
[01:35:54.421 --> 01:35:59.182]  That's what they are doing now with their hoaxes and the media amplifying the hoaxes.
[01:35:59.182 --> 01:36:03.384]  They're actually trying to encourage copycat attackers to do these things.
[01:36:03.384 --> 01:36:09.345]  It's a PSYOP actually because there's a psychological principle which says people are going to copy which they see often enough.
[01:36:09.345 --> 01:36:14.026]  So they're doing hoaxes to try to incite actual violence against minorities.
[01:36:14.026 --> 01:36:16.087]  That is coming from the media, not from us.
[01:36:16.087 --> 01:36:17.848]  And they're also hyping kill, kill, kill.
[01:36:17.848 --> 01:36:19.028]  I want to ask Ollie when we come back.
[01:36:20.481 --> 01:36:21.582]  Obviously, the summer's here.
[01:36:21.582 --> 01:36:22.663]  They're really priming things.
[01:36:22.663 --> 01:36:24.865]  Soros is increasing it.
[01:36:24.865 --> 01:36:28.688]  How will civil unrest help the socialist, globalist movement?
[01:36:28.688 --> 01:36:29.950]  We'll talk about it straight ahead.
[01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:41.360]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:44.603]  Right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:36:57.182 --> 01:37:10.099]  All right, we're just about 13 minutes away from Dateline NBC, which has us all, oh, you know, they kind of baited the new media that's much bigger than them in the aggregate, much bigger than all mainstream media combined, into then lying about us to get us covering it.
[01:37:11.139 --> 01:37:13.261]  And sure, they've gotten stung, they've gotten some problems.
[01:37:13.261 --> 01:37:15.223]  Yeah, Megan's all freaked out.
[01:37:15.223 --> 01:37:18.045]  Sure, even mainstream media says it's a disaster.
[01:37:18.045 --> 01:37:19.246]  But we'll actually see.
[01:37:19.246 --> 01:37:21.028]  It's going to be horribly edited.
[01:37:21.028 --> 01:37:23.570]  They were here for more than 12 hours.
[01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:27.814]  I walked into their trap just to see what they would do, but they also walked into mine.
[01:37:27.814 --> 01:37:33.418]  But again, it doesn't show how strong we are, it shows how weak they are.
[01:37:33.418 --> 01:37:34.519]  Do any of you disagree with that?
[01:37:34.519 --> 01:37:37.242]  Michael Malice getting back to the big question after you commented on that.
[01:37:38.902 --> 01:37:49.145]  Just the shrill authoritarian calls for violence, the hatefulness, the ridiculousness, the petulance of the left and all of their hate.
[01:37:49.145 --> 01:37:53.427]  I mean, Trump hasn't done anything to them and they act like they're dying.
[01:37:53.427 --> 01:37:55.807]  So this just really shows how susceptible they are to media.
[01:37:55.807 --> 01:37:57.588]  But what do you expect to come this summer?
[01:37:58.348 --> 01:37:59.249]  They are dying.
[01:37:59.249 --> 01:38:01.111]  They're losing their grip on power.
[01:38:01.111 --> 01:38:02.413]  And this is freaking them out.
[01:38:02.413 --> 01:38:06.217]  Before they used to snap their fingers and people would do what they wanted and fall in line.
[01:38:06.217 --> 01:38:09.120]  Now they snap their fingers and people laugh or give them the finger.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:10.382]  And this is going to freak them out.
[01:38:10.382 --> 01:38:16.729]  Because one of the big selling points of the left is that if you join our club, you're going to be part of the masterclass.
[01:38:16.729 --> 01:38:18.771]  And now that they're in the minority in media,
[01:38:19.211 --> 01:38:22.833]  And in politics, they have much less to offer in terms of salesmanship.
[01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:24.053]  And that's going to terrify them.
[01:38:24.053 --> 01:38:25.093]  What he just said is total genius.
[01:38:25.093 --> 01:38:26.994]  Thought it would be the start of the whole show.
[01:38:26.994 --> 01:38:28.855]  Because it is like an elite class.
[01:38:28.855 --> 01:38:29.995]  They claim they're more educated.
[01:38:29.995 --> 01:38:31.596]  They claim they're more informed.
[01:38:31.596 --> 01:38:36.658]  Even though most of them are poorer than the average person, it's a feeling of nobility, of title.
[01:38:36.658 --> 01:38:42.800]  And they're mad because they're losing their title to the evil Midwestern hillbillies they have nightmares about.
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:44.141]  But they love jihadis.
[01:38:44.141 --> 01:38:46.182]  They love anything but the evil Americans.
[01:38:46.182 --> 01:38:46.822]  Sorry, Michael, go ahead.
[01:38:47.322 --> 01:38:58.748]  No, their whole mission in life is to let in the outsiders, and all the past, you know, Jim Goh talks about this, all the past contempt they had for black Americans has gone towards more whites, and the same stereotypes, they've just transferred.
[01:38:58.748 --> 01:39:01.970]  And the only way they know how to feel good about themselves is by looking down at someone else.
[01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:05.192]  That doesn't sound psychologically healthy, but it's certainly psychologically common.
[01:39:06.337 --> 01:39:11.283]  Oh, I've never heard any racism from Republicans, but growing up seeing Democrats, I mean, it is just amazing.
[01:39:11.283 --> 01:39:17.230]  And the whole point is they've just moved it into a whole new era and tried to get all the minorities hyped up with it.
[01:39:17.230 --> 01:39:18.672]  But I don't think people are buying it.
[01:39:18.672 --> 01:39:23.337]  And I think, I mean, we've seen fake polls, but clearly there's fake polls against Trump right now.
[01:39:23.337 --> 01:39:24.999]  And despite that, he's at 50 percent.
[01:39:25.885 --> 01:39:27.747]  Yeah, which is, again, the message isn't working.
[01:39:27.747 --> 01:39:36.534]  I mean, you know, Malice works, you know, a lot in publishing, and what I notice a lot is all the sneering from the fake news people go, oh, Cernovich, you self-published your book.
[01:39:36.534 --> 01:39:53.147]  And I thought, well, yeah, I sell more than you people, but they actually control publishing, so where a friend of mine, actually, he's a New York Times best-selling author, said, oh, you know, I actually went to them with a book proposal, I told them they should hire you, and they all laughed, and they said, you know, we would never want anything like that on our label, and they even delisted Milo.
[01:39:53.627 --> 01:39:56.049]  If you're too controversial, you're even kept out of publishing.
[01:39:56.049 --> 01:39:56.309]  That's right.
[01:39:56.309 --> 01:39:59.251]  They killed his book and it was number one on Amazon for months.
[01:39:59.251 --> 01:40:04.515]  And again, I know people that have sold millions and millions of dollars of books currently with big publishers.
[01:40:04.515 --> 01:40:06.296]  They don't even hardly pay you ever.
[01:40:06.296 --> 01:40:09.899]  It's smart when you can market yourself to self-publish.
[01:40:09.899 --> 01:40:17.224]  If you can sell hundreds of thousands of books like you've done, and they keep 90% of the money, instead of getting a dollar on each book, wow, you get $10 or $20.
[01:40:17.224 --> 01:40:18.785]  I mean, wow, you're dumb.
[01:40:18.785 --> 01:40:19.666]  You're dumb.
[01:40:19.666 --> 01:40:20.987]  You're on your own successful.
[01:40:20.987 --> 01:40:22.048]  What the hell's your problem?
[01:40:22.648 --> 01:40:31.417]  Well, my North Korea book, Dear Reader, I did it on Kickstarter, and because I'm an established author, the stigma wasn't there.
[01:40:31.417 --> 01:40:39.224]  It would have been there 20 years ago through self-publishing, but now, as bookstores are closing, there's an awareness that independent authors who are doing innovative things
[01:40:39.304 --> 01:40:48.749]  No, I'm not going to read your Dear Reader, which I have read, it's excellent and groundbreaking, because you self-did it and it's there and it's horrible.
[01:40:48.749 --> 01:40:53.271]  I only want someone that has had everything done for them.
[01:40:53.271 --> 01:40:58.573]  Wow, so look at what you guys have built with InfoWars from nothing and what we've built at Gab with nothing.
[01:40:58.573 --> 01:41:00.974]  We didn't take millions of dollars from venture capital.
[01:41:00.974 --> 01:41:02.075]  Tell folks about Gab, it's big.
[01:41:02.355 --> 01:41:05.416]  Yeah, so Gab is a free speech social network.
[01:41:05.416 --> 01:41:19.483]  We won't censor or filter things that, you know, we as a company deem, I guess, hate speech or harassment or all these other things that, you know, big social is guising as needing to be censored and needing to be shut up.
[01:41:19.483 --> 01:41:21.364]  So we're completely bootstrapped.
[01:41:21.624 --> 01:41:26.005]  We're completely supported by donations from our community and by our pro subscribers.
[01:41:26.005 --> 01:41:28.526]  So, you know, we don't need the establishment players.
[01:41:28.526 --> 01:41:33.908]  What we have done is sidelined them, you know, and that wouldn't have been possible 10 years ago.
[01:41:33.908 --> 01:41:35.469]  What we're doing today wouldn't have been possible.
[01:41:35.469 --> 01:41:38.470]  Now we have things like crowdfunding platforms, self-publishing platforms.
[01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:40.710]  You can start up a blog in five minutes.
[01:41:40.710 --> 01:41:42.971]  Everybody can have a voice, and they don't like that.
[01:41:42.971 --> 01:41:45.872]  Well, mainstream media is always relish killing.
[01:41:45.872 --> 01:41:48.453]  He's an internet TV radio host.
[01:41:49.153 --> 01:41:52.297]  Well, no, before that I was in diapers.
[01:41:52.297 --> 01:41:57.242]  I mean, yeah, when I was 21, I went and did AXS TV because the normal RTF route would take too long.
[01:41:57.242 --> 01:41:59.024]  And within six months, I had a local show.
[01:41:59.024 --> 01:42:01.086]  Within a year, I had a syndicated show.
[01:42:01.086 --> 01:42:03.029]  And so I'm on over 200 affiliates now.
[01:42:03.029 --> 01:42:04.390]  The media loves to downplay that number.
[01:42:07.315 --> 01:42:10.217]  I don't have any listeners, but they've got to talk about me all day.
[01:42:10.217 --> 01:42:13.319]  But the truth is, I started out in terrestrial radio.
[01:42:13.319 --> 01:42:16.180]  We've dominated in the free market of ideas on the internet.
[01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:17.941]  Isn't that the real sign of success?
[01:42:17.941 --> 01:42:19.422]  That I didn't have big backing?
[01:42:19.422 --> 01:42:20.123]  But no, no, no!
[01:42:20.123 --> 01:42:21.384]  That's a sign of my failure!
[01:42:21.384 --> 01:42:23.685]  Just like a sign of the failure of Michael Malice.
[01:42:23.925 --> 01:42:30.786]  You know, having a hit book that he self-published after being an establishment writer, or being published by an establishment, or just like you've been a trailblazer.
[01:42:30.786 --> 01:42:32.387]  Being a trailblazer is bad now.
[01:42:32.387 --> 01:42:33.367]  Right, exactly.
[01:42:33.367 --> 01:42:35.227]  And that is what the free market is all about.
[01:42:35.227 --> 01:42:38.888]  That's what the free marketplace of ideas is about, is the best ideas are always going to win.
[01:42:38.888 --> 01:42:45.249]  And when you have ideas that are better than others, the nature of censorship is that bad ideas cannot win.
[01:42:45.249 --> 01:42:47.249]  So they have to censor in order to shut up.
[01:42:47.249 --> 01:42:48.890]  They want to shut out your ideas in the marketplace.
[01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:51.230]  So, the real prognosis, Michael Malice, in closing.
[01:42:51.983 --> 01:43:03.571]  I think things are getting better and better, and people are waking up, and there's so many more opportunities for independent, smart people to put their message out there that it's impossible for them to put the genie out of the bottle, and that's why they're terrified.
[01:43:03.571 --> 01:43:04.972]  But they want a violent revolution.
[01:43:04.972 --> 01:43:06.733]  How bad's it get this summer?
[01:43:06.733 --> 01:43:10.456]  Well, the good guys have the guns, so I don't think I'm too worried about that.
[01:43:10.456 --> 01:43:15.219]  I escaped the Soviet Union, and I'm here to stay, so that's how it's gonna be.
[01:43:15.219 --> 01:43:18.482]  Which is why they're starting to do kind of a death dance, or like a ghost dance.
[01:43:19.878 --> 01:43:27.546]  Well, that's why they're trying to, again, rile people up and incite violence and to send subconscious messages to people all the day to incite violence.
[01:43:27.546 --> 01:43:30.870]  But, again, we're the ones who are against violence.
[01:43:30.870 --> 01:43:32.191]  We're the ones who want peace.
[01:43:32.191 --> 01:43:37.817]  They're the ones who want violence, but they want to let their little Antifa terrorists and their left-wing terrorists be the hatchet man.
[01:43:37.817 --> 01:43:40.460]  And then they go, oh, no, no, no, you can't blame us.
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:42.021]  But then anything somebody does
[01:43:42.862 --> 01:43:44.763]  They try to blame on us, which is fascinating.
[01:43:44.763 --> 01:43:47.804]  So the fake news media says, well, we're not responsible for this left-wing terrorism.
[01:43:47.804 --> 01:43:48.945]  We're not responsible for Antifa.
[01:43:48.945 --> 01:43:50.105]  How dare you?
[01:43:50.105 --> 01:43:55.327]  And they call that hateful rhetoric when we blame them for what they have actually done and incited.
[01:43:55.327 --> 01:44:01.830]  But then if one guy does something and maybe like your Facebook page one day, they're going to call you and say, oh, how can you have fans like this?
[01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:04.151]  Is your rhetoric radicalizing people?
[01:44:04.451 --> 01:44:14.978]  Well, Michael Malice, promise to come back on and talk about your book that I read, dealing with the Dear Leader, the unauthorized biography that's been such great reviews because of how deep and original it is.
[01:44:14.978 --> 01:44:20.842]  Because I want to understand why all the leftists say America's so bad, but they don't want to go to Venezuela or Cuba or North Korea.
[01:44:20.842 --> 01:44:24.145]  You don't see people running to go to the Dear Leader, do you, unless they're Dennis Rodman?
[01:44:24.745 --> 01:44:26.026]  Oh, no, sir, you do not.
[01:44:26.026 --> 01:44:27.567]  And it's the worst place on earth.
[01:44:27.567 --> 01:44:33.771]  And it's really a shame when people talk about, you know, people who listen to this show understand just how bad governments can get.
[01:44:33.771 --> 01:44:35.252]  It's the worst government on earth.
[01:44:35.252 --> 01:44:41.836]  And as Americans, we are almost blessed to be naive enough that we sometimes don't get just how evil a place like North Korea can be.
[01:44:41.836 --> 01:44:43.357]  And that's why I wrote my book to explain it.
[01:44:44.238 --> 01:44:46.219]  Alright, thank you so much, sir.
[01:44:46.219 --> 01:44:47.580]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:45:15.098 --> 01:45:17.680]  Then, you know, obviously tune in to NBC.
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.202]  If you still have rabbit ears or something, we're able to get that.
[01:45:21.202 --> 01:45:23.463]  But you guys are welcome to ride along.
[01:45:23.463 --> 01:45:26.344]  I'm going to have Roger Stone popping in with us.
[01:45:26.344 --> 01:45:27.745]  I have a sneaking suspicion.
[01:45:27.745 --> 01:45:29.766]  My money, it airs at the bottom of the hour.
[01:45:31.252 --> 01:45:31.972]  Tough call.
[01:45:31.972 --> 01:45:39.596]  They don't have a big lead-in to it, so they do want to suck people in and essentially use bait-and-switch tactics to con people to watch their car material.
[01:45:39.596 --> 01:45:46.559]  So, I would put it in the middle or towards the bottom of the hour for sure, because they want to ride the people and con the people for as long as they can.
[01:45:46.559 --> 01:45:47.860]  And the biggest thing is, it'll be like...
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.681]  He hated the family.
[01:45:49.681 --> 01:45:50.962]  And they'll keep playing it.
[01:45:50.962 --> 01:45:53.965]  On Father's Day, he wants to tell you bad things.
[01:45:53.965 --> 01:45:57.588]  So there'll be lots of juicy little promos.
[01:45:57.588 --> 01:45:58.789]  Yeah, and they'll keep cutting in.
[01:45:58.789 --> 01:46:00.130]  That's the whole point.
[01:46:00.130 --> 01:46:02.692]  They know that nobody wants to watch this trash that they do.
[01:46:03.473 --> 01:46:05.753]  So they're going to have to con people and say, come on in.
[01:46:05.753 --> 01:46:06.594]  It's like a US... That's right.
[01:46:06.594 --> 01:46:13.075]  As soon as the car races in, it'll be like, Alex Jones raped 5,000 babies and is the son of Satan.
[01:46:13.075 --> 01:46:15.255]  Coming up, you'll see him murder children.
[01:46:15.255 --> 01:46:18.416]  You know, I mean, it is just like the devil will be faced.
[01:46:18.416 --> 01:46:24.297]  We must ban the free speech of this man before more armed gunmen storm innocent facilities.
[01:46:24.297 --> 01:46:27.038]  He will meet the devil, Satan himself, Alex Jones.
[01:46:27.418 --> 01:46:28.260]  Coming online.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:38.239]  Hope the First Amendment is burned because it never existed and it's pure evil and racist and you heard Tom Brokaw so it's all coming up straight ahead and I've done two hours and haven't plugged.
[01:46:39.329 --> 01:46:45.494]  We're funded by you, great nutraceuticals, great products, free shipping still running at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:46:45.494 --> 01:46:49.517]  We're under attack, but most importantly, just spread the links, the articles, and the hashtag.
[01:46:49.517 --> 01:46:50.598]  What is it?
[01:46:50.598 --> 01:46:51.478]  JonesVKelly.
[01:46:51.478 --> 01:46:53.260]  J-O-N-E-S-V-Kelly.
[01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:54.501]  JonesVKelly.
[01:46:54.501 --> 01:46:55.041]  Hype it.
[01:46:55.041 --> 01:46:55.762]  I'm excited, man.
[01:46:55.762 --> 01:46:57.103]  Yeah, Facebook, Twitter, Google.
[01:46:57.103 --> 01:46:57.964]  Let everybody know.
[01:46:57.964 --> 01:47:02.207]  Alex Jones is about to cover Megyn Kelly's piece live.
[01:47:02.207 --> 01:47:05.750]  So spread those Facebook, Twitter, and Google YouTube videos right now.
[01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:07.151]  They're all on InfoWars.com.
[01:47:09.687 --> 01:47:18.612]  Will NBC finally pull the plug on Megyn Kelly's controversial interview with radio personality and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones?
[01:47:18.612 --> 01:47:24.216]  Megyn Kelly's been taking a lot of heat for interviewing radio show host Alex Jones.
[01:47:24.216 --> 01:47:27.518]  He is somebody who President Trump polled after the election to thank him.
[01:47:28.118 --> 01:47:31.319]  For his role, Trump had gone on his radio show during the campaign.
[01:47:31.319 --> 01:47:39.622]  Kelly and NBC are now under fire for giving airtime to the radio talk show host who has called the Sandy Hook school shooting a hoax.
[01:47:39.622 --> 01:47:42.062]  Megyn Kelly is jumping right back into the deep end.
[01:47:42.062 --> 01:47:47.664]  As NBC plans to air a sit-down interview with conspiracy hack Alex Jones this Sunday.
[01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:53.622]  Mr. Jones doesn't talk to a lot of reporters, but we're very glad he made an exception.
[01:47:53.622 --> 01:48:00.165]  When you say parents faked their children's death, people... Alright, explain what's happening is...
[01:48:01.252 --> 01:48:06.076]  I knew they'd open the show with it, but they were doing a promo intro, so we'll go back to our promo intro in a minute.
[01:48:06.076 --> 01:48:15.785]  They're going to back up on the DVR so you can see the intro almost in live time, and we can also fast forward as the piece goes ahead and opens up.
[01:48:15.785 --> 01:48:20.248]  But let's go ahead and roll with that as we analyze this Globals program.
[01:48:20.248 --> 01:48:20.529]  Here it is.
[01:48:25.718 --> 01:48:30.587]  More Americans watch NBC News than any other news organization in the world.
[01:48:30.587 --> 01:48:32.149]  That's not true.
[01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:34.012]  Welcome to Sunday Night.
[01:48:34.012 --> 01:48:34.653]  I'm Megyn Kelly.
[01:48:38.638 --> 01:48:43.399]  Pizzagate, as it's called, is a rabbit hole that is horrifying to go down.
[01:48:43.399 --> 01:48:46.861]  Alex Jones, the radical conspiracy theorist.
[01:48:46.861 --> 01:48:47.961]  I agree with Trump on that.
[01:48:47.961 --> 01:48:48.921]  He agrees with me.
[01:48:48.921 --> 01:48:53.683]  With a new and surprising level of influence, thanks in part to President Trump.
[01:48:53.683 --> 01:48:54.783]  I will not let you down.
[01:48:54.783 --> 01:48:55.563]  He's all pointed at Trump.
[01:48:55.563 --> 01:48:58.204]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:48:58.204 --> 01:49:03.206]  Tonight, we confront him on his notorious lie about the Sandy Hook massacre.
[01:49:03.206 --> 01:49:04.626]  Oh, this isn't a hit piece.
[01:49:04.626 --> 01:49:06.687]  Just where does he get his information?
[01:49:06.687 --> 01:49:07.227]  He's a liar.
[01:49:08.108 --> 01:49:17.526]  But if you haven't ascertained the veracity of that article, and it's all BS, then you've put out a bunch of misinformation.
[01:49:18.547 --> 01:49:18.647]  See?
[01:49:18.647 --> 01:49:19.588]  Oh, this isn't a gotcha interview.
[01:49:19.588 --> 01:49:20.168]  Oh, they go to him!
[01:49:20.168 --> 01:49:22.630]  They go to the guy that set up the big races with no proof!
[01:49:22.630 --> 01:49:24.732]  There's a lot of money to be made here.
[01:49:24.732 --> 01:49:24.852]  Nice!
[01:49:24.852 --> 01:49:25.052]  Awesome.
[01:49:25.052 --> 01:49:25.192]  Sweet!
[01:49:25.192 --> 01:49:25.993]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:49:25.993 --> 01:49:28.655]  NBC, what, got like three million taxpayer money in the stimulus package from Obama?
[01:49:28.655 --> 01:49:28.755]  Yeah.
[01:49:28.755 --> 01:49:30.456]  NBC gets your tax money at gunpoint with the IRS.
[01:49:48.630 --> 01:49:53.252]  They're going to say, he's just Dr. Feelgood.
[01:49:53.252 --> 01:49:56.734]  And then, Keith Morrison takes us... And then, I guess they're leading with me?
[01:49:56.734 --> 01:49:58.234]  Wow.
[01:49:58.234 --> 01:49:58.855]  Wow.
[01:49:58.855 --> 01:50:00.355]  That's shocking.
[01:50:00.355 --> 01:50:05.978]  ...where the hills are alive with the sound of Americans moving here in droves.
[01:50:05.978 --> 01:50:08.279]  This place is amazing and it's where I want to be.
[01:50:08.279 --> 01:50:13.261]  Find out where we are and see if you can spot a familiar face from some of your favorite movies.
[01:50:15.224 --> 01:50:17.066]  This is Sunday night.
[01:50:17.066 --> 01:50:18.787]  This is a load of BS from The Globalist.
[01:50:18.787 --> 01:50:22.410]  First tonight, our report on the incendiary radio host Alex Jones.
[01:50:22.410 --> 01:50:23.511]  Alright, rock and roll.
[01:50:23.511 --> 01:50:24.271]  Incendiary.
[01:50:24.271 --> 01:50:27.614]  For years, Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories.
[01:50:27.614 --> 01:50:29.755]  Claiming, for instance, that elements of the U.S.
[01:50:29.755 --> 01:50:36.401]  government allowed the 9-11 attacks to happen and that the horrific Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax.
[01:50:36.401 --> 01:50:37.702]  Saudi Arabia did it.
[01:50:37.702 --> 01:50:44.307]  Some thought we shouldn't broadcast this interview because his baseless allegations aren't just offensive, they're dangerous.
[01:50:45.387 --> 01:50:47.309]  But here's the thing.
[01:50:47.309 --> 01:50:48.971]  Alex Jones isn't going away.
[01:50:48.971 --> 01:50:54.897]  Over the years, the YouTube channel has racked up 1.3 billion views.
[01:50:54.897 --> 01:51:00.303]  He has millions of listeners in the ear of our current president.
[01:51:00.303 --> 01:51:05.369]  We begin our report with his reaction to the recent terrorist attack in Manchester, England.
[01:51:07.975 --> 01:51:10.937]  This is the part edited, when I said a lot of the trendies always get bombed at gay nightclubs.
[01:51:10.937 --> 01:51:13.358]  Now they're going to say that I knew it.
[01:51:13.358 --> 01:51:14.019]  Total hit piece.
[01:51:14.019 --> 01:51:14.899]  Remember she said it's not.
[01:51:14.899 --> 01:51:18.261]  A big bomb goes off at a pop star's rock concert bombing a bunch of liberal trendies.
[01:51:18.261 --> 01:51:19.142]  Notice they cut right there.
[01:51:35.572 --> 01:51:35.712]  Yes.
[01:51:35.712 --> 01:51:36.133]  That's true.
[01:51:36.133 --> 01:51:36.313]  Good.
[01:51:36.313 --> 01:51:36.994]  You got that message out.
[01:51:36.994 --> 01:51:39.437]  I know, I'm sorry I didn't blow him up.
[01:51:39.437 --> 01:51:42.160]  I know, but I did something bad though.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:43.281]  Oh wow, you think that's a jump cut.
[01:51:55.535 --> 01:51:56.576]  I got home at like six o'clock.
[01:52:10.732 --> 01:52:11.813]  Heard about it.
[01:52:11.813 --> 01:52:15.737]  The age of the victims weren't even known, but they were saying it was jihadi.
[01:52:15.737 --> 01:52:19.161]  And I said, how crazy is it that liberal trendies are now the victims?
[01:52:19.161 --> 01:52:21.042]  And then I start going and looking.
[01:52:21.042 --> 01:52:25.307]  Of course, if there's kids being killed by Muslims, I'm not saying that that it's their fault.
[01:52:25.307 --> 01:52:26.568]  That pattern.
[01:52:26.568 --> 01:52:26.948]  Reckless.
[01:52:26.948 --> 01:52:28.029]  That's a pattern.
[01:52:28.029 --> 01:52:29.571]  OK, but that's that's a fair clip.
[01:52:29.571 --> 01:52:30.131]  And excuse.
[01:52:30.131 --> 01:52:30.912]  That's not that bad.
[01:52:30.912 --> 01:52:32.354]  It's not exactly what I said.
[01:52:32.354 --> 01:52:33.515]  I know, but ballpark.
[01:52:34.395 --> 01:52:42.297]  He has spent nearly two decades on the fringe, shouting his conspiracy theories into any microphone he could get in front of.
[01:52:42.297 --> 01:52:47.638]  Here he is on Austin Community Television in 2001.
[01:52:47.638 --> 01:52:57.521]  He and his company InfoWars have been steadily gaining followers for years, producing radio shows and webcasts which reach millions a month.
[01:52:57.521 --> 01:52:59.381]  The Muslims blow up liberals.
[01:52:59.381 --> 01:53:00.201]  Why do liberals bring them in?
[01:53:00.201 --> 01:53:01.422]  That's totally true!
[01:53:03.442 --> 01:53:04.723]  Donald Trump.
[01:53:04.723 --> 01:53:07.644]  I just want to finish by saying your reputation's amazing.
[01:53:07.644 --> 01:53:07.864]  It is.
[01:53:07.864 --> 01:53:14.868]  In December 2015, Mr. Trump appeared on Jones' radio program, offering... It's all fine.
[01:53:14.868 --> 01:53:15.148]  Empty.
[01:53:15.148 --> 01:53:16.629]  I will not let you down.
[01:53:16.629 --> 01:53:20.151]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:53:20.151 --> 01:53:27.275]  And I think we'll be speaking a lot... Separately, both men had supported the false statement that Barack Obama was not a natural-born citizen.
[01:53:27.275 --> 01:53:29.636]  Oh, give me a break.
[01:53:29.636 --> 01:53:31.477]  And they've had more in common since.
[01:53:32.921 --> 01:53:34.041]  I agree with Trump on that.
[01:53:34.041 --> 01:53:34.682]  He agrees with me.
[01:53:34.682 --> 01:53:36.242]  Because I've got articles.
[01:53:36.242 --> 01:53:37.963]  He's following Alex on coal.
[01:53:37.963 --> 01:53:39.483]  He's following Alex on guns.
[01:53:39.483 --> 01:53:41.284]  He's following Alex on borders.
[01:53:41.284 --> 01:53:43.945]  Then I want him to say, no he's not.
[01:53:43.945 --> 01:53:46.085]  That's normal conservative libertarian ideas.
[01:53:46.085 --> 01:53:47.866]  That's deceptive right there.
[01:53:47.866 --> 01:53:49.586]  Cutting and editing.
[01:53:49.586 --> 01:53:52.707]  More than five times higher than the previous November.
[01:53:52.707 --> 01:53:57.469]  And when Mr. Trump won, Alex Jones found himself with access to the seat of power.
[01:53:58.209 --> 01:54:06.717]  Infowars got a temporary White House press pass for the first time, and Jones says Mr. Trump called him after the election to thank him for his help.
[01:54:06.717 --> 01:54:13.183]  You have said that it's surreal to say something on Infowars and then hear it come out of the President of the United States mouth a couple days later.
[01:54:13.183 --> 01:54:17.928]  I mean, that has happened, but... Do you think he's watching?
[01:54:18.712 --> 01:54:20.993]  I mean, I know Trump watches and sees the clips and things.
[01:54:20.993 --> 01:54:21.394]  How dare us!
[01:54:21.394 --> 01:54:22.174]  We actually witnessed...
[01:54:36.122 --> 01:54:40.704]  A drug smuggling operation from Mexico into the U.S.
[01:54:40.704 --> 01:54:44.005]  Three days later, Mr. Trump gave this speech in Iowa.
[01:54:44.005 --> 01:54:45.946]  Big stories all over the place now.
[01:54:45.946 --> 01:54:49.007]  Guys swimming across and big bags of stuff.
[01:54:49.007 --> 01:54:50.467]  So obvious!
[01:54:50.467 --> 01:54:51.428]  Swimming across.
[01:54:51.428 --> 01:54:52.128]  Conspiracy theorists.
[01:54:52.648 --> 01:54:53.289]  The river.
[01:54:53.289 --> 01:54:54.851]  Only NBC's allowed to fix drugs.
[01:54:54.851 --> 01:54:58.075]  I think she's going to show up and uh, on drugs though.
[01:54:58.075 --> 01:54:59.537]  She's going to be whacked up.
[01:54:59.537 --> 01:54:59.617]  Wow!
[01:54:59.617 --> 01:55:00.238]  We should take...
[01:55:08.334 --> 01:55:11.836]  A drug test, Brian, because I don't know what's going on with her!
[01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:33.265]  Donald's new secretary says Donald Trump would like to talk to you, Mr. Jones.
[01:55:33.265 --> 01:55:34.065]  Would you like to talk to him?
[01:55:34.065 --> 01:55:34.265]  Yes.
[01:55:34.265 --> 01:55:34.725]  Boom.
[01:55:34.725 --> 01:55:45.268]  While Jones has boasted of his contact with the president on his radio show, he downplayed it in his interview with us, claiming the mainstream media, or MSM, has exactly hit their connection.
[01:55:45.268 --> 01:55:45.729]  No, that was previous.
[01:55:45.729 --> 01:55:46.209]  I didn't downplay.
[01:55:46.209 --> 01:55:50.450]  My influence on Trump is way, way lower than what MSM has said.
[01:55:50.450 --> 01:55:51.790]  Well, what kind of access do you have?
[01:55:51.790 --> 01:55:54.691]  Did they put like a heat lamp over your head?
[01:55:54.691 --> 01:55:55.652]  Yeah, they did.
[01:55:55.652 --> 01:55:56.772]  Jesus.
[01:55:56.772 --> 01:55:59.913]  Would you describe yourself as friends?
[01:55:59.913 --> 01:55:59.993]  No.
[01:56:00.842 --> 01:56:01.222]  Friendly?
[01:56:01.222 --> 01:56:03.323]  Sure.
[01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:05.003]  And how many times has he called you?
[01:56:05.003 --> 01:56:07.224]  I don't want to get into all that.
[01:56:07.224 --> 01:56:11.645]  What is it, do you think, about Alex Jones that President Trump finds so amazing?
[01:56:11.645 --> 01:56:13.146]  That's a scary question.
[01:56:13.146 --> 01:56:15.186]  Charlie Sykes is a conservative writer.
[01:56:15.186 --> 01:56:17.907]  Another, another Trumper.
[01:56:17.907 --> 01:56:20.388]  He's a rhino that's helped control the country into a rat hole.
[01:56:21.288 --> 01:56:29.351]  ...turn in the president's thinking and his imagination, and those darker impulses are fed into by Alex Jones.
[01:56:29.351 --> 01:56:33.813]  Jones speaks to his listeners for hours a day, six days a week.
[01:56:33.813 --> 01:56:39.435]  His rants can be vulgar and hate-filled, like this one directed at a member of Congress.
[01:56:39.435 --> 01:56:42.676]  Schiff looks like the archetype archetypal...
[01:56:43.456 --> 01:56:50.598]  He grew up the oldest child of a dentist and a homemaker and went to high school in Austin, Texas.
[01:57:10.302 --> 01:57:10.582]  Bill Hecks.
[01:57:10.582 --> 01:57:11.023]  That's Bill Hecks.
[01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:11.463]  Community College.
[01:57:11.463 --> 01:57:12.905]  What, you idiots couldn't think of that?
[01:57:29.986 --> 01:57:31.887]  But he's now worth millions.
[01:57:31.887 --> 01:57:33.068]  I'm Alex Jones, your host!
[01:57:33.068 --> 01:57:37.630]  InfoWars makes most of its money by selling products, like mail supplements.
[01:57:37.630 --> 01:57:39.591]  It has just come off... That is a joke.
[01:57:39.591 --> 01:57:42.132]  Soon, there'll be nothing left.
[01:57:42.132 --> 01:57:43.553]  The main pitchman?
[01:57:43.553 --> 01:57:44.313]  Jones himself.
[01:57:44.313 --> 01:57:47.595]  I mean, it costs 45, 50 million dollars a year to run that.
[01:57:47.595 --> 01:57:48.335]  How much money is being made?
[01:57:49.659 --> 01:57:51.922]  Well, the money that's made is pretty much put back into things.
[01:57:51.922 --> 01:57:52.523]  I don't like that.
[01:57:52.523 --> 01:57:54.425]  I'm looking at the camera, I'm saying.
[01:57:54.425 --> 01:57:57.048]  I like how they put that heat nozzle in your head though.
[01:57:57.048 --> 01:57:57.969]  That was a good move.
[01:58:04.366 --> 01:58:05.907]  That was smarter though.
[01:58:05.907 --> 01:58:08.329]  That's like a level up, we gotta watch out for that.
[01:58:08.329 --> 01:58:12.673]  They're gonna put a heat lamp on you and just try to get you to look like the slutty guy, yeah.
[01:58:12.673 --> 01:58:14.234]  This guy's such a loser.
[01:58:14.234 --> 01:58:16.877]  Nobody cares what he has to say as long as he has to come in and hate on you.
[01:58:16.877 --> 01:58:19.779]  That's the only way he's- Oh, we're back with Gany, here we go.
[01:58:19.779 --> 01:58:30.428]  Outrageous statement that the slaughter of innocent children and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School, one of the darkest chapters in American history, was a hoax.
[01:58:30.428 --> 01:58:31.209]  Babies in the incubators.
[01:58:31.209 --> 01:58:32.169]  I lost my son.
[01:58:33.190 --> 01:58:35.172]  I buried my son.
[01:58:35.172 --> 01:58:38.374]  I held my son with a bullet hole through his head.
[01:58:38.374 --> 01:58:42.537]  Neil Heslin's son, Jesse, just six years old, was murdered.
[01:58:42.537 --> 01:58:45.919]  See, they started with saying I didn't care about people at Manchester.
[01:58:45.919 --> 01:58:50.402]  But at least they didn't say it happened.
[01:58:50.402 --> 01:58:51.823]  I dropped them off in 904.
[01:58:51.823 --> 01:58:54.945]  That's when we dropped them off at school.
[01:58:54.945 --> 01:58:57.587]  And notice she's not playing all the clips where I've said I think it happened.
[01:58:57.587 --> 01:58:59.328]  And I said it in the tape.
[01:58:59.328 --> 01:59:00.809]  You called this whole playbook?
[01:59:00.809 --> 01:59:01.830]  It wasn't hard to do.
[01:59:03.559 --> 01:59:07.620]  Alex Jones repeatedly claimed that the shooting never happened.
[01:59:07.620 --> 01:59:11.041]  And then I would go through all the different theories.
[01:59:11.041 --> 01:59:16.443]  But it took me about a year with Sandy Hook to come to grips with the fact that the whole thing was fake.
[01:59:16.443 --> 01:59:19.524]  You said, the whole thing is a giant hoax.
[01:59:19.524 --> 01:59:21.545]  How do you deal with a total hoax?
[01:59:21.545 --> 01:59:28.207]  It took me about a year with Sandy Hook to come to grips with the fact that the whole thing was fake.
[01:59:28.207 --> 01:59:32.328]  I did deep research and my gosh, it just pretty much didn't happen.
[01:59:34.373 --> 01:59:38.954]  At that point, and I do think there's some cover-up and some manipulation, that is pretty much what I believe.
[01:59:38.954 --> 01:59:44.076]  But then I was also going into Devil's Advocate, but then we know there's mass shootings and these things happen.
[01:59:44.076 --> 01:59:46.897]  So again... You're trying to have it always, right?
[01:59:46.897 --> 01:59:47.617]  No, I'm not!
[01:59:47.617 --> 01:59:51.238]  If you wrongly went out there and said it was a hoax, that's wrong!
[01:59:51.238 --> 01:59:56.359]  But what I already answered your question was, listeners and other people are covering this.
[01:59:56.359 --> 01:59:57.560]  I didn't create that story.
[01:59:57.560 --> 02:00:01.301]  But Alex, the parents, one after the other,
[02:00:03.254 --> 02:00:03.935]  Devastated.
[02:00:03.935 --> 02:00:07.458]  The dead bodies that the coroner autopsied.
[02:00:07.458 --> 02:00:08.479]  And they blocked all that?
[02:00:08.479 --> 02:00:09.640]  They won't release any of it?
[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:10.641]  That's unprecedented?
[02:00:10.641 --> 02:00:15.465]  All of the parents decided to come out and lie about their dead children?
[02:00:15.465 --> 02:00:16.166]  I didn't say that.
[02:00:16.166 --> 02:00:17.507]  What happened to the children?
[02:00:17.507 --> 02:00:22.131]  I will sit there on the air and look at every position and play devil's advocate.
[02:00:22.131 --> 02:00:24.253]  Was that devil's advocate?
[02:00:24.253 --> 02:00:26.075]  The whole thing is a giant hoax.
[02:00:26.075 --> 02:00:26.876]  The whole thing was fake.
[02:00:29.855 --> 02:00:34.637]  Yes, because I remember in... Well, they start to remember everything you say hours a day.
[02:00:34.637 --> 02:00:40.839]  Some of it looks like it's real, but then what do you do when they've got the kids going in circles in and out of the building with their hands up?
[02:00:40.839 --> 02:00:43.180]  I've watched the footage, and it looks like a drill.
[02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:44.281]  When you say...
[02:00:46.738 --> 02:00:49.981]  Parents faked their children's death.
[02:00:49.981 --> 02:00:51.283]  People get very angry.
[02:00:51.283 --> 02:00:56.728]  Yeah, well, let's... Oh, I know, but they don't get angry about the half million dead Iraqis from the sanctions, or they don't get angry about all the illegal spilling in.
[02:00:56.728 --> 02:00:57.309]  That's a dodge.
[02:00:57.309 --> 02:00:58.530]  No, no, it's not a dodge.
[02:00:58.530 --> 02:01:01.874]  The media never covers all the evil wars it's promoted, all the big things.
[02:01:01.874 --> 02:01:04.276]  That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown.
[02:01:04.276 --> 02:01:05.057]  You know it.
[02:01:05.057 --> 02:01:05.617]  Here's the difference.
[02:01:06.343 --> 02:01:07.845]  Here's the difference.
[02:01:07.845 --> 02:01:14.852]  I looked at all the angles of Newtown, and I made my statements long before the media even picked up on it.
[02:01:14.852 --> 02:01:17.935]  In our interview, we asked Jones numerous times... See, there's the key.
[02:01:17.935 --> 02:01:18.996]  I went on and explained.
[02:01:18.996 --> 02:01:20.958]  I said I thought it happened before you were picked up.
[02:01:20.958 --> 02:01:22.559]  And they never showed my final analysis.
[02:01:22.559 --> 02:01:25.582]  I tend to believe that children probably did die there.
[02:01:25.582 --> 02:01:29.586]  But then you look at all the other evidence on the other side... You just said you believe children died there.
[02:01:30.387 --> 02:01:30.928]  Right?
[02:01:30.928 --> 02:01:31.689]  That's amazing.
[02:01:31.689 --> 02:01:33.471]  But they just waited and put it in later.
[02:01:33.471 --> 02:01:34.812]  It was always about Newtown.
[02:01:34.812 --> 02:01:35.793]  She came here.
[02:01:35.793 --> 02:01:36.834]  All of it.
[02:01:36.834 --> 02:01:37.575]  She lied to me.
[02:01:37.575 --> 02:01:40.799]  I have a tape of it and told me it wasn't true.
[02:01:40.799 --> 02:01:42.621]  Just like this whole edit's a lie, all of it's a lie.
[02:01:49.208 --> 02:01:54.652]  Almost four months later, according to the board chairman... The president won't disavow Alex Jones.
[02:01:54.652 --> 02:01:56.112]  Now that'll be the story.
[02:01:56.112 --> 02:01:59.334]  The pressure now... They want me to get mad if Trump disavows me.
[02:01:59.334 --> 02:01:59.735]  Trump!
[02:01:59.735 --> 02:02:00.335]  Disavow her!
[02:02:00.335 --> 02:02:00.755]  Go ahead.
[02:02:00.755 --> 02:02:06.459]  A Florida woman was sentenced to five months in prison for sending death threats to a Sandy Hook parent.
[02:02:06.459 --> 02:02:10.822]  Her defense attorney says she was primarily motivated by info wars.
[02:02:11.782 --> 02:02:15.665]  Everything's my fault.
[02:02:15.665 --> 02:02:19.148]  We knew this, it'll be Alex Jones is causing threats, he needs to be banned.
[02:02:19.148 --> 02:02:23.472]  Even though I've said for years I think it happened, and sent a video out today saying that.
[02:02:23.472 --> 02:02:25.733]  They're the ones who see Father's Day.
[02:02:25.733 --> 02:02:27.675]  They open it up, and it's my fault.
[02:02:27.675 --> 02:02:29.296]  I think he's blessed to have his children.
[02:02:41.112 --> 02:02:43.193]  To spend the day with?
[02:02:43.193 --> 02:02:43.954]  To speak to?
[02:02:43.954 --> 02:02:49.737]  Um... I don't have that.
[02:02:49.737 --> 02:02:50.077]  Wow.
[02:02:50.077 --> 02:02:51.297]  I hear you.
[02:02:58.388 --> 02:03:01.730]  Is a rabbit hole that is horrifying to go down now.
[02:03:01.730 --> 02:03:03.731]  In 2016, Jones promoted a conspiracy.
[02:03:03.731 --> 02:03:04.912]  He told you they covered it up?
[02:03:04.912 --> 02:03:06.433]  Promoted though, they didn't say I created it.
[02:03:06.433 --> 02:03:09.275]  I covered the story that the New York Times covered too.
[02:03:09.275 --> 02:03:10.875]  And WaPo and everybody covered it up.
[02:03:10.875 --> 02:03:14.337]  And specifically pointed to a Washington D.C.
[02:03:14.337 --> 02:03:14.858]  pizzeria.
[02:03:14.858 --> 02:03:15.598]  How long is this?
[02:03:15.598 --> 02:03:17.299]  You've got to go to infowars.com and actually check it out.
[02:03:17.299 --> 02:03:18.740]  I knew they'd have to make it even longer.
[02:03:18.740 --> 02:03:19.260]  They said it was 11.
[02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:20.621]  This is going to be a half hour.
[02:03:20.621 --> 02:03:23.423]  He urged his listeners to investigate the case themselves.
[02:03:24.966 --> 02:03:26.987]  Oh, because I said investigate.
[02:03:26.987 --> 02:03:27.387]  Right.
[02:03:27.387 --> 02:03:31.348]  A month after I said it was a hoax, some guy goes in there that's an actor.
[02:03:31.348 --> 02:03:32.368]  Who's admittedly an actor.
[02:03:32.368 --> 02:03:34.449]  They've been indicted for stuff.
[02:03:34.449 --> 02:03:37.310]  Well, he had other criminal charges going in.
[02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:39.150]  He had criminal charges pending against him already.
[02:03:39.150 --> 02:03:41.031]  And he's a known actor.
[02:03:41.511 --> 02:03:43.273]  Well, yeah, the IMDb profile, I think.
[02:03:43.273 --> 02:03:43.873]  Fan the lie.
[02:03:43.873 --> 02:03:44.354]  See, I told him.
[02:03:44.354 --> 02:03:45.735]  I did not create the story.
[02:04:01.124 --> 02:04:05.787]  Well that story was covered about the refugees causing tuberculosis, which is a true story.
[02:04:05.787 --> 02:04:09.410]  The company didn't bring him in, the owner did.
[02:04:09.410 --> 02:04:13.733]  And not the particular sex assault people, just the point is he's promoting the refugees.
[02:04:13.733 --> 02:04:20.737]  So it's in the news, I cover what's in the news, they know I'm a target, so it's put out in the news that I created the whole Chobani controversy.
[02:04:20.737 --> 02:04:21.838]  So it's your fault.
[02:04:21.838 --> 02:04:26.301]  So then we're very happy with the settlement, I'll just leave it at that.
[02:04:26.301 --> 02:04:29.043]  I'm gonna let you get it, I just want to make sure the record's straight because I don't want to smear the man.
[02:04:29.631 --> 02:04:33.174]  You are the one who said that you were wrong about Chobani.
[02:04:33.174 --> 02:04:34.655]  You said that.
[02:04:34.655 --> 02:04:47.284]  Well, that's because they chose to go after me, and so I simply pointed out that we were reporting other people's reports that were not entirely accurate, and for that we were sorry, because it was true.
[02:04:47.284 --> 02:04:50.867]  You don't sound very sorry.
[02:04:50.867 --> 02:04:53.268]  Well, the media said stuff about the settlement that wasn't true.
[02:04:55.879 --> 02:04:59.880]  You said things about Chobani and its owner that were not true.
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:00.540]  Are you sorry?
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:01.841]  Well, he works for the Federal Reserve.
[02:05:01.841 --> 02:05:02.781]  I'll say it again.
[02:05:02.781 --> 02:05:06.562]  The media really was upset that they said that there was a hoax.
[02:05:06.562 --> 02:05:07.542]  It's not the media.
[02:05:07.542 --> 02:05:09.423]  You are you sorry?
[02:05:09.423 --> 02:05:18.845]  And so what they did, so what the media did, and we know it was the media, and we have the PIs and the law firms and we're working on it right now.
[02:05:18.845 --> 02:05:21.686]  Let's just say Chobani was real happy to get out of that lawsuit.
[02:05:22.498 --> 02:05:30.361]  But the lawsuit makes clear InfoWars was the only media outlet to report the lie that forced Jones to apologize.
[02:05:30.361 --> 02:05:33.822]  And with that apology, Chobani considers the matter closed.
[02:05:33.822 --> 02:05:35.343]  Do you think of yourself as a journalist?
[02:05:37.324 --> 02:05:44.586]  In other words, Shabani won't give a comment.
[02:05:44.586 --> 02:05:47.686]  In the InfoWars studio, there's no script.
[02:05:47.686 --> 02:05:52.027]  Instead, it's a freewheeling spin through piles of articles, straight off the internet.
[02:05:52.027 --> 02:05:57.288]  95% of what we cover is looking at a news article, and then reading it.
[02:05:57.288 --> 02:05:58.269]  It's a nice stream.
[02:05:58.269 --> 02:05:59.529]  No, I didn't look at that.
[02:05:59.529 --> 02:06:00.669]  I did look at that.
[02:06:00.669 --> 02:06:01.849]  I looked at that, though.
[02:06:01.849 --> 02:06:03.870]  Notice how they're zooming in on you real close, too?
[02:06:03.870 --> 02:06:04.030]  Oh, yeah.
[02:06:04.970 --> 02:06:08.992]  And it's all BS, and then you spend two hours talking about it, then you put out a bunch of misinformation.
[02:06:08.992 --> 02:06:10.573]  I'm just trying to figure out what the vetting process is.
[02:06:10.573 --> 02:06:13.655]  I mean, we all get Hillary was 15 points ahead, okay?
[02:06:13.655 --> 02:06:18.137]  I mean, we all get mainstream media has got a big problem.
[02:06:18.137 --> 02:06:25.340]  The InfoWars staffers we met have free reign to cover whatever they like, with virtually no oversight.
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:28.942]  We spoke with some of Jones's employees, including Owen Schroyer.
[02:06:28.942 --> 02:06:32.044]  How do you, on a day-to-day basis, figure out what you're gonna do?
[02:06:34.029 --> 02:06:37.491]  I wake up, I look at the news, I pray.
[02:06:37.491 --> 02:06:40.552]  I rarely get directives from Alex or my boss.
[02:06:40.552 --> 02:06:41.953]  They pretty much just leave it up to me.
[02:06:41.953 --> 02:06:44.934]  Is that what you consider yourself to be, a journalist?
[02:06:44.934 --> 02:06:47.355]  You know, I don't like calling it that.
[02:06:47.355 --> 02:06:48.495]  I'm just a human.
[02:06:48.495 --> 02:06:50.096]  I'm just a human that's looking for truth.
[02:06:50.096 --> 02:06:53.698]  So I'm trying to reach out and be what the people want.
[02:06:53.698 --> 02:06:55.999]  When you say people, who do you mean?
[02:06:55.999 --> 02:06:57.259]  The deplorables.
[02:06:57.259 --> 02:06:58.360]  The flyover country.
[02:06:58.360 --> 02:06:59.140]  The forgotten American.
[02:07:00.071 --> 02:07:03.453]  We're going to get to work immediately for the American people.
[02:07:03.453 --> 02:07:09.016]  With the election of Donald Trump, Alex Jones has plans to expand InfoWars.
[02:07:09.016 --> 02:07:14.079]  More studios, more shows, more employees, more influence.
[02:07:14.079 --> 02:07:17.861]  I said the night he won, I said the war has just begun.
[02:07:17.861 --> 02:07:22.504]  So this is a, we just got a beachhead, and so that's just the start of the war for me.
[02:07:23.815 --> 02:07:27.437]  And Alex Jones goes into battle with a powerful ally.
[02:07:27.437 --> 02:07:32.741]  Just two weeks ago, the Trump-Pence campaign emailed this message to supporters.
[02:07:32.741 --> 02:07:34.822]  Notice at the bottom.
[02:07:34.822 --> 02:07:39.225]  It's a link to InfoWars.
[02:07:39.225 --> 02:07:43.287]  Stop singing and saying kill everybody and financing plays to kill the president.
[02:07:43.287 --> 02:07:46.910]  Speech and responsibility.
[02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:48.911]  That's what the whole thing was about, tying you to Trump.
[02:07:48.911 --> 02:07:50.172]  So now Tom Brokaw's coming on?
[02:07:52.288 --> 02:07:54.210]  Who literally... I wanted to get Roger on.
[02:07:54.210 --> 02:07:56.851]  I invited Roger on, but I didn't know the piece would air right up front.
[02:07:56.851 --> 02:07:58.373]  So Roger's been holding for 30 minutes.
[02:07:58.373 --> 02:07:58.853]  Did he have to go?
[02:07:58.853 --> 02:08:02.816]  We're going to Roger Stone right now.
[02:08:02.816 --> 02:08:03.756]  I've got to say this, though.
[02:08:03.756 --> 02:08:05.958]  I pledge to everyone.
[02:08:05.958 --> 02:08:06.819]  I used to be fat.
[02:08:06.819 --> 02:08:08.099]  I've lost like 60-something pounds.
[02:08:08.099 --> 02:08:09.320]  I have a big head.
[02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:11.382]  But folks, I don't look like that.
[02:08:11.382 --> 02:08:13.223]  They did have some heat lamp over me.
[02:08:13.223 --> 02:08:13.643]  I remember that.
[02:08:13.643 --> 02:08:15.385]  Like, what is that red lamp above me?
[02:08:15.385 --> 02:08:17.706]  But the whole point is they lied about everything.
[02:08:17.706 --> 02:08:18.427]  They did this.
[02:08:18.427 --> 02:08:19.828]  It's all about wounding the president.
[02:08:21.192 --> 02:08:25.077]  I think she's about to come back with Tom Brokaw, so be ready.
[02:08:25.077 --> 02:08:26.578]  And Roger Stone joins us.
[02:08:26.578 --> 02:08:32.966]  Tom Brokaw has said, I'm deeply racist, so they've called in the old hand to come after me.
[02:08:32.966 --> 02:08:34.188]  What do you make of this, Roger Stone?
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:46.247]  Well, Alex, you've clearly gotten under the skin of the globalists and those who seek to remove our president, those who opposed him.
[02:08:46.247 --> 02:08:53.552]  Believe me, they would not be trying to deconstruct this kind of character assassination if you weren't effective.
[02:08:53.552 --> 02:08:55.454]  I think they realize freedom's on the march.
[02:08:56.014 --> 02:08:56.214]  Exactly.
[02:08:56.214 --> 02:08:59.456]  I mean, I sit here mainly and play clips of where they're saying outrageous stuff.
[02:08:59.456 --> 02:09:02.577]  I mean, most of what we do is just right there in everybody's face.
[02:09:23.514 --> 02:09:33.302]  It is, you know, the way they have you lit, this lighting you from underneath with a flashlight, they're trying to make you look like the devil, like Lucifer.
[02:09:33.302 --> 02:09:35.023]  They've got the heat cranked up.
[02:09:35.023 --> 02:09:39.427]  They're doing this late at night after you put in a full day's work.
[02:09:39.427 --> 02:09:42.729]  I mean, it's the most obvious hatchet job that I've seen.
[02:09:42.729 --> 02:09:49.295]  On the other hand, I predict openly right now, the InfoWars audience will only grow.
[02:09:50.632 --> 02:09:51.293]  I agree.
[02:09:51.293 --> 02:09:55.838]  Other than having to look at a wet walrus for, you know, 30 minutes, 20 minutes, it's been pretty powerful.
[02:09:55.838 --> 02:10:01.964]  What do you predict old Tom Brokaw, who used the original term, I'm totally racist, a few days ago?
[02:10:01.964 --> 02:10:08.871]  We didn't know he was the secret old gladiator they brought in when Maximus had already wiped them all out, which is you guys.
[02:10:08.871 --> 02:10:10.473]  This is getting too ridiculous.
[02:10:10.473 --> 02:10:11.754]  Oh, she's back.
[02:10:11.754 --> 02:10:12.075]  He's back.
[02:10:12.075 --> 02:10:12.475]  Let's go to her.
[02:10:12.475 --> 02:10:13.216]  Stay there, Roger.
[02:10:14.942 --> 02:10:17.624]  Oh, I get it.
[02:10:17.624 --> 02:10:20.165]  They didn't flagpole it.
[02:10:20.165 --> 02:10:24.367]  They didn't put it at the end.
[02:10:24.367 --> 02:10:25.027]  That's what they said.
[02:10:25.027 --> 02:10:33.232]  They're gonna have up front and then the end, Dan Rather, I mean, Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw, he comes in to like further do it.
[02:10:33.232 --> 02:10:34.973]  Right.
[02:10:34.973 --> 02:10:38.014]  Wow, so the big superstar here out of retirement, Roger Stone, is
[02:10:40.515 --> 02:11:08.634]  It's kind of obvious, though, because since Megyn Kelly has no credibility publicly, since you have, I think, artfully destroyed her credibility in the last week, and by openly exposing the edits and the various tricks that they use to take you out of context, to twist your words, to put words in your mouth, they had to pull this guy out to try to borrow his credibility because she has none.
[02:11:09.938 --> 02:11:13.344]  You know, I think moving to NBC is a slippery slope.
[02:11:13.344 --> 02:11:15.629]  This is the next step to oblivion.
[02:11:15.629 --> 02:11:20.318]  I doubt, other than the show that you're on, Alex, he's going to get any ratings at all.
[02:11:21.001 --> 02:11:24.402]  You know, she, just from the time I saw her last, looks like a wet cat.
[02:11:24.402 --> 02:11:26.803]  If you put a video, maybe back that up to her.
[02:11:26.803 --> 02:11:29.705]  And I've heard from sources at NBC, she's just catatonic.
[02:11:29.705 --> 02:11:31.385]  I'm not feeling powerful, I'm sad.
[02:11:31.385 --> 02:11:34.206]  I don't know what Megyn Kelly thought was going to happen here.
[02:11:34.206 --> 02:11:40.589]  I mean, you know, she definitely gave as good as she got, but she's on tape fawning over me, worshipping me basically, which is pathetic.
[02:11:40.589 --> 02:11:42.610]  It was clearly, you know, made up.
[02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:47.071]  I thought she was trying to sell me a table dance.
[02:11:47.071 --> 02:11:52.032]  So they had to literally bring Tom Brokaw, when I was a kid watching him on TV, I can't believe this actually happened.
[02:11:52.032 --> 02:11:58.593]  If I would have thought they were going to bring him out of retirement to come out and call me a racist and then put him on the show to attack me.
[02:11:58.593 --> 02:12:00.714]  This is Twilight Zone, Roger Stone!
[02:12:00.714 --> 02:12:03.134]  It's also the fallback, you see.
[02:12:03.134 --> 02:12:10.076]  Whenever they can't argue anything out on the merits, they move immediately to name-call it.
[02:12:11.269 --> 02:12:15.010]  I mean, I'm so sick of being called a racist.
[02:12:15.010 --> 02:12:21.271]  I marched with Al Sherbet and Andrew Cuomo and Russell Simmons for drug law reform.
[02:12:21.271 --> 02:12:23.912]  So did I. I protested the KKK.
[02:12:23.912 --> 02:12:24.332]  All of it.
[02:12:24.332 --> 02:12:26.612]  It means nothing to these people.
[02:12:26.612 --> 02:12:27.893]  Well, they're not interested in facts.
[02:12:27.893 --> 02:12:35.954]  They're just interested in name-calling because it's a way to cut off the debate and discredit you without having any factual arguments.
[02:12:35.954 --> 02:12:36.594]  Let me ask you this.
[02:12:36.594 --> 02:12:38.295]  I want to ask both of you this, guys.
[02:12:38.295 --> 02:12:39.375]  All three of you.
[02:12:40.512 --> 02:12:50.524]  We all saw May 3rd clip, C-SPAN, June 8th clip, where Comey said nobody tried to influence me, including the President, nobody obstructed justice, nobody ordered me to stop the investigation.
[02:12:50.524 --> 02:12:59.735]  Then they have New York Times, Washington Post articles saying I'm a liar, Jack Subbitt's a liar, Roger Stone's a liar, you're a liar by name, Mike Cernovich.
[02:13:00.356 --> 02:13:06.538]  Saying we actually made, and then they show transcripts of what we made up, that's the word for word that happened.
[02:13:06.538 --> 02:13:16.641]  These are the biggest fake, I mean, in the old days, like a year ago, if you're gonna call somebody totally racist, you better have the clip of them at the KKK meeting or saying something.
[02:13:16.641 --> 02:13:21.043]  Since when do they triple down into total fake news and then say we are?
[02:13:22.034 --> 02:13:24.134]  I think most people don't investigate that type of thing.
[02:13:24.134 --> 02:13:25.975]  They take what they say at face value.
[02:13:25.975 --> 02:13:30.516]  So that's where they get their power from, is that the majority of people out there aren't looking into this.
[02:13:30.516 --> 02:13:33.916]  They're not looking for the clip to try to prove that, hey, this guy is a racist.
[02:13:33.916 --> 02:13:35.757]  So that's where they get their power from.
[02:13:35.757 --> 02:13:43.498]  Why would I want to be a racist anyways when my sister's adopted Korean, and I'm not going to get the rest of my family, and I'm part Native American, plus half the country's Hispanic.
[02:13:43.498 --> 02:13:46.759]  It's about to be like 70% by the time I'm an old man.
[02:13:46.759 --> 02:13:48.699]  Why would I just want to hate everybody I'm around?
[02:13:49.259 --> 02:13:50.981]  Plus, it doesn't matter.
[02:13:50.981 --> 02:13:51.922]  Where's the proof?
[02:13:51.922 --> 02:13:54.785]  They're the ones race baiting constantly, Roger.
[02:13:54.785 --> 02:13:57.268]  Roger Stone only asked you this, Cernovich.
[02:13:57.268 --> 02:13:58.610]  How far does this race baiting go?
[02:13:58.610 --> 02:14:00.392]  Because I am so sick of it.
[02:14:01.394 --> 02:14:03.617]  People aren't believing it anymore, that's the whole thing.
[02:14:03.617 --> 02:14:13.888]  People will do their own research, do their own homework, and every time they hear... They're honestly, if you were a real racist... They call you a racist and your wife's Persian!
[02:14:13.888 --> 02:14:14.649]  A beautiful lady!
[02:14:14.649 --> 02:14:21.697]  I'll be honest with you, if you were a real racist, you would be very happy today, because you could hide under the radar because now everybody's being called a racist.
[02:14:21.697 --> 02:14:22.498]  So if you were actually...
[02:14:22.978 --> 02:14:30.205]  And the KKK, because everybody's called a racist, they wouldn't even believe it when you pointed out the guy who's actually doing the bad thing.
[02:14:30.205 --> 02:14:35.331]  So, the media's doing a real disservice to people, because if everybody's a racist, then nobody's a racist.
[02:14:35.331 --> 02:14:35.491]  Right.
[02:14:38.363 --> 02:14:45.889]  You know, Alex, I think this tactic worked well when the mainstream media had a monopoly on political discourse.
[02:14:45.889 --> 02:14:56.498]  When they owned the three networks and then ultimately the two cable news networks, and there was no rebuttal from any place, you could brand anybody as a racist or an anti-Semite.
[02:14:57.373 --> 02:15:07.304]  Now that we have a vibrant and robust alternative media, and these things get actively rebutted, I don't think the tactic is working.
[02:15:07.304 --> 02:15:10.547]  That's why they're so desperate to censor the internet.
[02:15:10.547 --> 02:15:11.128]  I agree.
[02:15:11.128 --> 02:15:13.551]  So let me ask you all three this question.
[02:15:14.921 --> 02:15:18.042]  What happens to Megyn Kelly as a bellwether?
[02:15:18.042 --> 02:15:22.044]  What happens now that this is taking place?
[02:15:22.044 --> 02:15:23.004]  What's their next move?
[02:15:23.004 --> 02:15:26.085]  Because you guys, I mean, I know you guys, you don't make up sources.
[02:15:26.085 --> 02:15:29.366]  You're getting sources that NBC is panicking.
[02:15:29.366 --> 02:15:30.147]  They want her out.
[02:15:30.147 --> 02:15:31.387]  They want her to go back to Fox.
[02:15:31.387 --> 02:15:34.048]  I mean, what does she do next?
[02:15:34.048 --> 02:15:39.790]  I wouldn't be surprised to see a piece about, you know, internet hate speech and, you know, fake news and pushing that narrative.
[02:15:39.790 --> 02:15:41.071]  I think that might be on her agenda.
[02:15:43.479 --> 02:15:48.720]  My guess is that the ratings for her show will continue to suffer.
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:49.600]  Who knows?
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:55.621]  I don't know what the length of her contract is, but at the end of it, my guess is that they'll either move her or terminate her.
[02:15:55.621 --> 02:15:55.982]  That's right.
[02:15:55.982 --> 02:15:57.922]  Let's follow the topography.
[02:15:57.922 --> 02:16:01.803]  She comes in, huge interview with Putin, ratings are low.
[02:16:01.803 --> 02:16:02.883]  They're low before.
[02:16:02.883 --> 02:16:05.783]  I think she gets a big bounce, but it's like the Death Star blowing up.
[02:16:05.783 --> 02:16:08.244]  And I think in three or four months, her show's canceled.
[02:16:09.383 --> 02:16:16.574]  Well, and when it does get cancelled out, I know, because you're a gentleman, you'll send her a dozen long stem roses.
[02:16:16.574 --> 02:16:19.458]  All I know is I'm one ugly son of a bitch on that show.
[02:16:19.458 --> 02:16:21.541]  God, am I that ugly?
[02:16:21.541 --> 02:16:22.562]  The heat lamp, man.
[02:16:23.619 --> 02:16:24.279]  Look at me right there.
[02:16:24.279 --> 02:16:25.339]  I don't look like that now.
[02:16:25.339 --> 02:16:25.939]  No, I know.
[02:16:25.939 --> 02:16:26.920]  The heat lamp, dude.
[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:33.221]  That is... So for everybody watching, you're watching a... This is how they do things duplicitously.
[02:16:33.221 --> 02:16:39.702]  They'll put a heat lamp over your head and then try to get you sweating and then zoom in and then pixelate your head and then light you up like a pumpkin.
[02:16:39.702 --> 02:16:50.684]  So if you're going to talk to the media ever, make sure you know that they are going to try to do tricks like that to make sure... The only thing that saved me for the Scott Pelley 60 Minutes is Shauna.
[02:16:51.124 --> 02:16:53.164]  It was like, you know, make sure you look a certain way.
[02:16:53.164 --> 02:16:56.065]  She would have watched, because she knows how bad these people are.
[02:16:56.065 --> 02:16:58.986]  She did a great job on Scott Paitley.
[02:16:58.986 --> 02:17:03.026]  The heat lamp thing was a dirty trick, but people are going to see through that.
[02:17:03.026 --> 02:17:06.627]  They could have put some hamburgers and some fries down there and kept them, like, warm.
[02:17:06.627 --> 02:17:08.728]  Where's the other eight hours of your interview?
[02:17:08.728 --> 02:17:10.268]  You know, that's the next question.
[02:17:10.268 --> 02:17:18.249]  I mean, because she edited some of it out of context, but they were being a little more careful, because she'd say, she fanned the flames of this story.
[02:17:18.249 --> 02:17:20.490]  She stayed backed off, weren't saying, I started all the stories.
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:22.321]  So I don't know.
[02:17:22.321 --> 02:17:25.022]  I think I've got to release the interview now that I've said I'll do it.
[02:17:25.022 --> 02:17:27.564]  So it's really a bunch of boring babble.
[02:17:27.564 --> 02:17:30.006]  I can't hardly quite listen to it myself or her.
[02:17:30.006 --> 02:17:31.447]  So it's just a bunch of arguing.
[02:17:31.447 --> 02:17:33.068]  I think the Meme Masters will go to work for you.
[02:17:33.068 --> 02:17:35.409]  You think you can release the audio?
[02:17:35.409 --> 02:17:36.530]  I would just release the audio.
[02:17:36.530 --> 02:17:40.933]  Let the Reddits and the Chans and everybody just go through it.
[02:17:40.933 --> 02:17:42.994]  Let social media and everybody get to the clip.
[02:17:42.994 --> 02:17:43.535]  What do you think?
[02:17:43.535 --> 02:17:45.756]  What do you think, Roger Stone?
[02:17:45.756 --> 02:17:50.960]  You know, Alex, at the rate they're going, they will have successfully blamed you for the Johnstown flood.
[02:17:51.650 --> 02:17:58.913]  The Lincoln assassination and global warming, or I should say alleged global warming.
[02:17:58.913 --> 02:18:03.275]  This is an attempt to take you out and ironically,
[02:18:04.042 --> 02:18:30.115]  I think the only person who got taken out as a credible public figure is Megyn Kelly, because the dirty tricks, the selective editing, the loaded questions, the misdirection, the clever edits, I think people will now see through this only because you have been proactive in outlining for people in advance the hit piece that was to come.
[02:18:31.317 --> 02:18:34.798]  All right, well, Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com, thank you so much.
[02:18:34.798 --> 02:18:37.239]  Look forward to speaking to you in the near future, my friend.
[02:18:37.239 --> 02:18:38.659]  Great to be with you.
[02:18:38.659 --> 02:18:40.580]  Okay, now I'm going to do a little bit longer with you guys.
[02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:44.221]  I'd love to stay here all night, but you'll never get to talk if I don't leave.
[02:18:44.221 --> 02:18:49.523]  I can't wait to be driving home and hearing you guys take calls, play clips, and also talk to other guests.
[02:18:49.523 --> 02:18:51.344]  They're going to be coming up, and I'll be back tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[02:18:51.344 --> 02:18:52.144]  Central.
[02:18:52.144 --> 02:19:00.627]  But I've got a bunch of clips I want to go to that deal with this, when we're waiting for her after these marijuana pieces and this next Wonderland piece they're going to show about
[02:19:01.347 --> 02:19:09.695]  Next, the courage to confront the demon Alex Jones with Tom Brokaw, who's just completely looking like... I don't mean to be mean to an old person, but he can barely get it out.
[02:19:09.695 --> 02:19:11.256]  Like, watch me be mean.
[02:19:11.256 --> 02:19:12.698]  He's an unalloyed racist.
[02:19:12.698 --> 02:19:14.900]  Everyone goes, oh, so original.
[02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:16.722]  Your leadership, sir, is incredible.
[02:19:16.722 --> 02:19:20.125]  It's like watching the Fox catcher where he's rigging wrestling matches.
[02:19:20.125 --> 02:19:22.787]  I mean, it's just like, what the hell?
[02:19:22.787 --> 02:19:24.248]  Tom Brokaw?
[02:19:24.248 --> 02:19:25.249]  Out of some nest?
[02:19:26.010 --> 02:19:30.413]  So like, literally out of his retirement home, to call me a racist?
[02:19:30.413 --> 02:19:32.434]  I'm supposed to scrap my pants?
[02:19:32.434 --> 02:19:33.575]  Who else do they have, right?
[02:19:33.575 --> 02:19:34.956]  Who are they going to bring out?
[02:19:34.956 --> 02:19:36.577]  Where's the borrowed credibility going to come from?
[02:19:37.344 --> 02:19:53.836]  And the beautiful thing I like about this piece is that the media wants to try to claim that anybody who listens to your stuff is responsible for, you're responsible for what they do, so we need to hold a media account for the 500,000 dead Iraqi children.
[02:19:53.836 --> 02:19:58.819]  We need to hold them accountable for all of the lies that they have told, everything that they have done.
[02:19:58.819 --> 02:20:05.744]  We need to do a documentary on the victims of fake news, and we need to let that star, Megyn Kelly, and all these other globalist warmongers.
[02:20:07.056 --> 02:20:07.697]  Well, that's right.
[02:20:07.697 --> 02:20:10.382]  I mean, I love how they... because I feel so sorry for that dad.
[02:20:10.382 --> 02:20:10.743]  You know what?
[02:20:10.743 --> 02:20:13.828]  Since we talked about this, we were having breakfast this morning.
[02:20:15.143 --> 02:20:20.006]  After I've been with my newborn daughter, we met about 11 o'clock, went and had a late breakfast.
[02:20:20.006 --> 02:20:24.168]  And I was telling you about how I'm sitting there, I feel bad for these parents, you know, I had to question the official story.
[02:20:24.168 --> 02:20:29.712]  My listeners were, you know, because they've made up so much stuff like the WMDs and the babies and the incubators.
[02:20:29.712 --> 02:20:32.834]  But I said, you know, I really want to reach out to the parents, but the media keeps attacking me.
[02:20:32.834 --> 02:20:34.054]  I don't even know if I should.
[02:20:34.054 --> 02:20:35.075]  You gave me some good advice.
[02:20:35.075 --> 02:20:42.519]  I want to play my Father's Day message to the Sandy Hook families of the victims here in a moment, but you kind of
[02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:47.701]  And I think you're going to be right, you know, got me to have the courage to come on air and say this.
[02:20:47.701 --> 02:20:51.902]  Yeah, I mean, it's important because now people are really googling for the truth and looking for the truth.
[02:20:51.902 --> 02:20:53.822]  So the zombies you can't reach.
[02:20:53.822 --> 02:21:01.224]  A bunch of people there who are, you know, rolling around with Cheetos dust all over their face and they're cracked out of their mind.
[02:21:01.224 --> 02:21:04.105]  They're taking the pharmaceuticals that they watch the advertisements for that.
[02:21:04.545 --> 02:21:12.670]  That subsidizes this and indeed what nobody wants to talk about is how most of these mass shooters, in fact I think all of them were on SSRIs.
[02:21:12.670 --> 02:21:17.374]  So how many of these mass shootings are actually caused by pharmaceuticals?
[02:21:17.374 --> 02:21:20.616]  Why don't they do a segment on the pharmaceutical companies poisoning people?
[02:21:20.616 --> 02:21:22.297]  Oh, because those are the advertisers, you can't...
[02:21:22.737 --> 02:21:23.878]  You can't do that.
[02:21:23.878 --> 02:21:26.461]  You gotta... and this is what I always tell these fake news people.
[02:21:26.461 --> 02:21:29.604]  I go, why do you care so much about me and everybody else?
[02:21:29.604 --> 02:21:31.966]  Why don't you care about when the New York Times lies?
[02:21:31.966 --> 02:21:35.429]  Why don't you care about the Russia conspiracy theory?
[02:21:35.429 --> 02:21:36.591]  They don't care about any of that.
[02:21:36.591 --> 02:21:44.718]  Why don't you care about Big Pharma, how they're poisoning people, how Tylenol is poison, it toxifies... Look, they have anti-bullying ads on here to ban free speech.
[02:21:44.718 --> 02:21:44.819]  Yep.
[02:21:45.566 --> 02:21:45.946]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:21:45.946 --> 02:21:48.167]  This whole thing's anti-free speech.
[02:21:48.167 --> 02:21:50.987]  When you bully, oh my, well how about the left bullying everybody?
[02:21:50.987 --> 02:21:52.687]  EyewitnessBullying.org, okay?
[02:21:52.687 --> 02:21:54.748]  What is the left, everybody, bullying everybody?
[02:21:54.748 --> 02:21:56.148]  Yeah, Antifa, we'll have Antifa.
[02:21:56.148 --> 02:22:00.329]  I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just everything they claim they are against is what they're doing.
[02:22:00.329 --> 02:22:00.949]  It's protection.
[02:22:00.949 --> 02:22:03.489]  Well, yeah, they're psychological manipulators, but it's good.
[02:22:03.489 --> 02:22:10.931]  People are going to Google and they're going to find out that you actually sent a very heartfelt message to the parents of the... I've been reaching out to the parents for four years.
[02:22:12.441 --> 02:22:24.425]  And then I want to know what happened because I think they did the event and then like they had the PR all ready, no ambulances are called, they bring in all this food, porta-potties, they've got all this stuff ready, I don't know.
[02:22:24.425 --> 02:22:32.008]  Well again, my belief is that the murder, the murders happened, the parents are all... That's what I first thought, then I got jumped on by the internet saying no no no it's all fake.
[02:22:32.847 --> 02:22:42.055]  Well, again, my belief is that it happened, they were murdered, and the reason people on the internet were skeptical, the media needs to own this.
[02:22:42.055 --> 02:22:52.585]  The reason they're skeptical is because everybody, whenever there's a tragedy, the media is immediately trying to say, ban guns, ban guns, ban guns, so then people start to think what we know... People are sick of being blamed for what some criminal does.
[02:22:52.785 --> 02:23:00.211]  So, we know that the media will stage, do I believe that Megyn Kelly would order children to be murdered in order to ban guns?
[02:23:00.211 --> 02:23:01.612]  Well, if she could get away with it.
[02:23:01.612 --> 02:23:03.173]  All these people in the media want carnage.
[02:23:03.173 --> 02:23:03.934]  They want race wars.
[02:23:03.934 --> 02:23:05.055]  They want riots.
[02:23:05.055 --> 02:23:07.557]  But they don't want to do it themselves.
[02:23:07.557 --> 02:23:08.818]  Hands up, don't shoot.
[02:23:08.818 --> 02:23:09.758]  That caused murders.
[02:23:09.758 --> 02:23:10.879]  The Ferguson effect called murder.
[02:23:10.879 --> 02:23:11.920]  A lot of cops have been killed.
[02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:13.481]  And they go, oh, you're kissing cops ass.
[02:23:13.481 --> 02:23:15.603]  No, the average cop doesn't deserve to be executed.
[02:23:15.603 --> 02:23:18.946]  Again, they take the fact that we're honest and have wide form discussions.
[02:23:18.946 --> 02:23:21.708]  And they played a five second clip where I'm saying Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[02:23:22.288 --> 02:23:28.492]  I went and gave them the full internet clip where I said, no, I can see how it totally did happen, but then I can see all this and see how it didn't.
[02:23:28.492 --> 02:23:34.977]  But they literally just take the fact that I'm honest and devil's advocate and they edit it and then try to like totally demonize me.
[02:23:34.977 --> 02:23:36.898]  Well, meanwhile, Hands Up Don't Shoot.
[02:23:36.898 --> 02:23:44.083]  Why isn't there a segment, Megyn Kelly interviewing Brian Stelter and CNN and all the liars who claim that the Hands Up Don't Shoot never happened.
[02:23:44.083 --> 02:23:46.865]  The fake news, the riots, the Ferguson effect.
[02:23:46.865 --> 02:23:49.767]  Police have told me now that they're afraid to police minority communities.
[02:23:49.767 --> 02:23:51.368]  Which has caused massive deaths.
[02:23:51.368 --> 02:23:51.828]  Exactly.
[02:23:51.988 --> 02:23:53.549]  Let's go ahead and play my message.
[02:23:53.549 --> 02:23:55.790]  Let's play my message to the Newtown families.
[02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:58.832]  We wait for Megan to come back with the Tom Brokaw.
[02:23:58.832 --> 02:24:03.255]  I mean, this is just... I mean, literally, like, dig a guy out of a crypt.
[02:24:03.255 --> 02:24:07.538]  He'll probably go, racist, racist, and I'm supposed to fall to my knees and go, no!
[02:24:07.538 --> 02:24:09.239]  Not Tom Brokaw!
[02:24:09.239 --> 02:24:10.700]  So let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[02:24:10.700 --> 02:24:13.162]  Here is my message to the Newtown families.
[02:24:15.106 --> 02:24:23.136]  I woke up this morning on Father's Day and I was holding my young infant daughter in my arms, looking into her eyes.
[02:24:24.992 --> 02:24:37.154]  Sitting out on the back porch, hearing the birds sing, and it just brought tears to my eyes, thinking about all the parents that have lost their children on Father's Day or Mother's Day, who have to then think about that.
[02:24:37.154 --> 02:24:40.615]  Parents should never have to bury their own children.
[02:24:40.615 --> 02:24:52.137]  And that's why, on Father's Day, I want to reach out to the parents of the slain children at the horrible tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, and give you my sincere condolences.
[02:24:53.860 --> 02:25:12.369]  I'd also like to reach out to any of the parents who lost a child at Newtown to invite them to contact me to open a dialogue because I think it's really essential we do that instead of letting the MSM misrepresent things and really try to drive this nation apart.
[02:25:12.369 --> 02:25:17.172]  Right now is a time for unity and peace in our country I think now more than ever.
[02:25:18.502 --> 02:25:29.151]  Andrew Torba of Gab.com, one of the more independent, otherwise liberal, conservative, you name it, ideas on his site is joining us right now in studio.
[02:25:29.151 --> 02:25:33.115]  You know, watching this, the Megyn Kelly, you're responsible for what we've seen so far.
[02:25:34.051 --> 02:25:38.335]  So I think that it's pretty clear that there's a new media war happening and that we're winning.
[02:25:38.335 --> 02:25:48.263]  You know, the alternative media is rising and whether it takes another year, another two years, another five years, the people have spoken and the populace are rising both in real life and on the internet.
[02:25:48.263 --> 02:25:55.869]  And I think that just the fact that they're giving you a platform and they're covering you shows that they're afraid of what, you know, we're building in alternative media.
[02:25:57.409 --> 02:25:59.410]  And like I've said, I'd love to build myself up.
[02:25:59.410 --> 02:26:00.770]  I'm not that good.
[02:26:00.770 --> 02:26:01.831]  None of us are.
[02:26:01.831 --> 02:26:03.251]  It's that they're that bad.
[02:26:03.251 --> 02:26:06.372]  And just getting rid of us, the vacuum's still there.
[02:26:06.372 --> 02:26:14.175]  It's like, if you had a submarine bulkhead open and the submarine's flooding, you don't just bail that water out and then the water stops flooding.
[02:26:14.175 --> 02:26:15.836]  You've got to close the bulkhead.
[02:26:15.836 --> 02:26:16.876]  But they're inaction.
[02:26:16.876 --> 02:26:17.557]  They're lies.
[02:26:17.557 --> 02:26:20.718]  The fact the public doesn't believe them, that's why they're in so much trouble.
[02:26:21.178 --> 02:26:22.639]  Well, the people are looking for truth, right?
[02:26:22.639 --> 02:26:24.139]  They're looking for information.
[02:26:24.139 --> 02:26:25.960]  They're looking for alternative points of view.
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:34.804]  They're sick of seeing the same message, the same narrative over and over and over again on every channel, on every radio station, on every movie, anything.
[02:26:34.804 --> 02:26:35.725]  It's all of culture.
[02:26:35.725 --> 02:26:36.745]  They own it all.
[02:26:36.745 --> 02:26:41.307]  So people are looking for different outlets, and we're filling those voids.
[02:26:41.307 --> 02:26:44.528]  So it's a cultural revolution right now, and it's only expanding.
[02:26:44.528 --> 02:26:45.669]  It's not about conservative or liberal.
[02:26:45.669 --> 02:26:47.370]  I want to play another clip, Mike Cernovich.
[02:26:48.832 --> 02:26:57.977]  What do you think, now in hindsight, seeing most of the Kelly Report, more coming up with Tom Brokaw, the comedy doesn't end.
[02:26:57.977 --> 02:27:06.582]  I feel sorry for the families and everybody else, but when it comes to Tom Brokaw saying I'm a KKK Grand Dragon, this is some funny stuff.
[02:27:06.582 --> 02:27:14.166]  Please tell me some more absolutely ridiculous garbage.
[02:27:14.166 --> 02:27:16.608]  Expanding on this, what do you think their main mission was?
[02:27:17.779 --> 02:27:22.042]  Their main mission was to use you to attack Trump.
[02:27:22.042 --> 02:27:24.784]  Trump was the target and social media is the target.
[02:27:24.784 --> 02:27:27.505]  They want us banned from social media.
[02:27:27.505 --> 02:27:29.187]  They want us kicked off the internet.
[02:27:29.187 --> 02:27:30.007]  So it was a twofer.
[02:27:30.007 --> 02:27:34.230]  They wanted to go after Trump and they wanted to to get people no platform.
[02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:36.892]  That's why alternative platforms like Gab.ai are important.
[02:27:37.412 --> 02:27:42.376]  That's why Trump should start a Gab account, because then all the media people would actually have to start following him.
[02:27:42.376 --> 02:27:42.836]  Exactly.
[02:27:42.836 --> 02:27:47.239]  If he started a Gab account instead of having 25 million over there, he'd get 10 million over to Gab.
[02:27:47.239 --> 02:27:48.620]  That's the real power.
[02:27:48.620 --> 02:27:51.542]  And then Twitter would be forced to respond.
[02:27:51.542 --> 02:27:52.623]  The media would freak out.
[02:27:52.623 --> 02:27:58.447]  So I think the biggest thing Trump could do, because we've talked about this before, his media team is terrible.
[02:27:58.447 --> 02:28:00.068]  His media team sucks.
[02:28:00.068 --> 02:28:02.590]  He needs to start a Gab account and get on Gab.
[02:28:02.590 --> 02:28:05.752]  Why not the Fireside Chats?
[02:28:05.752 --> 02:28:06.213]  I'd love to know.
[02:28:06.929 --> 02:28:12.133]  I mean, I could, I know people who are saying, Don Junior's doing great though.
[02:28:12.133 --> 02:28:13.754]  So Don Junior is a step up.
[02:28:13.754 --> 02:28:14.235]  He's listening.
[02:28:14.235 --> 02:28:16.556]  Yeah, so Don Junior's doing the thing and doing the thing.
[02:28:16.556 --> 02:28:17.517]  But yeah, Trump Sr.
[02:28:17.517 --> 02:28:20.219]  needs to get a Gab account, livestream.
[02:28:20.219 --> 02:28:23.502]  Because here's the thing about this, this hit piece on NBC.
[02:28:23.502 --> 02:28:25.583]  The sheep are just going to be sheep.
[02:28:25.583 --> 02:28:27.505]  But independent people are going to wake up.
[02:28:28.004 --> 02:28:28.505]  We're good to go.
[02:28:47.586 --> 02:28:49.808]  That segment from Megyn Kelly is over.
[02:28:49.808 --> 02:28:51.409]  Now people are saying, well, that's interesting.
[02:28:51.409 --> 02:28:54.031]  Megyn Kelly, NBC, what is really going on?
[02:28:54.031 --> 02:28:57.934]  They're now watching the YouTube, the Periscope, the Facebook Live.
[02:28:57.934 --> 02:28:59.135]  They are reading the articles.
[02:28:59.135 --> 02:29:00.796]  They're reading the social media.
[02:29:00.796 --> 02:29:02.698]  And that is where we're winning the information war.
[02:29:02.698 --> 02:29:03.378]  Absolutely.
[02:29:03.378 --> 02:29:04.679]  And the old media is scared.
[02:29:04.679 --> 02:29:06.961]  They want to demonize and lie about us and exaggerate.
[02:29:06.961 --> 02:29:11.885]  But the good news, it's the listeners that are the trailblazers that are awake and involved and informed.
[02:29:11.885 --> 02:29:13.126]  You're the big game changers.
[02:29:13.126 --> 02:29:14.547]  And again, I say this every day.
[02:29:14.547 --> 02:29:15.468]  It's not a pat on the head.
[02:29:16.607 --> 02:29:18.008]  I can't believe you even put up with me.
[02:29:18.008 --> 02:29:19.749]  I mean, you are who are awesome.
[02:29:19.749 --> 02:29:21.110]  So we love you and we appreciate you.
[02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:22.351]  Let me play this little short.
[02:29:22.351 --> 02:29:25.132]  Well, Megyn Kelly has inspired death threats against you.
[02:29:25.132 --> 02:29:28.695]  I hope after this show, someone shoots Alex Jones.
[02:29:28.695 --> 02:29:32.437]  So Megyn Kelly, we are now demanding that you disavow the death
[02:29:32.677 --> 02:29:39.503]  After she did the show, people came and said, kill me, and it's Megyn Kelly saying kill me.
[02:29:39.503 --> 02:29:43.246]  I don't want to have to sue Megyn Kelly for making them say kill me.
[02:29:43.246 --> 02:29:44.947]  Megyn, why did you want them to kill me?
[02:29:44.947 --> 02:29:46.228]  Here's another one.
[02:29:46.228 --> 02:29:48.730]  Someone needs to shoot him and his fucking brains out.
[02:29:48.730 --> 02:29:50.972]  The dead man, Alex Jones from Infowars.
[02:29:50.972 --> 02:29:53.113]  Megyn Kelly, you are responsible for this.
[02:29:53.113 --> 02:29:57.357]  By the way, haters and those of you out there who think you want to
[02:29:57.757 --> 02:30:02.799]  Everything that you do against me is monitored in real time, all the time by intelligence people.
[02:30:02.799 --> 02:30:06.360]  This right here is intelligence people right now at levels you couldn't even comprehend.
[02:30:06.360 --> 02:30:09.881]  They're now monitoring the death threats against Alex Jones in real time.
[02:30:09.881 --> 02:30:12.682]  So I'm calling on Megyn Kelly immediately.
[02:30:12.682 --> 02:30:16.323]  We need to do an emergency broadcast, a separate stream, a separate video.
[02:30:16.323 --> 02:30:22.306]  She needs to disavow the violence because we've already seen the congressman shot, the left's calling for violence.
[02:30:22.306 --> 02:30:23.326]  They're invoking this.
[02:30:23.826 --> 02:30:26.589]  To say we're hurting children to try to create violence.
[02:30:26.589 --> 02:30:27.310]  And they will do it.
[02:30:27.310 --> 02:30:30.193]  And there was that shooting at the GOP Congress.
[02:30:30.193 --> 02:30:33.916]  So we need to do a separate emergency broadcast, emergency transmission.
[02:30:33.916 --> 02:30:34.157]  They're mad.
[02:30:34.157 --> 02:30:36.039]  They can't get our guns.
[02:30:36.039 --> 02:30:37.460]  She's trying to get you murdered.
[02:30:37.460 --> 02:30:42.846]  And she now has a duty and an obligation to disavow the death threats from her viewers right now.
[02:30:43.891 --> 02:30:47.712]  I don't know why she would send people to stalk media and call for death.
[02:30:47.712 --> 02:30:48.913]  Yeah, and this is on her now.
[02:30:48.913 --> 02:30:51.273]  So, we need to demand a statement from Megyn Kelly.
[02:30:51.273 --> 02:30:56.935]  I want to know, because if she does, right now, she has said on TV, what you say has consequences.
[02:30:56.935 --> 02:31:02.217]  Well, right now, in real time, people are making death threats because of Megyn Kelly's hit piece.
[02:31:02.217 --> 02:31:06.378]  This means that she... We're going to play this tape so we can get those clips, those tweets, and put them up.
[02:31:07.218 --> 02:31:10.979]  For everybody right now, so folks can see that while we're streaming live.
[02:31:10.979 --> 02:31:14.780]  Again, the act of resistance is to stream these articles, these videos, these links.
[02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:16.621]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:31:16.621 --> 02:31:23.203]  I'm going to play my message to fathers on Father's Day, a message of peaceful awakening and resistance.
[02:31:23.203 --> 02:31:30.585]  Then we're going to come back, and then we should have Tom Brokaw, who they're trying to reanimate right now, who's about to attack us in closing.
[02:31:30.585 --> 02:31:30.925]  Here it is.
[02:31:32.349 --> 02:32:00.654]  By design, on Father's Day, the corporate media that's led us all into these illegal wars, that has attempted to bankrupt our country, that has foisted Obamacare on our backs, this pack of bloodthirsty liars are going to try to misrepresent what I've said and what I've done in my media career as I've attempted to restore our republic, so that they can project the made-up garbage they're going to put out, not just on me, but you as fathers.
[02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:06.997]  Megan Kelly promised me this wasn't airing on Father's Day, that it was going to be airing in July.
[02:32:06.997 --> 02:32:16.068]  But I knew they were going to try to scapegoat fathers by first demonizing me because they were obsessed with fatherhood and children and then brought up
[02:32:17.006 --> 02:32:23.749]  Newtown and all this other stuff to make me look like a demon so they can make all fathers look bad.
[02:32:23.749 --> 02:32:30.093]  This is a way to manipulate the heartstrings of the American people and on Father's Day to drive another wedge.
[02:32:30.093 --> 02:32:35.996]  But look at Hollywood, look at Viacom, look at NBC and CBS and CNN, all of them.
[02:32:35.996 --> 02:32:39.037]  It's constant anti-family, it's constant anti-father.
[02:32:39.037 --> 02:32:43.980]  Look at the sitcoms, look at the dramas, look at the TV ads where they tell you fathers are bad.
[02:32:44.620 --> 02:32:50.963]  This is an attack on the family and an attack on civilization and a giant evil misrepresentation.
[02:32:50.963 --> 02:32:54.864]  How dare them distort and edit my views on Newtown and other events.
[02:32:54.864 --> 02:33:01.146]  And the last two years never run any of the videos I've put out saying I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[02:33:01.146 --> 02:33:04.688]  They continue to misrepresent what I've said and what I've done.
[02:33:04.688 --> 02:33:07.909]  And they've said questioning is basically illegal.
[02:33:07.909 --> 02:33:09.790]  They've said InfoWars is a virus.
[02:33:11.104 --> 02:33:16.190]  But they also, again, say that the family is a threat to the state's total control.
[02:33:16.190 --> 02:33:18.073]  So know this, fathers.
[02:33:18.073 --> 02:33:23.920]  The Clintons, the Obamas, the globalists have funded the Arab Spring, the enslavement of countless men, women, and children.
[02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:27.284]  They have launched sanctions on Iraq that killed over half a million Iraqis.
[02:33:27.284 --> 02:33:28.525]  They're the killers.
[02:33:28.525 --> 02:33:29.326]  They're the murderers.
[02:33:29.907 --> 02:33:37.369]  And so on this Father's Day, men across the world must come together of every race, color, and creed and realize men are under attack.
[02:33:37.369 --> 02:33:38.489]  Women are under attack.
[02:33:38.489 --> 02:33:39.929]  Children are under attack.
[02:33:39.929 --> 02:33:41.270]  Humanity's in a crisis.
[02:33:41.270 --> 02:33:51.852]  These social engineers are playing God and they are trying to divide and conquer us and men must awaken and break the conditioning and not care what the MSM says anymore and move forward.
[02:33:52.532 --> 02:34:00.744]  To return humanity to its basic equilibrium between men, women, and children, and a culture built for, of, and by humans.
[02:34:00.744 --> 02:34:02.487]  The future does need people.
[02:34:02.487 --> 02:34:04.409]  We don't need to be replaced by robots.
[02:34:04.409 --> 02:34:05.391]  We're not failed.
[02:34:05.391 --> 02:34:06.412]  We're not evil.
[02:34:06.412 --> 02:34:08.375]  And we don't need the globalists to play God anymore.
[02:34:09.306 --> 02:34:13.668]  It's time for the mass awakening that's already been taking place to accelerate.
[02:34:13.668 --> 02:34:23.331]  The globalists are attacking men because they know, historically and genetically, it is the men that defend the tribe and defend the people.
[02:34:23.331 --> 02:34:35.556]  It's time to get past the media hype that led us to all these wars, and led us into globalism, and led us into the sexualization of our children, and the attack on God, and to break with the globalists and realize they're an enemy of humanity.
[02:34:36.136 --> 02:34:47.219]  On this Father's Day, men, it's time to stand up, speak out, and take action against the globalists in the information war, and with the decisions you make every day, with the financial actions you take.
[02:34:47.219 --> 02:34:49.059]  Humanity is on the march.
[02:34:49.059 --> 02:34:54.620]  The globalists are trying to put us back in our place and intimidate the leaders of the resistance, and it's not working.
[02:34:54.620 --> 02:34:56.421]  It's only made me redouble my efforts.
[02:34:56.421 --> 02:34:56.981]  And understand,
[02:34:57.541 --> 02:35:03.084]  We've got to absolutely take it to the next level because the globalists are just as evil as our research showed.
[02:35:03.084 --> 02:35:04.485]  In fact, they're worse.
[02:35:04.485 --> 02:35:18.453]  So on this Father's Day 2017, we take the corporate holiday and we return it to humanity and declare it Human Day, Freedom Day, Resistance Day, Awakening Day.
[02:35:18.453 --> 02:35:20.314]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:20.314 --> 02:35:24.577]  We'll be live until past 8 o'clock tonight, countering Megyn Kelly, NBC, and the globalists.
[02:35:25.390 --> 02:35:28.732]  And again, if you're watching this transmission, you are the hope.
[02:35:28.732 --> 02:35:34.116]  You are the resistance.
[02:35:34.116 --> 02:35:44.943]  The queen of fake news, Megyn Kelly, is getting ready to attack.
[02:35:44.943 --> 02:35:47.285]  With Tom Brokaw, the crib keeper.
[02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:54.323]  So it's like an investigative report into fake news?
[02:35:54.323 --> 02:35:54.903]  Yeah, come on.
[02:36:12.128 --> 02:36:13.128]  I don't know, I don't know.
[02:36:13.128 --> 02:36:15.610]  But just, you know, like all the Sandy Hook things.
[02:36:15.610 --> 02:36:19.752]  I've had debates where I've shown both sides, where I go back and forth, but I believe people died there.
[02:36:19.752 --> 02:36:25.995]  When you say parents faked their children's death, people get very angry.
[02:36:25.995 --> 02:36:30.897]  She didn't show in her promo video that I said, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[02:36:31.457 --> 02:36:34.100]  You know, you just became very fascinating to me.
[02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:38.463]  I just sort of thought you were this maybe, you know, one-dimensional guy.
[02:36:38.463 --> 02:36:39.564]  Like, this is your thing.
[02:36:39.564 --> 02:36:48.392]  My goal is for your listeners and the left, you know, who will be watching some on NBC to say, wow, that was really interesting.
[02:36:48.392 --> 02:36:51.795]  The media never covers all the evil wars it's promoted, all the big things.
[02:36:51.795 --> 02:36:54.278]  That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown.
[02:36:54.278 --> 02:36:54.938]  You know it.
[02:36:54.938 --> 02:36:55.539]  Here's the difference.
[02:36:55.919 --> 02:37:01.323]  I promise you when it's over, you'll say, absolutely, she did what she said she was going to do, and you'll be fine with it.
[02:37:01.323 --> 02:37:07.087]  I'm not looking to portray you as some boogeyman or, you know, do any sort of a gotcha moment.
[02:37:07.087 --> 02:37:11.029]  I just want to talk about you.
[02:37:11.029 --> 02:37:12.670]  I want people to get to know you.
[02:37:12.670 --> 02:37:20.576]  And the craziest thing of all would be if some of the people who have this, you know, insane version of you in their heads walk away saying, you know what?
[02:37:21.844 --> 02:37:23.345]  I see, like, the dad in him.
[02:37:23.345 --> 02:37:28.409]  I see the guy who loves those kids and who is more complex than I've been led to believe.
[02:37:28.409 --> 02:37:30.150]  We didn't get any of the really important stuff.
[02:37:30.150 --> 02:37:30.611]  What do you mean?
[02:37:30.611 --> 02:37:32.592]  We talked about all the important stuff.
[02:37:32.592 --> 02:37:38.336]  This is not going to be a contentious, you know, sort of gotcha exchange.
[02:37:38.336 --> 02:37:45.682]  If I didn't take the challenge, then good, or at least an open heart, would be hiding from evil.
[02:37:48.430 --> 02:37:50.311]  Mike Cernovich Media.
[02:37:50.311 --> 02:37:52.073]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:37:52.073 --> 02:37:54.875]  Mike Cernovich in about 20 minutes is going to take over for this cohort here.
[02:37:54.875 --> 02:37:56.696]  We'll give the number out if you want to take calls.
[02:37:56.696 --> 02:37:58.217]  A lot of clips to get to.
[02:37:58.217 --> 02:38:04.782]  We've got the champagne out yet because even Brian Stelter is saying we won tonight.
[02:38:04.782 --> 02:38:06.143]  Because of the editing actually.
[02:38:06.143 --> 02:38:13.649]  So the Washington Post media columnist and former public editor of the New York Times said that because they edited it so strongly
[02:38:14.449 --> 02:38:18.572]  That this is going to give you information to use against the media.
[02:38:18.572 --> 02:38:25.436]  They actually edited, so these idiots, they went, if you edit too much, then the people can tell, like the jump cuts.
[02:38:25.436 --> 02:38:27.857]  So you would talk and then be like, whoa, whoa.
[02:38:27.857 --> 02:38:29.478]  It looked like a PewDiePie video or something.
[02:38:29.478 --> 02:38:33.901]  Yeah, because I would go, I don't think, you know, they're covering up, but everybody questioned it.
[02:38:33.901 --> 02:38:35.102]  I didn't create it.
[02:38:35.102 --> 02:38:38.244]  You know, before the media ever attacked me, I said, I thought Sandy Hook happened.
[02:38:38.244 --> 02:38:39.405]  They wouldn't show that.
[02:38:39.405 --> 02:38:41.426]  They would just cut it all like scrambled up.
[02:38:41.906 --> 02:38:43.407]  It looks like the people are seeing through this too.
[02:38:43.407 --> 02:38:44.108]  I have a tweet here.
[02:38:44.108 --> 02:38:46.670]  Alex Jones, I wasn't a big fan of yours before.
[02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:48.992]  After the interview with Megyn Kelly, I'm now your biggest fan.
[02:38:48.992 --> 02:38:51.213]  It's got 200 retweets so far.
[02:38:51.213 --> 02:38:51.654]  13 minutes ago.
[02:38:51.654 --> 02:38:53.795]  Well, I mean, I don't think we're just putting a good face on this.
[02:38:53.795 --> 02:38:56.377]  I'm shocked because I'm like a walrus or something.
[02:38:56.377 --> 02:38:57.919]  I can't believe they're so easy to defeat.
[02:38:57.919 --> 02:39:00.040]  I think this signifies how pathetic they are.
[02:39:00.040 --> 02:39:06.505]  We're waiting for her to come back at the end with Tom Brokaw to talk about the discouragement that she has to have to fight me.
[02:39:06.505 --> 02:39:09.087]  But are you guys, but listen to this.
[02:39:09.087 --> 02:39:10.889]  And the great crew that's up here working late on Sunday night.
[02:39:13.058 --> 02:39:16.739]  He's the one that said it wasn't a hit piece and promised and told all these lies.
[02:39:16.739 --> 02:39:18.340]  So they threw her against Trump.
[02:39:18.340 --> 02:39:19.820]  Now they're throwing her against me.
[02:39:19.820 --> 02:39:22.761]  Doesn't she get they're sending her on kamikaze missions?
[02:39:22.761 --> 02:39:24.462]  Well, she even called this out.
[02:39:24.462 --> 02:39:27.803]  She said, you know, if I do this to you, who's going to want to do an interview with me?
[02:39:27.803 --> 02:39:33.785]  So now everybody that has seen this, anybody that's going to be potentially interviewed by her in the future, they're going to say, well, no, wait a minute.
[02:39:33.785 --> 02:39:34.965]  I saw what you did to Alex Jones.
[02:39:34.965 --> 02:39:36.426]  So why am I going to give you the time of day?
[02:39:38.035 --> 02:39:42.518]  Her next interview, she may just bring a whole heat lamp bill from McDonald's and ask you to lay down in it.
[02:39:42.518 --> 02:39:51.004]  We're going to have to write a playbook on it, actually, because the only thing I thought there that made you look bad was they got the heat lamp on you.
[02:39:51.004 --> 02:39:52.765]  So add that to your media check.
[02:39:52.765 --> 02:39:55.507]  So those of you watching at home, add that to your media check.
[02:39:55.507 --> 02:39:58.509]  Have you noticed I'm outside in 90 degree weather and I'm not sweating?
[02:39:58.509 --> 02:39:59.690]  But there, it was like, why is it?
[02:39:59.690 --> 02:40:00.590]  And I think you're right.
[02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:02.412]  It was like, the heat was like...
[02:40:03.112 --> 02:40:05.998]  And it was cool, it wasn't really hot in the rest of the house, but right there it was so hot.
[02:40:05.998 --> 02:40:06.479]  Exactly.
[02:40:06.479 --> 02:40:10.747]  So they made it look like it was overhead lighting, and then what happened, it was a heat lamp.
[02:40:10.747 --> 02:40:12.491]  It was like a red infrared heat lamp.
[02:40:13.692 --> 02:40:14.712]  Oh, she's back with Brokaw.
[02:40:14.712 --> 02:40:15.072]  Go ahead.
[02:40:34.059 --> 02:40:39.723]  When the internet first arrived, like everyone else... He runs around and kills everybody!
[02:40:39.723 --> 02:40:43.826]  And those qualities have only become so much more effective and pervasive.
[02:40:45.094 --> 02:40:50.979]  But I was also quickly aware of the underside, the seizure of the net, by hate groups of all kinds.
[02:40:50.979 --> 02:40:51.960]  He's a hate group.
[02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:52.681]  He is a hate group.
[02:40:52.681 --> 02:40:54.843]  I wonder if he's going to introduce someone to harm, like Cryptkeeper does.
[02:40:54.843 --> 02:41:02.830]  I did two documentaries at the turn of the century called The Web of Hate, hoping to slow that trend.
[02:41:02.830 --> 02:41:11.258]  But the reach and the poisonous claims of Alex Jones and others like him, and even establishment public figures, would not be slowed.
[02:41:13.052 --> 02:41:20.161]  We cannot disrupt the irrational spread of hate and division by instantly, blindly... How did he... He can't even talk!
[02:41:20.161 --> 02:41:21.302]  They rolled him out!
[02:41:21.302 --> 02:41:26.169]  The parents of Newtown.
[02:41:26.169 --> 02:41:29.032]  It's not enough to say, I cannot imagine.
[02:41:30.239 --> 02:41:38.765]  Because unless we're the parents, we can never ever share the unremitting pain, the lifelong loss, and anger.
[02:41:38.765 --> 02:41:39.925]  And they chose father's day.
[02:41:39.925 --> 02:41:44.348]  Nor should they have to hear the cruel claim that it was a lie.
[02:41:44.348 --> 02:41:46.089]  Nobody's even watching now, though.
[02:41:46.089 --> 02:41:50.312]  No parent or grandparent in America today can escape the fear.
[02:41:50.312 --> 02:41:52.494]  The fear that it could happen again.
[02:41:52.494 --> 02:41:54.075]  No, they want the guns.
[02:41:54.075 --> 02:41:56.897]  We cannot allow the agents of hate to go on challenge.
[02:41:57.788 --> 02:41:59.749]  And become the imprint of our time.
[02:41:59.749 --> 02:42:01.670]  They keep bringing Newtown up.
[02:42:01.670 --> 02:42:03.691]  They're the ones.
[02:42:03.691 --> 02:42:12.794]  In our finest moments, we're a republic that thrives when it recognizes common threats and takes them on.
[02:42:12.794 --> 02:42:14.095]  That time is now again.
[02:42:14.095 --> 02:42:15.396]  Common threats.
[02:42:15.396 --> 02:42:16.116]  Free speech.
[02:42:16.116 --> 02:42:20.618]  This is the time of common threats requiring uncommon courage.
[02:42:21.877 --> 02:42:26.800]  It is a time to step up and read off teleprompters.
[02:42:26.800 --> 02:42:27.540]  What a dork.
[02:42:27.540 --> 02:42:29.141]  That's embarrassing.
[02:42:29.141 --> 02:42:30.462]  They're laying the groundwork.
[02:42:30.462 --> 02:42:31.943]  I'd be humiliated.
[02:42:31.943 --> 02:42:32.543]  They're getting ready.
[02:42:32.543 --> 02:42:34.665]  This is laying the groundwork.
[02:42:34.665 --> 02:42:39.748]  They're wanting to do a false flag on Newtown, a real one, and then say we inspired it, just like the pizza place.
[02:42:40.248 --> 02:42:47.658]  Just all this crap because we're like covering real hardcore Podesta emails where clearly kids are involved and weiner and sexting and we break all that.
[02:42:47.658 --> 02:42:48.500]  They're panicked!
[02:42:48.500 --> 02:42:50.222]  So I saw New York Times, Washington Post.
[02:42:50.222 --> 02:42:52.365]  I'm walking through the hotel in Cancun.
[02:42:52.365 --> 02:42:52.866]  Took off a week.
[02:42:54.226 --> 02:42:57.967]  And I'm seeing Pizza Place, the focus of, you know, WikiLeaks.
[02:42:57.967 --> 02:42:59.628]  And so I start watching the Cruz reports.
[02:42:59.628 --> 02:43:02.589]  They're not bad, but they're reporting on what the news focused on.
[02:43:02.589 --> 02:43:03.149]  Yep.
[02:43:03.149 --> 02:43:08.151]  I call them and I go, I think this is a diversion from the real stuff in the emails, this Pizza Place.
[02:43:08.151 --> 02:43:11.833]  Because, you know, it was all FBI code words for pizza and all this stuff.
[02:43:11.833 --> 02:43:13.513]  That was separate the Pizza Place.
[02:43:13.513 --> 02:43:14.534]  And sure enough, I was proven right.
[02:43:14.534 --> 02:43:17.055]  They got pissed that I did that.
[02:43:17.055 --> 02:43:20.736]  So they turned it all around and made it look like I was weak.
[02:43:20.736 --> 02:43:22.577]  Well, everybody was kind of... Because I've been exposing it.
[02:43:22.577 --> 02:43:22.957]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:43:23.177 --> 02:43:23.897]  It wasn't just you.
[02:43:23.897 --> 02:43:24.658]  Everybody was covering this.
[02:43:24.658 --> 02:43:26.619]  This was in the Washington Post, the New York Times.
[02:43:26.619 --> 02:43:30.961]  It wasn't like... They made it seem like you were the only person talking about this.
[02:43:30.961 --> 02:43:35.423]  So why have they... Maybe they chose me because I am actually weak.
[02:43:35.423 --> 02:43:37.424]  Well, I think it's not... No, no, maybe it is I'm bad.
[02:43:37.424 --> 02:43:38.005]  I want to be serious.
[02:43:38.005 --> 02:43:39.946]  I don't want to be on a power trip here.
[02:43:39.946 --> 02:43:41.987]  Okay, I know we have a big audience, okay?
[02:43:41.987 --> 02:43:44.128]  But why do they always choose me to be attacked?
[02:43:45.222 --> 02:43:49.864]  I mean, maybe it's that I give them the ammo, because I do say a lot of free-form stuff, and they can clip it together.
[02:43:49.864 --> 02:43:53.446]  But then I can't start censoring what I say, just because they're going to edit it.
[02:43:53.446 --> 02:44:00.170]  I mean, Hillary Clinton is a mass-murdering witch who put radical Islamists in charge in Libya, Syria, and other countries, and bragged about it.
[02:44:00.170 --> 02:44:05.793]  She is personally responsible for the murder and sexual enslavement of tens of thousands of women and children.
[02:44:05.793 --> 02:44:11.255]  Now, they're going to edit that and say that I said she was raping them with a damn turkey baster in the bottom of a pizza place.
[02:44:11.255 --> 02:44:11.956]  It isn't true!
[02:44:11.956 --> 02:44:12.916]  I didn't say that!
[02:44:12.916 --> 02:44:14.197]  And I told Megyn Kelly that!
[02:44:15.555 --> 02:44:27.799]  Well, I was actually told by my sources in the intelligence community that by reshifting the narrative away from the pedophiles, because as we know, the UN was caught in a pedophile scandal.
[02:44:27.799 --> 02:44:28.499]  Oh, everywhere.
[02:44:28.499 --> 02:44:29.279]  Yeah, they're all over.
[02:44:29.279 --> 02:44:34.061]  I've had all the high-level FBI, CIA call up and go, Alex, you're wrong.
[02:44:34.061 --> 02:44:34.701]  It's all fake.
[02:44:34.701 --> 02:44:36.982]  And I'm like, but I can't prove that, so stop it.
[02:44:37.482 --> 02:44:42.226]  Right, so what they want to do is, they want, the media is covering up for pedophilia just like they covered up Jimmy Savile.
[02:44:42.226 --> 02:44:43.668]  Oh, they're saying it doesn't exist now!
[02:44:43.668 --> 02:44:47.011]  Yeah, well they said that it should be treated like a disorder.
[02:44:47.011 --> 02:44:50.253]  So the media is going after anybody who covers pedophilia.
[02:44:50.253 --> 02:44:56.138]  I mean, if you never tried to cover and expose pedophilia, here's what they say about me.
[02:44:56.138 --> 02:44:59.461]  They go, why are you obsessed, Cernovich, with pedophiles in D.C.?
[02:44:59.461 --> 02:45:01.043]  And I go, why are you not?
[02:45:01.043 --> 02:45:02.044]  Why are you not obsessed?
[02:45:02.044 --> 02:45:03.185]  Remember, I was on the air 20 years ago.
[02:45:05.627 --> 02:45:11.153]  Like the first five, six, seven years was like, conspiracy theorists claim Catholic priests are raping people.
[02:45:11.153 --> 02:45:19.041]  Turned out it was from the highest levels, all orchestrated by an outside group coming in and using it as an intelligence op to take over the Catholic Church.
[02:45:19.041 --> 02:45:20.583]  And turned out it was all true.
[02:45:20.583 --> 02:45:22.746]  How many conspiracy theories turn out to be totally true?
[02:45:23.773 --> 02:45:24.594]  That's the problem.
[02:45:24.594 --> 02:45:29.899]  They don't want you to know the truth, just like they don't want you to know that the Clintons were selling children in Haiti.
[02:45:29.899 --> 02:45:31.300]  That was why they asked you to report Haiti.
[02:45:31.300 --> 02:45:35.804]  We sent Joe Biggs and Michael Zimmerman there over a year ago, and then it all turned out to be true.
[02:45:35.804 --> 02:45:37.285]  They were coming back like, yeah, they're running kids.
[02:45:37.285 --> 02:45:38.947]  I'm like, we can't even go with this.
[02:45:38.947 --> 02:45:40.128]  I was like, how do we prove it?
[02:45:40.128 --> 02:45:43.111]  We had the witnesses, but now it's all confirmed.
[02:45:43.111 --> 02:45:44.332]  Big AP report.
[02:45:44.332 --> 02:45:45.393]  But do we get awards for that?
[02:45:45.393 --> 02:45:46.474]  Oh, back to Megyn Kelly, sorry.
[02:45:47.867 --> 02:45:54.150]  Well I gotta tell you, Megyn Kelly, I don't want to run her down, but she looked like what I heard from inside sources.
[02:45:54.150 --> 02:45:55.310]  She is freaked out.
[02:45:55.310 --> 02:45:55.830]  Why do you think so?
[02:46:05.506 --> 02:46:06.226]  Because you're winning.
[02:46:06.226 --> 02:46:07.066]  That's why.
[02:46:07.066 --> 02:46:08.167]  Because you caught her on her toes.
[02:46:08.167 --> 02:46:14.389]  You have that recorded audio where she says, hey, I'm not going to do this, and then goes ahead and does exactly what you said she was going to do.
[02:46:14.389 --> 02:46:15.029]  So what do I do?
[02:46:15.029 --> 02:46:17.309]  Let's say I've got eight hours, which is what we've got roughly.
[02:46:17.309 --> 02:46:19.190]  But the problem is I've got to listen to it.
[02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:21.310]  But I'll be honest, because I kind of want to cover my butt.
[02:46:21.310 --> 02:46:23.091]  What if something got weird said by me?
[02:46:23.091 --> 02:46:24.171]  People are saying, you know, where is it?
[02:46:24.171 --> 02:46:25.612]  Well, I mean, we don't have a big operation.
[02:46:25.612 --> 02:46:25.872]  Right.
[02:46:25.872 --> 02:46:27.012]  But you know what?
[02:46:27.012 --> 02:46:29.873]  In the nature of this, to be fair, I'm just going to start releasing an hour a day
[02:46:30.313 --> 02:46:31.273]  I'm not even going to listen to it.
[02:46:31.273 --> 02:46:32.113]  Crowdsource it.
[02:46:32.113 --> 02:46:33.073]  Let the crowd figure it out.
[02:46:33.073 --> 02:46:35.854]  The crowd will find the best parts and edit the clips together.
[02:46:35.854 --> 02:46:39.775]  The meme veterans will go out there and do the work for you.
[02:46:39.775 --> 02:46:40.935]  Dude, I'll be honest.
[02:46:40.935 --> 02:46:42.935]  Don't you think this was kind of a nothing burger?
[02:46:42.935 --> 02:46:44.635]  I felt like I was part of Al Capone's vault.
[02:46:44.635 --> 02:46:50.316]  I mean, it was interesting to watch them melting down, but her supposed Get Me report, you know, Q in there got like 40 texts.
[02:46:50.316 --> 02:46:51.897]  Everybody texting, so this was nothing.
[02:46:51.897 --> 02:46:52.377]  Right.
[02:46:52.377 --> 02:46:54.637]  Yeah, it was actually a little disappointing.
[02:46:54.637 --> 02:46:58.898]  I thought we were going to have the Super Bowl, but they over-edited it, which was a tactical mistake.
[02:46:59.238 --> 02:47:00.938]  And even MSN is admitting that.
[02:47:00.938 --> 02:47:06.960]  Yeah, so what I would have done if I wanted to do a hit piece on you is, the jump cuts were too obvious, okay?
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:17.262]  If you're gonna, so here, fake news, I know you're all watching right now, if you're gonna do a hit piece on people, don't do jump cuts like your YouTube, like it's a PewDiePie video or something like that.
[02:47:17.262 --> 02:47:24.983]  You can edit, you can pull the little clips, but when you do the jump cuts like you did tonight, all people are saying is, well wait a minute, that doesn't actually look right.
[02:47:24.983 --> 02:47:28.824]  And then of course my advice always to people who, if you ever do take an interview with the fake news,
[02:47:29.484 --> 02:47:29.925]  I think so.
[02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:53.503]  I started out going, I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[02:47:53.503 --> 02:47:56.085]  They lied about babies in incubators, so everybody has a right to question it.
[02:47:56.085 --> 02:47:57.666]  It was my listeners that questioned it.
[02:47:57.666 --> 02:48:00.569]  I don't blame them, they have a right to question it, but I believe it happened.
[02:48:00.569 --> 02:48:01.369]  None of that in there.
[02:48:01.369 --> 02:48:02.250]  Right, exactly.
[02:48:02.250 --> 02:48:04.832]  I'll tell you, this was nothing for them, but this was a huge win for you guys.
[02:48:04.832 --> 02:48:06.673]  This was a huge win for Alternative Media.
[02:48:06.673 --> 02:48:11.798]  You guys probably got, you know, a million new people that have never heard of InfoWars that are now on the website today, right now.
[02:48:13.564 --> 02:48:14.405]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:48:14.405 --> 02:48:15.386]  Look at this stuff.
[02:48:15.386 --> 02:48:21.952]  30% of Shobani's workforce, a Muslim-owned company consisting of Muslim refugees, soldiers for Allah, resettling America.
[02:48:21.952 --> 02:48:23.053]  I'm reading a tweet.
[02:48:23.053 --> 02:48:24.094]  That's the other person.
[02:48:24.094 --> 02:48:26.096]  I mean Mac.
[02:48:26.096 --> 02:48:26.336]  Again.
[02:48:27.659 --> 02:48:29.520]  The new thing is they know the media wants to PR.
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:33.482]  So if my people say anything about somebody else's report, that isn't 100% right.
[02:48:33.482 --> 02:48:34.623]  We even retract it.
[02:48:34.623 --> 02:48:35.203]  They don't care.
[02:48:35.203 --> 02:48:38.065]  We get sued because then it creates a huge publicity deal.
[02:48:38.065 --> 02:48:40.406]  But he's on the New York Federal Reserve Board.
[02:48:40.406 --> 02:48:43.848]  He's involved with the refugee panel and the UN.
[02:48:43.848 --> 02:48:45.509]  He is pushing open borders.
[02:48:45.509 --> 02:48:47.230]  And I don't even want to be this guy's enemy.
[02:48:47.230 --> 02:48:48.531]  Well, I mean, notice this.
[02:48:48.531 --> 02:48:50.532]  He didn't want to go on air and talk to her.
[02:48:51.112 --> 02:48:54.614]  Because the settlement terms, which again... You heard them say, they want to drop it.
[02:48:54.614 --> 02:48:55.955]  Yeah, they said, oh, it's closed.
[02:48:55.955 --> 02:48:57.897]  So I thought, well, well, well, that is what you call it.
[02:48:57.897 --> 02:48:59.958]  I wonder what they would say if they knew what the settlement was.
[02:48:59.958 --> 02:49:04.101]  Yeah, so hmm, it's like, oh, I wonder, because they tried to use the settlement to make you look bad.
[02:49:04.101 --> 02:49:07.523]  And the Chobani people said, well, we don't want to talk about this anymore.
[02:49:07.523 --> 02:49:12.527]  Well, well, well, maybe there's more to that settlement than the fake news media reported.
[02:49:12.527 --> 02:49:14.768]  And I, you know, people, people are smart.
[02:49:14.768 --> 02:49:16.189]  People are able to figure that out.
[02:49:16.189 --> 02:49:16.890]  Well, my lawyers.
[02:49:19.212 --> 02:49:21.293]  I'm just going to leave it alone because here's the deal.
[02:49:21.293 --> 02:49:24.616]  It wouldn't matter if I went and spent two years in court and won.
[02:49:24.616 --> 02:49:25.696]  The media would just say I lost.
[02:49:25.696 --> 02:49:26.917]  It's like I have my children.
[02:49:26.917 --> 02:49:28.779]  They say I lost custody.
[02:49:28.779 --> 02:49:30.960]  I mean, so just why even respond to them at this point?
[02:49:33.021 --> 02:49:43.685]  I want to go ahead now, and I want to declare victory for the American people, and I want to declare victory for the listeners and the crew, because I think her mistakes is why she blew up, not any credit to me.
[02:49:43.685 --> 02:49:46.126]  And I don't just say that to look magnanimous.
[02:49:46.126 --> 02:49:47.266]  It's true, okay?
[02:49:47.266 --> 02:49:55.169]  What matters is we try our best, we tell the truth, we take action, and we just keep promoting Americana and basic free market, because it's a lot better than North Korea.
[02:49:55.169 --> 02:49:57.650]  And I just want to thank all of you for coming in and doing this tonight.
[02:49:57.650 --> 02:50:01.752]  You guys are going to host for another hour and take calls or cover news or do whatever you want.
[02:50:02.452 --> 02:50:09.657]  I want to just open this bottle of champagne here so that we can celebrate the fact that we're in the fight.
[02:50:09.657 --> 02:50:11.318]  We celebrate the fact that we haven't rolled over.
[02:50:11.318 --> 02:50:12.438]  We're not dying.
[02:50:12.438 --> 02:50:13.219]  We're getting stronger.
[02:50:13.219 --> 02:50:14.680]  They're getting weaker.
[02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:17.722]  And we walked to the lion's den and it blew up in their face.
[02:50:17.722 --> 02:50:22.325]  And the word is NBC is looking to get rid of Megyn Kelly, according to your sources.
[02:50:22.325 --> 02:50:23.265]  She's not the enemy, though.
[02:50:23.265 --> 02:50:24.486]  She's just a little puppet.
[02:50:24.486 --> 02:50:25.927]  And I think she starts.
[02:50:26.147 --> 02:50:32.071]  She should start realizing they're sending her on political suicide missions against Trump, against me, against you, name it.
[02:50:32.071 --> 02:50:36.875]  Because our listeners know I'm a goofball, but they know at the end of the day I'm their goofball.
[02:50:36.875 --> 02:50:38.236]  And so you guys are just awesome.
[02:50:38.236 --> 02:50:48.203]  I want to just say here's to the Republic, here's to a real independent press, here's to the First Amendment, and here is to the dinosaur media joining its place in history with the ashes.
[02:50:48.203 --> 02:50:49.464]  So here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:50.425 --> 02:50:57.392]  I only did this a few times when Trump won and of course when we got the carbon tax documents it was all a fraud.
[02:50:57.392 --> 02:51:04.519]  And a few other times because it shows the big juggernaut of the New World Order had to roll out all scared Tom Brokaw.
[02:51:06.843 --> 02:51:10.845]  You know, who looks like he's trying to find his, uh, depends.
[02:51:10.845 --> 02:51:12.185]  Nothing against old people.
[02:51:12.185 --> 02:51:16.167]  It's just, you know, literally snaggletooth up there with his eyes point in different directions.
[02:51:16.167 --> 02:51:21.229]  So here is to folks that aren't scared of being demonized by anti-American scum.
[02:51:21.229 --> 02:51:22.529]  Here is to the real Mavericks.
[02:51:22.529 --> 02:51:23.249]  I salute you all.
[02:51:23.249 --> 02:51:26.051]  This is for you, the viewers and the listeners and our affiliates.
[02:51:26.051 --> 02:51:28.792]  You are the real MVPs that are kicking the global ass.
[02:51:28.792 --> 02:51:29.952]  We salute you.
[02:51:29.952 --> 02:51:30.192]  Cheers.
[02:51:33.865 --> 02:51:34.527]  Not too shabby.
[02:51:34.527 --> 02:51:35.630]  It's pretty good stuff.
[02:51:35.630 --> 02:51:36.271]  Yeah, you know.
[02:51:36.271 --> 02:51:36.893]  Pretty good.
[02:51:36.893 --> 02:51:38.597]  They're really gonna hate these photos tomorrow.
[02:51:38.597 --> 02:51:39.239]  They're cheers.
[02:51:39.239 --> 02:51:41.585]  Right, yeah.
[02:51:41.585 --> 02:51:42.107]  Photo moment.
[02:51:44.639 --> 02:51:54.405]  Yeah, so, in real time we're reading the reaction which is, you know, Brian Stelter who is the one who called you, today essentially called you a pedophile, you know, compared you to them.
[02:51:54.405 --> 02:51:56.366]  Oh, talk about fake news.
[02:51:56.366 --> 02:51:58.627]  We should get the Brian Stelter clip ready please.
[02:51:58.627 --> 02:51:59.027]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:51:59.027 --> 02:51:59.788]  Yeah, that's a great clip.
[02:51:59.788 --> 02:52:05.511]  And he goes, tonight definitely gives Alex Jones more ammo for his anti-media war.
[02:52:05.511 --> 02:52:09.133]  Oh, that piece was so edited that it was just like scrambled.
[02:52:09.133 --> 02:52:09.853]  I mean, I'd be like...
[02:52:12.295 --> 02:52:14.236]  It was... Exactly.
[02:52:14.236 --> 02:52:16.177]  Total, total embarrassment.
[02:52:16.177 --> 02:52:18.057]  Total, total embarrassment.
[02:52:18.057 --> 02:52:19.158]  So it's a good day.
[02:52:19.158 --> 02:52:21.059]  Good day for the victory.
[02:52:21.059 --> 02:52:26.501]  Let's go ahead and go to the Brian Stelter clip where he says... Well, first they play good cop and bad cop.
[02:52:26.501 --> 02:52:28.522]  One of them says, just don't even have money, so evil.
[02:52:28.522 --> 02:52:30.802]  The next guy's, well, I mean, he's like a pedophile.
[02:52:30.802 --> 02:52:32.983]  So, you know, we talked to pedophiles, so it's okay.
[02:52:32.983 --> 02:52:34.284]  Here it is.
[02:52:34.284 --> 02:52:36.565]  Well, you say this segment should not air on NBC.
[02:52:36.565 --> 02:52:36.765]  Why?
[02:52:39.048 --> 02:52:42.409]  Well, I think that covering people like Alex Jones is important.
[02:52:42.409 --> 02:52:43.790]  I should make that clear at the outset.
[02:52:43.790 --> 02:52:50.332]  I think that the rise of these people who foment hate and spew lies is important to our culture.
[02:52:50.332 --> 02:52:53.774]  It's obviously tapping into something that's happening in America.
[02:52:53.774 --> 02:52:58.516]  I just think the context in which this coverage takes place is really important.
[02:52:58.516 --> 02:53:04.618]  And if you were to tell me that NBC were doing an hour-long white paper, so to speak, or an hour-long documentary...
[02:53:05.458 --> 02:53:10.762]  On the rise of these kind of disinformation media empires, I would say that's great.
[02:53:10.762 --> 02:53:20.368]  You know, we should definitely take a hard look at that and what has brought about and what has made it such a really scary part of the media landscape.
[02:53:20.368 --> 02:53:22.110]  It's a really important thing to cover.
[02:53:22.110 --> 02:53:25.432]  And some people are doing a great job of getting out there and coming in.
[02:53:25.432 --> 02:53:28.354]  I don't think getting Alex Jones 15 or 16 is going to be enough.
[02:53:35.358 --> 02:53:46.003]  And as I wrote the other day, Megyn Kelly has not proven herself to be the kind of dog interviewer that would be able to make a meal of this.
[02:53:46.003 --> 02:53:47.404]  I just don't see it.
[02:53:47.404 --> 02:53:53.206]  That's interesting that maybe she is not the right person to be in this position interviewing this conspiracy theorist.
[02:53:53.206 --> 02:53:54.487]  Charlie, what do you say on this?
[02:53:54.487 --> 02:53:55.447]  This conspiracy theorist?
[02:53:55.447 --> 02:54:02.070]  I think that, you know, there's a good case to be made that that's true, especially from what we've seen in the lead up to all of this.
[02:54:02.070 --> 02:54:02.991]  But I think that
[02:54:04.068 --> 02:54:10.535]  There's this sort of dangerous argument right now that there should be, you know, people on a list that can't be given a platform.
[02:54:10.535 --> 02:54:12.036]  Oh, look, he's the actual liberal.
[02:54:12.036 --> 02:54:12.917]  He's smart, though.
[02:54:12.917 --> 02:54:13.718]  Charlie's a smart kid.
[02:54:13.718 --> 02:54:15.820]  No, man, they're actually on there saying ban free speech.
[02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:19.744]  Well, that's what's interesting, too, is that's like a liberal... Back it up, back it up, though.
[02:54:19.744 --> 02:54:20.364]  Somebody interrupt you.
[02:54:20.364 --> 02:54:20.965]  Back it up a few minutes.
[02:54:20.965 --> 02:54:23.588]  I want you to hear where I'm, like, the child molester or whatever.
[02:54:23.588 --> 02:54:25.069]  No, no, he calls you later when you're a virus.
[02:54:25.069 --> 02:54:26.691]  He goes, Alex Jones is a virus.
[02:54:27.051 --> 02:54:32.013]  No, no, that's what I'm saying is, they're so discredited it's like a joke when they're saying the worst possible stuff.
[02:54:32.013 --> 02:54:34.514]  Because everyone knows it's the village idiot.
[02:54:34.514 --> 02:54:36.775]  Here, here, here, finish the clip, here it is.
[02:54:43.152 --> 02:54:57.837]  And there's this whole thing happening online and over his terrestrial radio stations that I, you know, we need to talk about as a country and normal people need to- Even liberals want to- That's exactly what Kelly and her boss, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, said to me a few days ago.
[02:54:57.837 --> 02:55:02.158]  He said, hey, terrorists and child molesters and serial killers have been interviewed on television.
[02:55:02.298 --> 02:55:02.638]  There you go.
[02:55:02.638 --> 02:55:06.021]  What's different about this, about this hate monger, this conspiracy theorist?
[02:55:06.021 --> 02:55:06.462]  Hate monger.
[02:55:06.462 --> 02:55:09.844]  I wonder if what's different... Let's rewind that 10 seconds, because he's... Could you rewind that 30 seconds?
[02:55:09.844 --> 02:55:15.689]  He does compare you to pedophiles, and that is, I believe, Brian Stelter trying to incite death against you, like Megyn Kelly.
[02:55:15.689 --> 02:55:17.231]  So let's... But wait a minute.
[02:55:17.231 --> 02:55:21.554]  Shannon says pedophiles don't exist, or they should be legalized, so... Yeah, let's go back.
[02:55:21.554 --> 02:55:24.997]  He compares you to a serial killer, a child molester.
[02:55:24.997 --> 02:55:26.739]  That is what Brian Stelter compares you to.
[02:55:27.239 --> 02:55:33.002]  Let me tell you, put me in a line up in front of like a hundred citizens and say, which guy looks like the creepy man?
[02:55:33.002 --> 02:55:36.983]  And all the little kids will go, that's the creepy man, Brian Stelter, not me.
[02:55:36.983 --> 02:55:38.624]  Put you next to Anthony Greenberg.
[02:55:38.624 --> 02:55:41.466]  Let me tell you, women run from Stelter.
[02:55:41.466 --> 02:55:43.506]  I'm not being mean.
[02:55:43.506 --> 02:55:46.068]  How much you want to bet Stelter's got big trouble getting...
[02:55:47.836 --> 02:55:56.019]  The broader point, though Alex, I know we're celebrating, but you know me, I'm always serious, I'm always on.
[02:55:56.019 --> 02:56:04.263]  The broader point is that Brian Stelter is trying to incite death against you by comparing you to a child molester, so we really need to hold him to account for making those kind of analogies.
[02:56:04.263 --> 02:56:05.823]  So let's go watch that clip.
[02:56:05.823 --> 02:56:07.644]  Here is Brian Stelter.
[02:56:08.410 --> 02:56:16.894]  Kelly and her boss, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, said to me a few days ago, they said, hey, terrorists and child molesters and serial killers have been interviewed on television.
[02:56:16.894 --> 02:56:20.616]  What's different about this, about this hate monger, this conspiracy theorist?
[02:56:20.616 --> 02:56:27.359]  I wonder if what's different, Charlie, is that the country feels very anxious right now, obviously very divided, as we've been talking about.
[02:56:27.359 --> 02:56:28.919]  And Alex Jones is a virus.
[02:56:28.919 --> 02:56:34.462]  There's maybe a fear of spreading that virus more fully on a big network like the National Broadcasting Company.
[02:56:34.642 --> 02:56:41.343]  And I think that's sort of where Mo and I are kind of agreeing on our arguments, which is that there's a way to interview him.
[02:56:41.343 --> 02:56:48.985]  And there's a way to be, um, just, you know, very intense and to really take him to task and to go at it.
[02:56:48.985 --> 02:56:49.625]  And hey, we don't know.
[02:56:49.625 --> 02:56:50.985]  We haven't seen the full interview yet.
[02:56:50.985 --> 02:56:57.627]  I suspect that if there had been that moment, that stunning moment, that NBC would have released it as a preview.
[02:56:57.627 --> 02:56:58.407]  But we don't know.
[02:56:58.407 --> 02:57:02.268]  We have to see the full interview.
[02:57:02.268 --> 02:57:03.488]  No, I tweet.
[02:57:04.249 --> 02:57:08.855]  Justin, Brian Stelzer is like fascinatingly dorky.
[02:57:08.855 --> 02:57:13.101]  He's actually, he's so good at being dorky, he's like the archetype from Central Casting.
[02:57:13.101 --> 02:57:14.223]  Do you want a dork?
[02:57:14.223 --> 02:57:15.845]  He's not very smart, but he thinks he is.
[02:57:15.845 --> 02:57:19.590]  He's not that educated, but again, you know, I know, you know,
[02:57:20.270 --> 02:57:28.354]  Not to belabor the point, but you are already receiving death threats because of Megyn Kelly and Brian Stelter by making those comparisons about you.
[02:57:28.354 --> 02:57:32.315]  That is him trying to incite death against you and he needs to apologize for that.
[02:57:32.315 --> 02:57:34.396]  Well, that's the whole left thing is death, death, murder.
[02:57:34.396 --> 02:57:38.578]  And they're like, Tom Brokaw's like, oh, we have violence, we need to stop.
[02:57:38.578 --> 02:57:40.699]  But he means just give up, capitulate, let us kill you.
[02:57:42.130 --> 02:57:43.011]  They're death cults.
[02:57:43.011 --> 02:57:44.232]  Naturally they're death cults.
[02:57:44.232 --> 02:57:46.474]  Since we mention this, let's go to the clip.
[02:57:46.474 --> 02:57:49.237]  Fox News compares Alex Jones to murderers and rapists.
[02:57:49.237 --> 02:57:53.321]  But they didn't even do it as bad as Brian Stupor did.
[02:57:53.321 --> 02:57:53.682]  Here it is.
[02:57:54.246 --> 02:58:00.650]  You can't not be moved by listening to some of these San Diego parents and how they think that Alex Jones should not get a platform.
[02:58:00.650 --> 02:58:07.055]  At the same time, he is somebody who President Trump called after the election to thank him for his role.
[02:58:07.055 --> 02:58:09.857]  Trump had gone on his radio show during the campaign.
[02:58:09.857 --> 02:58:18.423]  It's not so much that NBC is critiquing or elevating Alex Jones as it is reflecting the fact that he's an influential guy.
[02:58:18.423 --> 02:58:20.284]  But look, over the years, as you know,
[02:58:20.464 --> 02:58:20.904]  Okay, there you go.
[02:58:20.904 --> 02:58:21.285]  So, what do you say?
[02:58:21.285 --> 02:58:21.465]  Victory.
[02:58:50.819 --> 02:58:51.119]  Really?
[02:58:51.119 --> 02:58:52.200]  Do we really declare victory?
[02:58:52.200 --> 02:58:52.480]  All right.
[02:58:52.480 --> 02:58:53.540]  Big victory.
[02:58:53.540 --> 02:58:55.481]  Good job, man, here.
[02:58:55.481 --> 02:58:57.802]  Here is the Brian Stelter.
[02:58:57.802 --> 02:58:59.403]  Thank God we don't look like him.
[02:58:59.403 --> 02:59:00.263]  Don't pour on my glasses.
[02:59:00.263 --> 02:59:01.023]  I don't sound like him.
[02:59:01.023 --> 02:59:01.964]  We'll be all right.
[02:59:01.964 --> 02:59:02.544]  There we go.
[02:59:02.544 --> 02:59:04.205]  Thank God we don't.
[02:59:04.205 --> 02:59:06.265]  Every day you're not Brian Stelter is a good day.
[02:59:06.265 --> 02:59:14.009]  You know, I think about the Brian Stelters, it makes me think of the Master Drill Sergeant Hartman in full metal jacket.
[02:59:14.009 --> 02:59:17.730]  Looks like the better part of you ran down your mother's ass cracking on the mattress.
[02:59:20.885 --> 02:59:22.089]  There you go, gentlemen.
[02:59:22.089 --> 02:59:25.119]  Here's to what ran down mom's ass crack on Hartman.
[02:59:25.119 --> 02:59:26.523]  Or on Stelter.
[02:59:26.523 --> 02:59:27.646]  Here's your mom's ass crack!
[02:59:31.209 --> 02:59:32.490]  You know I'm openly trolling him.
[03:00:01.394 --> 03:00:02.166]  Go Fucks Miranda!
[03:00:03.305 --> 03:00:05.806]  You're the one that kicked it off, the CNN's ISIS.
[03:00:05.806 --> 03:00:13.709]  Oh, yeah, I mean, there was, um, after that Kathy Griffin thing happened, I just messaged- And then she bitched and complained and cried and said Trump was mean to her.
[03:00:13.709 --> 03:00:15.429]  All he said is it's despicable- He broke me.
[03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:16.850]  And then she bitched everywhere.
[03:00:16.850 --> 03:00:18.630]  He broke me, he broke me!
[03:00:18.630 --> 03:00:31.315]  Yes, I just texted Alex and I go, hey, you know, let's do a thing, a contest where if you can get on air and disrupt peacefully and lawfully their transmissions with the CNN's ISIS thing, then we'll get you, you know, we'll get you taken care of.
[03:00:31.955 --> 03:00:33.497]  And people are doing it.
[03:00:33.497 --> 03:00:36.700]  The first guy, I think George was his name, he did it at DC.
[03:00:36.700 --> 03:00:39.683]  So we're now entering their territory.
[03:00:39.683 --> 03:00:43.066]  There were also Jack Posobiec, Laura Loomer, they went into the play.
[03:00:43.066 --> 03:00:45.248]  So the idea goes like this.
[03:00:45.248 --> 03:00:54.477]  I can't leave my house with maybe Antifa putting a bomb in my car because of the fake news media lies about me and because they are inciting mobs against me, okay?
[03:00:55.117 --> 03:00:56.458]  So maybe you're doing news.
[03:00:56.458 --> 03:00:59.679]  We're not going to be violent like you, but maybe we're going to call you ISIS.
[03:00:59.679 --> 03:01:06.421]  In the back of your head, you're going to wonder, is my protest, is my event, again, peacefully and lawfully.
[03:01:06.421 --> 03:01:08.782]  We disavow all political violence.
[03:01:08.782 --> 03:01:11.383]  We disavow violence of all kinds.
[03:01:11.383 --> 03:01:13.484]  But just like there's the Black Brunch.
[03:01:14.224 --> 03:01:18.306]  Right, where those people, those activists would go in during people's brunches and say things.
[03:01:18.306 --> 03:01:22.047]  Well, I think that's a little bit too far, but you know, the media was all for that.
[03:01:22.047 --> 03:01:23.748]  The media said, oh, this is great.
[03:01:23.748 --> 03:01:27.890]  Anytime there's a disruption on the left by one of our events, the media says that's great.
[03:01:27.890 --> 03:01:29.430]  So our answer to that is okay.
[03:01:30.791 --> 03:01:32.532]  We're in the party now.
[03:01:32.532 --> 03:01:34.412]  We've decided to play by your rules.
[03:01:34.412 --> 03:01:36.473]  But it was your guy that Michael Malice was on earlier.
[03:01:36.473 --> 03:01:39.874]  I mean, he was the one that pointed out, we're the ones with the guns.
[03:01:39.874 --> 03:01:42.976]  I mean, we're like an armed fortress here.
[03:01:42.976 --> 03:01:48.578]  What are people going to do when they just, it's like when they come up and try to beat people up now, they get their asses kicked.
[03:01:49.258 --> 03:01:55.261]  Well, I had that guy when I was in Austin, and they were doing an anti-Trump rally April 15th, and I called Bill Clinton a rapist.
[03:01:55.261 --> 03:02:00.624]  I had a guy literally take a shot at me, and I dodged it, and I punched him right in the face, and he started crying.
[03:02:00.624 --> 03:02:02.766]  That's why there's no video of the event.
[03:02:02.766 --> 03:02:07.768]  Everybody had their cameras on at that protest rally at the state capitol.
[03:02:07.768 --> 03:02:09.049]  There were cameras everywhere.
[03:02:09.049 --> 03:02:10.710]  So why is there no video of me?
[03:02:10.710 --> 03:02:13.432]  Well, because I popped this guy in the head, and he started crying.
[03:02:13.432 --> 03:02:14.792]  His eyes welled up, and they cried.
[03:02:14.792 --> 03:02:17.214]  They cried when he... Yeah, it was beautiful.
[03:02:17.834 --> 03:02:18.715]  I think this is how we win.
[03:02:18.715 --> 03:02:23.281]  We have to take the meme warfare that we have online to the real world.
[03:02:23.281 --> 03:02:27.926]  And again, peacefully and lawfully, we have to start trolling the real world, trolling the mainstream media.
[03:02:27.926 --> 03:02:32.272]  Yeah, like with that, uh, who's that washed up Transformer guy?
[03:02:32.272 --> 03:02:33.012]  He will not divide us?
[03:02:34.609 --> 03:02:35.249]  Shia LaBeouf.
[03:02:35.249 --> 03:02:36.510]  Shia LaBeouf, yeah.
[03:02:36.510 --> 03:02:40.872]  Autobots, transform and roll out in the form of an asshole named Shia LaBeouf.
[03:02:40.872 --> 03:02:42.673]  Yeah, this is Nikki.
[03:02:42.673 --> 03:02:47.095]  She actually sent that, so we'll make sure she gets her check if they go back about 10, 15 minutes.
[03:02:47.095 --> 03:02:48.615]  Yeah, I need help.
[03:02:48.615 --> 03:02:50.096]  Yeah, this is beautiful though.
[03:02:50.096 --> 03:02:51.177]  There are so many great entries.
[03:02:51.177 --> 03:02:53.898]  Because it completely just destroys the brand.
[03:02:54.861 --> 03:02:57.402]  Yeah, and that is again why they're so upset.
[03:02:57.402 --> 03:02:58.083]  Uh-oh.
[03:02:58.083 --> 03:03:01.104]  Protesters inside the Delacorte Theater for the last showing of Julius Caesar.
[03:03:01.104 --> 03:03:01.924]  Stay tuned.
[03:03:01.924 --> 03:03:02.645]  Oh, here we go.
[03:03:02.645 --> 03:03:06.927]  Okay, so they're, um... So the Julius Caesar in the park, kill Trump thing has begun.
[03:03:06.927 --> 03:03:07.467]  Yeah.
[03:03:07.467 --> 03:03:09.288]  And we have a word that... We're gonna do that again tonight.
[03:03:09.288 --> 03:03:10.588]  People are gonna take over it again.
[03:03:10.588 --> 03:03:12.910]  We have nothing to do with it, of course, though.
[03:03:12.910 --> 03:03:15.371]  Ah, here's to the folks that did that.
[03:03:15.371 --> 03:03:19.313]  Oh, they're being defeated.
[03:03:19.313 --> 03:03:19.993]  Peaceful protest.
[03:03:21.471 --> 03:03:23.760]  They're back tonight.
[03:03:23.760 --> 03:03:26.371]  So I knew this earlier by the way, so there's going to be another...
[03:03:27.785 --> 03:03:33.228]  Interesting event, so... But look, it says how outrage built over Shakespeare's depiction of Trump.
[03:03:33.228 --> 03:03:37.611]  Even the New York Times admits it's Trump, but then when they tweeted us, they go, you crazy people!
[03:03:37.611 --> 03:03:38.812]  This has nothing to do with Trump!
[03:03:38.812 --> 03:03:40.253]  What the hell's your problem?
[03:03:40.253 --> 03:03:41.453]  You're crazy!
[03:03:41.453 --> 03:03:42.354]  But it doesn't matter.
[03:03:42.354 --> 03:03:42.994]  That's the whole thing.
[03:03:42.994 --> 03:03:45.756]  But I know they play this game like we're retarded.
[03:03:45.756 --> 03:03:48.338]  Yeah, I don't even read the articles about me.
[03:03:48.338 --> 03:03:50.639]  Because they're so boring and predictable.
[03:03:50.639 --> 03:03:52.360]  You know, it used to be... Well, it is a shake and bake.
[03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:56.703]  Every article, other than Wurzel, who I don't even like, but at least he gets a few things right,
[03:03:57.003 --> 03:03:58.084]  I can read Wurzel's articles.
[03:03:58.084 --> 03:03:59.885]  Actually, you can tell he wrote them.
[03:03:59.885 --> 03:04:02.647]  I'm telling you, I'll read hundreds of liberal articles a week.
[03:04:02.647 --> 03:04:05.289]  It's like the same five articles recut together.
[03:04:05.289 --> 03:04:06.650]  You know how boring that is?
[03:04:06.650 --> 03:04:11.434]  I almost want to marry Wurzel now, just because, you know, not that I'm gay or anything.
[03:04:11.434 --> 03:04:12.614]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[03:04:12.614 --> 03:04:15.837]  It's that it's so original that a liberal actually wrote something original.
[03:04:16.397 --> 03:04:17.137]  Yeah, he does his own homework.
[03:04:17.137 --> 03:04:19.018]  Have you seen how it's like all the stories are complete?
[03:04:19.018 --> 03:04:20.699]  That was satire, by the way.
[03:04:20.699 --> 03:04:21.540]  Well, people get mad at me.
[03:04:21.540 --> 03:04:22.760]  They're like, how dare you?
[03:04:22.760 --> 03:04:24.001]  How dare you link to BuzzFeed?
[03:04:24.001 --> 03:04:32.865]  And I was like, look, man, you know, I'm so used to just copy and paste jobs about me and about the issues that, hey, you know, the kid might be wrong and he might be a liberal and he might not.
[03:04:32.865 --> 03:04:33.946]  At least he's trying to get it.
[03:04:34.406 --> 03:04:39.167]  At least he's trying to actually understand what is going on and everybody's got a point of view.
[03:04:39.167 --> 03:04:42.568]  And unlike the fake news media, we don't know platform people.
[03:04:42.568 --> 03:04:47.150]  So if there's actually a well-written hate article about me, I'll be the first to link to it.
[03:04:47.150 --> 03:04:48.210]  But there are so many of them.
[03:04:48.210 --> 03:04:49.110]  They're just boring.
[03:04:49.110 --> 03:04:50.511]  I'm like, dude, I can't even read this.
[03:04:50.511 --> 03:04:51.611]  Nobody reads that crap anyway.
[03:04:51.611 --> 03:04:52.891]  No one actually reads the content.
[03:04:52.891 --> 03:04:53.652]  It's just like a headline.
[03:04:53.652 --> 03:04:54.212]  It's the headline.
[03:04:54.212 --> 03:04:54.932]  It's a headline war.
[03:04:54.932 --> 03:04:55.512]  That's all it is.
[03:04:55.512 --> 03:04:56.572]  It's who can write the wittiest.
[03:04:56.572 --> 03:04:58.153]  Well, that's why they have like New York Times headlines.
[03:04:58.693 --> 03:04:59.613]  They've been caught again.
[03:04:59.613 --> 03:05:09.797]  I keep obsessing on this because it's so bold to have the New York Times and Daily Beast, all of them, running a headline.
[03:05:09.797 --> 03:05:15.560]  Right-wing conspiracy theories claiming that Comey, you know, never said Trump told him to stop the investigation.
[03:05:15.560 --> 03:05:18.101]  Then we have the videos!
[03:05:18.101 --> 03:05:19.721]  Yeah, that's why we're winning though.
[03:05:19.721 --> 03:05:20.362]  Let them keep lying.
[03:05:20.362 --> 03:05:21.062]  That's why, again,
[03:05:22.492 --> 03:05:30.015]  What they want to do is they want right now, you know, during the whole episode there, you know, millions of people watched all the videos, the live streams, listened to the show.
[03:05:30.015 --> 03:05:32.355]  So the end game is they got to take us off the air.
[03:05:32.355 --> 03:05:34.496]  That's the only way that they can get us.
[03:05:34.496 --> 03:05:36.637]  Why do you think Megan is so scared?
[03:05:38.510 --> 03:05:40.610]  Well, they're all scared, because we're coming for them.
[03:05:40.610 --> 03:05:41.251]  And they know it.
[03:05:41.251 --> 03:05:43.131]  And she makes $20 million a year!
[03:05:43.131 --> 03:05:43.971]  Right, she's going to lose her job.
[03:05:43.971 --> 03:05:44.591]  I don't make $20 million a year.
[03:05:44.591 --> 03:05:45.631]  That's the whole point.
[03:05:45.631 --> 03:05:49.152]  Selling pharmaceuticals, selling drugs that poison people.
[03:05:49.152 --> 03:06:04.375]  More people die of overdoses from Tylenol every year than from nearly any other drug, because people, if they have a hangover, they'll take a Tylenol and they don't realize that acetaminophen is actually toxic on your liver, and if your liver is detoxing to alcohol, then you're going to get sick and die, right?
[03:06:05.075 --> 03:06:06.476]  You'll never hear an expose on that.
[03:06:06.476 --> 03:06:09.737]  Should Tylenol warn people better about the side effects of drink?
[03:06:09.737 --> 03:06:11.457]  No, no, no, because then you're going to lose that big sponsor.
[03:06:11.457 --> 03:06:15.318]  And I've talked to top, I mean, it's well known, they would have never approved Tylenol now.
[03:06:15.318 --> 03:06:19.039]  I mean, it's reportedly like worse than like drinking a bottle of Jack Daniels every day.
[03:06:19.039 --> 03:06:20.800]  They say, like you said, you mix it with alcohol, you're dead.
[03:06:21.740 --> 03:06:23.001]  Oh, Tylenol's poison.
[03:06:23.001 --> 03:06:25.563]  No, there's no way in the world it could be approved.
[03:06:25.563 --> 03:06:28.265]  But, again, you're never going to see that from the fake news media.
[03:06:28.265 --> 03:06:30.687]  You know, Tylenol probably, sue me, go ahead and sue me, guys.
[03:06:30.687 --> 03:06:32.908]  You know, everybody every day telling me they're going to sue me, Tylenol next.
[03:06:32.908 --> 03:06:34.689]  They're called, Tylenol's poison.
[03:06:34.689 --> 03:06:37.812]  If you don't like it, then sue me, Tylenol.
[03:06:37.812 --> 03:06:42.515]  What about the article where they said, I'm horrible because I made the stock market go up?
[03:06:42.515 --> 03:06:43.175]  That's terrible.
[03:06:45.410 --> 03:06:53.555]  I think it's crazy because we, all of us, we answer only to, in your case, the listeners, in your case, your viewers, in our case, our users.
[03:06:53.555 --> 03:06:55.416]  We don't answer to big corporate advertisers.
[03:06:55.416 --> 03:06:58.658]  We don't have any venture capitalists that we took millions of dollars from.
[03:06:58.658 --> 03:07:07.723]  So that's why we have the power to say these things and to criticize certain things because we don't have to answer for it in the form of getting our cash cow cut from advertisers.
[03:07:08.877 --> 03:07:11.741]  So it's the elites freaking out, they're not in control.
[03:07:11.741 --> 03:07:16.346]  I know I'm stating an understatement, or overstatement, or obvious statement.
[03:07:16.346 --> 03:07:19.811]  But yeah, so again, where does this all end?
[03:07:19.811 --> 03:07:20.351]  There is no end.
[03:07:21.676 --> 03:07:24.119]  You know, we wake up, you go to war every day.
[03:07:24.119 --> 03:07:24.759]  There is no end.
[03:07:24.759 --> 03:07:27.182]  The information war doesn't end.
[03:07:27.182 --> 03:07:38.814]  Again, I'm new to this because I didn't realize that the National Review, Weekly Standard, and all these other so-called right-winger conservative publications were actually in cahoots with the globalists.
[03:07:38.814 --> 03:07:43.779]  So the minute we stop doing what we're doing is the minute the lies become
[03:07:44.360 --> 03:07:44.940]  It's the truth.
[03:07:44.940 --> 03:07:48.762]  I'll tell ya, that's what's scary is that people think like we're the ones that are winning.
[03:07:48.762 --> 03:07:54.605]  It's them online, spreading the articles, taking action, shooting videos, sending us stuff, doing their own stories.
[03:07:54.605 --> 03:07:56.486]  It's the listeners that have to keep kicking ass.
[03:07:56.486 --> 03:07:57.986]  We're just little focal points.
[03:07:57.986 --> 03:07:59.507]  Wait, something happened tonight.
[03:07:59.507 --> 03:08:00.888]  Getting video right now.
[03:08:00.888 --> 03:08:05.730]  So, breaking news, there was a disruption at the Shakespeare in the Park.
[03:08:05.730 --> 03:08:07.651]  This is, of course, breaking news.
[03:08:07.651 --> 03:08:09.912]  I don't have video yet, I don't have audio as soon as I do.
[03:08:09.912 --> 03:08:11.433]  Okay, this man's... So, yeah, yeah, we're...
[03:08:12.293 --> 03:08:18.459]  We're waiting on that, but we do have confirmation that the Shakespeare in the Park did have a happening, so we are awaiting that.
[03:08:18.459 --> 03:08:19.940]  Then they claim we're anti-free speech.
[03:08:19.940 --> 03:08:23.183]  It's the left disrupting stuff everywhere, then calling for everyone to be murdered.
[03:08:23.183 --> 03:08:26.546]  We're just disrupting, saying please stop calling for murder.
[03:08:26.546 --> 03:08:27.187]  Exactly.
[03:08:27.187 --> 03:08:29.409]  We're telling them to disavow political violence.
[03:08:29.409 --> 03:08:29.929]  Alright, well listen.
[03:08:29.929 --> 03:08:31.090]  Which shouldn't be hard.
[03:08:31.090 --> 03:08:36.716]  I want to air a few tapes and let you guys take over for like an hour, and then I'm going to be back tomorrow to break all this down.
[03:08:39.178 --> 03:08:40.419]  Big takeaways from this.
[03:08:40.419 --> 03:08:42.241]  The MSM is so pathetic.
[03:08:42.241 --> 03:08:50.969]  They thought they could have a two-week PR stunt against New Media, and then have some big victory against us, and then roll out Tom Brokaw out of some crypt.
[03:08:50.969 --> 03:08:53.292]  This was a total defeat for them.
[03:08:53.292 --> 03:08:58.116]  Looks like some kind of van attack in London.
[03:08:58.116 --> 03:08:59.137]  So there might be more breaking news.
[03:08:59.137 --> 03:09:00.559]  Well, that's not Muslims.
[03:09:02.250 --> 03:09:03.090]  There's a lot going on, guys.
[03:09:03.090 --> 03:09:04.331]  There's a lot going on.
[03:09:04.331 --> 03:09:06.351]  Well, no, actually, let's pray for those that have been attacked.
[03:09:06.351 --> 03:09:09.012]  But seriously, it's, again, I keep going back to this.
[03:09:09.012 --> 03:09:09.912]  They're pathetic.
[03:09:09.912 --> 03:09:12.253]  They're a joke.
[03:09:12.253 --> 03:09:14.153]  That's why they're losing.
[03:09:14.153 --> 03:09:16.274]  They don't have endurance.
[03:09:16.274 --> 03:09:17.014]  They don't have energy.
[03:09:17.014 --> 03:09:17.354]  They can't.
[03:09:17.354 --> 03:09:18.855]  We could do this for, you know, 24 hours.
[03:09:18.855 --> 03:09:20.255]  We're working, what, 12, 18 hours a day?
[03:09:20.255 --> 03:09:21.275]  Yeah, every day.
[03:09:21.275 --> 03:09:23.176]  It's a Sunday, you know.
[03:09:23.176 --> 03:09:27.397]  And I'm up at the gym, and then I'm, you know, doing streams with him all day, and I'm back here again.
[03:09:27.397 --> 03:09:27.937]  Stamina.
[03:09:27.937 --> 03:09:30.678]  Following breaking news right now, so those of you who don't know,
[03:09:32.071 --> 03:09:38.274]  So for those of you who don't know, there is a reported vehicle attack in London.
[03:09:38.274 --> 03:09:39.374]  Another van attack.
[03:09:39.374 --> 03:09:43.696]  This is a developing story, so I don't really know.
[03:09:43.696 --> 03:09:44.717]  So yeah, we don't know yet.
[03:09:44.717 --> 03:09:46.377]  We're still, you know, developing it right now.
[03:09:46.377 --> 03:09:52.920]  There are also protesters in front of the stage in Shakespeare in the Park.
[03:09:52.920 --> 03:09:55.902]  So there could be another event going on there right now.
[03:09:55.902 --> 03:09:56.682]  There's so much news.
[03:09:56.682 --> 03:09:58.223]  I mean, and that is again, you know,
[03:09:59.477 --> 03:10:00.298]  It really is again.
[03:10:00.298 --> 03:10:02.339]  Just know this, we're on the march, they're on the run.
[03:10:02.339 --> 03:10:04.120]  Keep taking action peacefully.
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:04.921]  We're gonna win.
[03:10:04.921 --> 03:10:06.161]  And share the links.
[03:10:06.161 --> 03:10:12.305]  I mean, share the links and go to Infowarsstore.com and get the products and support the mission.
[03:10:12.305 --> 03:10:14.927]  Because, you know, I wasn't hung out with Alex today.
[03:10:14.927 --> 03:10:16.328]  I can tell you he does not drive a Ferrari.
[03:10:16.328 --> 03:10:21.031]  I won't tell you what kind of car he drives because that, you know, Megyn Kelly's fans might then stalk him.
[03:10:21.571 --> 03:10:27.937]  But the money isn't going to Ferraris and private jets or anything like that.
[03:10:27.937 --> 03:10:31.240]  The money is going to fund journalism, to fund real news.
[03:10:31.240 --> 03:10:39.206]  That is why NBC attacked Alex Jones so viciously, because readers support and viewers support the mission here.
[03:10:39.206 --> 03:10:40.027]  This is self-funded.
[03:10:40.027 --> 03:10:41.769]  There are no advertising boycotts.
[03:10:41.769 --> 03:10:44.111]  They went after Bill O'Reilly with the advertising boycotts.
[03:10:44.511 --> 03:10:47.733]  They went after Sean Hannity with the advertising boycotts.
[03:10:47.733 --> 03:10:53.735]  They almost got him off air until we actually fought back, which is what the conservatives never do.
[03:10:53.735 --> 03:10:57.157]  So at theinfowarrestore.com, there is free shipping right now.
[03:10:57.157 --> 03:10:58.117]  Is the free shipping?
[03:10:58.117 --> 03:10:58.498]  Yes, sir.
[03:10:58.498 --> 03:11:00.138]  We've been live almost for four hours.
[03:11:00.138 --> 03:11:01.839]  The great crews up here on Sunday.
[03:11:01.839 --> 03:11:05.701]  We have great products everybody needs, and that's the final equation is financially supporting us.
[03:11:05.701 --> 03:11:09.743]  Getting game-changing nootropics for your brain, like BrainForce, the X2 for your
[03:11:10.263 --> 03:11:12.305]  They came in on a Sunday.
[03:11:12.305 --> 03:11:15.988]  That is how committed, that is how committed everybody here is.
[03:11:15.988 --> 03:11:17.289]  People came in on a Sunday.
[03:11:17.289 --> 03:11:19.311]  Dads came in during Father's Day.
[03:11:19.311 --> 03:11:32.923]  I'm missing my first Father's Day with my own daughter because what good is it, what good is it for me to be at home with my daughter if the world is going to blow up because the fake news prevails, because the terrorism happens, because the left-wing domestic, what good is it?
[03:11:33.463 --> 03:11:34.664]  That's the same thing with the money.
[03:11:34.664 --> 03:11:38.985]  That's why the money from Infowarsstore.com goes right back into hiring more people.
[03:11:38.985 --> 03:11:42.887]  We're about to expand big time because it's a death battle.
[03:11:42.887 --> 03:11:47.848]  I'm gonna go to this clip and come back and have you guys take over for about 30-40 minutes and I really appreciate the listeners, the viewers, everybody else.
[03:11:47.848 --> 03:11:49.209]  Tomorrow we'll be taking a lot of calls.
[03:11:49.209 --> 03:11:51.870]  We'll take a lot of calls on air tomorrow, 11am when it kicks off.
[03:11:51.870 --> 03:11:54.151]  We'll take calls all 3-4 hours.
[03:11:54.151 --> 03:11:58.872]  But I wanted to play Scott Adams describes how to radicalize a potential assassin.
[03:11:58.872 --> 03:11:59.873]  The left knows
[03:12:01.277 --> 03:12:04.678]  That when they're pushing murder and death and killing, it's going to cause this.
[03:12:04.678 --> 03:12:09.759]  But I don't understand their thought process, because they're going to start a war with an armed citizenry?
[03:12:09.759 --> 03:12:16.240]  They're going to try to bring in martial law and enslave us when they're not even a warrior class of people?
[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:18.980]  They are a dependent class, no matter what color they are.
[03:12:18.980 --> 03:12:20.541]  They are endemic victims.
[03:12:20.541 --> 03:12:23.201]  So it's almost like a baby temper tantrum.
[03:12:23.201 --> 03:12:27.342]  So I want to play this clip, have you guys take over, and then ask the question, where's this going?
[03:12:27.822 --> 03:12:29.283]  Again, I want to thank you all for watching.
[03:12:29.283 --> 03:12:31.343]  Continued coverage ongoing.
[03:12:31.343 --> 03:12:34.785]  And we'll be releasing some of the behind-the-scenes Megan interview, but she flopped so bad.
[03:12:34.785 --> 03:12:38.987]  I'm still going to do it because I said I would, but this is a complete rout.
[03:12:38.987 --> 03:12:40.807]  These people are a complete joke.
[03:12:40.807 --> 03:12:45.269]  I mean, as pathetic as I am, quite frankly, in a lot of my performance, even though it's edited,
[03:12:47.390 --> 03:12:49.811]  I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above them.
[03:12:49.811 --> 03:12:51.771]  So again, it's not too hard to beat these people.
[03:12:51.771 --> 03:12:55.873]  Breaking news, man arrested after van plows into people outside of a London mosque.
[03:12:55.873 --> 03:12:59.294]  So we have more... No, outside a London mosque.
[03:12:59.294 --> 03:13:02.655]  Anyway, those clips, I'll follow up the story and see what we've got going on.
[03:13:02.655 --> 03:13:05.516]  But it has nothing to do with Islam.
[03:13:07.628 --> 03:13:08.489]  Right, Cernovich?
[03:13:08.489 --> 03:13:09.349]  Never.
[03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:10.850]  Then they say we're anti-Islam.
[03:13:10.850 --> 03:13:16.313]  Yeah, I'm anti-Stone Age insanity, women wearing beekeeper suits.
[03:13:16.313 --> 03:13:22.897]  Well, I interviewed a Muslim, actually, who believes that Muslims should stay in Muslim countries because it makes them less likely to sin.
[03:13:22.897 --> 03:13:26.159]  What about how more and more Muslims just want to be free and actually becoming heretics?
[03:13:26.159 --> 03:13:27.560]  People go, oh, I know a Muslim, they're really cool.
[03:13:27.560 --> 03:13:33.143]  Yeah, because they're not a Muslim.
[03:13:33.143 --> 03:13:34.664]  I mean, seriously.
[03:13:34.664 --> 03:13:35.844]  Seriously, think about this.
[03:13:35.844 --> 03:13:36.625]  I mean, these people
[03:13:38.823 --> 03:13:41.205]  I don't want to just bash some group of people, folks.
[03:13:41.205 --> 03:13:42.727]  Islamic countries are not fun.
[03:13:42.727 --> 03:13:48.332]  Well that's why, you know, if they want to come over here and adopt American values, that's the whole thing.
[03:13:48.332 --> 03:13:59.703]  That's the thing, this is a good point to address because I've always addressed it with my people is that Muslims who come to America and want to adapt to Western values and Western cultures, you'll never hear me criticize them.
[03:13:59.983 --> 03:14:13.603]  You'll never hear me say, oh my God, if you want to come in and you want to conform... If you want to keep some of that tradition or whatever without cutting your daughter's genitals off or beekeeper suits or blowing stuff up or, you know, getting on welfare and doing nothing, you want to come here and vestigially keep your Islamicism, that's fine.
[03:14:13.603 --> 03:14:15.085]  As long as you're a big, fat, juicy heretic.
[03:14:15.666 --> 03:14:16.787]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:14:16.787 --> 03:14:19.808]  But we don't want people to come over and change the American way of life.
[03:14:19.808 --> 03:14:21.288]  You have, you know, daughters.
[03:14:21.288 --> 03:14:21.768]  I have a daughter.
[03:14:21.768 --> 03:14:23.769]  It's like them in Germany at Oktoberfest.
[03:14:23.769 --> 03:14:28.151]  They had to cancel it, like in Berlin and Cologne, because they'll beat people up drinking beer.
[03:14:28.151 --> 03:14:29.472]  I can't believe the Germans roll over to that.
[03:14:29.472 --> 03:14:30.272]  I'm drinking a beer somehow.
[03:14:30.632 --> 03:14:31.093]  The Germans do.
[03:14:52.634 --> 03:14:56.737]  Yeah, they grab him, throw him up against a car, and just take turns, 20 people.
[03:14:56.737 --> 03:15:02.482]  Which, that's so vile, I can't imagine even, you know, in any context, wanting to do that.
[03:15:02.482 --> 03:15:03.683]  But it's common.
[03:15:03.683 --> 03:15:13.531]  But then, meanwhile, we're told that there's a rape culture in college universities, and that if you have a few beers and you have sex after a few beers, somehow that's rape, rape culture's bad.
[03:15:13.531 --> 03:15:17.334]  Yeah, because if the next day she decided she didn't want to do it because you're both drunk, now that's rape.
[03:15:17.814 --> 03:15:23.479]  Yeah, so Muslims are allowed to rape because it's their culture, but then if a woman gets drunk and has sex, oh, you date raped her.
[03:15:23.479 --> 03:15:27.563]  Yeah, so this whole migration is actually rape culture, but they won't address it.
[03:15:27.563 --> 03:15:28.804]  Bill Clinton is a rapist.
[03:15:28.804 --> 03:15:30.346]  They won't address that.
[03:15:30.346 --> 03:15:31.667]  Anthony Weiner is a pedophile.
[03:15:31.667 --> 03:15:32.648]  They won't address that.
[03:15:32.648 --> 03:15:33.429]  Jacob Schwartz
[03:15:33.789 --> 03:15:40.794]  Who is a campaign worker for Bill de Blasio, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who actually insulted you with the Megyn Kelly thing.
[03:15:40.794 --> 03:15:49.860]  His staffer, child pornographer, Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, pictured in pictures with this child pornographer, Jacob Schwartz.
[03:15:49.860 --> 03:15:52.581]  You know who hosted Jacob Schwartz and gave him a platform?
[03:15:52.581 --> 03:15:53.282]  CNN.
[03:15:53.282 --> 03:15:53.942]  He went on to CNN.
[03:15:55.607 --> 03:15:59.150]  He's a child pornographer and CNN will welcome child pornographers on.
[03:15:59.150 --> 03:16:00.051]  That's the world we live in.
[03:16:00.051 --> 03:16:02.334]  That's how vile these people are in the media.
[03:16:02.334 --> 03:16:04.095]  But meanwhile, but you're the problem.
[03:16:04.095 --> 03:16:07.539]  So if you're a pedophile like Anthony Weiner, they want to make you the president.
[03:16:07.539 --> 03:16:16.969]  If you're spreading child pornography like Jacob Schwartz was, then they will put you on CNN and feature you and listen to what you have to say and praise you and give you a platform.
[03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:27.695]  That's the guy who shouldn't have a platform, but they'll give the pedophiles a platform to normalize it, to get people used to seeing pedophiles because they want to lower the age of consent, of course, to, you know, eight or nine.
[03:16:27.695 --> 03:16:29.596]  Look at that article from the BBC the other day.
[03:16:29.596 --> 03:16:30.277]  Was it yesterday?
[03:16:30.277 --> 03:16:30.697]  Yeah.
[03:16:30.697 --> 03:16:32.358]  Trying to normalize it?
[03:16:32.358 --> 03:16:32.798]  Yeah, the BBC.
[03:16:32.798 --> 03:16:37.821]  Oh, they've had a salon with, like, a creepy guy, and they're like, I like five-year-old girls.
[03:16:37.821 --> 03:16:38.722]  They're, like, dancing around.
[03:16:38.722 --> 03:16:41.223]  They'll probably take my clip of me imitating him and say, I said that.
[03:16:41.223 --> 03:16:43.705]  You know, like, Jones says he likes, you know.
[03:16:43.705 --> 03:16:44.285]  Right.
[03:16:44.285 --> 03:16:45.226]  Uh-oh, we got a picture.
[03:16:47.266 --> 03:16:53.351]  We got folks running up on stage, Shakespeare in the Park.
[03:16:53.351 --> 03:16:55.453]  This is breaking news right now, breaking news.
[03:16:55.453 --> 03:16:59.176]  We have people running up to the stage, Shakespeare in the Park.
[03:16:59.176 --> 03:17:14.569]  Right now I just got this from a source, so we're, you know, we're finding out what exactly happened, what transpired, I don't know, but with the nature of breaking news we can only show things as it's happening, and then of course we'll update it as we get more details and as I get more tips from my sources right now.
[03:17:15.143 --> 03:17:16.123]  Alright, great job.
[03:17:16.123 --> 03:17:17.784]  Alright, we're going to go to this tape.
[03:17:17.784 --> 03:17:19.885]  We're going to come back and let you guys take over in the closing.
[03:17:19.885 --> 03:17:21.706]  Great job to the crew.
[03:17:21.706 --> 03:17:40.034]  But I tell you, emblematically bringing out, I love old people, but when they bring some guy 15 years out of retirement, roll him up, and he looks like he doesn't know what planet he's on, he goes, oh, races, oh, here's the video.
[03:17:40.034 --> 03:17:42.356]  Can we play the audio of this?
[03:17:42.356 --> 03:17:42.816]  Go ahead.
[03:17:42.816 --> 03:17:43.256]  Six seconds.
[03:17:46.297 --> 03:17:47.678]  Oh, they're all so pissed off.
[03:17:47.678 --> 03:17:51.660]  We're going to interrupt all your events, but what the hell are you doing interrupting our events?
[03:18:09.528 --> 03:18:10.509]  No, no, it isn't real.
[03:18:10.509 --> 03:18:11.289]  It isn't even real.
[03:18:11.289 --> 03:18:11.989]  That's the whole point.
[03:18:11.989 --> 03:18:14.831]  And they abated the switch because they said it was still going on.
[03:18:14.831 --> 03:18:17.392]  They end the reel and we like have people storm.
[03:18:17.392 --> 03:18:20.193]  We talk to folks who are storming an innocent event.
[03:18:20.193 --> 03:18:25.436]  Yeah, so here I'll, yeah, so protesters disrupt final performance of Trump assassination play in Central Park.
[03:18:25.436 --> 03:18:26.977]  Liberal hate kills.
[03:18:26.977 --> 03:18:28.037]  There's a video here.
[03:18:28.037 --> 03:18:29.678]  I'm going to go ahead and text that right now.
[03:18:29.678 --> 03:18:31.999]  So hopefully... No, I guess that's another Trump look-a-like they're killing.
[03:18:31.999 --> 03:18:32.880]  Everybody's copying it.
[03:18:33.743 --> 03:18:35.706]  So yeah, there's a new, brand new thing.
[03:18:35.706 --> 03:18:38.429]  So hold on, let me text this story so we can get it pulled up.
[03:18:38.429 --> 03:18:41.694]  Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit actually I think broke this.
[03:18:41.694 --> 03:18:49.985]  So if you want to go to Gateway Pundit, at Gateway Pundit, that's Jim Hoft right now and it looks like he has the video.
[03:18:50.717 --> 03:18:56.161]  I don't have the video just yet, but that'll be interesting, that'll be look forward to, yeah.
[03:18:56.161 --> 03:18:59.304]  So it's right now on Twitter, it's at Gateway Pundit.
[03:18:59.304 --> 03:19:01.265]  Jim Hoft, I also just retweeted it, you can get the article.
[03:19:01.265 --> 03:19:04.588]  And you know, it's a good feeling knowing there's all these other organizations as well.
[03:19:04.588 --> 03:19:08.711]  Because sometimes I'm tired and I see something and I go, oh, somebody don't handle it.
[03:19:08.711 --> 03:19:10.092]  Ten years ago it wasn't that case.
[03:19:10.092 --> 03:19:11.633]  No, it's a different world.
[03:19:11.633 --> 03:19:13.314]  All right, gentlemen, you're kicking ass.
[03:19:13.314 --> 03:19:19.059]  Oh, look at this, Germany says 100 million African refugees, they mean Muslims, could head north soon.
[03:19:20.714 --> 03:19:23.935]  So the answer is capitulate, let more in, or they'll bring more.
[03:19:23.935 --> 03:19:33.519]  Let's go to this Scott Adams describes how to radicalize a potential assassin, and then we'll have the final installment with our guest host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:19:33.519 --> 03:19:34.419]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:19:34.419 --> 03:19:38.560]  Megyn Kelly blew herself up, not me.
[03:19:38.560 --> 03:19:42.522]  One of the traps when you're watching the news is you think you have it all.
[03:19:43.414 --> 03:19:47.156]  Or that you've considered all the angles or that people have talked about everything.
[03:19:47.156 --> 03:19:49.337]  Yeah, nobody's even close.
[03:19:49.337 --> 03:19:52.499]  There's an enormous, most important part.
[03:19:52.499 --> 03:19:53.700]  In fact, the only part.
[03:19:53.700 --> 03:20:00.184]  I would argue the only part that's important in this discussion of, have people been radicalized by the media or social media?
[03:20:00.184 --> 03:20:04.906]  The only part that's important is the part that I haven't seen anybody talk about.
[03:20:04.906 --> 03:20:06.667]  So I'm going to talk about it.
[03:20:06.667 --> 03:20:07.548]  So what's missing
[03:20:08.154 --> 03:20:24.510]  Like, deeply missing in this whole conversation is somebody who has an ounce of training in cognitive science, somebody better than me, on these shows to say, well, here are the messages that, you know, the left is putting out, here are the messages that the right's putting out.
[03:20:24.510 --> 03:20:28.454]  Which ones of these, hey, Christina, which one of these are weaponized?
[03:20:31.371 --> 03:20:40.119]  Some of the messages from both sides, I would say are weaponized and you could absolutely blame them for influencing people.
[03:20:40.119 --> 03:20:44.863]  Now the reason, yes, dark, but much of it is not.
[03:20:44.863 --> 03:20:58.054]  So I would say that if you were to compare the comparisons of Trump to a dark, strong man who was going to round people up for concentration camps, which is sort of the messaging coming out of the left.
[03:20:59.268 --> 03:21:10.737]  That is unambiguously a, let's say it's a moral justification for murder.
[03:21:10.737 --> 03:21:20.724]  If you think there's an actual Hitler, an actual literal Hitler coming to power, you have the moral authority to assassinate him.
[03:21:20.724 --> 03:21:26.589]  Now most people are not motivated and most people aren't motivated to do anything, much less assassinate.
[03:21:27.761 --> 03:21:43.983]  But when you're talking about, you know, hundreds of millions of people, and let's say tens of billions, there might be 10 million people in this country, and 300 whatever million, there might be 10 million people who are close enough to the line of, gosh, I think I need to kill this guy,
[03:21:44.703 --> 03:21:47.344]  That a little messaging would make the difference.
[03:21:47.344 --> 03:21:53.868]  Now, it won't make any difference to 99, you know, 95 percent, whatever, of people.
[03:21:53.868 --> 03:22:01.091]  Most people are going to hear, you know, are going to see the murder of the president in a play and say, well, it's just a play.
[03:22:01.091 --> 03:22:02.152]  It doesn't mean anything.
[03:22:02.152 --> 03:22:03.813]  Most people will.
[03:22:03.813 --> 03:22:10.056]  So, if you're on the side that says people are responsible for their own behavior, you don't know anything about science.
[03:22:11.092 --> 03:22:17.036]  Because science knows that people can be influenced, just not every one of them.
[03:22:17.036 --> 03:22:21.960]  And it knows that people won't know why they were influenced, because you can ask them later and they won't know why.
[03:22:21.960 --> 03:22:23.941]  Right?
[03:22:23.941 --> 03:22:37.131]  So this whole notion from the left, or even some libertarians, I've seen even on Fox News, people are saying, unambiguously, they're saying, people are responsible for their own actions.
[03:22:37.131 --> 03:22:37.431]  Period.
[03:22:38.516 --> 03:22:41.618]  Yes, they're legally responsible for their own actions.
[03:22:41.618 --> 03:22:44.280]  But they don't control them.
[03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:50.084]  What controls them is whatever inputs are coming in, and then whatever is the brain architecture they have.
[03:22:50.084 --> 03:23:05.815]  But that is separate from the question, and needs to be separate from the question here, of whether a trained persuader, or a group of them, or a bunch of professionals trying to influence politics, if they could absolutely, every time, cause somebody to get violent,
[03:23:06.591 --> 03:23:09.833]  If they worked at it long enough and on a large enough group of people.
[03:23:09.833 --> 03:23:16.796]  And the answer is, absolutely.
[03:23:16.796 --> 03:23:17.657]  And we're back.
[03:23:17.657 --> 03:23:19.918]  Mike Cernich guest hosting for another half an hour.
[03:23:19.918 --> 03:23:21.899]  Alex Jones has stepped out.
[03:23:21.899 --> 03:23:27.561]  So we do have video footage of the protesters storming the stage at Shakespeare in the Park.
[03:23:27.561 --> 03:23:30.403]  The liberals are getting mad and they're saying this is going to backfire.
[03:23:30.403 --> 03:23:32.324]  You guys are worse than I am on your phones though.
[03:23:33.018 --> 03:23:33.558]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:23:33.558 --> 03:23:36.260]  This is a transmission that's phone free, but I didn't buy it.
[03:23:36.260 --> 03:23:38.421]  Breaking news.
[03:23:38.421 --> 03:23:41.883]  Breaking news, we want to keep you updated in real time, and this is where it's happening.
[03:23:41.883 --> 03:23:44.925]  So, hold on, we got the champagne, so we might as well.
[03:23:44.925 --> 03:23:45.585]  Gotta refill up, yeah.
[03:23:45.585 --> 03:23:46.806]  Yeah, we might as well drink it while we're here.
[03:23:46.806 --> 03:23:50.528]  We're toasting to the end of globalist media, or at least the short term.
[03:23:50.528 --> 03:23:52.329]  I mean, and life is never over.
[03:23:52.329 --> 03:23:53.270]  The game is never over.
[03:23:53.270 --> 03:23:54.670]  You've never won.
[03:23:54.670 --> 03:23:56.051]  It never stops.
[03:23:56.051 --> 03:23:56.792]  Life is struggle.
[03:23:57.512 --> 03:23:59.194]  And then it ends, if you're lucky.
[03:23:59.194 --> 03:24:01.678]  So cheers to all of you listening at home.
[03:24:01.678 --> 03:24:06.585]  We do have the video footage now of the protesters storming the stage.
[03:24:06.585 --> 03:24:12.633]  So I just tweeted that out, so if the people producing it, the great people producing it, on a Sunday.
[03:24:13.514 --> 03:24:18.741]  Again, people don't appreciate that we go all day, and we go all day, and we go all day hard.
[03:24:18.741 --> 03:24:22.605]  They're actually here right now, Father's Day, Sunday, working.
[03:24:22.605 --> 03:24:23.446]  It's just another day.
[03:24:23.446 --> 03:24:24.267]  I work every day of the week.
[03:24:24.267 --> 03:24:24.908]  How about you?
[03:24:24.908 --> 03:24:25.709]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:24:25.709 --> 03:24:28.092]  You know, 12 to 18 hours every single day.
[03:24:28.092 --> 03:24:30.174]  You know, we have users from all over the world.
[03:24:30.174 --> 03:24:30.915]  News is happening.
[03:24:31.836 --> 03:24:32.337]  Every day.
[03:24:32.337 --> 03:24:33.798]  Every minute of every day.
[03:24:33.798 --> 03:24:35.820]  You know, you gotta put in the work.
[03:24:35.820 --> 03:24:37.002]  You gotta have the stamina.
[03:24:37.002 --> 03:24:39.644]  And, you know, you guys have been going since 9 or 10 this morning.
[03:24:39.644 --> 03:24:40.505]  Was your first Periscope?
[03:24:40.505 --> 03:24:41.907]  Yeah, we started Periscope at 9 or 10.
[03:24:41.907 --> 03:24:48.373]  Yeah, so if you scroll down a little bit, the first tweet under the pen tweet, that's the video the protest is filming this day.
[03:24:48.373 --> 03:24:52.478]  So yeah, let's check that out and get that, because I actually haven't seen this video myself.
[03:24:52.478 --> 03:24:53.318]  I just tweeted the link out.
[03:24:53.318 --> 03:24:53.699]  Let's take a look.
[03:24:55.484 --> 03:24:57.045]  Go Bulls, we'll be proud!
[03:24:57.045 --> 03:25:00.027]  Go Bulls, we'll be proud!
[03:25:00.027 --> 03:25:06.292]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll pause here briefly.
[03:25:06.292 --> 03:25:07.793]  Wow.
[03:25:07.793 --> 03:25:17.260]  Oh wow, they really took him down.
[03:25:17.260 --> 03:25:19.862]  Looks like they prepared this time.
[03:25:19.862 --> 03:25:20.483]  Wow.
[03:25:20.483 --> 03:25:21.984]  Thank you.
[03:25:28.446 --> 03:25:33.009]  And there are actually four people there, so that was just one of them.
[03:25:33.009 --> 03:25:38.053]  I know that I was tipped out earlier by the source that four people actually do have tickets.
[03:25:38.053 --> 03:25:49.601]  So I'm reading a reaction from Matt Pierce of the LA Times who says, the right protesting Shakespeare is a mistake because they spent the past three years showing high-profile protesting lead to backlash.
[03:25:50.522 --> 03:25:52.203]  And that this is a bad mistake.
[03:25:52.203 --> 03:25:54.504]  Okay, so here's where they're wrong.
[03:25:54.504 --> 03:25:56.805]  I kind of want to address that because it's caused a lot of controversy.
[03:25:56.805 --> 03:25:59.686]  People say, Mike Stoner, how can you support free speech?
[03:25:59.686 --> 03:26:02.007]  And yet, you think that this is fun.
[03:26:02.007 --> 03:26:05.469]  Okay, if our people do this all the time, I'm going to have a problem with it.
[03:26:05.729 --> 03:26:11.534]  If every time there's a play, every time something happens, people storm the stage, I'm going to say, alright, enough is enough.
[03:26:11.534 --> 03:26:21.543]  One or two times, no, one or two times you're sending a message, you're saying, okay, those of you who tried to ignore that, those of you who tried to pretend like this wasn't happening, now you're going to have to deal with protests.
[03:26:21.543 --> 03:26:28.189]  So if my side, whatever that is, starts acting like this every day, then I'm going to have a problem with it.
[03:26:28.969 --> 03:26:36.153]  The issue here is that our people have graduated to maybe they take the stage peacefully for 30 seconds.
[03:26:36.153 --> 03:26:39.755]  Whereas on the left, they're hitting people in the head with bi-clocks and killing people.
[03:26:39.755 --> 03:26:39.995]  Right.
[03:26:39.995 --> 03:26:45.838]  I mean, it's one or two people, a handful of people for 30 to 60 seconds, you know, doing a very peaceful protest.
[03:26:45.838 --> 03:26:47.039]  They're not being violent.
[03:26:47.039 --> 03:26:55.383]  You know, we have, you know, Trump supporters, you know, throughout the entire campaign being hit with bricks, being, you know, egged in the face, being attacked, punched, having their things stolen.
[03:26:55.843 --> 03:27:02.447]  I was at the San Jose rally in June of 2016 and saw the violence first hand on the streets.
[03:27:02.447 --> 03:27:03.967]  That's not what's happening here.
[03:27:03.967 --> 03:27:05.088]  It's a peaceful protest.
[03:27:05.088 --> 03:27:09.030]  That is a form of expression and free speech itself, and that is allowed.
[03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:11.011]  That's covered by the First Amendment.
[03:27:11.011 --> 03:27:12.692]  Yeah, and again, I want to get my position clear here.
[03:27:15.803 --> 03:27:21.968]  If people were storming the stages every day, and it became like a common thing, then I would say, alright, come on, man.
[03:27:21.968 --> 03:27:22.508]  You're getting old.
[03:27:22.508 --> 03:27:23.268]  Come on, come on.
[03:27:23.268 --> 03:27:24.429]  It's a plague, let's do it.
[03:27:24.429 --> 03:27:33.696]  But one time, maybe two times, to send a message, because here's what I love, everybody on the left now is saying, wow, this is bullshit, this is terrible, I can't believe you're doing this.
[03:27:33.696 --> 03:27:34.757]  Because it's happened to them.
[03:27:34.757 --> 03:27:35.677]  I'm like, thanks, bro.
[03:27:35.677 --> 03:27:37.118]  Thanks, where the fuck have you been?
[03:27:37.118 --> 03:27:39.180]  Yeah, where have you been for all this time?
[03:27:39.740 --> 03:27:41.141]  Oh, oh, you're so triggered now.
[03:27:41.141 --> 03:27:42.803]  You know, welcome to our world.
[03:27:42.803 --> 03:27:43.843]  Have a little bit of empathy.
[03:27:43.843 --> 03:27:45.825]  Well, that's the part, is that it started a dialogue.
[03:27:45.825 --> 03:27:54.812]  It started a national conversation about these things that are happening, and, you know, we can center the focus on, well, okay, we're doing it peacefully, and we're protesting peacefully.
[03:27:54.812 --> 03:27:58.635]  You know, what about the violence that is coming from the other side at our events?
[03:27:58.635 --> 03:28:04.560]  You know, Milo Yiannopoulos can't even speak at university without things being lit on fire and destroyed and... Yeah, they riot.
[03:28:04.560 --> 03:28:07.202]  That's the whole thing, is the left riots, which
[03:28:08.083 --> 03:28:09.931]  It cracks me up about the whole conversation.
[03:28:09.931 --> 03:28:12.120]  People are using this false equivalency they're saying.
[03:28:12.120 --> 03:28:12.662]  It's kind of like...
[03:28:13.464 --> 03:28:15.965]  Well, everybody has assholes.
[03:28:15.965 --> 03:28:16.746]  No.
[03:28:16.746 --> 03:28:23.609]  We have a couple people one time take a stage for 30 seconds and express disapproval for violence.
[03:28:23.609 --> 03:28:24.769]  That's our side.
[03:28:24.769 --> 03:28:26.750]  That's the worst of our side.
[03:28:26.750 --> 03:28:34.914]  Their side has the rapists, the pedophiles, the bike lock professor, people macing people, the riots.
[03:28:34.914 --> 03:28:36.355]  They have Antifa.
[03:28:36.355 --> 03:28:37.696]  They have the violence.
[03:28:37.696 --> 03:28:38.896]  They have the violence in the street.
[03:28:38.896 --> 03:28:41.117]  Daily Caller actually did an article cataloging 200 attacks
[03:28:42.563 --> 03:28:42.923]  I don't know.
[03:28:55.947 --> 03:28:59.171]  Yeah, the list of attacks against conservatives is mind-blowing.
[03:28:59.171 --> 03:29:04.337]  A wave of liberal rage has marked the past 11 months since the rise in election of Donald Trump.
[03:29:04.337 --> 03:29:05.739]  So, it's just a way of life.
[03:29:05.739 --> 03:29:09.043]  There was a truck, actually, three days ago that was shot at.
[03:29:09.043 --> 03:29:12.808]  It had a MAGA flag, was shot at, drive-by shooting against it.
[03:29:13.769 --> 03:29:18.973]  This idea that there are assholes on both sides is completely dishonest.
[03:29:18.973 --> 03:29:23.156]  That said, at least we got the liberals calling them assholes.
[03:29:23.156 --> 03:29:31.362]  They went from, well, it's not happening, or maybe it's not happening much, or hate isn't a big deal, to them saying, oh, well, there are assholes on both sides.
[03:29:31.362 --> 03:29:31.902]  Well, good.
[03:29:31.902 --> 03:29:33.364]  Now you're admitting they're assholes at least.
[03:29:33.364 --> 03:29:34.024]  Right, exactly.
[03:29:34.024 --> 03:29:38.507]  I think, as a Trump supporter, you're in fear.
[03:29:38.507 --> 03:29:39.808]  You don't want to have that bumper sticker.
[03:29:39.808 --> 03:29:41.149]  You don't want to wear that MAGA hat.
[03:29:41.149 --> 03:29:41.950]  Tell them what happened.
[03:29:43.490 --> 03:29:54.259]  After I was walking away from the rally in Austin, when a guy had attempted to sucker punch me and punched him back, when I was doing a periscope and we were in front of that barbecue restaurant, what happened?
[03:29:54.259 --> 03:29:55.300]  Where's the coverage of that?
[03:29:55.300 --> 03:29:57.321]  Yeah, you were live streaming and there was a guy eyeing you up and he was...
[03:30:03.659 --> 03:30:06.863]  There was a guy eyeing you up and I said, hey Mike, you gotta watch this guy.
[03:30:06.863 --> 03:30:13.570]  This guy's coming behind you and he looked like he was about to come up and sucker punch you because he recognized you, he knew who you were, and he listened to what you were saying.
[03:30:13.570 --> 03:30:14.851]  So I just gave you a heads up.
[03:30:14.851 --> 03:30:17.033]  I said, hey Mike, turn around and watch this guy behind you.
[03:30:17.033 --> 03:30:18.094]  It looks like he's going to sucker punch you.
[03:30:18.675 --> 03:30:23.059]  Yeah, exactly, and it was either you or someone else who heard people say, hey, that's Cernovich.
[03:30:23.059 --> 03:30:24.180]  Right, right, exactly.
[03:30:24.180 --> 03:30:29.004]  So that's the whole thing, is I go out in public and I'm going to do a live stream and exercise my free speech rights.
[03:30:29.004 --> 03:30:34.929]  I might get punched in the face, but oh no, oh no, somebody went on the stage at Shakespeare, oh my God, people out of control.
[03:30:34.929 --> 03:30:37.011]  What happened to dialogue in this country?
[03:30:37.011 --> 03:30:38.372]  What happened to civil dialogue?
[03:30:40.603 --> 03:30:42.326]  Yeah, so it's unbelievable.
[03:30:42.326 --> 03:30:43.147]  Come back in, Alex.
[03:30:43.147 --> 03:30:44.229]  Come join the fun, buddy.
[03:30:44.229 --> 03:30:46.232]  I'm watching, you guys are the best!
[03:30:46.232 --> 03:30:47.034]  So's the crew!
[03:30:47.034 --> 03:30:48.817]  And so's the viewers!
[03:30:48.817 --> 03:30:49.598]  Yeah!
[03:30:50.805 --> 03:30:51.825]  So, high energy.
[03:30:51.825 --> 03:30:54.106]  None of this is edited.
[03:30:54.106 --> 03:30:55.047]  No, exactly.
[03:30:55.047 --> 03:30:55.647]  We don't edit.
[03:30:55.647 --> 03:30:57.688]  We don't need to edit.
[03:30:57.688 --> 03:30:59.369]  And we can do this for 12 hours a day.
[03:30:59.369 --> 03:31:02.210]  By the way, how can people find out more about you who are just tuning in?
[03:31:02.210 --> 03:31:05.311]  Yeah, go to Gab, www.gab.ai.
[03:31:05.311 --> 03:31:13.815]  So, Gab is a new social network we started in August of 2016 and we support free speech, free expression, and the free flow of information online.
[03:31:13.815 --> 03:31:15.275]  That's pretty anti-American to me!
[03:31:16.976 --> 03:31:22.998]  Yeah, exactly as Salon would say and Vice and yeah, they're calling you like an alt-right thing, right?
[03:31:22.998 --> 03:31:25.978]  Twitter for racists and is it your co-founder of like Muslim or something?
[03:31:25.978 --> 03:31:27.719]  Yes, my co-founder is in Turkey.
[03:31:27.719 --> 03:31:28.499]  He's a Muslim.
[03:31:28.499 --> 03:31:29.779]  He's a Kurd.
[03:31:29.779 --> 03:31:34.220]  You know, our CCO is Indian and a practicing Hindu.
[03:31:34.220 --> 03:31:37.601]  It's it's it's incredible, you know, it's it's it's something else but
[03:31:38.021 --> 03:31:39.781]  Anyway, if you want to learn more, go to gab.ai.
[03:31:39.781 --> 03:31:40.422]  The site's open.
[03:31:40.422 --> 03:31:42.322]  You can sign up and grab your username now.
[03:31:42.322 --> 03:31:44.302]  And we have 300 characters.
[03:31:44.302 --> 03:31:46.123]  You can edit content.
[03:31:46.123 --> 03:31:47.683]  We have live streaming.
[03:31:47.683 --> 03:31:49.784]  So we're up and coming and we're completely supported.
[03:31:49.784 --> 03:31:52.384]  Just like InfoWars, we're completely supported by our community.
[03:31:52.384 --> 03:31:55.565]  We didn't take, you know, tens of millions of dollars in venture capital.
[03:31:55.565 --> 03:31:56.825]  We don't have any advertising.
[03:31:56.825 --> 03:31:59.526]  We're not, you know, mass data collecting.
[03:31:59.526 --> 03:32:03.327]  We're supported by the people through donations and through pro subscriptions.
[03:32:03.327 --> 03:32:04.247]  And pro is just a
[03:32:05.167 --> 03:32:10.930]  A subscription to a premium version of the product to help keep the site ad-free and to help keep us going.
[03:32:10.930 --> 03:32:11.290]  Gotcha.
[03:32:11.290 --> 03:32:18.134]  For those of you wondering more about the protest tonight, the man who protested the play is named Javi Val of the Proud Boys.
[03:32:18.134 --> 03:32:22.616]  So apparently it was... So Gavin has this fraternal organization called the Proud Boys.
[03:32:22.616 --> 03:32:28.199]  So apparently the protester tonight in New York was a part of the Proud Boys and we all saw the video.
[03:32:28.199 --> 03:32:28.919]  He didn't get violent.
[03:32:28.919 --> 03:32:30.240]  He didn't punch anybody.
[03:32:30.240 --> 03:32:33.382]  He went up and, you know, exercised his free speech rights, which
[03:32:34.262 --> 03:32:43.627]  You know, again, we've had all these events happening, and events that have been disrupted by the left for years, and we've had violence from the left, and nobody cares, and suddenly, my God, they care.
[03:32:43.627 --> 03:32:49.790]  And by the way, for those of you who are learning about me for the first time, you can go to Twitter.com forward slash... Look at the censorship of Twitter.
[03:32:49.790 --> 03:32:50.330]  Scroll down.
[03:32:50.330 --> 03:32:50.650]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:32:50.650 --> 03:32:52.471]  You see it may contain sensitive material.
[03:32:52.471 --> 03:32:53.151]  Yeah, okay, yeah.
[03:32:53.151 --> 03:32:54.752]  You see that they're hiding the actual photo.
[03:32:54.752 --> 03:32:56.073]  Wow, no, no, I hadn't seen that.
[03:32:56.073 --> 03:32:58.254]  Yeah, if you can scroll down on your profile.
[03:32:58.254 --> 03:33:00.835]  I'm at Twitter.com forward slash Cernovich.
[03:33:01.115 --> 03:33:01.515]  Amazing.
[03:33:01.515 --> 03:33:02.897]  Yeah, look, you have to click to view it.
[03:33:02.897 --> 03:33:03.958]  I see a protester, right?
[03:33:03.958 --> 03:33:05.239]  So that's Laura Loomer's Twitter.
[03:33:05.239 --> 03:33:06.140]  Yeah, that's sensitive.
[03:33:06.140 --> 03:33:08.262]  Yeah, so allegedly that's a sensitive image.
[03:33:08.262 --> 03:33:08.642]  Amazing.
[03:33:08.642 --> 03:33:09.062]  You're right.
[03:33:09.062 --> 03:33:15.288]  So this is, again, in real time, there's nothing sensitive about that image other than, you know, it's maybe counter-narrative.
[03:33:15.288 --> 03:33:19.112]  See, I'm at twitter.com forward slash Cernovich.
[03:33:19.112 --> 03:33:20.853]  You can always find me there going on.
[03:33:20.853 --> 03:33:21.454]  We're going to keep going.
[03:33:21.454 --> 03:33:22.895]  We've got another 15 minutes going on.
[03:33:22.895 --> 03:33:23.596]  So what's on your mind?
[03:33:24.571 --> 03:33:32.458]  Um, so, I think that, you know, the interview tonight, what they're going for, you know, they end the interview with, you know, this hate-mongering narrative.
[03:33:32.458 --> 03:33:38.043]  And we see even, during the commercials, we see an advertisement for stopping online hate.
[03:33:38.043 --> 03:33:39.704]  And that's where the next move is going to be.
[03:33:39.704 --> 03:33:41.305]  They're going to keep pushing this fake news.
[03:33:41.305 --> 03:33:45.929]  First they tried fake news, and it seems that that has kind of trailed off, but I guarantee they'll come back to that.
[03:33:45.929 --> 03:33:47.831]  Now it's all around hate speech.
[03:33:47.831 --> 03:33:50.213]  And the thing with hate speech is, how do you define that?
[03:33:50.373 --> 03:33:52.255]  Who defines what hate speech is?
[03:33:52.255 --> 03:33:56.299]  If you say something mean to me, is that technically hate speech because I was offended by it?
[03:33:56.299 --> 03:33:59.643]  Well, that's how the majority of people on the internet are defining it.
[03:33:59.643 --> 03:34:08.593]  And what's happening is, you know, you have Twitter now using things like Watson AI to automatically flag and remove and suspend users for saying certain words, certain phrases.
[03:34:09.313 --> 03:34:16.378]  It's not even, you know, it's not even somebody reporting it to Twitter and having a human on Twitter's and review that and say, okay, this crossed the line.
[03:34:16.378 --> 03:34:22.261]  It's actually using artificial intelligence now to make a decision on who should be silenced and who should not.
[03:34:22.261 --> 03:34:23.502]  And that, that's what's scary.
[03:34:23.502 --> 03:34:27.044]  That's something that's scary to me is, you know, we're no platforming people.
[03:34:27.044 --> 03:34:34.649]  We're silencing people just because they have a different opinion or because they think differently or because they're critical of certain things or because they made a joke.
[03:34:35.169 --> 03:34:39.472]  That is a world that I don't want to live in and that's not the internet that you and I grew up on.
[03:34:39.472 --> 03:34:43.715]  We grew up on an internet that was free and open and basically was the wild west.
[03:34:43.715 --> 03:34:44.515]  Anything goes.
[03:34:44.515 --> 03:34:51.900]  And now that they're starting to lose control and they're not going to allow something like 2016 to happen ever again.
[03:34:51.900 --> 03:34:52.880]  It's not going to happen.
[03:34:52.880 --> 03:34:55.442]  So you're going to see Silicon Valley start to double down.
[03:34:55.782 --> 03:35:00.645]  And you're going to see the fragmentation of the social networking ecosystem and alternatives like Gab and others.
[03:35:00.645 --> 03:35:04.728]  You know, there's Minds, there's Infogalactic, there's Keck.gg.
[03:35:04.728 --> 03:35:15.476]  There's so many different alternatives that are rising up in the technology space to answer for the censorship and the suppression that's going on, you know, focused specifically on people, folks on the right and Trump supporters.
[03:35:15.876 --> 03:35:17.577]  And this is happening around the world, by the way.
[03:35:17.577 --> 03:35:21.318]  We had Amy Meck's account up before on Twitter, one of her tweets.
[03:35:21.318 --> 03:35:26.701]  She is actually completely, her entire account is censored completely in Germany and France.
[03:35:26.701 --> 03:35:30.723]  If you were in Germany and France, you cannot actually view any of her Twitter content.
[03:35:30.723 --> 03:35:37.746]  So we actually recently had a massive surge in folks from Germany coming into Gab because of this censorship that's starting to happen over there.
[03:35:38.573 --> 03:35:54.370]  Yeah, again it's worldwide, it's happening in... Well, this is what I find interesting about the media and media narratives, is they keep saying that we need to be afraid of Russia and Putin's this bad guy, but in Turkey, journalists are actually being jailed, the internet is completely censored, and Twitter...
[03:35:55.111 --> 03:35:58.332]  You can confirm this for me, you know, so they know that I'm telling the truth.
[03:35:58.332 --> 03:36:03.975]  Twitter actually handed over data to the Turkish government, which allowed them to imprison journalists and activists.
[03:36:03.975 --> 03:36:04.355]  Right, yeah.
[03:36:04.355 --> 03:36:05.656]  Twitter actually is very open about this.
[03:36:05.656 --> 03:36:06.336]  They're transparent.
[03:36:06.336 --> 03:36:12.618]  They publish a report on this every year, annually, about, you know, the government requests, the data requests that they receive.
[03:36:12.618 --> 03:36:13.879]  And that's actually a great thing.
[03:36:14.059 --> 03:36:40.053]  That's a good thing that they're doing this but you know we're seeing you know governments from around the world start to crack down and they're trying to force the social media companies you know you look at Germany where they have what is it a 50 million dollar or 50 million euro fine if you don't remove hate speech within 24 hours like you know how many there's billions of posts every single day and if Facebook just hired 3,000 more people and that's not even enough people that they don't have enough manpower to possibly and conceivably
[03:36:40.493 --> 03:36:44.135]  Monitor what is quote-unquote hate speech and remove it within 24 hours.
[03:36:44.135 --> 03:36:44.996]  There's just no way.
[03:36:44.996 --> 03:36:53.601]  But what I find more interesting though is that Twitter is allowing dictators to imprison activists and journalists, okay?
[03:36:53.601 --> 03:36:56.803]  This is what, we live in this era of false equivalency, you know?
[03:36:56.803 --> 03:37:02.206]  I'll own that I have at times said things that were mean to people and I've done fat shaming, that's not cool.
[03:37:02.686 --> 03:37:06.247]  Yeah, I've said things that I'm like, you know, that isn't me at my best.
[03:37:06.247 --> 03:37:07.728]  You know, I shouldn't have said that.
[03:37:07.728 --> 03:37:09.028]  That's not me at my best.
[03:37:09.028 --> 03:37:13.369]  End of the day though, that's me on Twitter calling somebody fat and gross.
[03:37:13.369 --> 03:37:19.971]  Twitter is handing over data to tyrannical governments and people are dying and being raped in prison.
[03:37:19.971 --> 03:37:21.212]  But somehow we're the bad guys.
[03:37:22.112 --> 03:37:25.534]  I mean, you're seeing Silicon Valley capitulate to governments.
[03:37:25.534 --> 03:37:29.916]  You're seeing, you know, organizations like ShareBlue from David Brock.
[03:37:29.916 --> 03:37:39.721]  How does David Brock and ShareBlue have that much influence over Mark Zuckerberg, over Google, you know, some of the biggest corporations, the most wealthy corporations in the world?
[03:37:39.721 --> 03:37:46.205]  How does one outside influencer from the Democratic Party have that much influence over these multi-billion dollar corporations?
[03:37:46.205 --> 03:37:46.885]  That's what I want to know.
[03:37:47.304 --> 03:37:50.126]  Yeah, and then meanwhile, well, I mean, of course I'll tell you how.
[03:37:50.126 --> 03:37:52.268]  I mean, we all know that venture capital is controlled.
[03:37:52.268 --> 03:37:52.628]  Right.
[03:37:52.628 --> 03:37:56.671]  We all know that if you're like me, they'll just keep you out of deals.
[03:37:56.671 --> 03:38:04.618]  I've actually had venture capital deals fall through where I was going to be an angel investor in companies, and then SJWs within tech were like, no, no, no, you can't take that kind of money.
[03:38:04.618 --> 03:38:06.959]  You can't, because if your name's on the cap table, you're done.
[03:38:06.959 --> 03:38:08.000]  They monopolize it.
[03:38:08.000 --> 03:38:09.561]  So that's the thing.
[03:38:09.561 --> 03:38:12.664]  The free market or whatever is, there's actually an oligopoly
[03:38:13.004 --> 03:38:13.424]  Right.
[03:38:13.424 --> 03:38:16.447]  In Silicon Valley and Ted Cruz even tweeted out earlier today.
[03:38:16.447 --> 03:38:18.129]  I sent the tweet out earlier.
[03:38:18.129 --> 03:38:22.853]  He noticed that Twitter has become a monopoly and Twitter was like a utility.
[03:38:22.853 --> 03:38:26.537]  So if these people, I'm not going to say who I've talked to, but I have talked to U.S.
[03:38:26.537 --> 03:38:27.678]  senators about it.
[03:38:27.678 --> 03:38:28.799]  Maybe Cruz, maybe not.
[03:38:28.799 --> 03:38:30.260]  People are just going to have to guess.
[03:38:30.260 --> 03:38:31.502]  But I have talked to U.S.
[03:38:31.502 --> 03:38:33.684]  senators about these issues, the antitrust issue.
[03:38:33.684 --> 03:38:37.127]  And I explained the oligopolies that are occurring in venture capital.
[03:38:37.287 --> 03:38:37.487]  Right.
[03:38:37.487 --> 03:38:41.149]  So these people think they're going to get away with it, but they have no idea what I'm cooking behind the scenes.
[03:38:41.149 --> 03:38:42.830]  Well, listen, I was in Silicon Valley.
[03:38:42.830 --> 03:38:43.651]  You know, I lived there.
[03:38:43.651 --> 03:38:47.393]  I was a part of the inner circle of the inner circle at Y Combinator.
[03:38:47.393 --> 03:38:49.054]  And I saw it from the inside out.
[03:38:49.054 --> 03:38:50.875]  It is exactly what you're describing.
[03:38:50.875 --> 03:38:58.760]  It is the same group of about a thousand people that all invest in each other's companies, buy each other's companies, and then pat each other on the back like they did something phenomenal.
[03:38:58.760 --> 03:39:02.202]  And if you're not in that core inner circle, you're not going to go anywhere.
[03:39:02.202 --> 03:39:02.502]  Period.
[03:39:03.362 --> 03:39:04.122]  I'm glad you said that.
[03:39:04.122 --> 03:39:05.343]  Actually this is a great point.
[03:39:05.343 --> 03:39:11.625]  So there's a media myth that these venture capitalists or these geniuses of capital know they're oligopolists.
[03:39:11.625 --> 03:39:20.088]  So what happens is that they'll all put $25,000 into a thousand different companies and it's the same thousand people shuffling that $25,000 around.
[03:39:20.088 --> 03:39:29.971]  Then what they do is these companies have big IPOs like Snapchat, even though Snapchat's a total scam, and they tank so they get all this money from the general public and essentially scam the public.
[03:39:30.231 --> 03:39:35.356]  And then they go, oh my god, I'm Chris Saka, I'm such a genius investor.
[03:39:35.356 --> 03:39:37.858]  No, they're only investing $25,000 at a time.
[03:39:37.858 --> 03:39:41.281]  I could go right now and become a hundred millionaire in Silicon Valley.
[03:39:41.281 --> 03:39:46.686]  I could have been that, because I was offered investments, but because of the oligopolist forces, I was kept out.
[03:39:46.686 --> 03:39:49.349]  So, people think, oh my god, these people are geniuses.
[03:39:49.349 --> 03:39:51.651]  Paul Graham's not a genius.
[03:39:51.651 --> 03:39:53.352]  They're giving $25,000 in initial seed round.
[03:39:53.352 --> 03:39:54.413]  It wasn't even that, it was $15,000.
[03:39:56.295 --> 03:39:56.875]  Exactly.
[03:39:56.875 --> 03:40:01.238]  They got 8% equity in these companies for $15,000 in three months of their time.
[03:40:01.238 --> 03:40:02.799]  Yeah, and why is the media not covering that?
[03:40:02.799 --> 03:40:05.341]  Why is Megyn Kelly not, you know, covering that?
[03:40:05.341 --> 03:40:07.803]  That how these venture capitalists are actually an oligopoly.
[03:40:07.803 --> 03:40:09.043]  It isn't a free market.
[03:40:09.043 --> 03:40:13.146]  They're illegally just, and they also don't cover the tech companies and how they were sued.
[03:40:13.146 --> 03:40:17.209]  I mean, we can talk about tech because the fake news media won't cover this.
[03:40:17.209 --> 03:40:20.671]  The tech companies illegally violated antitrust law.
[03:40:20.851 --> 03:40:21.372]  We're good to go.
[03:40:42.594 --> 03:40:44.655]  Well, and that's why Obama gave him that sweetheart deal.
[03:40:44.655 --> 03:40:45.255]  Right.
[03:40:45.255 --> 03:40:51.779]  So there was actually a memo, so for those of you who haven't heard this story, and actually, most of you probably haven't, I should do a whole documentary on this.
[03:40:51.779 --> 03:40:53.620]  We could do an hour on this, yeah.
[03:40:53.620 --> 03:41:02.524]  They said, Apple, Steve Jobs, they had an email from Steve Jobs, and they said, you're not allowed to hire people who work for me, I won't hire people who work for you.
[03:41:02.524 --> 03:41:05.866]  This is a criminal violation of the federal antitrust laws.
[03:41:05.866 --> 03:41:06.746]  Criminal.
[03:41:06.746 --> 03:41:12.009]  There was a civil action brought, that was it, they all settled it for peanuts, even though they depressed wages.
[03:41:12.629 --> 03:41:15.411]  And then meanwhile they're saying, we can't hire enough people!
[03:41:15.411 --> 03:41:16.991]  We can't hire enough people!
[03:41:16.991 --> 03:41:18.652]  Well wait a minute, you're suppressing wages.
[03:41:18.652 --> 03:41:20.553]  So how can you suppress wages?
[03:41:20.553 --> 03:41:27.657]  We need more HB1 visas, we can't hire enough people, we can't get... Well wait a minute, you're illegally and criminally suppressing wages.
[03:41:27.657 --> 03:41:28.617]  Why don't you raise the wages?
[03:41:28.617 --> 03:41:32.980]  Oh no, because we're antitrust violations, so we need more of this, we need more of that.
[03:41:32.980 --> 03:41:34.701]  These people are fucking criminals, man.
[03:41:34.701 --> 03:41:35.241]  They are.
[03:41:35.241 --> 03:41:37.742]  And again, it's one big circle jerk.
[03:41:37.742 --> 03:41:39.043]  It's the same thousand people
[03:41:39.603 --> 03:41:46.606]  Investing in their own companies, investing in their own small network, buying each other's companies, and then patting each other on the back and saying, look at how great we are.
[03:41:46.606 --> 03:41:47.426]  We're fantastic.
[03:41:47.426 --> 03:41:48.667]  We're so brilliant.
[03:41:48.667 --> 03:41:49.988]  We're so morally superior.
[03:41:49.988 --> 03:41:51.408]  We know the way.
[03:41:51.408 --> 03:41:55.790]  That's their biggest thing, is that they think that the general public is stupid.
[03:41:55.790 --> 03:42:04.534]  And that they, because they went to some Ivy League school, or because they created a tech company and sold it, you know, for $10,000... Yeah, what did Sam Alton do other than ride Paul Graham's coattails?
[03:42:05.314 --> 03:42:06.495]  That's about it.
[03:42:06.495 --> 03:42:07.556]  He went into Y Combinator.
[03:42:07.556 --> 03:42:09.077]  He's some, you know, prophet.
[03:42:09.077 --> 03:42:10.618]  Sam Altman, some kind of prophet.
[03:42:10.618 --> 03:42:13.280]  He sold his company in a fire sale, by the way.
[03:42:13.280 --> 03:42:15.902]  Yeah, and then he wrote Paul Graham's coattails.
[03:42:15.902 --> 03:42:18.524]  Right, he got caved at Y Combinator on a silver platter.
[03:42:18.524 --> 03:42:21.126]  Exactly, by Paul Graham, and who knows why that was.
[03:42:21.126 --> 03:42:23.648]  And then suddenly people are like, oh wow, Sam Altman, he's brilliant.
[03:42:23.648 --> 03:42:24.929]  He didn't do anything.
[03:42:24.929 --> 03:42:26.830]  He wrote somebody else's coattails.
[03:42:26.830 --> 03:42:27.311]  Exactly.
[03:42:27.311 --> 03:42:28.992]  But that's what the fake news media will say.
[03:42:28.992 --> 03:42:30.533]  Meanwhile, people are actually scrapping him.
[03:42:30.533 --> 03:42:31.754]  They're propping him up like crazy.
[03:42:32.034 --> 03:42:38.122]  And meanwhile people are scrappy and actually created value and created something out of nothing, like Alex Jones or you or me.
[03:42:38.122 --> 03:42:40.725]  They're like, oh, they actually hold you out in shame.
[03:42:40.725 --> 03:42:49.455]  They're like, wow, it's Jones that's self-funded and he's so... Okay, the fake news media has commercials for poisonous pharmaceuticals and Tylenol and everything else.
[03:42:50.336 --> 03:42:53.058]  But somehow, we can't sell this kind of stuff.
[03:43:20.576 --> 03:43:21.877]  So, they can't attack the people.
[03:43:21.877 --> 03:43:29.001]  They can only attack us and, you know, call us racists and the Twitter for racists as they've called us and, you know, all the numerous things that they've said to you as well.
[03:43:29.001 --> 03:43:29.361]  Amazing.
[03:43:29.361 --> 03:43:30.061]  Thanks for joining us.
[03:43:30.061 --> 03:43:36.104]  This is Andrew Torba, co-founder of Gab.ai, which is a free speech alternative to Twitter.
[03:43:36.104 --> 03:43:41.587]  Right now, you're watching me, Mike Cernovich, twitter.com forward slash C-E-R-N-O-V-I-C-H.
[03:43:41.587 --> 03:43:43.708]  You can also find Gorilla Minds on Amazon.
[03:43:43.708 --> 03:43:48.511]  I might be back in studio tomorrow with Alex because we need to take a victory lap.
[03:43:48.931 --> 03:43:59.961]  We need to, you know, stay up all night, watch Twitter, celebrate how we defeated Megyn Kelly, how Alex defeated her, and even the media people are admitting that Megyn Kelly, she made a mistake.
[03:43:59.961 --> 03:44:01.363]  The globalist lost.
[03:44:01.363 --> 03:44:02.664]  Cheers to America.
[03:44:02.664 --> 03:44:04.185]  Thank you for funding The Info Wars.
[03:44:04.185 --> 03:44:04.746]  We love you all.
[03:44:07.014 --> 03:44:17.758]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[03:44:17.758 --> 03:44:29.742]  And others who are kind of at the very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones are being kind of incorporated into the campaign in ways it's a or even the recent choices of campaign management.
[03:44:29.742 --> 03:44:34.904]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle as we've been chronicling here.
[03:44:34.904 --> 03:44:35.384]  Jones is the
[03:44:36.264 --> 03:44:40.405]  Conspiracy theorist and creator of the fringe website Infowars.
[03:44:40.405 --> 03:44:44.485]  Do you also know that Hillary Clinton uses a wheelchair?
[03:44:44.485 --> 03:44:51.347]  Her personal vehicle has had to be outfitted with a wheelchair lift because she is not a person who can actually walk.
[03:44:51.347 --> 03:44:54.447]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times you think you've seen her walking.
[03:44:54.447 --> 03:44:55.587]  She hasn't been walking.
[03:44:55.587 --> 03:44:56.968]  Did you know that?
[03:44:56.968 --> 03:44:59.988]  Hillary Clinton has been on the campaign trail for 18 months.
[03:44:59.988 --> 03:45:03.269]  Her energy staggers me.
[03:45:03.269 --> 03:45:04.829]  I have a hard time keeping up with her.
[03:45:09.344 --> 03:45:14.148]  The historical first in electing the first conspiracy freak president.
[03:45:14.148 --> 03:45:15.849]  He's not pivoting for presidential.
[03:45:15.849 --> 03:45:17.490]  He's pivoting to Alex Jones.
[03:45:17.490 --> 03:45:19.312]  He's pivoting to crazy.
[03:45:19.312 --> 03:45:24.596]  Was Hillary wearing an earpiece during last night's presidential forum?
[03:45:24.596 --> 03:45:33.903]  That is the pilot, the captain of America's conspiracy theory mothership, Alex Jones.
[03:45:33.903 --> 03:45:36.085]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you Alex?
[03:45:37.481 --> 03:45:38.642]  The plan was so simple.
[03:45:38.642 --> 03:45:42.644]  All Hillary had to do was open a jar of pickles, and the White House would be all ours.
[03:45:42.644 --> 03:45:45.526]  You're gonna be part of the conspiracy now, you realize that, right?
[03:45:45.526 --> 03:45:46.646]  I'm gonna try to do my best.
[03:45:46.646 --> 03:45:48.427]  Alex Jones is gonna be all over you!
[03:45:48.427 --> 03:45:49.228]  Let's see what happens.
[03:45:49.228 --> 03:45:50.849]  Okay, here we go.
[03:45:50.849 --> 03:45:51.989]  Here it is.
[03:45:51.989 --> 03:45:53.410]  Whoop, blitzer.
[03:45:53.410 --> 03:45:55.772]  Oh no!
[03:45:55.772 --> 03:46:02.796]  Oh, there was a... They're all in on this, on this total conspiracy theory that literally came from Infowars.
[03:46:02.796 --> 03:46:04.677]  First of all, Hayes, I'll get you for this segment.
[03:46:05.598 --> 03:46:10.099]  It may take years and cost thousands of lives, but I'll get you for this.
[03:46:10.099 --> 03:46:21.182]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[03:46:21.182 --> 03:46:26.523]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[03:46:26.523 --> 03:46:32.004]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, the Alex Jones Show.
[03:46:32.004 --> 03:46:34.865]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:46:35.814 --> 03:46:51.354]  And it matters, because it's not just the Kook Fringe, it's not just the sort of remunerative conspiracy theory world of that part of the conservative media machine, it's not even just wacky people who have made their way into Republican politics at a surprising height.
[03:46:51.354 --> 03:46:53.116]  This is now the top of the Republican ticket.
