[00:00.000 --> 00:02.060]  you
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.060]  you
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.060]  you
[01:30.000 --> 01:51.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:51.520 --> 02:07.060]  how was it it was that
[02:07.060 --> 02:08.060]  Alex Jones.
[02:08.060 --> 02:09.060]  Alex Jones.
[02:09.060 --> 02:10.060]  His name is Alex Jones.
[02:10.060 --> 02:11.060]  Alex Jones.
[02:11.060 --> 02:12.060]  His name is Alex Jones.
[02:12.060 --> 02:13.060]  Nice guy.
[02:13.060 --> 02:14.060]  Alex Jones.
[02:14.060 --> 02:15.060]  Alex Jones.
[02:15.060 --> 02:16.060]  Alex Jones.
[02:16.060 --> 02:17.060]  Alex Jones.
[02:17.060 --> 02:18.060]  Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:18.060 --> 02:19.060]  That man's from breakfast country.
[02:19.060 --> 02:21.060]  There's a guy on the radio.
[02:21.060 --> 02:22.060]  His name is Alex Jones.
[02:22.060 --> 02:23.060]  Alex Jones.
[02:23.060 --> 02:25.060]  Alex Jones is the most in the world.
[02:25.060 --> 02:27.060]  That man doesn't think you watch your mouth.
[02:27.060 --> 02:29.060]  It's time to stop submitting to this charity.
[02:29.060 --> 02:31.060]  It's time to realize that we're being enslaved.
[02:31.060 --> 02:33.060]  I heard that on Alex Jones.
[02:33.060 --> 02:34.060]  Info wars.
[02:34.060 --> 02:36.060]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[02:36.060 --> 02:38.060]  We are in an information war.
[02:38.060 --> 02:40.060]  And we are losing that war.
[02:40.060 --> 02:43.060]  Nobody can dispute the fact that you're on Championship.
[02:43.060 --> 02:44.060]  Info wars.
[02:44.060 --> 02:45.060]  Info wars comes to mind.
[02:45.060 --> 02:46.060]  Info wars.
[02:46.060 --> 02:47.060]  Info wars.
[02:47.060 --> 02:48.060]  Info wars.
[02:48.060 --> 02:49.060]  You watch Info wars?
[02:49.060 --> 02:50.060]  Info wars.
[02:50.060 --> 02:51.060]  Info wars.
[02:51.060 --> 02:52.060]  Info wars.
[02:52.060 --> 02:53.060]  Info wars.
[02:53.060 --> 02:54.060]  Info wars.
[02:54.060 --> 02:55.060]  Info wars.
[02:55.060 --> 02:56.060]  Info wars.
[02:56.060 --> 02:57.060]  Info wars.
[02:57.060 --> 02:58.060]  Info wars.
[02:58.060 --> 02:59.060]  Info wars.
[02:59.060 --> 03:00.060]  Info wars.
[03:00.060 --> 03:01.060]  Info wars.
[03:01.060 --> 03:02.060]  Info wars.
[03:02.060 --> 03:03.060]  I want freedom.
[03:03.060 --> 03:04.060]  I want энергy.
[03:04.060 --> 03:05.060]  Info wars.
[03:05.060 --> 03:08.740]  And I'm telling you what you need to listen to Alex Jones
[03:12.540 --> 03:17.700]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[03:17.700 --> 03:19.700]  That
[03:33.300 --> 03:37.300]  Was the real Hank Hill saying he likes Alex Jones
[03:37.820 --> 03:42.540]  That's my judge the voice and creator of Hank Hill. Does he Hank Hill likes me an
[03:42.540 --> 03:47.260]  Engineer a patriot a father my judge, but the MSM doesn't
[03:49.100 --> 03:50.660]  See how that works
[03:50.660 --> 03:52.660]  He was somebody I'd like to show
[03:52.820 --> 03:56.420]  Not MSNBC not seeing in it. Isn't that funny?
[03:57.140 --> 04:01.900]  But getting serious here. This is part of four hours at least of live coverage of
[04:01.900 --> 04:10.340]  The Megan Kelly disinformation piece that is a definite deep-state production by every yardstick. I
[04:14.340 --> 04:16.340]  Have clips we're gonna play today
[04:17.780 --> 04:22.660]  From today of seeing another channel saying I'm a virus
[04:22.660 --> 04:31.340]  That I'm the worst person on earth that that I shouldn't even be allowed to be on air and
[04:33.260 --> 04:38.260]  There's all these shows making jokes about me talking about human animal chimeras
[04:39.980 --> 04:46.820]  So I just keep hammering on that just like estrogen mimicers causing massive cancer and sexual confusion in the water supply
[04:46.900 --> 04:49.220]  They make jokes about that, you know the gay frogs
[04:49.220 --> 04:56.860]  They are so scared ladies and gentlemen. They are so scared of just the fact that we're here pointing out what they're really doing
[04:57.620 --> 05:05.260]  For 30 years, they've had human animal chimeras now. It's all over scientific journals. They've legalized it in the United States
[05:07.740 --> 05:12.340]  But they all say he's insane and says that there's half human half animal
[05:12.700 --> 05:14.980]  Creations that don't have rights and should have rights
[05:14.980 --> 05:19.820]  I'm going to force that issue out because I'll expose the nanotech the genetic engineering all of it
[05:20.620 --> 05:24.740]  Then they also say everywhere. I don't believe in the moon landings. That's not true either
[05:25.740 --> 05:30.860]  We have a bigger space program than they even tell you and that's been admitted something like 80 something percent of it
[05:31.860 --> 05:33.660]  It's secret
[05:33.660 --> 05:38.380]  You know, I love how when they had that experimental X whatever it is spaceplane land a few months ago
[05:38.380 --> 05:45.180]  they had guys out there and space suits all around it in case microbes and space got on it and
[05:45.900 --> 05:52.500]  They're not worried about on this planet creating new species that can jump species which is already happening. That's the real threat
[05:52.500 --> 05:55.940]  It's already happened, but I'm digressing
[05:56.620 --> 06:02.940]  We're not gonzo journalism. We don't make the story about us the media has done that but they create a straw man and then they demonize it and
[06:02.940 --> 06:07.780]  Megan Kelly the quotes are out there
[06:08.260 --> 06:12.220]  Said I'm not doing a hit piece. I'm doing a nice piece. You can trust me
[06:12.220 --> 06:14.860]  You've got my word we're replacing those clips coming up
[06:14.860 --> 06:19.820]  So I played the pre interview just to show that when you see the hit piece of all hit pieces
[06:19.820 --> 06:25.100]  She's a liar and then I know in the promo piece. They edited things together. That didn't make sense
[06:25.100 --> 06:33.060]  So we we haven't recorded it will say when will you release it? Probably a couple days. I mean, I guess I got uploaded all raw
[06:33.060 --> 06:37.460]  But I wanted to just be able to show you clips of where they had me edited and then show you what I really said
[06:37.580 --> 06:39.580]  So it's illustrative
[06:39.860 --> 06:42.580]  But who knows I may just lazily release the whole thing tonight
[06:43.180 --> 06:44.580]  You know what?
[06:44.580 --> 06:49.700]  Let's start loading it in the computers. Let's we start the upload right now. I don't know
[06:49.700 --> 06:55.300]  What do you think we're gonna cover it live to her show starts in about two hours stay with us?
[06:58.380 --> 07:01.620]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry
[07:01.620 --> 07:09.140]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense
[07:09.740 --> 07:14.900]  60 years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs
[07:14.900 --> 07:22.420]  They had drums of their own air raid sirens, but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[07:23.100 --> 07:29.860]  Pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and
[07:30.260 --> 07:35.660]  Accelerate our journey towards death. I personally counter this onslaught with antroplex
[07:36.260 --> 07:39.260]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic
[07:39.260 --> 07:45.620]  Concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity
[07:45.980 --> 07:49.820]  Inside the human body discover why anthroplex has turned so many heads today
[07:49.820 --> 07:56.140]  It's time for us to take our bodies back in our own hands and it starts at info wars life calm with anthroplex
[08:03.020 --> 08:06.420]  And it's time for humanity to stand out in the info war
[08:06.420 --> 08:12.260]  And say I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you want to fight you better believe you've got one
[08:14.340 --> 08:19.500]  From the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones
[08:24.820 --> 08:26.820]  I don't know how this is gonna end
[08:26.820 --> 08:31.900]  You globless won't destroy our country attack our families make us poor bringing radicals your hottest
[08:31.900 --> 08:35.900]  You want to fight you better believe you've got one
[08:37.060 --> 08:39.780]  And I expect this fight. I expect it
[08:40.420 --> 08:47.460]  These people are lying scum that have lied about WMDs in multiple countries to go invade them get our troops killed
[08:47.860 --> 08:51.980]  overthrow secular governments and then put al-qaeda and ISIS type trash in
[08:52.980 --> 08:54.980]  they lied with
[08:54.980 --> 09:01.900]  Dead babies and incubators with their brains bashed out and Kuwait never happened. They had been ever happened with a PR firm and CNN
[09:02.700 --> 09:04.700]  1990
[09:05.740 --> 09:09.700]  The launch a war that killed millions of people and turn the Middle East over to al-qaeda
[09:10.660 --> 09:12.660]  It's bipartisan
[09:12.980 --> 09:18.700]  So they tell you you're not supposed to question mass shootings and other events when governments have been caught over and over again
[09:18.700 --> 09:26.340]  Like an operation Northwoods declassified in 2000 talked about the government wanting to stage mass shootings in America to take our freedoms
[09:27.820 --> 09:29.820]  Hmm ABC news
[09:30.820 --> 09:37.700]  So of course I've war game and questioned many multiple events, but I'm looking at it think that Newtown did happen
[09:38.100 --> 09:44.220]  But I'm not the creator of people questioning Newtown and Sandy Hook my guest covered it. I've covered it
[09:44.220 --> 09:49.660]  We've looked at it. Why do they have PR firms in Bloomberg and all the media now saying on father's day?
[09:49.660 --> 09:52.260]  He goes on TV. That's the promos now
[09:52.260 --> 09:54.420]  We knew it was coming on father's day
[09:54.420 --> 10:02.140]  Jones dear go on air and tell the families that their children didn't die coming up Jones picked father's day
[10:02.460 --> 10:04.660]  No, they told me it wouldn't be about Newtown
[10:04.660 --> 10:09.580]  But then I told him I thought Newtown happened on tape so they had it didn't have me say it didn't happen basically in their promo
[10:09.580 --> 10:16.260]  And then they go to the families and say oh see he's sending people to harass you and it's all the media hyping it all the media
[10:16.260 --> 10:23.100]  Pushing it all the media. I mean, I hardly ever even talk about Newtown. It's one of you know, unfortunately hundreds of mass shootings the last 50 years
[10:23.620 --> 10:25.620]  It's incredible
[10:26.420 --> 10:33.020]  But see on CNN and Fox and everywhere they have the talking point if we interview dictators and child molesters and murderers
[10:33.340 --> 10:35.860]  We can interview Jones. That's what the good guy'll say
[10:35.860 --> 10:39.420]  Then you know the pro first amendment. Well, Jones is the worst human on earth
[10:39.420 --> 10:44.540]  But he's got free speech and the other house. No, he's even worse because he's a virus. He's
[10:45.940 --> 10:47.940]  I'm effective
[10:48.300 --> 10:50.300]  I'm effective
[10:50.340 --> 10:57.820]  I'm effective because I tell the truth and I remind people and I go oh here's Gruber saying thank God. You're so dumb
[10:57.860 --> 10:59.860]  We're gonna triple prices and rip you off
[10:59.860 --> 11:04.780]  And then I show Gruber saying I never said that
[11:06.100 --> 11:11.340]  Or I show you clips of Comey on May 3rd and on June 8 saying no one tried to influence me
[11:11.340 --> 11:14.900]  Nobody obstructed justice and then I show the news saying it never happened. We're insane
[11:15.900 --> 11:19.200]  They use my name go fake news Alex Jones and
[11:19.780 --> 11:22.340]  Fake news Mike Sernovich and fake news
[11:23.580 --> 11:27.700]  Psobic they just made it up and I go really I made it up. Here's the clips
[11:27.700 --> 11:35.660]  They don't like the fact that millions of people oh by the way, they're really upset because the graph is steadily going up
[11:36.100 --> 11:42.100]  We had a big peak at the election 80 something million people in one week tuned in and it went down some but it's compared to before the election
[11:42.100 --> 11:46.780]  We're at a new plateau. We went up the top of a Mesa and you know, we had a peak and then kind of went down off
[11:46.780 --> 11:52.180]  But we're still going into the high country. We're going up up up like Icarus
[11:52.180 --> 11:58.180]  And by the way, I use that example because I know how things ended for Icarus. I'm not trying to fly high
[11:58.780 --> 12:07.340]  Towards the Sun on some personal mission of power. I'm doing this because these evil pedophile globalist new world order radical Islamist pushing
[12:07.820 --> 12:11.740]  Trash they gotta have somebody belly up to them and give them a fight
[12:13.420 --> 12:16.620]  And I tell I'm just so honored to be in this position so whatever they do just
[12:17.100 --> 12:20.700]  Like I always tell them do whatever you gotta do you serve your God
[12:20.700 --> 12:22.700]  I serve mine. That's the way the
[12:23.420 --> 12:26.620]  That's the way the cow ate the cabbage. Isn't it now? Here's what's coming up today
[12:27.380 --> 12:33.380]  We've got Mike Cernovich in studio. We've got the so big joins. We've got a bunch of other special guests joining us
[12:33.380 --> 12:40.700]  We've got Steve Pachinic popping in we've got Roger Stone everybody on the subject of the big Megan Kelly interview and quite frankly I
[12:41.300 --> 12:46.700]  Think I've only held my own against their deception and evil and corruption everybody saying I'm this big genius
[12:46.700 --> 12:51.160]  You know, I've destroyed them and then they're so discredited. She discredited herself
[12:51.900 --> 12:57.420]  Lying and saying it would be a puff piece when obviously they said they're re-editing it to make it even worse
[12:57.820 --> 13:01.100]  Hell they already blew my head up on the camera and you know did all this other stuff
[13:01.100 --> 13:05.180]  It's obvious and lit me from below and edited things
[13:06.300 --> 13:08.300]  but there's a
[13:08.620 --> 13:12.620]  Graphic out there where I'm supposedly you know playing Megan like a fiddle
[13:12.620 --> 13:21.140]  How to play MSM MSM plays itself if you just challenge it if you just speak up against it if you just say no to it
[13:21.420 --> 13:26.620]  But right now this is from some of the audio I recorded like three weeks ago before Megan Kelly came here
[13:28.500 --> 13:33.420]  Where she just butters me up and then tells me she's you know not gonna be mean and all this stuff and
[13:34.260 --> 13:36.820]  Then it was the most vicious interview. I've ever been through and
[13:36.820 --> 13:42.540]  And she just kept asking the same question until she thought she'd get another answer to somehow edit it together
[13:44.540 --> 13:47.980]  And I've got more of the phone conversations it's just there's so much of it
[13:48.220 --> 13:50.100]  But I don't even want to release all this stuff
[13:50.100 --> 13:56.180]  I've told NBC on your website just post the whole interview the final interview of three you did that there as four that you know
[13:56.180 --> 14:02.980]  The 110 minute one or so 105 minute just post that on ABC news or NBC news on your website
[14:02.980 --> 14:08.400]  So people can actually hear what I said instead of what you edited and I won't release all the other hours
[14:08.740 --> 14:11.860]  Most big news sites when they do a big interview to do that to begin with
[14:12.900 --> 14:14.900]  But so they want to misrepresent what I said
[14:15.580 --> 14:21.540]  They want to lie about what I've said on Father's Day to open up wounds and say on Father's Day
[14:21.900 --> 14:24.980]  Jones lost his children in a custody battle. Not true
[14:25.100 --> 14:28.940]  You know Jones did all these horrible things in his evil Jones
[14:28.940 --> 14:32.260]  You know says firefighters blew up the World Trade Center never said that
[14:32.260 --> 14:38.380]  But that's how they misrepresent if I say criminal elements of my government worked with the Saudis were ordered to stand down
[14:38.380 --> 14:41.420]  I've had members of Congress on that have seen the documents 28 pages
[14:41.860 --> 14:46.740]  Walter Jones you name it. They just misrepresent say Jones says firefighters blew the building
[14:47.020 --> 14:50.820]  Joan says gays deserve to die at the Pulse nightclub when I said the opposite
[14:50.820 --> 14:55.500]  Why are gays calling to bring in radical unvetted Muslims when they target them all over the world and kill them?
[14:55.500 --> 15:00.980]  It's the opposite, but she said you said gays deserve to die. I said no it is. Yes, you did
[15:00.980 --> 15:06.900]  You said the kids deserve to die at Manchester. No, I didn't it's just misrepresent misrepresent
[15:06.900 --> 15:08.900]  I know it's in the interview because I was there
[15:11.140 --> 15:14.980]  And I told her I said I'm not recording this will probably have me hold up my phone when I'm not recording it
[15:14.980 --> 15:16.980]  But I went but other people are
[15:17.220 --> 15:19.220]  What's all gonna be deception?
[15:19.220 --> 15:22.020]  And I warned her I warned her in the middle of it
[15:22.020 --> 15:28.060]  I said you better watch out don't it look like Katie Couric who edited video but people said got a lot of trouble
[15:28.060 --> 15:32.620]  Let's go out to break with a Megan Kelly some of the excerpts from our phone conversation
[15:33.660 --> 15:36.620]  All I can do is give you my word and tell you if there's one thing about me
[15:36.620 --> 15:41.260]  I do what I say I'm gonna do and I I don't double cross. It's not going to be some gotcha hit piece
[15:41.340 --> 15:45.420]  I promise you that they call you the most paranoid man in America. Is that true?
[15:45.980 --> 15:48.380]  So it's like an investigative report in the fake news
[15:50.140 --> 15:52.140]  No, no
[15:53.340 --> 15:55.340]  Yeah, come on
[15:55.340 --> 15:57.980]  No, I just you know like all the sandy hook things
[15:58.540 --> 16:03.900]  I've had debates where I've shown both sides when I go back and forth, but I believe people died there when you say
[16:04.540 --> 16:12.300]  Parents faked their children's death people get very angry. She didn't show in her promo video that I said I believe
[16:12.620 --> 16:18.460]  Sandy Hook happened, you know, you just became very fascinating to me. I just sort of thought you were the
[16:19.340 --> 16:23.500]  Maybe you know one dimensional guy like this is your thing. My goal is for
[16:23.500 --> 16:28.780]  For your listeners and the left, you know, who will be watching some on NBC to say
[16:29.500 --> 16:35.020]  Wow, that was really interesting. The media never covers all the evil wars. It's promoted all the big things
[16:35.020 --> 16:37.420]  That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown, you know
[16:37.420 --> 16:38.860]  But I here's the difference
[16:38.860 --> 16:43.820]  I promise you when it's over, you'll say absolutely. She did what she said she was gonna do and you'll be fine with that
[16:44.300 --> 16:47.100]  I don't I'm not looking to portray you as some bookie man or
[16:47.980 --> 16:52.380]  You know do any sort of a gotcha moment sandy hooks 9 11. That's a dodge
[16:52.380 --> 16:58.060]  I just want to talk about you. I want people to get to know you and the craziest thing of all would be if
[16:58.620 --> 17:02.460]  Some of the people who have this, you know insane version of you in their heads walk away saying
[17:03.180 --> 17:04.780]  You know what?
[17:04.780 --> 17:07.420]  I see like the dad in him. I see the guy who
[17:08.060 --> 17:11.020]  Loves those kids and who is more complex than I've been led to believe
[17:11.420 --> 17:15.340]  We didn't get any of the really important stuff. What do you mean? We talked about all the important stuff
[17:15.340 --> 17:17.740]  This is not gonna be a contentious, you know
[17:19.020 --> 17:20.700]  Sort of gotcha
[17:20.700 --> 17:22.940]  exchange if I didn't take the challenge
[17:23.740 --> 17:25.260]  then good
[17:25.260 --> 17:27.020]  Or at least an open heart
[17:27.020 --> 17:29.020]  Would be hiding from evil
[17:33.180 --> 17:36.940]  Mike Cernovich with his great team put that together from Cernovich media. That's why I'm teaming up with him
[17:36.940 --> 17:40.700]  He's just I'm I love him so much energy. We're right on the same wavelength. It's amazing
[17:42.060 --> 17:44.060]  Powerful Jedi

[22:14.620 --> 22:16.620]  Would bring you down forever
[22:16.940 --> 22:20.940]  But you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun
[22:20.940 --> 22:29.980]  Broadcasting live from the un stronghold austin texas. You're listening to the alex jones show
[22:30.620 --> 22:32.620]  And the colors of the sea
[22:33.020 --> 22:39.580]  Find your eyes with trembling mammoths and you touch the distant beaches with tales of regularities
[22:39.580 --> 22:51.100]  I was naked ears were tortured by the siren sweetly singing for the sparkling waves of calling youth to kiss the white lace names
[22:51.100 --> 22:54.940]  It's gonna be a jam-packed segment than I had former head of psychological operations
[22:56.060 --> 22:59.500]  The cia state department you name it under steep a chinning popping in
[23:00.220 --> 23:03.740]  He believes like a lot of law enforcement. I know that tandy hook was completely synthetic
[23:06.220 --> 23:08.220]  My intel is
[23:08.220 --> 23:13.260]  That I've seen the parents and it looks real to me and I and I can't prove something 100%
[23:13.260 --> 23:16.540]  I'm not gonna go there. We know governments of stage things. You have a right to question it
[23:16.700 --> 23:19.820]  They have misrepresented me in the media for years and I'm the creator of all this
[23:20.220 --> 23:23.420]  They say in the news every day that I'm bullying families and sending people to their houses
[23:23.660 --> 23:25.420]  But I've been saying for years don't do that
[23:25.740 --> 23:29.340]  So I have to come out and not let the media misrepresent where I'm at and where I stand
[23:29.500 --> 23:31.660]  But you have a total right to question sandy hook
[23:31.660 --> 23:37.420]  And I'm tempted to make a documentary about it just from my own hellish experience
[23:38.220 --> 23:40.220]  It's like the babies in the incubators
[23:40.300 --> 23:45.500]  I mean, they said a hundred of them got their brain brains bashed out everything none of it was true
[23:46.460 --> 23:49.660]  I remember hearing that when I was in high school. I'm thinking man. I hope we nuke
[23:50.380 --> 23:52.380]  the Iraqis or whatever
[23:52.860 --> 23:54.860]  And it was none of it was true
[23:54.860 --> 23:58.460]  So there's so many cases of that and then when Madeline Albright says yeah
[23:58.460 --> 24:02.460]  Half million kids died big deal. It was good when Clinton tripled the sanctions
[24:03.420 --> 24:06.540]  He thought bush was bad tripled the sanctions a bush 41
[24:07.340 --> 24:10.860]  Onto the children and she said a half million's a good price to pay me now. I can play the clip if you want
[24:10.860 --> 24:12.860]  It's well known with leslie stall
[24:13.580 --> 24:15.580]  And she made similar statements
[24:15.820 --> 24:19.580]  So the cold bloodedness of a half million kids. Oh, yeah, it's no big deal. But then
[24:19.580 --> 24:27.740]  We questioned governments like this that are this cold-blooded that just turned the whole Middle East over to the islamicist
[24:28.860 --> 24:30.380]  And
[24:30.380 --> 24:33.820]  It's like, oh my gosh, you hate families. You're everybody. I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa
[24:34.380 --> 24:36.620]  And then they go, oh, you jones is running from this
[24:37.500 --> 24:39.420]  No, I've been saying since it happened
[24:39.420 --> 24:42.940]  I don't know if the official story was true or not and now if you can't prove it one way or the other
[24:43.020 --> 24:44.300]  There's some anomalies
[24:44.300 --> 24:47.820]  But the parents look pretty legitimate to me and I feel sorry for him as a parent myself
[24:47.820 --> 24:52.300]  That I've got to sit here and say, okay. Well, then, you know mass shootings happen
[24:52.860 --> 24:56.540]  They've planed out. They're getting rarer since the 90s. Don't blame gun owners
[24:56.860 --> 24:59.900]  Don't project that on to other parents that have guns to protect themselves
[25:00.060 --> 25:04.620]  Just like if somebody runs over to somebody in a car if ISIS kills somebody in a truck. Do you blame?
[25:07.340 --> 25:09.340]  Ford do you blame?
[25:09.900 --> 25:11.500]  Mercedes
[25:11.500 --> 25:14.540]  So again, ladies and gentlemen the same liberal media that tells us
[25:14.540 --> 25:23.100]  If three Palestinian men stab a Israeli policewoman to death and then the police shoot those three men the bbc headline was
[25:23.740 --> 25:25.740]  Israelis kill three Palestinians
[25:27.980 --> 25:31.900]  And then a footnote later after they stabbed a woman to death and I'm not even against the
[25:32.620 --> 25:39.580]  Palestinians or anybody. I just don't like lying like that this media that says kill trump everywhere murder trump everywhere
[25:39.580 --> 25:45.580]  And and then they're hyping congressman being shot and conservatives being killed and then when it actually starts happening. They say
[25:46.220 --> 25:52.220]  Well, okay, it's just politics. That's what both Blitzer had a guess on about killing people's, you know, okay, but then oh my gosh
[25:52.220 --> 25:56.220]  I question an official story why I'm the worst man on earth
[25:58.220 --> 26:03.100]  By the way, jack Pesovic and others gonna be joining us that were there and were part of the uh
[26:04.780 --> 26:08.380]  Central park event where they have American flags a guy dressed up like
[26:08.380 --> 26:10.940]  Trump clearly at the president they admit it's the president
[26:11.580 --> 26:16.540]  In simulation then they murder him and then they have the nerve to go. Oh, it's a 500 year old play from
[26:17.820 --> 26:19.820]  The most famous playwright
[26:21.020 --> 26:23.020]  William Shakespeare
[26:23.660 --> 26:28.860]  You people don't even know what you're talking about clearly. It's trump. What about Madonna saying blow up the White House and all this
[26:28.860 --> 26:33.500]  It's all over the news saying kill trump and his supporters, but then they play this mind game where they go
[26:33.500 --> 26:37.100]  Oh, no, we're not talking about trump. You're crazy. You made it up
[26:37.100 --> 26:39.260]  I saw newspapers when I tweeted this
[26:39.900 --> 26:41.900]  Friday night
[26:41.900 --> 26:43.900]  When it happened
[26:43.900 --> 26:45.900]  In in central park
[26:46.860 --> 26:49.500]  Because I was in contact with the activists right up until the time that happened
[26:51.180 --> 26:56.060]  And they were like look at Joe's don't even know what a Shakespeare play is. It doesn't do a trump
[26:56.060 --> 27:03.580]  That's a Julius Caesar. Yeah, the simulated murder of a king or a leader dressed up like Trump with American flags in a congressional
[27:03.580 --> 27:09.180]  Setting like they're killing him in the u.s. Senate just like they did 2,000 plus years ago in Rome
[27:10.380 --> 27:15.980]  But again, the left plays these games and goes conspiracy theorist Jones claims. This is trump
[27:16.700 --> 27:20.780]  And they go, yeah, that's his wild imagination. See they control reality
[27:20.780 --> 27:27.420]  They're going to simulate killing trump in front of you. They're going to chant kill trump at the events. They're going to admit they're doing it
[27:28.780 --> 27:31.260]  But then they're going to tell you
[27:31.260 --> 27:33.260]  It didn't exist
[27:34.060 --> 27:36.060]  Those videos are coming up
[27:38.060 --> 27:41.580]  But first I want to play you brian stelter and I don't mean to make fun of his appearance
[27:41.580 --> 27:44.060]  But you we've all seen like a three-year-old or a five-year-old
[27:44.380 --> 27:49.260]  Try to act like they're tough or like they're a man when they bow up and you know act like they're in charge and
[27:49.500 --> 27:55.500]  Your three-year-old son, you know decides. He's the boss when he goes no daddy. I'm the boss and walks over and kicks you in the chin
[27:55.500 --> 27:57.500]  It's like this Humpty Dumpty Wimp
[27:57.500 --> 28:00.380]  Who always sits up there with this real authoritative
[28:01.020 --> 28:07.900]  Saying he's a big man like Tom Brokaw and all of them acting like they're big tough men. I am so sick of it
[28:08.460 --> 28:13.100]  Tom Brokaw says I'm a quote total racist and then shows no proof
[28:13.660 --> 28:19.260]  You're the fake news. You people are desperate and you think destroying me will help you
[28:19.500 --> 28:23.500]  We've never had ratings this high in the summer. This is the second highest ratings
[28:23.500 --> 28:29.900]  We've ever had since the election on election week. We've never had more financial support. We've never had more affiliates
[28:30.700 --> 28:32.700]  We've never had more I went down to meet
[28:34.380 --> 28:35.180]  Cernovich
[28:35.820 --> 28:40.300]  At the big hotel downtown for breakfast this morning and I couldn't pay for my own valet
[28:41.420 --> 28:43.420]  Parked it right up front high-fiving
[28:43.740 --> 28:50.380]  White men black men old women you name it Indians running over saying Trump. He's battling Islam. I was like, yeah
[28:50.380 --> 28:54.860]  I was just mobbed. Whoa. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Now. I should go down there and just show you video of it
[28:54.860 --> 29:00.860]  Boy, I'm sure having a bad time. Oh high five. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. The enemy media that's lied to everybody
[29:02.460 --> 29:04.460]  Over and over again
[29:04.460 --> 29:08.060]  It's now saying I am the devil. They have a talking point of play when we come back
[29:09.180 --> 29:12.780]  On CNN on Fox on MSNBC on all the channels saying
[29:13.980 --> 29:17.020]  No one should interview me as pure evil. Look at the next guest
[29:17.020 --> 29:24.140]  Now I'm more liberal. I say, you know, we interviewed child molesters and murderers and and and dictators. So, you know, he's worse than them, but
[29:25.020 --> 29:27.020]  he's and then
[29:27.660 --> 29:35.660]  Stilted Brian Stilted says of CNN. He says but Jones is viral. He's he's dangerous. I had just that's right, isn't it?
[29:35.660 --> 29:41.660]  It's true because you do look like Humpty Dumpty. You do look like a three-year-old acting tough. You are a big fat lying joke
[29:41.660 --> 29:45.980]  You look like you have little peg teeth that are like, you know, on a pig's mouth or something like a little pig toy
[29:46.700 --> 29:49.580]  I mean, you just it's I mean, I'm sorry. You're a joke
[29:49.900 --> 29:56.860]  You actually think you're manly and powerful and smart reading off teleprompters. You're you're a fool
[29:58.140 --> 30:04.940]  But you are who CNN thinks is impressive and who's CNN thinks will get the word out and how great this is all gonna be
[30:05.420 --> 30:07.420]  It's amazing
[30:07.420 --> 30:12.540]  How great this is all gonna be. It's amazing. MSM is collapsing
[30:12.700 --> 30:19.340]  But during the trump revolution the last eight months, it's gone up a little bit from its all-time low because it's interesting again to tune in
[30:20.140 --> 30:23.020]  Because we really have a real president that's cut taxes
[30:23.820 --> 30:29.820]  Or is moving to do that by cutting the regulations that has cut taxes and who is trying to get more jobs back into the country and killing
[30:29.900 --> 30:34.140]  Obamacare and killing the tpp and killing the carbon tax that only we have to pay
[30:34.140 --> 30:38.220]  And so I know you're mad there's three trillion the stock market and there's hope again in jobs
[30:38.300 --> 30:41.820]  And I know you're upset that you know some of the illegal aliens and jihadists can't get in
[30:42.300 --> 30:48.060]  But the good news is the globalists are upset because trump really is trying to be president
[30:48.460 --> 30:54.220]  We're gonna come back with all the clips stay with us spread the word. We're live countering the msm lie machine
[30:55.820 --> 31:02.220]  More than two years ago info wars first told you about our research into what has been called the iodine conspiracy
[31:02.220 --> 31:08.620]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate iq and how the government

[35:00.300 --> 35:02.940]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[35:10.300 --> 35:16.780]  Live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[35:17.100 --> 35:19.100]  The war was lost
[35:19.260 --> 35:21.260]  The treaty signed
[35:21.260 --> 35:24.780]  That was not god segment should not air on mvc. Why?
[35:27.020 --> 35:31.740]  Well, I think that covering people like alex jones is important. I should make that clear at the outside
[35:31.820 --> 35:35.420]  I think that the rise of these people who foment hate and
[35:36.060 --> 35:41.100]  Spew lies is important to our culture. It's obviously tapping into something that's happening in america
[35:41.660 --> 35:45.900]  I just think the context in which this coverage takes place is really important
[35:45.900 --> 35:52.940]  And if you were to tell me that NBC were doing an hour-long white paper so to speak or an hour-long documentary
[35:53.420 --> 35:58.700]  On the rise of this kind of disinformation media empires. I would say that's great
[35:58.780 --> 36:03.340]  you know, we should definitely take a hard look at that and what has brought it about and what has made it such
[36:03.980 --> 36:05.980]  such a
[36:06.140 --> 36:11.980]  Really scary part of the media landscape. These are really important things to cover and some people are doing a great job of getting out
[36:11.980 --> 36:16.700]  They're uncovering it. I don't think giving alex jones 15 or 16 minutes
[36:17.260 --> 36:22.620]  To simply spin his views and to spin his media image is the way in which to attack this
[36:23.340 --> 36:25.340]  And as I as I wrote the other day
[36:26.140 --> 36:30.060]  Megan kelly has not proven herself to be the kind of dog interviewer
[36:30.540 --> 36:34.940]  That would be able to make make a meal of this. I just don't see it
[36:35.340 --> 36:41.580]  That's interesting that maybe she is not the right person to be in this position interviewing this conspiracy theorist charlie
[36:41.580 --> 36:44.140]  What do you say on that? I think that you know
[36:44.940 --> 36:49.900]  There's a there's a good case to be made that that's true, especially from what we've seen in the lead-up to all of this
[36:49.980 --> 36:51.980]  but I I think that
[36:52.060 --> 36:54.300]  There's this sort of dangerous argument right now that
[36:55.020 --> 36:58.860]  There should be you know people on a list that can't be given a platform
[36:59.100 --> 37:01.820]  And I think that that is part of sort of an old media argument
[37:02.860 --> 37:07.500]  Cover your ears. Don't hear it. Don't just that the media are gatekeepers and sort of you know have to
[37:07.500 --> 37:13.980]  Vett who people can see and I think that ignores the fact that helix jones has a huge platform and he's very
[37:15.020 --> 37:20.540]  influential and there's this whole thing happening online and over his terrestrial radio stations that I
[37:20.860 --> 37:27.340]  You know we we need to talk about as a country and normal people need to know about that's exactly what kelly and her boss
[37:27.660 --> 37:29.740]  NBC news chairman and he lacks said to me a few days ago
[37:30.060 --> 37:34.300]  They said hey terrorists and child molesters and serial killers have been interviewed on television
[37:34.300 --> 37:37.980]  What's different about this about this hate monger this conspiracy theorist?
[37:38.300 --> 37:42.540]  I wonder if what's different charlie is it the country feels very anxious right now
[37:42.700 --> 37:45.900]  Obviously very deviant saying kill everybody and kill the president
[37:46.620 --> 37:52.220]  There's a maybe a fear of spreading that virus more fully on a big network like the national broadcasting company
[37:52.380 --> 37:56.700]  And I think that's sort of where mo and I are kind of agreeing on on our arguments
[37:56.700 --> 38:00.220]  Which is that there's a way to interview him and there's a way to be
[38:00.940 --> 38:02.300]  um
[38:02.300 --> 38:07.340]  Just you know very intense and to really take him to task and to go at and hey, we don't know
[38:07.340 --> 38:08.620]  We haven't seen the full interview yet
[38:08.620 --> 38:09.100]  Exactly
[38:09.100 --> 38:11.740]  I suspect that if if there have been that moment that
[38:12.300 --> 38:17.260]  Is stunning moment that mbc would have released it as a preview, but we don't know we have to see the full interview
[38:18.380 --> 38:22.540]  All right for this segment the next uh and for running shotgun the next few hours. Mike cernvich is here
[38:23.420 --> 38:28.540]  We've got of course dr. Steve pacinic who's worked with the cia state department best-selling author researcher
[38:28.540 --> 38:32.860]  Hopefully the camp david accords you name it. That's what the president is this weekend is any introduction
[38:32.860 --> 38:35.900]  I wanted to get his take on this. He's a smart guy. He doesn't buy into
[38:36.620 --> 38:40.780]  Uh what happened reportedly there in new town? I personally can't prove one or the other
[38:40.860 --> 38:45.980]  So i'm just gonna say heart goes out to the families and I believe it happened taking the american people's guns won't make a safe
[38:46.380 --> 38:49.100]  Little you know letting jahadi's in to do it won't keep us safe
[38:49.740 --> 38:52.140]  You know doing all this, but but that's a separate issue. They are
[38:53.260 --> 38:55.500]  They're caught red-handed lying about this interview
[38:55.500 --> 38:58.300]  We have the tape of her saying it wouldn't be on these subjects
[38:59.180 --> 39:04.220]  Even msm admits she's been very very disingenuous. They said they're re-editing it to make it even more vicious
[39:04.540 --> 39:10.300]  She's called me despicable all these horrible names. Well, she's totally duplicitous then because she's on the phone
[39:11.100 --> 39:14.300]  You're basically coming on to me. I mean she is like pouring it on
[39:15.020 --> 39:18.540]  Uh like she was trying to sell me a timeshare or trying to get me to buy a lap dance
[39:18.700 --> 39:22.620]  I mean whatever it was so dr. Steve pacinic. Why is the msm?
[39:22.620 --> 39:25.660]  So hysterical for two weeks because I don't even want info
[39:26.220 --> 39:27.660]  Info wars be the top story
[39:27.660 --> 39:31.820]  It you know, it's kind of creepy at a level, but it also makes me think why are they so weak?
[39:31.980 --> 39:36.220]  What are they flipping out about and then is it true what a lot of people are saying that
[39:37.020 --> 39:41.980]  Megan kelly and nbc have already lost this no matter how much they edit this piece that's coming up in an hour and 20 minutes
[39:43.180 --> 39:50.940]  Alex I have been waiting 14 years for somebody stupid enough to come in and try to manipulate
[39:50.940 --> 39:52.380]  a
[39:52.380 --> 39:56.140]  Interview with you from the mainstream media and let me tell you why
[39:56.860 --> 40:01.100]  Every one of those journalists including the people on bus fee. He got it close enough
[40:01.100 --> 40:08.220]  But the woman on the variety which is a lousy paper anywhere. I worked in Hollywood. You don't have to listen to the stupidity
[40:08.300 --> 40:10.060]  But here's the issue
[40:10.060 --> 40:15.900]  The issue is very simple. You are a master of psychological operations. They don't understand it
[40:15.900 --> 40:24.380]  They don't get it mainstream media never understood it. They thought that they could pander to an individual that's their standard operating procedure
[40:24.700 --> 40:30.460]  And then they could literally fillate them verbally almost what she did, you know, you're great. You're wonderful
[40:30.860 --> 40:33.500]  I want to have I want to get to know you
[40:34.140 --> 40:38.380]  And I want to be able to show you in the full extent of who you are
[40:39.180 --> 40:40.460]  absurd
[40:40.460 --> 40:44.620]  At the same time she had no idea that you were that
[40:44.620 --> 40:50.220]  That capable that clever and also you had become a master of science
[40:50.300 --> 40:55.260]  This is not just a hobby for you. You are a master of letting her come in
[40:55.820 --> 41:00.940]  You allowed her to keep talking. You never revealed your hand. You're then you control
[41:01.580 --> 41:06.540]  The dialogue even though she felt she was in control and because of her narcissism
[41:06.940 --> 41:11.740]  Because she felt she was in control of anything when she was in control of nothing
[41:11.740 --> 41:13.740]  She felt she could
[41:14.780 --> 41:21.740]  Create the outcome of this interview in a way that portrayed you in the light that NBC had wanted
[41:22.220 --> 41:32.940]  What they did was to damage their credibility to damage the peacock to damage everything that msnbc stands for as well as mbc
[41:33.260 --> 41:37.580]  I've worked with mbc in the past less moon vest. I knew about zooker
[41:37.580 --> 41:42.780]  Bob greenblatt is now head of this station. He should be fired
[41:43.340 --> 41:48.140]  15 million should be thrown out. She should be fired if I were Comcast
[41:48.300 --> 41:53.980]  I would fire the entire mbc entertainment staff for the stupidity that they understood
[41:53.980 --> 41:57.900]  Okay, but I don't want to put too good a face on this because she didn't interview me for two hours in a hot box
[41:57.980 --> 42:01.740]  They're gonna be able to edit together and look like hell but but still why are the execs?
[42:01.740 --> 42:07.820]  Calling this a disaster and and and panicking because I mean, I mean, I know you think this is a big defeat for them
[42:07.820 --> 42:10.380]  But I I just want to really look at this coldly
[42:11.180 --> 42:16.380]  Because I just tried to protect myself. I knew she was lying. I intended to expose it once she put out the lie
[42:16.540 --> 42:22.700]  I didn't know though that they were like betting the farm on it. This is like pre-war invasion level propaganda
[42:22.700 --> 42:27.740]  I mean this is on every channel in the country for two weeks foaming at the mouth and now they're all panicking
[42:27.740 --> 42:33.500]  And freaking out and then everybody's saying it's a big defeat quite frankly. I'm not the master of psychological operations
[42:33.820 --> 42:37.260]  I don't know why the wicked are fleeing when none pursue. I don't get the freak out
[42:37.340 --> 42:42.380]  They're gonna go on there and have parents saying I basically killed their kids and you know all this other sad stuff or that
[42:42.380 --> 42:44.380]  I don't care about their kids
[42:44.940 --> 42:47.100]  The truth of the matter is number one
[42:47.100 --> 42:53.660]  They never took the time they being either Megan Kelly green bladder anybody in the mbc network to study
[42:53.660 --> 43:01.100]  Who alex jones was to understand his modus operandi to understand how many people he had on the staff to understand
[43:01.100 --> 43:07.340]  What issues he picks and which issues he doesn't pick? I've always known one thing about alex jones
[43:07.660 --> 43:12.220]  He is capable of being sarcastic. He is capable of telling the truth
[43:12.540 --> 43:15.580]  He's capable of combining fiction with fact
[43:15.900 --> 43:21.500]  But you have to be able to titrate the fact in order to address the issue
[43:21.500 --> 43:28.380]  They had none of those capabilities. What I'm saying to you today is not that it was just a grand victory on your part
[43:28.700 --> 43:34.700]  It was a major defeat on the part of mbc. Oh, I agree. They ran off the cliff because I just want to be clear here
[43:34.940 --> 43:40.060]  I'm not I mean, come on. It's you on the show. It's all other guests like sernovich. It's everybody. I mean, it's info wars family
[43:40.300 --> 43:41.260]  They're afraid of it
[43:41.260 --> 43:46.860]  And but the the reason we went to that family the reason I've been on abc. I've been on mbc
[43:46.860 --> 43:52.780]  I've been on all the stations, but that's a standard format. It didn't work. It didn't work for 9 11
[43:52.780 --> 43:55.500]  It didn't work for the past 14 or 15 years
[43:55.820 --> 44:01.900]  But I happen to have been lucky enough to find an alex jones and he in turn found me and what happened is
[44:02.140 --> 44:05.980]  We've created along with others what's called the alternative media
[44:06.380 --> 44:12.140]  The only thing the mainstream media can talk about is that we're racist. We're not that we're uh,
[44:12.140 --> 44:18.620]  You know, we're propagating hate, which we're not we're propagating war, which we haven't which we've
[44:19.340 --> 44:24.540]  Uncovered conspiracies which are in fact conspiracies because I work in the intelligence community
[44:24.620 --> 44:30.140]  I'm still working with the intelligence community. They can't deny it yet not one of their
[44:30.780 --> 44:35.180]  Individuals not one of their sycophants could come up and say intelligently
[44:35.180 --> 44:42.540]  How does this monitor what happens in the intelligence world and the world of military operations in the world of
[44:43.100 --> 44:45.980]  Say they're got to go to break machete when I come back and have certain was coming with some questions
[44:45.980 --> 44:50.060]  I just want to ask you what comes next. What are you expecting from this piece?
[44:50.140 --> 44:54.940]  That's going to air in about an hour and 15 minutes live coverage folks of the media wars. Stay with us
[44:55.980 --> 45:03.740]  Following the liberal outcry over making kelly interviewing alex jones nvc news executives have been scrambling to further edit their hit piece
[45:03.740 --> 45:07.900]  On alex jones the word now is that making kelly has changed her sunday night show
[45:08.060 --> 45:15.580]  Featuring alex jones's interview by inviting sandy hook families on to play edited clips of alex talking while they have the parents
[45:16.140 --> 45:23.580]  Emotionally respond one thing is for sure with how long it's taking nvc to edit making kelly's interview with alex jones prior to just
[45:23.820 --> 45:29.020]  Earing it we can expect that they will be misrepresenting his statements with skilled editing techniques
[45:29.020 --> 45:34.140]  Why not just release the entire interview on edited and prove you're not fake news nvc?
[45:34.220 --> 45:41.100]  They'd like you to believe that alex jones not adam lanza is the real bad guy in the sandy hook massacre because he said he believes
[45:41.100 --> 45:43.260]  There was a government conspiracy at work
[45:43.340 --> 45:50.540]  However, all of this will backfire on the mainstream media as everyday americans are increasingly becoming more aware of the staging

[49:27.260 --> 49:33.020]  We can all sit around joking about this. I mean I walk we walk the restaurant today. Everybody was looking. It was like
[49:33.420 --> 49:35.820]  This is it's it's a job we got to do
[49:36.380 --> 49:38.860]  Like because they're saying i'm the devil but the thing is most the public
[49:39.500 --> 49:41.500]  Isn't buying it
[49:41.580 --> 49:45.420]  It's crazy. I want to ask dr. Pachinick in closing and he can come back later in the week for longer
[49:45.420 --> 49:47.420]  I appreciate him joining us about where he sees this going
[49:47.420 --> 49:53.260]  But we should tell folks we're 47 minutes into this live transmission. We're going for four hours about an hour and 15 minutes
[49:53.500 --> 49:59.340]  Kelly show starts. I think they'll tentpole it. I think the middle of the broadcast will be the demonization piece
[49:59.340 --> 50:01.340]  It's only 11 minutes long
[50:01.340 --> 50:02.860]  Then we'll analyze it
[50:02.860 --> 50:06.060]  And then i'm going to decide whether i'm going to which parts the audio i'm going to release because mainly i think i'm
[50:06.060 --> 50:08.540]  Going to take the clips where they lie and but that's some work
[50:08.540 --> 50:14.220]  You got to then go find the places where they cut the two pieces together to show what they did which we saw that they did in the promo
[50:14.220 --> 50:19.340]  Uh, so mike sernovich, how important is it for listeners and viewers to be part of the info war right now?
[50:19.660 --> 50:23.500]  On facebook on google on twitter to share the live video feeds
[50:24.060 --> 50:28.940]  Uh on facebook on twitter and create a twitter storm with the hashtag you came up with
[50:29.420 --> 50:35.660]  Yes, so the hashtag of the day is jones v. Kelly because this is the big heavyweight fight as the great guests noted
[50:36.060 --> 50:41.580]  NBC did not know what they're getting into this is the super bowl of media everybody that i've heard from in media ago
[50:41.580 --> 50:45.980]  This is like everybody wanted to watch pelly versus sernovich now everybody wants to watch
[50:46.460 --> 50:51.260]  Jones versus kelly it is a fight and it's a fight for your survival. I was just telling them move the camera over more on you
[50:51.260 --> 50:54.940]  That's all i was doing i'm giving secret hand signals. We don't have teleproposal negative hand signals
[50:55.020 --> 50:57.740]  I was telling them to move the camera more that way go ahead. Sorry exactly
[50:57.740 --> 51:03.180]  So jones v. Kelly is the hashtag share it live. This is going to be a historic moment and unprecedented why?
[51:03.740 --> 51:05.740]  We will be live reacting
[51:05.820 --> 51:09.900]  I got this idea actually because joe rogan does those fight companions and you know
[51:09.900 --> 51:13.980]  Four or five guys that watch the fight and they'll just kind of hang out and people love that kind of stuff
[51:14.300 --> 51:16.300]  And i go why don't we do that?
[51:16.300 --> 51:20.060]  Why don't we do that we live react? Why don't we maybe open a bottle of wine?
[51:20.460 --> 51:23.580]  Relax get a big panel in and we well i did buy a bottle of champagne
[51:23.580 --> 51:29.100]  I'm not a big drinker but i bought a bottle of champagne and and and i'll let you guys decide if we think that
[51:29.740 --> 51:33.180]  It blew up in her face which is going to be horribly edited then we'll have the champagne
[51:33.580 --> 51:35.580]  It's going to be horribly edited but again
[51:35.580 --> 51:39.980]  The the message is for example you you issued that wonderful heartfelt
[51:40.620 --> 51:44.620]  um father's name message to the family of the new town family that we're going to play next hour
[51:44.940 --> 51:48.380]  And the left wing media is already saying that that was cows of you to do it
[51:48.380 --> 51:51.580]  So those people can never be reached and are never going to be happy
[51:51.900 --> 51:55.340]  But the the patriots in america so we were in oscum which is actually a liberal town
[51:55.660 --> 51:59.820]  We went to breakfast this morning and everybody's smiling alex i'm a big fan
[52:00.300 --> 52:04.860]  Somebody who worked in the kitchen actually told his wife who was one of the waitresses there go tell alex
[52:04.860 --> 52:07.660]  Go say hi. Oh my god. We're so excited for meg and kelly now
[52:08.380 --> 52:11.900]  My belief here's the bigger thing. I don't care about the editing thing
[52:12.380 --> 52:18.700]  I feel like meg and kelly used you and that you are legitimizing her by giving her an audience that
[52:19.260 --> 52:21.900]  She doesn't deserve. How do you answer that accusation alex?
[52:22.940 --> 52:24.140]  Well, come on
[52:24.140 --> 52:28.380]  I'm just an archetype of the alternative emerging media and the fall of the dinosaurs
[52:28.700 --> 52:32.460]  But certainly her show was tanking even putin wouldn't get the ratings up
[52:32.460 --> 52:36.940]  So they thought they had this huge event demonized me in the process say things. I didn't say out of context
[52:37.420 --> 52:42.140]  She was meeting with the new town people the whole time. We we checked her tweets that they were always going to be on the show
[52:42.540 --> 52:49.260]  She is so disingenuous. I can't believe she thought that that that we were this dumb really the story is not how smart we are
[52:49.420 --> 52:50.620]  It's how dumb they are
[52:50.620 --> 52:56.380]  But it's almost scary dr. Puccini that you know as we see their system rotting that they seem to be only more arrogant
[52:56.540 --> 52:58.540]  Where do you see this going?
[52:58.540 --> 53:04.540]  I believe I I think what mike said is correct. This is the super bowl of information warfare
[53:04.620 --> 53:07.020]  This is the moment that we have looked for
[53:07.580 --> 53:14.380]  Besides hillary clinton's demise and this is coming now into the demise pretty much of nbc
[53:14.620 --> 53:15.900]  I think
[53:15.900 --> 53:22.380]  Although mike has a point that you may have increased the ratings for meg and kelly to the mouse and kelly is finished
[53:22.380 --> 53:28.860]  So is bob greenblatt. So is comcast. There will be a lot of traders like me tomorrow on the stock market
[53:29.420 --> 53:31.980]  Shorting comcast will be shorting g.e.
[53:32.380 --> 53:38.140]  Will be shorting a lot of the companies that are involved in this type of major entertainment including disney
[53:38.540 --> 53:44.780]  So what you're doing is without realizing you're affecting the stock markets and the value of these companies
[53:45.100 --> 53:49.420]  If I were the ceo of comcast, I would immediately fire greenblatt
[53:49.420 --> 53:57.180]  I immediately fire meg and kelly the issue of sandy hook is only relevant to people like me because we knew this was a false flag
[53:57.580 --> 54:04.220]  I knew eric holder had lied. I knew he had given them what we call project longevity 50 million dollars
[54:04.540 --> 54:11.260]  I knew that the building was empty that it was asbestos. I knew governor dan maloy and irish catholic moron
[54:11.740 --> 54:17.100]  Had no idea how to run the state and in fact not only had he not run the state properly
[54:17.100 --> 54:19.900]  He is now in bankruptcy all the hedge fund
[54:20.460 --> 54:27.020]  Owners who I know a lot of them because I worked on wall street left down to miami. Thanks to dan maloy and sandy
[54:27.580 --> 54:31.100]  So every one of these paid parents whoever they may be
[54:31.580 --> 54:36.860]  Are totally totally disingenuous. That's not your problem. That's well. Let me stop
[54:36.940 --> 54:40.060]  I know there's big charities involved all the rest of the media not the parents
[54:40.780 --> 54:46.300]  Are acting like I somehow did this all I know is they've staged fake things before I'm not even getting into this
[54:46.300 --> 54:50.860]  They're hanging it around my neck though when when the world didn't believe the media
[54:51.020 --> 54:57.420]  The problem is the world didn't believe obama and the media that shows they don't have credibility because they've lied so much
[54:57.660 --> 55:00.940]  That's their problem not ours and that's the real story here, too
[55:00.940 --> 55:05.580]  Is that there's because I for example do believe that sandy hook actually happened more or less
[55:05.580 --> 55:10.700]  This is reported now whether or not the soddies the sorrows of somebody paid somebody to go in and kill
[55:11.020 --> 55:15.420]  The kids or whatever as part of their takeover that could be that could be who funded it
[55:15.420 --> 55:20.300]  Who funded that operation just like the soddies funded 9 11 and made that happen 9 11
[55:20.300 --> 55:21.900]  I believe happened also
[55:21.900 --> 55:24.940]  But the bigger question is why is it that so few people
[55:25.580 --> 55:31.260]  Trust the news because the news is uh, they faked footage in the war in iraq
[55:31.900 --> 55:36.460]  They talked about the the kuwaiti, uh, you know the iraqi soldiers throwing babies out of the incubator
[55:36.860 --> 55:42.380]  So the real story here is that a lot of people don't believe what the news is reporting even when it's uh,
[55:42.380 --> 55:45.740]  Uh, exactly. Let me just push in like this because he's got to leave it alone. That's a great point
[55:46.300 --> 55:53.180]  It's okay for us not to believe official events and question them and then have our views change views whatever since when is
[55:53.820 --> 55:57.580]  I mean as you heard earlier on cnn that i'm worse than child molesters and killers
[55:58.380 --> 56:03.100]  Tom broke up come up and said i am an unalloyed racist that means complete racist and then showed no proof
[56:03.340 --> 56:09.820]  That's fake news since when do they say the fbi director former director never said that trope said, you know
[56:09.820 --> 56:14.540]  Yeah, I tried to stop the investigation when we have the two videos of him saying it they lie
[56:14.780 --> 56:19.740]  Let me have specific that i mean have you noticed or do you agree that their lying has actually intensified?
[56:19.980 --> 56:21.740]  What does that signify?
[56:21.740 --> 56:26.620]  Well, it's what i said for a long time. I happen to know tom brokaw. I was on his show
[56:26.940 --> 56:31.340]  He's not the most competent interview. He's now an older man who lives in montana
[56:31.980 --> 56:38.220]  So what you're seeing is literally the end of a tom brokaw the end of dan rather the end of meghan kelly
[56:38.220 --> 56:43.020]  It's what we've been talking about for a long time the demise of main street media
[56:43.180 --> 56:47.820]  That doesn't mean that they have the protection of the first amendment or any other amendment
[56:47.900 --> 56:51.820]  That means that as a business they are finished the new york times is finished
[56:52.140 --> 56:55.980]  Washington post is finished whether you agree or you don't agree
[56:56.140 --> 57:01.740]  What happened was the new york times never was able to delve into the issue of 9 11
[57:01.820 --> 57:07.340]  It happens that i know it was a false flag because the guys involved were responsible to me
[57:07.340 --> 57:13.660]  So cia had a reported and my military intelligence had a reported to me and several others
[57:13.660 --> 57:16.300]  So that wasn't a conjecture whether you believe it or not
[57:16.300 --> 57:18.300]  No, no, we know the attack happened
[57:18.300 --> 57:23.340]  But they're obviously criminal elements working that were working on it. Yeah, but that's the broader point is that um
[57:23.740 --> 57:28.860]  You know, it's important to have these conversations and with asked what the media loses sight of is they won't say for example
[57:28.860 --> 57:34.300]  Hey, mike sernich believes sandy hook happened as described, but yet he'll talk to somebody who may be disagree
[57:34.300 --> 57:38.380]  Well, let's expand on that. Yeah, I think mike's point is correct
[57:38.540 --> 57:40.220]  Mike has hit it right on the head
[57:40.220 --> 57:44.060]  We don't have a dialogue within here the three of us may not agree
[57:44.140 --> 57:48.300]  But we've always been in concert in believing the right to disagree
[57:48.380 --> 57:55.020]  Well, let's expand on that emblematic as last year when komo on a cnn show said i'm allowed to look at wiki leaks
[57:55.340 --> 58:01.100]  You can't you'll be arrested if you do i'll tell you what's in them and then they wouldn't tell you that is a joke there
[58:01.100 --> 58:05.740]  Uh, dr. Peschenek closing comments and thanks for joining us. Well, let me show you what's a greater joke
[58:05.980 --> 58:12.060]  When I go on the internet google tells me what to say what not to say then they tell me how much money
[58:12.140 --> 58:20.060]  I can or cannot make I have worn the founders of google whom I know from stanford that if they continue this illicit practice
[58:20.300 --> 58:27.900]  There will be anonymous retribution for this. You cannot control the media. This they won't let me type cuss words on my iphone
[58:27.900 --> 58:35.180]  Well, it's not only that they literally do not like and they tell me outright that I can't talk about political issues
[58:35.260 --> 58:39.980]  So I won't be reimbursed. So once you get into my pocket and you get into my thinking
[58:40.300 --> 58:45.100]  This is where america identifies with me with mike with alex jones with stone
[58:45.660 --> 58:51.660]  You can't get into the business of manipulating our lives our thoughts and our money once you do that
[58:51.980 --> 58:55.180]  It's irrelevant who you that's right. Thank you dr. Peschenek. Let's talk soon. Thank you
[58:55.180 --> 58:57.180]  Peschenek.com
[58:57.180 --> 58:59.820]  Thank you. Yeah, so it is so interesting too because
[59:00.540 --> 59:06.860]  The idea that you know, again, we I believe sandy hulk hat sandy, um, sandy hulk happen, right? He doesn't it's okay
[59:07.260 --> 59:11.420]  We can still talk. We don't have to shut people down. Well, they certainly use it to blame gun owners
[59:11.500 --> 59:16.620]  It hadn't had any part of it. Well, yeah, it's being used by bloom burgers is big offensive. But listen going to break. Let me just say this
[59:17.900 --> 59:20.460]  Next hour has regular radio ads slash tv
[59:20.460 --> 59:26.460]  But then when that's over two more hours at least of live coverage during megan kelly. So in one hour her show starts
[59:26.460 --> 59:32.300]  We'll have it up on the screen there. We'll show you the promos. They're airing live time. We'll analyze it for you here
[59:33.100 --> 59:36.300]  And then we'll take calls have a bunch of guests on after that
[59:36.300 --> 59:38.060]  But the big thing is
[59:38.060 --> 59:39.500]  Let them know there's a first amendment
[59:39.500 --> 59:45.020]  Don't let them set the president try to shut the show down spread the links at info wars.com the live video feeds
[59:45.180 --> 59:48.940]  Everybody, you know you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it
[59:48.940 --> 59:55.500]  Why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most
[59:55.580 --> 1:00:00.860]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system
[1:00:00.860 --> 1:00:03.660]  But right now we're dealing with massive
[1:00:04.380 --> 1:00:10.540]  Parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[1:00:11.180 --> 1:00:16.700]  Uh spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites
[1:00:16.700 --> 1:00:20.460]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there
[1:00:20.460 --> 1:00:26.940]  You have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite plans at least twice a year
[1:00:26.940 --> 1:00:29.980]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today

[1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:29.100]  Jack the sobeck who was there when another great patriot laura lomer
[1:02:30.060 --> 1:02:32.780]  charged up during the central park
[1:02:34.140 --> 1:02:40.060]  Simulated murder of president trump that's become international news as we call for peace the left calls for violence
[1:02:41.660 --> 1:02:44.780]  And we've got a bunch of other guests coming up as we cover the meg and kelly
[1:02:45.260 --> 1:02:47.500]  Demonization piece that is about to happen
[1:02:47.820 --> 1:02:51.260]  We're going to go to break here in just a few minutes to come back to the next long segment with jack the sobeck
[1:02:51.260 --> 1:02:55.500]  The riding shotgun with me will also be co-hosting that after I leave because I want him to have the floor
[1:02:56.060 --> 1:02:58.540]  Is mike sternum which mike what are you expecting coming up tonight?
[1:02:59.180 --> 1:03:03.340]  Yeah, they they're going to say they're going to try to pin everything bad that has happened on you
[1:03:03.500 --> 1:03:06.860]  Even though all you do is host and discuss issue discuss issues
[1:03:07.340 --> 1:03:12.140]  And they're in game again as they want to get every independent media shut down and discredit independent media
[1:03:12.460 --> 1:03:15.420]  They want to pressure people to not believe you but
[1:03:16.540 --> 1:03:18.300]  Here's the way I was scripted
[1:03:18.300 --> 1:03:22.060]  I would say okay. There's this piece of parlor shooting alex jones. It's fault
[1:03:22.620 --> 1:03:28.700]  Sandy hook here's some parents. They're hurting. It's alex jones. It's fault. They're going to blame everything alex jones
[1:03:28.780 --> 1:03:33.820]  Lost his kid in the cussing battle not unfit father parents are bad on father's day. Yeah, exactly
[1:03:33.820 --> 1:03:36.620]  That's why the air did is a sigh up against fathers and fathers day
[1:03:37.020 --> 1:03:43.340]  So that's so obvious. Yeah, and that's why people aren't really going to fall for it because like we were talking about earlier with uh steve is
[1:03:43.340 --> 1:03:50.300]  Steve and I disagree but the idea is that let's talk about it right now the left and this is why you know
[1:03:50.300 --> 1:03:55.420]  It's so important to talk to jack, you know a citizen journalist and a hero in that regard is if I disagree with somebody
[1:03:55.420 --> 1:03:58.700]  I'm going to say let's let's talk about it. Let's debate it. What what's your side of the issue?
[1:03:59.260 --> 1:04:01.580]  Antifa and these left wing terrorist organizations
[1:04:02.060 --> 1:04:05.820]  They will hit you with a brick hit you with a bike lock and the media looks the other way
[1:04:05.980 --> 1:04:10.300]  They say it's good. Actually. Yeah, and the media won't cover it the violence against us and that's why
[1:04:10.300 --> 1:04:15.180]  Pasobak has now forced an international conversation on left-wing terrorism
[1:04:16.060 --> 1:04:19.500]  And that's happening and and then I noticed in his twitter feed and on mine and yours
[1:04:19.900 --> 1:04:23.180]  They were making jokes like oh, that's not about trump that play
[1:04:24.460 --> 1:04:26.860]  So they act like we're idiots. They play these mind games
[1:04:27.420 --> 1:04:33.980]  Yeah, they lie they lie right to your face and that's why that disruption very peaceful unlike the left was so important because now
[1:04:33.980 --> 1:04:39.740]  They have to talk about it now. They can't cover up the issue now. They can't pretend like they don't know what is really going on here
[1:04:39.740 --> 1:04:43.420]  I want to go out to break with just part of a piece that was done
[1:04:44.220 --> 1:04:49.020]  By mark dice on this we're going to come back and go to jack pasobak here on the other side
[1:04:49.020 --> 1:04:52.940]  But here is part of the breakdown that's up on info wars.com by mark dice
[1:04:53.740 --> 1:04:58.300]  Several brave protesters have interrupted the play that's depicting the assassination of president trump
[1:04:58.540 --> 1:05:02.620]  That's being carried on in the middle of central park in new york city a play
[1:05:02.620 --> 1:05:07.420]  Which is being funded by cnn's parent company time warner as you may have heard
[1:05:07.420 --> 1:05:12.220]  It's a perverted and despicably twisted version of shakespeare's julius caesar
[1:05:12.540 --> 1:05:19.100]  Which depicts president trump as caesar who has a wife who also has a slovenian accent
[1:05:19.340 --> 1:05:25.100]  Who likes to dress in designer clothes who is stabbed to death on stage
[1:05:25.340 --> 1:05:31.100]  Even in today's dangerous political climate and after the attempted assassination of several republican congressmen
[1:05:31.340 --> 1:05:35.580]  The liberal lunatics still think it's a good idea to be putting this play on
[1:05:35.580 --> 1:05:42.540]  Which many say is attempting to incite more violence against conservatives and possibly against the president himself
[1:05:42.700 --> 1:05:48.780]  So friday night in the middle of the play several brave protesters decided to denounce this despicable play
[1:05:49.180 --> 1:05:55.660]  One of which identified as laura lumar decided to storm the stage and give the audience a piece of her mind
[1:05:55.660 --> 1:06:07.660]  Here's that clip
[1:06:07.660 --> 1:06:09.660]  We're going to pause security
[1:06:09.660 --> 1:06:17.660]  This is violence
[1:06:18.540 --> 1:06:25.660]  The new york liberals are literally booing her for denouncing the violent depiction of an assassination of our president
[1:06:32.300 --> 1:06:37.260]  Now they got mad at a rodeo clown who by the way was hispanic making front of obama
[1:06:37.260 --> 1:06:40.940]  But that meant that had to be banned, but if you want to simulate killing the president
[1:06:41.180 --> 1:06:45.660]  They admit they're simulating it when people complain they say it's not happening jack posovic will break this down straight ahead
[1:06:45.740 --> 1:06:50.140]  We have a lot of other guests coming up and some surprise guests, but my exteriors are just pointing out to me
[1:06:50.220 --> 1:06:55.500]  They're blocking the promotion of this live feed and jones versus kelly right now
[1:06:56.700 --> 1:07:04.220]  Embricks essentials, that's my middle name. I've spent seven years off and on trying to get a big national brand
[1:07:04.220 --> 1:07:10.940]  That's already trusted to let us private label an entire line of personal care products. That's organic my quality
[1:07:11.100 --> 1:07:13.100]  This is one of the top three
[1:07:13.580 --> 1:07:18.460]  selling organic brands in the country that puts out high quality organic shampoo
[1:07:19.020 --> 1:07:24.700]  Mouthwash you name it and they're such patriots. They have led us basically keep their well-known packaging
[1:07:24.860 --> 1:07:28.620]  It is an answer to prayer and because we're cutting out the middleman 20 off retail
[1:07:28.620 --> 1:07:36.460]  Sign up for auto ship an additional 25 off. It's all there the body wash the shampoo the deodorant the mouthwash
[1:07:36.700 --> 1:07:40.220]  All of it is truly game-changing. It is the exact same product
[1:07:40.300 --> 1:07:48.380]  Just the name is different Embricks essentials and it's on average 20 off what it would be in stores buying it directly from info or store
[1:07:48.620 --> 1:07:53.580]  Dot com help us win the info or while getting products everybody needs info wars life dot com
[1:07:53.660 --> 1:07:56.060]  Where you'll find the entire line of Embricks essentials
[1:07:56.060 --> 1:08:04.460]  From the front lines of the information war, it's alex jones
[1:08:04.460 --> 1:08:06.460]  So
[1:08:21.820 --> 1:08:25.580]  We've got colleges all over the united states where they have no white weekends
[1:08:27.820 --> 1:08:31.260]  We see absolutely massive demonization of free speech everywhere
[1:08:31.260 --> 1:08:35.100]  We see the media promoting racism and the murder of president trump
[1:08:35.740 --> 1:08:37.020]  And we see
[1:08:37.020 --> 1:08:40.220]  Laura Lerner and of course jack besovic covering it friday
[1:08:41.180 --> 1:08:45.500]  And I guess there's still two more nights of the shakespeare in the park give the killing president trump
[1:08:46.060 --> 1:08:49.900]  Oh, and there's oh, yeah tonight's gonna be great. I'll tell you I'll tell you about that and break
[1:08:50.220 --> 1:08:53.420]  Well, I'm sure we can cover it live a little bit later. Yeah, you were telling me earlier. So jack
[1:08:54.060 --> 1:08:58.220]  Obviously the left wants violence. They want war. They want to shut us down
[1:08:58.220 --> 1:09:01.660]  Break down what you witnessed that night and and and where all this is going
[1:09:02.540 --> 1:09:07.740]  Yeah, alex the the thing I've got to talk about really and the point I want to make is that that nobody else is making
[1:09:07.820 --> 1:09:11.580]  How's it going? Good to see you good to see you mike you there at the command center
[1:09:11.980 --> 1:09:17.900]  You know what people aren't talking about is just how bloody this scene was you know to see that with my own eyes
[1:09:18.700 --> 1:09:25.740]  Our president being stabbed again and again on stage and then it was like a tarantino film a terrible tarantino film
[1:09:25.740 --> 1:09:33.100]  But then to turn around and see a crowd full of manhattan's, you know elite american citizens cheering it on
[1:09:33.660 --> 1:09:36.380]  Clapping nodding their hands, you know nodding their heads
[1:09:36.540 --> 1:09:43.340]  They're their necklaces and bracelets clinking together as they cheer and applaud this brutal ritual killing of our president
[1:09:43.820 --> 1:09:50.140]  It made my blood run and with the background of calling for violence and death with the congressman and police shot just last week
[1:09:50.620 --> 1:09:52.300]  hanging on to life
[1:09:52.300 --> 1:09:56.620]  And then they're the ones that if we did something like this it'd be the end of the world. I mean they are just a bunch of
[1:09:57.100 --> 1:09:58.620]  frothing betas
[1:09:58.620 --> 1:10:03.660]  That absolutely want power and want to wreck the country now in about fake news jack
[1:10:04.140 --> 1:10:09.820]  A new york times reporter claimed that nobody actually laughed when trump is assassinated on stage
[1:10:10.300 --> 1:10:12.940]  Is that consistent with what you observed when you were there?
[1:10:14.140 --> 1:10:18.540]  No, it's not at all consistent mike and you can go see you know, I don't anywhere anything to hide
[1:10:18.540 --> 1:10:24.140]  We had two periscopes going during the thing. I've got my own video up. You can go back and look at the video
[1:10:24.140 --> 1:10:31.100]  That's the beauty of citizen journalism that I do is I always do a live earlier review set people were enraptured and cheered it
[1:10:31.420 --> 1:10:36.220]  I mean again, why do they lie because I saw it on your facebook twitter everywhere people were saying oh jack
[1:10:36.380 --> 1:10:42.220]  Oh, everybody. This isn't even a play about trump. This is 500 years old. This is this is william shakespeare
[1:10:42.380 --> 1:10:44.380]  I mean, it's crazy how they lie
[1:10:45.500 --> 1:10:47.500]  yeah, they mean
[1:10:47.500 --> 1:10:51.420]  They switch it around when they look bad, you know, they've got an actress up there playing malania and she comes up
[1:10:51.420 --> 1:10:56.060]  That's it's a slovenian accent and it's it's very offensive. It's clearly meant to be malania
[1:10:56.140 --> 1:11:00.780]  This is clearly meant to be some kind of satire. Well, of course, it's trump. It's they got american flags
[1:11:01.020 --> 1:11:04.380]  They got a big tall guy with orange hair. Uh, he's being stabbed to death
[1:11:04.940 --> 1:11:08.700]  And tifa they actually have so the way they did the play and I posted the video as well
[1:11:08.780 --> 1:11:16.300]  Is they have all of the crew that's moving around the sets is chanting antifa slogans as they're moving the set around between scenes
[1:11:16.300 --> 1:11:19.980]  I'm pretty sure william shakespeare didn't write antifa into his play
[1:11:20.220 --> 1:11:26.300]  Yeah, and I like too how these dummies know that we don't understand that the moral of julie Caesar was that brutus lost
[1:11:26.380 --> 1:11:30.860]  And that you shouldn't actually assassinate somebody. I love how they think we didn't all take literature in high school
[1:11:30.860 --> 1:11:36.940]  Like they're so precious. Yeah, what happens to the people that kill Caesar. They get completely wiped out by marg anthony
[1:11:37.020 --> 1:11:40.220]  Yeah, so we would get the last laugh, but I love too how they're like, oh my god
[1:11:40.540 --> 1:11:45.420]  These are literates like dude everybody read that you're freshman year in high school. Don't act like you're some kind of
[1:11:45.420 --> 1:11:48.620]  Let me tell you they are they're gonna have Caesar spirit
[1:11:49.020 --> 1:11:54.380]  What happens if they do kill trump? I mean you talk about a martyr Caesar's spirit stalking around for revenge
[1:11:54.780 --> 1:12:00.860]  Violence will be in such use that you know mothers will just sit back and chop their babies up with the meat cleavers as if it's a
[1:12:01.100 --> 1:12:06.700]  Wonderful thing now. That's actually a paraphrase of the william shakespeare play the media will probably say i'm calling for women
[1:12:06.700 --> 1:12:08.300]  To chop up babies with meat cleavers
[1:12:08.300 --> 1:12:13.020]  Yeah, but and that's why we're calling for unity like ted newton's calling for unity is we are the good guys
[1:12:13.020 --> 1:12:17.340]  The fake news media are the terrorists and and alex and I talked about this and
[1:12:17.740 --> 1:12:21.900]  What you you know, would you join in our pledge jack that jake taper brian stelter?
[1:12:21.900 --> 1:12:27.980]  Nobody immediately joined alex and I have pledged that we disavow all political violence. Why will no one else in the meeting?
[1:12:27.980 --> 1:12:31.180]  That's right. That's right. I mean I call for the libertarians conservatives
[1:12:31.260 --> 1:12:33.980]  Nobody to offensively be violent a time of calm
[1:12:34.300 --> 1:12:35.900]  I call for the left to do the same
[1:12:35.900 --> 1:12:39.580]  You know with the great leadership of an nra board member and patriot
[1:12:39.580 --> 1:12:45.100]  Of course who's now come out and talked about that ted newton. I say we should follow ted newtons lead
[1:12:45.100 --> 1:12:50.380]  We've already done this, but we should reaffirm because they're getting so violent. We're not afraid of their violence
[1:12:51.260 --> 1:12:55.340]  For ourselves individually. We're afraid for the country because they're already saying. Oh, you're scared
[1:12:55.420 --> 1:12:58.940]  Oh, we're gonna get you because we don't want violence, but let me look at a bunch of
[1:12:59.900 --> 1:13:01.740]  Wimps, I mean liberals on average are some of the most
[1:13:02.380 --> 1:13:04.380]  Dumb wimpy pathetic people out there
[1:13:04.620 --> 1:13:08.780]  We're just really trying to not have a civil war and really just don't want more innocent people shot
[1:13:08.780 --> 1:13:15.740]  Especially on father's day. We were watching these shootings happening and on father's day. So that is our challenge right now
[1:13:16.300 --> 1:13:19.100]  Alex jones, you know my service jack posobic
[1:13:19.660 --> 1:13:24.060]  We are all saying that we disavow political violence. Well jake taper and cnn
[1:13:24.060 --> 1:13:27.100]  We would like to extend a as a gesture of goodwill
[1:13:27.580 --> 1:13:31.980]  We would like cnn to join this pledge and if they don't join this pledge
[1:13:32.380 --> 1:13:36.860]  To me that suggests that they endorse it because as you know, if trump doesn't disavow
[1:13:36.860 --> 1:13:43.100]  Everything some somebody says or does then that apparently means he approves it. So yeah, we are challenging the media
[1:13:43.180 --> 1:13:46.220]  Will you join this pledge jack to disavow political violence?
[1:13:46.860 --> 1:13:52.140]  I absolutely join the pledge and as a matter of fact, uh, I'm going to be hosting and I'm hoping uh, you know
[1:13:52.140 --> 1:13:54.140]  I can get your guys backing at this as well
[1:13:54.140 --> 1:13:59.260]  Hosting a rally against political violence at the white house next next sunday
[1:13:59.260 --> 1:14:02.220]  It's going to be june 25th. Love to have you both there if possible
[1:14:02.220 --> 1:14:06.780]  Um, but we want to stand and I would invite people from the left to come and stand with me
[1:14:06.860 --> 1:14:12.380]  Let's have bernie sanders up there. Let's have hillary clinton and barack obama come out and denounce violence
[1:14:12.380 --> 1:14:17.500]  That's done in their name. Let's have islam. Let's have the islamists that don't support what's happening come out and join
[1:14:17.500 --> 1:14:22.380]  So they will I'll hug them. Let's have care. Let's have care. Come on up and disavow all muslim violence
[1:14:22.460 --> 1:14:23.740]  Let's have I want disavow
[1:14:23.740 --> 1:14:27.900]  We should and by the way, I saw news articles saying that you and what's the other lady's name?
[1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:31.660]  I'm gonna be wherever we're lord. Laura. Great lady. I see her work. I just forget names
[1:14:31.660 --> 1:14:34.860]  She she was arrested all the rest of it. I saw that you were paid activist
[1:14:35.020 --> 1:14:38.300]  So when we were setting you up for the show, I said have you been paid and you were like no no
[1:14:38.300 --> 1:14:42.220]  We're doing this on our own, but I just want to say I'm having the CNN as ISIS seeing this terrorist
[1:14:43.020 --> 1:14:47.740]  Uh, you know meme that that that service you're not coming up with and it's not just if you do that
[1:14:47.820 --> 1:14:52.380]  It's anything that's noteworthy like catching CNN doing fake newscaster catching MSNBC
[1:14:52.700 --> 1:14:59.020]  We've only paid out about $10,000 worth, but I want to say 1500 to you and 2500 to laura larmer
[1:14:59.020 --> 1:15:04.140]  So so make sure we get your contact and get that money to you because we're going to take leftist globalist lies
[1:15:04.540 --> 1:15:07.980]  And through alchemy make it true. You weren't paid activist
[1:15:07.980 --> 1:15:13.660]  But to represent and to celebrate and to like give you a trophy because you actually did something
[1:15:14.060 --> 1:15:18.700]  You know to highlight what you've done to honor it. We're going to make sure you guys get that money. So great job
[1:15:19.340 --> 1:15:22.140]  Well, I appreciate that. I said, thank you very much from the bottom of my heart
[1:15:22.140 --> 1:15:26.220]  You know when I was in the navy they used to tell you they I used to come to my my senior chief with a
[1:15:26.220 --> 1:15:29.420]  With a problem or something and he said great problem. What are you going to do about it?
[1:15:29.660 --> 1:15:32.220]  Don't just call it the problem actually do something about it
[1:15:32.220 --> 1:15:35.980]  And that's what I learned in my military service and that's kind of the way I look at these situations today
[1:15:36.060 --> 1:15:39.500]  So I want to sponsor then I I can't be in dc next week
[1:15:40.060 --> 1:15:44.940]  Um 225th, I don't think but can I sponsor that event you're having to go against political violence?
[1:15:44.940 --> 1:15:48.300]  Just yeah, absolutely because you know, we want to do we're going to need security
[1:15:48.380 --> 1:15:52.460]  We're going to need uh, you know water hydration. We know antifa is going to try to attack it
[1:15:52.460 --> 1:15:57.660]  So we're definitely going to need some support. I would really appreciate that mic. Okay. Yeah, absolutely and expanding on that
[1:15:57.820 --> 1:15:59.500]  Again, if you just tuned in
[1:15:59.500 --> 1:16:01.820]  I've got paul watson tweeting it. We're tweeting it
[1:16:02.300 --> 1:16:03.100]  um
[1:16:03.100 --> 1:16:05.900]  One video we put out a million views in a day and then it just stopped
[1:16:06.380 --> 1:16:10.940]  Your videos got through the barbed wire and have had like almost 10 million this week exposing meg and kelly
[1:16:10.940 --> 1:16:15.900]  So that's great all together. We've already had more viewers just on our youtube and facebook channels on videos
[1:16:15.980 --> 1:16:20.060]  Then she'll have tonight. She was falling apart. She was failing. She had no ratings
[1:16:20.060 --> 1:16:22.060]  Uh, this will give her some support
[1:16:22.380 --> 1:16:27.420]  But I think overall folks are calling in a route of meg and kelly because she was caught on tape with me lying
[1:16:27.660 --> 1:16:31.420]  And saying it wasn't a hit piece now. She promises it'll be the worst hit piece ever
[1:16:31.900 --> 1:16:33.900]  Uh, what do you make of this jack posovic?
[1:16:34.860 --> 1:16:38.380]  Yeah, with meg and kelly coming out. I mean, this was one of her first big interviews
[1:16:38.460 --> 1:16:41.580]  Honestly, I think it was a little bit bigger than her or vladimir putin interview
[1:16:41.900 --> 1:16:44.700]  Uh, because it was more noteworthy to the american audience
[1:16:44.700 --> 1:16:49.260]  But for her to fall flat on her face like this and not get the kind of ratings that she would need
[1:16:49.260 --> 1:16:53.900]  This is a bad move for nbc and sources that I've talked to in the newsroom at mbc said, you know
[1:16:53.900 --> 1:16:58.940]  We're not paying her 15 million dollars for this kind of controversy. We're not playing her for gachi games
[1:16:59.100 --> 1:17:02.540]  Look at oliver stone the way that he conducted interviews over the course of two years
[1:17:05.580 --> 1:17:08.780]  Yeah, so actually i'm glad that you mentioned it you maybe have the same sources
[1:17:08.860 --> 1:17:11.660]  But this is breaking news that hasn't been made public yet
[1:17:12.140 --> 1:17:18.220]  NBC is actually in talks with rufa murdoch's son to bring meg and kelly back on and the sons are actually talking about
[1:17:18.220 --> 1:17:25.500]  Buying out meg and kelly's contract because she's been such a flop for nbc like breaking kelly may be out at nbc
[1:17:25.900 --> 1:17:30.940]  Yeah, their their nbc has reached out to the murdoch brothers. This is nbc sources. Yeah, yeah official
[1:17:31.180 --> 1:17:34.380]  I can't say which network but official media sources with personal knowledge
[1:17:34.860 --> 1:17:37.420]  Have by the way, everybody knows you don't make up your sources
[1:17:37.980 --> 1:17:40.380]  I can't even give my info on this because
[1:17:41.100 --> 1:17:43.100]  It would give up the sources, but
[1:17:43.580 --> 1:17:45.580]  Well, I just can't say anything
[1:17:45.580 --> 1:17:51.820]  Yeah, I just I just I'm so here's everywhere. We'll be right back with jack for so big. I'm alex jones mike sternovich
[1:17:52.380 --> 1:17:55.260]  Stay with us a lot coming up. We're 45 minutes off from the interview
[1:17:55.260 --> 1:18:20.540]  We now take you live to the central texas command center in the heart of the resistance. It's alex jones
[1:18:25.260 --> 1:18:27.260]  Oh
[1:18:37.980 --> 1:18:42.700]  Jack the suffix our guests we got another guest coming in here the man that launched one of the more successful
[1:18:43.260 --> 1:18:47.180]  Alternative social media platforms gab so that's coming up
[1:18:48.140 --> 1:18:52.380]  Also intend to open the phones up after the meg and kelly interview. Will it be at the start of the show?
[1:18:52.380 --> 1:18:54.380]  Or will it be in the middle of the end jack?
[1:18:54.380 --> 1:19:00.140]  Uh, pusubic maybe has his own ideas. Why is this so big because in the last two and a half weeks
[1:19:00.300 --> 1:19:07.500]  This has been as big as comey or as big as anything else. I mean, this is one of the top stories top trending every day
[1:19:08.060 --> 1:19:11.420]  Uh, so you can argue it's the top story the last two weeks jack pusubic
[1:19:11.500 --> 1:19:15.420]  What do you think they've been betting on because again, it's not even about the interview coming up
[1:19:15.500 --> 1:19:20.540]  It was about lying about what I stand for as a way to demonize new media overall
[1:19:20.540 --> 1:19:25.820]  This is the dinosaur media. I believe showing how desperate they are again jack pusubic. It was there covering
[1:19:26.300 --> 1:19:29.500]  Uh, the live event with laura larmer who did a great job. We're gonna get her on soon
[1:19:30.060 --> 1:19:35.980]  Uh, confronting the democrats as they do the shakespeare in the park simulated murder of trump. Where is all this going?
[1:19:36.860 --> 1:19:38.860]  Yeah, alex and I just want to let you know that I uh
[1:19:39.500 --> 1:19:43.740]  Actually spoke with laura over the break. She texted me. She said she's very excited to come on very soon and talk
[1:19:44.060 --> 1:19:49.900]  Uh, where this is going alex is you're seeing the death throes of the old media the dinosaur media
[1:19:49.900 --> 1:19:55.260]  This sort of you know media party that's been in collusion with the democrats. They're in their death throes
[1:19:55.340 --> 1:19:59.100]  They're losing their numbers. They're they're firing people. They're laying off people left and right
[1:19:59.100 --> 1:20:06.140]  They're being gobbled up by these massive corporations and they're seeing new platforms like info wars are now getting more viewers
[1:20:06.220 --> 1:20:11.100]  More viewership having more impact and more reach and they're realizing that their influence is waning
[1:20:11.260 --> 1:20:13.340]  So because it's waning they're like a wounded animal
[1:20:13.340 --> 1:20:19.660]  They're being backed into a corner and they're getting more and more desperate and more and more feral to keep a hold of the
[1:20:20.060 --> 1:20:25.980]  The one group that they have left and that's these very very indoctrinated almost like a cult figure if you will
[1:20:26.380 --> 1:20:31.500]  Uh, these these groups on the left and that's why they're buying these conspiracy theories like russia and everything else
[1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:35.260]  That have been perpetuated by meghan kelly as well as so many others in the mainstream media
[1:20:35.500 --> 1:20:41.660]  They're they know that most of america doesn't believe them. They're just trying desperately to claim to their final
[1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:46.940]  Exactly and we now know we've got the intel that facebook twitter all of it is throttling back our tweets
[1:20:47.180 --> 1:20:49.740]  Just like all the positive tweets can't get to trump anymore
[1:20:50.380 --> 1:20:55.660]  He knows to go deep down to actually have communication with us. This is how they make us feel small how they make us
[1:20:56.460 --> 1:21:00.540]  Feel pathetic, you know, you know how they get in our face and even how they set us up
[1:21:00.860 --> 1:21:07.020]  Because one time I was at a pro gun rally in san Antonio and this old guy didn't even know sort of bump it into me and get in my face
[1:21:07.020 --> 1:21:12.220]  And he kept doing it and then following down the street. So then I did it later and then supposedly reportedly
[1:21:12.220 --> 1:21:14.940]  He lost some family member in some shooting in another part of the country
[1:21:15.500 --> 1:21:20.620]  And they're like, oh look, he knew this guy was a father somebody killed by a gun. No, they were we have the raw video
[1:21:20.620 --> 1:21:23.100]  He was like in my face threatening his wife
[1:21:23.420 --> 1:21:28.540]  Actually slapped his wife in the hand in front of us and was so pissed off. I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa
[1:21:28.700 --> 1:21:33.260]  But again, that's how they spin it and that's how you got to really watch out folks with these psyops
[1:21:33.260 --> 1:21:38.540]  Yeah, so that is definitely we're hearing that there are now bot accounts on twitter
[1:21:39.020 --> 1:21:42.220]  Trying to lie and discredit you right now. So I just got that information. So
[1:21:42.780 --> 1:21:46.060]  There's now a ton of so our this is a full on info war
[1:21:46.300 --> 1:21:48.300]  Right, that's why you got to post the hashtag
[1:21:48.780 --> 1:21:53.180]  Jones v twitter share the links if we keep pushing we'll break through the algorithm
[1:21:53.180 --> 1:21:57.260]  There are bots being hired right now on twitter and they keep telling me
[1:21:57.580 --> 1:22:02.620]  Yeah, so all the twitter now the bottom line is just is just go to info wars.com forward slash show
[1:22:02.620 --> 1:22:07.580]  So spread our periscope spread our youtube spread our facebook video, but the stations are all over the country
[1:22:07.580 --> 1:22:11.500]  It's really about demonizing me going out for my sponsors, but I'm self funded now
[1:22:11.820 --> 1:22:15.660]  We're growing in the face of this check the subject in closing and then Mike sort of it
[1:22:15.660 --> 1:22:18.700]  What do you think they are going to do as all this fails?
[1:22:20.060 --> 1:22:24.860]  Well, what they're going to do is become increasingly increasingly more uh stepped up in their attacks
[1:22:24.940 --> 1:22:29.500]  They're going to be finding a way to get to us. They're going to be hiring people. They're going to be coming to our events
[1:22:29.500 --> 1:22:32.700]  They're going to lie to us. They're trying to going to try to infiltrate our events
[1:22:33.420 --> 1:22:35.420]  Our background
[1:22:35.580 --> 1:22:40.780]  That's what they they're going to do anything they can plan evidence false flags. You name it anything they can do to take us out
[1:22:41.260 --> 1:22:43.260]  That's right. They were popping in
[1:22:43.820 --> 1:22:45.180]  Your ear mic
[1:22:45.180 --> 1:22:47.180]  Let's give people slowly the right
[1:22:47.180 --> 1:22:49.180]  Hashtag to put out on twitter
[1:22:49.180 --> 1:22:51.180]  The hashtag is jones v kelly
[1:22:51.660 --> 1:22:53.660]  Just like a fight just like mcconnor
[1:22:53.660 --> 1:23:00.780]  I'm a gregar versus floyd mayweather jones jones v kelly is the hashtag of the day get it trending keep posting the links to the
[1:23:00.860 --> 1:23:06.940]  Periscopes the videos everything coming out. This is a war right now all the big sort of money right now the bloomberg money
[1:23:06.940 --> 1:23:12.700]  Admittedly is financing and you know using people who've been hurt in this country to go after our free speech
[1:23:12.780 --> 1:23:14.140]  This is their attempt
[1:23:14.140 --> 1:23:18.700]  Uh, so listen jack the subject great job and again, I really appreciate the work you've done
[1:23:18.700 --> 1:23:22.940]  I look forward to uh, they said you were a paid activist you weren't but I'm but you deserve an award
[1:23:22.940 --> 1:23:28.380]  Uh for what you and laura larmer did so we'll talk soon and you wait before you go real quick june 25th
[1:23:28.620 --> 1:23:31.900]  You is that what you said tell us more about you june 25th?
[1:23:31.900 --> 1:23:35.580]  We're still getting the permit, but it looks like it'll be june 25th at noon right in front of the white house
[1:23:35.740 --> 1:23:38.460]  All right. Good. Thanks. Thank you now. I want to come back
[1:23:39.340 --> 1:23:42.300]  And bring our other guests in here and talk about where he sees this going
[1:23:42.780 --> 1:23:47.900]  How we're forced to go create our own new platforms because facebook and twitter and others are admittedly so
[1:23:47.900 --> 1:23:52.700]  So censored now and and where is all this going and how we countered? I've also got a bunch of clips
[1:23:53.100 --> 1:23:54.940]  That I haven't gotten to yet
[1:23:54.940 --> 1:23:58.220]  Where we have fox news compares me to murders and rapists
[1:23:58.700 --> 1:24:02.060]  What'd be goldberg lies about what I've said and dan rather dug up from the grave
[1:24:02.780 --> 1:24:04.140]  um
[1:24:04.140 --> 1:24:07.740]  Of course they put dan rather there. It's it's it's it's actually uh tom brokaw
[1:24:08.140 --> 1:24:11.100]  Uh, you know you're saying just the most outrageous
[1:24:11.580 --> 1:24:13.580]  Things against us
[1:24:13.580 --> 1:24:21.020]  Why are they so scared because they're losing their viewers. They're losing their trust. They're losing the ratings and they think it's our fault
[1:24:21.020 --> 1:24:27.500]  No, it's that you're so discredited. You're so disliked now. We're like 35 minutes out from when they could be airing the the
[1:24:28.540 --> 1:24:34.220]  Vaunted 11 minute highly edited interview where meg and kelly got caught lying but going back to that briefly
[1:24:34.620 --> 1:24:37.820]  How much does this hurt meg and kelly because I don't want to hurt her personally
[1:24:38.060 --> 1:24:42.220]  She hurt herself saying I promise it's going to be a softball. I promise it's not going to be a hit piece
[1:24:42.220 --> 1:24:46.540]  I promise I'm not getting into these topics and uh, she's been she's been caught
[1:24:47.420 --> 1:24:51.900]  Doing all of that. What does that do to her now from your sources?
[1:24:52.380 --> 1:24:54.780]  That they're actually in talks to bring her back to fox
[1:24:55.180 --> 1:25:01.580]  Right. So the nbc is now trying to get the murdoch brothers to do a contract buyout the or the sons of rupert murdoch
[1:25:01.660 --> 1:25:07.100]  These are the ones that they're beta males. They're married to these liberal women who are you know, that that's why they had to get rid of
[1:25:07.100 --> 1:25:09.580]  Bill O'ryland and they're trying to get rid of Hannity and anybody who's
[1:25:09.580 --> 1:25:14.220]  Remotely not viewed as a part of the cocktail party set. So nbc
[1:25:14.860 --> 1:25:20.380]  Realizes that meg and kelly does not have major league talent. She is no barba walters. She isn't interesting
[1:25:20.380 --> 1:25:22.380]  She doesn't read books. She doesn't study history
[1:25:22.780 --> 1:25:30.220]  They're trying to get rid of her and the murdoch sons are so beta eyes that they're willing to potentially buy out
[1:25:30.620 --> 1:25:33.100]  meg and kelly's contract to bring her back onto fox news
[1:25:33.740 --> 1:25:37.660]  Because they thought hey, you know, she already tried to bring on fox news. She worked for us. Well
[1:25:37.660 --> 1:25:42.140]  She helped, you know a change your story about ailes. He's he's out of the way now
[1:25:42.700 --> 1:25:49.980]  And but but but fox is now seeking into the mud. They're in total panic mode. They're thinking maybe maybe she'll work better with this audience
[1:25:50.300 --> 1:25:56.220]  Right. So fox they're actually they went from number one all the time their ratings have actually been falling and they're not number one anymore
[1:25:56.220 --> 1:26:01.900]  The first time in 20 years, right? So they're they're not number one anymore. So they're they want a lifeline. Oh, that was other fake news
[1:26:02.300 --> 1:26:06.060]  Whenever I said back in july, there's a coup against father fox. They're gonna remove everybody
[1:26:06.060 --> 1:26:08.060]  It's now on and now they're destroyed
[1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:12.700]  Well, and that's the thing about having sources nobody else has people go that's fake
[1:26:12.860 --> 1:26:14.860]  But then when you get it right they don't go
[1:26:15.100 --> 1:26:20.940]  I was at the rnc meeting with people to rich carlton exactly. I was talking to I mean I was meeting with the executives
[1:26:21.500 --> 1:26:24.620]  Yeah, hell. I mean roger else where he died was calling me want to watch a network
[1:26:24.860 --> 1:26:29.740]  That that's actually people don't know they want to do a new tv network roger else. Yeah, I don't think that's public yet though
[1:26:29.740 --> 1:26:37.740]  Well, well, whatever. Yeah, and that's why they're so pissed. They got all the phones tapped. They know what's going on. Don't worry. We don't need roger else to launch this
[1:26:38.060 --> 1:26:40.060]  We'll be back poor roger though. We'll be back
[1:26:40.060 --> 1:26:54.700]  Live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:26:54.700 --> 1:26:59.580]  Well, michael malis is one of the top writers in the country. He's huge. I mean, I've read a couple of his books
[1:26:59.580 --> 1:27:04.620]  I know he ghost writes a ton of the other top books in the country. He's riding the shotgun with us for 30 minutes
[1:27:05.340 --> 1:27:11.260]  He also is the guy that got in and got the unauthorized autobiography of kim jong-un in north korea. It takes a lot of courage to do that
[1:27:11.660 --> 1:27:13.660]  michael malis.com
[1:27:13.660 --> 1:27:15.660]  I'm not sure if you've heard of it
[1:27:15.660 --> 1:27:17.660]  I'm not sure if you've heard of it
[1:27:17.660 --> 1:27:19.660]  I'm not sure if you've heard of it
[1:27:19.660 --> 1:27:21.660]  I'm not sure if you've heard of it
[1:27:21.660 --> 1:27:24.780]  but let's have a look at
[1:27:24.780 --> 1:27:26.780]  michael malis.com
[1:27:34.780 --> 1:27:37.680]  But I've seen this guy onまo watson. I know about his big website gabb and country
[1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:41.680]  He's the founder and co-founder and CEO of gab which is an alternative platform
[1:27:41.680 --> 1:27:46.040]  So what I thought would be cool with having michael malis here in torby
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:50.320]  Ultimately we're telling you that the media right now is in a tizzy
[1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:56.000]  because they're so NBC is giving Alex Jones a platform as if you need a platform as if
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:02.240]  they control gets a platform that said they do want to get us removed from all these platforms.
[1:28:02.240 --> 1:28:05.760]  So although we're because we're dominating 200 million views right now a month from me
[1:28:05.760 --> 1:28:09.320]  on Twitter, they're eventually going to have to say, okay, we have to know platform. You
[1:28:09.320 --> 1:28:14.640]  just said you just had five videos this week that had like nine million viewers and you're
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:18.760]  just exponent. It's crazy. Right. So they're going to try to get us banned. And that's
[1:28:18.760 --> 1:28:22.760]  why it's important to have alternative platforms and he'd created gab, which does that really
[1:28:22.760 --> 1:28:28.040]  they just don't want choices. So I'll be honest though, I've never seen such a media hype
[1:28:28.040 --> 1:28:32.080]  around an interview. I mean, I do have somewhat of a pucker factor. Everybody's saying it
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:35.160]  blew up in her face because she got caught lying to me on tape. We've got these other
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:38.640]  tapes of what the interview happened, but the way they edited it, I'm, I don't want
[1:28:38.640 --> 1:28:42.240]  to say I'm scared, but I do have some butterflies. What do you guys think's going to happen tonight?
[1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:45.040]  And let's just get into the whole state of the world and wherever you want to go free
[1:28:45.040 --> 1:28:51.200]  for all. Go for a mic. You asking me? Yeah, I mean, where do you think this is all going?
[1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:54.880]  Why do you think the Megan Kelly thing so big? Why is the left so frothing calling for
[1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:59.720]  violence? That's like a twilight zone. Because for decades, they had a complete monopoly
[1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:05.200]  on the mechanisms of communication. So people like you and even people who are more mainstream
[1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:08.800]  than you, you would never even hear about that. You had three channels and those three
[1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:12.720]  channels had three anchors and each of those anchors was a slightly different version of
[1:29:12.720 --> 1:29:16.480]  progressivism. And then you had the appearance that there's a three people to choice to choose
[1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:21.520]  from, but this is a Hobson's choice. Now you have, there's ever since the 80s with talk
[1:29:21.520 --> 1:29:26.880]  radio, you can't shut up these other points of view. And that's why they're so hysterical
[1:29:26.880 --> 1:29:31.200]  because you should be neither seen nor heard. And Alex, I think we're seeing the same thing
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:35.600]  online as well with technology platforms where you have this illusion of choice. You have
[1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:41.760]  Facebook, Twitter, a Snapchat, Instagram and WhatsApp are both owned by Facebook. So you
[1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:45.960]  look at the top 20 apps on the app store and 25% of them are owned by Facebook and you
[1:29:45.960 --> 1:29:49.400]  have this illusion of choice. But the reality is, is they're all owned by the same company
[1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:53.160]  and they're all controlled by the same three or four people in Silicon Valley and YouTube
[1:29:53.160 --> 1:29:56.560]  controlled now what they let on the front page, Google, yep, and owned by Google as
[1:29:56.560 --> 1:30:00.720]  well. So you have three or four people in Silicon Valley that control and I know as
[1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:04.200]  a tech guy, you know, this, the public does, but it's getting worse. It's, it's, it's
[1:30:04.200 --> 1:30:09.480]  intensifying. Where does this end? Where does this, where does this fight end up going?
[1:30:09.480 --> 1:30:13.200]  I think we're going in a great direction, honestly, because for decades, you had complete
[1:30:13.200 --> 1:30:17.680]  trust in the media. You remember like back in the 40s and 50s, people would trust Chesterfield
[1:30:17.680 --> 1:30:21.080]  cigarettes because those are going to be great for you. And now people don't trust any cigarette
[1:30:21.080 --> 1:30:24.280]  company. They know what they're selling, the product. And the same thing used to be with
[1:30:24.280 --> 1:30:28.760]  Anita, you would trust CBS, you would trust ABC, you would trust NBC. And now their trust
[1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:32.200]  approval ratings even below Congress, because people know they're peddling a bunch of crap.
[1:30:32.200 --> 1:30:35.720]  And they want to misrepresent what I've said or anybody else has said or take a few flowery
[1:30:35.720 --> 1:30:40.760]  clips together, mix it up to then make themselves look better. Even if they're successful at
[1:30:40.760 --> 1:30:45.280]  destroying me, which I don't think they are, we're only getting bigger. They've destroyed
[1:30:45.280 --> 1:30:46.440]  themselves. Sorry, go ahead.
[1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:51.280]  And to give the message that you shouldn't bother listening to this person. He has nothing
[1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:55.280]  of interest to say. Now think about it. They claim they want honest debate. They can easily
[1:30:55.280 --> 1:30:58.800]  have you come forward and say, this guy's saying X, Y and Z and he's wrong, but they
[1:30:58.800 --> 1:31:02.920]  don't want that. They want you to be preemptively discredited so that anything you have to say,
[1:31:02.920 --> 1:31:07.520]  they won't have to deal with. I mean, you're all smart guys. So seriously,
[1:31:07.520 --> 1:31:10.480]  I feel like I'm kind of here on the execution doc. I hope this goes well. I mean, it's
[1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:15.360]  going to be horrible because they spent weeks editing it. What are they thinking? Because
[1:31:15.360 --> 1:31:19.120]  you could just see the train wreck here. That's what's scary to me is the people running the
[1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:22.480]  country who are trying to stop Trump from actually turning the economy back on. They
[1:31:22.480 --> 1:31:28.560]  seem to be totally out of control. Yeah, I think what we're going to see now is a big
[1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:33.160]  push on social media. Mike talked about bots in the last segment. They're going to get
[1:31:33.160 --> 1:31:37.760]  all of their mainstream big players because they dominate and they dominate the message
[1:31:37.760 --> 1:31:42.560]  on Twitter. They dominate the message on Facebook. They control, you know, we look at last May
[1:31:42.560 --> 1:31:47.280]  to 2016 where they started manipulating the trending topics product to remove conservative
[1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:52.240]  news sources, topics and ideas from that product that's used by over a billion people every
[1:31:52.240 --> 1:31:56.520]  single month. So they're going to try to force their agenda down our throats and it's up
[1:31:56.520 --> 1:32:03.520]  to us to fight back. And that always tends to backfire. But it's so brazen and even their
[1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:10.600]  minions low level are so full of hate. I mean, they really, I guess, were existentially
[1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:16.040]  living through Hillary and through Nancy Pelosi. And now they don't think they're in power.
[1:32:16.040 --> 1:32:18.600]  So they're all upset. Where does this go then? I mean, keep going back to that. Where does
[1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:24.320]  it go? So I think that, you know, they're going to continue to push this, especially
[1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:27.920]  in the technology space, they're going to continue to push the censorship agenda. They
[1:32:27.920 --> 1:32:32.480]  are not going to let another 2016 happen again. Come 2020, I think we're going to start to
[1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:36.120]  see more folks on the right, more conservatives, more people on the new right, whatever you
[1:32:36.120 --> 1:32:38.800]  want to call it, they're going to start getting banned. They're going to start getting shut
[1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:43.760]  up. They're going to come up with new technology mechanisms and guys it as safety. And you
[1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:48.280]  know, we want to prevent quote unquote harassment and hate speech, whatever that is, that is
[1:32:48.280 --> 1:32:50.680]  their agenda and you continue pushing down that path.
[1:32:50.680 --> 1:32:55.200]  I want to know how we fight that. But Michael Malis, this sounds like a Streisand effect
[1:32:55.200 --> 1:32:59.640]  bigger than the universe. I mean, just my gut level, won't this backfire? This isn't
[1:32:59.640 --> 1:33:03.360]  old Russia or Cuba or Venezuela. I don't see them once we've had internet freedom
[1:33:03.360 --> 1:33:06.080]  so long getting away with Chinese style net censorship.
[1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:10.760]  It has already started backfire. You remember during the primaries, Ted Cruz derated the
[1:33:10.760 --> 1:33:16.080]  moderators who were supposed to be objective and honest and the audience applauded them.
[1:33:16.080 --> 1:33:20.400]  So these are things that could have never happened in 2012 or 2008 where the press was
[1:33:20.400 --> 1:33:25.360]  perceived as honest arbiters of debate. Now everyone knows that they have an agenda and
[1:33:25.360 --> 1:33:28.480]  that's the way the country was founded. When we were founded, you had the federalist papers
[1:33:28.480 --> 1:33:32.440]  and you had the Democratic Republican papers and they picked sides and it was very clear
[1:33:32.440 --> 1:33:37.680]  people were partisan. That was fine. Now it's the kind of noblesse oblige, this perception
[1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:41.160]  that they're all, you know, all honest, decent people. But at the same time, you could see
[1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:44.960]  things like the journalist thing, when you had a group of them conspiring to how to spread
[1:33:44.960 --> 1:33:45.960]  a story together.
[1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:50.520]  And I think that's it. Before MSN was controlled, they lied some, but they were scared of getting
[1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:55.200]  caught by the public and by their colleagues. Now there's like a unified race to the finish
[1:33:55.200 --> 1:34:00.520]  line. I mean, let's take this clip here from Tom Brokaw, where no one who's real has ever
[1:34:00.520 --> 1:34:04.480]  said I said something racist. The racist white supremacist, everybody actually hate me. The
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:07.920]  black supremacist, they hate me because I want unity. But there's this thing, don't
[1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:12.920]  like Obamacare, you're a racist. But to see even Tom Brokaw taken out of the Crip Keepers
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:17.760]  area rolled out to say, I'm an unalloyed. That means complete total racism. You don't
[1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:22.080]  know what unalloyed means. I did not look it up. And I'm quite a, you know, I've got
[1:34:22.080 --> 1:34:25.920]  a big lexicon. What does this signify? Here's the clip.
[1:34:25.920 --> 1:34:31.960]  The whole game is to let me play gotcha. Let me, let me show you how me or I can be. There's
[1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:36.720]  a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Shone, for example. But the fact is that
[1:34:36.720 --> 1:34:42.200]  he is an unalloyed racist, a man whose outs are pulling the pen on the grenade every day.
[1:34:42.200 --> 1:34:49.160]  And he has 6 million viewers who are paying attention to him. And the parents at Newtown
[1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:53.240]  are saying they're hearing from his followers all the time. They buy into what he is saying.
[1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:57.600]  The public didn't buy it. I'm not the progenitor of it. And then they point at people not buying
[1:34:57.600 --> 1:35:03.840]  media as if the problem, but, but Tom Brokaw says, watch how mean I can be. He knows he's
[1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:09.400]  making it up and he shows off with his big pretty lie, the most original thing since
[1:35:09.400 --> 1:35:16.240]  it's anything that I'm a racist. But to them, the definition of a racist is simply someone
[1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:20.120]  who's winning and arguing with the progressive. Racism just means being against progressivism
[1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:23.720]  because for being progressive, race is the most important thing. So if you think of
[1:35:23.720 --> 1:35:27.520]  it as the fifth most important thing, by definition, you're not thinking of it as important as
[1:35:27.520 --> 1:35:32.320]  you should, and therefore you're racist. It's a term that just basically means heretic,
[1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:36.200]  and it can be just dismissed with. And it's really a shame because racism is a problem
[1:35:36.200 --> 1:35:39.360]  and people should be concerned about it. But when you toss it around for someone who's
[1:35:39.360 --> 1:35:44.680]  against Obamacare or, or, you know, things like wars, it becomes absolutely meaningless.
[1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:46.840]  Just like the word rape, it has a very real meaning.
[1:35:46.840 --> 1:35:48.880]  Have they done real racist a favor?
[1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:54.840]  Yeah, they get in the hoaxes that the hate crime hoaxes that they do to divide the people.
[1:35:54.840 --> 1:35:58.480]  That's what they are doing now with their hoaxes and the media amplifying the hoaxes
[1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:03.480]  are they're actually trying to encourage copycat attackers to do these things as a
[1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:07.760]  scythe, actually, because there's a psychological principle which says people are going to copy
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:12.920]  which they see often enough. So they're doing hoaxes to try to incite actual violence against
[1:36:12.920 --> 1:36:16.240]  minorities. That is coming from the media, not from us.
[1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:20.040]  And they're also hyping kill, kill, kill. I want to ask all of you when we come back.
[1:36:20.040 --> 1:36:24.920]  Obviously, the summer is here. They are really priming things. Soros is increasing it. How
[1:36:24.920 --> 1:36:36.600]  will civil unrest help the socialist, globalist movement? We'll talk about it straight ahead.
[1:36:36.600 --> 1:36:43.680]  Discover trends and global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex
[1:36:43.680 --> 1:36:59.440]  Jones show. All right, we're just about 13 minutes away from
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:04.760]  Dateline NBC, which has this whole, oh, they kind of baited the new media that's much bigger
[1:37:04.760 --> 1:37:08.920]  than them and the aggregate, much bigger than all mainstream media combined into them lying
[1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:13.200]  about us to get us covering. And sure, they've gotten stung. They've gotten some problems.
[1:37:13.200 --> 1:37:18.320]  Yeah, Megan's all freaked out. Sure, even mainstream media says it's a disaster, but
[1:37:18.320 --> 1:37:23.080]  we'll actually see. It's going to be horribly edited. They were here for more than 12 hours.
[1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:27.920]  I walked into their trap just to see what they would do, but they also walked into mine.
[1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:34.160]  But again, it doesn't show how strong we are. It shows how weak they are. Do any of you disagree
[1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:39.080]  with that? Michael Malis, getting back to the big question after you comment on that.
[1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:45.800]  Just the shrill authoritarian calls for violence, the hatefulness, the ridiculousness of the
[1:37:45.800 --> 1:37:51.520]  petulance of the left and all of their hate. I mean, Trump hasn't done anything to them
[1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:55.920]  and they act like they're dying. So this just really shows how susceptible they are to media.
[1:37:55.920 --> 1:38:00.360]  But what do you expect to come this summer? They are dying. They're losing their grip
[1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:04.440]  on power. And this is freaking them out before they used to snap their fingers and people
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:07.920]  would do what they wanted and fall in line. Now they snap their fingers and people laugh
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:11.360]  or give them the finger. And this is going to freak them out because one of the big selling
[1:38:11.360 --> 1:38:16.200]  points of the left is that if you join our club, you're going to be part of the master
[1:38:16.200 --> 1:38:20.880]  class. And now that they're in the minority in media and in politics, they have much less
[1:38:20.880 --> 1:38:25.200]  to offer in terms of salesmanship. Well, and that's going to tell you just as total genius.
[1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:29.360]  That'll be the start of the whole show because it is like an elite class. They claim they're
[1:38:29.360 --> 1:38:33.040]  more educated. They claim they're more informed. Even though most of them are poorer than the
[1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:37.760]  average person, it's a feeling of nobility of title. And they're mad because they're
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:42.920]  losing their title to the evil Midwestern hillbillies they have nightmares about. But
[1:38:42.920 --> 1:38:47.000]  they love jihadis. They love anything but the evil Americans. Sorry, Michael, go ahead.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:52.040]  No, their whole mission in life is to let in the outsiders and all the past, you know,
[1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:55.640]  Jim Go talks about this, all the past contempt they had for black Americans has gone towards
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:38:59.560]  four whites and the same stereotypes they just transferred. And the only way they know
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:02.640]  how to feel good about themselves is by looking down at someone else. Now that doesn't sound
[1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:05.720]  psychologically healthy, but it's certainly psychologically common.
[1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:10.480]  Oh, I've never heard any racism from Republicans growing up seeing Democrats. I mean, it is
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:15.240]  just amazing. And the whole point is they've just moved it into a whole new era and tried
[1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:18.760]  to get all the minorities hyped up with it. But I don't think people are buying it. And
[1:39:18.760 --> 1:39:22.760]  I think, I mean, we've seen fake polls, but clearly there's fake polls against Trump right
[1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:25.360]  now. And despite that, he's at 50%.
[1:39:25.360 --> 1:39:29.360]  Yeah, which is again, the message isn't working. I mean, you know, Malice works, you know,
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:33.840]  a lot in publishing. And what I noticed a lot is all the sneering from the fake news
[1:39:33.840 --> 1:39:37.680]  people go, Oh, sir, if you self publish your book. And I thought, well, yeah, I sell more
[1:39:37.680 --> 1:39:41.920]  than you people, but they actually control publishing. So where, where a friend of mine
[1:39:41.920 --> 1:39:45.280]  actually is a New York Times bestselling author said, Oh, you know, I actually went to them
[1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:49.200]  with the book proposal. I told them they should hire you and they all laughed. And they said,
[1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:52.760]  you know, we would never want anything like that on our label. And they even delisted
[1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:56.240]  Milo. So if you're too controversial, you're even kept out of public.
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:00.480]  They killed his book that was number one on Amazon for months. And again, I know people
[1:40:00.480 --> 1:40:04.600]  that have sold millions and millions of dollars of books currently with big publishers, they
[1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:09.960]  don't even hardly pay you ever. It's smart when you can market yourself to self publish.
[1:40:09.960 --> 1:40:13.560]  If you can sell hundreds of thousands of books like you've done and then keep 90% of the money
[1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:17.920]  instead of getting a dollar on each book, wow, you get $10 or $20. I mean, oh, wow,
[1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:22.760]  you're dumb. You're dumb. You're on your own successful. What the hell's your problem?
[1:40:22.760 --> 1:40:28.960]  Well, sorry to stop the rant, but I my North Korea book, your reader, I did it on Kickstarter.
[1:40:28.960 --> 1:40:32.000]  And because I'm an established author, the stigma wasn't there. It would have been there
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:36.240]  20 years ago if you're self publishing. But now as bookstores are closing, there's an
[1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:39.360]  awareness that independent authors who are doing innovative things.
[1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:42.040]  Now I'm not going to, I'm not going to read your dear reader, which I have read that's
[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:47.680]  excellent and groundbreaking because, because, because you self did it and it's there and
[1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:52.280]  it's just, it's horrible. I just, I only want someone that has said everything done
[1:40:52.280 --> 1:40:53.280]  for them.
[1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:57.120]  Well, if you look at like what you guys have built with Info Wars from nothing and what
[1:40:57.120 --> 1:41:00.640]  we've built a gab with nothing, we didn't take, you know, millions of dollars from venture
[1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:01.640]  capital.
[1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:02.640]  Tell folks about gab. It's big.
[1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:07.920]  Yeah. So gab is a free speech social network. We won't censor or filter things that, you
[1:41:07.920 --> 1:41:14.000]  know, we as a company deem, I guess, hate speech or harassment or all of these other
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:18.880]  things that, you know, big social is guising as needing to be censored and needing to be
[1:41:18.880 --> 1:41:23.480]  shut up. So we're completely bootstrapped. We're completely supported by donations from
[1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:28.120]  our community and by our pros subscribers. So, you know, we don't need the establishment
[1:41:28.120 --> 1:41:32.880]  players. What we have done is sideline them, you know, and that wouldn't have been possible
[1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:36.120]  10 years ago. What we're doing today wouldn't have been possible. Now we have things like
[1:41:36.120 --> 1:41:41.120]  crowdfunding platforms, self publishing platforms. You can start up a blog in five minutes. Everybody
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:43.280]  can have a voice and they don't like that.
[1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:49.680]  Well, mainstream media is always relish killing. He's an internet TV radio host. When are they
[1:41:49.680 --> 1:41:53.600]  going to go? He was on access. Well, no, before that, I was in diapers. I mean, yeah, when
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:57.040]  I was 21, I went and did access TV because the normal RTF route would take too long.
[1:41:57.040 --> 1:42:01.200]  And within six months, I had a local show. Within a year, I had a syndicated show and
[1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:07.480]  so I'm on over 200 affiliates now. The media loves to downplay that number as if I don't
[1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:11.200]  have any listeners, but they've got to talk about me all day. But the truth is I started
[1:42:11.200 --> 1:42:16.240]  out in terrestrial radio. We've dominated in the free market of ideas on the internet.
[1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:20.280]  Isn't that the real sign of success that I didn't have big backing? But no, no, no.
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:24.240]  That's the side of my failure. It's like a sign of the failure of Michael Malus having
[1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:28.520]  a hit book that he saw published after being an establishment writer or being published
[1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:32.520]  by establishment or just like you've been a trailblazer. Being a trailblazer is bad now.
[1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:35.720]  Right. Exactly. And that is what the free market is all about. That's what the free
[1:42:35.720 --> 1:42:39.840]  marketplace of ideas about is the best ideas are always going to win. And when you have
[1:42:39.840 --> 1:42:45.640]  ideas that are better than others, the nature of censorship is that bad ideas cannot win.
[1:42:45.640 --> 1:42:48.960]  So they have to censor in order to shut up. They want to shut out your ideas, the marketplace.
[1:42:48.960 --> 1:42:53.760]  So the real prognosis, Michael Malus in closing. I think things are getting better and better
[1:42:53.760 --> 1:42:57.800]  and people are waking up and there's so many more opportunities for independent, smart
[1:42:57.800 --> 1:43:01.040]  people to put their message out there that it's impossible for them to put the genie
[1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:05.200]  on the bottle and that's why they're terrified. But they want a violent revolution. How bad
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:09.320]  is it to get the summer? The good guys have the guns. So I don't think
[1:43:09.320 --> 1:43:13.000]  I'm too worried about that. I escaped the Soviet Union and I'm here to stay. So that's
[1:43:13.000 --> 1:43:17.680]  how it's going to be. But she's why they're starting to do kind of a death dancer like
[1:43:17.680 --> 1:43:23.560]  a ghost dancer. Well, that's why they're trying to again, rile people up and incite violence
[1:43:23.560 --> 1:43:29.520]  and to send subconscious messages to people all the day to incite violence. But again,
[1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:32.800]  we're the ones who are against violence. We're the one who want peace. They're the ones who
[1:43:32.800 --> 1:43:35.960]  want violence, but they want to let their little Antifa terrorists and the left wing
[1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:40.560]  terrorists be the hatchet man. And then they go, Oh, no, no, no, you can't blame us. But
[1:43:40.560 --> 1:43:45.320]  then anything somebody does, they try to blame on us, which is fascinating. So the fake news
[1:43:45.320 --> 1:43:48.480]  media says, well, we're not responsible for this left wing terrorism. We're not responsible
[1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:52.840]  for Antifa. How dare you? And they call that hate for rhetoric when we blame them for what
[1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:57.600]  they have actually done and incited. But then if one guy does something and maybe like your
[1:43:57.600 --> 1:44:01.520]  Facebook page one day, they're going to call you and say, Oh, how can you have fans like
[1:44:01.520 --> 1:44:05.920]  this is your rhetoric radicalizing people. Well, Michael Malis promised to come back
[1:44:05.920 --> 1:44:10.040]  on and talk about your book that I read dealing with the dear leader of the unauthorized biography
[1:44:10.040 --> 1:44:14.240]  that's been such, you know, great reviews because of how, you know, deep and original
[1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:17.640]  one is because I want to understand why all the leftists say America is so bad, but they
[1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:21.640]  don't want to go to Venezuela or Cuba or North Korea. They want to, I mean, you don't
[1:44:21.640 --> 1:44:24.280]  see people running to go to the dear leader, do you? Unless they're Dennis Rodman.
[1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:28.520]  Oh, no, sir, you do not. And it's the worst place on earth. And it's really a shame when
[1:44:28.520 --> 1:44:33.280]  people talk about, you know, people who listen to the show understand just how bad governments
[1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:37.560]  can get. It's the worst government on earth. And as Americans, we are almost blessed to
[1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:41.680]  be naive enough that we sometimes don't get just how evil a place like North Korea can
[1:44:41.680 --> 1:44:43.800]  be. And that's why I wrote my book to explain it.
[1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:46.000]  All right. Thank you so much, sir.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:50.920]  Well, I feel like a man being led towards the firing squad just because of the unbelievable
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:55.480]  hype. It's like if you go to a play or a movie, they've hyped up a ton and you almost have
[1:44:55.480 --> 1:45:00.200]  a bad feeling is there's such hype involved. I mean, we are five minutes away from Megan
[1:45:00.200 --> 1:45:04.320]  Kelly's kicking off Dateline NBC. We're going to be able to cover it live because I'm the
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:07.880]  subject of it. They lied about what it was going to be. She's caught on tape. So I have
[1:45:07.880 --> 1:45:12.040]  a right to cover the live transmission. If you don't want to hear us interrupting and
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:17.240]  giving commentaries how I'm able to cover it, then, you know, obviously tune into NBC.
[1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:22.360]  If you still have a rabbit ears or something, we're able to get that. But you guys are welcome
[1:45:22.360 --> 1:45:26.840]  to you're right along. I'm going to have Roger Stone popping in with us. I have a stinging
[1:45:26.840 --> 1:45:31.240]  suspicion of my money's it airs at the bottom of the yard.
[1:45:31.240 --> 1:45:35.520]  Tough call. They don't have a big lead in to it. So they do want to suck people in and
[1:45:35.520 --> 1:45:39.960]  essentially use bait and switch tactics to con people to watch their car material. So
[1:45:39.960 --> 1:45:43.200]  I would put it in the middle or towards the bottom of the yard for sure because they want
[1:45:43.200 --> 1:45:46.640]  to, they want to ride the people and con the people for as long as they can.
[1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:50.400]  And the biggest thing is it'll be like he hated the family and they don't keep laying
[1:45:50.400 --> 1:45:55.200]  it on Father's Day. He wants to tell you bad things when they, when they're the, so there'll
[1:45:55.200 --> 1:45:57.280]  be lots of juicy little promos.
[1:45:57.280 --> 1:46:01.400]  Yeah, they'll keep cutting in. That's the whole point is they know that nobody wants to watch
[1:46:01.400 --> 1:46:05.680]  this trash that they do. So they're going to have to con people and say, come on in for
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:06.680]  that. It's like a US.
[1:46:06.680 --> 1:46:11.960]  As soon as the car races in, it'll be like Alex Jones raped 5000 babies and is the son
[1:46:11.960 --> 1:46:16.520]  of Satan coming up. You'll see him murder children. You know, I mean, it is just like
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:22.240]  the devil will be faced. We must ban the free speech of this man before more armed gunman
[1:46:22.240 --> 1:46:28.440]  storm innocent facilities. You will meet the devil Satan himself. Alex Jones coming online.
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:32.800]  Hope the first amendment is burned because it never exists soon as pure evil and racist
[1:46:32.800 --> 1:46:34.400]  and you heard Tom broke off.
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:39.400]  So it's all coming up straight ahead and I've done two hours and have it plugged. We're
[1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:44.280]  funded by you. Great nitrocyticals, great products, free shipping, still running an info
[1:46:44.280 --> 1:46:48.720]  war store.com. We're under attack, but most importantly, just spread the links, the articles
[1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:49.720]  and the hashtag.
[1:46:49.720 --> 1:46:50.720]  What is it?
[1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:55.720]  Jones V Kelly, J O N E S V Kelly, Jones V Kelly, hype it. I'm excited, man.
[1:46:55.720 --> 1:47:00.800]  Yeah, Facebook, Twitter, Google, let everybody know Alex Jones is about to cover Megan Kelly's
[1:47:00.800 --> 1:47:05.840]  piece live. So spread those Facebook, Twitter and Google YouTube videos right now. They're
[1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:14.040]  all an info wars.com will NBC finally pull the plug on Megan Kelly's controversial interview
[1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:23.360]  with radio personality and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for interviewing radio show host
[1:47:23.360 --> 1:47:24.360]  Alex Jones.
[1:47:24.360 --> 1:47:29.120]  He is somebody who President Trump pulled after the election to thank him for his role.
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:34.360]  Trump had gone on his radio show during the campaign. Kelly and NBC are now under fire
[1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:38.800]  for giving airtime to the radio talk show host who has called the Sandy Hook school shooting
[1:47:38.800 --> 1:47:39.800]  a hoax.
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:53.680]  Mr. Jones doesn't talk to a lot of reporters, but we're very glad you made an exception.
[1:47:53.680 --> 1:48:00.000]  When you say parents faked their children's death, people are here to explain what's happening
[1:48:00.000 --> 1:48:04.400]  is I knew they'd open the show with it and but they were doing a promo intro. So we'll
[1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:08.560]  go back to a promo intro in a minute. They're going to back up on the DVR so you can see
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:14.200]  the intro almost in live time. We can also fast forward, you know, as the piece goes
[1:48:14.200 --> 1:48:19.960]  ahead and opens up. But let's go ahead and roll with that as we analyze this, this, this
[1:48:19.960 --> 1:48:23.960]  all of us here levels program. Here it is.
[1:48:23.960 --> 1:48:33.160]  Americans watch NBC News, any other news organization in the world. That's not true. Welcome to Sunday
[1:48:33.160 --> 1:48:40.160]  Night. I'm Megan Kelly.
[1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:51.520]  Alex Jones, the radical conspiracy theorist, with a new and surprising level of influence
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:49:01.720]  thanks in part to President Trump. Tonight, we confront him on his notorious lie about
[1:49:01.720 --> 1:49:06.720]  the Sandy Hook Massacre. Oh, this isn't a hit piece. Just where does he get his information?
[1:49:06.720 --> 1:49:13.200]  She's not a hit piece. It's not on that. We have her on tape. But if you haven't ascertained
[1:49:13.200 --> 1:49:17.640]  the veracity of that article and it's all BS, then you put out a bunch of misinformation.
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:24.240]  Oh, this isn't a gotcha interview. Issues a call for courage in a time when public discourse
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:29.360]  has turned. Oh, they go to him. They go to the guy that set up the big races with no
[1:49:29.360 --> 1:49:33.880]  proof for what may be the next gold rush. There's a lot of money to be made here. It's
[1:49:33.880 --> 1:49:41.200]  a booming delivery service. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. Deliver to your door NBC, what got like
[1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:46.000]  three million taxpayer money in the stimulus package from Obama. Yeah, NBC gets your tax
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:54.160]  money at gunpoint with the IRS. They're going to say he's just Dr. Feelgood. And then Keith
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:50:00.480]  Morrison takes us and then I guess they're leading with me. Wow. Wow. That's shocking.
[1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:06.280]  Where the hills are alive with the sound of Americans moving here in droves. This place
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:10.480]  is amazing. And it's where I want to be. Find out where we are and see if you can spot a
[1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:18.160]  familiar face from some of your favorite movies. This is Sunday night. This is a load of BS
[1:50:18.160 --> 1:50:24.080]  from the globalist tonight. Our report on the incendiary radio host Alex Jones incendiary
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:29.080]  for years. Jones has been spreading conspiracy theories. Claiming for instance that elements
[1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:34.840]  of the US government allowed the 9 11 attacks to happen. And that the horrific Sandy Hook
[1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:39.560]  massacre was a hoax. Saudi Arabia did it. Some thought we shouldn't broadcast this interview
[1:50:39.560 --> 1:50:45.840]  because his baseless allegations aren't just offensive. They're dangerous. But here's the
[1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:54.640]  thing. Alex Jones isn't going away. The channel has racked up 1.3 billion views. They want
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:51:00.680]  that shut down. It has millions of listeners in the ear of our current president. We begin
[1:51:00.680 --> 1:51:05.480]  our report with his reaction to the recent terrorist attack in Manchester, England.
[1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:32.160]  A big bomb goes off at a pop star's rock concert bombing a bunch of liberal trendies. You said
[1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:36.920]  it was a bunch of liberal trendies that were killed. The same people who are promoting
[1:51:36.920 --> 1:51:43.360]  open borders bringing Islamists in. Yes, that's true. In response to which many people looked
[1:51:43.360 --> 1:51:48.920]  at the victims, many of whom were 15, 14. It was a little. I know I'm sorry I didn't
[1:51:48.920 --> 1:51:53.480]  blow them up. I know. But I did something bad though. No, that that you. Oh, wow. That's
[1:51:53.480 --> 1:51:58.720]  a jump. Right. There was. I said the Muslims did it. I mean, exactly. Eight years old.
[1:51:58.720 --> 1:52:02.400]  You do report on her. It's all edited. Yeah, because that's what you said about the victims
[1:52:02.400 --> 1:52:08.000]  is what has people. Yeah, no, no. The Muslims didn't do it. I did the jump cut. You can
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:12.920]  watch it though. I got home at like six o'clock, heard about it. The ages of the victims weren't
[1:52:12.920 --> 1:52:17.800]  even known, but they were saying it was jihadi. And I said, how crazy is it that liberal trendies
[1:52:17.800 --> 1:52:22.360]  are now the victims? And then I start going and looking of course, if there's kids being
[1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:26.840]  killed by Muslims, I'm not saying that that that it's their fault. That pattern, reckless
[1:52:26.840 --> 1:52:32.000]  at the matter. Okay, but that's that's a fair clue. That's not that bad. Exactly what I
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:38.440]  said. Yeah, no, but ballpark. He has spent nearly two decades on the fringe, shouting
[1:52:38.440 --> 1:52:43.160]  his conspiracy theories into any microphone he could get in front of. Here he is on Austin
[1:52:43.160 --> 1:52:49.520]  Community Television in 2001, tyranny is enveloping the globe. He and his company info wars have
[1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:54.960]  been steadily gaining followers for years, producing radio shows and webcasts, which
[1:52:54.960 --> 1:53:00.040]  reach millions a month. I mean, the Muslims blow up liberals. Why do liberals bring them
[1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:05.400]  in? That's totally true. I agree. Presidential candidate, Donald Trump. I just want to finish
[1:53:05.400 --> 1:53:11.080]  by saying your reputation is amazing. It is December 2015. Mr. Trump appeared on Jones's
[1:53:11.080 --> 1:53:16.920]  radio program offering free. I'll sign him to you. I will not let you down. You will
[1:53:16.920 --> 1:53:23.120]  be very, very impressed. I hope. And I think we'll be speaking a lot separately. Both men
[1:53:23.120 --> 1:53:27.560]  had supported the false statement that Barack Obama was not a natural born citizen. Oh,
[1:53:27.560 --> 1:53:33.280]  give me a break. It's surging. And they've had more in common since that. I agree with
[1:53:33.280 --> 1:53:38.040]  Trump on that. He greased me because I've got articles. He's following Alex on coal.
[1:53:38.040 --> 1:53:42.640]  He's following Alex on guns. He's following Alex on borders. The 2016 can't want to say
[1:53:42.640 --> 1:53:48.120]  no, he's not. That's normal conservative libertarian ideas. That's deceptive right there. Cutten
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:53.600]  in the net. More than five times higher than the previous November. And when Mr. Trump
[1:53:53.600 --> 1:53:59.400]  won, Alex Jones found himself with access to the seat of power. Info wars got a temporary
[1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:03.880]  White House press pass for the first time. And Jones says Mr. Trump called him after
[1:54:03.880 --> 1:54:09.360]  the election to thank him for his help. You have said that it's surreal to say something
[1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:12.720]  on info wars and then hear it come out of the president United States mouth a couple
[1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:19.040]  days later. I mean, that has happened, but do you think he's watching? I mean, I know
[1:54:19.040 --> 1:54:24.280]  Trump watches and sees the clips and things. As we did find indications of that on July
[1:54:24.280 --> 1:54:30.320]  22nd, 2015, info wars put up this video claiming it showed drug trafficking along the U.S.
[1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:36.440]  Mexico border. Although we don't know what it actually shows. We actually witnessed a
[1:54:36.440 --> 1:54:42.280]  drug smuggling operation. We brought the drugs into the U.S. Three days later, Mr. Trump
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:46.800]  gave this speech in Iowa. Big story. It's all over the place now. Guy's swimming across
[1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:53.440]  and big bags of stuff. So obvious. Swimming across conspiracy theorists. The river. Only
[1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:58.120]  NBC's line of six drugs previewing the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and
[1:54:58.120 --> 1:55:03.280]  Hillary Clinton. I think she's going to show up and on drugs, though. She's going to be
[1:55:03.280 --> 1:55:10.320]  locked up and Mr. Trump's take not long after. We should take a drug test, Brian, because
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:16.480]  that was a great point you made to the Donald Trump ally and frequent guests. Roger Stone
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:21.360]  underscored the connection between Jones and the Trump campaign in a tweet last spring.
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:27.100]  It read, MSM elites don't see that Alex Jones and info wars reach millions of Donald Trump
[1:55:27.100 --> 1:55:32.120]  supporters and helped make the Trump revolution. All anti Trump crap calls me secretary says
[1:55:32.120 --> 1:55:35.760]  Donald Trump like talk to Mr. Jones, like talk to him. Yes, boom. While Jones has boasted
[1:55:35.760 --> 1:55:40.280]  of his contact with the president on his radio show, he downplayed it in his interview with
[1:55:40.280 --> 1:55:46.520]  us, claiming the mainstream media or MSM no previous connection. I didn't get my influence
[1:55:46.520 --> 1:55:51.600]  on Trump is way, way lower than what MSM has said. Well, what kind of access do they feel
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:56.880]  like a healing up over your head? They did. He talked about politics or people like that.
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:04.640]  Would you describe yourself as friends? No, friendly. Sure. And how many times has he
[1:56:04.640 --> 1:56:09.120]  called you? I don't want to get into all that. What is it? Do you think about Alex Jones
[1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:14.560]  that President Trump finds so amazing? That's a scary question. Charlie Sykes is a conservative
[1:56:14.560 --> 1:56:21.080]  writer and another Trump. He's a rhino that's helped control the country into a rat hole.
[1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:26.080]  Toriel turn in the president's thinking and his imagination. And those darker impulsive
[1:56:26.080 --> 1:56:32.920]  are fed into by Alex Jones. Jones speaks to his listeners for hours a day, six days
[1:56:32.920 --> 1:56:39.840]  a week. His rants can be vulgar and hate filled like this one directed at a member of Congress.
[1:56:39.840 --> 1:56:46.600]  Chiff looks like the archetype archetypal. And there's something about this fairy hopping
[1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:52.200]  around. Colbert said that. Yeah, the cockholster thing was Colbert. Yeah, that Trump is a
[1:56:52.200 --> 1:56:56.280]  cockholster. So I'm making the joke back. Yeah, that's the whole thing. When you saturize
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:57:00.440]  them, they pretend like Colbert never said that. You were saturizing Colbert. They just
[1:57:00.440 --> 1:57:03.400]  pretend that you made that up out of here. They also take stuff where I'm saying clearly
[1:57:03.400 --> 1:57:08.080]  it's time sheet. He grew up the oldest child of a dentist and a homemaker and went to high
[1:57:08.080 --> 1:57:11.880]  school in Austin, Texas. Here's the look you get on. History books when I was a kid. And
[1:57:11.880 --> 1:57:15.680]  I also had family that was educated. So I mean, I just knew how things actually worked. I am
[1:57:15.680 --> 1:57:20.680]  a really good person. After a brief stint in community college, Joe has found his calling
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:26.600]  as a public advocate in Austin. He went into business for himself, founding info wars in
[1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:32.440]  1999. You idiots couldn't make it. His prospects, but he's now worth millions. I'm Alex Jones,
[1:57:32.440 --> 1:57:37.440]  your host info wars makes most of its money by selling products like male supplements.
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:45.240]  It is just come on. There'll be nothing left. The main pitchman Jones himself. I mean, it
[1:57:45.240 --> 1:57:50.040]  costs $45, $50 million a year to run them. How much money is being made? Well, the money
[1:57:50.040 --> 1:57:55.200]  that's made is pretty much put back into things. Jones uses that money to spread his message.
[1:57:55.200 --> 1:58:07.240]  I like how they put that. That was smart of them. That's like a level up. We got to watch
[1:58:07.240 --> 1:58:11.280]  off. They're going to put a heat lamp on you and just try to get your graphics to look
[1:58:11.280 --> 1:58:15.360]  like the sweaty guy. Yeah, this guy's such a loser. Nobody cares what he has to say is
[1:58:15.360 --> 1:58:18.280]  they have to come in and hate on you. That's the only way he's over all their back. We're
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:23.040]  back. Here we go. Jones is outrageous statement that the slaughter of innocent children and
[1:58:23.040 --> 1:58:29.160]  teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School, one of the darkest chapters in American history,
[1:58:29.160 --> 1:58:35.960]  was a hoax. Babies in the incubators. I lost my son. I buried my son. I held my son with
[1:58:35.960 --> 1:58:42.400]  a bullet hole through his head. Neil Heslund's son, Jesse, just six years old, was murdered.
[1:58:42.400 --> 1:58:46.280]  So they started when saying I didn't care about people in Manchester. But at least
[1:58:46.280 --> 1:58:50.840]  they didn't say I didn't say it happened. 2012 in Newtown, Connecticut. I dropped them
[1:58:50.840 --> 1:58:55.880]  off in 904. That's when we dropped them off at school. Notice she's not playing all the
[1:58:55.880 --> 1:58:59.680]  clips where I've said I think it happened. And I said it would take. You called this
[1:58:59.680 --> 1:59:06.400]  whole playbook. I wasn't hard to do. Alex Jones repeatedly claimed that the shooting
[1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:11.520]  never. And then I would play. I would go through all the different theories. But it took me
[1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:16.480]  about a year with Sandy Hook to come to grips with the fact that the whole thing was fake.
[1:59:16.480 --> 1:59:22.120]  You said the whole thing is a giant hoax. How do you deal with a total hoax? It took
[1:59:22.120 --> 1:59:27.040]  me about a year with Sandy Hook to come to grips with the fact that the whole thing was
[1:59:27.040 --> 1:59:35.480]  fake. I did deep research and my gosh, it just pretty much didn't happen. At that point,
[1:59:35.480 --> 1:59:39.040]  and I do think there's some cover up and some manipulation, that is pretty much what I believe.
[1:59:39.040 --> 1:59:43.080]  But then I was also going into devil's advocate. But then we know there's mass shootings. These
[1:59:43.080 --> 1:59:47.840]  things happen. So again, you're trying to have it always, right? No, I'm not. If you
[1:59:47.840 --> 1:59:52.320]  wrongly went out there and said it was a hoax, that's wrong. But what I already answered
[1:59:52.320 --> 1:59:57.880]  your question was listeners and other people are covering this. I didn't create that story.
[1:59:57.880 --> 2:00:07.560]  Alex, the parents, one after the other, devastated the dead bodies that the coroner autopsy and
[2:00:07.560 --> 2:00:10.760]  they blocked all that and they won't release any of it. That's that's unprecedented. All
[2:00:10.760 --> 2:00:16.240]  of the parents decided to come out and lie about their dead children. I didn't say that.
[2:00:16.240 --> 2:00:20.120]  What happened to the children? I will sit there on the air and look at every position
[2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:26.040]  and play devil's advocate. Was that devil's advocate? The whole thing is a giant hoax.
[2:00:26.040 --> 2:00:35.320]  The whole thing was fake. Yes, because I remember in. Remember everything you say, right? Looks
[2:00:35.320 --> 2:00:39.480]  like it's real. But then what do you do when they've got the kids going in circles in and
[2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:43.320]  out of the building with their hands up? I've watched the footage and it looks like a drill.
[2:00:43.320 --> 2:00:51.720]  When you say parents faked their children's death, people get very angry. Well, that's
[2:00:51.720 --> 2:00:54.600]  all I know. But they don't get angry about the half million debt I racked from the sanctions
[2:00:54.600 --> 2:00:58.960]  or they don't get angry about all the illegal scoring. No, no, it's not a dodge. The media
[2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:02.760]  never covers all the evil wars it's promoted. All the big names. That doesn't excuse what
[2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:08.360]  you did and said about Newtown. Here's the difference. Here's the difference. I looked
[2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:13.800]  at all the angles of Newtown and I made my statements long before the media even picked
[2:01:13.800 --> 2:01:18.600]  up on it. In our interview, we asked Jones numerous times. There's the key. I want to
[2:01:18.600 --> 2:01:21.640]  explain. I said I thought it happened before you ever picked up and they never show my
[2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:26.040]  final analysis. I tend to believe that children probably did die there. But then you look
[2:01:26.040 --> 2:01:32.440]  at all the other evidence. They just said you believe children died there, right? Amazing.
[2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:37.320]  But they just waited and put it in later. After President Trump took office, the Newtown
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:42.360]  Board of Education wrote to him. It was always about Newtown. She came here all of it. She
[2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:45.600]  lied to me. I have a tape about it and told me it wasn't true. Right. Just like this whole
[2:01:45.600 --> 2:01:51.640]  edit, it's a lie. All of it's a lie. Almost four months later, according to the board
[2:01:51.640 --> 2:01:56.480]  chairman, the president won't disavow Alex Jones. Now that'll be the story. The pressure
[2:01:56.480 --> 2:02:01.360]  now, they want me to get mad at Trump disavows me. Trump disavow her. Go ahead. A woman was
[2:02:01.360 --> 2:02:06.480]  sentenced to five months in prison for sending death threats to a Sandy Hook parent. Her
[2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:12.880]  defense attorney says she was primarily motivated by Info Wars. Other victims, family members
[2:02:12.880 --> 2:02:17.480]  have been harassed or threatened. But if we knew this, it'll be Alex Jones is causing
[2:02:17.480 --> 2:02:21.960]  threats. He needs to be banned. Even though I've said for years, I think it happened and
[2:02:21.960 --> 2:02:23.480]  sent a video out today saying that.
[2:02:23.480 --> 2:02:29.480]  It's respectful to me or in fact, I did lose my son and the 26 other families lost somebody
[2:02:29.480 --> 2:02:31.480]  and I take that very personal.
[2:02:31.480 --> 2:02:34.160]  You know, this piece is going to air on Father's Day.
[2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:37.160]  They're the ones see Father's Day. They open it up and it's my fault.
[2:02:37.160 --> 2:02:48.640]  I think it's a plus to have, have his children, to spend the day with, to speak to. I don't
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:49.640]  have that.
[2:02:49.640 --> 2:02:52.120]  Wow. I hear you.
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:55.120]  The consequences of Jones's actions are not limited.
[2:02:55.120 --> 2:02:59.640]  And I have a message that father already taken about their assault. He is a rabbit hole that
[2:02:59.640 --> 2:03:01.240]  is horrifying to go down now.
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:05.240]  In 2016, Jones promoted a conspiracy. He told you they promoted it.
[2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:06.240]  Promoted though. They didn't secrete it.
[2:03:06.240 --> 2:03:07.240]  I covered the story.
[2:03:07.240 --> 2:03:09.240]  The New York Times covered too.
[2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:11.240]  Wapo and everybody covered it up.
[2:03:11.240 --> 2:03:14.240]  And specifically pointed to a Washington, D.C. pizzeria.
[2:03:14.240 --> 2:03:15.240]  How long is this?
[2:03:15.240 --> 2:03:17.240]  You've got to go to infowars.com and actually check.
[2:03:17.240 --> 2:03:19.240]  Yeah, I knew they'd have to make it even longer.
[2:03:19.240 --> 2:03:21.240]  They said it was 11. This may be a half hour.
[2:03:21.240 --> 2:03:24.240]  To investigate the case themselves.
[2:03:24.240 --> 2:03:26.240]  Oh, because I said investigate.
[2:03:26.240 --> 2:03:27.240]  Right.
[2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:31.240]  A month after I said it was a hoax, some guy goes in here and says an actor. Who's the
[2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:32.240]  middle of that?
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:33.240]  The middle of that.
[2:03:33.240 --> 2:03:34.240]  They've been dotted for stuff.
[2:03:34.240 --> 2:03:38.240]  Well, he had other criminal charges going in. He had criminal charges pending against
[2:03:38.240 --> 2:03:39.240]  him already.
[2:03:39.240 --> 2:03:41.240]  And he's a known actor.
[2:03:41.240 --> 2:03:43.240]  We had IMDb profile, I think.
[2:03:43.240 --> 2:03:44.240]  Mm-hmm.
[2:03:44.240 --> 2:03:47.240]  Mr. Aliphonus, comic ping pong, or his employees.
[2:03:47.240 --> 2:03:50.240]  Another apology came just this spring.
[2:03:50.240 --> 2:03:56.240]  Chobani yogurt sued Jones after info wars fanned the lie that Chobani employees...
[2:03:56.240 --> 2:03:57.240]  Fanned the lie.
[2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:00.240]  I told him I did not create the stories.
[2:04:00.240 --> 2:04:01.240]  I regret that we...
[2:04:01.240 --> 2:04:04.240]  Well, that story was covered about the refugees causing tuberculosis.
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:05.240]  Yeah.
[2:04:05.240 --> 2:04:06.240]  Which is a true story.
[2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:09.240]  Yeah, the company didn't bring them in. The owner did.
[2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:13.240]  And not the particular sex assault people, just the point is he's promoting the refugees.
[2:04:13.240 --> 2:04:17.240]  So it's in the news. I cover what's in the news. They know I'm a target. So it's put
[2:04:17.240 --> 2:04:20.240]  out in the news that I created the whole Chobani controversy.
[2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:21.240]  Right.
[2:04:21.240 --> 2:04:22.240]  So it's your fault.
[2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:25.240]  So then we were very happy with the settlement. I'll just leave it at that.
[2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:26.240]  You're not going to let me get it on, all right?
[2:04:26.240 --> 2:04:28.240]  I'm going to let you get it. I just want to make sure the record's straight because I
[2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:29.240]  don't want to smear the man.
[2:04:29.240 --> 2:04:34.240]  You are the one who said that you were wrong about Chobani. You said that.
[2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:43.240]  Well, that's because they chose to go after me. And so I simply pointed out that we were
[2:04:43.240 --> 2:04:46.240]  reporting other people's reports that were not entirely accurate and for that we were
[2:04:46.240 --> 2:04:47.240]  sorry because it was true.
[2:04:47.240 --> 2:04:49.240]  You don't sound very sorry.
[2:04:49.240 --> 2:04:54.240]  Well, the media said stuff about the settlement that wasn't true.
[2:04:54.240 --> 2:05:00.240]  You said things about Chobani and its owner that were not true. Are you sorry?
[2:05:00.240 --> 2:05:01.240]  Well, he works for the federal government.
[2:05:01.240 --> 2:05:05.240]  I'll tell you again, the media really was upset that they said that there was a hoax.
[2:05:05.240 --> 2:05:06.240]  It's not the media.
[2:05:06.240 --> 2:05:07.240]  And so what they did.
[2:05:07.240 --> 2:05:08.240]  You.
[2:05:08.240 --> 2:05:09.240]  And so what they did.
[2:05:09.240 --> 2:05:10.240]  Are you sorry?
[2:05:10.240 --> 2:05:16.240]  And so what they did. So what the media did. And we know it was the media. And we have
[2:05:16.240 --> 2:05:20.240]  the PIs and the law firms and we're working on it right now. Let's just say Chobani was
[2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:22.240]  real happy to get out of that lawsuit.
[2:05:22.240 --> 2:05:28.240]  But the lawsuit makes clear Info Wars was the only media outlet to report the lie that
[2:05:28.240 --> 2:05:34.240]  forced Jones to apologize. And with that apology, Chobani considers the matter closed.
[2:05:34.240 --> 2:05:37.240]  Do you think of yourself as a journalist?
[2:05:37.240 --> 2:05:38.240]  I have another one.
[2:05:38.240 --> 2:05:40.240]  In other words, Chobani wouldn't be able to comment.
[2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:41.240]  No.
[2:05:41.240 --> 2:05:42.240]  Exactly.
[2:05:42.240 --> 2:05:44.240]  So Chobani was just glad to be out of that lawsuit.
[2:05:44.240 --> 2:05:47.240]  In the Info Wars studio, there's no script.
[2:05:47.240 --> 2:05:52.240]  Instead, it's a freewheeling spin through piles of articles straight off the Internet.
[2:05:52.240 --> 2:05:56.240]  95% of what we cover is looking at a news article and then.
[2:05:56.240 --> 2:05:57.240]  Yeah, really.
[2:05:57.240 --> 2:05:58.240]  I love the mainstream.
[2:05:58.240 --> 2:05:59.240]  Well, but you know, if you just look at it.
[2:05:59.240 --> 2:06:00.240]  No, I don't think you look that.
[2:06:00.240 --> 2:06:01.240]  It's garbage.
[2:06:01.240 --> 2:06:02.240]  It's garbage.
[2:06:02.240 --> 2:06:03.240]  You know how they're zooming in on you real close too?
[2:06:03.240 --> 2:06:04.240]  Oh, yeah.
[2:06:04.240 --> 2:06:07.240]  And it's all BS. And then you spend two hours talking about it.
[2:06:07.240 --> 2:06:08.240]  Then you put out a bunch of misinformation.
[2:06:08.240 --> 2:06:10.240]  I'm just trying to figure out what the vetting process is.
[2:06:10.240 --> 2:06:12.240]  I mean, we all get Hillary was 15 points ahead.
[2:06:12.240 --> 2:06:18.240]  I mean, we all get mainstream media has got a big problem.
[2:06:18.240 --> 2:06:25.240]  The Info Wars staffers we met have free reign to cover whatever they like with virtually no oversight.
[2:06:25.240 --> 2:06:29.240]  We spoke with some of Jones's employees, including Owen Schreuer.
[2:06:29.240 --> 2:06:33.240]  How do you, on a day-to-day basis, figure out what you're going to do?
[2:06:33.240 --> 2:06:40.240]  I wake up, I look at the news, I pray, I rarely get directives from Alex or my boss.
[2:06:40.240 --> 2:06:41.240]  They pretty much just leave it up to me.
[2:06:41.240 --> 2:06:44.240]  Is that what you consider yourself to be a journalist?
[2:06:44.240 --> 2:06:46.240]  You know, I don't like calling it that.
[2:06:46.240 --> 2:06:47.240]  I'm just a human.
[2:06:47.240 --> 2:06:49.240]  I'm just a human that's looking for truth.
[2:06:49.240 --> 2:06:53.240]  So I'm trying to reach out and be what the people want.
[2:06:53.240 --> 2:06:55.240]  When you say people, what do you mean?
[2:06:55.240 --> 2:06:59.240]  The deplorables, the flyover country, the forgotten American.
[2:06:59.240 --> 2:07:03.240]  We're going to get to work immediately for the American people.
[2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:08.240]  With the election of Donald Trump, Alex Jones has plans to expand Info Wars.
[2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:13.240]  More studios, more shows, more employees, more influence.
[2:07:13.240 --> 2:07:17.240]  I said the night he won, I said the war has just begun.
[2:07:17.240 --> 2:07:23.240]  So we just got a beachhead, and so that's just the start of the war for me.
[2:07:23.240 --> 2:07:27.240]  And Alex Jones goes into battle with a powerful ally.
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:32.240]  Just two weeks ago, the Trump-Pence campaign emailed this message to supporters.
[2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:37.240]  Notice, at the bottom, it's a link to Info Wars.
[2:07:37.240 --> 2:07:39.240]  Oh no, done, done, done.
[2:07:39.240 --> 2:07:44.240]  It's not seeing an insane kill everybody and financing plays to kill the president.
[2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:46.240]  And responsibility.
[2:07:46.240 --> 2:07:49.240]  That's what the whole thing was about, tying you to Trump.
[2:07:49.240 --> 2:07:51.240]  So now Tom Brokaw's coming on?
[2:07:51.240 --> 2:07:52.240]  God.
[2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:54.240]  Who literally, I wanted to get Roger on.
[2:07:54.240 --> 2:07:57.240]  I invited Roger on, but I didn't know the peace would air right up front.
[2:07:57.240 --> 2:07:58.240]  So Roger's been holding for 30 minutes.
[2:07:58.240 --> 2:08:01.240]  Did he have to go?
[2:08:01.240 --> 2:08:03.240]  We're going to Roger Stone right now.
[2:08:03.240 --> 2:08:05.240]  I've got to say this though, I pledge to everyone.
[2:08:05.240 --> 2:08:07.240]  I used to be fat.
[2:08:07.240 --> 2:08:08.240]  I've lost like 60-something pounds.
[2:08:08.240 --> 2:08:09.240]  I have a big head.
[2:08:09.240 --> 2:08:11.240]  But folks, I don't look like that.
[2:08:11.240 --> 2:08:13.240]  What they, they did like have some heat lamp over me.
[2:08:13.240 --> 2:08:15.240]  I remember that like, what is that red lamp above me?
[2:08:15.240 --> 2:08:17.240]  But the whole point is they lied about everything.
[2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:18.240]  They did this.
[2:08:18.240 --> 2:08:21.240]  It's all about wounding the president.
[2:08:21.240 --> 2:08:23.240]  I think she's about to come back with Tom Brokaw.
[2:08:23.240 --> 2:08:24.240]  So be ready.
[2:08:24.240 --> 2:08:26.240]  And Roger Stone joins us.
[2:08:26.240 --> 2:08:29.240]  Tom Brokaw said, I'm deeply racist.
[2:08:29.240 --> 2:08:33.240]  So they've called in the old hand to come after you, after me.
[2:08:33.240 --> 2:08:35.240]  What make of this Roger Stone?
[2:08:35.240 --> 2:08:41.240]  Well, Alex, you've clearly gotten under the skin of the globalists
[2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:44.240]  and those who seek to remove our president,
[2:08:44.240 --> 2:08:46.240]  those who opposed it.
[2:08:46.240 --> 2:08:49.240]  Believe me, they would not be trying to deconstruct
[2:08:49.240 --> 2:08:53.240]  this kind of character assassination if you weren't effective.
[2:08:53.240 --> 2:08:56.240]  I think they realized freedom's on the march.
[2:08:56.240 --> 2:08:59.240]  And that millions and millions of people watch
[2:08:59.240 --> 2:09:03.240]  the wars do what they do, which is take the daily news
[2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:05.240]  from the newspapers and break it down.
[2:09:05.240 --> 2:09:07.240]  That's what they do.
[2:09:07.240 --> 2:09:08.240]  That's what we do.
[2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:12.240]  The difference is they have greater bias.
[2:09:12.240 --> 2:09:13.240]  Exactly.
[2:09:13.240 --> 2:09:16.240]  I mean, I sit here mainly and play clips of where
[2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:18.240]  they're saying outrageous stuff.
[2:09:18.240 --> 2:09:22.240]  I mean, most of what we do is just right there in everybody's face.
[2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:23.240]  Exactly.
[2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:26.240]  It is, you know, look, the way they have you lit,
[2:09:26.240 --> 2:09:29.240]  this lighting you from underneath through the flashlight.
[2:09:29.240 --> 2:09:32.240]  They're trying to make you look like the devil like Lucifer.
[2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:34.240]  They've got the heat cranked up.
[2:09:34.240 --> 2:09:38.240]  They're doing this late at night after you put in a full day's work.
[2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:42.240]  I mean, it's the most obvious hatchet job that I've seen.
[2:09:42.240 --> 2:09:45.240]  On the other hand, I predict openly right now,
[2:09:45.240 --> 2:09:49.240]  the info or audience will only grow.
[2:09:49.240 --> 2:09:50.240]  We'll grow.
[2:09:50.240 --> 2:09:51.240]  I agree.
[2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:53.240]  Other than having to look at a wet walrus for, you know,
[2:09:53.240 --> 2:09:55.240]  30 minutes, 20 minutes has been pretty powerful.
[2:09:55.240 --> 2:09:56.240]  What do you predict?
[2:09:56.240 --> 2:09:59.240]  Old Tom Brokaw, who used the original term,
[2:09:59.240 --> 2:10:01.240]  I'm totally racist.
[2:10:01.240 --> 2:10:04.240]  A few days ago, we didn't know he was the secret old gladiator
[2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:07.240]  they brought in when Maximus had already wiped them all out,
[2:10:07.240 --> 2:10:08.240]  which is you guys.
[2:10:08.240 --> 2:10:10.240]  This is getting too ridiculous.
[2:10:10.240 --> 2:10:11.240]  Oh, she's back.
[2:10:11.240 --> 2:10:12.240]  He's back.
[2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:13.240]  Let's go to her.
[2:10:13.240 --> 2:10:14.240]  Stay there, Roger.
[2:10:14.240 --> 2:10:16.240]  Recreational use will be legal next year.
[2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:17.240]  No, we're going to pop up.
[2:10:17.240 --> 2:10:19.240]  Gary Smith reports tonight on a high-tech business
[2:10:19.240 --> 2:10:20.240]  that's cashing in.
[2:10:20.240 --> 2:10:21.240]  Oh, I get it.
[2:10:21.240 --> 2:10:22.240]  They didn't flagpole it.
[2:10:22.240 --> 2:10:24.240]  They didn't put it at the end.
[2:10:24.240 --> 2:10:25.240]  That's what they said.
[2:10:25.240 --> 2:10:26.240]  They're going to have up front.
[2:10:26.240 --> 2:10:29.240]  And then the end, Dan rather, I mean, Dan rather,
[2:10:29.240 --> 2:10:33.240]  Tom Brokaw, he comes in to like further do it.
[2:10:33.240 --> 2:10:34.240]  Right.
[2:10:34.240 --> 2:10:35.240]  Wow.
[2:10:35.240 --> 2:10:37.240]  So the big superstar here out of retirement,
[2:10:37.240 --> 2:10:41.240]  Roger Stone is kind of obvious though,
[2:10:41.240 --> 2:10:45.240]  because it's making Kelly has no credibility publicly
[2:10:45.240 --> 2:10:49.240]  since you have, I think, artfully destroyed her credibility
[2:10:49.240 --> 2:10:51.240]  in the last week.
[2:10:51.240 --> 2:10:55.240]  And by openly exposing the edits and the various tricks
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:10:58.240]  that they use to take you out of context,
[2:10:58.240 --> 2:11:02.240]  to twist your words, to make the words in your mouth,
[2:11:02.240 --> 2:11:06.240]  they had to pull this guy out to try to borrow his credibility
[2:11:06.240 --> 2:11:09.240]  because she has none.
[2:11:09.240 --> 2:11:13.240]  You know, I think moving to NBC is a slippery slope.
[2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:16.240]  This is the next step to oblivion.
[2:11:16.240 --> 2:11:18.240]  I doubt other than the show that you're on now,
[2:11:18.240 --> 2:11:20.240]  she's going to get the ratings at all.
[2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:23.240]  You know, she, just from the time I saw her last,
[2:11:23.240 --> 2:11:24.240]  looks like a wet cat.
[2:11:24.240 --> 2:11:26.240]  If you put a video, baby, back that up to her.
[2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:28.240]  And I've heard from sources at NBC,
[2:11:28.240 --> 2:11:29.240]  she's just catatonic.
[2:11:29.240 --> 2:11:30.240]  I'm not feeling powerful.
[2:11:30.240 --> 2:11:31.240]  I'm sad.
[2:11:31.240 --> 2:11:33.240]  I don't know what Megan Kelly thought was going to happen here.
[2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:36.240]  I mean, you know, she definitely gave as good as she got,
[2:11:36.240 --> 2:11:38.240]  but she's on tape fawning over me,
[2:11:38.240 --> 2:11:40.240]  worshiping me basically, which is pathetic.
[2:11:40.240 --> 2:11:42.240]  It was clearly, you know, made up,
[2:11:42.240 --> 2:11:45.240]  thought she was trying to sell me a table dance.
[2:11:45.240 --> 2:11:49.240]  But I mean, so they had to literally bring Tom Brokaw.
[2:11:49.240 --> 2:11:51.240]  When I was a kid watching them on TV,
[2:11:51.240 --> 2:11:52.240]  I can't believe this actually happened.
[2:11:52.240 --> 2:11:54.240]  If I would have thought they're going to bring him out of retirement
[2:11:54.240 --> 2:11:56.240]  to come out and call me a racist
[2:11:56.240 --> 2:11:58.240]  and then put him on the show to attack me.
[2:11:58.240 --> 2:12:00.240]  This is Twilight Zone, Roger Stone.
[2:12:00.240 --> 2:12:01.240]  It's...
[2:12:01.240 --> 2:12:02.240]  Well, it's also the fallback.
[2:12:02.240 --> 2:12:06.240]  You see, whenever they can't argue anything out on the merits,
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:10.240]  they move immediately to name call it.
[2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:14.240]  I mean, I'm so sick of being called a racist.
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:19.240]  I marched without an Andrew Cuomo and Russell Simmons
[2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:21.240]  for drug law reform.
[2:12:21.240 --> 2:12:22.240]  So did I?
[2:12:22.240 --> 2:12:23.240]  I protested the KKK.
[2:12:23.240 --> 2:12:24.240]  All of it.
[2:12:24.240 --> 2:12:26.240]  It means nothing to these people.
[2:12:26.240 --> 2:12:27.240]  Well, they're not interested in facts.
[2:12:27.240 --> 2:12:29.240]  They're just interested in name calling
[2:12:29.240 --> 2:12:32.240]  because it's a way to cut off the debate
[2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:35.240]  and discredit you without having any factual arguments.
[2:12:35.240 --> 2:12:36.240]  Let me ask you this.
[2:12:36.240 --> 2:12:38.240]  I want to ask both of you this guy.
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:40.240]  I mean, all three of you.
[2:12:40.240 --> 2:12:44.240]  We all saw May 3rd clip, C-SPAN June 8th clip,
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:45.240]  where Comey said,
[2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:47.240]  nobody tried to influence me, including the president.
[2:12:47.240 --> 2:12:48.240]  Nobody obstructed justice.
[2:12:48.240 --> 2:12:50.240]  Nobody ordered me to stop the investigation.
[2:12:50.240 --> 2:12:51.240]  Then they have New York Times,
[2:12:51.240 --> 2:12:52.240]  Washington Post articles saying,
[2:12:52.240 --> 2:12:53.240]  I'm a liar.
[2:12:53.240 --> 2:12:55.240]  Jack Subbock's a liar.
[2:12:55.240 --> 2:12:56.240]  Roger Stone's a liar.
[2:12:56.240 --> 2:12:58.240]  You're a liar by name.
[2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:00.240]  Mike Sernovich saying,
[2:13:00.240 --> 2:13:01.240]  we actually...
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:03.240]  And then they show transcripts of what we made up.
[2:13:03.240 --> 2:13:06.240]  That's the word for word that happened.
[2:13:06.240 --> 2:13:07.240]  These are the biggest fake...
[2:13:07.240 --> 2:13:09.240]  I mean, in the old days, like a year ago,
[2:13:09.240 --> 2:13:12.240]  if you're going to call somebody totally racist,
[2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:15.240]  you better have the clip of them at the KKK meeting
[2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:16.240]  or saying something.
[2:13:16.240 --> 2:13:19.240]  Since when do they triple down into total fake news
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:21.240]  and then say we are?
[2:13:21.240 --> 2:13:23.240]  I think most people don't investigate that type of thing.
[2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:25.240]  They take what they say at face value.
[2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:27.240]  So that's where they get their power from,
[2:13:27.240 --> 2:13:28.240]  is that the people,
[2:13:28.240 --> 2:13:30.240]  majority of people out there aren't looking into us.
[2:13:30.240 --> 2:13:32.240]  They're not looking for the clip to try to prove that,
[2:13:32.240 --> 2:13:33.240]  hey, this guy is a racist.
[2:13:33.240 --> 2:13:35.240]  So that's where they get their power from.
[2:13:35.240 --> 2:13:37.240]  Why would I want to be a racist anyways
[2:13:37.240 --> 2:13:39.240]  when my sister's adopted Korean
[2:13:39.240 --> 2:13:40.240]  and I'm not going to get the rest of my family
[2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:41.240]  and I'm part Native American
[2:13:41.240 --> 2:13:43.240]  plus half the country's Hispanic.
[2:13:43.240 --> 2:13:46.240]  It's about to be like 70% by the time I'm an old man.
[2:13:46.240 --> 2:13:49.240]  Well, why would I just want to hate everybody I'm around?
[2:13:49.240 --> 2:13:51.240]  I mean, plus it doesn't matter. Where's the proof?
[2:13:51.240 --> 2:13:54.240]  They're the ones race-baiting constantly, Roger.
[2:13:54.240 --> 2:13:57.240]  Roger Stonely asked you this, Sernovich.
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:13:58.240]  How far does this race-baiting go?
[2:13:58.240 --> 2:14:01.240]  Because I am so sick of it.
[2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:02.240]  People aren't believing anymore.
[2:14:02.240 --> 2:14:03.240]  That's the whole thing.
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:05.240]  People will do their own research,
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:08.240]  do their own homework, and every time they hear...
[2:14:08.240 --> 2:14:10.240]  They're honestly, if you were a real racist...
[2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:13.240]  They call you a racist in your wife's Persian.
[2:14:13.240 --> 2:14:14.240]  A beautiful lady.
[2:14:14.240 --> 2:14:15.240]  I'll be honest with you.
[2:14:15.240 --> 2:14:17.240]  If you were a real racist, you would be very happy today
[2:14:17.240 --> 2:14:19.240]  because you could hide under the radar
[2:14:19.240 --> 2:14:21.240]  because now everybody's been called a racist.
[2:14:21.240 --> 2:14:23.240]  So if you were actually in the KKK,
[2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:25.240]  because everybody's called a racist,
[2:14:25.240 --> 2:14:27.240]  they wouldn't even believe it when you pointed out
[2:14:27.240 --> 2:14:29.240]  the guy who's actually doing the bad thing.
[2:14:29.240 --> 2:14:32.240]  So the media's doing a real disservice to people
[2:14:32.240 --> 2:14:34.240]  because if everybody's a racist, then nobody's a racist.
[2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:35.240]  Right.
[2:14:35.240 --> 2:14:40.240]  You know, Alex, I think this tactic worked well
[2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:44.240]  when the mainstream media had a monopoly on political discourse.
[2:14:44.240 --> 2:14:46.240]  When they owned the three networks,
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:49.240]  and then ultimately the two cable news networks,
[2:14:49.240 --> 2:14:52.240]  and there was no rebuttal from any place,
[2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:56.240]  you could brand anybody as a racist or an anti-semi.
[2:14:56.240 --> 2:15:01.240]  Now that we have a vibrant and robust alternative media,
[2:15:01.240 --> 2:15:05.240]  and these things get actively rebutted,
[2:15:05.240 --> 2:15:07.240]  I don't think the tactic is working.
[2:15:07.240 --> 2:15:10.240]  That's why they're so desperate to censor the internet.
[2:15:10.240 --> 2:15:11.240]  Internet.
[2:15:11.240 --> 2:15:12.240]  That's why they're so desperate.
[2:15:12.240 --> 2:15:13.240]  I agree.
[2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:15.240]  So let me ask you all three this question.
[2:15:15.240 --> 2:15:17.240]  What happens to Megan Kelly as a bellwether?
[2:15:17.240 --> 2:15:21.240]  What happens now that this is taking place?
[2:15:21.240 --> 2:15:23.240]  What's their next move?
[2:15:23.240 --> 2:15:25.240]  Because you guys, I mean, I know you guys,
[2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:26.240]  you don't make up sources.
[2:15:26.240 --> 2:15:29.240]  You're getting sources that NBC is panicking.
[2:15:29.240 --> 2:15:30.240]  They want her out.
[2:15:30.240 --> 2:15:31.240]  They want her to go back to Fox.
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:33.240]  I mean, what does she do next?
[2:15:33.240 --> 2:15:35.240]  I wouldn't be surprised if we see a piece
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:38.240]  about internet hate speech and fake news
[2:15:38.240 --> 2:15:39.240]  and pushing that narrative.
[2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:43.240]  I think that might be on her agenda.
[2:15:43.240 --> 2:15:46.240]  My guess is that the ratings for her show
[2:15:46.240 --> 2:15:48.240]  will continue to suffer.
[2:15:48.240 --> 2:15:49.240]  Who knows?
[2:15:49.240 --> 2:15:51.240]  I don't know what the length of her contract is,
[2:15:51.240 --> 2:15:53.240]  but at the end of it, my guess is
[2:15:53.240 --> 2:15:55.240]  that they'll either move her or terminate her.
[2:15:55.240 --> 2:15:56.240]  That's right.
[2:15:56.240 --> 2:15:57.240]  Let's follow the topography.
[2:15:57.240 --> 2:16:00.240]  She comes in, huge interview with Putin,
[2:16:00.240 --> 2:16:01.240]  ratings are low.
[2:16:01.240 --> 2:16:02.240]  They're low before.
[2:16:02.240 --> 2:16:04.240]  I think she gets a big bounce,
[2:16:04.240 --> 2:16:05.240]  but it's like the death star blowing up.
[2:16:05.240 --> 2:16:07.240]  And I think in three or four months,
[2:16:07.240 --> 2:16:08.240]  her show's canceled.
[2:16:08.240 --> 2:16:10.240]  Well, and when it does get canceled,
[2:16:10.240 --> 2:16:12.240]  Alex, I know because you're a gentleman.
[2:16:12.240 --> 2:16:15.240]  Don't send her a dozen long stem roses.
[2:16:15.240 --> 2:16:18.240]  All I know is I'm one ugly son of a bitch
[2:16:18.240 --> 2:16:19.240]  on that show.
[2:16:19.240 --> 2:16:20.240]  God, am I that ugly?
[2:16:20.240 --> 2:16:22.240]  The heat lamp, man.
[2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:24.240]  Nobody's looking at me right there.
[2:16:24.240 --> 2:16:25.240]  I don't look like that now.
[2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:27.240]  No, I know the heat lamp, dude.
[2:16:27.240 --> 2:16:30.240]  That is, so for everybody watching,
[2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:31.240]  you're watching a,
[2:16:31.240 --> 2:16:32.240]  this is how they do things,
[2:16:32.240 --> 2:16:33.240]  deplicitously.
[2:16:33.240 --> 2:16:35.240]  They'll put a heat lamp over your head
[2:16:35.240 --> 2:16:36.240]  and then try to get you sweating
[2:16:36.240 --> 2:16:38.240]  and then zoom in and then pixelate your head
[2:16:38.240 --> 2:16:40.240]  and then light you up like a pumpkin.
[2:16:40.240 --> 2:16:43.240]  So if you're going to talk to the media
[2:16:43.240 --> 2:16:44.240]  ever, make sure you know
[2:16:44.240 --> 2:16:46.240]  that they are going to try to do tricks like that
[2:16:46.240 --> 2:16:47.240]  to make sure,
[2:16:47.240 --> 2:16:48.240]  the only thing that saved me
[2:16:48.240 --> 2:16:50.240]  for the Scott Peller 60 Minutes
[2:16:50.240 --> 2:16:51.240]  is Shawna was like, you know,
[2:16:51.240 --> 2:16:53.240]  make sure you look a certain way.
[2:16:53.240 --> 2:16:54.240]  She would have watched
[2:16:54.240 --> 2:16:56.240]  because she knows how bad these people are.
[2:16:56.240 --> 2:16:58.240]  She did a great job on Scott Peller.
[2:16:58.240 --> 2:17:01.240]  The heat lamp thing was a dirty trick,
[2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:03.240]  but people are going to see through that.
[2:17:03.240 --> 2:17:04.240]  They could have put some hamburgers
[2:17:04.240 --> 2:17:05.240]  and some fries down there
[2:17:05.240 --> 2:17:06.240]  and kept them warm.
[2:17:06.240 --> 2:17:07.240]  Where's the other eight hours
[2:17:07.240 --> 2:17:08.240]  of your interview?
[2:17:08.240 --> 2:17:10.240]  You know, that's the next question.
[2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:12.240]  I mean, because she edited
[2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:13.240]  some of it out of context,
[2:17:13.240 --> 2:17:14.240]  but they were being a little more careful
[2:17:14.240 --> 2:17:15.240]  because she'd say,
[2:17:15.240 --> 2:17:18.240]  she fanned the flames of this story.
[2:17:18.240 --> 2:17:19.240]  She stayed backed off,
[2:17:19.240 --> 2:17:21.240]  weren't saying I started all those stories.
[2:17:21.240 --> 2:17:22.240]  So I don't know.
[2:17:22.240 --> 2:17:23.240]  I think I've got to release
[2:17:23.240 --> 2:17:25.240]  the interview now that I've said I'll do it.
[2:17:25.240 --> 2:17:27.240]  So it's really a bunch of boring babble.
[2:17:27.240 --> 2:17:29.240]  I can't hardly quite listen to it myself or her.
[2:17:29.240 --> 2:17:31.240]  So I mean, it's just a bunch of arguing.
[2:17:31.240 --> 2:17:33.240]  I think the meme masters will go to work for you.
[2:17:33.240 --> 2:17:35.240]  You think release the audio?
[2:17:35.240 --> 2:17:36.240]  I would just release the audio.
[2:17:36.240 --> 2:17:37.240]  Release it.
[2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:38.240]  Let the red is and the chance
[2:17:38.240 --> 2:17:40.240]  and everybody just go through.
[2:17:40.240 --> 2:17:42.240]  Social media and everybody get through the clip.
[2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:43.240]  What do you think?
[2:17:43.240 --> 2:17:45.240]  What do you think, Roger Stone?
[2:17:45.240 --> 2:17:47.240]  You know, Alex, at the rate they're going,
[2:17:47.240 --> 2:17:49.240]  they will have successfully blamed you
[2:17:49.240 --> 2:17:51.240]  for the Johnstown flood.
[2:17:51.240 --> 2:17:55.240]  The Lincoln assassination and global warming,
[2:17:55.240 --> 2:17:58.240]  or I should say alleged global warming.
[2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:02.240]  This is an attempt to take you out.
[2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:06.240]  And ironically, I think the only person who got taken out
[2:18:06.240 --> 2:18:10.240]  as a credible, you know, public figure is Megan Kelly
[2:18:10.240 --> 2:18:14.240]  because the dirty tricks, the selective editing,
[2:18:14.240 --> 2:18:17.240]  the loaded questions, the misdirection,
[2:18:17.240 --> 2:18:19.240]  the clever edits,
[2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:23.240]  I think people will now see through this only because,
[2:18:23.240 --> 2:18:25.240]  only because you have been proactive
[2:18:25.240 --> 2:18:28.240]  in outlining for people in advance
[2:18:28.240 --> 2:18:30.240]  the hit piece that was to come.
[2:18:30.240 --> 2:18:31.240]  All right.
[2:18:31.240 --> 2:18:33.240]  Well, rogerstonestonecoltrip.com.
[2:18:33.240 --> 2:18:34.240]  Thank you so much.
[2:18:34.240 --> 2:18:36.240]  Look forward to speaking to you in the near future, my friend.
[2:18:36.240 --> 2:18:38.240]  Great to be with you.
[2:18:38.240 --> 2:18:39.240]  Okay.
[2:18:39.240 --> 2:18:40.240]  Now I'm going to do a little bit longer with you guys.
[2:18:40.240 --> 2:18:41.240]  I'd love to stay here all night,
[2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:43.240]  but you'll never get to talk if I don't leave.
[2:18:43.240 --> 2:18:45.240]  I can't wait to be driving home
[2:18:45.240 --> 2:18:47.240]  and like hearing you guys take calls, play clips
[2:18:47.240 --> 2:18:49.240]  and, you know, also talk to other guests.
[2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:50.240]  They're going to be coming up
[2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:52.240]  and I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central.
[2:18:52.240 --> 2:18:54.240]  But I've got a bunch of clips I want to go to
[2:18:54.240 --> 2:18:56.240]  that deal with this when we're waiting for her
[2:18:56.240 --> 2:18:58.240]  after these marijuana pieces and, you know,
[2:18:58.240 --> 2:19:01.240]  this next Wonderland piece they're going to show about.
[2:19:01.240 --> 2:19:03.240]  Next, the courage to confront the demon, Alex Jones,
[2:19:03.240 --> 2:19:07.240]  with Tom Brokoff, who's just completely looking like,
[2:19:07.240 --> 2:19:08.240]  I don't mean to be mean to an old person,
[2:19:08.240 --> 2:19:11.240]  but he can barely get it out like, watch me be mean.
[2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:12.240]  He's an unalloyed racist.
[2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:14.240]  Everyone goes, oh, so original.
[2:19:14.240 --> 2:19:16.240]  Your leadership, sir, is incredible.
[2:19:16.240 --> 2:19:18.240]  It's like watching the Fox catcher
[2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:20.240]  where he's rigging wrestling matches.
[2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:22.240]  I mean, it's just like, what the hell?
[2:19:22.240 --> 2:19:26.240]  Tom Brokoff out of some nest to like,
[2:19:26.240 --> 2:19:29.240]  literally out of like his retirement home
[2:19:29.240 --> 2:19:30.240]  to call me a racist.
[2:19:30.240 --> 2:19:32.240]  I'm supposed to crap my pants.
[2:19:32.240 --> 2:19:33.240]  Well, who else do they have, right?
[2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:34.240]  Like, who are they going to bring out?
[2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:37.240]  Where's the borrowed credibility going to come from?
[2:19:37.240 --> 2:19:39.240]  And the beautiful thing I like about this piece
[2:19:39.240 --> 2:19:43.240]  is that the media wants to try to claim
[2:19:43.240 --> 2:19:45.240]  that anybody who listens to your stuff
[2:19:45.240 --> 2:19:48.240]  is responsible for, you're responsible for what they do.
[2:19:48.240 --> 2:19:50.240]  So we need to hold a media account
[2:19:50.240 --> 2:19:53.240]  for the 500,000 dead Iraqi children.
[2:19:53.240 --> 2:19:56.240]  We need to hold them accountable for all of the lies
[2:19:56.240 --> 2:19:58.240]  that they have told, everything that they have done.
[2:19:58.240 --> 2:20:01.240]  We need to do a documentary on the victims of fake news,
[2:20:01.240 --> 2:20:03.240]  and we need to let that star Megan Kelly
[2:20:03.240 --> 2:20:06.240]  and all these other globalist warmongers.
[2:20:06.240 --> 2:20:07.240]  Well, that's right.
[2:20:07.240 --> 2:20:08.240]  I mean, I love how they,
[2:20:08.240 --> 2:20:10.240]  because I feel so sorry for that dad.
[2:20:10.240 --> 2:20:12.240]  You know, since we talked about this,
[2:20:12.240 --> 2:20:14.240]  we were having breakfast this morning
[2:20:14.240 --> 2:20:17.240]  after I'd been with my newborn daughter.
[2:20:17.240 --> 2:20:19.240]  We met about 11 o'clock, went and had a late breakfast.
[2:20:19.240 --> 2:20:21.240]  And I was telling you about how I'm sitting there.
[2:20:21.240 --> 2:20:22.240]  I feel bad that these parents,
[2:20:22.240 --> 2:20:23.240]  you know, I had to question the official story.
[2:20:23.240 --> 2:20:25.240]  My listeners were, you know,
[2:20:25.240 --> 2:20:27.240]  because they've made up so much stuff like the WMDs
[2:20:27.240 --> 2:20:29.240]  and the babies and the incubators.
[2:20:29.240 --> 2:20:31.240]  But I said, you know, I really want to reach out to parents,
[2:20:31.240 --> 2:20:32.240]  but the media keeps attacking me.
[2:20:32.240 --> 2:20:33.240]  I don't even know if I should.
[2:20:33.240 --> 2:20:34.240]  You gave me some good advice.
[2:20:34.240 --> 2:20:37.240]  I want to play my Father's Day message
[2:20:37.240 --> 2:20:41.240]  to the Sandy Hook families of the victims here in a moment.
[2:20:41.240 --> 2:20:44.240]  But you kind of, and I think you're going to be right,
[2:20:44.240 --> 2:20:46.240]  you know, got me to have the courage to come on there
[2:20:46.240 --> 2:20:47.240]  and say this.
[2:20:47.240 --> 2:20:49.240]  Yeah, I mean, it's important because now people
[2:20:49.240 --> 2:20:50.240]  are really Googling for the truth
[2:20:50.240 --> 2:20:51.240]  and looking for the truth.
[2:20:51.240 --> 2:20:53.240]  So the zombies, you can't reach.
[2:20:53.240 --> 2:20:55.240]  A bunch of people there who are, you know,
[2:20:55.240 --> 2:20:58.240]  rolling around with Cheetos dust all over their face
[2:20:58.240 --> 2:21:00.240]  and they're cracked out of their mind.
[2:21:00.240 --> 2:21:02.240]  They're taking the pharmaceuticals that they watch
[2:21:02.240 --> 2:21:05.240]  the advertisements for that subsidizes this.
[2:21:05.240 --> 2:21:07.240]  And the need, what nobody wants to talk about
[2:21:07.240 --> 2:21:09.240]  is how most of these mass shooters,
[2:21:09.240 --> 2:21:12.240]  in fact, I think all of them were on SSRIs.
[2:21:12.240 --> 2:21:15.240]  So how many of these mass shootings are actually caused
[2:21:15.240 --> 2:21:17.240]  by pharmaceuticals?
[2:21:17.240 --> 2:21:19.240]  Why don't they do a segment on the pharmaceutical companies
[2:21:19.240 --> 2:21:20.240]  poisoning people?
[2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:21.240]  Oh, because those are the advertisers.
[2:21:21.240 --> 2:21:23.240]  You can't, you can't do that.
[2:21:23.240 --> 2:21:26.240]  You got to, and this is what I always tell these fake news people.
[2:21:26.240 --> 2:21:29.240]  I go, why do you care so much about me and everybody else?
[2:21:29.240 --> 2:21:31.240]  Why don't you care about when the New York Times lies?
[2:21:31.240 --> 2:21:35.240]  Why don't you care about the Russia conspiracy theory?
[2:21:35.240 --> 2:21:36.240]  They don't care about any of that.
[2:21:36.240 --> 2:21:37.240]  Why don't you care about big pharma,
[2:21:37.240 --> 2:21:40.240]  how they're poisoning people, how Tylenol is poisoned,
[2:21:40.240 --> 2:21:41.240]  it toxifies.
[2:21:41.240 --> 2:21:44.240]  Look, they have anti-bullying ads on here to ban free speech.
[2:21:44.240 --> 2:21:45.240]  Yep.
[2:21:45.240 --> 2:21:46.240]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:21:46.240 --> 2:21:48.240]  This whole thing's anti-free speech.
[2:21:48.240 --> 2:21:49.240]  When you bully, oh my.
[2:21:49.240 --> 2:21:51.240]  Well, how about the left bullying everybody?
[2:21:51.240 --> 2:21:52.240]  eyewitnessbullying.org, okay?
[2:21:52.240 --> 2:21:53.240]  What is the left, everybody?
[2:21:53.240 --> 2:21:54.240]  Bullying everybody.
[2:21:54.240 --> 2:21:56.240]  Yeah, and Tifa, we'll have in Tifa.
[2:21:56.240 --> 2:21:57.240]  I'm sorry to interrupt.
[2:21:57.240 --> 2:21:59.240]  It's just everything they claim they are against
[2:21:59.240 --> 2:22:00.240]  is what they're doing.
[2:22:00.240 --> 2:22:01.240]  It's projection.
[2:22:01.240 --> 2:22:02.240]  Well, yeah, they're psychological manipulators,
[2:22:02.240 --> 2:22:03.240]  but it's good.
[2:22:03.240 --> 2:22:05.240]  People are going to Google and they're going to find out
[2:22:05.240 --> 2:22:07.240]  that you actually sent a very heartfelt message
[2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:09.240]  to the parents of the...
[2:22:09.240 --> 2:22:12.240]  I've been reaching out to the parents for four years.
[2:22:12.240 --> 2:22:14.240]  And then I want to know what happened,
[2:22:14.240 --> 2:22:15.240]  because I think they did the event,
[2:22:15.240 --> 2:22:17.240]  and then like they had the PR already.
[2:22:17.240 --> 2:22:18.240]  No ambulances are called.
[2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:21.240]  They bring in all this food, porta-potties.
[2:22:21.240 --> 2:22:23.240]  They've got all this stuff ready.
[2:22:23.240 --> 2:22:24.240]  I don't know.
[2:22:24.240 --> 2:22:27.240]  Well, again, my belief is that the murder,
[2:22:27.240 --> 2:22:29.240]  the murders happen to the parents...
[2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:30.240]  That's what I first thought.
[2:22:30.240 --> 2:22:31.240]  Then I got jumped on by the internet saying,
[2:22:31.240 --> 2:22:33.240]  no, no, no, it's all fake.
[2:22:33.240 --> 2:22:36.240]  Again, my belief is that it happened.
[2:22:36.240 --> 2:22:37.240]  They were murdered.
[2:22:37.240 --> 2:22:40.240]  And the reason people on the internet were skeptical,
[2:22:40.240 --> 2:22:42.240]  the media needs to own this.
[2:22:42.240 --> 2:22:44.240]  The reason they're skeptical is because everybody,
[2:22:44.240 --> 2:22:45.240]  whenever there's a tragedy,
[2:22:45.240 --> 2:22:47.240]  the media is immediately trying to say,
[2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:49.240]  ban guns, ban guns, ban guns.
[2:22:49.240 --> 2:22:50.240]  So then people start to think what we know.
[2:22:50.240 --> 2:22:51.240]  People are sick of being blamed
[2:22:51.240 --> 2:22:52.240]  for what some criminal does.
[2:22:52.240 --> 2:22:53.240]  Yeah.
[2:22:53.240 --> 2:22:55.240]  So we know that the media will stage,
[2:22:55.240 --> 2:22:57.240]  do I believe that Megan Kelly
[2:22:57.240 --> 2:22:58.240]  would order children to be murdered
[2:22:58.240 --> 2:22:59.240]  in order to ban guns?
[2:22:59.240 --> 2:23:00.240]  No.
[2:23:00.240 --> 2:23:01.240]  Well, if she could get away with...
[2:23:01.240 --> 2:23:03.240]  All these people in the media want carnage.
[2:23:03.240 --> 2:23:04.240]  They want raceboards.
[2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:05.240]  They want riots.
[2:23:05.240 --> 2:23:07.240]  But they don't want to do it themselves.
[2:23:07.240 --> 2:23:08.240]  Hands up, don't shoot.
[2:23:08.240 --> 2:23:09.240]  That caused murders.
[2:23:09.240 --> 2:23:10.240]  The Ferguson effect called murder.
[2:23:10.240 --> 2:23:11.240]  A lot of cops have been killed.
[2:23:11.240 --> 2:23:13.240]  And they go, oh, you're kissing cops ass.
[2:23:13.240 --> 2:23:15.240]  No, the average cop doesn't deserve to be executed.
[2:23:15.240 --> 2:23:16.240]  Again, they take the fact
[2:23:16.240 --> 2:23:18.240]  that we're honest and have wide-form discussions.
[2:23:18.240 --> 2:23:20.240]  And they played a five-second clip
[2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:22.240]  where I'm saying Sandy Hook didn't happen.
[2:23:22.240 --> 2:23:24.240]  I went and gave them the full internet clip
[2:23:24.240 --> 2:23:26.240]  where I said, no, I can see how it totally did happen.
[2:23:26.240 --> 2:23:28.240]  But then I could see all this and see how it didn't.
[2:23:28.240 --> 2:23:30.240]  But they literally just take the fact
[2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:32.240]  that I'm honest and devil's advocate.
[2:23:32.240 --> 2:23:35.240]  And they edited it and tried to totally demonize me.
[2:23:35.240 --> 2:23:37.240]  Well, meanwhile, hands up, don't shoot.
[2:23:37.240 --> 2:23:38.240]  Why isn't there a segment?
[2:23:38.240 --> 2:23:40.240]  Megan Kelly interviewing Brian Stelter and CNN
[2:23:40.240 --> 2:23:42.240]  and all the liars who claim that their hands up
[2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:44.240]  don't shoot never happened.
[2:23:44.240 --> 2:23:46.240]  The fake news, the riots, the Ferguson effect.
[2:23:46.240 --> 2:23:48.240]  Police have told me now that they're afraid
[2:23:48.240 --> 2:23:50.240]  to police minority communities.
[2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:51.240]  Which is called massive deaths.
[2:23:51.240 --> 2:23:52.240]  Exactly.
[2:23:52.240 --> 2:23:53.240]  Let's go ahead and play my message.
[2:23:53.240 --> 2:23:54.240]  Where's the segment?
[2:23:54.240 --> 2:23:56.240]  Let's play my message to the New Town families.
[2:23:56.240 --> 2:23:58.240]  We wait for Megan to come back with Tom Brokaw.
[2:23:58.240 --> 2:24:03.240]  I mean, literally like dig a guy out of a crypt.
[2:24:03.240 --> 2:24:05.240]  He'll probably go, racist, racist,
[2:24:05.240 --> 2:24:06.240]  and I'm not supposed to follow my knees and go,
[2:24:06.240 --> 2:24:08.240]  no, not Tom Brokaw.
[2:24:08.240 --> 2:24:10.240]  So let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:14.240]  Here is my message to the New Town families.
[2:24:14.240 --> 2:24:18.240]  I woke up this morning on Father's Day
[2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:21.240]  and I was holding my young infant daughter in my arms,
[2:24:21.240 --> 2:24:24.240]  looking into her eyes.
[2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:27.240]  Sitting out on the back porch hearing the birds sing
[2:24:27.240 --> 2:24:29.240]  and it just brought tears to my eyes,
[2:24:29.240 --> 2:24:32.240]  thinking about all the parents that have lost their children
[2:24:32.240 --> 2:24:34.240]  on Father's Day or Mother's Day,
[2:24:34.240 --> 2:24:36.240]  who have to then think about that
[2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:40.240]  parents should never have to bury their own children.
[2:24:40.240 --> 2:24:42.240]  And that's why on Father's Day,
[2:24:42.240 --> 2:24:46.240]  I want to reach out to the parents of the slain children
[2:24:46.240 --> 2:24:49.240]  at the horrible tragedy in New Town, Connecticut,
[2:24:49.240 --> 2:24:53.240]  and give you my sincere condolences.
[2:24:53.240 --> 2:24:56.240]  I'd also like to reach out to any of the parents
[2:24:56.240 --> 2:24:58.240]  who have lost their child in New Town
[2:24:58.240 --> 2:25:02.240]  to invite them to contact me to open a dialogue
[2:25:02.240 --> 2:25:05.240]  because I think it's really essential we do that
[2:25:05.240 --> 2:25:08.240]  instead of letting the MSM misrepresent things
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:12.240]  and really try to drive this nation apart.
[2:25:12.240 --> 2:25:15.240]  Right now is the time for unity and peace
[2:25:15.240 --> 2:25:18.240]  in our country, I think now more than ever.
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:21.240]  Andrew Torba of gab.com, one of the more independent
[2:25:21.240 --> 2:25:24.240]  and the last liberal conservative you name and ideas
[2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:29.240]  on his site is joining us right now in studio
[2:25:29.240 --> 2:25:31.240]  watching this, the Megan Kelly,
[2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:33.240]  you're responsible, we've seen so far.
[2:25:33.240 --> 2:25:35.240]  So I think that it's pretty clear
[2:25:35.240 --> 2:25:37.240]  that there's a new media war happening
[2:25:37.240 --> 2:25:38.240]  and that we're winning.
[2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:40.240]  The alternative media is rising
[2:25:40.240 --> 2:25:42.240]  and whether it takes another year, another two years,
[2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:44.240]  another five years, the people have spoken
[2:25:44.240 --> 2:25:47.240]  and the populace are rising both in real life
[2:25:47.240 --> 2:25:48.240]  and on the internet.
[2:25:48.240 --> 2:25:50.240]  And I think that just the fact that they're giving you
[2:25:50.240 --> 2:25:52.240]  a platform and they're covering you
[2:25:52.240 --> 2:25:55.240]  shows that they're afraid of what we're building
[2:25:55.240 --> 2:25:57.240]  and alternative media.
[2:25:57.240 --> 2:25:59.240]  And like I've said, I'd love to build myself up.
[2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:01.240]  I'm not that good, none of us are.
[2:26:01.240 --> 2:26:04.240]  It's that they're that bad and just getting rid of us,
[2:26:04.240 --> 2:26:06.240]  the vacuum's still there.
[2:26:06.240 --> 2:26:09.240]  It's like if you had a submarine bulkhead open
[2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:12.240]  and the submarine's flooding, you don't just bail that water out
[2:26:12.240 --> 2:26:14.240]  and then the water stops flooding.
[2:26:14.240 --> 2:26:15.240]  You've got to close the bulkhead.
[2:26:15.240 --> 2:26:17.240]  But they're in action, they're lies.
[2:26:17.240 --> 2:26:19.240]  The fact the public doesn't believe them,
[2:26:19.240 --> 2:26:21.240]  that's why they're in so much trouble.
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:23.240]  Well, the people are looking for truth, right?
[2:26:23.240 --> 2:26:24.240]  They're looking for information.
[2:26:24.240 --> 2:26:26.240]  They're looking for alternative points of view.
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:28.240]  They're sick of seeing the same message,
[2:26:28.240 --> 2:26:30.240]  the same narrative over and over and over again
[2:26:30.240 --> 2:26:33.240]  on every channel, on every radio station,
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:35.240]  on every movie, anything.
[2:26:35.240 --> 2:26:36.240]  It's all of culture.
[2:26:36.240 --> 2:26:37.240]  They own it all.
[2:26:37.240 --> 2:26:39.240]  So people are looking for different outlets
[2:26:39.240 --> 2:26:41.240]  and we're filling those voids.
[2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:44.240]  So it's a cultural revolution right now
[2:26:44.240 --> 2:26:45.240]  and it's only expanding.
[2:26:45.240 --> 2:26:46.240]  It's not about conservative or liberal.
[2:26:46.240 --> 2:26:48.240]  I want to play out a clip, Mike Cernovich,
[2:26:48.240 --> 2:26:51.240]  what do you think now in hindsight,
[2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:55.240]  seeing most Kelly report more coming up with Tom Brokaw
[2:26:55.240 --> 2:26:58.240]  and the comedy doesn't end.
[2:26:58.240 --> 2:27:00.240]  I feel sorry for the families, everybody else,
[2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:03.240]  but when it comes to Tom Brokaw saying,
[2:27:03.240 --> 2:27:06.240]  I'm a KKK grand racket, this is some funny stuff.
[2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:12.240]  Please tell me some more absolutely ridiculous garbage.
[2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:15.240]  But expanding on this,
[2:27:15.240 --> 2:27:17.240]  what do you think their main mission was?
[2:27:17.240 --> 2:27:21.240]  Their main mission was to use you to attack Trump.
[2:27:21.240 --> 2:27:24.240]  Trump was the target and social media is the target.
[2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:27.240]  They want us banned from social media.
[2:27:27.240 --> 2:27:28.240]  They want us kicked off the internet.
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:29.240]  So it was a twofer.
[2:27:29.240 --> 2:27:31.240]  They wanted to go after Trump
[2:27:31.240 --> 2:27:33.240]  and they wanted to get people in no platform.
[2:27:33.240 --> 2:27:36.240]  That's why alternative platforms like gab.ai are important.
[2:27:36.240 --> 2:27:38.240]  That's why Trump should start a gab account
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:41.240]  because then all the media people would actually have to start.
[2:27:41.240 --> 2:27:42.240]  Exactly.
[2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:45.240]  If he started a gab account instead of having 25 million over there,
[2:27:45.240 --> 2:27:47.240]  he'd get 10 million over to gab.
[2:27:47.240 --> 2:27:48.240]  That's the real power.
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:51.240]  And then Twitter would be forced to respond.
[2:27:51.240 --> 2:27:52.240]  The media would freak out.
[2:27:52.240 --> 2:27:55.240]  So I think the biggest thing Trump could do,
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:57.240]  because we've talked about this before,
[2:27:57.240 --> 2:27:58.240]  his media team is terrible.
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:27:59.240]  His media team sucks.
[2:27:59.240 --> 2:28:02.240]  He needs to start a gab account and get on gab.
[2:28:02.240 --> 2:28:04.240]  Why not the fireside chats?
[2:28:04.240 --> 2:28:06.240]  I'd love to know.
[2:28:06.240 --> 2:28:10.240]  I mean, I know people who are saying,
[2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:12.240]  Don Jr. is doing great though.
[2:28:12.240 --> 2:28:14.240]  So Don Jr. is a tough guy.
[2:28:14.240 --> 2:28:16.240]  Yeah, so Don Jr. is doing the thing and doing the thing.
[2:28:16.240 --> 2:28:20.240]  But yeah, Trump Sr. needs to get a gab account, live stream.
[2:28:20.240 --> 2:28:23.240]  Because here's the thing about this hit piece on NBC.
[2:28:23.240 --> 2:28:25.240]  The sheep are just going to be sheep.
[2:28:25.240 --> 2:28:27.240]  But independent people are going to wake up.
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:30.240]  They're going to Google you and they're going to find the truth.
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:33.240]  That's the beauty of it is that the people who are going to hate you
[2:28:33.240 --> 2:28:35.240]  are always going to hate you.
[2:28:35.240 --> 2:28:38.240]  But there's going to be a million people now who are going to Google you
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:40.240]  and you can reach them directly through social media.
[2:28:40.240 --> 2:28:43.240]  Right now, those people are watching the YouTube live things.
[2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:47.240]  That's what most people can't comprehend in this old dinosaur media is that
[2:28:47.240 --> 2:28:49.240]  that segment from Megan Kelly is over.
[2:28:49.240 --> 2:28:51.240]  Now people are saying, well, that's interesting.
[2:28:51.240 --> 2:28:53.240]  Megan Kelly, NBC, what is really going on?
[2:28:53.240 --> 2:28:57.240]  They're now watching the YouTube, the Periscope, the Facebook Live.
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:28:59.240]  They are reading the articles.
[2:28:59.240 --> 2:29:01.240]  They're reading the social media.
[2:29:01.240 --> 2:29:03.240]  And that is where we're winning the information war.
[2:29:03.240 --> 2:29:05.240]  Absolutely. And the old media's scared.
[2:29:05.240 --> 2:29:07.240]  They want to demonize and lie about us and exaggerate.
[2:29:07.240 --> 2:29:10.240]  But the good news is it's the listeners that are the trailblazers
[2:29:10.240 --> 2:29:12.240]  that are awake and involved in form.
[2:29:12.240 --> 2:29:14.240]  And they're saying, well, it's a big game changer.
[2:29:14.240 --> 2:29:16.240]  And again, I say this every day, it's not a pat on the head.
[2:29:16.240 --> 2:29:18.240]  I can't believe you even put up with it.
[2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:20.240]  I mean, you are who are awesome.
[2:29:20.240 --> 2:29:22.240]  So we love you and we appreciate you.
[2:29:22.240 --> 2:29:24.240]  Let me play this little short.
[2:29:24.240 --> 2:29:26.240]  Well, Megan Kelly has inspired death threats against you.
[2:29:26.240 --> 2:29:28.240]  I hope after this show, someone shoots Alex Jones.
[2:29:28.240 --> 2:29:32.240]  So Megan Kelly, we are now demanding that you disavow the death threats
[2:29:32.240 --> 2:29:34.240]  that you've been talking about.
[2:29:34.240 --> 2:29:37.240]  Exactly, like after she did the show, people came and said, kill me.
[2:29:37.240 --> 2:29:39.240]  And it's Megan Kelly saying, kill me.
[2:29:39.240 --> 2:29:43.240]  I don't want to have to sue Megan Kelly for her making them say, kill me.
[2:29:43.240 --> 2:29:45.240]  Megan, why did you want them to kill me?
[2:29:45.240 --> 2:29:46.240]  Here's another one.
[2:29:46.240 --> 2:29:48.240]  Someone needs to shoot him in his fucking brains out.
[2:29:48.240 --> 2:29:50.240]  The dead man, Alex Jones, some info wars.
[2:29:50.240 --> 2:29:52.240]  Megan Kelly, you are responsible for this.
[2:29:52.240 --> 2:29:54.240]  I have my everything.
[2:29:54.240 --> 2:29:57.240]  By the way, haters and those of you out there who, you know, think you want up.
[2:29:57.240 --> 2:30:00.240]  Everything that you do against me is monitored in real time,
[2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:02.240]  all the time by intelligence people.
[2:30:02.240 --> 2:30:04.240]  This right here is intelligence people right now
[2:30:04.240 --> 2:30:06.240]  at levels you couldn't even comprehend.
[2:30:06.240 --> 2:30:09.240]  They're now monitoring the death threats against Alex Jones in real time.
[2:30:09.240 --> 2:30:12.240]  So I'm calling on Megan Kelly immediately.
[2:30:12.240 --> 2:30:15.240]  We need to do an emergency broadcast, a separate stream, a separate video.
[2:30:15.240 --> 2:30:17.240]  Because I am pretty sure.
[2:30:17.240 --> 2:30:20.240]  She needs to disavow the violence because we've already seen the congressman shot.
[2:30:20.240 --> 2:30:21.240]  And they will do it.
[2:30:21.240 --> 2:30:22.240]  The left's calling for violence.
[2:30:22.240 --> 2:30:26.240]  They're invoking this to say we're hurting children to try to create violence.
[2:30:26.240 --> 2:30:27.240]  And they will do it.
[2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:29.240]  And there was that shooting at the GOP Congress.
[2:30:29.240 --> 2:30:33.240]  So we need to do a separate emergency broadcast, emergency transmission.
[2:30:33.240 --> 2:30:34.240]  They're mad.
[2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:35.240]  They can't get our guns.
[2:30:35.240 --> 2:30:36.240]  They want that.
[2:30:36.240 --> 2:30:37.240]  She's trying to get you murdered.
[2:30:37.240 --> 2:30:41.240]  And she now has a duty and an obligation to disavow the death threats from her,
[2:30:41.240 --> 2:30:43.240]  her viewers right now.
[2:30:43.240 --> 2:30:47.240]  I don't know why she would send people to stalk media and call for death.
[2:30:47.240 --> 2:30:48.240]  Yeah.
[2:30:48.240 --> 2:30:49.240]  And this is on her now.
[2:30:49.240 --> 2:30:51.240]  So we need to demand a statement from Megan Kelly.
[2:30:51.240 --> 2:30:54.240]  I want to know it because if she does right now, she is set on TV.
[2:30:54.240 --> 2:30:56.240]  What you say has consequences.
[2:30:56.240 --> 2:31:01.240]  Well, right now in real time, people are making death threats because of Megan Kelly's hit piece.
[2:31:01.240 --> 2:31:04.240]  This means that we're going to play this tape so we can get those clips.
[2:31:04.240 --> 2:31:08.240]  Those tweets and put them up for everybody right now.
[2:31:08.240 --> 2:31:10.240]  So folks can see that while we're streaming live.
[2:31:10.240 --> 2:31:14.240]  Again, the active resistance is to stream these articles, these videos, these links,
[2:31:14.240 --> 2:31:16.240]  infowars.com, hordeslastshow.
[2:31:16.240 --> 2:31:21.240]  I want to play my message to fathers on Father's Day and a message of peaceful,
[2:31:21.240 --> 2:31:23.240]  awakening resistance that we're going to come back.
[2:31:23.240 --> 2:31:28.240]  And then we should have Tom Brokaw, who they've trying to reanimate right now,
[2:31:28.240 --> 2:31:30.240]  who's about to attack us in closing.
[2:31:30.240 --> 2:31:31.240]  Here it is.
[2:31:31.240 --> 2:31:38.240]  By design on Father's Day, the corporate media that's led us all into these illegal wars,
[2:31:38.240 --> 2:31:43.240]  that has attempted to bankrupt our country, that has foisted Obamacare on our backs,
[2:31:43.240 --> 2:31:49.240]  this pack of bloodthirsty liars are going to try to misrepresent what I've said and what I've done
[2:31:49.240 --> 2:31:55.240]  in my media career as I've attempted to restore our republic so that they can project
[2:31:55.240 --> 2:32:01.240]  the made-up garbage they're going to put out, not just on me, but you as fathers.
[2:32:01.240 --> 2:32:04.240]  Megan Kelly promised me this wasn't airing on Father's Day.
[2:32:04.240 --> 2:32:06.240]  That it was going to be airing in July.
[2:32:06.240 --> 2:32:12.240]  But I knew they were going to try to scapegoat fathers by first demonizing me
[2:32:12.240 --> 2:32:17.240]  because they were obsessed with fatherhood and children and then brought up Newtown
[2:32:17.240 --> 2:32:23.240]  and all this other stuff to make me look like a demon so they can make all fathers look bad.
[2:32:23.240 --> 2:32:28.240]  This is a way to manipulate the heartstrings of the American people
[2:32:28.240 --> 2:32:30.240]  and on Father's Day to drive another wedge.
[2:32:30.240 --> 2:32:31.240]  But look at Hollywood.
[2:32:31.240 --> 2:32:32.240]  Look at Viacom.
[2:32:32.240 --> 2:32:36.240]  Look at NBC and CBS and CNN, all of them.
[2:32:36.240 --> 2:32:37.240]  It's a constant anti-family.
[2:32:37.240 --> 2:32:39.240]  It's a constant anti-father.
[2:32:39.240 --> 2:32:40.240]  Look at the sitcoms.
[2:32:40.240 --> 2:32:41.240]  Look at the dramas.
[2:32:41.240 --> 2:32:44.240]  Look at the TV ads where they tell you fathers are bad.
[2:32:44.240 --> 2:32:48.240]  This is an attack on the family and an attack on civilization
[2:32:48.240 --> 2:32:50.240]  and a giant evil misrepresentation.
[2:32:50.240 --> 2:32:54.240]  How dare them distort and edit my views on Newtown and other events.
[2:32:54.240 --> 2:33:00.240]  And the last two years never run any of the videos I've put out saying I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[2:33:00.240 --> 2:33:04.240]  They continue to misrepresent what I've said and what I've done
[2:33:04.240 --> 2:33:07.240]  and they've said questioning is basically illegal.
[2:33:07.240 --> 2:33:10.240]  They've said info wars is a virus.
[2:33:10.240 --> 2:33:15.240]  But they also again say that the family is a threat to the state's total control.
[2:33:15.240 --> 2:33:17.240]  So know this, fathers.
[2:33:17.240 --> 2:33:21.240]  The Clintons, the Obamas, the globalists have fun at the Arab Spring.
[2:33:21.240 --> 2:33:23.240]  The enslavement of countless men, women and children.
[2:33:23.240 --> 2:33:27.240]  They have launched sanctions on Iraq to kill over half a million Iraqis.
[2:33:27.240 --> 2:33:28.240]  They're the killers.
[2:33:28.240 --> 2:33:29.240]  They're the murderers.
[2:33:29.240 --> 2:33:33.240]  And so on this Father's Day, men across the world must come together
[2:33:33.240 --> 2:33:37.240]  of every race, color, and creed and realize men are under attack.
[2:33:37.240 --> 2:33:38.240]  Women are under attack.
[2:33:38.240 --> 2:33:39.240]  Children are under attack.
[2:33:39.240 --> 2:33:41.240]  Humanities in a crisis.
[2:33:41.240 --> 2:33:45.240]  These social engineers are playing God and they are trying to divide and conquer us
[2:33:45.240 --> 2:33:48.240]  and men must awaken and break the conditioning
[2:33:48.240 --> 2:33:50.240]  and not care what the MSM says anymore
[2:33:50.240 --> 2:33:55.240]  and move forward to return humanity to its basic equilibrium
[2:33:55.240 --> 2:34:00.240]  between men, women, and children and a culture built for, of, and by humans.
[2:34:00.240 --> 2:34:02.240]  The future does need people.
[2:34:02.240 --> 2:34:04.240]  We don't need to be replaced by robots.
[2:34:04.240 --> 2:34:05.240]  We're not failed.
[2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:06.240]  We're not evil.
[2:34:06.240 --> 2:34:08.240]  And we don't need the globalists to play God anymore.
[2:34:08.240 --> 2:34:13.240]  It's time for the mass awakening that's already been taking place to accelerate.
[2:34:13.240 --> 2:34:18.240]  The globalists are attacking men because they know historically and genetically
[2:34:18.240 --> 2:34:22.240]  it is the men that defend the tribe and defend the people.
[2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:26.240]  It's time to get past the media hype that led us to all these wars
[2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:30.240]  and led us into globalism and led us into the sexualization of our children
[2:34:30.240 --> 2:34:33.240]  and the attack on God and to break with the globalists
[2:34:33.240 --> 2:34:35.240]  and realize they're an enemy of humanity.
[2:34:35.240 --> 2:34:39.240]  On this Father's Day, men, it's time to stand up, speak out,
[2:34:39.240 --> 2:34:42.240]  and take action against the globalists in the information war
[2:34:42.240 --> 2:34:46.240]  and with the decisions you make every day with the financial actions you take.
[2:34:46.240 --> 2:34:48.240]  Humanity is on the march.
[2:34:48.240 --> 2:34:50.240]  The globalists are trying to put us back in our place
[2:34:50.240 --> 2:34:54.240]  and intimidate the leaders of the resistance, and it's not working.
[2:34:54.240 --> 2:34:56.240]  It's only made me redouble my efforts and understand
[2:34:56.240 --> 2:34:59.240]  that we've got to absolutely take it to the next level
[2:34:59.240 --> 2:35:02.240]  because the globalists are just as evil as our research showed.
[2:35:02.240 --> 2:35:04.240]  In fact, they're worse.
[2:35:04.240 --> 2:35:08.240]  So on this Father's Day, 2017, we take the corporate holiday
[2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:13.240]  and we return it to humanity and declare it human day,
[2:35:13.240 --> 2:35:17.240]  freedom day, resistance day, awakening day.
[2:35:17.240 --> 2:35:19.240]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:21.240]  We'll be live until past eight o'clock tonight,
[2:35:21.240 --> 2:35:24.240]  countering Megan Kelly, NBC, and the globalist.
[2:35:24.240 --> 2:35:26.240]  And again, if you're watching this transmission,
[2:35:26.240 --> 2:35:40.240]  you are the hope, you are the resistance.
[2:35:40.240 --> 2:35:44.240]  The Queen of Fake News, Megan Kelly is getting ready to attack
[2:35:44.240 --> 2:35:49.240]  with Tom Brokaw, the crib keeper.
[2:35:49.240 --> 2:35:52.240]  All I can do is give you my word and tell you,
[2:35:52.240 --> 2:35:54.240]  if there's one thing about me, I do what I say I'm going to do
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:56.240]  and I don't double cross.
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:35:58.240]  It's not going to be some gotcha hit piece.
[2:35:58.240 --> 2:35:59.240]  I promise you that.
[2:35:59.240 --> 2:36:01.240]  They call you the most paranoid man in America.
[2:36:01.240 --> 2:36:02.240]  Is that true?
[2:36:02.240 --> 2:36:05.240]  So it's like an investigative report in the fake news.
[2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:07.240]  No, no.
[2:36:07.240 --> 2:36:09.240]  What we're doing?
[2:36:09.240 --> 2:36:11.240]  Yeah, come on.
[2:36:11.240 --> 2:36:13.240]  No, no, no, no.
[2:36:13.240 --> 2:36:15.240]  But just, you know, like all the Sandy Hook things,
[2:36:15.240 --> 2:36:17.240]  I've had debates where I've shown both sides
[2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:19.240]  when I go back and forth, but I believe people died there.
[2:36:19.240 --> 2:36:24.240]  When you say parents faked their children's death,
[2:36:24.240 --> 2:36:26.240]  people get very angry.
[2:36:26.240 --> 2:36:28.240]  She didn't show in her promo video that I said,
[2:36:28.240 --> 2:36:31.240]  I believe Sandy Hook happened.
[2:36:31.240 --> 2:36:34.240]  You know, you just became very fascinating to me.
[2:36:34.240 --> 2:36:37.240]  I just sort of thought you were this maybe, you know,
[2:36:37.240 --> 2:36:39.240]  one dimensional guy, like this was your thing.
[2:36:39.240 --> 2:36:43.240]  My goal is for your listeners and the left, you know,
[2:36:43.240 --> 2:36:46.240]  who will be watching some on NBC to say,
[2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:48.240]  wow, that was really interesting.
[2:36:48.240 --> 2:36:51.240]  The media never covers all the evil wars it's promoted.
[2:36:51.240 --> 2:36:54.240]  That doesn't excuse what you did and said about Newtown.
[2:36:54.240 --> 2:36:55.240]  Here's the difference.
[2:36:55.240 --> 2:36:57.240]  I promise you when it's over, you'll say,
[2:36:57.240 --> 2:36:59.240]  absolutely, she did what she said she was going to do.
[2:36:59.240 --> 2:37:01.240]  And you'll be fine with that.
[2:37:01.240 --> 2:37:04.240]  I'm not looking to portray you as some bookie man or,
[2:37:04.240 --> 2:37:06.240]  you know, do any sort of about your moment.
[2:37:06.240 --> 2:37:08.240]  Sandy Hook, 9-11.
[2:37:08.240 --> 2:37:09.240]  That's a dodge.
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:11.240]  I just want to talk about you.
[2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:13.240]  I want people to get to know you.
[2:37:13.240 --> 2:37:16.240]  And the craziest thing of all would be if some of the people
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:18.240]  who have this, you know, insane version of you in their heads
[2:37:18.240 --> 2:37:21.240]  walk away saying, you know what?
[2:37:21.240 --> 2:37:23.240]  I see like the dad in him.
[2:37:23.240 --> 2:37:25.240]  I see the guy who loves those kids
[2:37:25.240 --> 2:37:28.240]  and who is more complex than I've been led to believe.
[2:37:28.240 --> 2:37:30.240]  We didn't get any of the really important stuff.
[2:37:30.240 --> 2:37:32.240]  What do you mean we talked about all the important stuff?
[2:37:32.240 --> 2:37:35.240]  This is not going to be a contentious, you know,
[2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:38.240]  sort of gotcha exchange.
[2:37:38.240 --> 2:37:40.240]  If I didn't take the challenge,
[2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:43.240]  then good, or at least an open heart,
[2:37:43.240 --> 2:37:46.240]  would be hiding from evil.
[2:37:48.240 --> 2:37:50.240]  Son of a media.
[2:37:50.240 --> 2:37:52.240]  All right, folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[2:37:52.240 --> 2:37:54.240]  Mike Sternberg is about 20 minutes going to take over
[2:37:54.240 --> 2:37:56.240]  for this cohort here and give the number out if you want
[2:37:56.240 --> 2:37:58.240]  and take calls, a lot of clips to get to.
[2:37:58.240 --> 2:38:02.240]  We've got the champagne out yet because even Brian Stelter
[2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:04.240]  is saying we won tonight.
[2:38:04.240 --> 2:38:06.240]  Because of the editing, actually.
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:10.240]  So the Washington Post media columnist and former public editor
[2:38:10.240 --> 2:38:14.240]  of the New York Times said that because they edited it so strongly
[2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:17.240]  that this is going to give you information
[2:38:17.240 --> 2:38:19.240]  to use against the media, they actually edited it.
[2:38:19.240 --> 2:38:23.240]  So these idiots, they went, if you edit too much,
[2:38:23.240 --> 2:38:25.240]  then the people can tell like the jump cuts.
[2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:27.240]  So you would talk and then be like, whoa, whoa.
[2:38:27.240 --> 2:38:29.240]  It looked like a PewDiePie video.
[2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:31.240]  Yeah, because I would go, I don't think, you know,
[2:38:31.240 --> 2:38:33.240]  they're covering up, but everybody questioned it.
[2:38:33.240 --> 2:38:36.240]  I didn't create it, you know, before the media ever attacked me.
[2:38:36.240 --> 2:38:38.240]  I said, I thought Sandy Hook happened.
[2:38:38.240 --> 2:38:39.240]  They wouldn't show that.
[2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:41.240]  They would just cut it all like scrambled up.
[2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:43.240]  It looks like the people are seeing through this too.
[2:38:43.240 --> 2:38:44.240]  I have a tweet here.
[2:38:44.240 --> 2:38:46.240]  Alex Jones, I wasn't the big fan of yours before
[2:38:46.240 --> 2:38:48.240]  after the interview with Megan Kelly.
[2:38:48.240 --> 2:38:49.240]  I'm now your biggest fan.
[2:38:49.240 --> 2:38:51.240]  It's got 200 retweets so far, 13 minutes ago.
[2:38:51.240 --> 2:38:53.240]  Well, I mean, I don't think we're just putting a good face on this.
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:38:56.240]  I'm shocked because I'm like a walrus or something.
[2:38:56.240 --> 2:38:58.240]  I can't believe they're so easy to defeat.
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:00.240]  I think this signifies how pathetic they are.
[2:39:00.240 --> 2:39:02.240]  We're waiting for her to come back at the end with Tom Brokaw
[2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:04.240]  to talk about this courage.
[2:39:04.240 --> 2:39:06.240]  She has to fight me.
[2:39:06.240 --> 2:39:08.240]  But are you guys, but listen to this.
[2:39:08.240 --> 2:39:12.240]  And the great crew that's up here working late on Sunday night.
[2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:15.240]  She's the one that said it wasn't a hit piece and promise
[2:39:15.240 --> 2:39:16.240]  and told all these lies.
[2:39:16.240 --> 2:39:18.240]  So they threw her against Trump.
[2:39:18.240 --> 2:39:19.240]  Now they're throwing her against me.
[2:39:19.240 --> 2:39:22.240]  Doesn't she get they're sending her on common cause emissions?
[2:39:22.240 --> 2:39:24.240]  Well, she even, you know, called this out.
[2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:25.240]  She said, you know, if I do this to you,
[2:39:25.240 --> 2:39:27.240]  who's going to want to do an interview with me?
[2:39:27.240 --> 2:39:29.240]  So now everybody that has seen this,
[2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:31.240]  anybody that's going to be potentially interviewed by her
[2:39:31.240 --> 2:39:33.240]  in the future, they're going to say, well, no, wait a minute.
[2:39:33.240 --> 2:39:34.240]  I saw what you did to Alex Jones.
[2:39:34.240 --> 2:39:37.240]  So why am I going to give you the time of day?
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:38.240]  Our next interview.
[2:39:38.240 --> 2:39:41.240]  She may just bring like a whole heat lamp bill from McDonald's.
[2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:44.240]  Well, we're going to have to write a playbook out actually,
[2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:46.240]  because the, um, the only,
[2:39:46.240 --> 2:39:49.240]  the only thing I thought in there that made you look bad was
[2:39:49.240 --> 2:39:50.240]  they got the heat lamp on you.
[2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:52.240]  So that is add that to your media.
[2:39:52.240 --> 2:39:55.240]  So those of you watching at home, add that to your media check.
[2:39:55.240 --> 2:39:57.240]  Have you noticed I'm outside in 90 degree weather
[2:39:57.240 --> 2:39:59.240]  and I'm not sweating, but there it was like, why is it?
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:00.240]  And I think you're right.
[2:40:00.240 --> 2:40:03.240]  It was like the heat was like, and it was cool.
[2:40:03.240 --> 2:40:04.240]  It wasn't really hot the rest of the house,
[2:40:04.240 --> 2:40:05.240]  but right there it was so hot.
[2:40:05.240 --> 2:40:08.240]  Exactly. So they, they, they made it look like it was overhead lighting.
[2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:09.240]  And then what happened?
[2:40:09.240 --> 2:40:10.240]  It was a heat lamp.
[2:40:10.240 --> 2:40:12.240]  It was like a red, red heat lamp.
[2:40:12.240 --> 2:40:15.240]  Oh, she's back when broke off with times.
[2:40:15.240 --> 2:40:16.240]  Tom.
[2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:17.240]  Thank you, Megan.
[2:40:17.240 --> 2:40:20.240]  This is not an easy assignment for a journalist,
[2:40:20.240 --> 2:40:27.240]  a father, a grandfather, a citizen to try to understand the deep dark hate
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:29.240]  that's coursing through our country.
[2:40:29.240 --> 2:40:34.240]  And the instruments that spread it with a keystroke when the internet first
[2:40:34.240 --> 2:40:35.240]  arrived, like everyone else.
[2:40:35.240 --> 2:40:38.240]  He runs around and kills everybody.
[2:40:38.240 --> 2:40:39.240]  For good.
[2:40:39.240 --> 2:40:44.240]  And those qualities have only become so much more effective and pervasive.
[2:40:44.240 --> 2:40:47.240]  But I was also quickly aware of the underside,
[2:40:47.240 --> 2:40:50.240]  the seizure of the net by hate groups of all kinds.
[2:40:50.240 --> 2:40:51.240]  He's a hate group.
[2:40:51.240 --> 2:40:52.240]  But he is a hate group.
[2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:53.240]  I wonder if he's going to introduce someone like Harman,
[2:40:53.240 --> 2:40:55.240]  or the Kripper does.
[2:40:55.240 --> 2:40:58.240]  I did two documentaries at the turn of the century called
[2:40:58.240 --> 2:41:02.240]  The Web of Hate, hoping to slow that trend.
[2:41:02.240 --> 2:41:08.240]  But the reach and the poisonous claims of Alex Jones and others like him,
[2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:12.240]  and even establishment public figures would not be slowed.
[2:41:12.240 --> 2:41:17.240]  We cannot disrupt the irrational spread of hate and division by instantly
[2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:20.240]  blindly blaming the other side.
[2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:22.240]  They rolled him out.
[2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:26.240]  The parents of Newtown.
[2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:30.240]  It's not enough to say, I cannot imagine.
[2:41:30.240 --> 2:41:35.240]  Because unless we're the parents, we can never, ever share the unremitting
[2:41:35.240 --> 2:41:38.240]  pain, the lifelong loss and anger.
[2:41:38.240 --> 2:41:40.240]  And they chose Father's Day.
[2:41:40.240 --> 2:41:44.240]  Nor should they have to hear the cruel claim that it was a lie.
[2:41:44.240 --> 2:41:45.240]  Nobody's even watching now, though.
[2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:46.240]  People tuned out.
[2:41:46.240 --> 2:41:50.240]  No parent or grandparent in America today can escape the fear,
[2:41:50.240 --> 2:41:53.240]  the fear that it could happen again.
[2:41:53.240 --> 2:41:54.240]  No, they want to go.
[2:41:54.240 --> 2:41:58.240]  We cannot allow the agents of hate to go on challenge and become the
[2:41:58.240 --> 2:41:59.240]  imprint of our time.
[2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:01.240]  They keep bringing Newtown up.
[2:42:01.240 --> 2:42:02.240]  They're the ones.
[2:42:02.240 --> 2:42:06.240]  All the differences, of course, but in our finest moments were a republic
[2:42:06.240 --> 2:42:12.240]  that thrives when it recognizes common threats and takes them on.
[2:42:12.240 --> 2:42:13.240]  That's time.
[2:42:13.240 --> 2:42:14.240]  Common threats.
[2:42:14.240 --> 2:42:15.240]  Now, again.
[2:42:15.240 --> 2:42:16.240]  Free speech.
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:21.240]  This is the time of common threats requiring uncommon courage.
[2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:24.240]  It is a time to step up.
[2:42:24.240 --> 2:42:26.240]  And read off teleprompters.
[2:42:26.240 --> 2:42:27.240]  What a dork.
[2:42:27.240 --> 2:42:28.240]  That's embarrassing.
[2:42:28.240 --> 2:42:29.240]  That's embarrassing.
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:30.240]  They are laying the groundwork.
[2:42:30.240 --> 2:42:31.240]  I'd be humiliated.
[2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:32.240]  They're getting ready.
[2:42:32.240 --> 2:42:33.240]  They're getting ready.
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:34.240]  This is laying the groundwork.
[2:42:34.240 --> 2:42:35.240]  Let me tell you.
[2:42:35.240 --> 2:42:38.240]  They want to do a false flag on Newtown, a real one, and then say we
[2:42:38.240 --> 2:42:40.240]  inspired it, just like the pizza place.
[2:42:40.240 --> 2:42:42.240]  Just all this crap, because we're like covering real hardcore
[2:42:42.240 --> 2:42:46.240]  Podesta emails where clearly kids are involved and we have Wiener and
[2:42:46.240 --> 2:42:47.240]  Sexting and we break all that.
[2:42:47.240 --> 2:42:48.240]  They're panicking.
[2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:50.240]  So I saw New York Times, Washington Post.
[2:42:50.240 --> 2:42:54.240]  I'm walking through the hotel in Cancun, took off a week.
[2:42:54.240 --> 2:42:57.240]  And I'm seeing pizza place, the focus of WikiLeaks.
[2:42:57.240 --> 2:42:59.240]  And so I started watching the crew's reports.
[2:42:59.240 --> 2:43:02.240]  They're not bad, but they're reporting on what the news focused on.
[2:43:02.240 --> 2:43:06.240]  I call them and I go, I think this is a diversion from the real stuff
[2:43:06.240 --> 2:43:08.240]  in the emails, this pizza place.
[2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:11.240]  Because it was all FBI code words for pizza and all this stuff.
[2:43:11.240 --> 2:43:13.240]  That was separate the pizza place.
[2:43:13.240 --> 2:43:14.240]  And sure enough, I was proven right.
[2:43:14.240 --> 2:43:16.240]  They got pissed that I did that.
[2:43:16.240 --> 2:43:20.240]  So they turned it all around and made it look like I was weak.
[2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:21.240]  Well, everybody was covering it.
[2:43:21.240 --> 2:43:22.240]  Because I've been exposing it.
[2:43:22.240 --> 2:43:23.240]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2:43:23.240 --> 2:43:24.240]  It wasn't just you.
[2:43:24.240 --> 2:43:25.240]  Everybody was covering this.
[2:43:25.240 --> 2:43:26.240]  This was in the Washington Post and New York Times.
[2:43:26.240 --> 2:43:31.240]  It wasn't like, they made it seem like you were the only person talking about this.
[2:43:31.240 --> 2:43:35.240]  So why have they, maybe they chose me because I am actually weak.
[2:43:35.240 --> 2:43:36.240]  Well, I think it's not.
[2:43:36.240 --> 2:43:37.240]  No, no, maybe it is not bad.
[2:43:37.240 --> 2:43:38.240]  I don't want to be serious.
[2:43:38.240 --> 2:43:39.240]  I don't want to be on a power trip here.
[2:43:39.240 --> 2:43:40.240]  Okay.
[2:43:40.240 --> 2:43:41.240]  I know we have a big audience.
[2:43:41.240 --> 2:43:42.240]  Okay.
[2:43:42.240 --> 2:43:45.240]  But why are they always choose me to be attacked?
[2:43:45.240 --> 2:43:48.240]  I mean, maybe it's that I give them the ammo because I do say a lot of free form stuff
[2:43:48.240 --> 2:43:49.240]  and they can clip it together.
[2:43:49.240 --> 2:43:53.240]  But then I can't start censoring what I say because they're going to edit it.
[2:43:53.240 --> 2:43:57.240]  I mean, Hillary Clinton is a mass murdering witch who put radical Islamists in charge
[2:43:57.240 --> 2:44:00.240]  in Libya, Syria and other countries and bragged about it.
[2:44:00.240 --> 2:44:04.240]  She is personally responsible for the murder and sexual enslavement of tens of thousands
[2:44:04.240 --> 2:44:05.240]  of women and children.
[2:44:05.240 --> 2:44:09.240]  Now they're going to edit that and say that I said she was raping them with a damn turkey
[2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:11.240]  baster in the bottom of a pizza place.
[2:44:11.240 --> 2:44:12.240]  It isn't true.
[2:44:12.240 --> 2:44:13.240]  I didn't say that.
[2:44:13.240 --> 2:44:15.240]  And I told Megan Kelly that.
[2:44:15.240 --> 2:44:21.240]  Well, I was actually told by my sources in the intelligence community that the by, by
[2:44:21.240 --> 2:44:26.240]  reshifting the narrative away from the pedophiles, because as we know, the UN was caught in a
[2:44:26.240 --> 2:44:27.240]  pedophile scandal.
[2:44:27.240 --> 2:44:28.240]  Oh, yeah.
[2:44:28.240 --> 2:44:29.240]  They're all over.
[2:44:29.240 --> 2:44:33.240]  I've had all the high level FBI CIA call them go, Alex, you're wrong.
[2:44:33.240 --> 2:44:34.240]  It's all fake.
[2:44:34.240 --> 2:44:36.240]  And I'm like, but I can't prove that.
[2:44:36.240 --> 2:44:37.240]  So stop it.
[2:44:37.240 --> 2:44:38.240]  Right.
[2:44:38.240 --> 2:44:41.240]  So they, what they want to do is they want the media is covering up for pedophilia just
[2:44:41.240 --> 2:44:42.240]  like they covered up Jimmy Seville.
[2:44:42.240 --> 2:44:44.240]  Oh, they're saying it doesn't exist now.
[2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:45.240]  Yeah.
[2:44:45.240 --> 2:44:47.240]  Well, they said that it should be treated like a disorder.
[2:44:47.240 --> 2:44:50.240]  So the media is going after anybody who covers pedophilia.
[2:44:50.240 --> 2:44:55.240]  I mean, if you never tried to cover and expose pedophilia, they, they, here's what they say
[2:44:55.240 --> 2:44:56.240]  about me.
[2:44:56.240 --> 2:44:59.240]  They go, why are you obsessed with pedophiles in DC?
[2:44:59.240 --> 2:45:01.240]  And I go, why are you not?
[2:45:01.240 --> 2:45:02.240]  Why are you not upset?
[2:45:02.240 --> 2:45:05.240]  Remember, remember, I was on the air 20 years ago, 22.
[2:45:05.240 --> 2:45:09.740]  And like the first five, six, seven years was like conspiracy theorists claim Catholic
[2:45:09.740 --> 2:45:13.840]  priests are raping people turned out it was from the highest levels all orchestrated by
[2:45:13.840 --> 2:45:18.240]  an outside group coming in and using it as an intelligence op to take over the Catholic
[2:45:18.240 --> 2:45:19.240]  church.
[2:45:19.240 --> 2:45:20.240]  They're not.
[2:45:20.240 --> 2:45:21.240]  It was all true.
[2:45:21.240 --> 2:45:23.240]  How many conspiracy theories try to be totally true?
[2:45:23.240 --> 2:45:24.680]  That's the problem.
[2:45:24.680 --> 2:45:27.880]  They don't want you to know the truth, just like they don't want you to know that the
[2:45:27.880 --> 2:45:29.980]  Clintons were selling children in Haiti.
[2:45:29.980 --> 2:45:34.680]  That was why they, we sent, we sent Joe Biggs and Michael Zimmerman there over a year ago,
[2:45:34.680 --> 2:45:35.840]  and then it all turned out to be true.
[2:45:35.840 --> 2:45:37.240]  They were coming back like, yeah, they're running kids.
[2:45:37.240 --> 2:45:38.880]  I'm like, we can't even go with this.
[2:45:38.880 --> 2:45:39.880]  I was like, how do we prove it?
[2:45:39.880 --> 2:45:42.240]  We, we had the witnesses, but now it's all confirmed.
[2:45:42.240 --> 2:45:43.240]  Yeah.
[2:45:43.240 --> 2:45:47.240]  So big, big AP report, but do we get awards for, oh, back to Megan Kelly.
[2:45:47.240 --> 2:45:48.240]  Sorry.
[2:45:48.240 --> 2:45:49.240]  She was separated or divorced.
[2:45:49.240 --> 2:45:50.240]  Check.
[2:45:50.240 --> 2:45:52.520]  Living with an alcoholic or a drug user.
[2:45:52.520 --> 2:45:53.520]  Check.
[2:45:53.520 --> 2:45:54.520]  Watching a loved one.
[2:45:54.520 --> 2:46:01.280]  Well, I got to tell you, Megan Kelly, I don't want to run her down, but she looked like
[2:46:01.280 --> 2:46:02.880]  what I heard from inside sources.
[2:46:02.880 --> 2:46:03.880]  She is freaked out.
[2:46:03.880 --> 2:46:05.680]  Why do you think so?
[2:46:05.680 --> 2:46:06.680]  Because you're winning.
[2:46:06.680 --> 2:46:07.680]  That's why.
[2:46:07.680 --> 2:46:08.680]  Because you caught her on her toes.
[2:46:08.680 --> 2:46:12.000]  You have that recorded audio where she says, Hey, I'm not going to do this and then goes
[2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:14.400]  ahead and does exactly what you said she was going to do.
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:15.400]  So what do I do?
[2:46:15.400 --> 2:46:17.480]  Let's say I've got eight hours, which is what we've got roughly.
[2:46:17.480 --> 2:46:20.320]  But the problem is I've got to listen to it, but I'll be honest, because I kind of want
[2:46:20.320 --> 2:46:21.320]  to cover my butt.
[2:46:21.320 --> 2:46:24.200]  What if something got weird said by me, people are saying, you know, where is it?
[2:46:24.200 --> 2:46:27.040]  Well, I mean, we don't have a big operation, but you know what?
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:30.240]  In the nature of this, to be fair, I'm just going to start releasing an hour a day.
[2:46:30.240 --> 2:46:31.400]  I'm not even going to listen to it.
[2:46:31.400 --> 2:46:32.400]  Crowdsource it.
[2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:33.400]  Let the crowd figure it out.
[2:46:33.400 --> 2:46:35.840]  The crowd will find the best parts and edit the clips together.
[2:46:35.840 --> 2:46:40.160]  The meme, the meme veterans will go out there and do the work for you.
[2:46:40.160 --> 2:46:41.160]  I'll be honest.
[2:46:41.160 --> 2:46:42.600]  Don't you think it's kind of a nothing burger?
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:44.560]  I feel like it was part of like Al Capone's vault.
[2:46:44.560 --> 2:46:46.680]  I mean, it was interesting to watch them melting down.
[2:46:46.680 --> 2:46:50.600]  But her supposed get me report, you know, Q and they're got like 40 texts.
[2:46:50.600 --> 2:46:51.600]  Everybody texts him.
[2:46:51.600 --> 2:46:52.600]  So this was nothing.
[2:46:52.600 --> 2:46:53.600]  Right.
[2:46:53.600 --> 2:46:54.600]  Yeah.
[2:46:54.600 --> 2:46:55.600]  It was actually a little disappointing.
[2:46:55.600 --> 2:46:58.440]  I thought we were going to have the Super Bowl, but they overedited it, which was a tactical
[2:46:58.440 --> 2:46:59.440]  mistake.
[2:46:59.440 --> 2:47:00.960]  And even NSM is admitting that.
[2:47:00.960 --> 2:47:01.960]  Yeah.
[2:47:01.960 --> 2:47:05.280]  So if what I would have done, if I want to do a hit piece on you is the jump cuts were
[2:47:05.280 --> 2:47:06.280]  too obvious.
[2:47:06.280 --> 2:47:07.280]  Okay.
[2:47:07.280 --> 2:47:10.480]  If you're going to, so here, fake news, I know you're all watching right now.
[2:47:10.480 --> 2:47:14.880]  If you're going to do a hit piece on people, don't do jump cuts like your YouTube, like
[2:47:14.880 --> 2:47:17.320]  a sub PewDiePie video or something like that.
[2:47:17.320 --> 2:47:18.320]  You can edit.
[2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:22.120]  You can pull the little clips, but when you do the jump cuts like you did tonight, all
[2:47:22.120 --> 2:47:25.080]  people are saying is, well, wait a minute, that doesn't actually look right.
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:28.320]  And then of course, my advice always to people who, if you ever do take an interview with
[2:47:28.320 --> 2:47:32.960]  the fake news, gesticulate often because that's how you spot the jump cut.
[2:47:32.960 --> 2:47:35.480]  So what a lot of people do is they'll sit and they'll talk.
[2:47:35.480 --> 2:47:38.280]  No, you have to move your hands around a lot like Gowdston.
[2:47:38.280 --> 2:47:39.920]  That interview was masterful.
[2:47:39.920 --> 2:47:43.600]  Oh, give me a break when that was when it went, when you're moving around like that.
[2:47:43.600 --> 2:47:45.840]  So he'll be, I was sitting up and doing this on purpose.
[2:47:45.840 --> 2:47:46.840]  Exactly.
[2:47:46.840 --> 2:47:50.120]  That, that takes away their ability to use jump cuts.
[2:47:50.120 --> 2:47:54.280]  So, and we all started out going, I believe Sandy Hook happened, they lied about babies
[2:47:54.280 --> 2:47:55.280]  and incubators.
[2:47:55.280 --> 2:47:57.520]  So everybody has a right to question it was my listeners that question it.
[2:47:57.520 --> 2:47:58.520]  I don't blame them.
[2:47:58.520 --> 2:48:00.640]  They have a right to question it, but I believe it happened.
[2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:01.640]  None of that.
[2:48:01.640 --> 2:48:02.640]  Right.
[2:48:02.640 --> 2:48:03.640]  Exactly.
[2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:04.640]  I'll tell you, this was nothing for them, but this was a huge win for you guys.
[2:48:04.640 --> 2:48:06.720]  This is a huge win for alternative media.
[2:48:06.720 --> 2:48:10.120]  You guys probably got, you know, a million new people that have never heard of info wars
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:14.320]  that are now on the website today right now, but yeah, exactly.
[2:48:14.320 --> 2:48:17.720]  So look at these, look at this stuff, the 30% of showbodies work force, a Muslim owned
[2:48:17.720 --> 2:48:21.880]  company consists of Muslim refugees, soldiers for Allah, resettling America.
[2:48:21.880 --> 2:48:22.880]  I'm reading a tweet.
[2:48:22.880 --> 2:48:23.880]  That's the other person.
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:24.880]  Other.
[2:48:24.880 --> 2:48:29.560]  I mean, Mac, again, the new thing is they know the media wants to PR.
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:33.520]  So if my people say anything about somebody else's report, this is 100% right.
[2:48:33.520 --> 2:48:34.680]  We even retract it.
[2:48:34.680 --> 2:48:35.680]  They don't care.
[2:48:35.680 --> 2:48:39.760]  We get sued because then it creates a huge publicity deal, but he's on the New York Federal
[2:48:39.760 --> 2:48:40.760]  Reserve board.
[2:48:40.760 --> 2:48:41.760]  That runs.
[2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:43.920]  So he's involved with the refugee panel and the UN.
[2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:45.420]  He is pushing open borders.
[2:48:45.420 --> 2:48:47.160]  Well, I don't even want to be this guy's enemy.
[2:48:47.160 --> 2:48:48.560]  Well, I mean, notice this.
[2:48:48.560 --> 2:48:52.960]  He didn't want to go on air and talk to her because the settlement terms, which again,
[2:48:52.960 --> 2:48:54.560]  you heard him say they want to drop it.
[2:48:54.560 --> 2:48:55.560]  Yeah.
[2:48:55.560 --> 2:48:56.560]  They said, oh, it's close.
[2:48:56.560 --> 2:48:57.760]  So I thought, well, well, well, that is what you call it.
[2:48:57.760 --> 2:49:01.760]  I wonder what they would say if they knew what the settlement was like, oh, I wonder
[2:49:01.760 --> 2:49:04.160]  because they try to use the settlement to make you look bad.
[2:49:04.160 --> 2:49:07.680]  And the Chobani people said, well, we don't want to talk about this anymore.
[2:49:07.680 --> 2:49:09.240]  Well, well, well.
[2:49:09.240 --> 2:49:12.560]  Maybe there's more to that settlement than the fake news media reported.
[2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:16.040]  And I, and I, you know, people, people are smart, people able to figure, figure that
[2:49:16.040 --> 2:49:17.040]  out.
[2:49:17.040 --> 2:49:21.320]  Well, my lawyers, I'm just going to leave it alone because here's the deal.
[2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:25.120]  It wouldn't matter if I went and spent two years in court and one, the media would just
[2:49:25.120 --> 2:49:26.120]  say I lost.
[2:49:26.120 --> 2:49:27.120]  It's like, I have my children.
[2:49:27.120 --> 2:49:28.120]  They say I lost custody.
[2:49:28.120 --> 2:49:33.640]  I mean, they said, just why even respond to them at this point, I, I want to go ahead
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:36.680]  now and I want to declare victory for the American people and I want to declare victory
[2:49:36.680 --> 2:49:42.920]  for the listeners and the crew because I think her mistakes is why she blew up.
[2:49:42.920 --> 2:49:43.920]  Not any credit to me.
[2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:46.200]  I don't just say that to look magnanimous.
[2:49:46.200 --> 2:49:47.200]  It's true.
[2:49:47.200 --> 2:49:48.200]  Okay.
[2:49:48.200 --> 2:49:49.200]  What matters is we try our best.
[2:49:49.200 --> 2:49:50.200]  We tell the truth.
[2:49:50.200 --> 2:49:54.400]  We take action and we just keep promoting Americana and basic free market because it's a lot
[2:49:54.400 --> 2:49:55.400]  better North Korea.
[2:49:55.400 --> 2:49:57.680]  And I just want to thank all of you for coming in and doing this tonight.
[2:49:57.680 --> 2:50:01.360]  You guys are going to host for another hour and take calls or cover news or do whatever
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:02.360]  you want.
[2:50:02.360 --> 2:50:06.660]  But I want to just open this bottle of champagne here.
[2:50:06.660 --> 2:50:10.520]  So that we can celebrate the fact that we're in the fight, we celebrate the fact that we
[2:50:10.520 --> 2:50:11.520]  haven't rolled over.
[2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:12.520]  We're not dying.
[2:50:12.520 --> 2:50:13.720]  We're getting stronger.
[2:50:13.720 --> 2:50:17.800]  They're getting weaker and we walked to the lion's den and it blew up in their face and
[2:50:17.800 --> 2:50:22.440]  the word is NBC is looking to get rid of Megan Kelly, according to your sources.
[2:50:22.440 --> 2:50:23.440]  She's not the enemy though.
[2:50:23.440 --> 2:50:24.440]  She's just a little puppet.
[2:50:24.440 --> 2:50:30.160]  And I think she starts, she starts realizing they're sending her on political suicide missions
[2:50:30.160 --> 2:50:34.240]  against Trump, against me, against you name it because our listeners know I'm a goofball,
[2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:37.000]  but they don't think at the end of the day, I'm their goofball.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:38.200]  And so you guys are just awesome.
[2:50:38.200 --> 2:50:41.640]  I want to just say, here's the Republic, here's to a real independent press.
[2:50:41.640 --> 2:50:46.760]  Here's the First Amendment and here is to the dinosaur media joining its place in history
[2:50:46.760 --> 2:50:47.760]  with the ashes.
[2:50:47.760 --> 2:50:52.920]  So here we go, ladies and gentlemen, I only did this a few times when Trump won.
[2:50:52.920 --> 2:50:58.120]  And of course, when we got the carbon tax documents, it was all a fraud.
[2:50:58.120 --> 2:51:02.840]  And a few other times because it shows the big juggernaut of the new world order had
[2:51:02.840 --> 2:51:08.800]  to roll off all, roll out all scared Tom Brokaw, you know, who, who looks like he's trying
[2:51:08.800 --> 2:51:12.240]  to find his, uh, depends nothing against old people.
[2:51:12.240 --> 2:51:15.640]  It's just, you know, literally snaggle tooth up there with his eyes pointing different
[2:51:15.640 --> 2:51:16.640]  directions.
[2:51:16.640 --> 2:51:21.320]  So here is to folks that aren't scared of being demonized by anti-American scum.
[2:51:21.320 --> 2:51:22.440]  Here is to the real Mavericks.
[2:51:22.440 --> 2:51:23.440]  I salute you all.
[2:51:23.440 --> 2:51:26.120]  This is for you, the viewers and the listeners in our affiliates.
[2:51:26.120 --> 2:51:28.840]  You are the real MVPs that are kicking the global of tasks.
[2:51:28.840 --> 2:51:29.840]  We salute you.
[2:51:29.840 --> 2:51:32.840]  Cheers.
[2:51:32.840 --> 2:51:35.520]  It's pretty good stuff.
[2:51:35.520 --> 2:51:36.520]  Yeah.
[2:51:36.520 --> 2:51:38.840]  You know, they're really going to hate these photos tomorrow.
[2:51:38.840 --> 2:51:39.840]  Cheers.
[2:51:39.840 --> 2:51:40.840]  Right.
[2:51:40.840 --> 2:51:41.840]  Yeah.
[2:51:41.840 --> 2:51:42.840]  Photo moment.
[2:51:42.840 --> 2:51:43.840]  Yeah.
[2:51:43.840 --> 2:51:49.600]  So in real time or reading the reaction, which is, you know, Brian Stelter, who, who's
[2:51:49.600 --> 2:51:53.880]  the one who called you today, essentially called you a pedophile, you know, compared
[2:51:53.880 --> 2:51:54.880]  you to them.
[2:51:54.880 --> 2:51:55.880]  Oh, talk about fake news.
[2:51:55.880 --> 2:51:56.880]  Yeah.
[2:51:56.880 --> 2:51:57.880]  We should get the brines.
[2:51:57.880 --> 2:51:58.880]  Get the Brian Stelter clip ready please.
[2:51:58.880 --> 2:51:59.880]  Go ahead.
[2:51:59.880 --> 2:52:00.880]  Yeah.
[2:52:00.880 --> 2:52:01.880]  That's a great clip.
[2:52:01.880 --> 2:52:05.600]  And he goes, tonight definitely gives Alex Jones more ammo for his anti-media war.
[2:52:05.600 --> 2:52:06.880]  Oh, that piece was so edited.
[2:52:06.880 --> 2:52:07.880]  Yeah.
[2:52:07.880 --> 2:52:08.880]  That it was just like scrambled.
[2:52:08.880 --> 2:52:18.120]  I mean, I'm like, I mean, it was exactly total, total embarrassment, total, total embarrassment.
[2:52:18.120 --> 2:52:19.120]  So it's good.
[2:52:19.120 --> 2:52:20.120]  Good day.
[2:52:20.120 --> 2:52:21.120]  Good day for the victory.
[2:52:21.120 --> 2:52:25.400]  Let's go ahead and go to the Brian Stelter clip where he says, well, first they play
[2:52:25.400 --> 2:52:26.400]  good cop and bad cop.
[2:52:26.400 --> 2:52:27.800]  One of these says, just don't even have money.
[2:52:27.800 --> 2:52:28.800]  So evil.
[2:52:28.800 --> 2:52:30.880]  He says, well, I mean, he's like a pedophile.
[2:52:30.880 --> 2:52:33.040]  So, you know, we talked to pedophiles, so it's okay.
[2:52:33.040 --> 2:52:34.040]  Here it is.
[2:52:34.040 --> 2:52:36.800]  Well, you say this segment should not air on NBC.
[2:52:36.800 --> 2:52:37.800]  Why?
[2:52:37.800 --> 2:52:42.160]  Well, I think that covering people like Alex Jones is important.
[2:52:42.160 --> 2:52:43.720]  I should make that clear at the outset.
[2:52:43.720 --> 2:52:50.400]  I think that the rise of these people who foment hate and spew lies is important to our culture.
[2:52:50.400 --> 2:52:52.800]  It's obviously tapping into something that's impacting America.
[2:52:52.800 --> 2:52:53.800]  Like the fact that Comey said nobody asked her to stop investigation.
[2:52:53.800 --> 2:52:58.640]  I just think the context in which this coverage takes place is really important.
[2:52:58.640 --> 2:53:03.600]  And if you were to tell me that NBC were doing an hour-long white paper, so to speak, or
[2:53:03.600 --> 2:53:09.840]  an hour-long documentary on the rise of this kind of disinformation, media empires, I would
[2:53:09.840 --> 2:53:11.080]  say that's great.
[2:53:11.080 --> 2:53:15.000]  We should definitely take a hard look at that and what is brought about and what has made
[2:53:15.000 --> 2:53:19.640]  it such a really scary part of the media.
[2:53:19.640 --> 2:53:20.640]  That's it.
[2:53:20.640 --> 2:53:21.640]  I challenge Skelter to a celebrity.
[2:53:21.640 --> 2:53:24.640]  And some people are doing a great job of getting out there and covering it.
[2:53:24.640 --> 2:53:25.640]  No, I'll involve them.
[2:53:25.640 --> 2:53:26.640]  And then I'll fight that Tom Arnold.
[2:53:26.640 --> 2:53:27.640]  I don't think getting Alex Jones.
[2:53:27.640 --> 2:53:28.640]  I love how it is.
[2:53:28.640 --> 2:53:29.640]  I'm not going to fight.
[2:53:29.640 --> 2:53:32.640]  If Alex Baldwin will come out and fight you, then I'll fight Tom Arnold.
[2:53:32.640 --> 2:53:33.640]  That's right.
[2:53:33.640 --> 2:53:34.640]  Let's go back to the America.
[2:53:34.640 --> 2:53:35.640]  That wouldn't be fair.
[2:53:35.640 --> 2:53:41.240]  And as I wrote the other day, Megyn Kelly has not proven herself to be the kind of dog
[2:53:41.240 --> 2:53:45.880]  interviewer that would be able to make a meal of this.
[2:53:45.880 --> 2:53:47.480]  I just don't see it.
[2:53:47.480 --> 2:53:52.080]  That's interesting that maybe she is not the right person to be in this position interviewing
[2:53:52.080 --> 2:53:53.080]  this conspiracy theorist.
[2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:54.440]  Charlie, what do you say on that?
[2:53:54.440 --> 2:53:55.440]  This conspiracy theorist.
[2:53:55.440 --> 2:54:00.160]  I think that there's a good case to be made that that's true, especially from what we've
[2:54:00.160 --> 2:54:02.400]  seen in the lead-up to all of this.
[2:54:02.400 --> 2:54:08.720]  I think that there's this sort of dangerous argument right now that there should be people
[2:54:08.720 --> 2:54:10.440]  on a list that can't be given a platform.
[2:54:10.440 --> 2:54:11.440]  Oh, look, he's the actual liberal.
[2:54:11.440 --> 2:54:12.440]  He's smart, though.
[2:54:12.440 --> 2:54:13.440]  Charlie's a smart kid.
[2:54:13.440 --> 2:54:15.640]  No, they're actually on their same ban-free space.
[2:54:15.640 --> 2:54:18.440]  Well, that's what's interesting, too, is that's like a liberal...
[2:54:18.440 --> 2:54:19.440]  You're backing up, backing up, though.
[2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:20.440]  I'm going to interrupt you.
[2:54:20.440 --> 2:54:21.440]  You're backing up a few minutes.
[2:54:21.440 --> 2:54:23.440]  I want you to hear where I'm like the child molester or whatever.
[2:54:23.440 --> 2:54:25.440]  Well, no, no, he calls you later when you're a virus.
[2:54:25.440 --> 2:54:26.440]  He goes, Alex Jones is a virus.
[2:54:26.440 --> 2:54:29.440]  No, no, that's what I'm saying is, they're so discredited.
[2:54:29.440 --> 2:54:32.440]  It's like a joke when they're saying the worst possible stuff.
[2:54:32.440 --> 2:54:34.440]  Everyone knows it's the village idiot.
[2:54:34.440 --> 2:54:35.440]  Here, here, here.
[2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:36.440]  Finish the clip.
[2:54:36.440 --> 2:54:37.440]  Here it is.
[2:54:37.440 --> 2:54:38.440]  People can see.
[2:54:38.440 --> 2:54:43.440]  And I think that ignores the fact that Alex Jones has a huge platform, and he's very influential.
[2:54:43.440 --> 2:54:48.440]  And there's this whole thing happening online and over his terrestrial radio stations that
[2:54:48.440 --> 2:54:52.440]  I, you know, we need to talk about as a country and normal people need to...
[2:54:52.440 --> 2:54:57.440]  That's exactly what Kelly and her boss, NBC News Chairman, had said to me a few days ago.
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:55:01.440]  He said, hey, terrorists and child molesters and serial killers have been interviewed on television.
[2:55:01.440 --> 2:55:02.440]  There you go.
[2:55:02.440 --> 2:55:05.440]  What's different about this, about this hate monger, this conspiracy theorist?
[2:55:05.440 --> 2:55:06.440]  Hate monger.
[2:55:06.440 --> 2:55:07.440]  I wonder if it's different...
[2:55:07.440 --> 2:55:09.440]  Let's rewind at 10 seconds, because if you run that 30 seconds...
[2:55:09.440 --> 2:55:13.440]  He does compare you to pedophiles, and that is, I believe Brian Stelzer trying to incite
[2:55:13.440 --> 2:55:15.440]  death against you like Meg and Kelly.
[2:55:15.440 --> 2:55:16.440]  But wait a minute.
[2:55:16.440 --> 2:55:20.440]  CNN says pedophiles don't exist, or they should be legalized, so...
[2:55:20.440 --> 2:55:24.440]  Yeah, let's go back, he compares you to a serial killer, a child molester.
[2:55:24.440 --> 2:55:27.440]  That is what Brian Stelzer compares you to in 1998.
[2:55:27.440 --> 2:55:30.440]  Well, let me tell you, put me in a line up in front of like a hundred citizens and say,
[2:55:30.440 --> 2:55:32.440]  which guy looks like the creepy man?
[2:55:32.440 --> 2:55:36.440]  And all the little kids will go, that's the creepy man, Brian Stelzer, not me.
[2:55:36.440 --> 2:55:37.440]  Put you next to Anthony.
[2:55:37.440 --> 2:55:38.440]  But the broader point...
[2:55:38.440 --> 2:55:41.440]  Let me tell you, women run from Stelter.
[2:55:41.440 --> 2:55:42.440]  I'm not being mean.
[2:55:42.440 --> 2:55:43.440]  How much do you want to bet?
[2:55:43.440 --> 2:55:47.440]  Well, Stelter's got big trouble getting a little bit of a...
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:48.440]  The broader point, though.
[2:55:48.440 --> 2:55:51.440]  I know we're celebrating, but you know me, I'm always serious.
[2:55:51.440 --> 2:55:52.440]  I'm always on.
[2:55:52.440 --> 2:55:53.440]  Oh, yeah.
[2:55:53.440 --> 2:55:54.440]  The broader point...
[2:55:54.440 --> 2:55:55.440]  Uh-oh.
[2:55:55.440 --> 2:55:56.440]  It's a little war.
[2:55:56.440 --> 2:55:57.440]  We're good.
[2:55:57.440 --> 2:55:59.440]  The broader point is that Brian Stelzer is trying to incite death against you by comparing
[2:55:59.440 --> 2:56:03.440]  you to a child molester, so we really need to hold him to account for making those kind
[2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:04.440]  of analogies.
[2:56:04.440 --> 2:56:05.440]  So let's go watch that clip.
[2:56:05.440 --> 2:56:08.440]  Here is Brian Stelzer.
[2:56:08.440 --> 2:56:12.440]  Kelly and her boss, NBC News Chairman Andy Lax, said to me a few days ago, they said,
[2:56:12.440 --> 2:56:16.440]  hey, terrorists and child molesters and serial killers have been interviewed on television.
[2:56:16.440 --> 2:56:20.440]  What's different about this, about this hate monger, this conspiracy theorist?
[2:56:20.440 --> 2:56:24.440]  I wonder if what's different, Charlie, is that the country feels very anxious right now,
[2:56:24.440 --> 2:56:28.440]  obviously very divided as we've been talking about, and Alex Jones is a virus.
[2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:33.440]  There's maybe a fear of spreading that virus more fully on a big network like the national
[2:56:33.440 --> 2:56:34.440]  broadcasting company.
[2:56:34.440 --> 2:56:38.440]  And I think that's sort of where Mo and I are kind of agreeing on our arguments, which
[2:56:38.440 --> 2:56:45.440]  is that there's a way to interview him, and there's a way to be just very intense and
[2:56:45.440 --> 2:56:48.440]  to really take him to task and to go at it.
[2:56:48.440 --> 2:56:49.440]  And hey, we don't know.
[2:56:49.440 --> 2:56:50.440]  We haven't seen the full interview yet.
[2:56:50.440 --> 2:56:51.440]  Exactly.
[2:56:51.440 --> 2:56:56.440]  I'm suspected if there had been that moment, that stunning moment that NBC would have released
[2:56:56.440 --> 2:56:57.440]  it as a preview.
[2:56:57.440 --> 2:56:58.440]  But we don't know.
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:57:01.440]  We have to see the full interview.
[2:57:01.440 --> 2:57:02.440]  No.
[2:57:02.440 --> 2:57:03.440]  Justin.
[2:57:03.440 --> 2:57:08.440]  Brian Stelzer is like fascinatingly dorky.
[2:57:08.440 --> 2:57:10.440]  He's actually, he's so good at being dorky.
[2:57:10.440 --> 2:57:12.440]  He's like the archetype from central casting.
[2:57:12.440 --> 2:57:15.440]  Do you want a dork?
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:17.440]  He's not very smart, but he thinks he is.
[2:57:17.440 --> 2:57:18.440]  He's not that educated.
[2:57:18.440 --> 2:57:22.440]  But again, you know, I know, you know, I'm not to belabor the point, but you are already
[2:57:22.440 --> 2:57:26.440]  receiving death threats because of Megan Kelly and Brian Stelzer by making those comparisons
[2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:27.440]  about you.
[2:57:27.440 --> 2:57:32.440]  That is him trying to incite death against you, and he needs to apologize for that.
[2:57:32.440 --> 2:57:34.440]  Well, that's the whole left thing is death, death, murder.
[2:57:34.440 --> 2:57:37.440]  They're like, Tom Brokaw's like, oh, we have violence.
[2:57:37.440 --> 2:57:38.440]  We need to stop it.
[2:57:38.440 --> 2:57:41.440]  He means just give up, capitulate, let us kill you.
[2:57:41.440 --> 2:57:42.440]  They're deathcalls.
[2:57:42.440 --> 2:57:44.440]  Naturally, they're deathcalls.
[2:57:44.440 --> 2:57:46.440]  Since we mentioned this, let's go to the clip.
[2:57:46.440 --> 2:57:51.440]  Fox News compares Alex Jones to murderers and rapists, but they didn't even do it as bad
[2:57:51.440 --> 2:57:53.440]  as Brian Stupor did.
[2:57:53.440 --> 2:57:54.440]  Here it is.
[2:57:54.440 --> 2:57:58.440]  You cannot be moved by listening to some of these standing parents and how they think
[2:57:58.440 --> 2:58:00.440]  that Alex Jones should not get a platform.
[2:58:00.440 --> 2:58:06.440]  At the same time, he is somebody who President Trump called after the election to thank him
[2:58:06.440 --> 2:58:07.440]  for his role.
[2:58:07.440 --> 2:58:09.440]  Trump had gone on his radio show during the campaign.
[2:58:09.440 --> 2:58:14.440]  It's not so much that NBC is just all aimed at Trump.
[2:58:14.440 --> 2:58:17.440]  They don't get what the grass roots.
[2:58:17.440 --> 2:58:19.440]  It makes him more popular.
[2:58:19.440 --> 2:58:20.440]  Yeah.
[2:58:20.440 --> 2:58:23.440]  Journalists have interviewed murderers and rapists and child molesters.
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:25.440]  I mean, the anchors have interviewed Saddam Hussein.
[2:58:25.440 --> 2:58:27.440]  So Skelter's not even original.
[2:58:27.440 --> 2:58:29.440]  This is part of what we do.
[2:58:29.440 --> 2:58:30.440]  Plagiarism.
[2:58:30.440 --> 2:58:33.440]  Plagiarism scandal right there, Brian Skelter and plagiarism scandal.
[2:58:33.440 --> 2:58:37.440]  Press to explain has held to account for some of the outrageous things in this case
[2:58:37.440 --> 2:58:39.440]  that he has said.
[2:58:39.440 --> 2:58:41.440]  Or is it more of a passive interview where you are just kind of giving them a free pass?
[2:58:41.440 --> 2:58:44.440]  And I think we can't really answer that question until we see the flow.
[2:58:44.440 --> 2:58:45.440]  Okay.
[2:58:45.440 --> 2:58:46.440]  There you go.
[2:58:46.440 --> 2:58:49.440]  So what do you say?
[2:58:49.440 --> 2:58:50.440]  Victory.
[2:58:50.440 --> 2:58:51.440]  Really?
[2:58:51.440 --> 2:58:52.440]  Do we really declare victory?
[2:58:52.440 --> 2:58:53.440]  All right.
[2:58:53.440 --> 2:58:54.440]  Big victory.
[2:58:54.440 --> 2:58:55.440]  Big victory.
[2:58:55.440 --> 2:58:56.440]  Good job, man.
[2:58:56.440 --> 2:58:57.440]  Here is the Brian Stelter.
[2:58:57.440 --> 2:58:59.440]  Thank God we don't look like him.
[2:58:59.440 --> 2:59:00.440]  Don't pour on me.
[2:59:00.440 --> 2:59:01.440]  I don't sound like him.
[2:59:01.440 --> 2:59:02.440]  We'll be all right.
[2:59:02.440 --> 2:59:03.440]  There we go.
[2:59:03.440 --> 2:59:04.440]  Thank God we don't.
[2:59:04.440 --> 2:59:06.440]  Every day you're not Brian Stelter is a good day.
[2:59:06.440 --> 2:59:11.440]  You know, I think about the Brian Stelter, it makes me think of the master drill sergeant
[2:59:11.440 --> 2:59:13.440]  Hartman in full metal jacket.
[2:59:13.440 --> 2:59:18.440]  Looks like the better part of you ran down your mother's ass cracking on the mattress.
[2:59:18.440 --> 2:59:21.440]  There you go, gentlemen.
[2:59:21.440 --> 2:59:26.440]  Here's to what ran down mom's ass crack on Hartman or on Stelter.
[2:59:26.440 --> 2:59:30.440]  Here's your mom's ass crack.
[2:59:30.440 --> 2:59:32.440]  You know, openly trolling him.
[2:59:32.440 --> 2:59:33.440]  Oh, yeah.
[2:59:33.440 --> 2:59:34.440]  Make him mad.
[2:59:34.440 --> 2:59:37.440]  He was really triggered by, he said, in that same clip.
[2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:40.440]  This is somebody who calls CNN ISIS.
[2:59:40.440 --> 2:59:41.440]  We're getting them.
[2:59:41.440 --> 2:59:42.440]  We're shaking them.
[2:59:42.440 --> 2:59:43.440]  We're going now.
[2:59:43.440 --> 2:59:44.440]  That's the contest idea you have, which we're going to get to this week.
[2:59:44.440 --> 2:59:46.440]  We've had like 15 good entries come in.
[2:59:46.440 --> 2:59:48.440]  We've already paid out on like 10 grand.
[2:59:48.440 --> 2:59:49.440]  You've got to remind me tomorrow.
[2:59:49.440 --> 2:59:50.440]  I got to write some of the checks.
[2:59:50.440 --> 2:59:52.440]  I already wrote some of the checks.
[2:59:52.440 --> 2:59:54.440]  You take over murder, Trump stuff peacefully.
[2:59:54.440 --> 2:59:56.440]  You know, whatever you do is almost legal and lawful.
[2:59:56.440 --> 2:59:57.440]  We will pay out on it.
[2:59:57.440 --> 2:59:58.440]  It's anything creative.
[2:59:58.440 --> 3:00:00.440]  Just attack the globalist peacefully.
[3:00:00.440 --> 3:00:02.440]  Go, folks, about your idea.
[3:00:02.440 --> 3:00:05.440]  You're the one that kicked it off the CNN's Isis.
[3:00:05.440 --> 3:00:06.440]  Oh, yeah.
[3:00:06.440 --> 3:00:10.440]  I mean, there was, um, after that Kathy Griffin thing happened, I just messaged.
[3:00:10.440 --> 3:00:13.440]  And then she bitched and complained and cried and said, Trump was mean to her.
[3:00:13.440 --> 3:00:15.440]  All he said is it's despicable.
[3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:16.440]  Broke me.
[3:00:16.440 --> 3:00:17.440]  And then she bitched everywhere.
[3:00:17.440 --> 3:00:18.440]  He broke me.
[3:00:18.440 --> 3:00:19.440]  He broke me.
[3:00:19.440 --> 3:00:20.440]  Yes.
[3:00:20.440 --> 3:00:23.440]  I, I just texted Alex and I go, Hey, you know, let's do a thing, a contest where if you
[3:00:23.440 --> 3:00:28.440]  can get on air and disrupt peacefully and lawfully their transmissions with CNN is Isis
[3:00:28.440 --> 3:00:31.440]  thing, then we'll get you, you know, we'll get you taken care of.
[3:00:31.440 --> 3:00:33.440]  And people are doing it.
[3:00:33.440 --> 3:00:35.440]  The first guy, I think George was his name.
[3:00:35.440 --> 3:00:36.440]  He did it at DC.
[3:00:36.440 --> 3:00:39.440]  So we're, we're now entering their territory.
[3:00:39.440 --> 3:00:41.440]  There were also Jack Pasobic, Laura Loomer.
[3:00:41.440 --> 3:00:42.440]  They went into the play.
[3:00:42.440 --> 3:00:44.440]  So the, the idea goes like this.
[3:00:44.440 --> 3:00:49.440]  I can't leave my house with Mount maybe Antifa putting a bomb in my car because of the fake
[3:00:49.440 --> 3:00:51.440]  news media lies about me.
[3:00:51.440 --> 3:00:54.440]  And because they will, they are inciting mobs against me.
[3:00:54.440 --> 3:00:55.440]  Okay.
[3:00:55.440 --> 3:00:56.440]  So maybe you're doing news.
[3:00:56.440 --> 3:00:59.440]  We're not going to be violent like you, but maybe we're going to call you Isis in the
[3:00:59.440 --> 3:01:01.440]  back of your head.
[3:01:01.440 --> 3:01:06.440]  You're going to wonder is my proto is my event again, peacefully and lawfully, right?
[3:01:06.440 --> 3:01:08.440]  We disavow all political violence.
[3:01:08.440 --> 3:01:10.440]  We disavow violence of all kinds.
[3:01:10.440 --> 3:01:13.440]  But just like there's the black brunch, right?
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:17.440]  Where those people, those activists would go in during people's brunches and say things.
[3:01:17.440 --> 3:01:21.440]  Well, I think that's a little bit too far, but you know, the media was all for that.
[3:01:21.440 --> 3:01:23.440]  The media said, Oh, this is great.
[3:01:23.440 --> 3:01:26.440]  Anytime there's a disruption on the left by one of our events, the media says that's
[3:01:26.440 --> 3:01:27.440]  great.
[3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:30.440]  So our answer to that is okay.
[3:01:30.440 --> 3:01:32.440]  We're in the party now.
[3:01:32.440 --> 3:01:34.440]  We've decided to play by your rule.
[3:01:34.440 --> 3:01:36.440]  But it was your God that Michael Mallison was on earlier.
[3:01:36.440 --> 3:01:39.440]  I mean, he was one that pointed out, we're the ones with the guns.
[3:01:39.440 --> 3:01:42.440]  I mean, I mean, we're like an armed fortress here.
[3:01:42.440 --> 3:01:46.440]  What are people going to do when they just, it's like when they come up and try to beat
[3:01:46.440 --> 3:01:48.440]  people up now, they get their asses kicked.
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:52.440]  Well, I had that guy when I was in Austin and they were doing an anti-Trump rally for
[3:01:52.440 --> 3:01:54.440]  15th and I called Bill Clinton a rapist.
[3:01:54.440 --> 3:01:58.440]  I had a guy literally take a shot at me and I dodged it and I punched him right in the
[3:01:58.440 --> 3:02:00.440]  face and he started crying.
[3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:02.440]  That's why there's no video of the event.
[3:02:02.440 --> 3:02:07.440]  Everybody had their cameras on at that, that protest rally at the state Capitol.
[3:02:07.440 --> 3:02:08.440]  There were cameras everywhere.
[3:02:08.440 --> 3:02:10.440]  So why is there no video of me?
[3:02:10.440 --> 3:02:13.440]  Well, because I popped this guy in the head and he started crying.
[3:02:13.440 --> 3:02:14.440]  His eyes walled up and they cried.
[3:02:14.440 --> 3:02:15.440]  They cried when he hit him.
[3:02:15.440 --> 3:02:17.440]  Yeah, it was beautiful.
[3:02:17.440 --> 3:02:18.440]  I think this is how we win.
[3:02:18.440 --> 3:02:22.440]  We have to take the meme warfare that we have online to the real world.
[3:02:22.440 --> 3:02:26.440]  And again, peacefully and lawfully, we have to start trolling the real world, trolling
[3:02:26.440 --> 3:02:27.440]  the mainstream media.
[3:02:27.440 --> 3:02:28.440]  Yeah.
[3:02:28.440 --> 3:02:31.440]  Like with that, who's that washed up transformer guy?
[3:02:31.440 --> 3:02:33.440]  He will not divide us.
[3:02:33.440 --> 3:02:34.440]  Shilah the buff.
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:35.440]  Shilah.
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:36.440]  Yeah.
[3:02:36.440 --> 3:02:40.440]  So Autobots transform and roll out the form of an asshole named Shilah the buff.
[3:02:40.440 --> 3:02:41.440]  Yeah.
[3:02:41.440 --> 3:02:42.440]  This is Nikki.
[3:02:42.440 --> 3:02:43.440]  She's actually, she actually sent that.
[3:02:43.440 --> 3:02:44.440]  So we'll make sure she gets her check.
[3:02:44.440 --> 3:02:46.440]  If you, if they go back about 10, 15.
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:47.440]  Yeah, I need help.
[3:02:47.440 --> 3:02:48.440]  Yeah.
[3:02:48.440 --> 3:02:49.440]  Yeah.
[3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:50.440]  Yeah.
[3:02:50.440 --> 3:02:51.440]  This is beautiful though.
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:54.440]  Cause it's, it's completely just destroys the brand.
[3:02:54.440 --> 3:02:55.440]  Yeah.
[3:02:55.440 --> 3:02:57.440]  And that, and that is again, why they're so upset.
[3:02:57.440 --> 3:02:58.440]  Uh-oh.
[3:02:58.440 --> 3:03:01.440]  Protesters inside the Delacorte theater for the last show in Julius Caesar.
[3:03:01.440 --> 3:03:02.440]  Stay tuned.
[3:03:02.440 --> 3:03:03.440]  Oh, here we go.
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:04.440]  Okay.
[3:03:04.440 --> 3:03:05.440]  So there.
[3:03:05.440 --> 3:03:07.440]  So the Julius Caesar in the park kill Trump thing has begun.
[3:03:07.440 --> 3:03:08.440]  Yeah.
[3:03:08.440 --> 3:03:09.440]  And then we have a word again tonight.
[3:03:09.440 --> 3:03:10.440]  People are going to take over again.
[3:03:10.440 --> 3:03:11.440]  We have nothing to do with it.
[3:03:11.440 --> 3:03:12.440]  Of course though.
[3:03:12.440 --> 3:03:16.440]  Ah, here's the, here's to the folks that did that.
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:19.440]  Oh, you're being defeated.
[3:03:19.440 --> 3:03:21.440]  There's no protest.
[3:03:21.440 --> 3:03:22.440]  They're back tonight.
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:25.440]  It's a, so I knew this earlier by the way.
[3:03:25.440 --> 3:03:28.440]  So there's going to be another interesting event.
[3:03:28.440 --> 3:03:32.440]  So all of it says how outrage built over Shakespeare's depiction of Trump.
[3:03:32.440 --> 3:03:34.440]  Even the New York times admits it's Trump.
[3:03:34.440 --> 3:03:37.440]  But then when they tweeted us, they go, you crazy people.
[3:03:37.440 --> 3:03:38.440]  This has nothing to do with Trump.
[3:03:38.440 --> 3:03:40.440]  What the hell's your problem?
[3:03:40.440 --> 3:03:41.440]  You're crazy.
[3:03:41.440 --> 3:03:42.440]  But it doesn't matter.
[3:03:42.440 --> 3:03:45.440]  But I know that they play this game like we're retarded.
[3:03:45.440 --> 3:03:46.440]  Yeah.
[3:03:46.440 --> 3:03:48.440]  I don't even, I don't even read the articles about me because they're so boring.
[3:03:48.440 --> 3:03:49.440]  Unpredictable.
[3:03:49.440 --> 3:03:50.440]  You know, it used to be.
[3:03:50.440 --> 3:03:51.440]  Well, it is a shaken bank.
[3:03:51.440 --> 3:03:56.440]  Every article, other than Warzell, who I don't even like, but at least he gets a few things
[3:03:56.440 --> 3:03:57.440]  right.
[3:03:57.440 --> 3:03:58.440]  I can read Warzell's articles.
[3:03:58.440 --> 3:03:59.440]  They actually, you can tell he wrote them.
[3:03:59.440 --> 3:04:02.440]  I'm telling you, I'll read hundreds of liberal articles a week.
[3:04:02.440 --> 3:04:04.440]  It's like the same five articles recut together.
[3:04:04.440 --> 3:04:06.440]  You know how boring that is?
[3:04:06.440 --> 3:04:10.440]  I almost want to marry Warzell now just because, you know, not that I'm Gary.
[3:04:10.440 --> 3:04:12.440]  I'm not going to be saying wrong with that.
[3:04:12.440 --> 3:04:15.440]  It's that it's so original that a liberal actually wrote something original.
[3:04:15.440 --> 3:04:16.440]  Yeah, he does.
[3:04:16.440 --> 3:04:18.440]  Have you seen how it's like all the stories are complete?
[3:04:18.440 --> 3:04:20.440]  That was satire, by the way.
[3:04:20.440 --> 3:04:21.440]  Well, people get mad at me.
[3:04:21.440 --> 3:04:22.440]  They're like, how dare you?
[3:04:22.440 --> 3:04:23.440]  How dare you link to BuzzFeed?
[3:04:23.440 --> 3:04:28.440]  And I was like, look, man, you know, I'm so used to just copy and paste jobs about me
[3:04:28.440 --> 3:04:32.440]  and about the issues that, hey, you know, the kid might be wrong and he might be a liberal
[3:04:32.440 --> 3:04:33.440]  and he might not.
[3:04:33.440 --> 3:04:34.440]  At least he's trying to get it.
[3:04:34.440 --> 3:04:38.440]  At least he's trying to actually understand what is going on and everybody's got a point
[3:04:38.440 --> 3:04:39.440]  of view.
[3:04:39.440 --> 3:04:42.440]  And unlike the fake news media, we don't know platform people.
[3:04:42.440 --> 3:04:46.440]  So if there's actually a well-written hate article about me, I'll be the first to link
[3:04:46.440 --> 3:04:47.440]  to it.
[3:04:47.440 --> 3:04:48.440]  But there are so many of them.
[3:04:48.440 --> 3:04:49.440]  They're just boring.
[3:04:49.440 --> 3:04:50.440]  I'm like, dude, I can't even read this.
[3:04:50.440 --> 3:04:51.440]  Nobody reads that crap anyway.
[3:04:51.440 --> 3:04:52.440]  No one actually reads the content.
[3:04:52.440 --> 3:04:53.440]  It's just like a headline.
[3:04:53.440 --> 3:04:54.440]  It's the headline.
[3:04:54.440 --> 3:04:55.440]  It's a headline war.
[3:04:55.440 --> 3:04:56.440]  That's all it is.
[3:04:56.440 --> 3:04:57.440]  It's who can write the wittiest.
[3:04:57.440 --> 3:04:58.440]  Well, that's why they had like New York Times headlines.
[3:04:58.440 --> 3:04:59.440]  Like they've been caught again.
[3:04:59.440 --> 3:05:06.440]  I keep obsessing on this because it's so bold to have the New York Times and Daily Beast,
[3:05:06.440 --> 3:05:12.440]  all of them running a headline, right when cotton conspiracy theories claiming that
[3:05:12.440 --> 3:05:15.440]  Comey, you know, never said Trump told him to stop investigation.
[3:05:15.440 --> 3:05:17.440]  Then we have the videos.
[3:05:17.440 --> 3:05:18.440]  Yeah.
[3:05:18.440 --> 3:05:19.440]  That's why we're winning though.
[3:05:19.440 --> 3:05:20.440]  Let them keep lying.
[3:05:20.440 --> 3:05:24.600]  That's why, again, what they want to do is they want right now, you know, during the
[3:05:24.600 --> 3:05:28.440]  whole episode, there, you know, millions of people watched all the videos, the live streams
[3:05:28.440 --> 3:05:30.040]  listened to the show.
[3:05:30.040 --> 3:05:32.480]  So the end game is they got to take us off the air.
[3:05:32.480 --> 3:05:34.520]  That's the only way that they can get us.
[3:05:34.520 --> 3:05:37.320]  Why do you think Megan is so scared?
[3:05:37.320 --> 3:05:40.680]  Well, they're all scared because we're coming for them.
[3:05:40.680 --> 3:05:41.680]  And they know it.
[3:05:41.680 --> 3:05:42.880]  They know it makes 20 million a year.
[3:05:42.880 --> 3:05:43.880]  Right.
[3:05:43.880 --> 3:05:44.880]  She's going to lose her 20 million.
[3:05:44.880 --> 3:05:45.880]  That's the whole point.
[3:05:45.880 --> 3:05:50.400]  Selling pharmaceuticals, selling drugs that poison people, more people die of overdose
[3:05:50.400 --> 3:05:56.040]  to some Tylenol every year than from nearly any other drug because people, if they have
[3:05:56.040 --> 3:05:59.200]  a hangover, they'll take a Tylenol and they don't realize that acetaminophen is actually
[3:05:59.200 --> 3:06:03.800]  toxic on your liver and your liver is detoxing the alcohol, then you're going to get sick
[3:06:03.800 --> 3:06:04.800]  and die.
[3:06:04.800 --> 3:06:05.800]  Right.
[3:06:05.800 --> 3:06:06.800]  You'll never hear an expose on that.
[3:06:06.800 --> 3:06:09.400]  Should Tylenol warn people better about the side effects of drink?
[3:06:09.400 --> 3:06:10.400]  No, no, no.
[3:06:10.400 --> 3:06:11.400]  Because then you're going to lose that big sponsor.
[3:06:11.400 --> 3:06:12.400]  And I'd talk to top.
[3:06:12.400 --> 3:06:13.400]  I mean, it's well known.
[3:06:13.400 --> 3:06:15.280]  They would have never approved Tylenol now.
[3:06:15.280 --> 3:06:19.080]  I mean, it's reportedly like worse than like drinking a bottle of Jack Daniels or anything.
[3:06:19.080 --> 3:06:21.160]  They say, like you said, you mix with alcohol, you're dead.
[3:06:21.160 --> 3:06:22.920]  Oh, Tylenol is poison.
[3:06:22.920 --> 3:06:25.720]  No, there's no way in the world it could be approved.
[3:06:25.720 --> 3:06:28.720]  But again, you're never going to see that from the fake news media, you know, Tylenol
[3:06:28.720 --> 3:06:29.720]  probably sue me.
[3:06:29.720 --> 3:06:30.720]  Go ahead and sue me guys.
[3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:33.040]  You know, everybody every day, tell me, is they're going to sue me, Tylenol next.
[3:06:33.040 --> 3:06:34.720]  They're called Tylenol is poison.
[3:06:34.720 --> 3:06:37.880]  If you don't like it, then sue me, Tylenol.
[3:06:37.880 --> 3:06:41.360]  What about the article where they said, I'm horrible because I made the stock market go
[3:06:41.360 --> 3:06:42.360]  up?
[3:06:42.360 --> 3:06:45.360]  That's terrible.
[3:06:45.360 --> 3:06:50.000]  I think it's, it's, it's crazy because we, all of us, we answer only to, in your case,
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:53.560]  the listeners, in your case, your viewers, in our case, our users, right?
[3:06:53.560 --> 3:06:55.440]  We don't answer to big corporate advertisers.
[3:06:55.440 --> 3:06:58.720]  We don't have any venture capitalists that we took millions of dollars from.
[3:06:58.720 --> 3:07:03.000]  So that's why we have the power to say these things and to criticize certain things because
[3:07:03.000 --> 3:07:07.120]  we don't have to answer for it in the form of getting, you know, our cash cow cut from
[3:07:07.120 --> 3:07:08.120]  advertisers.
[3:07:08.120 --> 3:07:09.120]  Yeah.
[3:07:09.120 --> 3:07:10.120]  So we got more.
[3:07:10.120 --> 3:07:11.120]  So it's the elites freaking out.
[3:07:11.120 --> 3:07:12.120]  They're not in control.
[3:07:12.120 --> 3:07:15.560]  I mean, I know I'm stating an understatement or overstatement or obvious statement.
[3:07:15.560 --> 3:07:19.880]  But, but yeah, so, so, so again, where does this all end?
[3:07:19.880 --> 3:07:20.880]  There is no end.
[3:07:20.880 --> 3:07:24.200]  You know, we got, we wake up, you go to war every day.
[3:07:24.200 --> 3:07:25.200]  There is no end.
[3:07:25.200 --> 3:07:26.480]  The information war doesn't end.
[3:07:26.480 --> 3:07:31.960]  We, I, again, I'm new to this because I didn't realize that the national review weekly
[3:07:31.960 --> 3:07:36.760]  standard and all these other so-called right-winger conservative publications were actually in
[3:07:36.760 --> 3:07:38.880]  cahoots with the globalists.
[3:07:38.880 --> 3:07:44.960]  So the minute we stopped doing what we're doing is the minute the lies become truth.
[3:07:44.960 --> 3:07:48.480]  I'll tell you, that's what's scary is that people think like we're the ones that are
[3:07:48.480 --> 3:07:49.480]  winning.
[3:07:49.480 --> 3:07:53.520]  It's them online spreading the articles, taking action, shooting videos, sending stuff, doing
[3:07:53.520 --> 3:07:54.680]  their own stories.
[3:07:54.680 --> 3:07:56.560]  It's the listeners that have to keep kicking ass.
[3:07:56.560 --> 3:07:57.880]  We're just little focal points.
[3:07:57.880 --> 3:08:00.920]  Wait, something happened tonight, getting video right now.
[3:08:00.920 --> 3:08:02.980]  So they're breaking news.
[3:08:02.980 --> 3:08:05.800]  There was a disruption at the Shakespeare in the park.
[3:08:05.800 --> 3:08:07.400]  This is of course breaking news.
[3:08:07.400 --> 3:08:08.600]  I don't have video yet.
[3:08:08.600 --> 3:08:09.960]  I don't have audio as soon as I do.
[3:08:09.960 --> 3:08:10.960]  Okay.
[3:08:10.960 --> 3:08:14.440]  This means, so yeah, yeah, we're, we're waiting on that, but we do have confirmation that
[3:08:14.440 --> 3:08:16.680]  the Shakespeare in the park did have a happening.
[3:08:16.680 --> 3:08:18.440]  So we are awaiting, we are waiting that.
[3:08:18.440 --> 3:08:19.960]  Then they claim we're anti-free speech.
[3:08:19.960 --> 3:08:22.040]  It's the left disrupting stuff everywhere.
[3:08:22.040 --> 3:08:23.240]  Then calling for everyone to be murdered.
[3:08:23.240 --> 3:08:26.560]  We're just disrupting saying, please stop calling for murder.
[3:08:26.560 --> 3:08:27.560]  Exactly.
[3:08:27.560 --> 3:08:30.720]  We're telling them to disavow political violence, which shouldn't be hard.
[3:08:30.720 --> 3:08:34.200]  I want to air a few tapes and let you guys take over for like an hour and then I'm going
[3:08:34.200 --> 3:08:40.480]  to be back tomorrow to break all this down, but big takeaways from this.
[3:08:40.480 --> 3:08:42.320]  The MSM is so pathetic.
[3:08:42.320 --> 3:08:46.440]  They thought they could have a two week PR stunt against new media and then have some
[3:08:46.440 --> 3:08:51.080]  big victory against us and then roll out Tom Brokaw out of some crypt.
[3:08:51.080 --> 3:08:53.440]  This was a total defeat for them.
[3:08:53.440 --> 3:08:58.160]  Looks like some kind of van attack in the, in London.
[3:08:58.160 --> 3:08:59.160]  So it might be more breaking news.
[3:08:59.160 --> 3:09:01.200]  No, that was not, but it's not Muslims.
[3:09:01.200 --> 3:09:03.360]  Muslims never do anything wrong.
[3:09:03.360 --> 3:09:04.360]  It's lack going guys.
[3:09:04.360 --> 3:09:08.040]  Well, actually it's pray for those that have been attacked, but, but seriously, it's again,
[3:09:08.040 --> 3:09:09.200]  I keep going back to this.
[3:09:09.200 --> 3:09:10.200]  They're pathetic.
[3:09:10.200 --> 3:09:11.200]  They're a joke.
[3:09:11.200 --> 3:09:14.200]  That's why they're losing.
[3:09:14.200 --> 3:09:16.320]  They don't have endurance.
[3:09:16.320 --> 3:09:17.320]  They don't have energy.
[3:09:17.320 --> 3:09:18.320]  They can't.
[3:09:18.320 --> 3:09:19.320]  We could do this for, you know, 24 hours.
[3:09:19.320 --> 3:09:20.320]  We're working 12, 18 hours.
[3:09:20.320 --> 3:09:21.320]  Yeah, every day.
[3:09:21.320 --> 3:09:25.440]  It's a Sunday, you know, it's a Sunday and I'm up at the gym and then I'm doing streams
[3:09:25.440 --> 3:09:26.440]  with him all day.
[3:09:26.440 --> 3:09:27.440]  And I'm back here again.
[3:09:27.440 --> 3:09:28.440]  Stamina.
[3:09:28.440 --> 3:09:29.600]  We're breaking news right now.
[3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:32.120]  So those of you who don't know.
[3:09:32.120 --> 3:09:38.480]  So for those of you who don't know, there is a reported vehicle attack in London, another
[3:09:38.480 --> 3:09:39.480]  van attack.
[3:09:39.480 --> 3:09:41.080]  This is a developing story.
[3:09:41.080 --> 3:09:42.080]  So I don't know.
[3:09:42.080 --> 3:09:43.720]  It burned down like four buildings.
[3:09:43.720 --> 3:09:44.720]  So yeah, we don't know yet.
[3:09:44.720 --> 3:09:46.440]  We're still, you know, developing it right now.
[3:09:46.440 --> 3:09:52.960]  They're also protesters in front of the stage and Shakespeare in the park.
[3:09:52.960 --> 3:09:55.960]  So there could be another event going on there right now.
[3:09:55.960 --> 3:09:56.960]  There's so much news.
[3:09:56.960 --> 3:10:01.800]  And that is again, you know, it really is again, just know this, we're on the march.
[3:10:01.800 --> 3:10:02.800]  They're on the run.
[3:10:02.800 --> 3:10:03.800]  Keep taking action.
[3:10:03.800 --> 3:10:04.800]  Peacefully.
[3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:06.080]  We're going to win and share the links.
[3:10:06.080 --> 3:10:10.200]  I mean, share, share the links and go to info war store.com and get the products and
[3:10:10.200 --> 3:10:14.840]  support the mission because, you know, I want to hang out with balance today.
[3:10:14.840 --> 3:10:16.240]  I can tell you does not drive a Ferrari.
[3:10:16.240 --> 3:10:20.080]  I won't tell you what kind of car he drives because that, you know, Megan Kelly's fans
[3:10:20.080 --> 3:10:21.640]  might then stalk him.
[3:10:21.640 --> 3:10:25.040]  But the money isn't going to Ferraris the money, you know, the money isn't going to
[3:10:25.040 --> 3:10:27.980]  Ferraris and private jets or anything like that.
[3:10:27.980 --> 3:10:31.400]  The money is going to fund journalism to fund a real news.
[3:10:31.400 --> 3:10:37.560]  That is why NBC attacked Alex Jones so so viciously because readers support and viewers
[3:10:37.560 --> 3:10:39.280]  support the mission here.
[3:10:39.280 --> 3:10:40.280]  This is self funded.
[3:10:40.280 --> 3:10:41.840]  There are no advertising boycotts.
[3:10:41.840 --> 3:10:44.600]  They went after Bill O'Reilly with the advertising boycotts.
[3:10:44.600 --> 3:10:47.760]  They went after Sean Hannity with the advertising boycotts.
[3:10:47.760 --> 3:10:52.720]  They almost got them off air until we actually fought back, which is what the conservatives
[3:10:52.720 --> 3:10:53.800]  never do.
[3:10:53.800 --> 3:10:58.000]  So the infowarstore.com there is free shipping right now in my is the free shipping.
[3:10:58.000 --> 3:10:59.000]  Yes, sir.
[3:10:59.000 --> 3:11:00.160]  We've been live almost for four hours.
[3:11:00.160 --> 3:11:01.880]  The great cruise up here on Sunday.
[3:11:01.880 --> 3:11:02.880]  We have great products.
[3:11:02.880 --> 3:11:06.040]  Everybody needs and that's the final equation is financially supporting us getting game
[3:11:06.040 --> 3:11:07.040]  changing.
[3:11:07.040 --> 3:11:10.840]  Neutropics for your brain like brain force, the X2 for your body here.
[3:11:10.840 --> 3:11:12.440]  They were all they came in on a Sunday.
[3:11:12.440 --> 3:11:17.560]  That is how committed that is how committed everybody here is people came in on a Sunday.
[3:11:17.560 --> 3:11:19.160]  Dads came in during father's day.
[3:11:19.160 --> 3:11:22.920]  I'm missing my first father's day with my own daughter because what good is it?
[3:11:22.920 --> 3:11:27.160]  What good is it for me to be at home with my daughter?
[3:11:27.160 --> 3:11:30.880]  If the world is going to blow up because of fake news prevails because of terrorism happens
[3:11:30.880 --> 3:11:32.440]  because of left wing domestic.
[3:11:32.440 --> 3:11:33.440]  What good is it?
[3:11:33.440 --> 3:11:34.800]  That's the same thing with the money.
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:39.240]  That's why the money from infowarstore.com goes right back into hiring more people.
[3:11:39.240 --> 3:11:42.880]  We're about to expand big time because it's a death battle.
[3:11:42.880 --> 3:11:45.440]  I'm going to go to this clip and come back and have you guys take over for about 3040
[3:11:45.440 --> 3:11:46.440]  minutes.
[3:11:46.440 --> 3:11:48.200]  And I really appreciate the listeners and viewers and everybody else tomorrow will be
[3:11:48.200 --> 3:11:49.200]  taking a lot of calls.
[3:11:49.200 --> 3:11:52.560]  We'll take a lot of calls on air tomorrow, 11am when it kicks off and take calls all
[3:11:52.560 --> 3:11:53.560]  three, four hours.
[3:11:53.560 --> 3:11:58.880]  But I wanted to play Scott Adams describes how to radicalize a potential assassin.
[3:11:58.880 --> 3:12:04.520]  The left knows that when they're pushing murder and death and killing, it's going to cause
[3:12:04.520 --> 3:12:05.520]  this.
[3:12:05.520 --> 3:12:08.480]  But I don't understand their thought process because they're going to start a war with
[3:12:08.480 --> 3:12:09.480]  an armed citizenry.
[3:12:09.480 --> 3:12:15.360]  They're going to try to bring in martial law and enslave us when they're not even a warrior
[3:12:15.360 --> 3:12:16.360]  class of people.
[3:12:16.360 --> 3:12:20.560]  They are a dependent class, no matter what color they are, they are endoming victims.
[3:12:20.560 --> 3:12:23.120]  So it's almost like a baby tent tipper tantrum.
[3:12:23.120 --> 3:12:26.800]  So I want to play this clip, have you guys take over and then ask the question, where's
[3:12:26.800 --> 3:12:27.800]  this going?
[3:12:27.800 --> 3:12:32.040]  Again, I want to thank you all for watching continued coverage ongoing and we'll be releasing
[3:12:32.040 --> 3:12:35.200]  some of the behind the scenes Megan interview, but she flopped so bad.
[3:12:35.200 --> 3:12:39.040]  I'm still going to do it because I said I would, but this is a complete route.
[3:12:39.040 --> 3:12:40.680]  These people are complete joke.
[3:12:40.680 --> 3:12:46.600]  I mean, it's pathetic as I am, quite frankly, in a lot of my performance, even though it's
[3:12:46.600 --> 3:12:47.600]  edited.
[3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:49.840]  I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above them.
[3:12:49.840 --> 3:12:53.400]  So again, it's not too hard to beat these people breaking news man arrested after Van
[3:12:53.400 --> 3:12:55.920]  plows into people outside of a London mosque.
[3:12:55.920 --> 3:12:58.440]  So we have more outside of London mosque.
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:13:02.760]  Anyway, those clips off, I'll follow up the story and see what we've got going on.
[3:13:02.760 --> 3:13:07.680]  But it has nothing to do with Islam.
[3:13:07.680 --> 3:13:08.680]  Right?
[3:13:08.680 --> 3:13:10.880]  So never, then they say we're anti Islam.
[3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:14.360]  Yeah, I'm anti stone age insanity.
[3:13:14.360 --> 3:13:16.320]  Women wearing beekeeper suits.
[3:13:16.320 --> 3:13:21.040]  But I interviewed a Muslim actually who believes that Muslims should stay in Muslim countries
[3:13:21.040 --> 3:13:24.360]  because it makes them less likely to send what about, what about how more and more Muslims
[3:13:24.360 --> 3:13:27.120]  just want to be free and actually becoming heretics, people go, Oh, I don't Muslim.
[3:13:27.120 --> 3:13:28.120]  They're really cool.
[3:13:28.120 --> 3:13:29.120]  Yeah.
[3:13:29.120 --> 3:13:30.120]  Cause they're not a Muslim.
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:35.760]  I mean, seriously, seriously, think about this.
[3:13:35.760 --> 3:13:41.900]  I mean, these people, I don't want to just bash some group of people, folks, Islamic countries
[3:13:41.900 --> 3:13:43.400]  are not fun.
[3:13:43.400 --> 3:13:47.480]  Well, that's why, you know, if they want to come over here and adopt American violence,
[3:13:47.480 --> 3:13:48.480]  that's the whole thing.
[3:13:48.480 --> 3:13:49.480]  That's the thing.
[3:13:49.480 --> 3:13:54.640]  This is a good point to address because I've always addressed it with my people is that
[3:13:54.640 --> 3:13:58.400]  Muslims who come to America and want to adapt to Western values and Western cultures, you'll
[3:13:58.400 --> 3:14:00.080]  never hear me criticize them.
[3:14:00.080 --> 3:14:03.160]  You'll never hear me say, Oh my God, if you want to come in and you want to conform, if
[3:14:03.160 --> 3:14:05.600]  you want to keep some of that tradition or whatever without cutting your daughter's
[3:14:05.600 --> 3:14:09.280]  genitals off or beekeeper suits or blowing stuff up or, you know, getting on welfare
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:12.920]  and doing nothing, you want to come here and get vestigial to keep your Islamism.
[3:14:12.920 --> 3:14:13.920]  That's fine.
[3:14:13.920 --> 3:14:15.480]  As long as you're a big fat, juicy heritage.
[3:14:15.480 --> 3:14:16.480]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:14:16.480 --> 3:14:19.880]  And, but we don't want people to come over and change the American way of life.
[3:14:19.880 --> 3:14:21.200]  You have, you know, daughters.
[3:14:21.200 --> 3:14:25.840]  I have them in Germany, in October fest, they had to cancel it like in Berlin and Cologne
[3:14:25.840 --> 3:14:28.040]  because they'll beat people up drinking beer.
[3:14:28.040 --> 3:14:29.520]  I can't believe the Germans roll over to that.
[3:14:29.520 --> 3:14:30.520]  I'm drinking a beer.
[3:14:30.520 --> 3:14:32.160]  Somebody walks over and punches me.
[3:14:32.160 --> 3:14:33.160]  The Germans.
[3:14:33.160 --> 3:14:35.920]  Well, they had to cancel music festivals to their whole, their entire way of life is
[3:14:35.920 --> 3:14:40.240]  changing in Sweden and Germany and in all over Europe, because if they have a music
[3:14:40.240 --> 3:14:43.920]  festival and women show up, rape gangs will, will float around them.
[3:14:43.920 --> 3:14:48.040]  So meanwhile we're supposed to be told that there's a video of those rapes.
[3:14:48.040 --> 3:14:49.040]  Yeah.
[3:14:49.040 --> 3:14:50.040]  It's crazy.
[3:14:50.040 --> 3:14:52.560]  It is the most these liberal women are being raped by like 20 guys, they're like, the cops
[3:14:52.560 --> 3:14:53.560]  won't help them.
[3:14:53.560 --> 3:14:54.560]  Yeah.
[3:14:54.560 --> 3:14:57.360]  They grab them, throw them up against the car and just take turns 20 people, which that's
[3:14:57.360 --> 3:14:58.360]  so vile.
[3:14:58.360 --> 3:15:03.800]  I can't imagine even, you know, in any context wanting to do that, but it's common.
[3:15:03.800 --> 3:15:08.080]  But then meanwhile we're told that there's a rape culture in college universities and
[3:15:08.080 --> 3:15:12.800]  that if you have a few beers and you have sex after a few beers, somehow that's rape.
[3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:13.800]  Rape culture is bad.
[3:15:13.800 --> 3:15:14.800]  Yeah.
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:16.880]  Cause if the next day she decided she didn't want to do it because you're both drunk.
[3:15:16.880 --> 3:15:17.880]  Now that's right.
[3:15:17.880 --> 3:15:18.880]  Yeah.
[3:15:18.880 --> 3:15:20.720]  So Muslims are allowed to rape because it's their culture.
[3:15:20.720 --> 3:15:23.320]  But then if a woman gets drunk and has sex, oh, you date rape.
[3:15:23.320 --> 3:15:24.320]  Yeah.
[3:15:24.320 --> 3:15:27.640]  So this whole migration is actually rape culture, but they won't address it.
[3:15:27.640 --> 3:15:30.320]  Bill Clinton or as the rapist, they won't address that.
[3:15:30.320 --> 3:15:31.720]  Anthony Weiner is a pedophile.
[3:15:31.720 --> 3:15:32.720]  They won't address that.
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:37.480]  Jacob Schwartz, who is a campaign worker for Bill de Blasio, Mayor Bill de Blasio,
[3:15:37.480 --> 3:15:42.920]  who actually insulted you with the Megan Kelly thing, his staff for child pornographer,
[3:15:42.920 --> 3:15:48.320]  Robbie Moog, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, pictured in pictures with this child
[3:15:48.320 --> 3:15:49.920]  pornographer, Jacob Schwartz.
[3:15:49.920 --> 3:15:53.320]  You know who hosted Jacob Schwartz and gave him a platform, CNN.
[3:15:53.320 --> 3:15:58.600]  He went on to CNN and talked, he's a child pornographer and CNN will welcome child pornographers
[3:15:58.600 --> 3:15:59.600]  on.
[3:15:59.600 --> 3:16:00.600]  That's the world we live in.
[3:16:00.600 --> 3:16:02.400]  That's how vile these people are in the media.
[3:16:02.400 --> 3:16:04.160]  But meanwhile, but you're the problem.
[3:16:04.160 --> 3:16:07.600]  So if you're a pedophile like Anthony Weiner, they want to make you the president.
[3:16:07.600 --> 3:16:11.800]  If you're spreading your child pornography like Jacob Schwartz was, then they will put
[3:16:11.800 --> 3:16:16.400]  you on CNN and feature you and listen to what you have to say and praise you and give you
[3:16:16.400 --> 3:16:17.400]  a platform.
[3:16:17.400 --> 3:16:21.640]  That's the guy who shouldn't have a platform, but they'll give the pedophiles a platform
[3:16:21.640 --> 3:16:25.400]  to normalize it to get people used to singing pedophiles because they want to lower the
[3:16:25.400 --> 3:16:27.720]  age of consent, of course, to, you know, eight or nine.
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:29.520]  Look at that article from the BBC the other day.
[3:16:29.520 --> 3:16:30.520]  Was it yesterday?
[3:16:30.520 --> 3:16:31.520]  Yeah.
[3:16:31.520 --> 3:16:32.520]  Trying to normalize it?
[3:16:32.520 --> 3:16:33.520]  Yeah, the BBC.
[3:16:33.520 --> 3:16:34.520]  Yeah.
[3:16:34.520 --> 3:16:37.960]  It's like a lawn with like a creepy guy and there's like, I like five year old girls.
[3:16:37.960 --> 3:16:38.960]  They're like dancing around.
[3:16:38.960 --> 3:16:42.000]  They'll probably take my clip of me imitating him and said, I said that, you know, like
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  Jones says he likes, you know, right?
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  Oh, we got a picture.
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:48.320]  Oh, it's a document cam shot of a hand.
[3:16:48.320 --> 3:16:49.320]  Here we go.
[3:16:49.320 --> 3:16:53.440]  We got folks running up on stage Shakespeare in the park.
[3:16:53.440 --> 3:16:55.040]  This is breaking news right now.
[3:16:55.040 --> 3:16:56.040]  Breaking news.
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:16:59.280]  We have people running up to the stage Shakespeare in the park.
[3:16:59.280 --> 3:17:01.320]  Right now I just got this from a source.
[3:17:01.320 --> 3:17:04.880]  So we're, you know, we're finding out what exactly happened.
[3:17:04.880 --> 3:17:05.880]  What transpired?
[3:17:05.880 --> 3:17:06.880]  I don't know.
[3:17:06.880 --> 3:17:09.840]  But with the, with the nature of breaking news, we can only show things as it's happening.
[3:17:09.840 --> 3:17:13.720]  And then of course we'll update it as we get more details and as I get more tips from
[3:17:13.720 --> 3:17:14.720]  my sources right now.
[3:17:14.720 --> 3:17:15.720]  All right.
[3:17:15.720 --> 3:17:16.720]  Great job.
[3:17:16.720 --> 3:17:17.720]  All right.
[3:17:17.720 --> 3:17:18.720]  We're going to go to this tape.
[3:17:18.720 --> 3:17:19.720]  We're going to come back.
[3:17:19.720 --> 3:17:20.720]  Let you guys take over in the closing.
[3:17:20.720 --> 3:17:21.720]  Great job.
[3:17:21.720 --> 3:17:22.720]  The crew.
[3:17:22.720 --> 3:17:28.080]  But I tell you emblematically bringing out, I love old people, but when they bring some
[3:17:28.080 --> 3:17:34.640]  guy 15 years out of retirement, roll him up and he looks like he doesn't know what planet
[3:17:34.640 --> 3:17:35.640]  he's on.
[3:17:35.640 --> 3:17:39.800]  He goes, Oh, here's the video.
[3:17:39.800 --> 3:17:42.360]  Can we play the audio of this?
[3:17:42.360 --> 3:17:43.360]  Go ahead.
[3:17:43.360 --> 3:17:44.360]  Six seconds.
[3:17:44.360 --> 3:17:47.760]  Oh, they're also pissed off.
[3:17:47.760 --> 3:17:49.760]  We're going to interrupt all your events.
[3:17:49.760 --> 3:17:50.760]  But what the hell are you doing?
[3:17:50.760 --> 3:17:51.760]  Interrupted our events.
[3:17:51.760 --> 3:18:04.640]  This is not the main production of Caesar.
[3:18:04.640 --> 3:18:08.520]  This is some other production that I don't think is the one.
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:10.560]  No, no, it isn't real.
[3:18:10.560 --> 3:18:11.560]  It isn't even real.
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:12.560]  That's the whole point.
[3:18:12.560 --> 3:18:14.880]  It's not a big switch because they said it was still going on.
[3:18:14.880 --> 3:18:17.400]  They in the real and we like have people storm.
[3:18:17.400 --> 3:18:19.760]  We talked to folks that are storming an innocent event.
[3:18:19.760 --> 3:18:24.120]  Yeah, so here I'll, yeah, so protesters is about final performance of Trump assassination
[3:18:24.120 --> 3:18:25.640]  playing Central Park.
[3:18:25.640 --> 3:18:27.160]  Liberal hate kills.
[3:18:27.160 --> 3:18:28.160]  There's a video here.
[3:18:28.160 --> 3:18:29.720]  I'm going to go ahead and text that right now.
[3:18:29.720 --> 3:18:32.280]  So hopefully, I guess that's another Trump lookalike they're killing.
[3:18:32.280 --> 3:18:33.780]  Everybody's copying it.
[3:18:33.780 --> 3:18:35.680]  So yeah, there's a new brand new thing.
[3:18:35.680 --> 3:18:36.680]  So hold on.
[3:18:36.680 --> 3:18:38.520]  Let me text the story so we can get it pulled up.
[3:18:38.520 --> 3:18:41.720]  Jim Hoff to the Gateway Pundit actually, I think broke this.
[3:18:41.720 --> 3:18:48.960]  So if you want to go to Gateway Pundit at Gateway Pundit, that's Jim Hoff right now and it looks
[3:18:48.960 --> 3:18:50.640]  like he has the video.
[3:18:50.640 --> 3:18:55.280]  I don't have the, I don't have the video just yet, but that'll be interesting.
[3:18:55.280 --> 3:18:56.280]  That'll be look forward to.
[3:18:56.280 --> 3:18:57.280]  Yeah.
[3:18:57.280 --> 3:18:59.400]  So it's right now on Twitter is at Gateway Pundit.
[3:18:59.400 --> 3:19:00.400]  Jim Hoff.
[3:19:00.400 --> 3:19:01.400]  I also just retweeted it.
[3:19:01.400 --> 3:19:02.400]  You can get the article.
[3:19:02.400 --> 3:19:04.800]  And you know, it's a good feeling knowing there's all these other organizations as well.
[3:19:04.800 --> 3:19:06.200]  Because sometimes I'm tired.
[3:19:06.200 --> 3:19:07.200]  I see something break up.
[3:19:07.200 --> 3:19:08.200]  Oh, somebody don't handle it.
[3:19:08.200 --> 3:19:09.200]  10 years ago.
[3:19:09.200 --> 3:19:10.200]  It wasn't that case.
[3:19:10.200 --> 3:19:11.200]  No.
[3:19:11.200 --> 3:19:12.200]  It's a different one.
[3:19:12.200 --> 3:19:13.200]  All right, gentlemen, you're kicking ass.
[3:19:13.200 --> 3:19:14.200]  Oh, look at this.
[3:19:14.200 --> 3:19:18.640]  Germany says a hundred million African refugees, I mean, Muslims could head north
[3:19:18.640 --> 3:19:19.640]  soon.
[3:19:19.640 --> 3:19:24.080]  So the answer is capitulate, let more in or they'll bring more.
[3:19:24.080 --> 3:19:25.080]  Let's go to this.
[3:19:25.080 --> 3:19:28.400]  Scott Adams describes how to radicalize potential assassin.
[3:19:28.400 --> 3:19:33.440]  And then we'll have the final installment with our guest host, Mike Cernovich.
[3:19:33.440 --> 3:19:36.560]  I'm Alex Jones, Megan Kelly blew herself up.
[3:19:36.560 --> 3:19:37.560]  Not me.
[3:19:37.560 --> 3:19:43.880]  One of the one of the traps when you're watching the news is you think you have an all or that
[3:19:43.880 --> 3:19:48.200]  you've considered all the angles or that people have talked about everything and nobody's
[3:19:48.200 --> 3:19:49.200]  even close.
[3:19:49.200 --> 3:19:53.640]  There's an enormous, most important part, in fact, the only part.
[3:19:53.640 --> 3:19:58.720]  I would argue the only part that's important in this discussion of have people been radicalized
[3:19:58.720 --> 3:20:00.200]  by the media or social media.
[3:20:00.200 --> 3:20:04.960]  The only part that's important is the part that I haven't seen anybody talk about.
[3:20:04.960 --> 3:20:06.720]  So I'm going to talk about it.
[3:20:06.720 --> 3:20:12.760]  So what's missing, like deeply missing in this whole conversation is somebody who has
[3:20:12.760 --> 3:20:18.920]  an ounce of training in cognitive science, somebody better than me, on these shows to
[3:20:18.920 --> 3:20:22.920]  say, well, here are the messages that the left is putting out, here are the messages
[3:20:22.920 --> 3:20:24.560]  that the right's putting out.
[3:20:24.560 --> 3:20:25.560]  Which ones are these?
[3:20:25.560 --> 3:20:31.480]  Hey, Christina, which one of these are weaponized?
[3:20:31.480 --> 3:20:36.240]  Some of the messages from both sides, I would say, are weaponized.
[3:20:36.240 --> 3:20:40.120]  And you could absolutely blame them for influencing people.
[3:20:40.120 --> 3:20:44.880]  Now the reason, yes, dark, but much of it's not.
[3:20:44.880 --> 3:20:53.000]  So I would say that if you were to compare the comparisons of Trump to a dark, strong
[3:20:53.000 --> 3:20:56.640]  man who was going to round people up for concentration camps, which is sort of the
[3:20:56.640 --> 3:21:08.760]  messaging coming out of the left, that is unambiguously, let's say it's a moral justification
[3:21:08.760 --> 3:21:10.760]  for murder.
[3:21:10.760 --> 3:21:17.320]  If you think there's an actual Hitler, an actual literal Hitler coming to power, you
[3:21:17.320 --> 3:21:20.760]  have the moral authority to assassinate him.
[3:21:20.760 --> 3:21:25.000]  Now most people are not motivated, and most people are motivated to do anything, much
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:26.000]  less assassinate.
[3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:31.880]  But when you're talking about hundreds of millions of people, and let's say tens of
[3:21:31.880 --> 3:21:37.280]  millions, there might be 10 million people in this country, and 300, whatever million,
[3:21:37.280 --> 3:21:43.160]  there might be 10 million people who are close enough to the line of, gosh, I think I need
[3:21:43.160 --> 3:21:47.400]  to kill this guy, that a little messaging would make the difference.
[3:21:47.400 --> 3:21:54.080]  Now it won't make any difference to 99, 95%, whatever, of people.
[3:21:54.080 --> 3:21:59.080]  Most people are going to hear, you know, are going to see the murder of the president
[3:21:59.080 --> 3:22:02.280]  in a play and say, well, it's just a play, doesn't mean anything.
[3:22:02.280 --> 3:22:03.840]  Most people will.
[3:22:03.840 --> 3:22:08.800]  So if you're on the side that says people are responsible for their own behavior, you
[3:22:08.800 --> 3:22:11.360]  don't know anything about science.
[3:22:11.360 --> 3:22:16.480]  Because science knows that people can be influenced, just not every one of them.
[3:22:16.480 --> 3:22:20.520]  And it knows that people won't know why they were influenced, because you can ask them
[3:22:20.520 --> 3:22:23.920]  later and they won't know why.
[3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:32.160]  So this whole notion from the left, or even some libertarians, I've seen even on Fox News
[3:22:32.160 --> 3:22:36.520]  people are saying, unambiguously, they're saying, people are responsible for their own
[3:22:36.520 --> 3:22:37.520]  actions.
[3:22:37.520 --> 3:22:38.520]  Period.
[3:22:38.520 --> 3:22:44.360]  Yes, they're legally responsible for their own actions, but they don't control them.
[3:22:44.360 --> 3:22:48.720]  What controls them is whatever inputs are coming in, and then whatever is the brain
[3:22:48.720 --> 3:22:50.200]  architecture they have.
[3:22:50.200 --> 3:22:54.480]  But that is separate from the question, and needs to be separate from the question here,
[3:22:54.480 --> 3:22:59.440]  of whether a trained persuader, or a group of them, or a bunch of professionals trying
[3:22:59.440 --> 3:23:06.640]  to influence politics, if they could absolutely, every time, cause somebody to get violent,
[3:23:06.640 --> 3:23:10.200]  if they worked at it long enough, and on a large enough group of people, and the answer
[3:23:10.200 --> 3:23:16.880]  is absolutely.
[3:23:16.880 --> 3:23:21.280]  Emre Beck, Mike Sermich, guest hosting for another half an hour, Alex Jones has stepped
[3:23:21.280 --> 3:23:22.280]  out.
[3:23:22.280 --> 3:23:27.600]  So we do have video footage of the protesters storming the stage at Shakespeare in the park.
[3:23:27.600 --> 3:23:30.160]  The liberals are again mad, and they're saying this is going to backfire.
[3:23:30.160 --> 3:23:32.440]  You guys are worse than I am on your phones, though.
[3:23:32.440 --> 3:23:33.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:23:33.440 --> 3:23:36.520]  This is a transmission that's phone free, but I need mine.
[3:23:36.520 --> 3:23:38.720]  Breaking news.
[3:23:38.720 --> 3:23:41.960]  Breaking news, we want to keep you updated in real time, and this is where it's happening.
[3:23:41.960 --> 3:23:44.960]  So hold on, let me, we got the champagne, so we might as well.
[3:23:44.960 --> 3:23:45.960]  We might as well refill up, yeah.
[3:23:45.960 --> 3:23:47.040]  Yeah, we might as well drink it while we're here.
[3:23:47.040 --> 3:23:51.640]  We're toasting to the end of globalist media, or at least a short term, I mean, and life
[3:23:51.640 --> 3:23:52.640]  is never over.
[3:23:52.640 --> 3:23:53.640]  The game is never over.
[3:23:53.640 --> 3:23:54.640]  You've never won.
[3:23:54.640 --> 3:23:56.200]  It never stops.
[3:23:56.200 --> 3:23:59.240]  Life is struggle, and then it ends, if you're lucky.
[3:23:59.240 --> 3:24:01.760]  So cheers to all of you listening at home.
[3:24:01.760 --> 3:24:06.640]  We do have the video footage now of the protesters storming the stage.
[3:24:06.640 --> 3:24:11.960]  So I just tweeted that out, so if the people in the, producing it, the great people producing
[3:24:11.960 --> 3:24:12.960]  on a Sunday.
[3:24:12.960 --> 3:24:17.360]  Again, people don't appreciate that we go all day, and we go all day, and we go all
[3:24:17.360 --> 3:24:18.860]  day hard.
[3:24:18.860 --> 3:24:23.200]  They're actually here right now, Father's Day, Sunday working, and it's just another
[3:24:23.200 --> 3:24:24.320]  day I work every day a week.
[3:24:24.320 --> 3:24:25.320]  How about you?
[3:24:25.320 --> 3:24:26.320]  Absolutely.
[3:24:26.320 --> 3:24:28.320]  You know, 12 to 18 hours every single day.
[3:24:28.320 --> 3:24:30.320]  We have users from all over the world.
[3:24:30.320 --> 3:24:35.040]  News is happening every day, every minute of every day.
[3:24:35.040 --> 3:24:36.040]  You got to put in the work.
[3:24:36.040 --> 3:24:39.600]  You got to have the stamina, and you guys have been going since 9 or 10 this morning
[3:24:39.600 --> 3:24:40.600]  was your first periscope?
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:42.480]  Yeah, we started periscoping at 9 or 10, yeah.
[3:24:42.480 --> 3:24:46.120]  So if you scroll down a little bit, the first tweet under the pen tweet, that's the video
[3:24:46.120 --> 3:24:50.680]  the protest is storming the stage, so yeah, let's check that out, and get that, because
[3:24:50.680 --> 3:24:52.440]  I actually haven't seen this video myself.
[3:24:52.440 --> 3:24:53.440]  I just tweeted a link out.
[3:24:53.440 --> 3:24:55.440]  Let's take a look.
[3:24:55.440 --> 3:24:57.440]  Goals will be proud.
[3:24:57.440 --> 3:24:59.440]  Goals will be proud.
[3:24:59.440 --> 3:25:03.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll pause here for a second.
[3:25:03.440 --> 3:25:04.440]  Wow.
[3:25:04.440 --> 3:25:09.440]  Wow, they really took him down.
[3:25:09.440 --> 3:25:13.440]  Looks like they prepared this time.
[3:25:13.440 --> 3:25:14.440]  Wow.
[3:25:14.440 --> 3:25:15.440]  Thank you.
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:28.520]  Actors, let's pick up, please, with it, it is no matter.
[3:25:28.520 --> 3:25:32.040]  And there are actually four people there, so that was just one of them.
[3:25:32.040 --> 3:25:37.480]  So I know that I was tipped out earlier by the source that four people actually do have
[3:25:37.480 --> 3:25:38.480]  tickets on.
[3:25:38.480 --> 3:25:42.880]  So I'm reading a reaction from Matt Pierce at LA Times who says, the right protesting
[3:25:42.880 --> 3:25:48.200]  Shakespeare is a mistake because they spent the past three years showing high-profile
[3:25:48.200 --> 3:25:52.120]  protest can lead to backlash, and that this is a bad mistake.
[3:25:52.120 --> 3:25:54.440]  Okay, so here's where they're wrong.
[3:25:54.440 --> 3:25:56.960]  I kind of want to address that because it's caused a lot of controversy.
[3:25:56.960 --> 3:25:59.800]  People say, Mike Sturridge, how can you support free speech?
[3:25:59.800 --> 3:26:01.960]  And yet you think that this is fun.
[3:26:01.960 --> 3:26:05.760]  Okay, if our people do this all the time, I'm going to have problem with it.
[3:26:05.760 --> 3:26:09.840]  If every time there's a play, every time something happens, people storm the stage, I'm going
[3:26:09.840 --> 3:26:11.600]  to say, all right, enough is enough.
[3:26:11.600 --> 3:26:15.560]  One or two times, no, one or two times you're sending a message, you're saying, okay, those
[3:26:15.560 --> 3:26:19.880]  of you who try to ignore that, those of you who tried to pretend like this wasn't happening,
[3:26:19.880 --> 3:26:21.600]  now you're going to have to deal with protests.
[3:26:21.600 --> 3:26:27.320]  So if my side, whatever that is, starts acting like this every day, then I'm going to have
[3:26:27.320 --> 3:26:28.360]  a problem with it.
[3:26:28.360 --> 3:26:34.680]  But the issue here is that our people have graduated to, maybe they take the stage peacefully
[3:26:34.680 --> 3:26:38.800]  for 30 seconds, whereas on the left, they're hitting people in the head with bike locks
[3:26:38.800 --> 3:26:39.800]  and killing people.
[3:26:39.800 --> 3:26:40.800]  Right.
[3:26:40.800 --> 3:26:45.920]  There's two people, a handful of people for 30 to 60 seconds doing a very peaceful protest.
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:47.280]  They're not being violent.
[3:26:47.280 --> 3:26:52.680]  We have Trump supporters throughout the entire campaign being hit with bricks, being egged
[3:26:52.680 --> 3:26:55.680]  in the face, being attacked, punched, having their things stolen.
[3:26:55.680 --> 3:27:02.640]  I was at the San Jose rally in June of 2016 and saw the violence firsthand on the streets.
[3:27:02.640 --> 3:27:04.040]  That's not what's happening here.
[3:27:04.040 --> 3:27:05.240]  It's a peaceful protest.
[3:27:05.240 --> 3:27:08.160]  That is a form of expression and free speech itself.
[3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:09.160]  And that is allowed.
[3:27:09.160 --> 3:27:10.920]  That's covered by the First Amendment.
[3:27:10.920 --> 3:27:11.920]  Yeah.
[3:27:11.920 --> 3:27:15.840]  And again, I just, I want to get my, I guess, my position clear here.
[3:27:15.840 --> 3:27:20.960]  If people were storming the stages every day and it became like a common thing, then I
[3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:21.960]  would say, all right, come on, man.
[3:27:21.960 --> 3:27:22.960]  You're getting old.
[3:27:22.960 --> 3:27:23.960]  Come on.
[3:27:23.960 --> 3:27:24.960]  Come on.
[3:27:24.960 --> 3:27:25.960]  It's a play.
[3:27:25.960 --> 3:27:26.960]  Let's do it.
[3:27:26.960 --> 3:27:29.840]  But one time, maybe two times to send a message, because here's what I love.
[3:27:29.840 --> 3:27:32.000]  Everybody on the left now is saying, wow, this is bullshit.
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  This is terrible.
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:34.000]  I can't believe you're doing this.
[3:27:34.000 --> 3:27:35.000]  Because it's happened to them.
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:36.000]  I'm like, thanks, bro.
[3:27:36.000 --> 3:27:37.000]  Right.
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:38.000]  Thanks.
[3:27:38.000 --> 3:27:39.000]  Where the fuck have you been?
[3:27:39.000 --> 3:27:40.000]  For a long time.
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:41.200]  Oh, oh, you're so triggered now.
[3:27:41.200 --> 3:27:42.920]  You know, welcome to our world.
[3:27:42.920 --> 3:27:43.920]  Have a little bit of empathy.
[3:27:43.920 --> 3:27:45.880]  Well, that's the part is that it started a dialogue.
[3:27:45.880 --> 3:27:49.440]  It started a national conversation about these things that are happening.
[3:27:49.440 --> 3:27:53.680]  And you know, we can center the focus on, well, okay, we're doing it peacefully and we're
[3:27:53.680 --> 3:27:54.680]  protesting peacefully.
[3:27:54.680 --> 3:27:58.360]  You know, what about the violence that is coming from the other side at our events?
[3:27:58.360 --> 3:28:02.760]  You know, Milo Unopolis can't even speak at university without things being lit on fire
[3:28:02.760 --> 3:28:03.760]  and destroyed.
[3:28:03.760 --> 3:28:04.760]  Yeah.
[3:28:04.760 --> 3:28:05.760]  They riot.
[3:28:05.760 --> 3:28:10.160]  And the left riots, which is a cracks me up about the whole conversation.
[3:28:10.160 --> 3:28:11.720]  People are using this false equivalency.
[3:28:11.720 --> 3:28:15.960]  They're saying it's kind of like, well, everybody has assholes.
[3:28:15.960 --> 3:28:16.960]  No.
[3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:22.400]  We have a couple of people one time take a stage for 30 seconds and express disapproval
[3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:23.400]  of violence.
[3:28:23.400 --> 3:28:24.400]  Mm hmm.
[3:28:24.400 --> 3:28:25.400]  That's our side.
[3:28:25.400 --> 3:28:26.880]  That's the worst of our side.
[3:28:26.880 --> 3:28:34.040]  Their side has the rapists, the pedophiles, the bike lock professor, people macing people,
[3:28:34.040 --> 3:28:36.360]  the riots they have in Tifa.
[3:28:36.360 --> 3:28:37.720]  They have the violence.
[3:28:37.720 --> 3:28:38.920]  They have the violence in the street.
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:43.920]  Daily caller actually did an article cataloging 200 attacks against conservative people.
[3:28:43.920 --> 3:28:47.400]  So there's a litany of violence on their side and we have people disrupting.
[3:28:47.400 --> 3:28:48.400]  So there is no.
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:49.560]  We have to play for 30 seconds.
[3:28:49.560 --> 3:28:50.560]  Yeah.
[3:28:50.560 --> 3:28:51.560]  There are assholes on both sides.
[3:28:51.560 --> 3:28:53.440]  It's such a bullshit narrative.
[3:28:53.440 --> 3:28:59.400]  But the flip side is, yeah, the list of attacks against conservatives is mind blowing a wave
[3:28:59.400 --> 3:29:04.360]  of liberal rage has marked the past 11 months since the rise in election of Donald Trump.
[3:29:04.360 --> 3:29:05.800]  So it's just a way of life.
[3:29:05.800 --> 3:29:10.960]  There was a truck actually three days ago that was shot at, had a MAGA, MAGA flag was
[3:29:10.960 --> 3:29:12.960]  shot at, drive by shooting against it.
[3:29:12.960 --> 3:29:19.180]  So this idea that there are assholes on both sides is completely dishonest.
[3:29:19.180 --> 3:29:22.240]  That said, at least we got the liberals calling them assholes.
[3:29:22.240 --> 3:29:23.240]  Right.
[3:29:23.240 --> 3:29:27.600]  They went from, well, it's not happening or maybe it's not happening much or hate is
[3:29:27.600 --> 3:29:28.600]  in a big deal to them.
[3:29:28.600 --> 3:29:29.600]  Yeah.
[3:29:29.600 --> 3:29:30.960]  Oh, well, there are assholes on both sides.
[3:29:30.960 --> 3:29:31.960]  Right.
[3:29:31.960 --> 3:29:32.960]  Well, good.
[3:29:32.960 --> 3:29:33.960]  Now you're meeting their assholes at least.
[3:29:33.960 --> 3:29:34.960]  Right.
[3:29:34.960 --> 3:29:35.960]  Exactly.
[3:29:35.960 --> 3:29:39.040]  I think, you know, as a Trump supporter, you're in fear, you know, you don't want to have
[3:29:39.040 --> 3:29:40.040]  that bumper sticker.
[3:29:40.040 --> 3:29:41.200]  You don't want to wear that MAGA hat.
[3:29:41.200 --> 3:29:48.040]  Tell them what happened after I was walking away from the rally in Austin when a guy that
[3:29:48.040 --> 3:29:51.880]  attempted to sucker punch man punched him back when I was doing a periscope and we were
[3:29:51.880 --> 3:29:53.440]  in front of that barbecue restaurant.
[3:29:53.440 --> 3:29:54.440]  What happened?
[3:29:54.440 --> 3:29:55.440]  Where's the coverage of that?
[3:29:55.440 --> 3:29:56.440]  Where?
[3:29:56.440 --> 3:29:57.440]  Well, yeah.
[3:29:57.440 --> 3:30:01.240]  We were in front of the, yeah, you were live streaming and there was a guy eyeing you up
[3:30:01.240 --> 3:30:06.560]  and he was there was a guy eyeing you up and I said, Hey, Mike, you got to watch this
[3:30:06.560 --> 3:30:07.560]  guy.
[3:30:07.560 --> 3:30:09.240]  This guy's, you know, coming behind you and he looked like he was about to come up and
[3:30:09.240 --> 3:30:11.040]  sucker punch you because he recognized you.
[3:30:11.040 --> 3:30:13.600]  He knew he were and he knew he listened to what you were saying.
[3:30:13.600 --> 3:30:14.800]  So I just, you know, gave you a heads up.
[3:30:14.800 --> 3:30:17.000]  I said, Hey, Mike, turn around and watch this guy behind you.
[3:30:17.000 --> 3:30:18.640]  It looks like he's going to sucker punch you.
[3:30:18.640 --> 3:30:19.640]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:30:19.640 --> 3:30:23.360]  And it was either you or someone else who heard people say, Hey, that's sort of it.
[3:30:23.360 --> 3:30:24.360]  Right.
[3:30:24.360 --> 3:30:25.360]  Right.
[3:30:25.360 --> 3:30:26.360]  Exactly.
[3:30:26.360 --> 3:30:28.800]  And I'm going to do a live stream and exercise my free speech rights.
[3:30:28.800 --> 3:30:31.320]  I might get punched in the face, but oh no.
[3:30:31.320 --> 3:30:32.320]  Oh no.
[3:30:32.320 --> 3:30:33.320]  Somebody went on the stage and Shakespeare.
[3:30:33.320 --> 3:30:34.320]  Oh my God.
[3:30:34.320 --> 3:30:35.320]  People out of control.
[3:30:35.320 --> 3:30:37.080]  What happened to dialogue in this country?
[3:30:37.080 --> 3:30:38.800]  What happened to civil dialogue?
[3:30:38.800 --> 3:30:39.800]  Yeah.
[3:30:39.800 --> 3:30:42.400]  So it's unbelievable.
[3:30:42.400 --> 3:30:43.400]  Come back in Alex.
[3:30:43.400 --> 3:30:44.400]  Come join the fun, buddy.
[3:30:44.400 --> 3:30:45.400]  I'm watching you guys.
[3:30:45.400 --> 3:30:46.400]  We're still crew.
[3:30:46.400 --> 3:30:47.400]  And so is the viewers.
[3:30:47.400 --> 3:30:48.400]  Yeah.
[3:30:48.400 --> 3:30:49.400]  So high energy towards.
[3:30:49.400 --> 3:30:50.400]  None of this is evident.
[3:30:50.400 --> 3:30:51.400]  No, we are.
[3:30:51.400 --> 3:30:52.400]  Exactly.
[3:30:52.400 --> 3:30:53.400]  We don't add it.
[3:30:53.400 --> 3:30:54.400]  We don't need to.
[3:30:54.400 --> 3:30:56.400]  We don't need to.
[3:30:56.400 --> 3:30:57.400]  We don't need to edit.
[3:30:57.400 --> 3:30:59.400]  And we can do this for 12 hours a day.
[3:30:59.400 --> 3:31:02.200]  By the way, how can people find out more about you who are just tuning in?
[3:31:02.200 --> 3:31:03.200]  Yeah.
[3:31:03.200 --> 3:31:05.400]  Go to gab www.gab.ai.
[3:31:05.400 --> 3:31:06.880]  So gab is a new social network.

[3:31:12.000 --> 3:31:13.880]  flow of information online.

[3:31:23.800 --> 3:31:24.800]  Right.
[3:31:24.800 --> 3:31:25.800]  And then is it your co-founder?
[3:31:25.800 --> 3:31:26.800]  I'm like Muslim or something.
[3:31:26.800 --> 3:31:27.800]  Yes.
[3:31:27.800 --> 3:31:28.800]  My co-founder is in Turkey.
[3:31:28.800 --> 3:31:29.800]  He's a Muslim.
[3:31:29.800 --> 3:31:30.800]  He's occurred.
[3:31:30.800 --> 3:31:35.000]  You know, our CCO is Indian and a practicing Hindu fucking media.
[3:31:35.000 --> 3:31:36.000]  It's incredible.

[3:31:56.880 --> 3:31:59.600]  We're not, you know, mass data collecting.
[3:31:59.600 --> 3:32:04.080]  We're supported by the people through donations and through pro subscriptions and pro is just

[3:32:10.760 --> 3:32:11.760]  Gotcha.
[3:32:11.760 --> 3:32:15.360]  For those of you wondering more about the, the protest tonight, the man who protested
[3:32:15.360 --> 3:32:18.160]  the play is named Javi Val of the Proud Boys.
[3:32:18.160 --> 3:32:22.680]  So apparently it was, so Gavin has this fraternal organization called the Proud Boys.
[3:32:22.680 --> 3:32:27.480]  So apparently the protestor tonight in New York was a part of the Proud Boys and we
[3:32:27.480 --> 3:32:28.480]  all saw the video.
[3:32:28.480 --> 3:32:29.480]  He didn't get violent.
[3:32:29.480 --> 3:32:30.480]  He didn't punch anybody.
[3:32:30.480 --> 3:32:35.200]  He went up and, you know, exercises free speech rights, which, you know, again, we've
[3:32:35.200 --> 3:32:40.040]  had all these events happening and events have been disrupted by the left for years
[3:32:40.040 --> 3:32:43.740]  and we've had violence on the left and nobody cares and suddenly my God, they care.
[3:32:43.740 --> 3:32:46.680]  By the way, for those of you who are learning about me for the first time, you can go to
[3:32:46.680 --> 3:32:51.440]  twitter.com forward slash, look at the censorship of Twitter, scroll down, you see it may contain
[3:32:51.440 --> 3:32:52.440]  sensitive material.
[3:32:52.440 --> 3:32:53.440]  Yeah.
[3:32:53.440 --> 3:32:54.440]  Okay.
[3:32:54.440 --> 3:32:55.440]  Yeah.
[3:32:55.440 --> 3:32:56.440]  They're hiding the actual photo.
[3:32:56.440 --> 3:32:57.440]  Wow.
[3:32:57.440 --> 3:32:58.440]  No, no, I hadn't seen that.
[3:32:58.440 --> 3:32:59.440]  Yeah.
[3:32:59.440 --> 3:33:00.440]  Scroll, if you can scroll down on your, your profile.
[3:33:00.440 --> 3:33:01.440]  I'm at twitter.com forward slash Cernovich.
[3:33:01.440 --> 3:33:02.440]  Amazing.
[3:33:02.440 --> 3:33:03.440]  Yeah.
[3:33:03.440 --> 3:33:04.440]  Look, you have to click to view it.
[3:33:04.440 --> 3:33:05.440]  See a protest.
[3:33:05.440 --> 3:33:06.440]  Right.
[3:33:06.440 --> 3:33:07.440]  So that's Laura Loomer's Twitter.
[3:33:07.440 --> 3:33:08.440]  Yeah.
[3:33:08.440 --> 3:33:09.440]  That's that.
[3:33:09.440 --> 3:33:10.440]  Yeah.
[3:33:10.440 --> 3:33:11.440]  So allegedly that's a sensitive image.
[3:33:11.440 --> 3:33:12.440]  Amazing.
[3:33:12.440 --> 3:33:13.440]  You're right.
[3:33:13.440 --> 3:33:14.440]  So this is again, in real time, that there's nothing sensitive about that image other
[3:33:14.440 --> 3:33:20.440]  than a narrative, say I'm at twitter.com forward slash Cernovich, you can always find me there
[3:33:20.440 --> 3:33:21.440]  going on.

[3:33:22.440 --> 3:33:23.440]  We've got another 15 minutes going on.
[3:33:23.440 --> 3:33:24.440]  So what's on your mind?
[3:33:24.440 --> 3:33:29.120]  So I think that, you know, the interview tonight, what they're going for, you know, they end
[3:33:29.120 --> 3:33:32.560]  the interview with, you know, this, this hate maugering narrative.
[3:33:32.560 --> 3:33:38.120]  And we see even during the commercials, we see an advertisement for stopping online hate.
[3:33:38.120 --> 3:33:39.800]  And that's where the next move is going to be.
[3:33:39.800 --> 3:33:41.440]  They're going to keep pushing this fake news.
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:44.640]  First they tried fake news and it seems that that is kind of trialed off, but I guarantee
[3:33:44.640 --> 3:33:45.960]  they'll come back to that.
[3:33:45.960 --> 3:33:47.920]  Now it's all around hate speech.
[3:33:47.920 --> 3:33:50.440]  And the thing with hate speech is, how do you define that?
[3:33:50.440 --> 3:33:52.300]  Who defines what hate speech is?
[3:33:52.300 --> 3:33:55.920]  If you say something mean to me, is that technically hate speech because I was offended
[3:33:55.920 --> 3:33:56.920]  by it?
[3:33:56.920 --> 3:33:59.800]  Well, that's how the majority of people on the internet are defining it.
[3:33:59.800 --> 3:34:03.760]  And what's happening is, you know, you have Twitter now using things like Watson AI to
[3:34:03.760 --> 3:34:09.400]  automatically flag and remove and suspend users for saying certain words, certain phrases.
[3:34:09.400 --> 3:34:13.040]  It's not even, you know, it's not even somebody reporting it to Twitter and having a human
[3:34:13.040 --> 3:34:16.440]  on Twitter and review that and say, okay, this crossed the line.
[3:34:16.440 --> 3:34:21.080]  It's actually using artificial intelligence now to make a decision on who should be silenced
[3:34:21.080 --> 3:34:22.360]  and who should not.
[3:34:22.360 --> 3:34:23.640]  And that's what's scary.
[3:34:23.640 --> 3:34:27.160]  That's something that's scary to me is, you know, we're no platforming people.
[3:34:27.160 --> 3:34:31.560]  We're silencing people just because they have a different opinion or because they think differently
[3:34:31.560 --> 3:34:35.400]  or because they're critical of certain things or because they made a joke.
[3:34:35.400 --> 3:34:36.920]  That is a world that I don't want to live in.
[3:34:36.920 --> 3:34:39.560]  And that's not the internet that, you know, you and I grew up on.
[3:34:39.560 --> 3:34:43.360]  We grew up on an internet that was free and open and, you know, basically it was the wild
[3:34:43.360 --> 3:34:44.360]  west.
[3:34:44.360 --> 3:34:45.360]  Anything goes.
[3:34:45.360 --> 3:34:48.600]  And now that, you know, they're starting to lose control and, you know, they're not going
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:51.960]  to allow something like 2016 to happen ever again.
[3:34:51.960 --> 3:34:52.960]  It's not going to happen.
[3:34:52.960 --> 3:34:56.080]  So you're going to see, you know, Silicon Valley start to double down and you're going
[3:34:56.080 --> 3:35:00.840]  to see the fragmentation of the social networking ecosystem and alternatives like Gab and others.
[3:35:00.840 --> 3:35:04.840]  You know, there's mines, there's infocalactic, there's kek.gg.
[3:35:04.840 --> 3:35:08.400]  There's so many different alternatives that are rising up in the technology space to answer
[3:35:08.400 --> 3:35:13.160]  for the censorship and the suppression that's going on, you know, focused specifically on
[3:35:13.160 --> 3:35:15.320]  people, folks on the right and Trump supporters.
[3:35:15.320 --> 3:35:17.680]  And this is happening around the world, by the way.
[3:35:17.680 --> 3:35:21.400]  We had Amy Mech's account up before on Twitter, one of her tweets.
[3:35:21.400 --> 3:35:26.760]  She is actually completely, her entire account is censored completely in Germany and France.
[3:35:26.760 --> 3:35:30.800]  If you were in Germany and France, you cannot actually view any of her Twitter content.
[3:35:30.800 --> 3:35:35.920]  So we actually recently had a massive surge in folks from Germany coming into Gab because
[3:35:35.920 --> 3:35:38.240]  of this censorship that's starting to happen over there.
[3:35:38.240 --> 3:35:39.240]  Yeah.
[3:35:39.240 --> 3:35:44.000]  Again, it's worldwide is happening in, well, this is what I find interesting about the
[3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:48.400]  media and media narratives is they keep saying that we need to be afraid of Russia and Putin's
[3:35:48.400 --> 3:35:49.920]  this bad guy.
[3:35:49.920 --> 3:35:52.520]  But in Turkey, journalists are actually being jailed.
[3:35:52.520 --> 3:35:57.160]  The internet is completely censored and Twitter, you can confirm this for me, you know, so
[3:35:57.160 --> 3:35:58.560]  they know that I'm telling the truth.
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:02.840]  Twitter actually handed over data to the Turkish government, which allowed them to imprison
[3:36:02.840 --> 3:36:03.840]  journalists and activists.
[3:36:03.840 --> 3:36:04.840]  Right.
[3:36:04.840 --> 3:36:05.840]  Yeah.
[3:36:05.840 --> 3:36:06.840]  Twitter actually is very open about this.
[3:36:06.840 --> 3:36:07.840]  They're transparent.
[3:36:07.840 --> 3:36:11.160]  They publish a report on this every year annually about, you know, the government request, data
[3:36:11.160 --> 3:36:12.160]  request that they receive.
[3:36:12.160 --> 3:36:14.160]  And a lot of that's actually a great thing.
[3:36:14.160 --> 3:36:15.480]  That's a good thing that they're doing this.
[3:36:15.480 --> 3:36:19.480]  But, you know, we're seeing, you know, governments from around the world start to crack down
[3:36:19.480 --> 3:36:22.840]  and they're trying to force the social media companies, you know, you look at Germany where
[3:36:22.840 --> 3:36:26.480]  they have, what is it, a 50 million dollar or 50 million euro fine.
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:30.560]  If you don't remove hate speech within 24 hours, like, you know how many, there's billions
[3:36:30.560 --> 3:36:35.200]  of posts every single day at Facebook just hired 3,000 more people.
[3:36:35.200 --> 3:36:39.200]  And that's not even enough people that they don't have enough manpower to possibly and
[3:36:39.200 --> 3:36:44.080]  conceivably monitor what is quote unquote hate speech and remove it within 24 hours.
[3:36:44.080 --> 3:36:45.080]  There's just no way.
[3:36:45.080 --> 3:36:51.480]  But what I find more interesting though is that Twitter is allowing dictators to imprison
[3:36:51.480 --> 3:36:52.800]  activists and journalists.
[3:36:52.800 --> 3:36:53.800]  Okay.
[3:36:53.800 --> 3:36:56.240]  This is what we live in this era of false equivalency.
[3:36:56.240 --> 3:37:01.040]  You know, I'll own that I have at times said things that were mean to people and I've done
[3:37:01.040 --> 3:37:02.040]  fat shaming.
[3:37:02.040 --> 3:37:03.040]  That's not cool.
[3:37:03.040 --> 3:37:04.040]  Yeah.
[3:37:04.040 --> 3:37:06.280]  I've said things that I'm like, you know, that that isn't me at my best.
[3:37:06.280 --> 3:37:07.880]  You know, I shouldn't have said that.
[3:37:07.880 --> 3:37:08.880]  That's not me at my best.
[3:37:08.880 --> 3:37:13.600]  End of the day, though, that's me on Twitter calling somebody fat and gross.
[3:37:13.600 --> 3:37:18.680]  Twitter is handing over data to tyrannical governments and people are dying and being
[3:37:18.680 --> 3:37:21.520]  raped in prison, but somehow we're the bad guys.
[3:37:21.520 --> 3:37:22.520]  Right.
[3:37:22.520 --> 3:37:25.600]  I mean, you've seen Silicon Valley capitulate to governments.
[3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:29.960]  You're seeing, you know, organizations like Share Blue from David Brock.
[3:37:29.960 --> 3:37:34.640]  How does David Brock and Share Blue have that much influence over Mark Zuckerberg, over
[3:37:34.640 --> 3:37:38.760]  Google, you know, some of them, the biggest corporations, the most wealthy corporations
[3:37:38.760 --> 3:37:39.760]  in the world.
[3:37:39.760 --> 3:37:44.600]  How does one outside influencer from the Democratic Party have that much influence over these
[3:37:44.600 --> 3:37:46.320]  multi-billion dollar corporations?
[3:37:46.320 --> 3:37:47.320]  That's what I want to know.
[3:37:47.320 --> 3:37:48.320]  Yeah.
[3:37:48.320 --> 3:37:50.960]  And then meanwhile, well, I mean, of course, I'll tell you how, I mean, we all know that
[3:37:50.960 --> 3:37:52.640]  venture capital is controlled, right?
[3:37:52.640 --> 3:37:56.560]  We all know that if you're, if you're like me, they'll just keep you out of deals.
[3:37:56.560 --> 3:38:00.280]  I've actually had venture capital deals fall through where I was going to be an angel
[3:38:00.280 --> 3:38:04.120]  investor in companies and then SJWs within tech were like, no, no, no, you can't take
[3:38:04.120 --> 3:38:05.120]  that money.
[3:38:05.120 --> 3:38:06.960]  Because if your name's on the cap table, you're done.
[3:38:06.960 --> 3:38:07.960]  They monopolize it.
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:13.840]  So that's the thing, the free market or whatever is, there's actually an oligopoly in Silicon
[3:38:13.840 --> 3:38:18.160]  Valley and Ted Cruz even tweeted out earlier today, I sent the tweet out earlier.
[3:38:18.160 --> 3:38:22.880]  He noticed that Twitter has become a monopoly and Twitter was like a utility.
[3:38:22.880 --> 3:38:26.480]  So if these people, I'm not going to say who I've talked to, but I have talked to US
[3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:30.320]  senators about it, maybe Cruz, maybe not, people are just going to have to guess.
[3:38:30.320 --> 3:38:33.720]  But I have talked to US senators about these issues, the anti-trust issue.
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:37.520]  And I explained to oligopolies that are occurring in venture capital.
[3:38:37.520 --> 3:38:40.120]  So these people think they're going to need a way with it, but they have no idea what
[3:38:40.120 --> 3:38:41.120]  I'm cooking behind the scenes.
[3:38:41.120 --> 3:38:43.740]  Well, listen, I was in Silicon Valley, you know, I lived there.
[3:38:43.740 --> 3:38:47.440]  I was a part of the inner circle of the inner circle at Y Combinator.
[3:38:47.440 --> 3:38:49.080]  And I saw it from the inside out.
[3:38:49.080 --> 3:38:50.880]  It is exactly what you're describing.
[3:38:50.880 --> 3:38:55.160]  It is the same group of about a thousand people that all invest in each other's companies,
[3:38:55.160 --> 3:38:57.920]  buy each other's companies and then pat each other on the back like they did something
[3:38:57.920 --> 3:38:58.920]  phenomenal.
[3:38:58.920 --> 3:39:02.560]  And if you're not in that core inner circle, you're not going to go anywhere, period.
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:03.560]  They're going to crush you.
[3:39:03.560 --> 3:39:05.360]  Well, I'm glad you said, actually, this is a great point.
[3:39:05.360 --> 3:39:10.320]  So there's a media myth that these venture capitalists or these geniuses of capital,
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:11.680]  no, they're oligopolists.
[3:39:11.680 --> 3:39:16.680]  So what happens is they'll all put 25 grand into a thousand different companies and it's
[3:39:16.680 --> 3:39:20.200]  the same thousand people shuffling that 25,000 round.
[3:39:20.200 --> 3:39:23.800]  Then what they do is these companies have big IPOs like Snapchat, even though Snapchat's
[3:39:23.800 --> 3:39:29.040]  a total scam and they tank so they get all this money from the general public and essentially
[3:39:29.040 --> 3:39:30.040]  scam the public.
[3:39:30.040 --> 3:39:31.040]  That's how they go.
[3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:33.240]  Oh my God, you know, this, I'm a Chris soccer.
[3:39:33.240 --> 3:39:34.240]  I'm Chris soccer.
[3:39:34.240 --> 3:39:35.240]  I'm such a genius investor.
[3:39:35.240 --> 3:39:37.720]  No, they're only investing 25,000 at a time.
[3:39:37.720 --> 3:39:41.160]  I could go right now and become a hundred million in Silicon Valley.
[3:39:41.160 --> 3:39:43.680]  I could have been that because I was offered investments.
[3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:46.760]  Also because of the oligopolist forces I was kept out.
[3:39:46.760 --> 3:39:51.760]  So people think, oh my God, these people are geniuses, Paul Graham's not a genius.
[3:39:51.760 --> 3:39:54.520]  They're giving $25,000 in initial speed rounds.
[3:39:54.520 --> 3:39:55.520]  I don't even know.
[3:39:55.520 --> 3:39:56.520]  That was 15 grand.
[3:39:56.520 --> 3:39:57.520]  Yeah.
[3:39:57.520 --> 3:40:01.280]  They got 8% equity in these companies for $15,000 and three months of their time.
[3:40:01.280 --> 3:40:02.280]  Yeah.
[3:40:02.280 --> 3:40:03.280]  And why is the media not covering that?
[3:40:03.280 --> 3:40:06.720]  Why is Megan Kelly not, you know, covering that, that how these venture capitalists are
[3:40:06.720 --> 3:40:07.720]  actually an oligopoly.
[3:40:07.720 --> 3:40:09.160]  It isn't a free market.
[3:40:09.160 --> 3:40:12.720]  They're illegally just, and they also don't cover the tech companies and how they were
[3:40:12.720 --> 3:40:13.720]  sued.
[3:40:13.720 --> 3:40:17.240]  I mean, we can talk about tech because the fake news media won't cover this.
[3:40:17.240 --> 3:40:22.280]  The tech companies illegally violated antitrust law to keep down wages of workers.
[3:40:22.280 --> 3:40:26.880]  This was Apple, Google, all the Facebook, I think Facebook actually wouldn't, but there
[3:40:26.880 --> 3:40:27.880]  was all of them.
[3:40:27.880 --> 3:40:31.040]  They should have gone to prison for antitrust violations, for price fixing.
[3:40:31.040 --> 3:40:34.520]  Instead, they paid a minor fine by Obama.
[3:40:34.520 --> 3:40:38.560]  So the media narrative is all these tech people hate Trump, but wait a minute, these people
[3:40:38.560 --> 3:40:39.560]  are criminals.
[3:40:39.560 --> 3:40:40.560]  Right.
[3:40:40.560 --> 3:40:41.560]  And they were in the pocket of Obama, by the way.
[3:40:41.560 --> 3:40:42.560]  You know, for eight years.
[3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:44.680]  Well, and that's why Obama gave them that sweetheart deal.
[3:40:44.680 --> 3:40:45.680]  Right.
[3:40:45.680 --> 3:40:46.680]  So there was actually a memo.
[3:40:46.680 --> 3:40:49.600]  So for those of you who haven't heard this story, and actually many of you, most of you
[3:40:49.600 --> 3:40:50.600]  probably haven't.
[3:40:50.600 --> 3:40:53.640]  I should do a whole documentary on this, which is that we can do an hour on this.
[3:40:53.640 --> 3:40:54.640]  Yeah.
[3:40:54.640 --> 3:40:59.200]  They said Apple Steve Jobs, they had an email from Steve Jobs, and they said, you're not
[3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:00.680]  allowed to hire people who work for me.
[3:41:00.680 --> 3:41:02.640]  I won't hire people from work for you.
[3:41:02.640 --> 3:41:06.800]  This is a criminal violation of the federal antitrust laws criminal.
[3:41:06.800 --> 3:41:08.840]  There was a civil action brought.
[3:41:08.840 --> 3:41:09.840]  That was it.
[3:41:09.840 --> 3:41:10.840]  They all settled it for peanuts.
[3:41:10.840 --> 3:41:12.680]  Even though they depressed wages.
[3:41:12.680 --> 3:41:13.680]  Right.
[3:41:13.680 --> 3:41:15.480]  Meanwhile, they're saying we can't hire enough people.
[3:41:15.480 --> 3:41:16.800]  We can't hire enough people.
[3:41:16.800 --> 3:41:18.760]  Well, wait a minute, you're suppressing wages.
[3:41:18.760 --> 3:41:23.240]  So how can you suppress weight so that we need it more HP-1 visas, can't hire enough
[3:41:23.240 --> 3:41:24.240]  people.
[3:41:24.240 --> 3:41:25.240]  We can't get.
[3:41:25.240 --> 3:41:27.720]  Well, wait a minute, you're illegally and criminally suppressing wages.
[3:41:27.720 --> 3:41:28.720]  Why don't you raise the wages?
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:30.360]  Oh, no, because we're antitrust violations.
[3:41:30.360 --> 3:41:31.360]  So we need more.
[3:41:31.360 --> 3:41:32.360]  We need more of this.
[3:41:32.360 --> 3:41:33.360]  We need more of that.
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:34.760]  These people are fucking criminals, man.
[3:41:34.760 --> 3:41:35.760]  They are.
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:37.840]  And it's again, it's one big circle jerk.
[3:41:37.840 --> 3:41:41.800]  It's the same thousand people investing in their own companies, investing in their own
[3:41:41.800 --> 3:41:45.320]  small network, buying each other's companies and then patting each other on the back and
[3:41:45.320 --> 3:41:46.720]  saying, look at how great we are.
[3:41:46.720 --> 3:41:47.720]  We're fantastic.
[3:41:47.720 --> 3:41:48.720]  We're so brilliant.
[3:41:48.720 --> 3:41:50.040]  We're so morally superior.
[3:41:50.040 --> 3:41:51.560]  We know the way.
[3:41:51.560 --> 3:41:56.120]  That's their biggest thing is that they think that the general public is stupid and that
[3:41:56.120 --> 3:42:00.280]  they, because they went to some Ivy League school or because they created a tech company
[3:42:00.280 --> 3:42:01.560]  and sold it, you know, for $10.
[3:42:01.560 --> 3:42:04.720]  Yeah, which damn almond do other than ride Paul Graham's coattails?
[3:42:04.720 --> 3:42:06.520]  That's about a heap of paint.
[3:42:06.520 --> 3:42:10.040]  He went into white Combinator, he's some, you know, profit, Sam Altman, some kind of
[3:42:10.040 --> 3:42:11.040]  profit.
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:12.880]  He sold his company in a fire suit, by the way.
[3:42:12.880 --> 3:42:13.880]  Yeah.
[3:42:13.880 --> 3:42:15.800]  And then he went in and then he wrote Paul Graham's coattails.
[3:42:15.800 --> 3:42:16.800]  Right.
[3:42:16.800 --> 3:42:18.920]  He got to get white Combinator on a silver platter.
[3:42:18.920 --> 3:42:21.200]  Exactly by Paul Graham and who knows why that was.
[3:42:21.200 --> 3:42:24.040]  And then suddenly people like, oh, wow, you know, Sam Altman, he's his version of a tech
[3:42:24.040 --> 3:42:25.040]  guy.
[3:42:25.040 --> 3:42:26.040]  He didn't do anything.
[3:42:26.040 --> 3:42:27.040]  He wrote somebody else's coattails.
[3:42:27.040 --> 3:42:28.040]  Exactly.
[3:42:28.040 --> 3:42:29.040]  But that's what the fake news media will say.
[3:42:29.040 --> 3:42:33.840]  Meanwhile, people are actually scrappy and meanwhile people are scrappy and actually
[3:42:33.840 --> 3:42:37.960]  created value and created something out of nothing like Alex Jones or you or me.
[3:42:37.960 --> 3:42:38.960]  Yep.
[3:42:38.960 --> 3:42:40.680]  They're like, oh, they actually hold you out in shame.
[3:42:40.680 --> 3:42:43.520]  They're like, wow, it's Jones is self-funded and he's so right.
[3:42:43.520 --> 3:42:44.520]  He's okay.
[3:42:44.520 --> 3:42:49.160]  The fake media has commercials for poisonous pharmaceuticals and Tylenol and everything
[3:42:49.160 --> 3:42:50.400]  else.
[3:42:50.400 --> 3:42:53.720]  But somehow we can't sell this kind of stuff.
[3:42:53.720 --> 3:42:54.720]  It's crazy.
[3:42:54.720 --> 3:42:55.720]  I mean, this is the American dream.
[3:42:55.720 --> 3:42:59.120]  What all three of us are doing, you know, where we're picking up by our bootstraps,
[3:42:59.120 --> 3:43:03.800]  we're dependent completely on our viewers, our subscribers, our users in our case.
[3:43:03.800 --> 3:43:06.840]  We're not dependent on the multi-million-dollar venture capitals.
[3:43:06.840 --> 3:43:08.520]  We're not dependent on the advertisers.
[3:43:08.520 --> 3:43:11.240]  We're dependent solely on the people and we answer only to those people.
[3:43:11.240 --> 3:43:13.440]  And that's why they don't like us because they don't have the control.
[3:43:13.440 --> 3:43:16.880]  They don't have the advertisers to go after, which would be, you know, our money generator.
[3:43:16.880 --> 3:43:19.720]  They don't have the venture capitalists to go after to not fund us because we're funded
[3:43:19.720 --> 3:43:20.720]  by the people.
[3:43:20.720 --> 3:43:21.960]  So they can't attack the people.
[3:43:21.960 --> 3:43:25.560]  They can only attack us and, you know, call us racists and the Twitter for racist as they've
[3:43:25.560 --> 3:43:29.000]  called us and, you know, all the numerous things that they've said to you as well.
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:30.000]  Amazing.
[3:43:30.000 --> 3:43:31.000]  Thanks for joining us.
[3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:36.240]  I'm Mike Sernovich, co-founder of gab.ai, which is a free speech alternative to Twitter.
[3:43:36.240 --> 3:43:41.640]  Right now you're watching me, Mike Sernovich, twitter.com forward slash c-e-r-n-o-v-i-c-h.
[3:43:41.640 --> 3:43:43.560]  You can also find Gorilla Minds on Amazon.
[3:43:43.560 --> 3:43:49.000]  I might be back in studio tomorrow with Alex because we need to take a victory lap.
[3:43:49.000 --> 3:43:54.200]  We need to, you know, stay up all night, watch Twitter, celebrate how we defeated Megan Kelly,
[3:43:54.200 --> 3:43:56.120]  how Alice defeated her.
[3:43:56.120 --> 3:44:00.000]  And even the media people are admitting that Megan Kelly, she made a mistake.
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:01.640]  The globalist lost.
[3:44:01.640 --> 3:44:02.640]  Cheers to America.
[3:44:02.640 --> 3:44:03.880]  Thank you for funding the info.
[3:44:03.880 --> 3:44:04.880]  Thanks.
[3:44:04.880 --> 3:44:07.120]  We love you all.
[3:44:07.120 --> 3:44:13.040]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones, who claims that
[3:44:13.040 --> 3:44:17.800]  9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[3:44:17.800 --> 3:44:22.720]  And others who are kind of at the very fringe of the conspiracy movement like Alex Jones
[3:44:22.720 --> 3:44:28.340]  are being kind of incorporated into the campaign in ways it's a, or even the recent choices
[3:44:28.340 --> 3:44:29.840]  of campaign management.
[3:44:29.840 --> 3:44:33.960]  The right-wing smear machine has gotten Alex Jones-ified this election cycle as we've
[3:44:33.960 --> 3:44:34.960]  been chronicling here.
[3:44:34.960 --> 3:44:40.440]  Jones is the conspiracy theorist and creator of the fringe website Infowars.
[3:44:40.440 --> 3:44:44.520]  Do you also know that Hillary Clinton uses a wheelchair?
[3:44:44.520 --> 3:44:48.760]  Her personal vehicle has had to be outfitted with a wheelchair lift because she is not a
[3:44:48.760 --> 3:44:51.400]  person who can actually walk.
[3:44:51.400 --> 3:44:54.520]  She secretly uses a wheelchair all those times you think you've seen her walking.
[3:44:54.520 --> 3:44:55.520]  She hasn't been walking.
[3:44:55.520 --> 3:44:57.000]  Did you know that?
[3:44:57.000 --> 3:45:00.040]  Hillary Clinton has been on the campaign trail for 18 months.
[3:45:00.040 --> 3:45:03.160]  Her energy staggers me.
[3:45:03.160 --> 3:45:09.360]  I have a hard time keeping up with her.
[3:45:09.360 --> 3:45:14.760]  The historical first in electing the first conspiracy freak president, he's not pivoting
[3:45:14.760 --> 3:45:19.560]  for presidential, he's pivoting to Alex Jones, he's pivoting to crazy.
[3:45:19.560 --> 3:45:25.040]  Was Hillary wearing an earpiece during last night's presidential forum?
[3:45:25.040 --> 3:45:34.080]  What is the pilot, the captain of America's conspiracy theory mother ship, Alex Jones?
[3:45:34.080 --> 3:45:36.520]  You just had to keep digging, didn't you, Alex?
[3:45:36.520 --> 3:45:41.600]  The plan was so simple, all Hillary had to do was open a jar of pickles and the White
[3:45:41.600 --> 3:45:42.800]  House would be all ours.
[3:45:42.800 --> 3:45:45.320]  You're going to be part of the conspiracy now, you realize that, right?
[3:45:45.320 --> 3:45:46.840]  I'm going to try and do my best.
[3:45:46.840 --> 3:45:48.520]  Alex Jones is going to be all over you.
[3:45:48.520 --> 3:45:49.520]  Let's see what happens.
[3:45:49.520 --> 3:45:50.520]  Okay, here we go.
[3:45:50.520 --> 3:45:51.520]  Here it is.
[3:45:51.520 --> 3:45:58.400]  Whoop, blitz, sir, oh no, oh, there wasn't.
[3:45:58.400 --> 3:46:02.960]  They're all in on this, on this total conspiracy theory that literally came from info wars.
[3:46:02.960 --> 3:46:07.840]  First of all, Hayes, I'll get you for this segment, it may take years and cost thousands
[3:46:07.840 --> 3:46:10.040]  of lives, but I'll get you for this.
[3:46:10.040 --> 3:46:19.280]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things
[3:46:19.280 --> 3:46:21.280]  like that.
[3:46:21.280 --> 3:46:26.560]  The New World Order sends its regards.
[3:46:26.560 --> 3:46:33.120]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, the Alex Jones show because there is a war
[3:46:33.120 --> 3:46:35.120]  on for your mind.
[3:46:35.120 --> 3:46:41.720]  And it matters because it's not just the kook fringe, it's not just the sort of remunerative
[3:46:41.720 --> 3:46:46.200]  conspiracy theory world of that part of the conservative media machine.
[3:46:46.200 --> 3:46:50.960]  It's not even just wacky people who have made their way into Republican politics at a surprising
[3:46:50.960 --> 3:46:51.960]  high.
[3:46:51.960 --> 3:47:21.920]  It's the top of the Republican ticket.
