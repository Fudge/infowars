[00:00.000 --> 00:13.000]  The Alex Jones show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists are in full retreat there in total panic mode, but
[00:18.800 --> 00:24.640]  you better believe they can still throw a devastating right hook at us while we're savoring
[00:24.640 --> 00:25.640]  our victories.
[00:25.640 --> 00:33.120]  We're ready for the Empire to strike back, ladies and gentlemen, wow, we're gonna play
[00:33.120 --> 00:37.200]  this John Bowne report, we're gonna come back after the break and then lay it all out.
[00:37.200 --> 00:41.760]  We are witnessing the collapse of the New World Order, the collapse of the criminal
[00:41.760 --> 00:44.360]  ruling class.
[00:44.360 --> 00:47.520]  They are absolutely panicking.
[00:47.520 --> 00:48.520]  Stay with us.
[00:48.520 --> 00:53.320]  Former President Obama continues to do the dirty work of George Soros and the United
[00:53.320 --> 00:59.640]  Nations just two miles away from the White House, continuing to take his community organizer
[00:59.640 --> 01:03.120]  presidency into the hearts and minds of America.
[01:03.120 --> 01:10.080]  The Organized for Action site reads, with more than 250 local chapters around the country,
[01:10.080 --> 01:15.600]  OFA volunteers are building this organization from the ground up, community by community,
[01:15.600 --> 01:19.760]  one conversation at a time, whether that's on our front porch or on Facebook.
[01:19.760 --> 01:24.800]  We are committed to finding and training the next generation of great progressive organizers,
[01:24.800 --> 01:28.840]  because at the end of the day, we aren't the first to fight for progressive change,
[01:28.840 --> 01:30.720]  and we won't be the last.
[01:30.720 --> 01:35.840]  The site reads, meanwhile, the trail leading to the genesis of the fictional narrative of
[01:35.840 --> 01:41.680]  the Trump-Russia collusion plaguing the agenda of the Trump administration has finally turned
[01:41.680 --> 01:44.640]  up in Obama and Hillary Clinton's backyards.
[01:44.640 --> 01:49.640]  The New York Post reports, the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month threatened to
[01:49.640 --> 01:56.160]  subpoena the firm, Fusion GPS, after it refused to answer questions and provide records to
[01:56.160 --> 02:02.120]  the panel identifying who financed the error-ridden dossier, which was circulated during the election
[02:02.120 --> 02:06.680]  and has sparked much of the Russia scandal now engulfing the White House.
[02:06.680 --> 02:13.000]  Fusion GPS was on the payroll of an unidentified Democratic ally of Clinton when it hired a
[02:13.000 --> 02:16.800]  long-retired British spy to dig up dirt on Trump.
[02:16.800 --> 02:23.840]  In 2012, Democrats hired Fusion GPS to uncover dirt on GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney.
[02:23.840 --> 02:28.720]  More federal records show a key co-founder and partner in the firm was a Hillary Clinton
[02:28.720 --> 02:32.280]  donor and supporter of her presidential campaign.
[02:32.280 --> 02:38.800]  In September 2016, while Fusion GPS was quietly shopping the dirty dossier on Trump around
[02:38.800 --> 02:44.600]  Washington, its co-founder and partner Peter R. Fritch contributed at least $1,000 to the
[02:44.600 --> 02:50.280]  Hillary Victory Fund and the Hillary for America campaign, FEC data shows.
[02:50.280 --> 02:53.920]  His wife also donated money to Hillary's campaign.
[02:53.920 --> 02:59.120]  The Clinton campaign at the time was using all kinds of euphemisms, security review,
[02:59.120 --> 03:01.960]  matters, things like that for what was going on.
[03:01.960 --> 03:04.720]  We were getting to a place where the attorney general and I were both going to have to testify
[03:04.720 --> 03:08.960]  and talk publicly about it and I want to know was she going to authorize us to confirm
[03:08.960 --> 03:14.200]  we had an investigation and she said yes, but don't call it that, call it a matter and
[03:14.200 --> 03:21.000]  I said why would I do that and she said just call it a matter and again you look back in
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.960]  hindsight you think should I have resisted harder I just said all right isn't worth,
[03:24.960 --> 03:29.600]  this isn't a hill worth dying on and so I just said okay the press is going to completely
[03:29.600 --> 03:32.600]  ignore it.
[03:32.600 --> 03:36.560]  What the winocrats were afraid of is just around the corner.
[03:36.560 --> 03:41.120]  The State Department just opened a formal inquiry into Hillary Clinton's mishandling
[03:41.120 --> 03:46.400]  of classified information and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch will face questions
[03:46.400 --> 03:51.080]  surrounding her manipulation of the FBI probe into Hillary's emails.
[03:51.080 --> 03:55.920]  Senators on the judiciary committee want to know if Lynch assured former DNC chair
[03:55.920 --> 04:02.400]  Wasserman Schultz that the FBI probe would go away while Schultz led a sinister backstabbing
[04:02.400 --> 04:05.000]  operation against Bernie Sanders.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.440]  Nothing lasts forever winocrats, especially when that House of Cards is all built on lies.
[04:11.440 --> 04:16.600]  There are a few things that break faith with America and the American people and undermining
[04:16.600 --> 04:20.800]  their trust in their government more than witnessing the highest law enforcement officer
[04:20.800 --> 04:26.280]  in the land blatantly ignoring their crystal clear meaning and equal protection and equal
[04:26.280 --> 04:29.640]  enforcement of the laws as they are written.
[04:29.640 --> 04:36.080]  Madam Attorney General I think such an abrogation of your official duties and responsibility
[04:36.080 --> 04:42.360]  not just a matter of what will be written writ large in the annals of your own legacy
[04:42.360 --> 04:47.360]  is something rather that goes to the very heart of the rule of law in a republic that
[04:47.360 --> 04:52.280]  so many lying out in Arlington National Cemetery have died to keep.
[04:52.280 --> 04:59.640]  John Bown for info wars dot com.
[04:59.640 --> 05:02.920]  The struggle in the DNC fraud lawsuit continues.
[05:02.920 --> 05:07.680]  You've had the current counsel for the plaintiffs request that the judge provide witness protection.
[05:07.680 --> 05:12.600]  That notion was rejected despite three mysterious deaths of potential witnesses in the case
[05:12.600 --> 05:16.240]  Seth Rich, Sean Lucas and Barrington Wisonette Jr.
[05:16.240 --> 05:19.920]  There are also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have this case dropped
[05:19.920 --> 05:21.440]  entirely.
[05:21.440 --> 05:25.680]  Despite the obvious glaring issues that the DNC has had over the course of the last two
[05:25.680 --> 05:29.560]  years, while the lawsuit represents Bernie Sanders supporters who feel they have been
[05:29.560 --> 05:34.320]  wronged by the DNC, Bernie Sanders has fallen silent on the issue.
[05:34.320 --> 05:37.920]  Donald Trump tweeted out this weekend Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democrat Party in
[05:37.920 --> 05:39.880]  order to be crazy Bernie Sanders.
[05:39.880 --> 05:41.240]  Is she allowed to collude?
[05:41.240 --> 05:42.240]  Unfair to Bernie.
[05:42.240 --> 05:46.200]  So now Donald Trump has done more to raise awareness for the DNC fraud lawsuit than Bernie
[05:46.200 --> 05:50.080]  Sanders has who actually is the one that had the election stolen from him.
[05:50.080 --> 05:52.440]  Why is Bernie Sanders silent on the issue?
[05:52.440 --> 05:56.840]  Maybe I guess he's busy with being investigated by the FBI for bank fraud.
[05:56.840 --> 06:00.880]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[06:00.880 --> 06:04.640]  Thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry.
[06:04.640 --> 06:09.640]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to
[06:09.640 --> 06:12.440]  organize and prepare a defense.
[06:12.440 --> 06:18.600]  Sixty years ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums
[06:18.600 --> 06:21.120]  of their own, air raid sirens.
[06:21.120 --> 06:25.440]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[06:25.440 --> 06:30.080]  Pathanogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our
[06:30.080 --> 06:35.120]  vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[06:35.120 --> 06:38.720]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[06:38.720 --> 06:46.560]  Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation
[06:46.560 --> 06:50.240]  to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[06:50.240 --> 06:52.760]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today.

[08:20.320 --> 08:31.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, President Trump has taken the gloves off with MSM in a big way.
[08:31.880 --> 08:37.360]  We're about to break down the collapse, the final days of MSM.
[08:37.360 --> 08:43.560]  You can mark this as the time on your calendar when they started a revolution, pushing violence.
[08:43.560 --> 08:47.080]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[08:47.080 --> 08:50.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am Alex Jones, your host.
[08:50.040 --> 08:54.440]  We are going to be live here for the next four hours.
[08:54.440 --> 08:57.360]  What an amazing time to be alive.
[08:57.360 --> 08:59.960]  It is simply incredible.
[08:59.960 --> 09:04.440]  I am almost speechless at this point.
[09:04.440 --> 09:13.080]  The amount of incredible news that is just breaking by the second.
[09:13.080 --> 09:23.520]  And to see the discredited MSM go from outlandish, incredible lies and just complete walls of
[09:23.520 --> 09:35.440]  fraud, oceans of deception, to now only intensifying that, to shrill foaming at the mouth, temper tantrums.
[09:35.440 --> 09:40.360]  This is a corrupt multinational elite that has come in and exploited our country, exploited
[09:40.360 --> 09:47.480]  other nations, consolidated power, pushed for global tyranny to submit their hold.
[09:47.480 --> 09:51.160]  And now humanity is awake to it.
[09:51.160 --> 09:55.480]  And so now they're fighting for their lives.
[09:55.480 --> 09:59.880]  And to maintain control, they've only intensified the amount of fake news that they've been
[09:59.880 --> 10:00.880]  putting out.
[10:00.880 --> 10:06.320]  And now that everyone's watching it, it's blowing up in their face in real time, minute
[10:06.320 --> 10:10.040]  by minute.
[10:10.040 --> 10:12.080]  It's quite a spectacle.
[10:12.080 --> 10:18.800]  And yes, MSM has gone from almost no viewers to having a dead cat bounce the last two years
[10:18.800 --> 10:25.160]  in this election cycle and this great time of change, but still it's dismal.
[10:25.160 --> 10:30.760]  But it's like a star as it begins to burn out and go supernova.
[10:30.760 --> 10:35.680]  It glows brighter for a time or like a light bulb that glows bright for just a few seconds
[10:35.680 --> 10:39.400]  and then goes dim or someone on their deathbed the last few minutes, a lot of times comes
[10:39.400 --> 10:41.840]  back to life and has electricity in their eyes.
[10:41.840 --> 10:47.880]  You're seeing the gargling death rattle of MSM right now.
[10:47.880 --> 10:54.640]  You're seeing them grasp on to their great lust of deceiving and harpooning the Western
[10:54.640 --> 11:03.360]  mind and dragging it into the abyss of control freak garbage.
[11:03.360 --> 11:05.560]  Look at these headlines.
[11:05.560 --> 11:09.120]  Trump rips Amazon, Washington Post is fake news.
[11:09.120 --> 11:15.040]  He should address the nation from the Oval Office and declare them foreign enemies of
[11:15.040 --> 11:20.200]  the Republic who have openly sought to overthrow the country and bankrupt our nation.
[11:20.200 --> 11:21.680]  It's in their own WikiLeaks.
[11:21.680 --> 11:22.880]  It's in their own admissions.
[11:22.880 --> 11:25.760]  They want a system of poverty to control us.
[11:25.760 --> 11:31.520]  It is a conspiracy against prosperity, conspiracy against men and women and children, a conspiracy
[11:31.520 --> 11:33.120]  against families.
[11:33.120 --> 11:38.440]  And now Trump comes out and points out that Amazon's Washington Post got 600 million from
[11:38.440 --> 11:47.720]  Obama's CIA months before Trump took office to run the live factory, the swindle factory
[11:47.720 --> 11:53.080]  trying to rob the American people of their birthright and trying to push us into war
[11:53.080 --> 11:56.520]  with Russia so CNN can get some ratings.
[11:56.520 --> 12:01.440]  That's what they tell the producers, oh, we're getting ratings with this.
[12:01.440 --> 12:09.320]  We're getting a lot of advertising funding from big corporations to do this, CNN.
[12:09.320 --> 12:13.400]  Very, very, very fake news.
[12:13.400 --> 12:17.240]  It's beyond the clown news network or the communist news network.
[12:17.240 --> 12:26.160]  It is the want to be elite class that wants to prey on intellectual endeavors and pose
[12:26.160 --> 12:35.440]  as if they are the fountain, the fount, the progenitor, the headwaters of art and culture
[12:35.440 --> 12:36.440]  and everything.
[12:36.440 --> 12:41.960]  And you see it in all the metrics, Hollywood and mainstream media is all being rejected.
[12:41.960 --> 12:46.600]  There's nothing more uncool than being establishment.
[12:46.600 --> 12:54.560]  There's nothing more pathetic and more wretched and more putrid and more stinking than being
[12:54.560 --> 12:55.840]  with the establishment.
[12:55.840 --> 13:02.200]  It's the spirit of Americana is the maverick culture, a maverick idea of the respect of
[13:02.200 --> 13:09.040]  the common man and woman and the trailblazer and the striver and admiring people that are
[13:09.040 --> 13:15.720]  ranchers and farmers and inventors and mechanics and real people on the ground celebrating
[13:15.720 --> 13:22.640]  our families, celebrating freedom, celebrating that we're not part of the royal class.
[13:22.640 --> 13:27.840]  Alexander de Tocqueville, the famous French historian, spent many years after the Revolutionary
[13:27.840 --> 13:33.200]  War traveling the United States and he said, this is the American future.
[13:33.200 --> 13:35.040]  This is the American century.
[13:35.040 --> 13:37.000]  This is the American system.
[13:37.000 --> 13:40.160]  Nothing will defeat this if they simply stay this way.
[13:40.160 --> 13:41.640]  They hate elites.
[13:41.640 --> 13:44.600]  They hate all of the people on their red carpets.
[13:44.600 --> 13:47.360]  They hate everybody acting like they're part of the establishment.
[13:47.360 --> 13:48.680]  They hate royalty.
[13:48.680 --> 13:49.880]  They hate titles.
[13:49.880 --> 13:54.800]  They hate elites claiming that they have a divine right to rule and if Hollywood and
[13:54.800 --> 14:01.240]  the Washington scum baggery is not the very definition of that, then nothing is.
[14:01.240 --> 14:08.920]  It is an extreme honor to have the discredited enemies of America like the nation and these
[14:08.920 --> 14:15.920]  big foundation funded systems and the New York Times and the Washington Post and every
[14:15.920 --> 14:21.000]  other major elite publication come out and call me a criminal, call me a racist, call
[14:21.000 --> 14:26.560]  me a swindler, call me everything but what they are and we know what they are.
[14:26.560 --> 14:30.160]  We know what their tastes are, vampiric scum.
[14:30.160 --> 14:35.520]  They run the gambit of vampiric behavior.
[14:35.520 --> 14:39.880]  It's all about destroying innocence, all about destroying will, all about destroying creativity
[14:39.880 --> 14:43.480]  and personal independence and personal destiny.
[14:43.480 --> 14:48.440]  It's about stealing free will and stealing destiny and stealing the magic that should
[14:48.440 --> 14:51.760]  be in your eyes staring into the universe.
[14:51.760 --> 14:56.080]  Alex Jones is a practice swindler just like his biggest fan.
[14:56.080 --> 15:01.720]  Eric Ultraman on all his little dozens of titles and the think tanks and foundations
[15:01.720 --> 15:06.800]  he's on and ooh, I mean a bunch of regurgitated crap and again, I'll pick maybe one article
[15:06.800 --> 15:13.080]  a day out of hundreds just to show how it's all the same cut and paste mixed together
[15:13.080 --> 15:21.040]  blended baloney just total lies and you read it, it's crazy.
[15:21.040 --> 15:26.280]  You could disprove any part of this line by line but it would take hours and hours to
[15:26.280 --> 15:27.280]  dissect it.
[15:27.280 --> 15:29.800]  Here's just one example I'm getting in the big news.
[15:29.800 --> 15:36.880]  It says Jones according to BuzzFeed's insiders would go out and buy a life straw for $10 and
[15:36.880 --> 15:44.760]  sell it for $50 or Jones would make them drive down their price to $25.
[15:44.760 --> 15:46.260]  What?
[15:46.260 --> 15:52.920]  We've never sold it for more than $25 but again the point is they just take these lies
[15:52.920 --> 15:58.520]  and then vomit it back into each other's mouths and the more they launder the lies the more
[15:58.520 --> 16:02.560]  they recycle them.
[16:02.560 --> 16:08.520]  The more they say they're true and there's no spending time even talking to these people.
[16:08.520 --> 16:12.520]  They don't really interview you, they only pretend to interview you so they can pretend
[16:12.520 --> 16:14.960]  that they're really reporters.
[16:14.960 --> 16:23.800]  But just that one example, that one example I said just retract this one story, this one
[16:23.800 --> 16:30.400]  piece where life straws and other survival straws on the market sell between $20 and
[16:30.400 --> 16:35.840]  $30, we always want to be competitive and try to be as close to Amazon as we can.
[16:35.840 --> 16:38.040]  I mean we're on the low end of that.
[16:38.040 --> 16:43.480]  We've never, Jones made them sell them for $25, what?
[16:43.480 --> 16:48.000]  And then turned around and sold them for $50, what?
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.240]  Just totally, completely from their inside source, this is the type of stuff these people
[16:53.240 --> 16:54.240]  make up.
[16:54.240 --> 17:02.160]  It's incredible, but see all they're doing is trying to troll us and troll you to make
[17:02.160 --> 17:04.240]  themselves relevant, they're not.
[17:04.240 --> 17:08.200]  That's why I usually don't even cover their lies and deception.
[17:08.200 --> 17:13.960]  It says Jones tries to find failing products that no one wants, no I try to find the most
[17:13.960 --> 17:19.200]  cutting edge products that everyone wants, duh, isn't that how capitalism works?
[17:19.200 --> 17:23.760]  I mean I don't even know how they come up with these weird lies because it's like something
[17:23.760 --> 17:30.600]  you have in a hallucination when you have the flu or something, it's crazy.
[17:30.600 --> 17:38.160]  They go on to say it's crazy that we sell knockout sleep aid and they say I'm a fraud
[17:38.160 --> 17:39.160]  and a swindler.
[17:39.160 --> 17:47.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, knockout is melatonin, L-tryptophan, valerian root, lemon balm and
[17:47.720 --> 17:55.920]  other compounds, 100% proven to trigger chemical reactions in the brain that improve sleep.
[17:55.920 --> 18:01.960]  I mean that's a fact, they've been selling melatonin on store shelves for 60 years.
[18:01.960 --> 18:06.440]  I'm selling the same thing Bezos is selling at Whole Foods that he owns now.
[18:06.440 --> 18:11.960]  But that's okay, see he's allowed to sell melatonin, I can't.
[18:11.960 --> 18:16.200]  I'm an evil person because the anointed ones said so, well guess what?
[18:16.200 --> 18:20.160]  You're not the anointed ones anymore and we're cleaning your clocks and we're infiltrating
[18:20.160 --> 18:25.580]  your organizations not with made up stuff that you just pull out of your rear end but
[18:25.580 --> 18:31.000]  with video of CNN going the whole rush of things BS, we're just getting pushed to do
[18:31.000 --> 18:35.080]  this by our bosses, we lie to the public, how about that?
[18:35.080 --> 18:37.840]  Just like Megyn Kelly, is it ethical he taped her?
[18:37.840 --> 18:43.360]  Of course she's a liar, she has no credibility, she's a fraud so I had to record her to show
[18:43.360 --> 18:48.440]  she was a liar, I knew it was a hit piece, she's not even important enough for us to
[18:48.440 --> 18:53.760]  get around to releasing all the tapes which we're going to do.
[18:53.760 --> 18:57.360]  I've told do and others that are in there monkeying around with them to wait on it.
[18:57.360 --> 19:03.040]  When I say monkey, that's in open transparency because they monkeied with it and so it takes
[19:03.040 --> 19:08.480]  a lot of time and energy to find where I say something 15 minutes before or an hour before
[19:08.480 --> 19:13.040]  or 10 minutes before and then they sandwich it together in another clip and a jump cut
[19:13.040 --> 19:17.800]  so I say something I never said, we've got it, that takes a lot of time of hours and
[19:17.800 --> 19:22.920]  hours of stuff to go find, here's where she edited it, here's what I actually said, kind
[19:22.920 --> 19:27.640]  of like she did, I'm going to skip this break guys, kind of like she did, only one of the
[19:27.640 --> 19:36.120]  day though, kind of like she did whenever she had that Fox show and she said here's
[19:36.120 --> 19:40.880]  a clip of Jones saying Hillary kills children in the bottom of a basement, I was talking
[19:40.880 --> 19:45.440]  about her funding jihadis killing children, selling women into sex slavery all over the
[19:45.440 --> 19:50.480]  Middle East financing the Arab Spring and it was in the same two minute clip, they just
[19:50.480 --> 19:55.840]  cut the front and the back off, we went and showed you what I really said with the video
[19:55.840 --> 19:59.920]  and he's saying it, no edits, no cuts except from the front and the end, we cut in when
[19:59.920 --> 20:04.840]  the ads are over and we cut out when I moved on another subject but unedited, boom here's
[20:04.840 --> 20:11.480]  what I said versus her fake news, I knew if she would do stuff like that and play dumb
[20:11.480 --> 20:15.520]  with me, she called me, I called her back, I started bringing that up to her, she said
[20:15.520 --> 20:19.680]  I don't remember that, I didn't do that and I said hold on one moment, fished around,
[20:19.680 --> 20:23.440]  had another backup phone, didn't even have a record app on my phone, I mean I have a
[20:23.440 --> 20:27.760]  record app where you can record outside but not an app that records the phone call itself
[20:27.760 --> 20:33.680]  on your phone, so I started recording on one phone and recorded her in the car and of course
[20:33.680 --> 20:40.160]  it was ethical what I did, I released it, I released it basically unedited, other stuff
[20:40.160 --> 20:45.160]  about her kids, my kids I cut out but the interest of fairness, I think I might release
[20:45.160 --> 20:51.040]  the whole thing just bleep the names, there's about five minutes we cut out, so I'm not
[20:51.040 --> 20:55.280]  just going to release the Megan Kelly tapes so the media can pick and choose what it wants
[20:55.280 --> 21:02.440]  and edit those again, I'm going to release in chunks where she edited the piece and deceived
[21:02.440 --> 21:05.740]  and then the chunk, say, five minutes of what I really said.
[21:05.740 --> 21:13.080]  And then I'm just going to go chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk, chunk,
[21:13.080 --> 21:18.260]  chunk, chunk and it'll be like a college course, here's how the old horror media lies, here's
[21:18.260 --> 21:22.120]  how the Decepticon Dinosaur media deceives, here's how they played their games, here's
[21:22.120 --> 21:27.200]  what I really said, here's what she did, here's what we said, here's what she did, this is
[21:27.200 --> 21:30.360]  what you want, this is what you get, this is what you want, this is what you get.
[21:30.360 --> 21:34.960]  And by the way, those little classes, those little tutorials online, will have millions
[21:34.960 --> 21:40.800]  of listeners and viewers per video, and in the aggregate root war for a pathetic 3.5
[21:40.800 --> 21:45.200]  million when I was on, when she took over the show it was at 7 million, by the time
[21:45.200 --> 21:51.320]  the dead cat was halfway dropping from the atmosphere on its way to Hades, it was 3.5.
[21:51.320 --> 21:59.200]  Now it's less than 3 million last Sunday as she accelerates into oblivion.
[21:59.200 --> 22:04.080]  I love how they're like trying to destroy me and saying I'm a charlatan and a racist
[22:04.080 --> 22:07.640]  and a criminal and all these things.
[22:07.640 --> 22:10.320]  And it's only making us bigger and stronger.
[22:10.320 --> 22:16.800]  Now they have true horror in their arrogant little eyes, lesser men and women, who imagined
[22:16.800 --> 22:22.400]  that because the great sleeping giant was sleeping, they had bested us, the great little
[22:22.400 --> 22:28.480]  reputions of the world, out to show their dominance aggressively and hatefully against
[22:28.480 --> 22:30.760]  the world and against America.
[22:30.760 --> 22:36.840]  Now their hopes and dreams, the insane psychotic visions of Hollywood, possessing their operating
[22:36.840 --> 22:43.680]  systems begin their retrograde descent back into the atmosphere as they will burn like
[22:43.680 --> 22:47.960]  falling demons from the sky.
[22:47.960 --> 22:53.480]  And their explosions and their incinerations will be merriment in our eyes as we toast
[22:53.480 --> 22:58.320]  around our fires under the great trees that God has provided us.
[22:58.320 --> 23:00.920]  Your fall is complete.
[23:00.920 --> 23:02.760]  I love it.
[23:02.760 --> 23:08.440]  And still in your delirium and your delusional psychosis, you've not even begun to realize
[23:08.440 --> 23:09.960]  that we're not letting go of you.
[23:09.960 --> 23:11.960]  It's not you that's not letting go of us.
[23:11.960 --> 23:14.720]  We have you in our jaws.
[23:14.720 --> 23:16.780]  We have you in our sights.
[23:16.780 --> 23:19.440]  We are going to run you over politically.
[23:19.440 --> 23:25.200]  We are going to celebrate every facet of your wart-covered hide until our children know
[23:25.200 --> 23:30.280]  every centimeter of your stinking, serpent-like soul.
[23:30.280 --> 23:36.360]  You will be caged, and we will stare upon you and know and ask ourselves, how was it
[23:36.360 --> 23:41.420]  that this creature, Madeline Albright, that this creature, Hillary Clinton, that this
[23:41.420 --> 23:45.520]  creature, Barack Obama, that this creature, George Soros, that this creature, Michael
[23:45.520 --> 23:49.920]  Moore, that this creature, Megyn Kelly, caused so much trouble?
[23:49.920 --> 23:56.280]  How was it that a bunch of people wearing nightgowns, 80% of them on welfare, running
[23:56.280 --> 24:00.480]  around wiping their asses with their own hands, coming to our country and dictate what's on
[24:00.480 --> 24:03.600]  the school lunch program?
[24:03.600 --> 24:04.600]  How is it?
[24:04.600 --> 24:05.600]  No.
[24:05.600 --> 24:06.600]  No.
[24:06.600 --> 24:08.800]  The trance is broken.
[24:08.800 --> 24:14.200]  The trance is broken, and we're not offering some utopia from it, but the wild, wild, free-booting
[24:14.200 --> 24:21.840]  west, we're not offering the chained nanny state of old, no, but the destiny of freedom
[24:21.840 --> 24:22.840]  of the future.
[24:22.840 --> 24:25.760]  And it really hit me, and everybody said this, everybody knows this, but it just really
[24:25.760 --> 24:29.200]  hit me how strong this is, how true this is.
[24:29.200 --> 24:34.240]  The liberals are like arrested development toddlers throwing fits, running around, trying
[24:34.240 --> 24:36.440]  to dominate control of people's lives.
[24:36.440 --> 24:40.480]  Anybody who's had children know, but especially once they become teenagers, no matter how
[24:40.480 --> 24:44.240]  good they are on average, they start wanting to run your life.
[24:44.240 --> 24:49.600]  They start getting irritated by the clothes you wear or the carpet you bought or the car
[24:49.600 --> 24:53.880]  you have or the way you talk or what you do, and they want to run your life, because it's
[24:53.880 --> 24:57.680]  almost time for them to leave the nest and actually run their life and discover it.
[24:57.680 --> 25:00.160]  It's a normal instinct that they want to leave your nest.
[25:00.160 --> 25:07.480]  It's normal instinct, but see, arrested development, basement dwellers, they, and I mean that metaphysically,
[25:07.480 --> 25:13.640]  they don't want to leave, but they want to make you drive them around, wipe their butts,
[25:13.640 --> 25:18.560]  take care of them, and they have a disdain for you because they're projecting it onto
[25:18.560 --> 25:19.560]  you.
[25:19.560 --> 25:23.960]  They know they're parasites from the Hollywood parasites and all the broke back fake writers
[25:23.960 --> 25:29.480]  out there like Eric Ultraman and all these jokes that no amount of titles will ever
[25:29.480 --> 25:35.080]  change the fact that they're scum, they come from scum, they're never any good in history,
[25:35.080 --> 25:38.920]  and they are of their father failure.
[25:38.920 --> 25:44.880]  You are cancer, and you know your, you know your filth, you know your trash, you know
[25:44.880 --> 25:49.560]  your losers, you know your babies, you know you want to pull everybody else down so you
[25:49.560 --> 25:58.960]  feel big, sorry daddy's home, daddy woke up, the games are over, and you want war, you're
[25:58.960 --> 26:00.680]  going to get one.
[26:00.680 --> 26:04.880]  This is only the beginning, and see they thought they were strangling us.
[26:04.880 --> 26:08.760]  Now they realize we're awake and strangling them, and they're scared trying to pull away,
[26:08.760 --> 26:14.040]  and we're looking back at their eyes saying no, no, no, no that's not how this works now.
[26:14.040 --> 26:19.360]  This is a fight you wanted, and it's a fight you're going to get.
[26:19.360 --> 26:27.320]  What illustrates this is the video on FullWars.com of liberals who got grants to go out and train
[26:27.320 --> 26:33.480]  for self-defense for the coming civil war, and then they're so mentally ill, they at
[26:33.480 --> 26:37.160]  the events pretend that they're training because we're assaulting them.
[26:37.160 --> 26:42.280]  No, you're assaulting us, and you know that, 30 to 1, they're being arrested for violence
[26:42.280 --> 26:43.280]  everywhere.
[26:43.280 --> 26:46.760]  We've all seen the evidence, I've been on the ground, I've witnessed it.
[26:46.760 --> 26:51.560]  But then in their own operating system, they're still the victim, and then it looks like nerds
[26:51.560 --> 26:56.600]  from Napoleon Dynamite or something, like a joke movie where you would show like the
[26:56.600 --> 27:00.520]  most chicken neck weaklings combat training.
[27:00.520 --> 27:04.080]  This is the greatest unintentional comedy ever seen on earth.
[27:04.080 --> 27:10.400]  Watch, the Left prepares for war with New Self-Defense Training Club.
[27:10.400 --> 27:17.360]  I mean, it is just amazing how these people are controlled by foreign banks.
[27:17.360 --> 27:20.240]  Their whole ideology is a psychological warfare system.
[27:20.240 --> 27:24.640]  They are the biggest failure dweebies controlled by the globalists, not even knowing that they're
[27:24.640 --> 27:25.760]  useful idiots.
[27:25.760 --> 27:31.760]  And now they can barely even do a push-up, and they're combat training now for the coming
[27:31.760 --> 27:39.600]  war that they've already started, but that they believe we've launched.
[27:39.600 --> 27:44.200]  The Haymaker Collective, I mean, this, ladies and gentlemen, is awesome, because you know
[27:44.200 --> 27:45.920]  why?
[27:45.920 --> 27:50.000]  This is the beginning of them rediscovering their humanity, so they were taught, be pathetic,
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.880]  be part of a large group, act like you're passive, everyone will give you a position
[27:54.880 --> 27:56.760]  as long as you're a good servant of this.
[27:56.760 --> 28:00.360]  And the fact that they're abandoning that, the fact that they're at least realizing they
[28:00.360 --> 28:04.760]  need to become strong, even though they have the wrong enemy, is the beginning of them
[28:04.760 --> 28:10.360]  rediscovering an atmosphere, rediscovering gravity, rediscovering that you need stress
[28:10.360 --> 28:16.520]  to actually be stronger, that the avoidance of stress is what creates entropy and rotting
[28:16.520 --> 28:18.320]  stagnant systems.
[28:18.320 --> 28:24.360]  And so they get lazier and lazier and lazier and more and more selfish with their time and
[28:24.360 --> 28:30.160]  what they do until they're totally soft, totally unhappy, and then see other people driving
[28:30.160 --> 28:36.720]  their big trucks, shooting their guns, working 12 hours a day, having fun, being aggressive,
[28:36.720 --> 28:39.640]  and it's scary to them to hear a man chuckle.
[28:39.640 --> 28:43.960]  It's scary to them to see a man slap his wife on the rear end and her laugh at it.
[28:43.960 --> 28:48.760]  It's scary to see people's cars open up and children boiling out with electrical energy
[28:48.760 --> 28:50.240]  and building things.
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.920]  These people go, ah, I don't want that, I don't want the cool kids around me.
[28:55.920 --> 28:58.640]  They want to pull down their own civilization.
[28:58.640 --> 29:02.960]  They're domesticated, they're toddlers, but in the fact that liberals now are all over
[29:02.960 --> 29:07.120]  the news and they're the newest, biggest group buying guns saying, I'm preparing for civil
[29:07.120 --> 29:11.700]  war with the right wingers, thank God you just joined us and didn't know it.
[29:11.700 --> 29:14.240]  The second amendment is for a tyrannical government.
[29:14.240 --> 29:17.680]  You've got the wrong government in mind, you think America's the enemy, but you're gonna
[29:17.680 --> 29:21.200]  flip sides in the end, just like the German soldiers they brought over here by the tens
[29:21.200 --> 29:24.760]  of thousands that the highest defection rate Hessians ever had.
[29:24.760 --> 29:29.040]  They never had Hessians defecting, they came over here, they said, this is great, we're
[29:29.040 --> 29:30.040]  joining you.
[29:30.040 --> 29:31.040]  Yeah, great, let's do it.
[29:31.040 --> 29:37.120]  Go out, go out, train, get your guns, march up mountains, become humans again, good.
[29:37.120 --> 29:40.280]  And then by the time you climb that mountain, you're gonna turn around and look me in the
[29:40.280 --> 29:44.160]  eyes and see yourself and we're gonna reach out and shake hands and hug each other and
[29:44.160 --> 29:48.640]  we're gonna go to the stars, join humanity, defeat the Satanist.
[29:48.640 --> 29:55.920]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:55.920 --> 30:03.080]  The struggle in the DNC fraud lawsuit continues.
[30:03.080 --> 30:07.840]  You've had the current counsel for the plaintiffs request that the judge provide witness protection.
[30:07.840 --> 30:13.040]  That notion was rejected despite three mysterious deaths of potential witnesses in the case,
[30:13.040 --> 30:16.440]  Beth Rich, Sean Lucas and Barrington Weisenand Jr.
[30:16.440 --> 30:20.120]  There are also stalwarts in the justice system that are trying to have this case dropped
[30:20.120 --> 30:21.640]  entirely.
[30:21.640 --> 30:25.880]  Despite the obvious glaring issues that the DNC has had over the course of the last two
[30:25.880 --> 30:29.760]  years, while the lawsuit represents Bernie Sanders supporters who feel they have been
[30:29.760 --> 30:34.520]  wronged by the DNC, Bernie Sanders has fallen silent on the issue.
[30:34.520 --> 30:38.120]  Donald Trump tweeted out this weekend, Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democrat Party in
[30:38.120 --> 30:40.080]  order to beat crazy Bernie Sanders.
[30:40.080 --> 30:41.440]  Is she allowed to collude?
[30:41.440 --> 30:42.440]  Unfair to Bernie.
[30:42.440 --> 30:46.440]  So now Donald Trump has done more to raise awareness for the DNC fraud lawsuit than Bernie
[30:46.440 --> 30:50.320]  Sanders has, who actually is the one that had the election stolen from him.
[30:50.320 --> 30:52.800]  Why is Bernie Sanders silent on the issue?
[30:52.800 --> 30:57.080]  Maybe I guess he's busy with being investigated by the FBI for bank fraud.
[30:57.080 --> 30:59.760]  For Infowars.com, this is Owen Schreuer.
[30:59.760 --> 31:01.640]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[31:01.640 --> 31:03.640]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[31:03.640 --> 31:06.520]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[31:06.520 --> 31:12.560]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[31:12.560 --> 31:17.520]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking
[31:17.520 --> 31:22.480]  water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breeze, whether it's your home
[31:22.480 --> 31:27.560]  or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children, to the best job
[31:27.560 --> 31:29.320]  you can to purify your air.
[31:29.320 --> 31:34.320]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[31:34.320 --> 31:37.320]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[31:37.320 --> 31:39.520]  The general public doesn't.
[31:39.520 --> 31:43.480]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[31:43.480 --> 31:47.080]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[31:47.080 --> 31:50.640]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[31:50.640 --> 31:53.840]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[31:53.840 --> 31:58.160]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today, at InfowarsStore.com.
[31:58.160 --> 32:01.800]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us.
[32:01.800 --> 32:03.160]  It took you over a year to do it.
[32:03.160 --> 32:04.160]  Why is this so good?
[32:04.160 --> 32:09.520]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[32:09.520 --> 32:14.200]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[32:14.200 --> 32:15.200]  my system.
[32:15.200 --> 32:20.440]  But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[32:20.440 --> 32:25.720]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading
[32:25.720 --> 32:26.960]  disease around.
[32:26.960 --> 32:29.560]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[32:29.560 --> 32:30.560]  These are all parasites.
[32:30.560 --> 32:33.280]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[32:33.280 --> 32:34.560]  You have the neem in there.
[32:34.560 --> 32:37.640]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[32:37.640 --> 32:40.920]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[32:40.920 --> 32:41.920]  All right.
[32:41.920 --> 32:44.120]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[32:44.120 --> 32:45.280]  It just came back in yesterday.
[32:45.280 --> 32:46.280]  Living Defense, InfowarsLive.com.
[32:46.280 --> 32:50.920]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[32:50.920 --> 32:54.200]  And you support the broadcast, InfowarsLive.com.
[32:54.200 --> 32:56.440]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[32:56.440 --> 33:24.440]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[33:24.440 --> 33:30.080]  We can break the conditioning of the folks that have been put into their romper room,
[33:30.080 --> 33:34.440]  playpen, arrest and development.
[33:34.440 --> 33:35.440]  Trendy gangs.
[33:35.440 --> 33:42.600]  That's what they created, was gangs of people that played with Play-Doh when they were 25
[33:42.600 --> 33:45.760]  and who do basket weaving and coloring books.
[33:45.760 --> 33:49.440]  If they see a pocket constitution on the campus, they come and cry.
[33:49.440 --> 33:52.560]  And the faculty, there's video of this, take them in and then they cry.
[33:52.560 --> 33:53.560]  Sometimes they even pee-pee on themselves.
[33:53.560 --> 33:54.560]  They were diapers.
[33:54.560 --> 33:55.560]  I'm not kidding.
[33:55.560 --> 33:57.200]  That's the new thing.
[33:57.200 --> 33:58.200]  And watch.
[33:58.200 --> 34:02.200]  The Live Prepairs for War with New Shelt Defense Training Club.
[34:02.200 --> 34:06.880]  I thought you could just teach us all to be passive and everything.
[34:06.880 --> 34:07.880]  That would fix everything.
[34:07.880 --> 34:09.280]  That was the big social engineering program.
[34:09.280 --> 34:11.880]  But the globalists admitted that was for outward consumption.
[34:11.880 --> 34:17.360]  They wanted to serve all groups of the hyper predators that enslave everybody.
[34:17.360 --> 34:20.000]  And that's what we now face.
[34:20.000 --> 34:22.080]  It's like the headlines everywhere.
[34:22.080 --> 34:27.680]  The war on science we witness where most of the scientists and the astrophysicists and
[34:27.680 --> 34:35.640]  climatologists say it's the sun driving it and we have these 10,000-year cycles and 100-year
[34:35.640 --> 34:38.520]  cycles and 11-year cycles.
[34:38.520 --> 34:42.640]  And they can predict it with total precision.
[34:42.640 --> 34:47.520]  They know when they're solar flares that hit the earth, that is the electromagnetic radiation,
[34:47.520 --> 34:54.760]  but that's why clear blue skies suddenly have thunderstorms everywhere in a few hours.
[34:54.760 --> 35:00.400]  That's what the Pentagon goes off of for weather for more than 50 years is sunspots.
[35:00.400 --> 35:06.200]  But they have all these compartmentalized groups that go, no, meteorologist groups.
[35:06.200 --> 35:09.600]  We just say it's all what's on earth and what's happening here.
[35:09.600 --> 35:15.040]  And then the UN has a vote six years ago to say, we vote and say the sun is not the driver
[35:15.040 --> 35:16.040]  of climate.
[35:16.040 --> 35:17.040]  It's humans.
[35:17.040 --> 35:20.640]  If we didn't have the sun, we'd be absolute zero.
[35:20.640 --> 35:23.440]  There'd be no life.
[35:23.440 --> 35:25.440]  But they go, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[35:25.440 --> 35:29.920]  Oh, mainstream media is saying, in Venezuela, no one believes that the helicopter attack
[35:29.920 --> 35:33.880]  was real because no one's been arrested and for two hours, no one tried to stop the helicopter
[35:33.880 --> 35:35.560]  shooting and bombing the building.
[35:35.560 --> 35:37.360]  It looks like a false flag.
[35:37.360 --> 35:38.360]  Think so?
[35:38.360 --> 35:39.360]  Shooting?
[35:39.360 --> 35:42.640]  Bombing it with hand grenades for two hours?
[35:42.640 --> 35:44.000]  No one even fights back?
[35:44.000 --> 35:49.160]  Gee, think it might be a staged event to make the police state look okay?
[35:49.160 --> 35:50.160]  I'm not saying it is.
[35:50.160 --> 35:55.920]  I'm saying that's normal to ask that of a discredited government that's been caught
[35:55.920 --> 35:59.480]  lying more times than Pinocchio ever thought about.
[35:59.480 --> 36:01.880]  More times than Bill Clinton never thought about.
[36:01.880 --> 36:03.360]  And then the story doesn't add up.
[36:03.360 --> 36:05.800]  Gee, could it be a false flag?
[36:05.800 --> 36:08.000]  I got up early this morning at like 5 a.m.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.720]  I went back to sleep for about an hour.
[36:11.720 --> 36:14.600]  But I got about 5 a.m. and I went, well, the little factoid matters.
[36:14.600 --> 36:17.200]  And I said, that's a false flag.
[36:17.200 --> 36:20.040]  And then soon enough, I got up later, it's all over the news.
[36:20.040 --> 36:25.080]  False flag, false flag, fake, staged, no one believes it's real.
[36:25.080 --> 36:28.480]  Conspiracies abound after a bizarre Venezuela helicopter incident.
[36:28.480 --> 36:29.480]  That's from Bloomberg.
[36:29.480 --> 36:32.280]  But see, only Bloomberg can question.
[36:32.280 --> 36:36.720]  It's the anointed one, oh, you can question and say Trump's a liar.
[36:36.720 --> 36:40.400]  You can question this and that and say things aren't real and give out alternative ideas,
[36:40.400 --> 36:41.400]  but no one else can.
[36:41.400 --> 36:47.800]  Only the anointed media, only people at the nation, propped up by foundation money, can't
[36:47.800 --> 36:49.280]  even pay their own way.
[36:49.280 --> 36:53.040]  Only Eric Alterman with all of his titles.
[36:53.040 --> 36:57.360]  Only he can tell you what's real.
[36:57.360 --> 36:59.840]  Roger Stone is joining us from Eastern Europe.
[36:59.840 --> 37:03.520]  He's been over in Hungary and Romania, where they have national parties taking control
[37:03.520 --> 37:07.840]  through the elections against the Soros movement, the IMF, the World Bank, the attempts to open
[37:07.840 --> 37:10.200]  their borders to Islamists.
[37:10.200 --> 37:15.240]  This is huge news, but another big reason he's on with us is because he's been totally
[37:15.240 --> 37:16.240]  vindicated.
[37:16.240 --> 37:22.840]  Scaramucci, the financier, good friends with Stone, great patriot in the White House, targeted
[37:22.840 --> 37:26.240]  from the beginning as a Russian agent, has filed a $100 million lawsuit.
[37:26.240 --> 37:30.680]  Now that we have total proof that CNN willfully and knowingly tried to frame him and destroy
[37:30.680 --> 37:34.720]  his name and get him thrown in prison, oh, that jury's not going to like to hear that.
[37:34.720 --> 37:40.240]  They wanted to put him in jail and destroy his self-made fortune saying he's a Russian
[37:40.240 --> 37:42.520]  agent knowing it was a lie.
[37:42.520 --> 37:46.160]  These are hardcore patriots in the Trump administration.
[37:46.160 --> 37:51.400]  The ones who are trying to kick out, General Flynn, Scaramucci.
[37:51.400 --> 37:54.600]  Trump rips Amazon's Washington Post's fake news.
[37:54.600 --> 37:59.000]  Trump brands New York Times liars again for writing false story claiming he doesn't understand
[37:59.000 --> 38:00.520]  the Senate's health bill.
[38:00.520 --> 38:01.520]  He's striking back.
[38:01.520 --> 38:05.800]  CNN faces a $100 million lawsuit over botched Russian story.
[38:05.800 --> 38:09.360]  CNN war with Trump gets personal.
[38:09.360 --> 38:14.240]  New Lo, CNN uses Sesame Street, Omo, to attack Trump's travel ban.
[38:14.240 --> 38:15.600]  They don't know what to do.
[38:15.600 --> 38:22.120]  And then Acosta, the famous liar of CNN who's always caught being fake stories but gets
[38:22.120 --> 38:26.600]  rewarded, throws a temper tantrum that's coming up and says, this isn't America.
[38:26.600 --> 38:29.520]  You're going to conservative media half the time.
[38:29.520 --> 38:34.400]  Oh my gosh, you don't get the big spotlight only for your little self anymore?
[38:34.400 --> 38:38.080]  But radio and TV networks with more viewers do?
[38:38.080 --> 38:44.080]  That upsets you, you poor little baby, poor little cuppy cake.
[38:44.080 --> 38:48.760]  The media will do anything to bash Trump and now they're hurting.
[38:48.760 --> 38:49.760]  That's right.
[38:49.760 --> 38:50.760]  The P.P.
[38:50.760 --> 38:53.760]  dossier written up by the Democrats admittedly to be a fraud.
[38:53.760 --> 38:54.760]  All of it complete lies.
[38:54.760 --> 38:58.760]  Just like to talk about me, total whole cloth lies.
[38:58.760 --> 39:02.040]  Did you know my children are with me 80 plus percent of the time?
[39:02.040 --> 39:04.840]  But you wouldn't know that reading the newspaper, would you?
[39:04.840 --> 39:06.800]  Because they're liars.
[39:06.800 --> 39:12.200]  It's literal whole cloth, sand, tabulous BS and it's all coming home to roast.
[39:12.200 --> 39:14.080]  Now I saw this politically three weeks ago.
[39:14.080 --> 39:15.080]  I said it on air.
[39:15.080 --> 39:18.360]  I called Stone and I said, you want to have that celebration come to Austin?
[39:18.360 --> 39:19.800]  I didn't want to have a celebration out of the election.
[39:19.800 --> 39:21.760]  I said, this is the real war starting.
[39:21.760 --> 39:22.760]  They're coming for us.
[39:22.760 --> 39:27.200]  But I can tell you at my gut level but also intellectually, Trump has massively turned
[39:27.200 --> 39:28.400]  the corner.
[39:28.400 --> 39:30.160]  He's delivering on so many fronts.
[39:30.160 --> 39:31.160]  It's unbelievable.
[39:31.160 --> 39:32.160]  Forget the other.
[39:32.160 --> 39:33.160]  The taxes are important.
[39:33.160 --> 39:35.920]  But it might take him a year to get that health care.
[39:35.920 --> 39:40.600]  They're trying to act like that's a defeat that hasn't got done killing TPP, killing
[39:40.600 --> 39:45.960]  the carbon tax 40 plus percent down on the illegals coming across the border, devolving
[39:45.960 --> 39:51.480]  power back to the states, massive regulation cuts, three trillion in the stock market,
[39:51.480 --> 39:55.440]  hundreds and hundreds of billions of new jobs, thousands of companies coming back, the world
[39:55.440 --> 40:00.320]  respecting us again, the highly respected Indian prime minister who's turned India around,
[40:00.320 --> 40:02.040]  hugging Trump on stage.
[40:02.040 --> 40:06.120]  Never does that because they're under Islamic attack, 140 million Hindus have been killed
[40:06.120 --> 40:08.760]  by Muslims in the last thousand plus years.
[40:08.760 --> 40:10.560]  So this is an epic time.
[40:10.560 --> 40:13.720]  India's the only place in the whole area that held out for the Muslims, folks, 140 million
[40:13.720 --> 40:14.720]  have been killed.
[40:14.720 --> 40:16.280]  They try this brown skin thing.
[40:16.280 --> 40:17.280]  Oh, we don't like Muslims.
[40:17.280 --> 40:18.280]  A lot of them are brown skin.
[40:18.280 --> 40:19.480]  Give me a break, folks.
[40:19.480 --> 40:20.800]  The Indians know.
[40:20.800 --> 40:23.320]  And so this is an incredible time to be alive.
[40:23.320 --> 40:28.000]  Joining us from Europe, I know he's been in Hungary, Romania, you name it, speaking to
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.320]  the presidents and leaders there about the United Front against the globalist, Roger
[40:33.320 --> 40:34.320]  Stone.
[40:34.320 --> 40:35.320]  Thank you for joining us.
[40:35.320 --> 40:36.320]  Alex, great to be here.
[40:36.320 --> 40:43.960]  I got to tell you, as I have moved across Budapest and today, Bucharest, the number of
[40:43.960 --> 40:50.160]  people who have given me the thumbs up and yell, info wars, info wars, Alex Jones is
[40:50.160 --> 40:56.560]  stunning, you, my friend, are a very popular man here and you have a very, very strong
[40:56.560 --> 40:57.560]  following.
[40:57.560 --> 40:58.560]  I know.
[40:58.560 --> 40:59.560]  And so do you.
[40:59.560 --> 41:00.560]  But that's what I'm saying.
[41:00.560 --> 41:01.560]  We're not bragging.
[41:01.560 --> 41:03.040]  I literally can't walk down the street now anywhere.
[41:03.040 --> 41:04.400]  I can go to South America.
[41:04.400 --> 41:05.400]  I can go to Europe.
[41:05.400 --> 41:06.400]  I can go to Canada.
[41:06.400 --> 41:07.760]  It is we're being mobbed.
[41:07.760 --> 41:12.680]  And again, it's minorities, it's old people, it's young people, which shows us the polls
[41:12.680 --> 41:13.680]  are fake.
[41:13.680 --> 41:17.720]  Plus, we scientifically know they sample nine to 15 points more Democrat.
[41:17.720 --> 41:22.240]  So Trump's really at what, 60, 65, not 50 in Gallup.
[41:22.240 --> 41:23.520]  I think that's about right.
[41:23.520 --> 41:29.040]  I totally agree with your analysis that the president has turned the corner on the mainstream
[41:29.040 --> 41:36.800]  media assault on him and the two party duopoly attempts to destabilize and delegitimize his
[41:36.800 --> 41:37.800]  presidency.
[41:37.800 --> 41:44.040]  To me, the seminal moment was when he said on Twitter, I don't know if there are tapes
[41:44.040 --> 41:49.880]  of James Comey, certainly possible that the deep state was taping, they've been taping
[41:49.880 --> 41:51.440]  all over the place.
[41:51.440 --> 41:54.720]  They have been recording people and spying.
[41:54.720 --> 42:01.720]  He's finally, I think, turned the table and recognizes that the FISA court ruling some
[42:01.720 --> 42:07.560]  weeks ago that we learned about that chided the Obama administration for the widespread
[42:07.560 --> 42:15.240]  unconstitutional surveillance of American citizens is the key issue to take down the
[42:15.240 --> 42:22.920]  globalist is the key issue to provide for the prosecution of Susan Rice, Valerie Jarrett
[42:22.920 --> 42:24.920]  and yes, Barack Obama.
[42:24.920 --> 42:27.240]  And by the way, let me just interrupt you back to you.
[42:27.240 --> 42:32.320]  They have quadrupled down though, no coverage of CNN and all the firings and all the people
[42:32.320 --> 42:37.840]  resigning three fake Russia stories in one week, all of it imploding their own top producer
[42:37.840 --> 42:41.960]  on tape admitting it's all made up to push for war with Russia, pushing us towards World
[42:41.960 --> 42:43.360]  War three for ratings.
[42:43.360 --> 42:47.920]  I mean, total criminality here and you've been totally vindicated, scary Mochi's been
[42:47.920 --> 42:50.240]  totally vindicated, the whole thing's fake.
[42:50.240 --> 42:55.520]  But you turn on CNN today, they are saying your name every five minutes, which isn't
[42:55.520 --> 42:58.760]  that big a deal, because hardly anybody watches it, but it shows.
[42:58.760 --> 43:03.000]  And they're still saying, well, maybe Stone isn't a criminal after all, you know, but
[43:03.000 --> 43:07.280]  he did meet with Goose for all this made up crap as a journalist, of course, you contacted
[43:07.280 --> 43:09.000]  Goose for in a public forum.
[43:09.000 --> 43:12.560]  Who didn't we tried to contact him as well, when we've been beaten down a son's door.
[43:12.560 --> 43:17.600]  I mean, everybody else can have a son, John, but but we can't again, it's crazy.
[43:17.600 --> 43:20.080]  So their whole witch hunt is imploding.
[43:20.080 --> 43:23.760]  How does the Empire strike back because they are in full panic, chicken with their head
[43:23.760 --> 43:25.600]  caught off mode right now.
[43:25.600 --> 43:30.560]  Well, as you know, Alex, I have agreed to testify for the House Intelligence Committee
[43:30.560 --> 43:33.040]  on July 24.
[43:33.040 --> 43:40.120]  I was tickled to watch a round table on CNN in which one congressman, a congressman,
[43:40.120 --> 43:44.920]  by the way, that I have documentation has been paying his personal living expenses through
[43:44.920 --> 43:50.200]  his congressional campaign, a felony for which I predict he will go to prison, predicted
[43:50.200 --> 43:54.280]  that I would be going to jail in the Russian scandal.
[43:54.280 --> 43:56.400]  Which is laughable.
[43:56.400 --> 44:04.520]  The inference that my contact with Goose for 2.0, which is entirely public, implies collusion
[44:04.520 --> 44:10.800]  with the Russian state is disproved by the timing, the content and the context of that
[44:10.800 --> 44:11.800]  content.
[44:11.800 --> 44:12.800]  And they know that it happens.
[44:12.800 --> 44:15.680]  And they know that they knew it when they made the charge.
[44:15.680 --> 44:22.800]  In fact, Congressman Adam Schiff purposely conflated the dates in which I wrote for Breitbart
[44:22.800 --> 44:25.240]  that Goose for was not a Russian agent.
[44:25.240 --> 44:32.760]  And the date that I began an exchange with him on Twitter, direct message, which I released
[44:32.760 --> 44:35.160]  entirely and which is benign.
[44:35.160 --> 44:41.720]  But by reversing the dates, willfully reversing the dates, Schiff attempted to create the
[44:41.720 --> 44:44.360]  impression of wrongdoing that did and not.
[44:44.360 --> 44:47.040]  And now what do you make of them all back peddling?
[44:47.040 --> 44:51.120]  What do you make of Dianne Feinstein signing the letter for the criminal investigation
[44:51.120 --> 44:52.120]  of Loretta Lynch?
[44:52.120 --> 44:55.120]  Is this not the house of cards falling as we speak?
[44:55.120 --> 45:03.080]  Well, and it has taken some mighty pounding by info wars and others in the alternative
[45:03.080 --> 45:04.080]  media.
[45:04.080 --> 45:10.320]  It has only been a question of when the president would recognize that he had the power to turn
[45:10.320 --> 45:12.680]  the table on his enemies.
[45:12.680 --> 45:14.640]  He tried turning the other cheek.
[45:14.640 --> 45:16.240]  He met with Al Gore.
[45:16.240 --> 45:17.840]  He met with Al Sharpton.
[45:17.840 --> 45:21.040]  He said perhaps Hillary shouldn't be prosecuted.
[45:21.040 --> 45:22.160]  He held out the ally.
[45:22.160 --> 45:26.280]  He invited them to have a seat at the table, but with American prosperity.
[45:26.280 --> 45:29.600]  They made 30 plus percent at Goldman Sachs the first three months.
[45:29.600 --> 45:33.960]  And Lloyd Blankfein's response was to try to take out Trump because Blankfein doesn't
[45:33.960 --> 45:38.640]  want the general public to be part of this massive prosperity.
[45:38.640 --> 45:42.840]  He wants it all for himself and that's their sin.
[45:42.840 --> 45:43.840]  That's exactly right.
[45:43.840 --> 45:46.080]  The elites want to keep the wealth for themselves.
[45:46.080 --> 45:50.040]  They do not want it to fall into the hands of the American people.
[45:50.040 --> 45:53.480]  Donald Trump is a middle class American president.
[45:53.480 --> 45:59.600]  He represents the working people of this country, not the Wall Street Big Shots, not the major
[45:59.600 --> 46:01.120]  financial institution.
[46:01.120 --> 46:02.120]  And they're now panicking.
[46:02.120 --> 46:03.120]  They just hate it.
[46:03.120 --> 46:05.000]  They just hate it on Wall Street.
[46:05.000 --> 46:06.000]  They hate it.
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.400]  They've hit us and Trump, everything they've got.
[46:08.400 --> 46:15.600]  As he strengthens, as he gets more hardcore, they vanish like vampires at daybreak.
[46:15.600 --> 46:17.640]  In your gut though, how does the empire strike back?
[46:17.640 --> 46:21.320]  I mean, I don't want us to, like the wolf says in Pulp Fiction, start celebrating here
[46:21.320 --> 46:22.320]  too much.
[46:22.320 --> 46:23.320]  But I can see the victory.
[46:23.320 --> 46:24.320]  I can smell it.
[46:24.320 --> 46:26.280]  They have gone into full hysteria mode.
[46:26.280 --> 46:29.240]  They've got brigades of nerds out training for combat now.
[46:29.240 --> 46:33.800]  I mean, they've gone into pure insane asylum because this horrible Trump, you know, wanted
[46:33.800 --> 46:37.160]  them to have a better job and lower taxes.
[46:37.160 --> 46:40.960]  I think that they have an absolute violent revolution in mind.
[46:40.960 --> 46:48.360]  I have been in Hungary and Romania now meeting with the anti-Soros forces within the democratically
[46:48.360 --> 46:54.960]  elected government here, and they realize that Soros is a cancer, and that he seeks
[46:54.960 --> 46:59.520]  to subvert and overturn the democratically elected government here through violence.
[46:59.520 --> 47:04.760]  He has spent a fortune planting his people within the government, not only the governments
[47:04.760 --> 47:06.800]  of Hungary and Romania.
[47:06.800 --> 47:15.640]  But let me be very clear, Alex, the U.S. embassies in Budapest and in Bucharest are both completely
[47:15.640 --> 47:22.000]  staffed by George Soros loyalists, people who are doing Soros' bidding.
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.440]  And they've all got to be removed because they're infiltrators in our country, they're
[47:25.440 --> 47:30.320]  infiltrators in Europe, and they openly are behind the Arab Spring and the Islamic invasion.
[47:30.320 --> 47:33.760]  They have double crossed us with the radical Muslims.
[47:33.760 --> 47:37.760]  This is high treason, and Hungary and others recognize it, and I salute them.
[47:37.760 --> 47:38.760]  Go ahead.
[47:38.760 --> 47:43.640]  What's interesting here, of course, is that neither Hungary nor Romania has a substantial
[47:43.640 --> 47:46.640]  Muslim population.
[47:46.640 --> 47:47.640]  This is a real problem.
[47:47.640 --> 47:51.600]  Because they got overrun about a hundred times in the last 1400 years and barely fought
[47:51.600 --> 47:53.600]  for their lives.
[47:53.600 --> 47:54.600]  Exactly right.
[47:54.600 --> 47:59.080]  So what has happened here is he is struggling to subvert these democracies.
[47:59.080 --> 48:03.400]  He is definitely in league with the intelligence services here.
[48:03.400 --> 48:09.360]  The intelligence services in both governments are rogue operations, more in line with our
[48:09.360 --> 48:11.800]  CIA than they are with their own government.
[48:11.800 --> 48:15.800]  They've been exploiting their people just like the deep state here.
[48:15.800 --> 48:18.280]  Even worse, I think the surveillance, for example.
[48:18.280 --> 48:22.400]  I was briefed on surveillance in Romania today.
[48:22.400 --> 48:25.760]  Lord, half the people in this state are being spied on.
[48:25.760 --> 48:29.800]  Half the people in this country are under surveillance.
[48:29.800 --> 48:31.200]  It's chilling.
[48:31.200 --> 48:37.520]  What Soros has in mind, he has to be stopped, these open society institutions that he has
[48:37.520 --> 48:43.120]  set up, which are fronts for terrorism and worse, need to be shut down.
[48:43.120 --> 48:47.560]  He needs to be apprehended, charged, tried, and jailed.
[48:47.560 --> 48:50.320]  That is the answer, in my opinion.
[48:50.320 --> 48:51.320]  Absolutely.
[48:51.320 --> 48:56.560]  And again, folks, imagine being in Ukraine or Egypt, and they overthrow the government
[48:56.560 --> 49:01.360]  and start blowing up the churches and murdering everybody, you know, in the case of the Arab
[49:01.360 --> 49:04.240]  Spring and in the case of what happened in Ukraine.
[49:04.240 --> 49:09.080]  I mean, this is psychotic behavior, and it's the arrogance of Soros.
[49:09.080 --> 49:13.240]  How has he gotten away with this for so long?
[49:13.240 --> 49:14.400]  It's really extraordinary.
[49:14.400 --> 49:21.720]  Initially, in these Eastern European countries, he was viewed as a benefactor.
[49:21.720 --> 49:26.480]  It's extraordinary the number of people in government whose college educations he is
[49:26.480 --> 49:31.080]  paid for, not realizing that in return for their scholarships, they're preparing to give
[49:31.080 --> 49:36.200]  up their freedoms, that he plans a totalitarian state here.
[49:36.200 --> 49:42.040]  This guy is potentially worse than anything Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin ever even dreamed
[49:42.040 --> 49:43.040]  about.
[49:43.040 --> 49:44.040]  Well, he said that in the 80s.
[49:44.040 --> 49:47.360]  He said, I believe I am the Messiah, but I didn't want to tell people that until I become
[49:47.360 --> 49:48.360]  the Messiah.
[49:48.360 --> 49:49.360]  They might lock me up.
[49:49.360 --> 49:50.360]  That's a quote.
[49:50.360 --> 49:52.720]  I'm the Messiah.
[49:52.720 --> 49:57.600]  This guy is a common criminal who, as you know, beat his girlfriend in New York City
[49:57.600 --> 50:04.040]  very badly, but faced no charges as a common citizen would.
[50:04.040 --> 50:09.600]  It's just breathtaking the extent to which he is seeking to undermine these governments,
[50:09.600 --> 50:11.640]  the extent to which he is.
[50:11.640 --> 50:15.240]  Why doesn't the president really take the gloves off and criminally moving in Soros
[50:15.240 --> 50:16.240]  right now?
[50:16.240 --> 50:21.520]  Well, I believe that the president of Romania put that on the table when he met with the
[50:21.520 --> 50:23.040]  president last week.
[50:23.040 --> 50:30.280]  I believe that they are beginning to understand the grave threat that Soros opposes not only
[50:30.280 --> 50:36.960]  in the United States, but abroad and why the president has not yet directed Jeff Sessions
[50:36.960 --> 50:41.600]  to move aggressively against George Soros is a mystery to me.
[50:41.600 --> 50:46.800]  And by the way, this isn't a U.S. citizen issue, he's a multinational global crime kingpin.
[50:46.800 --> 50:49.040]  They should use the army on him and his cohorts.
[50:49.040 --> 50:50.040]  I'm serious.
[50:50.040 --> 50:56.960]  I mean, I would cheer the helicopters going in there and, you know, that's just what Soros
[50:56.960 --> 50:57.960]  wants.
[50:57.960 --> 50:58.960]  We'll be right back.
[50:58.960 --> 51:03.880]  Hi, this is Ron Paul, former congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[51:03.880 --> 51:08.240]  I love these summer months because this is when I get to enjoy the fresh fruits and vegetables
[51:08.240 --> 51:12.040]  that are being harvested on small farms and in our backyards.
[51:12.040 --> 51:15.040]  We all look forward to garden tomatoes and corn on the cob.
[51:15.040 --> 51:18.880]  Don't you wish there was a better way to preserve their true taste and flavors?
[51:18.880 --> 51:21.720]  I'm here to tell you that there is a better way.
[51:21.720 --> 51:25.840]  It's by using the amazing home freeze dryer from Harvest Right.
[51:25.840 --> 51:30.000]  I have a Harvest Right freeze dryer and use it to preserve the foods I love.
[51:30.000 --> 51:35.280]  Strawberries, apples, and even lasagna and ice cream can stay fresh for 25 years.
[51:35.280 --> 51:39.760]  And the best part of my freeze drying is my family and I have a supply of long lasting
[51:39.760 --> 51:41.080]  food on hand.
[51:41.080 --> 51:44.400]  So no matter what may come, we feel better prepared.

[53:56.680 --> 54:09.040]  I've been interrupting Stone a lot just to have him jump to all these different points,
[54:09.040 --> 54:10.840]  always amazing having him on.
[54:10.840 --> 54:13.800]  You can feel the energy, you can feel the victory, I haven't even gotten to the powerful
[54:13.800 --> 54:18.680]  press conferences and the White House Deputy Press Secretary annihilating them with the
[54:18.680 --> 54:24.520]  James O'Keefe video and saying go watch the footage because that news had been out for
[54:24.520 --> 54:27.560]  a day but mainstream media was ignoring it.
[54:27.560 --> 54:32.120]  But you see now we have an ally and the President and so they force it, now it's all over the
[54:32.120 --> 54:36.680]  news, they don't know what to do and again we already have in the aggregate more viewers
[54:36.680 --> 54:40.960]  and listeners than they do but the embarrassment of them refusing to cover it and then the control
[54:40.960 --> 54:48.320]  freaks seeing the President expose it and saying go to Project Veritas, look at this,
[54:48.320 --> 54:51.160]  see their all footage, they don't know what to do.
[54:51.160 --> 54:56.080]  Roger Stone can you speak to that and what I believe is the death of CNN, this is amazing
[54:56.080 --> 55:00.040]  just like they banned you for a year from CNN, your name even being said basically, now
[55:00.040 --> 55:03.280]  you're all over CNN, it just shows what failures they are.
[55:03.280 --> 55:08.640]  You're absolutely right, you see the President has the bully pulpit and he can direct American
[55:08.640 --> 55:14.280]  attention any place he cares to, in this case he showed them the very fine work of our mutual
[55:14.280 --> 55:21.800]  friend James O'Keefe at Project Veritas and O'Keefe nailed CNN, I say it again, CNN is
[55:21.800 --> 55:27.640]  not a news organization, it's a propaganda front, it's a mouthpiece for John Podesta
[55:27.640 --> 55:33.080]  and worse and they were so deeply invested in Hillary's election.
[55:33.080 --> 55:40.240]  Wolf Blitzer, the man he can't sleep, he literally falling apart in public, he is grinding his
[55:40.240 --> 55:45.120]  teeth over the success of Donald Trump in terms of turning this country around, from
[55:45.120 --> 55:50.640]  top to bottom the place is a disaster, now if I were the President, now is the ideal
[55:50.640 --> 55:55.960]  time to pull their White House press credentials, they're not a news organization, they don't
[55:55.960 --> 55:58.800]  qualify, that's my view.
[55:58.800 --> 56:04.360]  Absolutely, do the bold stroke, ban them and then every time they get caught, maybe suspend
[56:04.360 --> 56:09.600]  them for a month until they pledge to be a real news organization again, absolutely,
[56:09.600 --> 56:14.680]  okay Roger, I know you've got to get back to work, again we've got to get your contract
[56:14.680 --> 56:18.120]  done here, we've both been too busy but I'm getting that thing signed this week, we're
[56:18.120 --> 56:19.360]  going to have you full time.
[56:19.360 --> 56:26.040]  I'm very excited about coming on for my new show at InfoWars after July 1st, we're going
[56:26.040 --> 56:29.040]  to take it to a whole new level.
[56:29.040 --> 56:31.840]  This will be a day long on the member, we're going to see the end of the globalists, we're
[56:31.840 --> 56:37.720]  going to see the end of George Soros, Roger Stone in 60 seconds, any other tidbits?
[56:37.720 --> 56:44.040]  You know Alex, I think the President has really hit his stride here and I'm told that
[56:44.040 --> 56:50.480]  he is upbeat, that he is confident, that he is a bullion and I know he appreciates
[56:50.480 --> 56:56.920]  what's being reported here at InfoWars, so I salute you and again I tell your listeners,
[56:56.920 --> 56:59.800]  our listeners, victory or death.
[56:59.800 --> 57:03.240]  That's right to quote Colonel Travis, that's what's amazing though, like you said he's
[57:03.240 --> 57:08.240]  a counterpuncher, he plays nice, they pushed him and now he's just dominating, talk about
[57:08.240 --> 57:13.680]  luck, talk about gravitas, talk about the touch, Trump's got it, Roger thank you so
[57:13.680 --> 57:14.680]  much.
[57:14.680 --> 57:15.680]  Great to be here Alex.
[57:15.680 --> 57:20.000]  There goes Roger Stone of InfoWars, he's going to be doing a show here five days a week with
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.760]  us, co-hosting it with Owen Schreuer at night, David Knight's going to be on a couple of
[57:24.760 --> 57:28.040]  hours, I got to work with Ted, syndicate that, work with those folks, but I'm just a little
[57:28.040 --> 57:30.760]  bit behind here with all the stuff that's been going on, we're trying to hire more crew,
[57:30.760 --> 57:35.520]  a lot's happening here, speaking of that, a bunch of big guests coming up just briefly,
[57:35.520 --> 57:40.320]  we could finance ourselves so easily if we didn't have California standard on our vitamins
[57:40.320 --> 57:44.560]  and minerals and supplements, California standard is basically there's more lead in the air
[57:44.560 --> 57:48.120]  than you can have in your product, but we still do it, we test, we test, we test, until
[57:48.120 --> 57:51.680]  our products are California standards, I'm thinking about dropping that because it's
[57:51.680 --> 57:55.960]  bankrupting us at some point, but my CoZX folks, you've heard of probiotics, this is
[57:55.960 --> 58:01.880]  the anti fungus, anti yeast, we had the first run of this, it's got an average of 4.8 stars,
[58:01.880 --> 58:05.120]  it sold out in two weeks, I thought I had a six month supply, you never know what the
[58:05.120 --> 58:08.440]  folks are into, they demonized it, the media, that was part of it, they write these hit
[58:08.440 --> 58:12.480]  pieces and all their readers, especially liberals, one thing liberals know about is supplements,
[58:12.480 --> 58:15.920]  they know how good, the good ones are, I mean he'll be those who spot whole foods, but
[58:15.920 --> 58:19.600]  one thing his own publications attacked me for selling supplements, that's kind of weird.
[58:19.600 --> 58:24.680]  My CoZX is the next level probiotic, we've got it discounted out of the gates, 30% off
[58:24.680 --> 58:28.840]  when you get it, with our Biome Defense 50 billion live cultures, very best from our
[58:28.840 --> 58:35.280]  research probiotic out there, get them together, you owe it to yourself folks, infowarslife.com,
[58:35.280 --> 58:41.400]  My CoZX is back in another limited run, sold out for four or five months, I mean, wow,
[58:41.400 --> 58:49.680]  it helps find the operation you can't lose, visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:49.680 --> 58:53.120]  After being sold out for months, our best selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back
[58:53.120 --> 58:58.000]  in stock at infowarsstore.com, the first shipment of super blue sold out in one week, I thought
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.640]  it would be a six month supply for listeners, and since then people are beating down our
[59:01.640 --> 59:06.920]  doors wanting to be able to resupply their super blue, research across the board is clear,
[59:06.920 --> 59:11.480]  in fact it's certified, when bacteria infect your gums it can enter your bloodstream, and
[59:11.480 --> 59:15.480]  even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks, that's why the last surgeon general's report
[59:15.480 --> 59:20.400]  on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[59:20.400 --> 59:24.600]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula, it's loaded with good halogen
[59:24.600 --> 59:27.120]  iodide, so the bad halogen fluoride.
[59:27.120 --> 59:31.480]  Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out
[59:31.480 --> 59:36.000]  bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath, just some of the ingredients in super blue, chosen
[59:36.000 --> 59:41.720]  by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil, iodine, nano silver and more, learn more

[59:47.440 --> 59:51.840]  while you support healthy gums and teeth.
[59:51.840 --> 1:00:19.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:40.960]  I see you again, coming down fast, but a miles above you globalist, you may be a lover but
[1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:53.160]  you ain't no dancer.
[1:00:53.160 --> 1:01:01.680]  Coming down on you, the left thought they'd bring in Halter Skelter, that's a good joke.
[1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:08.120]  I've got loaded guests here today, but witnessing where we're witnessing right now to see the
[1:01:08.120 --> 1:01:13.160]  pendulum swinging back so hard towards prosperity and common sense, and actually track what
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:17.720]  Trump's doing, his only problem is they're holding up tax cuts that are needed to kick
[1:01:17.720 --> 1:01:22.760]  start the economy and complete the economic victory, which is so much prosperity, people
[1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:26.480]  just got to shut up and be successful and just shut up and have a great life and just
[1:01:26.480 --> 1:01:31.840]  stop trying to wreck everything, stop saying Venezuela and North Korea and then in Soviet
[1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:37.400]  Russia is the answer, no, no, bread lines and starvation is not the answer, no.
[1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:41.200]  The problem is then you become spoiled, so I kind of get the problem with the so much
[1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:45.240]  prosperity of the free market as myself included, you just can't help spoil your kids, you can't
[1:01:45.240 --> 1:01:46.240]  help spoil yourself.
[1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:48.400]  I mean, it's just, at least I know I'm spoiled.
[1:01:48.400 --> 1:01:51.360]  I mean, here are all the people bitching all day, where you can go have a minimum wage
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:55.400]  job and live with your friends and have a great life in all the parks and transportation
[1:01:55.400 --> 1:01:58.920]  and medicine and everything else, and then you're complaining when you've never been
[1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:04.280]  to one of these other countries and have no idea that it's just, it's a joke.
[1:02:04.280 --> 1:02:12.000]  The victimology of what everybody's got complaining is infantile and the way men won't take responsibility
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:17.600]  for things, the way they won't confront problems, the way they lie to themselves is if fiction's
[1:02:17.600 --> 1:02:23.600]  in their minds or reality, then they look at me and say, I'm giving you a fraud because
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:29.440]  I'm not, I'm giving you as close to unfiltered truth as you're going to get, it's a little
[1:02:29.440 --> 1:02:34.320]  bit craze, a little bit berserker, comes off as psychotic, but it's real.
[1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:37.960]  Now, look at the Daily Mail and I've got this clip, we're going to play this and go to break.
[1:02:37.960 --> 1:02:39.520]  I've got more of these coming up.
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:44.760]  Damn it, come on, you're inflaming everybody, Playboy's White House reporter Blast Trump
[1:02:44.760 --> 1:02:50.960]  to show how pathetic Playboy is with their adult captain at its helm, they think it's
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:57.620]  cool for Playboy to defend CNN, ooh, oh, how cool, can we go, you know, go to the Playboy
[1:02:57.620 --> 1:03:03.080]  mansion with rotting collapsing walls and, you know, meth heads running around, I mean
[1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:08.080]  just, I've been invited to the Playboy mansion, by the way, and you know what I said, no,
[1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:15.680]  no, no, no, no, no, I mean, you talk about the creepiest creepiest creepiest, but just
[1:03:15.680 --> 1:03:24.680]  imagine to the, oh, Playboy wants to ingratiate itself with, with zucker and CNN, oh, oh, you're
[1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:30.800]  outraging people, what are you doing, how dare you inflame people, President Trump saying
[1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:36.480]  the news is fake, that's dangerous, let us push towards war with Russia, let us lie,
[1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:41.440]  let us smear people and say everybody should be arrested, and then if you challenge that,
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:46.280]  you're the one, stop it, let me throw a temper tantrum, here's the clip.
[1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:53.480]  Make the slightest mistake, the slightest word is off, it is just an absolute tirade
[1:03:53.480 --> 1:04:01.640]  from a lot of people in this room, but news outlets get to go on day after day and cite
[1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:08.960]  unnamed sources, use stories without sources, have, you know, you mentioned the Scaramucci
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:11.760]  story where they had to have reporters resign.
[1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:17.760]  Come on, you're complaining everybody, I'm going to come back up with a little clip, imagine
[1:04:17.760 --> 1:04:21.120]  Scaramucci sitting for a hundred million, they admit it's totally fake, it's all on
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:26.960]  record to destroy him and his family and Trump, I've got lawyers saying I've got lawsuits,
[1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:34.200]  I mean they've said I'm commanding the Russians, I direct the Russians, I direct the Martians
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:39.560]  too in my off time, I mean this is so crazy, and they go, oh, come on, come on, don't do
[1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:43.520]  that to CNN, you know they put them up to it earlier, I'll have you all on the news,
[1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:48.720]  you know, kind of reboot, you heppers all doddling around, that sounds good, you know,
[1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:55.160]  have his reporter come in and kind of prop CNN up, if you put a bunch of dog turds together,
[1:04:55.160 --> 1:04:57.160]  nobody's propping anything up.
[1:04:57.160 --> 1:05:04.400]  M4's project announced the CNN is fake news contest, an expansion of the already successful
[1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:09.160]  CNN is ISIS contest, the contest is simple, $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with

[1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:18.640]  on TV with the CNN is fake news sign or t-shirt, it is also heard to say CNN is fake news

[1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:36.200]  from the criminal cabal controlling humanity in this fake news propaganda machine called
[1:05:36.200 --> 1:05:37.200]  CNN.
[1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:40.880]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which
[1:05:40.880 --> 1:05:45.560]  a CNN producer emitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas, we need to come together
[1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:50.080]  and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda thought up by multinational
[1:05:50.080 --> 1:05:54.040]  think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual thought and run humanity
[1:05:54.040 --> 1:05:55.040]  into a ditch.
[1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:59.560]  For more contest rules, visit info wars dot com four slash contest, this is Kit Daniels.

[1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:08.640]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:14.320]  to detoxify the body, that's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense

[1:06:28.480 --> 1:06:33.880]  a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier

[1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:08.360]  enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[1:07:08.360 --> 1:07:12.400]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern
[1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:16.760]  Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:22.080]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.720]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:40.000]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.720]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[1:07:42.720 --> 1:07:47.440]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[1:07:59.360 --> 1:08:13.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:08:13.840 --> 1:08:40.680]  It's going to happen with Trump.
[1:08:40.680 --> 1:08:51.560]  You know, we should probably come out of the bottom of the hour break when I saw the light
[1:08:51.560 --> 1:08:56.560]  because devastating the carbon tax pulling out of the climate accords, devastating the
[1:08:56.560 --> 1:09:02.720]  TPP, a decade in secret negotiation, the crown of fusing the Asian Union, the American Union
[1:09:02.720 --> 1:09:07.600]  and the European Union together was the trilateral Rockefeller plant.
[1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:13.280]  And to have all this collapsing the year David Rockefeller dies and Brzezinski, it's all
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:17.040]  the stuff of legend.
[1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:18.040]  And history does repeat.
[1:09:18.040 --> 1:09:19.040]  It also rhymes.
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:23.760]  Doug Hagman's riding shotgun with this great analyst, great reporter, law enforcement trainer,
[1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:26.040]  famous private detective researcher.
[1:09:26.040 --> 1:09:29.560]  He's the guy that came on first day before Eric Prince at Breitbart.
[1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:31.680]  And I'm very proud of the great work of Mr. Prince.
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:34.280]  I don't like what his sister does in the government so much, but whatever.
[1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:38.920]  Trying to start World War II with the Russians, but release the fact that Wiener was involved,
[1:09:38.920 --> 1:09:43.240]  reportedly procuring young women and sexting them.
[1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:48.080]  And of course, Hagman had the photos he even got from, let's just say, some folks there
[1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:50.320]  in the area, law enforcement.
[1:09:50.320 --> 1:09:51.920]  We broke that.
[1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:56.000]  So CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, they panicked.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  They go, what do we do?
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.520]  Well, Podesta and all of them go to this pizza place.
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:01.200]  David Brock's former boyfriends there.
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:02.960]  They have had fundraisers there.
[1:10:02.960 --> 1:10:04.260]  Let's go get on Reddit.
[1:10:04.260 --> 1:10:09.440]  Let's put a few seeds nobody was covering that have the news say, oh, it's not New York.
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:10.440]  It's not all this.
[1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:13.800]  It's this.
[1:10:13.800 --> 1:10:17.200]  And they focused in on the pizza place and then said that I said Hillary was killing
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:18.200]  kids in the basement.
[1:10:18.200 --> 1:10:20.400]  Someone never said, and I went, that's a trap.
[1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:21.960]  That's a diversion from all the real stuff.
[1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:24.480]  Then they go, oh, I made the story up and then I backed off.
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:25.640]  No, that's not what I said.
[1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:26.800]  That's why they're fake news, folks.
[1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:31.400]  I smelled their fake news from a trillion miles away and they took the fact that I diverted
[1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:36.880]  everybody from their lie back to the truth.
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:39.320]  They take that as if I capitulate.
[1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:44.560]  No, I simply pointed out to my crew and everybody else a month before they accused me of being
[1:10:44.560 --> 1:10:47.160]  the progenitor of it of saying, this is a honeypot.
[1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:48.160]  This is a decoy.
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:51.040]  This is a distraction.
[1:10:51.040 --> 1:10:54.520]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I don't claim to have all the answers, but I can smell this
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:10:55.520]  stuff.
[1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:56.520]  The problem is there's so much happening.
[1:10:56.520 --> 1:10:58.520]  I can't keep track of it anymore.
[1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:06.960]  But I told folks about a month ago, I'm not going to get into that.
[1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:10.560]  The point is, is that the gloves have been taken off and finally the president's listening
[1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:11.560]  to that.
[1:11:11.560 --> 1:11:15.040]  And the gloves are about to get taken off big time like we told you over a month ago.
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:18.160]  You're going to be very, very pleased.
[1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:19.600]  By the way, it's time to get certain of it, John.
[1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:23.080]  He had to wait a few days for he released his info from his sources very high up in
[1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:24.080]  the White House.
[1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:27.800]  He said, get back with him on Tuesday, I guess today's Wednesday.
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:31.960]  It's like Tuesday because I took off part of the day yesterday on my vacations or just
[1:11:31.960 --> 1:11:34.520]  coming up here and working on other stuff, not being on air.
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:37.280]  I really want to be on air.
[1:11:37.280 --> 1:11:40.600]  But certain of it is doing the fourth hour today, I'm told.
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:44.880]  And so he's going to have that big breaking exclusive news for you from his sources, which
[1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:45.880]  dovetail with mine beautifully.
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:48.360]  We'll be talking to Doug Hagman here in just a moment.
[1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:49.360]  But first let me get to these.
[1:11:49.360 --> 1:12:03.560]  I said I would, this is a Playboy reporter of that joke failed publication that got so
[1:12:03.560 --> 1:12:07.080]  liberal it said would no longer even have women scantily clad in it.
[1:12:07.080 --> 1:12:09.160]  That's the new level of liberalism.
[1:12:09.160 --> 1:12:10.160]  Come on.
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:11.160]  You're inflaming everybody.
[1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:15.240]  Playboy White House reporter blast Trump spokeswoman in clash over CNN's retracted fake
[1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:16.240]  news story.
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:17.240]  They did retract.
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:18.240]  It is fake.
[1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:19.320]  They're being sued for a hundred million.
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:24.640]  And scaramucci in the White House, it's all fraud.
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:28.920]  I talked to the White House about this six months ago when the president was first getting
[1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:33.560]  in office and they said, yeah, they want scaramucci out because he was at Davos, the president
[1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:38.280]  setting and Russians walked over at the bar and shook his hand.
[1:12:38.280 --> 1:12:40.640]  And of course, the CIA is there taking pictures.
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:41.640]  That's their big proof.
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:42.640]  And then CNN.
[1:12:42.640 --> 1:12:43.640]  Yeah, that's stuff.
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:44.640]  Nobody knows what I just released.
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:51.720]  CNN and completely just running rampant with all this insanity, trying to put me in prison
[1:12:51.720 --> 1:12:55.280]  because they're at a multinational corporate diplomatic function.
[1:12:55.280 --> 1:12:58.000]  But imagine this is all out and they're like, how dare you?
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  You're inflaming things.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:00.000]  Yeah.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  You want war with Russia.
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:02.400]  You want to bring the radical Muslims in.
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:03.400]  You want race war.
[1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:04.720]  You say kill the cops.
[1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:06.280]  All this social distortion.
[1:13:06.280 --> 1:13:11.160]  And then Trump simply says you're fake news and then it's his fault and some squawking
[1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:15.120]  tantrum throwing playboy reporter throws a fit.
[1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:16.640]  Here's the clip.
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:21.080]  If we make the slightest mistake, the slightest word is off.
[1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:27.120]  It is just an absolute tirade from a lot of people in this room.
[1:13:27.120 --> 1:13:35.440]  But news outlets get to go on day after day and cite unnamed sources, use stories without
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:41.960]  sources have, you know, you mentioned the Scaramucci story where they had to have reporters
[1:13:41.960 --> 1:13:42.960]  resign.
[1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:43.960]  Come on.
[1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:47.120]  You're inflaming everybody right here right now with those words.
[1:13:47.120 --> 1:13:49.520]  This administration has done that as well.
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:54.680]  Why in the name of heavens, any one of us, right, are replaceable and any one of us,
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:59.360]  if we don't get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or not
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:00.360]  read us.
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:03.520]  I think you have been elected to serve for four years at least.
[1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:05.520]  There's no option other than that.
[1:14:05.520 --> 1:14:09.720]  We're here to ask you questions, we're here to provide the answers and what you just did
[1:14:09.720 --> 1:14:14.680]  is inflammatory to people all over the country who look at it and say, see once again, the
[1:14:14.680 --> 1:14:17.680]  president is right and everybody else out here is fake media.
[1:14:17.680 --> 1:14:22.840]  And everybody in this room is only trying to do their job.
[1:14:22.840 --> 1:14:27.640]  You've got Acosta and others that admittedly say Trump didn't visit Scalice in the hospital,
[1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:31.800]  all these other fake stories constantly, so this is how they turn the tables.
[1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:35.320]  They've been caught lying, they're being sued, it's all coming out, they're having to admit
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:36.320]  it.
[1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:39.040]  They're on video saying, we put out fake news about Russia to destroy Trump.
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:46.560]  They're caught, they're top producers on tape, there's resignations, firings, CNN's collapsing.
[1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:52.840]  This guy gets up bitching and complaining like Trump did something with a big piece of gum
[1:14:52.840 --> 1:14:58.640]  in his mouth, talk about a hackloon, they'll probably make him the head of CNN now.
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:02.440]  Ha ha, hear me, let's finish the club, here it is.
[1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:08.320]  I disagree completely, first of all, I think if anything has been inflamed, it's the dishonesty
[1:15:08.320 --> 1:15:11.240]  that often takes place by the news media.
[1:15:11.240 --> 1:15:17.320]  And I think it is outrageous for you to accuse me of inflaming a story when I was simply
[1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:19.680]  trying to respond to his question.
[1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:23.360]  I've got more clips coming up as he rides shotgun with us, Doug Hagman of the Hagman
[1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:25.520]  Report, Hagman and Hagman.com.
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:29.600]  I always get you on and throw out all these issues, but what do you want to tackle first?
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:31.480]  What's on your radar screen, Mr. Hagman?
[1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:37.600]  Well, hey, thanks Alex for having me on after seeing that, perhaps I might have to ask Jim
[1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:40.720]  if he wants some cheese with his wine.
[1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:48.320]  It's just ridiculous at its face, that whole situation is ridiculous, but the bottom line,
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:54.080]  what I've found here is that sometimes we get lost in all of them minutiae, but we
[1:15:54.080 --> 1:15:58.560]  talk about it on a day-to-day basis, and sometimes we have to, at least in my view, take a step
[1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:04.280]  back and understand really how we got here, who the players are and where we are going.
[1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:09.080]  And I think that's kind of what I like to do, just kind of give a brief recap, but also
[1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:17.640]  let you know that obviously circuit news and others had come out with a verification that
[1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:22.040]  Andrew McCabe is under three separate investigations by the Senate and Department of Justice Inspector
[1:16:22.040 --> 1:16:23.040]  General's office.
[1:16:23.040 --> 1:16:28.400]  And I think this is key because as we look at what's taking place inside the Beltway,
[1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:33.440]  we got the McCabe under investigation, again, three separate investigations.
[1:16:33.440 --> 1:16:41.400]  You've got, as Matt Bracken, a friend of your program, has stated last night on our show,
[1:16:41.400 --> 1:16:48.880]  three swamp lawyers in the form of Mueller, Comey, and McCabe under the gun right now,
[1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:56.880]  or really facing the wrath of the Trump investigations under the Trump DOJ, which I think is going
[1:16:56.880 --> 1:16:59.880]  to be, according to my sources right now, is going to be, the tables are going to be
[1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:05.360]  turning against these swamp rats, against these swamp lawyers.
[1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:09.920]  And Mueller could very well find himself on the chopping block.
[1:17:09.920 --> 1:17:14.560]  This is the news I'm getting right now, regardless of the optics that might have, the Nixonian
[1:17:14.560 --> 1:17:21.080]  references and such, it could very well be where McCabe or Mueller could be taking over.
[1:17:21.080 --> 1:17:22.080]  Trump's no Nixon.
[1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:24.880]  The mainstream media was dominant in the 1970s.
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:27.160]  They are the enemy and hate it right now.
[1:17:27.160 --> 1:17:28.680]  They are worse than garbage.
[1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:29.680]  Indeed.
[1:17:29.680 --> 1:17:30.680]  Yeah.
[1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:35.560]  And we're also looking at, kind of lining up the players, everything right now is opposition
[1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:36.560]  research.
[1:17:36.560 --> 1:17:42.920]  And by the way, I came across your name in the, unmasking the intelligence here of late,
[1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:46.400]  or not of late, but, and I think you can, you might want to verify this with Mike Sertovich
[1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:52.680]  when he comes on, that people close to Obama had the authorization to unmask intelligence
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:57.440]  reports, Susan Rice, John Brennan and Loretta Lynch.
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:04.480]  And along with that, the surveillance of at the same time, or approximately the same time,
[1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:09.960]  the surveillance on key Trump allies ranging from General Flynn to Eric Prince to Sean
[1:18:09.960 --> 1:18:15.920]  Hannity, also included info wars yourself and others in the media.
[1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:22.520]  So Brennan was ordered, was the one who ordered Susan Rice to unmask those Trump allies.
[1:18:22.520 --> 1:18:26.360]  And I thought that was rather interesting in the timeline that we're seeing.
[1:18:26.360 --> 1:18:32.280]  So, but what we're seeing here is all of this opposition research, whether it's Fusion
[1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:38.920]  GPS, the author of the Trump dossier, and of course the company that hired, it was hired
[1:18:38.920 --> 1:18:44.640]  to dig up dirt on Mitt Romney back in 2012, in 2015 hired to investigate Planned Parenthood.
[1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:49.960]  And then of course, the author of the Trump dossier and the GPS, Fusion GPS was founded
[1:18:49.960 --> 1:18:54.760]  in 09 by three Wall Street Journal reporters, one with direct connections to the Hillary
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:57.480]  Rotem Clinton campaign.
[1:18:57.480 --> 1:19:01.080]  I think that we were looking at the opposition research there along with CrowdStrike and
[1:19:01.080 --> 1:19:02.080]  how they...
[1:19:02.080 --> 1:19:06.280]  And again, what they do is they make up pure whole cloth baloney, they don't actually
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:07.280]  do research.
[1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:15.680]  No, exactly, and this is what we're seeing, we're seeing the flaying of this opposition
[1:19:15.680 --> 1:19:20.360]  research material, much like the much discredited Trump dossier.
[1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:24.800]  Now we're seeing a lot of their investigative work product, investigative in quotes, coming
[1:19:24.800 --> 1:19:31.480]  out and being totally false and provably false and proven to be false.
[1:19:31.480 --> 1:19:33.680]  Now we're seeing the blowback from this.
[1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:38.760]  In all of this, the view from that cruising altitude, Alex, when you look at things, you
[1:19:38.760 --> 1:19:44.440]  can see how the moving parts, whether it's the South Rich homicide, the pedigate story,
[1:19:44.440 --> 1:19:50.720]  as you had mentioned, the surveillance, the unmasking, they're all working together.
[1:19:50.720 --> 1:19:52.720]  Then let's look at Big Picture when we come back.
[1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:57.400]  Do you concur that they're in full panic mode and in retreat, but are planning counterstrikes?
[1:19:57.400 --> 1:19:59.360]  We'll talk to Mr. Hagman straight ahead.
[1:19:59.360 --> 1:20:00.360]  It's a no-brainer.
[1:20:00.360 --> 1:20:02.600]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[1:20:02.600 --> 1:20:06.640]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA, and other
[1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:10.640]  endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses, and much more, right?
[1:20:10.640 --> 1:20:12.600]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon?

[1:20:29.160 --> 1:20:32.920]  Are you one of the 15 million men in the U.S. who suffer from an enlarged prostate, also
[1:20:32.920 --> 1:20:34.360]  known as BPH?
[1:20:34.360 --> 1:20:38.080]  If your life revolves around finding the closest bathroom, if you're tired of waking up many
[1:20:38.080 --> 1:20:42.000]  times at night to urinate, then you need to know about prostate miracle.

[1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:03.960]  One-third.
[1:21:03.960 --> 1:21:05.960]  There's already been riots across Europe.
[1:21:05.960 --> 1:21:06.960]  Is America next?
[1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:09.360]  Hi, I'm the owner of Infidel Body Armor.
[1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:13.800]  Over the past four years, I've sold thousands of body armor kits and trained hundreds of
[1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:14.800]  sheep dogs.
[1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:15.800]  They have prepared.
[1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:16.800]  Have you?
[1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:22.080]  I invite you to go to my website at infidelbodyarmor.com and click on specials.
[1:21:22.080 --> 1:21:23.080]  Trouble is coming.

[1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:30.240]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:33.520]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon.

[1:24:11.800 --> 1:24:14.240]  happening and the whole world's waking up.
[1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:19.360]  Coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play some video and get Mr. Hagman's take
[1:24:19.360 --> 1:24:20.360]  on it.
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:23.440]  It's HagmanReport.com, the name of the show is Hagman and Hagman, it does it with a son,
[1:24:23.440 --> 1:24:25.640]  but the website's HagmanReport.com.
[1:24:25.640 --> 1:24:31.080]  Our site's infowars.com and don't ever underestimate the power of you the listeners and viewers
[1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:37.880]  taking action, tweeting infowars.com, Facebooking it, Facebooking and tweeting the local radio
[1:24:37.880 --> 1:24:43.240]  station that you're listening to, telling folks at the grocery store about that local
[1:24:43.240 --> 1:24:48.600]  AM station or FM station you're listening to, tell folks about HagmanReport.com.
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:52.800]  This is a war, they've got artificial intelligence, they've got computers, but people are seeing
[1:24:52.800 --> 1:24:54.040]  through it.
[1:24:54.040 --> 1:24:59.360]  This shine when they're under attack and just because a lot of people are liberal zombies
[1:24:59.360 --> 1:25:01.520]  doesn't mean they can't be woken up.
[1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:05.560]  I agree they're saying kill us and a lot of them are horrible people, but maybe one out
[1:25:05.560 --> 1:25:09.160]  of a hundred liberals is actually a brain bug, one that knows they're evil and knows what
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:10.160]  they're doing.
[1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:14.080]  Most of them are arrested development mental patients and I say that lovingly, but they
[1:25:14.080 --> 1:25:15.760]  have to admit that they're in a cult.
[1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:20.160]  We'll talk about that with Doug Hagman coming up in the short segment Doug.
[1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:24.040]  Give me the 30,000 foot view, then give me the 5,000 foot view, then give me the on the
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:27.720]  ground view from, I know you've got amazing sources, the state police in both New York
[1:25:27.720 --> 1:25:32.120]  and in New Jersey with their great intel and also the FBI.
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:36.880]  But the word I've got is the entire intelligence agencies, the government, everything knows
[1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:39.840]  that the globalists were going to try to kill the country, knows they were going to try
[1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:44.480]  to basically merge us with Islam, understood how horrible the end game was and all these
[1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:48.400]  folks aren't perfect, they just aren't signing on to the end of prosperity.
[1:25:48.400 --> 1:25:53.640]  I think the globalist biggest failure is they want to sell austerity and the average person
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:55.840]  implementing it's going to end up poor too.
[1:25:55.840 --> 1:25:58.280]  Why would anybody get on board with this?
[1:25:58.280 --> 1:26:03.160]  Well, it's that thought that, hey, it's not going to affect me.
[1:26:03.160 --> 1:26:07.080]  You know, I've got mine too bad for you kind of thing, kind of mentality.
[1:26:07.080 --> 1:26:11.960]  And I think that that's the big lie that we're being fed or the American people are being
[1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:12.960]  fed.
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:18.040]  When you asked about the larger view, I would say this, the closer that we are all getting
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:24.200]  you're getting, everyone is getting to the truth with respect to really what the war
[1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:30.720]  against Donald Trump, the war against the people who care about this country.
[1:26:30.720 --> 1:26:32.800]  Why is the deep state so scared?
[1:26:32.800 --> 1:26:34.320]  What do they have buried?
[1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:37.080]  Well, there's a lot of things.
[1:26:37.080 --> 1:26:43.520]  One of the golden threads is the, and I'll bring this up, it's uncomfortable to talk
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:47.440]  about it is the human and child sex trade.
[1:26:47.440 --> 1:26:52.840]  It is huge when you take a look at it, given the fact that there are rat lines all across
[1:26:52.840 --> 1:27:00.400]  Northern Africa into Saudi Arabia into Europe and such.
[1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:06.080]  You've got drugs, money, all these rat lines, but the currency right now exposed all that.
[1:27:06.080 --> 1:27:08.840]  She said, my God, it's child trafficking, everything.
[1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:09.840]  Yeah.
[1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:14.800]  And that's kind of the currency of the elite that that's that's kind of what the that's
[1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:17.400]  the golden thread that runs through all the art and gold.
[1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:19.280]  Now, it's children.
[1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:20.840]  And unfortunately, it is.
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:27.840]  And that, you know, the, the emails that were discussed about Podesta and such, all part
[1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:28.840]  of this.
[1:27:28.840 --> 1:27:32.800]  But when we get too close to this, and we've seen this happen, you get too close to this.
[1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:33.800]  What's the blowback?
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:36.680]  The blowback is going to be on an international level.
[1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:39.200]  I do believe in the crosshairs.
[1:27:39.200 --> 1:27:44.720]  And I think this is going to be based on my sources, a couple of sources within DC saying,
[1:27:44.720 --> 1:27:49.040]  look, we pushed too hard on this or they pushed too hard on this, you're going to see something
[1:27:49.040 --> 1:27:50.040]  happen in Syria.
[1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:53.920]  You're going to see an international incident, a false flag type thing in Syria and in engagement
[1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:58.880]  with Russia because yesterday, the final kill switch, they've got the dead man switches
[1:27:58.880 --> 1:27:59.880]  World War three.
[1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:02.440]  Just like the EU, they're trying to get out of it 10 years ago.
[1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:06.640]  And the EU minister said, we will have, we will start a war if you don't do this.
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:08.040]  Exactly.
[1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:14.360]  And it's better to deflect with an international conflict or a war than to be exposed to
[1:28:14.360 --> 1:28:16.040]  domestically here.
[1:28:16.040 --> 1:28:19.520]  So take it international when we're in trouble domestically, and I think that's what we're
[1:28:19.520 --> 1:28:20.520]  seeing right now.
[1:28:20.520 --> 1:28:22.040]  At least that's what I'm being told.
[1:28:22.040 --> 1:28:26.360]  And I think that when you take a look at the players here and at the epicenter of this
[1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:31.120]  whole game, when you look down upon this and you see all the moving parts, you see the
[1:28:31.120 --> 1:28:35.200]  Hillary Clinton, the Bill Clinton Foundation, you see the same people that were in the Clinton
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:39.480]  White House, the opposition doing opposition research for the Clinton White House involved
[1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:40.960]  in fusion GPS.
[1:28:40.960 --> 1:28:49.600]  You see the DNC, the same players in the DNC involved in changing the vote counts and messing
[1:28:49.600 --> 1:28:55.920]  with the voter jury mattering, we'll say, then of course, enter Seth Rich, the Seth
[1:28:55.920 --> 1:28:57.200]  Rich homicide.
[1:28:57.200 --> 1:29:00.520]  People get too close to that.
[1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:05.880]  We're looking at a number of possibilities, a number of different options by the globalist
[1:29:05.880 --> 1:29:09.120]  to shut up those people who want to uncover the truth.
[1:29:09.120 --> 1:29:13.360]  And the blowback is going to be severe to those of us who are trying to expose this.
[1:29:13.360 --> 1:29:18.400]  So the Empire Strikes Back is start a war, have hit teams, kill some journalists to shut
[1:29:18.400 --> 1:29:19.400]  folks up?
[1:29:19.400 --> 1:29:21.360]  Well, I have no doubt.
[1:29:21.360 --> 1:29:26.200]  Kill journalists or just make it so uncomfortable or just pull the...
[1:29:26.200 --> 1:29:27.200]  They're already trying that, though.
[1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:28.200]  I love it.
[1:29:28.200 --> 1:29:29.200]  Yeah.
[1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:31.200]  I agree with you.
[1:29:31.200 --> 1:29:36.360]  Because don't they get the universe as a two-way street?
[1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:40.960]  Well, I think there's that God complex in their heads.
[1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:42.760]  They literally, they believe that they can...
[1:29:42.760 --> 1:29:46.400]  Yeah, what is it about psychopaths and pedophiles they think they're invincible, even when you're
[1:29:46.400 --> 1:29:48.680]  strangle on them?
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:56.200]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:56.200 --> 1:30:08.840]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:37.040]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run, the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:37.040 --> 1:30:40.960]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which
[1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:44.840]  a CNN producer omitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[1:30:44.840 --> 1:30:49.000]  We need to come together and remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda
[1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:52.960]  thought of by multinational think tanks that has been fed to the public to suppress individual
[1:30:52.960 --> 1:30:54.760]  thought and run humanity into a ditch.

[1:34:04.280 --> 1:34:08.400]  wants prosperity, he's not trying to make you poor, he doesn't want to sexualize children,
[1:34:08.400 --> 1:34:12.640]  he doesn't want to break up families, he doesn't want to screw veterans over, he's not a bad
[1:34:12.640 --> 1:34:13.640]  guy.
[1:34:13.640 --> 1:34:19.440]  America is back, that is powerful, you know, I'm going to get that image in HD, my buddy
[1:34:19.440 --> 1:34:24.440]  just sent me a screenshot of it, I'm going to put that behind me, that's powerful.
[1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:28.720]  Another image, we were just online looking at getting images, which we subscribe to,
[1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:37.320]  we can use it, is the giant migrant boats who aren't even Libyan, just pouring through
[1:34:37.320 --> 1:34:43.240]  Africa as a new business that the Caliphate runs, hundreds of thousands every few months,
[1:34:43.240 --> 1:34:48.120]  of North Africans just pouring in and there's not a woman amongst them, this is the children
[1:34:48.120 --> 1:34:55.040]  and the refugees and these are economic migrants, the population is just exploding in Africa,
[1:34:55.040 --> 1:34:59.680]  exploding in Asia, exploding everywhere, going towards 10 billion in the next decade, we're
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:03.680]  at almost 8 billion right now and the thing is, these migrants get here and then they're
[1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:07.680]  weaponized by the liberal media and by the Soros groups that actually fund them to bring
[1:35:07.680 --> 1:35:12.760]  them in, so now even NATO's got involved, shuttling them in, they just get a few miles
[1:35:12.760 --> 1:35:18.360]  off the coast, in their rafts, there's Zodiacs and they get into the other boats and it's
[1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:23.560]  a shuttling service, this main invasion force, we'll get Doug Hagman's take on that but that's
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:27.440]  why you're seeing movement against this in our governments, is because this is the planned
[1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:33.280]  implosion of not just the third world but the first world as well, briefly, this has
[1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:43.160]  been sold out since January and we come out with new products and I produce 10,000 bottles
[1:35:43.160 --> 1:35:47.600]  of something and that's a big run, that'll last 6 months and it's sold out in a week
[1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:53.200]  and a half, 2 weeks, Myco ZX is the next level probiotic, we have bomb defense, 50,000 live
[1:35:53.200 --> 1:35:56.640]  cultures, the very best strains out there, we keep it air conditioned here, ship it to
[1:35:56.640 --> 1:36:00.560]  you, cooled but Myco ZX doesn't need to be air conditioned, doesn't need to be kept
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:07.280]  at 55 degrees or whatever, it is, known compounds that are totally natural and organic to support
[1:36:07.280 --> 1:36:12.240]  normal fungal and yeast balance in your gut, preparatory blend of herbs and enzymes, maybe
[1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:16.640]  the highest quality ingredients, ladies and gentlemen, the media is demonizing me for
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:21.960]  selling probiotics, I love it, everyone knows probiotics, Bill Gates is the main investor
[1:36:21.960 --> 1:36:26.480]  now in these new probiotics coming out, not with us but medical level probiotics because
[1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:33.320]  all the pesticide that bio accumulates inside the food gets in your gut and then kills the
[1:36:33.320 --> 1:36:41.280]  good flora and then mutated bacteria, yeast and moles and funguses fill that, that's known
[1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:46.600]  in mainline literature and so we're like, yeah, let's come out with the very best probiotic,
[1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:51.760]  Dr. Ruben is spending a decade trying to finally get it just right, he has it, it's amazing,
[1:36:51.760 --> 1:36:54.600]  I mean I have people that work in this building, a lot of them who are in the military, eating
[1:36:54.600 --> 1:36:59.480]  that horrible food for years, irritable bowel, you know, all sorts of gut disorders are off
[1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:05.880]  the chart, I said take a probiotic for a month, here take our brand, Tanger Life, I said now
[1:37:05.880 --> 1:37:12.120]  take it three times a day, the media says I'm evil but I want to sell you a swindle
[1:37:12.120 --> 1:37:16.840]  with no proof as the nation says, why would I want to sell you something that doesn't
[1:37:16.840 --> 1:37:21.160]  work, I want you to buy it again and again and again because I take it, I treat you like
[1:37:21.160 --> 1:37:24.880]  I want to be treated and it's like so alien to the leftist who are such predators and
[1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:29.000]  psychopaths and control freaks and study how to manipulate people because they're such
[1:37:29.000 --> 1:37:37.720]  cowards and filth, that's not who I am, I'm not you, I'm not Eric Alterman or whatever
[1:37:37.720 --> 1:37:47.160]  his name is at the foundation funded, you know, failed joke organization, the nation,
[1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:52.760]  I mean, I set out to have the best sleep aid and I said why am I buying two or three bottles
[1:37:52.760 --> 1:37:56.280]  when I do need to take this to sleep because L-triptophan doesn't work unless you take
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:38:00.120]  it with melatonin, if you take valerian root and I found a kind of combo and these up will
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:04.120]  make you sleep like you're dead, if I'm all wound up and stuff and you know, been working
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:08.560]  at 18 hours and can't go to sleep, had too much coffee, melatonin works a little bit
[1:38:08.560 --> 1:38:12.040]  but if I mix it with L-triptophan it would work better, I thought well wait a minute
[1:38:12.040 --> 1:38:20.600]  it's $19 for a low dosage of melatonin but I happen to know it probably cost him a dollar
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:24.840]  to put it in the bottle, why don't I just put nine ingredients in then it costs us like
[1:38:24.840 --> 1:38:31.920]  six, seven bucks and sell it for $19.95 and it blows everything else out there away, knockout,
[1:38:31.920 --> 1:38:38.880]  it's got a lemon balm, chamomile, the L-triptophan, that's what's in the turkey, it's got the
[1:38:38.880 --> 1:38:45.560]  melatonin, the valerian root and it's amazing, it's absolutely amazing, there's an example
[1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:50.560]  of what I'm talking about and they demonize that but here's the bottom line, the all new
[1:38:50.560 --> 1:38:55.880]  Micro ZX sold out in his first shipment in Christmas into January, it's taken almost
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:38:59.800]  six months to get more because it's so hard to source the ingredients that are in it,
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:07.320]  go read about it at m4warslife.com, believe me this is not where you have planned scarcity
[1:39:07.320 --> 1:39:12.160]  so then it's the hot Christmas toy where they have a story by a PR firm, oh this toy sold
[1:39:12.160 --> 1:39:17.400]  out and everybody wants it, this has been sold out for almost six months and it'd be
[1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:20.640]  probably one of our best sellers and we can keep it in but again it's hard to source all
[1:39:20.640 --> 1:39:24.840]  this and have it be California standards but we do it, we know we're a target, I really
[1:39:24.840 --> 1:39:30.680]  think it's a gimmick, I mean there's more lead in the air than there is under California
[1:39:30.680 --> 1:39:34.480]  standards but somehow we're able to pass it by throwing out so much, going through so
[1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:38.440]  many buys and going through the right companies but that's why some of those were sold out
[1:39:38.440 --> 1:39:39.440]  for a while.
[1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:45.280]  It's back in today, I'm excited to announce the limited shipment of Micro ZX has finally

[1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:24.440]  selling out a lot of them so I'm not going to sell out I'm going to hold back a little
[1:41:24.440 --> 1:41:27.920]  bit at regular price until more comes in so if you want to take advantage of that do it
[1:41:27.920 --> 1:41:33.720]  now now shifting gears Hagman Doug Hagman of Hagman report.com investigative journalist
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:40.760]  law enforcement trainer just a great source of information he's joining us to break down
[1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:44.520]  how he's saying they're getting ready to try to strike back at the new media strike back
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:49.880]  at Trump having big victories but we have to be ready for they had their offensive we
[1:41:49.880 --> 1:41:55.160]  had their counteroffensive now they're desperate counter strike they've intensified their lies
[1:41:55.160 --> 1:42:00.000]  their hysteria their calls for violence in July the Soros group has doubled any previous
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:05.800]  funding for the cop killing groups Hagman what do you expect oh it's going to be it's
[1:42:05.800 --> 1:42:11.000]  going to be an interesting summer to say the least but but Alex if I made you just deviate
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:16.520]  from the topic just for a second you were talking about your gut health protocol the
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:22.360]  reason my schedule your schedule didn't sync up by this month my wife was taken to the
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:28.080]  house my wife was just a health nut it can run circles around me was taken to the hospital
[1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:33.120]  on May 30th had emergency surgery at three o'clock in the morning and long story short
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:37.000]  I'm not going to get into big I didn't know that sorry to hear that yeah and then no worries
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:43.160]  I mean she's fine now she had emergency surgery but it was it was a it was an intestinal issue
[1:42:43.160 --> 1:42:50.200]  that was related to exactly what you were talking about with respect to you know intestinal
[1:42:50.200 --> 1:42:57.400]  health it had and she she had no problem any any other time before before that just suddenly
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:03.400]  stomach pains and it was all over the literature that mammals bats are dying they're finding
[1:43:03.400 --> 1:43:09.720]  just guts are just full of basically mutated yeast and fungus that is mutated because of
[1:43:09.720 --> 1:43:14.760]  all the pesticides are eating and it's just eating the guts basically and that's exactly
[1:43:14.760 --> 1:43:21.240]  what's one of the naturopathic doctors that we that she sees said look the whole problem
[1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:28.640]  stemmed from years upon years of the polluted food basically but I just just as and thank
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:35.120]  you for doing that because I have to say that people if they do what you recommend perhaps
[1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:39.640]  they won't have to go through emergency surgery and have all those problems so thank you for
[1:43:39.640 --> 1:43:44.200]  having no thank you we just come up with whatever we're using whatever there's in the big fancy
[1:43:44.200 --> 1:43:48.200]  clinics the elites are doing we try to then produce it ourselves and bring it to the general public
[1:43:48.200 --> 1:43:53.160]  because the elites if you research just bill gates and gut health he's putting his main funding
[1:43:53.160 --> 1:43:57.720]  into that because they know that's the big crisis that's the way they're going to quote make all
[1:43:57.720 --> 1:44:03.000]  their money is with thousand dollar drugs and surgeries and things and gut vaccines instead
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:07.000]  of just introducing things that have already been killed back into our stomachs it's very
[1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:12.520]  simple there's pesticide the food it's killing the normal bacteria the mutagens are there and
[1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:16.600]  there's known herbs and things that are known to knock out the mutagens and I'm not giving advice
[1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:21.800]  here that's my own research thank you for the support though well they no worries at all
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:28.360]  but to answer your question to get back on topic here look the the and I do believe this to be
[1:44:28.360 --> 1:44:34.040]  the case people are asking and have been asking me and perhaps they've been asking you what happened
[1:44:34.040 --> 1:44:41.160]  to the the emails the Huma Abedin the Anthony Weiner emails what happened to that investigation
[1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:48.120]  I based on the recent and I mean within the last 72 hours of information from my source look
[1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:53.960]  according to what they're saying is some of the things that we have seen with respect to raids
[1:44:53.960 --> 1:45:02.840]  a raid for example in Detroit of a house connected to the Muslim brotherhood was a art it was an
[1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:11.880]  artifact or got some collateral information from the information taken from the Huma Abedin slash
[1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:17.800]  and again you with your sources broke and broke mainstream that you know the day after that the
[1:45:17.800 --> 1:45:22.440]  emails and the sexting and all of that and of course he's tied into Muslim brotherhood the
[1:45:22.440 --> 1:45:27.240]  Wahhabist that's why there's this alliance with Islam is that it's got pedophilia rampant in it
[1:45:27.240 --> 1:45:34.840]  that exactly and and if I'm not mistaken and I could be wrong on this I have not verified
[1:45:34.840 --> 1:45:40.840]  this through my additional source but you've got some alleged movement of Jeffrey Epstein
[1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:46.520]  into some of the Arab countries Saudi Arabia UAE guitar now that was confirmed with Bill Clinton
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:52.200]  he flew to a known sheik has admitted pedophile okay all right well I'm interested in the cargo
[1:45:52.200 --> 1:45:56.120]  on that on that aircraft right now according to the information I'm beginning so that that's
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:46:02.440]  just I'm tossing that out there but the investigation is far from over the payback and I think people
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:09.400]  underestimate Donald Trump they look at the tweets and they believe it to be some type of
[1:46:09.400 --> 1:46:14.280]  mental Tourette syndrome you know the middle of the night I think I'm just gonna tweet this out
[1:46:15.080 --> 1:46:21.160]  based on everything I've heard these are very calculated tweets to to really mess with the
[1:46:21.160 --> 1:46:26.680]  heads of those people who are attempting to take him down and and there's a lot of mistakes being
[1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:32.680]  caused because of the underestimation look at how he bluffed comey with the tape stuff and then
[1:46:32.680 --> 1:46:38.760]  comey had to come out admit okay nobody ever tried to get me to you know obstruct justice blah blah
[1:46:38.760 --> 1:46:45.400]  blah countervailing his fake memo that's right now it's my understanding as well there will be
[1:46:45.400 --> 1:46:52.600]  another in air quotes bombshell coming out against Donald against Donald Trump by the
[1:46:53.400 --> 1:47:03.240]  corporate media and by the the deep state they are they are now I'm not exactly 100
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:08.280]  percent sure what that is I have been able to determine that but there's something coming out
[1:47:08.280 --> 1:47:13.800]  that's going to be extremely damaging to Donald Trump whether it's going to be relative to Jared
[1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:21.800]  Kushner or some other potential opening I'm not sure but watch for that between now and well
[1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:27.880]  even perhaps with the Friday dump I don't know to let it stew over the weekend that's supposedly
[1:47:27.880 --> 1:47:34.440]  coming out but the but but Donald Trump has been advised according to my source on this
[1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:41.000]  and there will be a pushback a pushback like you've never seen with specifically with the
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:46.280]  senate intelligence committee as well as the inspector general of the doj looking at lynch
[1:47:46.280 --> 1:47:51.480]  and looking at comey and well that's the word I got is that Trump knows the gloves are off against
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:55.080]  him with made-up crap so he just goes go ahead gloves are off on them he needs to hit them
[1:47:55.080 --> 1:48:01.560]  early not later like nixon did exactly yeah now this this really has now it's a race to indict
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:07.720]  here it is and who's going to be the first to be indicted and how many more after that and which
[1:48:07.720 --> 1:48:12.280]  side's gonna you know act first and that's the question that we're looking at right now but
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:16.120]  I think Donald Trump has the upper hand on this across the board well yeah I mean I know people
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:20.360]  that know him well I mean the guy is super good he tissues I mean all he eats is like ice cream
[1:48:20.360 --> 1:48:26.280]  and cake that's his guilty pleasure two scoops but yeah yeah it's it's really he gets two scoops and
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:35.720]  you don't yeah that's the narrative right of course um yeah paging Jim Acosta you know yeah
[1:48:35.720 --> 1:48:42.600]  back when I had ice cream it's like five scoops you're watching tv get the whole well I mean
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:48.360]  look at me you know I you get all like they lost a lot of weight look great well thanks man as you
[1:48:48.360 --> 1:48:56.200]  do too but you know it's this right now with respect to uh uh the uh doing the autopsy on what
[1:48:56.200 --> 1:49:01.960]  has happened uh the post mortem of the Hillary campaign and that's still going on by the way
[1:49:01.960 --> 1:49:08.280]  I just called this segment for YouTube the the post mortem on the democrat so it's funny
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:14.360]  that you just said what I just told him the segment was called wow okay yes so applicable indeed
[1:49:14.360 --> 1:49:20.680]  but when one does the post mortem or when it looks at the uh the the fruits of the post mortem
[1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:26.840]  I think you're gonna find the fingerprints of Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton of course on the uh
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:31.320]  on all of the opposition research they were totally arrogant they'd rigged everything they
[1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:36.840]  thought they were invincible you're just saying everything in WikiLeaks but even worse and exactly
[1:49:36.840 --> 1:49:43.320]  even worse perhaps is the operative uh phrase here and and look toward some of the minor players to
[1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:48.440]  turn states evidence especially when they get before the senate and that's why they seem so arrogant
[1:49:48.440 --> 1:49:53.560]  and confident it's not confidence it's reckless cornered rat behavior there you there there you go
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:58.200]  yep exactly and I don't want to see and to those people listening if it seems like well this is
[1:49:58.200 --> 1:50:02.200]  old news there's you know you're just rehashing it look what the mainstream media does with respect
[1:50:02.200 --> 1:50:06.280]  to the russian narrative sometimes you know we have to pull back well this takes time to develop
[1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:10.520]  the stuff this is all happening now because they've got fear in their eyes now where do you expect
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:15.720]  them to go now that they're totally hysterical well again I think that one of the big issues
[1:50:15.720 --> 1:50:20.040]  is going to be some some international event including but not limited to Syria I think that
[1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:24.760]  they're going to have to uh to do something with respect to Russia I think that the neocons
[1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:31.320]  that never trumpers they're the real problem it's very much so I think they've been drooling for a
[1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:35.880]  conflict a world conflict Russia of course let's be clear the democrats are knocked out of the game
[1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:40.760]  becoming a coastal party but the but the but we still have to face the republican establishment
[1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:45.240]  that's just as bad and I agree you see them you see nicky hailey saying any other events in
[1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:49.880]  Syria we're blaming in on Russia well that's a green light for the rebels to launch a false flag

[1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:33.560]  It's a plate of star and gauges
[1:54:33.560 --> 1:54:35.560]  And the days of ancient Greece
[1:54:35.560 --> 1:54:37.560]  Walked down through the middle ages
[1:54:37.560 --> 1:54:39.560]  Planet Earth kept going through changes
[1:54:39.560 --> 1:54:41.560]  And in those winter-sized caves
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:43.560]  The times continued to change
[1:54:43.560 --> 1:54:45.560]  But they were always winnig
[1:54:45.560 --> 1:54:47.560]  It's like you sit in a pool
[1:54:47.560 --> 1:54:48.560]  Tom Paine, there's a marshal
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:49.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:52.560]  Doug Hagman's our guest for one more segment.
[1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:53.560]  I'm James Leslie Rawls,
[1:54:53.560 --> 1:54:55.560]  popping in to give us his view on the world.
[1:54:55.560 --> 1:54:57.560]  I intend a lot of days this week to open the phones up,
[1:54:57.560 --> 1:54:59.560]  but not so far today.
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:02.560]  We may have some time to open the phones up at 1.30
[1:55:02.560 --> 1:55:03.560]  here in about an hour from now,
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:05.560]  about an hour and five minutes from now.
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:07.560]  I've been running around during the breaks,
[1:55:07.560 --> 1:55:09.560]  working on other news, a bunch of other clips.
[1:55:09.560 --> 1:55:11.560]  You have a new Project Veritas video they've released.
[1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:13.560]  A Van Jones admitting it's all a big nothing burger.
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:15.560]  Russia Gates made up.
[1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:17.560]  We know that it's the Democrats
[1:55:17.560 --> 1:55:19.560]  historically in bed with Russia.
[1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:21.560]  And I'm not a Russaphobe.
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:22.560]  They're not communists now.
[1:55:22.560 --> 1:55:24.560]  Hollywood hates them because they're becoming Christian.
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:26.560]  But foreign governments are involved
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:29.560]  in lobbying.
[1:55:29.560 --> 1:55:31.560]  China is literally
[1:55:31.560 --> 1:55:33.560]  20 times more involved.
[1:55:33.560 --> 1:55:35.560]  But you use way more involved than Russia.
[1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:37.560]  Russia is a
[1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:39.560]  mid-level player, folks.
[1:55:39.560 --> 1:55:41.560]  All they've got is energy.
[1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:43.560]  And they've got some high-tech stuff.
[1:55:43.560 --> 1:55:45.560]  But Trump, if you look at what he's doing,
[1:55:45.560 --> 1:55:47.560]  bringing us back as a dominant energy exporter
[1:55:47.560 --> 1:55:49.560]  is really hurting Russia.
[1:55:49.560 --> 1:55:51.560]  And
[1:55:51.560 --> 1:55:53.560]  Russia is not even really mad about that
[1:55:53.560 --> 1:55:55.560]  because they understand Trump's against the carbon taxes.
[1:55:55.560 --> 1:55:56.560]  So is Russia.
[1:55:56.560 --> 1:55:58.560]  I mean, I really don't find a lot of fault with Russia
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:00.560]  because I've studied what they're doing,
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:02.560]  and they're not offensively meddling
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:03.560]  or trying to take my rights.
[1:56:03.560 --> 1:56:05.560]  It's towards Soros and the globalists are doing that.
[1:56:05.560 --> 1:56:07.560]  Doug Hagman, is that an accurate statement?
[1:56:07.560 --> 1:56:09.560]  You know,
[1:56:09.560 --> 1:56:11.560]  yeah,
[1:56:11.560 --> 1:56:13.560]  this whole
[1:56:13.560 --> 1:56:15.560]  Russian narrative
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:17.560]  issue has just been
[1:56:17.560 --> 1:56:19.560]  pounded
[1:56:19.560 --> 1:56:21.560]  ad nauseam.
[1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:23.560]  It's losing its esteem.
[1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:25.560]  And of course, with the second release
[1:56:25.560 --> 1:56:27.560]  or with the release of part two from
[1:56:27.560 --> 1:56:29.560]  Project Veritas, Van Jones,
[1:56:29.560 --> 1:56:31.560]  explain his
[1:56:31.560 --> 1:56:33.560]  comment, you're going to see
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:35.560]  this rush for the exits
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:37.560]  by the mainstream media, by the corporate media.
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:39.560]  And I think this is part,
[1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:41.560]  this makes it very dangerous, and he pointed this out.
[1:56:41.560 --> 1:56:43.560]  And I think everyone should really understand this.
[1:56:43.560 --> 1:56:45.560]  When they're cornered rats
[1:56:45.560 --> 1:56:47.560]  or when they're looking for the exits,
[1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:49.560]  this is when bad things happen.
[1:56:49.560 --> 1:56:51.560]  And I would really, really caution everyone
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:53.560]  to
[1:56:53.560 --> 1:56:55.560]  really pay attention to current events,
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:57.560]  to what's taking place around them.
[1:56:57.560 --> 1:56:59.560]  And the only other thing I really
[1:56:59.560 --> 1:57:01.560]  want to close with very strongly
[1:57:01.560 --> 1:57:03.560]  is I think you're going to see
[1:57:03.560 --> 1:57:05.560]  key people
[1:57:05.560 --> 1:57:07.560]  getting lawyers, criminal defense
[1:57:07.560 --> 1:57:09.560]  attorneys
[1:57:09.560 --> 1:57:11.560]  in anticipation of having to testify
[1:57:11.560 --> 1:57:13.560]  before the various intelligence committees
[1:57:13.560 --> 1:57:15.560]  as well as the investigations
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:17.560]  that are opening up, including but
[1:57:17.560 --> 1:57:19.560]  not limited to Andrew McCabe
[1:57:19.560 --> 1:57:21.560]  and others. And I think that you're going to see
[1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:23.560]  some movement as well. By Donald
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:25.560]  Trump, he's going to make some definitive
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:27.560]  moves to close up,
[1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:29.560]  close ranks.
[1:57:29.560 --> 1:57:31.560]  I was about to say, I'm not a police state guy,
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:33.560]  I'm not against the police, I'm against a police state
[1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:35.560]  like Venezuela.
[1:57:35.560 --> 1:57:37.560]  And the media tries to confuse that, like I hate cops.
[1:57:37.560 --> 1:57:39.560]  No, I hate bad government controlling the police.
[1:57:39.560 --> 1:57:41.560]  But I don't want an offensive
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:43.560]  around these people up, but if they're far
[1:57:43.560 --> 1:57:45.560]  and funded trying to kill the president,
[1:57:45.560 --> 1:57:47.560]  trying to overthrow things, trying to have blood
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:49.560]  on the street, we have a responsibility
[1:57:49.560 --> 1:57:51.560]  to move against them when they're involved
[1:57:51.560 --> 1:57:53.560]  in open racketeering. I want to go to break through
[1:57:53.560 --> 1:57:55.560]  five more minutes, I know you have to go.
[1:57:55.560 --> 1:57:57.560]  I want to ask you about that and how we stopped
[1:57:57.560 --> 1:57:59.560]  the Civil War that they've already basically
[1:57:59.560 --> 1:58:01.560]  started. That's coming up here in just a moment, but let's go
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:03.560]  out to break with Van Jones. Here's Van Jones
[1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:05.560]  on the Nothing Burger.
[1:58:07.560 --> 1:58:09.560]  Today we continue with our American
[1:58:09.560 --> 1:58:11.560]  Project Investigations inside America's
[1:58:11.560 --> 1:58:13.560]  mainstream media with Part 2
[1:58:13.560 --> 1:58:15.560]  on CNN.
[1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:17.560]  Fake news.
[1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:19.560]  The Russia story.
[1:58:19.560 --> 1:58:21.560]  You're about to see one of CNN's most prominent
[1:58:21.560 --> 1:58:23.560]  left-leaning political commentators
[1:58:23.560 --> 1:58:25.560]  in total agreement with President Trump.
[1:58:25.560 --> 1:58:27.560]  I think this might be the first time this has
[1:58:27.560 --> 1:58:29.560]  ever happened. Maybe it's because
[1:58:29.560 --> 1:58:31.560]  he didn't realize he was going to be on television.
[1:58:31.560 --> 1:58:33.560]  And as Chris Cuomo has said,
[1:58:33.560 --> 1:58:35.560]  sometimes, that's really the most
[1:58:35.560 --> 1:58:37.560]  honest.
[1:58:37.560 --> 1:58:39.560]  Hey, man. We're going to come back with this.
[1:58:39.560 --> 1:58:41.560]  We're going to be back in 70 seconds.
[1:58:41.560 --> 1:58:43.560]  Third hour straight ahead in Mike Cernovich.

[2:00:23.560 --> 2:00:25.560]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:00:25.560 --> 2:00:27.560]  The real reward is dominating

[2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:31.560]  We're not offering utopia,
[2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:33.560]  but turning away from conscious
[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:35.560]  psychopathic government,
[2:00:35.560 --> 2:00:37.560]  dumbing people down, making them poor,
[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:39.560]  promoting racism, turning people against each other,
[2:00:39.560 --> 2:00:41.560]  back towards prosperity, back towards
[2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:43.560]  God, back towards Renaissance,
[2:00:43.560 --> 2:00:45.560]  back towards sanity, back towards common sense.
[2:00:45.560 --> 2:00:47.560]  Here's a few of the clips
[2:00:47.560 --> 2:00:49.560]  of the latest Project Veritas bombshell
[2:00:49.560 --> 2:00:51.560]  with Van Jones saying
[2:00:51.560 --> 2:00:53.560]  Russia's a nothing burger.
[2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:55.560]  No kidding, here it is.
[2:00:55.560 --> 2:00:57.560]  Hey, man.
[2:00:57.560 --> 2:00:59.560]  We met in Palm Springs a few years back.
[2:00:59.560 --> 2:01:01.560]  Good to see you. Are you good?
[2:01:01.560 --> 2:01:03.560]  Yeah. How you been? What are you doing?
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:05.560]  What do you think is going to happen this week?
[2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:07.560]  I mean, with the whole Russia thing.
[2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:09.560]  Russia thing is just a big nothing burger.
[2:01:09.560 --> 2:01:11.560]  Really? Yeah.
[2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:13.560]  You don't think that...
[2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:15.560]  Nothing that you could do.
[2:01:15.560 --> 2:01:17.560]  No.
[2:01:17.560 --> 2:01:19.560]  Russia thing is just a big nothing burger.
[2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:21.560]  Really? You don't think that...
[2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:23.560]  Nothing that you could do.
[2:01:23.560 --> 2:01:25.560]  No.
[2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:27.560]  CNN's response, quote,
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:29.560]  CNN stands by our medical producer
[2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:31.560]  John Bonifield.
[2:01:31.560 --> 2:01:33.560]  Diversity of personal opinion is what makes CNN
[2:01:33.560 --> 2:01:35.560]  strong. We welcome it and embrace it.
[2:01:35.560 --> 2:01:37.560]  Unquote.
[2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:39.560]  Good. Because Bonifield says
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:41.560]  he was not alone in his cynicism
[2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:43.560]  about the news business.
[2:01:43.560 --> 2:01:45.560]  And Dan Jones agrees with him
[2:01:45.560 --> 2:01:47.560]  that the Russia story is bold.
[2:01:47.560 --> 2:01:49.560]  So I love the news business,
[2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:51.560]  but I find it so fascinating.
[2:01:51.560 --> 2:01:53.560]  I'm very cynical about it.
[2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:55.560]  At the same time, so are most of my colleagues.
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:01:57.560]  Yeah, it's like...
[2:01:57.560 --> 2:01:59.560]  Not alone.
[2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:01.560]  Russia thing is just a big nothing burger.
[2:02:01.560 --> 2:02:03.560]  Really?
[2:02:03.560 --> 2:02:05.560]  The organization is reeling.
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:07.560]  The president is posting headlines
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:09.560]  about our investigation.
[2:02:09.560 --> 2:02:11.560]  It is paying attention.
[2:02:11.560 --> 2:02:13.560]  White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders
[2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:15.560]  has a recommendation to all.
[2:02:15.560 --> 2:02:17.560]  There's a video circulating now,
[2:02:17.560 --> 2:02:19.560]  whether it's accurate or not.
[2:02:19.560 --> 2:02:21.560]  I don't know, but I would encourage everybody
[2:02:21.560 --> 2:02:23.560]  in this room and, frankly, everybody
[2:02:23.560 --> 2:02:25.560]  across the country to take a look at it.
[2:02:25.560 --> 2:02:27.560]  So there you have it.
[2:02:27.560 --> 2:02:29.560]  Van Jones admits the Russia story
[2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:31.560]  is just a nothing burger.
[2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:33.560]  Bonifield says it's all about ratings.
[2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:35.560]  The White House is telling everyone
[2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:37.560]  to go watch the videos.
[2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:39.560]  We're going to play with manufacturing consent.
[2:02:39.560 --> 2:02:41.560]  People are fed up with
[2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:43.560]  the emptiness and the artifice
[2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:45.560]  that pervades our media.
[2:02:45.560 --> 2:02:47.560]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[2:02:47.560 --> 2:02:49.560]  Change is coming, whether CNN likes it or not.
[2:02:49.560 --> 2:02:51.560]  Great job, okay?
[2:02:51.560 --> 2:02:53.560]  You got it again.
[2:02:53.560 --> 2:02:55.560]  All right, in closing, Doug Hagman
[2:02:55.560 --> 2:02:57.560]  of HagridReport.com.
[2:02:57.560 --> 2:02:59.560]  What can all of us do right now?
[2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:01.560]  This is a time of maximum effort.
[2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:03.560]  History is being determined.
[2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:05.560]  We're at the classic crossroads, aren't we?
[2:03:05.560 --> 2:03:07.560]  The rhetoric from the left,
[2:03:07.560 --> 2:03:09.560]  the violent rhetoric from the left,
[2:03:09.560 --> 2:03:11.560]  from the progressive,
[2:03:11.560 --> 2:03:13.560]  the mental midgets over there,
[2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:15.560]  the people like Lepone
[2:03:15.560 --> 2:03:17.560]  and Johnny Depp
[2:03:17.560 --> 2:03:19.560]  and the idiots that espouse
[2:03:19.560 --> 2:03:21.560]  the violence.
[2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:23.560]  Right along with the people
[2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:25.560]  like Van Jones and John,
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:27.560]  the CNN producer, John Bonifield,
[2:03:27.560 --> 2:03:29.560]  all of these people
[2:03:29.560 --> 2:03:31.560]  are responsible and will have blood
[2:03:31.560 --> 2:03:33.560]  on their hands for the Civil War
[2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:35.560]  that is
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:37.560]  that we're in
[2:03:37.560 --> 2:03:39.560]  and speaking with Matt Bracken
[2:03:39.560 --> 2:03:41.560]  yesterday. We are in a Civil War.
[2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:43.560]  It's an ideological Civil War
[2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:45.560]  and it's going to turn into a shooting.
[2:03:45.560 --> 2:03:47.560]  Well, it really has already turned into a shooting war
[2:03:47.560 --> 2:03:49.560]  with the Hodgkinson assault.
[2:03:49.560 --> 2:03:51.560]  No, I agree. Doesn't that mark
[2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:53.560]  kind of the shot hurt around the world?
[2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:55.560]  Yeah, and I think so.
[2:03:55.560 --> 2:03:57.560]  And of course, you've got Kathy Griffin
[2:03:57.560 --> 2:03:59.560]  holding up the suburb head of Donald Trump.
[2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:01.560]  They're losing the intellectual fight.
[2:04:01.560 --> 2:04:03.560]  With the classical group
[2:04:03.560 --> 2:04:05.560]  that are the killers, that doesn't sound smart.
[2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:07.560]  Watch this summer.
[2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:09.560]  I do believe that the
[2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:11.560]  and this of course is what the handlers want.
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:13.560]  They want this civil
[2:04:13.560 --> 2:04:15.560]  chaos, the civil unrest
[2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:17.560]  and they're going to get it.
[2:04:17.560 --> 2:04:19.560]  I'm afraid they are just simply because
[2:04:19.560 --> 2:04:21.560]  I think the honest
[2:04:21.560 --> 2:04:23.560]  conservative Bible believing Christian
[2:04:23.560 --> 2:04:25.560]  evangelical
[2:04:25.560 --> 2:04:27.560]  Bible guns
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:29.560]  borders language and culture
[2:04:29.560 --> 2:04:31.560]  as Mike Savage says,
[2:04:31.560 --> 2:04:33.560]  I think they're fed up
[2:04:33.560 --> 2:04:35.560]  and enough is enough.
[2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:37.560]  We have to fight back. We have to take a stand
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:39.560]  and say, not one more step, not now,
[2:04:39.560 --> 2:04:41.560]  not again.
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:43.560]  That's right. They're trying to sexualize the children
[2:04:43.560 --> 2:04:45.560]  trying to bring the radical Muslims in.
[2:04:45.560 --> 2:04:47.560]  They're insane. Doug Hagman,
[2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:49.560]  thank you for your great insight.
[2:04:49.560 --> 2:04:51.560]  We'll talk to you again soon. Thank you, my friend.
[2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:53.560]  All right. Thank you, sir.
[2:04:53.560 --> 2:04:55.560]  I've got more of those press hearings I didn't get to.
[2:04:55.560 --> 2:04:57.560]  More of the Project Veritas.
[2:04:57.560 --> 2:04:59.560]  Mike Cernovich coming up with breaking news.
[2:05:27.560 --> 2:05:29.560]  In this contest, it's to encourage you,
[2:05:29.560 --> 2:05:31.560]  the listener, to realize that you have the power
[2:05:31.560 --> 2:05:33.560]  to save civilization from the criminal cabal
[2:05:33.560 --> 2:05:35.560]  controlling humanity in this fake news propaganda
[2:05:35.560 --> 2:05:37.560]  machine called CNN. The first thing to do
[2:05:37.560 --> 2:05:39.560]  is hammer the point to the public that CNN
[2:05:39.560 --> 2:05:41.560]  is fake news, which a CNN producer
[2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:43.560]  admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:45.560]  Project Veritas. We need to come together
[2:05:45.560 --> 2:05:47.560]  remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates
[2:05:47.560 --> 2:05:49.560]  globalist propaganda thought up by multinational
[2:05:49.560 --> 2:05:51.560]  think tanks that is then fed to the public
[2:05:51.560 --> 2:05:53.560]  to suppress individual thought and run
[2:05:53.560 --> 2:05:55.560]  humanity into a ditch. For more contest rules

[2:07:20.560 --> 2:07:22.560]  100% organic mustard seed.
[2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:24.560]  The effects of the essential trace
[2:07:24.560 --> 2:07:26.560]  mineral selenium are well known.
[2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:28.560]  From supporting the thyroid gland and immune system
[2:07:28.560 --> 2:07:30.560]  to DNA production and eyesight,
[2:07:30.560 --> 2:07:32.560]  Biotrucelinium is also the perfect

[2:07:52.560 --> 2:07:54.560]  We didn't ask for this fight, but we're in
[2:07:54.560 --> 2:07:56.560]  this fight. This is the time to support
[2:07:56.560 --> 2:07:58.560]  infowars. That's infowarslife.com
[2:08:02.560 --> 2:08:04.560]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:06.560]  It's Alex Jones

[2:08:08.560 --> 2:08:10.560]  of the info war.

[2:08:14.560 --> 2:08:16.560]  I'm opening the phones up on any subject
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:18.560]  any issue,

[2:08:30.560 --> 2:08:32.560]  Again, I want to be absolutely
[2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:34.560]  crystal clear.
[2:08:34.560 --> 2:08:36.560]  I'm not Oprah Winfrey up here handing out
[2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:38.560]  car keys to free cars
[2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:40.560]  to 100 people to create the illusion that
[2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:42.560]  she's doing that for her whole audience of
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:44.560]  tens of millions.
[2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:46.560]  I'm not up here saying that we're entering
[2:08:46.560 --> 2:08:48.560]  some perfect nirvana or
[2:08:48.560 --> 2:08:50.560]  after the battle of
[2:08:50.560 --> 2:08:52.560]  Dameron Valhalla.
[2:08:54.560 --> 2:08:56.560]  There used to be Ragnarok in the book of
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:08:58.560]  Guter Dameron.
[2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:00.560]  I'm simply saying
[2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:02.560]  mainstream media
[2:09:02.560 --> 2:09:04.560]  corporate spin doctors that had people in a trance
[2:09:04.560 --> 2:09:06.560]  and were able to bully and intimidate the
[2:09:06.560 --> 2:09:08.560]  people of the world into submitting to
[2:09:08.560 --> 2:09:10.560]  globalism, has no credibility
[2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:12.560]  and is in freefall and is imploding
[2:09:12.560 --> 2:09:14.560]  and is being routed.
[2:09:14.560 --> 2:09:16.560]  And Trump, whether he's a good guy, an opportunist,
[2:09:16.560 --> 2:09:18.560]  whatever the case is, is riding that
[2:09:18.560 --> 2:09:20.560]  wave
[2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:22.560]  and delivering
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:24.560]  on bringing sovereignty back to the country. Does that
[2:09:24.560 --> 2:09:26.560]  mean we remember the policy he has
[2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:28.560]  or can't get stuff through on a tax cut
[2:09:28.560 --> 2:09:30.560]  or having trouble getting rid of Obamacare? It took
[2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:32.560]  Obama two and a half years to pass Obamacare.
[2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:34.560]  Trump can't do it in six months. We say he's
[2:09:34.560 --> 2:09:36.560]  the devil. He's trying.
[2:09:36.560 --> 2:09:38.560]  The plans they've got are better. They're certainly
[2:09:38.560 --> 2:09:40.560]  not perfect. Our whole health care system's
[2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:42.560]  been taken over.
[2:09:42.560 --> 2:09:44.560]  Thank you to Elizabeth Warren, Pocahontas admitting
[2:09:44.560 --> 2:09:46.560]  today the plan is single payer.
[2:09:46.560 --> 2:09:48.560]  Daniel, one of the main architects, said the
[2:09:48.560 --> 2:09:50.560]  plan was to bankrupt it.
[2:09:52.560 --> 2:09:54.560]  The control demolition of the economy
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:09:56.560]  clowered and pivoted. That's their plan.
[2:09:56.560 --> 2:09:58.560]  It's not like they're demolishing
[2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:00.560]  some old rotting barn.
[2:10:00.560 --> 2:10:02.560]  They're demolishing the most successful system
[2:10:02.560 --> 2:10:04.560]  ever and trying to replace it with something like
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:06.560]  they have in Venezuela.
[2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:08.560]  No, thank you.
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:10.560]  So all I'm offering is not destroying ourselves.
[2:10:10.560 --> 2:10:12.560]  What I'm promoting is
[2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:14.560]  common sense.
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:16.560]  It's hard for them to bet against that.
[2:10:16.560 --> 2:10:18.560]  That's why they are
[2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:20.560]  in conniption fits in every establishment
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:22.560]  publication from the Atlantic
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:24.560]  monthly to
[2:10:24.560 --> 2:10:26.560]  the nation to the
[2:10:26.560 --> 2:10:28.560]  financial time saying, how do we shut
[2:10:28.560 --> 2:10:30.560]  Alex Jones down? They've already
[2:10:30.560 --> 2:10:32.560]  tried to infiltrate. They've already tried sex
[2:10:32.560 --> 2:10:34.560]  operatives. They've already gone out for my family.
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:36.560]  They've done everything and they just realize
[2:10:36.560 --> 2:10:38.560]  I just, I'm not
[2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:40.560]  changing course. I just get stronger
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:42.560]  under all this. But remember, they want
[2:10:42.560 --> 2:10:44.560]  to intimidate you. They think
[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:46.560]  because they're showing me under attack
[2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:48.560]  or Trump under attack or
[2:10:48.560 --> 2:10:50.560]  Grudge under attack or Stephen Bannon
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:52.560]  under attack that you'll
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:54.560]  think, oh, I'll be under attack if I
[2:10:54.560 --> 2:10:56.560]  stand up. No.
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:10:58.560]  You'll meet friends. You'll meet great people.
[2:10:58.560 --> 2:11:00.560]  You'll have more opportunities. 9
[2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:02.560]  times out of 10.
[2:11:02.560 --> 2:11:04.560]  Fighting tyranny is an open door.
[2:11:04.560 --> 2:11:06.560]  Fighting tyranny is a positive. Does it mean
[2:11:06.560 --> 2:11:08.560]  you don't run into some problems? No,
[2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:10.560]  you do. But it doesn't matter.
[2:11:10.560 --> 2:11:12.560]  Where is the animating contest of
[2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:14.560]  liberty? Where is it where you take it
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:16.560]  personal that they've decided
[2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:18.560]  in big Ford Foundation
[2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:20.560]  boards and
[2:11:20.560 --> 2:11:22.560]  psychology boards? 67 years ago, they were
[2:11:22.560 --> 2:11:24.560]  going to sexualize your children
[2:11:24.560 --> 2:11:26.560]  because they could sexualize them
[2:11:26.560 --> 2:11:28.560]  than the marketing sticks.
[2:11:28.560 --> 2:11:30.560]  If they do it with trauma, with sex
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:32.560]  or sexualization, then
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:34.560]  the weird politics can be brought in.
[2:11:34.560 --> 2:11:36.560]  That's why they try to sexualize. It's abuse,
[2:11:36.560 --> 2:11:38.560]  trauma-based mind control. They admit
[2:11:38.560 --> 2:11:40.560]  all this.
[2:11:40.560 --> 2:11:42.560]  They admit they want to bring in Islam.
[2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:44.560]  They admit they want to destroy
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:46.560]  the engine of free society.
[2:11:46.560 --> 2:11:48.560]  It's why Soros calls his system the
[2:11:48.560 --> 2:11:50.560]  open society. It's the opposite.
[2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:54.560]  So James Leslie Rawls is with us. I wanted
[2:11:54.560 --> 2:11:56.560]  to get him on. Former Army Intelligence
[2:11:56.560 --> 2:11:58.560]  officer, best-selling
[2:11:58.560 --> 2:12:00.560]  author, runs the biggest survival
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:02.560]  blog out there, survivalblog.com.
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:04.560]  Highly respected by a lot of the folks
[2:12:04.560 --> 2:12:06.560]  that I respect. Always love having him on.
[2:12:06.560 --> 2:12:08.560]  I wanted to get him on just to ask.
[2:12:08.560 --> 2:12:10.560]  It's funny because Nigo walks in and
[2:12:10.560 --> 2:12:12.560]  goes, yeah, you want him on every month.
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:14.560]  He only wants to talk about Civil War,
[2:12:14.560 --> 2:12:16.560]  Antifa, parallels from the 70s
[2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:18.560]  and 60s, and where things are going.
[2:12:18.560 --> 2:12:20.560]  That's exactly why I want him on.
[2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:22.560]  Not just every six months, but every month
[2:12:22.560 --> 2:12:24.560]  now, because
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:26.560]  things are intensifying and
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:28.560]  clearly they admit they want to
[2:12:28.560 --> 2:12:30.560]  violent civil war. It's not us speculating.
[2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:32.560]  They think they're going to start some COG
[2:12:32.560 --> 2:12:34.560]  and have a video we're going to play at the bottom of the
[2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:36.560]  video.
[2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:38.560]  They're going to have a video of
[2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:40.560]  leftists so pathetically
[2:12:40.560 --> 2:12:42.560]  out trying to march and do
[2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:44.560]  set ups and prepare for combat
[2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:46.560]  to defend themselves.
[2:12:46.560 --> 2:12:48.560]  What they really mean is when they swing
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:50.560]  a bike lock at your head, you fight
[2:12:50.560 --> 2:12:52.560]  back. They mean how do you like, and
[2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:54.560]  of course the training is learn how to
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:56.560]  sneak up on somebody with a bike lock.
[2:12:56.560 --> 2:12:58.560]  That would be the real training. But I
[2:12:58.560 --> 2:13:00.560]  think this is the beginning of their
[2:13:00.560 --> 2:13:02.560]  awakening. They've been so domesticated
[2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:04.560]  at this level to see
[2:13:04.560 --> 2:13:06.560]  how domesticated they've been, because I don't know
[2:13:06.560 --> 2:13:08.560]  anybody who's really competent
[2:13:08.560 --> 2:13:10.560]  long term
[2:13:10.560 --> 2:13:12.560]  who is totally into evil. You might be a mercenary.
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:14.560]  You might have done some bad stuff early on.
[2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:16.560]  Then you destroy yourself with guilt for what you were involved in.
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:18.560]  But most of the people that are really running things are
[2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:20.560]  like these spiritually, but also physically
[2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:22.560]  hunchback pedophiles with really
[2:13:22.560 --> 2:13:24.560]  ugly demon creatures. Look at who surrounds
[2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:26.560]  Hillary because she only wants ugly to surround her.
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:28.560]  I don't mean ugly people are bad enough themselves.
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:30.560]  They're beautiful people that are physically ugly.
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:32.560]  And with the globalist though, it is an archetype
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:34.560]  of the wicked witch.
[2:13:34.560 --> 2:13:36.560]  I'll get you and your little dog too.
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:38.560]  These things must be done delicately,
[2:13:38.560 --> 2:13:40.560]  my pretty.
[2:13:40.560 --> 2:13:42.560]  And so
[2:13:42.560 --> 2:13:44.560]  that's why they want us to be fallen
[2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:46.560]  like they are. Not like we aren't fallen,
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:48.560]  but they fell even further
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:50.560]  and broke their back a few times on the way down.
[2:13:50.560 --> 2:13:52.560]  So they're crawling
[2:13:52.560 --> 2:13:54.560]  and want to pull us down
[2:13:54.560 --> 2:13:56.560]  with them. But that's it.
[2:13:56.560 --> 2:13:58.560]  And it's in their literature, it's who they are. They are
[2:13:58.560 --> 2:14:00.560]  the scum of the
[2:14:00.560 --> 2:14:02.560]  disreputable earth. And those of us that aren't
[2:14:02.560 --> 2:14:04.560]  innately evil and innately scumbags
[2:14:04.560 --> 2:14:06.560]  and innately jealous,
[2:14:06.560 --> 2:14:08.560]  somebody's got a gorgeous wife,
[2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:10.560]  beautiful whatever, great literature, I admire them.
[2:14:10.560 --> 2:14:12.560]  A great, play the guitar great, I admire them.
[2:14:12.560 --> 2:14:14.560]  I don't hate somebody because they can play the guitar.
[2:14:14.560 --> 2:14:16.560]  And I've always been blind because I'm not a selfish,
[2:14:16.560 --> 2:14:18.560]  envious person. I don't realize how it rules
[2:14:18.560 --> 2:14:20.560]  so many others. And I'm not talking about how
[2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:22.560]  moral I am, rage,
[2:14:22.560 --> 2:14:24.560]  lust, I've got those better than the devil.
[2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:26.560]  All I'm telling you is
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:28.560]  I don't have envy. I don't have
[2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:30.560]  jealousy.
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:32.560]  And it blinds you
[2:14:32.560 --> 2:14:34.560]  to what drives them.
[2:14:34.560 --> 2:14:36.560]  So James Losey Rawls, a great psychology expert
[2:14:36.560 --> 2:14:38.560]  on this.
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:40.560]  Where are we at this current juncture?
[2:14:40.560 --> 2:14:42.560]  Do you agree with me that we're seeing devastating human
[2:14:42.560 --> 2:14:44.560]  awakening to the globalist? Huge events,
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:46.560]  but I can feel though their counter strike
[2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:48.560]  is going to be insane, wild
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:50.560]  and very dangerous.
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:52.560]  Well, Alex, I think you asked
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:54.560]  where we are. I'd say we're about
[2:14:54.560 --> 2:14:56.560]  in 1967 right now.
[2:14:56.560 --> 2:14:58.560]  If you look back to the
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:00.560]  1960s and the radicalization
[2:15:00.560 --> 2:15:02.560]  of
[2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:04.560]  what started out as an anti-draft,
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:06.560]  anti-war movement,
[2:15:06.560 --> 2:15:08.560]  it all got started very peacefully
[2:15:08.560 --> 2:15:10.560]  with a group called the
[2:15:10.560 --> 2:15:12.560]  Students for a Democratic Society,
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:14.560]  SDS.
[2:15:14.560 --> 2:15:16.560]  And those
[2:15:16.560 --> 2:15:18.560]  protests grew more and more violent
[2:15:18.560 --> 2:15:20.560]  and a lot
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:22.560]  of the people that were involved got
[2:15:22.560 --> 2:15:24.560]  increasingly radicalized.
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:26.560]  And then
[2:15:26.560 --> 2:15:28.560]  starting in the late 60s,
[2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:30.560]  67, 68, 69,
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:32.560]  you saw splinter groups
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:34.560]  come off of
[2:15:34.560 --> 2:15:36.560]  the anti-war movement. The weatherman.
[2:15:36.560 --> 2:15:38.560]  But don't you agree that we're going to see an acceleration
[2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:40.560]  of the radicalization?
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:42.560]  I think so. In fact, I think it can happen much more
[2:15:42.560 --> 2:15:44.560]  rapidly because of the rapid dissemination
[2:15:44.560 --> 2:15:46.560]  of information and
[2:15:46.560 --> 2:15:48.560]  because of the
[2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:50.560]  indoctrination that so many
[2:15:50.560 --> 2:15:52.560]  young people have had through the
[2:15:52.560 --> 2:15:54.560]  public schools. And now mainstream
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:15:56.560]  media working in the trauma-based
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:15:58.560]  control. So let me ask you this.
[2:15:58.560 --> 2:16:00.560]  How accelerated is the compression
[2:16:00.560 --> 2:16:02.560]  and what's your forecast?
[2:16:02.560 --> 2:16:04.560]  I think within two years
[2:16:04.560 --> 2:16:06.560]  we'll probably see overt terrorism
[2:16:06.560 --> 2:16:08.560]  coming out of
[2:16:08.560 --> 2:16:10.560]  groups like Black Lives Matter
[2:16:10.560 --> 2:16:12.560]  and the Antifa movement.
[2:16:12.560 --> 2:16:14.560]  And an amazing
[2:16:14.560 --> 2:16:16.560]  parallel is that
[2:16:16.560 --> 2:16:18.560]  if you look at the late 1960s,
[2:16:18.560 --> 2:16:20.560]  the real
[2:16:20.560 --> 2:16:22.560]  ringleaders of the terrorist campaign
[2:16:22.560 --> 2:16:24.560]  that took place then
[2:16:24.560 --> 2:16:26.560]  was a mixture
[2:16:26.560 --> 2:16:28.560]  of disenfranchised
[2:16:28.560 --> 2:16:30.560]  inner-city Blacks
[2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:32.560]  and
[2:16:32.560 --> 2:16:34.560]  ultra-privileged college-educated
[2:16:34.560 --> 2:16:36.560]  whites. And so we see
[2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:38.560]  heirs advising Obama, they're literally
[2:16:38.560 --> 2:16:40.560]  running the same Saul Olinsky plan
[2:16:40.560 --> 2:16:42.560]  but the 21st century.
[2:16:42.560 --> 2:16:44.560]  Right.
[2:16:44.560 --> 2:16:46.560]  I think we're going to see them get
[2:16:46.560 --> 2:16:48.560]  rapidly radicalized
[2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:50.560]  and very rapidly transition
[2:16:50.560 --> 2:16:52.560]  over terrorism. And I think their
[2:16:52.560 --> 2:16:54.560]  first terrorist attacks
[2:16:54.560 --> 2:16:56.560]  will probably be in the cyber world.
[2:16:56.560 --> 2:16:58.560]  And
[2:16:58.560 --> 2:17:00.560]  probably then followed by
[2:17:00.560 --> 2:17:02.560]  overt bombings, kidnappings.
[2:17:02.560 --> 2:17:04.560]  If, you know, a lot of your
[2:17:04.560 --> 2:17:06.560]  listeners who weren't
[2:17:06.560 --> 2:17:08.560]  born
[2:17:08.560 --> 2:17:10.560]  when we were, anyone born after
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:12.560]  about 1965
[2:17:12.560 --> 2:17:14.560]  or 68
[2:17:14.560 --> 2:17:16.560]  probably does not remember this whole
[2:17:16.560 --> 2:17:18.560]  period of time, but
[2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:20.560]  in the late 60s and the early
[2:17:20.560 --> 2:17:22.560]  70s. Same deal, random
[2:17:22.560 --> 2:17:24.560]  cop killing, bank robberies
[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:26.560]  kidnapping. Right.
[2:17:26.560 --> 2:17:28.560]  Airline hijackings,
[2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:30.560]  assassinations,
[2:17:30.560 --> 2:17:32.560]  yeah, kidnappings, the whole works.
[2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:34.560]  And they got very commonplace.
[2:17:34.560 --> 2:17:36.560]  In fact, one of the standing jokes was
[2:17:36.560 --> 2:17:38.560]  about airline hijackings.
[2:17:38.560 --> 2:17:40.560]  And I remember
[2:17:40.560 --> 2:17:42.560]  one of the jokes when I was a kid was
[2:17:42.560 --> 2:17:44.560]  some guy getting on a bus and saying
[2:17:44.560 --> 2:17:46.560]  take this bus to Cuba.
[2:17:46.560 --> 2:17:48.560]  Well,
[2:17:48.560 --> 2:17:50.560]  because there were so many hijackings
[2:17:50.560 --> 2:17:52.560]  that ended up in Cuba. And
[2:17:52.560 --> 2:17:54.560]  a lot of those people are still
[2:17:54.560 --> 2:17:56.560]  on the lam even to this day, some
[2:17:56.560 --> 2:17:58.560]  of them living in Africa, some of them
[2:17:58.560 --> 2:18:00.560]  living in Cuba.
[2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:02.560]  That whole generation is still alive,
[2:18:02.560 --> 2:18:04.560]  but that whole mentality
[2:18:04.560 --> 2:18:06.560]  and by the way, that famous lady, if we're
[2:18:06.560 --> 2:18:08.560]  going to name the cop killer that went to Cuba,
[2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:10.560]  she's the admitted spiritual founder
[2:18:10.560 --> 2:18:12.560]  of the Black Lives Matter.
[2:18:12.560 --> 2:18:14.560]  Right.
[2:18:14.560 --> 2:18:16.560]  There's a book that I highly recommend.
[2:18:16.560 --> 2:18:18.560]  It was written by a gent named Brian Burroughs.
[2:18:18.560 --> 2:18:20.560]  Brian with a Y.
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:22.560]  And it's called Days of Rage.
[2:18:22.560 --> 2:18:24.560]  And it details
[2:18:24.560 --> 2:18:26.560]  what happened in the late 1960s and the early
[2:18:26.560 --> 2:18:28.560]  70s with the radicalization
[2:18:28.560 --> 2:18:30.560]  of groups like the Black Panthers, the
[2:18:30.560 --> 2:18:32.560]  Weather Underground, the Black Liberation
[2:18:32.560 --> 2:18:34.560]  Army, the BLA, the FALN,
[2:18:34.560 --> 2:18:36.560]  which was a Puerto Rican
[2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:38.560]  splinter group.
[2:18:38.560 --> 2:18:40.560]  And of course, the Symbianese Liberation Army
[2:18:40.560 --> 2:18:42.560]  with Tiger.
[2:18:42.560 --> 2:18:44.560]  I agree with you, but I think it's going to be
[2:18:44.560 --> 2:18:46.560]  20 times bigger than the 60s, 70s and 80s.
[2:18:46.560 --> 2:18:48.560]  And I think as you said, it's compressed.
[2:18:48.560 --> 2:18:50.560]  But I think the shooting of Scalise
[2:18:50.560 --> 2:18:52.560]  and all of this is the beginning. I understand
[2:18:52.560 --> 2:18:54.560]  he's a lone wolf, but I think with this
[2:18:54.560 --> 2:18:56.560]  ambient brainwashing for violence,
[2:18:56.560 --> 2:18:58.560]  the terrorism is being directed
[2:18:58.560 --> 2:19:00.560]  just like Al Qaeda or ISIS does it
[2:19:00.560 --> 2:19:02.560]  from a central deal and then
[2:19:02.560 --> 2:19:04.560]  random people pick up on it and follow
[2:19:04.560 --> 2:19:06.560]  the blueprint.
[2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:08.560]  And that makes them as self-radicalized.
[2:19:08.560 --> 2:19:10.560]  Exactly. So I think we're already
[2:19:10.560 --> 2:19:12.560]  seeing it then.
[2:19:12.560 --> 2:19:14.560]  But the tempo could increase
[2:19:14.560 --> 2:19:16.560]  very rapidly. And because of some of the
[2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:18.560]  technologies that exist,
[2:19:18.560 --> 2:19:20.560]  we have things like
[2:19:20.560 --> 2:19:22.560]  cyber warfare. We have mycotoxins.
[2:19:22.560 --> 2:19:24.560]  We've got off-the-shelf
[2:19:24.560 --> 2:19:26.560]  quadricopter
[2:19:26.560 --> 2:19:28.560]  drones.
[2:19:28.560 --> 2:19:30.560]  Yeah, so one of these people could get a job in a
[2:19:30.560 --> 2:19:32.560]  major restaurant.
[2:19:32.560 --> 2:19:34.560]  We've got some of those technologies to create
[2:19:34.560 --> 2:19:36.560]  where you could have
[2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:38.560]  terrorist events just
[2:19:38.560 --> 2:19:40.560]  kind of appear to be spontaneous,
[2:19:40.560 --> 2:19:42.560]  but they could be very well orchestrated
[2:19:42.560 --> 2:19:44.560]  and devastating. So what you're saying is
[2:19:44.560 --> 2:19:46.560]  the organizational mode is what's coming?
[2:19:46.560 --> 2:19:48.560]  Yeah.
[2:19:48.560 --> 2:19:50.560]  Now, there's going to be a mix.
[2:19:50.560 --> 2:19:52.560]  There's going to be some top-level
[2:19:52.560 --> 2:19:54.560]  ideological motivation.
[2:19:54.560 --> 2:19:56.560]  Well, let's talk about how to stop this then.
[2:19:56.560 --> 2:20:06.560]  Let's talk about that when we come back.

[2:24:55.560 --> 2:24:57.560]  We're going to have more surveillance,
[2:24:57.560 --> 2:24:59.560]  but you're going to let Muslims still come in
[2:24:59.560 --> 2:25:01.560]  and then she has Ramadan celebrations.
[2:25:01.560 --> 2:25:03.560]  I mean, I'm sorry, the Muslims aren't compatible.
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:05.560]  I can't move to any of their countries
[2:25:05.560 --> 2:25:07.560]  as a Christian and live.
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:09.560]  I can be a contractor on a compound,
[2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:11.560]  but if I go preach the Bible anywhere
[2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:13.560]  unless it was Syria or Libya,
[2:25:13.560 --> 2:25:15.560]  I guess they would let you, but that's why
[2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:17.560]  we took them over. The radical Muslims
[2:25:17.560 --> 2:25:19.560]  will kill you. Anyways, I'm digressing James
[2:25:19.560 --> 2:25:21.560]  Leslie Rawls, survivalblog.com,
[2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:23.560]  former Army intelligence bestselling
[2:25:23.560 --> 2:25:25.560]  predicted much of what we now see unfolding.
[2:25:25.560 --> 2:25:27.560]  We know the radicalization
[2:25:27.560 --> 2:25:29.560]  is happening. Hell, they want a summer of rage
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:31.560]  right now and funded by Soros.
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:33.560]  I agree with you. It's going to intensify.
[2:25:33.560 --> 2:25:35.560]  Let me ask you this.
[2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:37.560]  How do we thread the needle and deal
[2:25:37.560 --> 2:25:39.560]  with this, but without getting rid of our
[2:25:39.560 --> 2:25:41.560]  Bill of Rights and Constitution? Well, I think if
[2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:43.560]  you've declared yourself a communist or a globalist,
[2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:45.560]  you now are not a U.S.
[2:25:45.560 --> 2:25:47.560]  citizen. You have declared yourself that
[2:25:47.560 --> 2:25:49.560]  you're not a citizen. You've declared yourself
[2:25:49.560 --> 2:25:51.560]  a citizen of this global corporate
[2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:53.560]  radical enterprise. And so I think
[2:25:53.560 --> 2:25:55.560]  at that point, we need laws to deport
[2:25:55.560 --> 2:25:57.560]  people, taxpayer funded
[2:25:57.560 --> 2:25:59.560]  to the country of their choice. I mean, let them go
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:01.560]  to Liberia. Let them go to Venezuela.
[2:26:01.560 --> 2:26:03.560]  Let them go to North Korea. I mean, if you want
[2:26:03.560 --> 2:26:05.560]  to overthrow things and you're trying to organize
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:07.560]  this garbage, not
[2:26:07.560 --> 2:26:09.560]  to take over the government to enforce the Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[2:26:09.560 --> 2:26:11.560]  which is your right, but to
[2:26:11.560 --> 2:26:13.560]  overthrow it, then we
[2:26:13.560 --> 2:26:15.560]  have a duty. I mean, I don't have fantasies
[2:26:15.560 --> 2:26:17.560]  about killing these people or fantasies
[2:26:17.560 --> 2:26:19.560]  about them being arrested. It's really
[2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:21.560]  dirty, dangerous work that we could
[2:26:21.560 --> 2:26:23.560]  become corrupted by. But my gut
[2:26:23.560 --> 2:26:25.560]  and my intellect tells me with a family
[2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:27.560]  and four children in this country, we
[2:26:27.560 --> 2:26:29.560]  can't just sit by with a clear and present danger.
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:31.560]  What do you say?
[2:26:31.560 --> 2:26:33.560]  Well, I have to agree with you to an extent.
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:35.560]  Just before the break, we were
[2:26:35.560 --> 2:26:37.560]  talking about the leadership
[2:26:37.560 --> 2:26:39.560]  of the Antifa movement and
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:41.560]  the ideological leadership
[2:26:41.560 --> 2:26:43.560]  is actually coming from the George
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:45.560]  Soros and the Hillary Clinton
[2:26:45.560 --> 2:26:49.560]  movement. Exactly. But
[2:26:49.560 --> 2:26:51.560]  at the
[2:26:51.560 --> 2:26:53.560]  stormtrooper level,
[2:26:53.560 --> 2:26:55.560]  the real foot soldiers of the movement,
[2:26:55.560 --> 2:26:57.560]  unfortunately, what we're probably going to see
[2:26:57.560 --> 2:26:59.560]  is a leaderless resistance movement,
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:01.560]  which is very hard to penetrate, very hard
[2:27:01.560 --> 2:27:03.560]  to track, very hard to predict.
[2:27:03.560 --> 2:27:05.560]  Exactly. It's just useful
[2:27:05.560 --> 2:27:07.560]  idiots that kind of reach a moment
[2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:09.560]  and then they're
[2:27:09.560 --> 2:27:11.560]  pregnant with their hate and their belly button
[2:27:11.560 --> 2:27:13.560]  pops out and they go out and throw out the attack.
[2:27:13.560 --> 2:27:15.560]  Well, yes.
[2:27:15.560 --> 2:27:17.560]  And we've already seen it. I think
[2:27:17.560 --> 2:27:19.560]  Hodgkinson was just a
[2:27:19.560 --> 2:27:21.560]  precursor of what we're going to see
[2:27:21.560 --> 2:27:23.560]  with a lot of younger Americans
[2:27:23.560 --> 2:27:25.560]  who are. I agree. He was just the tremor.
[2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:27.560]  So how big is the quake?
[2:27:27.560 --> 2:27:29.560]  I think it'll be huge. And
[2:27:29.560 --> 2:27:31.560]  unfortunately, we're talking about a whole
[2:27:31.560 --> 2:27:33.560]  generation of young people without moral
[2:27:33.560 --> 2:27:35.560]  compunctions and with a lot
[2:27:35.560 --> 2:27:37.560]  of cyber skills. So again, I think
[2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:39.560]  the first attacks will be cyber warfare
[2:27:39.560 --> 2:27:41.560]  attacks and then they're likely to use
[2:27:41.560 --> 2:27:43.560]  other off the shelf technologies,
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:45.560]  things like
[2:27:45.560 --> 2:27:47.560]  drones, for example, quadcopter
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:49.560]  drones and many EMPs
[2:27:49.560 --> 2:27:51.560]  and other many EMPs
[2:27:51.560 --> 2:27:53.560]  are a big threat. They've got a nuclear reactor
[2:27:53.560 --> 2:27:55.560]  with one of those as well.
[2:27:55.560 --> 2:27:57.560]  But I think they'll probably
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:27:59.560]  go for attacks on the infrastructure
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:01.560]  and they will
[2:28:01.560 --> 2:28:03.560]  go for the most the biggest bank for the
[2:28:03.560 --> 2:28:05.560]  buck basically. So don't we have a more
[2:28:05.560 --> 2:28:07.560]  responsibility to identify them and move against them?
[2:28:07.560 --> 2:28:09.560]  Well, yes, certainly
[2:28:09.560 --> 2:28:11.560]  we have to
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:13.560]  point out what's happening
[2:28:13.560 --> 2:28:15.560]  and we need to
[2:28:15.560 --> 2:28:17.560]  hopefully
[2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:19.560]  have a
[2:28:19.560 --> 2:28:21.560]  counter to them
[2:28:21.560 --> 2:28:23.560]  that won't end up destroying the
[2:28:23.560 --> 2:28:25.560]  Bill of Rights in the process. Unfortunately,
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:27.560]  we have a situation where
[2:28:27.560 --> 2:28:29.560]  the
[2:28:29.560 --> 2:28:31.560]  government tends to overreact
[2:28:31.560 --> 2:28:33.560]  the situation. Exactly.
[2:28:33.560 --> 2:28:35.560]  So the overreaction can be a dangerous threat to them.
[2:28:35.560 --> 2:28:37.560]  But then is it the answer to decapitation
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:39.560]  of the leadership of these groups
[2:28:39.560 --> 2:28:41.560]  that openly are criminals and calling for it?
[2:28:41.560 --> 2:28:43.560]  Aren't we morally responsible to start
[2:28:43.560 --> 2:28:45.560]  indicting these people?
[2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:47.560]  Well, I think some indictments at high level would be appropriate.
[2:28:47.560 --> 2:28:49.560]  But again, the groups
[2:28:49.560 --> 2:28:51.560]  have already started radicalizing
[2:28:51.560 --> 2:28:53.560]  and they're going to be splinter groups.
[2:28:53.560 --> 2:28:55.560]  So they're already wind up toys, already self-replicating.
[2:28:55.560 --> 2:28:57.560]  Right. And it'll be
[2:28:57.560 --> 2:28:59.560]  leaderless resistance, which is very hard
[2:28:59.560 --> 2:29:01.560]  to infiltrate, very hard to
[2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:03.560]  counter. And, you know, in the military
[2:29:03.560 --> 2:29:05.560]  we often talk
[2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:07.560]  about in terms of threat spirals.
[2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:09.560]  And a really good example
[2:29:09.560 --> 2:29:11.560]  that's analogous
[2:29:11.560 --> 2:29:13.560]  was what happened with roadside
[2:29:13.560 --> 2:29:15.560]  bombs in Afghanistan
[2:29:15.560 --> 2:29:17.560]  and Iraq, where
[2:29:17.560 --> 2:29:19.560]  the terrorists
[2:29:19.560 --> 2:29:21.560]  would set up IEDs
[2:29:21.560 --> 2:29:23.560]  improvised explosive devices
[2:29:23.560 --> 2:29:25.560]  and touch them off
[2:29:25.560 --> 2:29:27.560]  and try to blow up military convoys
[2:29:27.560 --> 2:29:29.560]  because our convoys were pretty tough.
[2:29:29.560 --> 2:29:31.560]  You know, they were very heavily armed.
[2:29:31.560 --> 2:29:33.560]  And if you were to take on a convoy
[2:29:33.560 --> 2:29:35.560]  with just small arms and RPGs, you'd lose.
[2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:37.560]  So they resorted to
[2:29:37.560 --> 2:29:39.560]  roadside bombs.
[2:29:39.560 --> 2:29:41.560]  And then they very quickly
[2:29:41.560 --> 2:29:43.560]  courtesy of the Iranian government
[2:29:43.560 --> 2:29:45.560]  Stay there, let's talk about that.
[2:29:45.560 --> 2:29:47.560]  They started perfecting what they were doing
[2:29:47.560 --> 2:30:05.560]  in their game.
[2:30:17.560 --> 2:30:19.560]  CNN is fake news. Infowars.com is real.
[2:30:19.560 --> 2:30:21.560]  You can also combine a CNN
[2:30:21.560 --> 2:30:23.560]  fake news sign with one of our CNN
[2:30:23.560 --> 2:30:25.560]  ISIS t-shirts, available now at
[2:30:25.560 --> 2:30:27.560]  InfowarsStore.com. The intent of the contest
[2:30:27.560 --> 2:30:29.560]  is to encourage you, the listener
[2:30:29.560 --> 2:30:31.560]  to realize that you have the power
[2:30:31.560 --> 2:30:33.560]  to save civilization from the criminal
[2:30:33.560 --> 2:30:35.560]  control and humanity in a fake news propaganda
[2:30:35.560 --> 2:30:37.560]  machine called CNN. The first thing to do
[2:30:37.560 --> 2:30:39.560]  is hammer the point to the public that CNN
[2:30:39.560 --> 2:30:41.560]  is fake news, which a CNN producer
[2:30:41.560 --> 2:30:43.560]  emitted on camera to James O'Keith
[2:30:43.560 --> 2:30:45.560]  and Project Veritas. We need to come together
[2:30:45.560 --> 2:30:47.560]  to remind the world that CNN simply
[2:30:47.560 --> 2:30:49.560]  regurgitates globalist propaganda
[2:30:49.560 --> 2:30:51.560]  thought up by multinational think tanks
[2:30:51.560 --> 2:30:53.560]  that is then fed to the public to suppress
[2:30:53.560 --> 2:30:55.560]  individual thought and run humanity into a ditch.

[2:30:59.560 --> 2:31:01.560]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[2:31:01.560 --> 2:31:03.560]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[2:31:03.560 --> 2:31:05.560]  It's the air we're breathing, especially
[2:31:05.560 --> 2:31:07.560]  for our children. The artificial particulates
[2:31:07.560 --> 2:31:09.560]  and the chemicals is absolutely
[2:31:09.560 --> 2:31:11.560]  weighing down our immune systems.
[2:31:11.560 --> 2:31:13.560]  The same team based right here
[2:31:13.560 --> 2:31:15.560]  in America that brought you the Alexa pure
[2:31:15.560 --> 2:31:41.560]  ground-breaking water filtration systems, have now developed Alexa pure breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers, your family, your children, to the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects for themselves. The general public doesn't.
[2:31:41.560 --> 2:31:43.560]  It's $300, $400, $500. One of these systems
[2:31:43.560 --> 2:31:45.560]  can keep 800 square feet
[2:31:45.560 --> 2:31:47.560]  incredibly clean. This is a system I'm
[2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:49.560]  personally putting in throughout my house, replacing
[2:31:49.560 --> 2:31:51.560]  older, more expensive filters that
[2:31:51.560 --> 2:31:53.560]  didn't do as good a job.
[2:31:53.560 --> 2:31:55.560]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary
[2:31:55.560 --> 2:31:57.560]  today at InfowarsStore.com
[2:31:59.560 --> 2:32:01.560]  The reason Infowars Live
[2:32:01.560 --> 2:32:03.560]  has 5 star ratings on major third party sites
[2:32:03.560 --> 2:32:05.560]  is because I want products I'm going to use for my family.
[2:32:05.560 --> 2:32:07.560]  I take this. My family takes this.
[2:32:07.560 --> 2:32:09.560]  And then it funds the operation
[2:32:09.560 --> 2:32:11.560]  with the most hardcore, truthful information
[2:32:11.560 --> 2:32:13.560]  you're going to find anywhere. So what you find in our news
[2:32:13.560 --> 2:32:15.560]  is the same thing you find in our
[2:32:15.560 --> 2:32:17.560]  products at InfowarsLive.com
[2:32:17.560 --> 2:32:19.560]  If I ever forget to take them,
[2:32:19.560 --> 2:32:21.560]  I have a noticeable difference.
[2:32:21.560 --> 2:32:23.560]  I don't feel good. The nascent iodine
[2:32:23.560 --> 2:32:25.560]  is one of the ones that was life changing
[2:32:25.560 --> 2:32:27.560]  for me. Yeah, I've actually
[2:32:27.560 --> 2:32:29.560]  just run out of my superfemale. I had
[2:32:29.560 --> 2:32:31.560]  a few bottles at my house
[2:32:31.560 --> 2:32:33.560]  and I've been taking it again, hitting the gym
[2:32:33.560 --> 2:32:35.560]  once again. Very
[2:32:35.560 --> 2:32:37.560]  exciting, feeling great, looking good.
[2:32:37.560 --> 2:32:39.560]  And I know my hair is
[2:32:39.560 --> 2:32:41.560]  luxurious once again.
[2:32:41.560 --> 2:32:43.560]  So obviously the superfemale is amazing.
[2:32:43.560 --> 2:32:45.560]  I love it. Nascent iodine
[2:32:45.560 --> 2:32:47.560]  is essential. Survival Shield
[2:32:47.560 --> 2:32:49.560]  X2. If there's one product that I would say
[2:32:49.560 --> 2:32:51.560]  is life changing, that I would suggest it's
[2:32:51.560 --> 2:32:53.560]  nascent iodine, Survival Shield
[2:32:53.560 --> 2:32:55.560]  X2. It's got a 5 star rating.
[2:32:55.560 --> 2:32:57.560]  It's a win-win
[2:32:57.560 --> 2:33:13.560]  at InfowarsLive.com
[2:33:13.560 --> 2:33:15.560]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[2:33:15.560 --> 2:33:17.560]  you are the resistance.
[2:33:21.560 --> 2:33:23.560]  You know what's crazy?
[2:33:23.560 --> 2:33:25.560]  I don't say this like it's some big
[2:33:25.560 --> 2:33:27.560]  red for myself or
[2:33:27.560 --> 2:33:29.560]  it's just a fact. I found it so
[2:33:29.560 --> 2:33:31.560]  offensive when the KKK would come to Waco
[2:33:31.560 --> 2:33:33.560]  or San Antonio or Austin. The videos are on
[2:33:33.560 --> 2:33:35.560]  YouTube. I mean, I've been to more than
[2:33:35.560 --> 2:33:37.560]  15 KKK events to protest
[2:33:37.560 --> 2:33:39.560]  and bull on them.
[2:33:39.560 --> 2:33:41.560]  And that's because I knew that
[2:33:41.560 --> 2:33:43.560]  ADL, Southern Property Law Center, and the
[2:33:43.560 --> 2:33:45.560]  feds were involved. And then some people
[2:33:45.560 --> 2:33:47.560]  accused of being feds later came out
[2:33:47.560 --> 2:33:49.560]  leading the KKK were feds.
[2:33:49.560 --> 2:33:51.560]  I mean, the KKK was super
[2:33:51.560 --> 2:33:53.560]  uncool when my dad
[2:33:53.560 --> 2:33:55.560]  was a child in East Texas
[2:33:55.560 --> 2:33:57.560]  and his dad came back from World War II
[2:33:57.560 --> 2:33:59.560]  and the full family
[2:33:59.560 --> 2:34:01.560]  of Democrats, they weren't involved in the racist stuff
[2:34:01.560 --> 2:34:03.560]  and he said, I'm going to go with Eisenhower
[2:34:03.560 --> 2:34:05.560]  and be a Republican and
[2:34:05.560 --> 2:34:07.560]  they were involved in actually
[2:34:07.560 --> 2:34:09.560]  ending that.
[2:34:09.560 --> 2:34:11.560]  So it's just crazy. I like protest the KKK,
[2:34:11.560 --> 2:34:13.560]  my family's involved
[2:34:13.560 --> 2:34:15.560]  in ending the Jim Crow
[2:34:15.560 --> 2:34:17.560]  laws here in Texas
[2:34:17.560 --> 2:34:19.560]  and they turn it around
[2:34:19.560 --> 2:34:21.560]  and go, Alex Jones is deeply racist
[2:34:21.560 --> 2:34:23.560]  and then CNN runs the headline
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:25.560]  former KKK leader praises
[2:34:25.560 --> 2:34:27.560]  Trump for appointing Vannon
[2:34:27.560 --> 2:34:29.560]  and they put Alex Jones under it
[2:34:31.560 --> 2:34:33.560]  and people picked that up thinking
[2:34:33.560 --> 2:34:35.560]  I'm a KKK leader. This is the level
[2:34:35.560 --> 2:34:37.560]  of deception
[2:34:37.560 --> 2:34:39.560]  and my lawyer goes, yeah, you can sue him, but they don't care.
[2:34:39.560 --> 2:34:41.560]  And now they're being sued
[2:34:41.560 --> 2:34:43.560]  by Scaramucci for saying he's a Russian agent
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:45.560]  because we have proof that they knew it was a lie.
[2:34:45.560 --> 2:34:47.560]  One of the Trump administration
[2:34:47.560 --> 2:34:49.560]  officials, so
[2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:51.560]  people say, well, you better back off. No, I mean, I'm not
[2:34:51.560 --> 2:34:53.560]  in the KKK.
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:34:55.560]  I have nothing to do with it
[2:34:55.560 --> 2:34:57.560]  and if CNN wants to put that
[2:34:57.560 --> 2:34:59.560]  under my name, man, that's their problem.
[2:34:59.560 --> 2:35:01.560]  They want to roll Tom Brokaw
[2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:03.560]  out and say, I'm deeply racist.
[2:35:03.560 --> 2:35:05.560]  Thank you so much for the coffee. I forgot to get that.
[2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:07.560]  It smells good.
[2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:09.560]  Going to a plug, but it is
[2:35:09.560 --> 2:35:11.560]  our southern Mexico
[2:35:11.560 --> 2:35:13.560]  high mountains, the opposite. It's basically like
[2:35:13.560 --> 2:35:15.560]  Guatemalan, but it's not been over fertilized
[2:35:15.560 --> 2:35:17.560]  overused and it's just
[2:35:17.560 --> 2:35:19.560]  delicious. So wake up American coffee
[2:35:19.560 --> 2:35:21.560]  available at infowarestore.com and your purchase of it
[2:35:21.560 --> 2:35:23.560]  makes the broadcast possible.
[2:35:23.560 --> 2:35:25.560]  But people say to me
[2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:27.560]  like, how are you taking it? I mean, man,
[2:35:27.560 --> 2:35:29.560]  what's it like to have Tom Brokaw call you
[2:35:29.560 --> 2:35:31.560]  an unalloyed racist, which means a complete racist.
[2:35:31.560 --> 2:35:33.560]  I'm like, I love the part
[2:35:33.560 --> 2:35:35.560]  where he didn't show me actually saying anything racist.
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:37.560]  You know, it's like
[2:35:37.560 --> 2:35:39.560]  the great unifier is free market
[2:35:39.560 --> 2:35:41.560]  and open society and Christianity
[2:35:41.560 --> 2:35:43.560]  through Christianity that allows
[2:35:43.560 --> 2:35:45.560]  you to have freedom.
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:47.560]  That's where it all comes from. Freedom comes from God.
[2:35:47.560 --> 2:35:49.560]  And
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:51.560]  no, it's like if they call me a child molester.
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:53.560]  I mean, that's the thing they haven't done yet, but I mean, it's not true.
[2:35:53.560 --> 2:35:55.560]  Or call me a rapist.
[2:35:55.560 --> 2:35:57.560]  You know, I mean, whatever makeup, whatever you want,
[2:35:57.560 --> 2:35:59.560]  that's not who I am. I want to
[2:35:59.560 --> 2:36:01.560]  talk to James Leslie Rawls briefly about that. They go to Catherine
[2:36:01.560 --> 2:36:03.560]  Carlos, Jeff, Lynn, Joe
[2:36:03.560 --> 2:36:05.560]  and others. I've got to get him on soon about
[2:36:05.560 --> 2:36:07.560]  some of his best selling novels where he says a lot
[2:36:07.560 --> 2:36:09.560]  of stuff you couldn't say in
[2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:11.560]  nonfiction, in fiction.
[2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:13.560]  Briefly
[2:36:13.560 --> 2:36:15.560]  infowarsstore.com
[2:36:15.560 --> 2:36:17.560]  free shipping. You know, I'm extending it
[2:36:17.560 --> 2:36:19.560]  sorry, I don't do
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:21.560]  free shipping, but a few times a year. I'm extending it through the whole month of
[2:36:21.560 --> 2:36:23.560]  July because we're capitalizing right now.
[2:36:23.560 --> 2:36:25.560]  People like sales.
[2:36:25.560 --> 2:36:27.560]  We're trying to fund, hiring a bunch of reporters, building
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:29.560]  new studios, a lot of new things
[2:36:29.560 --> 2:36:31.560]  in the face of the enemy and
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:33.560]  we don't like raise prices
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:35.560]  and then lower them and call it a sale.
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:37.560]  We keep it at one price and when we have a sale, it's real.
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:39.560]  30% off
[2:36:39.560 --> 2:36:41.560]  the toxin

[2:36:43.560 --> 2:36:45.560]  amazing zeolite, shellage and more

[2:36:47.560 --> 2:36:49.560]  That's amazing. The detoxify that's

[2:36:51.560 --> 2:36:53.560]  MycoZX is back in after
[2:36:53.560 --> 2:36:55.560]  five plus months sold out
[2:36:55.560 --> 2:36:57.560]  talk about next level probiotic. It's
[2:36:57.560 --> 2:36:59.560]  the anti fungus, anti yeast,
[2:36:59.560 --> 2:37:01.560]  latest technology of 4.8 stars.
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:03.560]  It's been sold out for months
[2:37:03.560 --> 2:37:05.560]  big waiting list, limited amount because it's so
[2:37:05.560 --> 2:37:07.560]  hard to get the compounds and to have it be
[2:37:07.560 --> 2:37:09.560]  California standards. Nobody's got something this good.
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:11.560]  It's 30% off
[2:37:11.560 --> 2:37:13.560]  when you get it with the 50 billion

[2:37:23.560 --> 2:37:25.560]  or AAA-2533139.
[2:37:25.560 --> 2:37:27.560]  I know caveman, top selling
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:29.560]  bone broth formula has been sold out for months. That should be
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:31.560]  insane. But again,
[2:37:31.560 --> 2:37:33.560]  we have the highest standards
[2:37:33.560 --> 2:37:35.560]  and the best labs in the country. I know I'm a target of the
[2:37:35.560 --> 2:37:37.560]  FDA and I want you to have
[2:37:37.560 --> 2:37:39.560]  the best products but quite frankly,
[2:37:39.560 --> 2:37:41.560]  I want it to work really well too so you keep buying it.
[2:37:41.560 --> 2:37:43.560]  Wow, what an original thought. I want a long
[2:37:43.560 --> 2:37:45.560]  term relationship with you. I take
[2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:47.560]  this, my children take this
[2:37:47.560 --> 2:37:49.560]  infowarslife.com
[2:37:49.560 --> 2:37:53.560]  infowarsstore.com or AAA-2533139.
[2:37:53.560 --> 2:37:54.560]  I'm going back to James
[2:37:54.560 --> 2:37:55.560]  Buzzley Rawls
[2:37:55.560 --> 2:37:57.560]  before we take some calls. Other big
[2:37:57.560 --> 2:37:59.560]  issues that are front and center for you,
[2:37:59.560 --> 2:38:01.560]  your sources, your intel.
[2:38:01.560 --> 2:38:03.560]  Do you agree with
[2:38:03.560 --> 2:38:05.560]  me that we're seeing massive global awakening?
[2:38:05.560 --> 2:38:07.560]  I think Trump's turned the corner on Russia.
[2:38:07.560 --> 2:38:09.560]  He's going on the offense.
[2:38:09.560 --> 2:38:11.560]  Or what's your gut tell you?
[2:38:11.560 --> 2:38:13.560]  Well, I think we're definitely
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:15.560]  winning and
[2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:17.560]  we've definitely turned the corner in some
[2:38:17.560 --> 2:38:19.560]  areas but the
[2:38:19.560 --> 2:38:21.560]  terrorist threat
[2:38:21.560 --> 2:38:23.560]  that's emerging with antifa
[2:38:23.560 --> 2:38:25.560]  and Black Lives Matter
[2:38:25.560 --> 2:38:27.560]  and or combinations thereof
[2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:29.560]  I think cannot be overstated.
[2:38:29.560 --> 2:38:31.560]  And unfortunately
[2:38:31.560 --> 2:38:33.560]  if you look back at the history of the late
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:35.560]  60s and the early 70s
[2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:37.560]  it was the government counteraction
[2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:39.560]  to that that brought us
[2:38:39.560 --> 2:38:41.560]  metal detectors in airports
[2:38:41.560 --> 2:38:43.560]  and then later
[2:38:43.560 --> 2:38:45.560]  metal detectors in federal court buildings
[2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:47.560]  and
[2:38:47.560 --> 2:38:49.560]  the logical progression of that
[2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:51.560]  just kept going.
[2:38:51.560 --> 2:38:53.560]  Now we have a federal
[2:38:53.560 --> 2:38:55.560]  agency, the TSA,
[2:38:55.560 --> 2:38:57.560]  instead of private contractors running those metal
[2:38:57.560 --> 2:38:59.560]  detectors at the airports and they get more and more
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:01.560]  intrusive with every passing year.
[2:39:01.560 --> 2:39:03.560]  I mean, the answer is
[2:39:03.560 --> 2:39:05.560]  target radical Islamists
[2:39:05.560 --> 2:39:07.560]  and don't let them in, right?
[2:39:07.560 --> 2:39:09.560]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:39:09.560 --> 2:39:11.560]  But again
[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:13.560]  there's already been a degradation
[2:39:13.560 --> 2:39:15.560]  of our freedom and I'm afraid that if we look
[2:39:15.560 --> 2:39:17.560]  at the threat spirals that will
[2:39:17.560 --> 2:39:19.560]  likely come out of antifa
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:21.560]  terrorism it's probably
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:23.560]  going to be very detrimental
[2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:25.560]  detrimental to our personal freedom here
[2:39:25.560 --> 2:39:27.560]  in the United States. Well expanding on that, that's
[2:39:27.560 --> 2:39:29.560]  my next question.
[2:39:29.560 --> 2:39:31.560]  I know it's worked in the Arab Spring for Soros,
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:33.560]  it's worked in Eastern Europe.
[2:39:33.560 --> 2:39:35.560]  They're really trying to run the same playbook but with an
[2:39:35.560 --> 2:39:37.560]  armed society with patriots
[2:39:37.560 --> 2:39:39.560]  long before we were, you know,
[2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:41.560]  out of high school and before we were born
[2:39:41.560 --> 2:39:43.560]  and people like very Goldwater
[2:39:43.560 --> 2:39:45.560]  laying all this out. We've got such a jump
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:47.560]  on them that as every
[2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:49.560]  step of globalism comes true
[2:39:49.560 --> 2:39:51.560]  the patriot movement's credibility
[2:39:51.560 --> 2:39:53.560]  is stratospheric right now.
[2:39:53.560 --> 2:39:55.560]  I mean, don't they get
[2:39:55.560 --> 2:39:57.560]  that we've got major jump on them?
[2:39:57.560 --> 2:39:59.560]  No, I don't
[2:39:59.560 --> 2:40:01.560]  think they really appreciate the fact that
[2:40:01.560 --> 2:40:03.560]  we outgun them
[2:40:03.560 --> 2:40:05.560]  seriously and
[2:40:05.560 --> 2:40:07.560]  anyone who thinks they're going to try to
[2:40:07.560 --> 2:40:09.560]  institute tyranny on this nation
[2:40:09.560 --> 2:40:11.560]  is a fool because we have a very well
[2:40:11.560 --> 2:40:13.560]  society that's
[2:40:13.560 --> 2:40:15.560]  waking up. Have they taken our
[2:40:15.560 --> 2:40:17.560]  restraint for weakness?
[2:40:17.560 --> 2:40:19.560]  Perhaps they
[2:40:19.560 --> 2:40:21.560]  have and I think
[2:40:21.560 --> 2:40:23.560]  that because we have
[2:40:23.560 --> 2:40:25.560]  inherent restraint as a Christian
[2:40:25.560 --> 2:40:27.560]  nation, they look
[2:40:27.560 --> 2:40:29.560]  at our
[2:40:29.560 --> 2:40:31.560]  reluctance to
[2:40:31.560 --> 2:40:33.560]  meet groups like Antifa
[2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:35.560]  toe-to-toe with baseball bats on the city streets
[2:40:35.560 --> 2:40:37.560]  as a sign of weakness.
[2:40:37.560 --> 2:40:39.560]  It's not, it's a sign of restraint on our part.
[2:40:39.560 --> 2:40:41.560]  Oh, I look at these people, I'm not even the toughest
[2:40:41.560 --> 2:40:43.560]  guy around but I mean, I could kill
[2:40:43.560 --> 2:40:45.560]  but let's just be honest
[2:40:45.560 --> 2:40:47.560]  they're like children. I could take
[2:40:47.560 --> 2:40:49.560]  on 20 of these guys. It's not that I'm that strong
[2:40:49.560 --> 2:40:51.560]  they're that pathetic.
[2:40:51.560 --> 2:40:53.560]  Have you seen them walk up to a woman and hit her in the head with a bike lock?
[2:40:53.560 --> 2:40:55.560]  I mean, these are the most
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:40:57.560]  chicken-necked, cowardly
[2:40:57.560 --> 2:40:59.560]  little pieces of garbage.
[2:40:59.560 --> 2:41:01.560]  Yeah, it is kind
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:03.560]  of pathetic but unfortunately their next
[2:41:03.560 --> 2:41:05.560]  weapons won't be bike locks.
[2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:07.560]  They'll be bombs with the nails.
[2:41:07.560 --> 2:41:09.560]  And I'll go so far
[2:41:09.560 --> 2:41:11.560]  to make a prediction and that is
[2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:13.560]  that what will come out of this
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:15.560]  will be a transformation
[2:41:15.560 --> 2:41:17.560]  of how public events
[2:41:17.560 --> 2:41:19.560]  are held in America.
[2:41:19.560 --> 2:41:21.560]  They're going to use this to shut down the First Amendment
[2:41:21.560 --> 2:41:23.560]  public assembly.
[2:41:23.560 --> 2:41:25.560]  Yeah, and I think that
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:27.560]  just the whole concept of a politician
[2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:29.560]  making a speech in open air
[2:41:29.560 --> 2:41:31.560]  will become a thing of the past because all it'll take
[2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:33.560]  is one terrorist event
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:35.560]  with a little quadricopter
[2:41:35.560 --> 2:41:37.560]  zooming in and exploding
[2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:39.560]  over the head of a politician
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:41.560]  and you have the downdraft
[2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:43.560]  from all those
[2:41:43.560 --> 2:41:45.560]  four blades, four rotors
[2:41:45.560 --> 2:41:47.560]  on that quadricopter
[2:41:47.560 --> 2:41:49.560]  it's going to blow up
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:51.560]  a toxin in a 12 to 20 foot radius
[2:41:51.560 --> 2:41:53.560]  and kill everyone
[2:41:53.560 --> 2:41:55.560]  in that radius.
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:41:57.560]  We won't see open air
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:41:59.560]  political speeches in this country anymore
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:01.560]  after that sort of event.
[2:42:01.560 --> 2:42:03.560]  Unbelievable.
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:05.560]  And again, they're bringing in radical Islam
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:07.560]  they're bringing in Orthodox Islam
[2:42:07.560 --> 2:42:09.560]  they're bringing in leftist and letting them do it
[2:42:09.560 --> 2:42:11.560]  so they can then take our rights and I
[2:42:11.560 --> 2:42:13.560]  I know most the people
[2:42:13.560 --> 2:42:15.560]  in government actually don't want this to happen
[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:17.560]  because I've always been critical
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:19.560]  of police states
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:21.560]  and critical government being bad
[2:42:21.560 --> 2:42:23.560]  then they spend it that I just hate everybody in the government
[2:42:23.560 --> 2:42:25.560]  no, it's the opposite. I'm not allowed people in government
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:27.560]  are actually more informed and care more than general public
[2:42:27.560 --> 2:42:29.560]  but still it's the people on top directing
[2:42:29.560 --> 2:42:31.560]  all this. We can't put up with this
[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:33.560]  we have to shut down the Islamic
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:35.560]  scourge, we have to shut down
[2:42:35.560 --> 2:42:37.560]  the trigger events that are going to be used
[2:42:37.560 --> 2:42:39.560]  to put a noose around our children
[2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:41.560]  and our children's children's necks
[2:42:41.560 --> 2:42:43.560]  do you agree with that?
[2:42:43.560 --> 2:42:45.560]  I agree wholeheartedly and what's really
[2:42:45.560 --> 2:42:47.560]  required as you pointed out time and time again
[2:42:47.560 --> 2:42:49.560]  is
[2:42:49.560 --> 2:42:51.560]  positive vetting of every immigrant
[2:42:51.560 --> 2:42:53.560]  coming into the country
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:55.560]  and strict border
[2:42:55.560 --> 2:42:57.560]  controls. Without that we are
[2:42:57.560 --> 2:42:59.560]  defenseless in the modern era.
[2:42:59.560 --> 2:43:01.560]  And that's globalist weapon is bringing in third world populations
[2:43:01.560 --> 2:43:03.560]  that they know 90% convert
[2:43:03.560 --> 2:43:05.560]  to their leftist ideology and it is just
[2:43:05.560 --> 2:43:07.560]  a weapon being formed against us and
[2:43:07.560 --> 2:43:09.560]  that's why
[2:43:09.560 --> 2:43:11.560]  quite frankly I always saw the police
[2:43:11.560 --> 2:43:13.560]  in military despite their talk
[2:43:13.560 --> 2:43:15.560]  would go with the globalists. They in the last few years
[2:43:15.560 --> 2:43:17.560]  have gone with the liberty movement
[2:43:17.560 --> 2:43:19.560]  thanks to us getting the word out, you getting the word out
[2:43:19.560 --> 2:43:21.560]  Americana the rediscovering of it
[2:43:21.560 --> 2:43:23.560]  it's 1776 worldwide
[2:43:23.560 --> 2:43:25.560]  it's been adopted because it's not like we're that good
[2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:27.560]  it's what we're promoting is so much better
[2:43:27.560 --> 2:43:29.560]  than globalism and so I really got
[2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:31.560]  handed to the military and police overall
[2:43:31.560 --> 2:43:33.560]  they are the most receptive
[2:43:33.560 --> 2:43:35.560]  and I don't want to sit there and just give platitudes
[2:43:35.560 --> 2:43:37.560]  for no reason but I think we have to recognize
[2:43:37.560 --> 2:43:39.560]  that that was somewhere I was really
[2:43:39.560 --> 2:43:41.560]  wrong. I saw the state
[2:43:41.560 --> 2:43:43.560]  control and the globalism control
[2:43:43.560 --> 2:43:45.560]  as a threat so I by default
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:47.560]  saw the police military as a threat
[2:43:47.560 --> 2:43:49.560]  even though a lot of my family were police and military
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:51.560]  but I got to say at the end of the day they came
[2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:53.560]  they've come through so far.
[2:43:53.560 --> 2:43:55.560]  Well yes I
[2:43:55.560 --> 2:43:57.560]  have to agree with you there and there
[2:43:57.560 --> 2:43:59.560]  there are good elements and bad elements
[2:43:59.560 --> 2:44:01.560]  in no matter where you go
[2:44:01.560 --> 2:44:03.560]  and certainly within government
[2:44:03.560 --> 2:44:05.560]  in police organizations in the military
[2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:07.560]  in the intelligence community
[2:44:07.560 --> 2:44:09.560]  I think the majority of the people there
[2:44:09.560 --> 2:44:11.560]  are good solid
[2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:13.560]  patriotic citizens
[2:44:13.560 --> 2:44:15.560]  but there's a few who have been co-opted
[2:44:15.560 --> 2:44:17.560]  and they really are
[2:44:17.560 --> 2:44:19.560]  wolves in sheep's clothing
[2:44:19.560 --> 2:44:21.560]  and the biggest thing that illustrates
[2:44:21.560 --> 2:44:23.560]  how good Trump is
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:25.560]  is notice James Wesley Rawls of survivalblog.com
[2:44:25.560 --> 2:44:27.560]  for new listeners who just tuned in
[2:44:27.560 --> 2:44:29.560]  how the elite hate Trump
[2:44:29.560 --> 2:44:31.560]  how they're blocking input new people in
[2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:33.560]  that to me is the real certification
[2:44:33.560 --> 2:44:35.560]  absolutely
[2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:37.560]  one last thing and we're going to Catherine
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:39.560]  Carlos, Jeff, Lynn, Joe
[2:44:39.560 --> 2:44:41.560]  and others are going to go right when this hour ends
[2:44:41.560 --> 2:44:43.560]  I'm going to host a little bit with Mike Sernovich coming up
[2:44:43.560 --> 2:44:45.560]  we'll soon have his own show I'd like to invite you to host
[2:44:45.560 --> 2:44:47.560]  more of this as well James
[2:44:47.560 --> 2:44:49.560]  as I'm trying to develop this whole network
[2:44:49.560 --> 2:44:51.560]  but I get so busy with the daily work I never get to the
[2:44:51.560 --> 2:44:53.560]  launching of a new thing what's going to happen in the next few months
[2:44:53.560 --> 2:44:55.560]  this is on infowars.com
[2:44:55.560 --> 2:44:57.560]  the left prepares for war
[2:44:57.560 --> 2:44:59.560]  with new self-defense
[2:44:59.560 --> 2:45:01.560]  training club
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:03.560]  this is in Chicago
[2:45:03.560 --> 2:45:05.560]  these are sprouting up everywhere and I talked to gun shop owners
[2:45:05.560 --> 2:45:07.560]  liberals are coming in they're in the news saying I'm buying guns
[2:45:07.560 --> 2:45:09.560]  to fight Trump supporters
[2:45:09.560 --> 2:45:11.560]  now that's not good that shows they're radicalizing
[2:45:11.560 --> 2:45:13.560]  but the fact that they're trying to
[2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:15.560]  individually take action
[2:45:15.560 --> 2:45:17.560]  and individually realize that
[2:45:17.560 --> 2:45:19.560]  they've got to take care of themselves
[2:45:19.560 --> 2:45:21.560]  is it that in a way kind of like
[2:45:21.560 --> 2:45:23.560]  them starting to wake up
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:25.560]  at least to a certain point where they might
[2:45:25.560 --> 2:45:27.560]  actually then realize our point of view
[2:45:27.560 --> 2:45:29.560]  or are they just too stupid
[2:45:29.560 --> 2:45:31.560]  well I think
[2:45:31.560 --> 2:45:33.560]  by becoming gun owners a lot of them
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:35.560]  are going to end up at shooting ranges
[2:45:35.560 --> 2:45:37.560]  and they're going to be around
[2:45:37.560 --> 2:45:39.560]  the bedrock culture and they may
[2:45:39.560 --> 2:45:41.560]  have an epiphanous moment
[2:45:41.560 --> 2:45:43.560]  where they realize
[2:45:43.560 --> 2:45:45.560]  wait a minute the people I'm
[2:45:45.560 --> 2:45:47.560]  training alongside here
[2:45:47.560 --> 2:45:49.560]  are actually pretty nice folks
[2:45:49.560 --> 2:45:51.560]  what am I really doing here
[2:45:51.560 --> 2:45:53.560]  and I think that kind of epiphany
[2:45:53.560 --> 2:45:55.560]  will happen with a lot of these
[2:45:55.560 --> 2:45:57.560]  self-radicalizing
[2:45:57.560 --> 2:45:59.560]  leftists
[2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:01.560]  I agree they're giving up faith in their god government
[2:46:01.560 --> 2:46:03.560]  now going to the trenches
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:05.560]  and in the trenches they'll find their humanity
[2:46:05.560 --> 2:46:07.560]  absolutely yeah that's
[2:46:07.560 --> 2:46:09.560]  that's a correct assessment
[2:46:09.560 --> 2:46:11.560]  powerful the truth is powerful
[2:46:11.560 --> 2:46:13.560]  it's universal
[2:46:13.560 --> 2:46:15.560]  it's like life and death are great unifiers
[2:46:15.560 --> 2:46:17.560]  truth is a great unifier
[2:46:17.560 --> 2:46:19.560]  and all we're offering is the truth nothing more
[2:46:19.560 --> 2:46:21.560]  I want to play these clips on them fullwords.com
[2:46:21.560 --> 2:46:23.560]  this is left to social justice warriors
[2:46:23.560 --> 2:46:25.560]  trying to get funding they got funding
[2:46:25.560 --> 2:46:27.560]  they've launched
[2:46:27.560 --> 2:46:29.560]  autonomy, strength and solidarity
[2:46:29.560 --> 2:46:31.560]  to quote fight the Nazis
[2:46:31.560 --> 2:46:33.560]  and then I love how it's sorrows
[2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:35.560]  and globalists and the Rockefellers funding them
[2:46:35.560 --> 2:46:37.560]  and the EU's run by Junker
[2:46:37.560 --> 2:46:39.560]  whose family ran the Nazi empire
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:41.560]  I mean it's like
[2:46:41.560 --> 2:46:43.560]  they think they're fighting the Nazis
[2:46:43.560 --> 2:46:45.560]  they're fighting America
[2:46:45.560 --> 2:46:47.560]  let's go to part of this clip some of the most
[2:46:47.560 --> 2:46:49.560]  unofficial comedy in the galaxy
[2:46:49.560 --> 2:46:51.560]  so Haymaker is an autonomous
[2:46:51.560 --> 2:46:53.560]  gym that's starting up now in Chicago
[2:46:53.560 --> 2:46:55.560]  the aim is to establish
[2:46:55.560 --> 2:46:57.560]  more networks of self-defense
[2:46:57.560 --> 2:46:59.560]  we're trying to develop self-defense skills
[2:46:59.560 --> 2:47:01.560]  in a political climate that's increasingly violent
[2:47:01.560 --> 2:47:03.560]  especially towards marginalized people
[2:47:03.560 --> 2:47:05.560]  people who are not in power
[2:47:05.560 --> 2:47:07.560]  the poor, the oppressed
[2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:09.560]  we're investing in building material force of resistance
[2:47:09.560 --> 2:47:11.560]  against the rising nature of fascism in this country
[2:47:11.560 --> 2:47:13.560]  and obviously the longer history of white supremacy
[2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:15.560]  and so we're really investing in cultivating
[2:47:15.560 --> 2:47:17.560]  the capacities for our bodies
[2:47:17.560 --> 2:47:19.560]  to be stronger
[2:47:19.560 --> 2:47:21.560]  because at the end of the day it's stronger
[2:47:21.560 --> 2:47:23.560]  for people to kill
[2:47:23.560 --> 2:47:25.560]  a lot of people think like when you learn how to fight
[2:47:25.560 --> 2:47:27.560]  you've got to fight because
[2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:29.560]  the democrats all of Chicago went and beat everybody up
[2:47:29.560 --> 2:47:31.560]  dude, you're the ones doing the violence
[2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:33.560]  the bodily instincts to be able to
[2:47:33.560 --> 2:47:35.560]  react in a situation
[2:47:35.560 --> 2:47:37.560]  where we might be put in danger
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:39.560]  the bodily instincts
[2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:41.560]  we should have thrown a punch
[2:47:43.560 --> 2:47:45.560]  these kids were kept in
[2:47:45.560 --> 2:47:47.560]  their beds
[2:47:47.560 --> 2:47:49.560]  they weren't given breast milk
[2:47:49.560 --> 2:47:55.560]  they didn't mean to turn it up
[2:47:55.560 --> 2:47:57.560]  we're trying to build a
[2:47:57.560 --> 2:47:59.560]  space for people who may not be
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:01.560]  accepted into this kind of
[2:48:01.560 --> 2:48:03.560]  heteronormative
[2:48:03.560 --> 2:48:05.560]  bubble-based
[2:48:05.560 --> 2:48:07.560]  I'm talking to Priests
[2:48:07.560 --> 2:48:09.560]  they've never gone hiking
[2:48:09.560 --> 2:48:11.560]  they've never shot a gun
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:13.560]  that's why they want to keep your development arrested
[2:48:13.560 --> 2:48:15.560]  because I noticed the leftists are like
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:17.560]  the most insular bubble people
[2:48:17.560 --> 2:48:19.560]  scared of everything
[2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:21.560]  we're a broad, open, public-facing
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:23.560]  popular self-defense project
[2:48:23.560 --> 2:48:25.560]  so it's Haymaker Chai
[2:48:25.560 --> 2:48:27.560]  at riseup.net
[2:48:27.560 --> 2:48:29.560]  so they want to ban militias and guns
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:31.560]  but now they're doing the plank
[2:48:31.560 --> 2:48:33.560]  preparing for battle
[2:48:33.560 --> 2:48:35.560]  similar projects in other cities
[2:48:35.560 --> 2:48:37.560]  so we're ready invested in
[2:48:37.560 --> 2:48:39.560]  beyond the local context of Chicago
[2:48:39.560 --> 2:48:41.560]  they're in the murder capital of the world
[2:48:41.560 --> 2:48:43.560]  where they've taken the guns
[2:48:43.560 --> 2:48:45.560]  within our organizing collective
[2:48:45.560 --> 2:48:47.560]  we don't necessarily have
[2:48:47.560 --> 2:48:49.560]  we can't speak to all the different
[2:48:49.560 --> 2:48:51.560]  problems I guess
[2:48:51.560 --> 2:48:53.560]  it's not a joke
[2:48:53.560 --> 2:48:55.560]  use Haymaker as a space
[2:48:55.560 --> 2:48:57.560]  to organize with other groups
[2:48:57.560 --> 2:48:59.560]  in order to advance the broader cause
[2:48:59.560 --> 2:49:01.560]  I guess of self-defense
[2:49:01.560 --> 2:49:03.560]  self-defense when it's the left doing
[2:49:03.560 --> 2:49:05.560]  99% of the violence
[2:49:05.560 --> 2:49:07.560]  James Jose Rawls your comments on that
[2:49:07.560 --> 2:49:09.560]  well
[2:49:09.560 --> 2:49:11.560]  while their initial organizing efforts
[2:49:11.560 --> 2:49:13.560]  look kind of pathetic
[2:49:13.560 --> 2:49:15.560]  I particularly like
[2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:17.560]  that floral pattern on the guy's hat
[2:49:17.560 --> 2:49:19.560]  perhaps they ought to adopt that as their camouflage
[2:49:19.560 --> 2:49:21.560]  pattern
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:23.560]  that's yeah
[2:49:23.560 --> 2:49:25.560]  no seriously
[2:49:25.560 --> 2:49:27.560]  what's important is
[2:49:27.560 --> 2:49:29.560]  their ideology
[2:49:29.560 --> 2:49:31.560]  and their level of commitment
[2:49:31.560 --> 2:49:33.560]  and it's just I think they will
[2:49:33.560 --> 2:49:35.560]  use force multipliers rather than
[2:49:35.560 --> 2:49:37.560]  physical force
[2:49:37.560 --> 2:49:39.560]  and if you look at the history
[2:49:39.560 --> 2:49:41.560]  of the 20th century and the use of force multipliers
[2:49:41.560 --> 2:49:43.560]  like explosives
[2:49:43.560 --> 2:49:45.560]  and electronic warfare and so on
[2:49:45.560 --> 2:49:47.560]  but I agree these are cowards
[2:49:47.560 --> 2:49:49.560]  not these guys but other folks
[2:49:49.560 --> 2:49:51.560]  they're going to go with poison
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:53.560]  yeah I think they'll very likely use toxins
[2:49:53.560 --> 2:49:55.560]  they'll use explosives
[2:49:55.560 --> 2:49:57.560]  they'll use electronic warfare
[2:49:57.560 --> 2:49:59.560]  they'll use
[2:49:59.560 --> 2:50:01.560]  any number of different means
[2:50:01.560 --> 2:50:03.560]  as force multipliers
[2:50:05.560 --> 2:50:07.560]  because again they want more
[2:50:07.560 --> 2:50:09.560]  bang for the buck and they want to be
[2:50:09.560 --> 2:50:11.560]  absent when the police show up
[2:50:11.560 --> 2:50:13.560]  so they'll be doing things with time delay
[2:50:13.560 --> 2:50:15.560]  or remotely
[2:50:15.560 --> 2:50:17.560]  so their base psychology is
[2:50:17.560 --> 2:50:19.560]  arrested development and cowardice
[2:50:19.560 --> 2:50:21.560]  so everything else is going to flow out of that
[2:50:21.560 --> 2:50:23.560]  right and it's just a logical
[2:50:23.560 --> 2:50:25.560]  progression
[2:50:25.560 --> 2:50:27.560]  and you know there's going to be some
[2:50:27.560 --> 2:50:29.560]  splinter groups within antifa
[2:50:29.560 --> 2:50:31.560]  that actually adopt nonviolent
[2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:33.560]  resistance gondy style
[2:50:33.560 --> 2:50:35.560]  but unfortunately
[2:50:35.560 --> 2:50:37.560]  there's going to be even more splinter groups
[2:50:37.560 --> 2:50:39.560]  that go absolutely wrong
[2:50:39.560 --> 2:50:41.560]  I agree let's take a few calls in the final
[2:50:41.560 --> 2:50:43.560]  second with you then more calls after that
[2:50:43.560 --> 2:50:45.560]  but from their genesis
[2:50:45.560 --> 2:50:47.560]  the Soros funded fascist antifa
[2:50:47.560 --> 2:50:49.560]  is a violent group
[2:50:49.560 --> 2:50:51.560]  of bootlicking morons
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:53.560]  looking for their coming of age
[2:50:53.560 --> 2:50:55.560]  war ritual
[2:50:55.560 --> 2:50:57.560]  they want to count kill on us
[2:50:57.560 --> 2:50:59.560]  they'll really be counting gravestones
[2:50:59.560 --> 2:51:01.560]  it's been said any society
[2:51:01.560 --> 2:51:03.560]  is only three missed meals away from chaos
[2:51:03.560 --> 2:51:05.560]  those times may be near
[2:51:05.560 --> 2:51:07.560]  our country faces multiple
[2:51:07.560 --> 2:51:09.560]  terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia
[2:51:09.560 --> 2:51:11.560]  and North Korea social unrest
[2:51:11.560 --> 2:51:13.560]  and violent marches yet again may lead to
[2:51:13.560 --> 2:51:15.560]  looting of stores and city shutdowns
[2:51:15.560 --> 2:51:17.560]  and a crumbling infrastructure leaves our
[2:51:17.560 --> 2:51:19.560]  power grid vulnerable to long term outages
[2:51:19.560 --> 2:51:21.560]  from a single cyber attack
[2:51:21.560 --> 2:51:23.560]  when the chaos from any one of these threats
[2:51:23.560 --> 2:51:25.560]  arises the government knows it can't
[2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:27.560]  provide during a widespread national emergency
[2:51:27.560 --> 2:51:29.560]  that's why you need your own plan
[2:51:29.560 --> 2:51:31.560]  for self-reliance
[2:51:31.560 --> 2:51:33.560]  that's where my patriot supply comes in

[2:51:57.560 --> 2:51:59.560]  preparewithgcn.com
[2:51:59.560 --> 2:52:01.560]  after being sold out for months
[2:52:01.560 --> 2:52:03.560]  the first shipment of super blue
[2:52:03.560 --> 2:52:05.560]  sold out in one week
[2:52:05.560 --> 2:52:07.560]  I thought it would be a six month supply for listeners
[2:52:07.560 --> 2:52:09.560]  and since then people are beating down
[2:52:09.560 --> 2:52:11.560]  our doors wanting to be able to
[2:52:11.560 --> 2:52:13.560]  resupply their super blue
[2:52:13.560 --> 2:52:15.560]  research across the board is clear
[2:52:15.560 --> 2:52:17.560]  in fact it's certified
[2:52:17.560 --> 2:52:19.560]  when bacteria infect your gums it can enter your bloodstream
[2:52:19.560 --> 2:52:21.560]  and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks
[2:52:21.560 --> 2:52:23.560]  that's why the last surgeon general's report
[2:52:23.560 --> 2:52:25.560]  on oral health warns
[2:52:25.560 --> 2:52:27.560]  that your oral health can have a serious impact

[2:52:43.560 --> 2:52:45.560]  and eliminate bad breath

[2:54:55.760 --> 2:54:58.920]  We're in the middle of the fight of the century.
[2:54:58.920 --> 2:55:02.800]  It's hardcore and you have all made it possible to want to salute you all and thank you Mike
[2:55:02.800 --> 2:55:04.480]  Cernovich for coming up.
[2:55:04.480 --> 2:55:10.520]  Let's go to Katherine, you're on the air with James Leslie Rawls of survivalblog.com.
[2:55:10.520 --> 2:55:11.840]  Katherine and Canada, you're on the air.
[2:55:11.840 --> 2:55:12.840]  Go ahead.
[2:55:12.840 --> 2:55:13.840]  Hi there.
[2:55:13.840 --> 2:55:14.840]  Hi.
[2:55:14.840 --> 2:55:15.840]  Go ahead.
[2:55:15.840 --> 2:55:16.840]  Hi.
[2:55:16.840 --> 2:55:22.480]  I just want to point out the fact that how come nobody's talking about Trump knew Comey
[2:55:22.480 --> 2:55:26.280]  was going to leak to the press before Comey leaked to the press?
[2:55:26.280 --> 2:55:31.360]  Like everybody talks about Oat The Tape but at the last part of that tweet he said before
[2:55:31.360 --> 2:55:35.160]  you start go leaking to the press and then he admitted he did.
[2:55:35.160 --> 2:55:38.720]  And so no one's given Trump that credit that he already knows what's going on before it's
[2:55:38.720 --> 2:55:39.720]  going to happen.
[2:55:39.720 --> 2:55:46.680]  Well, he's the president so this whole surveillance state's a two-way street and so Trump is aware
[2:55:46.680 --> 2:55:47.680]  of what they're doing.
[2:55:47.680 --> 2:55:52.280]  He's got, the problem is that the goods are so damning, the pedophile rings, all of it.
[2:55:52.280 --> 2:55:54.880]  It would kill the country and the stock market if it all came out.
[2:55:54.880 --> 2:56:01.640]  I say bring it all out just as we done May the Heavens Fall but Trump is on quite a tightrope
[2:56:01.640 --> 2:56:02.640]  right now.
[2:56:02.640 --> 2:56:04.920]  James, you want to comment on that?
[2:56:04.920 --> 2:56:11.520]  Well yes, I think the Trump administration is definitely on a tightrope.
[2:56:11.520 --> 2:56:21.480]  They have to draw the line between absolute disclosure and national security and a lot
[2:56:21.480 --> 2:56:29.360]  of what Trump is privy to and that his inner circle are privy to cannot be disclosed simply
[2:56:29.360 --> 2:56:35.720]  because of sources and methods, for example, coming out of the intelligence world.
[2:56:35.720 --> 2:56:44.480]  And if they had the situation where they pushed into a corner, they could release some very
[2:56:44.480 --> 2:56:51.640]  damning information that would pretty well take down the whole media conglomerate.
[2:56:51.640 --> 2:56:55.200]  And what's crazy is the globalists haven't sued for peace.
[2:56:55.200 --> 2:56:58.360]  They are just desperately attacking, desperately pushing.
[2:56:58.360 --> 2:57:00.720]  That's what concerns me.
[2:57:00.720 --> 2:57:06.040]  Well yes, the media is, they're all in at this point.
[2:57:06.040 --> 2:57:12.120]  They are on the absolute war path against Trump and his entire administration and they
[2:57:12.120 --> 2:57:13.800]  will not quit.
[2:57:13.800 --> 2:57:15.440]  They will continue to hound.
[2:57:15.440 --> 2:57:24.720]  They will bring up the fictitious bogeyman of Russian collusion for years because it's
[2:57:24.720 --> 2:57:27.720]  one of those things where you can't prove a negative.
[2:57:27.720 --> 2:57:28.720]  It's one of those how you-
[2:57:28.720 --> 2:57:30.560]  Yeah, when did you start raping your wife?
[2:57:30.560 --> 2:57:31.560]  Yeah.
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:32.560]  Yeah.
[2:57:32.560 --> 2:57:33.560]  Why did you rob that bank?
[2:57:33.560 --> 2:57:34.560]  You're like-
[2:57:34.560 --> 2:57:35.560]  Right.
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:45.680]  So, they'll keep bringing it up and because the mass media is essentially a unified front,
[2:57:45.680 --> 2:57:47.180]  they're all fifth columnists.
[2:57:47.180 --> 2:57:51.800]  And doesn't that add to their false confidence that they're all lying and they're reaching
[2:57:51.800 --> 2:57:52.800]  new heights of lying?
[2:57:52.800 --> 2:57:55.920]  Yeah, they're all lying in unison.
[2:57:55.920 --> 2:57:59.760]  They're all a chorus of the same lies.
[2:57:59.760 --> 2:58:09.040]  And it's kind of self-fulfilling, self-replicating, and self-advancing.
[2:58:09.040 --> 2:58:10.040]  And here's the scariest part.
[2:58:10.040 --> 2:58:11.040]  I see it.
[2:58:11.040 --> 2:58:16.400]  There's only like five or six scripts a month written by Podesta and David Brock.
[2:58:16.400 --> 2:58:20.920]  I mean, that's scary to see thousands of publications show unoriginal.
[2:58:20.920 --> 2:58:26.880]  They all re-scramble the same talking points they get, word for word, in mass plagiarism
[2:58:26.880 --> 2:58:29.880]  for they vomit in one mouth and vomit in another.
[2:58:29.880 --> 2:58:31.160]  James Loseralls, thank you so much.
[2:58:31.160 --> 2:58:32.160]  We're going to come back.
[2:58:32.160 --> 2:58:33.160]  You've got to go.
[2:58:33.160 --> 2:58:34.160]  Thank you so much.
[2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:37.040]  We're going to Carlos, Jeff, Lynn, Joe, and others, and then Mike Cernovich.
[2:58:37.040 --> 2:58:38.040]  Fourth Hour coming up.
[2:58:38.040 --> 2:58:41.280]  If you spread the word about Infowars.com, the enemy hates it.
[2:58:41.280 --> 2:58:42.280]  Have you done it?
[2:58:42.280 --> 2:58:43.280]  Let's win.
[2:58:43.280 --> 2:58:44.280]  Thanks, James.
[2:58:44.280 --> 2:58:45.280]  We'll be back.
[2:58:45.280 --> 2:58:49.680]  Fourth Hour is right ahead.
[2:58:49.680 --> 2:58:55.680]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality Infowars Biome Defense
[2:58:55.680 --> 2:58:57.280]  probiotic.
[2:58:57.280 --> 2:59:04.000]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have
[2:59:04.000 --> 2:59:11.680]  been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.

[2:59:52.240 --> 3:00:10.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:10.120 --> 3:00:14.640]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[3:00:14.640 --> 3:00:34.560]  We're listening to Alex Jones.
[3:00:34.560 --> 3:00:37.880]  Carlos, Jeff, Lynn, Joe, I'm going to get to all of you, then I'm going to start taking
[3:00:37.880 --> 3:00:38.880]  over this hour.
[3:00:38.880 --> 3:00:42.480]  I can't wait to hear the big breaking news he's got.
[3:00:42.480 --> 3:00:44.840]  Carlos in Montreal, Canada, you're on the air.
[3:00:44.840 --> 3:00:45.840]  Go ahead.
[3:00:45.840 --> 3:00:52.960]  I just want to look over the Russia game card that's been played, actually, the origins
[3:00:52.960 --> 3:00:55.640]  and where it goes, how it ends.
[3:00:55.640 --> 3:01:02.720]  The Russia card actually began as a reaction to RT penetrating and getting readership and
[3:01:02.720 --> 3:01:05.840]  viewership on March the 3rd.
[3:01:05.840 --> 3:01:06.840]  Exactly.
[3:01:06.840 --> 3:01:10.840]  They claim, going back four years, that they're losing the Infowar because Russia dare launch
[3:01:10.840 --> 3:01:16.760]  its own CNN, I think RT's too leftist, I mean, it's pretty milk-toed, and they go, oh, that's
[3:01:16.760 --> 3:01:17.760]  why they lost.
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:22.560]  No, they lost because Pelosi and Hillary are skeletons, and if you notice, they're still
[3:01:22.560 --> 3:01:27.120]  going to keep Pelosi in, they're arrogant, they lost.
[3:01:27.120 --> 3:01:33.480]  Yes, and three years later, actually, she used the term Infowar, the US is losing the
[3:01:33.480 --> 3:01:35.120]  world Infowar.
[3:01:35.120 --> 3:01:41.200]  In 2014, April, you had John Kerry saying of RT that it was a propaganda bullhorn, and
[3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:44.800]  do you know why?
[3:01:44.800 --> 3:01:49.040]  Because they were criticizing radical Islamists taking over Syria?
[3:01:49.040 --> 3:01:55.480]  No, because the globalists could not tell the truth to the people.
[3:01:55.480 --> 3:01:59.400]  After years of meeting, as you know, in the Bohemian Grove and Bilberg, they were talking
[3:01:59.400 --> 3:02:03.360]  to each other, but when they had to implement the agenda that they had been talking for
[3:02:03.360 --> 3:02:09.800]  40 years over, according to David Rockefeller, with the assistance of the media keeping quiet,
[3:02:09.800 --> 3:02:12.040]  now they had to put the agenda in place.
[3:02:12.040 --> 3:02:13.040]  They had to actually...
[3:02:13.040 --> 3:02:14.040]  No, no, I agree.
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:17.160]  With all this talk, they already had a global system swindling, now they were going to shut
[3:02:17.160 --> 3:02:21.320]  off prosperity, really get the population reduction, and a lot of globalists had cold
[3:02:21.320 --> 3:02:24.800]  feet, which is a good thing.
[3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:28.360]  They weren't willing to carry out stuff like Henry Kimmler.
[3:02:28.360 --> 3:02:34.440]  Well, these people, if you actually listen to these globalists, they talk like ranchers,
[3:02:34.440 --> 3:02:37.880]  you know, trying to plan the future cattle, you know?
[3:02:37.880 --> 3:02:40.920]  Exactly, and now the cattle are going to come in your house and eat your ass at night.
[3:02:40.920 --> 3:02:43.160]  We're not putting up with it.
[3:02:43.160 --> 3:02:44.320]  Precisely.
[3:02:44.320 --> 3:02:46.640]  And do you know where it ends?
[3:02:46.640 --> 3:02:49.440]  It ends because now they're losing elections, you see?
[3:02:49.440 --> 3:02:54.400]  RT no longer plays the big card for them, so they're going to try to put legislation
[3:02:54.400 --> 3:02:59.400]  trying to shut down RT, and then after, they're going after you in a Hillary presidency.
[3:02:59.400 --> 3:03:03.440]  Well, that's what they said they were going to do, but let's be clear, RT America, and
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:05.160]  I get it, it's hard to staff an operation.
[3:03:05.160 --> 3:03:09.640]  A bunch of leftist ding-dongs, there are a few good RT Americans, a joke, nobody watches,
[3:03:09.640 --> 3:03:15.040]  RT Global's bigger than CNN, CNN has no credibility, and has some good stuff on it, like Max Kaiser
[3:03:15.040 --> 3:03:19.480]  and others, but it's still milk toast, man.
[3:03:19.480 --> 3:03:20.640]  Here's the deal.
[3:03:20.640 --> 3:03:24.480]  They just want to point RT at the think tanks and say, that's why we lost.
[3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:26.840]  You lost because you're losers.
[3:03:26.840 --> 3:03:32.440]  Your daddy's daddy gave you your job, you're a bunch of blue blood, you want to bash white
[3:03:32.440 --> 3:03:33.440]  people?
[3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:38.120]  You talk about the retarded wasp, you know, in LA and New York and places that play golf
[3:03:38.120 --> 3:03:42.840]  all day and get massages all day and, you know, have mentally ill wives and kids, they're
[3:03:42.840 --> 3:03:43.840]  all inbred, retards.
[3:03:43.840 --> 3:03:46.120]  I mean, I don't mean to be mean, but I mean, just give me a break.
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:50.200]  And then all the other people, the elites, I mean, they're not elite, they're jokes,
[3:03:50.200 --> 3:03:54.440]  and they want to know why everybody hates them because everyone's sick of you, and it's
[3:03:54.440 --> 3:03:57.720]  not like Hollywood's the only media 50 years ago.
[3:03:57.720 --> 3:04:01.640]  People are sick of media, they have no respect for it, they're tired.
[3:04:01.640 --> 3:04:04.920]  If I want my audience to tune out, I start talking about Hollywood, okay?
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:07.960]  My audience is beyond hating it.
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:13.320]  It's anathema, and they still think, let's show more red carpets, let's have more Hollywood
[3:04:13.320 --> 3:04:14.320]  stars.
[3:04:14.320 --> 3:04:17.960]  They have all these Hollywood star videos they put out where the Hollywood stars say, we
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:22.640]  want your guns, I'm Madonna, I'm Brad Pitt, turn your guns in.
[3:04:22.640 --> 3:04:27.520]  I mean, I wouldn't hang around with Brad Pitt, I wouldn't hang around with George Clooney.
[3:04:27.520 --> 3:04:31.000]  They are so, I've already hung around with these people.
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:34.480]  I mean, they were boring 15 years ago, man.
[3:04:34.480 --> 3:04:41.120]  They are done, they're out of gas, they're a joke, God, thank heavens.
[3:04:41.120 --> 3:04:43.240]  I'm not one of these empty souls.
[3:04:43.240 --> 3:04:48.040]  Thank you, Carlos, Jeff Lin and Joe, your calls are straight up then.
[3:04:48.040 --> 3:04:53.200]  We'll talk about the fatal blow to the enemy with Jeff in Montana, and then Mike Sarnovich
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:56.200]  with Breaking Inside Intel, straight ahead.
[3:04:56.200 --> 3:04:57.520]  This is the InfoWars.
[3:04:57.520 --> 3:05:03.720]  InfoWars has proudly announced the CNN is fake news contest, an expansion of the already
[3:05:03.720 --> 3:05:05.800]  successful CNN is ISIS contest.
[3:05:05.800 --> 3:05:10.000]  The contest is simple, $1,000 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is fake news
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:12.000]  sign or legible self-made t-shirt.
[3:05:12.000 --> 3:05:16.200]  $2,500 prize for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is fake news sign or t-shirt, and
[3:05:16.200 --> 3:05:20.120]  it's also heard to say, CNN is fake news, InfoWars.com is real.
[3:05:20.120 --> 3:05:24.600]  You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available
[3:05:24.600 --> 3:05:26.800]  now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:05:26.800 --> 3:05:31.200]  The intent of the contest is to encourage you, the listener, to realize that you have the
[3:05:31.200 --> 3:05:35.040]  power to save civilization from the criminal cabal control and humanity in this fake news
[3:05:35.040 --> 3:05:36.840]  propaganda machine called CNN.
[3:05:36.840 --> 3:05:40.720]  The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news, which
[3:05:40.720 --> 3:05:44.600]  a CNN producer admitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas.
[3:05:44.600 --> 3:05:48.800]  We need to come together to remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda
[3:05:48.800 --> 3:05:52.720]  thought up by multinational think tanks that is then fed to the public to suppress individual
[3:05:52.720 --> 3:05:54.560]  thought and run humanity into a ditch.
[3:05:54.560 --> 3:05:58.200]  For more contest rules, visit InfoWars.com for slash contest.
[3:05:58.200 --> 3:05:59.200]  This is Kit Daniels.
[3:05:59.200 --> 3:06:03.760]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:06:03.760 --> 3:06:08.480]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:06:08.480 --> 3:06:10.000]  to detoxify the body.
[3:06:10.000 --> 3:06:14.880]  That's why I'm introducing ZShield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[3:06:14.880 --> 3:06:16.400]  It's made in the USA.
[3:06:16.400 --> 3:06:21.320]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[3:06:21.320 --> 3:06:23.160]  the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[3:06:23.160 --> 3:06:25.400]  It is a classical 360 win.
[3:06:25.400 --> 3:06:29.880]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[3:06:29.880 --> 3:06:34.560]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[3:06:34.560 --> 3:06:35.560]  get.
[3:06:35.560 --> 3:06:38.760]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[3:06:38.760 --> 3:06:43.800]  country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[3:06:43.800 --> 3:06:49.040]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those rush fires the
[3:06:49.040 --> 3:06:51.760]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[3:06:51.760 --> 3:06:55.040]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[3:06:55.040 --> 3:06:59.040]  Now it's time to change our bodies with ZShield, InfoWarsLive.com.

[3:07:46.840 --> 3:07:48.520]  quality lab standard.
[3:07:48.520 --> 3:07:52.520]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure, and rest secured, you're finding the tip of
[3:07:52.520 --> 3:07:53.520]  the spear in the InfoWars.

[3:07:56.800 --> 3:08:05.480]  We'll catch you now before we sell out.
[3:08:05.480 --> 3:08:17.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:08:17.000 --> 3:08:23.240]  Mike Sernovich, he's so busy, I'm so busy working 14, 18 hours a day, seven days a week
[3:08:23.240 --> 3:08:26.480]  that we haven't even got it codified yet, but Roger Stone, Sernovich, all of them.
[3:08:26.480 --> 3:08:30.160]  I got the board ops getting hired, the people, the satellites, I'm going to work with GCN
[3:08:30.160 --> 3:08:31.160]  as well.
[3:08:31.160 --> 3:08:34.840]  Getting ready in the next month, in the next month we're going to launch morning shows,
[3:08:34.840 --> 3:08:39.120]  nighttime shows, afternoon shows, Sernovich is going to be on right after my broadcast
[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:40.120]  every day.
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:43.960]  The stations are already ready to pick it up, it's already on our own satellite, I'll
[3:08:43.960 --> 3:08:46.600]  probably work with GCN, it'll be on their satellite as well.
[3:08:46.600 --> 3:08:48.600]  That is all going to be announced very, very soon.
[3:08:48.600 --> 3:08:55.000]  I'm very, very excited about it because if I'm on over 200 stations, imagine once I
[3:08:55.000 --> 3:09:00.080]  launch all these other great broadcasts, and if 30, 40, 50 pick up a show out of the gates,
[3:09:00.080 --> 3:09:02.640]  that is millions of new listeners.
[3:09:02.640 --> 3:09:09.600]  We've got big stations in Chicago, LA, going into New York, out of New Jersey, Florida,
[3:09:09.600 --> 3:09:14.240]  Texas, we're on all over the country, I want to thank all of our affiliates, you're amazing.
[3:09:14.240 --> 3:09:18.520]  I promised to go to Jeff Lynn, Joe, and Jeff, it's terrible that I have Sernovich hosts
[3:09:18.520 --> 3:09:21.920]  and then I always take over, but I was talking to Mike, I just love Mike, I just can't get
[3:09:21.920 --> 3:09:22.920]  enough of him.
[3:09:22.920 --> 3:09:26.880]  He's doing great work, he's doing, I want to go to these calls, I don't think we should
[3:09:26.880 --> 3:09:33.440]  make people wait, Sernovich has huge fake news stories exposing CNN, he's got huge news
[3:09:33.440 --> 3:09:38.360]  on their whole fake news narrative, now that's all coming down, he's got big White House source
[3:09:38.360 --> 3:09:42.640]  news on the next big shoes to drop, he's going to be laying it out today and laying it out
[3:09:42.640 --> 3:09:47.560]  again on his own news sites and his own blogs and his own Twitter, but he had to wait the
[3:09:47.560 --> 3:09:52.760]  stuff so high because it's so high level policy that he's got to wait till it's disseminated
[3:09:52.760 --> 3:09:58.080]  and then wait, we do this too until it's just about to break from their own sources but
[3:09:58.080 --> 3:10:02.800]  with spin against us so that we had him off at the pass and so far he's had really good
[3:10:02.800 --> 3:10:07.600]  accuracy in when he releases it and the media has to admit, even New York Times, okay Sernovich
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:10.960]  has a direct high level White House source bigger than anything they've got, well of
[3:10:10.960 --> 3:10:15.200]  course you don't, you're the enemy of America, Sernovich's proven he's real.
[3:10:15.200 --> 3:10:19.360]  I too, if I actually want to have these sources, I have to go to DC now, the phone calls are
[3:10:19.360 --> 3:10:24.600]  listened to, the phone calls I do have are very thank you, keep it up, we appreciate you,
[3:10:24.600 --> 3:10:27.880]  nothing can be discussed, it's beyond a movie.
[3:10:27.880 --> 3:10:32.200]  So Mike Sernovich, wow, you were in DC last week, big stuff going on, let's hit that in
[3:10:32.200 --> 3:10:36.280]  the moment but first, how big is this seeing and implosion, is this them committing suicide,
[3:10:36.280 --> 3:10:40.880]  is this death watch, are they finally gone, I mean they were shadow of their former selves,
[3:10:40.880 --> 3:10:45.080]  is it a dead cat bounce, I mean this, how much devastation can they handle, a hundred
[3:10:45.080 --> 3:10:50.160]  million dollar lawsuits, admitting their fraudulent, admitting they're lying, Van Jones, top producers,
[3:10:50.160 --> 3:10:54.560]  it's all alive for money, take us to the brink of war with Russia, I mean this is a clear
[3:10:54.560 --> 3:10:55.560]  and present danger.
[3:10:55.560 --> 3:11:02.280]  Yeah, it's actually quite beautiful, Gemma Costa has been complaining that, what was
[3:11:02.280 --> 3:11:07.520]  the exact thing he said, he goes, how is this America when conservatives are allowed to
[3:11:07.520 --> 3:11:10.720]  ask questions in the White House, he tweeted that out actually.
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:15.200]  Think how disconnected, he said that during the hearing, we have video, he said, is this
[3:11:15.200 --> 3:11:20.480]  America, conservatives get asked questions, like they're at the table, they have speech,
[3:11:20.480 --> 3:11:23.360]  what I'm this entitled asshole, excuse me.
[3:11:23.360 --> 3:11:28.960]  Yeah, exactly, the mask has fallen off and another CNN person, I think Dylan Byers or
[3:11:28.960 --> 3:11:35.440]  somebody had claimed that, oh it's right wing people asking about the media, real journalists,
[3:11:35.440 --> 3:11:41.520]  the liberals are asking about these other subjects, so the mask is off now and the people are
[3:11:41.520 --> 3:11:47.760]  seeing the pure ugliness and the lies of the fake news media and of CNN, I mean that wall
[3:11:47.760 --> 3:11:54.000]  placard is perfect, the Patriots at the top, the people, we need to add Jeff Zucker to
[3:11:54.000 --> 3:11:58.040]  the bottom there, put him down there with George Soros and Sinka and Sean King and Bill Clinton
[3:11:58.040 --> 3:11:59.040]  and everyone else.
[3:11:59.040 --> 3:12:05.280]  And then the Playboy writer gets up and says, how dare you report on CNN admittedly getting
[3:12:05.280 --> 3:12:11.080]  caught with fake news, retracting three different stories, total implosion, they get up and
[3:12:11.080 --> 3:12:16.440]  bitch and complain and say you're causing a problem, don't talk about it with some whiny
[3:12:16.440 --> 3:12:22.120]  wimp, I mean look at these repeaters, look at these whores, look at these nobodies, look
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:27.760]  at these soulless husks, put it back on screen, I mean what a joke, it's an army of morons.
[3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:33.400]  Yeah, that guy actually tried to get violent with me in the White House when I confronted
[3:12:33.400 --> 3:12:38.720]  the press reporters and asked them why they won't disavow violence, he followed me out
[3:12:38.720 --> 3:12:42.720]  and was putting his hands in my fingers or his fingers in my face and was trying to bait
[3:12:42.720 --> 3:12:46.840]  me into beating up essentially so that he could frame me for a crime.
[3:12:46.840 --> 3:12:52.440]  So I've had a run with that guy, he's actually a total criminal, total scumbag, if you watch
[3:12:52.440 --> 3:12:56.520]  the video I did where I confront and see it in and all the other fake news and go why
[3:12:56.520 --> 3:12:58.320]  would you not disavow political violence?
[3:12:58.320 --> 3:13:01.520]  Well why is he like chilling on a piece of gum while he talks, I mean you're saying in
[3:13:01.520 --> 3:13:04.600]  your view, he politely trying to frame you would be criminal.
[3:13:04.600 --> 3:13:10.080]  Yeah, yeah, so he was, when I went into the White House and I said to the media, I go
[3:13:10.080 --> 3:13:12.560]  why would you not cover political violence on the left?
[3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:17.720]  He started screaming at me actually, he's over there on my left and you can hear him
[3:13:17.720 --> 3:13:22.400]  in the original video, he starts screaming at me, like how dare I come to their sacred
[3:13:22.400 --> 3:13:26.560]  place and confront him and so I don't know if we can see him, no, he's a little bit too
[3:13:26.560 --> 3:13:28.280]  far over to the left.
[3:13:28.280 --> 3:13:33.080]  So when I walked out quite peacefully, these are the most entitled idiots, like we were
[3:13:33.080 --> 3:13:38.600]  all trying to get out of high school by the time we were sophomores or juniors, they were
[3:13:38.600 --> 3:13:43.320]  like trying to hang on to high school, you know, like the guy from days of infuse, all
[3:13:43.320 --> 3:13:47.920]  right, all right, all right, they think they're like in the cool club when there's such jokes.
[3:13:47.920 --> 3:13:52.400]  Oh no, and that was the whole thing, so he follows me out as I'm leaving very peacefully
[3:13:52.400 --> 3:13:56.280]  because I knew that they were all going to try to frame me for a kind of crime and then
[3:13:56.280 --> 3:14:00.320]  he comes out and he gets right in my face, so what I did is I took my hands and I put
[3:14:00.320 --> 3:14:04.680]  them kind of like back like in parade rest, like you would do in the army so that nobody
[3:14:04.680 --> 3:14:09.840]  could claim that I punched him and he just screamed and was triggered and he goes, you
[3:14:09.840 --> 3:14:14.760]  think you're edgy, I work for Playboy, I'm the edgiest guy in here, nobody's like, there's
[3:14:14.760 --> 3:14:17.800]  nothing more uncool than Playboy.
[3:14:17.800 --> 3:14:24.240]  Yeah, right, what a joke, so you're talking about a dry lizard weaning, yeah, so he really
[3:14:24.240 --> 3:14:29.920]  did say that, the vice people caught everything and he screams, you think that you're, you
[3:14:29.920 --> 3:14:34.320]  think that you're on the edge, there's nobody in here like me, I work for Playboy and I
[3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:37.560]  thought man, this guy is trying to frame me, dude.
[3:14:37.560 --> 3:14:41.800]  Oh my gosh, but he looks like a total moron and you know, since we mentioned it, then
[3:14:41.800 --> 3:14:47.480]  I want to get into your big breaking news, let's play that clip from Sarah Sanders destroys
[3:14:47.480 --> 3:14:55.880]  trendy, super edgy White House Dweeby when he tries to defend his fellow fake news journalist,
[3:14:55.880 --> 3:14:57.280]  here we go.
[3:14:57.280 --> 3:15:04.840]  If we make the slightest mistake, the slightest word is off, it is just an absolute tirade
[3:15:04.840 --> 3:15:13.000]  from a lot of people in this room, but news outlets get to go on day after day and cite
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:20.280]  unnamed sources, use stories without sources, have, you know, you mentioned the Scaramucci
[3:15:20.280 --> 3:15:23.200]  story where they had to have reporters resign.
[3:15:23.200 --> 3:15:28.560]  Come on, you're explaining everybody right here right now with those words, this administration
[3:15:28.560 --> 3:15:33.760]  has done that as well, why in the name of heavens, any one of us, right, or replaced
[3:15:33.760 --> 3:15:39.640]  one of us, if we don't get it right, the audience has the opportunity to turn the channel or
[3:15:39.640 --> 3:15:47.720]  not, I want you to interrupt me, he's acting like, how dare you talk about us, you know,
[3:15:47.720 --> 3:16:01.400]  you're being insidious, we just attack you all day like a bunch of chalahuas, look at
[3:16:01.400 --> 3:16:06.360]  the entitlement of these libtards, first of all, I think if anything has been inflamed,
[3:16:06.360 --> 3:16:16.240]  who said dinosaurs don't still exist, it is outrageous for you to accuse me of inflaming
[3:16:16.240 --> 3:16:20.080]  a story when I was simply trying to respond, let's back it up 20 seconds, because you want
[3:16:20.080 --> 3:16:28.680]  to see Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus, Tyrannosaurus, I mean the pterodactyls, Pteranodons, you
[3:16:28.680 --> 3:16:34.720]  want to see real dinosaurs on TV kids, let me show them to you, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:16:34.720 --> 3:16:38.560]  there is the true dinosaurs, they've been elected to serve for four years, at least
[3:16:38.560 --> 3:16:43.240]  there's no option other than that, we're here to ask you questions, you're here to provide
[3:16:43.240 --> 3:16:46.240]  the answers and what you just did, I don't want to hit a few phone calls, I'm skipping
[3:16:46.240 --> 3:16:49.080]  this break so Cernwich has more time, but Mike, I know you're going to get more into
[3:16:49.080 --> 3:16:53.440]  this later after we take these calls, but Prelude here, a little hors d'oeuvre, what's
[3:16:53.440 --> 3:16:58.280]  the latest intel from your White House sources? Oh, and by the way, I did find that video
[3:16:58.280 --> 3:17:02.800]  of that cry baby Brian when he threw a fit at me, so I'll play the audio just real quick,
[3:17:02.800 --> 3:17:09.200]  so you can tell that. Yeah, hold it up the screen too, here we go. Yeah, we can't hear
[3:17:09.200 --> 3:17:16.440]  that. Okay, yeah, just text it to him and we'll have it. Gotcha, yeah, so I've found
[3:17:16.440 --> 3:17:22.040]  out the Syria thing, every piece of the puzzle now is kind of coming into place, where Nikki
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:28.520]  Haley is on Twitter trying to start World War III with Iran and with Russia, and I have
[3:17:28.520 --> 3:17:32.560]  got confirmation that McMaster is again manipulating intelligence reports coming
[3:17:32.560 --> 3:17:38.920]  out of Syria. So that whole chemical weapons attack was a false flag orchestrated by McMaster.
[3:17:38.920 --> 3:17:45.160]  There was no planned attack by Assad. That was again McMaster manipulating intelligence,
[3:17:45.160 --> 3:17:49.400]  which we reported way back in April that he was going to do this. And while they have
[3:17:49.400 --> 3:17:54.040]  it, while the fake news media has everybody distracted on, as Van Jones said, the Russian
[3:17:54.040 --> 3:17:59.920]  nothing burger, McMaster is now feeding, this is treason, he is beating President Trump
[3:17:59.920 --> 3:18:04.840]  and invalid intelligence about weapons and chemical weapons attack. So this was again
[3:18:04.840 --> 3:18:10.840]  another lie. And how obvious is it when Nikki Haley tweets two days ago, anything happens
[3:18:10.840 --> 3:18:16.500]  in Syria, it's Russia's fault. I mean, that's encouraging the rebels the stage of false
[3:18:16.500 --> 3:18:22.840]  flag is like the British ambassador said. Yeah, she said not only will Assad be blamed,
[3:18:22.840 --> 3:18:28.280]  but will also blame Russia and Iran. So she is orchestrating World War III, right, it'll
[3:18:28.280 --> 3:18:34.880]  also be all blamed on them. And McMaster is orchestrating this again. So the intelligence
[3:18:34.880 --> 3:18:41.160]  now coming out of anything to do with McMaster is now being manipulated. Trump is being lied
[3:18:41.160 --> 3:18:45.360]  to. And then of course, other pieces of the Palsal law coming together while everybody's
[3:18:45.360 --> 3:18:50.800]  distracted with this goldfish memory stuff of the latest nothing burgers. Brian Hook and
[3:18:50.800 --> 3:18:56.160]  Margaret Petterling now run and they totally control State Department. They've blocked
[3:18:56.160 --> 3:19:01.400]  and jammed the security clearances of every person who might be for America first or might
[3:19:01.400 --> 3:19:06.840]  be Trump first. That is how we're letting in terrorist refugees that Rex Rex Tillerson
[3:19:06.840 --> 3:19:11.080]  does not run State Department. It's actually Brian Hook, who was a never Trump or and Margaret
[3:19:11.080 --> 3:19:17.400]  Petterling. Why has Tillerson done that? Because he can be given a free hand on energy. I mean,
[3:19:17.400 --> 3:19:21.480]  why obviously a deal's been made with the neocons or whatever to let them continue to
[3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:26.920]  stay in there. Yeah. And Tillerson is actually trying because he was from ExxonMobil. He's
[3:19:26.920 --> 3:19:31.160]  trying to work out some kind of deal with the Russian sanctions. But he didn't. Here's
[3:19:31.160 --> 3:19:36.920]  the thing, Alex. This is again, why it's so frustrating. You know, you're a business person,
[3:19:36.920 --> 3:19:41.600]  you run a business, you hire people and you expect them to do a good job. And even when
[3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:45.520]  you're paying people for the work that they do, a lot of times people disappoint you.
[3:19:45.520 --> 3:19:48.960]  Well, Tillerson comes in and he thinks, well, I'll hire Brian Hook and Margaret Petterling
[3:19:48.960 --> 3:19:53.160]  and they'll try to make America great again, not realizing that they're actually there
[3:19:53.160 --> 3:19:57.160]  to subvert and sabotage everything that Trump and he wants to do. Because they're part of
[3:19:57.160 --> 3:20:01.280]  mafia organizations they're bought and paid for and they're not going to stop. And that's
[3:20:01.280 --> 3:20:07.840]  why Trump cannot co-op these groups. He has to jettison them. Yeah, they're hiring freeze
[3:20:07.840 --> 3:20:12.480]  at State Department. State Department is his own little island now. If you ever supported
[3:20:12.480 --> 3:20:16.920]  Trump, they actually check your social media. And if you had posted pro Trump, Twitter,
[3:20:16.920 --> 3:20:21.000]  tweets or Facebooks or anything, they won't allow you. And how can Trump allow, I get
[3:20:21.000 --> 3:20:25.400]  the fact he's working all day and doing events and trying to do policy. But I mean, does
[3:20:25.400 --> 3:20:32.080]  he get what enemies he's got, just snakes, just spoiling around beneath him? To a little
[3:20:32.080 --> 3:20:38.720]  bit he does. But the degree of sabotage is not something anybody expected, including
[3:20:38.720 --> 3:20:45.280]  me. I mean, it is quite an accusation for me to claim that the National Security Advisor
[3:20:45.280 --> 3:20:49.960]  is manipulating intelligence supports on Syria. But this is true. This is what is actually
[3:20:49.960 --> 3:20:54.320]  happening. Sure. They sit in heavy artillery, the Marines. It's clearly an invasion of Syria.
[3:20:54.320 --> 3:20:58.560]  They've been lying to Trump the whole time. They've defeated ISIS. ISIS is falling. Their
[3:20:58.560 --> 3:21:03.200]  last city's about to fall. And so now they want to take out Assad. And I know the Assad
[3:21:03.200 --> 3:21:07.440]  kind of agreed to have elections once this was done. So he should agree to that. But
[3:21:07.440 --> 3:21:11.320]  clearly shooting down aircraft saying, you know, the Russians now say if you enter the
[3:21:11.320 --> 3:21:17.280]  airspace, we'll shoot you down. This is dangerous brinksmanship. Exactly. And well, the reason
[3:21:17.280 --> 3:21:21.840]  they want to go into a Syria actually is because that is one of the few countries in the Middle
[3:21:21.840 --> 3:21:25.640]  East where Christianity is allowed and it's allowed to be openly practiced. So this is
[3:21:25.640 --> 3:21:30.200]  a broader part of the left's war on Christianity. They don't care about murdering civilians
[3:21:30.200 --> 3:21:35.680]  as long as they can make it so that Christians control McMaster. Is he actually converted
[3:21:35.680 --> 3:21:41.920]  to a hobbyism like Brennan or is he just a stooge? He's, he's, I've been hearing conflicting
[3:21:41.920 --> 3:21:47.840]  reports and a lot of people claim that he is a true interventionist. He's a true globalist
[3:21:47.840 --> 3:21:53.480]  and he's a true believer. He's, he's drunk to Kool-Aid. So they, they've all told me
[3:21:53.480 --> 3:22:00.080]  they go McMaster really believes that we can send in troops, bomb people and that democracies
[3:22:00.080 --> 3:22:07.560]  are going to magically spring up. Well, I don't know about any one of that national security
[3:22:07.560 --> 3:22:12.120]  job and then McMaster popped in there and it's a piece of work. And I agree with you
[3:22:12.120 --> 3:22:15.800]  more and more. I think the Kushner thing and Ivanka thing was just been a red herring
[3:22:15.800 --> 3:22:19.040]  there. I don't think they're the ones in there. I think Trump uses them as more of
[3:22:19.040 --> 3:22:24.880]  a PR arm, just take people out to dinner and be nice to them. No, this is exactly right.
[3:22:24.880 --> 3:22:30.280]  And I was the first person to report that the McMaster ban and beef, the narrative that
[3:22:30.280 --> 3:22:36.400]  has spread was actually spread by McMaster and Petraeus through KKR. That was grossly
[3:22:36.400 --> 3:22:41.840]  exaggerated and it was planted by McMaster because they, here's what they do. They want
[3:22:41.840 --> 3:22:46.400]  World War three, Russia, Iran. They want boots on the ground in Syria. They want a bigger
[3:22:46.400 --> 3:22:51.600]  war in Afghanistan. They want more death, destruction, more Christians murdered, more
[3:22:51.600 --> 3:22:56.720]  money for the globalists. They want more destruction. So they get us to focus on, I mean, here's
[3:22:56.720 --> 3:23:03.120]  the thing I think about Van Jones for a minute is Van Jones has less editorial freedom than
[3:23:03.120 --> 3:23:07.520]  Infa Wars supporters because I know that you don't agree with a lot of things that your
[3:23:07.520 --> 3:23:10.960]  reporters have said. We've talked about it, but you've told me, you know, Sernovich, I
[3:23:10.960 --> 3:23:15.640]  think I just journalism means I don't agree with everybody and I have to welcome disagreement.
[3:23:15.640 --> 3:23:20.680]  Van Jones doesn't have that freedom. He has always talked about is he says basically the
[3:23:20.680 --> 3:23:25.640]  whole CNN staff, so does the other producer, hates what they're being told. They feel terrible
[3:23:25.640 --> 3:23:30.600]  lying about us and lying about Trump, but they still go along with it.
[3:23:30.600 --> 3:23:36.240]  Exactly. So Van Jones knows the Russia story is a nothing burger, but he is being ordered
[3:23:36.240 --> 3:23:41.520]  by Jeff Zucker and the globalists who control CNN to talk about it. They don't have any
[3:23:41.520 --> 3:23:46.440]  kind of editorial freedom. And again, that is why I've had a lot of people who they want
[3:23:46.440 --> 3:23:50.600]  to be whistleblowers at a lot of these media orgs, but they're afraid of losing their jobs
[3:23:50.600 --> 3:23:57.520]  and losing everything. So maybe Van Jones said that on camera as a cry for help.
[3:23:57.520 --> 3:24:02.960]  Well, there's no doubt that the other producer is really freaked out on those tapes and just
[3:24:02.960 --> 3:24:07.240]  says, we just lied to everybody. It's horrible. And it's just just crazy. Let's take a few
[3:24:07.240 --> 3:24:10.400]  phone calls there and then coming up, I'm going to leave her about five minutes. Sernovich
[3:24:10.400 --> 3:24:15.120]  is going to break down the latest breaking news. Jeff Lynn and Jeff. Only time we have
[3:24:15.120 --> 3:24:19.040]  for calls. I appreciate you holding Jeff in Arizona. You're on the year worldwide. Go
[3:24:19.040 --> 3:24:27.200]  ahead. Hi, Alex. How are you? Good, brother. Listen, I call today because I just started
[3:24:27.200 --> 3:24:33.440]  to realize just how important it is to have a good education system and how important
[3:24:33.440 --> 3:24:38.440]  history is to be a part of that with all the race wars that are being pushed, you know,
[3:24:38.440 --> 3:24:43.320]  all this anti white thing. And they try to justify it as if it's getting revenge on
[3:24:43.320 --> 3:24:51.120]  white people for all sorts of crap that went on during the slave trade and all the riots
[3:24:51.120 --> 3:24:56.160]  and all the injustices during the sixties and the civil rights movement. It's so important
[3:24:56.160 --> 3:25:03.320]  that both sides are shown in school. I hope they have that soon because people need to
[3:25:03.320 --> 3:25:09.920]  wake up. Well, let's expand on that. We have big banks taking our rights. We have GMO changing
[3:25:09.920 --> 3:25:14.400]  our genetics. We have all this stuff going on. And they're just making about what somebody's
[3:25:14.400 --> 3:25:18.920]  great, great, great, great, great grandpa did. And it's just mental illness. It's just
[3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:24.640]  a diversion where people are like into these false paradigms so they never really figure
[3:25:24.640 --> 3:25:28.600]  out how stuff works. They have chips on their shoulders and kind of go around acting all
[3:25:28.600 --> 3:25:32.120]  neurotic and weird so nobody can hire them. I mean, really, they're just giving them a
[3:25:32.120 --> 3:25:37.360]  psychic psychological wound. Like, you know, a dog, you try to pet and the crouches away
[3:25:37.360 --> 3:25:42.480]  because they think you're going to beat it. They're giving them this psychological trauma
[3:25:42.480 --> 3:25:46.440]  that didn't exist. And then the white people that are liberals, they're the high priests
[3:25:46.440 --> 3:25:51.840]  that manage the new plantation of all the butthurt people. So I think that's really
[3:25:51.840 --> 3:25:54.560]  what's going on, Jeff. Let's get started on what you're taking on that.
[3:25:54.560 --> 3:26:00.440]  Yeah. I mean, he's exactly, it's a new religion ultimately that used to be gaiism. They used
[3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:07.800]  to worship nature in the woods. And that has shifted now to much more dark religion and
[3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:13.000]  dark forces. And now they worship death. And they that's why they're so pro pedophile,
[3:26:13.000 --> 3:26:17.480]  and why they're pro decay, why they're pro war, why they want to murder children, why
[3:26:17.480 --> 3:26:23.760]  they won't talk about the 500,000 Iraqi children with cancer who are dying because of Petraeus
[3:26:23.760 --> 3:26:28.120]  and other and Soros and other globalists. They are the modern day death eaters. They
[3:26:28.120 --> 3:26:34.360]  are way worse than the Nazis ever were because they want to enslave all of humanity and carry
[3:26:34.360 --> 3:26:37.320]  on where Hitler left off, but they want to do it to all of the world.
[3:26:37.320 --> 3:26:44.360]  They want protected institutionalized satanism. That's what they want. Unbelievable. Jeff. Thank
[3:26:44.360 --> 3:26:48.120]  you. Lynn in the great state of Texas. You're on the air. Lynn. Thanks for calling.
[3:26:48.120 --> 3:26:53.280]  Hi, Alex. I've been listening to you since you had a radio station. I'm in a TV station
[3:26:53.280 --> 3:27:00.520]  here in Austin years ago. I guess that was over 20 years ago. Yes, ma'am. I think you've
[3:27:00.520 --> 3:27:04.880]  done a great job. I've been listening to you for quite a, you know, quite a time now.
[3:27:04.880 --> 3:27:09.520]  But my question is I've been trying to talk to people that are on the left and it seems
[3:27:09.520 --> 3:27:14.960]  almost impossible because it's like their minds are totally made up. They refuse to
[3:27:14.960 --> 3:27:20.320]  listen. You know, I'll give them examples of what Trump's done, you know, and how much
[3:27:20.320 --> 3:27:24.480]  progress he's made. And they just, they just don't get it. And I'm, that's because their
[3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:30.960]  identity is bound in this idea. So you turn to us. How do you break through to people
[3:27:30.960 --> 3:27:36.800]  like that? Yeah, I mean, it's very frustrating. And that is why I always tell the true patriots
[3:27:36.800 --> 3:27:41.160]  that we can never be angry at them. It's like being angry at a child. You know, when my
[3:27:41.160 --> 3:27:46.080]  daughter, you know, when she cries or throws something, I just understand that's a toddler.
[3:27:46.080 --> 3:27:49.800]  And what are you going to do? That's a baby. They have been brainwashed and indoctrinated
[3:27:49.800 --> 3:27:54.000]  from birth. Many of them, in fact, have been enslaved with debt. Student loan debt is a
[3:27:54.000 --> 3:27:59.800]  modern form of peonage is a modern form of slavery. The only way giving them the bad
[3:27:59.800 --> 3:28:05.440]  degree that's worthless is on purpose. So they're totally helpless. And then the system's
[3:28:05.440 --> 3:28:10.240]  like, don't worry, be political with us. I mean, it's like pimping a whore. It's like
[3:28:10.240 --> 3:28:17.200]  it's getting them into the life of bondage. Yeah, it is a form of slavery. What they had
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:22.000]  after the Civil War, of course, was slavery, where you would work your farm and you were
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:27.160]  technically a sharecropper, but you could never get ahead or it was like a factory town
[3:28:27.160 --> 3:28:32.680]  or something. That is what the globalists are creating. So my advice to people is always
[3:28:32.680 --> 3:28:38.760]  we have to be exemplars of virtue and of goodness. We have to just be kind to these people because
[3:28:38.760 --> 3:28:43.000]  they are walking around, they are enslaved and they wouldn't approach like you're even
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:46.360]  trying to convince them because they have an arrogance deal where they think, oh, they're
[3:28:46.360 --> 3:28:50.480]  powerful, they're going to ignore you. I would just go, man, I'm really worried about what's
[3:28:50.480 --> 3:28:53.840]  happening in the world and then just lay it out. But God bless you, Lynn. Real fast,
[3:28:53.840 --> 3:28:59.640]  Jeff in Montana, in the great state of Montana. Go ahead, Jeff.
[3:28:59.640 --> 3:29:04.760]  This may sound crazy to you, but bear with me as I deliver my message to the enemy and
[3:29:04.760 --> 3:29:12.240]  to the ally to claim the kill to the dragon, the weapon that they use to fill the chalice
[3:29:12.240 --> 3:29:17.600]  of the blood of martyrs. Anyone fully affirmed to the mind machine will die. I am the storm
[3:29:17.600 --> 3:29:20.040]  under the calm. My name is Darius.
[3:29:20.040 --> 3:29:23.600]  That's very interesting. We're almost out of time. Mike Sernovich, you take over, my
[3:29:23.600 --> 3:29:24.600]  friend.
[3:29:24.600 --> 3:29:27.600]  Yeah, I love the calls. I love to hear from people.
[3:29:27.600 --> 3:29:32.120]  Okay. Well, if you want to keep taking calls, the number's 800-25-99-231. We'll send you
[3:29:32.120 --> 3:29:35.720]  those numbers. We have our own phone system here soon. We got to get you plugged in where
[3:29:35.720 --> 3:29:41.200]  you have the computer heads up with the calls, 800-25-99-231. So I guess Jeff just hung up,
[3:29:41.200 --> 3:29:48.080]  but he could have come back. Mike Sernovich with his Inside DC Intel, straight ahead.
[3:29:48.080 --> 3:29:59.720]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:59.720 --> 3:30:03.800]  Inforce is proud to announce the CNN is fake news contest, an expansion of the already
[3:30:03.800 --> 3:30:08.400]  successful CNN is ISIS contest. The contest is simple. $1,000 prize for anyone who's
[3:30:08.400 --> 3:30:12.960]  seen on TV with the CNN is fake news sign or legible self-made t-shirt. $2,500 prize
[3:30:12.960 --> 3:30:16.920]  for anyone who's seen on TV with the CNN is fake news sign or t-shirt. It is also heard
[3:30:16.920 --> 3:30:22.200]  to say CNN is fake news info wars.com is real. You can also combine a CNN is fake news sign
[3:30:22.200 --> 3:30:27.440]  with one of our CNN is ISIS t-shirts available now at infowarstore.com. The intent of the
[3:30:27.440 --> 3:30:31.720]  contest is to encourage you, the listener to realize that you have the power to save
[3:30:31.720 --> 3:30:35.880]  civilization from the criminal cabal controlling humanity in his fake news propaganda machine
[3:30:35.880 --> 3:30:40.720]  called CNN. The first thing to do is hammer the point to the public that CNN is fake news,
[3:30:40.720 --> 3:30:44.800]  which a CNN producer omitted on camera to James O'Keefe and Project Veritas. We need
[3:30:44.800 --> 3:30:48.840]  to come together to remind the world that CNN simply regurgitates globalist propaganda
[3:30:48.840 --> 3:30:52.760]  thought up by multinational think tanks that has been fed to the public to suppress individual
[3:30:52.760 --> 3:30:57.160]  thought and run humanity into a ditch. For more contest rules, visit infowars.com for
[3:30:57.160 --> 3:31:01.640]  slash contest. This is Kit Daniels. Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread

[3:31:07.040 --> 3:31:11.400]  coffee on the planet. For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high
[3:31:11.400 --> 3:31:16.080]  mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica
[3:31:16.080 --> 3:31:22.040]  beans. We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[3:31:37.560 --> 3:31:42.760]  it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers. Drop

[3:31:57.320 --> 3:32:05.240]  at infowarslife.com. Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors
[3:32:05.240 --> 3:32:10.920]  would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare
[3:32:10.920 --> 3:32:17.640]  a defense. 60 years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs,
[3:32:17.640 --> 3:32:23.400]  they had drums of their own, air raid sirens. But in the 21st century, there are silent
[3:32:23.400 --> 3:32:29.040]  weapons for quiet war. Pathogens added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics
[3:32:29.040 --> 3:32:35.080]  that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death. I
[3:32:35.080 --> 3:32:42.000]  personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic
[3:32:42.000 --> 3:32:49.160]  concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human
[3:32:49.160 --> 3:32:53.600]  body. Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take
[3:32:53.600 --> 3:33:19.600]  our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at infowarslife.com with Anthroplex.
[3:33:19.600 --> 3:33:25.880]  We love to hear from you. We are listeners supported. There are big sales going on right
[3:33:25.880 --> 3:33:33.320]  now. This is what a lot of people don't understand is CNN has these big billion dollar advertising
[3:33:33.320 --> 3:33:37.400]  budgets. We don't have anything like that. Alex doesn't have anything like that. I don't
[3:33:37.400 --> 3:33:42.400]  have anything like that. Emmerich's Essential is on sale right now. We're all going into
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:48.200]  the July 4th holiday. We all need to wear sunscreen. I have not been doing that well
[3:33:48.200 --> 3:33:52.360]  and I actually noticed a couple little wrinkles. I'm sounding vain now. I'm going to embarrass
[3:33:52.360 --> 3:33:57.040]  myself. I noticed I'm like, man, you're looking at the yellow wrinkle right here. You know
[3:33:57.040 --> 3:34:01.680]  what happened? I used to wear sunscreen every day, but then I read an article that actually
[3:34:01.680 --> 3:34:06.720]  most sunscreen you buy is actually toxic and can cause skin cancer. A lot of people don't
[3:34:06.720 --> 3:34:12.320]  know that. That's why you need the Emmerich's Essential, the natural sunscreen without all
[3:34:12.320 --> 3:34:17.880]  the chemicals and goop and other things. That's why we love to talk to you all the time because
[3:34:17.880 --> 3:34:23.760]  we don't like lip service. There's nothing I hate more. I don't know if you guys ever
[3:34:23.760 --> 3:34:29.560]  noticed this before, but when you go to sign up for a gym or you sign up for the internet,
[3:34:29.560 --> 3:34:34.520]  when you're not a customer, you're king. Oh, sure. We'll take your call. There's no wait
[3:34:34.520 --> 3:34:39.880]  time. Yes, you're great. You're the best. But then the minute you become a customer and
[3:34:39.880 --> 3:34:44.520]  you have any kind of customer service issue, suddenly nobody cares anymore. Nobody wants
[3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:49.840]  to take your calls. They put you on hold for hours and they won't listen to you. What happens
[3:34:49.840 --> 3:34:55.120]  at Info Wars and me when I run my own shows are that we do want to hear from you. We want
[3:34:55.120 --> 3:35:00.600]  you to know that you matter and that you are valuable. Then think about it. CNN, they don't
[3:35:00.600 --> 3:35:08.280]  take calls. Let's just think about the difference between real news like we do and fake news.
[3:35:08.280 --> 3:35:13.160]  We take your calls. Sometimes you yell at us. Sometimes you say, why won't you cover
[3:35:13.160 --> 3:35:19.920]  this story? You hold this accountable every minute of every day with CNN is top down.
[3:35:19.920 --> 3:35:23.240]  They get on stage and they go, this is what you're going to talk about. And these are
[3:35:23.240 --> 3:35:28.280]  the news issues of the day. And this is what you have to believe in this brainwashing.
[3:35:28.280 --> 3:35:34.360]  It is a form of the occult, a form of church. But as we're now learning, even the high priestesses
[3:35:34.360 --> 3:35:40.320]  and high priests like Van Jones and like that CNN producer, even they don't have control
[3:35:40.320 --> 3:35:45.760]  over their message, they're being told what to say. Van Jones doesn't want to talk about
[3:35:45.760 --> 3:35:49.920]  it. I've always known Van Jones. I thought he's wrong a few times, but I've never thought
[3:35:49.920 --> 3:35:55.720]  he was a bad person. I now realize that he is conflicted. He has this good job. He has
[3:35:55.720 --> 3:36:01.280]  prestige. He's making a lot of money. He's probably got a family to support. And he is
[3:36:01.280 --> 3:36:08.160]  told you have to lie. You have to sell yourself out. You have to compromise your integrity
[3:36:08.160 --> 3:36:15.200]  and say things that you know are not true in order to please our globalist owners, in
[3:36:15.200 --> 3:36:21.400]  order to appease Soros and the other people, the warmongers, the patreuses, the Saudis.
[3:36:21.400 --> 3:36:25.840]  It's a very, very compromised man. So we got some callers here. Let's see if we can get
[3:36:25.840 --> 3:36:27.280]  Noreen from Michigan on.
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:34.120]  He has this good job. He has prestige. He's making a lot of money.
[3:36:34.120 --> 3:36:40.280]  Is that you, Noreen? Okay. Let's try Carol.
[3:36:40.280 --> 3:36:43.280]  Hello.
[3:36:43.280 --> 3:36:44.280]  Hello.
[3:36:44.280 --> 3:36:47.280]  Hi, Carol. How are you?
[3:36:47.280 --> 3:36:53.240]  Hi. I'm doing great. I want to thank you guys. I started watching about a month and a half
[3:36:53.240 --> 3:37:01.000]  ago and I picked up the Z-Shield and noticed results within days. So of course I bought
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:08.040]  more of the Z-Shield. Then I tried the X2. Holy moly. I'm now letting the X2, the Z-Shield.
[3:37:08.040 --> 3:37:10.040]  I'm 57. I feel like I'm 20.
[3:37:10.040 --> 3:37:15.640]  You sound great, actually. You sound like you have a lot of vitality and pop and energy
[3:37:15.640 --> 3:37:20.160]  and everything. So maybe I need to get some Z-Shield because, man, I've been running hard.
[3:37:20.160 --> 3:37:23.360]  So how did you hear about Infowars?
[3:37:23.360 --> 3:37:25.680]  I tripped across it on the Internet.
[3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:27.680]  Okay. That's interesting.
[3:37:27.680 --> 3:37:32.240]  It's really funny, but I want to tell people out there, if you try nothing else, try the
[3:37:32.240 --> 3:37:38.840]  Z-Shield. Try the X2 within a week. I have my husband on it, too. I mean, just I'm bouncing
[3:37:38.840 --> 3:37:40.680]  off the walls. I have so much energy.
[3:37:40.680 --> 3:37:43.960]  Amazing. You sound like you. Thank you so much for your call.
[3:37:43.960 --> 3:37:50.200]  Yeah. There you go. That's the whole thing is that is why sharing the links to infowars.com
[3:37:50.200 --> 3:37:54.400]  is so important. That is not a bluff. It isn't when, you know, when Alex says, share the
[3:37:54.400 --> 3:37:57.960]  links. When I say, share the links, we're not, we're not bluffing. We're not paying
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:38:02.920]  you lip service. There's no advertising budget here. There's no commercials for Infowars
[3:38:02.920 --> 3:38:09.280]  running on network TV. There's no big, massive PR and marketing department advertising everything
[3:38:09.280 --> 3:38:13.840]  every day. It is the link sharing. So that is why when people say, how do I support you
[3:38:13.840 --> 3:38:17.760]  guys? I really want to help things out, but my money is a little tight. I can't quite
[3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:18.760]  do this.
[3:38:18.760 --> 3:38:23.240]  The answer is share the links because as you just heard from Carol, she just learned somewhere
[3:38:23.240 --> 3:38:28.320]  on the internet, right? Isn't that beautiful? She just heard about it somewhere on the internet
[3:38:28.320 --> 3:38:33.560]  because somebody out there, somebody listening or watching right now shared that link and
[3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:36.880]  that is how we're going to grow. That is how we're going to win. And that's how we're
[3:38:36.880 --> 3:38:42.600]  going to keep beating down CNN and all the other media terrorists. Matthew, how are you
[3:38:42.600 --> 3:38:56.680]  doing? Matthew. Hello, sir. Can you hear me? I'm doing okay, sir. I just say I've been
[3:38:56.680 --> 3:39:05.200]  listening to Alex for about since 2009. It's great work that all of you guys do. The Patriots
[3:39:05.200 --> 3:39:11.400]  are listening. First, I'd like to talk about the cancel of news network. No surprise when
[3:39:11.400 --> 3:39:19.080]  you look at the Megan Keller story, it's all the same. It's a propaganda that's totally
[3:39:19.080 --> 3:39:26.520]  against Trump. They're upset that Trump won and their candidate also. That's all I got
[3:39:26.520 --> 3:39:35.000]  to say about that. The Russian story needs to watch it close. I think we're in enough
[3:39:35.000 --> 3:39:46.880]  wars as you know. I kind of agree with Ron Paul. And also, thirdly, I've been waiting
[3:39:46.880 --> 3:39:50.880]  to hear. I know Michael Knight has touched on it a little bit. Have you heard of the
[3:39:50.880 --> 3:39:59.560]  latest video that's come out about John Podesta and the latest video that just came out on
[3:39:59.560 --> 3:40:11.360]  the 26th? It's been circling on YouTube. They've got actual video of him with the Pettlegate
[3:40:11.360 --> 3:40:17.360]  stuff. Have you heard about that yet, sir? No, no, I haven't been. I haven't been following
[3:40:17.360 --> 3:40:23.240]  around that much. But I know that Podesta had to testify before the Senate in a closed
[3:40:23.240 --> 3:40:28.320]  door hearing. And that'll be interesting. But yeah, there's always something new going
[3:40:28.320 --> 3:40:35.520]  on. And I appreciate your call and appreciate that you listen in. Thank you. Okay, so yeah,
[3:40:35.520 --> 3:40:41.000]  we had some great callers and we're going to take some more calls. So if you're on hold,
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:46.000]  we're going to get to you because I love taking calls. I've done actually on my own show,
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:51.880]  I've done 100 calls at a time. To me, I can't get enough calls because I learn so much and
[3:40:51.880 --> 3:40:56.520]  I hear so much. And even though I don't agree with everything I hear, it's constantly being
[3:40:56.520 --> 3:41:03.160]  exposed to new perspectives that matter. So Ryan, not Ryan or Brian Stelter, Alex and
[3:41:03.160 --> 3:41:09.000]  I call him Brian Super, he went on this Twitter tirade. And you want to talk about a pampered
[3:41:09.000 --> 3:41:14.880]  little baby, Brian Stelter, he works at CNN. He lives in an apartment. I'm not going to
[3:41:14.880 --> 3:41:21.200]  say where it is, but I know for a fact that the rent is $8,700 a month, just in rent alone.
[3:41:21.200 --> 3:41:28.480]  So he's making enough money to pay $100,000 a year just in rent. He's making $750,000
[3:41:28.480 --> 3:41:35.440]  to a million dollars a year. And he goes on this tirade. Trump is being mean to the media.
[3:41:35.440 --> 3:41:42.400]  He's being mean to us. He's criticizing us. He's such a mean guy. He's creating hatred.
[3:41:42.400 --> 3:41:49.040]  And I thought to myself, have you people ever had a real job? I bet you that there are people
[3:41:49.040 --> 3:41:57.440]  listening right now who have roofed. I've roofed where you're grabbing pallets of shingles,
[3:41:57.440 --> 3:42:03.840]  walking up a ladder, hoping you don't fall backward off of the ladder, 110 degree heat,
[3:42:03.840 --> 3:42:10.840]  the sun is reflecting off the tar on the roof, and you're burning your neck, sunburn everywhere,
[3:42:10.840 --> 3:42:15.720]  your knees hurt, you're aching, you drop things, even if you're with friends, you're cussing
[3:42:15.720 --> 3:42:22.280]  at each other because you're just so frustrated. And that's real work. Journalism like Brian
[3:42:22.280 --> 3:42:29.000]  Svelter is doing, which is even fake news, that isn't real work. Every day that I come
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:35.640]  into the office, I think, what an amazing job. This is incredible. Now, do people yell at
[3:42:35.640 --> 3:42:41.120]  me? Sure. Do my own fans yell at me? Sure. Do people criticize me? Do they call me a
[3:42:41.120 --> 3:42:45.000]  sellout because I won't talk about a story they think is important, or they feel like
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:50.760]  I'm not talking about things? Oh, sure, of course. But I've worked, I've waited tables.
[3:42:50.760 --> 3:42:55.560]  Call it, if you've ever worked a real job, call in, and let's talk about what a real
[3:42:55.560 --> 3:42:59.840]  job is, where you have customers screaming at you. You have a customer that you know
[3:42:59.840 --> 3:43:04.600]  that's wrong, and maybe they have a bad day, or maybe they're mad at the world, and what
[3:43:04.600 --> 3:43:09.560]  do they do? They want to take it out on you, and you just have to put up with it, or they'll
[3:43:09.560 --> 3:43:14.720]  complain to the manager, and you get fired. And by the way, I've had those kind of jobs
[3:43:14.720 --> 3:43:22.160]  where I'd made $7.85 an hour. That's what I made $7.85 an hour, and then on the weekend,
[3:43:22.160 --> 3:43:27.640]  I think I'd make $11.25 or something like that. So for $7.35 an hour, people would
[3:43:27.640 --> 3:43:32.560]  come in and scream at me and take out all their problems out on me, and I would just
[3:43:32.560 --> 3:43:37.400]  have to say, okay, ma'am. Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Thank you. Yes, ma'am.
[3:43:37.400 --> 3:43:42.440]  Okay, that's great, ma'am. I'm going to call your manager, right? That's a real job. This
[3:43:42.440 --> 3:43:46.760]  is why, of course, CNN, what they don't understand, they're making such big blunders. You never
[3:43:46.760 --> 3:43:51.560]  hear me complain about my job, even though I work long hours. I was in Austin with the
[3:43:51.560 --> 3:43:56.680]  Office for the Meg and Kelly thing, flew home for about 12 hours. Then I flew to D.C. Then
[3:43:56.680 --> 3:44:00.080]  I had to get up early to go do some work in New York. Then I had to take the early train
[3:44:00.080 --> 3:44:05.760]  back to D.C. to meet with the White House. I have all this stuff going on, and I'm not
[3:44:05.760 --> 3:44:11.000]  saying, oh, I'm so, I'm so exhausted. I work, oh, being a journalist is such hard work. Oh,
[3:44:11.000 --> 3:44:17.000]  my God, pity me. How dare anybody criticize me or ever give me a mean tweet. All I got
[3:44:17.000 --> 3:44:22.240]  to think about is, man, I have to tassle corn. You're waking up at four in the morning, probably
[3:44:22.240 --> 3:44:27.720]  rambling. But the point is, I've had real jobs. I've grown up out of the country, worked
[3:44:27.720 --> 3:44:33.200]  at roofed, roofed homes and everything, done all the backbreaking labor. So these CNN people
[3:44:33.200 --> 3:44:39.040]  like Jim Acosta, Brian Svelter, they're such babies. And there are people who want, can't
[3:44:39.040 --> 3:44:43.240]  even find a job roofing. And that's what they want to do. So every time they go on these
[3:44:43.240 --> 3:44:49.320]  tirades and they cry, I'm happy. I'm like this out here, you know, thinking this is amazing.
[3:44:49.320 --> 3:44:53.680]  I can't believe how badly they're screwing up because they're essentially telling everybody
[3:44:53.680 --> 3:44:59.160]  who's listening in a struggling or is very hardworking, they're complaining like they
[3:44:59.160 --> 3:45:03.640]  come home and they're, you know, they're wanting their significant other, not realizing that
[3:45:03.640 --> 3:45:08.360]  they look just petty, they look trifling. And that is what the news has become about.
[3:45:08.360 --> 3:45:15.320]  There's no gravitas. There's no seriousness. It's just trifling and whining about the most
[3:45:15.320 --> 3:45:21.920]  petty, petty complaints that 99% of Americans would, yeah, Jim Acosta, how does this feel
[3:45:21.920 --> 3:45:27.160]  like America, when the White House take cues conservatives, then openly trashes the news
[3:45:27.160 --> 3:45:29.800]  media. They're openly trashing us.
[3:45:29.800 --> 3:45:37.040]  Grow up, bro. This guy makes $500,000 a year. Grow up. You make $500,000 a year and people
[3:45:37.040 --> 3:45:43.040]  say some mean stuff to you. You're crying like this to people who would kill, have the
[3:45:43.040 --> 3:45:46.920]  kind of economic and these people will have trust ones too. So not only are they making
[3:45:46.920 --> 3:45:52.120]  $500,000 a year, $1 million a year, they all have trust funds. So they're crying to people.
[3:45:52.120 --> 3:45:57.120]  It's just petty, it's small minded. So let's take a few more calls here. We got quite a
[3:45:57.120 --> 3:46:03.520]  few here to take. So let's look at, we'll go to Dovan in Florida. How are you Dovan?
[3:46:03.520 --> 3:46:07.960]  Hey, how's it going, sir? Well, thank you.
[3:46:07.960 --> 3:46:14.520]  Good to go. Yeah, I've actually worked a few jobs, Marine Corps, construction, security
[3:46:14.520 --> 3:46:21.560]  at a hotel. So I know what you mean about working those long hours and having to fulfill
[3:46:21.560 --> 3:46:27.040]  a quota in a certain amount of time, as little as possible, and then having to do that day
[3:46:27.040 --> 3:46:31.200]  after day after day after day. And if you don't, there's 10 people willing to replace
[3:46:31.200 --> 3:46:36.360]  you. And so having to keep up with that, it's crazy out there. And a lot of people, they
[3:46:36.360 --> 3:46:40.920]  don't have time to click onto the news. And so when they do click onto the news and they
[3:46:40.920 --> 3:46:45.240]  hear all this backward stuff, a lot of times they just tune it out. And that's why it's
[3:46:45.240 --> 3:46:48.320]  great that you guys are out there putting that alternative message out. No, I don't
[3:46:48.320 --> 3:46:52.440]  even want to say alternative, just the truth out there saying, hey, this is what's really
[3:46:52.440 --> 3:46:58.000]  going on. Look, look, look, we have how you guys show everything on camera. Here's the
[3:46:58.000 --> 3:47:03.960]  document. All that stuff is so important. Yeah, thank you. And you actually make a good
[3:47:03.960 --> 3:47:09.640]  point too, which is that a lot of those jobs I had, if you get fired from it because the
[3:47:09.640 --> 3:47:14.440]  customer complained about it, even if that's a very grueling job that doesn't pay well,
[3:47:14.440 --> 3:47:18.560]  there's 10 people that'll take it. Whereas if you're in media and you have these white
[3:47:18.560 --> 3:47:23.720]  collar jobs like they have in the media, Jim Acosta, he's fine. This guy, he's set for
[3:47:23.720 --> 3:47:29.120]  life, trust fund, big salary, big severance. If he, you know, the concept of severance,
[3:47:29.120 --> 3:47:34.960]  I mean, think of, think about it, those people at CNN, the three fake news reporters to one
[3:47:34.960 --> 3:47:39.360]  of whom had won a Pulitzer and one who had got a Pulitzer nomination, they all got their
[3:47:39.360 --> 3:47:44.800]  contracts bought out. Boy, where I grew up, if you got fired, that was just it. You had
[3:47:44.800 --> 3:47:49.000]  no job. Good luck. I hope you save money for a rainy day. These people commit journalistic
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:56.040]  fraud and they're walking out of the door with checks for $100,000, $150,000, yet they're
[3:47:56.040 --> 3:48:06.040]  going to go on TV and online and complain to people who are barely getting by. You have
[3:48:06.040 --> 3:48:07.040]  a comment to that?
[3:48:07.040 --> 3:48:13.280]  Well, Mr. Acosta is very evil. I think so. I hate the fact that I kind of share a name
[3:48:13.280 --> 3:48:21.160]  with him. My name is, well, I have Acosta and I'm Hispanic. I was a first generation
[3:48:21.160 --> 3:48:26.280]  born Hispanic, born here in America, had to hear stories about how my mother learned English
[3:48:26.280 --> 3:48:31.320]  before she even came to America, how she hates that people don't respect that. She learned
[3:48:31.320 --> 3:48:36.080]  because she was working for communists like Mr. Acosta, who like to keep their boot on
[3:48:36.080 --> 3:48:40.840]  people down there in South America and stuff like that. Those were the power games from
[3:48:40.840 --> 3:48:49.200]  Russia and America back in the days. My mom was growing up down there in Honduras. I've
[3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:55.000]  heard plenty of stories about people like Mr. Acosta. My mom is striving and getting
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:48:59.960]  out and learning English and coming to America here legally with the rest of our family pulling
[3:48:59.960 --> 3:49:04.880]  together, putting their lambitas, that's what they call the money in Honduras, putting
[3:49:04.880 --> 3:49:09.840]  them together. Each of us could jump over here legally filling out the documents, learning
[3:49:09.840 --> 3:49:17.560]  about the history, everything. It's very important to us. My father, who is Cuban, basically
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:25.480]  came over here with his teeth, basically lost his teeth in prison in Cuba, came over here.
[3:49:25.480 --> 3:49:30.360]  I didn't meet him until later until I was in the military. I was raised by actually
[3:49:30.360 --> 3:49:35.520]  a Puerto Rican who was an army and taught me about America and all the things that Alex
[3:49:35.520 --> 3:49:40.880]  has always said. You guys are always talking about the truth. I always tell people, I
[3:49:40.880 --> 3:49:46.480]  curse people, hey, go on the internet. You can see AJ with that old school freaking tape
[3:49:46.480 --> 3:49:52.720]  recorder out there freaking saying, hey, what about this going on freaking in the Oklahoma
[3:49:52.720 --> 3:49:55.800]  City bombing? Why aren't you guys covering this? Why aren't you guys talking about this?
[3:49:55.800 --> 3:50:01.440]  You guys are covering this up, getting in their faces since I was a child. He's been
[3:50:01.440 --> 3:50:07.200]  doing that since I was a child. I just give a mad respect to him and you guys are going
[3:50:07.200 --> 3:50:11.720]  out there. I know you guys get threatened and stuff like that because being in the military,
[3:50:11.720 --> 3:50:19.720]  you see all kinds of things and freaking. I was actually a Fallujah Marine. When I was
[3:50:19.720 --> 3:50:24.000]  in Al-Assad, before we even went to Fallujah, we were at Al-Assad and a bunch of different
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:28.880]  other bases. You always see the little area where the CIA goes and they take the little
[3:50:28.880 --> 3:50:33.000]  guy. It's always dark and creepy and you're wondering what they're doing over there. Sometimes
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:38.880]  you get tasked with bringing some guy over there. You get attached to that special platoon
[3:50:38.880 --> 3:50:42.960]  that basically supports them. It's kind of crazy.
[3:50:42.960 --> 3:50:45.840]  Thank you. Thank you for the call and thank you for the support. We're actually heading
[3:50:45.840 --> 3:50:51.040]  over to break, but again, another great call. I love the calls. Final segment, I don't know,
[3:50:51.040 --> 3:50:55.240]  why don't we just take more calls? We're going to do final segment. I'm going to take more
[3:50:55.240 --> 3:51:00.080]  calls. Thank you so much. I'll see you after the break.
[3:51:00.080 --> 3:51:04.120]  Extendivite really works. Just listen to what some people have to say.
[3:51:04.120 --> 3:51:09.640]  I'm six months ago. My wife bought Extendivite. She didn't tell me she was doing it to me.
[3:51:09.640 --> 3:51:14.560]  So after about three days, I said, maybe the weather's changed or something. I said, my
[3:51:14.560 --> 3:51:19.920]  legs feel really good. She goes, well, I've been doing you this stuff and it was Extendivite.
[3:51:19.920 --> 3:51:26.280]  You know that I'm about 75% better. I can actually climb stairs now and I can get up
[3:51:26.280 --> 3:51:30.680]  out of chairs. I can, I can even get down and, you know, I got to work under a table
[3:51:30.680 --> 3:51:34.960]  or a computer table and work on a computer. I can actually get back up off the floor.
[3:51:34.960 --> 3:51:39.120]  You know what? It's an amazing product. I can't believe I didn't think anything short
[3:51:39.120 --> 3:51:44.040]  of having surgery was going to help. Extendivite is only $69.95 for a two month
[3:51:44.040 --> 3:51:51.960]  supply of either capsules or liquid. Call now. That's 1-877-928-8822 or visit partdrop.com.
[3:51:51.960 --> 3:52:03.080]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[3:52:03.080 --> 3:52:07.760]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[3:52:07.760 --> 3:52:13.440]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense
[3:52:13.440 --> 3:52:18.760]  Support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[3:52:18.760 --> 3:52:22.720]  absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer. It is a
[3:52:22.720 --> 3:52:28.040]  classical 360 wins. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[3:52:28.040 --> 3:52:33.040]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[3:52:33.040 --> 3:52:36.880]  you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family and you owe it to
[3:52:36.880 --> 3:52:41.720]  the future of this country and the world that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and
[3:52:41.720 --> 3:52:47.360]  as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those
[3:52:47.360 --> 3:52:51.200]  brush fires the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your
[3:52:51.200 --> 3:52:54.880]  support and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change

[3:54:35.280 --> 3:54:41.160]  to brag or whatever. That isn't the big picture here. The big picture here is that is how

[3:55:38.880 --> 3:55:44.080]  like we got one or two more calls. We're going to take Ben from Nevada.
[3:55:44.080 --> 3:55:56.160]  John, is that you, Mike? It is. Great to talk to you. I love what you're doing. I've actually
[3:55:56.160 --> 3:56:00.400]  reached out to the Outstanding Show multiple times in the last couple of days and have
[3:56:00.400 --> 3:56:06.400]  written letters to Governor Sandoval here in Nevada. CNN has broadcasted to the children
[3:56:06.400 --> 3:56:12.040]  in middle school in fifth and sixth grade for the first 20 minutes of their school day.
[3:56:12.040 --> 3:56:18.720]  This actually broadcasts them in Washington, Oregon and Nevada. So I've written letters
[3:56:18.720 --> 3:56:23.120]  to the governor and he has not reached out to contact me back. So if somebody maybe could
[3:56:23.120 --> 3:56:27.880]  look into that with a little bit more. Yeah, where is that? This is the first I've heard
[3:56:27.880 --> 3:56:32.680]  about it. So essentially children are being propagand. I can't confirm this, but according
[3:56:32.680 --> 3:56:39.000]  to you, children are being propagandized like it's Mao and China or something like that.
[3:56:39.000 --> 3:56:44.160]  Tell me more about this. I really like to hear more. I've got two children in fifth
[3:56:44.160 --> 3:56:50.760]  and sixth grade. Both of them are required to watch 20 minutes of CNN morning news. I've
[3:56:50.760 --> 3:56:57.480]  actually talked to the principal and it's required. So I don't believe it's right. I
[3:56:57.480 --> 3:57:03.800]  think it's completely wrong. And also there's a fight in Washington and Oregon as well to
[3:57:03.800 --> 3:57:11.240]  stop this. Okay, so this is actually a major scandal that children are forced to watch
[3:57:11.240 --> 3:57:15.960]  government propaganda for 20 minutes a day. So first I've ever heard of it. I would definitely
[3:57:15.960 --> 3:57:20.960]  like to follow up more with this story. Maybe send me a, are you on Twitter? You could send
[3:57:20.960 --> 3:57:24.760]  me a direct message the name of the school or something like that. I would like to look
[3:57:24.760 --> 3:57:29.520]  more into this. This is terrible. Yeah, no, I'll get you all the information. I haven't
[3:57:29.520 --> 3:57:33.440]  been contacted back by the governor at all. I've tried to reach out a couple of times,
[3:57:33.440 --> 3:57:39.960]  but I'm at Hill Benjamin on Twitter and I'll DM you. Okay, thank you for your call so much.
[3:57:39.960 --> 3:57:45.880]  Yeah. So again, that is why I love taking calls because you are the best source of information
[3:57:45.880 --> 3:57:52.320]  we have for new journalism, for new stories. I mean, this is an outrage to think that children
[3:57:52.320 --> 3:57:57.200]  are being forced. This is why you can't be frustrated when you meet brainwashed zombies
[3:57:57.200 --> 3:58:03.320]  in their 20s, 30s, 40s or 50s. This is starting when their children, they are brainwashing
[3:58:03.320 --> 3:58:08.520]  your children every day. According to this caller, it's a requirement. It isn't like
[3:58:08.520 --> 3:58:12.200]  me, you know, when I was a kid, they played channel one, but you could do homework. You
[3:58:12.200 --> 3:58:18.520]  didn't actually have to watch it. CNN is becoming required. That's how desperate they are. People
[3:58:18.520 --> 3:58:23.240]  don't want to watch. I mean, there's so many layers to unpack there. CNN is so corrupt
[3:58:23.240 --> 3:58:29.320]  and so vile that they can't get people to voluntarily watch it. They now have to enlist
[3:58:29.320 --> 3:58:33.920]  the government. This could be a big constitutional issue. Thank you for your calls. Thank you
[3:58:33.920 --> 3:58:49.240]  as always for your support. This is Mike Cernovich, the fourth hour real Alex Jones.
